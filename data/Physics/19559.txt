'''Mechanics''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|μηχανική}}) is the area of [[physics]] concerned with the motions of [[physical object]]s. [[Force]]s applied to objects result in [[Displacement (vector)|displacements]], or changes of an object's position relative to its environment.
This branch of [[physics]] has its origins in [[Ancient Greece]] with the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Archimedes]]<ref>Dugas, Rene. A History of Classical Mechanics.

During the [[early modern period]], scientists such as [[Galileo]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] laid the foundation for what is now known as [[classical mechanics]].
It is a branch of [[classical physics]] that deals with particles that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. 
It can also be defined as a branch of science which deals with the motion of and forces on bodies not in the quantum realm. The field is today less widely understood in terms of quantum theory.

In the Middle Ages, Aristotle's theories were criticized and modified by a number of figures, beginning with [[John Philoponus]] in the 6th century. A central problem was that of [[projectile motion]], which was discussed by Hipparchus and Philoponus.

Persian Islamic polymath [[Ibn Sīnā]] published his theory of motion in ''[[The Book of Healing]]'' (1020). He said that an impetus is imparted to a projectile by the thrower, and viewed it as persistent, requiring external forces such as [[air resistance]] to dissipate it.<ref name=Espinoza>{{cite journal | last1 = Espinoza | first1 = Fernando  | date = 2005 | title = An analysis of the historical development of ideas about motion and its implications for teaching | journal = Physics Education | volume = 40 | issue = 2| page = 141 | doi=10.1088/0031-9120/40/2/002|bibcode = 2005PhyEd..40..139E }}</ref><ref name=Nasr>{{Cite book |title=The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia |author=[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] & Mehdi Amin Razavi |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=1996 |isbn=978-0-7007-0314-2 |page=72}}</ref><ref name=Sayili>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb37219.x|author=[[Aydin Sayili]]|date=1987|title=Ibn Sīnā and Buridan on the Motion of the Projectile|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=500|issue=1|pages=477–482|bibcode=1987NYASA.500..477S}}</ref> Ibn Sina made distinction between 'force' and 'inclination' (called "mayl"), and argued that an object gained mayl when the object is in opposition to its natural motion.

He also claimed that projectile in a vacuum would not stop unless it is acted upon. This conception of motion is consistent with Newton's first law of motion, inertia. Which states that an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an external force.<ref>Espinoza, Fernando.

On the question of a body subject to a constant (uniform) force, the 12th-century Jewish-Arab scholar [[Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi]] (born Nathanel, Iraqi, of Baghdad) stated that constant force imparts constant acceleration. According to [[Shlomo Pines]], al-Baghdaadi's theory of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] was "the oldest negation of [[Aristotle]]'s fundamental dynamic law [namely, that a constant force produces a uniform motion], [and is thus an] anticipation in a vague fashion of the fundamental law of [[classical mechanics]] [namely, that a force applied continuously produces acceleration]."<ref>{{cite encyclopedia  | last = Pines  | first = Shlomo  | title = Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī , Hibat Allah  | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 26–28   | publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons  | location = New York  | year = 1970  | isbn = 0-684-10114-9 }}

===Early modern age===

[[File:Taccola first piston.jpg|thumb|First European depiction of a [[piston]] pump, by [[Taccola]], c. 1450.<ref>{{cite book| last = Hill | first = Donald Routledge | title = A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times | location = London | publisher =  Routledge | year = 1996 | page = 143 | isbn =  0-415-15291-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MqSXc5sGZJUC&q=Taccola+first+piston&pg=PA143}}</ref>]]
Two central figures in the early modern age are [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Galileo's final statement of his mechanics, particularly of falling bodies, is his ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' (1638). Newton's 1687 ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' provided a detailed mathematical account of mechanics, using the newly developed mathematics of [[calculus]] and providing the basis of [[Newtonian mechanics]].<ref name="mechanics"/>
[[File:Traditional Windmill mechanic.JPG|thumb|left|18th century Windmill mechanics Ireland]]
There is some dispute over priority of various ideas: Newton's ''Principia'' is certainly the seminal work and has been tremendously influential, and the systematic mathematics therein did not and could not have been stated earlier because calculus had not been developed. However, many of the ideas, particularly as pertain to inertia (impetus) and falling bodies had been developed and stated by earlier researchers, both the then-recent Galileo and the less-known medieval predecessors. Precise credit is at times difficult or contentious because scientific language and standards of proof changed, so whether medieval statements are ''equivalent'' to modern statements or ''sufficient'' proof, or instead ''similar'' to modern statements and ''hypotheses'' is often debatable.

===Modern age===

Two main modern developments in mechanics are [[general relativity]] of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], and [[quantum mechanics]], both developed in the 20th century based in part on earlier 19th-century ideas. The development in the modern continuum mechanics, particularly in the areas of elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, electrodynamics and thermodynamics of deformable media, started in the second half of the 20th century.

==Types of mechanical bodies==

The often-used term '''[[Physical body|body]]''' needs to stand for a wide assortment of objects, including particles, [[projectiles]], [[spacecraft]], [[star]]s, parts of [[mechanical engineering|machinery]], parts of [[solids]], parts of [[fluids]] ([[gases]] and [[liquids]]), etc.

Other distinctions between the various sub-disciplines of mechanics, concern the nature of the bodies being described. Particles are bodies with little (known) internal structure, treated as mathematical points in classical mechanics. Rigid bodies have size and shape, but retain a simplicity close to that of the particle, adding just a few so-called [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], such as orientation in space.

Otherwise, bodies may be semi-rigid, i.e. [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], or non-rigid, i.e. [[fluid]]. These subjects have both classical and quantum divisions of study.

For instance, the motion of a spacecraft, regarding its [[orbit]] and attitude ([[rotation]]), is described by the relativistic theory of classical mechanics, while the analogous movements of an [[atomic nucleus]] are described by quantum mechanics.

== Sub-disciplines ==

The following are two lists of various subjects that are studied in mechanics.

Note that there is also the "[[Field theory (physics)|theory of fields]]" which constitutes a separate discipline in physics, formally treated as distinct from mechanics, whether [[Classical field theory|classical fields]] or [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]]. But in actual practice, subjects belonging to mechanics and fields are closely interwoven. Thus, for instance, forces that act on particles are frequently derived from fields ([[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] or [[gravitational]]), and particles generate fields by acting as sources. In fact, in quantum mechanics, particles themselves are fields, as described theoretically by the [[wave function]].

The following are described as forming classical mechanics:
* [[classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]], the original theory of motion ([[kinematics]]) and forces ([[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]]).
* [[Analytical mechanics]] is a reformulation of Newtonian mechanics with an emphasis on system energy, rather than on forces. There are two main branches of analytical mechanics:
** [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], a theoretical [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]], based on the principle of conservation of energy.
** [[Lagrangian mechanics]], another theoretical formalism, based on the principle of the [[least action]].
* [[Classical statistical mechanics]] generalizes ordinary classical mechanics to consider systems in an unknown state; often used to derive [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties.
* [[Celestial mechanics]], the motion of bodies in space: planets, comets, stars, [[galaxies]], etc.
* [[Astrodynamics]], spacecraft [[navigation]], etc.
* [[Solid mechanics]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], [[viscoelasticity]] exhibited by deformable solids.
* [[Fracture mechanics]] 
* [[Acoustics]], [[sound]] ( = density variation propagation) in solids, fluids and gases.
* [[Statics]], semi-rigid bodies in [[mechanical equilibrium]]
* [[Fluid mechanics]], the motion of fluids
* [[Soil mechanics]], mechanical behavior of soils
* [[Continuum mechanics]], mechanics of continua (both solid and fluid)
* [[Hydraulics]], mechanical properties of liquids
* [[Fluid statics]], liquids in equilibrium
* [[Applied mechanics|Applied mechanics, or Engineering mechanics]]
* [[Biomechanics]], solids, fluids, etc. in biology
* [[Biophysics]], physical processes in living organisms
* [[Relativistic physics|Relativistic]] or [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] mechanics, universal [[gravitation]].

===Quantum ===
The following are categorized as being part of [[quantum mechanics]]:
* [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger wave mechanics]], used to describe the movements  of the wavefunction of a single particle.
* [[Matrix mechanics]] is an alternative formulation that allows considering systems with a finite-dimensional state space.
* [[Quantum statistical mechanics]] generalizes ordinary quantum mechanics to consider systems in an unknown state; often used to derive [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties.
* [[Particle physics]], the motion, structure, and reactions of particles
* [[Nuclear physics]], the motion, structure, and reactions of nuclei
* [[Condensed matter physics]], quantum gases, solids, liquids, etc.

Historically, [[classical mechanics]] had been around for nearly a quarter millennium before [[quantum mechanics]] developed. Classical mechanics originated with [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] in [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]], developed over the seventeenth century. Quantum mechanics developed later, over the nineteenth century, precipitated by [[Planck postulate | Planck's postulate]] and Albert Einstein's explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]]. Both fields are commonly held to constitute the most certain knowledge that exists about physical nature.

Classical mechanics has especially often been viewed as a model for other so-called [[exact science]]s. Essential in this respect is the extensive use of [[mathematics]] in theories, as well as the decisive role played by [[experiment]] in generating and testing them.

[[Quantum]] mechanics is of a bigger  scope, as it encompasses classical mechanics as a sub-discipline which applies under certain restricted circumstances. According to the [[correspondence principle]], there is no contradiction or conflict between the two subjects, each simply pertains to specific situations. The correspondence principle states that the behavior of systems described by quantum theories reproduces classical physics in the limit of large [[quantum numbers]], i.e. if quantum mechanics is applied to large systems (for e.g. a baseball), the result would almost be the same if classical mechanics had been applied. Quantum mechanics has superseded classical mechanics at the foundation level and is indispensable for the explanation and prediction of processes at the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic level. However, for macroscopic processes classical mechanics is able to solve problems which are unmanageably difficult (mainly due to computational limits) in quantum mechanics and hence remains useful and well used.
Modern descriptions of such behavior begin with a careful definition of such quantities as displacement (distance moved), time, velocity, acceleration, mass, and force. Until about 400 years ago, however, motion was explained from a very different point of view. For example, following the ideas of Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle, scientists reasoned that a cannonball falls down because its natural position is in the Earth; the sun, the moon, and the stars travel in circles around the earth because it is the nature of heavenly objects to travel in perfect circles.

Often cited as father to modern science, [[Galileo]] brought together the ideas of other great thinkers of his time and began to calculate motion in terms of distance travelled from some starting position and the time that it took. He showed that the speed of falling objects increases steadily during the time of their fall. This acceleration is the same for heavy objects as for light ones, provided air friction (air resistance) is discounted. The English mathematician and physicist [[Isaac Newton]] improved this analysis by defining force and mass and relating these to acceleration. For objects traveling at speeds close to the speed of light, Newton's laws were superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]’s [[Special relativity|theory of relativity]]. [A sentence illustrating the computational complication of Einstein's theory of relativity.] For atomic and subatomic particles, Newton's laws were superseded by [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]. For everyday phenomena, however, Newton's three laws of motion remain the cornerstone of dynamics, which is the study of what causes motion.

=== Relativistic ===

In analogy to the distinction between quantum and classical mechanics, [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general]] and [[Special relativity|special]] theories of [[theory of relativity|relativity]] have expanded the scope of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Galileo]]'s formulation of mechanics. The differences between relativistic and Newtonian mechanics become significant and even dominant as the velocity of a body approaches the [[speed of light]]. For instance, in [[classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]], [[Newton's laws of motion]] specify that '''F''' = ''m'''''a''', whereas in [[relativistic mechanics]] and [[Lorentz transformations]], which were first discovered by [[Hendrik Lorentz]], '''F''' = &gamma;''m'''''a''' (where γ is the [[Lorentz factor]], which is almost equal to 1 for low speeds).

Relativistic corrections are also needed for quantum mechanics, although general relativity has not been integrated. The two theories remain incompatible, a hurdle which must be overcome in developing a [[theory of everything]].

There is some dispute over priority of various ideas: Newton's ''Principia'' is certainly the seminal work and has been tremendously influential, and the systematic mathematics therein did not and could not have been stated earlier because calculus had not been developed. However, many of the ideas, particularly as pertain to inertia (impetus) and falling bodies had been developed and stated by earlier researchers, both the then-recent Galileo and the less-known medieval predecessors. Precise credit is at times difficult or contentious because scientific language and standards of proof changed, so whether medieval statements are ''equivalent'' to modern statements or ''sufficient'' proof, or instead ''similar'' to modern statements and ''hypotheses'' is often debatable.

===Modern age===

Two main modern developments in mechanics are [[general relativity]] of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], and [[quantum mechanics]], both developed in the 20th century based in part on earlier 19th-century ideas. The development in the modern continuum mechanics, particularly in the areas of elasticity, plasticity, fluid dynamics, electrodynamics and thermodynamics of deformable media, started in the second half of the 20th century.

==Types of mechanical bodies==

The often-used term '''[[Physical body|body]]''' needs to stand for a wide assortment of objects, including particles, [[projectiles]], [[spacecraft]], [[star]]s, parts of [[mechanical engineering|machinery]], parts of [[solids]], parts of [[fluids]] ([[gases]] and [[liquids]]), etc.

Other distinctions between the various sub-disciplines of mechanics, concern the nature of the bodies being described. Particles are bodies with little (known) internal structure, treated as mathematical points in classical mechanics. Rigid bodies have size and shape, but retain a simplicity close to that of the particle, adding just a few so-called [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], such as orientation in space.

Otherwise, bodies may be semi-rigid, i.e. [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]], or non-rigid, i.e. [[fluid]]. These subjects have both classical and quantum divisions of study.

For instance, the motion of a spacecraft, regarding its [[orbit]] and attitude ([[rotation]]), is described by the relativistic theory of classical mechanics, while the analogous movements of an [[atomic nucleus]] are described by quantum mechanics.

== Sub-disciplines ==

The following are two lists of various subjects that are studied in mechanics.

Note that there is also the "[[Field theory (physics)|theory of fields]]" which constitutes a separate discipline in physics, formally treated as distinct from mechanics, whether [[Classical field theory|classical fields]] or [[quantum field theory|quantum fields]]. But in actual practice, subjects belonging to mechanics and fields are closely interwoven. Thus, for instance, forces that act on particles are frequently derived from fields ([[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] or [[gravitational]]), and particles generate fields by acting as sources. In fact, in quantum mechanics, particles themselves are fields, as described theoretically by the [[wave function]].

The following are described as forming classical mechanics:
* [[classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]], the original theory of motion ([[kinematics]]) and forces ([[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]]).
* [[Analytical mechanics]] is a reformulation of Newtonian mechanics with an emphasis on system energy, rather than on forces. There are two main branches of analytical mechanics:
** [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], a theoretical [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]], based on the principle of conservation of energy.
** [[Lagrangian mechanics]], another theoretical formalism, based on the principle of the [[least action]].
* [[Classical statistical mechanics]] generalizes ordinary classical mechanics to consider systems in an unknown state; often used to derive [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties.
* [[Celestial mechanics]], the motion of bodies in space: planets, comets, stars, [[galaxies]], etc.
* [[Astrodynamics]], spacecraft [[navigation]], etc.
* [[Solid mechanics]], [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], [[viscoelasticity]] exhibited by deformable solids.
* [[Fracture mechanics]] 
* [[Acoustics]], [[sound]] ( = density variation propagation) in solids, fluids and gases.
* [[Statics]], semi-rigid bodies in [[mechanical equilibrium]]
* [[Fluid mechanics]], the motion of fluids
* [[Soil mechanics]], mechanical behavior of soils
* [[Continuum mechanics]], mechanics of continua (both solid and fluid)
* [[Hydraulics]], mechanical properties of liquids
* [[Fluid statics]], liquids in equilibrium
* [[Applied mechanics|Applied mechanics, or Engineering mechanics]]
* [[Biomechanics]], solids, fluids, etc. in biology
* [[Biophysics]], physical processes in living organisms
* [[Relativistic physics|Relativistic]] or [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] mechanics, universal [[gravitation]].

===Quantum ===
The following are categorized as being part of [[quantum mechanics]]:
* [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger wave mechanics]], used to describe the movements  of the wavefunction of a single particle.
* [[Matrix mechanics]] is an alternative formulation that allows considering systems with a finite-dimensional state space.
* [[Quantum statistical mechanics]] generalizes ordinary quantum mechanics to consider systems in an unknown state; often used to derive [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties.
* [[Particle physics]], the motion, structure, and reactions of particles
* [[Nuclear physics]], the motion, structure, and reactions of nuclei
* [[Condensed matter physics]], quantum gases, solids, liquids, etc.

Historically, [[classical mechanics]] had been around for nearly a quarter millennium before [[quantum mechanics]] developed. Classical mechanics originated with [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] in [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]], developed over the seventeenth century. Quantum mechanics developed later, over the nineteenth century, precipitated by [[Planck postulate | Planck's postulate]] and Albert Einstein's explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]]. Both fields are commonly held to constitute the most certain knowledge that exists about physical nature.

Classical mechanics has especially often been viewed as a model for other so-called [[exact science]]s. Essential in this respect is the extensive use of [[mathematics]] in theories, as well as the decisive role played by [[experiment]] in generating and testing them.

[[Quantum]] mechanics is of a bigger  scope, as it encompasses classical mechanics as a sub-discipline which applies under certain restricted circumstances. According to the [[correspondence principle]], there is no contradiction or conflict between the two subjects, each simply pertains to specific situations. The correspondence principle states that the behavior of systems described by quantum theories reproduces classical physics in the limit of large [[quantum numbers]], i.e. if quantum mechanics is applied to large systems (for e.g. a baseball), the result would almost be the same if classical mechanics had been applied. Quantum mechanics has superseded classical mechanics at the foundation level and is indispensable for the explanation and prediction of processes at the molecular, atomic, and sub-atomic level. However, for macroscopic processes classical mechanics is able to solve problems which are unmanageably difficult (mainly due to computational limits) in quantum mechanics and hence remains useful and well used.
Modern descriptions of such behavior begin with a careful definition of such quantities as displacement (distance moved), time, velocity, acceleration, mass, and force. Until about 400 years ago, however, motion was explained from a very different point of view. For example, following the ideas of Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle, scientists reasoned that a cannonball falls down because its natural position is in the Earth; the sun, the moon, and the stars travel in circles around the earth because it is the nature of heavenly objects to travel in perfect circles.

Often cited as father to modern science, [[Galileo]] brought together the ideas of other great thinkers of his time and began to calculate motion in terms of distance travelled from some starting position and the time that it took. He showed that the speed of falling objects increases steadily during the time of their fall. This acceleration is the same for heavy objects as for light ones, provided air friction (air resistance) is discounted. The English mathematician and physicist [[Isaac Newton]] improved this analysis by defining force and mass and relating these to acceleration. For objects traveling at speeds close to the speed of light, Newton's laws were superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]’s [[Special relativity|theory of relativity]]. [A sentence illustrating the computational complication of Einstein's theory of relativity.] For atomic and subatomic particles, Newton's laws were superseded by [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]. For everyday phenomena, however, Newton's three laws of motion remain the cornerstone of dynamics, which is the study of what causes motion.

=== Relativistic ===

In analogy to the distinction between quantum and classical mechanics, [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[General relativity|general]] and [[Special relativity|special]] theories of [[theory of relativity|relativity]] have expanded the scope of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Galileo]]'s formulation of mechanics. The differences between relativistic and Newtonian mechanics become significant and even dominant as the velocity of a body approaches the [[speed of light]]. For instance, in [[classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]], [[Newton's laws of motion]] specify that '''F''' = ''m'''''a''', whereas in [[relativistic mechanics]] and [[Lorentz transformations]], which were first discovered by [[Hendrik Lorentz]], '''F''' = &gamma;''m'''''a''' (where γ is the [[Lorentz factor]], which is almost equal to 1 for low speeds).

Relativistic corrections are also needed for quantum mechanics, although general relativity has not been integrated. The two theories remain incompatible, a hurdle which must be overcome in developing a [[theory of everything]].
