=== Ancient astronomy ===
{{Main|History of astronomy}}
[[File:Senenmut-Grab.JPG|thumb|right|Ancient [[Egyptian astronomy]] is evident in monuments like the [[Astronomical ceiling of Senemut Tomb|ceiling of Senemut's tomb]] from the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]].]]
[[Astronomy]] is one of the oldest [[natural science]]s. Early civilizations dating back before 3000&nbsp;BCE, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[ancient Egypt]]ians, and the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], had a predictive knowledge and a basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. The stars and planets, believed to represent gods, were often worshipped. While the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence, these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were found to traverse [[great circle]]s across the sky,<ref name="krupp2003"/> which however did not explain the positions of the [[planet]]s.

According to [[Asger Aaboe]], the origins of [[Western world|Western]] astronomy can be found in [[Mesopotamia]], and all Western efforts in the [[exact science]]s are descended from late [[Babylonian astronomy]].<ref name ="aaboe1991">{{harvnb |Aaboe|1991}}</ref> [[Egyptian astronomy|Egyptian astronomers]] left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies,<ref name="clagett1995">{{harvnb |Clagett|1995}}</ref> while Greek poet [[Homer]] wrote of various celestial objects in his ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''; later [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomers]] provided names, which are still used today, for most constellations visible from the [[Northern Hemisphere]].<ref name="thurston1994">{{harvnb |Thurston|1994}}</ref>

=== Natural philosophy ===
{{main|Natural philosophy}}
[[Natural philosophy]] has its origins in [[Greece]] during the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] (650 BCE – 480 BCE), when [[Presocratics|pre-Socratic philosophers]] like [[Thales]] rejected [[Methodological naturalism|non-naturalistic]] explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.<ref name="singer2008p35">{{harvnb |Singer|2008|p=35}}</ref> They proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment;<ref name="lloyd1970pp108-109">{{harvnb |Lloyd|1970|pp=108–109}}</ref> for example, [[atomism]] was found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was proposed by [[Leucippus]] and his pupil [[Democritus]].<ref name="about-atomism">

=== Physics in the medieval European and Islamic world ===
{{main|European science in the Middle Ages|Physics in the medieval Islamic world}}
[[File:Pinhole-camera.svg|thumb|The basic way a pinhole camera works]]

The [[Western Roman Empire]] fell in the fifth century, and this resulted in a decline in intellectual pursuits in the western part of Europe. By contrast, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (also known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]) resisted the attacks from the barbarians, and continued to advance various fields of learning, including physics.{{sfn|Lindberg|1992|page=363}}

In the sixth century Isidore of Miletus created an important compilation of Archimedes' works that are copied in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]].

In sixth century Europe [[John Philoponus]], a Byzantine scholar, questioned [[Aristotle]]'s teaching of physics and noted its flaws. He introduced the [[theory of impetus]]. Aristotle's physics was not scrutinized until Philoponus appeared; unlike Aristotle, who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus relied on observation. On Aristotle's physics Philoponus wrote:<blockquote>But this is completely erroneous, and our view may be corroborated by actual observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal argument. For if you let fall from the same height two weights of which one is many times as heavy as the other, you will see that the ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend on the ratio of the weights, but that the difference in time is a very small one. And so, if the difference in the weights is not considerable, that is, of one is, let us say, double the other, there will be no difference, or else an imperceptible difference, in time, though the difference in weight is by no means negligible, with one body weighing twice as much as the other<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm | title=John Philoponus, Commentary on Aristotle's Physics | access-date=15 April 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111105753/http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm | archive-date=11 January 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration for [[Galileo Galilei]] ten centuries later,<ref name="dialogTwoNewSciences">{{cite book |last=Galileo |date=1638 |title=[[Two New Sciences]] |quote=in order to better understand just how conclusive Aristotle’s demonstration is, we may, in my opinion, deny both of his assumptions. And as to the first, I greatly doubt that Aristotle ever tested by experiment whether it be true that two stones, one weighing ten times as much as the other, if allowed to fall, at the same instant, from a height of, say, 100 cubits, would so differ in speed that when the heavier had reached the ground, the other would not have fallen more than 10 cubits.<br/>Simp. - His language would seem to indicate that he had tried the experiment, because he says: We see the heavier; now the word see shows that he had made the experiment.<br/>Sagr. - But I, Simplicio, who have made the test can assure[107] you that a cannon ball weighing one or two hundred pounds, or even more, will not reach the ground by as much as a span ahead of a musket ball weighing only half a pound, provided both are dropped from a height of 200 cubits.}}</ref> during the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Galileo cited Philoponus substantially in his works when arguing that Aristotelian physics was flawed.{{sfn|Lindberg|1992|page=162}}<ref>{{Cite book | chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/ | title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| chapter=John Philoponus| publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University| year=2018}}</ref> In the 1300s [[Jean Buridan]], a teacher in the faculty of arts at the University of Paris, developed the concept of impetus.

[[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic scholarship]] inherited [[Aristotelian physics]] from the Greeks and during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] developed it further, especially placing emphasis on observation and ''a priori'' reasoning, developing early forms of the [[scientific method]].

The most notable innovations were in the field of optics and vision, which came from the works of many scientists like [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]], [[Al-Kindi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham]], [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī|Al-Farisi]] and [[Avicenna]]. The most notable work was ''[[Book of Optics|The Book of Optics]]'' (also known as Kitāb al-Manāẓir), written by Ibn al-Haytham, in which he conclusively disproved the ancient Greek idea about vision, but also came up with a new theory. In the book, he presented a study of the phenomenon of the [[camera obscura]] (his thousand-year-old version of the [[pinhole camera]]) and delved further into the way the eye itself works. Using dissections and the knowledge of previous scholars, he was able to begin to explain how light enters the eye. He asserted that the light ray is focused, but the actual explanation of how light projected to the back of the eye had to wait until 1604. His ''Treatise on Light'' explained the camera obscura, hundreds of years before the modern development of photography.<ref>{{harvnb |Howard|Rogers|1995|pp=6–7}}</ref>

The seven-volume ''Book of Optics'' (''Kitab al-Manathir'') hugely influenced thinking across disciplines from the theory of visual [[perception]] to the nature of [[perspectivity|perspective]] in medieval art, in both the East and the West, for more than 600 years. Many later European scholars and fellow polymaths, from [[Robert Grosseteste]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] to [[René Descartes]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]], were in his debt. Indeed, the influence of Ibn al-Haytham's Optics ranks alongside that of Newton's work of the same title, published 700 years later.

The translation of ''The Book of Optics'' had a huge impact on Europe. From it, later European scholars were able to build devices that replicated those Ibn al-Haytham had built, and understand the way light works. From this, such important things as eyeglasses, magnifying glasses, telescopes, and cameras were developed.

}}</ref> The laws comprising classical physics remain very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling at non-relativistic speeds, since they provide a very close approximation in such situations, and theories such as [[quantum mechanics]] and the [[theory of relativity]] simplify to their classical equivalents at such scales. However, inaccuracies in classical mechanics for very small objects and very high velocities led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century.

[[Modern physics]] began in the early 20th century with the work of [[Max Planck]] in quantum theory and [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of relativity. Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations. [[Classical mechanics]] predicted a varying [[speed of light]], which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]] of electromagnetism; this discrepancy was corrected by Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]], which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light.<ref name="oconnorrobertson1996-relativity">{{harvnb |O'Connor|Robertson|1996a}}</ref> [[Black-body radiation]] provided another problem for classical physics, which was corrected when Planck proposed that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to their frequency; this, along with the [[photoelectric effect]] and a complete theory predicting discrete [[energy levels]] of [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]], led to the theory of quantum mechanics taking over from classical physics at very small scales.<ref name="oconnorrobertson1996-quantum">{{harvnb |O'Connor|Robertson|1996b}}</ref>

==Philosophy==
{{Main|Philosophy of physics}}
In many ways, physics stems from [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. From Thales' first attempt to characterise matter, to Democritus' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state, the [[Ptolemaic astronomy]] of a crystalline [[firmament]], and Aristotle's book ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' (an early book on physics, which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view), various Greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature. Physics was known as natural philosophy until the late 18th century.{{efn|Noll notes that some universities still use this title.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Noll |first1=Walter |title=On the Past and Future of Natural Philosophy |url=http://www.math.cmu.edu/~wn0g/noll/PFNP.pdf |journal=Journal of Elasticity |date=23 June 2006 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1007/s10659-006-9068-y |s2cid=121957320 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418072444/http://www.math.cmu.edu/~wn0g/noll/PFNP.pdf |archive-date=18 April 2016}}</ref> }}

By the 19th century, physics was realised as a discipline distinct from philosophy and the other sciences. Physics, as with the rest of science, relies on [[philosophy of science]] and its "scientific method" to advance our knowledge of the physical world.<ref name="rosenberg2006ch1">{{harvnb |Rosenberg|2006|loc=Chapter 1}}</ref> The scientific method employs ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori reasoning]]'' as well as ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' reasoning and the use of [[Bayesian inference]] to measure the validity of a given theory.<ref name="godfreysmith2003ch14">{{harvnb |Godfrey-Smith|2003|loc=Chapter 14: "Bayesianism and Modern Theories of Evidence"}}</ref>

The development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers, but has also raised new questions. Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics, the philosophy of physics, involves issues such as the nature of [[space]] and [[time]], [[determinism]], and metaphysical outlooks such as [[empiricism]], [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]].<ref name="godfreysmith2003ch15">{{harvnb |Godfrey-Smith|2003|loc=Chapter 15: "Empiricism, Naturalism, and Scientific Realism?"}}</ref>

==Core theories==
{{further|Branches of physics|Outline of physics}}
Though physics deals with a wide variety of systems, certain theories are used by all physicists. Each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature. For instance, the theory of [[Classical physics|classical]] mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than [[atom]]s and moving at much less than the speed of light. These theories continue to be areas of active research today. [[Chaos theory]], a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by Newton (1642–1727).

These central theories are important tools for research into more specialised topics, and any physicist, regardless of their specialisation, is expected to be literate in them. These include classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and [[statistical mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]], and special relativity.

===Classical physics===
{{Main|Classical physics}}

Classical physics includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognised and well-developed before the beginning of the 20th century—classical mechanics, [[acoustics]], [[optics]], thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. Classical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by [[force]]s and bodies in [[motion (physics)|motion]] and may be divided into [[statics]] (study of the forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration), [[kinematics]] (study of motion without regard to its causes), and [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]] (study of motion and the forces that affect it); mechanics may also be divided into [[solid mechanics]] and [[fluid mechanics]] (known together as [[continuum mechanics]]), the latter include such branches as [[hydrostatics]], [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamics]], [[aerodynamics]], and [[pneumatics]]. Acoustics is the study of how sound is produced, controlled, transmitted and received.<ref name="britannica-acoustics">{{cite encyclopedia |title=acoustics |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/4044/acoustics |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=14 June 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618235952/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/4044/acoustics |archive-date=18 June 2013  }}</ref>  Important modern branches of acoustics include [[ultrasonics]], the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing; [[bioacoustics]], the physics of animal calls and hearing,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bioacoustics.info/ |title=Bioacoustics – the International Journal of Animal Sound and its Recording |publisher=Taylor & Francis |access-date=31 July 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905120546/http://www.bioacoustics.info/ |archive-date=5 September 2012  }}</ref> and [[electroacoustics]], the manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Acoustical Society of America]] |title=Acoustics and You (A Career in Acoustics?) |url=http://asaweb.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904010934/http://asaweb.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 September 2015 |access-date=21 May 2013 }}</ref>

Optics, the study of [[light]], is concerned not only with [[visible light]] but also with [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet radiation]], which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light. [[Heat]] is a form of [[energy]], the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed; thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. [[Electricity]] and [[magnetism]] have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early 19th century; an [[electric current]] gives rise to a [[magnetic field]], and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current. [[Electrostatics]] deals with [[electric charge]]s at rest, [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] with moving charges, and [[magnetostatics]] with magnetic poles at rest.

===Modern physics===
{{Main|Modern physics}}
{{Modern Physics}}

Classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation, while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or very small scale. For example, [[Atomic physics|atomic]] and [[nuclear physics]] studies matter on the smallest scale at which [[chemical element]]s can be identified. The [[Particle physics|physics of elementary particles]] is on an even smaller scale since it is concerned with the most basic units of matter; this branch of physics is also known as high-energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in [[particle accelerator]]s. On this scale, ordinary, commonsensical notions of space, time, matter, and energy are no longer valid.<ref>{{harvnb |Tipler|Llewellyn|2003|pp=269, 477, 561}}</ref>

The two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space, time, and matter from that presented by classical physics. Classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous, while quantum theory is concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena. The theory of relativity is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a [[frame of reference]] that is in motion with respect to an observer; the special theory of relativity is concerned with motion in the absence of gravitational fields and the [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]] with motion and its connection with [[gravitation]]. Both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in all areas of modern physics.<ref>{{harvnb |Tipler|Llewellyn|2003|pp=1–4, 115, 185–187}}</ref>

===Difference between classical and modern physics===
[[File:Modernphysicsfields.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The basic domains of physics]]
While physics aims to discover universal laws, its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability.
[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|right|[[Solvay Conference]] of 1927, with prominent physicists such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Planck]], [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Marie Curie]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Paul Dirac]]]]

Loosely speaking, the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light. Outside of this domain, observations do not match predictions provided by classical mechanics. Einstein contributed the framework of special relativity, which replaced notions of [[absolute time and space]] with [[spacetime]] and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light. Planck, Schrödinger, and others introduced quantum mechanics, a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales. Later, [[quantum field theory]] unified quantum mechanics and special relativity. General relativity allowed for a dynamical, curved spacetime, with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described. General relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions; several candidate theories of [[quantum gravity]] are being developed.

[[File:Physics and other sciences.png|thumb|upright=0.5|left|Mathematics and ontology are used in physics. Physics is used in chemistry and cosmology.]]

===Prerequisites===
Mathematics provides a compact and exact language used to describe the order in nature. This was noted and advocated by [[Pythagoras]],<ref name="dijksterhuis1986">{{harvnb|Dijksterhuis|1986}}</ref> [[Plato]],<ref name="mastin2010-plato">{{harvnb|Mastin|2010}} "Although usually remembered today as a philosopher, Plato was also one of ancient Greece's most important patrons of mathematics. Inspired by Pythagoras, he founded his Academy in Athens in 387 BC, where he stressed mathematics as a way of understanding more about reality. In particular, he was convinced that geometry was the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe. The sign above the Academy entrance read: 'Let no-one ignorant of geometry enter here.'"</ref> Galileo,<ref name="toraldodifrancia1976p10-galileo">{{harvnb|Toraldo Di Francia|1976|p=10}} 'Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes. I mean the universe, but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word of it, and without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth.' – Galileo (1623), ''[[The Assayer]]''"</ref> and Newton.

Physics uses mathematics<ref name="applicationsofmathematics">{{cite web |url=http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/index/tour_sci.html |title=Applications of Mathematics to the Sciences |date=25 January 2000 |access-date=30 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510112012/http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/index/tour_sci.html |archive-date=2015-05-10 |url-status=dead}}</ref> to organise and formulate experimental results. From those results, [[analytic solution|precise]] or [[simulation#Computer simulation|estimated]] solutions are obtained, quantitative results from which new predictions can be made and experimentally confirmed or negated. The results from physics experiments are numerical data, with their [[units of measure]] and estimates of the errors in the measurements. Technologies based on mathematics, like [[scientific computing|computation]] have made [[computational physics]] an active area of research.

[[File:Mathematical Physics and other sciences.png|thumb|The distinction between mathematics and physics is clear-cut, but not always obvious, especially in mathematical physics.]]

[[Ontology]] is a prerequisite for physics, but not for mathematics. It means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world, while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns, even beyond the real world. Thus physics statements are synthetic, while mathematical statements are analytic. Mathematics contains hypotheses, while physics contains theories. Mathematics statements have to be only logically true, while predictions of physics statements must match observed and experimental data.

The distinction is clear-cut, but not always obvious. For example, mathematical physics is the application of mathematics in physics. Its methods are mathematical, but its subject is physical.<ref name="jmp-def">{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/journal/0022-2488_Journal_of_Mathematical_Physics | title=Journal of Mathematical Physics | access-date=31 March 2014 | quote=[Journal of Mathematical Physics] purpose is the publication of papers in mathematical physics — that is, the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories. | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818231853/http://www.researchgate.net/journal/0022-2488_Journal_of_Mathematical_Physics | archive-date=18 August 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The problems in this field start with a "[[Boundary condition|mathematical model of a physical situation]]" (system) and a "mathematical description of a physical law" that will be applied to that system. Every mathematical statement used for solving has a hard-to-find physical meaning. The final mathematical solution has an easier-to-find meaning, because it is what the solver is looking for.{{clarify|date=August 2015}}

Pure physics is a branch of [[fundamental science]] (also called ''basic'' science. Physics is also called "the fundamental science" because all branches of natural science like chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology are constrained by laws of physics.<ref name="feynmanleightonsands1963v1ch3">{{harvnb|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|1963|loc=Chapter 3: "The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences"}}; see also [[reductionism]] and [[special sciences]]</ref> Similarly, chemistry is often called [[the central science]] because of its role in linking the physical sciences. For example, chemistry studies properties, structures, and [[chemical reaction|reactions]] of matter (chemistry's focus on the molecular and atomic scale [[Difference between chemistry and physics|distinguishes it from physics]]). Structures are formed because particles exert electrical forces on each other, properties include physical characteristics of given substances, and reactions are bound by laws of physics, like [[conservation of energy]], mass, and charge. Physics is applied in industries like engineering and medicine.

===Application and influence===
{{Main|Applied physics}}

[[Applied physics]] is a general term for physics research which is intended for a particular use. An applied physics curriculum usually contains a few classes in an applied discipline, like geology or electrical engineering. It usually differs from [[engineering]] in that an applied physicist may not be designing something in particular, but rather is using physics or conducting physics research with the aim of developing new technologies or solving a problem.

The approach is similar to that of [[applied mathematics]]. Applied physicists use physics in scientific research. For instance, people working on [[accelerator physics]] might seek to build better [[particle detector]]s for research in theoretical physics.

Physics is used heavily in engineering. For example, statics, a subfield of [[mechanics]], is used in the building of [[bridge]]s and other static structures. The understanding and use of acoustics results in sound control and better concert halls; similarly, the use of optics creates better optical devices. An understanding of physics makes for more realistic [[flight simulator]]s, [[video game]]s, and movies, and is often critical in [[forensic]] investigations.

With the [[Uniformitarianism (science)|standard consensus]] that the [[Scientific law|laws]] of physics are universal and do not change with time, physics can be used to study things that would ordinarily be mired in [[uncertainty]]. For example, in the [[History of Earth#Origin of the Earth's core and first atmosphere|study of the origin of the earth]], one can reasonably model earth's mass, temperature, and rate of rotation, as a function of time allowing one to extrapolate forward or backward in time and so predict future or prior events. It also allows for simulations in engineering that drastically speed up the development of a new technology.

But there is also considerable [[interdisciplinarity]], so many other important fields are influenced by physics (e.g., the fields of [[econophysics]] and [[sociophysics]]).

==Research==

===Scientific method===
Physicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a [[physical theory]]. By using a methodical approach to compare the implications of a theory with the conclusions drawn from its related [[experiment]]s and observations, physicists are better able to test the validity of a theory in a logical, unbiased, and repeatable way. To that end, experiments are performed and observations are made in order to determine the validity or invalidity of the theory.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=G. |last2=Silk |first2=J. |title=Scientific method: Defend the integrity of physics |journal=Nature |date=16 December 2014 |volume=516 |issue=7531 |pages=321–323 |doi=10.1038/516321a |bibcode=2014Natur.516..321E |pmid=25519115  |doi-access=free }}</ref>

A scientific law is a concise verbal or mathematical statement of a relation that expresses a fundamental principle of some theory, such as Newton's law of universal gravitation.<ref name="honderich1995pp474-476">{{harvnb |Honderich|1995|pp=474–476}}</ref>

===Theory and experiment===
{{Main|Theoretical physics|Experimental physics}}
[[File:Bruce McCandless II during EVA in 1984.jpg|thumb|right|The [[astronaut]] and [[Earth]] are both in [[free fall]].]]
[[File:Lightning in Arlington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lightning]] is an [[electric current]].]]

Theorists seek to develop [[mathematical model]]s that both agree with existing experiments and successfully predict future experimental results, while [[Experimentalism|experimentalists]] devise and perform experiments to test theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Although [[theory]] and experiment are developed separately, they strongly affect and depend upon each other. Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimental results defy explanation by existing theories, prompting intense focus on applicable modelling, and when new theories generate experimentally testable [[prediction]]s, which inspire the development of new experiments (and often related equipment).<ref>{{cite web |date=June 2015 |title=Has theoretical physics moved too far away from experiments? Is the field entering a crisis and, if so, what should we do about it? |url=https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/research/conferences/convergence/roundtable-discussion-questions/has-theoretical-physics-moved-too |publisher=[[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421064320/http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/research/conferences/convergence/roundtable-discussion-questions/has-theoretical-physics-moved-too |archive-date=21 April 2016 }}</ref>

[[Physicist]]s who work at the interplay of theory and experiment are called [[Phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenologists]], who study complex phenomena observed in experiment and work to relate them to a [[Theory of everything|fundamental theory]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Phenomenology |url=https://www.mpp.mpg.de/english/research/theory/phenomenologie/index.html |publisher=[[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] |access-date=22 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307105406/https://www.mpp.mpg.de/english/research/theory/phenomenologie/index.html |archive-date=7 March 2016 }}</ref>

Theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy; electromagnetism was unified this way.{{efn|See, for example, the influence of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter|Ritter]] on [[Hans Christian Ørsted|Ørsted]].}} Beyond the known universe, the field of theoretical physics also deals with hypothetical issues,{{efn|Concepts which are denoted ''hypothetical'' can change with time. For example, the [[atom]] of nineteenth-century physics was denigrated by some, including [[Ernst Mach]]'s critique of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s formulation of [[statistical mechanics]]. By the end of World War II, the atom was no longer deemed hypothetical.}} such as [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universes]], a [[multiverse]], and [[higher dimension]]s. Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving particular problems with existing theories; they then explore the consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.

Experimental physics expands, and is expanded by, engineering and [[technology]]. Experimental physicists who are involved in [[basic research]], design and perform experiments with equipment such as particle accelerators and [[laser]]s, whereas those involved in [[applied research]] often work in industry, developing technologies such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[transistor]]s. [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] has noted that experimentalists may seek areas that have not been explored well by theorists.<ref name="feynman1965p157-experiment">{{harvnb|Feynman|1965|p=157}} "In fact experimenters have a certain individual character. They ... very often do their experiments in a region in which people know the theorist has not made any guesses."</ref>

===Scope and aims===
[[File:Acceleration components.JPG|thumb|left|Physics involves modeling the natural world with theory, usually quantitative. Here, the path of a particle is modeled with the mathematics of [[calculus]] to explain its behavior: the purview of the branch of physics known as [[mechanics]].]]

Physics covers a wide range of [[phenomenon|phenomena]], from [[elementary particle]]s (such as quarks, neutrinos, and electrons) to the largest [[supercluster]]s of galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. Therefore, physics is sometimes called the "fundamental science".<ref name="feynmanleightonsands1963v1ch3" /> Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to [[root cause]]s, and then connect these causes together.

For example, the [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] observed that certain rocks ([[lodestone]] and [[magnetite]]) were attracted to one another by an invisible force. This effect was later called magnetism, which was first rigorously studied in the 17th century. But even before the Chinese discovered magnetism, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] knew of other objects such as [[amber]], that when rubbed with fur would cause a similar invisible attraction between the two.<ref name=stewart>{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=J. |year=2001 |title=Intermediate Electromagnetic Theory |page=50 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-02-4471-2}}</ref> This was also first studied rigorously in the 17th century and came to be called electricity. Thus, physics had come to understand two observations of nature in terms of some root cause (electricity and magnetism). However, further work in the 19th century revealed that these two forces were just two different aspects of one force—electromagnetism. This process of "unifying" forces continues today, and electromagnetism and the [[weak nuclear force]] are now considered to be two aspects of the [[electroweak interaction]]. Physics hopes to find an ultimate reason (theory of everything) for why nature is as it is (see section ''[[#Current research|Current research]]'' below for more information).<ref>{{cite book |last=Weinberg |first=S. |year=1993 |title=Dreams of a Final Theory: The Search for the Fundamental Laws of Nature |publisher=Hutchinson Radius |isbn=978-0-09-177395-3}}</ref>

===Research fields===
Contemporary research in physics can be broadly divided into nuclear and particle physics; [[condensed matter physics]]; [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]; [[astrophysics]]; and applied physics. Some physics departments also support [[physics education research]] and [[physics outreach]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Redish |first=E. |title=Science and Physics Education Homepages |url=http://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/homepages.htm |publisher=University of Maryland Physics Education Research Group |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728005227/http://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/homepages.htm |archive-date=28 July 2016  }}</ref>

Since the 20th century, the individual fields of physics have become increasingly specialised, and today most physicists work in a single field for their entire careers. "Universalists" such as Einstein (1879–1955) and [[Lev Landau]] (1908–1968), who worked in multiple fields of physics, are now very rare.{{efn|Yet, universalism is encouraged in the culture of physics. For example, the [[World Wide Web]], which was innovated at [[CERN]] by [[Tim Berners-Lee]], was created in service to the computer infrastructure of CERN, and was/is intended for use by physicists worldwide. The same might be said for [[arXiv.org]]}}

The major fields of physics, along with their subfields and the theories and concepts they employ, are shown in the following table.

Nuclear physics is the field of physics that studies the constituents and interactions of [[atomic nuclei]]. The most commonly known applications of nuclear physics are [[nuclear power]] generation and [[nuclear weapons]] technology, but the research has provided application in many fields, including those in [[nuclear medicine]] and magnetic resonance imaging, [[ion implantation]] in [[materials engineering]], and [[radiocarbon dating]] in [[geology]] and [[archaeology]].

====Atomic, molecular, and optical physics====
{{Main|Atomic, molecular, and optical physics}}

Atomic, [[Molecule|molecular]], and optical physics (AMO) is the study of matter–matter and light–matter interactions on the scale of single atoms and molecules. The three areas are grouped together because of their interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality of their relevant energy scales. All three areas include both classical, semi-classical and [[quantum physics|quantum]] treatments; they can treat their subject from a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).

Atomic physics studies the [[electron shell]]s of atoms. Current research focuses on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms and ions,<ref>{{cite web |title=Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics |website=MIT Department of Physics |url=http://web.mit.edu/physics/research/abcp/areas.html#amo |access-date=21 February 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140227043906/http://web.mit.edu/physics/research/abcp/areas.html#amo |archive-date=27 February 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Korea University, Physics AMO Group |url=http://physics.korea.ac.kr/research/research_amo.php |access-date=21 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301112653/http://physics.korea.ac.kr/research/research_amo.php |archive-date=1 March 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Aarhus Universitet, AMO Group |url=http://phys.au.dk/forskning/forskningsomraader/amo/ |access-date=21 February 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307062146/http://phys.au.dk/forskning/forskningsomraader/amo/ |archive-date=7 March 2014  }}</ref> low-temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron correlation on structure and dynamics. Atomic physics is influenced by the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (see [[hyperfine splitting]]), but intra-nuclear phenomena such as [[nuclear fission|fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] are considered part of nuclear physics.

[[Molecular physics]] focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal and external interactions with matter and light. [[Optical physics]] is distinct from optics in that it tends to focus not on the control of classical light fields by macroscopic objects but on the fundamental properties of [[optical field]]s and their interactions with matter in the microscopic realm.

====Condensed matter physics====
{{Main|Condensed matter physics}}
[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|right|thumb|upright=1.25|Velocity-distribution data of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms, confirming the discovery of a new phase of matter, the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]]]

====Astrophysics====
{{Main|Astrophysics|Physical cosmology}}
[[File:Hubble ultra deep field high rez edit1.jpg|thumb|left|The deepest visible-light image of the [[universe]], the [[Hubble Ultra-Deep Field]]]]

Astrophysics and astronomy are the application of the theories and methods of physics to the study of [[stellar structure]], [[stellar evolution]], the origin of the Solar System, and related problems of [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Because astrophysics is a broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://manoa.hawaii.edu/astronomy/bs-in-astrophysics/ |title=BS in Astrophysics |publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa |access-date=14 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404195943/http://manoa.hawaii.edu/astronomy/bs-in-astrophysics/ |archive-date=4 April 2016 }}</ref>

The discovery by [[Karl Jansky]] in 1931 that radio signals were emitted by celestial bodies initiated the science of [[radio astronomy]]. Most recently, the frontiers of astronomy have been expanded by space exploration. Perturbations and interference from the earth's atmosphere make space-based observations necessary for [[infrared astronomy|infrared]], [[ultraviolet astronomy|ultraviolet]], [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray]], and [[X-ray astronomy]].

Physical cosmology is the study of the formation and evolution of the universe on its largest scales. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity plays a central role in all modern cosmological theories. In the early 20th century, [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]]'s discovery that the universe is expanding, as shown by the [[Hubble diagram]], prompted rival explanations known as the [[steady-state model|steady state]] universe and the [[Big Bang]].

The Big Bang was confirmed by the success of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] in 1964. The Big Bang model rests on two theoretical pillars: Albert Einstein's general relativity and the [[cosmological principle]]. Cosmologists have recently established the [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM model]] of the evolution of the universe, which includes [[cosmic inflation]], [[dark energy]], and [[dark matter]].

Research in physics is continually progressing on a large number of fronts.

In condensed matter physics, an important unsolved theoretical problem is that of [[high-temperature superconductivity]].<ref name=Legg2006>{{cite journal |last1=Leggett |first1=A.J. |year=2006 |title=What DO we know about high ''T''<sub>c</sub>? |url=http://leopard.physics.ucdavis.edu/rts/p242/nphys254.pdf |journal=[[Nature Physics]] |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=134–136 |bibcode=2006NatPh...2..134L |doi=10.1038/nphys254 |s2cid=122055331 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610183622/http://leopard.physics.ucdavis.edu/rts/p242/nphys254.pdf |archive-date=10 June 2010  }}</ref> Many condensed matter experiments are aiming to fabricate workable [[spintronics]] and [[quantum computer]]s.<ref name=cohen2008/><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wolf |first1=S.A. |last2=Chtchelkanova |first2=A.Y. |last3=Treger |first3=D.M. |title=Spintronics—A retrospective and perspective |journal=[[IBM Journal of Research and Development]] |volume=50 |pages=101–110 |year=2006 |doi=10.1147/rd.501.0101|s2cid=41178069 |url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/10b1/d4e488fabf429cb0630d96687548aa14158f.pdf }}</ref>

In particle physics, the first pieces of experimental evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model have begun to appear. Foremost among these are indications that [[neutrino]]s have non-zero [[mass]]. These experimental results appear to have solved the long-standing [[solar neutrino problem]], and the physics of massive neutrinos remains an area of active theoretical and experimental research. The Large Hadron Collider has already found the Higgs boson, but future research aims to prove or disprove the supersymmetry, which extends the Standard Model of particle physics. Research on the nature of the major mysteries of dark matter and dark energy is also currently ongoing.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gibney |first1=E. |year=2015 |title=LHC 2.0: A new view of the Universe |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=519 |issue=7542 |pages=142–143 |doi=10.1038/519142a |bibcode=2015Natur.519..142G |pmid=25762263  |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Theoretical attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity into a single theory of quantum gravity, a program ongoing for over half a century, have not yet been decisively resolved. The current leading candidates are [[M-theory]], [[superstring theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]].

Many [[astronomical]] and cosmological phenomena have yet to be satisfactorily explained, including the origin of [[GZK paradox|ultra-high-energy cosmic rays]], the [[baryon asymmetry]], the [[accelerating expansion of the universe]] and the [[galaxy rotation problem|anomalous rotation rates of galaxies]].

Although much progress has been made in high-energy, [[quantum]], and astronomical physics, many everyday phenomena involving [[complex system|complexity]],<ref name="nrc1997v9p161">{{harvnb|National Research Council|Committee on Technology for Future Naval Forces|1997|p=161}}</ref> chaos,<ref name="kellert1993p32">{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=32}}</ref> or [[turbulence]]<ref name="eames-quoting-feynman">{{cite journal |last1=Eames |first1=I. |last2=Flor |first2=J.B. |year=2011 |title=New developments in understanding interfacial processes in turbulent flows |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] |volume=369 |issue=1937 |pages=702–705 |bibcode=2011RSPTA.369..702E |doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0332 |pmid=21242127 |quote=Richard Feynman said that 'Turbulence is the most important unsolved problem of classical physics'  |doi-access=free }}</ref> are still poorly understood. Complex problems that seem like they could be solved by a clever application of dynamics and mechanics remain unsolved; examples include the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling water, the shape of water droplets, mechanisms of [[surface tension]] [[catastrophe theory|catastrophes]], and self-sorting in shaken heterogeneous collections.{{efn |See the work of [[Ilya Prigogine]], on 'systems far from equilibrium', and others.}}<ref>{{Cite book |author1=National Research Council |chapter=What happens far from equilibrium and why |chapter-url= https://www.nap.edu/read/11967/chapter/7 |title=Condensed-Matter and Materials Physics: the science of the world around us |year=2007 |pages=91–110 |doi=10.17226/11967 |isbn=978-0-309-10969-7 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161104001321/https://www.nap.edu/read/11967/chapter/7 |archive-date=4 November 2016}}<br/>– {{cite arxiv |last1=Jaeger |first1=Heinrich M. |last2=Liu |first2=Andrea J. |year=2010 |title=Far-From-Equilibrium Physics: An Overview |class=cond-mat.soft |eprint=1009.4874}}</ref>

These complex phenomena have received growing attention since the 1970s for several reasons, including the availability of modern mathematical methods and computers, which enabled complex systems to be modeled in new ways. Complex physics has become part of increasingly [[interdisciplinary]] research, as exemplified by the study of turbulence in aerodynamics and the observation of [[pattern formation]] in biological systems. In the 1932 ''Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics'', [[Horace Lamb]] said:<ref name="goldstein1969">{{harvnb|Goldstein|1969}}</ref>
{{bquote|I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather optimistic.}}
