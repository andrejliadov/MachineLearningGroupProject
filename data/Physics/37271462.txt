The '''Einstein Prize for Laser Science''' was a recognition awarded by the former Society for Optical and Quantum Electronics and sponsored by the [[Eastman Kodak Company]].<ref>{{cite book| editor-first1=R.

C.| last=Sze}}</ref>  The prize, awarded in the 1988–1999 period, consisted of a 3-inch brass medal including [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] image and a depiction of a two-level transition including the [[Atomic spectral line|A and B coefficients]].  Recipients of the prize include:

* [[Serge Haroche]], 1988 
* [[Herbert Walther]], 1988  
* [[H. Jeff Kimble]], 1989
* [[Richart E. Slusher]], 1989
* [[Carlton M. Caves]], 1990
* [[Daniel Frank Walls]], 1990
* [[S. E. Harris]], 1991 
* [[L. M. Narducci]], 1991
* [[John L. Hall]], 1992 
* [[Willis E. Lamb]], 1992
* [[Raymond Chiao]], 1993 
* [[Norman F. Ramsey]], 1993
* [[Girish Saran Agarwal|G. S. Agarwal]], 1994
* [[Theodor W. Hänsch]], 1995 
* [[Carl E. Wieman]], 1995
* [[David J. Wineland]], 1996
* [[Peter Knight (scientist)|Peter L. Knight]], 1996
* [[Paul Corkum]], 1999

In retrospect, the prize was mainly awarded for significant contributions in [[quantum optics]].  Two recipients of the '''Einstein Prize for Laser Science''' were already [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureates in physics]] (W. E. Lamb and N. F. Ramsey) and five other recipients went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics (S. Haroche, J. L. Hall, T. W. Hänsch, C. E. Wieman, and D. J. Wineland).  Presentation of the prize was done at the ''Lasers'88'' to ''Lasers'99'' conferences. 

Note: the official name of these conferences was [[The International Conference on Lasers and Applications, Lasers 'XX]].
