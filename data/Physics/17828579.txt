An '''acoustic board''' is a special kind of board made of sound absorbing materials. Its job is to provide sound insulation.<ref name="isbn0-419-22280-4">{{cite book |title=Dictionary of architectural and building technology |edition= |language= |publisher=E & F N Spon |location=London |year=1998 |origyear= |pages= 3|quote= |isbn=0-419-22280-4 |oclc= |doi= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Jgm6J9UOB3MC&q=%22acoustic+board%22&pg=PA3|accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="isbn1-4051-1254-9">{{cite book |author1=Derek Butterfield |author2=Alf Fulcher |author3=Rhodes, Brian |author4=Stewart, Bill |author5=Derick Tickle |author6=Windsor, John C. |title=Painting and Decorating: An Information Manual |edition= |language= |publisher=Blackwell/Futura |location= |year=2005 |origyear= |pages= 145|quote= |isbn=1-4051-1254-9 |oclc= |doi= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DyHKWxQD0NQC&q=%22acoustic+board%22&pg=PA145|accessdate=}}</ref> Between two outer walls sound absorbing material is inserted and the wall is [[porous]]. Thus, when sound passes through an acoustic board, the intensity of sound is decreased. The loss of sound energy is balanced by producing heat energy.

==Uses==
They are used in [[auditoriums]], [[hall]]s, [[seminar rooms]], [[libraries]], [[courts]] and wherever sound insulation is needed. Acoustic boards are also used in speaker boxes.
