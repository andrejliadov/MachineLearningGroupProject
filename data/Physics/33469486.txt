'''''BCS: 50 Years''''' is a review volume edited by [[Leon Cooper]], a 1972 [[Nobel Prize for Physics|Nobel Laureate in Physics]], and Dmitri Feldman of [[Brown University]], first published in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=BCS: 50 Years [eBook]|url=http://ebooks.worldscinet.com/ISBN/9789814304665/9789814304665.shtml |work=ebooks.worldscinet.com|accessdate=20 October 2011}}</ref>

The book consists of 23 articles written by outstanding [[physicist]]s, including many Nobel prize-winners, and presents the complete theory of [[superconductivity]] - a phenomenon where the electrical resistance of some metallic materials suddenly vanish at temperatures near [[absolute zero]].

==Background==

Sixty years ago, in 1957, [[John Bardeen]], [[Leon Cooper]] and [[John Robert Schrieffer]] finally pieced together the puzzle of superconductivity, explaining in detail its mechanism and the associated effects.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Bardeen | first1=J. | last2=Cooper | first2=L.
