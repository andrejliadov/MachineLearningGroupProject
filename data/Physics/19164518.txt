The '''Health Physics Society''' (HPS) is a nonprofit scientific professional organization whose mission is excellence in the science and practice of [[radiation safety]].  It is based in the [[United States]] and the specific purposes of the society's activities include encouraging research in [[radiation]] science, developing standards, and disseminating radiation safety information. Society members are involved in understanding, evaluating, and controlling potential risks from radiation relative to the benefits.

The Society was formed in 1955, with an organizational meeting in June, 1955 at [[Ohio State University]] [[Columbus, Ohio]]. As of 2013, the membership consists of approximately 5,500 scientists, physicians, engineers,  and other professionals. The headquarters are  in [[McLean, VA]]. The society is an affiliate of the [[American Institute of Physics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aip.org/member-societies |title=Member Societies |date=4 March 2013 |website=www.aip.org}}</ref>

== Activities ==
It publishes ''[[Health Physics (journal)|Health Physics]]'' since 1958, a [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]]; ''Health Physics News'' for material of interest to members,  and ''Operational Radiation Safety''. It operates a public information website, "Radiation Answers", and has begun a series of special publications (The first, ''Radiation and Risk: Expert Perspectives'' was published in March 2012.)<ref name="SP001">{{cite book |author=Joxel Garcia |author-link=Joxel Garcia |author2=Howard Dickson |author3=Richard Vetter |author4=Louis Wagner |author5=Kathryn Higley |author6=Bernard Cohen |author6-link=Bernard Cohen (physicist) |author7=Robert Peter Gale |author7-link=Robert Peter Gale |author8=Robert Emery |title=Radiation and Risk: Expert Perspectives (SP001 - 0)|url=http://hps.org/documents/radiation_and_risk.pdf |accessdate=1 September 2013 |year=2013 |publisher=Health Physics Society |page=60}}</ref>

It holds its annual meeting in July, and a mid-year meeting in January or February.<ref name=amh/>

The society's archives are held at the [[University of Tennessee, Knoxville]].<ref name="amh"/>

==Organization==

The society has 37 geographically based chapters, all in the United States, except for one chapter in the [[Georgian Republic]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ghpa.webs.com/ |title=Georgian Health Physics Association |website=Georgian Health Physics Association}}</ref> and one in Taiwan; there are 8 Sections on special interests.<ref name="amh"/>

==History==
A new national scientific organization for [[health physicist]]s was founded at a 3-day health physics conference at [[Ohio State University]] on 14 June 1955.<ref>{{cite journal |title=News of Science |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=15 July 1955 |volume=122 |issue=15 July 1955 |pages=112 |doi=10.1126/science.122.3159.112 |pmid=17751437 |bibcode=1955Sci...122..112W}}</ref> The organization was temporarily named "Health Physics Society", and [[Karl Z. Morgan]] of the Health Physics Division of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] was elected interim president. Other interim officers were [[Frederick P. Cowan]] (vice president) and [[Elda E. Anderson]] (secretary-treasurer).
