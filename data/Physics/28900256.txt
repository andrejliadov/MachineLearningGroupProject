'''Mean inter-particle distance''' (or mean inter-particle separation) is the mean distance between microscopic particles (usually [[atoms]] or [[molecules]]) in a macroscopic body.

==Ambiguity==

From the very general considerations, the mean inter-particle distance is proportional to the size of the per-particle volume <math>1/n</math>, i.e., 
: <math>\langle r \rangle \sim 1/n^{1/3},</math>
where <math>n = N/V</math> is the [[particle density (particle count)|particle density]]. However, barring a few simple cases such as the [[ideal gas]] model, precise calculations of the proportionality factor are impossible analytically. Therefore, approximate expressions are often used. One such an estimation is the [[Wigner-Seitz radius]]
: <math>\left( \frac{3}{4 \pi n} \right)^{1/3},</math>
which corresponds to the radius of a sphere having per-particle volume <math>1/n</math>. Another popular definition is
: <math>1/n^{1/3}</math>,
corresponding to the length of the edge of the cube with the per-particle volume <math>1/n</math>. The two definitions differ by a factor of approximately <math>1.61</math>, so one has to exercise care if an article fails to define the parameter exactly. On the other hand, it is often used in qualitative statements where such a numeric factor is either irrelevant or plays an insignificant role, e.g.,

* "a potential energy ... is proportional to some power n of the inter-particle distance r" ([[Virial theorem]])
* "the inter-particle distance is much larger than the thermal de Broglie wavelength" ([[Kinetic theory of gases|Kinetic theory]])

We want to calculate [[probability distribution function]] of distance to the nearest neighbor (NN) particle. (The problem was first considered by [[Paul Hertz]];<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref>) Let us assume <math>N</math> particles inside a sphere having volume <math>V</math>, so that <math>n = N/V</math>. Note that since the particles in the ideal gas are non-interacting, the probability to find a particle at a certain distance from another particle is the same as probability to find a particle at the same distance from any other point; we shall use the center of the sphere.

An NN particle at distance <math>r</math> means exactly one of the <math>N</math> particles resides at that distance while the rest 
<math>N - 1</math> particles are at larger distances, i.e., they are somewhere outside the sphere with radius <math>r</math>.

The probability to find a particle at the distance from the origin between <math>r</math> and <math>r + dr</math> is
<math>(4 \pi r^2/V) dr</math>, plus we have <math>N</math> kinds of way to choose which particle , while the probability to find a particle outside that sphere is <math>1 - 4\pi r^3/3V</math>. The sought-for expression is then

:<math>P_N(r)dr = 4 \pi r^2 dr\frac{N}{V}\left(1 - \frac{4\pi}{3}r^3/V \right)^{N - 1} =
                \frac{3}{ a}\left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^2 dr \left(1 - \left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^3 \frac{1}{N} \right)^{N - 1}\, </math>
where we substituted
: <math>\frac{1}{V} = \frac{3}{4 \pi N a^{3}}.</math>
Note that <math>a</math> is the [[Wigner-Seitz radius]]. Finally, taking the <math>N \rightarrow \infty</math> limit and using <math>\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}\left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^x = e</math>, we obtain
:<math>P(r) = \frac{3}{a}\left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^2 e^{-(r/a)^3}\,.</math>

One can immediately check that
:<math>\int_{0}^{\infty}P(r)dr = 1\,.</math>

The distribution peaks at 
:<math>r_{\text{peak}} = \left(2/3\right)^{1/3} a \approx 0.874 a\,.</math>

===Mean distance and higher NN distribution moments===

:<math> \langle r^k \rangle = \int_{0}^{\infty}P(r) r^k dr = 3 a^k\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{k+2}e^{-x^3}dx\,,</math>
or, using the <math>t = x^3</math> substitution,
:<math> \langle r^k \rangle = a^k \int_{0}^{\infty}t^{k/3}e^{-t}dt = a^k \Gamma(1 + \frac{k}{3})\,,</math>
where <math>\Gamma</math> is the [[gamma function]]. Thus,

:<math> \langle r^k \rangle = a^k \Gamma(1 + \frac{k}{3})\,.</math>

In particular,
:<math> \langle r \rangle = a \Gamma(\frac{4}{3}) = \frac{a}{3} \Gamma(\frac{1}{3}) \approx 0.893 a\,.</math>
