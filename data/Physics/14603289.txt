This is a project which aims at building a new 4pi [[particle detector]] for [[charged particles]]. It will operate in the domain of heavy-ion induced reactions around the [[Fermi energy]]. It groups together more than 10 institutions worldwide in [[Nuclear Physics]]. It is planned to work in 2013-2014, coincidentally to the advent of new high intensity [[particle accelerators]] for radioactive nuclear beams. A large effort on research and development is currently made, especially on [[digital electronics]] and [[pulse shape analysis]], in order to improve the detection capabilities of such [[particle detector]]s in different domains, such as charge and mass identification, lower energy thresholds, as well as improved energetic and [[angular resolution]]s.
