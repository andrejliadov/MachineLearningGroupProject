==Development and acceptance==
{{Main|History of special relativity|History of general relativity}}
[[Albert Einstein]] published the theory of [[special relativity]] in 1905, building on many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained by [[Albert A. Michelson]], [[Hendrik Lorentz]], [[Henri Poincaré]] and others. [[Max Planck]], [[Hermann Minkowski]] and others did subsequent work.

Einstein developed [[general relativity]] between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915. The final form of general relativity was published in 1916.<ref name=relativity/>

The term "theory of relativity" was based on the expression "relative theory" ({{lang-de|Relativtheorie}}) used in 1906 by Planck, who emphasized how the theory uses the [[principle of relativity]]. In the discussion section of the same paper, [[Alfred Bucherer]] used for the first time the expression "theory of relativity" ({{lang-de|Relativitätstheorie}}).<ref>{{Citation|author=Planck, Max|date=1906 |title=Die Kaufmannschen Messungen der Ablenkbarkeit der β-Strahlen in ihrer Bedeutung für die Dynamik der Elektronen (The Measurements of Kaufmann on the Deflectability of β-Rays in their Importance for the Dynamics of the Electrons)|journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift|volume=7 |pages=753–761|title-link=s:Translation:The Measurements of Kaufmann }}</ref><ref>{{Citation|author=Miller, Arthur I.|date=1981|title=Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity.

By comparison, general relativity did not appear to be as useful, beyond making minor corrections to predictions of Newtonian gravitation theory.<ref name=relativity/> It seemed to offer little potential for experimental test, as most of its assertions were on an astronomical scale. Its [[tensor analysis|mathematics]] seemed difficult and fully understandable only by a small number of people. Around 1960, general relativity became central to physics and astronomy. New mathematical techniques to apply to general relativity streamlined calculations and made its concepts more easily visualized. As astronomical [[phenomena]] were discovered, such as [[quasars]] (1963), the 3-kelvin [[microwave background radiation]] (1965), [[pulsar]]s (1967), and the first [[black hole]] candidates (1981),<ref name=relativity/> the theory explained their attributes, and measurement of them further confirmed the theory.

==Special relativity==
{{Main|Special relativity}}

Special relativity is a theory of the structure of [[spacetime]]. It was introduced in Einstein's 1905 paper "[[On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]]" (for the contributions of many other physicists see [[History of special relativity]]). Special relativity is based on two postulates which are contradictory in [[classical mechanics]]:
# The laws of [[physics]] are the same for all observers in any [[inertial frame of reference]] relative to one another ([[principle of relativity]]).
# The [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or of the motion of the [[light]] source.

The resultant theory copes with experiment better than classical mechanics. For instance, postulate 2 explains the results of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]]. Moreover, the theory has many surprising and counterintuitive consequences. Some of these are:
* [[Relativity of simultaneity]]: Two events, simultaneous for one observer, may not be simultaneous for another observer if the observers are in relative motion.
* [[Time dilation]]: Moving [[clock]]s are measured to tick more slowly than an observer's "stationary" clock.
* [[Length contraction]]: Objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.
* [[Speed of light#Upper limit on speeds|Maximum speed is finite]]: No physical object, message or field line can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum.
** The effect of Gravity can only travel through space at the speed of light, not faster or instantaneously.
* [[Mass–energy equivalence]]: {{nowrap|''E'' {{=}} ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}, energy and mass are equivalent and transmutable.
* [[Mass in special relativity|Relativistic mass]], idea used by some researchers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = The Theory of Relativity, Then and Now|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/theory-of-relativity-then-and-now-180956622/?no-ist|accessdate = 2015-09-26|first = Brian|last = Greene}}</ref>

The defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the [[Galilean transformation]]s of classical mechanics by the [[Lorentz transformation]]s. (See [[Maxwell's equations]] of [[electromagnetism]]).

==General relativity==
{{Main|General relativity|Introduction to general relativity}}
General relativity is a theory of gravitation developed by Einstein in the years 1907–1915. The development of general relativity began with the [[equivalence principle]], under which the states of [[accelerated motion]] and being at rest in a [[gravity|gravitational field]] (for example, when standing on the surface of the Earth) are physically identical. The upshot of this is that [[free fall]] is [[inertia|inertial motion]]: an object in free fall is falling because that is how objects move when there is no [[force]] being exerted on them, instead of this being due to the force of [[gravity]] as is the case in [[classical mechanics]]. This is incompatible with classical mechanics and [[special relativity]] because in those theories inertially moving objects cannot accelerate with respect to each other, but objects in free fall do so. To resolve this difficulty Einstein first proposed that spacetime is [[curvature|curved]]. In 1915, he devised the [[Einstein field equations]] which relate the curvature of spacetime with the mass, energy, and any momentum within it.

Some of the consequences of general relativity are:
*[[Gravitational time dilation]]: Clocks run slower in deeper gravitational wells.<ref>{{cite book

* [[precession#Relativistic (Einsteinian)|Precession]]: Orbits precess in a way unexpected in Newton's theory of gravity. (This has been observed in the orbit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and in [[binary pulsar]]s).
* [[General relativity#Light deflection and gravitational time delay|Light deflection]]: Rays of [[light]] bend in the presence of a gravitational field.
* [[Frame-dragging]]: Rotating masses "drag along" the [[spacetime]] around them.
* [[Metric expansion of space]]: the universe is expanding, and the far parts of it are moving away from us [[Faster-than-light#Universal expansion|faster than the speed of light]].

Technically, general relativity is a theory of [[gravitation]] whose defining feature is its use of the [[Einstein field equations]]. The solutions of the field equations are [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensors]] which define the [[topology]] of the spacetime and how objects move inertially.

==Experimental evidence==
Einstein stated that the theory of relativity belongs to a class of "principle-theories". As such, it employs an analytic method, which means that the elements of this theory are not based on hypothesis but on empirical discovery. By observing natural processes, we understand their general characteristics, devise mathematical models to describe what we observed, and by analytical means we deduce the necessary conditions that have to be satisfied. Measurement of separate events must satisfy these conditions and match the theory's conclusions.<ref name=londontimes>{{Cite news

=== Tests of special relativity ===
{{Main|Tests of special relativity}}

Relativity is a [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] theory: It makes predictions that can be tested by experiment. In the case of special relativity, these include the principle of relativity, the constancy of the speed of light, and time dilation.<ref name=faq>{{Cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=T |last2=Schleif |first2=S |last3=Dlugosz |first3=JM (ed.) |date=2007 |title=What is the experimental basis of Special Relativity? |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/experiments.html |work=Usenet Physics FAQ |publisher=[[University of California, Riverside]] |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref> The predictions of special relativity have been confirmed in numerous tests since Einstein published his paper in 1905, but three experiments conducted between 1881 and 1938 were critical to its validation. These are the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], the [[Kennedy–Thorndike experiment]], and the [[Ives–Stilwell experiment]]. Einstein derived the [[Lorentz transformation]]s from first principles in 1905, but these three experiments allow the transformations to be induced from experimental evidence.

[[Maxwell's equations]]—the foundation of classical electromagnetism—describe light as a wave that moves with a characteristic velocity. The modern view is that light needs no medium of transmission, but Maxwell and his contemporaries were convinced that light waves were propagated in a medium, analogous to sound propagating in air, and ripples propagating on the surface of a pond. This hypothetical medium was called the [[luminiferous aether]], at rest relative to the "fixed stars" and through which the Earth moves. Fresnel's [[Aether drag hypothesis#Partial aether dragging|partial ether dragging hypothesis]] ruled out the measurement of first-order (v/c) effects, and although observations of second-order effects (v<sup>2</sup>/c<sup>2</sup>) were possible in principle, Maxwell thought they were too small to be detected with then-current technology.<ref name=maxb>{{Citation|last=Maxwell|first=James Clerk|date=1880|title=On a Possible Mode of Detecting a Motion of the Solar System through the Luminiferous Ether|journal=Nature|volume=21|issue=535|pages=314–315|doi=10.1038/021314c0 |bibcode = 1880Natur..21S.314. |title-link=s:Motion of the Solar System through the Luminiferous Ether|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="Pais 1982 111–113">{{cite book|last=Pais|first=Abraham|title="Subtle is the Lord ...": The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein|url=https://archive.org/details/subtleislordscie00pais|url-access=registration|date=1982|publisher=Oxford Univ.

The Michelson–Morley experiment was designed to detect second-order effects of the "aether wind"—the motion of the aether relative to the earth. Michelson designed an instrument called the [[Michelson interferometer]] to accomplish this. The apparatus was more than accurate enough to detect the expected effects, but he obtained a null result when the first experiment was conducted in 1881,<ref name=michel1>{{Cite journal |author = Michelson, Albert A. |title = The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether |journal = American Journal of Science |volume = 22 |issue = 128 |date = 1881 |pages = 120–129 |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-22.128.120|title-link = s:The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether |bibcode = 1881AmJS...22..120M |s2cid = 130423116 }}</ref> and again in 1887.<ref name=michel2>{{Cite journal |author=[[Albert A.

While the Michelson–Morley experiment showed that the velocity of light is isotropic, it said nothing about how the magnitude of the velocity changed (if at all) in different [[inertial frame]]s. The Kennedy–Thorndike experiment was designed to do that, and was first performed in 1932 by Roy Kennedy and Edward Thorndike.<ref name=KT>{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=R.J. |author2=Thorndike, E.M.  |date=1932 |title=Experimental Establishment of the Relativity of Time |journal=Physical Review |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=400–418 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.42.400  |url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ee2c/4c3e0a169f31c8983fdbd853d9e9e6d2f011.pdf |bibcode = 1932PhRv...42..400K |s2cid=121519138 }}</ref> They obtained a null result, and concluded that "there is no effect ...  unless the velocity of the solar system in space is no more than about half that of the earth in its orbit".<ref name="tw"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=H.P.|title=Postulate versus Observation in the Special Theory of Relativity|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=July 1949|volume=21|issue=3|page=381|doi=10.1103/revmodphys.21.378|bibcode = 1949RvMP...21..378R |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1061896/files/RevModPhys.21.378.pdf}}</ref> That possibility was thought to be too coincidental to provide an acceptable explanation, so from the null result of their experiment it was concluded that the round-trip time for light is the same in all inertial reference frames.<ref name="robertson" /><ref name="tw" />

Such a correction was observed, from which was concluded that the frequency of a moving atomic clock is altered according to special relativity.<ref name="robertson" /><ref name="tw" />

Those classic experiments have been repeated many times with increased precision. Other experiments include, for instance, [[Tests of relativistic energy and momentum|relativistic energy and momentum increase]] at high velocities, [[experimental testing of time dilation]], and [[modern searches for Lorentz violation]]s.

=== Tests of general relativity ===
{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}
General relativity has also been confirmed many times, the classic experiments being the perihelion precession of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit, the [[gravitational lens|deflection of light]] by the [[Sun]], and the [[gravitational redshift]] of light. Other tests confirmed the [[equivalence principle]] and [[frame dragging]].

==Modern applications==
Far from being simply of theoretical interest, relativistic effects are important practical engineering concerns. Satellite-based measurement needs to take into account relativistic effects, as each satellite is in motion relative to an Earth-bound user and is thus in a different frame of reference under the theory of relativity. Global positioning systems such as [[GPS]], [[GLONASS]], and [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], must account for all of the relativistic effects, such as the consequences of Earth's gravitational field, in order to work with precision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2003-1/download/lrr-2003-1Color.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105155910/http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2003-1/download/lrr-2003-1Color.pdf |archive-date=2015-11-05 }}</ref> This is also the case in the high-precision measurement of time.<ref name=Francis2002>{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=S.|author2=B.

==Asymptotic symmetries==

The spacetime symmetry group for Special Relativity is the [[Poincaré group]], which is a ten-dimensional group of three Lorentz boosts, three rotations, and four spacetime translations. It is logical to ask what symmetries if any might apply in General Relativity. A tractable case may be to consider the symmetries of spacetime as seen by observers located far away from all sources of the gravitational field.  The naive expectation for asymptotically flat spacetime symmetries might be simply to extend and reproduce the symmetries of flat spacetime of special relativity, ''viz.'', the Poincaré group.

In 1962 [[Hermann Bondi]], M. G. van der Burg, A. W. Metzner<ref name="bondi etal 1962">{{cite journal|title=Gravitational waves in general relativity: VII.

Their first step was to decide on some physically sensible boundary conditions to place on the gravitational field at light-like infinity to characterize what it means to say a metric is asymptotically flat, making no ''a priori'' assumptions about the nature of the asymptotic symmetry group — not even the assumption that such a group exists.  Then after designing what they considered to be the most sensible boundary conditions, they investigated the nature of the resulting asymptotic symmetry transformations that leave invariant the form of the boundary conditions appropriate for asymptotically flat gravitational fields. What they found was that the asymptotic symmetry transformations actually do form a group and the structure of this group does not depend on the particular gravitational field that happens to be present. This means that, as expected, one can separate the kinematics of spacetime from the dynamics of the gravitational field at least at spatial infinity. The puzzling surprise in 1962 was their discovery of a rich infinite-dimensional group (the so-called BMS group) as the asymptotic symmetry group, instead of the finite-dimensional Poincaré group, which is a subgroup of the BMS group. Not only are the Lorentz transformations asymptotic symmetry transformations, there are also additional transformations that are not Lorentz transformations but are asymptotic symmetry transformations. In fact, they found an additional infinity of transformation generators known as ''supertranslations''. This implies the conclusion that General Relativity does ''not'' reduce to special relativity in the case of weak fields at long distances.<ref name=strominger2017>{{cite journal|title=Lectures on the Infrared Structure of Gravity and Gauge Theory|arxiv=1703.05448|year=2017|last1=Strominger|first1=Andrew|quote=...redacted transcript of a course given by the author at Harvard in spring semester 2016.
