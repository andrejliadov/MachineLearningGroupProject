==Overview==
The lecture in which the blackboard was used was the second of three, delivered at [[Rhodes House]] in [[South Parks Road]]. Einstein's visit to give the Rhodes Lectures, and also to receive an honorary [[Doctor of Science]] degree from Oxford University on 23 May 1931, was hosted by the physicist [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]].<ref>{{cite book| first=Ronald W. | last=Clark | authorlink=Ronald W.

All the lectures were delivered in [[German language|German]]. A brief report of the second lecture was given in ''[[The Times]]''<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 18 May 1931.</ref> and in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.<ref>{{cite news| title=Our Astronomical Column | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | date=1931 | volume=127 | page=790 |doi=10.1038/127794a0 }}</ref> A summary of all three lectures can be found in the Archives of the Oxford Museum for the History of Science.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/collections/search/display-narrative/?irn=9738&index=3 | title=Printed Pamphlet Accompanying The Rhodes Lectures, Oxford | date=1931 | first=Albert | last=Einstein | authorlink=Albert Einstein | publisher=[[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford]] | location=UK }}</ref>

The blackboard was rescued with another board by dons (including the chemist [[E. J. Bowen]], zoologist [[Gavin de Beer]], and historian of science [[Robert Gunther]]<ref name="fox18">{{cite journal| first=Robert | last=Fox | authorlink=Robert Fox (historian) | title=Einstein in Oxford | journal=[[Notes and Records]] | volume=72 | issue=3 | pages=293–318 | publisher=[[The Royal Society]] | date=23 May 2018 | doi=10.1098/rsnr.2018.0002 | doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| first=A.

It has recently been shown that these estimates contain a systematic numerical error.<ref name="cor-2013"/>

The blackboard is considered a "mutant" object or artefact because it no longer serves the philosophical purpose of a blackboard, namely temporary information storage. By keeping Einstein's writings on it for ever, the blackboard became something else and can only regain to its original purpose by being wiped.<ref>{{citation| contribution-url=http://jfgauvin2008.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/einsteins-blackboard/ | section=Einstein’s Blackboard as a Mutant Object | first=Jean-Francois | last=Gauvin | date=9 March 2009 | url=http://jfgauvin2008.wordpress.com/ | title=Carrière et vie professionnelle | publisher=[[WordPress]] | accessdate=14 May 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{citation| contribution-url=http://scientificobjects.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/scientificobjectsPublic/index/Archive/Wandering-Seminar-Archive/Objects-Wandering-Seminar/20.html | section=Einstein’s Blackboard as a Mutant Artefact | url=http://scientificobjects.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ | title=History of Scientific Objects | location=Germany | publisher=International Max Planck Research Network | accessdate=14 May 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{citation| contribution-url=http://pietrow.net/relics/#Einsteins_blackboard | section=Einstein’s Blackboard | title=Einstein's Blackboard in Oxford | accessdate=14 January 2019 }}</ref> A second blackboard used by Einstein during the lecture was also donated to the museum, but was accidentally wiped clean by a museum cleaner.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/collections/imu-search-page/record-details/?TitInventoryNo=11714&querytype=field&thumbnails=on&irn=17883 | first=Albert | last=Einstein | title=Einstein Blackboard No.2, 1931 | work=MHS Collection Database Search | publisher=Museum of the History of Science | location=Oxford | date=1931 | accessdate=1 November 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  | title = Investigations into the origin of Einstein's Sink | journal = Studium | year = 2019 | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 260–268 | doi=10.18352/studium.10183| last1 = Pietrow | first1 = Alexander G.M. | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Einstein returned to Oxford again in 1932 and 1933 before he settled at [[Princeton University]] in the United States for the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite book| first=Andrew | last=Robinson | authorlink=W.

==The science of the blackboard==
In 2013 it was pointed out<ref name="cor-2013"/><ref name="Kragh-2013"/><ref name="ORaifeartaigh15">{{cite web|last=O'Raifeartaigh|first=C.|title=Einstein's blackboard and the Friedman-Einstein model of the cosmos|url=https://coraifeartaigh.wordpress.com/2015/12/22/einsteins-blackboard/|website=Antimatter|publisher=[[WordPress]]|date=22 December 2015|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref> that the equations on the Oxford blackboard had been taken directly from a key paper on relativistic cosmology written by Einstein in April 1931 and published in the Proceedings of the Royal Prussian Academy of Science on 9 May that year.<ref name="einstein-1931" /> The paper, known as [[Friedmann–Einstein universe|The Friedmann-Einstein universe]], is of historic significance because it constituted the first scientific publication in which Einstein embraced the possibility of a cosmos of time-varying radius. In the paper,<ref name="einstein-1931" /> Einstein adopts Alexander Friedman's 1922 analysis<ref>Friedman, A. 1922. Über die Krümmung des Raumes. Zeit. Physik. 10 : 377-386</ref> of relativistic models of a universe of time-varying radius and positive curvature, but sets the cosmological constant to zero, declaring it redundant, predicting a universe that expands and contracts over time. (The work is sometimes known as the Friedman-Einstein model of the universe<ref>North, J.D. 1965. The Measure of the Universe: A History of Modern Cosmology . Oxford University Press p132</ref><ref>Rindler, W. 1969. Essential Relativity: Special, General and Cosmological. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company New York p261</ref>). With the use of Edwin Hubble's observations<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hubble |first=Edwin |date=1929-03-15 |title=A relation between distance and radial velocity among extra-galactic nebulae |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=168–173 |doi=10.1073/pnas.15.3.168|doi-access=free }}</ref> of a linear redshift/distance relation for the spiral nebulae, Einstein extracts from his model estimates of ''ρ'' ~ 10<sup>−26</sup> g/cm<sup>3</sup>, ''P'' ~ 10<sup>8</sup> light-years and ''t'' ~ 10<sup>10</sup> years for the density of matter, the radius of the cosmos and the timespan of the cosmic expansion respectively. These values are displayed in the last three lines on the Oxford blackboard (although the units of measurement are not specifically stated for the density estimate, [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|cgs]] units are implied by the other calculations).

==The role of the blackboard in clarifying an error==
It has also been noted<ref name="cor-2013"/><ref name="ORaifeartaigh15" /> that the numerical estimates of cosmic parameters in Einstein's 1931 paper – and on the blackboard – contain a systematic error. Analysis of the 1931 paper shows that, given the contemporaneous Hubble constant of 500&nbsp;km s<sup>−1</sup>Mpc<sup>−1</sup>, Einstein's estimates of cosmic density, radius and timespan should have been ''ρ'' ~ 10<sup>−28</sup> g/cm<sup>3</sup>, ''P'' ~ 10<sup>8</sup> light-years and ''t'' ~ 10<sup>9</sup> years respectively. One line on the blackboard, not included in the published paper, makes the nature of Einstein's error clear. In the fourth line on the blackboard, Einstein obtains a value of 10<sup>−53</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> for the quantity ''D''<sup>2</sup>, defined in the top line of the blackboard as ''D'' = (1/c). (1/P).(dP/dt), i.e., the [[Hubble constant]] divided by the speed of light. Simple calculation shows that the contemporaneous value of the Hubble constant in fact implied a value of ''D''<sup>2</sup> ~ 10<sup>−55</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> (or 10<sup>−51</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>) for this quantity. It appears that Einstein stumbled in converting megaparsecs to cm, giving a density of matter that was too high by a factor of a hundred, a cosmic radius that was too low by a factor of ten, and a timespan for the expansion that was too high by a factor of ten.<ref name="cor-2013" /> These errors were corrected in a later review of relativistic cosmology written by Einstein in 1945.<ref>{{cite book| last=Einstein | first=A. | date=1945 | chapter=Appendix: On the cosmological problem | title=The Meaning of Relativity | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | location=Princeton | edition=2nd }}</ref>

==Nottingham blackboard==
A blackboard used by Einstein in a public lecture at the [[University of Nottingham]] on 6 June 1930 was also preserved after the lecture and is now in the university's archives.<ref>Charlotte Anscombe, [http://blogs.nottingham.ac.uk/newsroom/2015/06/05/remembering-whenalbert-einstein-visited-the-university-and-was-late/ 'Remembering when ...
