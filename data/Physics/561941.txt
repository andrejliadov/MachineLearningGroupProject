'''Kanada''' ([[Sanskrit]]: कणाद, [[IAST]]: ''Kaṇāda''), also known as '''Kashyapa''', '''Ulūka''', '''Kananda''' and '''Kanabhuk''',{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|p=175}}{{Sfn|Riepe|1961|p=228 with footnote 12}} was an ancient [[India]]n natural scientist and philosopher who founded the [[Vaisheshika]] school of [[Indian philosophy]] that also represents the earliest Indian [[physics]].{{Sfn| Bart Labuschagne| Timo Slootweg|2012|p=60, Quote: "Kanada, a Hindu sage who lived either around the 6th or 2nd century BCE, and who founded the philosophical school of Vaisheshika.}}{{Sfn|Jeaneane D.

Estimated to have lived sometime between 6th century to 2nd century BCE, little is known about his life.{{Sfn|Jeaneane D.

'Matter and Mind: The Vaisheshika Sutra of Kanada' (2016), Mount Meru Publishing, Mississauga, Ontario, {{ISBN|978-1-988207-13-1}}.</ref>

The school founded by Kanada explains the creation and existence of the universe by proposing an atomistic theory, applying logic and realism, and is one of the earliest known systematic realist [[ontology]] in human history.{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|p=98}} Kanada suggested that everything can be subdivided, but this subdivision cannot go on forever, and there must be smallest entities (''parmanu'') that cannot be divided, that are eternal, that aggregate in different ways to yield complex substances and bodies with unique identity, a process that involves heat, and this is the basis for all material existence.{{Sfn|H. Margenau|2012|p=xxx-xxxi}}{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|pp=100-102}} He used these ideas with the concept of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, Self) to develop a non-theistic means to [[moksha]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z|url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000loch |url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-3180-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000loch/page/729 729]–731}}</ref>{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|p=177-186}} If viewed from the prism of physics, his ideas imply a clear role for the observer as independent of the system being studied.
Kanada's ideas were influential on other schools of Hinduism, and over its history became closely associated with the [[Nyaya]] school of Hindu philosophy.{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|p=98}}

Kanada's system speaks of six properties ([[padārtha]]s) that are nameable and knowable. He claims that these are sufficient to describe everything in the universe, including observers. These six categories are dravya (substance), guna (quality), karman (motion), samanya (universal), visesa (particular), and samavaya (inherence). There are nine classes of substances (dravya), some of which are atomic, some non-atomic, and others that are all-pervasive.

The ideas of Kanada span a wide range of fields, and they influenced not only philosophy, but possibly scholars in other fields such as Charaka who wrote a medical text that has survived as ''[[Charaka Samhita]]''.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|pp=55-56}}

==''Date''==
The century in which Kanada lived is unclear and have been a subject of a long debate.{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|p=98}} In his review of 1961, Riepe states Kanada lived sometime before 300 CE, but convincing evidence to firmly put him in a certain century remains elusive.{{Sfn|Riepe|1961|pp=228-229}}

The ''Vaisheshika Sutras'' mention competing schools of Indian philosophy such as Samkhya and Mimamsa,{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=54}} but make no mention of Buddhism, which has led scholars in more recent publications to posit estimates of 6th century BCE.{{Sfn| Bart Labuschagne| Timo Slootweg|2012|p=60, Quote: "Kanada, a Hindu sage who lived either around the 6th or 2nd century BCE, and who founded the philosophical school of Vaisheshika.}}{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|pp=98-99}}{{Sfn|H. Margenau|2012|p=xxx-xxxi}} The ''Vaisheshika Sutras'' manuscript has survived into the modern era in multiple versions and the discovery of newer manuscripts in different parts of India by Thakur in 1957 and Jambuvijayaji in 1961, followed by [[critical edition]] studies, suggest that the text attributed to Kanada was systematized and finalized sometime between 200 BCE and the start of the common era, with the possibility that its key doctrines may be much older.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=54}}{{Sfn|Jeaneane D.

In [[Jainism]] literature, he is referred to as ''Sad-uluka'', which means "the Uluka who propounded the doctrine of six categories".{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=54}} His Vaisheshika philosophy similarly appears with alternate names, such as "Aulukya philosophy" derived from the nickname Uluka (literally owl, or grain eater in the night).{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=54}}{{refn|group=note|A legend in the Hindu tradition states that ascetic scholar Kanada would spend all day in his studies and in meditation, eat only once every night like an owl.{{Sfn|Jeaneane D. Fowler|2002|p=99}}}}

Kanada was influential in Indian philosophies, and he appears in various texts by alternate names such as Kashyapa, Uluka, Kananda, Kanabhuk among others.{{Sfn|Sharma|2000|p=175}}{{Sfn|Riepe|1961|p=228 with footnote 12}}

==Ideas==
Physics is central to Kaṇāda’s assertion that all that is knowable is based on motion. His ascribing centrality to physics in the understanding of the universe also follows from his invariance principles. For example, he says that the atom must be spherical since it should be the same in all dimensions.<ref>Kak, S. Kaṇāda, Great Physicist and Sage of Antiquity [https://medium.com/@subhashkak1/kaṇāda-the-great-physicist-and-sage-of-antiquity-5a2abd79b6f1]</ref> He asserts that all substances are composed of four types of atoms, two of which have mass and two are massless.

Kanada presents his work within a larger moral framework by defining Dharma as that which brings about material progress and highest good.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|pp=55-56}}<ref>{{cite book|author1=Purusottama Bilimoria|author2=Joseph Prabhu|author3=Renuka M.

Kanada and early Vaisheshika scholars focused on the evolution of the universe by law.<ref name="SiemensRoodt2008"/> However, this was not unusual for his times since several major early versions of Hindu philosophies such as Samkhya, Nyaya, Mimamsa along with sub-schools of Yoga and Vedanta, as well as non-Vedic schools such as Jainism and Buddhism, were similarly non-theistic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|title= A History of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC |year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0412-8 |pages=281–285 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Roy W.

The text states:<ref name="Sinha">[https://archive.org/stream/thevaiasesikasut00kanauoft#page/n7/mode/2up The ''Vaisheshika sutras'' of Kanada], 2nd Edition, Translator: Nandalal Sinha (1923); Editor: BD Basu; Note: this is the translation of non-critical edition of the manuscript</ref>
* There are nine constituents of realities: four classes of [[atoms]] (earth, water, light and air), space ([[akasha]]), time ([[Kāla (time)|kāla]]), direction (disha), infinity of souls ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]), mind ([[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]).<ref>O'Flaherty, p. 3.</ref>
* Every object of creation is made of atoms (paramāṇu) which in turn connect with each other to form molecules (aṇu). Atoms are eternal, and their combinations constitute the empirical material world.
* Individual souls are eternal and pervade material bodies for a time.
* There are six categories ([[padārtha]]) of experience — substance, quality, activity, generality, particularity, and inherence.

Several traits of substances ([[dravya]]) are given as colour, taste, smell, touch, number, size, the separate, coupling and uncoupling, priority and posterity, comprehension, pleasure and pain, attraction and revulsion, and wishes.<ref>Vitsaxis, Vassilis. Thought and Faith: Comparative Philosophical and Religious Concepts in Ancient Greece, India, and Christianity. Somerset Hall Pr 2009-10-01 (October 2009). P. 299. {{ISBN|1935244035}}.</ref>

Thus the idea of the subdivision is carried further to analytical categories as well, which explains its affinity with [[Nyaya]].


Apart from this Kaṇāda might have already presented the same laws of motion attributed to Newton, as part of the Vaiśeṣika Sutras. 

: ''वेगः निमित्तविशेषात कर्मणो जायते। वेगः निमित्तापेक्षात कर्मणो जायते नियतदिक क्रियाप्रबन्धहेतु। वेगः संयोगविशेषविरोधी॥'' 
: Meaning, action on objects generates motion. The external action being direction causes the motion to be directional. An equal and opposite action can neutralize the motion.

===Observations and theories===
In the fifth chapter of Vaisheshika Sutra, Kanada mentions various empirical observations and natural phenomena such as the falling of objects to the ground, rising of fire and heat upwards, the growth of grass upwards, the nature of rainfall and thunderstorms, the flow of liquids, the movement towards a magnet among many others, asks why these things happen, then attempts to integrate his observations with his theories on atoms, molecules, and their interaction. He classifies observed events into two: those caused by volition, and those caused by subject-object conjunctions.{{Sfn|Bimal Krishna Matilal|1977|p=57}}<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/thevaiasesikasut00kanauoft#page/296/mode/2up The Vaisesika Sutras of Kanada], pp. 152-166, Translated by Nandalal Sinha (note this translation is of the old disputed manuscript, not critical edition)</ref><ref name=wells>John Wells (2009), [http://darshanapress.com/The%20Vaisheshika%20Darshana.pdf The Vaisheshika Darshana], Darshana Press, Chapter 5 verses (main and appendix), critical edition</ref>

His idea of the observer, that is the subject, being different from objective reality is completely consistent with [[Vedanta]], which speaks of the difference between "Apara" and "Para" knowledge, where "Apara" represents normal associational knowledge whereas "Para" represents deeper subjective knowledge.

===The concept of anu (atom)===

[[Dharma]] is that through which there is the accomplishment of rising to the unsurpassed good. Because it is an exposition of that, it has the authority of [[Veda]]. – ''Vaisheshika Sutras 1.1-2''<br><br>
(...) That there is only one individual (soul) is known from the absence of particularity when it comes to the emergence of an understanding of happiness and suffering, (whereas) a multiplicity of individuals is inferred from their perseverance in dharma, and from the strength of their teaching. – ''Vaisheshika Sutras 3.16-18''<br><br>

Kanada proposes that ''paramanu'' ([[atom]]) is an indestructible particle of matter. The atom is indivisible because it is a state at which no measurement can be attributed. He used invariance arguments to determine properties of the atoms. He also stated that ''anu'' can have two states — absolute rest and a state of motion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ece.lsu.edu/kak/roopa51.pdf|title=Space, Time and Anu in Vaisheshika|author=Roopa Narayan|publisher= Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, USA|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>

Adherents of the school of philosophy founded by Kanada considered the [[atom]] to be indestructible, and hence eternal. They believed atoms to be minute objects invisible to the naked eye which come into being and vanish in an instant. Vaiseshikas further held that atoms of the same substance combined with each other to produce dvyanuka ([[diatomic molecule]]s) and tryanuka ([[triatomic molecule]]s). Kanada also put forward the idea that atoms could be combined in various ways to produce chemical changes in presence of other factors such as heat. He gave blackening of earthen pot and ripening of fruit as examples of this phenomenon.<ref name="Kapoor">Kapoor, Subodh. The Indian Encyclopaedia, Volume 1. Cosmo Publications. P. 5643. {{ISBN|8177552570}}.</ref>

Kanada postulated four different kinds of atoms: two with mass, and two without.<ref name="Kak"/> Each substance is supposed to consist of all four kinds of atoms.

Kanada's conception of the [[atom]] was likely independent from the similar concept among the ancient Greeks, because of the differences between the theories.<ref name=edwardcraig199/> For example, Kanada suggested that atoms as building blocks differ both qualitatively and quantitatively, while Greeks suggested that atoms differed only quantitatively but not qualitatively.<ref name=edwardcraig199>{{cite book|author=Edward Craig|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Index|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FWa85vgoTQC |year=1998|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-18715-2|pages=198–199}}</ref>
