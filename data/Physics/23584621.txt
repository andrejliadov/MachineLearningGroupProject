The Harold Brown Award is intended to recognize significant achievements in research and development. It is named for [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], a [[physicist]] who served as [[United States Secretary of the Air Force]]  from 1965-1969, and later as [[United States Secretary of Defense]] (1977-1981).

The Harold Brown award is presented annually to a person whose achievements in research and development have led to, or demonstrated promise of, a substantial improvement in the operational effectiveness of the Air Force. It is awarded through the United States Air Force chief scientist's office.

The winner of the award receives a brass medallion set in a block of Lucite and a certificate signed by the [[Secretary of the Air Force]] and the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the Air Force]].
