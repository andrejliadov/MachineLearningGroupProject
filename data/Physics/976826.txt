A [[observable|physical quantity]] is said to have a '''discrete spectrum''' if it takes only distinct values, with gaps between one value and the next.

The classical example of discrete spectrum (for which the term was first used) is the characteristic set of discrete [[spectral line]]s seen in the [[emission spectrum]] and [[absorption spectrum]] of isolated [[atom]]s of a [[chemical element]], which only absorb and emit light at particular [[wavelength]]s. The technique of [[spectroscopy]] is based on this phenomenon.

Discrete spectra are contrasted with the [[Continuous spectrum|continuous spectra]] also seen in such experiments, for example in [[thermal emission]], in [[synchrotron radiation]], and many other light-producing phenomena.

Discrete spectra are seen in many other phenomena, such as vibrating [[string (music)|string]]s, [[microwave]]s in a [[microwave cavity|metal cavity]], [[sound wave]]s in a [[pulsating star]], and [[resonance (particle physics)|resonances]] in high-energy [[particle physics]].

The general phenomenon of discrete spectra in physical systems can be mathematically modeled with tools of [[functional analysis]], specifically by the [[decomposition of spectrum (functional analysis)|decomposition of the spectrum]] of a [[linear operator]] acting on a [[functional space]].

==Origins of discrete spectra==

=== Classical mechanics ===
In [[classical mechanics]], discrete spectra are often associated to [[wave]]s and [[oscillation]]s in a bounded object or domain.  Mathematically they can be identified with the [[eigenvalue]]s of [[differential operator]]s that describe the evolution of some continuous variable (such as [[deformation (mechanics)|strain]] or [[pressure]]) as a function of time and/or space.

Discrete spectra are also produced by some [[non-linear oscillator]]s where the relevant quantity has a non-[[sinusoid]]al [[waveform]].  Notable examples are the sound produced by the [[vocal chord]]s of mammals.<ref name=pulak>

A related phenomenon is the appearance of strong harmonics when a sinusoidal signal (which has the ultimate "discrete spectrum", consisting of a single spectral line) is modified by a non-linear [[filter (signal processing)|filter]]; for example, when a [[pure tone]] is played through an overloaded [[amplifier]],<ref name=klip>Paul V. Klipsch (1969), [http://www.elpee.info/Documenten/KlipschVervorming.pdf ''Modulation distortion in loudspeakers''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025155/http://www.elpee.info/Documenten/KlipschVervorming.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }} Journal of the Audio Engineering Society.</ref> or when an intense [[monochromatic]] [[laser]] beam goes through a [[non-linear optics|non-linear medium]].<ref>

</ref>  In the latter case, if two arbitrary sinusoidal signals with frequencies ''f'' and ''g'' are processed together, the output signal will generally have spectral lines at frequencies |''mf'' + ''ng''| where ''m'' and ''n'' are any integers.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
{{main|Spectrum (functional analysis) #Point spectrum}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], the discrete spectrum of an observable corresponds to the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[operator (physics)|operator]] used to model that observable.  According to the [[functional analysis|mathematical theory of such operators]], its eigenvalues are a discrete set of [[isolated point]]s, which may be either [[finite set|finite]] or [[countable set|countable]].

Discrete spectra are usually associated with systems that are [[bound state|bound]] in some sense (mathematically, confined to a [[compact space]]).  The [[position operator|position]] and [[momentum operator]]s have continuous spectra in an infinite domain, but a discrete (quantized) spectrum in a compact domain<ref name=LL>L. D. Landau, E. M. Lifshitz,  [https://archive.org/details/QuantumMechanics_104 Quantum Mechanics ( Volume 3 of A Course of Theoretical Physics ) Pergamon Press 1965]</ref>  and the same properties of spectra hold for [[angular momentum]], [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonians]] and other operators of  quantum  systems.<ref name= LL />

The [[quantum harmonic oscillator]] and the [[hydrogen atom]] are examples of physical systems in which the Hamiltonian has a discrete spectrum. In the case of the hydrogen atom the spectrum has both a continuous and a discrete part, the continuous part representing the [[ionization]].
