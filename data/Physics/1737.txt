'''Anaxagoras''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|æ|k|ˈ|s|æ|g|ə|r|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀναξαγόρας}}, ''Anaxagoras'', "lord of the assembly"; {{circa|500<ref>{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Daniel W. |title=The Texts of Early Greek Philosophy: The Complete Fragments and Selected Testimonies of the Major Presocratics, Part 1 |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-521-73763-0 |page=314}}</ref>|428}}&nbsp;BC) was a [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]]. Born in [[Clazomenae]] at a time when [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] was under the control of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], Anaxagoras came to [[Athens]]. According to [[Diogenes Laërtius]] and [[Plutarch]], in later life he was charged with [[impiety]] and went into exile in [[Lampsacus]]; the charges may have been political, owing to his association with [[Pericles]], if they were not fabricated by later ancient biographers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Filonik|first=Jakub|date=2013|title=Athenian impiety trials: a reappraisal|journal=Dike|issue=16|pages=26–33|doi=10.13130/1128-8221/4290}}</ref>

Responding to the claims of [[Parmenides]] on the impossibility of change, Anaxagoras described the world as a mixture of primary imperishable ingredients, where material variation was never caused by an absolute presence of a particular ingredient, but rather by its relative preponderance over the other ingredients; in his words, "each one is... most manifestly those things of which there are the most in it".<ref name=Curd>{{cite book |author=Anaxagoras |editor1-last=Curd|editor1-first=Patricia|title=A Presocratics Reader|publisher=Hackett|isbn=978-1-60384-305-8|chapter=Anaxagoras of Clazomenae|quote=B12|date=2011-03-11}}</ref> He introduced the concept of ''[[Nous]]'' ([[Cosmos|Cosmic]] Mind) as an ordering force, which moved and separated out the original mixture, which was [[homogeneous]], or nearly so.

He also gave a number of novel scientific accounts of natural phenomena. He deduced a correct explanation for [[eclipse]]s and described the Sun as a fiery mass larger than the [[Peloponnese]], as well as attempting to explain [[rainbows]] and [[meteors]].

==Biography==
Anaxagoras is believed to have enjoyed some wealth and political influence in his native town of [[Clazomenae]]. However, he supposedly surrendered this out of a fear that they would hinder his search for knowledge.<ref name="EB1911">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Anaxagoras|volume=1|page=943|first=William|last=Wallace|authorlink=William Wallace (philosopher)|first2=John Malcolm|last2=Mitchell}}</ref> The Roman author [[Valerius Maximus]] preserves a different tradition: Anaxagoras, coming home from a long voyage, found his property in ruin, and said: "If this had not perished, I would have"—a sentence described by Valerius as being "possessed of sought-after wisdom!"<ref>{{cite book |title=Anaxagoras of Clazomenae: Fragments and Testimonia : a text and translation with notes and essays |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PA6HMrSrjfkC&pg=PA90 |isbn=9780802093257 }}</ref><ref>Val. Max., VIII, 7, ext., 5: ''Qui, cum e diutina peregrinatione patriam repetisset possessionesque desertas vidisset, "non essem – inquit "ego salvus, nisi istae perissent." Vocem petitae sapientiae compotem!''</ref>

Anaxagoras was a Greek citizen of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] and had served in the Persian army; he may have been a member of the Persian regiments that entered mainland Greece during the [[Greco-Persian Wars]].{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=66}} Though this remains uncertain, "it would certainly explain why he came to [[Athens]] in the year of [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], 480/79 B.C."{{sfn|Copleston|2003|page=66}} Anaxagoras is said to have remained in Athens for thirty years. [[Pericles]] learned to love and admire him, and the poet [[Euripides]] derived from him an enthusiasm for science and humanity.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from [[Ionia]] to Athens.  His observations of the celestial bodies and the fall of [[meteorite]]s led him to form new theories of the universal order, and to prediction of the impact of meteorites. Plutarch<ref>Life of Lysander 12.1</ref> says "Anaxagoras is said to have predicted that if the heavenly bodies should be loosened by some slip or shake, one of them might be torn away, and might plunge and fall down to earth". According to Pliny <ref>Natural History 2.149</ref> he was credited with predicting the fall of the [[Aegospotami|meteorite in 467]].<ref name="Couprie2004">{{cite journal|last1=Couprie|first1=Dirk|title=How Thales Was Able to "Predict" a Solar Eclipse Without the Help of Alleged Mesopotamian Wisdom|journal=Early Science and Medicine|volume=9|issue=4|year=2004|pages=321–337|issn=1383-7427|doi=10.1163/1573382043004631}}</ref> He attempted to give a scientific account of [[eclipse]]s, [[meteor]]s, [[rainbow]]s, and the [[Sun]], which he described as a mass of blazing metal, larger than the [[Peloponnese]]; his theories about eclipses, the Sun and Moon may well have been based on observations of the eclipse of 463 BCE, which was visible in Greece.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEsearch/SEsearchmap.php?Ecl=-04620430 |title = NASA - Total Solar Eclipse of -462 April 30}}</ref>He also said that the Moon had mountains and believed that it was inhabited. The heavenly bodies, he asserted, were masses of stone torn from the Earth and ignited by rapid rotation.<ref name="EB1911"/> He was the first to give a correct explanation of eclipses, and was both famous and notorious for his scientific theories, including the claims that the Sun is a mass of red-hot metal, that the Moon is earthy, and that the stars are fiery stones.<ref>[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anaxagoras/ Anaxagoras biography]</ref> He thought the Earth was flat and floated supported by 'strong' air under it and disturbances in this air sometimes caused earthquakes.<ref name="Burnet2003">{{cite book|last=Burnet|first=John |title=Early Greek Philosophy 1892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YfOk91wkUQsC|year=2003|publisher=Kessinger |isbn=978-0-7661-2826-2}}</ref> These speculations made him vulnerable in Athens to a charge of [[asebeia]] (impiety). [[Diogenes Laërtius]] reports the story that he was prosecuted by [[Cleon]] for impiety, but Plutarch says that Pericles sent his former tutor, Anaxagoras, to Lampsacus for his own safety after the Athenians began to blame him for the [[Peloponnesian war]].<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/pericles.1b.txt Plutarch, ''Pericles'']</ref>

The charges against Anaxagoras may have stemmed from his denial of the existence of a [[Solar deity|solar]] or [[lunar deity]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Homer W. |author-link=Homer W.

He died there in around the year 428. Citizens of Lampsacus erected an altar to Mind and Truth in his memory, and observed the anniversary of his death for many years. They placed over his grave the following inscription: Here Anaxagoras, who in his quest of truth scaled heaven itself, is laid to rest.{{efn|{{lang-grc|ἐνθάδε, πλεῖστον ἀληθείας ἐπὶ τέρμα περήσας οὐρανίου κόσμου, κεῖται Ἀναξαγόρας.}}<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0004.tlg001.perseus-grc1:2.3 Diogenes Laertius, Lives of the Philosophers, § 2.15]</ref>}}

Anaxagoras wrote a book of philosophy, but only fragments of the first part of this have survived, through preservation in work of [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] in the 6th century AD.<ref>The most thorough text and commentary is D. Sider, ''The Fragments of Anaxagoras'', 2nd ed., Sankt Augustin, 2005.</ref>

==Philosophy==
[[Image:Anaxagoras Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|right|thumb|Anaxagoras, depicted as a medieval scholar in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]
According to Anaxagoras all things have existed in some way from the beginning, but originally they existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves, endless in number and inextricably combined throughout the universe. All things existed in this mass, but in a confused and indistinguishable form.<ref name="EB1911"/> There was an infinite number of homogeneous parts ({{lang|el|ὁμοιομερῆ}}) as well as heterogeneous ones.<ref name="smith">
{{Cite DGRBM |last=Schmitz |first=Leonhard |title=Anaxagoras|volume=1|page=|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DA%3Aentry+group%3D21%3Aentry%3Danaxagoras-bio-1}}</ref>

The work of arrangement, the segregation of like from unlike and the summation of the whole into totals of the same name, was the work of [[Nous|Mind or Reason]] ({{lang|el|νοῦς}}). Mind is no less unlimited than the chaotic mass, but it stood pure and independent, a thing of finer texture, alike in all its manifestations and everywhere the same. This subtle agent, possessed of all knowledge and power, is especially seen ruling in all the forms of life.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Diels|editor1-first=Hermann|title=Die fragmente der Vorsokratiker griechisch und deutsch|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_oEYZAAAAMAAJ|quote=B12|publisher=Berlin, Weidmannsche buchhandlung|year=1912}}</ref> Its first appearance, and the only manifestation of it which Anaxagoras describes, is Motion. It gave distinctness and reality to the aggregates of like parts.<ref name="EB1911"/>

Decrease and growth represent a new aggregation ({{lang|el|σὐγκρισις}}) and disruption ({{lang|el|διάκρισις}}). However, the original intermixture of things is never wholly overcome.<ref name="EB1911"/> Each thing contains in itself parts of other things or heterogeneous elements, and is what it is, only on account of the preponderance of certain homogeneous parts which constitute its character.<ref name="smith"/> Out of this process arise the things we see in this world.<ref name="smith"/>

==Literary references==
Anaxagoras is mentioned by [[Socrates]] during his trial in [[Plato]]'s "[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]".  In the [[Phaedo]], Plato portrays Socrates saying of Anaxagoras that as a young man: 'I eagerly acquired his books and read them as quickly as I could'.<ref>Plato, ''Phaedo'', 85b</ref>

In a quote which begins [[Nathanael West]]'s first book ''[[The Dream Life of Balso Snell]]'' (1931), [[Marcel Proust]]'s character Bergotte says, "After all, my dear fellow, life, Anaxagoras has said, is a journey."

Anaxagoras appears as a character in ''[[Faust, Part Two|Faust, Part II]]'' by [[Goethe|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].

Anaxagoras appears as a character in ''The Ionia Sanction'', by [[Gary Corby]].

Anaxagoras is referred to and admired by Cyrus Spitama, the hero and narrator of ''[[Creation (novel)|Creation]]'', by [[Gore Vidal]]. The book contains this passage, explaining how Anaxagoras became influential:

:[According to Anaxagoras] One of the largest things is a hot stone that we call the sun. When Anaxagoras was very young, he predicted that sooner or later a piece of the sun would break off and fall to earth. Twenty years ago, he was proved right. The whole world saw a fragment of the sun fall in a fiery arc through the sky, landing near [[Aegospotami]] in Thrace. When the fiery fragment cooled, it proved to be nothing more than a chunk of brown rock. Overnight Anaxagoras was famous. Today his book is read everywhere. You can buy a secondhand copy in the Agora for a drachma.<ref>Vidal, Gore, ''Creation: restored edition'', chapter 2, Vintage Books (2002)</ref>

[[William H. Gass]] begins his novel, ''The Tunnel'' (1995), with a quote from Anaxagoras: "The descent to hell is the same from every place."

He is also mentioned in Seneca's Natural Questions (Book 4B, originally Book 3: On Clouds, Hail, Snow) It reads: "Why should I too allow myself the same liberty as Anaxagoras allowed himself?"

[[Dante Alighieri]] places Anaxagoras in the First Circle of Hell (Limbo) in his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', Canto IV, line 137).

Chapter 5 in Book II of [[De Docta Ignorantia]] (1440) by [[Nicholas of Cusa]] is dedicated to the truth of the sentence "Each thing is in each thing" which he attributes to Anaxagoras.
