{{About|highly-doped semiconductors that begin to show metal-like electronic behavior||Degeneracy (disambiguation){{!}}Degeneracy}}
A '''degenerate semiconductor''' is a [[semiconductor]] with such a high level of [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] that the material starts to act more like a [[metal]] than as a semiconductor. Unlike non-degenerate semiconductors, these kind of semiconductor do not obey law of mass action, which relates intrinsic carrier concentration with temperature and bandgap.

At moderate doping levels the [[dopant]] atoms create individual doping levels that can often be considered as localized states that can donate [[electron]]s or [[electron hole|holes]] by [[thermal promotion]] (or an [[optical transition]]) to the [[conduction band|conduction]] or [[valence band]]s respectively. At high enough impurity concentrations the individual impurity atoms may become close enough neighbors that their doping levels merge into an impurity band and the behavior of such a system ceases to show the typical traits of a semiconductor, e.g. its increase in conductivity with temperature. On the other hand, a degenerate semiconductor still has far fewer charge carriers than a true metal so that its behavior is in many ways intermediary between semiconductor and metal.

Many [[copper sulfide|copper chalcogenides]] are degenerate [[p-type semiconductor]]s with relatively large numbers of holes in their valence band. An example is the system LaCuOS<sub>1−x</sub>Se<sub>x</sub> with Mg doping. It is a [[wide gap]] p-type degenerate semiconductor. The hole concentration does not change with temperature, a typical trait of degenerate semiconductors.<ref>{{ cite conference|title= Wide gap p-type degenerate semiconductor: Mg-doped LaCuOSe
