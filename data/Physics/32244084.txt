In [[physics]] and in particular in the theory of [[magnetism]], an '''antidynamo theorem''' is one of several results that restrict the  type of [[magnetic fields]] that may be produced by [[dynamo theory|dynamo]] action.  

One notable example is [[Thomas Cowling]]'s antidynamo theorem which states that no [[axisymmetric]] magnetic field can be maintained through a self-sustaining dynamo action by an axially symmetric current.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Magnetic Field of Sunspots|first=T. G. |last=Cowling |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=94 |pages=39&ndash;48 |year=1934|doi=10.1093/mnras/94.1.39 |bibcode = 1933MNRAS..94...39C |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Apart from the [[Earth's magnetic field]], some other bodies such as [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], and the [[Sun#Magnetic field|Sun]] have significant magnetic fields whose major component is a [[Magnetic dipole|dipole]], an axisymmetric magnetic field. These magnetic fields are self-sustained through fluid motion in the Sun or planets, with the necessary non symmetry for the planets deriving from the [[Coriolis force]] caused by their rapid rotation, and one cause of non-symmetry for the Sun being its [[Solar rotation|differential rotation]]. The magnetic fields of planets with slow rotation periods and/or solid cores, such as [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]] and [[Mars]], have dissipated to almost nothing by comparison.

The impact of the known anti-dynamo theorems is that successful dynamos do not possess a high degree of symmetry.
