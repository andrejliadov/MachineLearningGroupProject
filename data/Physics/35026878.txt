The '''Midwestern Universities Research Association''' ('''MURA''') was a collaboration between 15 universities with the goal of designing and building a [[particle accelerator]] for the [[Midwestern United States]]. It existed between 1953–1967, but could not achieve its goal in this time and lost funding. It was thought that President [[John F. Kennedy]] would have supported the MURA machine, while one of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s first actions was the shutdown of the MURA machine and laboratory.<ref name=inno>{{Cite book

[[File:mura ring.jpg|thumb|layout of MURA FFAG]]
In its formative years, [[Donald Kerst]] was the director of MURA.<ref name=inno /> At this institution, [[Keith Symon]] invented the [[FFAG accelerator]], independently to [[Tihiro Ohkawa]], which combines several concepts of [[cyclotron]]s and [[synchrotron]]s. FFAG concepts were extensively developed in MURA. The proposed MURA accelerators were scaling [[FFAG synchrotron]]s, meaning that orbits of any momentum are photographic enlargements of those of any other momentum.

The concept of FFAG acceleration was revived in the early 1980s,<ref>Martin, S.; Wüstefeld, G. (ed.) (1983). ''Seminar on Fixed Field Alternating Gradient accelerators (FFAG)'', held at [[Jülich Research Centre]]. informal collection of contributed talks. KFA report SNQ 2 MZ / BS 001</ref> and gained interest up to the present day, see e.g. [[EMMA (accelerator)]].
