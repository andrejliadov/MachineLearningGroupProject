In physics, '''Born reciprocity''', also called '''reciprocal relativity''' or '''Born–Green reciprocity''', is a [[principle]] set up by theoretical physicist [[Max Born]] that calls for a [[duality (mathematics)|duality]]-[[symmetry]] among [[space]] and [[momentum]]. Born and his co-workers expanded his principle to a framework that is also known as '''reciprocity theory'''.<ref name="born-1938">M. Born, A suggestion for unifying quantum theory and relativity, Proceedings of the Royal Society London A (1938), vol.&nbsp;165, pp.&nbsp;291–303, {{DOI|10.1098/rspa.1938.0060}} [http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/165/921/291.full.pdf full text]</ref><ref name="born-1949">M. Born (1949), Reciprocity Theory of Elementary Particles, Review of Modern Physics vol.&nbsp;21, no.&nbsp;3, pp.&nbsp;463–473 {{DOI|10.1103/RevModPhys.21.463}}</ref>

Born noticed a symmetry among [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] and [[momentum space]] representations of a [[free particle]], in that its wave function description is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] to a change of variables ''x''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''p'' and ''p''&nbsp;→&nbsp;&minus;''x''. (It can also be worded such as to include [[scale factor]]s, e.g. invariance to ''x''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''ap'' and ''p''&nbsp;→&nbsp;&minus;''bx'' where ''a'', ''b'' are constants.) Born hypothesized that such symmetry should apply to the [[four-vector]]s of [[special relativity]], that is, to the four-vector space coordinates
:<math> \mathbf{X} = X^{\mu} := \left(X^0, X^1, X^2, X^3 \right) = \left(ct, x, y, z \right) </math>

and the four-vector momentum ([[four-momentum]]) coordinates
:<math> \mathbf{P} = P^{\nu} := \left(P^0, P^1, P^2, P^3 \right) = \left(\frac{E}{c}, p_x, p_y, p_z \right) </math>
Both in classical and in quantum mechanics, the Born reciprocity conjecture postulates that the transformation ''x''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''p'' and ''p''&nbsp;→&nbsp;&minus;''x'' leaves invariant the [[Hamilton equations]]:
:<math>\dot{x}_i = \partial H / \partial p_i</math> and <math>\dot{p}_i = - \partial H / \partial x_i</math>

From his reciprocity approach, Max Born conjectured the invariance of a space-time-momentum-energy [[line element]].<ref>M.

Such a reciprocity as called for by Born can be observed in much, but not all, of the formalism of classical and quantum physics. Born's reciprocity theory was not developed much further for reason of difficulties in the mathematical foundations of the theory.

However Born's idea of a quantum metric operator was later taken up by [[Hideki Yukawa]] when developing his nonlocal quantum theory in the 1950s.<ref>[[Eduard Prugovečki]]: Stochastic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Spacetime, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1984, {{ISBN|978-9027716170}}, ''Section 4.5 Reciprocity Theory and Born's Quantum Metric Operator'', pp.&nbsp;199 ff.</ref><ref>Y.

Born chose the term "reciprocity" for the reason that in a [[Crystal structure|crystal]] [[Lattice model (physics)|lattice]], the motion of a particle can be described in ''p''-space by means of the [[reciprocal lattice]].<ref name="born-1938"/>
