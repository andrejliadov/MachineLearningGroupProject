In [[thermodynamics]], a '''thermodynamicist''' is someone who studies [[thermodynamic process]]es and phenomena, i.e. the [[physics]] that deal with [[Mechanics|mechanical]] action and relations of [[heat]].

Among the well-known number of [[:Category:thermodynamicists|famous thermodynamicists]], include [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Willard Gibbs]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], and [[Max Planck]].

==History of term==
Although most consider the French physicist [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Nicolas Sadi Carnot]] to be the first true thermodynamicist, the term ''thermodynamics'' itself wasn’t coined until 1849 by [[Lord Kelvin]] in his publication ''An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat''.<ref>Kelvin, William T. (1849). "An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat - with Numerical Results Deduced from Regnault's Experiments on Steam." ''Transactions of the Edinburg Royal Society, XVI. January 2.'' [http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&O=NUMM-95118 Scanned Copy]</ref>

The first thermodynamic textbook was written in 1859 by [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]], a civil and mechanical engineering professor at the [[University of Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Cengel, Yunus A.|author2=Boles, Michael A. | title=Thermodynamics - An Engineering Approach | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2005 | isbn=0-07-310768-9}}</ref>
