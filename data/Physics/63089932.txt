The '''Gribov Medal''' is a prize awarded every two years since 2001 by the [[European Physical Society]] for work in [[Theoretical particle physics|theoretical elementary particle physics]] or [[quantum field theory]]. It is awarded to younger physicists (age under 35) and is named after [[Vladimir Gribov|Vladimir Naumovich Gribov]].

|[[Steven Gubser]]
|''"For his outstanding work that has revealed a deep connection between gauge theories and gravitational interactions in the framework of string theories. This made it possible to compute and understand interesting properties of a gauge theory in 3+1 dimensions from a gravitational theory in 4+1 dimensions."''

|[[Matias Zaldarriaga]]
|''"For his important theoretical contributions to Cosmology, with impact also on the theories of fundamental interactions. Among others for: a) developing an efficient method for calculating the observed [[Cosmic microwave background|CMB fluctuations]] in a given cosmological model. This has greatly facilitated imposing constraints on cosmological models and is widely used. b) Realizing the importance of polarization in the CMB and the possibility to measure it. c) Pointing out the importance of the effect of gravitational lensing by local matter on the CMB background."''
