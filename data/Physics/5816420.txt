In [[geometry]], the '''center of curvature''' of a [[curve (mathematics)|curve]] is found at a point that is at a distance from the curve equal to the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] lying on the [[normal vector]].  It is the [[point at infinity]] if the curvature is zero.  The [[osculating circle]] to the curve is centre

at the centre of curvature.  [[Cauchy]] defined the center of curvature ''C'' as the intersection point of two [[infinitesimal|infinitely close]] normal lines to the curve.<ref>*{{citation
