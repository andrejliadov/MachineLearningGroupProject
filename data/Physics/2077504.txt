An '''electrolaser''' is a type of [[electroshock weapon]] that is also a [[directed-energy weapon]]. It uses [[laser]]s to form an electrically conductive ''laser-induced plasma channel'' (LIPC). A fraction of a second later, a powerful electric current is sent down this [[plasma channel]] and delivered to the target, thus functioning overall as a large-scale, high energy, long-distance version of the [[Taser]] [[electroshock gun]].

[[Alternating current]] is sent through a series of step-up [[transformer]]s, increasing the [[voltage]] and decreasing the [[electric current|current]]. The final voltage may be between 10<sup>8</sup> and 10<sup>9</sup> volts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} This current is fed into the plasma channel created by the laser beam.

==Laser-induced plasma channel==
A ''laser-induced plasma channel'' (LIPC) is formed by the following process:
* A laser emits a laser beam into the air.
* The laser beam rapidly heats and ionizes surrounding gases to form [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].
* The plasma forms an electrically conductive  plasma channel.

Because a laser-induced plasma channel relies on ionization, gas must exist between the electrolaser weapon and its target. If a laser-beam is intense enough, its electromagnetic field is strong enough to rip electrons off of air molecules, or whatever gas happens to be in between, creating plasma.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18630622</ref> Similar to lightning, the rapid heating also creates a sonic boom.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Uses==
Methods of use:
*To kill or incapacitate a living target through [[electric shock]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Guinnessy | first=Paul| date=1997-11-01 | accessdate=2020-01-25 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15621060-600-set-phasers-to-shock/| title=Set phasers to shock ... .|website=[[New Scientist]]}}</ref>
*To seriously damage, disable, or destroy any [[electric]] or [[electronics|electronic]] devices in the target.
*As electrolasers and natural [[lightning]] both use plasma channels to conduct electric current, an electrolaser can set up a light-induced plasma channel for uses such as:
** To study [[lightning]]
** During a [[thunderstorm]], to make lightning discharge at a safe time and place, as with a [[lightning conductor]].<ref name=laserfilament1/>
** [[Harvesting lightning energy|Directing atmospheric lightning to a terrestrial collection station for the purpose of electrical power generation]]. 
** As a weapon, to make a [[thunderhead (cloud)|thunderhead]] deliver a precise lightning strike onto a target from an aircraft; in this case, the aircraft and laser can be compared to a [[triggered spark gap]], in that the relatively minor amount of initial input from the laser allows a large amount of energy to flow between the cloud and the ground.
Because of the plasma channel, an electrolaser may cause an accident if there is a [[thunderstorm]] (or other electricity sources such as overhead powerlines) about.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} (''See'' [[Taser]] ''for more information &ndash; principles of operation, controversies, etc''.)

An electrolaser is not presently practical for [[wireless energy transfer]] due to danger and low efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Examples of electrolasers==

===Applied Energetics/Ionatron===
Publicly traded company [[Applied Energetics]] (formerly Ionatron) develops directed-energy weapons for the United States [[military]]. The company has produced a device called the Joint IED Neutralizer (JIN) which was deemed unfit for field use in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schachtman | first=Noah | date=2006-05-21 | accessdate=2007-11-10 | url=http://www.noahshachtman.com/archives/002170.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003053841/http://www.noahshachtman.com/archives/002170.html | archivedate=3 October 2011| title=Real-Life Ray Gun: Say When?}}</ref> The JIN is intended for safely detonating [[improvised explosive devices]] (IEDs). Future designs include weapons mounted on land, air and sea vehicles and as a hand-held infantry version.

Applied Energetics said that the weapons will be able to be used as a non-lethal alternative to current weaponry, but will be able to deliver a high enough voltage jolt to kill.

Applied Energetics say that they are working on an electrolaser system, called LGE (Laser Guided Energy).{{Citation needed|reason=Previous citation was a bogus link to Amazon|date=February 2017}} They are also studying a laser-induced plasma channel (LIPC) as a way to stop people from going through a corridor or passageway.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.defense-update.com/products/l/LPIC.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117160739/http://www.defense-update.com/products/l/LPIC.htm |archive-date=2014-01-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Phoenix===
There was an unconfirmed report that in 1985 the [[U.S. Navy]] tested an electrolaser.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Its targets were missiles and aircraft. This device was known as the Phoenix project within the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] research program. It was first proved by experiment at long range in 1985, but this report may have referred to an early test of [[MIRACL]], which is or was a high-powered [[chemical laser]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

===HSV Technologies===
HSV Technologies, Inc. (Stood for the last names of the original founders, Herr, Schlesinger and Vernon; this is NOT the same company as Holden Special Vehicles), formerly of [[San Diego, California]], USA, then Port Orchard, WA, designed a non-lethal device which was profiled in the 2002 ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine article "Beyond the Rubber Bullet". It is an electrolaser using [[ultraviolet]] laser beams of 193&nbsp;nm, and promises to immobilize living targets at a distance without contact. There is plan for an engine-disabling variation for use against the electronic ignitions of cars using a 248&nbsp;nm laser. The lead inventor, Eric Herr, died in 2008 and the company appears to have been dissolved, as their website now hosts an unrelated business (as of 9/2015) <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hsvti.com/ |title=HSV Technologies official website |access-date=2019-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418130104/http://www.hsvti.com/ |archive-date=2018-04-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Picatinny Arsenal===
Scientists and engineers from [[Picatinny Arsenal]] have demonstrated that an electric discharge can go through a laser beam. The laser beam is self-focusing due to the high laser intensity of 50 gigawatts, which changes the [[Speed of light#In a medium|speed of light]] in air.<ref>Kaneshiro, Jason. [http://www.army.mil/article/82262/ "Picatinny engineers set phasers to 'fry'"] ''[[Picatinny Arsenal]]'', 21 June 2012. Retrieved: 13 July 2012.</ref> The laser was reportedly successfully tested in January 2012.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18630622 BBC news-Lightning Laser Weapon Developed by US Army]</ref>
