'''The Copley Medal''' is an award given by the [[Royal Society]], for "outstanding achievements in research in any branch of science".

== History ==

The medal was created following a donation of [[Pound sterling|£]]100 to be used for carrying out experiments by [[Sir Godfrey Copley, 2nd Baronet|Sir Godfrey Copley]], for which the interest on the amount was used for several years.<ref name="cop2">{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Societies/CopleyMedal.html|title=Copley Medal|publisher=[[University of St Andrews]]|accessdate=2009-02-04|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HlNyz75P?url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Societies/CopleyMedal.html|archive-date=2013-06-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> The conditions for the medal have been changed several times; in 1736, it was suggested that "a medal or other honorary prize should be bestowed on the person whose experiment should be best approved", and this remained the rule until 1831, when the conditions were changed so that the medal would be awarded to the researcher that the Royal Society Council decided most deserved it.<ref name="cop2"/> A second donation of £1666 13[[Shilling (British coin)|s]]. 4[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]]. (400,000 [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|old pence]]) was made by Sir Joseph William Copley in 1881, and the interest from that amount is used to pay for the medal.<ref name="cop2"/> The medal in its current format is made of [[silver-gilt]] and awarded with a £25,000 prize.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.royalsociety.org/inside-science/2016/05/18/copley-winners-that-changed-the-world/|title=Copley winners that changed the world|website=blogs.royalsociety.org|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=26 May 2020|date=18 May 2016}}</ref><ref name="cop1"/>

Since its inception, it has been awarded to many notable scientists, including 52 winners of the [[Nobel Prize]]: 17 in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]], 21 in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]], and 14 in [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]].
[[John Theophilus Desaguliers]] has won the medal the most often, winning three times, in 1734, 1736 and 1741. In 1976, [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] became the first and, as of 2020, the only female recipient.
