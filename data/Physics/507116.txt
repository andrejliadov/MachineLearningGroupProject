[[File:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Stephen Hawking]], a recipient of the award in 1978.]] The '''Albert Einstein Award''' (sometimes mistakenly called the ''Albert Einstein Medal'' because it was accompanied with a gold medal) was an award in [[theoretical physics]], given periodically from 1951 to 1979, that was established to recognize high achievement in the [[natural science]]s. It was endowed by the [[Lewis and Rosa Strauss Memorial Fund]] in honor of [[Albert Einstein]]'s 70th birthday. It was first awarded in 1951 and, in addition to a gold medal of Einstein by sculptor [[Gilroy Roberts]],<ref>''Wheeler Honored'', Princeton Alumni Weekly, Volume 65, June 8, 1965.</ref> it also included a prize money of $15,000,<ref name="mactutor">[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Printonly/Schwinger.html Biography of J.

This award should not be confused with many others named after the famous physicist, such as the [[Albert Einstein World Award of Science]] given by the [[World Cultural Council]] (since 1984), the [[Albert Einstein Medal]] given by the [[Albert Einstein Society]] (since 1979), nor with the [[Hans Albert Einstein]] Award, named after his son and given by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (since 1988).<ref>[http://www.asce.org/pressroom/honors/honors_details.cfm?hdlid=19 Details about the Hans Albert Einstein Award], from the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] website (Last accessed on September 11, 2007).</ref> It was established much earlier than these, while Einstein was still alive and was a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study. It has been called "the highest of its kind in the United States" by ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>''New Scientist'' magazine, EBSCO Publishing, vol. 77, p. 272, 1978.</ref> Some considered it as "the prestigious equivalent of a [[Nobel Prize]]".<ref name="hawkingbio" />
