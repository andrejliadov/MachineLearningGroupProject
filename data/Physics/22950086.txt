The '''''Britney Spears' Guide to Semiconductor Physics''''' is an informative but [[tongue-in-cheek]] website designed to be instructive in [[semiconductor physics]].  Centered on the popularity and sex appeal of American pop singer [[Britney Spears]], it offers a humorous play on the teaching of [[physics]].  It was created by Carl Hepburn while a postgraduate at the [[University of Essex]].

The website has been featured on websites ranging from BBC News to MTV.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/1306364.stm | title=Britney makes physics sexy | date=1 May 2001 | publisher=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=2016-01-09}}</ref><ref name="MTV">{{cite news | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1493701/20041112/spears_britney.jhtml | title=Britney Spears Can Finally Add 'Professor Of Physics' To Her Resume | date=12 November 2004 | last=Montgomery | first=James | publisher=[[MTV]] | accessdate=2016-01-09}}</ref>
