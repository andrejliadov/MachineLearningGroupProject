The '''''Book of Optics''''' ({{lang-ar|كتاب المناظر|Kitāb al-Manāẓir}}; {{lang-la|De Aspectibus}} or ''Perspectiva''; {{lang-it|Deli Aspecti}}) is a seven-volume treatise on [[optics]] and other fields of study composed by the medieval Arab scholar [[Ibn al-Haytham]], known in the West as Alhazen or Alhacen (965–c.&nbsp;1040 AD).

The ''Book of Optics'' presented experimentally founded arguments against the widely held [[Emission theory (vision)|extramission theory]] of vision (as held by [[Euclid]] in his [[Euclid's Optics|''Optica'']]), and proposed the modern [[intromission theory]], the now accepted model that vision takes place by light entering the eye.<ref name="Lindberg,1976">D.

The book extensively affected the development of optics, [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] in Europe between the 13th and 17th centuries.<ref name="Smith 2001 lxxix">{{harv|Smith|2001|p=lxxix}}</ref>

==Vision theory==
Before the ''Book of Optics'' was written, two theories of vision existed. The extramission or [[emission theory]] was forwarded by the mathematicians [[Euclid]]<ref>[http://philomatica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Optics-of-Euclid.pdf Euclid's Optics]</ref> and [[Ptolemy]],<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/233604?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Smith, A.

Mark (1999) Ptolemy and the Foundations of Ancient Mathematical Optics: A Source Based Guided Study [[Transactions of the American Philosophical Society]] New Series, '''89'''(3) (1999) via JSTOR]</ref> who asserted that certain forms of radiation are emitted from the [[eyes]] onto the object which is being seen. When these [[Ray (optics)|rays]] reached the object they allowed the viewer to perceive its color, shape and size. An early version of the intromission theory, held by the followers of [[Aristotle]] and [[Galen]], argued that sight was caused by agents, which were transmitted to the eyes from either the object or from its surroundings.

[[Al-Haytham]] offered many reasons against the extramission theory, pointing to the fact that eyes can be damaged by looking directly at bright lights, such as the sun.<ref name="Lindberg,1992"/>{{rp|313–314}} He claimed the low probability that the eye can fill the entirety of space as soon as the eyelids are opened as an observer looks up into the night sky.<ref name="gale biography">{{cite web|title=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=RELEVANCE&inPS=true&prodId=GVRL&userGroupName=norm94900&tabID=T003&searchId=R1&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&contentSegment=&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&currentPosition=1&contentSet=GALE%7CCX2830901904&&docId=GALE%7CCX2830901904&docType=GALE|work=Ibn Al-Haytham, Abū ʿAlī Al-Ḥasan Ibn Al-Ḥasan|publisher=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830901904.html|title=Ibn Al-Haytham, Abū|work=[[HighBeam Research]]|access-date=26 December 2014}}</ref> Using the intromission theory as a foundation, he formed his own theory that an object emits rays of light from every point on its surface which then travel in all directions, thereby allowing some light into a viewer's eyes. According to this theory, the object being viewed is considered to be a compilation of an infinite number of points, from which rays of light are projected.<ref name=osler>{{cite book|last=Osler|first=Margaret J.|title=Reconfiguring the World|year=2010|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|page=103}}</ref><ref name="a mark smith">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=A.

==Light and color theory==
In the ''Book of Optics'', al-Haytham claimed the existence of primary and secondary light, with primary light being the stronger or more intense of the two. The book describes how the essential form of light comes from self-luminous bodies and that accidental light comes from objects that obtain and emit light from those self-luminous bodies. According to Ibn al-Haytham, primary light comes from self-luminous bodies and secondary light is the light that comes from accidental objects.<ref name="Lindberg,1992">{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David C.|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|url=https://archive.org/details/beginningsofwest00lind|url-access=registration|year=1992|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>{{rp|317}}<ref>A detailed study on Ibn al-Haytham's theory of colors is noted in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Ibn al-Haytham et le problème de la couleur', Oriens-Occidens: Cahiers du centre d'histoire des sciences et des philosophies arabes et médiévales, C.N.R.S. 7 (2009), pp. 201–226.</ref> Accidental light can only exist if there is a source of primary light. Both primary and secondary light travel in straight lines. Transparency is a characteristic of a body that can transmit light through them, such as air and water, although no body can completely transmit light or be entirely transparent. Opaque objects are those through which light cannot pass through directly, although there are degrees of opaqueness which determine how much light can actually pass through. Opaque objects are struck with light and can become luminous bodies themselves which radiate secondary light.  Light can be refracted by going through partially transparent objects and can also be reflected by striking smooth objects such as mirrors, traveling in straight lines in both cases.

Al-Haytham presented many experiments in ''Optics'' that upheld his claims about light and its transmission. He also claimed that color acts much like light, being a distinct quality of a form and travelling from every point on an object in straight lines.<ref>Refer to: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Ibn al-Haytham et le problème de la couleur', ''Oriens-Occidens: Cahiers du centre d'histoire des sciences et des philosophies arabes et médiévales, C.N.R.S.'' 7 (2009): 201–226; see also [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Grosseteste’s Meteorological Optics: Explications of the Phenomenon of the Rainbow after Ibn al-Haytham', in ''Robert Grosseteste and the Pursuit of Religious and Scientific Knowledge in the Middle Ages'', eds. J. Cunningham and M. Hocknull (Dordrecht: Springer, 2016), pp. 21-39.</ref> Through experimentation he concluded that color cannot exist without air.<ref name="gale biography" />

==Anatomy of the eye and visual process==
[[File:Alhazen1652.png|right|thumb|upright|The structure of the [[human eye]] according to Ibn al-Haytham. Note the depiction of the [[optic chiasm]]. —Manuscript copy of his Kitāb al-Manāẓir (MS Fatih 3212, vol. 1, fol. 81b, [[Süleymaniye Mosque]] Library, Istanbul)]]

As objects radiate light in straight lines in all directions, the eye must also be hit with this light over its outer surface. This idea presented a problem for al-Haytham and his predecessors, as if this was the case, the rays received by the eye from every point on the object would cause a blurred image. Al-Haytham solved this problem using his theory of refraction. He argued that although the object sends an infinite number of rays of light to the eye, only one of these lines falls on the eye perpendicularly: the other rays meet the eye at angles that are not perpendicular. According to al-Haytham, this causes them to be refracted and weakened. He claimed that all the rays other than the one that hits the eye perpendicularly are not involved in vision.<ref name=Lindberg,1992/>{{rp|315–316}}

In al-Haytham's structure of the eye, the crystalline humor is the part that receives light rays from the object and forms a visual cone, with the object being perceived as the base of the cone and the center of the crystalline humor in the eye as the vertex. Other parts of the eye are the aqueous humor in front of the crystalline humor and the vitreous humor at the back. These, however, do not play as critical of a role in vision as the crystalline humor. The crystalline humor transmits the image it perceives to the brain through an optic nerve.<ref name="gale biography" />

==Volumes==

*'''Book I''' deals with al-Haytham's theories on light, colors, and vision.<ref name="gale biography" />
*'''Book II''' is where al-Haytham presents his theory of visual perception.<ref name="gale biography" />
*'''Book III and Book VI''' present al-Haytham's ideas on the errors in visual perception with Book VI focusing on errors related to reflection.<ref name="gale biography" />
*'''Book IV and Book V''' provide experimental evidence for al-Haytham's theories on reflection.<ref name="gale biography" />
*'''Book VII''' deals with the concept of refraction.<ref name="gale biography" />

==Influence==
The ''Book of Optics'' was most strongly influenced by Ptolemy's [[Ptolemy#Optics|''Optics'']], while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based upon an account by Galen.<ref name="Smith 2001 lxxix"/>

The ''Book of Optics'' was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by an unknown scholar at the end of the 12th (or the beginning of the 13th) century.<ref name="Lindberg,1976"/>{{rp|209–10.}}<ref>{{Citation | last = Crombie | first = A.
