'''''Physics World''''' is the membership magazine of the [[Institute of Physics]], one of the largest physical societies in the world. It is an international monthly magazine covering all areas of physics, pure and applied, and is aimed at physicists in research, industry, [[physics outreach]], and education worldwide.

==Overview==
The magazine was launched in 1988 by [[IOP Publishing Ltd]], under the founding editorship of [[Philip Campbell (scientist)|Philip Campbell]].{{fact|date=March 2017}} The magazine is sent free to members of the [[Institute of Physics]], who can access a digital edition of the magazine; selected articles can be read by anyone for free online. It was redesigned in September 2005 and has an audited circulation of just under 35000.

The current editor is Matin Durrani.<ref>"[http://physicsworld.com/cws/our-team Our Team.]" ''Physics World''. Accessed December 15, 2017.</ref> Others on the team are Michael Banks (news editor), Louise Mayor (features editor), Margaret Harris (industry editor) and Tushna Commissariat (reviews and careers editor). Hamish Johnston is the editor of the magazine's website physicsworld.com. James Dacey is multimedia projects editor.

Alongside the print and online magazine, Physics World produces films and two podcasts. <ref>http://physicsworld.com/cws/channel/multimedia ''Physics World - Multimedia''.
