The '''International Association of Mathematical Physics''' ('''IAMP''') was founded in 1976 to promote research in mathematical physics. It brings together research [[Mathematics|mathematicians]] and [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]], including students. The association's ordinary members are individual researchers, although associate membership is available to organizations and companies. The IAMP is governed by an executive committee elected by the ordinary members.

The association sponsors the [[International Congress on Mathematical Physics]] (ICMP), which takes place every three years, and it also supports smaller conferences and workshops. There is a quarterly news bulletin.

IAMP currently awards two kinds of research prizes in mathematical physics at its triannual meetings, the [[Henri Poincaré Prize]] (created in 1997) and the Early Career Award (created in 2009).

== Prizes awarded by IAMP ==
=== Henri Poincaré Prize ===
The [[Henri Poincaré Prize]] is sponsored by the [[Daniel Iagolnitzer Foundation]] to recognize outstanding contributions in mathematical physics, and contributions which lay the groundwork for novel developments in this broad field. The Prize was also created to recognize and support young people of exceptional promise who have already made outstanding contributions to the field of [[mathematical physics]].

The prize is usually awarded to three individuals every three years at the [[International Congress on Mathematical Physics]] (ICMP). The prize committee is appointed by the IAMP.

=== IAMP Early Career Award ===
The prize is awarded at the [[International Congress on Mathematical Physics]] (ICMP) in recognition of a single achievement in Mathematical Physics, for scientists whose age is less than 35.
