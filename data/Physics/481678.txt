An '''Archimedean point''' ({{Lang-la|'''Punctum Archimedis'''|italic=no}}) is a [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] standpoint from which an observer can [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]] perceive the subject of [[inquiry]] with a [[Totality of the circumstances|view of totality]] (i.e., a '''god's-eye view'''); or a reliable starting point from which one may reason. In other words, a view from an Archimedean point describes the ideal of "removing oneself" from the [[Unit of observation|object of study]] so that one can see it in relation to all other things while remaining independent of them.<ref>[[Simon Blackburn|Blackburn, Simon]], ed.
