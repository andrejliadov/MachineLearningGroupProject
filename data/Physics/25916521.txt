Langmuir described the plasma he observed as follows:
:"''Except near the electrodes, where there are ''sheaths'' containing very few electrons, the ionized gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small.

Plasma is an electrically neutral medium of unbound positive and negative particles (i.e. the overall charge of a plasma is roughly zero). Although these particles are unbound, they are not "free" in the sense of not experiencing forces. Moving charged particles generate an electric current within a magnetic field, and any movement of a charged plasma particle affects and is affected by the fields created by the other charges. In turn this governs collective behaviour with many degrees of variation.<ref name="Sturrock">{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics: An Introduction to the Theory of Astrophysical, Geophysical & Laboratory Plasmas |last=Sturrock |first=Peter A. |date=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44810-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Framework of Plasma Physics |author=Hazeltine, R.D. |author2=Waelbroeck, F.L. |date=2004 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-7382-0047-7}}

===Temperature===
Plasma temperature is commonly measured in [[kelvin]] or [[electronvolt]]s and is, informally, a measure of the thermal kinetic energy per particle. High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization, which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionization is determined by the [[electron temperature]] relative to the [[ionization energy]] (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the [[Saha equation]]. At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states—atoms<ref name="Nicholson">{{cite book |title=Introduction to Plasma Theory |last=Nicholson |first= Dwight R. |date=1983 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-09045-8}}</ref>—and the plasma will eventually become a gas.

In most cases the electrons are close enough to [[thermal equilibrium]] that their temperature is relatively well-defined; this is true even when there is a significant deviation from a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] energy [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]], for example, due to [[UV radiation]], energetic particles, or strong [[electric field]]s. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may be very different from (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionized technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the [[ambient temperature]].

====Fully vs. partially (weakly) ionized gases====
{{main|Degree of ionization}}
{{see also|Spitzer resistivity}}
For plasma to exist, [[ionization]] is necessary. The term "plasma density" by itself usually refers to the "electron density", that is, the number of free electrons per unit volume. The [[degree of ionization]] of a plasma is the proportion of atoms that have lost or gained electrons, and is controlled by the electron and ion temperatures and electron-ion vs electron-neutral collision frequencies. The degree of ionization, <math>\alpha</math>, is defined as <math>\alpha = \frac{n_i}{n_i + n_n}</math>, where <math>n_i</math> is the number density of ions and <math>n_n</math> is the number density of neutral atoms. The ''electron density'' is related to this by the average charge state{{Explain|date=August 2018}} <math>\langle Z\rangle</math> of the ions through <math>n_e = \langle Z\rangle n_i</math>, where <math>n_e</math> is the number density of electrons.

In a plasma, the electron-ion collision frequency <math>\nu_{ei}</math> is much greater than the electron-neutral collision frequency <math>\nu_{en}</math>. Therefore, with a weak degree of ionization <math>\alpha</math>, the electron-ion collision frequency can equal the electron-neutral collision frequency: <math>\nu_{ei} = \nu_{en}</math> is the limit separating a plasma from being partially or fully ionized.

* The term ''fully ionized gas'' introduced by [[Lyman Spitzer]] does not mean the degree of ionization is unity, but only that the plasma is in a ''Coulomb-collision dominated regime'', i.e. when <math>\nu_{ei} > \nu_{en}</math>, which can correspond to a degree of ionization as low as 0.01%.<ref name="Chapman 1980">{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Brian |date=25 September 1980 |title=Glow Discharge Processes: Sputtering and Plasma Etching |chapter-url=https://fr.scribd.com/document/150525600/Brian-Chapman-Glow-Discharge-Processes |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=49 |chapter=Chapter 3: Plasmas |isbn=978-0471078289}}</ref>
* A ''partially'' or ''weakly ionized gas'' means the plasma is not dominated by [[Coulomb collision]]s, i.e. when <math>\nu_{ei} < \nu_{en}</math>.

Most of "technological" (engineered) plasmas are weakly ionized gases.

====Thermal vs. nonthermal (cold) plasmas====
{{main|Nonthermal plasma}}
{{see also|Anisothermal plasma}}
Based on the relative temperatures of the electrons, ions and neutrals, plasmas are classified as "thermal" or "non-thermal" (also referred to as "cold plasmas").

* ''Thermal plasmas'' have electrons and the heavy particles at the same temperature, i.e. they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
* ''Nonthermal plasmas'' on the other hand are non-equilibrium ionized gases, with two temperatures: ions and neutrals stay at a low temperature (sometimes [[room temperature]]), whereas electrons are much hotter. (<math>T_e \gg T_n</math>).<ref>von Engel, A. and Cozens, J.R. (1976) "Flame Plasma" in ''Advances in electronics and electron physics'', L. L.

A particular and unusual case of "inverse" nonthermal plasma is the very high temperature plasma produced by the [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]], where ions are much hotter than electrons.<ref name="haines_a">{{cite journal

Typically, lightning discharges 30 kiloamperes at up to 100 megavolts, and emits radio waves, light, X- and even gamma rays.<ref>See [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html Flashes in the Sky: Earth's Gamma-Ray Bursts Triggered by Lightning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707164546/http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/rhessi_tgf.html |date=7 July 2014 }}</ref> Plasma temperatures can approach 30000 K and electron densities may exceed 10<sup>24</sup> m<sup>−3</sup>.]]
Since plasmas are very good [[electrical conductor]]s, electric potentials play an important role.{{clarify|what role?|date=October 2017}} The average potential in the space between charged particles, independent of how it can be measured, is called the "plasma potential", or the "space potential". If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a [[Debye sheath]]. The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of "quasineutrality", which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma (<math>n_e = \langle Z\rangle n_i</math>), but on the scale of the [[Debye length]] there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that ''[[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]]'' are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net [[charge density]]. A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the [[Boltzmann relation]]:
:<math>n_e \propto e^{e\Phi/k_BT_e}.</math>

Differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:
:<math>\vec{E} = (k_BT_e/e)(\nabla n_e/n_e).</math>

It is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise, it will be dissipated by the repulsive [[electrostatic force]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Plasma science : from fundamental research to technological applications|date=1995|publisher=National Academy Press|others=National Research Council (U.S.). Panel on Opportunities in Plasma Science and Technology.|isbn=9780309052313|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=51|oclc=42854229}}</ref>

In [[astrophysical]] plasmas, [[electric field screening|Debye screening]] prevents [[electric field]]s from directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the [[Debye length]]. However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate, and be affected by, [[magnetic field]]s. This can and does cause extremely complex behaviour, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of [[Debye length]]s. The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated [[magnetic field]]s are studied in the [[academic discipline]] of [[magnetohydrodynamics]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dorch |first=Søren |date=2007-04-13 |title=Magnetohydrodynamics |journal=Scholarpedia |language=en |volume=2 |issue=4|pages=2295 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.2295 |issn=1941-6016 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=2007SchpJ...2.2295D|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Magnetization===
Plasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized. A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic field before making a collision, i.e., <math>\omega_{\mathrm{ce}} / v_{\mathrm{coll}} > 1</math>, where <math>\omega_{\mathrm{ce}}</math> is the "electron gyrofrequency" and <math>v_{\mathrm{coll}}</math> is the "electron collision rate". It is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not. Magnetized plasmas are ''[[anisotropic]]'', meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to it. While electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the high conductivity, the electric field associated with a plasma moving in a magnetic field is given by <math>\mathbf{E} = -v\times\mathbf{B}</math> (where <math>\mathbf{E}</math> is the electric field, <math>\mathbf{v}</math> is the velocity, and <math>\mathbf{B}</math> is the magnetic field), and is not affected by [[Debye shielding]].<ref>Richard Fitzpatrick, ''Introduction to Plasma Physics'', [http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html Magnetized plasmas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301073703/http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/lectures/node10.html |date=1 March 2006 }}</ref>

Plasma is often called the ''fourth state of matter'' after solid, liquids and gases, despite plasma typically being an ionized gas.<ref>{{cite book

Although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has no definite form or volume, it differs in a number of ways, including the following:

{| class="wikitable"

|-
! Independently acting species
| '''One''': All gas particles behave in a similar way, influenced by [[gravity]] and by [[collision]]s with one another.
| '''Two or three''': [[Electron]]s, [[ion]]s, [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can be distinguished by the sign and value of their [[electric charge|charge]] so that they behave independently in many circumstances, with different bulk velocities and temperatures, allowing phenomena such as new types of [[waves in plasma|waves]] and [[Instability|instabilities]].
|-
! Velocity distribution
| '''[[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]''': Collisions usually lead to a Maxwellian velocity distribution of all gas particles, with very few relatively fast particles.
| '''Often non-Maxwellian''': Collisional interactions are often weak in hot plasmas and external forcing can drive the plasma far from local equilibrium and lead to a significant population of unusually fast particles.
|-
! Interactions
| '''Binary''': Two-particle collisions are the rule, three-body collisions extremely rare.
| '''Collective''': Waves, or organized motion of plasma, are very important because the particles can interact at long ranges through the electric and magnetic forces.

==Complex plasma phenomena==

Although the underlying equations governing plasmas are relatively simple, plasma behaviour is extraordinarily varied and subtle: the emergence of unexpected behaviour from a simple model is a typical feature of a [[complex system]]. Such systems lie in some sense on the boundary between ordered and disordered behaviour and cannot typically be described either by simple, smooth, mathematical functions, or by pure randomness. The spontaneous formation of interesting spatial features on a wide range of length scales is one manifestation of plasma complexity. The features are interesting, for example, because they are very sharp, spatially intermittent (the distance between features is much larger than the features themselves), or have a [[fractal]] form. Many of these features were first studied in the laboratory, and have subsequently been recognized throughout the universe. Examples of complexity and complex structures in plasmas include:

Filamentation also refers to the self-focusing of a high power laser pulse. At high powers, the nonlinear part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction in the center of the laser beam, where the laser is brighter than at the edges, causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more. The tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness (irradiance) that forms a plasma. The plasma has an index of refraction lower than one, and causes a defocusing of the laser beam. The interplay of the focusing index of refraction, and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be [[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]] to kilometers in length.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Chin, S.

===Non-neutral plasma===
The strength and range of the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities of positive and negative charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a [[Non-neutral plasmas|non-neutral plasma]]. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged [[particle beam]]s, an electron cloud in a [[Penning trap]] and positron plasmas.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Greaves | first1 = R. G. | last2 = Tinkle | first2 = M.

===Dusty plasma/grain plasma===
A [[dusty plasma]] contains tiny charged particles of dust (typically found in space). The dust particles acquire high charges and interact with each other. A plasma that contains larger particles is called grain plasma. Under laboratory conditions, dusty plasmas are also called ''complex plasmas''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morfill |first1=G. E. |title= Complex plasmas: An interdisciplinary research field |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=81 |date=2009 |pages=1353–1404 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.1353|bibcode = 2009RvMP...81.1353M |first2=Alexei V. |last2=Ivlev |issue=4 }}</ref>

===Impermeable plasma===
Impermeable plasma is a type of thermal plasma which acts like an impermeable solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by [[Hannes Alfvén]] in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] plasma from the reactor walls.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alfvén |first1=H. |last2=Smårs |first2=E.|s2cid=26797662 |title= Gas-Insulation of a Hot Plasma |journal=Nature |volume=188 |date=1960 |pages=801–802 |doi=10.1038/188801a0|bibcode = 1960Natur.188..801A |issue=4753 }}</ref> However, later it was found that the external [[magnetic fields]] in this configuration could induce [[Kink instability|kink instabilities]] in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Braams |first1=C.M. |title= Stability of Plasma Confined by a Cold-Gas Blanket |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=17 |issue=9 |date=1966 |pages=470–471 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.17.470|bibcode = 1966PhRvL..17..470B }}</ref>
In 2013, a group of materials scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no [[magnetic confinement]] using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data on the characteristics of plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of different [[nanostructures]] clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of [[ions]] at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex [[nanomaterials]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yaghoubi |first1=A. |last2=Mélinon |first2=P.|title= Tunable synthesis and in situ growth of silicon-carbon mesostructures using impermeable plasma |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=3 |pages=1083 |date=2013 |doi=10.1038/srep01083|bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1083Y |pmid=23330064 |pmc=3547321}}</ref>

{{main|Plasma modeling}}
To completely describe the state of a plasma, all of the
particle locations and velocities that describe the electromagnetic field in the plasma region would need to be written down.
However, it is generally not practical or necessary to keep track of all the particles in a plasma.
Therefore, plasma physicists commonly use less detailed descriptions, of which
there are two main types:

===Fluid model===
Fluid models describe plasmas in terms of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see [[Plasma parameters]]). One simple fluid model, [[magnetohydrodynamics]], treats the plasma as a single fluid governed by a combination of [[Maxwell's equations]] and the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. A more general description is the two-fluid plasma,<ref>Roy, S., and Pandey, B. "Roy S. and Pandey, B.P. Numerical Investigation of a Hall Thruster Plasma, Physics of Plasmas, 9 (9) pp. 4052-60 (2002): https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1498261.</ref> where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or [[Double layer (plasma)|double layer]]s, nor resolve wave-particle effects.

===Kinetic model===
Kinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the [[particle-in-cell]] (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories of a large number of individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The [[Vlasov equation]] may be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.
In magnetized plasmas, a [[gyrokinetics|gyrokinetic]] approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of a fully kinetic simulation.

==Artificial plasmas==
Most artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric and/or magnetic fields through a gas. Plasma generated in a laboratory setting and for industrial use can be generally categorized by:
*The type of power source used to generate the plasma—DC, AC (typically with [[radio frequency]] ([[RF]])) and microwave
*The pressure they operate at—vacuum pressure (< 10&nbsp;mTorr or 1 Pa), moderate pressure (≈1&nbsp;Torr or 100 Pa), atmospheric pressure (760&nbsp;Torr or 100 kPa)
*The degree of ionization within the plasma—fully, partially, or weakly ionized
*The temperature relationships within the plasma—thermal plasma (<math>T_e = T_i = T_{gas}</math>), non-thermal or "cold" plasma (<math>T_e \gg T_i = T_{gas}</math>)
*The electrode configuration used to generate the plasma
*The magnetization of the particles within the plasma—magnetized (both ion and electrons are trapped in [[Gyroradius|Larmor orbits]] by the magnetic field), partially magnetized (the electrons but not the ions are trapped by the magnetic field), non-magnetized (the magnetic field is too weak to trap the particles in orbits but may generate [[Lorentz force]]s){{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Generation of artificial plasma===
[[File:Simple representation of a discharge tube - plasma.png|thumb]]
[[File:Plasma jacobs ladder.jpg|thumb|alt=Artificial plasma produced in air by a Jacob's Ladder|Artificial plasma produced in air by a [[Spark gap#Visual entertainment|Jacob's Ladder]]]]
Just like the many uses of plasma, there are several means for its generation. However, one principle is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it.<ref name="Hippler" /> For this case, plasma is generated when an [[electric current]] is applied across a [[dielectric gas]] or fluid (an electrically [[Electrical conductor|non-conducting]] material) as can be seen in the adjacent image, which shows a [[discharge tube]] as a simple example ([[direct current|DC]] used for simplicity).

The [[potential difference]] and subsequent [[electric field]] pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the [[anode]] (positive electrode) while the [[cathode]] (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus.<ref name="Chen">{{cite book |title=Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion |last=Chen |first=Francis F. |date=1984 |publisher=Plenum Press |isbn=978-0-306-41332-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&q=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115215631/https://books.google.com/books?id=WGbaBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:9PGss7GnX-MC&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimuOfm_pXXAhVrzFQKHTrOCaUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date=15 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As the [[voltage]] increases, the current stresses the material (by [[electric polarization]]) beyond its [[dielectric strength|dielectric limit]] (termed strength) into a stage of [[electrical breakdown]], marked by an [[electric spark]], where the material transforms from being an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] into a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] (as it becomes increasingly [[ionized]]). The underlying process is the [[Townsend avalanche]], where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as can be seen in the figure on the right). The first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons. Therefore, the number of charged particles increases rapidly (in the millions) only "after about 20 successive sets of collisions",<ref name="Leal-Quiros" /> mainly due to a small mean free path (average distance travelled between collisions).

====Electric arc====
[[File:Cascade-process-of-ionization.svg|thumb|Cascade process of ionization. Electrons are "e−", neutral atoms "o", and cations "+".|left]]
[[File:Townsend Discharge.svg|thumbnail|300px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionization event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionizing electron and the liberated electron.]]
With ample current density and ionization, this forms a luminous [[electric arc]] (a continuous electric discharge similar to [[lightning]]) between the electrodes.{{#tag:ref|The material undergoes various "regimes" or stages (e.g. saturation, breakdown, glow, transition and thermal arc) as the voltage is increased under the voltage-current relationship. The voltage rises to its maximum value in the saturation stage, and thereafter it undergoes fluctuations of the various stages; while the current progressively increases throughout.<ref name="Leal-Quiros">{{cite journal |author=Leal-Quirós, Edbertho |date=2004 |title=Plasma Processing of Municipal Solid Waste |journal= Brazilian Journal of Physics |volume=34 |issue=4B |pages=1587–1593 |bibcode = 2004BrJPh..34.1587L |doi=10.1590/S0103-97332004000800015|doi-access=free }}</ref>|group="Note"}} [[Electrical resistance]] along the continuous electric arc creates [[heat]], which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization is determined by temperature), and as per the sequence: [[solid]]-[[liquid]]-[[gas]]-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma.{{#tag:ref|Across literature, there appears to be no strict definition on where the boundary is between a gas and plasma. Nevertheless, it is enough to say that at 2,000°C the gas molecules become atomized, and ionized at 3,000 °C and "in this state, [the] gas has a liquid like viscosity at atmospheric pressure and the free electric charges confer relatively high electrical conductivities that can approach those of metals."<ref name="Gomez" />|group="Note"}} A thermal plasma is in [[thermal equilibrium]], which is to say that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, [[electrical energy]] is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by [[elastic collision]] (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.<ref name="Gomez" /><ref group="Note">Note that non-thermal, or non-equilibrium plasmas are not as ionized and have lower energy densities, and thus the temperature is not dispersed evenly among the particles, where some heavy ones remain "cold".</ref>

===Examples of industrial/commercial plasma===
Because of their sizable temperature and density ranges, plasmas find applications in many fields of research, technology and industry.

====Low-pressure discharges====
*''[[Glow discharge]] plasmas'': non-thermal plasmas generated by the application of DC or low frequency RF (<100&nbsp;kHz) electric field to the gap between two metal electrodes. Probably the most common plasma; this is the type of plasma generated within [[fluorescent light]] tubes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wfluor.html |title=The Fluorescent Lamp: A plasma you can use |author=Stern, David P. |access-date=2010-05-19 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530165958/http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wfluor.html |archive-date=30 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

====Atmospheric pressure====
*''[[Arc discharge]]:'' this is a high power thermal discharge of very high temperature (≈10,000 K). It can be generated using various power supplies. It is commonly used in [[Metallurgy|metallurgical]] processes. For example, it is used to smelt minerals containing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to produce [[aluminium]].
*''[[Corona discharge]]:'' this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the application of high voltage to sharp electrode tips. It is commonly used in [[ozone]] generators and particle precipitators.
*''[[Dielectric barrier discharge]] (DBD):'' this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the plasma discharge into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and has similar application to corona discharges.

*"[[Piezoelectric direct discharge plasma]]:" is a [[nonthermal plasma]] generated at the high-side of a piezoelectric transformer (PT). This generation variant is particularly suited for high efficient and compact devices where a separate high voltage power supply is not desired.

===MHD converters===
{{main|magnetohydrodynamic converter|magnetohydrodynamic generator|magnetohydrodynamic drive}}
{{see also|Electrothermal instability}}
A world effort was triggered in the 1960s to study [[magnetohydrodynamic converter]]s in order to bring [[magnetohydrodynamic generator|MHD power conversion]] to market with commercial power plants of a new kind, converting the [[kinetic energy]] of a high velocity plasma into [[electricity]] with no [[moving parts]] at a high [[efficiency]]. Research was also conducted in the field of supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics to study plasma interaction with magnetic fields to eventually achieve passive and even active [[Flow control (fluid)|flow control]] around vehicles or projectiles, in order to soften and mitigate [[shock wave]]s, lower thermal transfer and reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]].

Such ionized gases used in "plasma technology" ("technological" or "engineered" plasmas) are usually ''weakly ionized gases'' in the sense that only a tiny fraction of the gas molecules are ionized.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Plasma scattering of electromagnetic radiation : theory and measurement techniques|date=2011|publisher=Academic Press/Elsevier|others=Froula, Dustin H.|isbn=978-0080952031|edition=1st ed., 2nd|location=Burlington, MA|pages=273|oclc=690642377}}</ref> These kinds of weakly ionized gases are also nonthermal "cold" plasmas. In the presence of magnetics fields, the study of such magnetized nonthermal weakly ionized gases involves [[Magnetohydrodynamics#Ideal and resistive MHD|resistive magnetohydrodynamics]] with low [[magnetic Reynolds number]], a challenging field of plasma physics where calculations require [[dyadic tensor]]s in a [[n-dimensional space|7-dimensional]] [[phase space]]. When used in combination with a high [[Hall effect|Hall parameter]], a critical value triggers the problematic [[electrothermal instability]] which limited these technological developments.
