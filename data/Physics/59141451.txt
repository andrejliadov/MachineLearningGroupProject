'''Asimina Arvanitaki''' (born 1980) is a Greek [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and [[Stavros Niarchos Foundation]] [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] Chair in Theoretical Physics at the [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]] in [[Waterloo, Ontario]], Canada.<ref name="GandM">{{cite news |last1=Semeniuk |first1=Ivan |title=‘Brilliant’ physicist to hold $8-million research chair at Perimeter Institute |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/brilliant-physicist-to-hold-8-million-research-chair-at-perimeter-institute/article29795467/ |accessdate=24 November 2018 |agency=The Globe and Mail |date=April 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenationalherald.com/122833/arvanitaki-named-snf-chair-of-theoretical-physics-at-perimeter-institute/|title=Arvanitaki Named Aristarchus Chair - The National Herald|website=www.thenationalherald.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/people/asimina-arvanitaki|title=Asimina Arvanitaki {{!}} Perimeter Institute|website=www.perimeterinstitute.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-11-23}}</ref> In 2017, she was awarded the [[Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics|New Horizons in Physics]] prize.

== Areas of research ==
Arvanitaki's work has focused on finding novel experiments to explore topics in theoretical physics. Her work has been described as working at the "precision frontier" as it involves measuring very small variations in well-understood phenomena to illuminate theoretical predictions.<ref name="GandM" />

In 2016, Arvanitaki, [[Savas Dimopoulos]] and [[Ken Van Tilburg]] proposed a method of detecting dark matter as a matter wave, using conventional gravitational wave detectors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arvanitaki|first=Asimina|last2=Dimopoulos|first2=Savas|last3=Van Tilburg|first3=Ken|date=2016-01-22|title=Sound of Dark Matter: Searching for Light Scalars with Resonant-Mass Detectors|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.031102|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=116|issue=3|pages=031102|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.031102|arxiv=1508.01798}}</ref> She has proposed using the [[LIGO|Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory]]  to observe the gravitational waves from black hole collisions to detect the presence of [[Axion|QCD axions]], a candidate for explaining dark matter.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arvanitaki|first=Asimina|last2=Baryakhtar|first2=Masha|last3=Dimopoulos|first3=Savas|last4=Dubovsky|first4=Sergei|last5=Lasenby|first5=Robert|date=2017-02-08|title=Black hole mergers and the QCD axion at Advanced LIGO|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.95.043001|journal=Physical Review D|volume=95|issue=4|pages=043001|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.95.043001|arxiv=1604.03958}}</ref> She has also proposed using neutrino and gamma-ray telescopes, such as the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi telescope]], [[High Energy Stereoscopic System|Hess]], or [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory|IceCube]], to search for dark matter decay products predicted by certain theories of super-symmetry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arvanitaki|first=Asimina|last2=Dimopoulos|first2=Savas|last3=Dubovsky|first3=Sergei|last4=Graham|first4=Peter W.|last5=Harnik|first5=Roni|last6=Rajendran|first6=Surjeet|date=2009-09-09|title=Decaying dark matter as a probe of unification and TeV spectroscopy|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.80.055011|journal=Physical Review D|volume=80|issue=5|pages=055011|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.80.055011|arxiv=0904.2789}}</ref>

== Education and early career ==
Arvanitaki pursued her post-doctoral research at [[Stanford University]]. She joined the Perimeter Institute in 2014.<ref name="GandM" /> She is the first woman to hold a named chair at the institute. Arvanitaki suggested naming the chair for [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] — the ancient Greek astronomer who surmised that the Earth rotated around the sun centuries before Coperniucs — in a nod to the cosmological scope of her research, the Greek background of the [[Stavros Niarchos Foundation]], and her own Greek origin.<ref name="GandM" />
