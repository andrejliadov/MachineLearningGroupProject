'''Acoustic holography''' is a method for estimating the sound field near a source by measuring [[Acoustics|acoustic]] parameters away from the source by means of an array of [[pressure]] and/or [[particle velocity]] [[transducers]].  The Measuring techniques included in acoustic [[holography]] are becoming increasingly popular in various fields, most notably those of transportation, vehicle and aircraft design, and [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH).  The general idea of acoustic holography has led to different versions such as near-field acoustic holography (NAH) and statistically optimal near-field acoustic holography (SONAH).

For audio rendering and production, [[Wave_field_synthesis|Wave Field Synthesis]] and Higher Order [[Ambisonics]] are related technologies, respectively modelling the acoustic pressure field on a plane, or in a spherical volume.
