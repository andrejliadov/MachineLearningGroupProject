The '''Boltzmann Medal''' (or '''Boltzmann Award''') is a prize awarded to [[physicist]]s that obtain new results concerning [[statistical mechanics]]; it is named after the celebrated physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. The Boltzmann Medal is awarded once every three years by the ''Commission on Statistical Physics of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]]'', during the [[Statphys|STATPHYS]] conference.

The award consists of a gilded medal; its front carries the inscription ''Ludwig Boltzmann, 1844--1906''.
