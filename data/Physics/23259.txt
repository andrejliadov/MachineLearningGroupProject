{{Standard model of particle physics|Background}}
'''Particle physics''' (also known as '''high energy physics''') is a branch of [[physics]] that studies the nature of the particles that constitute [[matter]] and [[radiation]]. Although the word ''[[particle]]'' can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. [[protons]], gas particles, or even household dust), {{em|particle physics}} usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the [[fundamental interaction]]s necessary to explain their behaviour. In current understanding, these [[elementary particle]]s are excitations of the [[Field (physics)#Quantum fields|quantum fields]] that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the [[Standard Model]]. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest "known" particle, the [[Higgs boson]], or even to the oldest known force field, [[gravity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/higgs-boson|title=The Higgs Boson |publisher=CERN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2013/advanced-physicsprize2013.pdf | title=The BEH-Mechanism, Interactions with Short Range Forces and Scalar Particles | date=8 October 2013}}</ref>

==Subatomic particles==
[[Image:Standard Model of Elementary Particles Anti.svg|right|350px|thumb|The particle content of the [[Standard Model]] of [[Physics]]]]
Modern particle physics research is focused on [[subatomic particle]]s, including atomic constituents such as [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, and [[neutron]]s (protons and neutrons are composite particles called [[baryon]]s, made of [[quark]]s), produced by [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] and [[scattering]] processes, such as [[photon]]s, [[neutrino]]s, and [[muon]]s, as well as a wide range of [[exotic particle]]s.
Dynamics of particles are also governed by [[quantum mechanics]]; they exhibit [[wave–particle duality]], displaying particle-like behaviour under certain experimental conditions and [[wave]]-like behaviour in others. In more technical terms, they are described by [[quantum state]] vectors in a [[Hilbert space]], which is also treated in [[quantum field theory]]. Following the convention of particle physicists, the term ''[[elementary particle]]s'' is applied to those particles that are, according to current understanding, presumed to be indivisible and not composed of other particles.<ref name="braibant"/>

All particles and their interactions observed to date can be described almost entirely by a quantum field theory called the [[Standard Model]].<ref name="ifj">{{cite web|title=Particle Physics and Astrophysics Research|url=http://www.ifj.edu.pl/pro/fiz_astro.php?lang=en|publisher=The Henryk Niewodniczanski Institute of Nuclear Physics|accessdate=31 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002173825/http://www.ifj.edu.pl/pro/fiz_astro.php?lang=en|archive-date=2 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Standard Model, as currently formulated, has 61 elementary particles.<ref name="braibant">

Those elementary particles can combine to form composite particles, accounting for the hundreds of other species of particles that have been discovered since the 1960s.

The Standard Model has been found to agree with almost all the [[experiment]]al tests conducted to date. However, most particle physicists believe that it is an incomplete description of nature and that a more fundamental theory awaits discovery (See [[Theory of Everything]]). In recent years, measurements of [[neutrino]] [[rest mass|mass]] have provided the first experimental deviations from the Standard Model, since neutrinos are massless in the Standard Model.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neutrinos in the Standard Model|url=https://t2k-experiment.org/neutrinos/in-the-standard-model|publisher=The T2K Collaboration|accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>

==History==
{{Modern physics}}
{{main|History of subatomic physics}}
The idea that all [[matter]] is fundamentally composed of [[elementary particle]]s dates from at least the 6th century BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://novelresearchinstitute.org/library/PhysNuclphys196p.pdf |title=Fundamentals of Physics and Nuclear Physics |accessdate=21 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002214053/http://novelresearchinstitute.org/library/PhysNuclphys196p.pdf |archivedate=2 October 2012}}</ref> In the 19th century, [[John Dalton]], through his work on [[stoichiometry]], concluded that each element of nature was composed of a single, unique type of particle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sciexplorer.blogspot.com/2012/05/quasiparticles.html |title=Scientific Explorer: Quasiparticles |publisher=Sciexplorer.blogspot.com |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=21 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419032637/http://sciexplorer.blogspot.com/2012/05/quasiparticles.html |archive-date=19 April 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The word ''[[atom]]'', after the Greek word ''[[wikt:ἄτομος|atomos]]'' meaning "indivisible", has since then denoted the smallest particle of a [[chemical element]], but physicists soon discovered that atoms are not, in fact, the fundamental particles of nature, but are conglomerates of even smaller particles, such as the [[electron]]. The early 20th century explorations of [[nuclear physics]] and [[quantum physics]] led to proofs of [[nuclear fission]] in 1939 by [[Lise Meitner]] (based on experiments by [[Otto Hahn]]), and [[nuclear fusion]] by [[Hans Bethe]] in that same year; both discoveries also led to the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, a bewildering variety of particles were found in collisions of particles from beams of increasingly high energy. It was referred to informally as the "[[particle zoo]]". That term was deprecated{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} after the formulation of the Standard Model during the 1970s, in which the large number of particles was explained as combinations of a (relatively) small number of more fundamental particles.

==Standard Model==
{{Main|Standard Model}}
The current state of the classification of all elementary particles is explained by the [[Standard Model]], which gained widespread acceptance in the mid-1970s after [[experimental confirmation]] of the existence of [[quark]]s. It describes the [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]], and [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[fundamental interaction]]s, using mediating [[gauge boson]]s. The species of gauge bosons are eight [[gluon]]s, [[W and Z bosons|{{SubatomicParticle|W boson-}}, {{SubatomicParticle|W boson+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Z boson}} bosons]], and the [[photon]].<ref name=ifj /> The Standard Model also contains 24 [[fundamental particle|fundamental]] [[fermion]]s (12 particles and their associated anti-particles), which are the constituents of all [[matter]].<ref name=pdg>{{cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=K|title=Review of Particle Physics|journal=Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics|date=1 July 2010|volume=37|issue=7A|page=075021|doi=10.1088/0954-3899/37/7A/075021|pmid=10020536|bibcode = 2010JPhG...37g5021N |doi-access=free}}</ref> Finally, the Standard Model also predicted the existence of a type of [[boson]] known as the [[Higgs boson]]. On 4 July 2012, physicists with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN announced they had found a new particle that behaves similarly to what is expected from the Higgs boson.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mann |first=Adam |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/07/higgs-boson-discovery/ |title=Newly Discovered Particle Appears to Be Long-Awaited Higgs Boson |journal=Wired Science |date=28 March 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref>

The techniques required for modern experimental particle physics are quite varied and complex, constituting a sub-specialty nearly completely distinct{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} from the theoretical side of the field.

==Theory==
{{Quantum field theory|cTopic=Standard model}}
'''Theoretical particle physics''' attempts to develop the models, theoretical framework, and mathematical tools to understand current experiments and make predictions for future experiments (see also [[theoretical physics]]). There are several major interrelated efforts being made in theoretical particle physics today.

One important branch attempts to better understand the [[Standard Model]] and its tests. By extracting the parameters of the Standard Model, from experiments with less uncertainty, this work probes the limits of the Standard Model and therefore expands scientific understanding of nature's building blocks. Those efforts are made challenging by the difficulty of calculating quantities in [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Some theorists working in this area refer to themselves as '''[[Particle physics phenomenology|phenomenologists]]''' and they may use the tools of [[quantum field theory]] and [[effective field theory]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} Others make use of [[lattice field theory]] and call themselves ''lattice theorists''.

Another major effort is in model building where [[model building (particle physics)|model builders]] develop ideas for what physics may lie [[beyond the Standard Model]] (at higher energies or smaller distances). This work is often motivated by the [[hierarchy problem]] and is constrained by existing experimental data.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} It may involve work on [[supersymmetry]], alternatives to the [[Higgs mechanism]], extra spatial dimensions (such as the [[Randall–Sundrum model]]s), [[Preon]] theory, combinations of these, or other ideas.

A third major effort in theoretical particle physics is [[string theory]]. ''String theorists'' attempt to construct a unified description of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] by building a theory based on small strings, and [[branes]] rather than particles. If the theory is successful, it may be considered a "[[Theory of Everything]]", or "TOE".

There are also other areas of work in theoretical particle physics ranging from [[Particle physics in cosmology|particle cosmology]] to [[loop quantum gravity]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

This division of efforts in particle physics is reflected in the names of categories on the [[arXiv]], a [[preprint]] archive:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arxiv.org|title=arXiv.org e-Print archive}}</ref> hep-th (theory), hep-ph (phenomenology), hep-ex (experiments), hep-lat ([[lattice gauge theory]]).

==Practical applications==
In principle, all physics (and practical applications developed therefrom) can be derived from the study of fundamental particles. In practice, even if "particle physics" is taken to mean only "high-energy atom smashers", many technologies have been developed during these pioneering investigations that later find wide uses in society. Particle accelerators are used to produce [[Isotopes in medicine|medical isotopes]] for research and treatment (for example, isotopes used in [[PET imaging]]), or used directly in [[external beam radiotherapy]]. The development of [[superconductor]]s has been pushed forward by their use in particle physics. The [[World Wide Web]] and [[touchscreen]] technology were initially developed at [[CERN]]. Additional applications are found in medicine, national security, industry, computing, science, and workforce development, illustrating a long and growing list of beneficial practical applications with contributions from particle physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fnal.gov/pub/science/benefits/ |title=Fermilab &#124; Science at Fermilab &#124; Benefits to Society |publisher=Fnal.gov |accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref>

==Future==
The primary goal, which is pursued in several distinct ways, is to find and understand what physics may lie [[beyond the standard model]]. There are several powerful experimental reasons to expect new physics, including [[dark matter]] and [[neutrino mass]]. There are also theoretical hints that this new physics should be found at accessible energy scales.

Much of the effort to find this new physics are focused on new collider experiments. The [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) was completed in 2008 to help continue the search for the [[Higgs boson]], [[supersymmetric particle]]s, and other new physics. An intermediate goal is the construction of the [[International Linear Collider]] (ILC), which will complement the LHC by allowing more precise measurements of the properties of newly found particles. In August 2004, a decision for the technology of the ILC was taken but the site has still to be agreed upon.

In addition, there are important non-collider experiments that also attempt to find and understand [[physics beyond the Standard Model]]. One important non-collider effort is the determination of the [[neutrino]] masses, since these masses may arise from neutrinos mixing with very heavy particles. In addition, [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] observations provide many useful constraints on the dark matter, although it may be impossible to determine the exact nature of the dark matter without the colliders. Finally, lower bounds on the very long [[proton decay|lifetime of the proton]] put constraints on [[Grand Unified Theory|Grand Unified Theories]] at energy scales much higher than collider experiments will be able to probe any time soon.

In May 2014, the [[Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel]] released its report on particle physics funding priorities for the United States over the next decade. This report emphasized continued U.S. participation in the LHC and ILC, and expansion of the [[Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment]], among other recommendations.

==High energy physics compared to low energy physics==
The term ''high energy physics'' requires elaboration. Intuitively, it might seem incorrect to associate "high energy" with the physics of very small, ''low'' [[mass]] objects, like subatomic particles. By comparison, an example of a [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] system, one [[gram]] of [[hydrogen]], has ~ {{val|6|e=23}} times<ref>[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?na "CODATA Value: Avogadro constant"]. The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty. US National Institute of Standards and Technology. June 2015. Retrieved 2016-12-10.</ref> the mass of a single proton. Even an entire [[particle beam|beam]] of protons circulated in the LHC contains ~ {{val|3.23|e=14|u=}} protons,<ref name="lhcbeam">{{cite web|title=Beam Requirements and Fundamental Choices |url=http://edms.cern.ch/ui/file/445762/3/Vol3_Chap2_v4.pdf|publisher=CERN Engineering & Equipment Data Management Service (EDMS)|accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref> each with {{val|6.5|e=12|u=[[electronvolt|eV]]}} of energy, for a total beam energy of ~ {{val|2.1|e=27|u=eV}} or ~ 336.4 [[megajoule|MJ]], which is still ~ {{val|2.7|e=5}} times lower than the mass-energy of a single gram of hydrogen. Yet, the macroscopic realm is "low energy physics",{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} while that of quantum particles is "high energy physics".

The interactions studied in other fields of physics and science have comparatively very low energy. For example, the [[photon energy]] of [[visible light]] is about 1.8 to 3.1 eV. Similarly, the [[bond-dissociation energy]] of a [[carbon–carbon bond]] is about 3.6 eV. Other [[chemical reaction]]s typically involve similar amounts of energy. Even photons with far higher energy, [[gamma ray]]s of the kind produced in [[radioactive decay]], mostly have photon energy between {{val||e=5|u=eV}} and {{val||e=7|u=eV}} – still two [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] lower than the mass of a single proton. Radioactive decay gamma rays are considered as part of [[nuclear physics]], rather than high energy physics.

The proton has a mass of around {{val|9.4|e=8|u=eV}}; some other massive quantum particles, both elementary and [[hadron]]ic, have yet higher masses. Due to these very high energies ''at the single particle level'', particle physics is, in fact, high-energy physics.
