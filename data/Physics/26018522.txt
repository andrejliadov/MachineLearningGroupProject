The '''Physics Instructional Association''' ('''PIRA'''<ref>http://physicslearning2.colorado.edu/pira/</ref>) is an association of [[physics education]] professionals and enthusiasts.  Members are physics teachers, physics administrators, physics educational support staff and physics students.  Interests cover all aspects of physics education with an emphasis on [[Demonstration (teaching)|demonstrations]], [[laboratory|laboratories]] and outreach.

The association is also responsible for maintaining the Demonstration Classification Scheme (DCS), a standardized scheme for categorization of physics demonstrations.

==Affiliations==
PIRA holds annual meetings during the summer meeting of the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]].  It is sponsored by the Apparatus Committee and annually hosts the Lecture Demonstration Workshop.  PIRA assists or hosts the Physics Demonstrations Show at each summer meeting when the hosting institution requests.

==Demonstration bibliography==
PIRA has continually updated the Demonstration Bibliography since its inception in the 1980s.  It is based on a unique numbering system called the Demonstration Classification Scheme (DCS).<ref>http://physicslearning.colorado.edu/PiraHome/dcs/PIRADCS.html</ref>  The scheme originated from the demonstrations catalog used at the University of Minnesota.

PIRA has also generated a subset of this list called the PIRA 200.<ref>http://physicslearning2.colorado.edu/pira/resources/pira-200</ref>  These 200 demonstrations are the recommended basic collection for any physics department.
