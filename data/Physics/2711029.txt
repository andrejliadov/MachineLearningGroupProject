'''Physics education''' refers to the methods currently used to teach [[physics]]. [[Physics Education Research]] refers to an area of pedagogical research that seeks to improve those methods. Historically, physics has been taught at the high school and college level primarily by the lecture method together with laboratory exercises aimed at verifying concepts taught in the lectures. These concepts are better understood when lectures are accompanied with demonstration, hand-on experiments, and questions that require students to ponder what will happen in an experiment and why. Students who participate in [[active learning]] for example with hands-on experiments learn through self-discovery. By trial and error they learn to change their preconceptions about phenomena in physics and discover the underlying concepts.

==Ancient Greece==
[[Aristotle]] wrote what is considered now as the first textbook of physics.<ref>{{citation |title= The Physics of Sports |volume= 1 |author= Angelo Armenti |edition= 2, illustrated |publisher= Springer |year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-88318-946-7 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CPosYIEgag8C&pg=PR17 }} citing R.B Lindsay, ''Basic concepts of Physics'' (Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York, 1971), Appendix 1</ref> Aristotle's ideas were taught unchanged until the [[Late Middle Ages]], when scientists started making discoveries that didn't fit them. For example, [[Copernicus]]' discovery contradicted Aristotle's idea of an Earth-centric universe. Aristotle's ideas about motion weren't displaced until the end of the 17th century, when [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] published his ideas.

Today's physics students keep thinking of physics concepts in Aristotelian terms, despite being taught only Newtonian concepts.<ref>{{citation|title=Common sense concepts about motion |author1=Ibrahim Abou Halloun |author2=David Hestenes |journal=American Journal of Physics |year=1985 |volume=53 |issue=11 |pages=1056–1065 |url=http://modeling.la.asu.edu/halloun/pdf/CSBelief.pdf |bibcode=1985AmJPh..53.1056H |doi=10.1119/1.14031 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911225910/http://modeling.la.asu.edu/halloun/PDF/Csbelief.pdf |archive-date=September 11, 2006 }} as cited by many scholar books</ref>

==Hong Kong==
===High schools===
In [[Hong Kong]], physics is a subject for public examination. Local students in Form 6 take the public exam of [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]] (HKDSE).<ref name=hkdse>{{Cite web|title=Introduction to HKDSE Physics Examination|url=http://www.hkeaa.edu.hk/en/hkdse/assessment/subject_information/category_a_subjects/hkdse_subj.html?A2&2&20|accessdate=1 May 2020|publisher=[[Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority]]}}</ref>

Compare to the other syllabus include GCSE, GCE etc which learn wider and boarder of different topics, the Hong Kong syllabus is learning more deeply and more challenges with calculations.<ref name=edb /> Topics are narrow down to a smaller amount compared to the A-level due to the insufficient teaching hours at secondary schools in Hong Kong, which include [[temperature]], [[heat]], [[internal energy]], [[change of state]], [[gases]], [[Position (geometry)|position]], [[motion]], [[force]], [[projectile motion]], [[Work (physics)|work]], [[energy]], [[Power (physics)|power]], [[momentum]], [[uniform circular motion]], [[gravitation]], [[wave]], [[light]], [[sound]], [[electrostatics]], [[Electrical network|circuits]], [[electromagnetism]], [[radiation]], [[radioactivity]], [[atomic model]], [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], [[universe]], [[astronomy]], [[stars]], [[Rutherford model]], [[photoelectric effect]], [[Bohr model]], [[particles]], [[nanoscopic scale]], [[building]], [[transportation]], [[renewable energy sources]], [[eye]], [[ear]], [[non-ionizing radiation]] and [[ionizing radiation]] etc.<ref name=edb>{{Cite web|title=Introduction to HKDSE Physics|url=https://www.edb.gov.hk/tc/curriculum-development/kla/science-edu/curriculum-documents.html|accessdate=1 May 2020|publisher=[[Education Bureau]]}}</ref>

Some schools only allow students choose physics as elective subject since Form 4<ref name=nams>{{Cite web|title=Example of a school in Hong Kong that allows students choose Physics as elective subject since Form 4, as well as an example of school use Chinese language to teach Physics|url=http://www.nams.edu.hk/documents/subject/phy.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2020|publisher=[[New Asia Middle School]]}}</ref>, some schools provide physics compulsory curriculum in Form 3 and then allow students to choose in Form 4<ref name=stss>{{Cite web|title=Example of a school in Hong Kong that provides Physics compulsory curriculum in Form 3, as well as an example of school use English language to teach Physics|url=http://www.stteresa.edu.hk/tc/subject/課程|accessdate=1 May 2020|publisher=[[St. Teresa Secondary School]]}}</ref>, and some other schools allow students choose physics as elective subject since Form 3.<ref name=a_MainBooklet_2019_final>{{cite book |title=Example of a school in Hong Kong that allows students choose Physics as elective subject since Form 3|date=2019|publisher=[[YMCA of Hong Kong Christian College]]|url=https://www.yhkcc.edu.hk/filemanager/ymcacc_newsletters/en/upload/74/a_MainBooklet_2019_final.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2020}}</ref> Also, most schools use [[English language]] as the medium of instruction for physics<ref name=stss /><ref name=a_MainBooklet_2019_final />, whereas a few of the schools use [[Chinese language]] as the medium of instruction for physics<ref name=nams />.

Other than having lectures in classrooms or laboratories, schools in Hong Kong organise outside-school activities to motivate students learning Physics.<ref name=phycorner>{{Cite web|title=Physics Corner|url=https://www.yhkcc.edu.hk/en/news_events/event_highlights/index.php?id=467|accessdate=1 May 2020|publisher=[[YMCA of Hong Kong Christian College]]}}</ref>

===Universities===
Pure Physics major programmes are provided in the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK)<ref name=cuhk>{{Cite web|title=Department of Physics|url=http://www.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/new/index.html|accessdate=1 May 2020|publisher=[[Chinese University of Hong Kong]]}}</ref>, [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] (HKUST)<ref name=hkust>{{Cite web|title=Department of Physics|url=http://physics.ust.hk/eng/|accessdate=1 May 2020|publisher=[[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]]}}</ref> and [[University of Hong Kong]] (HKU).<ref name=hku>{{Cite web|title=Department of Physics|url=https://www.physics.hku.hk|accessdate=1 May 2020|publisher=[[University of Hong Kong]]}}</ref> Topics include [[engineering physics]], [[mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]], [[fluids]], [[wave]], [[optics]], [[modern physics]], [[laboratory]], [[heat]], [[electromagnetism]], [[quantitative methods]], [[computational physics]], [[astronomy]], [[astrophysics]], [[classical mechanics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum information]], [[statistical physics]], [[theoretical physics]], [[computer simulation]], [[soft matter]], [[practical electronics]], [[Contemporary Physics|contemporary physics]], [[instrumentation]], [[statistical mechanics]], [[solid state physics]], [[meteorology]], [[nanoscience]], [[optical physics]], [[theory of relativity]] and [[particle physics]] etc.<ref name=cuhk2>{{Cite web|title=Course List|url=http://www.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/new/student/uginfo.html#scheme|accessdate=1 May 2020|publisher=[[Chinese University of Hong Kong]]}}</ref>

There are different approaches of delivering physics lectures in different universities in Hong Kong. In CUHK, most relevant knowledge including [[quantitative methods]] and [[computer simulation]] are learnt in the Department of Physics, which may let the students learn deeper into the concept that applied to the physics problems<ref name=cuhk2 />, whereas in HKUST, [[quantitative methods]] and [[computer simulation]] are learnt by students in the courses delivered by Department of [[Mathematics]] and Department of [[Computer Science]] respectively which allow the students to learn boarder with knowledge of different aspects.<ref name=hkust2>{{Cite web|title=	BSc in Physics|url=http://physics.ust.hk/eng/detail.php?catid=3&sid=7&tid=28|accessdate=1 May 2020|publisher=[[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]]}}</ref>

There are also Enrichment Stream in Theoretical Physics offered by CUHK<ref name=cuhk3>{{Cite web|title=ADMISSION|url=http://www.phy.cuhk.edu.hk/new/admission/undergraduate.html|accessdate=1 May 2020|publisher=[[Chinese University of Hong Kong]]}}</ref> and International Research Enrichment Track offered by HKUST<ref name=hkust2 />. In that stream, additional topics include [[astrophysics]], [[particle physics]], [[computational physics]], and [[quantum physics]]. The practices of solving theoretical systems and the discussions of physical insight are very in-depth, which promote the graduates into a high level of the understanding of physics. However, the working opportunity for graduates with theoretical background in Hong Kong is too narrow. Most graduates pursue further studies overseas or become teachers.<ref name=cuhk3 />

Moreover, Applied Physics major programmes are offered only in most other universities in [[Hong Kong]].

==Teaching strategies==
Teaching strategies are the various techniques used by the teachers to facilitate the students with different [[learning styles]].
The different teaching strategies help teachers to develop critical thinking among students and effectively engaging them in the classroom.
The selection of teaching strategies depends on the concept to be taught and also on the interest of the students.

'''Methods/Approaches for teaching physics'''
* Lecture Method:  Lecturing is the one of the traditional way of teaching science. Since most teachers are taught by this method they continue to use the method in spite of many limitations as it is very much convenient. This method is teacher centric and the role of the lecturer is supreme. Lecture method is ineffective in developing critical thinking and scientific attitude among children.
* Recitation Method: In this method the role of student is more compared to the lecture method. This method is also known as [[Socratic Method]] where the teacher will ask questions and trigger the thoughts of the students. This method is very effective in developing higher order thinking in pupils. To apply this strategy the children should be partially informed about the content. Recitation method will be ineffective if the questions are not well prepared. This method is student centric.
* Demonstration Method: In this method the teacher perform certain experiments which students observe and put questions related to the experiment. After completion the teacher can ask questions to explain each and every step that is performed. This method is effective as science is not completely a theoretical subject.
* Lecture-cum-Demonstration method: As the title suggest it is the combination of two methods lecture method and demonstration method. It is a simple method where the teacher perform the [[experiment]] and explain simultaneously. By this method the teacher can provide more information in less time. But the learners only observe, they don't get hands on experience. And it is not possible to teach all topics by this method.<ref>{{cite book|last1=vaidya|title=Science teaching for the 21st century|publisher=Deep & Deep publications|isbn=978-8171008117|pages=181–201|year=1999}}</ref>
