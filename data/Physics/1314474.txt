{{short description|List of states of matter}}
[[State of matter|States of matter]] are distinguished by changes in the properties of matter associated with external factors like [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. States are usually distinguished by a discontinuity in one of those properties: for example, raising the temperature of ice produces a discontinuity at 0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F) as energy goes into a [[phase transition]], rather than temperature increase. The classical states of matter are usually summarized as: [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. In the 20th century, increased understanding of the more exotic properties of matter resulted in the identification of many additional states of matter, none of which are observed in [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|normal conditions]].

==Low-energy states==
===Natural states===
* '''[[Solid]]''':  A solid holds a definite shape and [[volume]] without a container. The particles are held very close to each other.
**'''[[Amorphous solid]]''': A solid in which there is no far-range order of the positions of the atoms.
** '''[[Crystal|Crystalline solid]]''': A solid in which atoms, molecules, or ions are packed in regular order.
** '''[[Plastic crystal]]''': A molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom.
** '''[[Quasi-crystal]]''': A solid in which the positions of the atoms have long-range order, but this is not in a repeating pattern.
* '''[[Liquid]]''': A mostly non-compressible [[fluid]]. Able to conform to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure.
**'''[[Liquid crystal]]''': Properties intermediate between liquids and crystals. Generally, able to flow like a liquid but exhibiting long-range order.
** '''[[Non-Newtonian fluid]]''': a [[fluid]] that does not follow Newton's law of viscosity.
* '''[[Gas]]''': A compressible fluid. Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.
* '''[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]]''': Free charged particles, usually in equal numbers, such as ions and electrons. Unlike gases, plasma may self-generate magnetic fields and electric currents, and respond strongly and collectively to [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic forces]]. Plasma is very uncommon on Earth (except for the [[ionosphere]]), although it is the most common state of matter in the universe.<ref>{{cite book |last= A.

===Modern states===
* '''[[Supercritical fluid]]''': At sufficiently high temperatures and pressures the distinction between liquid and gas disappears.
* '''[[Excited state|Excitation]]:''' the application of energy to a particle, object, or physical system.
* '''[[Degenerate matter]]''': matter under very high pressure, supported by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].
** '''[[Electron-degenerate matter]]''': found inside [[white dwarf]] stars. Electrons remain bound to atoms but are able to transfer to adjacent atoms.
** '''[[Neutron-degenerate matter]]''': found in [[neutron star]]s. Vast gravitational pressure compresses atoms so strongly that the electrons are forced to combine with protons via inverse beta-decay, resulting in a super dense conglomeration of neutrons. (Normally [[Neutron|free neutrons]] outside an atomic nucleus will [[Radioactive decay|decay]] with a half-life of just under 15 minutes, but in a neutron star, as in the nucleus of an atom, other effects stabilize the neutrons.)
** '''[[Strange matter]]''': A type of [[quark matter]] that may exist inside some neutron stars close to the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]] (approximately 2–3 [[solar mass]]es). May be stable at lower energy states once formed.
**'''[[Quantum spin Hall effect|Quantum spin Hall state]]''': a theoretical phase that may pave the way for the development of electronic devices that dissipate less energy and generate less heat. This is a derivation of the quantum Hall state of matter.
* '''[[Bose–Einstein condensate]]''': a phase in which a large number of [[boson]]s all inhabit the same [[quantum state]], in effect becoming one single wave/particle.  This is a low energy phase that can only be formed in laboratory conditions and in very cold temperatures. It must be close to zero Kelvin, or [[absolute zero]]. [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] and [[Albert Einstein]] predicted the existence of such a state in the 1920s, but it was not observed until 1995 by [[Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]].
* '''[[Fermionic condensate]]''': Similar to the Bose-Einstein condensate but composed of [[fermion]]s, also known as Fermi-Dirac condensate. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] prevents fermions from entering the same quantum state, but a pair of fermions can behave like a boson, and multiple such pairs can then enter the same quantum state without restriction.
* '''[[Superconductivity]]''': is a phenomenon of exactly zero [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]] and expulsion of [[magnetic field]]s occurring in certain materials when [[:wikt:cooling|cooled]] below a characteristic [[Phase transition|critical temperature]]. Superconductivity is the ground state of many elemental metals.
* '''[[Superfluid]]''': A phase achieved by a few [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] liquids at extreme temperature at which they become able to flow without [[friction]]. A superfluid can flow up the side of an open container and down the outside. Placing a superfluid in a spinning container will result in [[quantum vortex|quantized vortices]].
* '''[[Supersolid]]''': similar to a superfluid, a supersolid is able to move without friction but retains a rigid shape.
* '''[[Quantum spin liquid]]''': A disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures, unlike other disordered states.
* '''[[Heavy fermion material]]s''': [[Heavy fermion material]]s or strongly correlated Fermi systems form a new state of matter that defines by [[quantum phase transition]]s, and exhibits a universal [[scale invariance|scaling]] behavior of its [[thermodynamic]], [[Transport phenomena|transport]] and [[relaxation (physics)|relaxation]] properties. [[Quantum spin liquid]], [[quasicrystal]]s, 2D [[Fermi liquid]]s, [[heavy-fermion]] metals and [[heavy-fermion superconductor]]s can belong to the new state of matter.
* '''[[String-net liquid]]''': Atoms in this state have apparently unstable arrangement, like a liquid, but are still consistent in overall pattern, like a solid.
* '''[[Dropleton]]''': An artificial [[quasiparticle]], constituting a collection of electrons and [[electron hole|holes]] inside a semiconductor. The dropleton is the first known quasiparticle that behaves like a liquid.
* '''[[Jahn–Teller effect|Jahn–Teller metal]]''': A solid that exhibits many of the characteristics of an insulator, but acts as a conductor due to a distorted crystalline structure. (The experiment was not reproduced and confirmed by other scientists.)
* '''[[Time crystals]]''': A state of matter where an object can have movement even at their lowest energy state.
* '''[[Rydberg polaron]]''': A state of matter that can only exist at ultra-low temperatures and consists of atoms inside of atoms.

==Very high energy states==
* '''[[Quark–gluon plasma]]''': A phase in which [[quark]]s become free and able to move independently (rather than being perpetually bound into particles, or bound to each other in a quantum lock where exerting force adds energy and eventually solidifies into another quark) in an ocean of [[gluon]]s (subatomic particles that transmit the [[strong interaction|strong force]] that binds quarks together). May be briefly attainable in [[particle accelerator]]s, or possibly inside [[neutron stars]].
** For up to 10<sup>−36</sup> seconds after the [[Big Bang]], the energy density of the universe was so high that the [[fundamental interaction|four forces of nature]] – [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], and [[gravitation]]al – are thought to have been unified into one single force. The state of matter in this time is unknown. As the universe expanded, the temperature and density dropped and the gravitational force separated, which is a process called [[symmetry breaking]].
** For up to 10<sup>−12</sup> seconds after the [[Big Bang]], most scientists think that the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces were unified. The state of matter in this time is unknown.
