'''Electron equivalent''' is a concept commonly used in [[redox chemistry]], reactions involving [[electron transfer]], to define a quantity (e.g. energy or moles) relative to one electron. [[Gibbs free energy|Energies of formation]] are often given as kilojoules per electron equivalent to enable calculation of specific reaction energies on a "per electron" basis.  Reactions containing movement of electrons are often balanced such that reaction quantities are given in relation to the transfer of a single electron, allowing quantification of reactants and products in relation to a single electron transfer.
