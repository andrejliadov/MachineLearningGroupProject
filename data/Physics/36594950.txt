==Nominations and awards money==
{{As of|2018|09}}, anyone can nominate a candidate through the Fundamental Physics Prize website.<ref name=FPP /> {{As of|2018|09}}, each award is worth $3 million. The monetary value exceeds that of the prestigious Nobel Prize, which in 2012 stood at slightly more than $1.2 million.<ref name=nyt /><ref name=autogenerated2 /> 

Physics Frontiers Prize laureates (those on the shortlist for the Fundamental Physics Prize) who do not go on to be awarded the Fundamental Physics Prize each receive (as of 2013) $300,000 and are automatically re-nominated for the Fundamental Physics Prize each year for the next 5 years.<ref name=FPP />

=== Special Breakthrough Prize ===
Unlike the annual Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, the Special Prize is not limited to recent discoveries. As of 2020 the Special Prize, which "can be awarded at any time in recognition of an extraordinary scientific achievement", has been awarded on 5 occasions (twice in 2013, and once in 2016, 2018 and 2019). The monetary value of the award is also $3 million.<ref name="breakthroughprize.org/45">{{Cite web|url=https://breakthroughprize.org/News/45|title=Breakthrough Prize – Special Breakthrough Prize In Fundamental Physics Awarded To Jocelyn Bell Burnell For Discovery Of Pulsars|website=breakthroughprize.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref>

==Ceremony==
The name of the 2013 prize winner was unveiled at the culmination of a ceremony which took place on the evening of March 20, 2013 at the Geneva International Conference Centre.<ref>Press Release http://www.fundamentalphysicsprize.org/news/news4 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424002904/http://www.fundamentalphysicsprize.org/news/news4# |date=2013-04-24 }}</ref> The ceremony was hosted by Hollywood actor and science enthusiast [[Morgan Freeman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52xSOEFTzrM |title=Fundamental Physics Prize Ceremony 2013 - Part 1 |accessdate=April 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727002838/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52xSOEFTzrM |archivedate=July 27, 2013 }}</ref> The evening honored the 2013 laureates − 16 outstanding scientists including [[Stephen Hawking]]<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0QY4cGY0pU|title=YouTube|work=youtube.com}}</ref> and [[CERN]] scientists who led the decades-long effort to discover the Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hQnoZtvsBQ |accessdate=April 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527070105/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hQnoZtvsBQ |title=Fundamental Physics Prize Ceremony 2013 - Part 2 |archivedate=May 27, 2014 }}</ref> [[Sarah Brightman]] and Russian pianist [[Denis Matsuev]] performed for the guests of the ceremony.

==Criticism==
Some have expressed reservations about such new science mega-prizes.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Zeeya Merali|date=12 June 2013|title=Science prizes: The new Nobels|journal=Nature|volume=498|issue=7453|pages=152–154|doi=10.1038/498152a|pmid=23765473|bibcode=2013Natur.498..152M|doi-access=free}}</ref>

{{Quote|What's not to like? Quite a lot, according to a handful of scientists... You cannot buy class, as the old saying goes, and these upstart entrepreneurs cannot buy their prizes the prestige of the Nobels. The new awards are an exercise in self-promotion for those behind them, say scientists. They could distort the meritocracy of peer-review-led research. They could cement the status quo of peer-reviewed research. They do not fund peer-reviewed research. They perpetuate the myth of the lone genius....

As much as some scientists may grumble about the new awards, the financial doping that they bring to research and the wisdom of the goals behind them, two things seem clear. First, most researchers would accept such a prize if they were offered one. Second, it is surely a good thing that the money and attention come to science rather than go elsewhere. It is fair to criticize and question the mechanism—that is the culture of research, after all—but it is the prize-givers' money to do with as they please. It is wise to accept such gifts with gratitude and grace.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Editorial|date=12 June 2013|title=Young upstarts|journal=Nature|volume=498|issue=7453|pages=138|doi=10.1038/498138a|pmid=23776948|doi-access=free}}</ref> }}

==Nominations and awards money==
{{As of|2018|09}}, anyone can nominate a candidate through the Fundamental Physics Prize website.<ref name=FPP /> {{As of|2018|09}}, each award is worth $3 million. The monetary value exceeds that of the prestigious Nobel Prize, which in 2012 stood at slightly more than $1.2 million.<ref name=nyt /><ref name=autogenerated2 /> 

Physics Frontiers Prize laureates (those on the shortlist for the Fundamental Physics Prize) who do not go on to be awarded the Fundamental Physics Prize each receive (as of 2013) $300,000 and are automatically re-nominated for the Fundamental Physics Prize each year for the next 5 years.<ref name=FPP />

=== Special Breakthrough Prize ===
Unlike the annual Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, the Special Prize is not limited to recent discoveries. As of 2020 the Special Prize, which "can be awarded at any time in recognition of an extraordinary scientific achievement", has been awarded on 5 occasions (twice in 2013, and once in 2016, 2018 and 2019). The monetary value of the award is also $3 million.<ref name="breakthroughprize.org/45">{{Cite web|url=https://breakthroughprize.org/News/45|title=Breakthrough Prize – Special Breakthrough Prize In Fundamental Physics Awarded To Jocelyn Bell Burnell For Discovery Of Pulsars|website=breakthroughprize.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Some have expressed reservations about such new science mega-prizes.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Zeeya Merali|date=12 June 2013|title=Science prizes: The new Nobels|journal=Nature|volume=498|issue=7453|pages=152–154|doi=10.1038/498152a|pmid=23765473|bibcode=2013Natur.498..152M|doi-access=free}}</ref>

{{Quote|What's not to like? Quite a lot, according to a handful of scientists... You cannot buy class, as the old saying goes, and these upstart entrepreneurs cannot buy their prizes the prestige of the Nobels. The new awards are an exercise in self-promotion for those behind them, say scientists. They could distort the meritocracy of peer-review-led research. They could cement the status quo of peer-reviewed research. They do not fund peer-reviewed research. They perpetuate the myth of the lone genius....

As much as some scientists may grumble about the new awards, the financial doping that they bring to research and the wisdom of the goals behind them, two things seem clear. First, most researchers would accept such a prize if they were offered one. Second, it is surely a good thing that the money and attention come to science rather than go elsewhere. It is fair to criticize and question the mechanism—that is the culture of research, after all—but it is the prize-givers' money to do with as they please. It is wise to accept such gifts with gratitude and grace.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Editorial|date=12 June 2013|title=Young upstarts|journal=Nature|volume=498|issue=7453|pages=138|doi=10.1038/498138a|pmid=23776948|doi-access=free}}</ref> }}
