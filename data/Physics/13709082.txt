The '''4GLS''' was a proposed 4th Generation Light Source, based at the [[Daresbury Laboratory]] in [[Cheshire]], [[England]],  intended to combine [[energy recovery linac]] (ERL) and [[free electron laser]] technologies to provide synchronised sources of [[synchrotron radiation]] and free electron laser radiation covering the [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] (THz) to [[soft X-ray]] regimes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4gls.ac.uk |title=4GLS, Daresbury - 4th Generation Light Source |accessdate=2007-10-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026121507/http://www.4gls.ac.uk/ |archivedate=26 October 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In early 2008 the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] decided not to proceed with the 4GLS.<ref name=JohnDenham>{{cite web|title=Conversation between Secretary of State for Innovation and Skills and Citizens, 17 March 2008|url=http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/17774|accessdate=2008-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509154407/http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/17774|archive-date=2008-05-09|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>
