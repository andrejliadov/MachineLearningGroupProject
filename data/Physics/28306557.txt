The '''Comstock Prize in Physics''' is awarded by the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] "for recent innovative discovery or investigation in electricity, magnetism, or radiant energy, broadly interpreted." <ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/comstock-prize-in-physics.html|title=Comstock Prize in Physics|publisher= NAS|accessdate= 10 March 2017}} </ref>

Honorees must be residents of North America. Named after [[Cyrus B. Comstock]], it has been awarded about every five years since 1913.
