In [[particle physics]], an '''elementary particle''' or '''fundamental particle''' is a [[<!-- wiktionary:particle| -->subatomic particle]] with no substructure, i.e. it is not composed of other particles.<ref name=PFI/>{{rp|pages=1–3}} Particles currently thought to be elementary include the fundamental [[fermion]]s ([[quark]]s, [[lepton]]s, [[antiquark]]s, and [[antilepton]]s), which generally are "matter particles" and "[[antimatter]] particles", as well as the fundamental [[boson]]s ([[gauge boson]]s and the [[Higgs boson]]), which generally are "force particles" that mediate [[fundamental interaction|interactions]] among fermions.<ref name=PFI/>{{rp|pages=1–3}} A particle containing two or more elementary particles is called a ''[[composite particle]]''.

Ordinary [[matter]] is composed of [[atom]]s, once presumed to be elementary particles—''atom'' meaning "unable to cut" in Greek—although the atom's existence remained controversial until about 1905, as some leading physicists regarded molecules as mathematical illusions, and matter as ultimately composed of [[energy]].<ref name=PFI/>{{rp|pages=1–3}}<ref>{{cite journal

== Cosmic abundance of elementary particles ==
{{main | Cosmic abundance of elements }}

According to the current models of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|big bang nucleosynthesis]], the primordial composition of visible matter of the universe should be about 75% hydrogen and 25% helium-4 (in mass). Neutrons are made up of one up and two down quarks, while protons are made of two up and one down quark. Since the other common elementary particles (such as electrons, neutrinos, or weak bosons) are so light or so rare when compared to atomic nuclei, we can neglect their mass contribution to the observable universe's total mass. Therefore, one can conclude that most of the visible mass of the universe consists of protons and neutrons, which, like all [[baryon]]s, in turn consist of up quarks and down quarks.

Some estimates imply that there are roughly {{10^|80}} baryons (almost entirely protons and neutrons) in the observable universe.<ref name=heile>{{cite news

The number of protons in the observable universe is called the [[Eddington number]].

== Standard Model ==
{{main|Standard Model}}
The Standard Model of particle physics contains 12 flavors of elementary [[fermion]]s, plus their corresponding [[antiparticle]]s, as well as elementary bosons that mediate the forces and the [[Higgs boson]], which was reported on July 4, 2012, as having been likely detected by the two main experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] ([[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]]).<ref name=PFI/>{{rp|pages=1–3}} However, the Standard Model is widely considered to be a provisional theory rather than a truly fundamental one, since it is not known if it is compatible with [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]]. There may be hypothetical elementary particles not described by the Standard Model, such as the [[graviton]], the particle that would carry the [[gravity|gravitational force]], and [[superpartner|sparticle]]s, [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] partners of the ordinary particles.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Holstein |first=Barry R. |date=November 2006 |title=Graviton physics |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=74 |issue=11 |pages=1002–1011 |doi=10.1119/1.2338547 |issn=0002-9505|arxiv=gr-qc/0607045 |bibcode=2006AmJPh..74.1002H |s2cid=15972735 }}</ref>

=== Fundamental fermions ===
{{main|Fermion}}

The 12&nbsp;fundamental fermions are divided into 3&nbsp;[[generation (particle physics)|generations]] of 4&nbsp;particles each. Half of the fermions are [[lepton]]s, three of which have an electric charge of &minus;1, called the electron ({{Subatomic particle|electron-}}), the [[muon]] ({{Subatomic particle|muon-}}), and the [[tau (particle)|tau]] ({{Subatomic particle|tau-}}); the other three leptons are [[neutrino]]s ({{Subatomic particle|electron neutrino}}, {{Subatomic particle|muon neutrino}}, {{Subatomic particle|tau neutrino}}), which are the only elementary fermions with neither electric nor color charge. The remaining six particles are [[quark]]s (discussed below).

The following table lists current measured masses and mass estimates for all the fermions, using the same scale of measure: [[Electronvolt|millions of electron-volts]] relative to square of light speed (MeV/c<sup>2</sup>). For example, the most accurately known quark mass is of the top quark ({{Subatomic particle|top quark}}) at 172.7&nbsp;[[Electronvolt|GeV]]/c<sup>2</sup> or 172&nbsp;700&nbsp;[[Electronvolt|MeV]]/c<sup>2</sup>, estimated using the [[On-shell scheme]].

Estimates of the values of quark masses depend on the version of [[quantum chromodynamics]] used to describe quark interactions. Quarks are always confined in an envelope of [[gluons]] which confer vastly greater mass to the [[mesons]] and [[baryons]] where quarks occur, so values for quark masses cannot be measured directly. Since their masses are so small compared to the effective mass of the surrounding gluons, slight differences in the calculation make large differences in the masses.

==== Antiparticles ====
{{main|Antimatter}}

There are also 12&nbsp;fundamental fermionic antiparticles that correspond to these 12&nbsp;particles.  For example, the [[antielectron]] (positron) ''{{Subatomic particle|antielectron}}'' is the electron's antiparticle and has an electric charge of +1.

==== Quarks ====
{{main|Quark}}
Isolated quarks and antiquarks have never been detected, a fact explained by [[Colour confinement|confinement]]. Every quark carries one of three [[color charge]]s of the [[strong interaction]]; antiquarks similarly carry anticolor. Color-charged particles interact via [[gluon]] exchange in the same way that charged particles interact via [[photon]] exchange. However, gluons are themselves color-charged, resulting in an amplification of the strong force as color-charged particles are separated. Unlike the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]], which diminishes as charged particles separate, color-charged particles feel increasing force.

However, color-charged particles may combine to form color neutral [[composite particle]]s called [[hadron]]s. A quark may pair up with an antiquark: the quark has a color and the antiquark has the corresponding anticolor. The color and anticolor cancel out, forming a color neutral [[meson]]. Alternatively, three quarks can exist together, one quark being "red", another "blue", another "green". These three colored quarks together form a color-neutral [[baryon]]. Symmetrically, three antiquarks with the colors "antired", "antiblue" and "antigreen" can form a color-neutral [[antibaryon]].

Quarks also carry fractional [[electric charge]]s, but, since they are confined within hadrons whose charges are all integral, fractional charges have never been isolated. Note that quarks have electric charges of either +{{2/3}} or −{{1/3}}, whereas antiquarks have corresponding electric charges of either −{{2/3}} or +{{1/3}}.

Evidence for the existence of quarks comes from [[deep inelastic scattering]]: firing [[electron]]s at [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] to determine the distribution of charge within [[nucleon]]s (which are baryons). If the charge is uniform, the [[electric field]] around the proton should be uniform and the electron should scatter elastically. Low-energy electrons do scatter in this way, but, above a particular energy, the protons deflect some electrons through large angles. The recoiling electron has much less energy and a [[jet (particle physics)|jet of particles]] is emitted. This inelastic scattering suggests that the charge in the proton is not uniform but split among smaller charged particles: quarks.

=== Fundamental bosons ===
{{main|Boson}}

In the Standard Model, vector ([[spin (physics)|spin]]-1) bosons ([[gluon]]s, [[photon]]s, and the [[W and Z bosons]]) mediate forces, whereas the [[Higgs boson]] (spin-0) is responsible for the intrinsic [[mass]] of particles. Bosons differ from fermions in the fact that multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state ([[Pauli exclusion principle]]). Also, bosons can be either elementary, like photons, or a combination, like [[meson]]s. The spin of bosons are integers instead of half integers.

==== Gluons ====
{{main|Gluon}}

Gluons mediate the [[strong interaction]], which join quarks and thereby form [[hadron]]s, which are either [[baryon]]s (three quarks) or [[meson]]s (one quark and one antiquark). Protons and neutrons are baryons, joined by gluons to form the [[atomic nucleus]]. Like quarks, gluons exhibit [[color charge|color]] and anticolor – unrelated to the concept of visual color and rather the particles' strong interactions – sometimes in combinations, altogether eight variations of gluons.

==== Electroweak bosons ====
{{main|W and Z bosons|Photon}}

There are three [[weak gauge boson]]s: W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>&minus;</sup>, and Z<sup>0</sup>; these mediate the [[weak interaction]]. The W&nbsp;bosons are known for their mediation in nuclear decay: The W<sup>&minus;</sup> converts a neutron into a proton then decays into an electron and electron-antineutrino pair.
The Z<sup>0</sup> does not convert particle flavor or charges, but rather changes momentum; it is the only mechanism for elastically scattering neutrinos. The weak gauge bosons were discovered due to momentum change in electrons from neutrino-Z exchange. The massless [[photon]] mediates the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic interaction]]. These four gauge bosons form the electroweak interaction among elementary particles.

==== Higgs boson ====
{{main|Higgs boson}}

Although the weak and electromagnetic forces appear quite different to us at everyday energies, the two forces are theorized to unify as a single [[electroweak force]] at high energies. This prediction was clearly confirmed by measurements of cross-sections for high-energy electron-proton scattering at the [[Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage|HERA]] collider at [[DESY]].  The differences at low energies is a consequence of the high masses of the W and Z bosons, which in turn are a consequence of the [[Higgs mechanism]]. Through the process of [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], the Higgs selects a special direction in electroweak space that causes three electroweak particles to become very heavy (the weak bosons) and one to remain with an undefined rest mass as it is always in motion (the photon). On 4 July 2012, after many years of experimentally searching for evidence of its existence, the [[Higgs boson]] was announced to have been observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. [[Peter Higgs]] who first posited the existence of the Higgs boson was present at the announcement.<ref>

In particle physics, this is the level of significance required to officially label experimental observations as a [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]. Research into the properties of the newly discovered particle continues.

==== Graviton ====

{{main|Graviton}}

The [[graviton]] is a hypothetical elementary spin-2 particle proposed to mediate gravitation. While it remains undiscovered due to [[Graviton#Experimental observation|the difficulty inherent in its detection]], it is sometimes included in tables of elementary particles.<ref name=PFI/>{{rp|pages=1–3}} The conventional graviton is massless, although there exist models containing massive [[Kaluza–Klein theory|Kaluza–Klein]] gravitons.<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=0910.1535 |bibcode=2010PhLB..682..446C |title=Massless versus Kaluza-Klein gravitons at the LHC |journal=Physics Letters B |volume=682 |issue=4–5 |pages=446–449 |last1=Calmet |first1=Xavier |last2=de Aquino |first2=Priscila |last3=Rizzo |first3=Thomas G. |year=2010 |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2009.11.045 |hdl=2078/31706|s2cid=16310404 }}</ref>

== Beyond the Standard Model ==
Although experimental evidence overwhelmingly confirms the predictions derived from the [[Standard Model]], some of its parameters were added arbitrarily, not determined by a particular explanation, which remain mysterious, for instance the [[hierarchy problem]]. Theories [[beyond the Standard Model]] attempt to resolve these shortcomings.

=== Grand unification ===
{{main|Grand Unified Theory}}

One extension of the Standard Model attempts to combine the [[electroweak interaction]] with the [[strong interaction]] into a single 'grand unified theory' (GUT). Such a force would be [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] into the three forces by a [[Higgs mechanism|Higgs-like mechanism]]. This breakdown is theorized to occur at high energies, making it difficult to observe unification in a laboratory. The most dramatic prediction of grand unification is the existence of [[X and Y bosons]], which cause [[proton decay]]. However, the non-observation of proton decay at the [[Super-Kamiokande]] neutrino observatory rules out the simplest GUTs, including SU(5) and SO(10).

=== Supersymmetry ===
{{main|Supersymmetry}}

Supersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries to the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. These symmetries exchange [[fermion]]ic particles with [[boson]]ic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of [[supersymmetric particle]]s, abbreviated as ''[[sparticle]]s'', which include the [[slepton]]s, [[squark]]s, [[neutralino]]s, and [[chargino]]s. Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose [[spin (physics)|spin]] differs by {{1/2}} from the ordinary particle. Due to the [[supersymmetry breaking|breaking of supersymmetry]], the sparticles are much heavier than their ordinary counterparts; they are so heavy that existing [[particle collider]]s would not be powerful enough to produce them. However, some physicists believe that sparticles will be detected by the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]].

=== String theory ===
{{main|String theory}}

String theory is a model of physics whereby all "particles" that make up [[matter]] are composed of strings (measuring at the Planck length) that exist in an 11-dimensional (according to [[M-theory]], the leading version) or 12-dimensional (according to [[F-theory]]<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(96)00172-1 |arxiv=hep-th/9602022 |bibcode=1996NuPhB.469..403V |title=Evidence for F-theory |year=1996 |last1=Vafa |first1=Cumrun |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=469 |issue=3 |pages=403–415|s2cid=6511691 }}</ref>) universe. These strings vibrate at different frequencies that determine mass, electric charge, color charge, and spin. A "string" can be open (a line) or closed in a loop (a one-dimensional sphere, like a circle). As a string moves through space it sweeps out something called a ''[[world line#World lines as a tool to describe events|world sheet]]''. String theory predicts 1- to 10-branes (a 1-[[Membrane (M-theory)|brane]] being a string and a 10-brane being a 10-dimensional object) that prevent tears in the "fabric" of space using the [[uncertainty principle]] (e.g., the electron orbiting a hydrogen atom has the probability, albeit small, that it could be anywhere else in the universe at any given moment).

String theory proposes that our universe is merely a 4-brane, inside which exist the 3&nbsp;space dimensions and the 1 time dimension that we observe. The remaining 7&nbsp;theoretical dimensions either are very tiny and curled up (and too small to be macroscopically accessible) or simply do not/cannot exist in our universe (because they exist in a grander scheme called the "[[multiverse]]" outside our known universe).

Some predictions of the string theory include existence of extremely massive counterparts of ordinary particles due to vibrational excitations of the fundamental string and existence of a massless spin-2 particle behaving like the [[graviton]].

=== Technicolor ===
{{main|Technicolor (physics)}}

Technicolor theories try to modify the Standard Model in a minimal way by introducing a new QCD-like interaction. This means one adds a new theory of so-called Techniquarks, interacting via so called Technigluons. The main idea is that the Higgs-Boson is not an elementary particle but a bound state of these objects.

=== Preon theory ===
{{main|Preon}}

According to preon theory there are one or more orders of particles more fundamental than those (or most of those) found in the Standard Model. The most fundamental of these are normally called preons, which is derived from "pre-quarks". In essence, preon theory tries to do for the Standard Model what the Standard Model did for the [[particle zoo]] that came before it. Most models assume that almost everything in the Standard Model can be explained in terms of three to half a dozen more fundamental particles and the rules that govern their interactions. Interest in preons has waned since the simplest models were experimentally ruled out in the 1980s.

=== Acceleron theory ===
[[Acceleron]]s are the hypothetical [[subatomic particle]]s that integrally link the newfound mass of the [[neutrino]] to the [[dark energy]] conjectured to be accelerating the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]].<ref name=acceleron/>

In this theory, neutrinos are influenced by a new force resulting from their interactions with accelerons, leading to dark energy. Dark energy results as the universe tries to pull neutrinos apart.<ref name=acceleron>
