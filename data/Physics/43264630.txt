'''Physics outreach''' encompasses facets of [[science outreach]] and [[physics education]], and a variety of activities by schools, [[research institutes]], [[universities]], clubs and institutions such as [[science museums]] aimed at broadening the audience for and awareness and understanding of physics. While the general public may sometimes be the focus of such activities, physics outreach often centers on developing and providing resources and making presentations to students, educators in other disciplines, and in some cases researchers within different areas of physics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/activity/outreach/|title=Public engagement|website=www.iop.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/programs/outreach/index.cfm|title=Public Engagement|website=www.aps.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quarknet.org/content/about-quarknet|title=About QuarkNet|date=April 19, 2017|website=Quarknet}}</ref>

==History==
Ongoing efforts to expand the understanding of [[physics]] to a wider audience have been undertaken by individuals and institutions since the early 19th century. Historic works, such as the ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', and [[Two New Sciences]] by [[Galileo Galilei]], sought to present revolutionary knowledge in astronomy, frames of reference, and kinematics in a manner that a general audience could understand with great effect.

In the mid 1800s, English physicist and chemist, [[Michael Faraday]]<ref>Lan, Boon Leong, and Jeanette B. S. Lim. "Michael Faraday: Prince Of Lecturers In Victorian England." The Physics Teacher (Stony Brook, N.Y.) 39.1 (2001): 32-36.</ref> gave a series of nineteen lectures aimed towards young adults with the hopes of conveying scientific phenomena. His intentions were to raise awareness, inspire them and generate revenue of the [[Royal Institution]]. This series became known as the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas lectures]], and still continues today. By the early 20th century, the public notoriety of physicists such as [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Marie Curie]], and inventions such as radio led to a growing interest in physics. In 1921, in the United States, the establishment of [[Sigma Pi Sigma]] physics honor society at universities was instrumental in the expanding number of physics presentations, and led to the creation of physics clubs open to all students.<ref>Dixon, P. (1996, October 1). History. Retrieved from http://www.sigmapisigma.org/history.htm</ref>

Museums were an important form of outreach but most early [[science museums]] were generally focused on [[natural history]]. Some specialized museums, such as the Cavendish Museum at [[University of Cambridge]], housed many of the historically important pieces of apparatus that contributed to the major discoveries by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], [[J. J. Thomson|Thomson]], [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]], etc.<ref>Visit the Cavendish Museum. (2008, January 1). Retrieved from http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/cav_museum/.</ref> However, such venues provided little opportunity for [[hands-on learning]] or demonstrations.

In August 1969, [[Frank Oppenheimer]] dedicated his new [[Exploratorium]] in [[San Francisco]] primarily to interactive science exhibits that demonstrated principles in physics. The Exploratorium published the details of their own exhibits in "Cookbooks" that served as an inspiration to many other museums around the world, and since then has diversified into many outreach programs. Oppenheimer had researched European science museums while on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1965. He noted that three museums served as important influences on the Exploratorium: the [[Palais de la Découverte]], which displayed models to teach scientific concepts and employed students as demonstrators, a practice that directly inspired the Exploratorium's much-lauded High School Explainer Program; the [[South Kensington Museum]] of Science and Art, which Oppenheimer and his wife visited frequently; and the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, the world's largest science museum, which had a number of interactive displays that impressed the Oppenheimers.<ref>Dr. Frank Oppenheimer - Biography (long). (2014, January 1) Retrieved from http://www.exploratorium.edu/about/history/frank.</ref>

In the ensuing years, physics outreach, and science outreach more generally, continued to expand and took on new popular forms, including highly successful television shows such as ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', first broadcast in 1980.

As a form of outreach within the physics education community for teachers and students, in 1997 the US [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) and Department of Energy [[USDOE]] established [[QuarkNet]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quarknet.fnal.gov|title=QuarkNet|publisher=}}</ref> a professional teacher development program. In 2012, the [[University of Notre Dame]] received a $6.1M, five-year grant to support a nationwide expansion of the Quarknet program. Also in 1997, the European Particle Physics Outreach Group, led by [[Christopher Llewellyn Smith]], [[Royal Society|FRS]], and Director General of [[CERN]], was formed to create a community of scientists, science educators, and communication specialists in science education and public outreach for particle physics.  This group became the International Particle Physics Outreach Group (IPPOG) in 2011 after the start up of the [[LHC]].<ref>About IPPOG. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://ippog.web.cern.ch/content/2011/about-ippog</ref>

==Innovation==
Many contemporary initiatives in physics outreach have begun to shift focus, transcending traditional field boundaries, seeking to engage students and the public by integrating elements of aesthetic design and popular culture. The goal has been not only to push physics out of a strictly [[science education]] framework but also to draw in professionals and students from other fields to bring their perspectives on physical phenomena. Such work includes artists creating sculptures using [[ferrofluid]]s, and art photography using [[High-speed photography|high speed]] and [[Femto-photography|ultra high speed photography]].

Other efforts, such as [[University of Cambridge]]'s Physics at Work program<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/programme/physicsatwork|title=Overview — Department of Physics|website=outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk}}</ref> have created annual events to demonstrate to secondary students uses of physics in everyday life and a Senior Physics Challenge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-spc.phy.cam.ac.uk/|title=Senior Physics Challenge|website=www-spc.phy.cam.ac.uk}}</ref> Seeing the importance these initiatives, Cambridge has established a full-time physics outreach organization, an Educational Outreach Office,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/|title=Department of Physics|website=outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk}}</ref> and aspirations for a Center of Physics and expanded industrial partnerships that "would include a well equipped core team of outreach officers dedicated to demonstrating the real life applications of physics, showing that physics is an accessible and relevant subject".<ref>The Future of Outreach. Retrieved from http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/outreach/development</ref>

The French research group, La Physique Autrement (Physics Reimagined),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hebergement.u-psud.fr/supraconductivite/?lang=en|title=Physics reimagined|website=hebergement.u-psud.fr}}</ref> of the Laboratoire de Physique des Solides,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lps.u-psud.fr/?lang=en|title=Laboratoire de Physique des Solides - UMR 8502|website=www.lps.u-psud.fr}}</ref> works on research about new ways to present modern [[solid-state physics]] and to engage the general public. In 2013, ''[[Physics Today]]'' covered this group in an article entitled "Quantum Physics For Everyone" which discussed how with the help of designers and unconventional demonstrations, the project sought out and succeeded to engage people who never thought of themselves as interested in science.<ref>"Quantum Physics for Everyone", J. Bobroff, Physics Today p.60, sept 2013. http://hebergement.u-psud.fr/supraconductivite/pdf/physics_today_bobroff.pdf</ref>
