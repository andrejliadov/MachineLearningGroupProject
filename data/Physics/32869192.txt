==Mathematics==
{{main|Duality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''duality''', generally speaking, translates concepts, theorems or mathematical structures into other concepts, theorems or structures, in a one-to-one fashion, often (but not always) by means of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] operation: if the dual of ''A'' is ''B'', then the dual of ''B'' is ''A''.
