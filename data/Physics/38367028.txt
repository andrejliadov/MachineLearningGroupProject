The '''angular momentum problem''' is a problem in astrophysics identified by [[Leon Mestel]] in 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/53/5/5.19/208905/Losing-spin-the-angular-momentum-problem|title=Losing spin: the angular momentum problem|last=Ray|first=Tom|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|access-date=12 February 2017}}</ref>

It was found that the angular momentum of a [[protoplanetary disk]] is misappropriated when compared to models during stellar birth. The [[Sun]] and other stars are predicted by models to be rotating considerably faster than they actually are. The Sun, for example, only accounts for about 0.3 percent of the total angular momentum of the [[Solar System]] while about 60% is attributed to [[Jupiter]].
