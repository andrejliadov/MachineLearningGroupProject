==Overview==
''Beyond Einstein'' tries to explain the basics of superstring theory. Michio Kaku analyzes the history of theoretical physics and the struggle to formulate a [[unified field theory]]. He posits that the [[superstring theory]] might be the only theory that can unite [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]] in one theory.
