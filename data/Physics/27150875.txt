'''ADITYA''' is a medium size [[tokamak]] installed at the [[Institute for Plasma Research]] in [[India]]. 

It has a major radius of 0.75 metres and a minor radius of 0.25 metres. The maximum field strength is 1.2&nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] produced by 20 toroidal field coils spaced symmetrically in the toroidal direction. It is operated by two power supplies, a capacitor bank and the APPS (ADITYA pulse power supply). 

The typical plasma parameters during capacitor bank discharges are: I<sub>p</sub> ~30&nbsp;kA, shot duration ~25&nbsp;ms, central electron temperature ~100&nbsp;eV and core plasma density ~10<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>−3</sup> and the typical parameters of APPS operation is ~100&nbsp;kA plasma current, ~ 100&nbsp;ms duration, central electron temp. ~300&nbsp;eV  and ~3x10<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>−3</sup> core plasma density. 

Various diagnostics used in ADITYA include electric and magnetic probes, microwave [[interferometry]], [[Thomson scattering]] and [[charge exchange]] [[spectroscopy]].
