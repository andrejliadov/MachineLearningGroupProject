'''The 215th meeting of the [[American Astronomical Society]]''' (AAS) took place in [[Washington, D.C.]],  Jan. 3 to Jan. 7, 2010.  It is one of the largest [[astronomy]] meetings ever to take place as 3,500 [[astronomer]]s and [[researcher]]s were expected to attend and give more than 2,200 scientific presentations. The meeting was actually billed as the "largest Astronomy meeting in the universe". An array of discoveries were announced, along with new views of the [[universe]] that we inhabit; such as quiet [[planet]]s like Earth - where life could develop are probably plentiful, even though an abundance of [[cosmos|cosmic]] hurdles exist - such as experienced by our own planet in the past.<ref name=NASA-215-aas/><ref name=Space-dot-com-215th-AAS>

==Infrared scanning the sky==
[[File:Gas giant forms from stellar gas - dust.jpg|thumb|285px|A gas giant forms from instellar gas and dust of a distant proto-star.]]
The [[NASA]] mission of the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] (WISE) is to use infrared light to scan the entire sky for millions of hidden objects, including [[asteroid]]s, failed stars and powerful [[galaxies]] . Launched on December 14, 2009, the data from WISE will serve as a navigation tool for other probes in [[space mission]]s, such as NASA's [[Hubble telescope]] and the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. The first image was presented at the 215th annual AAS meeting. An [[infrared]] snapshot of a region in the constellation [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]], near the Milky Way was taken shortly after the survey [[telescope]] ejected its cover. In a patch of sky three times larger than the moon, the picture shows about 3,000 stars in the Carina constellation.<ref name=NASA-215-aas>

==Planet formation around massive Stars==
The focus for discovering new [[exoplanet]]s has been on sun-like [[star]]s. The catalog of more than 400 exoplanets has proved that these searches are successful, because exoplanets of various sizes have been discovered. However, other star types are also a likely place to discover new exoplanets. New research, announced at the meeting, confirms that planet formation is a natural by-product of star formation. Planet formation occurs even around stars much more massive than the [[Sun]]. However, the life of the stars which the planets orbit are so short that intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]] is not very likely. [[A and B type stars]] were surveyed for the research which involved NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, the Two Micron All-Sky Survey, and astronomers from the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] (CfA) and the [[National Optical Astronomy Observatory]] (NOAO).<ref name=NASA-215-aas/><ref name=Cfa-215-AAS>

==Gravitational wave detection==
[[File:New milisecond radio pulsars.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of seventeen newly discovered millisecond pulsars in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. Milky way is in the background and the pulsars are circled. Credit: NASA/DOE/Fermi LAT Collaboration]]

In a span of three months seventeen pulsars - millisecond pulsars - were discovered in the Milky Way galaxy. Unknown high-energy sources detected by NASA's [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] revealed the existence and location of the pulsars. This is an accelerated pace for discovering such objects, which could be used as a "galactic GPS" to detect gravitational waves passing near Earth. Although the pulsars are relatively old they have not slowed because, these millisecond pulsars have been kept rapidly rotating and renewed with material by accretion of matter from a [[companion star]]. The combined total of 60 known millisecond pulsars creates an all-sky array. Precise monitoring of timing changes, utilizing this array,  may allow the first direct detection of [[gravitational wave]]s.<ref name=NASA-215-aas/>

==Temperature, gravity, and planet migration==
[[Image:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|250px|An artist's impression of protoplanetary disk.]]
According to the  classical model of [[planet migration]], the [[earth]] should have been drawn into the [[sun]] as a [[planetoid]], along with other [[planet]]s. However, a new  theoretical model was presented at the annual meeting. It shows that the assumption a [[proto-planetary disk]] around a star has constant temperature across its whole span is erroneous. Portions of the disk are actually [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] and so cannot cool quickly by radiating heat out to space. This creates temperature differences across the disk, and these differences have not been accounted for before in models that were applied. The differences in temperature counteract the natural [[gravitational pull]] of the sun (or proto-sun), at a crucial time during planet formation.

==Kepler space telescope==
On 4 January 2010, the [[Kepler space telescope]] announced the discovery its first five new [[exoplanet]]s, named [[Kepler-4b]], [[Kepler-5b|5b]], [[Kepler-6b|6b]], [[Kepler-7b|7b]] and [[Kepler-8b|8b]].<ref name=first-five-kepler>

===Overview===
A [[super-Earth]] is an [[extrasolar planet]] with a mass between that of [[Earth]] and the Solar System's [[gas giant]]s. The term ''super-Earth'' refers only to the mass of the planet and does not imply anything about the surface conditions or habitability.<ref name="Valencia">

Andrew Howard of the [[University of California at Berkeley]], announced the planet's discovery at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C.

At the meeting, the details of the findings were first presented by the research group which had used the twin [[Keck Telescope]]s in [[Hawaii]] to detect the exoplanet.  With the twin telescopes functioning as a single observatory, by means of [[interferometry]], it was determined that ''HD156668b'' is only four times larger than the [[Earth]], and the second smallest exoplanet yet found.<ref name=Super-earth-2/>

There are over 400 exoplanets thus far discovered, and only a very small number are categorized as [[Super-earth]] class. Finding such planets as HD156668b, which are closer to earth in size, has become a priority in Astronomy science. For example, the [http://kepler.nasa.gov/ Kepler mission], is part of the intense popular interest surrounding the discovery of hundreds of [[planet]]s orbiting other [[star]]s. Kepler telescope, however has a more specific mission -   to discover hundreds of [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]] planets which are defined as exoplanets that are one half to twice the size of the Earth.<ref name=Super-earth-2/><ref name=Kepler-mission/>

A priority is to find those in the [[habitable zone]] of their stars where liquid water and possibly life might exist. Discoveries such as HD156668b allow astronomers such as the Keck research group to demonstrate they are able to find smaller and smaller planets. Ultimately, results such as those from the Keck group, and the Keppler mission will allow the Solar System to be placed within a continuum of planetary systems in the Galaxy.<ref name=Super-earth-2/><ref name=Kepler-mission/>

HD156668b, is considered to be relatively close at just 80 light-years away. It is in the constellation Hercules. According to early measurements, it appears to be orbiting its parent star about once every four days (approximately). The wobble of the planet's star revealed the existence of HD156668b. The alignment probability is 0.5% for finding a planet in an Earth-like orbit about a solar-like star, compared to the giant planets discovered in four-day orbits, the alignment probability is more like 10%.<ref name=Super-earth-2>

==Black hole update==
Black holes along with new data were a notable topic at the conference.

===Black hole pairs===
Almost every galaxy has  a [[black hole]] with a mass of one million to one billion times that of the [[sun]]. A super-massive black hole, of more than 4 million [[solar mass]]es, is located in the center of our own [[Milky Way galaxy]]. As the universe has evolved, [[galaxies]] often  collide and merge, creating larger galaxies. This has led to the supposition that galaxies in mid-merge should have a two great black holes (a pair) [[orbit]]ing one another. Expectations were, that this should be a common observation, hand in hand with mid merge collisions. However, observation has not validated this supposition;  only a few orbiting pairs had been found. When observation did not match expectation, this posed problems for theories of how galaxies merge and grow.<ref name=Wired-BH-pairs/><ref name=Discover-BH-pairs/>

These [[statistics]] have been recently altered. 33 pair of super-massive orbiting black holes were recently discovered. The first 32 pair by the [[DEEP2 Redshift Survey|DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey]] conducted with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20171103020039/http://www.keckobservatory.org/ Keck II Telescope] on Hawaii’s [[Mauna Kea]]. This survey determined which black hole was moving toward earth at which time. When the black hole moves toward Earth, its light is blue-shifted, meaning it has a shorter [[wavelength]]. Orbiting pairs were identified by looking for instances when one black hole was [[blueshift]]ed and the other [[redshift]]ed. The pairs orbit each other at 200&nbsp;km per second, at several thousand [[light year]]s apart.<ref name=Wired-BH-pairs>

===Intermediate mass black hole===

In a [[globular cluster]]  65 million [[light year]]s from Earth evidence is accumulating that a [[black hole]], one thousand times more massive than the sun,  has caused the destruction of a [[white dwarf]] star. It appears that the white dwarf is heating up as it falls toward the black hole. This event creates an intense stellar [[astrophysical X-ray source]], called an [[ultraluminous X-ray source]]. The indication of this type of strong X-ray source  means that it is more luminous than any known stellar X-ray source, but less luminous than the [[X-ray]]  intensity of [[black hole|supermassive black holes]], which places it in the range of theorized intermediate black holes. Their exact nature of ULXs has remained a mystery, but one suggestion is that some ULXs are black holes with masses between about a hundred and a thousands times that of the Sun.<ref name=Univ-today-black-hole/><ref name=U-of-A-press-release-BH/><ref name=Chandra-NGC-1399/>

A mix of detected [[Abundance of the chemical elements|natural elements]] seems to indicate the actual source of the [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray emissions]] are debris from the white dwarf. If evidence authenticates the observations from NASA's [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and the [[Magellan telescopes]],  it means the first actual observation of an intermediate black hole.   Furthermore, it would be the first confirmed observation of a black hole destroying a star. And it would support theories which state intermediate black holes exist in [[globular cluster]]s.<ref name=Univ-today-black-hole/><ref name=U-of-A-press-release-BH/>

Prior to this it has been argued that  supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies are to be attributed with disruption and destruction of  stars. However, observing such an event in a globular cluster is a first. To date no candidate for an intermediate black hole has been widely accepted.<ref name=Univ-today-black-hole>

====A possible candidate====
Data obtained in [[visible spectrum|optical light]] with the [[Magellan telescopes|Magellan I and II telescopes]] in [[Las Campanas]], Chile, also provides intriguing information about this object, which is found in the [[elliptical galaxy]] NGC 1399 in the [[Fornax Cluster|Fornax galaxy cluster]]. The [[emission spectrum|spectrum]] reveals emission from [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] but no hydrogen, a rare set of signals from within [[globular cluster]]s. The physical conditions deduced from the spectra suggest that the gas is orbiting a black hole of at least 1,000 solar masses.<ref name=Chandra-NGC-1399/>

To explain these observations, researchers suggest that a [[white dwarf]] star strayed too close to an intermediate-mass black hole and was ripped apart by [[black hole|tidal forces]].  The black hole is swallowing material from the white dwarf star, and the material’s velocity implies the size of the black hole. In this scenario the X-ray emission is produced by debris from the disrupted white dwarf star that is heated as it falls towards the black hole and the optical emission comes from debris further out that is illuminated by these X-rays.<ref name=Chandra-NGC-1399/>

Another interesting aspect of this object is that it is found within a globular cluster, a very old, very tight grouping of stars. Astronomers have long suspected globular clusters contained intermediate-mass black holes, but there has been no conclusive evidence of their existence there to date. If confirmed, this finding would represent the first such substantiation.<ref name=Chandra-NGC-1399>

==Galactic Dark Matter Halo==
The Milky Way, and probably most other galaxies too, are surrounded by a [http://news.softpedia.com/news/The-Galactic-Dark-Matter-Halo-Is-Shaped-Like-a-Ball-131354.shtml  halo of dark matter]. The shape of the Milky Way has been determined. The research is the first time scientists have measured the three-dimensional shape of a dark matter halo {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

==Other milestones==
This section will be expanded.

If a massive white dwarf star explodes millions of years from now it could threaten the earth.

The Hubble Space Telescope has taken the deepest look into the universe yet, revealing some of the most distant, earliest galaxies to form after the Big Bang.
