[[File:Launch of IYA 2009, Paris - Grygar, Bell Burnell cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]], the first female president of the IOP, donated £2.3 million to the IOP to establish the Bell Burnell Graduate Scholarship Fund]]

The Institute of Physics was formed in 1960 from the merger of the [[Physical Society of London|Physical Society]], founded as the Physical Society of London in 1874, and the Institute of Physics, founded in 1918.<ref name=PhysicalSociety1874-2002/><ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/0031-9112/25/1/011|title = Message from the President: Past, present and future|journal = Physics Bulletin|volume = 25|pages = 8|year = 1974|last1 = Flowers|first1 = Brian}}</ref>

The Physical Society of London had been officially formed on 14 February 1874 by [[Frederick Guthrie]], following the canvassing of opinion of Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] by the physicist and parapsychologist Sir [[William F. Barrett|William Barrett]] at the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] meeting in Bradford in 1873, with [[John Hall Gladstone]] as its first president.<ref name=PhysicalSociety1874-2002/> From its beginning, the society held open meetings and demonstrations and published ''[[Proceedings of the Physical Society]]''.<ref name=PhysicalSociety1874-2002/> Meetings were held every two weeks, mainly at [[Imperial College London]]. The first [[Guthrie lecture]], now known as the Faraday Medal and Prize, was delivered in 1914.

In the early part of the 20th century, the profession of "[[physicist]]" emerged, partly as a result of the increased demand for scientists during the [[First world war|First World War]]. In 1917, following discussions between [[William Eccles]] and [[William Duddell]], the Council of the Physical Society, along with the [[Faraday Society]], the [[Optical Society, London|Optical Society]], and the [[Roentgen Society]], started to explore ways of improving the professional status of physicists,<ref name=iophistory/> and in 1918, the Institute of Physics was created at a meeting of the four societies held at [[King's College London]].<ref name=PhysicalSociety1874-2002/> In 1919, Sir [[Richard Glazebrook]] was elected first president of the institute,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/educate-explore/history-of-npl/npl-directors/sir-richard-tetley-glazebrook|title=Sir Richard Tetley Glazebrook|publisher=National Physical Laboratory|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330162927/http://www.npl.co.uk/educate-explore/history-of-npl/npl-directors/sir-richard-tetley-glazebrook|archive-date=30 March 2012|access-date=12 January 2019}}</ref> and the inaugural meeting of the Institute took place in 1921.<ref name=PhysicalSociety1874-2002/> As with the Physical Society, dissemination of knowledge was fundamental to the institute, which began publication of the ''[[Journal of Scientific Instruments]]'' in 1922.<ref name=iophistory/> The annual ''[[Reports on Progress in Physics]]'' began in 1934<ref name=PhysicalSociety1874-2002/> and is still published today. In 1952, the institute began the "Graduateship" course and examination, which ran until 1984 when the expansion of access to universities removed demand.<ref name=iophistory/>

In 1932, the Physical Society of London merged with the Optical Society to create the Physical Society. In 1960, the Physical Society and the Institute of Physics merged, creating a single organization with the name ''The Institute of Physics and the Physical Society'', with John Cockcroft elected at its first president. The new society combined the [[learned society]] tradition of the Physical Society with the professional body tradition of the Institute of Physics.<ref name="iophistory"/> Under the leadership of [[Thomas E. Nevin]], an Irish branch of the Institute of Physics was formed in 1964.<ref name=40th_anniversary>[http://www.iopireland.org/about/history/index.html About Us: Early History of IOP in Ireland] Foundation of the Irish branch</ref> Upon being granted a [[royal charter]] in 1970, the organization was renamed as the Institute of Physics.<ref name="IOP Royal Charter">{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/about/royal_charter/file_38390.pdf |title=Institute of Physics Charter and Bylaws |access-date=29 December 2019}}</ref>

==Membership==
The IOP has 23,000 members<ref>{{cite web|url=https://d25f0oghafsja7.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/2019-12/letter-to-the-prime-minister-13-december-2019.pdf |title=Letter to the Prime Minister |publisher=Institute of Physics|access-date=27 December 2019}}</ref> split across four grades of membership: Associate Member (AMInstP), Member (entitled to use the [[postnominals]] MInstP), [[Fellow of the Institute of Physics|Fellow]] (entitled to use the postnominals FInstP) and Honorary Fellow (entitled to use the postnominals Hon.FInstP). Undergraduates, apprentices and trainees can become Associate Members, and qualification for MInstP is normally by completion of an undergraduate degree that is "recognised" by the institute &ndash; this covers almost all UK physics degrees.<ref name="Recognised Degree Courses">{{cite web |url=http://www.iop.org/education/higher_education/accred-and-recog/file_73758.pdf |title=Register of Accredited Courses |publisher=IOP |access-date=29 December 2019}}</ref> An MInstP can become an FInstP by making "an outstanding contribution to the profession."

These four grades of membership replaced the previous seven grades in January 2018; these changes introduced removed affiliate memberships for undergraduates (they are now Associate Members), removed the post-nominal letters AMInstP, and made Associate Members voting members.<ref name="Changes to membership structure">{{cite web|url=https://www.iop.org/about/governance/agm2017/summary-of-changes/page_69500.html|title=Summary of changes to the membership structure|publisher=Institute of Physics|access-date=12 January 2018}}</ref>  In 2015, the membership of the Institute of Physics was 86% male at MInstP and 91% male at FInstP. 85% of Honorary Fellows were male.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iop.org/publications/iop/2016/file_67244.pdf |title=What does a physicist look like? |publisher=IOP |access-date=29 December 2019}}</ref>

Fellows wear a [[Tudor bonnet|doctor's bonnet]] in black velvet with red tassels, other grades wear a standard black [[mortarboard]] with black tassels.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VafIBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA203|page=203|title=Shaw's Academical Dress of Great Britain and Ireland - Volume II: Non-degree-awarding Bodies|author=Nicholas Groves|publisher=[[Burgon Society]]|date=2014|isbn=978-099287400-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.iop.org/AcademicDress.asp?rel=6c8695fe94736a02bbd2e3623c1d9a7d|title=Academic Dress|publisher=Institute of Physics|access-date=20 October 2016}}</ref>

==Professional qualifications==
{{see also|Chartered Physicist|Chartered Engineer|Registered Scientist|Registered Science Technician}}

The institute grants the [[British professional qualifications|professional title]] of [[Chartered Physicist]] (CPhys) under its own charter, [[Chartered Engineer]] (CEng), [[Engineering Technician]] (EngTech), and [[Incorporated Engineer]] (IEng) as a nominated body of the [[Engineering Council UK|Engineering Council]], and [[Registered Scientist]] (RSci) and [[Registered Science Technician]] (RSciTech) as a licensed body of the [[Science Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/news/16/may/page_67394.html| title=IOP licensed to award professional registrations| date=20 May 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics|access-date=20 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://membership.iop.org/professional-registration| title=Professional registration| publisher=Institute of Physics|access-date=29 December 2019}}</ref> Until 2001,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iop.org/about/royal_charter/file_38390.pdf| title=Charter and Bylaws|work=Institute of Physics |at= Bylaw 7|access-date=26 December 2019}}</ref> CPhys was granted automatically with MInstP, however since then it has become a separate qualification that is equal in stature to [[Chartered Engineer]]. People awarded CPhys  since 2012 require re-validation every three years to retain the qualification. In order to gain the CPhys qualification, a physicist must be appropriately qualified (an accredited MSci or [[MPhys]] integrated [[master's degree]] is standard, although experience leading to an equivalent level can be counted), have had a minimum of two years of structured training and a minimum of two years responsible work experience, have demonstrated a commitment to continuing professional development, and have gained a number of competencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/about/royal_charter/file_38390.pdf| title=Charter and Bylaws|access-date=12 December 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://membership.iop.org/chartered-physicist-cphys |title=Chartered Physicist (CPhys)|access-date=29 December 2019|publisher=Institute of Physics}}</ref> From 2020, all CPhys holders are required to be professionally active and to submit an annual continuing professional development record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://membership.iop.org/guidance-maintaining-your-cphys|title=Guidance on maintaining your CPhys|work=Institute of Physics |access-date=26 December 2019}}</ref>

==Education==
The IOP accredits undergraduate degrees (BSc/BA and MSci/MPhys) in physics in British and Irish universities.<ref name="IoP Accredited Degree Courses">{{cite web| url=http://www.iop.org/education/higher_education/accreditation/file_63783.pdf| title=Register of Accredited Courses| date=January 2016| access-date=24 August 2018}}</ref> At post-16 level, the IOP developed the '[[Advancing Physics]]' [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] course, in conjunction with the OCR examining board, which is accredited by the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority]]. Advancing Physics was sold to [[Oxford University Press]] in January 2011.<ref name="letter to Advancing Physics users">[http://advancingphysics.org/events_and_news/dear_advancing_physics_teacher.html Letter to Advancing Physics users]</ref> The IOP also developed the Integrated Sciences degree, which is run at four universities in England.<ref name="Integrated Sciences">[http://www.integratedsciences.org.uk/ Integrated Sciences]</ref> The IOP provides an important educational service for secondary schools in the UK. This is the [[Lab in a Lorry]], a [[mobile laboratory]] in a large articulated truck. This has three small laboratories where schoolchildren can try out various hands-on experiments, using physics equipment not usually available in the average school laboratory. Sponsorship is provided by [[EDF Energy]] and support from the [[British Science Association]]. IOP runs the Stimulating Physics Network, aimed at increasing the uptake of physics at A-level, and administers teacher-training scholarships funded by the [[Department for Education]].<ref name="SPN">[http://www.stimulatingphysics.org/index.htm Stimulating Physics Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216004556/http://www.stimulatingphysics.org/index.htm |date=2015-02-16 }}</ref><ref name="Teacher Training Scholarships">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iop.org/education/teach/itts/page_52632.html|title=IOP Teacher Training Scholarships|publisher=Institute of Physics}}</ref>

In March 2019, the Institute of Physics launched the Bell Burnell Graduate Scholarship Fund with the goal of helping female and black students to become physics researchers. The program is funded by [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]] and provides aid to low-income students as well as those who qualify for refugee status. Bell won the [[Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics]] in 2018 and donated the entire £2.3 million prize money to launch the fund.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47612806|title=Fund to boost female and black physicist numbers|last=Ghosh|first=Pallab|date=19 March 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321044000/https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47612806|archive-date=21 March 2019|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>

The institute is also interested in the ethical impact of physics, as is witnessed though the Physics and Ethics Education Project.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.peep.ac.uk/content/index.php | title=PEEP Physics Ethics Education Project: Teaching controversial and social issues in science / Physics}}</ref>

==Headquarters==

[[File:Uk institute of physics building.jpg|thumb|The Institute of Physics building in [[Islington]], London]]

Since its formation, the institute has had its headquarters in London. The early meetings of the Physical Society of London were hosted in [[South Kensington]], until a permanent base was found in [[Burlington House]] in 1894. In 1927, the Institute of Physics acquired, rent-free, 1 Lowther Gardens; it was joined there by the Physical Society in 1939. During the [[Second world war|Second World War]], the institute moved temporarily to the [[University of Reading]]. After the war, the institute returned to London, first to 19 [[Albemarle Street]], where it stayed for little over a year, before moving to 47 [[Belgrave Square]] in December 1946.<ref name="iophistory"/> The Physical Society continued to be based in Lowther Gardens until 1960. The institute moved to 76 [[Portland Place]] in 1996.<ref name="iophistory">{{Cite web
