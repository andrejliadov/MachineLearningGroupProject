== Gameplay ==
''Blackhole'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] puzzle-platformer. The player's task is to collect "selfburns." At least one must be collected in each level to move on. If all selfburns are collected in the level, the time is saved. The player can also try to get a better time once he collects all of them. To finish the game, the player needs to collect a certain number of selfburns.

The game contains six acts, including Cave, Jungle, and Desert. Every act is set in a different environment and includes different puzzles or objects. For example, the jungle includes trampolines and the desert includes pushable crates. Each act includes a special platform that changes gravity.

== Plot ==
The game is set in 2121. Earth is threatened by [[black hole]]s. A group of astronauts are sent on a mission to neutralize them. Their effort is successful until their spaceship called Endera is sucked into one of the massive black holes and crashes on Entity; a mysterious object resembling a planet. The first person to wake up, and who the player takes control of, is the crew's coffee-maker assistant, a.k.a. Coffee Guy;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.play-asia.com/blog/2018/01/31/in-the-depths-of-the-black-hole-the-coffee-guys-adventure-complete-edition/ | title=The Coffee Guy’s Adventure In The Depths Of The Blackhole: Complete Edition | first=Patricia | last=Jaucian | publisher=[[Play Asia]] | date=2018-01-31|accessdate=2018-09-04}}</ref> accompanied by the ship's [[Artificial intelligence in video games|artificial intelligence]] Auriel loaded into his [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]].

== Development ==
The developers originally intended to remake ''PacIn: Revenge of Nermessis'', FiolaSoft Studio's previous title. Unlike the original game, the remake was intended to be released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and in English. Due to technical problems, the game was cancelled and FiolaSoft started to work on a new project. Vojta Stránský, a member of the FiolaSoft team, began production of a prototype. The prototype interested other members of FiolaSoft and they began to work on it, naming it ''Blackhole.'' Blackhole was announced in March 2014 at Game Expo 2014 in Bratislava. Developers also started a [[Steam (software)#Steam Greenlight|Steam Greenlight]] campaign, and in May 2014 the game was greenlit.<ref name="An"/><ref name=ZR>{{cite web|last=Cvrček|first=Martin|title=Rozhovor s Filipem Kraucherem nejen o Blackhole|url=http://www.zing.cz/special/1132/rozhovor-s-filipem-kraucherem-nejen-o-blackhole|work=Zing.cz|accessdate=17 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kraucher|first=Filip|title=Blackhole is coming on STEAM!|url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/updates/243803573/1400146027|work=Steam|accessdate=17 May 2014}}</ref>

The game was originally scheduled to be released in September 2014, but was delayed several times before being finally released on February 27, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Burian|first1=Michal|title=Blackhole opět odloženo, ale jen o sedm dní|url=http://www.zing.cz/novinky/25677/blackhole-opet-odlozeno-ale-jen-o-sedm-dni|website=Zing.cz|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>

Developers started to work on a DLC after the release of the original game. The first DLC, titled ''Testing Laboratory,'' was released on May 19, 2015. It serves as a prequel to the original game and tells the story about how the Coffee Guy gained his position in the Endera mission.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Konfršt|first1=Jan|title=DLC Testovací laboratoř pro českou plošinovku Blackhole zve na procházku po Zemi|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/datum-vydani/dlc-testovaci-laborator-pro-ceskou-plosinovku-blackhole-zve-na-prochazku-po-zemi-251266|website=Games.cz|accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref> Developers released a free expansion, ''The Secret of the Entity'', on July 13, 2015.
