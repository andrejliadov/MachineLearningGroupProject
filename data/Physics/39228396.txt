The [[equivalence principle]] is one of the corner-stones of [[gravitation|gravitation theory]].  Different formulations of the '''equivalence principle''' are labeled ''weakest'', ''weak'', ''middle-strong'' and ''strong.''  All of these formulations are based on the empirical equality of inertial mass, gravitational active and passive charges.

The ''weakest'' equivalence principle is restricted to the motion law of a probe point mass in a uniform [[gravitational field]]. Its localization is the ''weak'' equivalence principle that states the existence of a desired local inertial frame at a given world point. This is the case of equations depending on a gravitational field and its first order derivatives, e. g., the equations of mechanics of probe point masses, and the equations of electromagnetic and Dirac fermion fields. The ''middle-strong'' equivalence principle is concerned with any matter, except a gravitational field, while the ''strong'' one is applied to all physical laws.

The above-mentioned variants of the equivalence principle aim to guarantee the transition of [[General Relativity]] to [[Special Relativity]] in a certain [[frame of reference|reference frame]]. However, only the particular ''weakest'' and ''weak'' equivalence principles are true. 
To overcome this difficulty, the equivalence principle can be formulated in geometric terms as follows.

In the spirit of [[Felix Klein|Felix Klein's]] [[Erlanger program]], Special Relativity can be characterized as the [[Klein geometry]] of [[Lorentz group]] invariants. Then the '''geometric equivalence principle''' is formulated to require the existence of Lorentz invariants on a [[world manifold]] <math>\scriptstyle{X}\,</math>. This requirement holds if the [[tangent bundle]] <math>\scriptstyle{TX}\,</math> of <math>\scriptstyle{X}\,</math> admits an atlas with Lorentz transition functions, i.e., a structure group of the associated [[frame bundle]] <math>\scriptstyle{FX}\,</math> of linear tangent frames in <math>\scriptstyle{TX}\,</math> is reduced to the Lorentz group <math>\scriptstyle{\mathrm{SO}(1,3)}\,</math>. By virtue of the well known theorem on [[reduction of the structure group|structure group reduction]], this reduction takes place if and only if the quotient bundle <math>\scriptstyle{FX/\mathrm{SO}(1,3)}\to \scriptstyle{X}\,</math> possesses a global section, which is a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian metric]] on <math>\scriptstyle{X}\,</math>.

Thus the geometric equivalence principle provides the necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of a pseudo-Riemannian metric, i.e., a [[gravitational field]] on a world manifold.

Based on the geometric equivalence principle, gravitation theory is formulated as [[gauge gravitation theory|gauge theory]] where a gravitational field is described as a [[Higgs field (classical)|classical Higgs field]] responsible for spontaneous breakdown of space-time symmetries.
