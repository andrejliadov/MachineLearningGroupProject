In his will, Albert Einstein left the Hebrew University his personal papers and the copyright to them. The Albert Einstein Archives contain some 55,000 items.<ref name=Einstein>{{cite news |last=Sela |first=Shimrit |url=http://news.haaretz.co.il/hasen/pages/ShArtStEngPE.jhtml?itemNo=1011875&contrassID=2&subContrassID=2&title='Phone%20company's%20'Einstein'%20ads%20shelved%20due%20to%20Hebrew%20U.%20copyright%20row'&dyn_server=172.20.5.5 |title=Albert Einstein's bequest to the Hebrew University |work=[[Haaretz]] |location=Israel |date=March 15, 2011 |accessdate=September 6, 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In March 2012, the University announced that it had digitized the archive and was planning to make it more accessible online.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rabinovitch |first=Ari |publisher=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/20/us-einstein-archive-idUSBRE82I0WD20120320 |date=March 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2012 |title=Einstein the scientist, dreamer, lover: online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Einstein papers to go digital on the Web |work=Space Daily |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Einstein_papers_to_go_digital_on_the_Web_999.html |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=University digitises Einstein archives via new website |work=Silicon Republic |last=Doyle |first=Carmel |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/item/26304-university-digitises-albert/ |date=March 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref> The archive initially released 2,000 documents.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/19/albert-einstein-archives-theory-of-relativity |title=Albert Einstein's complete archives to be posted online |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=UK |date=19 March 2012 |accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref> Within the collection are his personal notes, love letters to various women, including the woman who would become his second wife, [[Elsa Einstein|Elsa]].

==History==

Albert Einstein visited [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1923 for 12 days, giving the first lecture at the [[Mount Scopus]] campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem—two years before the University opened in 1925.<ref name="robinson15">{{cite book| title=Einstein: A Hundred Years of Relativity | first=Andrew |last=Robinson | author-link=W. Andrew Robinson | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | edition=revised | date=2015 | isbn=978-0-691-16989-7 | page=189 }}</ref> [[Menachem Ussishkin]], the president of the [[Zionist]] Executive, invited Einstein to settle in Jerusalem, but this was the only visit that Einstein actually made to Jerusalem. However, Einstein was a member of the university's first board of governors. In 1925, the original 46-page manuscript of the [[general theory of relativity]] ended up at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.albert-einstein.org/article_manuscript1916.html | title=Relativity – The paper that challenged our notion of time and space | publisher=Albert Einstein Archives | first=Barbara | last=Wolff | accessdate=4 January 2016 }}</ref>

Einstein did not save all of his written material, but from 1919, as his fame increased, he employed his stepdaughter [[Einstein family|Ilse]] as a secretarial assistant.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.albert-einstein.org/archives2.html | title=The History of the Albert Einstein Archives | publisher=The Albert Einstein Archives at The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] | accessdate=2 January 2016 }}</ref> [[Helen Dukas]] (1896–1982) began working for Einstein with increased systematization from April 1928, although not all outgoing correspondence was saved. After the [[Nazi]]s' rise to power in 1933, Einstein's son-in-law [[Einstein family|Rudolf Kayser]], aided by the French Embassy, rescued Einstein's papers in [[Berlin]]. Some of the material at Einstein's summer house in [[Caputh, Brandenburg]] was destroyed to avoid seizure, although most of his works between 1930 and 1932 were saved. That material was transported via Haberlandstrasse where Einstein lived in Berlin, then to [[Paris]], and ended up stored in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], United States until after Einstein's death.

Einstein's 1950 will appointed Helen Dukas and [[Otto Nathan]] as trustees of the estate and stated, "[A]ll literary rights and assets shall be vested in the Hebrew University."<ref name="einstein-website">{{cite web| url=http://www.einstein-website.de/z_information/einsteinarchives.html | title=Albert Einstein Archives in Jerusalem | website=Einstein-website.de | location=Germany | accessdate=2 January 2016 }}</ref> After Einstein's death in 1955, the trustees spent many years organizing Einstein's papers. In the 1960s, Helen Dukas and the physicist  [[Gerald Holton]] of [[Harvard University]] in the USA reorganized the archive, with the aim of publishing the material, in a joint project between the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and [[Princeton University Press]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/ | title=The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | accessdate=3 January 2016 }}</ref> The material increased from  14,000 documents at the time of Einstein's death in 1955 to around 42,000 documents in 1982.<ref name="einstein-website" /> To aid in this work, Einstein's papers were transferred from his Princeton home to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Princeton University]].

In 1982, the Einstein Estate transferred Einstein's personal papers to the [[Jewish National & University Library]] in Jerusalem. President [[Avraham Harman]] of The Hebrew University and [[Milton Handler]] of the [[American Friends of The Hebrew University]] worked on the transfer of the material to Jerusalem. In subsequent years, additional material was sent from Einstein's Princeton home. The [[Bern Dibner]] Curatorship, which manages the Albert Einstein Archives, was established in 1988 by the [[Dibner Fund]] of [[Connecticut]], USA.

The first curator of the Einstein Archives was Ze'ev Rosenkranz whose term extended from 1989 to 2003. The catalogue was made available online in 2003. Since 2004,  Roni Grosz has been the head of the Archives. The Einstein Archives became part of the Hebrew University's Library Authority in January 2008. In July of that year, the Archives moved to the Levy Building on the Givat Ram campus. Since March 19, 2012, the Archives have digitized and made available increasingly more of Einstein's works online.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/database.html | title=Archival Database | publisher=Albert Einstein Archives | accessdate=3 January 2016 }}</ref> [[Princeton University Press]] has also been active in this effort.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://press.princeton.edu/einstein/digital/ | title=The Digital Einstein Papers Website – an Overview | publisher=Princeton University Press | accessdate=3 January 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.openculture.com/2014/12/the-digital-einstein-papers.html | title=New Archive Puts 1000s of Einstein’s Papers Online, Including This Great Letter to Marie Curie | work=Archives, Physics | publisher=[[Open Culture]] | date=8 December 2014 | accessdate=4 January 2016 }}</ref>
