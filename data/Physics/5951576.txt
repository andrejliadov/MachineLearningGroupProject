The '''history of electromagnetic theory''' begins with ancient measures to understand [[atmospheric electricity]], in particular [[lightning]].<ref>Bruno Kolbe, Francis ed Legge, Joseph Skellon, tr., "''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0o90G64Z2FDIyKUsLs9&id=150IAAAAIAAJ An Introduction to Electricity]''".

In the 19th century it had become clear that  [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]  were related, and their theories were unified: wherever charges are in motion electric current results, and magnetism is due to electric current.<ref name="LyonsTA">Lyons, T.

==Ancient and classical history==
The knowledge of [[static electricity]] dates back to the earliest civilizations, but for millennia it remained merely an interesting and mystifying phenomenon, without a theory to explain its behavior and often confused with magnetism. The ancients were acquainted with rather curious properties possessed by two minerals, [[amber]] ({{lang-grc-gre|ἤλεκτρον}}, {{transl|grc|ēlektron}}) and magnetic iron ore ({{lang|grc|μαγνῆτις λίθος}} {{transl|grc|magnētis lithos}},<ref>[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_BkS2KW7u76MC ''Platonis Opera''], Meyer and Zeller, 1839, p. 989.</ref> "the Magnesian stone,<ref>The location of Magnesia is debated; it could be [[Magnesia (regional unit)|the region in mainland Greece]] or [[Magnesia ad Sipylum]].

Based on his find of an [[Olmec]] [[hematite]] artifact in [[Central America]], the American astronomer John Carlson has suggested that "the Olmec may have discovered and used the geomagnetic [[lodestone]] compass earlier than 1000&nbsp;BC".

Long before any knowledge of [[electromagnetism]] existed, people were aware of the effects of [[electricity]]. Lightning and other manifestations of electricity such as [[St. Elmo's fire]] were known in ancient times, but it was not understood that these phenomena had a common origin.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana">Maver, William, Jr.: "Electricity, its History and Progress", [https://archive.org/stream/encyclopediaame21unkngoog#page/n210/mode/1up The Encyclopedia Americana; a library of universal knowledge, vol. X, pp.&nbsp;172ff]. (1918).

J. Murray, 1881. Page 422. (cf. [... the symbol of a]'' 'serpent' is rather a fish, which still serves, in the Coptic language, to designate the electric fish'' [...])</ref> The shocks from animals were apparent to observers since pre-history by a variety of peoples that came into contact with them. Texts from 2750&nbsp;BC by the ancient [[Egyptians]] referred to these fish as "thunderer of the [[Nile]]" and saw them as the "protectors" of all the other fish.<ref name="WhittakerET" /> Another possible approach to the discovery of the identity of lightning and electricity from any other source, is to be attributed to the Arabs, who before the 15th century used the same Arabic word for lightning ({{transl|ar|barq}}) and the [[electric ray]].<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

[[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], writing at around 600&nbsp;BC, noted that rubbing fur on various substances such as [[amber]] would cause them to attract specks of dust and other light objects. Thales wrote on the effect now known as [[Electrostatics|static electricity]]. The Greeks noted that if they rubbed the amber for long enough they could even get an [[electric spark]] to jump.<ref name=Baigrie>{{Citation

Magnetic attraction was once accounted for by [[Aristotle]] and [[Thales]] as the working of a soul in the stone.<ref>A history of electricity. By Park Benjamin. [https://archive.org/details/ahistoryelectri00benjgoog/page/n49 Pg 33]</ref>

In the 11th century, the [[China|Chinese]] scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) was the first person to write of the magnetic needle [[compass]] and that it improved the accuracy of navigation by employing the [[astronomy|astronomical]] concept of [[true north]] (''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', 1088), and by the 12th century the Chinese were known to use the lodestone [[compass]] for navigation. In 1187, [[Alexander Neckam]] was the first in Europe to describe the compass and its use for navigation.

In the thirteenth century [[Pierre de Maricourt|Peter Peregrinus]], a native of [[Maricourt, Somme|Maricourt]] in [[Picardy]], made a discovery of fundamental importance.<ref>His [[Epistola]] was written in 1269.</ref> The French 13th century scholar conducted experiments on magnetism and wrote the first extant treatise describing the properties of magnets and pivoting compass needles.<ref name="WhittakerET" /> The [[dry compass]] was invented around 1300 by Italian inventor [[Flavio Gioja]].<ref>Lane, Frederic C. (1963) "The Economic Meaning of the Invention of the Compass", The American Historical Review, 68 (3: April), p. 605–617</ref>

Archbishop [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], Greek scholar and writer of the 12th century, records that ''Woliver'', [[king of the Goths]], was able to draw sparks from his body. The same writer states that a certain philosopher was able while dressing to draw sparks from his clothes, a result seemingly akin to that obtained by [[Robert Symmer]] in his silk stocking experiments, a careful account of which may be found in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'', 1759.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

Italian physician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] wrote about electricity in ''De Subtilitate'' (1550) distinguishing, perhaps for the first time, between electrical and magnetic forces.

==17th Century==
Toward the late 16th century, a physician of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth's time]], Dr. [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]], in ''De Magnete'', expanded on Cardano's work and invented the [[New Latin]] word {{lang|la|electrica}} from {{lang|grc|ἤλεκτρον}} ({{transl|grc|ēlektron}}), the Greek word for "amber".<ref name=Benjamin>{{Citation

}}</ref> Gilbert, a native of Colchester, Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, and sometime President of the College of Physicians, was one of the earliest and most distinguished English men of science — a man whose work Galileo thought enviably great. He was appointed Court physician, and granted a pension to set him free to continue his research in physics and chemistry.<ref name="Dampier, W. C. D." />

Gilbert undertook a number of careful electrical experiments, in the course of which he discovered that many substances other than amber, such as sulphur, wax, glass, etc.,<ref>consult ' Priestley's 'History of Electricity,' London 1757</ref> were capable of manifesting electrical properties. Gilbert also discovered that a heated body lost its electricity and that moisture prevented the [[electrification]] of all bodies, due to the now well-known fact that moisture impaired the insulation of such bodies.  He also noticed that electrified substances attracted all other substances indiscriminately, whereas a magnet only attracted iron. The many discoveries of this nature earned for Gilbert the title of ''founder of the electrical science''.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" /> By investigating the forces on a light metallic needle, balanced on a point, he extended the list of electric bodies, and found also that many substances, including metals and natural magnets, showed no attractive forces when rubbed. He noticed that dry weather with north or east wind was the most favourable atmospheric condition for exhibiting electric phenomena—an observation liable to misconception until the difference between conductor and insulator was understood.<ref name="Dampier, W.

[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Boyle]].]]
Gilbert's work was followed up by [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691), the famous natural philosopher who was once described as "father of Chemistry, and uncle of the Earl of Cork." Boyle was one of the founders of the Royal Society when it met privately in Oxford, and became a member of the Council after the Society was incorporated by Charles II. in 1663. He worked frequently at the new science of electricity, and added several substances to Gilbert's list of electrics. He left a detailed account of his researches under the title of ''[[Experiments on the Origin of Electricity]]''.<ref name="Dampier, W. C. D." /> Boyle, in 1675, stated that electric attraction and repulsion can act across a vacuum.{{cn|date=March 2019|reason=the concept of electrical repulsion was not established. This point may refer to his experiments with magnetism in a vacuum}} One of his important discoveries was that electrified bodies in a vacuum would attract light substances, thus indicating that the electrical effect did not depend upon the air as a medium.

The first usage of the word ''electricity'' is ascribed to [[Thomas Browne|Sir Thomas Browne]] in his 1646 work, ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]''.

The first appearance of the term ''electromagnetism'' on the other hand comes from an earlier date: 1641.
''[[Magnes sive de Arte Magnetica|Magnes]]'',<ref name="Magnes">''The Magnet, or Concerning Magnetic Science'' (Magnes sive de arte magnetica)</ref>  by the Jesuit luminary [[Athanasius Kircher]], carries on page 640 the provocative chapter-heading: "''Elektro-magnetismos'' i.e. On the Magnetism of amber, or electrical attractions and their causes" ({{lang|grc|ηλεκτρο-μαγνητισμος}} ''id est sive De Magnetismo electri, seu electricis attractionibus earumque causis'').

==18th century==

===Improving the electric machine===
{{Main|electrostatic machine}}
[[File:Hauksbee Generator.JPG|thumb|upright|Generator built by [[Francis Hauksbee]].<ref>From ''Physico-Mechanical Experiments'', 2nd Ed., London 1719</ref>]]
The electric machine was subsequently improved by [[Francis Hauksbee (scientist)|Francis Hauksbee]], his student Litzendorf, and by Prof. [[Georg Matthias Bose]], about 1750. Litzendorf, researching for [[Christian August Hausen]], substituted a glass ball for the sulphur ball of [[Otto von Guericke|Guericke]]. Bose was the first to employ the "prime conductor" in such machines, this consisting of an iron rod held in the hand of a person whose body was insulated by standing on a block of resin. [[Jan Ingenhousz|Ingenhousz]], during 1746, invented electric machines made of plate glass.<ref>Consult Dr. [[Joseph Constantine Carpue|Carpue]]'s [https://archive.org/details/b22042684 'Introduction to Electricity and Galvanism'], London 1803.</ref> Experiments with the electric machine were largely aided by the discovery that a glass plate, coated on both sides with tinfoil, would accumulate [[electric charge]] when connected with a source of [[electromotive force]]. The electric machine was soon further improved by [[Andrew Gordon (Benedictine)|Andrew Gordon]], a Scotsman, Professor at Erfurt, who substituted a glass cylinder in place of a glass globe; and by Giessing of Leipzig who added a "rubber" consisting of a cushion of woollen material. The collector, consisting of a series of metal points, was added to the machine by [[Benjamin Wilson (painter)|Benjamin Wilson]] about 1746, and in 1762, [[John Canton]] of England (also the inventor of the first pith-ball electroscope in 1754<ref>{{cite book  | last = Derry

===Electrics and non-electrics===
In 1729, [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]] conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated the difference between conductors and non-conductors (insulators), showing amongst other things that a metal wire and even [[wikt:packthread|packthread]] conducted electricity, whereas silk did not. In one of his experiments he sent an [[electric current]] through 800 feet of hempen thread which was suspended at intervals by loops of silk thread. When he tried to conduct the same experiment substituting the silk for finely spun brass wire, he found that the electric current was no longer carried throughout the hemp cord, but instead seemed to vanish into the brass wire. From this experiment he classified substances into two categories: "electrics" like glass, resin and silk and "non-electrics" like metal and water. "Non-electrics" conducted charges while "electrics" held the charge.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" /><ref>{{Citation | title = Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the 18th Century | author = Krebs, Robert E. | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | year = 2003 | page = 82 | isbn = 0-313-32015-2}}</ref>

===Vitreous and resinous===
Intrigued by Gray's results, in 1732, [[Charles François de Cisternay du Fay|C. F. du Fay]] began to conduct several experiments. In his first experiment, Du Fay concluded that all objects except metals, animals, and liquids could be electrified by rubbing and that metals, animals and liquids could be electrified by means of an electric machine, thus discrediting Gray's "electrics" and "non-electrics" classification of substances.

In 1733 Du Fay discovered what he believed to be two kinds of frictional electricity; one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin.<ref name="guarnieri 7-1">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2014|title=Electricity in the age of Enlightenment|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=8|issue=3|pages=60–63|doi=10.1109/MIE.2014.2335431|s2cid=34246664}}</ref> From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, "vitreous" and "resinous", that are separated by friction and that neutralize each other when combined.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Story of Electrical and Magnetic Measurements: From 500 B.C. to the 1940s | author = Keithley, Joseph F. | publisher = Wiley | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-7803-1193-0}}</ref> This picture of electricity was also supported by [[Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein]] in his theoretical and experimental works. The two-fluid theory would later give rise to the concept of ''positive'' and ''negative'' electrical charges devised by Benjamin Franklin.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

===Leyden jar===
[[File:Pieter van Musschenbroek.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Pieter van Musschenbroek]].]]
The [[Leyden jar]], a type of [[capacitor]] for electrical energy in large quantities, was invented independently by [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] on 11 October 1744 and by [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] in 1745–1746 at [[Leiden University]] (the latter location giving the device its name).<ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/><ref>Biography, [http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/musschenbroek.htm Pieter (Petrus) van Musschenbroek]</ref> [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], when experimenting with the Leyden jar, discovered in 1747 that a discharge of static electricity was equivalent to an [[electric current]]. [[Capacitance]] was first observed by [[Ewald Georg von Kleist|Von Kleist]] of Leyden in 1754.<ref>According to Priestley ('History of Electricity,' 3d ed., Vol. I, p. 102)</ref> Von Kleist happened to hold, near his electric machine, a small bottle, in the neck of which there was an iron nail. Touching the iron nail accidentally with his other hand he received a severe electric shock. In much the same way Musschenbroeck assisted by Cunaens received a more severe shock from a somewhat similar glass bottle. Sir William Watson of England greatly improved this device, by covering the bottle, or jar, outside and in with tinfoil. This piece of electrical apparatus will be easily recognized as the well-known Leyden jar, so called by the [[Jean-Antoine Nollet|Abbot Nollet]] of Paris, after the place of its discovery.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

In 1741, [[John Ellicott (clockmaker)|John Ellicott]] "proposed to measure the strength of electrification by its power to raise a weight in one scale of a balance while the other was held over the electrified body and pulled to it by its attractive power". 
As early as 1746, Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700–1770) had performed experiments on the propagation speed of electricity. By involving 200 monks connected from hand to hand by a 7-m iron wire so as to form a circle of about 1.6&nbsp;km, he was able to prove that this speed is finite, even though very high.<ref name="guarnieri 8">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2016|title=The Rise of Light – Discovering Its Secrets|journal=Proc. IEEE |volume=104|issue=2|pages=467–473|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2015.2513118|s2cid=207023221|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1066184}}</ref> In 1749, Sir William Watson conducted numerous experiments to ascertain the velocity of electricity in a wire. These experiments, although perhaps not so intended, also demonstrated the possibility of transmitting signals to a distance by electricity. In these experiments, the signal appeared to travel the 12,276-foot length of the insulated wire instantaneously. [[Louis Guillaume Le Monnier|Le Monnier]] in France had previously made somewhat similar experiments, sending shocks through an iron wire 1,319 feet long.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

About 1750, first experiments in [[electrotherapy]] were made. Various experimenters made tests to ascertain the physiological and therapeutical effects of electricity. Typical for this effort was [[Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein|Kratzenstein]] in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] who in 1744 wrote a treatise on the subject. [[Stephen Demainbray|Demainbray]] in Edinburgh examined the effects of electricity upon plants and concluded that the growth of two myrtle trees was quickened by electrification. These myrtles were electrified "during the whole month of October, 1746, and they put forth branches and blossoms sooner than other shrubs of the same kind not electrified."<ref>Priestley's 'History of Electricity,' p. 138</ref> [[Abbé Ménon]] in France tried the effects of a continued application of electricity upon men and birds and found that the subjects experimented on lost weight, thus apparently showing that electricity quickened the excretions.<ref>Catholic churchmen in science.

===Late 18th century===

[[Benjamin Franklin]] promoted his investigations of electricity and theories through the famous, though extremely dangerous, experiment of having his son fly a [[kite]] through a storm-threatened sky. A key attached to the kite string sparked and charged a Leyden jar, thus establishing the link between lightning and electricity.<ref>[http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Kite_Experiment Kite Experiment] (2011). [[IEEE]] Global History Network.</ref> Following these experiments, he invented a [[lightning rod]]. It is either Franklin (more frequently) or [[Ebenezer Kinnersley]] of [[Philadelphia]] (less frequently) who is considered to have established the convention of positive and negative electricity.

Theories regarding the nature of electricity were quite vague at this period, and those prevalent were more or less conflicting. Franklin considered that electricity was an [[imponderable fluid]] pervading everything, and which, in its normal condition, was [[homogeneous|uniformly]] distributed in all substances. He assumed that the electrical manifestations obtained by rubbing glass were due to the production of an excess of the electric fluid in that substance and that the manifestations produced by rubbing wax were due to a deficit of the fluid. This explanation was opposed by supporters of the [[Fluid theory of electricity|"two-fluid" theory]] like [[Robert Symmer]] in 1759. In this theory, the vitreous and resinous electricities were regarded as imponderable fluids, each fluid being composed of mutually repellent particles while the particles of the opposite electricities are mutually attractive. When the two fluids unite as a result of their attraction for one another, their effect upon external objects is neutralized. The act of rubbing a body decomposes the fluids, one of which remains in excess on the body and manifests itself as [[Glass|vitreous]] or resinous electricity.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

Up to the time of Franklin's historic kite experiment,<ref>see [[atmospheric electricity]]</ref> the identity of the electricity developed by rubbing and by [[electrostatic machine]]s ([[Electrostatics|frictional electricity]]) with lightning had not been generally established. Dr. Wall,<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1708.0011 | volume=26 | title=Experiments of the Luminous Qualities of Amber, Diamonds, and Gum Lac, by Dr. Wall, in a Letter to Dr. Sloane, R. S.

It was doubtless Franklin, however, who first proposed tests to determine the sameness of the phenomena. In a letter to Peter Comlinson of London, on 19 October 1752, Franklin, referring to his kite experiment, wrote,
{{quote|"At this key the phial (Leyden jar) may be charged; and from the electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled, and all the other electric experiments be formed which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube, and thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning be completely demonstrated."<ref>Franklin, '[[Experiments and Observations on Electricity]]'</ref>}}
On 10 May 1742 [[Thomas-François Dalibard]], at Marley (near Paris), using a vertical iron rod 40 feet long, obtained results corresponding to those recorded by Franklin and somewhat prior to the date of Franklin's experiment. Franklin's important demonstration of the sameness of frictional electricity and lightning doubtless added zest to the efforts of the many experimenters in this field in the last half of the 18th century, to advance the [[history of science|progress of the science]].<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

Franklin's observations aided later scientists {{citation needed|date=January 2015}} such as [[Michael Faraday]], [[Luigi Galvani]], [[Alessandro Volta]], [[André-Marie Ampère]] and [[Georg Ohm|Georg Simon Ohm]], whose collective work provided the basis for modern electrical technology and for whom fundamental units of electrical measurement are named. Others who would advance the field of knowledge included [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], [[Georg Matthias Bose]], Smeaton, [[Louis-Guillaume Le Monnier]], [[Jacques de Romas]], Jean Jallabert, [[Giovanni Battista Beccaria]], [[Tiberius Cavallo]], [[John Canton]], [[Robert Symmer]], [[Jean-Antoine Nollet|Abbot Nollet]], John Henry Winkler, [[Benjamin Wilson (painter)|Benjamin Wilson]], [[Ebenezer Kinnersley]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Franz Aepinus]], Edward Hussey Délavai, [[Henry Cavendish]], and [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]]. Descriptions of many of the experiments and discoveries of these early electrical scientists may be found in the scientific publications of the time, notably the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'', ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', ''[[Cambridge Mathematical Journal]]'', ''Young's Natural Philosophy'', Priestley's ''History of Electricity'', Franklin's ''Experiments and Observations on Electricity'', Cavalli's ''Treatise on Electricity'' and De la Rive's ''Treatise on Electricity''.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

Henry Elles was one of the first people to suggest links between electricity and magnetism. In 1757 he claimed that he had written to the Royal Society in 1755 about the links between electricity and magnetism, asserting that "there are some things in the power of magnetism very similar to those of electricity" but he did "not by any means think them the same". In 1760 he similarly claimed that in 1750 he had been the first "to think how the electric fire may be the cause of thunder".<ref>Royal Society Papers, vol. IX (BL. Add MS 4440): Henry Elles, from Lismore, Ireland, to the Royal Society, London, 9 August 1757, f.12b; 9 August 1757, f.166.</ref> Among the more important of the electrical research and experiments during this period were those of [[Franz Aepinus]], a noted German scholar (1724–1802) and [[Henry Cavendish]] of London, England.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

[[Franz Aepinus]] is credited as the first to conceive of the view of the reciprocal relationship of electricity and magnetism. In his work ''Tentamen Theoria Electricitatis et Magnetism'',<ref>''Tr''., Test Theory of Electricity and Magnetism</ref> published in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1759, he gives the following amplification of Franklin's theory, which in some of its features is measurably in accord with present-day views: "The particles of the electric fluid repel each other, attract and are attracted by the particles of all bodies with a force that decreases in proportion as the distance increases; the electric fluid exists in the pores of bodies; it moves unobstructedly through non-electric (conductors), but moves with difficulty in insulators; the manifestations of electricity are due to the unequal distribution of the fluid in a body, or to the approach of bodies unequally charged with the fluid." Aepinus formulated a corresponding theory of magnetism excepting that, in the case of magnetic phenomena, the fluids only acted on the particles of iron. He also made numerous electrical experiments apparently showing that, in order to manifest electrical effects, tourmaline must be heated to between 37.5°С and 100&nbsp;°C. In fact, tourmaline remains unelectrified when its temperature is uniform, but manifests electrical properties when its temperature is rising or falling. Crystals that manifest electrical properties in this way are termed [[Pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]]; along with tourmaline, these include sulphate of quinine and quartz.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

[[Henry Cavendish]] independently conceived a theory of electricity nearly akin to that of Aepinus.<ref>Philosophical Transactions 1771</ref> In 1784, he was perhaps the first to utilize an electric spark to produce an explosion of hydrogen and oxygen in the proper proportions that would create pure water. Cavendish also discovered the inductive capacity of [[dielectric]]s (insulators), and, as early as 1778, measured the specific inductive capacity for beeswax and other substances by comparison with an air condenser.

[[File:Bcoulomb.png|thumb|upright|Drawing of Coulomb's torsion balance. From Plate 13 of his 1785 memoir.]] 
Around 1784 [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|C. A. Coulomb]] devised the [[torsion balance]], discovering what is now known as [[Coulomb's law]]:  the force exerted between two small electrified bodies varies inversely as the square of the distance, not as Aepinus in his theory of electricity had assumed, merely inversely as the distance. According to the theory advanced by Cavendish, "the particles attract and are attracted inversely as some less power of the distance than the cube."''<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" /> A large part of the domain of electricity became virtually annexed by Coulomb's discovery of the law of inverse squares.

Through the experiments of [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] and others proving that electricity could be transmitted to a distance, the idea of making practical use of this phenomenon began, around 1753, to engross the minds of inquisitive people. To this end, suggestions as to the employment of electricity in the transmission of intelligence were made. The first of the methods devised for this purpose was probably that of [[Georges-Louis Le Sage|Georges Lesage]] in 1774.<ref>Electric Telegraph, apparatus by wh. signals may be transmitted to a distance by voltaic currents propagated on metallic wires; fnded. on experimts. of Gray 1729, Nollet, Watson 1745, Lesage 1774, Lamond 1787, Reusserl794, Cavallo 1795, Betancourt 1795, Soemmering 1811, Gauss & Weber 1834, &c.

Page 288.</ref> This method consisted of 24 wires, insulated from one another and each having had a pith ball connected to its distant end. Each wire represented a letter of the alphabet. To send a message, a desired wire was charged momentarily with electricity from an electric machine, whereupon the pith ball connected to that wire would fly out. Other methods of telegraphing in which frictional electricity was employed were also tried, some of which are described in the [[Electrical telegraph|history on the telegraph]].<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

The era of [[galvanic electricity|galvanic]] or [[voltaic electricity]] represented a revolutionary break from the historical focus on frictional electricity. [[Alessandro Volta]] discovered that [[chemical reaction]]s could be used to create positively charged [[anode]]s and negatively charged [[cathode]]s. When a conductor was attached between these, the [[voltage|difference in the electrical potential]] (also known as voltage) drove a [[Electric current|current]] between them through the conductor. The [[potential difference]] between two points is measured in units of [[volt]]s in recognition of Volta's work.<ref name="guarnieri 7-2">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2014|title=The Big Jump from the Legs of a Frog|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=8|issue=4|pages=59–61+69|doi=10.1109/MIE.2014.2361237|s2cid=39105914}}</ref><ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

The first mention of voltaic electricity, although not recognized as such at the time, was probably made by [[Johann Georg Sulzer]] in 1767, who, upon placing a small disc of zinc under his tongue and a small disc of copper over it, observed a peculiar taste when the respective metals touched at their edges. Sulzer assumed that when the metals came together they were set into vibration, acting upon the nerves of the tongue to produce the effects noticed. In 1790, Prof. [[Luigi Galvani|Luigi Alyisio Galvani]] of Bologna, while conducting experiments on "[[animal electricity]]", noticed the twitching of a frog's legs in the presence of an electric machine. He observed that a frog's muscle, suspended on an iron balustrade by a copper hook passing through its dorsal column, underwent lively convulsions without any extraneous cause, the electric machine being at this time absent.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

To account for this phenomenon, Galvani assumed that electricity of opposite kinds existed in the nerves and muscles of the frog, the muscles and nerves constituting the charged coatings of a Leyden jar. Galvani published the results of his discoveries, together with his hypothesis, which engrossed the attention of the physicists of that time.<ref name="guarnieri 7-2"/> The most prominent of these was Volta, professor of physics at [[Pavia]], who contended that the results observed by Galvani were the result of the two metals, copper and iron, acting as [[electromotor]]s, and that the muscles of the frog played the part of a conductor, completing the circuit. This precipitated a long discussion between the adherents of the conflicting views. One group agreed with Volta that the electric current was the result of an [[electromotive force]] of contact at the two metals; the other adopted a modification of Galvani's view and asserted that the current was the result of a [[chemical affinity]] between the metals and the acids in the pile. Michael Faraday wrote in the preface to his ''Experimental Researches'', relative to the question of whether metallic contact is productive of a part of the electricity of the voltaic pile: "I see no reason as yet to alter the opinion I have given; ... but the point itself is of such great importance that I intend at the first opportunity renewing the inquiry, and, if I can, rendering the proofs either on the one side or the other, undeniable to all."<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

Even Faraday himself, however, did not settle the controversy, and while the views of the advocates on both sides of the question have undergone modifications, as subsequent investigations and discoveries demanded, up to 1918 diversity of opinion on these points continued to crop out. Volta made numerous experiments in support of his theory and ultimately developed the pile or battery,<ref>See [[Voltaic pile]]</ref> which was the precursor of all subsequent chemical batteries, and possessed the distinguishing merit of being the first means by which a prolonged continuous current of electricity was obtainable. Volta communicated a description of his pile to the [[Royal Society of London]] and shortly thereafter Nicholson and Cavendish (1780) produced the decomposition of water by means of the electric current, using Volta's pile as the source of electromotive force.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

==19th century==

===Early 19th century===
[[File:Volta A.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alessandro Volta]].]]
In 1800 [[Alessandro Volta]] constructed the first device to produce a large electric current, later known as the [[electric battery]]. [[Napoleon]], informed of his works, summoned him in 1801 for a command performance of his experiments. He received many medals and decorations, including the [[Légion d'honneur]].

[[Humphry Davy|Davy]] in 1806, employing a voltaic pile of approximately 250 cells, or couples, decomposed potash and soda, showing that these substances were respectively the oxides of potassium and sodium, metals which previously had been unknown. These experiments were the beginning of [[electrochemistry]], the investigation of which Faraday took up, and concerning which in 1833 he announced his important law of electrochemical equivalents, viz.: "''The same quantity of electricity — that is, the same electric current — decomposes chemically equivalent quantities of all the bodies which it traverses; hence the weights of elements separated in these electrolytes are to each other as their chemical equivalents''." Employing a battery of 2,000 elements of a voltaic pile Humphry Davy in 1809 gave the first public demonstration of the electric [[arc lamp|arc light]], using for the purpose charcoal enclosed in a vacuum.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

Somewhat important to note, it was not until many years after the discovery of the voltaic pile that the sameness of animal and frictional electricity with voltaic electricity was clearly recognized and demonstrated. Thus as late as January 1833 we find Faraday writing<ref>'Philosophical Transactions,' 1833</ref> in a paper on the electricity of the [[electric ray]]. "''After an examination of the experiments of Walsh,<ref>Of Torpedos Found on the Coast of England. In a Letter from [[John Walsh, Esq]]; F. R. S. to Thomas Pennant, Esq; F. R. S. John Walsh Philosophical Transactions Vol. 64, (1774), pp. 464-473</ref><ref>The works of Benjamin Franklin: containing several political and historical tracts not included in any former ed., and many letters official and private, not hitherto published; with notes and a life of the author, Volume 6 [https://books.google.com/books?id=dvQ_AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA348 Page 348].</ref> [[Jan Ingenhousz|Ingenhousz]], [[Henry Cavendish]], Sir [[Humphry Davy|H. Davy]], and Dr. Davy, no doubt remains on my mind as to the identity of the electricity of the [[electric ray|torpedo]] with common ''(frictional)'' and voltaic electricity; and I presume that so little will remain on the mind of others as to justify my refraining from entering at length into the philosophical proof of that identity. The doubts raised by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] have been removed by his brother, Dr. Davy; the results of the latter being the reverse of those of the former. ... The general conclusion which must, I think, be drawn from this collection of facts ''(a table showing the similarity, of properties of the diversely named electricities)'' is, that electricity, whatever may be its source, is identical in its nature''."<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

It is proper to state, however, that prior to Faraday's time the similarity of electricity derived from different sources was more than suspected. Thus, [[William Hyde Wollaston]],<ref>another noted and careful experimenter in electricity and the discoverer of palladium and rhodium</ref> wrote in 1801:<ref>Philosophical Magazine, Vol. Ill, p. 211</ref> "''This similarity in the means by which both electricity and galvanism (voltaic electricity) appear to be excited in addition to the resemblance that has been traced between their effects shows that they are both essentially the same and confirm an opinion that has already been advanced by others, that all the differences discoverable in the effects of the latter may be owing to its being less intense, but produced in much larger quantity''." In the same paper Wollaston describes certain experiments in which he uses very fine wire in a solution of sulphate of copper through which he passed electric currents from an electric machine. This is interesting in connection with the later day use of almost similarly arranged fine wires in electrolytic receivers in wireless, or radio-telegraphy.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

[[File:Ørsted.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hans Christian Ørsted]].]]
In the first half of the 19th century many very important additions were made to the world's knowledge concerning electricity and magnetism. For example, in 1819 [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] of Copenhagen discovered the deflecting effect of an electric current traversing a wire upon- a suspended magnetic needle.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

This discovery gave a clue to the subsequently proved intimate relationship between electricity and magnetism which was promptly followed up by [[Ampè, André-Marie|Ampère]] who shortly thereafter (1821) announced his celebrated theory of electrodynamics, relating to the force that one current exerts upon another, by its electro-magnetic effects, namely<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />
# Two parallel portions of a circuit attract one another if the currents in them are flowing in the same direction, and repel one another if the currents flow in the opposite direction.
# Two portions of circuits crossing one another obliquely attract one another if both the currents flow either towards or from the point of crossing, and repel one another if one flows to and the other from that point.
# When an element of a circuit exerts a force on another element of a circuit, that force always tends to urge the second one in a direction at right angles to its own direction.
Ampere brought a multitude of phenomena into theory by his investigations of the mechanical forces between conductors supporting currents and magnets.

The German physicist [[Thomas Johann Seebeck|Seebeck]] discovered in 1821 that when heat is applied to the junction of two metals that had been soldered together an electric current is set up. This is termed [[thermoelectric effect|thermoelectricity]]. Seebeck's device consists of a strip of copper bent at each end and soldered to a plate of bismuth. A magnetic needle is placed parallel with the copper strip. When the heat of a lamp is applied to the junction of the copper and bismuth an electric current is set up which deflects the needle.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

Around this time, [[Siméon Denis Poisson]] attacked the difficult problem of induced magnetization, and his results, though differently expressed, are still the theory, as a most important first approximation. It was in the application of mathematics to physics that his services to science were performed. Perhaps the most original, and certainly the most permanent in their influence, were his memoirs on the theory of electricity and magnetism, which virtually created a new branch of [[mathematical physics]].

[[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]] wrote ''[[An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in 1828. The essay introduced several important concepts, among them a theorem similar to the modern Green's theorem, the idea of potential functions as currently used in physics, and the concept of what are now called [[Green's function]]s. George Green was the first person to create a [[mathematical theory]] of electricity and magnetism and his theory formed the foundation for the work of other scientists such as James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson, and others.

[[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier|Peltier]] in 1834 discovered an effect opposite to thermoelectricity, namely, that when a current is passed through a couple of dissimilar metals the temperature is lowered or raised at the junction of the metals, depending on the direction of the current. This is termed the [[Peltier effect]]. The variations of temperature are found to be proportional to the strength of the current and not to the square of the strength of the current as in the case of heat due to the ordinary resistance of a conductor. This second law is the [[Joule heating|I<sup>2</sup>R law]], discovered experimentally in 1841 by the English physicist [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]]. In other words, this important law is that the heat generated in any part of an electric circuit is directly proportional to the product of the resistance R of this part of the circuit and to the square of the strength of current I flowing in the circuit.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

In 1822 [[Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger|Johann Schweigger]] devised the first [[galvanometer]]. This instrument was subsequently much improved by [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] (1833). In 1825 [[William Sturgeon]] of Woolwich, England, invented the horseshoe and straight bar electromagnet, receiving therefor the silver medal of the Society of Arts.<ref>'Trans. Society of Arts,1 1825</ref> In 1837 [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and Weber (both noted workers of this period) jointly invented a reflecting galvanometer for telegraph purposes. This was the forerunner of the Thomson reflecting and other exceedingly sensitive galvanometers once used in [[Submarine signals|submarine signaling]] and still widely employed in electrical measurements. [[François Arago|Arago]] in 1824 made the important discovery that when a copper disc is rotated in its own plane, and if a magnetic needle be freely suspended on a pivot over the disc, the needle will rotate with the disc. If on the other hand the needle is fixed it will tend to retard the motion of the disc. This effect was termed [[Arago's rotations]].<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" /><ref>Meteorological essays By [[François Arago]], Sir [[Edward Sabine]]. Page 290.

''Proces verbal'', Academy of Sciences, 22 November 1824."</ref><ref>For more, see [[Rotating magnetic field]].</ref>

[[File:Ohm3.gif|thumb|upright|[[Georg Simon Ohm]].]]
Futile attempts were made by [[Charles Babbage]], [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]], [[John Herschel]] and others to explain this phenomenon. The true explanation was reserved for Faraday, namely, that electric currents are induced in the copper disc by the cutting of the magnetic lines of force of the needle, which currents in turn react on the needle. [[Georg Simon Ohm]] did his work on resistance in the years 1825 and 1826, and published his results in 1827 as the book ''[[Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet]]''.<ref>Tr., "[[The galvanic Circuit investigated mathematically]]".</ref><ref>{{cite book

He drew considerable inspiration from [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]]'s work on heat conduction in the theoretical explanation of his work.  For experiments, he initially used [[voltaic pile]]s, but later used a [[thermocouple]] as this provided a more stable voltage source in terms of internal resistance and constant potential difference.  He used a galvanometer to measure current, and knew that the voltage between the thermocouple terminals was proportional to the junction temperature.  He then added test wires of varying length, diameter, and material to complete the circuit.  He found that his data could be modeled through a simple equation with variable composed of the reading from a galvanometer, the length of the test conductor, thermocouple junction temperature, and a constant of the entire setup. From this, Ohm determined his law of proportionality and published his results. In 1827, he announced the now [[Ohm's law|famous law that bears his name]], that is:
<center>[[Electromotive force]] = [[electrical current|Current]] &times; [[electrical resistance|Resistance]]<ref>The Encyclopedia Americana: a library of universal knowledge, 1918.</ref></center>
Ohm brought into order a host of puzzling facts connecting electromotive force and electric current in conductors, which all previous electricians had only succeeded in loosely binding together qualitatively under some rather vague statements. Ohm found that the results could be summed up in such a simple law and by Ohm's discovery a large part of the domain of electricity became annexed to theory.

===Faraday and Henry===
[[File:Joseph Henry (1879).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joseph Henry]].]]
The discovery of [[electromagnetic induction]] was made almost simultaneously, although independently, by [[Michael Faraday]], who was first to make the discovery in 1831, and [[Joseph Henry]] in 1832.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Electromagnetism|url=http://web.hep.uiuc.edu/home/serrede/P435/Lecture_Notes/A_Brief_History_of_Electromagnetism.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Smithsonian Institution Archives|title=Electromagnetism|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/henry/electromagnetism}}</ref> Henry's discovery of self-induction and his work on spiral conductors using a copper coil were made public in 1835, just before those of Faraday.<ref>Tsverava, G.

In 1831 began the epoch-making researches of [[Michael Faraday]], the famous pupil and successor of [[Humphry Davy]] at the head of the Royal Institution, London, relating to electric and electromagnetic induction. The remarkable researches of Faraday, the ''prince of experimentalists'', on electrostatics and electrodynamics and the induction of currents. These were rather long in being brought from the crude experimental state to a compact system, expressing the real essence. Faraday was not a competent mathematician,<ref>According to [[Oliver Heaviside]]</ref><ref>Oliver Heaviside, Electromagnetic theory: Complete and unabridged ed. of v.1, no.2, and: Volume 3. 1950.</ref><ref>Oliver Heaviside, Electromagnetic theory, v.1. "The Electrician" printing and publishing company, limited, 1893.</ref> but had he been one, he would have been greatly assisted in his researches, have saved himself much useless speculation, and would have anticipated much later work. He would, for instance, knowing Ampere's theory, by his own results have readily been led to Neumann's theory, and the connected work of Helmholtz and Thomson. Faraday's studies and researches extended from 1831 to 1855 and a detailed description of his experiments, deductions and speculations are to be found in his compiled papers, entitled Experimental Researches in Electricity.' Faraday was by profession a chemist. He was not in the remotest degree a mathematician in the ordinary sense — indeed it is a question if in all his writings there is a single mathematical formula.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />
[[File:Faraday-Millikan-Gale-1913.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Michael Faraday]].]]
The experiment which led Faraday to the discovery of electromagnetic induction was made as follows: He constructed what is now and was then termed an [[induction coil]], the primary and secondary wires of which were wound on a wooden bobbin, side by side, and insulated from one another. In the circuit of the primary wire he placed a battery of approximately 100 cells. In the secondary wire he inserted a galvanometer. On making his first test he observed no results, the galvanometer remaining quiescent, but on increasing the length of the wires he noticed a deflection of the galvanometer in the secondary wire when the circuit of the primary wire was made and broken. This was the first observed instance of the development of [[electromotive force]] by electromagnetic induction.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

He also discovered that induced currents are established in a second closed circuit when the current strength is varied in the first wire, and that the direction of the current in the secondary circuit is opposite to that in the first circuit. Also that a current is induced in a secondary circuit when another circuit carrying a current is moved to and from the first circuit, and that the approach or withdrawal of a magnet to or from a closed circuit induces momentary currents in the latter. In short, within the space of a few months Faraday discovered by experiment virtually all the laws and facts now known concerning electro-magnetic induction and magneto-electric induction. Upon these discoveries, with scarcely an exception, depends the operation of the telephone, the [[dynamo]] machine, and incidental to the dynamo electric machine practically all the gigantic electrical industries of the world, including [[electric lighting]], electric traction, the operation of electric motors for power purposes, and [[electro-plating]], [[electrotyping]], etc.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

In his investigations of the peculiar manner in which iron filings arrange themselves on a cardboard or glass in proximity to the poles of a magnet, Faraday conceived the idea of [[magnetic]] "[[lines of force]]" extending from pole to pole of the magnet and along which the filings tend to place themselves. On the discovery being made that magnetic effects accompany the passage of an electric current in a wire, it was also assumed that similar magnetic lines of force whirled around the wire. For convenience and to account for induced electricity it was then assumed that when these lines of force are "''cut''" by a wire in passing across them or when the lines of force in rising and falling cut the wire, a current of electricity is developed, or to be more exact, an electromotive force is developed in the wire that sets up a current in a closed circuit. Faraday advanced what has been termed the ''molecular theory of electricity''<ref>A treatise on electricity, in theory and practice, Volume 1 By Auguste de La Rive. [https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonelec00rivegoog/page/n165 Page 139].</ref> which assumes that electricity is the manifestation of a peculiar condition of the molecule of the body rubbed or the ether surrounding the body. Faraday also, by experiment, discovered [[paramagnetism]] and [[diamagnetism]], namely, that all solids and liquids are either attracted or repelled by a magnet. For example, iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, chromium, etc., are paramagnetic (attracted by magnetism), whilst other substances, such as bismuth, phosphorus, antimony, zinc, etc., are repelled by magnetism or are [[diamagnetic]].<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" /><ref>'Phil.

The 25 years immediately following Faraday's discoveries of [[electromagnetic induction]] were fruitful in the promulgation of laws and facts relating to induced currents and to magnetism. In 1834 [[Heinrich Lenz]] and [[Moritz von Jacobi]] independently demonstrated the now familiar fact that the currents induced in a coil are proportional to the number of turns in the coil. Lenz also announced at that time [[Lenz's law|his important law]] that, in all cases of electromagnetic induction the induced currents have such a direction that their reaction tends to stop the motion that produces them, a law that was perhaps deducible from Faraday's explanation of Arago's rotations.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" /><ref>For more, see [[Counter-electromotive force]].</ref>

The [[induction coil]] was first designed by [[Nicholas Callan]] in 1836. In 1845 [[Joseph Henry]], the American physicist, published an account of his valuable and interesting experiments with induced currents of a high order, showing that currents could be induced from the secondary of an induction coil to the primary of a second coil, thence to its secondary wire, and so on to the primary of a third coil, etc.<ref>Philosophical Magazine, 1849.</ref> [[Heinrich Daniel Ruhmkorff]] further developed the induction coil, the [[Ruhmkorff coil]] was patented in 1851,<ref>Ruhmkorff's version coil was such a success that in 1858 he was awarded a 50,000-franc prize by [[Napoleon III]] for the most important discovery in the application of electricity.</ref> and he utilized long windings of copper wire to achieve a spark of approximately 2&nbsp;inches (50&nbsp;mm) in length.

Up to the middle of the 19th century, indeed up to about 1870, electrical science was, it may be said, a sealed book to the majority of electrical workers. Prior to this time a number of handbooks had been published on electricity and magnetism, notably [[Auguste de La Rive]]'s exhaustive ' ''[[La Rive's Treatise on Electricity|Treatise on Electricity]]'','<ref>La, R. A. (1853). [https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonelec00rivegoog A treatise on electricity: In theory and practice]. London: Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans.</ref> in 1851 (French) and 1853 (English); [[August Beer]]'s ''Einleitung in die Elektrostatik, die Lehre vom Magnetismus und die Elektrodynamik'',<ref>tr., Introduction to electrostatics, the study of magnetism and electrodynamics</ref> [[Gustav Heinrich Wiedemann|Wiedemann]]'s ' ''[[Galvanismus]]'',' and Reiss'<ref>May be [[Johann Philipp Reis]], of Friedrichsdorf, Germany</ref> '''[[Reibungsal-elektricitat]]''.' But these works consisted in the main in details of experiments with electricity and magnetism, and but little with the laws and facts of those phenomena. [[Henry d'Abria]]<ref>"On a permanent Deflection of the Galvanometer-needle under the influence of a rapid series of equal and opposite induced Currents". By Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S..

London: Longmans, Green, and Co</ref> ' and Clerk Maxwell's ' ''[[Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' ' were published.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

These books were departures from the beaten path. As Jenkin states in the preface to his work the science of the schools was so dissimilar from that of the practical electrician that it was quite impossible to give students sufficient, or even approximately sufficient, textbooks. A student he said might have mastered de la Rive's large and valuable treatise and yet feel as if in an unknown country and listening to an unknown tongue in the company of practical men. As another writer has said, with the coming of Jenkin's and Maxwell's books all impediments in the way of electrical students were removed, "''the full meaning of Ohm's law becomes clear; electromotive force, difference of potential, resistance, current, capacity, lines of force, magnetization and chemical affinity were measurable, and could be reasoned about, and calculations could be made about them with as much certainty as calculations in dynamics''".<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" /><ref>Introduction to 'Electricity in the Service of Man'.</ref>

About 1850, [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]] published his laws relating to branched or divided circuits. He also showed mathematically that according to the then prevailing electrodynamic theory, electricity would be propagated along a perfectly conducting wire with the velocity of light. [[Helmholtz]] investigated mathematically the effects of induction upon the strength of a current and deduced therefrom equations, which experiment confirmed, showing amongst other important points the retarding effect of self-induction under certain conditions of the circuit.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" /><ref>'Poggendorf Ann.1 1851.</ref>

[[File:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sir William Thomson]].]]
In 1853, [[Sir William Thomson]] (later [[Lord Kelvin]]) predicted as a result
of mathematical calculations the oscillatory nature of the electric discharge of a condenser circuit. To Henry, however, belongs the credit of discerning as a result of his experiments in 1842 the oscillatory nature of the [[Leyden jar]] discharge. He wrote:<ref>Proc. Am. Phil. Soc.,Vol. II, pp. 193</ref> ''The phenomena require us to admit the existence of a principal discharge in one direction, and then several reflex actions backward and forward, each more feeble than the preceding, until the equilibrium is obtained''. These oscillations were subsequently observed by [[B. W. Feddersen]] (1857)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=j2UEAAAAYAAJ Annalen der Physik, Volume 103]. ''Contributions to the acquaintance with the electric spark'', B. W. Feddersen.

In Kiel.)</ref> who using a rotating concave mirror projected an image of the electric spark upon a sensitive plate, thereby obtaining a photograph of the spark which plainly indicated the alternating nature of the discharge. Sir William Thomson was also the discoverer of the electric convection of heat (the [[Thomson effect|"Thomson" effect]]). He designed for electrical measurements of precision his quadrant and absolute electrometers. The [[Mirror galvanometer|reflecting galvanometer]] and [[siphon recorder]], as applied to submarine cable signaling, are also due to him.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

About 1876 the American physicist [[Henry Augustus Rowland]] of Baltimore demonstrated the important fact that a static charge carried around produces the same magnetic effects as an electric current.<ref>Rowland, H. A. (1902). [https://books.google.com/books?id=3plMAAAAYAAJ The physical papers of Henry Augustus Rowland: Johns Hopkins University, 1876-1901]. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.</ref><ref>LII.

After Faraday's discovery that electric currents could be developed in a wire by causing it to cut across the lines of force of a magnet, it was to be expected that attempts would be made to construct machines to avail of this fact in the development of voltaic currents.<ref>See [[electric machinery]], [[electric direct current]], [[electrical generator]]s.</ref> The first machine of this kind was due to [[Hippolyte Pixii]], 1832. It consisted of two bobbins of iron wire, opposite which the poles of a horseshoe magnet were caused to rotate. As this produced in the coils of the wire an [[alternating current]], Pixii arranged a commutating device (commutator) that converted the alternating current of the coils or [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] into a [[direct current]] in the external circuit. This machine was followed by improved forms of magneto-electric machines due to [[Edward Samuel Ritchie]], [[Joseph Saxton]], [[Edward M. Clarke]] 1834, [[Emil Stohrer]] 1843, [[Floris Nollet]] 1849, [[Shepperd]]{{who?|date=May 2018}} 1856, [[M. Joseph Van Malderen|Van Maldern]]{{who?|date=May 2018}}, [[Werner von Siemens]], [[Henry Wilde (engineer)|Henry Wilde]] and others.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

A notable advance in the art of [[dynamo]] construction was made by [[Samuel Alfred Varley]] in 1866<ref>consult his British patent of that year</ref> and by Siemens and [[Charles Wheatstone]],<ref>consult 'Royal Society Proceedings, 1867 VOL. 10—12</ref> who independently discovered that when a coil of wire, or armature, of the dynamo machine is rotated between the poles (or in the "field") of an electromagnet, a weak current is set up in the coil due to residual magnetism in the iron of the electromagnet, and that if the circuit of the armature be connected with the circuit of the electromagnet, the weak current developed in the armature increases the magnetism in the field. This further increases the magnetic lines of force in which the armature rotates, which still further increases the current in the electromagnet, thereby producing a corresponding increase in the field magnetism, and so on, until the maximum electromotive force which the machine is capable of developing is reached. By means of this principle the dynamo machine develops its own [[magnetic field]], thereby much increasing its efficiency and economical operation. Not by any means, however, was the dynamo electric machine perfected at the time mentioned.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

In 1860 an important improvement had been made by Dr. [[Antonio Pacinotti]] of Pisa who devised the first electric machine with a ring armature. This machine was first used as an electric motor, but afterward as a generator of electricity. The discovery of the principle of the reversibility of the dynamo electric machine (variously attributed to [[William Henry Walenn|Walenn]] 1860; [[Pacinotti]] 1864 ; [[Hippolyte Fontaine|Fontaine]], [[Zénobe Gramme|Gramme]] 1873; [[Marcel Deprez|Deprez]] 1881, and others) whereby it may be used as an electric motor or as a generator of electricity has been termed one of the greatest discoveries of the 19th century.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />
[[File:Siemens Hefner-Alteneck Dynamomaschine.png|thumb|Siemens Hefner-Alteneck Dynamomaschine]]
In 1872 the drum armature was devised by [[Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck|Hefner-Alteneck]]. This machine in a modified form was subsequently known as the Siemens dynamo.

Beginning about 1887 [[alternating current]] generators came into extensive operation and the commercial development of the transformer, by means of which currents of low voltage and high current strength are transformed to currents of high voltage and low current strength, and vice versa, in time revolutionized the transmission of electric power to long distances. Likewise the introduction of the rotary converter (in connection with the "step-down" transformer) which converts alternating currents into direct currents (and vice versa) has effected large economies in the operation of electric power systems.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" /><ref>See Electric alternating current machinery.</ref>

Before the introduction of dynamo electric machines, voltaic, or primary, batteries were extensively used for electro-plating and in telegraphy. There are two distinct types of voltaic cells, namely, the "open" and the "closed", or "constant", type. The open type in brief is that type which operated on closed circuit becomes, after a short time, polarized; that is, gases are liberated in the cell which settle on the negative plate and establish a resistance that reduces the current strength. After a brief interval of open circuit these gases are eliminated or absorbed and the cell is again ready for operation. Closed circuit cells are those in which the gases in the cells are absorbed as quickly as liberated and hence the output of the cell is practically uniform. The [[Leclanché cell|Leclanché]] and [[Daniell cell]]s, respectively, are familiar examples of the "open" and "closed" type of voltaic cell. Batteries of the Daniell or "gravity" type were employed almost generally in the United States and Canada as the source of electromotive force in telegraphy before the dynamo machine became available.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

In the late 19th century, the term [[luminiferous aether]], meaning light-bearing [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], was a conjectured medium for the propagation of light.<ref>The 19th century science book [[A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar]] provides a brief summary of scientific thinking in this field at the time.</ref>  The word ''aether'' stems via [[Latin]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] αιθήρ, from a root meaning to kindle, burn, or shine. It signifies the substance which was thought in ancient times to fill the upper regions of space, beyond the clouds.

===Maxwell===
[[File:James Clerk Maxwell.png|thumb|upright|[[James Clerk Maxwell]].]]
In 1864 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] of Edinburgh announced his electromagnetic theory of light, which was perhaps the greatest single step in the world's knowledge of electricity.<ref>Consult Maxwell's 'Electricity and Magnetism,1 Vol. II, Chap. xx</ref>  Maxwell had studied and commented on the field of electricity and magnetism as early as 1855/6 when ''[[On Faraday's lines of force]]''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.blazelabs.com/On%20Faraday's%20Lines%20of%20Force.pdf |title=On Faraday's Lines of Force' byJames Clerk Maxwell 1855 |access-date=2010-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215085100/http://blazelabs.com/On%20Faraday's%20Lines%20of%20Force.pdf |archive-date=2010-12-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> was read to the [[Cambridge Philosophical Society]]. The paper presented a simplified model of Faraday's work, and how the two phenomena were related. He reduced all of the current knowledge into a linked set of [[differential equation]]s with 20 equations in 20 variables. This work was later published as ''[[On Physical Lines of Force]]'' in March 1861.<ref>James Clerk Maxwell, ''[[Media:On Physical Lines of Force.pdf|On Physical Lines of Force]]'', Philosophical Magazine, 1861</ref> In order to determine the force which is acting on any part of the machine we must find its momentum, and then calculate the rate at which this momentum is being changed. This rate of change will give us the force. The method of calculation which it is necessary to employ was first given by [[Lagrange]], and afterwards developed, with some modifications, by [[Hamilton's equations]]. It is usually referred to as [[Hamilton's principle]]; when the equations in the original form are used they are known as [[Lagrange's equations]]. Now Maxwell logically showed how these methods of calculation could be applied to the electro-magnetic field.<ref>In November 1847, Clerk Maxwell entered the University of Edinburgh, learning mathematics from Kelland, natural philosophy from J. D. Forbes, and logic from Sir W. R. Hamilton.</ref> The energy of a [[dynamical system]] is partly [[Kinematics|kinetic]], partly [[potential theory|potential]]. Maxwell supposes that the [[magnetic energy]] of the field is [[kinetic energy]], the [[electric energy]] [[Electric potential|potential]].<ref>Glazebrook, R. (1896). James Clerk Maxwell and modern physics. New York: Macmillan.[https://books.google.com/books?id=rX9LAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA190 Pg. 190]</ref>

Around 1862, while lecturing at King's College, Maxwell calculated that the speed of propagation of an electromagnetic field is approximately that of the speed of light. He considered this to be more than just a coincidence, and commented "''We can scarcely avoid the conclusion that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.''"<ref name=mactutor>J J O'Connor and E F Robertson, ''[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Maxwell.html James Clerk Maxwell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128034939/http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Maxwell.html |date=2011-01-28 }}'', School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland, November 1997</ref>

Working on the problem further, Maxwell [[Electromagnetic wave equation|showed]] that the equations predict the existence of [[electromagnetic radiation|waves]] of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments; using the data available at the time, Maxwell obtained a velocity of 310,740,000 [[Metre per second|m/s]]. In his 1864 paper ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]'', Maxwell wrote, ''The agreement of the results seems to show that light and magnetism are affections of the same substance, and that light is an electromagnetic disturbance propagated through the field according to electromagnetic laws''.<ref>James Clerk Maxwell, ''[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]'', Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London 155, 459-512 (1865).</ref>

As already noted herein Faraday, and before him, Ampère and others, had inklings that the luminiferous ether of space was also the medium for electric action. It was known by calculation and experiment that the velocity of electricity was approximately 186,000 miles per second; that is, equal to the velocity of light, which in itself suggests the idea of a relationship between -electricity and "light." A number of the earlier philosophers or mathematicians, as Maxwell terms them, of the 19th century, held the view that electromagnetic phenomena were explainable by action at a distance. Maxwell, following Faraday, contended that the seat of the phenomena was in the medium. The methods of the mathematicians in arriving at their results were synthetical while Faraday's methods were analytical. Faraday in his mind's eye saw lines of force traversing all space where the mathematicians saw centres of force attracting at a distance. Faraday sought the seat of the phenomena in real actions going on in the medium; they were satisfied that they had found it in a power of action at a distance on the electric fluids.<ref>Maxwell's 'Electricity and Magnetism,' preface</ref>

Both of these methods, as Maxwell points out, had succeeded in explaining the propagation of light as an electromagnetic phenomenon while at the same time the fundamental conceptions of what the quantities concerned are, radically differed. The mathematicians assumed that insulators were barriers to electric currents; that, for instance, in a Leyden jar or electric condenser the electricity was accumulated at one plate and that by some occult action at a distance electricity of an opposite kind was attracted to the other plate.

Maxwell, looking further than Faraday, reasoned that if light is an electromagnetic phenomenon and is transmissible through dielectrics such as glass, the phenomenon must be in the nature of electromagnetic currents in the dielectrics. He therefore contended that in the charging of a condenser, for instance, the action did not stop at the insulator, but that some "displacement" currents are set up in the insulating medium, which currents continue until the resisting force of the medium equals that of the charging force. In a closed conductor circuit, an electric current is also a displacement of electricity.

The conductor offers a certain resistance, akin to friction, to the displacement of electricity, and heat is developed in the conductor, proportional to the square of the current (as already stated herein), which current flows as long as the impelling [[electric force]] continues. This resistance may be likened to that met with by a ship as it displaces in the water in its progress. The resistance of the dielectric is of a different nature and has been compared to the compression of multitudes of springs, which, under compression, yield with an increasing back pressure, up to a point where the total back pressure equals the initial pressure. When the initial pressure is withdrawn the energy expended in compressing the "springs" is returned to the circuit, concurrently with the return of the springs to their original condition, this producing a reaction in the opposite direction. Consequently, the current due to the displacement of electricity in a conductor may be continuous, while the displacement currents in a dielectric are momentary and, in a circuit or medium which contains but little resistance compared with capacity or inductance reaction, the currents of discharge are of an oscillatory or alternating nature.<ref>See [[oscillating current]], [[telegraphy]], [[wireless]].</ref>

Maxwell extended this view of displacement currents in dielectrics to the ether of free space. Assuming light to be the manifestation of alterations of electric currents in the ether, and vibrating at the rate of light vibrations, these vibrations by induction set up corresponding vibrations in adjoining portions of the ether, and in this way the undulations corresponding to those of light are propagated as an electromagnetic effect in the ether. Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light obviously involved the existence of electric waves in free space, and his followers set themselves the task of experimentally demonstrating the truth of the theory. By 1871, he presented the ''[[Remarks on the mathematical classification of physical quantities]]''.<ref>Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, Volume 3. [[London Mathematical Society]], 1871. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lekKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA224 Pg. 224]</ref>

===End of the 19th century===
[[File:Heinrich Rudolf Hertz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Heinrich Hertz]].]]
In 1887, the German physicist [[Heinrich Hertz]] in a series of experiments proved the actual existence of [[electromagnetic wave]]s, showing that transverse [[free space]] electromagnetic waves can travel over some distance as predicted by Maxwell and Faraday. Hertz published his work in a book titled: ''Electric waves: being researches on the propagation of electric action with finite velocity through space''.<ref>{{cite book| author = Heinrich Hertz| title = Electric Waves: Being Researches on the Propagation of Electric Action with Finite Velocity Through Space| url = https://archive.org/details/electricwavesbe00hertgoog| year = 1893| publisher = Dover Publications}}</ref> The discovery of electromagnetic waves in space led to the development of radio in the closing years of the 19th century.

The [[electron]] as a unit of charge in electrochemistry was posited by [[G. Johnstone Stoney]] in 1874, who also coined the term ''electron'' in 1894.<ref name="guarnieri 7-3">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2015|title=How the Genie of Electronics Sprung Out|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=9|issue=1|pages=77–79|doi=10.1109/MIE.2014.2387945|s2cid=9232535}}</ref> [[plasma (physics)|Plasma]] was first identified in a [[Crookes tube]], and so described by [[Sir William Crookes]] in 1879 (he called it "radiant matter").<ref>Crookes presented a lecture to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], in Sheffield, on Friday, 22 August 1879 [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/5dcb9349d366f8ec.html] [http://www.tfcbooks.com/mall/more/315rm.htm]</ref> The place of electricity in leading up to the discovery of those beautiful phenomena of the Crookes Tube (due to Sir William Crookes), viz., Cathode rays,<ref>consult 'Proc.

It has been noted herein that Dr. William Gilbert was termed the founder of electrical science. This must, however, be regarded as a comparative statement.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />
[[File:Oliver Heaviside2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Oliver Heaviside]]]]
[[Oliver Heaviside]] was a self-taught scholar who reformulated Maxwell's field equations in terms of electric and magnetic forces and energy flux, and independently co-formulated [[vector analysis]].

During the late 1890s a number of physicists proposed that electricity, as observed in studies of electrical conduction in conductors, electrolytes, and [[cathode ray tube]]s, consisted of discrete units, which were given a variety of names, but the reality of these units had not been confirmed in a compelling way. However, there were also indications that the cathode rays had wavelike properties.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

Faraday, [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]], [[William Kingdon Clifford|Clifford]] and others had glimpses of this view; and the experimental works of [[Pieter Zeeman|Zeeman]], [[Eugen Goldstein|Goldstein]], Crookes, [[J. J. Thomson]] and others had greatly strengthened this view. Weber predicted that electrical phenomena were due to the existence of electrical atoms, the influence of which on one another depended on their position and relative accelerations and velocities. Helmholtz and others also contended that the existence of electrical atoms followed from Faraday's laws of [[electrolysis]], and Johnstone Stoney, to whom is due the term "electron", showed that each chemical ion of the decomposed electrolyte carries a definite and constant quantity of electricity, and inasmuch as these charged ions are separated on the [[electrode]]s as neutral substances there must be an instant, however brief, when the charges must be capable of existing separately as electrical atoms; while in 1887, [[William Kingdon Clifford|Clifford]] wrote: "There is great reason to believe that every material atom carries upon it a small electric current, if it does not wholly consist of this current."<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

In 1896, [[J. J. Thomson]] performed experiments indicating that cathode rays really were particles, found an accurate value for their charge-to-mass ratio e/m, and found that e/m was independent of cathode material. He made good estimates of both the charge e and the mass m, finding that cathode ray particles, which he called "corpuscles", had perhaps one thousandth of the mass of the least massive ion known (hydrogen). He further showed that the negatively charged particles produced by radioactive materials, by heated materials, and by illuminated materials, were universal. The nature of the Crookes tube "[[cathode ray]]" matter was identified by Thomson in 1897.<ref>Announced in his evening lecture to the [[Royal Institution]] on Friday, 30 April 1897, and published in ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', 44, 293 [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~GIUNTA/thomson1897.html]</ref>{{primary source inline|date=October 2013}}

In the late 19th century, the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] was performed by [[Albert A. Michelson]] and [[Edward W. Morley]] at what is now [[Case Western Reserve University]]. It is generally considered to be the evidence against the theory of a [[luminiferous aether]]. The experiment has also been referred to as "the kicking-off point for the theoretical aspects of the Second Scientific Revolution."<ref>Earl R. Hoover, ''Cradle of Greatness: National and World Achievements of Ohio's Western Reserve'' (Cleveland: Shaker Savings Association, 1977).</ref> Primarily for this work, Michelson was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1907. [[Dayton Miller]] continued with experiments, conducting thousands of measurements and eventually developing the most accurate interferometer in the world at that time.

By the end of the 19th century [[electrical engineer]]s had become a distinct profession, separate from physicists and inventors. They created companies that investigated, developed and perfected the techniques of electricity transmission, and gained support from governments all over the world for starting the first worldwide electrical telecommunication network, the [[electrical telegraph|telegraph network]]. Pioneers in this field included [[Werner von Siemens]], founder of [[Siemens]] AG in 1847, and [[John Pender]], founder of [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable & Wireless]].

[[William Stanley Jr.|William Stanley]] made the first public demonstration of a [[transformer]] that enabled commercial delivery of  alternating current in 1886.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Blalock|first1=Thomas J.|title=Alternating Current Electrification, 1886|url=http://ethw.org/Milestones:Alternating_Current_Electrification,_1886|website=Engineering and Technology History Wiki|publisher=United Engineering Foundation|accessdate=22 April 2018}}{{cite web|title=Stanley Transformer - 1886|date=10 December 2014|url=https://nationalmaglab.org/education/magnet-academy/history-of-electricity-magnetism/museum/stanley-transformer|website=Magnet Academy|publisher=National High Magnetic Field Laboratory|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref> Large two-phase alternating current generators were built by a British electrician, [[James Edward Henry Gordon|J.

[[Lord Kelvin]] and [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti|Sebastian Ferranti]] also developed early alternators, producing frequencies between 100 and 300 hertz. After 1891, [[Polyphase system|polyphase]] alternators were introduced to supply currents of multiple differing phases.<ref>Thompson, Silvanus P., ''Dynamo-Electric Machinery''. pp. 17</ref> Later alternators were designed for varying alternating-current frequencies between sixteen and about one hundred hertz, for use with arc lighting, incandescent lighting and electric motors.<ref>Thompson, Silvanus P., ''Dynamo-Electric Machinery''. pp. 16</ref>

The possibility of obtaining the electric current in large quantities, and economically, by means of dynamo electric machines gave impetus to the development of incandescent and arc lighting. Until these machines had attained a commercial basis voltaic batteries were the only available source of current for electric lighting and power. The cost of these batteries, however, and the difficulties of maintaining them in reliable operation were prohibitory of their use for practical lighting purposes. The date of the employment of arc and [[incandescent lamp]]s may be set at about 1877.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

Even in 1880, however, but little headway had been made toward the general use of these illuminants; the rapid subsequent growth of this industry is a matter of general knowledge.<ref>See [[electric lighting]]</ref> The employment of [[storage batteries]], which were originally termed secondary batteries or accumulators, began about 1879. Such batteries are now utilized on a large scale as auxiliaries to the dynamo machine in electric power-houses and substations, in electric automobiles and in immense numbers in automobile ignition and starting systems, also in fire alarm telegraphy and other signal systems.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

For the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Columbian International Exposition]] in Chicago, [[General Electric]] proposed to power the entire fair with [[direct current]].

===Second Industrial Revolution===
{{main|Second Industrial Revolution}}

The Second Industrial Revolution, also known as the Technological Revolution, was a phase of rapid [[industrialization]] in the final third of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. Along with the expansion of [[railroad]]s, iron and [[steel]] production, widespread use of [[machinery]] in manufacturing, greatly increased use of steam power and [[petroleum]], the period saw expansion in the use electricity and the adaption of electromagnetic theory in developing various technologies. 

[[File:Nikola Tesla's personal exhibit at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition Fair.png|thumb|left|1893 Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] display of Tesla patent AC [[induction motor]]s]]
The 1880s saw the spread of large scale commercial electric power systems, first used for lighting and eventually for electro-motive power and heating. Systems early on used [[alternating current]] and [[direct current]]. Large centralized power generation became possible when it was recognized that alternating current electric power lines could use [[transformer]]s  to take advantage of the fact that each doubling of the voltage would allow the same size cable to transmit the same amount of power four times the distance. Transformer were used to raise voltage at the point of generation (a representative number is a generator voltage in the low kilovolt range) to a much higher voltage (tens of thousands to several hundred thousand volts) for primary transmission, followed to several downward transformations, for commercial and residential domestic use.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" /> Between 1885 and 1890 poly-phase currents combined with [[electromagnetic induction]] and practical AC [[induction motor]]s were developed.<ref>Giovanni Dosi, David J. Teece, Josef Chytry, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2qfRJuJ0QDgC&pg=PA336&dq=%22Nikola+Tesla,+in+the+United+States,+Galileo+Ferraris+of+Italy,+and+Michael+Osipowitch+von%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=43dRUsK_J8j84AOVkoGwDA&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Nikola%20Tesla%2C%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C%20Galileo%20Ferraris%20of%20Italy%2C%20and%20Michael%20Osipowitch%20von%22&f=false Understanding Industrial and Corporate Change], [[Oxford University Press]], 2004,  page 336.

The [[International Electro-Technical Exhibition - 1891|International Electro-Technical Exhibition of 1891]] featuring the long-distance transmission of high-power, three-phase electric current. It was held between 16 May and 19 October on the disused site of the three former "Westbahnhöfe" (Western Railway Stations) in Frankfurt am Main. The exhibition featured the first long-distance transmission of high-power, three-phase electric current, which was generated 175&nbsp;km away at Lauffen am Neckar. As a result of this successful field trial, three-phase current became established for electrical transmission networks throughout the world.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" />

Much was done in the direction in the improvement of railroad terminal facilities, and it is difficult to find one steam railroad engineer who would have denied that all the important steam railroads of this country were not to be operated electrically. In other directions the progress of events as to the utilization of electric power was expected to be equally rapid. In every part of the world the power of falling water, nature's perpetual motion machine, which has been going to waste since the world began, is now being converted into electricity and transmitted by wire hundreds of miles to points where it is usefully and economically employed.<ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana" /><ref>See [[Electric transmission of energy]].</ref>

==20th century==
Various units of electricity and magnetism have been adopted and named by representatives of the electrical engineering institutes of the world, which units and names have been confirmed and legalized by the governments of the United States and other countries. Thus the volt, from the Italian Volta, has been adopted as the practical unit of electromotive force, the ohm, from the enunciator of Ohm's law, as the practical unit of resistance; the [[ampere]], after the eminent French scientist of that name, as the practical unit of current strength, the henry as the practical unit of inductance, after Joseph Henry and in recognition of his early and important experimental work in mutual induction.<ref>See [[electrical units]], [[electrical terms]].</ref>

Dewar and [[John Ambrose Fleming]] predicted that at [[absolute zero]], pure metals would become perfect electromagnetic conductors (though, later, Dewar altered his opinion on the disappearance of resistance believing that there would always be some resistance). [[Walther Nernst|Walther Hermann Nernst]] developed the [[third law of thermodynamics]] and stated that absolute zero was unattainable. [[Carl von Linde]] and [[William Hampson]], both commercial researchers, nearly at the same time filed for patents on the [[Joule–Thomson effect]]. Linde's patent was the climax of 20 years of systematic investigation of established facts, using a regenerative counterflow method. Hampson's design was also of a regenerative method. The combined process became known as the [[Linde–Hampson liquefaction process]]. [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] purchased a Linde machine for his research. [[Zygmunt Florenty Wróblewski]] conducted research into electrical properties at low temperatures, though his research ended early due to his accidental death. Around 1864, [[Karol Olszewski]] and Wroblewski predicted the electrical phenomena of dropping resistance levels at ultra-cold temperatures. Olszewski and Wroblewski documented evidence of this in the 1880s. A milestone was achieved on 10 July 1908 when Onnes at the [[Leiden University]] in [[Leiden]] produced, for the first time, [[liquid helium|liquified helium]] and achieved [[superconductivity]].

In 1900, [[William Du Bois Duddell]] develops the [[Singing Arc]] and produced melodic sounds, from a low to a high-tone, from this arc lamp.

===Lorentz and Poincaré===
{{main|History of special relativity|Lorentz ether theory}}
[[File:Hendrik Antoon Lorentz.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hendrik Lorentz]]]]
Between 1900 and 1910, many scientists like [[Wilhelm Wien]], [[Max Abraham]], [[Hermann Minkowski]], or [[Gustav Mie]] believed that all forces of nature are of electromagnetic origin (the so-called "electromagnetic world view"). This was connected with the [[electron]] theory developed between 1892 and 1904 by [[Hendrik Lorentz]]. Lorentz introduced a strict separation between matter (electrons) and the aether, whereby in his model the ether is completely motionless, and it won't be set in motion in the neighborhood of ponderable matter. Contrary to other electron models before, the electromagnetic field of the ether appears as a mediator between the electrons, and changes in this field can propagate not faster than the speed of light.

In 1896, three years after submitting his thesis on the [[Kerr effect]], [[Pieter Zeeman]] disobeyed the direct orders of his supervisor and used laboratory equipment to measure the splitting of spectral lines by a strong magnetic field. Lorentz theoretically explained the [[Zeeman effect]] on the basis of his theory, for which both received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1902. A fundamental concept of Lorentz's theory in 1895 was the "theorem of corresponding states" for terms of order v/c. This theorem states that a moving observer (relative to the ether) makes the same observations as a resting observer. This theorem was extended for terms of all orders by Lorentz in 1904. Lorentz noticed, that it was necessary to change the space-time variables when changing frames and introduced concepts like physical [[length contraction]] (1892) to explain the Michelson–Morley experiment, and the mathematical concept of [[Relativity of simultaneity|local time]] (1895) to explain the [[aberration of light]] and the [[Fizeau experiment]]. That resulted in the formulation of the so-called [[Lorentz transformation]] by [[Joseph Larmor]] (1897, 1900) and Lorentz (1899, 1904).<ref name="Miller 1981, Ch. 1">Miller 1981, Ch. 1</ref><ref name="Pais 1982, Ch. 6b">Pais 1982, Ch. 6b</ref><ref name=jan>Janssen, 2007</ref> As Lorentz later noted (1921, 1928), he considered the time indicated by clocks resting in the aether as "true" time, while local time was seen by him as a heuristic working hypothesis and a mathematical artifice.<ref name=lore>{{Citation|author=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon|year=1921|title=Deux Mémoires de Henri Poincaré sur la Physique Mathématique|trans-title=[[s:Translation:Two Papers of Henri Poincaré on Mathematical Physics|Two Papers of Henri Poincaré on Mathematical Physics]]

[[File:JH Poincare.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Poincaré]]]]
Continuing the work of Lorentz, [[Henri Poincaré]] between 1895 and 1905 formulated on many occasions the [[principle of relativity]] and tried to harmonize it with electrodynamics. He declared simultaneity only a convenient convention which depends on the speed of light, whereby the constancy of the speed of light would be a useful [[postulate]] for making the laws of nature as simple as possible. In 1900 he interpreted Lorentz's local time as the result of clock synchronization by light signals, and introduced the electromagnetic momentum by comparing electromagnetic energy to what he called a "fictitious fluid" of mass <math>m=E/c^2</math>. And finally in June and July 1905 he declared the relativity principle a general law of nature, including gravitation. He corrected some mistakes of Lorentz and proved the Lorentz covariance of the electromagnetic equations. Poincaré also suggested that there exist non-electrical forces to stabilize the electron configuration and asserted that gravitation is a non-electrical force as well, contrary to the electromagnetic world view. However, historians pointed out that he still used the notion of an ether and distinguished between "apparent" and "real" time and therefore didn't invent [[special relativity]] in its modern understanding.<ref name=jan /><ref>Galison 2002</ref><ref>Darrigol 2005</ref><ref>Katzir 2005</ref><ref>Miller 1981, Ch. 1.7 & 1.14</ref><ref>Pais 1982, Ch. 6 & 8</ref>

===Einstein's ''Annus Mirabilis''===
{{main|Annus Mirabilis papers}}
[[File:Einstein patentoffice.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albert Einstein]], 1905]]
In 1905, while he was working in the patent office, [[Albert Einstein]] had four papers published in the ''[[Annalen der Physik]]'', the leading German physics journal. These are the papers that history has come to call the ''[[Annus Mirabilis papers]]'':
*His paper on the particulate nature of light put forward the idea that certain experimental results, notably the [[photoelectric effect]], could be simply understood from the postulate that light interacts with matter as discrete "packets" ([[quantum|quanta]]) of energy, an idea that had been introduced by [[Max Planck]] in 1900 as a purely mathematical manipulation, and which seemed to contradict contemporary wave theories of light {{harv|Einstein|1905a}}. This was the only work of Einstein's that he himself called "revolutionary."
*His paper on [[Brownian motion]] explained the random movement of very small objects as direct evidence of molecular action, thus supporting the [[atomic theory]]. {{harv|Einstein|1905b}}
*His paper on the [[electrodynamics]] of moving bodies introduced the radical theory of [[special relativity]], which showed that the observed independence of the [[speed of light]] on the observer's state of motion required fundamental changes to the [[Relativity of simultaneity|notion of simultaneity]]. Consequences of this include the [[Spacetime|time-space frame]] of a moving body [[Time dilation|slowing down]] and [[Length contraction|contracting]] (in the direction of motion) relative to the frame of the observer. This paper also argued that the idea of a [[luminiferous aether]]—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous. {{harv|Einstein|1905c}}
*In his paper on [[mass–energy equivalence]] (previously considered to be distinct concepts), Einstein deduced from his equations of special relativity what later became the well-known expression: <math>E = m c^2</math>, suggesting that tiny amounts of mass could be [[mass–energy equivalence|converted]] into huge amounts of energy. {{harv|Einstein|1905d}}

All four papers are today recognized as tremendous achievements—and hence 1905 is known as Einstein's "[[Annus mirabilis|Wonderful Year]]". At the time, however, they were not noticed by most physicists as being important, and many of those who did notice them rejected them outright. Some of this work—such as the theory of light quanta—remained controversial for years.<ref>On the reception of relativity theory around the world, and the different controversies it encountered, see the articles in Thomas F.

}}</ref> These experiments unequivocally exposed discrepancies which the theory was unable to explain. With the invention of [[bubble chamber]]s and [[spark chamber]]s in the 1950s, experimental [[particle physics]] discovered a large and ever-growing number of particles called [[hadron]]s. It seemed that such a large number of particles could not all be [[fundamental particles|fundamental]].

Shortly after the end of the war in 1945, Bell Labs formed a Solid State Physics Group, led by [[William Shockley]] and chemist Stanley Morgan; other personnel including [[John Bardeen]] and [[Walter Brattain]], physicist Gerald Pearson, chemist Robert Gibney, electronics expert Hilbert Moore and several technicians.  Their assignment was to seek a solid-state alternative to fragile glass [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers.  Their first attempts were based on Shockley's ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity. These experiments failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials. The group was at a standstill until Bardeen suggested a theory that invoked [[surface states]] that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor. The group changed its focus to study these surface states and they met almost daily to discuss the work.  The rapport of the group was excellent, and ideas were freely exchanged.<ref>Brattain quoted in Michael Riordan and Lillian Hoddeson; ''Crystal Fire: The Invention of the Transistor and the Birth of the Information Age''.

As to the problems in the electron experiments, a path to a solution was given by [[Hans Bethe]].

</ref> Despite the limitations of the computation, agreement was excellent. The idea was simply to attach infinities to corrections at [[mass]] and [[Electric charge|charge]] that were actually fixed to a finite value by experiments. In this way, the infinities get absorbed in those constants and yield a finite result in good agreement with experiments. This procedure was named [[renormalization]].

[[Philo Farnsworth]] developed the [[Fusor|Farnsworth–Hirsch Fusor]], or simply fusor, an apparatus designed by Farnsworth to create [[nuclear fusion]]. Unlike most controlled fusion systems, which slowly heat a magnetically confined [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], the fusor injects high temperature [[ion]]s directly into a reaction chamber, thereby avoiding a considerable amount of complexity. When the Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor was first introduced to the fusion research world in the late 1960s, the Fusor was the first device that could clearly demonstrate it was producing fusion reactions at all.  Hopes at the time were high that it could be quickly developed into a practical power source. However, as with other fusion experiments, development into a power source has proven difficult.  Nevertheless, the fusor has since become a practical neutron source and is produced commercially for this role.<ref name="Fusor1">Cartlidge, Edwin. "The Secret World of Amateur Fusion".

=== Parity violation ===

The mirror image of an electromagnet produces a field with the opposite polarity.  Thus the north and south poles of a magnet have the same symmetry as left and right.  Prior to 1956, it was believed that this symmetry was perfect, and that a technician would be unable to distinguish the north and south poles of a magnet except by reference to left and right.  In that year, T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang predicted the nonconservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]] in the weak interaction.  To the surprise of many physicists, in 1957 [[Wu experiment|C. S. Wu and collaborators]] at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards demonstrated that under suitable conditions for polarization of nuclei, the [[beta decay]] of [[cobalt-60]] preferentially releases electrons toward the south pole of an external magnetic field, and a somewhat higher number of gamma rays toward the north pole.  As a result, the experimental apparatus does not behave comparably with its mirror image.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/parity.html|title=Parity|author=R.

The theory of the [[strong interaction]], to which many contributed, acquired its modern form around 1973–74, when experiments confirmed that the [[hadron]]s were composed of fractionally charged quarks.

By 2007, solid state micrometer-scale [[electric double-layer capacitor]]s based on advanced superionic conductors had been for low-voltage electronics such as deep-sub-voltage nanoelectronics and related technologies (the 22&nbsp;nm technological node of CMOS and beyond). Also, the [[nanowire battery]], a lithium-ion battery, was invented by a team led by Dr. Yi Cui in 2007.

====Magnetic resonance====
Reflecting the fundamental importance and applicability of [[Magnetic resonance imaging]]<ref>A medical imaging technique used in radiology to visualize detailed internal structures.

===Unified theories===

{{main|Grand Unified Theory}}
A Grand Unified Theory (GUT) is a model in particle physics in which, at high energy, the electromagnetic force is merged with the other two [[gauge theory|gauge interactions]] of the [[Standard Model]], the [[weak interaction|weak]] and [[strong interaction|strong]] nuclear forces. Many candidates have been proposed, but none is directly supported by experimental evidence. GUTs are often seen as intermediate steps towards a  "[[Theory of Everything]]" (TOE), a putative theory of theoretical physics that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena, and, ideally, has predictive power for the outcome of any experiment that could be carried out in principle. No such theory has yet been accepted by the physics community.

===Open problems===
{{main|Open problems in physics}}
The [[magnetic monopole]]<ref>A hypothetical [[elementary particle|particle]] in [[particle physics]] that is a [[magnet]] with only one [[wikt:magnetic pole|magnetic pole]]. In more technical terms, a magnetic monopole would have a net "magnetic charge". Modern interest in the concept stems from [[high-energy physics|particle theories]], notably the [[grand unification theory|grand unification]] and [[superstring theory|superstring]] theories, which predict their existence. See [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2004/listings/s028.pdf Particle Data Group summary of magnetic monopole search]; Wen, Xiao-Gang; Witten, Edward, ''Electric and magnetic charges in superstring models'',Nuclear Physics B, Volume 261, p. 651-677; and Coleman, ''The Magnetic Monopole 50 years Later'', reprinted in ''Aspects of Symmetry'' for more</ref> in the [[quantum mechanics|''quantum'']] theory of magnetic charge started with a paper by the [[physicist]] [[Paul A.M.

[http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/files/dirac1931.pdf Free web link].</ref> The detection of magnetic monopoles is an open problem in experimental physics. In some theoretical [[Scientific modelling|model]]s, magnetic monopoles are unlikely to be observed, because they are too massive to be created in [[particle accelerator]]s, and also too rare in the Universe to enter a [[particle detector]] with much probability.

After more than twenty years of intensive research, the origin of [[high-temperature superconductivity]] is still not clear, but it seems that instead of [[Electron-longitudinal acoustic phonon interaction|''electron-phonon'' attraction mechanisms]], as in conventional superconductivity, one is dealing with genuine [[Exchange interaction|''electronic'' mechanisms]] (e.g. by [[antiferromagnetic]] [[correlation]]s), and instead of [[s-wave]] pairing, [[Atomic orbital|d-wave]] pairings<ref>[http://musr.ca/theses/Sonier/MSc/node17.html d-Wave Pairing]. musr.ca.</ref> are substantial.<ref>[http://musr.ca/theses/Sonier/MSc/node16.html The Motivation for an Alternative Pairing Mechanism]. musr.ca.</ref> One goal of all this research is [[room-temperature superconductor|room-temperature superconductivity]].<ref>{{cite book|author = A.
