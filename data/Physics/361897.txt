In practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] and observational physics.

==History==
[[Image:NIEdot362.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Early 1900s comparison of elemental, solar, and stellar spectra]]
Astronomy is an ancient science, long separated from the study of terrestrial physics. In the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] worldview, bodies in the sky appeared to be unchanging [[Celestial spheres|spheres]] whose only motion was uniform motion in a circle, while the earthly world was the realm which underwent [[On Generation and Corruption|growth and decay]] and in which natural motion was in a straight line and ended when the moving object reached its destination.  Consequently, it was held that the celestial region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found in the terrestrial sphere; either [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] as maintained by [[Plato]], or [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]] as maintained by [[Aristotle#Physics|Aristotle]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Lloyd | first = G.

For much of the nineteenth century, astronomical research was focused on the routine work of measuring the positions and computing the motions of astronomical objects.<ref>{{Citation | last = Case | first = Stephen | date = 2015 | title = 'Land-marks of the universe': John Herschel against the background of positional astronomy | journal = Annals of Science | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 417–434 | doi = 10.1080/00033790.2015.1034588 | pmid = 26221834 | quote = The great majority of astronomers working in the early nineteenth century were not interested in stars as physical objects.

Among those who extended the study of solar and stellar spectra was [[Norman Lockyer]], who in 1868 detected radiant, as well as dark, lines in solar spectra. Working with chemist [[Edward Frankland]] to investigate the spectra of elements at various temperatures and pressures, he could not associate a yellow line in the solar spectrum with any known elements.  He thus claimed the line represented a new element, which was called [[helium]], after the Greek [[Helios]], the Sun personified.<ref>{{citation | last = Cortie | first = A.

In 1885, [[Edward C. Pickering]] undertook an ambitious program of stellar spectral classification at [[Harvard College Observatory]], in which a team of [[Harvard Computers|woman computers]], notably [[Williamina Fleming]], [[Antonia Maury]], and [[Annie Jump Cannon]], classified the spectra recorded on photographic plates. By 1890, a catalog of over 10,000 stars had been prepared that grouped them into thirteen spectral types. Following Pickering's vision, by 1924 Cannon expanded the [[Henry Draper Catalogue|catalog]] to nine volumes and over a quarter of a million stars, developing the [[Stellar classification#Harvard spectral classification|Harvard Classification Scheme]] which was accepted for worldwide use in 1922.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Hetherington |first1=Norriss S. |last2=McCray |first2=W.

Around 1920, following the discovery of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] still used as the basis for classifying stars and their evolution, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of [[nuclear fusion]] processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.<ref name=eddington>

This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fusion|last1=McCracken|editor-last2=Stott|editor-first2=Peter|editor-last=McCracken|editor-first=Garry|last2=Stott|first2=Peter|first1=Garry|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123846563000027|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-384656-3.00002-7|pages=13|isbn=978-0-12-384656-3|location=Boston|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Academic Press|quote=Eddington had realized that there would be a mass loss if four hydrogen atoms combined to form a single helium atom.

In 1925 Cecilia Helena Payne (later [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]]) wrote an influential doctoral dissertation at [[Radcliffe College]], in which she applied ionization theory to stellar atmospheres to relate the spectral classes to the temperature of stars.<ref>{{citation  |last=Payne |first=C.

Despite Eddington's suggestion, this discovery was so unexpected that her dissertation readers convinced her to modify the conclusion before publication.

By the end of the 20th century, studies of astronomical spectra had expanded to cover wavelengths extending from radio waves through optical, x-ray, and gamma wavelengths.<ref>{{cite conference |mode=cs2 |last1=Biermann |first1=Peter L. |last2=Falcke |first2=Heino |author2-link=Heino Falcke |editor-last=Panvini |editor-first=Robert S. |editor2-last=Weiler |editor2-first=Thomas J. |date=1998 |book-title=Fundamental particles and interactions: Frontiers in contemporary physics an international lecture and workshop series.

==Observational astrophysics==
[[Image:N 63A- Chandra and Hubble - Heic0507f.tif|thumb|right|200px|Supernova remnant LMC N 63A imaged in x-ray (blue), optical (green) and radio (red) wavelengths. The X-ray glow is from material heated to about ten million degrees Celsius by a shock wave generated by the supernova explosion.]]
[[Observational astronomy]] is a division of the astronomical science that is concerned with recording and interpreting data, in contrast with [[theoretical astrophysics]], which is mainly concerned with finding out the measurable implications of physical [[model (abstract)|models]]. It is the practice of observing [[celestial object]]s by using [[telescope]]s and other astronomical apparatus.

The majority of astrophysical observations are made using the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].
* [[Radio astronomy]] studies radiation with a [[wavelength]] greater than a few millimeters. Example areas of study are [[radio waves]], usually emitted by cold objects such as [[interstellar gas]] and dust clouds;  the cosmic microwave background radiation which is the [[redshift]]ed light from the [[Big Bang]]; [[pulsar]]s, which were first detected at [[microwave]] frequencies. The study of these waves requires very large [[radio telescope]]s.
* [[Infrared astronomy]] studies radiation with a wavelength that is too long to be visible to the naked eye but is shorter than radio waves. Infrared observations are usually made with telescopes similar to the familiar [[optical]] telescopes. Objects colder than stars (such as planets) are normally studied at infrared frequencies.
* [[Optical astronomy]] was the earliest kind of astronomy. Telescopes paired with a [[charge-coupled device]] or [[spectroscope]]s are the most common instruments used. The Earth's [[atmosphere]] interferes somewhat with optical observations, so [[adaptive optics]] and [[space telescope]]s are used to obtain the highest possible image quality. In this wavelength range, stars are highly visible, and many chemical spectra can be observed to study the chemical composition of stars, galaxies and [[nebula]]e.
* [[Ultraviolet]], [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] and [[gamma ray astronomy]] study very energetic processes such as [[binary pulsar]]s, [[black hole]]s, [[magnetar]]s, and many others. These kinds of radiation do not penetrate the Earth's atmosphere well. There are two methods in use to observe this part of the electromagnetic spectrum—[[space-based telescope]]s and ground-based [[imaging air Cherenkov telescope]]s (IACT). Examples of [[Observatory|Observatories]] of the first type are [[RXTE]], the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]]. Examples of IACTs are the [[High Energy Stereoscopic System]] (H.E.S.S.) and the [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]] telescope.
Other than electromagnetic radiation, few things may be observed from the Earth that originate from great distances. A few [[gravitational wave]] observatories have been constructed, but gravitational waves are extremely difficult to detect. [[Neutrino]] observatories have also been built, primarily to study our Sun. Cosmic rays consisting of very high energy particles can be observed hitting the Earth's atmosphere.

Observations can also vary in their time scale. Most optical observations take minutes to hours, so phenomena that change faster than this cannot readily be observed. However, historical data on some objects is available, spanning [[century|centuries]] or [[millennia]]. On the other hand, radio observations may look at events on a millisecond timescale ([[millisecond pulsar]]s) or combine years of data ([[Rotation-powered pulsar|pulsar deceleration]] studies). The information obtained from these different timescales is very different.

The study of our very own Sun has a special place in observational astrophysics. Due to the tremendous distance of all other stars, the Sun can be observed in a kind of detail unparalleled by any other star. Our understanding of our own Sun serves as a guide to our understanding of other stars.

The topic of how stars change, or stellar evolution, is often modeled by placing the varieties of star types in their respective positions on the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], which can be viewed as representing the state of a stellar object, from birth to destruction.

==Theoretical astrophysics==
{{see also|Theoretical astronomy}}
Theoretical astrophysicists use a wide variety of tools which include [[mathematical model|analytical models]] (for example, [[polytrope]]s to approximate the behaviors of a star) and [[computation]]al [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulations]]. Each has some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.<ref>{{Citation |first=H. |last=Roth |title=A Slowly Contracting or Expanding Fluid Sphere and its Stability |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=525–529 |year=1932 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.39.525 |bibcode = 1932PhRv...39..525R }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |first=A.S. |last=Eddington |title=Internal Constitution of the Stars |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1926 |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-521-33708-3 |pmid=17747682 }}</ref>

Theorists in astrophysics endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This helps allow observers to look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Topics studied by theoretical astrophysicists include stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including [[string theory|string]] cosmology and astroparticle physics. Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for [[black hole]] (''astro'')physics and the study of [[gravitational waves]].

Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astrophysics, now included in the [[Lambda-CDM model]], are the [[Big Bang]], [[cosmic inflation]], dark matter, dark energy and fundamental theories of physics.

== Popularization ==
The roots of astrophysics can be found in the seventeenth century emergence of a unified physics, in which the same laws applied to the celestial and terrestrial realms.<ref name = Burtt>{{Citation | last = Burtt | first = Edwin Arthur | author-link = Edwin Arthur Burtt | publication-date = 2003 | orig-year = First published 1924 | title = The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science | edition = second revised | publisher = Dover Publications | location = Mineola, NY | pages = 30, 41, 241–2 | isbn = 978-0-486-42551-1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=G9WBMa1Rz_kC | year = 2003 }}</ref>  There were scientists who were qualified in both physics and astronomy who laid the firm foundation for the current science of astrophysics.  In modern times, students continue to be drawn to astrophysics due to its popularization by the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] and notable [[Science education|educators]] such as prominent professors [[Lawrence Krauss]], [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Hubert Reeves]], [[Carl Sagan]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] and [[Patrick Moore]]. The efforts of the early, late, and present scientists continue to attract young people to study the history and science of astrophysics.<ref>{{Cite web |author=D.

In practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] and observational physics. Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties of [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], [[black holes]], and other [[celestial bodies]]; and the [[Cosmogony|origin]] and [[ultimate fate of the universe]].<ref name="nasa.gov"/> Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|Solar System formation and evolution]]; [[stellar dynamics]] and [[Stellar evolution|evolution]]; [[galaxy formation and evolution]]; [[magnetohydrodynamics]]; [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] of [[matter]] in the universe; origin of [[cosmic ray]]s; [[general relativity]], [[special relativity]], [[quantum cosmology|quantum]] and [[physical cosmology]], including [[string theory|string]] cosmology and [[astroparticle physics]].

==History==
[[Image:NIEdot362.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Early 1900s comparison of elemental, solar, and stellar spectra]]
Astronomy is an ancient science, long separated from the study of terrestrial physics. In the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] worldview, bodies in the sky appeared to be unchanging [[Celestial spheres|spheres]] whose only motion was uniform motion in a circle, while the earthly world was the realm which underwent [[On Generation and Corruption|growth and decay]] and in which natural motion was in a straight line and ended when the moving object reached its destination.  Consequently, it was held that the celestial region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found in the terrestrial sphere; either [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] as maintained by [[Plato]], or [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]] as maintained by [[Aristotle#Physics|Aristotle]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Lloyd | first = G.

For much of the nineteenth century, astronomical research was focused on the routine work of measuring the positions and computing the motions of astronomical objects.<ref>{{Citation | last = Case | first = Stephen | date = 2015 | title = 'Land-marks of the universe': John Herschel against the background of positional astronomy | journal = Annals of Science | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 417–434 | doi = 10.1080/00033790.2015.1034588 | pmid = 26221834 | quote = The great majority of astronomers working in the early nineteenth century were not interested in stars as physical objects.

Among those who extended the study of solar and stellar spectra was [[Norman Lockyer]], who in 1868 detected radiant, as well as dark, lines in solar spectra. Working with chemist [[Edward Frankland]] to investigate the spectra of elements at various temperatures and pressures, he could not associate a yellow line in the solar spectrum with any known elements.  He thus claimed the line represented a new element, which was called [[helium]], after the Greek [[Helios]], the Sun personified.<ref>{{citation | last = Cortie | first = A.

In 1885, [[Edward C. Pickering]] undertook an ambitious program of stellar spectral classification at [[Harvard College Observatory]], in which a team of [[Harvard Computers|woman computers]], notably [[Williamina Fleming]], [[Antonia Maury]], and [[Annie Jump Cannon]], classified the spectra recorded on photographic plates. By 1890, a catalog of over 10,000 stars had been prepared that grouped them into thirteen spectral types. Following Pickering's vision, by 1924 Cannon expanded the [[Henry Draper Catalogue|catalog]] to nine volumes and over a quarter of a million stars, developing the [[Stellar classification#Harvard spectral classification|Harvard Classification Scheme]] which was accepted for worldwide use in 1922.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Hetherington |first1=Norriss S. |last2=McCray |first2=W.

Around 1920, following the discovery of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] still used as the basis for classifying stars and their evolution, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of [[nuclear fusion]] processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.<ref name=eddington>

This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fusion|last1=McCracken|editor-last2=Stott|editor-first2=Peter|editor-last=McCracken|editor-first=Garry|last2=Stott|first2=Peter|first1=Garry|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123846563000027|language=en|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-384656-3.00002-7|pages=13|isbn=978-0-12-384656-3|location=Boston|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Academic Press|quote=Eddington had realized that there would be a mass loss if four hydrogen atoms combined to form a single helium atom.

In 1925 Cecilia Helena Payne (later [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]]) wrote an influential doctoral dissertation at [[Radcliffe College]], in which she applied ionization theory to stellar atmospheres to relate the spectral classes to the temperature of stars.<ref>{{citation  |last=Payne |first=C.

Despite Eddington's suggestion, this discovery was so unexpected that her dissertation readers convinced her to modify the conclusion before publication.

By the end of the 20th century, studies of astronomical spectra had expanded to cover wavelengths extending from radio waves through optical, x-ray, and gamma wavelengths.<ref>{{cite conference |mode=cs2 |last1=Biermann |first1=Peter L. |last2=Falcke |first2=Heino |author2-link=Heino Falcke |editor-last=Panvini |editor-first=Robert S. |editor2-last=Weiler |editor2-first=Thomas J. |date=1998 |book-title=Fundamental particles and interactions: Frontiers in contemporary physics an international lecture and workshop series.

==Observational astrophysics==
[[Image:N 63A- Chandra and Hubble - Heic0507f.tif|thumb|right|200px|Supernova remnant LMC N 63A imaged in x-ray (blue), optical (green) and radio (red) wavelengths. The X-ray glow is from material heated to about ten million degrees Celsius by a shock wave generated by the supernova explosion.]]
[[Observational astronomy]] is a division of the astronomical science that is concerned with recording and interpreting data, in contrast with [[theoretical astrophysics]], which is mainly concerned with finding out the measurable implications of physical [[model (abstract)|models]]. It is the practice of observing [[celestial object]]s by using [[telescope]]s and other astronomical apparatus.

The majority of astrophysical observations are made using the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].
* [[Radio astronomy]] studies radiation with a [[wavelength]] greater than a few millimeters. Example areas of study are [[radio waves]], usually emitted by cold objects such as [[interstellar gas]] and dust clouds;  the cosmic microwave background radiation which is the [[redshift]]ed light from the [[Big Bang]]; [[pulsar]]s, which were first detected at [[microwave]] frequencies. The study of these waves requires very large [[radio telescope]]s.
* [[Infrared astronomy]] studies radiation with a wavelength that is too long to be visible to the naked eye but is shorter than radio waves. Infrared observations are usually made with telescopes similar to the familiar [[optical]] telescopes. Objects colder than stars (such as planets) are normally studied at infrared frequencies.
* [[Optical astronomy]] was the earliest kind of astronomy. Telescopes paired with a [[charge-coupled device]] or [[spectroscope]]s are the most common instruments used. The Earth's [[atmosphere]] interferes somewhat with optical observations, so [[adaptive optics]] and [[space telescope]]s are used to obtain the highest possible image quality. In this wavelength range, stars are highly visible, and many chemical spectra can be observed to study the chemical composition of stars, galaxies and [[nebula]]e.
* [[Ultraviolet]], [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] and [[gamma ray astronomy]] study very energetic processes such as [[binary pulsar]]s, [[black hole]]s, [[magnetar]]s, and many others. These kinds of radiation do not penetrate the Earth's atmosphere well. There are two methods in use to observe this part of the electromagnetic spectrum—[[space-based telescope]]s and ground-based [[imaging air Cherenkov telescope]]s (IACT). Examples of [[Observatory|Observatories]] of the first type are [[RXTE]], the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] and the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]]. Examples of IACTs are the [[High Energy Stereoscopic System]] (H.E.S.S.) and the [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]] telescope.
Other than electromagnetic radiation, few things may be observed from the Earth that originate from great distances. A few [[gravitational wave]] observatories have been constructed, but gravitational waves are extremely difficult to detect. [[Neutrino]] observatories have also been built, primarily to study our Sun. Cosmic rays consisting of very high energy particles can be observed hitting the Earth's atmosphere.

Observations can also vary in their time scale. Most optical observations take minutes to hours, so phenomena that change faster than this cannot readily be observed. However, historical data on some objects is available, spanning [[century|centuries]] or [[millennia]]. On the other hand, radio observations may look at events on a millisecond timescale ([[millisecond pulsar]]s) or combine years of data ([[Rotation-powered pulsar|pulsar deceleration]] studies). The information obtained from these different timescales is very different.

The study of our very own Sun has a special place in observational astrophysics. Due to the tremendous distance of all other stars, the Sun can be observed in a kind of detail unparalleled by any other star. Our understanding of our own Sun serves as a guide to our understanding of other stars.

The topic of how stars change, or stellar evolution, is often modeled by placing the varieties of star types in their respective positions on the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]], which can be viewed as representing the state of a stellar object, from birth to destruction.

==Theoretical astrophysics==
{{see also|Theoretical astronomy}}
Theoretical astrophysicists use a wide variety of tools which include [[mathematical model|analytical models]] (for example, [[polytrope]]s to approximate the behaviors of a star) and [[computation]]al [[Numerical analysis|numerical simulations]]. Each has some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.<ref>{{Citation |first=H. |last=Roth |title=A Slowly Contracting or Expanding Fluid Sphere and its Stability |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=525–529 |year=1932 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.39.525 |bibcode = 1932PhRv...39..525R }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |first=A.S. |last=Eddington |title=Internal Constitution of the Stars |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1926 |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-521-33708-3 |pmid=17747682 }}</ref>

Theorists in astrophysics endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This helps allow observers to look for data that can refute a model or help in choosing between several alternate or conflicting models.

Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model to fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.

Topics studied by theoretical astrophysicists include stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including [[string theory|string]] cosmology and astroparticle physics. Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for [[black hole]] (''astro'')physics and the study of [[gravitational waves]].

Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astrophysics, now included in the [[Lambda-CDM model]], are the [[Big Bang]], [[cosmic inflation]], dark matter, dark energy and fundamental theories of physics.

== Popularization ==
The roots of astrophysics can be found in the seventeenth century emergence of a unified physics, in which the same laws applied to the celestial and terrestrial realms.<ref name = Burtt>{{Citation | last = Burtt | first = Edwin Arthur | author-link = Edwin Arthur Burtt | publication-date = 2003 | orig-year = First published 1924 | title = The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science | edition = second revised | publisher = Dover Publications | location = Mineola, NY | pages = 30, 41, 241–2 | isbn = 978-0-486-42551-1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=G9WBMa1Rz_kC | year = 2003 }}</ref>  There were scientists who were qualified in both physics and astronomy who laid the firm foundation for the current science of astrophysics.  In modern times, students continue to be drawn to astrophysics due to its popularization by the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] and notable [[Science education|educators]] such as prominent professors [[Lawrence Krauss]], [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Hubert Reeves]], [[Carl Sagan]], [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] and [[Patrick Moore]].
