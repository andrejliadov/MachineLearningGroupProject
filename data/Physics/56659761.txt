The '''Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers''' ('''CESRA''') is a non-profit informal organization of European scientists whose aims are to promote studies of solar radio physics and related topics.

Established in 1970,<ref name="About CESRA">{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/eduard/cesra/?page_id=181 |title=About CESRA – Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers. |publisher=Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers |access-date=February 20, 2017}}</ref> its membership includes scientists from 28 European research institutes.<ref name="Solar/Radio Institutes">{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/eduard/cesra/?page_id=181 |title=Solar/Radio Institutes – Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers. |publisher=Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers |access-date=February 20, 2017}}</ref>

==History==

[[Arnold O. Benz]] reports<ref name="About CESRA"/> that CESRA was initiated by a letter written in June 1970 by A.D. Fokker (Utrecht) with which he invited “many” solar radio astronomers to a meeting at the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) General Assembly in Brighton (August 18–27, 1970) (the letter was found by [[Arnold O. Benz]]. CESRA's initial purpose was to promote the development of a European instrument for solar radio observations, the Joint Interferometer Project (JIP). The organization's “statement of intentions and policy” was adopted at the 1972 meeting in Bordeaux. Initially the “CESRA” acronym meant “Committee of European Solar Radio Astronomers” and  members were the representatives from each observatory.  In that phase CESRA was chaired by A.D. Fokker. 
When JIP became unrealistic in 1978, it was decided not to dissolve the organization, but give it to a “caretaker” to do whatever needed.<ref name="About CESRA"/> The caretaker was [[Arnold O. Benz]] until 1992. In 1992 at a meeting with [[Arnold O. Benz]], M. Pick, G. Trottet, A. Magun and P. Zlobec, decided to transform CESRA to a more organized entity with a President, a Board and Statutes, changed “Committee” to “Community” and gave CESRA a democratic structure with statutes similar to today’s.
Since 1992 the following scientists have served as CESRA presidents:<ref name="CESRA Board">{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/eduard/cesra/?page_id=194 |title=CESRA Board – Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers. |publisher=Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers |access-date=February 20, 2017}}</ref> [[Arnold O. Benz]] ([[Zurich]]; 1992-1998), Karl-Ludwig Klein ([[Meudon]]; 1998-2010), Silja Pohjolainen ([[Turku]]; 2010-2016), and Eduard Kontar ([[Glasgow]]; 2016-...).

==Conferences==
CESRA organizes triennial workshops<ref name="Workshops/Meetings">{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/eduard/cesra/?page_id=71 |title=Workshops/Meetings – Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers. |publisher=Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers |access-date=February 20, 2017}}</ref> on investigations of the solar atmosphere using radio and other observations. Although special emphasis is given to radio diagnostics, the workshop topics are of interest to a large community of solar physicists. The format of the workshops usually combine plenary sessions and working group sessions, with invited review talks, oral contributions, and posters. The workshops attract not only European scientists, but also scientists from the USA, China, Japan, Australia, and Brazil. 
CESRA has also cosponsored international solar physics conferences organized by the [[European Physical Society]]<ref name="Workshops/Meetings"/><ref name="14th ESP Meeting">{{cite web |url=http://www.espm14.ie |title=14th European Solar Physics Meeting, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, 8-12 September 2014.  |publisher=European Solar Physics Meeting |access-date=February 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name="11th ESP Meeting">{{cite web |url=https://wis.kuleuven.be/cpa/spm11.php |title=11th European Solar Physics Meeting, Leuven, Belgium, 11-16 September 2011. |publisher=European Solar Physics Meeting |access-date=February 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211164842/http://wis.kuleuven.be/cpa/spm11.php |archive-date=11 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and in one occasion has organized a session within the [[European Geophysical Society]]'s General Assembly.<ref name="Workshops/Meetings"/>

==Summer Schools==
Two summer schools<ref name="summer school 2010">{{cite web |url=http://www.lesia.obspm.fr/cesra/summer2010/ |title=CESRA summer school on solar radio physics 2010.  |publisher=Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers |access-date=February 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name="summer school 2015">{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/?page_id=3673 |title=Glasgow CESRA Radio Summer School 2015.   |publisher=Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers |access-date=February 20, 2017}}</ref> have been organized by CESRA. The schools were open to solar radio physicists including PhD students and early career researchers. They covered the essential elements of theory, modeling and data analysis and featured lectures and tutorials.  Students had the opportunity to meet and discuss research topics with their peers together in an informal atmosphere.

==Publications==
Proceedings of CESRA workshops include review articles as well as original research articles and are usually published in [[Solar Physics (journal)]]'s Topical Issues.<ref name="Workshops/Meetings"/><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/journal/11207/253/1/page/1|title=Radio Physics and the Flare-CME Relationship|first=Karl-Ludwig|last=Klein|first2=Silja|last2=Pohjolainen|journal=[[Solar Physics]]|volume=253|issue=1–2|issn=1573-093X |date=December 1, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Solar Physics, Volume 273, Issue 2, November 2011">{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/journal/11207/273/2/page/1|title=Energy Storage and Release through the Solar Activity Cycle – Models Meet Radio Observations. |first=Christophe |last=Marque´ |first2=Alexander|last2=Nindos|journal=[[Solar Physics]]|volume=273|issue=2|issn=1573-093X |date=November 1, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Solar Physics, Volume 290, Issue 1, January 2015." >{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/journal/11207/290/1/page/1|title=New eyes looking at solar activity: Challenges for theory and simulations.  |first=Silja|last=Pohjolainen|first2=Marian|last2=Karlicky´|journal=[[Solar Physics]]|volume=290|issue=1|issn=1573-093X |date=January 1, 2015}}</ref> The proceedings of some CESRA workshops (until 2004) have been published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Physics.

==Solar radio science highlights==

CESRA web page hosts “Solar radio science highlights”.<ref name="Solar Radio Science Highlights ">{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/eduard/cesra/?cat=1 |title=Solar Radio Science Highlights – Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers.   |publisher=Community of European Solar Radio Astronomers |access-date=February 20, 2017}}</ref>  These are short communications written by CESRA members that publicize fresh research (normally based on a refereed paper published within three months) to keep CESRA community informed and up-to-date. They are written in a language accessible to  non-experts, using a “news-and-views” style.
