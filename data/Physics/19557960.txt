The '''Department of Physics''' in Lund is a department that belongs to both the Faculty of Natural Sciences and the [[Faculty of Engineering (LTH), Lund University|Faculty of Engineering]] at [[Lund University]]. The main goals are to expand the understanding of physics, its applications and to share scientific progress to new generations. Research is conducted in most of the [[physics]] subdivisions. The department also offers courses and a [[Master's degree|Masters's degree programs]] in pure physics and provides physics education for the [[Master of Science in Engineering|Master of Science in Engineering programs]].

== History ==
In 1666 [[Lund University]] was founded without a faculty of science, so the physics research was conducted under the faculty of philosophy. In addition, during its first 150 years the University had no [[professor]]ship in pure physics, so the teachings was instead given by professors in [[mathematics]]. There were however a course in [[experimental physics]] from the early 18th century, but that course was given by a professor in theoretical medicine; [[Kilian Stobæus]] was appointed as the first professor in 1728.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=Ulf|publisher=Lunds universitetshistoriska sällskap|year=2015|isbn=9789175453200|location=Lund|pages=13–19|language=sv}}</ref> It wasn't until the early 19th century that the physics professorship split from the mathematics, but then the professorship was shared with the [[astronomy]]. The University received its first full professor in physics in 1839.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|year=2015|pages=48|language=sv}}</ref>

Although a pure department of [[science]] was not established until the late 19th century, the seeds for the department was established in 1735 when the physics teaching received its own space in the building Kungshuset.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|year=2015|pages=31–32|language=sv}}</ref> The teaching was held inside Kungshuset until the late 19th century, when the department moved to its own building which had instrumental halls, auditoriums, workshops and a library.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|year=2015|pages=61–62|language=sv}}</ref> The department moved again in 1950 to a large building complex named ''Fysicum'' due to increased space requirements, and it has been there since then.

== Research ==
At the Department of Physics advanced research takes place divided in different divisions. The research areas are: [[Atomic Physics]], [[Combustion|Combustion Physics]], [[Mathematical Physics]], [[Nuclear Physics]], [[Particle Physics]], [[Solid State Physics]] and [[Synchrotron Radiation|Synchrotron Radiation Research]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fysik.lu.se/english/contact/ |title=Contact |work=Department of Physics |access-date=5 Aug 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fysik.lu.se/english/research/research-divisions/ |title=Research divisions |work=Department of Physics |access-date=5 Aug 2015}}</ref>

The department also hosts the Lund Nano Lab (LNL), part of NanoLund (formerly known as the Nanometer Structure Consortium), an interdisciplinary research environment for nanoscience and its applications in electronics, the life sciences etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nano.lu.se/ |title=NanoLund |work=Lund University |access-date=10 Sep 2015}}</ref> Further research centers are ''Lund Laser Centre (LLC)'', ''Consortium for Aerosol Science and Technology (CAST)'' and ''Lund University Combustion Centre (LUCC)''.
