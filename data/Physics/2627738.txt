'''[[Optics]]''' began with the development of [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians and [[Mesopotamia]]ns, followed by theories on light and [[Visual perception|vision]] developed by [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]], and the development of [[geometrical optics]] in the [[Greco-Roman world]]. The word ''[[optics]]'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term {{lang|grc|τα ὀπτικά}} meaning "appearance, look".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology|year=1996|author=T. F.

These earlier studies on optics are now known as "classical optics". The term "modern optics" refers to areas of optical research that largely developed in the 20th century, such as [[Physical optics|wave optics]] and [[quantum optics]].

==Early history==

In [[Science and technology in ancient India|ancient India]], the philosophical schools of [[Samkhya]] and [[Vaisheshika]], from around the 6th&ndash;5th century BC, developed theories on light. According to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five fundamental "subtle" elements (''tanmatra'') out of which emerge the gross elements.

In contrast, the Vaisheshika school gives an [[atomic theory]] of the physical world on the non-atomic ground of [[Aether (classical element)|ether]], space and time. (See ''[[Atomism#Indian atomism|Indian atomism]]''.) The basic [[atom]]s are those of earth (''prthivı''), water (''apas''), fire (''tejas''), and air (''vayu''), that should not be confused with the ordinary meaning of these terms. These atoms are taken to form binary molecules that combine further to form larger molecules. Motion is defined in terms of the movement of the physical atoms. Light rays are taken to be a stream of high velocity of ''tejas'' (fire) atoms. The particles of light can exhibit different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements of the ''tejas'' atoms. Around the first century BC, the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' refers to sunlight as "the seven rays of the sun".

In the fifth century BC, [[Empedocles]] postulated that everything was composed of [[Classical element|four elements]]; fire, air, earth and water. He believed that [[Aphrodite]] made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun. He stated that light has a finite speed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sarton |first=G |year=1993 |title=Ancient science through the golden age of Greece |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcoGIKlHuZcC&pg=PA248 |page=248 |publisher=[[Courier Dover]] |isbn=978-0-486-27495-9

In his ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Euclid]] observed that "things seen under a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle less, while those under equal angles appear equal". In the 36 propositions that follow, Euclid relates the apparent size of an object to its distance from the eye and investigates the apparent shapes of cylinders and cones when viewed from different angles. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] believed these results to be important in astronomy and included Euclid's ''Optics'', along with his ''Phaenomena'', in the ''Little Astronomy'', a compendium of smaller works to be studied before the ''Syntaxis'' (''Almagest'') of [[Ptolemy]].

In 55 BC, [[Lucretius]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[atomism|atomists]], wrote:

{{Quote| 
|text=For from whatsoever distances fires can throw us their light and breathe their warm heat upon our limbs, they lose nothing of the body of their flames because of the interspaces, their fire is no whit shrunken to the sight.<ref>Lucretius, 1910. On the nature of things, Bok V ll 561-591, translated by Cyril Bailey, Oxford University press.</ref>}}

In his ''Catoptrica'', [[Hero of Alexandria]] showed by a geometrical method that the actual path taken by a ray of light reflected from a plane mirror is shorter than any other reflected path that might be drawn between the source and point of observation.

In the second century [[Claudius Ptolemy]],  in his ''[[Optics (Ptolemy)|Optics]]'' undertook studies of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]].  He measured the angles of refraction between air, water, and glass, and his published results indicate that he adjusted his measurements to fit his (incorrect) assumption that the [[angle of refraction]] is proportional to the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Lloyd | first = G.E.R. | author-link = G.

The Indian [[Buddhist]]s, such as [[Dignāga]] in the 5th century and [[Dharmakirti]] in the 7th century, developed a type of [[atomism]] that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy, similar to the modern concept of [[photon]]s, though they also viewed all matter as being composed of these light/energy particles.

===Geometrical optics===
{{See also|Geometrical optics|Ray (optics)}}

The early writers discussed here treated vision more as a geometrical than as a physical, physiological, or psychological problem. The first known author of a treatise on geometrical optics was the geometer [[Euclid]] (c. 325 BC–265 BC). Euclid began his study of optics as he began his study of geometry, with a set of self-evident axioms.

# Lines (or visual rays) can be drawn in a straight line to the object.
# Those lines falling upon an object form a cone.
# Those things upon which the lines fall are seen.
# Those things seen under a larger angle appear larger.
# Those things seen by a higher ray, appear higher.
# Right and left rays appear right and left.
# Things seen within several angles appear clearer.

Euclid did not define the physical nature of these visual rays but, using the principles of geometry, he discussed the effects of perspective and the rounding of things seen at a distance.

Where Euclid had limited his analysis to simple direct vision, [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. AD 10–70) extended the principles of geometrical optics to consider problems of reflection (catoptrics).  Unlike Euclid, Hero occasionally commented on the physical nature of visual rays, indicating that they proceeded at great speed from the eye to the object seen and were reflected from smooth surfaces but could become trapped in the porosities of unpolished surfaces.<ref>[[D. C. Lindberg]], ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 14-15.</ref> This has come to be known as [[Emission theory (vision)|''emission theory'']].<ref name="guarnieri 7-1">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2015|title=Two Millennia of Light: The Long Path to Maxwell's Waves|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=9|issue=2|pages=54–56+60|doi=10.1109/MIE.2015.2421754|s2cid=20759821}}</ref>

Hero demonstrated the equality of the angle of incidence and reflection on the grounds that this is the shortest path from the object to the observer.  On this basis, he was able to define the fixed relation between an object and its image in a plane mirror.  Specifically, the image appears to be as far behind the mirror as the object really is in front of the mirror.

Like Hero, [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Optics (Ptolemy)|Optics]]'' (preserved only in the form of a Latin translation of a gravely defective Arabic version) considered the visual rays as proceeding from the eye to the object seen, but, unlike Hero, considered that the visual rays were not discrete lines, but formed a continuous cone.  Ptolemy extended the study of vision beyond direct and reflected vision; he also studied vision by refracted rays (dioptrics), when we see objects through the interface between two media of different density.  He conducted experiments to measure the path of vision when we look from air to water, from air to glass, and from water to glass and tabulated the relationship between the incident and refracted rays.<ref>D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), p. 16; A. M. Smith, Ptolemy's search for a law of refraction: a case-study in the classical methodology of 'saving the appearances' and its limitations, ''Arch. Hist. Exact Sci''. 26 (1982), 221-240; Ptolemy's procedure is reported in the fifth chapter of his ''Optics''.</ref>

His tabulated results have been studied for the air water interface, and in general the values he obtained reflect the theoretical refraction given by modern theory, but the outliers are distorted to represent Ptolemy's ''a priori'' model of the nature of refraction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==In the Islamic world==
[[File:Ibn Sahl manuscript.jpg|thumbnail|Reproduction of a page of [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]]'s manuscript showing his discovery of the law of refraction, now known as [[Snell's law]].]]

[[Al-Kindi]] (c. 801–873) was one of the earliest important optical writers in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].  In a work known in the west as ''De radiis stellarum'', al-Kindi developed a theory "that everything in the world ... emits rays in every direction, which fill the whole world."<ref>Cited in D. C.

[[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]], a mathematician active in Baghdad during the 980s, is the first Islamic scholar known to have compiled a commentary on [[Optics (Ptolemy)|Ptolemy's ''Optics'']]. His treatise  ''Fī al-'āla al-muḥriqa'' "On the burning instruments" was reconstructed from fragmentary manuscripts by Rashed (1993).<ref>Rashed, R., ''Géométrie et dioptrique au Xe siècle: Ibn Sahl, al-Quhi et Ibn al-Haytham.'' Paris: Les Belles Lettres, 1993
</ref> The work is concerned with how [[curved mirror]]s and [[lens (optics)|lens]]es bend and focus light. Ibn Sahl also describes a law of [[refraction]] mathematically equivalent to [[Snell's law]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rashed | first1 = R. | year = 1990 | title = A Pioneer in Anaclastics: Ibn Sahl on Burning Mirrors and Lenses | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | pages = 464–91 | doi=10.1086/355456| s2cid = 144361526 }}</ref> He used his law of refraction to compute the shapes of lenses and mirrors that focus light at a single point on the axis.

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in as ''Alhacen'' or ''Alhazen'' in Western Europe), writing in the 1010s, received both Ibn Sahl's treatise and a partial Arabic translation of Ptolemy's ''Optics''. He produced a comprehensive and systematic analysis of Greek optical theories.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lindberg | first1 = D.

Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only.... We have explained this exhaustively in our ''[[Book of Optics]]''. But let us now mention something to prove this convincingly: the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes.... [T]he entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air." – Alhazen, ''Treatise on Light'' (رسالة في الضوء), translated into English from German by M.

He then analyzed these physical rays according to the principles of geometrical optics.  He wrote many books on optics, most significantly the ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (''Kitab al Manazir'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]), translated into [[Latin]] as the ''De aspectibus'' or ''Perspectiva'', which disseminated his ideas to Western Europe and had great influence on the later developments of optics.<ref>D.

[[Avicenna]] (980-1037) agreed with Alhazen that the [[speed of light]] is finite, as he "observed that if the perception of light is due to the emission of some sort of particles by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite."<ref>[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science'', Vol. 1, p. 710.</ref> [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] (973-1048) also agreed that light has a finite speed, and stated that the speed of light is much faster than the [[speed of sound]].<ref name=Biruni>{{MacTutor|id=Al-Biruni|title=Al-Biruni}}</ref>

[[Ibn Muʿādh al-Jayyānī|Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ma'udh]], who lived in [[Al-Andalus]] during the second half of the 11th century, wrote a work on optics later translated into Latin as ''Liber de crepisculis'', which was mistakenly attributed to [[Alhazen]]. This was a "short work containing an estimation of the angle of depression of the sun at the beginning of the morning [[twilight]] and at the end of the evening twilight, and an attempt to calculate on the basis of this and other data the height of the atmospheric moisture responsible for the refraction of the sun's rays." Through his experiments, he obtained the value of 18°, which comes close to the modern value.<ref>{{citation|title=The Authorship of the Liber de crepusculis, an Eleventh-Century Work on Atmospheric Refraction|first=A.

In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]] (1236–1311) and his student [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī]] (1260–1320) continued the work of Ibn al-Haytham, and they were among the first to give the correct explanations for the [[rainbow]] phenomenon.

==In medieval Europe==

The English bishop, [[Robert Grosseteste]] (c. 1175–1253), wrote on a wide range of scientific topics at the time of the origin of the medieval [[university]] and the recovery of the works of Aristotle.  Grosseteste reflected a period of transition between the Platonism of early medieval learning and the new [[Aristotelianism]], hence he tended to apply mathematics and the Platonic metaphor of light in many of his writings.  He has been credited with discussing light from four different perspectives: an [[epistemology]] of light, a [[metaphysics]] or [[cosmogony]] of light, an [[etiology]] or [[physics]] of light, and a [[theology]] of light.<ref>D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 94-99.</ref>

Setting aside the issues of epistemology and theology, Grosseteste's cosmogony of light describes the origin of the universe in what may loosely be described as a medieval "big bang" theory.  Both his biblical commentary, the ''Hexaemeron'' (1230 x 35), and his scientific ''On Light'' (1235 x 40), took their inspiration from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:3, "God said, let there be light", and described the subsequent process of creation as a natural physical process arising from the generative power of an expanding (and contracting) sphere of light.<ref>R. W. Southern, ''Robert Grosseteste: The Growth of an English Mind in Medieval Europe'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), pp. 136-9, 205-6.</ref>

[[File:Optics from Roger Bacon's De multiplicatone specierum.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Optical diagram showing light being refracted by a spherical glass container full of water. (from Roger Bacon, ''De multiplicatione specierum'')]]

His more general consideration of light as a primary agent of physical causation appears in his ''On Lines, Angles, and Figures'' where he asserts that "a natural agent propagates its power from itself to the recipient" and in ''On the Nature of Places'' where he notes that "every natural action is varied in strength and weakness through variation of lines, angles and figures."<ref>A. C. Crombie, ''Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental Science'', (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1971), p. 110</ref>

The English [[Franciscan]], [[Roger Bacon]] (c. 1214–1294) was strongly influenced by Grosseteste's writings on the importance of light.  In his optical writings (the ''Perspectiva'', the ''De multiplicatione specierum'', and the ''De speculis comburentibus'') he cited a wide range of recently translated optical and philosophical works, including those of [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhacen]], [[Aristotle]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes]], [[Euclid]], [[al-Kindi]], [[Ptolemy]], Tideus, and [[Constantine the African]].  Although he was not a slavish imitator, he drew his mathematical analysis of light and vision from the writings of the Arabic writer, Alhacen.  But he added to this the Neoplatonic concept, perhaps drawn from Grosseteste, that every object radiates a power (''species'') by which it acts upon nearby objects suited to receive those ''species''.<ref>D. C. Lindberg, "Roger Bacon on Light, Vision, and the Universal Emanation of Force", pp. 243-275 in Jeremiah Hackett, ed., ''Roger Bacon and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays'', (Leiden: Brill, 1997), pp. 245-250; ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 107-18; ''The Beginnings of Western Science'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1992, p. 313.</ref>  Note that Bacon's optical use of the term "''species''" differs significantly from the [[Species#Historical development of the species concept|genus / species]] categories found in Aristotelian philosophy.

Several later works, including the influential ''A Moral Treatise on the Eye'' (Latin: ''Tractatus Moralis de Oculo'') by [[Peter of Limoges]] (1240–1306), helped popularize and spread the ideas found in Bacon's writings.<ref>{{cite book|title=Seeing and Being Seen in the Later Medieval World: Optics, Theology and Religious Life|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|author=Dallas G. Denery II|pages=75–80|isbn=9781139443814}}</ref>

Another English Franciscan, [[John Pecham]] (died 1292) built on the work of Bacon, Grosseteste, and a diverse range of earlier writers to produce what became the most widely used textbook on Optics of the Middle Ages, the ''Perspectiva communis''.  His book centered on the question of vision, on how we see, rather than on the nature of light and color.  Pecham followed the model set forth by Alhacen, but interpreted Alhacen's ideas in the manner of Roger Bacon.<ref>D. C. Lindberg, ''John Pecham and the Science of Optics:'' Perspectiva communis, (Madison, Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1970), pp. 12-32; ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 116-18.</ref>

Like his predecessors, [[Witelo]] (born circa 1230, died between 1280 and 1314) drew on the extensive body of optical works recently translated from Greek and Arabic to produce a massive presentation of the subject entitled the ''Perspectiva''.  His theory of vision follows Alhacen and he does not consider Bacon's concept of ''species'', although passages in his work demonstrate that he was influenced by Bacon's ideas.  Judging from the number of surviving manuscripts, his work was not as influential as those of Pecham and Bacon, yet his importance, and that of Pecham, grew with the invention of printing.<ref>D. C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 118-20.</ref>

[[Theodoric of Freiberg]] (ca. 1250–ca. 1310) was among the first in Europe to provide the correct scientific explanation for the [[rainbow]] phenomenon,{{cn|date=November 2020}} as well as Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi (1236–1311) and his student Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī (1260–1320) mentioned above.

==Renaissance and Early Modern==

[[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630) picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600.<ref name="guarnieri 7-1"/> Both lunar and [[solar eclipse]]s presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of [[atmospheric refraction]] applied to all astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on January 1, 1604, was published as ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' (''The Optical Part of Astronomy''). In it, Kepler described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of [[pinhole camera]]s, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as [[parallax]] and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies.  ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the [[law of refraction]] is conspicuously absent).<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp 142–146</ref>

[[Willebrord Snellius]] (1580–1626) found the mathematical law of [[refraction]], now known as [[Snell's law]], in 1621. Subsequently, [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) showed, by using geometric construction and the law of refraction (also known as Descartes' law), that the angular radius of a rainbow is 42° (i.e. the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the rainbow's centre is 42°).<ref>{{Citation|last=Tipler|first=P.

[[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629–1695) wrote several works in the area of optics. These included the ''Opera reliqua'' (also known as ''Christiani Hugenii Zuilichemii, dum viveret Zelhemii toparchae, opuscula posthuma'') and the ''[[Traité de la lumière]]''.

[[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) investigated the [[refraction]] of light, demonstrating that a [[Triangular prism (optics)|prism]] could decompose white light into a [[visible spectrum|spectrum]] of colours, and that a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as [[Isaac Newton's early life and achievements#Newton's theory of colour|Newton's theory of colour]]. From this work he concluded that any refracting [[telescope]] would suffer from the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a [[Newtonian telescope]]) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using [[Newton's rings]] to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes ''On Colour'', which he later expanded into his ''Opticks''. Newton argued that light is composed of particles or ''corpuscles'' and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with [[wave]]s to explain the [[diffraction]] of light (''Opticks'' Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's [[quantum mechanics]], [[photons]] and the idea of [[wave-particle duality]] bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.

In his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675, Newton [[wikt:posit|posited]] the existence of the [[luminiferous aether|ether]] to transmit forces between particles. In 1704, Newton published ''[[Opticks]]'', in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation "Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?"<ref>{{Citation |last=Dobbs |first=J.T. |date=December 1982 |title=Newton's Alchemy and His Theory of Matter |journal=Isis |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=523 |doi=10.1086/353114|s2cid=170669199 }} quoting ''Opticks''</ref>

The effects of [[diffraction]] of light were carefully observed and characterized by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]], who also coined the term ''diffraction'', from the Latin ''diffringere'', 'to break into pieces', referring to light breaking up into different directions. The results of Grimaldi's observations were published posthumously in 1665.<ref>{{Citation | title = Memoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts | author = Jean Louis Aubert | publisher = Impr. de S.

[[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] (1638&ndash;1675) observed the diffraction patterns caused by a bird feather, which was effectively the first [[diffraction grating]]. In 1803 [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] did his famous experiment observing interference from two closely spaced slits in his [[Young's Double Slit Interferometer|double slit interferometer]]. Explaining his results by interference of the waves emanating from the two different slits, he deduced that light must propagate as waves. [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] did more definitive studies and calculations of diffraction, published in 1815 and 1818, and thereby gave great support to the wave theory of light that had been advanced by [[Christiaan Huygens]] and reinvigorated by Young, against Newton's particle theory.

The earliest known working telescopes were the [[refracting telescope]]s that appeared in the [[Netherlands]] in 1608. Their inventor is unknown: [[Hans Lippershey]] applied for the first patent that year followed by a patent application by [[Jacob Metius]] of [[Alkmaar]] two weeks later (neither was granted since examples of the device seemed to be numerous at the time). [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] greatly improved upon these designs the following year. [[Isaac Newton]] is credited with constructing the first functional [[reflecting telescope]] in 1668,  his [[Newtonian telescope|Newtonian reflector]].

== Quantum optics ==
{{Main|Quantum optics}}

Light is made up of particles called [[photons]] and hence inherently is quantized.  Quantum optics is the study of the nature and effects of light as quantized photons. The first indication that light might be quantized came from [[Max Planck]] in 1899 when he correctly modelled [[blackbody radiation]] by assuming that the exchange of energy between light and matter only occurred in discrete amounts he called quanta. It was unknown whether the source of this discreteness was the matter or the light.<ref name="Cropper2004">{{cite book|author=William H. Cropper|title=Great Physicists: The Life and Times of Leading Physicists from Galileo to Hawking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UqbxZpELwHYC|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517324-6}}</ref>{{rp|231–236}} In 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] published the theory of the [[photoelectric effect]]. It appeared that the only possible explanation for the effect was the quantization of light itself. Later, [[Niels Bohr]] showed that atoms could only emit discrete amounts of energy. The understanding of the interaction between light and [[matter]] following from these developments not only formed the basis of quantum optics but also were crucial for the development of quantum mechanics as a whole. However, the subfields of quantum mechanics dealing with matter-light interaction were principally regarded as research into matter rather than into light and hence, one rather spoke of [[atom physics]] and [[quantum electronics]].

This changed with the invention of the [[maser]] in 1953 and the [[laser]] in 1960. [[Laser science]]—research into principles, design and application of these devices—became an important field, and the quantum mechanics underlying the laser's principles was studied now with more emphasis on the properties of light, and the name ''quantum optics'' became customary.

As laser science needed good theoretical foundations, and also because research into these soon proved very fruitful, interest in quantum optics rose. Following the work of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] in [[quantum field theory]], [[George Sudarshan]], [[Roy J. Glauber]], and [[Leonard Mandel]] applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the [[statistical mechanics|statistics]] of light (see [[degree of coherence]]). This led to the introduction of the [[coherent state]] as a quantum description of laser light and the realization that some states of light could not be described with classical waves. In 1977, [[H. Jeff Kimble|Kimble]] et al. demonstrated the first source of light which required a quantum description: a single atom that emitted one photon at a time.  Another quantum state of light with certain advantages over any classical state, [[Squeezed coherent state|squeezed light]], was soon proposed. At the same time, development of short and [[ultrashort pulse|ultrashort]] laser pulses—created by [[Q-switching]] and [[mode-locking]] techniques—opened the way to the study of unimaginably fast ("[[ultrafast]]") processes. Applications for solid state research (e.g. [[Raman spectroscopy]]) were found, and mechanical forces of light on matter were studied. The latter led to levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological samples in an [[optical trap]] or [[optical tweezers]] by laser beam. This, along with [[Doppler cooling]] was the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated [[Bose–Einstein condensation]].

Other remarkable results are the [[Bell test experiments|demonstration of quantum entanglement]], [[quantum teleportation]], and (recently, in 1995) [[quantum logic gate]]s. The latter are of much interest in [[quantum information theory]], a subject which partly emerged from quantum optics, partly from theoretical [[computer science]].

Today's fields of interest among quantum optics researchers include [[parametric down-conversion]], [[Optical parametric oscillator|parametric oscillation]], even shorter (attosecond) light pulses, use of quantum optics for [[quantum information]], manipulation of single atoms and [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, their application, and how to manipulate them (a sub-field often called [[atom optics]]).
