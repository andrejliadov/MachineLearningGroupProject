'''Pseudophysics''' is a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] practice using the language of [[physics]] or discussing issues related to or pertinent to physics to promote ideas which are either incoherent or contradictory to known physics (experimental phenomenology). According to physicists, skeptics, and science writers, pseudophysics tends to be promoted by so-called "[[crank (person)|cranks]]",<ref>http://physics.about.com/b/2012/02/17/physicscranks.htm</ref> whose ideas lack [[Academic peer review|peer review]], lack [[falsifiability|falsifiable predictions]], and/or blatantly contradict scientific facts and experimental results. [[Mathematical physicist]] [[John C. Baez]] famously invented a [[crackpot index]] to give an idea of what sort of claims and rhetoric were commonplace among pseudophysics proposals he had come across.<ref>http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html</ref>
