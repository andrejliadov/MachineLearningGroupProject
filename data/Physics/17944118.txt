The [[natural sciences]] saw various advancements during the [[Golden Age of Islam]] (from roughly the mid 8th to the mid 13th centuries), adding a number of innovations to the [[Transmission of the Classics]] (such as [[Aristotle]], [[Ptolemy]], [[Euclid]], [[Neoplatonism]]).<ref name = "classical Arabic philosophy">''Classical Arabic Philosophy An Anthology of Sources'', Translated by Jon McGinnis and David C. Reisman. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2007. pg. xix</ref> 
During this period, Islamic theology was encouraging of thinkers to find knowledge.<ref>Bakar, Osman. ''The History and Philosophy of Islamic Science''.

These works and the important commentaries on them were the wellspring of science during the medieval period. They were [[Transmission of the Classics|translated]] into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of this period. 

[[Science in medieval Islam|Islamic scholarship in the sciences]] had inherited [[Aristotelian physics]] from the Greeks and during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] developed it further. However the Islamic world had a greater respect for knowledge gained from empirical observation, and believed that the universe is governed by a single set of laws. Their use of empirical observation led to the formation of crude forms of the [[scientific method]].<ref name = "Ahmad">{{cite web|first = Ahmad | last=I.A.|title=The Impact of the Qur’anic Conception of Astronomical Phenomena on Islamic Civilization| journal = Vistas in Astronomy| volume = 39 | issue = 4|year=1995|pages=395–403|url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/008366569500033X/1-s2.0-008366569500033X-main.pdf?_tid=537b8afe-c66f-11e3-a125-00000aab0f01&acdnat=1397766899_91c6f79c72ff2e5ce1b361c6acc4f1d9|bibcode=1995VA.....39..395A|doi=10.1016/0083-6656(95)00033-X}}</ref> The study of physics in the Islamic world started in [[Iraq]] and [[Egypt]].<ref name=Thiele>{{citation|first=Rüdiger|last=Thiele|title=In Memoriam: Matthias Schramm, 1928–2005|journal=Historia Mathematica|volume=32|issue=3|date=August 2005|pages=271–274|doi=10.1016/j.hm.2005.05.002}}</ref>

==Physics==
[[Science in medieval Islam|Islamic scholarship]] had inherited [[Aristotelian physics]] from the Greeks and during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] developed it further, especially placing emphasis on observation and ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]'' reasoning, developing early forms of the [[scientific method]]. With [[Aristotelian physics]], physics was seen as lower than demonstrative mathematical sciences, but in terms of a larger theory of knowledge, physics was higher than astronomy; many of whose principles derive from physics and metaphysics.<ref name = "Islam, Science, and the Challenge of History">. ''Islam, Science, and the Challenge of History''. New Haven:Yale University Press. pg 57</ref> The primary subject of physics, according to [[Aristotle]], was motion or change; there were three factors involved with this change, underlying thing, privation, and form. In his ''Metaphysics'', [[Aristotle]] believed that the ''Unmoved Mover'' was responsible for the movement of the cosmos, which [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] later generalized as the cosmos were eternal.<ref name = "classical Arabic philosophy"/> [[Al-Kindi]] argued against the idea of the cosmos being eternal by claiming that the eternality of the world lands one in a different sort of absurdity involving the infinite; [[Al-Kindi]] asserted that the cosmos must have a temporal origin because traversing an infinite was impossible.

One of the first commentaries of [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] ''Metaphysics'' is by [[Al-Farabi]]. In "'The Aims of [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] Metaphysics", [[Al-Farabi]] argues that metaphysics is not specific to natural beings, but at the same time, metaphysics is higher in universality than natural beings.<ref name = "classical Arabic philosophy"/>

==Optics==
[[File:Book of Optics Cover Page.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of [[Ibn al-Haytham]]'s ''Book of Optics'']]

One field in physics, [[optics]], developed rapidly in this period. By the ninth century, there were works on physiological optics as well as mirror reflections, and geometrical and physical optics.<ref name = "ahmad">Dallal, Ahmad. ''Islam, Science, and the Challenge of History''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010. pg. 38</ref> In the eleventh century, [[Ibn al-Haytham]] not only rejected the Greek idea about vision, he came up with a new theory.<ref>Dallal, Ahmad. ''Islam, Science, and the Challenge of History''. New Haven:Yale University Press. pg 39</ref> 

[[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]] (c. 940-1000), a mathematician and physicist connected with the court of [[Baghdad]], wrote a treatise ''On Burning Mirrors and Lenses'' in 984 in which he set out his understanding of how [[curved mirror]]s and [[Lens (optics)|lens]]es bend and focus [[light]]. Ibn Sahl is credited with discovering the law of [[refraction]], now usually called [[Snell's law]].<ref>K. B. Wolf, "Geometry and dynamics in refracting systems", ''European Journal of Physics'' '''16''', p. 14-20, 1995.</ref><ref name=rashed90>R. Rashed, "A pioneer in anaclastics: Ibn Sahl on burning mirrors and lenses", ''[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]'' '''81''', p. 464–491, 1990.</ref> He used this law to work out the shapes of lenses that focus light with no geometric aberrations, known as [[anaclastic lens]]es.

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in [[Western Europe]] as ''Alhacen'' or ''Alhazen'') ([[965]]-[[1040]]), often regarded as the "father of optics"<ref name=Verma>R. L. Verma, "Al-Hazen: father of modern optics", ''Al-Arabi'', 8 (1969): 12-13</ref> and a pioneer of the [[scientific method]], formulated "the first comprehensive and systematic alternative to Greek optical theories."<ref name=Lindberg>D. C. Lindberg, "Alhazen's Theory of Vision and its Reception in the West", ''Isis'', 58 (1967), p. 322.</ref> He postulated in his "Book of Optics" that light was reflected upon different surfaces in different directions, thus causing different light signatures for a certain object that we see.<ref name = "book of optics">{{cite book |last=Lindberg|first=David C.|year=1976 |title=Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler|publisher=University of Chicago Press, Chicago |isbn=0-226-48234-0|oclc=1676198}}</ref> It was a different approach than that which was previously thought by Greek scientists, such as [[Euclid]] or [[Ptolemy]], who believed rays were [[Emission theory (vision)|emitted]] from the eye to an object and back again. Al-Haytham, with this new theory of [[optics]], was able to study the geometric aspects of the visual cone theories without explaining the physiology of perception.<ref name = "ahmad"/> Also in his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham used mechanics to try and understand optics. Using projectiles, he observed that objects that hit a target perpendicularly exert much more force than projectiles that hit at an angle. Al-Haytham applied this discovery to optics and tried to explain why direct light hurts the eye, because direct light approaches perpendicularly and not at an oblique angle.<ref name = "book of optics"/> He developed a [[camera obscura]] to demonstrate that light and color from different candles can be passed through a single aperture in straight lines, without intermingling at the aperture.<ref>David C. Lindberg, "The Theory of Pinhole Images from Antiquity to the Thirteenth Century," ''Archive for History of the Exact Sciences'', 5(1968):154-176.</ref> His theories were transmitted to the West.<ref name=Lindberg/> His work influenced [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Peckham]] and [[Vitello]], who built upon his work and ultimately transmitted it to [[Kepler]].<ref name=Lindberg/>

[[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqī al-Dīn]] tried to disprove the widely held belief that light is emitted by the eye and not the object that is being observed. He explained that, if light came from our eyes at a constant velocity it would take much too long to illuminate the stars for us to see them while we are still looking at them, because they are so far away. Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as we open our eyes.<ref>Taqī al-Dīn. Kitāb Nūr, Book I, Chapter 5, MS ‘O', folio 14b; MS ‘S', folio 12a-b</ref>

==Astronomy==
{{main|Astronomy in medieval Islam}}

The Islamic understanding of the astronomical model was based on the Greek Ptolemaic system. However many early astronomers had started to question the model. It was not always accurate in its predictions and was over complicated because astronomers were trying to mathematically describe the movement of the heavenly bodies. [[Ibn al-Haytham]] published ''Al-Shukuk ala Batiamyus'' ("Doubts on Ptolemy"), which outlined his many criticisms of the Ptolemaic paradigm. This book encouraged other astronomers to develop new models to explain celestial movement better than Ptolemy.<ref>Dallal, Ahmad (1999), "Science, Medicine and Technology", in Esposito, John, The Oxford History of Islam, Oxford University Press, New York</ref>
In al-Haytham's ''[[Book of Optics]]'' he argues that the celestial spheres were not made of solid matter, and that the heavens are less dense that air.
<ref name = "Rosen">Rosen, Edward. (1985). "The Dissolution of the Solid Celestial Spheres". ''Journal of the History of Ideas''. Vol 46(1):13-31.</ref>
Al-Haytham eventually concludes that heavenly bodies follow the same laws of physics as earthly bodies.<ref name = "Duhem">Duhem, Pierre. (1969). "To Save the Phenomena: An Essay on the Idea of Physical Theory from Plato to Galileo". University of Chicago Press, Chicago.</ref> Some astronomers theorized about gravity too, [[al-Khazini]] suggests that the gravity an object contains varies depending on its distance from the center of the universe. The center of the universe in this case refers to the center of the Earth.<ref>Mariam Rozhanskaya and I. S. Levinova (1996), "Statics", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Vol. 2, p. 614-642 Routledge, London and New York</ref>

==Mechanics==
===Impetus===
[[John Philoponus]] had rejected the Aristotelian view of motion, and argued that an object acquires an inclination to move when it has a motive power impressed on it. In the eleventh century [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] had roughly adopted this idea, believing that a moving object has force which is dissipated by external agents like air resistance.<ref name = "ibn sina and buridan">Sayili, Aydin. "Ibn Sina and Buridan on the Motion the Projectile". Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences vol. 500(1). p.477-482.</ref>
Ibn Sina made distinction between 'force' and 'inclination' (called "mayl"), he claimed that an object gained mayl when the object is in opposition to its natural motion. So he concluded that continuation of motion is attributed to the inclination that is transferred to the object, and that object will be in motion until the mayl is spent. He also claimed that projectile in a vacuum would not stop unless it is acted upon. This conception of motion is consistent with Newton's first law of motion, inertia, which states that an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an external force.<ref name = Espinoza>Espinoza, Fernando. "An Analysis of the Historical Development of Ideas About Motion and its Implications for Teaching". Physics Education. Vol. 40(2).</ref>
This idea which dissented from the Aristotelian view was basically abandoned until it was described as "impetus" by [[John Buridan]], who may have been influenced by Ibn Sina.<ref name = "ibn sina and buridan"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Zupko|first1=Jack|title=John Buridan|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buridan/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=5 February 2019|date=2015}}</ref>

===Acceleration===
In [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī]] text ''Shadows'', he recognizes that non-uniform motion is the result of acceleration.<ref name = "al-biruni">{{cite web| title=Biography of Al-Biruni| publisher = University of St. Andrews, Scotland |url = http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Biruni.html}}</ref> Ibn-Sina's theory of mayl tried to relate the velocity and weight of a moving object, this idea closely resembled the concept of momentum<ref name = "Nasr & Razavi">Nasr S.H., Razavi M.A.. "The islamic Intellectual Tradition in Persia" (1996). Routledge</ref> 
Aristotle's theory of motion stated that a constant force produces a uniform motion, [[Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī]] contradicted this and developed his own theory of motion. In his theory he showed that velocity and acceleration are two different things and force is proportional to acceleration and not velocity.

===Reaction===
[[Ibn Bajjah]] proposed that for every force there is always a reaction force. While he did not specify that these forces be equal it is still an early version of the third law of motion which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.<ref name = "Franco">Franco, Abel B..
