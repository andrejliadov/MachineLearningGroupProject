The '''Fred Hoyle Medal and Prize''' was established in 2008 by the [[Institute of Physics]] of London for distinguished contributions to astrophysics, gravitational physics or cosmology. The medal is named after astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]] who formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis. The medal is made of silver and accompanied by a prize and a certificate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/about/awards/subject/hoyle/page_72451.html |title=Fred Hoyle Medal and Prize |publisher=Institute of Physics |accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref> The medal was awarded biennially from 2008 to 2016.
