The <math>B</math> field in the action is supposed to be a <math>so(3, 1)</math>-valued [[2-form]], i.e. taking values in the [[Lie algebra]] of a [[special orthogonal group]]. The term

:<math>B^{ij} \wedge B^{kl}</math>

in the action has the same symmetries as it does to provide the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]]. But the form of

:<math>B^{ij}</math>

is not unique and can be posed by the different forms:
*<math>\pm e^i \wedge e^j</math>
*<math>\pm \epsilon^{ijkl} e_k \wedge e_l</math>
where <math>e^i</math> is the [[Tetrad (general relativity)|tetrad]] and <math>\epsilon^{ijkl}</math> is the [[antisymmetric symbol]] of the <math>so(3, 1)</math>-valued 2-form fields.

The Plebanski action can be constrained to produce the [[BF model]] which is a theory of no local [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. [[John W. Barrett]] and [[Louis Crane]] modeled the analogous constraint on the summation over [[spin foam]].

The Barrett–Crane model on spin foam quantizes the [[Plebanski action]], but its [[functional integration|path integral]] amplitude corresponds to the degenerate <math>B</math> field and not the specific definition

:<math>B^{ij} = e^i \wedge e^j</math>,

which formally satisfies the [[Einstein's field equation]] of [[general relativity]]. However, if analysed with the tools of [[loop quantum gravity]] the Barrett–Crane model gives an incorrect long-distance limit [https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.0883], and so the model is not identical to loop quantum gravity.
