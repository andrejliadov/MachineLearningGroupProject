===Composition===
[[File:Proton quark structure.svg|150px|thumb|left|A [[proton]] is composed of three [[quark]]s.]]

===Stability===
Both elementary (such as [[muon]]s) and composite particles (such as [[uranium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]), are known to undergo [[particle decay]]. Those that do not are called stable particles, such as the [[electron]] or a [[helium-4]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. The [[mean lifetime|lifetime]] of stable particles can be either [[infinity|infinite]] or large enough to hinder attempts to observe such decays. In the latter case, those particles are called "[[observationally stable]]". In general, a particle decays from a high-[[energy state]] to a lower-energy state by emitting some form of [[radiation]], such as the emission of [[photon]]s.

==''N''-body simulation==
{{Main|N-body simulation}}
In [[computational physics]], [[N-body simulation|''N''-body simulations]] (also called ''N''-particle simulations) are simulations of [[dynamical system]]s of particles under the influence of certain conditions, such as being subject to [[gravitation|gravity]].<ref name=Graps>{{cite web

 |url-status   = dead
}}</ref> These simulations are very common in [[cosmology]] and [[computational fluid dynamics]].

''N'' refers to the [[particle number|number of particles]] considered. As simulations with higher ''N'' are more computationally intensive, systems with large numbers of actual particles will often be approximated to a smaller number of particles, and simulation algorithms need to be [[N-body simulation#Calculation optimizations|optimized through various methods]].<ref name=Graps/>

==Distribution of particles==
{{main|Colloid}}
[[File:ColloidalStability.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Examples of a stable and of an unstable colloidal dispersion.]]
Colloidal particles are the components of a colloid. A colloid is a substance microscopically dispersed evenly throughout another substance.<ref>

Colloidal systems (also called colloidal solutions or colloidal suspensions) are the subject of [[interface and colloid science]].  [[Suspended solids]] may be held in a liquid, while solid or liquid particles suspended in a gas together form an [[aerosol]]. Particles may also be suspended in the form of [[atmospheric particulate matter]], which may constitute [[air pollution]]. Larger particles can similarly form [[marine debris]] or [[space debris]]. A conglomeration of discrete solid, macroscopic particles may be described as a [[granular material]].

===Composition===
[[File:Proton quark structure.svg|150px|thumb|left|A [[proton]] is composed of three [[quark]]s.]]
Particles can also be classified according to composition. ''[[Composite particle]]s'' refer to particles that have [[wikt:composition|composition]] – that is particles which are made of other particles.<ref>

===Stability===
Both elementary (such as [[muon]]s) and composite particles (such as [[uranium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]), are known to undergo [[particle decay]]. Those that do not are called stable particles, such as the [[electron]] or a [[helium-4]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. The [[mean lifetime|lifetime]] of stable particles can be either [[infinity|infinite]] or large enough to hinder attempts to observe such decays. In the latter case, those particles are called "[[observationally stable]]". In general, a particle decays from a high-[[energy state]] to a lower-energy state by emitting some form of [[radiation]], such as the emission of [[photon]]s.

==''N''-body simulation==
{{Main|N-body simulation}}
In [[computational physics]], [[N-body simulation|''N''-body simulations]] (also called ''N''-particle simulations) are simulations of [[dynamical system]]s of particles under the influence of certain conditions, such as being subject to [[gravitation|gravity]].<ref name=Graps>{{cite web

 |url-status   = dead
}}</ref> These simulations are very common in [[cosmology]] and [[computational fluid dynamics]].

''N'' refers to the [[particle number|number of particles]] considered. As simulations with higher ''N'' are more computationally intensive, systems with large numbers of actual particles will often be approximated to a smaller number of particles, and simulation algorithms need to be [[N-body simulation#Calculation optimizations|optimized through various methods]].<ref name=Graps/>

==Distribution of particles==
{{main|Colloid}}
[[File:ColloidalStability.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Examples of a stable and of an unstable colloidal dispersion.]]
Colloidal particles are the components of a colloid. A colloid is a substance microscopically dispersed evenly throughout another substance.<ref>
{{cite web

 |accessdate=2015-04-12
}}</ref> Such colloidal system can be [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]]eous; as well as continuous or dispersed. The dispersed-phase particles have a diameter of between approximately 5 and 200 [[nanometre|nanometers]].<ref>

}}</ref> Soluble particles smaller than this will form a solution as opposed to a colloid. Colloidal systems (also called colloidal solutions or colloidal suspensions) are the subject of [[interface and colloid science]].  [[Suspended solids]] may be held in a liquid, while solid or liquid particles suspended in a gas together form an [[aerosol]]. Particles may also be suspended in the form of [[atmospheric particulate matter]], which may constitute [[air pollution]]. Larger particles can similarly form [[marine debris]] or [[space debris]]. A conglomeration of discrete solid, macroscopic particles may be described as a [[granular material]].
