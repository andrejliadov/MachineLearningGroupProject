The '''United States Invitational Young Physicists Tournament''' (USIYPT) is an annual physics research and debate tournament for high school students, held the last weekend in January. School-based teams of four students investigate several undergraduate-level research problems in preparation for the tournament.  The competition itself consists of "physics fights," student-led debates over the quality of each team's solution. Teams are judged on their own solutions to the problems and on their ability to engage in evaluation and discussion of other teams' solutions. [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] won their second straight championship in 2019.  [[The Harker School]] of San Jose, California has earned three championships, the most of any school.  The 2020 tournament was held at [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] on February 8-9.

== History ==
The United States sent teams to the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament]] several times in the 2000s, and achieved a second-place finish in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.iypt.org/collection/#2005|title=IYPT Archive|year=2012|accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref> The nonprofit United States Association for Young Physicists Tournaments was incorporated in 2005, initially for the purpose of supporting and training the US team as well as to spread the pedagogical methodology of preparing and conducting the "physics fight."<ref name="Oldaker 48–51">{{cite journal

The one-day event at the North Carolina School of Science and Math (NCSSM) included five teams, all from the United States; [[Woodberry Forest School]] won the inaugural championship.<ref name=2007pressrelease>{{cite web |url=http://www.usaypt.org/NYPT%202007/USAYPT%20pr%2026%20Feb%2007.pdf | title=USAYPT holds annual February tournaments |publisher=United States Association for Young Physicists Tournaments |date=26 February 2007 |accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref>

The 2008 tournament, also at NCSSM, included the first "international" team: [[Brisbane Girls Grammar School]]. They faced [[Woodberry Forest School]], a boys' boarding school in central Virginia. In the final physics fight, Brisbane's Sarah Thang and Samantha Luck outdueled Woodberry's Chris McLamb and Robert Bauer for the title.<ref name = "2008 TPT">{{cite journal

The 2014 tournament was held at the Harker School in [[San Jose, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usaypt.org/USIYPT%202013/2013%20USIYPT%20Announcement/USIYPT2013%20nationaltournament.htm|title=USIYPT2013 national tournament|publisher=United States Invitational Young Physicists Tournament|accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref>  The Harker School won the title with playoff victories over Woodberry Forest School and Shenzhen Middle School on the "Magnet Stack" and "Ball Stack" problems.  Guilderland High School of New York won the Clifford Swartz Trophy for best poster.

In 2015, the USIYPT moved back to Woodberry Forest School.  The final rounds were switched to a pool-play format.  The Harker School and Woodberry Forest met twice in those final rounds, with Harker edging Woodberry 79-77 for the 2016 title.  Other finalists included Rye Country Day, who were 1/10 of a point off Woodberry's pace; and first-time USIYPT participant [[RDFZ|Renmin University High School]] of Beijing, China.

Second-year participant [[Phoenixville Area High School]] of Pennsylvania topped the standings after the preliminary rounds in the 2016 USIYPT.  They, Harker, [[Rye Country Day School]], and Shenzhen Middle School  competed in the final rounds, with Shenzhen coasting to the championship.

At the 2017 tournament at the [[University of the Sciences]], the Harker School was the highest ranked of the six teams who entered the playoff rounds.  [[Rye Country Day School]] emerged from those rounds with a convincing victory of 77-72 against [[High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China|RDFZ of Beijing]], due in part to an especially innovative approach to measuring Planck's constant conducted by Charlie Curnin and Kasey Luo in their high school laboratory<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://physics.randolphcollege.edu/usaypt/USIYPT%202017/results.html|title=this is copied from Greg Jacobs|website=physics.randolphcollege.edu|access-date=2017-04-10}}</ref>. 

In 2018, [[Randolph College]] hosted the largest-ever USIYPT, including fifteen schools from all over the US and the world.  [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] won their first-ever trophy in their fourth year of participation.

At the [https://jacobsphysics.blogspot.com/2019/02/us-invitational-young-physicists.html 2019 tournament] at [[Rye Country Day School]], [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] won their second straight championship, with first-time attendees [[Phillips Andover Academy]] in second place. In the late stages of the tournament, Swartz Trophy winners [[Pioneer School of Ariana]], Tunisia and [[The Harker School]] competed in the first partially student-juried physics fight.

== The Physics Fight ==
The USIYPT consists of six preliminary rounds and a set of final rounds.  In each round, called a "Physics Fight," a student from the reporting team presents a 10-minute summary of their research into one of the four official tournament problems.  Next, a student from another team engages the reporter in a 12-minute conversation about the reporting team's project.  This opponent is charged with helping the audience understand the strengths and weaknesses of the report by means of a series of discussion questions.  Only after this conversation is complete are jury members allowed to question the presenting students directly.  Teams are judged as much on their ability to ask and answer questions in the physics fight as on the quality of their initial presentations.

== Teacher education ==
Unusual among science competitions, the USIYPT aims to improve physics teaching skills as well as student understanding of the subject. High school teachers are participating members of each school's research team. The sponsoring organization chooses problems for each tournament that are "nontrivial, but not impossible," whose solutions are not necessarily unknown to practicing professional physicists, but are generally new to high school teachers and students. Research is expected to be conducted primarily in each team's school, with direction and assistance from a teacher at that school.<ref>{{cite journal
