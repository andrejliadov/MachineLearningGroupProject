'''''The Big Bang Theory''''' is an American television [[sitcom]] created by [[Chuck Lorre]] and [[Bill Prady]], both of whom served as [[executive producer]]s on the series, along with [[Steven Molaro]]. All three also served as head writers. The show premiered on [[CBS]] on September 24, 2007, and concluded on May 16, 2019, having broadcast a total of 279 episodes over twelve seasons.<ref>[https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/big-bang-theory/cast/288041 "The Big Bang Theory: Cast & Details"]. ''[[TV Guide]]''. Retrieved January 28, 2013.</ref>

The show originally centered on five characters living in [[Pasadena, California]]: [[Leonard Hofstadter]] and [[Sheldon Cooper]], both [[physicist]]s at [[Caltech]], who share an apartment; [[Penny (The Big Bang Theory)|Penny]], a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's similarly [[geeky]] and socially awkward friends and co-workers, [[aerospace engineer]] [[Howard Wolowitz]] and [[astrophysicist]] [[Raj Koothrappali]].<ref name="usatoday2007">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-11-04-big-bang_N.htm |title=There's a science to CBS' Big Bang Theory |first=Gary |last=Strauss |date=April 11, 2007 |work=[[USA Today]] |access-date=November 7, 2008}}</ref><ref name="deseretnews2">{{cite web |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695216156,00.html |title=He's a genius|first=Scott D. |last=Pierce |date=October 8, 2007 |website=Deseret News |access-date=December 11, 2008}}</ref> Over time, supporting characters were promoted to starring roles, including [[neuroscientist]] [[Amy Farrah Fowler]], [[microbiologist]] [[Bernadette Rostenkowski]], [[experimental physicist]] [[List of The Big Bang Theory characters#Leslie Winkle|Leslie Winkle]], and comic book store owner [[Stuart Bloom]].

The show was filmed in front of a live audience and was produced by [[Warner Bros. Television]] and [[Chuck Lorre Productions]]. ''The Big Bang Theory'' received mixed reviews from critics throughout its first season, but reception was more favorable in the second and third seasons. Despite early mixed reviews, seven seasons of the show have ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings, ultimately reaching the no. 1 spot in its eleventh season. The show was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]] from 2011 to 2014 and won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]] four times for [[Jim Parsons]]. In total, it won seven Emmy Awards from 46 nominations. Parsons also won the Golden Globe for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Television Comedy Series]] in 2011. In 2017, the series spawned a prequel series, ''[[Young Sheldon]]'', based on Parsons' character, Sheldon Cooper; it also airs on CBS.

The show's pilot episode premiered on September 24, 2007. This was the second pilot produced for the show. A different pilot was produced for the [[2006–07 United States network television schedule|2006–07 television season]] but never aired. The structure of the original unaired pilot was substantially different from the series' current form. The only main characters retained in both pilots were Leonard ([[Johnny Galecki]]) and Sheldon ([[Jim Parsons]]), who are named after [[Sheldon Leonard]], a longtime figure in episodic television as producer, director and actor. A minor character, Althea ([[Vernee Watson]]), appeared in the first scene of both pilots that was retained generally as-is.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chucklorre.com/index-bbt.php?p=187|title=CLP&nbsp;– Vanity Card #187|first=Chuck|last=Lorre|publisher=Chuck Lorre Productions|date=October 15, 2007|access-date=June 7, 2012}}</ref> The first pilot included two female lead characters - Katie, "a street-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior" (played by Canadian actress [[Amanda Walsh]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?date=05/26/06&id=7165|title=Breaking News&nbsp;– Development Update: May 22–26 (Weekly Round-Up)|publisher=TheFutonCritic.com|access-date=May 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/season_pass/2009/05/big-bang-theory-we-didnt-anticipate-how-protective-the-audience-would-feel-toward-our-guys.html|title='Big Bang Theory': 'We didn't anticipate how protective the audience would feel about our guys'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 8, 2009|access-date=January 15, 2010}}</ref> and Gilda, a scientist colleague and friend of the male characters (played by [[Iris Bahr]]). Sheldon and Leonard meet Katie after she breaks up with a boyfriend, and they invite her to share their apartment. Gilda is threatened by Katie's presence. Test audiences reacted negatively to Katie, but they liked Sheldon and Leonard. The original pilot used [[Thomas Dolby]]'s hit "[[She Blinded Me with Science]]" as its theme song.

Although the original pilot was not picked up, its creators were given an opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny ([[Kaley Cuoco]]). The original unaired pilot has never been officially released, but it has circulated on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} On the evolution of the show, [[Chuck Lorre]] said, "We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely, and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal." As to whether the world will ever see the original pilot on a future DVD release, Lorre said, "Wow, that would be something. We will see.

The first and second pilots of ''The Big Bang Theory'' were directed by [[James Burrows]], who did not continue with the show.

===Theme song===
[[Image:Barenaked Ladies - Big Bang Theory Theme (Official Single Cover).png|thumb|right|upright=.91|Single cover for "Big Bang Theory Theme" by [[Barenaked Ladies]] (2007)]]
The Canadian [[alternative rock]] band [[Barenaked Ladies]] wrote and recorded the show's theme song, which describes the history and formation of the universe and the Earth. Co-lead singer [[Ed Robertson]] was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the show after the producers attended one of the band's concerts in Los Angeles. By coincidence, Robertson had recently read [[Simon Singh]]'s book ''[[Big Bang (book)|Big Bang]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/11/02/barenaked-ladies-ed-robertson-talks-big-bang-theory-theme-song|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707131758/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/11/02/barenaked-ladies-ed-robertson-talks-big-bang-theory-theme-song|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 7, 2012|title=Barenaked Ladies' Ed Robertson talks "Big Bang Theory" theme song|date=November 2, 2010|access-date=April 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://imbatman.org/interviews/barenaked-ladies-talk-about-big-bang-theme-song|title=Barenaked Ladies Talk about Big Bang Theme Song|date=April 2, 2010|access-date=April 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410042246/http://imbatman.org/interviews/barenaked-ladies-talk-about-big-bang-theme-song/|archive-date=April 10, 2011}}</ref> and at the concert he improvised a freestyle rap about the origins of the universe.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Lorre and Prady phoned him shortly thereafter and asked him to write the theme song. Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows, but ending up being rejected because producers favored songs by other artists, Robertson agreed to write the theme only after learning that Lorre and Prady had not asked anyone else.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

On October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the song was released commercially.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000XKMQZY|title=Big Bang Theory Theme|author=Barenaked Ladies|publisher=Amazon Digital Services, Inc.|access-date=October 21, 2007}}{{dead link|date=October 2016}}</ref> Although some unofficial pages identify the song title as "History of Everything,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/history-of-everything-lyrics-barenaked-ladies.html|title=History Of Everything Lyrics|website=metrolyrics.com|access-date=August 23, 2013}}</ref> the cover art for the single identifies the title as "Big Bang Theory Theme."

==Recurring themes and elements==
===Science===
Much of the series focuses on science, particularly physics. The four main male characters are employed at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] and have science-related occupations, as do Bernadette and Amy. The characters frequently banter about scientific theories or news (notably around the [[cold open|start of the show]]), and make science-related jokes.

Science has also interfered with the characters' romantic lives. Leslie breaks up with Leonard when he sides with Sheldon in his support for [[string theory]] rather than [[loop quantum gravity]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Codpiece Topology|episode-link=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep19|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=September 29, 2008|season=2|number=2}}</ref> When Leonard joins Sheldon, Raj, and Howard on a three-month Arctic research trip, it separates Leonard and Penny at a time when their relationship is budding.

The four main male characters are all avid [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and comic book fans and memorabilia collectors.

''[[Star Trek]]'' in particular is frequently referenced, and Sheldon identifies strongly with the character of [[Spock]], so much so that when he is given a used napkin signed by [[Leonard Nimoy]] as a Christmas gift from Penny he is overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude ("I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!").<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis|episode-link=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep28|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=December 15, 2008|season=2|number=11|time=18:00}}</ref> ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' cast members [[William Shatner]] and [[George Takei]] have made cameos, and Leonard Nimoy made a cameo as the voice of Sheldon's vintage Mr. Spock action figure.

Leonard and Sheldon have had conversations in the [[Klingon language]].

They are also fans of ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'', and ''[[Doctor Who]]''. In the episode "The Ornithophobia Diffusion", when there is a delay in watching ''Star Wars'' on Blu-ray, Howard complains, "If we don't start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again" (referring to Lucas' controversial alterations to the films). In "The Hot Troll Deviation", [[Katee Sackhoff]] of ''Battlestar Galactica'' appeared as Howard's fantasy dream girl. The characters have different tastes in franchises, with Sheldon praising ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' but disapproving of Leonard's enjoyment of ''[[Babylon 5]]''.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Large Hadron Collision|episode-link=The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep15|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=February 8, 2010|season=3|number=15|minutes=12:02}}</ref> With regard to fantasy, the four make frequent references to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels and movies. Additionally, Howard can speak [[Sindarin]], one of the two [[Elvish languages|Elvish]] languages from ''The Lord of the Rings''.

Various games have been featured, as well as referenced, on the series (e.g. ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'', ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'', [[Donkey Kong]], etc.), including fictional games like ''Mystic Warlords of Ka'a'' (which became a reality in 2011)<ref>[http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2011/09/23/big-bang-theory-fake-game-turns-real "Big Bang Theory" Fake Game Turns Real], Chris Marlow, Digital Media Wire, September 23, 2011</ref> and [[Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock]].

===Leonard and Penny's relationship===
One of the recurring plot lines is the relationship between Leonard and Penny. Leonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode, and his need to do favors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Meanwhile, Penny dates a series of muscular, attractive, unintelligent, and insensitive jocks. Their first long-term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a three-month expedition to the [[North Pole]] in the season 3 premiere. However, when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her, she realizes she cannot say it back, and they break up. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people, most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely believe that Raj has slept with Penny, and it ultimately ends when Priya sleeps with a former boyfriend in "[[The Good Guy Fluctuation]]".

Penny, who admits to missing Leonard in "[[The Roommate Transmogrification]]", accepts his request to renew their relationship in "[[The Beta Test Initiation]]". After Penny suggests having sex in "The Launch Acceleration", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. Penny says "no" but does not break up with him. She stops a proposal a second time in "The Tangible Affection Proof". In the sixth-season episode, "The 43 Peculiarity", Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives significant attention from the opposite sex, Penny is secure enough in their relationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without worrying in "The Bon Voyage Reaction". After Leonard returns, their relationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode "The Gorilla Dissolution", Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard realizes that she is serious, he proposes with a ring that he had been saving for years. Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8 finale, but beforehand, wanting no secrets, Leonard admits to kissing another woman, Mandy Chow ([[Melissa Tang]]) while on an expedition on the [[North Sea]]. Despite this, Leonard and Penny finally elope in the season 9 premiere and remain happily married. By the Season 9 finale, Penny and Leonard decide to have a second small, unofficial wedding ceremony for their family and friends to make up for eloping. In season 10, Sheldon moves into Penny's old apartment with Amy, allowing Penny and Leonard to finally live on their own as husband and wife.

In season 12, Penny announces that she does not want to have any children and Leonard reluctantly supports her decision. Later, her old boyfriend Zack and his new wife want Leonard to be a surrogate father to their kid since Zack is infertile. Penny reluctantly agrees to let Leonard donate his sperm. However, when she tries to seduce Leonard despite knowing he has to be abstinent for a few days, her visiting father, Wyatt, points out to Penny that her own actions suggest she is more conflicted over having kids than she lets on, to which she admits she feels bad about letting him and Leonard down if she goes through with never having children. He says that despite her flaws, parenthood is the best thing that ever happened to him and he does not want her to miss out, but he says he will support her no matter what she decides. Leonard eventually changes his mind about donating his sperm, not wanting a child in the world that he cannot raise. In the series finale, Penny reveals to her friends that she is pregnant with Leonard's baby, and she changes her mind about not wanting children.

===Sheldon and Amy's relationship===
In the third-season finale, Raj and Howard sign Sheldon up for online dating to find a woman compatible with Sheldon, and they discover [[Neuroscientist|neurobiologist]] Amy Farrah Fowler. Like Sheldon, she has a history of social ineptitude and participates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother. This spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while insisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In "The Agreement Dissection", Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a night of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed, Sheldon says "fascinating" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in "The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition". The same night he draws up "The Relationship Agreement" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa (similar to his "Roommate Agreement" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having had a lawyer read through it.

In "The Launch Acceleration", Amy tries to use her "neurobiology bag of tricks" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. Her efforts appear to be working as Sheldon is not happy, but he makes no attempt to stop her. In the final fifth-season episode "The Countdown Reflection", Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode "The Date Night Variable", after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this expectation, Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over unless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic speech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie. In "The Cooper/Kripke Inversion", Sheldon states that he has been working on his discomfort about physical contact and admits that "it's a possibility" that he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar feelings in "The Love Spell Potential". Sheldon explains that he never thought about intimacy with anyone before Amy.<ref>The Big Bang Theory, Episode 6/23, "The Love Spell Potential.</ref>

"The Locomotive Manipulation" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates a kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm, he discovers that he enjoys the feeling. Consequently, Sheldon slowly starts to open up over the rest of the season, and he starts a more intimate relationship with Amy. However, in the season finale, Sheldon leaves town temporarily to cope with several changes and Amy becomes distraught. However, 45 days into the trip, Sheldon gets mugged and calls for Leonard to drive him home, only to be confronted by Amy, who is upset over not being contacted by him in weeks. When Sheldon admits he did not call her because he was too embarrassed to admit that he could not make it on his own, Amy accepts that he is not perfect. In "The Prom Equivalency", Sheldon hides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the resulting stand-off, Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon, but he surprises her by saying that he loves her too. This prompts Amy to have a panic attack.

In the season eight finale, Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment on their fifth anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about the future of their relationship, unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to her. Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she breaks up with him. Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for the next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the first time on Amy's birthday. In season ten, Amy's apartment is flooded, and she and Sheldon decide to move in together into Penny's apartment as part of a five-week experiment to determine compatibility with each other's living habits. It goes well and they decide to make the arrangement permanent.

In the season eleven premiere, Sheldon proposes to Amy and she accepts. The two get married in the eleventh-season finale.

===Soft Kitty===
{{main|Soft Kitty}}
In the show, the song "Soft Kitty" was described by Sheldon as a song sung by his mother when he was ill. Its repeated use in the series popularized the song.<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert |last=Seidman|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/11/16/cbs-com-launches-soft-kitty-contest-inspired-by-popular-song-from-cbs-hit-the-big-bang-theory/72269/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119093338/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/11/16/cbs-com-launches-soft-kitty-contest-inspired-by-popular-song-from-cbs-hit-the-big-bang-theory/72269 |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 19, 2010 |title=CBS.com Launches "Soft Kitty" Contest Inspired by Popular Song From CBS Hit 'The Big Bang Theory' |work=TV by the Numbers |date=November 16, 2010 |access-date=August 4, 2013}}</ref> A scene depicting the origin of the song in Sheldon's childhood is depicted in an episode of ''[[Young Sheldon]]'', which aired on February 1, 2018. It shows Sheldon's mother Mary singing the song to her son, who is suffering with the [[influenza|flu]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Tyler|title='Young Sheldon' reveals the origin story of the 'Soft Kitty' song|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/02/01/young-sheldon-reveals-origin-story-soft-kitty-song.html|publisher=Fox News Channel|access-date=February 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202032842/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/02/01/young-sheldon-reveals-origin-story-soft-kitty-song.html|archive-date=February 2, 2018|url-status=live|date=February 2018}}</ref>

===Howard's mother===
In scenes set at Howard's home, he interacts with his rarely-seen mother (voiced by [[Carol Ann Susi]] until her death) by shouting from room to room in the house. She similarly interacts with other characters in this manner.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Countdown Reflection|episode-link=The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep24|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=May 10, 2012|season=5|number=24|minutes=19:54}}</ref> She reflects the [[Jewish mother stereotype]] in some ways, such as being overly controlling of Howard's adult life and sometimes trying to make him feel guilty about causing her trouble. She is dependent on Howard, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the morning. Howard, in turn, is attached to his mother to the point where she still cuts his meat for him, takes him to the dentist, does his laundry and "grounds" him when he returns home after briefly moving out.<ref name="Episode4.16">{{cite episode|title=The Cohabitation Formulation|episode-link=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep16|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=February 17, 2011|season=4|number=16}}</ref> Until Howard's marriage to Bernadette in the fifth-season finale, Howard's former living situation led Leonard's psychiatrist mother to speculate that he may suffer from some type of pathology,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Maternal Capacitance|episode-link=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep15|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=February 9, 2009|season=2|number=15}}</ref> and Sheldon to refer to their relationship as [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Apology Insufficiency|episode-link=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep7|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=November 4, 2010|season=4|number=7}}</ref> In season 8, Howard's mother dies in her sleep while in Florida, which devastates Howard and Stuart, who briefly lived with Mrs. Wolowitz.

===Apartment building elevator===
In the apartment building where Sheldon, Leonard and Penny (and later Amy) live, the elevator has been out of order throughout most of the series, forcing characters to have to use the stairs. Stairway conversations between characters occur in almost every episode, often serving as a transition between longer scenes. The Season 3 episode, "The Staircase Implementation" reveals that the elevator was broken when Leonard was experimenting with rocket fuel.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Staircase Implementation|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648756/|access-date=March 8, 2019}}</ref> In the penultimate episode of the series, the elevator is returned to an operational state, causing Sheldon some angst.

===Vanity cards===
Like most shows created by Chuck Lorre, ''The Big Bang Theory'' ends by showing for one second a [[vanity card]] written by Lorre after the credits, followed by the Warner Bros. Television closing logo. These cards are archived on Lorre's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chucklorre.com/index.php|title=Chuck Lorre Productions – Vanity Cards|publisher=Chucklorre.com |date=May 19, 2011|access-date=July 28, 2011}}</ref> The series final vanity card reads simply "The End".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chucklorre.com/index.php?p=622|title=CLP - Vanity Card #622|website=www.chucklorre.com}}</ref>

===U.S. ratings===
''The Big Bang Theory'' started off slowly in the ratings, failing to make the top 50 in its first season (ranking 68th), and ranking 40th in its second season. When the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, however, ''The Big Bang Theory'' ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the adults 18–49 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83&nbsp;million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viacomcbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/releases/view?id=22817|title=CBS opens the new season with a big bang 'The Big Bang Theory' Premieres with its largest audience ever and highest adult 18–49 rating|publisher=ViacomCBS Press Express|access-date=June 25, 2020}}</ref> After the first three seasons aired at different times on Monday nights, CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the [[2010–11 United States network television schedule|2010–2011 schedule]], to be in direct competition with [[NBC]]'s [[Must See TV|Comedy Block]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[American Idol]]'' (then the longest reigning leading primetime show on U.S. television from 2004 to 2011).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/cbs-moves-big-bang-theory-thursday-nights-fall-challenge-shows-article-1.463680|title=CBS moves 'The Big Bang Theory' to Thursday nights this fall to 'challenge' other shows|last=Hinckley|first=David|date=July 29, 2010|access-date=June 4, 2013|location=New York|work=Daily News}}</ref> During its fourth season, it became television's highest rated comedy, just barely beating out eight-year champ ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''. However, in the age 18–49 demographic (the show's target age range), it was the second highest rated comedy, behind [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Modern Family]]''. The fifth season opened with viewing figures of over 14 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/09/23/thursday-finals-big-bang-theory-the-x-factor-parks-recreation-and-whitney-adjusted-up/104707|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925201258/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/09/23/thursday-finals-big-bang-theory-the-x-factor-parks-recreation-and-whitney-adjusted-up/104707/|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 25, 2011|title=Thursday Finals: 'Big Bang Theory,' 'The X Factor,' 'Parks & Recreation' and 'Whitney' Adjusted Up|publisher=TV by the Numbers|date=September 23, 2011|access-date=September 25, 2011|author=Seidman, Robert}}</ref>

Showrunner Steve Molaro, who took over from Bill Prady with the sixth season, credits some of the show's success to the sitcom's exposure in [[Broadcast syndication#Off-netowork syndication|off-network syndication]], particularly on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], while Michael Schneider of ''[[TV Guide]]'' attributes it to the timeslot move two seasons earlier. Chuck Lorre and CBS Entertainment president Nina Tassler also credit the success to the influence of Molaro, in particular the deepening exploration of the firmly established regular characters and their interpersonal relationships, such as the on-again, off-again relationship between Leonard and Penny.<ref name=TVGuide1.28.13>Schneider, Michael (January 28, 2013).

===UK distribution and ratings===
The show made its United Kingdom debut on [[Channel 4]] on February 14, 2008. The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17, 2009, at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010.

==Offshoots==
===Plagiarized series===
Through the use of his [[Production logo|vanity cards]] at the end of episodes, Lorre alleged that the program had been [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] by a show produced and aired in [[Belarus]]. Officially titled ''Теоретики'' (''The Theorists''), the show features "clones" of the main characters, a similar opening sequence, and what appears to be a very close Russian translation of the scripts.<ref>Lyons, Margaret (February 9, 2010). [http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/02/09/big-bang-theory-belarus/ "'The Theorists': 'Big Bang Theory'{{'}}s big Belarusian rip-off"]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.</ref> Lorre expressed annoyance and described his inquiry with the Warner Bros. legal department about options. The television production company and station's close relationship with the Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is operated by the government.<ref>[[Lorre, Chuck]] (February 8, 2010). [http://www.chucklorre.com/index.php?p=277 "Vanity Card #277"]. "The Official Vanity Card Archives". Chuck Lorre Productions.</ref>

However, no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as soon as it became known that the show was unlicensed, the actors quit and the producers canceled it.<ref>[http://charter97.org/ru/news/2010/2/18/26493/ "STV canceled the pirated show 'The Theorists'"]. Xaptbir97. February 18, 2010. {{in lang|ru}}</ref> Dmitriy Tankovich (who plays Leonard's counterpart, "Seva") said in an interview, "I'm upset. At first, the actors were told all legal issues were resolved. We didn't know it wasn't the case, so when the creators of ''The Big Bang Theory'' started talking about the show, I was embarrassed. I can't understand why our people first do, and then think. I consider this to be the rock bottom of my career. And I don't want to take part in a stolen show".<ref>[http://charter97.org/ru/news/2010/2/12/26330/ "'The Theorists' actors don't want to stay with a stolen project"]. Xaptbir97.

===Spin-off series===
{{anchor|Young Sheldon}}{{main|Young Sheldon}}
In November 2016, it was reported that CBS was in negotiations to create a spin-off of ''The Big Bang Theory'' centered on Sheldon as a young boy. The prequel series, described as "a ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]''-esque [[Single-camera setup|single-camera]] family comedy" would be executive-produced by Lorre and Molaro, with Prady expected to be involved in some capacity, and intended to air in the [[2017–18 United States network television schedule|2017–18 season]] alongside ''The Big Bang Theory''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2016/11/the-big-bang-theory-sheldon-spinoff-prequel-series-cbs-1201849838/|title='The Big Bang Theory' Eyes Young Sheldon Spinoff Prequel Series On CBS|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=November 7, 2016|access-date=March 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/big-bang-theory-sheldon-prequel-series-works-at-cbs-944826|title='Big Bang Theory' Sheldon Prequel Series in the Works at CBS|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=November 7, 2016|access-date=March 15, 2017}}</ref> The initial idea for the series came from Parsons, who passed it along to ''The Big Bang Theory'' producers.<ref name="YoungSheldonCast" /> In early March 2017, [[Iain Armitage]] was cast as the younger Sheldon, as well as [[Zoe Perry]] as his mother, Mary Cooper.

On March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off ''Young Sheldon'' series. [[Jon Favreau]] directed and executive produced the pilot.
