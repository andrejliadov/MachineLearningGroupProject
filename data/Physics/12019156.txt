'''Aeromechanics''' is the science about mechanics that deals with the motion of air and other gases, involving [[aerodynamics]], [[thermophysics]] and [[aerostatics]]. It is the branch of mechanics that deals with the motion of gases (especially air) and their effects on bodies in the flow. The fluid flow and structure are interactive systems and their interaction is dynamic. The fluid force causes the structure to deform which changes its orientation to the flow and hence the resulting fluid force.

Areas that comprise this are within the [[technology]] of [[aircraft]] and [[helicopter]]s since these use [[Propeller (aircraft)|propellers]] and [[Helicopter rotor|rotors]].
