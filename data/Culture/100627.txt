'''Emo''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|m|oʊ}} is a [[rock music]] genre characterized by an emphasis on [[emotional expression]], sometimes through [[confessional]] lyrics. It emerged as a style of {{nowrap|[[post-hardcore]]}} from the {{nowrap|mid-1980s}} [[hardcore punk]] [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|movement]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where it was known as '''emotional hardcore''' or '''emocore''' and pioneered by bands such as [[Rites of Spring]] and [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]]. In the early–mid 1990s, emo was adopted and reinvented by [[alternative rock]], [[indie rock]] and [[pop punk]] bands such as [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[Jawbreaker (band)|Jawbreaker]], [[Weezer]] and [[Jimmy Eat World]], with Weezer breaking into the mainstream during this time. By the {{nowrap|mid-1990s,}} bands such as [[Braid (band)|Braid]], [[the Promise Ring]] and [[the Get Up Kids]] emerged from the burgeoning [[Midwest emo]] scene, and several [[independent record label]]s began to specialize in the genre. Meanwhile, [[screamo]], a more aggressive style of emo using [[screamed vocals]], also emerged, pioneered by the [[San Diego]] bands [[Heroin (band)|Heroin]] and [[Antioch Arrow]]. Screamo achieved mainstream success in the 2000s with bands like [[Hawthorne Heights]], [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]], [[Story of the Year]], [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]], [[The Used]], and [[Underoath]].

Often seen as a subculture, emo also signifies a specific relationship between fans and artists and certain aspects of fashion, culture and behavior. Emo fashion has been associated with [[skinny jeans]]; tight {{nowrap|t-shirt}}s with band names; studded belts; and flat, straight, jet-black hair with long bangs. Fans of emo music who dress like this are referred to as "emo kids" or "emos". Emos are known for listening to emo bands like [[My Chemical Romance]], [[Fall Out Boy]], Hawthorne Heights, The Used, and [[AFI (band)|AFI]]. The emo subculture is stereotypically associated with emotion, sensitivity, [[misanthropy]], shyness, introversion and [[angst]], as well as [[depression (mood)|depression]], {{nowrap|[[self-harm]]}} and [[suicide]]. Its quick rise in popularity in the early 2000s inspired a backlash, with bands such as My Chemical Romance and [[Panic! at the Disco]] rejecting the emo label because of the social stigma and controversy surrounding it.

Emo and its subgenre [[emo pop]] entered mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the success of Jimmy Eat World and [[Dashboard Confessional]] and many artists signed to [[major record labels]]. Bands such as My Chemical Romance, AFI, Fall Out Boy and [[the Red Jumpsuit Apparatus]] continued the genre's popularity during the rest of the decade. By the early 2010s, emo's popularity had declined, with some groups changing their sound and others disbanding. Meanwhile, however, a mainly underground [[emo revival]] emerged, with bands such as [[The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die]] and [[Modern Baseball]] drawing on the sound and aesthetic of 1990s emo. During the late 2010s, a fusion genre called [[emo rap]] was mainstream, with some of emo rap's most famous artists including [[XXXTentacion]], [[Juice Wrld]], and [[Lil Peep]].

Emo, which began as a post-hardcore subgenre,<ref name="postHC" /> was part of the 1980s hardcore punk<ref name=EmoAM /> scene in [[Washington, D.C.]] as something different from the violent part of the [[Washington, D.C. hardcore]] scene.<ref name="SubgenresofPunk">{{Cite web |last=Cooper |first=Ryan |title=The Subgenres of Punk Rock |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/subgenres-of-punk-rock-2803348 |access-date=August 9, 2018 |publisher=[[ThoughtCo]]}}</ref>{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|pp=9–11}}{{sfn|Blush|2001|p=157}} Minor Threat fan [[Guy Picciotto]] formed [[Rites of Spring]] in 1984, using the musical style of hardcore punk and combining the musical style with melodic guitars, varied rhythms, and personal, emotional lyrics.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=12}} Many of the band's themes, including nostalgia, romantic bitterness and poetic desperation, became familiar [[Trope (music)|tropes]] of later emo music.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|pp=12–13}} Its performances were public, emotional purges where audience members sometimes wept.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=13}} Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat became a Rites of Spring fan (recording their only album and being their [[Road crew|roadie]]) and formed the emo band [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]], which explored similar themes of self-searching and emotional release.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=14}} Similar bands followed in connection with the "[[Revolution Summer (music)|Revolution Summer]]” of 1985, an attempt by members of the Washington scene to break from the usual characteristics of hardcore punk to a hardcore punk style with different characteristics.{{sfn|Blush|2001|p=157}} Bands such as [[Gray Matter (band)|Gray Matter]], [[Beefeater (band)|Beefeater]], [[Fire Party]], [[Dag Nasty]], and [[Soulside]] were associated with the movement.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=14}}{{sfn|Blush|2001|p=157}}

Although the origins of the word "emo" are uncertain, evidence shows that the word "emo" was coined in the mid-1980s, specifically 1985. According to [[Andy Greenwald]], author of ''[[Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo]]'', "The origins of the term 'emo' are shrouded in mystery&nbsp;... but it first came into common practice in 1985. If Minor Threat was hardcore, then Rites of Spring, with its altered focus, was emotional hardcore or emocore."{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=14}} [[Michael Azerrad]], author of ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'', also traces the word's origins to the mid-1980s: "The style was soon dubbed 'emo-core,' a term everyone involved bitterly detested".{{sfn|Azerrad|2001|p=380}} MacKaye traces it to 1985, attributing it to an article in ''[[Thrasher (magazine)|Thrasher]]'' magazine referring to Embrace and other Washington, D.C. bands as "emo-core" (which he called "the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard in my entire life").<ref name="khanna">{{Cite web |last=Khanna |first=Vish |date=February 2007 |title=Timeline: Ian MacKaye – Out of Step |url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/timeline.aspx?csid1=107 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130110112243/http://exclaim.ca/articles/timeline.aspx?csid1=107 |archive-date=2013-01-10 |access-date=2009-04-19 |publisher=Exclaim.ca}}</ref> Other accounts attribute the word to an audience member at an Embrace show, who shouted as an insult that the band was "emocore".<ref name="DePasquale">{{Cite web |last=DePasquale |first=Ron |title=Embrace: Biography |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p12874|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=2009-04-21 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref name="Popkin">{{Cite web |last=Popkin |first=Helen |date=2006-03-26 |title=What Exactly Is 'Emo,' Anyway? |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/what-exactly-emo-anyway-wbna11720603 |access-date=2009-04-21 |website=Today.com |publisher=Today.com}}</ref> Others have said that MacKaye coined the word when he used it self-mockingly in a magazine, or that it originated with Rites of Spring.<ref name="Popkin" /> The "emocore" label quickly spread through the DC punk scene, and was associated with many bands associated with [[Ian MacKaye]]'s [[Dischord Records]].<ref name="DePasquale" /> Although many of the bands rejected the term, it stayed. [[Jenny Toomey]] recalled, "The only people who used it at first were the ones that were jealous over how big and fanatical a scene it was. [Rites of Spring] existed well before the term did and they hated it. But there was this weird moment, like when people started calling music '[[grunge]],' where you were using the term even though you hated it."{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|pp=14–15}} The Washington, D.C. emo scene lasted only a few years, and by 1986, most of emo's major bands (including Rites of Spring, Embrace, Gray Matter and Beefeater) had broken up.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=15}} However, its ideas and aesthetics spread quickly across the country through a network of homemade [[zine]]s, vinyl records and hearsay.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|pp=15–17}} According to Greenwald, the Washington, D.C. scene laid the groundwork for emo's subsequent incarnations:

{{quote|What had happened in D.C. in the mid-eighties—the shift from anger to action, from extroverted rage to internal turmoil, from an individualized mass to a mass of individuals—was in many ways a test case for the transformation of the national punk scene over the next two decades. The imagery, the power of the music, the way people responded to it, and the way the bands burned out instead of fading away—all have their origins in those first few performances by Rites of Spring. The roots of emo were laid, however unintentionally, by fifty or so people in the nation's capital. And in some ways, it was never as good and surely never as pure again. Certainly, the Washington scene was the only time "emocore" had any consensus definition as a genre.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|pp=15–16}}}}

===1991–1994: Reinvention===
As the Washington, D.C. emo movement spread across the United States, local bands began to emulate its style.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=18}} Emo combined the fatalism, theatricality and isolation of [[The Smiths]] with hardcore punk's uncompromising, dramatic worldview.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=18}} Despite the number of bands and the variety of locales, emocore's late-1980s aesthetics remained more-or-less the same: "over-the-top lyrics about feelings wedded to dramatic but decidedly punk music."{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=18}} During the early–mid 1990s, several new bands reinvented emo,{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=19}} making emo expand by becoming a subgenre of genres like indie rock and pop punk.<ref name="EmoAM" /> Chief among them were [[Jawbreaker (band)|Jawbreaker]] and [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], who inspired cult followings, redefined emo and brought it a step closer to the mainstream.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=19}} In the wake of the 1991 success of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'', underground music and subcultures were widely noticed in the United States. New distribution networks emerged, touring routes were codified, and regional and independent acts accessed the national stage.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=19}} Young people across the country became fans of independent music, and punk culture became mainstream.{{sfn|Greenwald|2003|p=19}}

==Criticism and controversy==
===Stereotypes===
Emo has been associated with a stereotype of emotion, sensitivity, shyness, introversion or [[angst]].<ref name="findingemo">{{Cite news |last=La Gorce |first=Tammy |date=2007-08-14 |title=Finding Emo |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/14/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/14njCOVER.html |access-date=2007-10-20}}</ref><ref name="Bunning 35069&pid= Newspace, University of Queensland, School of Journalism and Communication">{{Cite web |last=Bunning |first=Shane |date=2006-06-08 |title=The attack of the clones: an emo-lution in the fashion industry |url=http://www.newspace.uq.edu.au/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=288 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830181445/http://newspace.uq.edu.au/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=288 |archive-date=August 30, 2007 |access-date=2007-10-20 |website=Newspace, School of Journalism and Communication, University of Queensland |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Stiernberg">{{Cite web |last=Stiernberg |first=Bonnie |date=2007-03-13 |title=What is emo? |url=http://media.www.dailyillini.com/media/storage/paper736/news/2007/03/13/Diversions/What-Is.Emo-2773568.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028090354/http://media.www.dailyillini.com/media/storage/paper736/news/2007/03/13/Diversions/What-Is.Emo-2773568.shtml |archive-date=October 28, 2007 |access-date=2007-10-20 |website=[[The Daily Illini]] |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Other stereotypes include [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[self-harm]] and [[suicide]].<ref name="fairfield" /><ref name="Walsh">{{Cite web |last=Walsh |first=Jeremy |date=2007-10-18 |title=Bayside takes Manhattan |url=http://www.timesledger.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18931360&BRD=2676&PAG=461&dept_id=542408&rfi=6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021003108/http://timesledger.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18931360&BRD=2676&PAG=461&dept_id=542408&rfi=6 |archive-date=2007-10-21 |access-date=2007-10-20 |website=Times Ledger}}</ref> Some people explained the difference between emos and goths by saying that "emos hate themselves, while goths hate everyone."<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Emo Youth Subculture |url=http://www.smhp.psych.ucla.edu/pdfdocs/youth/emo.pdf |publisher=[[University of California, Los Angeles]]}}</ref>

====Suicide and self harm====
{{main|Suicide in music subcultures}}
Emo music was blamed for the [[suicide by hanging]] of teenager Hannah Bond by the [[coroner]] at her inquest and her mother, Heather Bond, with emo music reportedly glamorizing suicide; Hannah's apparent obsession with [[My Chemical Romance]] was said to be linked to her death. It was said at the inquest that she was part of an Internet "emo cult", and an image of an emo girl with bloody wrists was on her [[Bebo]] page.<ref name=nme/> Hannah reportedly told her parents that her self-harm was an "emo initiation ceremony".<ref name="nme">{{Cite web |date=2008-05-08 |title=Emo music attacked over teen suicide |url=https://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/36468 |website=NME}}</ref> Heather Bond criticised emo culture: "There are 'emo' websites that show pink teddies hanging themselves."<ref name="nme" /> After the coroner's verdict was reported in ''[[NME]]'', fans of emo music contacted the magazine to deny that it promoted self-harm and suicide.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2008-05-08 |title=Emo fans defend their music against suicide claims |url=https://www.nme.com/news/my-chemical-romance/36480 |website=NME}}</ref> My Chemical Romance reacted online to the suicide of Hannah Bond: "We have recently learned of the suicide and tragic loss of Hannah Bond. We'd like to send our condolences to her family during this time of mourning. Our hearts and thoughts are with them".<ref name="nme2" /> The band also posted that they "are and always have been vocally anti-violence and anti-suicide".<ref name="nme2">{{Cite web |date=May 25, 2008 |title=My Chemical Romance speak about 'emo' suicide |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/my-chemical-romance-110-1321591 |website=[[NME]]}}</ref>

===Backlash===
Emo received a lot of backlash during the 2000s. Some emo bands, such as Panic! at the Disco<ref>{{Cite web |date=2006-10-18 |title=Panic! At The Disco declare emo "Bullshit!"
