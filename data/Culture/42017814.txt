[[File:Islam_Begu_Bridge2.jpg|thumb|300xpx|Old image of Gjakova]]

[[Gjakova]] has been populated since the prehistoric era. During the medieval period, in 1485, Gjakova is mentioned as a village, concretely as a market place.<ref name="GjakovaCity">{{cite book|title=Gjakova City & Valbona Valley|year=2010|location=Gjakova|isbn=978-9951-8784-0-1}}</ref> 
<br/>Gjakova served as a trading center on the route between [[Shkodër]] and [[Istanbul]].

The old town of Gjakova was one of the most developed trade centers during the rule of the Ottoman Empire in [[Balkans]]. A testimony to this period is the Grand Shopping area (çarshia e madhe) located in the center of the old town, containing many preserved and restored shops and residential buildings. Shopping was developed around the Hadum Mosque, built in 1594-95 as a donation by Hadum Sylejman Efendia (known as Hadum Aga), who simultaneously donated funds for other public facilities in the town, including some of the first shops in the old marketplace.

Gjakova is mentioned as a city for the first time in 1662, by the Ottoman Turkish traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]], who described it as a flourishing and attractive town consisting of 2,000 houses, all built of stone with roofs and gardens.  
Public buildings were suited on a broad plain and included two richly adorned Congregational mosques, several prayer-houses, some khans with leaden roofs, a delightful bathhouse, and about 300 shops like nightingale-nests.<ref>{{cite book|last=Elsie|first=Robert|title=Historical dictionary of Kosova|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=4501 Forbes Boulevard, Suite 200, Lanham, Maryland 20706|isbn=0-8108-5309-4}}</ref>

The forms of denominating the city had changed during the centuries. The oldest form "Jakova" originates from the base "Jak" anthroponym dispersed among vendor Albanians and the Ottoman suffix "ovasi" that means a field. Therefore, "Jak ovasi" means Jak’s field, because Jak Vula, according to the tradition, allowed Hadum Aga to build the mosque and the above-mentioned objects with the condition that the city to be built would carry his name.<ref name="GjakovaCity" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Kuvendi i Gjakovës|title=Toponimia e Gjakovës me rrethinë}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Haxhibeqiri|first=Fuat|title=Krimet e luftes në Gjakovë.|year=2011|location=Gjakovë|isbn=978-9951-585-85-9}}</ref>

==Religion==
In the 16th century there were only 13 Islamic families, out of 68 families that lived in Gjakova.<ref name="HadumMosque">{{cite book|last=Drançolli|first=Fejaz|title=Hadum Mosque & Bazaar in Gjakova|year=2007}}</ref> 
<br />According to the demographic statistics of 2011, the prominent religion is Islam, including 81,75% of the population, while 17,23% is Christian, 0.02% Orthodox and 1% other.<ref>{{cite web|title=Te dhenat kryesore demografike sipas komunave|url=http://esk.rks-gov.net/rekos2011/repository/docs/Te%20dhenat%20kryesore%20demografike%20sipas%20komunave.pdf|access-date=28 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102081033/http://esk.rks-gov.net/rekos2011/repository/docs/Te%20dhenat%20kryesore%20demografike%20sipas%20komunave.pdf|archive-date=2 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> 
<br />
This is a result of the process of Islamization that occurred during the Ottoman Rule.
Most Catholics live in the "Rruga e Katolikëve" street, where the two main churches are, and others in villages. The Muslims, living in other parts of the city and in most villages, have been encouraging the building of mosques, which could have counted about 10-15 buildings during the centuries. The religious monuments enrich the cultural heritage of Gjakova.<ref name="GjakovaCity" /><ref name="TouristGuide">{{cite book|title=Gjakova, Tourist Guide|isbn=978-9951-19-058-9}}</ref>

Most of them are religious monuments, but Gjakova is also known for some other interesting monuments, such as: stone houses (kulla), strong stone bridges and Old Bazaar, as an urban, architectural and traditional handicrafts entirety.<ref name="GjakovaCity" /><ref name="GrandBazaar">{{cite book|last=Rizvanolli|first=Masar|title=Grand Bazaar of Gjakova|year=2009|publisher="Jakova" - Intellectual Association|isbn=978-9951-8653-9-5}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">Mehmeti, Donat, Gjakova the city of ancient culture and heritage, Unicef: Innovations Lab Kosovo and Pen publishing</ref>

The '''historical monuments in Gjakova''', western [[Kosovo]], are divided into three main categories based on their [[cultural]], [[religious]], and social context. In 1574, the [[Hadum Mosque]] was built on Jak Vula's property, laying the foundation of the city. The core part of the town was created between the Krena River to the east and Cabrati hill to the west. Around the cornerstone of the town, the [[Old Bazaar, Gjakova|Old Bazaar]], the center of trade and [[craftsmanship]], was created. By 1900, the bazaar housed around 1,000 [[business]]es. Numerous bridges were built to enable trade caravans to cross the neighboring rivers. With the fast development of trade in the city, several inns were built to host visitors. Because of its ancient origins, and rapid economic development, Gjakova is of historical importance.<ref name=ChwB>{{cite web|title=Integrated Conservation |url=http://chwbkosovo.org/ |publisher=Cultural Heritage without Borders |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228150056/http://chwbkosovo.org/ |archivedate=2014-02-28 }}</ref>

The [[Bektashi Tekke, Gjakova|Bektashi Tekke]] was built in 1790 at the heart of the Big Bazaar complex in Gjakove. Being the first of its kind, this Tekke represented the Tarikat Bektashi. According to legend, the [[Tarikat]] Bekatshi was created by Haxhi Bektash Veliu in [[Anatolia|Anadolu]] during the thirteenth century. As the Ottoman Empire started to expand, a mission of this Muslim sect arrived from Anadolu in [[Balkans]], [[Crete]], and [[Greece]]. In Gjakova, the Bektashi Tekke was destroyed by the Serbian military forces during the Kosovo War in 1999. Thousands of books, including fifty-eight manuscripts, were burned, as the whole structure was destroyed. The Bektashi Tekke was reconstructed between 2004 and 2006 so that believers would be able to perform their spiritual rituals.<ref name="Instituti"/> It is characterized by the ringing bell, by the courtyard door, which announces another crowd of visitors who share the same Muslim belief has arrived. The graves of seven out of nine Bektashi fathers who served here from the seventeenth century are located in the right temple of the Tekke, while two others were buried in Turkey. These seven graves are considered to be sacred, meaning that they give direction to people to find the path towards God and they help people challenge their difficulties in life. The Bektashi carry their own specific Islamic ideas, indicating the diversity of beliefs in Kosovo and the prevalence of the religious tolerance.<ref name=DW>{{cite web|last=Beqiraj|first=Ajete|title=Teqja bektashiane hap sërish dyert për besimtarët nga mbarë bota|url=http://www.dw.de/teqja-bektashiane-hap-s%C3%ABrish-dyert-p%C3%ABr-besimtar%C3%ABt-nga-mbar%C3%AB-bota/a-2750724|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}</ref>

The black and white metal combination, crafting method, was called as  "Gjakova style" that differed from the "Prizren and Pehja style" (filigree and grain respectively). This style of craftsmanship was used in the production of rings, tobacco cases/boxes, tobacco pipes, etc. Up until now the method of this style was kept secret by gjakovars.

The artistic work of silversmiths were praised not only from the native population but also from the foreign countries that made them famous.

From the products for personal decoration of Gjakovar silversmiths we can mention: rings, earnings, bracelets, {{lang|sq|tasfes}} (bowl-shape decorative hats for women), etc. that were utilized from the richest families of the country and also exported to Istanbul.

*'''Tailors ("Terzinjtë")'''
The yearbook of the Prizren vilajet (manuscript) of the year 1874, mentions the vast number of tailors ("terzi"), Currier work ("tabak") and the embroidery work ("gajtanxhi/kazaz"). In Gjakova the tailors were divided in categories according to their society ranks. The first category i.e. worked for the richest ranks of the city with selected imported fabrics, which were sold with higher prices. Tailors worked costumes and outfits with high artistic values. The clothing was embroidered with silken, golden and silver threads. The work of national clothing for women and men that were ornamented with authentic elements had the advantage of tailoring products. "The esnaf" of gjakovar tailors was the most powerful leader and owned two-hundred shops, that were constantly working.

*'''Curriers ("Tabakët")'''
In Gjakova a vast number of various crafts were developed, feature this that can be supported by a great number of shops in "Çarshia e Madhe" (Old Bazaar), which according to a report given by Myller in 1838, "consisted of 1100 shops that almost all of them are filled with various goods". From this variety of crafts one can mention the Currier "tabakët" only, the producers of white and black leather.

Gjakova is a city rich with water sources that presented an important precondition for organizing the workshops for the Currier.

At the second half of the 19th century, in Gjakova there were sixty Currier workshop where large quantities of leather types such as soft "Saftjan" and durable "qoselea" were produced.

*'''Woolen white hat ("Qeleshe") craft'''

From the wool products, Gjakova was known for the white woolen hats, called "qeleshe". These craftsmen were very popular from the establishment of the Old Bazaar because these hats were an essential part of the Albanian national clothing. It is known that the type of white round cap similar to nowadays white hat called "plis" presents a part of our [[Illyria]]n ancestor's clothing. Albanians that took part in Kosovo War, in 1389, according to the fable, wore white round hats as current ones. Besides this, the type of cap that is called the [[Skanderbeg]] grave tells us the heritage of the Albanian "qeleshe". Gjakova was the only center of this craft where afterwards was disseminated to other Kosovo regions, such as in Northern Albania, [[Western Macedonia]], in Sanxhak, etc.

There are various techniques for producing the "Qeleshe" woolen white hats. The oldest way, used until the end of the 19th century with one balding, was called "the gjakovar way", which differs from the more sophisticated methods of "Tirana way" with uses +two balding. The latter technique was later used in Gjakova as well. Gjakova Craftsmen Chamber before the Second World War had registered 16 shops that produces these hats, than afterwards in 1963 increased to 19 of them. This craft continues to exist.

*'''Wool and silk processing'''
From the 18th and especially in the 19th century, besides metal processing the craft of wool and silk processing went through as well. In the Old Bazaar of Gjakova were produced and sold in wholesale: felts, silken and woolen fabrics, woolen and silken lacing, etc. that were exported continuously to bigger quantities at the markets and fairs of the neighboring provinces of the Balkans, Mediterranean and those of the [[Central Europe]]an Countries.<ref name="GjakovaCity" /><ref name="TouristGuide" /><ref name="GrandBazaar" />

*'''Embroidery work ("Kazazët")'''
Another craft linked closely with the one of tailoring was the one of embroidery ("kazaz") that was characteristic for [[Gjakova]]'s craftsmanship. Silk was also produced, which were used to make weaved fabrics linen and fine elegant shirts. Gjakova embroiders were very known for the quality of their luxury products that were sent to markets of [[Prishtina]], [[Skopje]], [[Manastir]], etc.

It is said that in Gjakova there were about 150 shops for silk and embroidery production.

*'''Cauldron work'''
From other crafts on metal processing, in Gjakova there was also developed the craft of cauldron-work, which developed enormously in the city center. Gjakovar cauldron-workers went all over to sell their products, competing successfully with other craftsmen of this workmanship.

*'''Carpenters'''
At the small side streets beyond the complex of Hadum Mosque crowded shops of many craftsmen were also located. Therefore, at the first side street beyond the mosque that today is called the case box workers street ("Rruga e kutixhinjëve"), there were many shops of woodworkers, which worked extraordinary decorative wood case boxes, cupboards, distaffs, ornamented jewelry boxes, coffee cases boxes, cradles and hammocks for children, kneading troughs, low round dining tables, school desks, folding chairs for reading, bookcase, stairs, etc.

*'''Saddlers'''
The leather production gave impetus also to the development of the craft of furrier (leather worker), craft of leather processing. The leather workers produced saddles as the most precious articles, ornamented with silver, colorful and metal decorations. In [[Shkodra]], Gjakova and [[Manastir]], according to Myller, saddles were produced, which differed from the others, because rear and front parts were more lifted. ref

The craft of the Currier and leather production contributed to development of another craft saddlers, the craftsmanship for processing the leather. Saddlers produced bags for tobacco and money, pushes, wallets, purses, arm belts, saddles, curbs, bits, girdles and other products necessary for equipping animal transport and loading. ref

The leather workers, same as tanners and slipper makers, used to sell their products locally and abroad. However, around the end of the 19th century the value of these crafts started to diminish.

*'''Tobacco pipe craft'''

Gjakova was known in all the [[Metohija|Dukagjini Region]] more for the development of the tobacco pipe craft called "Çibukxhinjtë". This craft existed in Gjakova up to second half of the 20th century.

Tobacco pipe craftsmen worked on producing the tobacco pipes, jackets, calumets and various cutty pipes. The Dema brothers had their shops until the end of the 19th century, while the family of Zejnullah Ramadani, kept the shop until around 1958.

The raw material that was used for producing the tobacco pipes, jackets, calumets and various cutty pipes was wood and horns, different from what they used in the past such as ivory and bones.

In the past this craft was carried out also by silversmiths, who took care particularly of decoration of long pipes (chibouks, "çibuk") and weavers, who wove with silky gallons, parts of the smoking set.

*'''Bookbinders'''
[[File:Gjakova's_cradle.jpg|sub|thumb | x225px | Cradle made in Gjakova]]
Another interesting craft, it seems, only for Gjakova, was the bookbinders craft (muxhelitët), who in their workshops, dealt with the binding of different books and manuscripts, with mending-repairing of old books damaged by long usage, or of any other physical damage and, above all, they dealt with copying of works of different authors, which they then distributed to libraries, or gave as gifts to their friends or to well-known scholars. They were usually people who had good handwriting.

Their work tools were usually made of wood by the bookbinders themselves.

This craft was practiced traditionally in Gjakova, from generation to generation, by the members of Doli family until recently. In the second half of the 19th century, Bajram Jusuf Doli was mentioned in regarding the craft of the bookbinder. There are over one hundred manuscripts that are kept in different collections in Kosova, which have been copied and bound by Bajram Doli. There are also some other famous bookbinders, such as: Mullah Bajram Efendi Doli, Mullah Hamdi Efendi Doli, [[Tahir Efendi Boshnjaku]], Muhamed Tahir Jaka, etc.

*'''Other crafts'''
Other well-known crafts of Gjakova are barbers, drugstores, soap work, farriers, potters, quilt work, clog work, watchmakers, millers, smiths, butchers, cart work, chest workers, and confectionery. According to some statistics of the beginning of the 20th century in Gjakova there were up to 400 crafts.<ref name="GjakovaCity" /><ref name="GrandBazaar" />

==The "Esnaf"==
From the crosscut sources and from the verbal declarations of the head [[esnaf]]s or its members, we learn that |in Gjakova the [[esnaf]] saved their function and authority up to late, up to the third decade of the 20th century. Therefore, from the declarations of the tailors head [[esnaf]], Mr. Ahmet Domi, on 21 June 1924, we learn that this [[esnaf]] with humanitarian aid collected from its members and other charitable people, bought shops, fields, valleys, etc., and from their benefits helped the poor members of the esnae and other people in need. With this income they built a bridge above the stream, called the Terzi Bridge, that is 120m long.

Besides many other functions, craftsmen were also known for their humanitarian activities, such as helping the poor, the ill and disabled people. The most known craftsman, was the head-craft of the tailors, who dispersed to their members and the poor ones, food aid, built public buildings, fountains, bridges, etc.

Gjakova belonged to the cities, which during the 18th and 19th centuries, used the weakness and anarchy, which covered the Ottoman Empire and its administrative system, by empowering the power of [[esnaf]]s in the Bazaar up to the level of non-defying the local governmental authority or the influence of "bejlers" (person of higher rank). The bound of craftsmen to [[esnaf]]s and the rigorous respecting of their rules saved the trade development to the Grand Bazaar and the beginning of the 20th century, when, from the lack of authority of the state government, the [[esnaf]]s kept the order and peace with power of weapons.

At the head of the [[Esnaf]] the best master craftsmen were chosen, so called more "esnafli".
Therefore, the power of the head if the esnaf, that in Gjakova was called "Qehaja", was very big. In Gjakova the head of the esnaf carried a special stick or cane, which was the sign of the authority that he had. This cane he used as a signal for closing a shop of a craftsman, which broke the rules of the esnaf. There were case when he ordered the closure of one shop for limited time, for three, six months or for a year. But there were also cases when the head of the esnaf closed the shop good and recessed the owner from the esnaf forever. At the 19th century in Gjakova it is mentioned the most known head of the esnaf of the tailors, Latif Gjuza.<ref name="GjakovaCity" /><ref name="TouristGuide" /><ref name="GrandBazaar" />

==Traditional clothes==
 [[File:Kostume_popullore_-_Flickr_-_Shkumbin_(3).jpg|thumb|350px|Traditional Clothes - Gjakova]]
Albanian folk costumes in Kosovo differ from one place to another, according to the age, and purpose, such as those used in a solemn act with the ones in ritual acts. They are all linked with the customs code itself and to a certain degree they are subject to different cultures identifying therewith the culture of those who lived in those regions. This is typical also for other Albanian regions. However, it is characteristic that this influence of foreign cultures has the strongest impact on ladies' costumes and quite a little on men’s wear. As in other ethno-cultural fields, there are different explanations in the sphere of tradition as a result of its outstretching and comparison of study. Province features differ gradually passing from one territory to another. Brilliant works from Gjakova are wanted and somehow used in every town.

The young brides worked the folk costumes to have different feasts and events, in order to preserve the clothing tradition. This wear was replaced by modern wear receiving the denomination "Allafranga", ("in the western fashion"). However, for a long time the folk costumes continued to be worked out within household economies by the women themselves. Gjakova with its surroundings was known as a place of fabric production. The connection with bigger towns, such as Peja, Prizren, Prishtina, Mitrovica, resulted in many clothing materials, as well as special parts for waistcoats, socks, shorts being bought ready-made. The Dukagjini Plain has been the place where the traditional costume has been developed the most. This region of Kosovo, binding the northern part of Albania with the Gjakova Highland area, mainly Tropoja and including the Has are, has cultivated a tradition in costumes, being therefore in the first place.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gashi|first=Viktor|title=Ethnological Thesaurus|publisher=Dukagjini|location=Pejë|isbn=978-9951-19-003-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Rexha|first=redaktor Engjëll I.
