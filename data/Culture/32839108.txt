The discourses in philosophy regarding [[social relation]]. What [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] call "the principle of '''superficiality''' versus depth"<ref>E. R. Smith/D. M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (2007) p. 18-9</ref> has pervaded [[Western culture]] since at least the time of [[Plato]].<ref>[[Jacques Lacan]], ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (Penguin 1994) p. 71 and p. 112</ref>

==Historical sketch==

[[Socrates]] sought to convince his debaters to turn from the superficiality of a worldview based on the acceptance of convention to the examined life of philosophy,<ref>Kathryn A. Morgan, ''Myth and Philosophy from the pre-Socratics to Plato'' (2000) p. 229</ref> founded (as [[Plato]] at least considered) upon the underlying [[Theory of Forms|Ideas]]. For more than two millennia, there was in the Platonic wake a general valorisation of critical thought over the superficial subjectivity that refused deep analysis.<ref>M. R. Gladstein/C. M. Sicabarra, ''Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand'' (1999) p. 130</ref> The salon style of the [[Précieuses]] might for a time affect superficiality, and play with the possibility of treating serious topics in a light-hearted fashion;<ref>A. De Riencout, ''Sex and Power in History'' (1974) p. 268</ref> but the prevailing western consensus firmly rejected elements such as everyday chatter<ref>Catherine Cusset, ''No Tomorrow'' (1996) p. 74</ref> or the changing vagaries of fashion<ref>G. D. McCracken, ''Transformations'' (2008) p. 219</ref> as superficial distractions from a deeper reality.

==Modernist cross-currents==

By contrast, [[Nietzsche]] opened the modernist era with a self-conscious praise of superficiality: "What is required is to stop courageously at the surface, the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words, in the whole Olympus of appearance! Those Greeks were superficial – ''out of profundity''!".<ref>Quoted in Gregory Castle, ''The Blackwell Guide to Theory'' (OxfordLiteraryironic 2007) p.</ref>

His (still) preference for superficiality was however over-shadowed for most of the 20th century by [[modernism]]'s full subscription to the depth/surface model, and to the privileging of the former over the latter. [[Frederic Jameson]] has highlighted four main modernist versions of the belief in a ''deeper'' reality - Marxist, psychoanalytic, existential, and semiotic -  in each of which reality is understood to be concealed behind an inauthentic surface or façade.<ref>A. Bennett/N. Royle, ''An Introduction to Literature, Criticism and Theory'' (2004) p. 253-4</ref> Jameson contrast these models sharply with the lack of depth, the ahistoricity, the surface-focus and flatness of the postmodern consciousness, with its new [[cult]] of the image and the [[simulacrum]].<ref>M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 17 and p 193</ref>

==Postmodernism==

In the last third of the 20th century, [[Lyotard]] began challenging the Platonic view of a true meaning hidden behind surface as a ''theatrical'' world-view, insisting instead that sense manifestations had their own reality which necessarily impacted upon the purely verbal order of intelligibility.<ref>K. Chrome/J. Williams ed., ''The Lyotard Reader and Guide'' (2006) p. 24-8</ref> Similarly, [[deconstruction]] has increasingly sought to undo the depth/surface hierarchy, proposing in ironic style that superficiality is as deep as depth.<ref>Cusset, p. 87</ref> The result has been the call to abandon the idea that behind appearances there is any ultimate truth to be found;<ref>R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 135-6</ref> and in consequence the growing postmodern replacement of depth by surface, or by multiple surfaces.<ref>Fredric Jameson, ''Postmodernism'' (London 1991) p. 2 and p. 12</ref> 

That process of substitution was well under way by the 1990s, when notoriously "surface was depth",<ref>Michael Bracewell, ''The Nineties: when surface was depth'' (London 2003)</ref> and in the new millennium has led to a state of what has been called hypervisibility: everything is on view.<ref>Kim Toffoletti, ''Baudrillard Reframed'' (London 2011) p. 32</ref> In this new era of exposure<ref>L. Magid/A. Collier, ''Myspace'' (2007) p. 22</ref> we are all submerged in what the psychoanalyst Michael Parsons has called "the totalist world where there is a horror of inwardness; everything must be revealed".<ref>Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 85</ref>

If postmodernism's proponents welcomed the way a new transcendence of the surface /depth dichotomy allowed a fuller appreciation of the possibilities of the superficial<ref>Russell De Manning, ''Theology at the End of Culture'' (2005) p. 180</ref> - the surface consciousness of the now, as opposed to the depths of historical time<ref>E. D. Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (Princeton 1992) p. 188</ref> - critics like [[J. G. Ballard]] object that the end-product is a world of "laws without penalties, events without significance, a sun without shadows":<ref>J. G. Ballard, ''Millennium People'' (London 2003) p. 294</ref> of surface without depth. They see postmodern superficiality as a by-product of the [[false consciousness]] of global capitalism, where surface distractions, news, and entertainment supersaturate the [[zapping]] mind in such a way as to foreclose the possibility of envisioning any critical alternative.<ref>David Edwards, ''Burning All Illusions'' (1996) p. 194</ref>

==Therapy==

Almost all [[Depth psychology|depth psychologies]] defy the postmodern to value depth over surface - to aim, in [[David Cooper (psychiatrist)|David Cooper]]'s words, for "change from the depths of oneself upwards into the ''superficies'' of one's social appearance".<ref>David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 13</ref> Debates may rage over whether to ''begin'' analysis at the surface or by way of  deep interpretations,<ref>Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1997) p. 169</ref> but this is essentially a question of timing. Thus for example [[Jung]]ians would highlight at the start of therapy what they call the ''[[Persona (psychology)|persona-restoring]]'' phase as an effort to preserve superficiality, but would later optimally see the client moving from the surface to deeper emotion and creativity.<ref>David Sedgwick, ''Introduction to Jungian Psychotherapy'' (2006) p. 153</ref>

[[Fritz Perls]] by contrast maintained that "the simplicity of the [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt]] approach is that we pay attention to the obvious, to the utmost surface. We don't delve into a region which we don't know anything about, into the so-called 'unconscious{{'"}}.<ref>Frederick Perls, ''Gestalt Therapy Verbatim'' (1972) p. 57</ref> A similar focus on the superficial has fuelled much of the [[Freud Wars]] of [[late modernity]], in which, according to [[Jonathan Lear]], "the real object of attack - for which Freud is only a stalking-horse - is the very idea that humans have unconscious motivation".<ref>Jonathan Lear, in Parsons, p. 24</ref> Given a choice of surface or depth—"are we to see humans as having depth, layers of meaning which lie beneath the surface of their own understanding?"—he asks: "Or are we to take ourselves as transparent to ourselves...to ignore the complexity, depth and darkness of human life";<ref>Lear, in Parsons, p. 24-5</ref> the postmodern bias remains towards superficiality.

==Social processing==

[[Social psychology]] considers that in everyday life social processing veers between superficiality, where we rely on [[First impression (psychology)|first impressions]] and immediate judgements, and a deeper form of processing in which we seek to understand the other person more fully.<ref>Smith/Mackie, p. 18 and p. 92-3</ref> In the ordinary course of life, we necessarily take others at face-value,<ref>John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade''  (London 1972) p. 173</ref> and use [[ideal type]]s/[[stereotypes]] to guide our daily activities; while institutions too can rely on the superficial consensus of [[groupthink]]<ref>Smith/Mackie, p. 325</ref> to preclude deeper investigation.

Some circumstances however necessitate a shift from superficial to extensive processing. When things become serious, we must put more and deeper thought into understanding, leaving superficial judgements to cases where the stakes are low, not high.<ref>Smith/Mackie, p. 554</ref>

==In the media==
* Entertainer [[Bill Hicks]] often criticized [[consumerism]], superficiality, mediocrity, and banality within the media and [[popular culture]], describing them as oppressive tools of the ruling class, meant to "keep people stupid and apathetic."<ref>See [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8409129199157823217 "Bill Hicks on Austin Public Access"], October 24, 1993, via Vide.Google.com</ref>
* [[Web 2.0#Criticism|Web 2.0]] in particular is often seen as specifically fostering superficiality, replacing deep, measured analysis by noisy but unfiltered observation.<ref>Andrew Keen, ''The Cult of the Amateur'' (2008) p. 16 and p. 213</ref>
* [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley's]] novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' is his examination of American culture, particularly what he saw as its [[narcissism]], superficiality, and obsession with youth. [[Freud]] had similarly explored what was at the start of the 20th century a conventional contrast between the (historical) depth of Europe and the superficiality of America;<ref>Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. xxi</ref> but towards the century's close, another European, [[Baudrillard]], would return to the image of America as a shallow, cultureless desert, only to praise it in postmodern terms "because you are delivered from all depths there – a brilliant, mobile, superficial neutrality".<ref>Quoted in Stuart Sim ed., ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'' (London 2001) p. 194</ref>
* ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' has been analysed in terms of the movement from the superficiality of [[Elizabeth Bennet]]'s initially favourable appraisal of Whickham – her first impressions – to her deeper realisation of the value of Mr Darcy.<ref>Tony Tanner, 'Introduction', Jane Austen, ''Pride and Prejudice'' (Penguin 1972) p. 11-24</ref>
