The '''age-area hypothesis''' is a concept in [[cultural anthropology]] that [[culture|cultural traits]] tend to expand outward from their origin with time. Thus, the larger an area that a trait is found in, the older it is. 

The age-area hypothesis is controversial, and considered by some to be discredited.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2740657 Historical Inferences from Guttman Scales: The Return of Age-Area Magic?] Theodore D.
