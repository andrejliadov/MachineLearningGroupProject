'''Human interactions with fungi''' include both beneficial uses, whether practical or symbolic, and harmful interactions such as when fungi damage crops, timber, or food.

[[Yeasts]] have been used since ancient times to leaven bread and to [[fermentation|ferment]] [[beer]] and [[wine]]. More recently, [[Mold (fungus)|mould]] fungi have been exploited to create a wide range of industrial products, including [[enzyme]]s and [[drug]]s. [[Drug|Medicines]] based on fungi include [[antibiotic]]s, [[immunosuppressant]]s, [[statin]]s and many [[anti-cancer drugs]]. The yeast species ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is an important [[model organism]] in [[cell biology]]. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible [[mushroom]]s, including delicacies like the [[chanterelle]], [[cep (mushroom)|cep]], and [[truffle]], while [[edible mushroom|a few species are cultivated]]. [[Mold (fungus)|Mould]] fungi provide the [[umami|meaty (umami)]] flavour of fermented [[soybean]] products such as [[tempeh]], [[miso]] and [[soy sauce]], and contribute flavour and colour to [[blue cheese]]s including [[Roquefort]] and [[Stilton cheese|Stilton]]. Moulds also yield [[vegetarian]] [[meat substitute]]s like [[Quorn]]. Some fungi, especially the [[fly agaric]] and [[psilocybin mushroom]]s are used for the [[psychoactive drug]]s that they contain; these in particular are the focus of academic study in the field of [[ethnomycology]]. Fungi have appeared, too, from time to time, in literature and art.

Fungi create harm by [[food spoilage|spoiling food]], [[wood-decay fungi|destroying timber]], and by causing [[plant pathology#Fungi|diseases of crops]], [[Pathogenic fungus|livestock, and humans]]. Fungi, mainly moulds like ''[[Penicillium]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus]]'', spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause the majority of plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the [[Great Irish Famine]] of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by ''[[Phytophthora]]'', result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly the main cause of economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; [[Aspergillosis]] kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened [[immune system]]s.

==Context==

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].<ref name=MacionisGerber2011>{{cite book |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |oclc = 652430995}}</ref> This article describes the roles played by fungi in human culture.

=== Dyes ===
{{Main articles|Mushroom dye}}
Fungi are used as natural dyes. The mushrooms are crushed and placed in a non-reactive pot to simmer for as long as desired or until you achieve a desired depth of color. Mushrooms that can be used  without a mordant are called "substantive dyes", but in order to improve color and light fastness a mordant (metallic salts) can be used. Protein fibers, like wool and silk, quickly take the dye, but cotton, hemp and some synthetic fibers can be used too.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History and Art of Mushroom Dyes for Color - North American Mycological Association|url=https://namyco.org/history_mushrooms_for_color.php|website=namyco.org|access-date=2020-05-18}}</ref>

Many fungi have been used as [[folk medicine]]s around the world, including in [[Europe]] and in [[India]] where traditions are well documented. Some have been found to have useful active ingredients, though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. Ergot and various cereal smuts, such as ''[[Ustilago tritici]]'' (wheat grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with wheat flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example a slice of mouldy bread or mouldy wheat straw, with active ingredients [[patulin]] and other penicillin-like compounds.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vaidya |first1=J.

Fungi, especially moulds but also yeasts, are important agents of [[food spoilage]]. 
''[[Penicillium]]'' moulds cause soft rot such as of [[apple]]s, while ''[[Aspergillus]]'' moulds create patches on the surface of old bread, yoghurt and many other foods.

===Destruction of timber===
{{main|Wood-decay fungi}}

[[Saprotroph]]ic [[wood-decay fungi]] are the primary cause of [[decomposition]] of wood, causing billions of dollars of economic damage each year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Microorganisms causing decay in trees and wood |url=http://forestpathology.cfans.umn.edu/microbes.htm |publisher=University of Minnesota |accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref> Fungal decay, while useful in [[composting]], is destructive of [[timber]] exposed to the weather, and in the case of [[dry rot]] caused by ''[[Serpula lacrymans]]'', also of timbers in largely dry houses.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carey |first1=Janice |last2=Grant|first2=Colin |title=The Treatment of Dry Rot in Historic Buildings |url=http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/rot/rot.htm |publisher=Building Conservation|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref> Some wood-decay fungi such as the honey fungi, species of ''[[Armillaria]]'', are [[parasite]]s of living trees, attacking their roots and eventually killing them, and continuing to decompose the wood when they are dead. Honey fungus is a serious horticultural pest, as it can spread from tree to tree by long strap-shaped [[rhizomorph]]s in the soil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Honey fungus |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=180 |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref>
