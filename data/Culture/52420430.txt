A '''pre-game ceremony''' or '''pre-match ceremony''' is an on-field [[ceremony]] occurring before a sporting event. Such ceremonies may celebrate a past event, honour a retiring athlete, commemorate a deceased athlete, or promote a cause.<!-- this is not an exhaustive list -->

==Celebrating past events==
Ceremonies preceding a game may celebrate a past event, such as a team championship. Such ceremonies may include appearances from members from the championship team. For example, in the last weekend of May 2016, the [[New York Mets]] of [[Major League Baseball]] hosted a 30th anniversary celebration of the [[1986 World Series]] winning team.{{sfn|SportsNet New York|2016}} Among the invited participants were [[Davey Johnson]], the team's [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] in 1986, and all players of that team.{{sfn|SportsNet New York|2016}}

==Celebrating athletes==
A sport franchise may schedule a pre-game ceremony to celebrate the retirement of a popular long-successful athlete, to retire an athlete's [[uniform number]], to honour a deceased athlete, or to celebrate an athlete's accomplishments.{{sfn|Leonetti|Patskou|2020|loc=section 97}}

===Accomplishments===
A pre-game ceremony may be held to celebrate the accomplishments of an athlete. On 30 September 2017, the Kansas City Royals hosted a pre-game ceremony preceding their game against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] to celebrate [[Mike Moustakas]] setting a team record for [[home run]]s in one season.{{sfn|Torres|2017}}

Preceding the 11 December 2019 game in which the [[Toronto Raptors]] hosted the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], former Raptors player [[Kawhi Leonard]] was presented with a ring to celebrate the Raptors championship in the [[2018–19 NBA season|preceding NBA season]].{{sfn|The Sports Network|2019}}

===Death===
After the death of [[Miami Marlins]] pitcher [[José Fernández (pitcher)|José Fernández]] in a boating accident in September 2016, a [[Major League Baseball]] executive announced that all games scheduled for that day would be preceded by a pre-game [[moment of silence]] to commemorate Fernández.{{sfn|ESPN|September 2016}}

===Retirement===
In September 2014, the [[New York Yankees]] hosted a ceremony preceding a game against the [[Kansas City Royals]] for [[Derek Jeter]], who retired from baseball at the end of the [[2014 Major League Baseball season]]. The Yankees invited Jeter's [[extended family]], numerous members of Jeter's charity [[Turn 2 Foundation]], former teammates, Jeter's childhood idol [[Dave Winfield]], and other athletes including [[Reggie Jackson]], [[Cal Ripken Jr.]], and [[Michael Jordan]].{{sfn|Jaffe|2014}} The team even had astronauts on the [[International Space Station]] performing the "RE2PECT" cap tip.{{sfn|Jaffe|2014}} The latter part of the ceremony was used to present Jeter with gifts and a donation to his charity.{{sfn|Jaffe|2014}}

The [[Boston Red Sox]] held a 40-minute ceremony for [[David Ortiz]] preceding the final game of the team's [[2016 Boston Red Sox season|2016 season]] against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. Announced during the ceremony was that his [[uniform number]] 34 would be retired by the Red Sox during the [[2017 Boston Red Sox season|2017 season]].{{sfn|Lauber|2016}} Invited guests included the [[ President of the Dominican Republic]] [[Danilo Medina]], the [[Governor of Massachusetts]] [[Charlie Baker]], Boston mayor [[Marty Walsh (politician)|Marty Walsh]], and 24 teammates from the Boston Red Sox [[2004 World Series|2004]], [[2007 World Series|2007]], and [[2013 World Series]] championship teams of which he was a member.{{sfn|Lauber|2016}} He also received gifts, and the Red Sox Foundation and team owners donated $1 million to the David Ortiz Children's Fund.{{sfn|Lauber|2016}}

===Uniform number retirement===
On 27 November 2008, the [[Oshawa Generals]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] had a pre-game ceremony that lasted fifty minutes to retire the uniform number of [[Bobby Orr]], a player who "left an indelible imprint on the franchise".{{sfn|Campbell|2013|loc=Introduction}}{{ref|a}} Among attendees and speakers were [[Don Cherry]], former Generals teammate Ian Young, and [[Wren Blair]], the scout who signed him for the [[Boston Bruins]] of the [[National Hockey League]].{{sfn|Campbell|2013|loc=Introduction}}

==Opening ceremonies==
In 1889, the original [[Polo Grounds]] in New York City was demolished, and for part of the [[1889 New York Giants season|1889 season]], the [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] were a vagabond team playing in various stadiums (including [[Oakland Park (Jersey City, New Jersey)|Oakland Park]] and the St. George Cricket Grounds), until the New Polo Grounds was completed. On 8 July, the new stadium was opened with a pre-game [[opening ceremony]] featuring a [[military band]] and a number of politicians.{{sfn|Hawking|2012|p=126}}

==Advocacy==
Advocacy or promotion of charitable and non-profit programs may also be presented during pre-game ceremonies. For example, in November 2016 the [[Ottawa Senators]] held a ceremony to promote cancer research and patient care fundraising for [[The Ottawa Hospital]].{{sfn|Sportsnet|2016}}

==Politics==
Before the first game of the 1972 ice hockey [[Summit Series]] between Canada and the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Montreal]], a pre-game ceremony was held in which there was an exchange of gifts.{{sfn|Denault|2011|p=231}} Before the eighth and final game of the series in [[Moscow]], by which time there was a tense relationship between the Canadians and Soviets, the Canadian delegation had intended on presenting the Soviet team with a [[totem pole]] in a pre-game ceremony; the presentation was cancelled by the Soviets, but later restored.{{sfn|Sinden|1972|p=112}}{{sfn|Bregg|2012}}

After the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]], the [[New York Mets]] hosted their first game in [[New York City]] on 21 September, in which a pre-game ceremony included members of the [[New York Police Department]] and [[New York City Fire Department]], and featured [[Diana Ross]] singing "[[God Bless America]]" and a salute to the victims of the attacks and their families.{{sfn|Monahan|2010|p=163}} Members of the New York Police Department and New York City Fire Department were also present at the first game of the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]] following the attacks, on 23 September in [[Kansas City]].{{sfn|Monahan|2010|p=163}}

==Law==
Some pre-game ceremonies have been subject to legal challenges. Up to 1995, the [[Santa Fe Independent School District]] in [[Santa Fe, Texas|Santa Fe]], [[Texas]] had the student council chaplain, an elective student office position, recite a prayer over the stadium [[public address system]] preceding each [[American football|football]] game.{{sfn|Cotten|Wolohan|2003|p=528}} School representatives stated that because the same student recited the prayer throughout the year, it was protected as private speech by the [[Free Exercise Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].{{sfn|Cotten|Wolohan|2003|p=528}} In ''[[Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe]]'', the [[United States courts of appeals|Court of Appeal]] decision stated that the school policy was invalid because it violated the [[Establishment Clause]] of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Specifically, the school had not created a limited private forum for the prayer recital, and a majoritarian student body election to determine which activities are granted approval is "constitutionally problematic" since "minority candidates will never prevail".{{sfn|Cotten|Wolohan|2003|p=528}}
