'''Andreas Antonius Maria "Dries" van Agt''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈdris fɑn ˈɑxt|lang|NL-nl Dries van Agt.ogg}};<ref>''van'' in isolation: {{IPA-nl|vɑn|}}.</ref> born 2 February 1931) is a retired [[politics of the Netherlands|Dutch politician]] and diplomat of the defunct [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP) and later the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA) party and jurist who served as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] from 19 December 1977 until 4 November 1982.

Van Agt studied Law at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] obtaining a [[Master of Laws]] degree and worked as a [[criminal defense lawyer]] in Eindhoven from September 1955 until December 1957 and as a civil servant at the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality|Ministries of Agriculture and Fisheries]] and [[Ministry of Justice and Security|Justice]] from December 1957 until January 1968. Van Agt worked as a professor of [[Criminal law]] and [[Criminal procedure]] at his alma mater from January 1968 until July 1971 and served as a judge at the district court of [[Arnhem]] from April 1970 until May 1971. After the [[1971 Dutch general election|election of 1971]] Van Agt was appointed as [[List of Ministers of Justice of the Netherlands|Minister of Justice]] in the [[First Biesheuvel cabinet|Cabinet Biesheuvel I]] and taking office on 6 July 1971. Van Agt was elected as a [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|Member of the House of Representatives]] after the [[1972 Dutch general election|election of 1972]] serving from on 23 January 1973 until 22 April 1973. Following the [[Dutch cabinet formation|cabinet formation of 1973]] Van Agt continued as Minister of Justice in the [[Den Uyl cabinet|Cabinet Den Uyl]] and also became [[Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Deputy Prime Minister]] taking office on 11 May 1973. On 10 December 1976 Van Agt was selected as the first [[Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal|Leader]] and ''[[Lijsttrekker]]'' (top candidate) of the newly formed Christian Democratic Appeal for the [[1977 Dutch general election|election of 1977]]. After the [[1977 Dutch general election|election]] Van Agt returned as a Member of the House of Representatives and became the [[Parliamentary leader]] taking office on 8 June 1977 and subsequently resigned from the cabinet on 8 September 1977. Following a successful [[Dutch cabinet formation|cabinet formation]] with [[Leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy|Liberal Leader]] [[Hans Wiegel]] Van Agt formed the [[First Van Agt cabinet|Cabinet Van Agt I]] and became [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] taking office 19 December 1977.

For the [[1981 Dutch general election|election of 1981]] Van Agt again served as ''Lijsttrekker'' and following a [[Dutch cabinet formation|cabinet formation]] with his predecessor as Prime Minister [[Leader of the Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Leader]] [[Joop den Uyl]] formed the [[Second Van Agt cabinet|Cabinet Van Agt II]] and continued as Prime Minister for a second term. The cabinet fell just seven months into its term and was replaced with the [[Caretaker government|caretaker]] [[Third Van Agt cabinet|Cabinet Van Agt III]] with Van Agt continuing as Prime Minister and also serving as [[List of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] taking office on 29 May 1982. For the [[1982 Dutch general election|election of 1982]] Van Agt once again served as ''Lijsttrekker'' but shortly thereafter unexpectedly announced he was stepping down as Leader and that he wouldn't serve another term as Prime Minister. Van Agt left office following the installation of the [[First Lubbers cabinet|Cabinet Lubbers I]] on 4 November 1982 but continued to serve in the House of Representatives as a [[backbencher]].

Van Agt continued to be active in politics and in May 1983 was nominated as the next [[List of King's and Queen's Commissioners of North Brabant|Queen's Commissioner of North Brabant]] taking office on 1 June 1983. In December 1986 Van Agt was appointed as [[List of diplomatic missions of the European Union|Ambassador of the European Union to Japan]] serving from 1 January 1987 until 1 January 1990 when he named as [[Delegation of the European Union to the United States|Ambassador of the European Union to the United States]] serving until 1 April 1995. Van Agt retired from active politics at 64 and became active in the [[public sector]] as a non-profit director and served on several [[:nl:Staatscommissie|state commissions]] and councils on behalf of the government, he also served as a distinguished visiting professor of [[International relations]], [[Peace and conflict studies]] and Governmental studies at the [[United Nations University]], [[Kwansei Gakuin University]], [[Kyoto University]] and [[Ritsumeikan University]] from February 1996 until May 2004. Following his retirement Van Agt continued to be active public sector and worked as an advocate, lobbyist and activist for the [[Anti-war movement]], Human Rights and the [[Two-State solution]] in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].

Van Agt was known for his abilities as a skillful [[Debate]]r and [[Negotiation|negotiator]]. During his premiership, his cabinets were responsible for several major [[public sector]] and civil service reforms and further reducing the [[Government budget balance|deficit]] following the [[Early 1980s recession|recession in the 1980s]]. Van Agt continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until he suffered a major [[Intracranial hemorrhage|stroke]] in May 2019 which forced him to undergo rehabilitation. He holds the distinction as the [[List of Prime Ministers of the Netherlands by age|oldest living and earliest serving former Prime Minister]] following the death of [[Piet de Jong]] in July 2016 and his premiership is consistently [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the Netherlands|considered]] both by scholars and the public to have been average.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/nieuws/2006/januari/Willem-Drees-gekozen-tot-D-premier-na-WO-II.html Willem Drees gekozen tot ‘Dé premier na WO II’], Geschiedenis24.nl, 15 January 2006</ref><ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2013/09/28/nrc-enquete-drees-en-lubbers-beste-premiers-sinds-1900/ NRC-enquête: Drees en Lubbers beste premiers sinds 1900], NRC Handelsblad, 28 September 2013</ref><ref>{{in lang|nl}} [https://www.ioresearch.nl/actueel/mark-rutte-gezien-als-beste-premier-sinds-woii/ I&O Research], I&O Research, 13 March 2020</ref><ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.absolutefacts.nl/politiek/data/agtdriesvan1931.htm Dries van Agt (1931)], Absolutefacts.nl, 10 December 2008</ref>

==Early life==
Andreas Antonius Maria van Agt was born on 2 February 1931 in [[Geldrop]] in the [[Provinces of the Netherlands|Netherlands Province]] of [[North Brabant]] in a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] family. After receiving his diploma Gymnasium-A at the [[Scholengemeenschap Augustinianum|Augustinianum]] he studied at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen|Catholic University of Nijmegen]], where he received his Doctorate in Law in 1955. After graduating, he practiced law in Eindhoven until 1957, after which he worked in the office of legal and business affairs of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries until 1962. From 1962 to 1968, he worked for the Ministry of Justice.

Van Agt entered politics as a member of the [[Catholic People's Party]], which merged with the other two major Christian Democratic parties in 1980 to form the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] (CDA). From 1968 to 1971, Van Agt was Professor of Criminal Law at the Catholic University of Nijmegen. From 1971 to 1973, he was Minister of Justice in the government of [[Barend Biesheuvel]]. He caused outrage when he tried to pardon [[Willy Lages|the last three Nazi war criminals still in Dutch prisons]] in 1972. From 1973 to 1977 he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice in the government of [[Joop den Uyl]].

===Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal===
In 1976, Van Agt was elected the first [[Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal]], then still a federation of the three religious parties [[Christian Historical Union]], [[Catholic People's Party]] and [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]], which first ran in 1977 with a united list (the merger followed in 1980). With Van Agt as top candidate, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] reversed in 1977 years of decline to return to power.

===Prime Minister in the Cabinet Van Agt I===
In the parliamentary elections of May 1977 the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] obtained their largest number of seats, so a second Den Uyl coalition looked likely. However, the tension between the [[Catholic People's Party]] and the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] in the last reign, combined with the fact that a coalition between [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] and the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] was possible, the talks failed after a period of seven months. Eventually Van Agt negotiated a deal with [[Hans Wiegel]], leader of the [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]]. From 19 December 1977 to 11 September 1981 Van Agt was Prime Minister of the Netherlands and Minister of General Affairs in the Cabinet Van Agt I.

===Prime Minister in the Cabinet Van Agt II===
In 1981, the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] and [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] lost parliamentary seats, so a continuation of a [[Christian Democratic Appeal]]-[[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] coalition was not possible. Van Agt, leader of the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]], was forced to go in coalition with the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]]. Also [[Democrats 66]] (which, under Jan Terlouw gained a significant number of seats) participated in the coalition talks, after 3 months of difficult negotiations that resulted in the Cabinet Van Agt II (11 September 1981 – 29 May 1982). In this composition Van Agt worked with Joop den Uyl again as Den Uyl was made Deputy Prime Minister and "super minister" of Social Affairs and Employment. The characterological and political differences led to several divisions, and in May 1982 the government fell.

The personal strife between Van Agt and Den Uyl were so deteriorated that when Den Uyl died from a [[brain tumor]] in 1987, Van Agt was not invited to the memorial by the family. Den Uyl's wife Liesbeth argued that Van Agt had prevented the second Den Uyl coalition from forming in 1977.

===Prime Minister in the Cabinet Van Agt III===
The caretaker government went through as a minority cabinet, with only ministers from the parties [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] and [[Democrats 66]], in the Cabinet Van Agt III. For replacing the six [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] ministers, five new [[Christian Democratic Appeal]] and [[Democrats 66]] ministers were in place, while van Agt in the cabinet, as well as being Prime Minister was also Minister of Foreign Affairs.

New parliamentary elections were organized for September 1982. Although Van Agt, by this point was worn out, he was persuaded again to be [[Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal]] but shortly after the election he withdrew as a candidate for prime minister and was succeeded by Ruud Lubbers.

==After politics==
===Diplomat===
Dries van Agt served as Ambassador of the [[European Community]] to Japan from 1987 to 1990 and to the United States from 1990 to 1995. From 1995 to 1996, he was a Visiting Professor of International Relations at the [[University of Kyoto]].

===Professor===
He is currently Prime Counsellor for the [[International Forum for Justice and Peace]], a foundation under Dutch law, registered at the Chamber of Commerce in [[Amsterdam]]. Chaired by retired international businessman [[Ben Smoes]], they are currently focused on justice and peace in regard to the Israel/Palestine conflict

===Activist===
Van Agt lectured in May 2006 in Cairo at the invitation of the Egyptian electronic magazine [[Arab-West Report]] about great changes in the cultural climate of north-western Europe in the past decades, becoming more hostile to religion, including Islam. Muslims, he argued, need to understand those changes to be able to respond better to European criticism on Islam and the Muslim world.<ref>For the full text of his lecture, entitled, "Cultures between Clash and Reconciliation: The Role of the Media and Academia," see AWR, 2006, week 53, art. 3</ref>

Van Agt has also spoken against the Council of State in Egypt for continuous delay in granting the [[Center for Arab-West Understanding]] (CAWU) the NGO status. He met with prominent figures in Egypt to persuade them to do so. The Egyptian Council of State, after van Agt's visit to Cairo in 2006, ruled on 18 February 2007 that the center should be recognized as an NGO under Egyptian law, ending its three-year struggle to obtain this status. Egypt is known for its reluctance in granting NGO status to discourage political participation. [[Cornelis Hulsman]], a Dutch sociologist, the editor-in-chief of Arab-West Report, and the head of CAWU, stated that van Agt's effort significantly impacted the realization of their goals, which usually requires a lengthy amount of time and scrutiny in its political purposes.

For some years he has taken an outspoken stance regarding the Middle East, resulting in a fierce criticism of the policies undertaken by the government of Israel with regard to the Palestinians. When in office, van Agt was a staunch supporter of Israel, but after he stepped down in 1982 he changed his mind.<ref>[http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/former-dutch-pm-champions-palestinian-cause "Former Dutch PM champions Palestinian cause"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213154915/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/former-dutch-pm-champions-palestinian-cause |date=13 December 2009 }}, ''[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]'' (10 December 2009).</ref> According to his own words an important turning point was a visit at the late nineties at [[Bethlehem University]] on the Israeli-occupied West Bank.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://www.driesvanagt.nl/p_mijnpublicaties009.pdf "De bekering van Dries van Agt"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019203328/http://www.driesvanagt.nl/p_mijnpublicaties009.pdf |date=19 October 2013 }}, HP|DE TIJD, 29 September 2006</ref><ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://archief.nrc.nl/?modus=l&text=Ik+kan+het+wel+uitschreeuwen&hit=7&set=2&check=Y "Ik kan het wel uitschreeuwen"], interview oud-premier Dries van Agt, NRC Handelsblad, 22 August 2009</ref> He has accused Israel of "[[state terrorism]]" and turning the Palestinian Authority territories into "[[bantustan]]s".<ref>Cnaan Liphshiz, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/dutch-jimmy-carter-accuses-israel-of-terrorism-in-new-book-1.248633 'Dutch Jimmy Carter' accuses Israel of terrorism in new book] ''[[Haaretz]]'' (27 June 2008).</ref> In 2012, Van Agt said that Jews should have a state in Germany instead of Israel.<ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/former-dutch-pm-jews-shouldve-had-a-state-in-germany Former Dutch PM: Jews should have had a state in Germany], ''[[The Times of Israel]]'' (11 November 2012).</ref> In September 2016, in reference to the visit of [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Benjamin Netenyahu]] to the Netherlands, van Agt argued that the ongoing Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and the building of [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] there constituted a [[war crime]] under the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] and suggested that Netenyahu should have been sent to the [[International Criminal Court]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/former-dutch-pm-dries-van-agt-benjamin-netanyahu-war-criminal-tried-the-hague-a7228566.html |title=Former Dutch PM calls Benjamin Netanyahu a ‘war criminal’ who should be tried in The Hague |last1=Cockburn |first1=Harry |date=6 September 2016 |website=[[independent.co.uk]]|access-date=27 September 2016}}</ref> According to former speaker of [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|the House of Representatives]], [[Gerdi Verbeet]], Van Agts remarks must be seen in the context of declining capabilities <ref>Brouwer, Bart.
