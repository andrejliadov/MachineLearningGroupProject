'''Vantablack''' is a material developed by Surrey NanoSystems in the [[United Kingdom]] and is one of the [[darkness|darkest]] substances known, [[Optical properties of carbon nanotubes|absorbing]] up to 99.965% of visible light (at 663&nbsp;nm if the light is perpendicular to the material).<ref name="NBCNews">{{cite web| url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/vantablack-u-k-firm-shows-worlds-darkest-material-n155581 |title=Vantablack: U.K. Firm Shows Off 'World's Darkest Material'| date=15 July 2014| website=NBCNews.com| access-date=19 July 2014}}</ref><ref>[[Guinness World Records]]: [https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/darkest-manmade-substance/ ''Darkest manmade substance''], [[Guinness World Records]] 19 October 2015</ref>

==Properties==
[[File:Vantablack 02.JPG|thumb|Vantablack grown on metal foil]]
Vantablack is composed of a forest of vertical tubes "grown" on a substrate using a modified [[chemical vapor deposition]] process. When light strikes Vantablack, instead of bouncing off, it becomes trapped and is continually deflected amongst the tubes, eventually becoming absorbed and dissipating into heat.<ref name="SCFP">{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1554903/vantablack-worlds-darkest-material-unveiled-uk-firm|title=Vantablack, the world's darkest material, is unveiled by UK|date=15 July 2014|website=South China Morning Post - World|access-date=19 July 2014}}</ref>

Vantablack was an improvement over similar substances developed at the time. Vantablack absorbs up to 99.965% of visible light and can be created at {{convert|400|C}}. [[NASA]] had previously developed a similar substance that was grown at {{convert|750|C}}, so it required materials to be more heat resistant than Vantablack.<ref name="SCFP" />

The [[outgassing]] and [[particulates|particle fallout]] levels of Vantablack are low, the high levels of which in similar substances in the past had limited their commercial utility. Vantablack also has greater resistance to [[mechanical vibration]], and has greater thermal stability.<ref name="YahooCa">{{cite web|url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/scientists-developed-black-deep-makes-3d-objects-look-233004466.html?pt=Array|title=Scientists have developed a black so deep it makes 3D objects look flat| author= Kuittinen, Tero  | date= 14 July 2014|website=Yahoo!

==Applications==
Being one of the darkest materials (though, there are darker materials: for example, in 2019, MIT has developed a material which reflects a tenth of the amount of light that Vantablack reflects<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2019/blackest-black-material-cnt-0913 |title=MIT engineers develop "blackest black" material to date &#124; MIT News |publisher=News.mit.edu |date=2019-09-12 |access-date=2020-08-04}}</ref>), this substance has many [[Potential applications of carbon nanotubes|potential applications]], including preventing [[stray light]] from entering telescopes, and improving the performance of [[infrared camera]]s both on Earth and in space.<ref name="HuffPost"/>

Vantablack may also increase the absorption of heat in materials used in [[concentrated solar power]] technology, as well as military applications such as [[thermal camouflage]]. Its [[emissivity]] and [[scalability]] support a wide range of applications.

In addition to directly growing aligned carbon nanotubes, Vantablack is made into two sprayable paints with randomly-oriented nanotubes, Vantablack S-VIS and Vantablack S-IR with better infrared absorption than the former. These paints require a special license, a temperature of 100–280&nbsp;°C, and vacuum post-processing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vantablack S-IR|url=https://www.surreynanosystems.com/super-black-coatings/vantablack-s-ir|website=Surrey NanoSystems|language=en}}</ref> Surrey NanoSystems also markets a line of non-nanotube sprayable paints known as Vantablack VBx that are even easier to apply.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vantablack VBx Coatings|url=https://www.surreynanosystems.com/super-black-coatings/vbx-coatings|website=Surrey NanoSystems|language=en}}</ref>

=== Artistic and decorative use ===

Vantablack S-VIS, a sprayable paint that uses randomly-aligned carbon nanotubes and only has high absorption in the [[visible light]] band, has been [[Exclusive license|exclusively licensed]] to [[Anish Kapoor]]'s studio for artistic use.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/story/vantablack-anish-kapoor-stuart-semple/|title=Art Fight!

Nanolab, a [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]-based carbon nanotube manufacturer, partnered with [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] artist Jason Chase to release a nanotube-based black paint called Singularity Black.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/395360/meet-singularity-black-the-blackest-paint-on-the-market/|title=Meet Singularity Black, the Blackest Paint on the Market|date=2017-08-11|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}</ref> During the first showing of the colour, Chase, alluding to Vantablack, stated that "its possibilities have been stunted by not being available to experiment with," and Singularity Black's release was important to create access.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2017/08/16/nanolab-releases-singularity-black-paint-rival-anish-kapoor-vantablack-design-news/|title=Nanolab releases own extremely black paint to rival Anish Kapoor's Vantablack|date=2017-08-16|work=Dezeen|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/vantablack-anish-kapoor-stuart-semple/|title=Art Fight!

The manufacturer claims that Vantablack is subject to [[export control]]s by the UK, and due to its physical requirements and thermal characteristics, the original Vantablack is not practical for use in many types of art.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.surreynanosystems.com/vantablack/faqs|title=FAQs|website=Surrey NanoSystems|language=en|access-date=2017-03-31}}</ref>
