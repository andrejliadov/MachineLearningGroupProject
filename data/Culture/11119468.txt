In fashion, a '''[[ballerina]] neckline''' refers to the classic necklines styles on the dance attire, or [[leotard]]s, worn by the dancers.

Popularized especially by designers and fashion icons of the mid-twentieth century, the term ballerina (or ballet) neckline can be construed in a variety of ways. Some classically styled or traditional [[leotard]]s have a low, wide, vertically scooped neckline and others are cut in a high horizontal oval shape. Both styles may be accompanied by a very low scooped back opening.

Most often, a ballerina neckline is a relatively high cut horizontal oval shape intended to frame the collarbone.  It is this particular oval shape that distinguishes the ballerina (or "ballet") neckline from a jewel neckline or a crew neck, which are round. Similar [[Neckline|neckline styles]] would be the bateau neckline (also known as a [[boat neck]]) and a scoop neck cut.

Currently, in the early 21st century, neckline styles on adult women's [[leotard]]s and children's [[leotard]]s include an array of variations on the classic necklines, including a front V-neck, front and back V-neck, or a sweetheart neckline with or without ruching at the bust.
