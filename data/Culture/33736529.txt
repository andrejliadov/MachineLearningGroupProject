'''Cotton recycling''' prevents unneeded wastage and can be a more [[sustainability|sustainable]] alternative to disposal. [[Recycled]] [[cotton]] can come from secondhand clothing or from textile waste or leftovers which are then spun into new yarns and fabrics. There are some notable limitations of recycled cotton, including separation of materials that are cotton/[[polyester]] mix.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21720200-global-clothing-production-doubled-between-2000-and-2014-looking-good-can-be|title=Looking good can be extremely bad for the planet|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-16}}</ref> There may also be limits to durability in using recycled cotton.

==Process==
[[Cotton]] can be [[recycling|recycled]] from pre-consumer (post-industrial) and post-consumer cotton waste. Pre-consumer waste comes from any excess material produced during the production of [[yarn]], fabrics and textile products, e.g. [[selvage]] from weaving and fabric remnants from factory cutting rooms. [[Post-consumer waste]] comes from discarded textile products, e.g. used apparel and home textiles. During the recycling process, the cotton waste is first sorted by type and color and then processed through stripping machines that break the yarns and fabric into smaller pieces before pulling them apart into fiber. The mix is [[Carding|carded]] several times in order to clean and mix the fibers before they are spun into new yarns.<ref name="textileexchange.org">{{cite web |url=http://textileexchange.org/node/958 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610020056/http://textileexchange.org/node/958 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 10, 2013 |title=Textile Exchange |accessdate=February 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://about.hm.com/en/sustainability/sustainable-fashion/materials/cotton.html|title=H&M group {{!}} Cotton|website=about.hm.com|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424223451/https://about.hm.com/en/sustainability/sustainable-fashion/materials/cotton.html|archive-date=April 24, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The resulting staple fiber is shorter than the original fiber length, meaning it is more difficult to spin. Recycled cotton is therefore often blended with virgin cotton fibers to improve yarn strengths.<ref name="textileexchange.org" /> Commonly, not more than 30% recycled cotton content is used in the finished yarn or fabric.

Because waste cotton is often already dyed, re-dyeing may not be necessary.<ref name="textileexchange.org" /> Cotton is an extremely resource-intense crop in terms of water, pesticides and insecticides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/about_freshwater/freshwater_problems/thirsty_crops/cotton/|title=Cotton Farming|work=panda.org}}</ref> This means that using recycled cotton can lead to significant savings of natural resources and reduce pollution from agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bir.org/industry/textiles/|title=- BIR â€“ Bureau of International Recycling|website=Bir.org|accessdate=2017-02-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190105000039/http://www.bir.org/industry/textiles|archive-date=2019-01-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> Recycling one tonne of cotton can save 765 cubic metres (202,000 US gal) of water.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Uses ==
Recycled cotton is often combined with [[recycled plastic]] [[plastic bottle|bottles]] to make clothing and textiles, creating sustainable, earth-conscious products. Recycled cotton can also be used in industrial settings as polishing and wiper cloths and can even be made into new, high-quality [[paper]]. When reduced to its fibrous state, cotton can be used for applications like seat stuffing or home and automotive insulation.<ref>{{cite web| title = eHow Style: Cotton Recycling Process}}</ref> It is also sold as recycled cotton yarn for consumers to create their own items.<ref>{{cite web| title = Lion Brand Yarn: Recycled Cotton Yarn| url = http://www.lionbrand.com/yarns/recycledcotton.html|website=Lionbrand.com | accessdate = 2012-03-23}}</ref> Additionally, cotton waste can be made into a stronger, more durable paper than traditional wood-pulp based paper, which may contain high concentration of acids. Cotton paper is often used for important documents and also for [[bank notes]] since it does not wear off as easily. Cotton waste can also be used to grow mushrooms (particularly the indoor cultivation of [[Volvariella volvacea]] otherwise known as Straw Mushrooms).<ref>{{cite web| title = Cultivation of Edible Mushrooms on Cotton Waste | url = http://fungus.org.uk/nwfg/volv.htm |website=Fungus.org.uk| accessdate = 2011-11-13}}</ref>

Even though recycling cotton cuts down on the harsh process of creating brand new cotton products, it is a natural fiber and is [[biodegradable]], so any cotton fibers that cannot be recycled or used further can be composted and will not take up space in landfills.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}
