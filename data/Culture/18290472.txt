'''Artificiality''' (the state of being '''artificial''' or '''man-made''') is the state of being the product of intentional human manufacture, rather than occurring [[nature|naturally]] through processes not involving or requiring human activity.

==Connotations==
Artificiality often carries with it the implication of being false, counterfeit, or deceptive. The philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote in his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'':

{{quote|Naturalness is persuasive, artificiality is the contrary; for our hearers are prejudiced and think we have some design against them, as if we were mixing their wines for them. It is like the difference between the quality of Theodorus' voice and the voices of all other actors: his really seems to be that of the character who is speaking, theirs do not.<ref>[[Aristotle]], ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', (2004, Dover Publications, W.D. Ross, translator), p. 121.</ref>}}

However, artificiality does not necessarily have a negative connotation, as it may also reflect the ability of humans to replicate forms or functions arising in nature, as with an [[artificial heart]] or [[artificial intelligence]]. Political scientist and artificial intelligence expert [[Herbert A. Simon]] observes that "some artificial things are imitations of things in nature, and the imitation may use either the same basic materials as those in the natural object or quite different materials.<ref name="Simon">[[Herbert A. Simon]], ''The Sciences of the Artificial'' (1996), p. 4.</ref> Simon distinguishes between the artificial and the synthetic, the former being an imitation of something found in nature (for example, an [[artificial sweetener]] which generates [[sweetness]] using a formula not found in nature), and the latter being a replication of something found in nature (for example, a [[sugar]] created in a laboratory that is chemically indistinguishable from a naturally occurring sugar).<ref name="Simon"/> Some philosophers have gone further and asserted that, in a [[Determinism|deterministic]] world, "everything is natural and nothing is artificial", because everything in the world (including everything made by humans) is a product of the physical laws of the world.<ref>Qinglai Sheng, ''Philosophical Papers'' (1993), p. 342.</ref>

==Distinguishing natural objects from artificial objects==

It is generally possible for humans, and in some instances, for computers,<ref>''See generally, E. P. Baltsavias, A. Gruen, L. VanGool, ''Automatic Extraction of Man-made Objects from Aerial and Space Images'', Volume 3 (2001).</ref> to distinguish natural from artificial environments. The artificial environment tends to have more physical regularity both spatially and over time, with natural environments tending to have both irregular structures and structures that change over time.<ref name="Kaken">Herman Kaken, "Recognition of Natural and Artificial Environments by Computers: Commonalities and Differences", in Juval Portugali, ''Complex Artificial Environments'' (2006), p. 31-48.</ref> However, on close observation it is possible to discern some mathematical structures and [[Patterns in nature|patterns in natural environments]], which can then be replicated to create an artificial environment with a more natural appearance.<ref name="Kaken"/>

For example, by identifying and imitating natural means of [[pattern formation]], some types of [[Finite state machine|automata]] have been used to generate organic-looking [[Texture (computer graphics)|textures]] for more realistic [[Shader|shading]] of [[3D modeling|3D objects]].<ref>Greg Turk, [http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/reaction_diffusion/reaction_diffusion.html Reaction–Diffusion]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Reaction–Diffusion Textures|author=Andrew Witkin, Michael Kassy|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aw/pdf/texture.pdf|doi=10.1145/122718.122750|journal=Proceedings of the 18th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques|year=1991|pages=299–308|isbn=0897914368|s2cid=207162368}}</ref>
