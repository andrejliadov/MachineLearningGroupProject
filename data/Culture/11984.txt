'''Gardening''' is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of [[horticulture]]. In gardens, [[ornamental plant]]s are often grown for their [[flower]]s, [[leaf|foliage]], or overall appearance; useful plants, such as [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]], [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, and [[herb]]s, are grown for consumption, for use as [[dye]]s, or for [[Medicine|medicinal]] or [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] use. Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity. There are also many studies about the positive effects on mental and physical health in relation to gardening. <ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-01|title=Gardening is beneficial for health: A meta-analysis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335516301401|journal=Preventive Medicine Reports|language=en|volume=5|pages=92–99|doi=10.1016/j.pmedr.2016.11.007|issn=2211-3355}}</ref>

Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of [[shrub]]s, [[tree]]s, and [[herbaceous plant]]s, to residential [[back garden]]s including lawns and foundation plantings, and to [[container garden]]s grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a variety of plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from [[Agriculture|farming]] or [[forestry]].

==History of gardening==
{{Main|History of gardening}}
[[Image:Forestgarden2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Robert Hart (horticulturist)|Robert Hart]]'s forest garden in [[Shropshire]], England]]

===Ancient times===
[[Forest gardening]], a forest-based food production system, is the world's oldest form of gardening.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&pg=PA1|isbn=9780754609582}}</ref> Forest gardens originated in [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]] along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of [[monsoon]] regions. In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while undesirable species were eliminated. Eventually foreign species were also selected and incorporated into the gardens.<ref>{{cite book|title=The forest-garden farms of Kandy, Sri Lanka|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=1992|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3QPo7lThXsC&pg=PA1|isbn=9789251028988}}</ref>

After the emergence of the first [[civilization]]s, wealthy individuals began to create gardens for aesthetic purposes. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian tomb paintings from the [[New Kingdom]] (around 1500 BC) provide some of the earliest physical evidence of ornamental [[horticulture]] and landscape design; they depict [[Egyptian lotus|lotus]] ponds surrounded by symmetrical rows of [[acacia]]s and [[palm tree|palms]]. A notable example of ancient ornamental gardens were the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]]—one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] —while [[ancient Rome]] had dozens of gardens.

Wealthy ancient Egyptians used gardens for providing shade. Egyptians associated trees and gardens with gods, believing that their deities were pleased by gardens. Gardens in ancient Egypt were often surrounded by walls with trees planted in rows. Among the most popular species planted were [[date palms]], sycamores, [[Ficus|fir trees]], nut trees, and [[willows]]. These gardens were a sign of higher socioeconomic status. In addition, wealthy ancient Egyptians grew vineyards, as wine was a sign of the higher social classes. [[Rose]]s, poppies, [[Asteraceae|daisies]] and [[Iris (plant)|irises]] could all also be found in the gardens of the Egyptians.

[[Assyria]] was also renowned for its beautiful gardens. These tended to be wide and large, some of them used for hunting game—rather like a game reserve today—and others as leisure gardens. [[Cupressus|Cypresses]] and palms were some of the most frequently planted types of trees.

Gardens were also available in [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]. In [[Musawwarat es-Sufra]], the Great Enclosure dated to the 3rd century BC included splendid gardens. <ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Stirn|first=Isma'il Kushkush,Matt|title=Why Sudan's Remarkable Ancient Civilization Has Been Overlooked by History|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/sudan-land-kush-meroe-ancient-civilization-overlooked-180975498/|access-date=2020-08-23|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en}}</ref> 

[[Ancient Roman]] gardens were laid out with hedges and vines and contained a wide variety of flowers—[[Acanthus (plant)|acanthus]], [[cornflowers]], [[crocus]], [[cyclamen]], hyacinth, iris, ivy, [[lavender]], lilies, myrtle, narcissus, poppy, [[rosemary]] and violets<ref name="localhistories">{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/gardening.html| title=A Brief History of Gardening|accessdate= 2010-06-04}}</ref>—as well as statues and sculptures. Flower beds were popular in the courtyards of rich Romans.

===The Middle Ages===
[[File:Mendel II 073 v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A gardener at work, 1607]]
The [[Middle Ages]] represent a period of decline in gardens for aesthetic purposes. After the fall of Rome, gardening was done for the purpose of growing [[medicinal herbs]] and/or decorating church [[altars]]. Monasteries carried on a tradition of garden design and intense horticultural techniques during the medieval period in Europe. 
Generally, monastic garden types consisted of kitchen gardens, infirmary gardens, cemetery orchards, cloister garths and vineyards. Individual monasteries might also have had a "green court", a plot of grass and trees where horses could graze, as well as a cellarer's garden or private gardens for obedientiaries, monks who held specific posts within the monastery.

[[Islamic garden]]s were built after the model of [[Persian gardens]] and they were usually enclosed by walls and divided in four by watercourses. Commonly, the centre of the garden would have a [[reflecting pool]] or [[pavilion]]. Specific to the Islamic gardens are the [[mosaics]] and glazed tiles used to decorate the rills and [[Fountain|fountains]] that were built in these gardens.

By the late 13th century, rich Europeans began to grow gardens for leisure and for medicinal herbs and vegetables.<ref name="localhistories" /> They surrounded the gardens by walls to protect them from animals and to provide [[seclusion]]. During the next two centuries, Europeans started planting lawns and raising flowerbeds and trellises of roses. Fruit trees were common in these gardens and also in some, there were turf seats. At the same time, the gardens in the [[monasteries]] were a place to grow flowers and medicinal herbs but they were also a space where the [[monks]] could enjoy nature and relax.

The gardens in the 16th and 17th century were [[symmetric]], proportioned and balanced with a more classical appearance. Most of these gardens were built around a central axis and they were divided into different parts by hedges. Commonly, gardens had flowerbeds laid out in squares and separated by gravel paths.

Gardens in Renaissance were adorned with sculptures, [[topiary]] and fountains. In the 17th century, [[knot garden]]s became popular along with the [[hedge maze]]s. By this time, Europeans started planting new flowers such as [[tulips]], marigolds and [[sunflowers]].

===Cottage gardens===
[[File:XN Kerascoet.jpg|thumb|A cottage garden in [[Brittany]]]]
[[Cottage garden]]s, which emerged in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan times]], appear to have originated as a local source for herbs and fruits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryrie|first=Charlie|title=The Cottage Garden: How to Plan and Plant a Garden That Grows Itself|publisher=[[Collins & Brown]]|year=2004|page=7|isbn=978-1-84340-216-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VfO_WIAx0wC&pg=PA7}}</ref> One theory is that they arose out of the [[Black Death]] of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens.<ref name="Scott-James80">{{cite book|last=Scott-James|first=Anne|author2=Osbert Lancaster|title=The Pleasure Garden: An Illustrated History of British Gardening|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|year=2004|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbhwIo3m3mQC&pg=PA80|isbn=978-0-7112-2360-8}}</ref> According to the late 19th-century legend of origin,<ref>[[Anne Scott-James]], ''The Cottage Garden'' (London: Lane) 1981, de-mythologised the origins of the English cottage garden, and its treasured [[topiary]] among the vegetables and flowers, popularly supposed to represent heirlooms from the seventeenth century.</ref> these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, to provide them with food and herbs, with flowers planted among them for decoration. Farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a small garden—about {{convert|1|acre}}—where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens.<ref>''A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840'', Howard Colvin, [[Yale University Press]], 2008

Authentic gardens of the [[Yeoman|yeoman cottager]] would have included a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, along with a well. The peasant cottager of medieval times was more interested in meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); [[calendula]]s and [[primula vulgaris|primroses]] were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as [[Dianthus barbatus|sweet William]] and [[hollyhock]]s, were grown entirely for their beauty.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Christopher|author2=Richard Bird|others=Jacqui Hurst|title=The Cottage Garden|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=1999|pages=6–9|isbn=978-0-7513-0702-3}}</ref>

===18th century===
[[File:Sheffield Park Gardens, Fletching, Sussex - geograph.org.uk - 1582535.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sheffield Park Garden]], a [[landscape garden]] originally laid out in the 18th century by [[Capability Brown]]]]
In the 18th century gardens were laid out more naturally, without any walls. This style of smooth undulating grass, which would run straight to the house, clumps, belts and scattering of trees and his serpentine lakes formed by invisibly damming small rivers, were a new style within the English landscape, a "gardenless" form of landscape gardening, which swept away almost all the remnants of previous formally patterned styles. The [[English landscape garden]] usually included a lake, lawns set against groves of trees, and often contained shrubberies, grottoes, pavilions, bridges and [[folly|follies]] such as mock temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. This new style emerged in [[England]] in the early 18th century, and spread across [[Europe]], replacing the more formal, symmetrical [[garden à la française]] of the 17th century as the principal gardening style of Europe.<ref>Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe'', Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006.</ref> The English garden presented an idealized view of nature. They were often inspired by paintings of landscapes by [[Claude Lorraine]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]], and some were Influenced by the classic [[Chinese gardens]] of the East,<ref name=Boults/> which had recently been described by European travelers.<ref name=Boults>{{cite book|title=Illustrated History of Landscape Design|author=Boults, Elizabeth and Chip Sullivan|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-470-28933-4|page=175}}</ref>  The work of [[Capability Brown|Lancelot 'Capability' Brown]] was particularly influential. Also, in 1804 the Horticultural Society was formed. 

Gardens of the 19th century contained plants such as the monkey puzzle or Chile pine. This is also the time when the so-called "[[gardenesque]]" style of gardens evolved. These gardens displayed a wide variety of flowers in a rather small space. [[Rock garden]]s increased in popularity in the 19th century.

==Types==
{{main|List of garden types}}
[[File:SF Conservatory of Flowers 3.jpg|thumb|right|Conservatory of Flowers in [[Golden Gate Park]], [[San Francisco]]]]
[[File:Hanging baskets in thornbury arp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hanging basket]]s in [[Thornbury, South Gloucestershire]]]]
[[File:CCHS organic garden.jpg|thumb|An organic garden on a school campus]]
Residential gardening takes place near the home, in a space referred to as the garden. Although a garden typically is located on the land near a residence, it may also be located [[roof garden|on a roof]], in an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], on a [[balcony]], in a [[windowbox]], [[Patio|on a patio]] or [[vivarium]].

Gardening also takes place in non-residential green areas, such as parks, public or semi-public gardens ([[botanical garden]]s or [[zoo|zoological gardens]]), [[amusement park]]s, along transportation corridors, and around [[tourism|tourist attractions]] and [[garden hotels]]. In these situations, a staff of gardeners or [[groundskeeper]]s maintains the gardens.
* Indoor gardening is concerned with the growing of [[houseplant]]s within a residence or building, in a [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]], or in a [[greenhouse]]. Indoor gardens are sometimes incorporated as part of [[air conditioning]] or heating systems. Indoor gardening extends the growing season in the fall and spring and can be used for [[winter gardening]].
* [[Native plant gardening]] is concerned with the use of [[native plants]] with or without the intent of creating [[wildlife habitat]]. The goal is to create a garden in harmony with, and adapted to a given area. This type of gardening typically reduces water usage, maintenance, and fertilization costs, while increasing [[native fauna]]l interest.
* [[Water garden]]ing is concerned with growing plants adapted to pools and ponds. [[Bog garden]]s are also considered a type of water garden. These all require special conditions and considerations. A simple water garden may consist solely of a tub containing the water and plant(s). In [[aquascaping]], a garden is created within an [[aquarium]] tank.
* [[Container garden]]ing is concerned with growing plants in any type of container either indoors or outdoors. Common containers are pots, [[hanging basket]]s, and planters. Container gardening is usually used in atriums and on balconies, patios, and roof tops.
* [[Hügelkultur]] is concerned with growing plants on piles of rotting wood, as a form of [[raised bed gardening]] and composting [[In situ#Biology|in situ]].<ref name="richsoil">{{cite web|url=http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/|title=hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds|website=www.richsoil.com}}</ref> An English [[loanword]] from German, it means "mound garden." [[Toby Hemenway]], noted [[permaculture]] author and teacher, considers wood buried in trenches to also be a form of hugelkultur referred to as a dead wood [[Swale (landform)|swale]].<ref>Hemenway, Toby (2009). ''Gaia's Garden: A Guide to Home-Scale Permaculture''. Chelsea Green Publishing. pp. 84-85. {{ISBN|978-1-60358-029-8}}.</ref> Hugelkultur is practiced by [[Sepp Holzer]] as a method of [[forest gardening]] and [[agroforestry]], and by [[Geoff Lawton]] as a method of [[dryland farming]] and [[desert greening]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.org.au/2009/12/11/greening-the-desert-ii-final/|title=Greening the Desert II|date=11 December 2009}}</ref> When used as a method of disposing of large volumes of waste wood and woody debris, hugelkultur accomplishes [[carbon sequestration]].<ref name="richsoil" /> It is also a form of [[xeriscaping]].
* [[Community gardening]] is a social activity in which an area of land is gardened by a group of people, providing access to fresh produce, herbs, flowers and plants as well as access to satisfying labor, neighborhood improvement, sense of community and connection to the environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.communitygarden.org/learn/ |publisher=American Community Garden Association |year=2007 |title=What is a community garden? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204082111/http://www.communitygarden.org/learn/ |archivedate=4 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>Hannah, A.

(2001) People, Land and Sustainability: Community Gardens and the Social Dimension of Sustainable Development. ''Social Policy and Administration.'' 35(5). 559-568.</ref>
* [[Garden sharing]] partners landowners with gardeners in need of land. These shared gardens, typically front or back [[yard (land)|yards]], are usually used to produce food that is divided between the two parties.
* [[Organic horticulture|Organic gardening]] uses natural, sustainable methods, fertilizers and pesticides to grow non-[[genetically modified crops]].
*Commercial gardening is a more intensive type of gardening that involves the production of vegetables, nontropical fruits, and flowers from local farmers. Commercial gardening began because farmers would sell locally to stop food from spoiling faster because of the transportation of goods from a far distance. Mediterranean agriculture is also a common practice that commercial gardeners use. Mediterranean agriculture is the practice of cultivating animals such as sheep to help weed and provide manure for vine crops, grains, or citrus. Gardeners can easily train these animals to not eat the actual plant.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greiner, Alyson L., 1966-|title=Visualizing human geography|date=28 January 2014|isbn=978-1-118-52656-9|edition=Second|location=Hoboken|oclc=862759747}}</ref>

==Social aspects==
People can express their political or social views in gardens, intentionally or not. The lawn vs. garden issue is played out in [[urban planning]] as the debate over the "[[land ethic]]" that is to determine urban [[land use]] and whether hyper [[hygiene|hygienist]] [[bylaw]]s (e.g. [[weed control]]) should apply, or whether land should generally be allowed to exist in its natural wild state. In a famous [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights]] case, "Sandra Bell vs. City of Toronto", 1997, the right to cultivate all native species, even most varieties deemed noxious or allergenic, was upheld as part of the [[Freedom of speech|right of free expression]].

[[Community gardening]] comprises a wide variety of approaches to sharing land and gardens.

[[File:Schultenhof Mettingen Bauerngarten 8.jpg|thumb|left|Garden at the Schultenhof in [[Mettingen]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany]]
People often surround their house and garden with a hedge. Common hedge plants are [[privet]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]], [[beech]], [[Taxus|yew]], [[Leyland Cypress|leyland cypress]], [[Tsuga|hemlock]], [[Thuja occidentalis|arborvitae]], [[Berberis|barberry]], [[Buxus|box]], [[holly]], [[Nerium oleander|oleander]], [[forsythia]] and [[lavender]]. The idea of open gardens without hedges may be distasteful to those who enjoy privacy.
The [[Slow Food]] movement has sought in some countries to add an edible [[School garden|school yard]] and garden classrooms to schools, e.g. in [[Fergus, Ontario]], where these were added to a public school to augment the kitchen classroom. [[Garden sharing]], where urban landowners allow gardeners to grow on their property in exchange for a share of the harvest, is associated with the desire to control the quality of one's food, and reconnect with soil and community.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/04/ethicalliving.organics Meet the urban sharecroppers] ''The Guardian'', 4 September 2008</ref>

In US and British usage, the production of ornamental plantings around buildings is called ''[[landscaping]]'', ''[[landscape maintenance]]'' or ''grounds keeping'', while international usage uses the term ''gardening'' for these same activities.

Also gaining popularity is the concept of "Green Gardening" which involves growing plants using organic fertilizers and pesticides so that the gardening process – or the flowers and fruits produced thereby – doesn't adversely affect the environment or people's health in any manner.

==Comparison with farming==
[[File:Hayes-Valley-Farm by Zoey-Kroll fava-hillside.jpg|thumb|Berms of fava beans have been planted at Hayes Valley Farm, a community-built farm on the former Central freeway ramps of San Francisco]]
Gardening for beauty is likely{{original research inline|date=January 2018}} nearly as old as farming for food, however for most of history for the majority of people there was no real distinction since the need for food and other useful products trumped other concerns. Small-scale, [[subsistence agriculture]] (called [[hoe-farming]]) is largely indistinguishable from gardening. A patch of potatoes grown by a Peruvian peasant or an Irish [[smallholding|smallholder]] for personal use could be described as either a garden or a farm. Gardening for average people evolved as a separate discipline, more concerned with aesthetics, [[recreation]] and [[leisure]],<ref>

under the influence of the pleasure gardens of the wealthy.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  Meanwhile, farming has evolved (in developed countries) in the direction of [[commercial agriculture|commercialization]], [[economics of scale]], and [[monocropping]].

In respect to its food-producing purpose, gardening is distinguished{{by whom|date=January 2018}} from [[Agriculture|farming]] chiefly by scale and intent. Farming occurs on a larger scale, and with the production of salable goods as a major motivation. Gardening happens on a smaller scale, primarily for pleasure and to produce goods for the gardener's own family or community. There is some overlap between the terms, particularly in that some moderate-sized vegetable growing concerns, often called [[market gardening]], can fit in either category.

The key distinction between gardening and farming is essentially one of scale; gardening can be a hobby or an income supplement, but farming is generally understood{{by whom|date=January 2018}} as a full-time or commercial activity, usually involving more land and quite different practices. One distinction is that gardening is labor-intensive and employs very little [[infrastructural capital]], sometimes no more than a few tools, e.g. a [[spade]], [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], [[basket]] and [[watering can]]. By contrast, larger-scale farming often involves [[irrigation|irrigation systems]], chemical [[fertilizer]]s and [[combine harvester|harvesters]] or at least [[ladder]]s, e.g. to reach up into [[fruit tree]]s. However, this distinction is becoming blurred with the increasing use of power tools in even small gardens.

[[Monty Don]] has speculated on an atavistic connection between present-day gardeners and pre-modern [[peasantry]].<ref>

The term [[precision agriculture]] is sometimes used{{by whom|date=January 2018}} to describe gardening using [[Appropriate technology|intermediate technology]] (more than tools, less than harvesters), especially of [[organic farming|organic varieties]]. Gardening is effectively scaled up to feed entire villages of over 100 people from specialized plots. A variant is the [[community gardening|community garden]] which offers plots to urban dwellers; see further in [[allotment (gardening)]].

==Garden ornaments and accessories==
{{main|Garden ornament}}
[[Image:Urn, Palm House.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A classical [[urn]] at Palm House, the [[Belfast Botanic Gardens]], [[Northern Ireland]], as [[garden ornament]]]]
There is a wide range of [[garden ornament]]s and accessories available in the market for both the professional gardener and the amateur to exercise their creativity. These are used to add decoration or functionality, and may be made from a wide range of materials such as copper, stone, wood, bamboo, [[stainless steel]], [[clay]], [[stained glass]], concrete, or iron. Examples include [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]], [[garden furniture]], [[Garden sculpture|statues]], [[outdoor fireplace]]s, [[Fountain|fountains]], [[rain chain]]s, [[urns]], [[bird bath]]s and [[Bird feeder|feeders]], [[wind chime]]s, and garden lighting such as candle [[lanterns]] and [[oil lamps]]. The use of these items can be part of the expression of a gardener's gardening personality.

==Gardens as art==
{{See also|Landscape architecture}}
[[Garden design]] is considered to be an art in most cultures, distinguished from gardening, which generally means ''garden maintenance''. Garden design can include different themes such as perennial, [[Butterfly gardening|butterfly]], [[Wildlife garden|wildlife]], [[Japanese garden|Japanese]], [[Water garden|water]], [[Tropical garden|tropical]], or [[Shade garden|shade]] gardens. 

In Japan, [[Samurai]] and [[Zen|Zen monks]] were often required to build decorative gardens or practice related skills like [[floristry|flower arrangement]] known as ''[[ikebana]]''. In 18th-century Europe, country estates were refashioned by landscape gardeners into [[Garden design|formal gardens]] or landscaped park lands, such as at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], France, or [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]], England. Today, [[landscape architect]]s and [[garden designer]]s continue to produce artistically creative designs for private garden spaces. In the US, professional landscape designers are certified by the Association of Professional Landscape Designers.<ref>[http://www.apld.org APLD.org]</ref>

==Garden pests==
Garden pests are generally [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], or [[animal]]s (frequently [[insect]]s) that engage in activity that the gardener considers undesirable. A pest may crowd out desirable plants, disturb soil, stunt the growth of young seedlings, steal or damage fruit, or otherwise kill plants, hamper their growth, damage their appearance, or reduce the quality of the edible or ornamental portions of the plant. [[Aphid]]s, [[spider mite]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[ant]]s, [[bird]]s, and even [[cat]]s are commonly considered to be garden pests.

[[File:Tropaeolum speciosum Poeppig and Endl. (AM AK294005-1).jpg|thumb|The flame flower (''[[Tropaeolum speciosum]]''), climbs  over other plants to a sunlit position]]
Because gardeners may have different goals, organisms considered "garden pests" vary from gardener to gardener. ''[[Tropaeolum speciosum]]'', for example, may be considered a desirable and ornamental garden plant, or it may be considered a pest if it [[seed]]s and starts to grow where it is not wanted. As another example, in [[lawn]]s, moss can become dominant and be impossible to eradicate. In some lawns, [[lichen]]s, especially very damp lawn lichens such as ''[[Peltigera]] lactucfolia'' and ''P. membranacea'', can become difficult to control and are considered pests.

===Garden pest control===
There are many ways by which unwanted pests are removed from a garden. The techniques vary depending on the pest, the gardener's goals, and the gardener's philosophy. For example, snails may be dealt with through the use of a chemical pesticide, an organic pesticide, hand-picking, barriers, or simply growing snail-resistant plants.

[[Pest control]] is often done through the use of [[pesticides]], which may be either [[Organic agriculture|organic]] or artificially synthesized. Pesticides may affect the [[ecology]] of a garden due to their effects on the populations of both target and non-target species. For example, unintended exposure to some [[neonicotinoid]] pesticides has been proposed as a factor in the recent decline in [[honey bee]] populations.<ref>{{cite journal| title=A Common Pesticide Decreases Foraging Success and Survival in Honey Bees| year=2012| doi=10.1126/science.1215039| last1=Henry| first1=M.| last2=Beguin| first2=M.| last3=Requier| first3=F.| last4=Rollin| first4=O.| last5=Odoux| first5=J.-F.| last6=Aupinel| first6=P.| last7=Aptel| first7=J.| last8=Tchamitchian| first8=S.| last9=Decourtye| first9=A.| journal=Science| volume=336| issue=6079| pages=348–350| pmid=22461498| bibcode=2012Sci...336..348H| s2cid=41186355| url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00731655/file/51503_20120420060922456_1.pdf}}</ref> A mole vibrator can deter mole activity in a garden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/1998/04/mole-ested?page=0,2| title=Mole-ested|accessdate= 2014-05-28}}</ref>

Other means of control include the removal of infected plants, using fertilizers and biostimulants to improve the health and vigour of plants so they better resist attack, practising [[crop rotation]] to prevent pest build-up, using [[companion planting]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/2010/08/11/episode-24-companion-planting-and-crop-rotation/ |title=The Self-Sufficient Gardener Podcast--Episode 24 Companion Planting and Crop Rotation |accessdate=2010-08-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918114758/http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/2010/08/11/episode-24-companion-planting-and-crop-rotation/ |archivedate=18 September 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> and practising good garden hygiene, such as disinfecting tools and clearing debris and [[weed]]s which may harbour pests.

[[Garden guns]] are smooth bore shotguns specifically made to fire [[.22 caliber]] [[snake shot]], and are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for pest control. Garden guns are short range weapons that can do little harm past {{convert|15|yard}} to {{convert|20|yard}}, and they're relatively quiet when fired with snake shot, compared to a standard ammunition. These guns are especially effective inside of barns and sheds, as the snake shot will not shoot holes in the roof or walls, or more importantly injure [[livestock]] with a [[ricochet]]. They are also used for pest control at [[airport]]s, [[warehouse]]s, [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], etc.<ref name="Eger">{{cite web|last1=Eger|first1=Christopher|title=Marlin 25MG Garden Gun|url=http://www.marlinforum.com/Marlin-25MG-Garden-Gun.html|website=Marlin Firearms Forum|publisher=Outdoor Hub LLC|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=28 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918005923/http://www.marlinforum.com/Marlin-25MG-Garden-Gun.html|archive-date=18 September 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
