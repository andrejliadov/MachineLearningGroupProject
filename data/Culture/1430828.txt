{{Literature}}
As a [[literary genre]] of [[high culture]], '''heroic romance''' or '''chivalric romance''' is a type of [[prose]] and [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] [[narrative]] that was popular in the [[Royal court|noble courts ]] of [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval]] and [[Early Modern Europe]]. They were fantastic stories about marvel-filled [[adventure]]s, often of a [[chivalry|chivalric]] [[knight-errant]] portrayed as having [[hero]]ic qualities, who goes on a [[quest]].  It developed further from the epics as time went on; in particular, "the emphasis on love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the ''[[chanson de geste]]'' and other kinds of [[epic poetry|epic]], in which masculine military heroism predominates."<ref>{{cite book |last= Chris Baldick |entry=Chivalric Romance |title= The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms |date=2008 |edition=3rd |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-19-172717-7 |oclc= 4811919031}}</ref>

Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with [[Irony|ironic]], [[satire|satiric]], or [[burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] intent. Romances reworked [[legend]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, and history to suit the readers' and hearers' tastes, but by c. 1600 they were out of fashion, and [[Miguel de Cervantes]] famously [[burlesque]]d them in his novel ''[[Don Quixote]]''. Still, the [[medievalism|modern image of "medieval"]] is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word ''medieval'' evokes knights, [[damsel in distress|distressed damsels]], [[dragon]]s, and other romantic [[trope (literature)|tropes]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=C. S. |author-link=C. S. Lewis |title=[[The Discarded Image]] |location=Cambridge |date=1994 |edition=Canto |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-47735-2 |page=9 |ref=harv}}</ref>

Originally, romance literature was written in [[Old French]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], [[Occitan]], and [[Franco-Provençal language|Provençal]], and later in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]] (Sicilian poetry), and [[German language|German]]. During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose. In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of [[courtly love]], such as faithfulness in adversity.

==Form==
Unlike the later form of the [[novel]] and like the [[chansons de geste]], the genre of romance dealt with traditional themes.  These were distinguished from earlier [[epic poetry|epics]] by heavy use of marvelous events, the elements of love, and the frequent use of a web of interwoven stories, rather than a simple plot unfolding about a main character.<ref>{{cite book | last=Lewis | first=C. S. | title=A Preface to Paradise Lost | location=London | date=1961 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-500345-1 | page=6}}</ref>  The earliest forms were invariably in verse, but the 15th century saw many in prose, often retelling the old, rhymed versions.<ref>{{cite book | last=Huizinga | first=Johan | title=The Autumn of the Middle Ages | url=https://archive.org/details/autumnofmiddleag00joha | url-access=registration | location=Chicago | date=1996 | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=978-0-226-35992-2 | page=[https://archive.org/details/autumnofmiddleag00joha/page/354 354] | ref=harv}}</ref>

The romantic form pursued the wish-fulfillment dream where the heroes and heroines were considered representations of the ideals of the age while the villains embodied the threat to their ascendancy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fantastic Literature: A Critical Reader|last=Sandner|first=David|publisher=Praeger|year=2004|isbn=0275980537|location=Westport, CT|pages=108}}</ref> There is also a persistent archetype, which involved a hero's quest. This quest or journey served as the structure that held the narrative together. With regards to the structure, scholars recognize the similarity of the romance to folk tales. [[Vladimir Propp]] identified a basic form for this genre and it involved an order that began with initial situation, then followed by departure, complication, first move, second move, and resolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Literature of Hope in the Middle Ages and Today: Connections in Medieval Romance, Modern Fantasy, and Science Fiction|last=Keyes|first=Flo|publisher=McFarland & Company|year=2006|isbn=0786425962|location=Jefferson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/literatureofhope00flok/page/85 85]|url=https://archive.org/details/literatureofhope00flok/page/85}}</ref> This structure is also applicable to romance narratives.

===Cycles===
[[File:Holger danske.jpg|right|thumb|Holger Danske,
or Ogier the Dane, from the Matter of France]]
Overwhelmingly, these were linked in some way, perhaps only in an opening [[frame story]], with three thematic cycles of tales: these were assembled in imagination at a late date as the "[[Matter of Rome]]" (actually centered on the life and deeds of [[Alexander the Great]] conflated with the [[Trojan War]]), the "[[Matter of France]]" ([[Charlemagne]] and [[Roland]], his principal [[paladin]]) and the "[[Matter of Britain]]" (the lives and deeds of [[King Arthur]] and the Knights of the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]], within which was incorporated the quest for the [[Holy Grail]]); medieval authors{{who|date=October 2019}} explicitly described these as comprising all romances.<ref name=ReferenceA>{{cite book | last1=Hibbard | first1=Laura A. | last2=Loomis | first2=Laura A. | title=Medieval Romance in England: A Study of the Sources and Analogues of the Non-Cyclic Metrical Romances | url=https://archive.org/details/medievalromancei0000unse | url-access=registration | location=New York | year=1963 | publisher=Burt Franklin | isbn=978-0-8337-2144-0 | page=iii | ref=harv}}</ref>

In reality, a number of "non-cyclical" romances were written without any such connection;<ref name="ReferenceA" /> these include such romances as ''[[King Horn]]'',{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=83}} ''[[Robert the Devil]]'',{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=49}} ''[[Ipomadon]]'',<ref>Purdie, Rhiannon. 2001.

Oxford University Press for the Early English Text Society.</ref>  ''[[Emaré]]'',{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=23}} ''[[Havelok the Dane]]'',{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=103}}''[[Roswall and Lillian]]'',{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=290}} ''[[Le Bone Florence of Rome]]'',<ref>{{cite book | last=Heffernan | first=Carol Falvo | title=Le Bone Florence of Rome | location=Manchester | date=1976 | publisher=Manchester University Press | isbn=978-0-7190-0647-0 | oclc=422642874}}</ref> and ''[[Amadas]]''.{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=73}}

Indeed, some tales are found so often that scholars group them together as the "[[The Man of Law's Tale|Constance]] cycle" or the "[[Crescentia (romance)|Crescentia]] cycle"—referring not to a continuity of character and setting, but to the recognizable plot.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Sources==
Many influences are clear in the forms of chivalric romance.

===Medieval epic===
The medieval romance developed out of the medieval epic, in particular the [[Matter of France]] developing out of such tales as the ''[[Chanson de Geste]]'', with intermediate forms where the feudal bonds of loyalty had giants, or a magical horn, added to the plot.<ref>{{cite book | last=Ker | first=William Paton | author-link=W. P. Ker | title=Epic and Romance: Essays on Medieval Literature | date=1908 | url=https://archive.org/details/epicromanceessay00kerwuoft | publisher=Macmillan | location=London | page=[https://archive.org/details/epicromanceessay00kerwuoft/page/53 53] | ref=harv}}</ref>  The epics of [[Charlemagne]], unlike such ones as ''[[Beowulf]]'', already had feudalism rather than the tribal loyalties; this was to continue in romances.{{sfn|Ker|1908|p=52}}

===Contemporary society===
The romance form is distinguished from the earlier [[Epic poetry|epics]] of the Middle Ages by the changes of the 12th century, which introduced courtly and chivalrous themes into the works.{{sfn|Ker|1908|pp=3–4}} This occurred regardless of congruity to the source material; Alexander the Great featured as a fully feudal king.{{sfn|Ker|1908|p=27}} Chivalry was treated as continuous from Roman times.{{sfn|Huizinga|1996|pp=75}} This extended even to such details as clothing; when in the ''[[Seven Sages of Rome]]'', the son of an (unnamed) emperor of Rome wears the clothing of a sober Italian citizen, and when his stepmother attempts to seduce him, her clothing is described in medieval terminology.<ref>{{cite book | last=Scott | first=Margaret | title=Medieval Dress & Fashion | location=London | date=2007 | publisher=The British Library | isbn=978-0-7123-0675-1 | pages=137–140 | ref=harv}}</ref>  When Priam sends Paris to Greece in a 14th-century work, Priam is dressed in the mold of Charlemagne, and Paris is dressed demurely, but in Greece, he adopts the flashier style, with multicolored clothing and fashionable shoes, cut in lattice-work—signs of a seducer in the era.{{sfn|Scott|2007|p=93}}

Historical figures reappeared, reworked, in romance.  The entire Matter of France derived from known figures, and suffered somewhat because their descendants had an interest in the tales that were told of their ancestors, unlike the Matter of Britain.  [[Richard Coeur de Lion]] reappeared in romance, endowed with a fairy mother who arrived in a ship with silk sails and departed when forced to behold the sacrament, bare-handed combat with a lion, magical rings, and prophetic dreams.{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|pp=148–153}} [[Hereward the Wake]]'s early life appeared in chronicles as the embellished, romantic adventures of an exile, complete with rescuing princesses and wrestling with bears.<ref>{{cite book | last=Keen | first=Maurice Hugh | title=The Outlaws of Medieval Legend | location=New York | date=1989 | publisher=Dorset Press | isbn=978-0-88029-454-6 | page=12 | ref=harv}}</ref>  [[Fulk Fitzwarin]], an outlaw in King John's day, has his historical background a minor thread in the episodic stream of romantic adventures.{{sfn|Keen|1989|p=39}}

===Folklore and folktales===
The earliest medieval romances dealt heavily with themes from folklore, which diminished over time, though remaining a presence. Many early tales had the knight, such as [[Sir Launfal]], meet with [[fairy]] ladies, and [[Huon of Bordeaux]] is aided by [[Oberon (Fairy King)|King Oberon]],{{sfn|Lewis|1994|pp=129–130}} but these fairy characters were transformed, more and more often, into wizards and enchantresses.<ref name=fairies>{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Katharine M.|author-link=Katharine Mary Briggs|title=An Encyclopedia of Fairies: Hoglobins, Brownies, Bogies and Othersupernatural Creatures|location=New York|date=1977|publisher=Pantheon|isbn=978-0-394-73467-5|chapter=Fairies in medieval romances|page=132|ref=harv}}</ref> [[Morgan le Fay]] never loses her name, but in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', she studies magic rather than being inherently magical.{{sfn|Briggs|1977|loc="Morgan Le Fay"|p=303}} Similarly, knights lose magical abilities.<ref name=fairies/> Still, fairies never completely vanished from the tradition. ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' is a late tale, but the [[Green Knight]] himself is an otherworldly being.<ref name=fairies/>

Early persecuted heroines were often driven from their husbands' homes by the persecutions of their mothers-in-law, whose motives are seldom delineated, and whose accusations are of the heroines' having borne monstrous children, committed infanticide, or practiced witchcraft — all of which appear in such [[fairy tale]]s as ''[[The Girl Without Hands]]'' and many others. As time progressed, a new persecutor appeared: a courtier who was rejected by the woman or whose ambition requires her removal, and who accuses her of adultery or high treason, motifs not duplicated in fairy tales.<ref name="accused62"/>  While he never eliminates the mother-in-law, many romances such as ''[[Valentine and Orson]]'' have later variants that change from the mother-in-law to the courtier, whereas a more recent version never goes back.<ref name="accused62">{{cite book | last=Schlauch | first=Margaret | author-link=Margaret Schlauch | title=Chaucer's Constance and Accused Queens | location=New York | date=1969 | publisher=Gordian Press | pages=62–63 | oclc=892031418}}</ref>

In Italy there is the story called ''Il Bel Gherardino''. It is the most ancient prototype of an Italian singing fairy tale by an anonymous Tuscan author. It tells the story of a young Italian knight, depleted for its "magnanimitas", who gets the love of a fairy. When he loses this love because he does not comply with his conditions, Gherardino reconquers his lady after a series of labours, including the prison where he is rescued by another woman and a tournament where he wins. Other examples of Italian (Tuscan) poetry tales are Antonio Pucci's literature: ''Gismirante, Il Brutto di Bretagna'' or ''Brito di Bretagna'' ("The ugly knight of Britain") and ''Madonna Lionessa'' ("Lioness Lady"). Another work of a second anonymous Italian author that is worth mentioning is ''Istoria di Tre Giovani Disperati e di Tre Fate'' ("Story of three desperate boys and three fairies").

===Classical origins===
Some romances, such as ''[[Apollonius of Tyre]]'', show classical pagan origins.{{sfn|Hibbard|Loomis|1963|p=169}} Tales of the [[Matter of Rome]] in particular may be derived from such works as the [[Alexander Romance]].  Ovid was used as a source for tales of Jason and Medea, which were cast in romance in a more fairy-tale like form, probably closer to the older forms than Ovid's rhetoric.{{sfn|Ker|1908|p=382}} It also drew upon the traditions of magic that were attributed to such figures as Virgil.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Jolly | first1=Karen Louise | last2=Raudvere | first2=Catharina | last3=Peters | first3=Edward | last4=Ankarloo | first4=Bengt | last5=Clark | first5=Stuart | chapter=Medieval Magic:  Definitions, Beliefs, Practices|  title=The Middle Ages | location=Philadelphia | series=Witchcraft and Magic in Europe | volume=3 | date=2002 | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | isbn=978-0-8122-1786-5 | page=68 | ref=harv}}</ref>

===Religious practices===
The Arthurian cycle also contains many magical elements, some of which appear to be Celtic in origin, but which are chiefly drawn from Christian ritual and story.{{sfn|Jolly|Raudvere|Peters|Ankarloo|2002|p=68}}

===Courtly love===
The new [[courtly love]] was not one of the original elements of the genre, but quickly became very important when introduced.

It was introduced to the romance by [[Chretien de Troyes]], combining it with the Matter of Britain, new to French poets.<ref>{{cite book | last=Lewis | first=C. S. | title=The Allegory of Love: A Study in Medieval Tradition | location=Oxford | series=Oxford Paperbacks | date=1995| publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-281220-9 | page=23 | ref=harv}}</ref>  In ''[[Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart]]'' (unlike his earlier ''[[Erec and Enide]]''), the behavior of Lancelot conforms to the courtly love ideal;{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=26}} it also, though still full of adventure, devotes an unprecedented amount of time to dealing with the psychological aspects of the love.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=29}}  By the end of the 14th century, counter to the earliest formulations, many French and English romances combined courtly love, with love sickness and devotion on the man's part, with the couple's subsequent marriage; this featured in ''[[Sir Degrevant]]'', ''[[Sir Torrent of Portyngale]]'', ''[[Sir Eglamour of Artois|Sir Eglamour]]'', and ''[[William of Palerne]]''.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last=Sayers | editor-first=Dorothy | title=Essays Presented to Charles Williams | location=Grand Rapids, Michigan | date=1981 | publisher=Eerdmans | isbn=978-0-8028-1117-2 | last=Mathew | first=Gervase | chapter=Marriage and ''Amour Courtois'' in Late Fourteenth Century England | pages=132–133 | ref=harv}}</ref>  ''[[Ipomadon]]'' even explicitly describes the married couple as lovers, and the plot of ''[[Sir Otuel]]'' was altered, to allow him to marry Belyssant.{{sfn|Mathew|1981|p=133}} Similarly, Iberian romances of the 14th century praised monogamy and marriage in such tales as ''[[Tirant lo Blanc]]'' and ''[[Amadís de Gaula]]''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Seed | first=Patricia | author-link=Patricia Seed| title=To Love, Honor, and Obey in Colonial Mexico: Conflicts Over Marriage Choice, 1574-1821 | date=2004 | isbn=978-0-8047-2159-2 | page=51}}</ref>

==Early forms==
[[File:Dobrynya Nikitich rescues Zabava from the Gorynych, 1941.jpg|thumb|right|A knight rescues a lady from a dragon.]]
Many medieval romances recount the marvellous [[adventure]]s of a chivalrous, [[hero]]ic [[knight]], often of super-human ability, who, abiding chivalry's strict codes of honor and demeanor, goes on a [[quest]], and fights and defeats monsters and giants, thereby winning favor with a [[princesse lointaine|lady]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Frye | first=Northrop | title=[[Anatomy of Criticism|Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays]] | location=Princeton, New Jersey | date=1973 | edition=3rd print | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=978-0-691-06004-0 | page=[https://archive.org/details/anatomyofcritici00frye/page/186 186] }}</ref>   The Matter of France, most popular early, did not lend itself to the subject of [[courtly love]], but rather dealt with heroic adventure: in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'', Roland, though betrothed to Oliver's sister, does not think of her during the course of events.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=9}} The themes of love were, however, to soon appear, particularly in the Matter of Britain, leading to even the French regarding King Arthur's court as the exemplar of true and noble love, so much so that even the earliest writers about courtly love would claim it had reached its true excellence there, and love was not what it was in King Arthur's day.{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=24}}   A perennial theme was [[princess and dragon|the rescue of a lady from the imperiling monster]], a theme that would remain throughout the romances of the medieval era.{{sfn|Huizinga|1996|pp=83–84}}

Originally, this literature was written in [[Old French]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Occitan]], later, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] – amongst the important Spanish texts were [[Cantar de Mio Cid]] and [[Book of the Knight Zifar]]; notable later English works being [[King Horn]] (a translation of the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] (AN) [[Romance of Horn]] of Mestre Thomas), and [[Havelok the Dane]] (a translation of the anonymous AN Lai d'Haveloc); around the same time [[Gottfried von Strassburg]]'s version of the [[Tristan]] of [[Thomas of Britain]] (a different Thomas to the author of 'Horn') and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s [[Parzival]] translated classic French romance narrative into the German tongue.

== Forms of the High Middle Ages ==
During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose, and extensively amplified through cycles of continuation.  These were collated in the vast, polymorphous manuscript witnesses comprising what is now known as the [[Vulgate Cycle]], with the romance of [[La Mort le Roi Artu]] c. 1230, perhaps its final installment.  These texts, together with a wide range of further Arthurian material, such as that found in the anonymous cycle of English [[Brut Chronicles]], comprised the bases of [[Malory]]'s [[Morte d'Arthur]].  Prose literature thus increasingly dominated the expression of romance narrative in the later Middle Ages, at least until the resurgence of verse during the high Renaissance in the oeuvres of [[Ludovico Ariosto]], [[Torquato Tasso]], and [[Edmund Spenser]].

In Old Norse, they are the prose ''[[riddarasögur]]'' or chivalric sagas.  The genre began in thirteenth-century Norway with translations of French ''chansons de geste''; it soon expanded to similar indigenous creations. The early fourteenth century saw the emergence of Scandinavian verse romance in Sweden under the patronage of Queen [[Euphemia of Rügen]], who commissioned the ''[[Eufemiavisorna]]''.

==Late Medieval and Renaissance forms==

In late [[medieval]] and [[Renaissance]] high culture, the important European literary trend was to fantastic fictions in the mode of Romance. Exemplary work, such as the English ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''  by Sir Thomas Malory (c. 1408&ndash;1471), the Catalan ''[[Tirant lo Blanch]]'', and the Castilian or Portuguese ''[[Amadís de Gaula]]'' (1508), spawned many imitators, and the genre was popularly well-received, producing such masterpiece of Renaissance poetry as [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' and [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[Gerusalemme Liberata]]'' and other 16th-century literary works in the romance genre.  The romances were freely drawn upon for royal pageantry.<ref>{{cite book | last=Strong | first=Roy C. | title=Splendor at Court: Renaissance Spectacle and the Theater of Power | location=Boston | date=1973 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | isbn=978-0-395-17220-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/splendoratcourtr0000stro/page/109 109] | url=https://archive.org/details/splendoratcourtr0000stro/page/109 }}</ref>  Queen Elizabeth I's Accession Day tilts, for instance, drew freely on the multiplicity of incident from romances for the knights' disguises.<ref>{{cite book | last=Strong | first=Roy C. | title=The Cult of Elizabeth: Elizabethan Portraiture and Pageantry | date=1977 | publisher=University of California Press | isbn=978-0-520-05840-8 | page=161}}</ref>  Knights even assumed the names of romantic figures, such as the [[Swan Knight]], or the coat-of-arms of such figures as Lancelot or Tristan.{{sfn|Huizinga|1996|pp=90–91}}

From the high Middle Ages, in works of piety, clerical critics often deemed romances to be harmful worldly distractions from more substantive or moral works, and by 1600 many secular readers would agree; in the judgement of many learned readers in the shifting intellectual atmosphere of the 17th century, the romance was trite and childish literature, inspiring only broken-down ageing and provincial persons such as [[Don Quixote]], knight of the culturally isolated province of [[La Mancha]]. (''[[Don Quixote]]'' [1605, 1615], by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] [1547&ndash;1616],  is a satirical story of an elderly country gentleman, living in La Mancha province, who is so obsessed by chivalric romances that he seeks to emulate their various heroes.) ''[[Hudibras]]'' also lampoons the faded conventions of chivalrous romance, from an ironic, consciously realistic viewpoint. Some of the magical and exotic atmosphere of Romance informed tragedies for the stage, such as [[John Dryden]]'s collaborative ''[[The Indian Queen (play)|The Indian Queen]]'' (1664) as well as [[Restoration spectacular]]s  and ''[[opera seria]]'', such as [[Handel]]'s ''[[Rinaldo (opera)|Rinaldo]]'' (1711), based on a magical interlude in [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s ''[[Gerusalemme liberata]]''.

In the [[Renaissance]], also, the romance genre was bitterly attacked as barbarous and silly by the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]], who exalted Greek and Latin classics and classical forms, an attack that was not in that century very effective among the common readers.<ref>{{cite book | last=Lewis | first=C.

==Related forms==
The [[Acritic songs]] (dealing with [[Digenis Acritas]] and his fellow frontiersmen) resemble much the ''chanson de geste'', though they developed simultaneously but separately. These songs dealt with the hardships and adventures of the border guards of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantium) – including their love affairs – and where a predominantly oral tradition which survived in the Balkans and Anatolia until modern times. This genre may have intermingled with its Western counterparts during the long occupation of Byzantine territories by French and Italian knights after the 4th crusade. This is suggested by later works in the Greek language which show influences from both traditions.

==Relationship to modern "romantic fiction"==
In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of [[courtly love]], such as faithfulness in adversity. From c. 1760 – usually cited as 1764 at the publication of [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' – the connotations of "romance" moved from fantastic and eerie, somewhat [[Gothic literature|Gothic]] adventure narratives of novelists like [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[A Sicilian Romance]]'' (1790) or ''[[The Romance of the Forest]]'' (1791) with erotic content to novels centered on the episodic development of a [[courtship]] that ends in marriage. With a female protagonist, during the rise of [[Romanticism]] the depiction of the course of such a courtship within contemporary conventions of [[realism (arts)|realism]], the female equivalent of the "[[Bildungsroman|novel of education]]", informs much [[Romantism#Romantic authors|Romantic fiction]]. In gothic novels such as [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'', the elements of romantic seduction and [[desire (emotion)|desire]] were mingled with fear and dread.  [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] used the term to distinguish his works as romances rather than novels,<ref>{{cite book | last=O'Connor | first=Flannery | title=Mystery and Manners: Occasional Prose | location=New York | date=1984 | edition=12th print | publisher=Farrar, Straus [and] Giroux | isbn=978-0-374-50804-3 | page=[https://archive.org/details/mysterymanners00flan/page/38 38] | ref=harv | url=https://archive.org/details/mysterymanners00flan/page/38 }}</ref> and literary criticism of the 19th century often accepted the contrast between the romance and the novel, in such works as [[H.

In 1825, the [[fantasy]] genre developed when the Swedish literary work ''[[Frithjof's saga]]'', which was based on the ''[[Friðþjófs saga ins frœkna]]'', became successful in [[England]] and [[Germany]]. It was translated twenty-two times into English, 20 times into German, and into many other European languages, including modern Icelandic in 1866. Their influence on authors such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[William Morris]] and [[Poul Anderson]] and on the subsequent modern fantasy genre is considerable.

Modern usage of term "romance" usually refer to the [[romance novel]], which is a subgenre that focuses on the relationship and [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] between two people; these novels must have an "emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending."<ref name="rwadefn">{{cite web | title = Romance Novels--What Are They? | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]] | url = https://www.rwanational.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=rwa&WebKey=18bbfbec-455e-43ff-904d-61b1333ab206 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061003170056/https://www.rwanational.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=RWA&WebKey=18bbfbec-455e-43ff-904d-61b1333ab206 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2006-10-03 | accessdate = 2007-04-16 }}</ref>

Despite the popularity of this popular meaning of Romance, other works are still referred to as romances because of their uses of other elements descended from the medieval romance, or from the Romantic movement:  larger-than-life heroes and heroines, drama and adventure, marvels that may become fantastic, themes of honor and loyalty, or fairy-tale-like stories and story settings.  Shakespeare's later comedies, such as ''[[The Tempest]]'' or ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' are sometimes called his [[Shakespeare's late romances|romances]].  Modern works may differentiate from love-story as romance into different genres, such as [[planetary romance]] or [[Ruritanian romance]].  [[Science fiction]] was, for a time, termed [[scientific romance]], and [[gaslamp fantasy]] is sometimes termed gaslight romance.  [[Flannery O'Conner]], writing of the use of grotesque in fiction, talked of its use in "the modern romance tradition."{{sfn|O'Connor|1984|p=39}}
