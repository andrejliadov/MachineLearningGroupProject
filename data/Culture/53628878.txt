'''Cognitive adequacy''' is a term proposed by [[Rein Raud]] as a standard of judging [[Bandwagon effect|cultural phenomena]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture|last=Raud|first=Rein|publisher=Polity Books|year=2016|isbn=9781509511242|location=Cambridge|pages=46â€“48}}</ref> According to this method, a cultural phenomenon is cognitively adequate if it provides the means of solving certain problems in a certain [[Social environment|socio-cultural context]]. This is true even when that solution is, according to other criteria, wrong. For example, before the [[Great Depression]] in the US many people thought that it is cognitively adequate to think of getting rich quickly through [[land speculation]]. All cultural phenomena are replaced by others when they are no longer cognitively adequate. For example, when a community has embraced a new religion, or when science has displaced religion as the primary explanatory discourse for their world.
