'''Hypermobile''' travelers are "highly mobile individuals" who take "frequent trips, often over great distances." They "account for a large share of the overall kilometres travelled, especially by air."<ref name="gossling"/> These people contribute significantly to the overall amount of [[airmiles]] flown within a given society.<ref>Høyer, K. G. and Næss, P. (2001). Sustainable Tourismர or Sustainable Mobility? The Norwegian Case. ''Journal of Sustainable Tourism'', 8, 147-160. ''[http://www.informaworld.com/index/908038833.pdf]''</ref>  Although concerns over hypermobility apply to several modes of transport, the [[environmental impact of aviation]] and especially its [[greenhouse gas emissions]] have brought particular focus on flying.<ref>Anderson K, Bows A (2008).

''[http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/kevin-anderson-2.ppt]''</ref> Among the reasons for this focus is that these emissions, because they are made at high altitude, have a climate impact that is commonly estimated to be 2.7 higher than the same emissions if made at ground-level.<ref>Peeters, P. & Williams, V. 2009. Calculating emissions and radiative forcing. P.76 in: Gössling, S. & Upham, P (Eds.), 2009. ''Climate change and aviation: Issues, challenges and solutions''.</ref>

Although the amount of time people have spent in motion has remained constant since 1950, the shift from feet and bicycles to cars and planes has increased the speed of travel fivefold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olis.oecd.org/olis/1999doc.nsf/63c71d2d4054d0fdc125685d0053aee4/c125685b002f5004c125686b005cb510/$FILE/00071363.PDF#page=95|pages=118|author=John Adams|title=Proceedings from the Ottawa Workshop - OECD|date=19 January 2000}}</ref>  This results in the twin effects of wider and shallower regions of social activity around each person (further exacerbated by electronic communication which can be seen as a form of virtual mobility), and a degradation of the social and physical environment brought about by the high speed traffic (as theorised by urban designer [[Donald Appleyard]]).

The changes are brought about locally due to the use of cars and motorways, and internationally by aeroplanes.  Some of the social threats of hypermobility include:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/558292.stm|title=Hypermobility: The road to ruin|date=11 December 1999|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

Widespread [[Internet]] use is seen as a contributory factor towards hypermobility due to the increased ease which it enables travel to be desired and organized.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1668371.stm|title=Gridlock?
