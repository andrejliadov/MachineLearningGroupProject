== History ==
===Origins===
Before the 1980s, "airhead" was general American slang for a ditzy, clumsy or stupid person.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KT-cAQAAQBAJ&q=airhead%20preppy&pg=PA398|title=Oxford Dictionary of Modern Slang|first1=John|last1=Ayto|first2=John|last2=Simpson|date=11 February 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|via=Google Books}}</ref> With the rise of the [[valley girl]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/06z9x0lmcfgo/valley-girl-and-identity-creation/|title="Valley Girl" and identity creation|publisher=}}</ref> and [[preppy]] subculture however, the term was applied to [[cheerleader]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.themycenaean.org/2011/11/cheerleaders-is-the-media-to-blame-for-stereotypes/|title=Cheerleaders: is the media to blame for stereotypes?|first1=Hailey|last1=Stephenson|first2=Senior|last2=Editor|date=14 November 2011|publisher=}}</ref> and [[nouveau riche]] or middle class hangers-on who imitated the [[uptalk]] speech<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/body-odd/we-all-speak-valley-girls-now-f2D11722245|title=We all speak like Valley girls now - NBC News|publisher=}}</ref> and clothing of the upper class popular girls. These airheads, [[Material girl (disambiguation)|material girl]]s or [[wikt:gold digger|gold digger]]s were stereotypically viewed by their classmates as unintelligent, gossipy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086525/|title=Valley Girl|date=29 April 1983|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref> [[bimbettes]] who were interested solely in spreading rumors about their rivals and entering relationships with the wealthy jocks.<ref name="inthe80s.com"/>

===1990s and 2000s===
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, airheads began to be regarded as a distinct, middle class subculture in many suburban American high schools, although appearance-wise they initially differed little from the traditionalist upper class preps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2009/07/16/let_me_school_you_about_preppies/|title=Let me school you about preppies|first=Sam|last=Allis|date=16 July 2009|publisher=|via=The Boston Globe}}</ref> At the time, many wealthy white [[jock (athlete)|jock]]s and younger [[preppies]] had begun imitating urban fashion trends, eschewing the semi-formal conservative look of the 1980s and 1990s in favor of gold [[bling]], expensive [[designer clothes]], [[sneakers (footwear)|sneakers]], dark jeans, and [[sweatpants]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100110062908/http://www.undertheboards.com/excerpts.html Last White Superstar].

===2010s===
The term ''basic bitch'' was coined in 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/basic-class-anxiety|title=What We're Really Afraid Of When We Call Someone "Basic"|website=BuzzFeed News}}</ref> by comedian [[Lil Duval|Lil' Duval]].<ref name=TheCut /><ref name=Alter /> Over the next two years, it appeared in several American rap songs. In the songs "Hard in the Paint" by [[Tyga]] and "I'm not a Human Being" by [[Lil Wayne]], the singers insist that they are not basic bitches, while in the song "Basic Bitch" by [[The Game (rapper)|the Game]], the singer warns others to avoid basic bitches because they are fake.<ref name=TheCut>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/04/basic-bitch-who-is-she.html|title= The 'Basic Bitch': Who Is She?|work=NYMag.com|author= Maggie Lange |date=April 10, 2014|accessdate= September 15, 2014}}</ref>

In 2011, rapper [[Kreayshawn]] debuted her song "Gucci Gucci", which included the chorus: "Gucci Gucci, Louis Louis, Fendi Fendi, Prada ... basic bitches wear that shit so I don't even bother." In 2014 [[CollegeHumor]] released a parody video of a wife being diagnosed by a doctor as a "basic bitch", to the horror of her husband.<ref name=Vox>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/4/22/5636156/basic-a-beginners-guide-to-everyones-favorite-new-insult|title= "Basic": a beginner's guide to everyone's favorite new insult|author= Alex Abad-Santos |work=Vox.com|date=April 22, 2014|accessdate= September 15, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Schreiber /><ref name=Alter />

== Interpretations and criticism ==
Referring to an object or a person as "basic" has a variety of connotations. When used to refer to people, it can mean a criticism of shallow [[Economic materialism|materialism]];{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} in songs that use the term, popular luxury brands like [[Gucci]] and [[Prada]] are referenced to suggest that the people who wear them are buying, rather than earning, their fashionability and [[social status]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/39504-how-to-spot-the-basic-bitch-a-field-guide|title=How to Spot the Basic Bitch|first=Lucia|last=Peters|website=Bustle}}</ref> Decrying the basic bitch's love of bland, boring products like [[Ugg boots]] and [[Starbucks]] [[pumpkin spice latte]]s is a rhetorical technique that allows the singer to appear cooler by comparison.<ref name=AmericanReader>{{cite web|url=http://theamericanreader.com/the-life-and-death-of-american-slang-part-ii-bae-and-basic-bitch/|author=Michael Reid Roberts|work=The American Reader|title=The Life and Death of American Slang, Part II: Bae and Basic Bitch|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}</ref> 

In an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' titled, "Why I'm proud to be a 'basic bitch'", journalist Daisy Buchanan has criticized the cultural trend of using "basic bitch" as an insult, pointing out that those who call out other women for being basic bitches are "dismissing all cultural feminine signifiers" and "make assumptions about a woman's interests and habits based on her sex"<ref name=Guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/14/proud-to-be-basic-bitch|author=Daisy Buchanan|work=The Guardian|title=Why I'm proud to be a 'basic bitch'|date=April 14, 2014|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}</ref> Widespread usage of the term to mock the behavior and interests of girlfriends or wives "conforms to the most bland and uncreative stereotypes of [[Late capitalism|late capitalist]] femininity" and suggests a misogynistic attitude toward all women, according to Michael Reid Roberts in an article in ''The American Reader''.<ref name=AmericanReader />
