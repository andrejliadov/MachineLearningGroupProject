A '''dance film''' (also known as '''screen dance''') is a [[film]] in which [[dance]] is used to reveal the central themes of the film, whether these themes be connected to narrative or story, states of being, or more experimental and formal concerns. In such films, the creation of [[choreography]] typically exists only in film or video. At its best, dance films use filming and editing techniques to create twists in the plotline, multiple layers of reality, and emotional or psychological depth.

Dance film is also known as the [[cinematography|cinematic]] interpretation of existing dance works, originally created for live performance. When existing dance works are modified for the purposes of filming this can involve a wide variety of [[film technique]]s. Depending on the amount of choreographic and/or presentational adjustment an original work is subjected to, the filmed version may be considered as dance for camera. However, these definitions are not agreed upon by those working with dance and film or video.

== Examples ==

Britain's [[DV8 Physical Theatre]], founded by [[Lloyd Newson]], is well known for its film versions of staged works. The reworking of ''[[Enter Achilles]]'' (1995) for film in 1996 is a seminal example of [[Dance for camera]]. Recently acclaimed works include ''[[The Cost of Living (2004 film)|The Cost of Living]]''.<ref>http://www.dv8.co.uk/film/film.folder.html</ref>

Australia's The Physical TV Company, directed by [[Richard James Allen]] and [[Karen Pearlman]], is well known for creating original works that are a sophisticated meeting of the possibilities of cinema with those of dance. Dance films such as ''Rubberman Accepts The Nobel Prize'' (2001), ''No Surrender'' (2002), and ''Down Time Jaz'' (2003) are differing examples of the possibilities of this approach involving comedy, visual effects, drama, and animation.

The [[Machinima]] work by Chris Brandt: '[[Dance, Voldo, Dance]]' which uses computer game characters within the game ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]'' to act out a live, choreographed dance. Two players simultaneously performed the dance piece using game controllers. The work existed as a live performance on screen, and has since been edited and distributed on the internet as a video work.

The British choreographer and film maker [[Liz Aggiss]] has made several dance films, including the multi-award-winning ''Motion Control'' (2002), commissioned by BBC Dance for Camera.<ref name="Motion">[http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/alumni-arts/liz-aggiss/motion-control ''Motion Control'' documentation on the University of Brighton website]</ref> In 2012, on ARTE TV, she gave [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2Y5BKlYgJk&t=332s an interview] in which she talked about screen dance and its ability to place the camera anywhere in relation to the dancer's body. ''Motion Control'' featured 'a glammed up Aggiss, fixed to the spot in nameless, enclosed space, and the camera diving and circling around here. The camera lunges at speed towards the centre of her body like a ravenous carnivorous plant, and Aggiss battles against it with all the wiles of a performer.'<ref name="3dqueen55">Lizzy Le Quesne, 'Liz Aggiss: The 3D Queen of Brighton', Ballet Tanz Jahrbuch, 2005, p55</ref>

Billy Cowie, who collaborated with Aggiss from 1982 to 2003, is a pioneer of 3D Dance films, shown as installations in galleries. His works include ''The Revery Alone''. ''In the Flesh'', ''Tango de Soledad'', and ''Jenseits''.<ref>[http://www.billycowie.com/ Billy Cowie's website]</ref>
