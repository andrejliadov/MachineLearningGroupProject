An '''animated series''' is a set of [[Animation|animated]] works with a common series title, usually related to one another. These [[episode]]s should typically share the same main characters, some different secondary characters and a basic theme. Series can have either a finite number of episodes like a [[miniseries]], a definite end, or be open-ended, without a predetermined number of episodes. They can be broadcast on [[television]], shown in [[movie theatre]]s, released [[direct-to-video]] or on the [[internet]]. Like animated films, animated series can be of a wide variety of [[List of genres|genres]] and can also have different [[demographic]] [[target audience]]s, from [[male]]s to [[female]]s ranging [[children]] to [[adult animation|adults]].

{{see also|List of animated television series}}
Animated [[television program|television series]] are regularly presented and can appear as much as up to once a week or daily during a prescribed [[time slot]]. The time slot may vary including morning, like [[saturday-morning cartoon]]s, prime time, like [[prime time cartoon]]s, to late night, like [[late night anime]]. They may also be broadcast on weekdays ([[weekday cartoon]]s) or only on weekends.

The duration of each episode varies depending on the series. Traditionally, series are produced as complete half-hour or nearly half-hour programs; however, many are produced as animated [[Short film|shorts]] of 10–11 minutes, which can then paired with other shorts to fill a set time period. If on television 15-20 minutes based on commercial time. A full half hour would cut into advertisement time frames. Note that Netflix and other streaming companies that don't show commercials may require a full 30 minute cartoon the length depends on the company that airs the cartoon. There are also some short series with a length of approximately five minutes; these have recently become more common in [[anime|Japanese Animation]]

Animated television series had historically been used for [[comedy]], like the [[cartoon]]s, a piece of art, usually developed for humorous intent, and so, called cartoon series.
