The '''''beoseon''''' ({{IPA-ko|pʌ.sʌn}}) is a type of paired [[sock]]s worn with ''[[hanbok]]'', [[Korea]]n traditional clothing and is made for protection, warmth, and style.<ref name="nfm">{{cite web|url=http://www.nfm.go.kr:8090/english/search/sch_src/full.cgi?v_kw_str=&v_db=2&v_doc_no=00000220 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722140420/http://www.nfm.go.kr:8090/english/search/sch_src/full.cgi?v_kw_str=&v_db=2&v_doc_no=00000220 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-22 |title=Beoseon (Korean socks) |publisher=[[National Museum of Korea]]}}</ref> It is also called {{transl|ko|jokui}} (족의, {{linktext|足|衣}}), ''jokgeon'' (족건, {{linktext|足|件}}) or ''mal'' (말, {{linktext|襪}}) in [[hanja]]. According to a book titled {{transl|ko|Hunmong jahoe}} (훈몽자회,訓蒙字會) written by Choe Sejin (최세진,崔世珍) in 1527 during the reign of [[King Jungjong]] of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392 - 1910), {{transl|ko|beoseon}} was called {{transl|ko|"bosyeonmal"}} (보션말), so it may be called by the name before the time.<ref name="Doosan entry">{{cite web|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&MAS_IDX=101013000808572 |title=Beoseon (버선) |publisher=[[Doosan Encyclopedia]] |language=Korean}}</ref>

It is not clear when {{transl|ko|beoseon}} first began to be worn, but ancient {{transl|ko|beoseon}} is assumed to be a form extended from a [[trouser]] or ''[[bojagi]]'' (wrapping clothes) for protecting the foot. During the period of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] (57 BC – 668 AD), {{transl|ko|beonseon}} made of silk was worn but it was limited by social class. In the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] period, ''beoseon'' made of a white fabric was usually worn regardless of class except special occasions.<ref name="EncyKorea">{{cite web|url=http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=242334&v=46 |title=Beoseon (버선) |publisher=[[Empas]] / [[EncyKorea]] |language=Korean}}</ref>

The types of ''beoseon'' can be varied by purpose, shape, and sewing technique. ''Goteun beoseon'' (곧은버선) or also called ''godeulmok beoseon'' (고들목버선) and ''nuin beoseon'' (누인버선) are defined by shape.<ref name="Doosan entry" />

According to sewing technique, ''beoseon'' is divided into ''som beoseon'', ''gyeop beoseon'', ''hot beoseon'', ''nubi beoseon'', and ''tarae beoseon''. ''Som beoseon'' (솜버선) is composed of the outer fabric and cotton (''som'' in Korean) as a [[Batting (material)|batting]] to give foot warmth and style. ''Gyeop beoseon'' (겹버선) is made with two layers (''gyeop'') of a fabric without stuffing the inside. ''Hot beoseon'' (홑버선) is made with one layer (''hot'') and worn as an inner sock to prevent the outer ''beoseon'' from getting dirty. ''Nubi beoseon'' (누비버선) is made by quilting (''nubi'') and usually worn for protection against the cold during winter. The ''beoseon'' is considered practical because of the easiness to handle after cleaning although the running stitches can be broken or it is stiff than other ''beoseon''. ''Tarae beoseon'' (타래버선) is decorative socks for children. After quilted, ''tarae beosoen'' is embroidered with strings in various colors, and a string is attached to each portion of ankle to bind them at the front.<ref name="EncyKorea" />

Although the shape of ''beoseon'' does not reflect gender, ''beoseon'' for men have a straighter seam than that of women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.kbs.co.kr/korea/culture/clothing/ink_clt.html|publisher=KBS World|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317124313/http://english.kbs.co.kr/korea/culture/clothing/ink_clt.html|archivedate=2008-03-17|accessdate=2013-10-17|title=Traditional clothing}}</ref>
