According to critics of the practice, cultural appropriation differs from [[acculturation]], [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or equal cultural exchange in that this appropriation is a form of [[colonialism]]. When cultural elements are copied from a minority culture by members of a dominant culture, these elements are used outside of their original cultural context—sometimes even against the expressly stated wishes of members of the originating culture.<ref name=Guardian /><ref name="Houska">{{cite web |last1=Houska |first1=Tara |title='I Didn't Know' Doesn't Cut It Anymore |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/16/houska-i-didnt-know-doesnt-cut-it-anymore-160051 |website=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]] |access-date=April 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419132337/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/16/houska-i-didnt-know-doesnt-cut-it-anymore-160051 |archive-date=2015-04-19 |url-status=dead}}

They argue that mutual exchange happens on an "even playing field", whereas appropriation involves pieces of an oppressed culture being taken out of context by a people who have historically oppressed those they are taking from, and who lack the cultural context to properly understand, respect, or utilize these elements.<ref name="Culture and cultural appropriation" /><ref name=Scafidi />

Another view of cultural appropriation is that calling upon it to criticise is "a deeply conservative project", despite progressive roots, that "first seeks to preserve in formaldehyde the content of an established culture and second tries [to] prevent others from interacting with that culture".<ref name=Bogeyman>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-22/berg-cultural-appropriation-is-bad/7047004 |title=Is cultural appropriation the bogeyman it's made out to be? |last=Berg |first=Chris |work=The Drum |date=December 21, 2015 |access-date=April 19, 2016}}</ref> Proponents of this view consider cultural appropriation as often benign or mutually beneficial, citing mutation, product diversity, technological diffusion, and cultural empathy among its benefits.<ref name=Noah>{{cite web |work=Noahpinion |url=http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/cultural-appropriation-is-great.html?m=1 |title=Cultural appropriation is great! |last=Smith |first=Noah |date=December 19, 2015 |access-date=April 19, 2016}}</ref> For example, the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' used elements from [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', which itself used elements from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]; culture in the aggregate is arguably better off for each instance of appropriation. Fusion between cultures has produced such foods as [[American Chinese cuisine]], modern Japanese [[sushi]], and [[bánh mì]], each of which is sometimes argued to reflect part of its respective culture's identity.<ref name=Bogeyman />

== Academic study ==
Cultural appropriation is a relatively recent subject of academic study.
The term emerged in the 1980s, in discussions of post-colonial critiques of Western expansionism,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095652789|title=Cultural appropriation – Oxford Reference|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref> though the concept had been explored earlier, such as in "Some General Observations on the Problems of Cultural Colonialism" by Kenneth Coutts‐Smith in 1976.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=Hutchinson>{{Cite journal |last1=Hutchinson |first1=John |last2=Hiller |first2=Susan |s2cid=195026418 |date=1992 |title=The Myth of Primitivism|journal=Circa|issue=61|pages=49|doi=10.2307/25557703|issn=0263-9475|jstor=25557703 }}</ref>

Cultural and racial theorist [[George Lipsitz]] has used the term "strategic anti-essentialism" to refer to the calculated use of a cultural form, outside of one's own, to define oneself or one's group. Strategic anti-essentialism can be seen in both minority cultures and majority cultures, and is not confined only to the use of the other. However, Lipsitz argues, when the majority culture attempts to strategically anti-essentialize itself by appropriating a minority culture, it must take great care to recognize the specific socio-historical circumstances and significance of these cultural forms so as not to perpetuate the already existing majority vs. minority unequal power relations.<ref>{{cite book|title=Technoliteracy, Discourse, and Social Practice: Frameworks and Applications in the Digital Age| editor=Darren Lee Pullen| publisher=IGI Global| date=2009| isbn=978-1-60566-843-7| pages=312| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqJ3mKb41UsC&q=strategic+anti+essentialism+lipsitz&lpg=PA41}}</ref>

=== Art, literature, iconography, and adornment ===
A common example of cultural appropriation is the adoption of the [[iconography]] of another culture, and using it for purposes that are unintended by the original culture or even offensive to that culture's [[mores]]. Examples include sports teams using [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribal names or images as mascots; wearing jewelry or fashion with religious symbols such as the [[war bonnet]],<ref name=Keene1 /> [[medicine wheel]], or cross without any belief in the religion behind them; and copying iconography from another culture's history such as [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] tribal tattoos, [[Chinese characters]], or [[Celtic art]] worn without regard to their original cultural significance. Critics of the practice of cultural appropriation contend that divorcing this iconography from its cultural context or treating it as [[kitsch]] risks offending people who venerate and wish to preserve their cultural traditions.<ref name=Keene1 /><ref name=MTV1>Ehrlich, Brenna (June 4, 2014) "[http://www.mtv.com/news/1837578/why-you-should-not-wear-headdresses/ Here's Why You Shouldn't Wear A Native American Headdress] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117151650/http://www.mtv.com/news/1837578/why-you-should-not-wear-headdresses/ |date=November 17, 2016 }}" for [[MTV]] News.</ref><ref name="EOnline1">Freda, Elizabeth (Jul. 28, 2014) "[http://www.eonline.com/news/563845/music-festival-is-banning-cultural-appropriation-aka-hipsters-wearing-native-american-headdresses Music Festival Is Banning Cultural Appropriation, aka Hipsters Wearing Native American Headdresses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507210844/http://www.eonline.com/news/563845/music-festival-is-banning-cultural-appropriation-aka-hipsters-wearing-native-american-headdresses |date=May 7, 2016 }}" for ''EOnline''.</ref><ref name=Zimmerman>Zimmerman, Amy (June 4, 2014) "[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/04/pharrell-harry-styles-and-native-american-appropriation.html Pharrell, Harry Styles, and Native American Appropriation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409140437/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/04/pharrell-harry-styles-and-native-american-appropriation.html |date=April 9, 2016 }}" for [[The Daily Beast]].</ref>

Historically, some of the most hotly debated cases of cultural appropriation have occurred in places where cultural exchange is the highest, such as along the trade routes in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe.

Many Native Americans have criticized what they deem to be cultural appropriation of their [[sweat lodge]] and [[vision quest]] ceremonies by non-Natives, and even by tribes who have not traditionally had these ceremonies. They contend that there are serious safety risks whenever these events are conducted by those who lack the many years of training and cultural immersion required to lead them safely, pointing to the [[Sweat lodge#Risks|deaths or injuries]] in 1996, 2002, 2004, and several high-profile [[James Arthur Ray#Sweat lodge deaths|deaths in 2009]].<ref name="Dehydration and heat-related death">{{cite news|first=RW|last=Byard|work=Forensic Science SA|title=Dehydration and heat-related death: sweat lodge syndrome|date=2005-09-26|pmid=8}}</ref><ref name="2 die in new-age sweat lodge">{{cite news|first=Suzanne|last=Herel|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|title=2 seeking spiritual enlightenment die in new-age sweat lodge|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/06/27/BA212763.DTL|date=2002-06-27|access-date=2006-09-26}}</ref><ref name="Taliman2">{{citation | first = Valerie | last = Taliman | title = Selling the sacred | publisher = Indian Country Today | url = http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ict_sbc/selling-the-sacred | date = 13 October 2009 | access-date = 22 October 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120724043328/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ict_sbc/selling-the-sacred/ | archive-date = 24 July 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first = Bob | last = Goulais | title = Editorial: Dying to experience native ceremonies | newspaper = North Bay Nugget | date = 2009-10-24 | url = http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2144903 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120906072559/http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2144903 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-09-06 }}</ref><ref>Hocker, Lindsay.

=== Hairstyles, makeup and body modifications ===
* The leaders of [[ancient Israel]] condemned the adoption of Egyptian and Canaanite practices, especially cutting the hair short or shaving the beard. At the same time, the Old Testament distinguishes the religious [[circumcision]] of the [[Hebrew]]s from cultures, such as the Egyptians, where the practice had aesthetic or practical purposes.
* During the early 16th century, European men imitated the short [[regular haircut]]s and beards on rediscovered [[Ancient Greek]] and Roman statues. The curled hair favoured by the [[Regency era]] [[dandy]] [[Beau Brummel]] was also inspired by the classical era.
* During the 17th century, [[Louis XIV]] began wearing [[wig]]s to conceal his baldness. Like many other French fashions, these were quickly appropriated by [[baroque era]] courtiers in England and the rest of Europe, to the extent that men often [[head shaving|shaved their heads]] to ensure their wig fitted properly.
* American soldiers during [[World War II]] appropriated the [[Mohawk hairstyle]] of the Native American tribe of the same name to intimidate their enemies. These were later worn by 1950s [[jazz]] musicians like [[Sonny Rollins]], and the [[1980s fashion|1980s]] [[punk subculture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atane.tumblr.com/post/2897620329/sonny-rollins-wore-a-mohawk-hairstyle-long-before|title=Audiophile Life|website=Audiophile Life|access-date=27 June 2017}}</ref>

While the history of colonization and [[marginalization]] is not unique to the Americas, the practice of non-Native sports teams deriving team names, imagery, and mascots from indigenous peoples is still common in the United States and Canada, and has persisted to some extent despite protests from Indigenous groups.

Other schools retain their names because they were founded for the education of Native Americans, and continue to have a significant number of indigenous students.

In other former colonies in Asia, Africa, and South America, the adoption of indigenous names for majority indigenous teams is also found. There are also ethnically-related team names derived from prominent immigrant populations in the area, such as the [[Boston Celtics]], the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]], and the [[History of the Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota Vikings]].

The [[2018 Commonwealth Games]] to be held on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in Australia from 4 April 2018 has named its mascot [https://web.archive.org/web/20170404132047/https://shop.gc2018.com/collections/mascot-1 Borobi], the local [[Yugambeh people|Yugambeh]] word for "koala," and has sought to trademark the word through [https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/search/view/1762487?q=borobi IP Australia]. The application is being opposed by a Yugambeh cultural heritage organisation, which argues that the Games organising committee used the word without proper consultation with the Yugambeh people.

The term [[wigger]] (common spelling "wigga") is a slang term for a white person who adopts the mannerisms, [[African American Vernacular English|language]], and [[Hip hop fashion|fashions]] associated with [[African-American culture]], particularly [[hip hop]], and, in Britain, the [[Grime (music)|grime]] scene, often implying the imitation is being done badly, although usually with sincerity rather than mocking intent.<ref>Bernstein, Nell: ''Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers'', 5th ed. 607</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.reference.com/browse/wigger |title=Wigger |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2015-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/wigger |title=wigger – definition of wigger by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |access-date=2015-07-01}}</ref> Wigger is a [[portmanteau]] of ''white'' and ''[[nigger]]'' or ''[[nigga]],'' and the related term wangsta is a mashup of ''wannabe'' or ''white'', and ''[[gangsta rap|gangsta]]''. Among black hip-hop fans, the word "nigga" can sometimes be considered a friendly greeting, but when used by white people as well as non-black [[people of color]], it is usually viewed as offensive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.09.98/cover/nigger-9814.html|title=Metroactive News & Issues – The Word 'Nigger'|website=www.metroactive.com|access-date=27 June 2017}}</ref> "Wigger" may be derogatory, reflecting stereotypes of African-American, [[black British]], and white culture (when used as synonym of [[white trash]]). The term is sometimes used by other white people to belittle the person perceived as "acting black", but it is widely used by African Americans like [[50 Cent]] offended by the wigga's perceived demeaning of black people and culture.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xmmNfoefAAC&pg=PA113|title=Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wankstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America|first=Bakari|last=Kitwana|date=30 May 2006|publisher=Basic Books|access-date=27 June 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=978-0-465-03747-6}}</ref>

The phenomenon of white people adopting elements of black culture has been prevalent at least since [[slavery]] was [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in the [[Western world]]. The concept has been documented in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other white-majority countries. An early form of this was the ''white negro'' in the [[jazz]] and [[swing music]] scenes of the 1920s and 1930s, as examined in the 1957 [[Norman Mailer]] essay "[[The White Negro]]". It was later seen in the [[zoot suit]]er of the 1930s and 1940s, the [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] of the 1940s, the [[beatnik]] of the 1950s–1960s, the [[blue-eyed soul]] of the 1970s, and the hip hop of the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, an article in the UK newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' described the phenomenon of white, middle-class kids who were "wannabe Blacks".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/wiggers-just-wannabe-black-white-middleclass-kids-are-adopting-black-street-style-and-chilling-out-to-rap-music-david-usborne-reports-from-washington-1462591.html|title=Wiggers just wannabe black: White middle-class kids are adopting black street style and chilling out to rap music.|date=1993-08-22|publisher=Independent.co.uk|access-date=2015-07-01}}</ref> 2005 saw the publication of ''Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wangstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America'' by Bakari Kitwana, "a culture critic who's been tracking American hip hop for years"''.''<ref>{{cite web|last=Kitwana |first=Bakari |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4773208 |title=Why White Kids Love Hip Hop |publisher=Npr.org |access-date=2015-07-01}}</ref>

Robert A. Clift's documentary ''Blacking Up: Hip-Hop's Remix of Race and Identity'' questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture.

=== Indigenous cultures ===
Since the Middle Ages, non-Slavic rulers in Eastern Europe have appropriated the culture of their subjects to gain their trust. The [[Viking]]s in [[Kievan Rus]] imitated the costume and [[czupryna|shaven heads]] of the [[Slav]]ic population, converted to [[Orthodox Christianity]], and [[Varangians|Russified their original Scandinavian names]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ji0DEAAAQBAJ Varangians: In God's Holy Fire, p.172]</ref>

Among critics, the misuse and misrepresentation of [[indigenous culture]] is seen as an exploitative form of colonialism, and one step in the destruction of indigenous cultures.<ref name="Wernitznig2">Wernitznig, Dagmar, ''Europe's Indians, Indians in Europe: European Perceptions and Appropriations of Native American Cultures from Pocahontas to the Present''. University Press of America, 2007: p.132. "What happens further in the [[Plastic Shaman]]'s [fictitious] story is highly irritating from a perspective of cultural hegemony. The Injun elder does not only willingly share their spirituality with the white intruder but, in fact, must come to the conclusion that this intruder is as good an Indian as they are themselves. Regarding Indian spirituality, the Plastic Shaman even out-Indians the actual ones. The messianic element, which Plastic Shamanism financially draws on, is installed in the Yoda-like elder themselves. They are the ones – while melodramatically parting from their spiritual offshoot – who urge the Plastic Shaman to share their gift with the rest of the world. Thus Plastic Shamans wipe their hands clean of any megalomaniac or missionizing undertones. Licensed by the authority of an Indian elder, they now have every right to spread their wisdom, and if they make (quite more than) a buck with it, then so be it.—The neocolonial ideology attached to this scenario leaves less room for cynicism."</ref>

The results of this use of indigenous knowledge have led some tribes, and the [[United Nations General Assembly]], to issue several declarations on the subject. The ''Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality'' includes the passage:
{{quote|We assert a posture of zero-tolerance for any "white man's shaman" who rises from within our own communities to "authorize" the expropriation of our ceremonial ways by non-Indians; all such "[[Plastic shaman|plastic medicine men]]" are enemies of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people.<ref name="LDNwar1" /><ref name="taliman1" />|}}Article 31 1 of the United Nations ''[[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]'' states:{{quote|Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions, as well as the manifestations of their sciences, technologies and cultures, including human and genetic resources, seeds, medicines, knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora, oral traditions, literatures, designs, sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.<ref name="UNDRIP" />|}}

In 2015, a group of Native American academics and writers issued a statement against the [[Rainbow Family]] members whose acts of "cultural exploitation... dehumanize us as an indigenous Nation because they imply our culture and humanity, like our land, is anyone's for the taking."<ref name="HeSapa">Estes, Nick; et al "[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/14/protect-he-sapa-stop-cultural-exploitation Protect He Sapa, Stop Cultural Exploitation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303091719/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/07/14/protect-he-sapa-stop-cultural-exploitation |date=March 3, 2016 }}" at ''[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]''. 14 July 2015.

In writing about [[Indigenous intellectual property]] for the [[Native American Rights Fund]] (NARF), board member Professor Rebecca Tsosie stresses the importance of these property rights being held collectively, not by individuals:

<blockquote>The long-term goal is to actually have a legal system, and certainly a treaty could do that, that acknowledges two things. Number one, it acknowledges that indigenous peoples are peoples with a right to self-determination that includes governance rights over all property belonging to the indigenous people. And, number two, it acknowledges that indigenous cultural expressions are a form of intellectual property and that traditional knowledge is a form of intellectual property, but they are collective resources – so not any one individual can give away the rights to those resources. The tribal nations actually own them collectively.<ref name=Tsosie>{{cite web|url=https://www.narf.org/tsosie-intellectual-property/ |title=Current Issues in Intellectual Property Rights to Cultural Resources|last=Tsosie |first=Rebecca |work=Native American Rights Fund|date=June 25, 2017|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>

For example, the government of [[Ghana]] has been accused of cultural appropriation in adopting the Caribbean [[Emancipation Day]] and marketing it to African American tourists as an "African festival".<ref>{{cite journal| last=Hasty| first=J | title=Rites of Passage, Routes of Redemption: Emancipation Tourism and the Wealth of Culture| journal=Africa Today| volume=49| issue=3, Fall 2002| pages=47–76| url=https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20043196408| doi=10.1353/at.2003.0026 | year=2002 | s2cid=144339432 }}</ref>

In 2003, [[Prince Harry]] of the [[British royal family]] used [[Indigenous Australian art]] motifs in a painting for a school project. One Aboriginal group labelled it "misappropriation of our culture", saying that to Aboriginal people, the motifs have symbolic meanings "indicative of our spiritualism", whereas when non-Aborigines use the motifs they are simply "painting a pretty picture".<ref name=RoyalRipOff>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/20/1061261182182.html |title=A right royal rip-off |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=2003-08-20 |access-date=2016-09-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818171622/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/20/1061261182182.html |archive-date=2014-08-18 }}</ref>

When [[Selena Gomez]] wore a [[Bindi (decoration)|bindi]] during a performance, there was debate on her reasoning behind wearing the culture specific piece.

In June 2019, [[Kim Kardashian|Kim Kardashian West]] was accused of cultural appropriation after announcing her shapewear line KIMONO, a pun on her first name. Critics argued that her goal to trademark the term was disrespectful to Japanese culture, as her filing for the international trademarking of the term "kimono" would prevent Japanese people from selling [[kimono|their traditional garb under the same name]]. The issue sparked the emergence of a [[Twitter]] hashtag, #KimOhNo, where Japanese people - both native and diaspora - tried to explain the cultural significance the kimono has in their culture. Additionally, a petition was started on [[Change.org]], hoping to prevent West from gaining the trademark. The petitioner, Sono Fukunishi, argued that allowing West to obtain the trademark would allow foreigners to begin associating the original kimono with underwear. West later received a letter from Kyoto's mayor, [[Daisaku Kadokawa]], asking her to reconsider trademarking the name.<ref>https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/07/01/national/kyoto-mayor-asks-kardashian-west-reconsider-choice-kimono-underwear-brand/</ref><ref>https://qz.com/quartzy/1656086/japanese-mayor-writes-to-kkw-about-her-kimono-shapewear-brand/</ref> Kyoto is considered to be the kimono capital of the world.<ref>https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/japan-official-kardashian-west-kimono-belongs-japan-64079461</ref> West has since announced to rebrand her shapewear under the name SKIMS.<ref>https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/a28244665/kim-kardashian-kimono-new-name/</ref><ref>https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/07/236344/kim-kardashian-kimono-shapwear-line</ref>

== Criticism of the concept ==

[[John McWhorter]], a professor at [[Columbia University]], criticized the concept in 2014, arguing that cultural borrowing and cross-fertilization is a generally positive thing and is something which is usually done out of admiration, and with no intent to harm, the cultures being imitated; he also argued that the specific term "appropriation", which can mean theft, is misleading when applied to something like culture that is not seen by all as a limited resource.<ref name=McWhorter>{{cite web |last1=McWhorter |first1=John |title=You Can't 'Steal' A Culture: In Defense of Cultural Appropriation |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/15/you-can-t-steal-a-culture-in-defense-of-cultural-appropriation.html |website=The Daily Beast |access-date=October 20, 2014 |author1-link=John McWhorter}}</ref> In 2018, conservative columnist [[Jonah Goldberg]] described cultural appropriation as a positive thing and dismissed opposition to it as a product of some people's desire to be offended.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Goldberg |first1=Jonah |author-link1=Jonah Goldberg |title=Cultural-appropriation outrage shows people are desperate to be offended |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-goldberg-cultural-appropriation-offended-rules-0507-20180504-story.html |access-date=27 April 2020 |work=Chicago Tribune |date=6 May 2018}}</ref> [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]], ethics columnist for the ''New York Times'', said that the term cultural appropriation incorrectly labels contemptuous behavior as a [[property crime]].

Rather it's: Are my actions disrespectful?"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/magazine/should-i-tell-my-aunt-that-her-costume-is-racist.html?searchResultPosition=1 |title=Should I Tell My Aunt That Her Costume Is Racist?}}</ref>
