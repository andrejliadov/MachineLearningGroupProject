'''''13 Japanese Birds''''' is a 15 album series by the Japanese noise musician [[Merzbow]]. It was inspired by [[Olivier Messiaen]]'s ''[[Catalogue d'oiseaux]]'' (Catalog of birds), but has no direct musical relationship.<ref name="MMint">{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Batty |title=''Interview: ''The Birds of Noise'' |url=http://musiquemachine.com/articles/articles_template.php?id=150 |publisher=[[Musique Machine]] |accessdate=March 17, 2010}}</ref>

==Release history==
The series originally consisted of 13 albums released on a monthly basis from January 2009 to January 2010. They were also recorded one a month, and Masami Akita frequently revisited older recordings. It was also part of his then-recent return to live drums.<ref name="MMint"/> Jenny Akita's cover art depicts illustrated birds on top of photographs. Each CD is limited to 1,000 copies.

The series was also available by subscription; as just the CDs, or with a custom-made bamboo box. Also available only with purchase of the box was an acrylic-on-bamboo painting by Akita himself.<ref name="birdbox">{{cite web |title=''Bamboo Box release page'' |url=http://www.importantrecords.com/bird_box/bird_box_details.html |publisher=Important Records|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303122651/http://www.importantrecords.com/bird_box/bird_box_details.html|archivedate=March 3, 2009}}</ref>

In March 2010, Important released ''Ecobag/13 Birds in a Bag +1'', this set included the original 13 CDs, a bonus CDR of additional material from the sessions, and a piece of original xerox art made by Akita in the mid-90s. All packaged together in a [[tote bag]] and limited to 200 copies.<ref name="ecobag">{{cite web |title=''Ecobag release page'' |url=http://www.importantrecords.com/releases/imprec294_release_page.htm |work=Important Records |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724013931/http://www.importantrecords.com/releases/imprec294_release_page.htm |archivedate=July 24, 2010}}</ref> After the ''Ecobag'' sold out, the label released the ''Ecoblock'' or ''Bird Block'' in April 2012, with just the original 13 albums and a T-shirt.<ref>{{cite web |title=''imprec294 Merzbow, Bird Block 13CD'' |url=http://importantrecords.com/imprec/imprec294 |work=Important Records |accessdate=April 24, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326020106/http://importantrecords.com/imprec/imprec294 |archive-date=March 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2009, Important announced that an [[LP record|LP]] named ''[[Jigokuhen (album)|Jigokuhen]]'' would be released to celebrate the completion of the series.<ref>[https://www.twitter.com/imprec/status/6804820197 Jigokuhen announcement on Twitter]</ref> Originally scheduled for the first anniversary of the completion of the original series (January 2011), but it was delayed until March.
