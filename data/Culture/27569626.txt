Burko's early work consisted of drawings and paintings of iconic American landscapes such as the [[Grand Canyon]] and [[Lake Powell]], as well as international sources such as the [[French Alps]]. In 1977, while flying with [[Light and Space]] artist [[James Turrell]] in his [[Helio Courier]] over the [[Grand Canyon]], Burko captured her first aerial photographs of the landscape.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.percontra.net/archive/17burko.htm|title=Diane Burko, The Per Contra Interview with Miriam N.

Past subjects include the landscape of [[Bucks County]], Pennsylvania, the coast of California, the [[fjords]] of [[Scandinavia]], and the [[volcanoes]] of Hawaii, Italy and Iceland. In 2000, this led to Burko's interest in [[volcanic]] [[tectonics]] and [[glacial geology]], as well as [[climate change]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-diane-burko-17417#transcript|title=Oral history interview with Diane Burko, 2016 November 4–14|website=www.aaa.si.edu|language=en|access-date=September 4, 2018}}</ref>

Burko depicts scientific data through visual motifs, incorporating [[Landsat program|Landsat]] imagery, mapping data<ref>{{Cite book|title=Landscape into eco art : articulations of nature since the '60s|last=Cheetham|first=Mark A.|publisher=Penn State University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780271080031|location=University Park, Pennsylvania|oclc=1004957218}}</ref> and U.S.G.S. repeat photography archives.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Diane Burko : glacial shifts, changing perspectives : bearing witness to climate change|last=Ratcliff|first=Carter|publisher=KMW Studio|year=2017|isbn=9780998456409|location=New York}}</ref> From 2007 through 2011, Burko developed the project ''Politics of Snow'', investigating the historical comparisons of [[global climate change]] through images culled from glacial geological data recorded throughout the world.<ref name=":1" /> Other works depict the same location seen from different points in time showing the effects of climate change on a specific site – a method glaciologists call "repeats." Such photo-documents have been shot by scientists and field researchers at [[U.S. Geological Survey]] and [[Byrd Polar Research Center]] at [[The Ohio State University]], such as David Arnold, [[Henry Brecher]], Dan Fagre, [[Ulysses S. Grant IV]], Karen Holzer, Carl Key, Bruce Molnia, Sidney Paige, Tad Pfeffer, [[Lonnie Thompson]] and [[Bradford Washburn]].<ref name=":2" /> [[Judith E. Stein]] observes, "To my horror, I found myself adding my own mental image to each sequence, extrapolating from what [Burko] shows, thereby envisioning the next, un-depicted step in the warming process—our dystopic future."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://judithestein.com/2010/02/01/diane-burko-the-politics-of-snow/|title=Diane Burko, The Politics of Snow|date=February 1, 2010|work=Judith E. Stein|access-date=September 5, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

Since 2013, Burko has embarked on research expeditions to various glaciers and reefs around the world. Through these locations, Burko explores the impacts of climate change with particular emphasis on glacial melt and coral bleaching.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/home/after-years-of-documenting-disappearing-glaciers-diane-burko-shifts-to-barrier-reefs-20170524.html?arc404=true|title=After years of documenting disappearing glaciers, Diane Burko shifts to barrier reefs|work=Philly.com|access-date=September 5, 2018}}</ref> In 2013, Burko traveled to Antarctica in January and the high Arctic in October. The latter was sponsored by the nonprofit organization The Arctic Circle, and was supported by a Fellowship in the Arts, awarded by The Independence Foundation in Philadelphia.<ref>Miguel Tavares,.

In 2015, Burko flew from [[Ushuaia]] to [[El Calafate]] to discover the Patagonian ice field of Argentina. In 2017, her exploration of landscapes affected by climate change continued with New Zealand's [[Fox Glacier|Fox]] and [[Franz Josef Glacier]], along with [[Great Barrier Reef|The Great Barrier Reef]]. This experience marked a shift in her practice from glaciers to reefs.<ref name=":1" />

In January 2018, Diane Burko travelled to [[American Samoa]], [[Oahu]], and [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|Honolulu]] with the non-profit project "Kai 'Apapa," a multimedia exploration of American [[coral reef]] systems, in collaboration with [[Climatology|climatologist]] Samiah Moustafa, composer/video artist [[Christine Southworth]], and composer/clarinetist [[Evan Ziporyn]]. The project aims to raise awareness of the rapid changes to coral reef systems, and present the scientific ramifications through art and performance. The project has received a nearly $31,450 grant from the MAP Fund.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mapfundblog.org/kai-apapa-of-the-reefs-map-2017/|title=Kai 'Apapa: Of the Reefs (MAP 2017)|date=May 2, 2017|work=MAP Fund|access-date=September 4, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

Independently, Burko's recent work includes video and lenticular pieces based on footage from this expedition, alongside paintings of reefs.<ref name=":0" />
