[[France|French]] [[chess]] player '''[[Gilles Andruet]]''', the son of former [[Rallying|rally driver]] [[Jean-Claude Andruet]], was murdered on 22 August 1995. He was drugged before being beaten to death.

== Background ==
In 1993, Gilles Andruet was using a [[Martingale (betting system)|martingale]] betting system that he had designed to win at [[blackjack]]. The system used Andruet's memory, his mathematical prowess, and the [[Card counting|card-counting]] method devised by [[United States|American]] player [[Ken Uston]] to its advantage.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/echec-et-mort-d-un-surdoue_609773.html|title=Echec et mort d'un surdoué|date=1995-09-21|work=LExpress.fr|access-date=2018-09-21|language=fr}}</ref>

In his first year of using the martingale, Andruet won a lot of money and played increasingly often in [[casino]]s around the world, both out of enjoyment for the game and for the financial opportunities on offer. He drew attention to himself through his provocative personality and ended up on casinos’ radars. He was ultimately banned from casino blackjack, being referred to as the “Demon of the Game”. Unable to play blackjack, he switched to [[roulette]]. However, his exceptional memory and mathematical abilities did not give him an advantage in roulette, and he lost much more than he won. His friends tried in vain to dissuade him from playing. In order to sustain his lifestyle, he started consuming and selling drugs, including [[heroin]] and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. This led to the large amount of money won at blackjack rapidly evaporating, and he entered into the [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious cycle]] of [[Problem gambling|gambling addiction]]. He spent more money than he had, took out loans that he could not repay, was banned from holding a bank account (known as ''interdit bancaire'' – literally “bank-barred” – in France),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2006/03/14/58704-le-champion-d-echecs-avait-ete-drogue-et-noye.html|title=Le champion d'échecs avait été drogué et noyé|work=ladepeche.fr|access-date=2018-09-21|language=fr}}</ref> became [[Homelessness|homeless]], and his lifestyle became increasingly chaotic and vulnerable.

On 4 August 1995, Andruet received a [[notary]]’s [[cheque]] of 398,000 [[French franc|francs]] as an advance on an aunt's [[inheritance]]. As he was banned from holding a bank account, he was unable to cash the cheque,<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/auto-addict/actualites/le-mysterieux-meurtre-de-gilles-andruet-rejuge-25-01-2014-1784240_683.php|title=Le mystérieux meurtre de Gilles Andruet rejugé|last=magazine|first=Le Point|date=2014-01-25|work=Le Point|access-date=2018-09-21|language=fr-FR}}</ref> so he asked his casino acquaintances for help. Joseph Liany – a former businessman whom Andruet had met at the casino in [[Enghien-les-Bains]], on the outskirts of [[Paris]], and who was also a frequent gambler – offered Andruet help through his son Franck.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.estrepublicain.fr/actualite/2014/01/30/le-franco-marocain-sacha-rhoul-acquitte-du-meurtre-de-gilles-andruet|title=Le Franco-Marocain Sacha Rhoul acquitté du meurtre de Gilles Andruet|access-date=2018-09-21|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/actu/gilles-andruet-la-derive-d-un-genie-27-01-2014-3531005.php|title=Gilles Andruet, la dérive d'un génie|date=27 January 2014|website=Le Parisien|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref> With Frank Liany as a [[Surety|guarantor]] and [[Law of agency|proxy]],<ref name=":0" /> Andruet was able to open a bank account at [[Morocco|Moroccan]] bank Chaabi (a subsidiary of the [[Banque Populaire du Maroc]]), where he cashed his cheque.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2014/01/30/sacha-rhoul-acquitte-du-meurtre-du-joueur-d-echecs-gilles-andruet_4357497_3224.html|title=Sacha Rhoul acquitté du meurtre du joueur d'échecs Gilles Andruet|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2018-09-21|language=fr-FR}}</ref>

== Murder ==
At around 11 p.m. on 21 August 1995, Gilles Andruet drove his car to a branch of the [[L'Entrecôte|L’Entrecôte]] restaurant chain in Paris to meet Yolanda, a friend who worked as a waitress there. Three men were in the car with him.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2003/11/14/affaire-andruet-temoin-agresse-et-malaise-a-l-audience_451773|title=Affaire Andruet : témoin agressé et malaise à l'audience|work=Libération.fr|access-date=2018-09-21|language=fr}}</ref>

Gilles Andruet's body was discovered by a market trader in the early hours of 22 August 1995, wrapped in a white [[mattress protector]] and half submerged in the river [[Yvette (river)|Yvette]] in [[Saulx-les-Chartreux]], in the [[Essonne]] [[Departments of France|département]] south of Paris. Andruet had been drugged with [[morphine]] and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] – known as a [[Date rape drug|date-rape drug]] – before repeatedly being hit with a [[baseball bat]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2010/03/07/01011-20100307FILWWW00076-l-assassin-presume-de-gandruet-extrade.php|title=L'assassin présumé de G.Andruet extradé|date=2010-03-07|website=FIGARO|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> His car was abandoned a few miles away from where his body was found. There were multiple bloodstains in the car [[Boot (car)|boot]], while a photocopy of the inheritance cheque was found in the [[glove compartment]]. In 2001, [[mitochondrial DNA]] was found on a hair on the mattress protector in which Andruet's body had been wrapped. The DNA was a match to an undetermined person in the Liany family. On 25 August 1995, Franck Liany emptied Andruet's bank account.<ref name=":1" />

=== Suspects ===
Franck Liany was a waiter at ''Golf de l’Étoile'', a sports club and bar-restaurant near the [[Arc de Triomphe]] in central Paris. Sacha Rhoul, the manager of the club, was his cousin: Liany's father and Rhoul's mother are siblings.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Societe/Andruet-Marrakech-echecs-Sacha-Rhoul-152670|title=Affaire Andruet, le coupable arrêté|last=Match|first=Paris|access-date=2018-09-21|language=fr-FR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/essonne-91/jean-claude-andruet-raconte-la-vie-de-son-fils-30-01-2014-3540627.php|title=Saulx-les-Chartreux : Jean-Claude Andruet raconte la vie de son fils|date=30 January 2014|website=Le Parisien|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref>

One night in December 1995, Loïc Simon, a waiter at the sports club, openly complained of having received only 30,000 francs of the promised 50,000 from Joseph Liany for beating to death with a baseball bat a chess player who owed gambling debts to Liany.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2014/01/30/97001-20140130FILWWW00051-proces-andruet-l-accuse-rhoul-fait-bonne-figure.php|title=Procès Andruet: Sacha Rhoul fait bonne figure|date=2014-01-30|website=FIGARO|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> On 14 August 1996, shortly after confessing to murdering Gilles Andruet, Simon committed suicide by [[hanging]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://echecs64.20minutes-blogs.fr/tag/Lo%C3%AFc+Simon|title=Loïc Simon - Echecs 64|website=echecs64.20minutes-blogs.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/le-meurtrier-condamne-a-quinze-ans-de-prison-15-11-2003-2004543426.php|title=Le meurtrier condamné à quinze ans de prison|last=Thomas|first=Sébastien|date=15 November 2003|website=Le Parisien|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/actu/une-procedure-judiciaire-a-rallonges-27-01-2014-3531001.php|title=Une procédure judiciaire à rallonges|date=27 January 2014|website=Le Parisien|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref> Yolanda, the waitress whom Andruet was meeting on the night of his death, gave a witness testimony confirming that Joseph Liany was one of the passengers in Andruet's car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/essonne/le-temoignage-poignant-de-jean-claude-andruet-11-11-2003-2004532074.php|title=Le témoignage poignant de Jean-Claude Andruet|last=Auguy|first=Stéphanie|date=11 November 2003|website=Le Parisien|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref> Following her statement, Yolanda suffered persistent anonymous phone calls in which [[death threat]]s were made to her and her child.

== Legal proceedings ==

=== First trial (2003) ===
The first trial was held in November 2003. Sacha Rhoul was not called and did not attend. Rhoul's cousin, Franck Liany, was charged with receiving a murder weapon, while Rhoul's uncle, Joseph Liany, was charged with the murder of Gilles Andruet. Both defendants pleaded not guilty and blamed each other.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2003/11/15/proces-andruet-quinze-ans-de-reclusion_451841|title=Procès Andruet: quinze ans de réclusion|work=Libération.fr|access-date=2018-09-21|language=fr}}</ref> 18 witnesses were called, many of whom are believed to have been threatened – they displayed unusual memory lapses or submitted [[medical certificate]]s excusing them from attending court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/seine-et-marne-77/affaire-andruet-le-meurtre-du-champion-d-echecs-reste-impuni-19-07-2016-5977771.php|title=Affaire Andruet : le meurtre du champion d'échecs reste impuni|last=Loisy|first=Florian|date=19 July 2016|website=Le Parisien|access-date=21 September 2018}}</ref> Regardless, Franck Liany was found guilty of receiving a murder weapon and sentenced to 7 years’ imprisonment. Joseph Liany was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment. The latter's conviction rested on witness statements and mitochondrial DNA extracted from the hair found on the mattress protector. Only Joseph Liany appealed his conviction.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://echecs64.blog.20minutes.fr/archive/2006/04/21/affaire-andruet-un-acquitte-un-condamne%E2%80%A6-par-contumace.html|title=Affaire Andruet : un acquitté, un condamné… par contumace - Echecs 64|website=echecs64.blog.20minutes.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref>

=== Retrial of Joseph Liany (2006) ===
Joseph Liany appealed against his conviction and was granted a retrial in March 2006 at the [[Assizes|Court of Assizes]] of the [[Val-de-Marne]] département. Sacha Rhoul was [[Trial in absentia|tried in absentia]], found guilty and sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20100311.OBS9542/l-extradition-de-rhoul-relance-l-affaire-andruet.html|title=L'extradition de Rhoul relance l'affaire Andruet|work=L'Obs|access-date=2018-09-21|language=fr-FR}}</ref> Despite this, it appeared that Rhoul was living freely in France at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://echecs64.20minutes-blogs.fr/archive/2009/11/16/le-gambit-rhoul-variante-bamberski.html|title=Le Gambit Rhoul, variante Bamberski ? - Echecs 64|website=echecs64.20minutes-blogs.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref>

Joseph Liany's defence relied solely on the fact that the mitochondrial DNA could also belong to Sacha Rhoul, Joseph's nephew. This was enough [[reasonable doubt]] to see Joseph Liany acquitted, to the despair of Jean-Claude Andruet, Gilles’ father.<ref name=":5" />
