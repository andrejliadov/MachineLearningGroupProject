==Classification==
Despite comparisons to [[panic attack]]s, investigators have identified {{lang|es|ataque de nervios}} as a separate syndrome with measured differences in anxiety sensitivity, and types of attacks. Marlene Steinberg, an Associate Research Scientist at Yale University stated that because it is similar to Multiple Personality Disorder, some Hispanics may be misdiagnosed with an {{lang|es|ataque de nervios}} syndrome instead.<ref name="Dissociation" /><ref name=Razzouk/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Keough M.
