'''Arabic literature''' ({{lang-ar|الأدب العربي}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''al-Adab al-‘Arabī'') is the writing, both as [[prose]] and [[poetry]], produced by writers in the [[Arabic language]]. The Arabic word used for literature is ''"[[Adab (Islam)|Adab]]"'', which is derived from a meaning of [[etiquette]], and which implies politeness, culture and enrichment.

Arabic literature emerged in the 5th century with only fragments of the written language appearing before then. The [[Qur'an]], widely regarded as the finest piece of literature in the [[Arabic language]],<ref>Jones, p. ix.</ref> would have the greatest lasting effect on [[Arabic culture]] and its literature. Arabic literature flourished during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], but has remained vibrant to the present day, with poets and prose-writers across the Arab world, as well as in the Arab diaspora, achieving increasing success.

== History ==

=== ''Jahili'' ===
{{Ill|Jahili literature|lt=|ar|أدب جاهلي|WD=}} is the literature of the pre-Islamic period referred to as [[Jahiliyyah|''al-Jahiliyyah'']], or "the time of ignorance".<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last=الفاخوري |first=حنا |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GH6DDwAAQBAJ |title=تاريخ الأدب العربي |date=2014-01-01 |publisher=DMC |language=ar}}</ref> In pre-Islamic Arabia, markets such as [[Souk Okaz|Souq Okaz]], in addition to {{Ill|Souq Majanna|lt=|ar|سوق مجنة|WD=}} and {{Ill|Souq Dhi al-Majāz|lt=|ar|سوق ذي المجاز|WD=}}, were destinations for caravans from throughout the peninsula.<ref name=":0" /> At these markets poetry was recited, and the dialect of the [[Quraysh]], the tribe in control of Souq Okaz of Mecca, became predominant.<ref name=":0" /> 

==== Poetry ====
Notable poets of the pre-Islamic period were [[Abu Layla al-Muhalhel]] and [[Al-Shanfara]].<ref name=":0" /> There were also the poets of the ''[[Mu'allaqat]]'', or "the suspended ones", a group of poems said to have been on display in [[Mecca]].<ref name=":0" /> These poets are [[Imru' al-Qais]], [[Tarafa|Tarafah ibn al-‘Abd]], {{Ill|Abid Ibn al-Abrass|lt=|ar|عبيد بن الأبرص|WD=}}, [[Harith ibn Hilliza]], [[Amr ibn Kulthum]], [[Zuhayr ibn Abi Sulma]], [[Al-Nabigha|Al-Nabigha al-Dhubiyānī]], [[Antara Ibn Shaddad]], [[Al-A'sha|al-A'sha al-Akbar]], and [[Labīd|Labīd ibn Rabī'ah]].<ref name=":0" />

[[Al-Khansa]] stood out in her poetry of ''[[rithā']]'' or [[elegy]].<ref name=":0" /> {{Ill|al-Hutay'a|lt=|ar|الحطيئة|WD=}} was prominent for his ''[[madīh]]'', or "[[panegyric]]", as well as his {{Ill|hijā'|lt=|ar|هجاء (شعر)|WD=|italic=y}}, or "[[invective]]".<ref name=":0" />

==== Prose ====
As the literature of the Jahili period was transmitted orally and not written, prose represents little of what has been passed down.<ref name=":0" /> The main forms were parables ({{lang|ar|المَثَل}} ''al-mathal''), speeches ({{Lang|ar|الخطابة}} ''al-khitāba''), and stories ({{lang|ar|القِصَص}} ''al-qisas'').<ref name=":0" />

{{Ill|Quss Bin Sā'ida|lt=|ar|قس بن ساعدة الإيادي|WD=}} was a notable Arab ruler, writer, and orator.<ref name=":0" /> {{Ill|Aktham Bin Sayfi|lt=|ar|أكثم بن صيفي التميمي|WD=}} was also one of the most famous rulers of the Arabs, as well as one of their most renowned speech-givers.<ref name=":0" />

===The Qur'an===
[[File:Folio Blue Quran Met 2004.88.jpg|thumb|right|The Qur'an is one of the most influential examples of Arabic literature]]

The [[Qur'an]], the main [[Religious text|holy book]] of [[Islam]], had a significant influence on the Arab language, and marked the beginning of [[Islamic literature]]. Muslims believe it was transcribed in the Arabic dialect of the [[Quraysh]], the tribe of [[Muhammad]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web |date=2019-09-08 |title=الوثائقية تفتح ملف "اللغة العربية" |url=https://doc.aljazeera.net/followup/الوثائقية-تفتح-ملف-اللغة-العربية/ |access-date=2020-06-18 |website=الجزيرة الوثائقية |language=ar}}</ref> As Islam spread, the Quran had the effect of unifying and standardizing Arabic.<ref name=":0" />

Not only is the Qur'an the first work of any significant length written in the language, but it also has a far more complicated structure than the earlier literary works with its 114 ''[[sura]]s'' (chapters) which contain 6,236 ''[[ayat]]'' (verses). It contains [[injunction]]s, [[narrative]]s, [[homilies]], [[parable]]s, direct addresses from God, instructions and even comments on itself on how it will be received and understood. It is also admired for its layers of metaphor as well as its clarity, a feature it mentions itself in sura 16:103.

The 92 [[Meccan surah|Meccan suras]], believed to have been revealed to Muhammad in Mecca before the [[Hegira|Hijra]], deal primarily with {{Ill|'usul ad-din|lt=|ar|أصول الدين|WD=}}, or "the principles of religion", whereas the 22 [[Medinan surah|Medinan suras]], believed to have been revealed to him after the Hijra, deal primarily with [[Sharia]] and prescriptions of Islamic life.<ref name=":0" />

The word ''qur'an'' meant "recitation", and in early times the text was transmitted orally. The various tablets and scraps on which its suras were written were compiled under [[Abu Bakr]] (573-634), and first transcribed in unified ''masahif'', or copies of the Qur'an, under [[Uthman]] (576-656).<ref name=":0" />

Although it contains elements of both prose and poetry, and therefore is closest to ''[[Rhymed prose|Saj]]'' or [[rhymed prose]], the Qur'an is regarded as entirely apart from these classifications. The text is believed to be [[divine revelation]] and is seen by [[Muslims]] as being eternal or 'uncreated'. This leads to the doctrine of ''[[i'jaz]]'' or inimitability of the Qur'an which implies that nobody can copy the work's style.

{{quote|Say, Bring you then ten chapters like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than God, if you speak the truth!|sign=11:13}}

This doctrine of ''i'jaz'' possibly had a slight limiting effect on Arabic literature; proscribing exactly what could be written. Whilst Islam allows Muslims to write, read and recite poetry, the Qur'an states in the 26th sura ([[Ash-Shu'ara]] or The Poets) that poetry which is blasphemous, obscene, praiseworthy of sinful acts, or attempts to challenge the Qu'ran's content and form, is forbidden for Muslims.

{{quote|And as to the poets, those who go astray follow them
 Do you not see that they wander about bewildered in every valley?
 And that they say that which they do not do

 Except those who believe and do good works and remember Allah much and defend themselves after they are oppressed; and they who act unjustly shall know to what final place of turning they shall turn back. 
|sign=26:224-227|source=}}

This may have exerted dominance over the pre-Islamic poets of the 6th century whose popularity may have vied with the Qur'an amongst the people. There was a marked lack of significant poets until the 8th century. One notable exception was [[Hassan ibn Thabit]] who wrote poems in praise of [[Muhammad]] and was known as the "prophet's poet". Just as the [[Bible]] has held an important place in the literature of other languages, The Qur'an is important to Arabic. It is the source of many ideas, allusions and quotes and its moral message informs many works.

Aside from the Qur'an the ''[[hadith]]'' or tradition of what Muhammed is supposed to have said and done are important literature. The entire body of these acts and words are called ''[[sunnah]]'' or way and the ones regarded as ''sahih'' or genuine of them are collected into hadith. Some of the most significant collections of hadith include those by [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj]] and [[Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Bukhari]].

The other important genre of work in Qur'anic study is the ''[[tafsir]]'' or [[Close reading|commentaries]] Arab writings relating to religion also includes many [[sermon]]s and devotional pieces as well as the sayings of [[Ali]] which were collected in the 10th century as ''[[Nahj al-Balaghah]]'' or ''The Peak of Eloquence''.

=== Rashidi ===
Under the [[Rashidun]], or the "rightly guided caliphs," literary centers developed in the [[Hejaz|Hijaz]], in cities such as [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]; in the Levant, in [[Damascus]]; and in Iraq, in [[Kufa]] and [[Basra]].<ref name=":0" /> Literary production—and poetry in particular—in this period served the spread of Islam.<ref name=":0" /> There was also poetry to praise brave warriors, to inspire soldiers in ''[[jihad]]'', and [[Rithā'|''rithā''<nowiki/>']] to mourn those who fell in battle.<ref name=":0" /> Notable poets of this rite include [[Ka'b ibn Zuhayr]], [[Hasan ibn Thabit]], {{Ill|Abu Dhū'īb al-Hudhalī|lt=|ar|أبو ذؤيب الهذلي|WD=}}, and [[Nābigha al-Ja‘dī]].<ref name=":0" />

There was also poetry for entertainment often in the form of ''[[ghazal]]''.<ref name=":0" /> Notables of this movement were [[Jamil ibn Ma'mar]], [[Layla al-Akhyaliyya]], and [[Umar Ibn Abi Rabi'ah]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Ummayad ===
The [[First Fitna]], which created the [[Shia–Sunni relations|Shia–Sunni split]] over the rightful [[Caliphate|caliph]], had a great impact on Arabic literature.<ref name=":0" /> Whereas Arabic literature—along with Arab society—was greatly centralized in the time of [[Muhammad]] and the [[Rashidun]], it became fractured at the beginning of the period of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], as power struggles led to tribalism.<ref name=":0" /> Arabic literature at this time reverted to its state in [[Jahiliyyah|''al-Jahiliyyah'']], with markets such as [[Souq of Kinasa|Kinasa]] near [[Kufa]] and {{Ill|Souq of Mirbad|lt=Mirbad|ar|المربد (سوق)|WD=}} near [[Basra]], where poetry in praise and admonishment of political parties and tribes was recited.<ref name=":0" /> Poets and scholars found support and patronage under the Ummayads, but the literature of this period was limited in that it served the interests of parties and individuals, and as such was not a free art form.<ref name=":0" />

Notable writers of this political poetry include [[Al-Akhtal al-Taghlibi]], [[Jarir ibn Atiyah]], [[Al-Farazdaq]], [[Al-Kumayt ibn Zayd al-Asadi]], {{Interlanguage link|Tirimmah Bin Hakim|lt=|ar|الطرماح بن الحكيم|WD=}}, and {{Ill|Ubayd Allah ibn Qays ar-Ruqiyat|lt=|ar|عبد الله بن قيس الرقيات|WD=}}.<ref name=":0" />

There were also poetic forms of [[Rajaz (prosody)|''rajaz'']]—mastered by {{Interlanguage link|al-'Ajjaj|lt=|ar|العجاج الشاعر|WD=}} and {{Ill|Ru'uba bin al-Ajjaj|lt=|ar|رؤبة بن العجاج|WD=}}—and ''ar-Rā'uwīyyāt,'' or "[[pastoral|pastoral poetry]]"—mastered by {{Ill|ar-Rā'ī an-Namīrī|lt=|ar|الراعي النميري|WD=}} and [[Dhu ar-Rumma]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Abbasid ===
Some of the important poets in {{Interlanguage link|Abbasid literature|lt=|ar|الأدب في العصر العباسي|WD=}} were: [[Bashar ibn Burd]], [[Abu Nuwas]], [[Abu-l-'Atahiya]], [[Muslim ibn al-Walid]], [[Abbas Ibn al-Ahnaf]], and {{Interlanguage link|Al-Hussein bin ad-Dahhak|lt=|ar|الحسين بن الضحاك|WD=}}.<ref name=":0" />

=== Andalusi ===
{{Main|Andalusi literature}}

=== Ottoman ===
Significant poets of Arabic literature in the time of the [[Ottoman Empire]] included {{Interlanguage link|ash-Shab adh-Dharif|lt=|ar|الشاب الظريف|WD=}}, [[Al-Busiri]] author of "''[[Al-Burda]]''", [[Ibn al-Wardi]], [[Safi al-Din al-Hilli]], and [[Ibn Nubata]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Nahda ===
{{Main|Nahda}}During the 19th century a revival took place in Arabic literature, along with much of Arabic culture, and is referred to in Arabic as "''[[al-Nahda]]''", which means "the Renaissance". This resurgence of writing in Arabic was confined mainly to [[Syria]], [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]] until the 20th century when it spread to other countries in the region. This Renaissance was not only felt within the Arab world but also beyond, with a great interest in the translating of Arabic works into European languages. Although the use of the Arabic language was revived, particularly in poetry, many of the [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]] of the previous literature which served to make it so ornate and complicated were dropped.

Just as in the 8th century, when a movement to translate [[ancient Greek]] and other literature had helped vitalise Arabic literature, another translation movement would offer new ideas and material for Arabic. An early popular success was ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', which spurred a host of [[historical novel]]s on Arabic subjects. Two important translators were [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] and [[Jabra Ibrahim Jabra]].

==== Poetry ====
During the [[Nahda]], poets like [[Francis Marrash]], [[Ahmad Shawqi]] and [[Hafiz Ibrahim]] began to explore the possibility of developing the classical poetic forms.<ref>Moreh (1976), p. 44.</ref><ref>Somekh, pp. 36–82.</ref> Some of these neoclassical poets were acquainted with Western literature but mostly continued to write in classical forms, while others, denouncing blind imitation of classical poetry and its recurring themes,<ref name="Studies in Modern Arabic Prose and Poetry p. 34" /> sought inspiration from French or English [[romanticism]].

The next generation of poets, the so-called Romantic poets, began to absorb the impact of developments in Western poetry to a far greater extent, and felt constrained by [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] traditions which the previous generation had tried to uphold. The [[Mahjar]]i poets were emigrants who mostly wrote in the Americas, but were similarly beginning to experiment further with the possibilities of Arabic poetry. This experimentation continued in the Middle East throughout the first half of the 20th century.<ref>Jayyusi (1992), pp. 132&#x2013;180.</ref>

Prominent poets of the [[Nahda]], or "Renaissance," were [[Nasif al-Yaziji]];<ref name=":0" /> [[Mahmoud Sami el-Baroudi]], {{Interlanguage link|Ḥifnī Nāṣif|lt=|ar|حفني ناصف|WD=}}, {{Interlanguage link|Ismāʻīl Ṣabrī|lt=|ar|إسماعيل صبري|WD=}}, and [[Hafez Ibrahim]];<ref name=":0" /> [[Ahmed Shawqi]];<ref name=":0" /> [[Jamil Sidqi al-Zahawi]], [[Maruf al Rusafi]], {{Interlanguage link|Fawzi al-Ma'luf|lt=|ar|فوزي المعلوف|WD=}}, and [[Khalil Mutran]].<ref name=":0" />

===Modern literature===
{{main|Modern Arabic literature}}
Throughout the 20th century, Arabic writers in both poetry and prose have reflected the changing political and social climate of the Arab world in their work. Anti-colonial themes were prominent early in the 20th century, with writers continuing to explore the region's relationship with the West until the present day. Internal political upheaval has also been a challenge, with some writers suffering censorship. There are many contemporary Arabic writers, such as Mahmoud Saeed (Iraq) who wrote ''Bin Barka Ally'', and ''I Am The One Who Saw (Saddam City)''. Other contemporary writers include [[Sonallah Ibrahim]] and [[Abdul Rahman Munif]], who were imprisoned by the state for their anti-government work. At the same time, others who had written works supporting or praising governments were promoted to positions of authority within cultural bodies. Non-fiction writers and academics have also produced political polemics and criticisms aiming to re-shape Arabic politics. Some of the best known are [[Taha Hussein]]'s ''[[The Future of Culture in Egypt]]'', which was an important work of [[Egyptian nationalism]], and the works of [[Nawal el-Saadawi]] who campaigns for [[women's rights]]. Tayeb Salih and Ghassan Kanafani are two other writers that explored identity in relationship to foreign and domestic powers, the former focusing on colonial/post-colonial dynamics and the latter on the Palestinian struggle.

After [[World War II]], there was a largely unsuccessful movement by several poets to write poems in [[free verse]] (''shi'r hurr''). Iraqi poets [[Badr Shakir al-Sayyab]] and [[Nazik Al-Malaika]] (1923-2007) are considered to be the originators of free verse in Arabic poetry. Most of these experiments were abandoned in favour of [[prose poetry]], of which the first examples in modern Arabic literature are to be found in the writings of [[Francis Marrash]],<ref>Jayyusi (1977), p. 23.</ref> and of which two of the most influential proponents were Nazik al-Malaika and [[Iman Mersal]]. The development of [[modernist poetry]] also influenced poetry in Arabic. More recently, poets such as [[Adunis]] have pushed the boundaries of stylistic experimentation even further.

Poetry retains a very important status in the Arab world. [[Mahmoud Darwish]] was regarded as the Palestinian national poet, and his funeral was attended by thousands of mourners. Syrian poet [[Nizar Qabbani]] addressed less political themes, but was regarded as a cultural icon, and his poems provide the lyrics for many popular songs.

====Novels====
Two distinct trends can be found in the ''nahda'' period of revival. The first was a neo-classical movement which sought to rediscover the literary traditions of the past, and was influenced by traditional literary genres—such as the ''[[maqama]]''—and works like ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. In contrast, a modernist movement began by translating Western modernist works—primarily novels—into Arabic.

In the 19th century, individual authors in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Egypt]] created original works by imitating classical narrative genres: [[Ahmad Faris Shidyaq]] with ''Leg upon Leg'' (1855), Khalil Khoury with ''Yes... so I am not a Frank'' (1859), [[Francis Marrash]] with ''The Forest of Truth'' (1865), [[Butrus al-Bustani|Salim al-Bustani]] with ''At a Loss in the Levantine Gardens'' (1870), and Muhammad al-Muwaylihi with ''Isa ibn Hisham's Tale'' (1907).<ref name="Logan, ed., p. 573.">Logan, ed., p. 573.</ref> This trend was furthered by [[Jurji Zaydan]] (author of many historical novels), [[Khalil Gibran]], [[Mikha'il Na'ima]] and [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]] (author of ''[[Zaynab (novel)|Zaynab]]''). Meanwhile, female writer [[Zaynab Fawwaz]]'s first novel ''Ḥusn al-'Awāqib aw Ghādah al-Zāhirah'' (''The Happy Ending'', 1899) was also influential.<ref>Joseph T. Zeidan, Arab Women Novelists: the Formative Years and Beyond (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1995), p. 66.</ref> According to the authors of the ''Encyclopedia of the Novel'':
<blockquote>Almost each of the above [works] have been claimed as the first Arabic novel, which goes to suggest that the Arabic novel emerged from several rehearsals and multiple beginnings rather than from one single origin. Given that the very Arabic word "''riwaya''", which is now used exclusively in reference to the "novel", has traditionally conjured up a tangle of narrative genres [...], it might not be unfair to contend that the Arabic novel owes its early formation not only to the appropriation of the novel genre from Europe [...] but also, and more importantly, to the revival and transformation of traditional narrative genres in the wake of [[Napoleon]]'s 1798 expedition into Egypt and the Arab world's firsthand encounter with industrialized imperial Europe.<ref name="Logan, ed., p. 573." /></blockquote>

A common theme in the modern Arabic novel is the study of family life with obvious resonances of the wider family of the Arabic world.{{according to whom|date=October 2012}} Many of the novels have been unable to avoid the politics and conflicts of the region with war often acting as background to intimate family dramas. The works of [[Naguib Mahfuz]] depict life in [[Cairo]], and his [[Cairo Trilogy]], describing the struggles of a modern Cairene family across three generations, won him a [[Nobel prize for literature]] in 1988. He was the first Arabic writer to win the prize.

====Plays====
The musical plays of Lebanese [[:de:Maroun an-Naqqash|Maroun Naccache]] from the mid-1800s are considered the birth of not only [[theatre in Lebanon]], but also modern Arab theatre.<ref>Stone, p. 50.</ref> Modern Arabic drama began to be written in the 19th century chiefly in Egypt and mainly influenced and in imitation of French works. It was not until the 20th century that it began to develop a distinctly Arab flavour and be seen elsewhere. The most important Arab playwright was [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] whose first play was a re-telling of the Qur'anic story of the [[Seven sleepers]] and the second an epilogue for the ''Thousand and One Nights''. Other important dramatists of the region include Yusuf al-Ani from [[Iraq]] and [[Saadallah Wannous]] from [[Syria]].

==Classical Arabic literature==
===Poetry===
{{main|Arabic poetry}}
{{Arab culture}}
A large proportion of Arabic literature before the 20th century is in the form of poetry, and even prose from this period is either filled with snippets of poetry or is in the form of ''[[saj']]'' or rhymed prose. The themes of the poetry range from high-flown hymns of praise to bitter personal attacks and from religious and mystical ideas to poems on women and wine. An important feature of the poetry which would be applied to all of the literature was the idea that it must be pleasing to the ear. The poetry and much of the prose was written with the design that it would be spoken aloud and great care was taken to make all writing as mellifluous as possible.

===Religious scholarship===
The research into the life and times of Muhammad, and determining the genuine parts of the sunnah, was an important early reason for scholarship in or about the Arabic language. It was also the reason for the collecting of pre-Islamic poetry; as some of these poets were close to the prophet—[[Labīd|Labid]] meeting Muhammad and converting to Islam—and their writings illuminated the times when these events occurred. Muhammad also inspired the first Arabic [[biography|biographies]], known as A''l-Sirah Al-Nabawiyyah''; the earliest was by [[Wahb ibn Munabbih]], but [[Muhammad ibn Ishaq]] wrote the best known. Whilst covering the life of the prophet they also told of the battles and events of early Islam and have numerous digressions on older biblical traditions.

Some of the earliest works studying the Arabic language were started in the name of Islam. Tradition has it that the caliph [[Ali]], after reading a copy of the Qur'an with errors in it, asked [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali]] to write a work codifying [[Arabic grammar]]. [[Khalil ibn Ahmad]] would later write ''Kitab al-Ayn'', the first dictionary of Arabic, along with works on [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[music]], and his pupil [[Sibawayh]] would produce the most respected work of Arabic grammar known simply as ''al-Kitab'' or ''The Book''.

Other caliphs followed after [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|'Abd al-Malik]] made Arabic the official language for the administration of the new empire, such as [[al-Ma'mun]] who set up the ''[[House of Wisdom|Bayt al-Hikma]]'' in [[Baghdad]] for research and translations. [[Basrah]] and [[Kufa]]h were two other important seats of learning in the early Arab world, between which there was a strong rivalry.

The institutions set up mainly to investigate more fully the Islamic religion were invaluable in studying many other subjects. Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] was instrumental in enriching the literature by instructing scholars to translate works into Arabic. The first was probably [[Aristotle]]'s correspondence with [[Alexander the Great]] translated by Salm Abu al-'Ala'. From the east, and in a very different literary genre, the scholar [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa]] translated the animal [[fable]]s of the ''[[Panchatantra]]''. These translations would keep alive scholarship and learning, particularly that of [[ancient Greece]], during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe and the works would often be first re-introduced to Europe from the Arabic versions.

===Culinary===
{{see|Arab cuisine}}

More medieval cookbooks have survived into the present day written in Arabic than in any other language. Classical Arabic culinary literature is comprised not only of cookbooks, there are also many works of scholarship, and descriptions of contemporary foods can be found in fictional and legendary tales like ''[[The Thousand and One Nights]]''.<ref name=zaouali>{{cite book |last=Zaouali |first=Lilia |title=Medieval Cuisine of the Islamic World |publisher=University of California Press |date=2007}}</ref> Some of these texts predate [[Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq]]'s ''Kitab al-Tabikh'', the earliest known book of medieval Arabic cuisine. The [[Persian language]] ''Ḵusraw ī Kawādān ud rēdak-ēw'', translated into Arabic after the conquest of the [[Sasanian Empire]] by Arab armies in the 7th century, was a guide to the sophisticated culinary and court culture of the time, written as a fictionalized narrative about an orphan descended from priestly roots who learns the ways of [[Khosrow I]]'s court.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ḵusraw ī Kawādān ud rēdak-ēw |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kusraw-kawadan-ud-redak-ew |website=Iranica Online}}</ref>

Early authors appear to have been familiar with the earlier works of [[Hippocrates]], [[Rufus of Ephesus]] and [[Galen of Pergamum]]. Galen's ''[[On the Properties of Foodstuffs]]'' was translated into Arabic as ''Kitab al-aghdiya'' and was cited by all contemporary medical writers in the Caliphate during the reign of [[Abu Bakr al-Razi]]. Al-Razi was himself the author of an early text on food ''[[Manafi al-Aghdhiya wa Daf Madarriha]]'' (Book of the Benefits of Food, and Remedies against Its Harmful Effects). Interest in Galen's work was not limited only to Muslim scholars; Jewish scholar [[Abu Ya'qub Ishaḳ ibn Sulayman al-Isra'ili]] wrote ''Book on Foods'' (also in Arabic) in the same period. Rufus' original [[Greek language]] work has not survived into the present day, and it is only known to us from its Arabic translation.<ref name=zaouali/>

===Non-fiction literature===
====Compilations and manuals====
In the late 9th century [[Ibn al-Nadim]], a [[Baghdad]]i bookseller, compiled a crucial work in the study of Arabic literature. The ''[[Kitab al-Fihrist]]'' is a catalogue of all books available for sale in Baghdad, and it gives an overview of the state of the literature at that time.

One of the most common forms of literature during the [[Abbasid]] period was the compilation. These were collections of facts, ideas, instructive stories and poems on a single topic, and covers subjects as diverse as house and garden, women, gate-crashers, blind people, envy, animals and misers. These last three compilations were written by [[al-Jahiz]], the acknowledged master of the form. These collections were important for any ''nadim'', a companion to a ruler or noble whose role was often involved regaling the ruler with stories and information to entertain or advise.

A type of work closely allied to the collection was the manual in which writers like [[ibn Qutaybah]] offered instruction in subjects like etiquette, how to rule, how to be a bureaucrat and even how to write. Ibn Qutaybah also wrote one of the earliest histories of the Arabs, drawing together biblical stories, Arabic [[Folklore|folk tale]]s and more historical events.

The subject of sex was frequently investigated in Arabic literature. The ''[[ghazal]]'' or love poem had a long history, being at times tender and chaste and at other times rather explicit. In the [[Sufi]] tradition, the love poem would take on wider, mystical and religious importance. Sex manuals were also written such as ''[[The Perfumed Garden]]'', ''[[The Ring of the Dove|Ṭawq al-Ḥamāmah]]'' or ''The Dove's Neckring'' by [[ibn Hazm]] and ''Nuzhat al-albab fi-ma la yujad fi kitab'' or ''Delight of Hearts Concerning What will Never Be Found in a Book'' by [[Ahmad al-Tifashi]]. Countering such works are one like ''Rawdat al-muhibbin wa-nuzhat al-mushtaqin'' or ''Meadow of Lovers and Diversion of the Infatuated'' by [[ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah]] who advises on how to separate love and lust and avoid sin.

====Biography, history, and geography====
Aside from the early [[biography|biographies]] of Muhammad, the first major biographer to weigh character rather than just producing a hymn of praise was [[al-Baladhuri]] with his ''[[Genealogies of the Nobles|Kitab ansab al-ashraf]]'' or ''Book of the Genealogies of the Noble'', a collection of biographies. Another important biographical dictionary was begun by [[ibn Khallikan]] and expanded by al-Safadi and one of the first significant [[autobiography|autobiographies]] was ''[[Kitab al-I'tibar]]'' which told of [[Usamah ibn Munqidh]] and his experiences in fighting in the [[Crusade]]s. This time period saw the emergence of the genre of ''tabaqat'' (biographical dictionaries or biographical compendia).<ref>Auchterlonie.</ref>

[[Ibn Khurdadhbih]], an official in the [[Mail|postal service]] wrote one of the first [[Guide book|travel book]]s and the form remained a popular one in Arabic literature with books by [[ibn Hawqal]], [[ibn Fadlan]], al-Istakhri, [[al-Muqaddasi]], [[al-Idrisi]] and most famously the travels of [[ibn Battutah]]. These give a view of the many cultures of the wider [[Islamic]] world and also offer [[Muslim]] perspectives on the non-Muslim peoples on the edges of the empire. They also indicated just how great a trading power the Muslim peoples had become. These were often sprawling accounts that included details of both [[geography]] and [[history]].

Some writers concentrated solely on history like [[al-Ya'qubi]] and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], whilst others focused on a small portion of history such as [[ibn al-Azraq]], with a history of [[Mecca]], and [[ibn Abi Tahir Tayfur]], writing a history of [[Baghdad]]. The historian regarded as the greatest of all Arabic historians though is [[ibn Khaldun]] whose history ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' focuses on society and is a founding text in [[sociology]] and [[economics]].

====Diaries====
In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Near East]], Arabic [[Diary|diaries]] were first being written from before the 10th century, though the medieval diary which most resembles the modern diary was that of Ibn Banna in the 11th century. His diary was the earliest to be arranged in order of date (''ta'rikh'' in Arabic), very much like modern diaries.<ref>Makdisi, pp.173–185.</ref>

====Literary theory and criticism====
[[Literary criticism]] in Arabic literature often focused on religious texts, and the several long religious traditions of [[hermeneutics]] and textual [[exegesis]] have had a profound influence on the study of secular texts. This was particularly the case for the literary traditions of [[Islamic literature]].

Literary criticism was also employed in other forms of medieval [[Arabic poetry]] and literature from the 9th century, notably by [[Al-Jahiz]] in his ''al-Bayan wa-'l-tabyin'' and ''al-Hayawan'', and by [[Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz]] in his ''Kitab al-Badi''.<ref>Van Gelder, pp. 1–2.</ref>

===Fiction literature===
[[File:Arabian nights manuscript.jpg|thumb|The Arabic version of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'']]

[[Ibn ʿAbd Rabbih]]'s book ''[[Al-ʿIqd al-Farīd]]'' is considered one of the seminal texts of Arabic fiction.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hefter |first=Thomas |date=2011-04-01 |title=The Unique Necklace (Al-ʿIqd al-Farīd), Vol. 1, by Ibn ʿAbd Rabbih and Roger M. A. Allen. |journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=167–168 |doi=10.1086/659081 |issn=0022-2968}}</ref>

In the [[Arab world]], there was a great distinction between ''al-fus'ha'' (quality language) and ''al-ammiyyah'' (language of the common people). Not many writers would write works in this ''al-ammiyyah'' or common language and it was felt that literature had to be improving, educational and with purpose rather than just entertainment. This did not stop the common role of the ''hakawati'' or story-teller who would retell the entertaining parts of more educational works or one of the many Arabic [[fable]]s or [[Folklore|folk-tale]]s, which were often not written down in many cases. Nevertheless, some of the earliest [[novel]]s, including the first [[philosophical novel]]s, were written by Arabic authors.

====Epic literature====
{{main|Arabic epic literature}}
The most famous example of Arabic fiction is the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''). It is easily the best-known work of all Arabic literature, and still affects many of the ideas non-Arabs have about [[Arabic culture]]. A good example of the lack of popular Arabic prose fiction is that the stories of [[Aladdin]] and [[Ali Baba]], usually regarded as part of the ''Tales from One Thousand and One Nights'', were not actually part of the ''Tales''. They were first included in [[French language|French]] translation of the ''Tales'' by [[Antoine Galland]] who heard them being told by [[Maronites|Maronite]] [[Hanna Diyab|Hanna Dyab]] and only existed in incomplete Arabic manuscripts before that. The other great character from Arabic literature, [[Sinbad]], is from the ''Tales''.

The ''One Thousand and One Nights'' is usually placed in the genre of [[Arabic epic literature]] along with several other works. They are usually collections of short stories or episodes strung together into a long tale. The extant versions were mostly written down relatively late, after the 14th century, although many were undoubtedly collected earlier and many of the original stories are probably pre-Islamic. Types of stories in these collections include [[animal fable]]s, [[proverb]]s, stories of ''[[jihad]]'' or propagation of the faith, humorous tales, moral tales, tales about the wily con-man Ali Zaybaq, and tales about the prankster Juha.

====Maqama====
''[[Maqama]]'' not only straddles the divide between [[prose]] and [[poetry]], being instead a form of [[rhymed prose]], it is also part-way between fiction and non-fiction. Over a series of short narratives, which are fictionalised versions of real-life situations, different ideas are contemplated. A good example of this is a ''maqama'' on musk, which purports to compare the feature of different perfumes but is in fact a work of political satire comparing several competing rulers. ''Maqama'' also makes use of the doctrine of ''badi'' or deliberately adding complexity to display the writer's dexterity with language. [[Al-Hamadhani]] is regarded as the originator of ''maqama''; his work was taken up by [[Al-Hariri of Basra|Abu Muhammad al-Qasim al-Hariri]], one of al-Hariri's ''maqama'' being a study of al-Hamadhani's own work. ''Maqama'' was an exceptionally popular form of Arabic literature, one of the few forms which continued to be written during the decline of Arabic in the 17th and 18th centuries.

====Romantic literature====
A famous example of [[Romance (love)|romantic]] [[Arabic poetry]] is ''[[Layla and Majnun]]'', dating back to the [[Umayyad]] era in the 7th century. It is a [[Tragedy|tragic]] story of undying [[love]]. ''Layla and Majnun'' is considered part of the [[platonic Love]] (Arabic: حب عذري) genre, so-called because the couple never marry or consummate their relationship, that is prominent in Arabic literature, though the literary motif is found throughout the world. Other famous Virgin Love stories include ''Qays and Lubna'', ''Kuthair and Azza'', ''[[Marwa and al-Majnun al-Faransi]]'' and ''[[Antarah ibn Shaddad|Antara and Abla]]''.

The 10th-century ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]'' features a fictional [[anecdote]] of a "prince who strays from his palace during his wedding feast and, drunk, spends the night in a cemetery, confusing a [[Corpse bride|corpse with his bride]]. The story is used as a gnostic parable of the soul's [[pre-existence]] and return from its terrestrial [[Wiktionary:sojourn|sojourn]]".<ref>Hamori, p. 18.</ref>

Another medieval Arabic love story was ''[[Hadith Bayad wa Riyad]]'' (''The Story of Bayad and Riyad''), a 13th-century [[Arabic]] love story. The main characters of the tale are Bayad, a merchant's son and a foreigner from [[Damascus]], and Riyad, a well-educated girl in the court of an unnamed [[Hajib]] (vizier or minister) of 'Iraq which is referred to as the lady. The ''Hadith Bayad wa Riyad'' manuscript is believed to be the only illustrated manuscript known to have survived from more than eight centuries of Muslim and Arab presence in Spain.

Many of the tales in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' are also love stories or involve romantic love as a central theme. This includes the [[frame story]] of [[Scheherazade]] herself, and many of the [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|stories she narrates]], including "[[Aladdin]]", "[[The Ebony Horse]]", "[[The Three Apples]]", "Tale of Tàj al-Mulúk and the Princess Dunyà: The Lover and the Loved", "Adi bin Zayd and the Princess Hind", "Di'ibil al-Khuza'i With the Lady and Muslim bin al-Walid", "The Three Unfortunate Lovers", and others.

Several elements of [[courtly love]] were developed in Arabic literature, namely the notions of "love for love's sake" and "exaltation of the beloved lady" which have been traced back to Arabic literature of the 9th and 10th centuries. The notion of the "ennobling power" of love was developed in the early 11th century by the [[Muslim psychology|Persian psychologist]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosopher]], [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (known as "Avicenna" in Europe), in his Arabic treatise ''Risala fi'l-Ishq'' (''Treatise on Love''). The final element of courtly love, the concept of "love as desire never to be fulfilled", was also at times implicit in [[Arabic poetry]].<ref>Von Grunebaum, pp. 233–234.</ref>

====Murder mystery====
The earliest known example of a [[whodunit]] [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] was "[[The Three Apples]]", one of the tales narrated by [[Scheherazade]] in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''). In this tale, a fisherman discovers a heavy locked chest along the [[Tigris]] river and he sells it to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]], who then has the chest broken open only to find inside it the dead body of a young woman who was cut into pieces. Harun orders his [[vizier]], [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]], to solve the crime and find the murderer within three days, or be executed if he fails his assignment.<ref>Pinault, pp. 86–91.</ref> [[Suspense]] is generated through multiple [[plot twist]]s that occur as the story progresses.<ref>Pinault, pp. 93, 95 & 97.</ref> This may thus be considered an archetype for [[detective fiction]].<ref>Pinault, p. 91.</ref>

====Satire and comedy====
In [[Arabic poetry]], the genre of [[Satire|satirical]] poetry was known as ''hija''. Satire was introduced into prose literature by the author [[al-Jahiz]] in the 9th century. While dealing with serious topics in what are now known as [[anthropology]], sociology and [[Psychology in medieval Islam|psychology]], he introduced a satirical approach, "based on the premise that, however serious the subject under review, it could be made more interesting and thus achieve greater effect, if only one leavened the lump of solemnity by the insertion of a few amusing anecdotes or by the throwing out of some witty or paradoxical observations."<ref>Bosworth, p. 32.</ref> He was well aware that, in treating of new themes in his prose works, he would have to employ a vocabulary of a nature more familiar in ''hija'', satirical poetry. For example, in one of his [[zoological]] works, he satirized the preference for longer [[human penis size]], writing: "If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the [[mule]] would belong to the (honorable tribe of) [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]". Another satirical story based on this preference was an ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale called "Ali with the Large Member".<ref>Marzolph, van Leeuwen & Wassouf, pp. 97–98.</ref>

In the 10th century, the writer [[Tha'alibi]] recorded satirical poetry written by the poets As-Salami and Abu Dulaf, with As-Salami praising Abu Dulaf's [[Polymath|wide breadth of knowledge]] and then mocking his ability in all these subjects, and with Abu Dulaf responding back and satirizing As-Salami in return.<ref>Bosworth, pp. 77–78.</ref> An example of Arabic [[political satire]] included another 10th-century poet Jarir satirizing Farazdaq as "a transgressor of the [[Sharia]]" and later Arabic poets in turn using the term "Farazdaq-like" as a form of political satire.<ref>Bosworth, p. 70.</ref>

The terms "[[comedy]]" and "satire" became synonymous after [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' was translated into Arabic in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by Arabic writers and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], such as Abu Bischr, his pupil [[al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''hija'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the "art of reprehension", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or troublous beginnings and happy endings, associated with classical Greek comedy. After the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term "comedy" thus gained a new semantic meaning in [[Medieval literature]].<ref>Webber.</ref>

====Theatre====
While [[puppet]] theatre and [[passion play]]s were popular in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]],<ref name=Moreh/> live [[theatre]] and [[drama]] has only been a visible part of Arabic literature in the modern era. There may have been a much longer theatrical tradition but it was probably not regarded as legitimate literature and mostly went unrecorded. There is an ancient tradition of public performance amongst [[Shi'i]] Muslims of a play depicting the life and death of [[al-Husayn]] at the [[battle of Karbala]] in 680 CE. There are also several plays composed by Shams al-din Muhammad ibn Daniyal in the 13th century when he mentions that older plays are getting stale and offers his new works as fresh material.

The most popular forms of theater in the medieval Islamic world were puppet theatre (which included hand puppets, [[shadow play]]s and [[marionette]] productions) and live [[passion play]]s known as ''ta'ziya'', where actors re-enact episodes from [[Muslim history]]. In particular, [[Shia Islam]]ic [[Play (theatre)|plays]] revolved around the ''[[shahid|shaheed]]'' (martyrdom) of [[Ali]]'s sons [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Live secular plays were known as ''akhraja'', recorded in medieval ''[[Adab (behavior)|adab]]'' literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ''ta'ziya'' theater.<ref name=Moreh>Moreh (1986).</ref>

The [[Moors]] had a noticeable influence on the works of [[George Peele]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. Some of their works featured Moorish characters, such as Peele's ''[[The Battle of Alcazar]]'' and Shakespeare's ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'', which featured a Moorish [[Othello (character)|Othello]] as its title character. These works are said to have been inspired by several Moorish [[delegation]]s from [[Morocco]] to [[Elizabethan England]] at the beginning of the 17th century, ignoring the fact that ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' were both penned in the 16th century. In 2016, opera singer and actor [[David Serero (singer)|David Serero]] performed Othello in a Moroccan adaptation in New York.<ref>https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2016/06/190147/othello-seen-through-a-moroccan-lens/</ref>

====Philosophical novels====
The Arab [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer)<ref name=Jon>McGinnis & Reisman, p. 284.</ref> and [[Ibn al-Nafis]], were pioneers of the [[philosophical novel]] as they wrote the earliest [[novel]]s dealing with [[Philosophy and literature|philosophical fiction]]. Ibn Tufail wrote the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''Philosophus Autodidactus'') as a response to [[Al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''. This was followed by [[Ibn al-Nafis]] who wrote a fictional narrative ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'' as a response to Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''. Both of these narratives had [[protagonist]]s (Hayy in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' and Kamil in ''Theologus Autodidactus'') who were [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]] individuals [[Abiogenesis|spontaneously generated]] in a [[cave]] and living in seclusion on a [[desert island]], both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone on the desert island for most of the story in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' (until he meets a [[castaway]] named Absal), the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in ''Theologus Autodidactus'' (when castaways take him back to civilization with them), developing into the earliest known [[coming of age]] plot and eventually becoming the first example of a [[science fiction]] novel.

Ibn al-Nafis described his book ''Theologus Autodidactus'' as a defense of "the system of Islam and the Muslims' doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world." He presents rational arguments for bodily [[resurrection]] and the [[immortality]] of the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], using both demonstrative [[reasoning]] and material from the hadith corpus to prove his case. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] claim of Avicenna and Ibn Tufail that bodily resurrection cannot be proven through reason, a view that was earlier criticized by al-Ghazali. Ibn al-Nafis' work was later translated into Latin and English as ''Theologus Autodidactus'' in the early 20th century.

A [[Latin]] translation of Ibn Tufail's work, entitled ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', first appeared in 1671, prepared by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger. The first English translation by [[Simon Ockley]] was published in 1708, and [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translations were also published at the time. These translations later inspired [[Daniel Defoe]] to write ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', which also featured a desert island narrative and was regarded as the [[first novel in English]].<ref>Hassan.</ref><ref>Glassé, p. 202.</ref><ref name="Wainwright">Wainwright.</ref> ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' also inspired [[Robert Boyle]], an acquaintance of Pococke, to write his own philosophical novel set on an island, ''The Aspiring Naturalist'', in the late 17th century.<ref name="Toomer-222"/> The story also anticipated [[Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile, or On Education|Émile]]'' in some ways, and is also similar to the later story of [[Mowgli]] in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' as well the character of [[Tarzan]], in that a baby is abandoned in a deserted tropical island where he is taken care of and fed by a mother [[wolf]]. Other European writers influenced by ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' include [[John Locke]],<ref>Russell, ed., pp. 224&ndash;239.</ref> [[Gottfried Leibniz]],<ref name=Wainwright/> [[Melchisédech Thévenot]], [[John Wallis]], [[Christiaan Huygens]],<ref>Russell, ed., p. 227.</ref> [[George Keith (missionary)|George Keith]], [[Robert Barclay]], the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]],<ref>Russell, ed., p. 247.</ref> and [[Samuel Hartlib]].<ref name="Toomer-222">Toomer, p. 222.</ref>

====Science fiction====
''Al-Risalah al-Kamiliyyah fil Sira al-Nabawiyyah'' (''The Treatise of Kamil on the Prophet's Biography''), known in [[English language|English]] as ''Theologus Autodidactus'' (which is a phonetic transliteration of the Greek name Θεολόγος Αὐτοδίδακτος, meaning self-taught theologian), written by the [[Arab]]ian polymath [[Ibn al-Nafis]] (1213–1288), is the earliest known [[science fiction]] novel. While also being an early [[desert island]] story and [[coming of age]] story, the novel deals with various science fiction elements such as [[Abiogenesis|spontaneous generation]], [[futurology]], [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic themes]], the [[Islamic eschatology|end of the world and doomsday]], [[resurrection]] and the [[afterlife]]. Rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using his own extensive [[Science in medieval Islam|scientific knowledge]] in [[Medicine in medieval Islam|anatomy, biology, physiology]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy, cosmology]] and [[Geography in medieval Islam|geology]]. His main purpose behind this science fiction work was to explain [[Islam]]ic religious teachings in terms of [[Islamic science|science]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophy]]. For example, it was through this novel that Ibn al-Nafis introduces his scientific theory of [[metabolism]], and he makes references to his own scientific discovery of the [[pulmonary circulation]] in order to explain bodily resurrection. The novel was later translated into English as ''Theologus Autodidactus'' in the early 20th century.

A number of [[Story within a story|stories within]] the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights'') also feature science fiction elements. One example is "The Adventures of Bulukiya", where the [[protagonist]] Bulukiya's quest for the [[Elixir of life|herb of immortality]] leads him to explore the seas, journey to the [[Garden of Eden]] and to [[Jahannam]], and travel across the [[cosmos]] to different worlds much larger than his own world, anticipating elements of [[Galaxy|galactic]] science fiction;<ref name=Irwin>Irwin, p. 209.</ref> along the way, he encounters societies of [[Genie|jinns]],<ref>Irwin, p. 204.</ref> [[mermaid]]s, talking [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]], talking [[tree]]s, and other forms of life.<ref name=Irwin/> In another ''Arabian Nights'' tale, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater [[submarine]] society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land, in that the underwater society follows a form of [[primitive communism]] where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. Other ''Arabian Nights'' tales deal with lost ancient technologies, advanced ancient civilizations that went astray, and catastrophes which overwhelmed them.<ref>Irwin, pp. 211–212.</ref> "[[The City of Brass]]" features a group of travellers on an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition<ref>Hamori, p. 9.</ref> across the [[Sahara]] to find an ancient lost city and attempt to recover a brass vessel that [[Solomon]] once used to trap a [[Genie|jinn]],<ref>Pinault, pp. 148–149 & 217–219.</ref> and, along the way, encounter a [[Mummy|mummified]] queen, [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]] inhabitants,<ref>Irwin, p. 213.</ref> lifelike [[humanoid robot]]s and [[automata]], seductive [[marionette]]s dancing without strings,<ref>Hamori, pp. 12–13.</ref> and a brass horseman [[robot]] who directs the party towards the ancient city. "[[The Ebony Horse]]" features a robot<ref name=Pinault/> in the form of a flying mechanical horse controlled using keys that could fly into outer space and towards the Sun, while the "Third Qalandar's Tale" also features a robot in the form of an uncanny [[Sailor|boatman]].<ref name=Pinault>Pinault, pp. 10–11.</ref> "The City of Brass" and "The Ebony Horse" can be considered early examples of proto-science fiction.

Other examples of early Arabic proto-science fiction include [[al-Farabi]]'s ''Opinions of the residents of a splendid city'' about a [[utopia]]n society, and elements such as the [[flying carpet]].

==== Arabic literature for young readers ====
As in other languages, there is a growing number of literary works written in Arabic for [[Young adult fiction|young readers]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lynx Qualey|first=Marcia|title=Arab teens and Young Adult literature: The new wave - Qantara.de|url=https://en.qantara.de/content/arab-teens-and-young-adult-literature-the-new-wave|access-date=2020-11-12|website=Qantara.de - Dialogue with the Islamic World|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Lynx Qualey|first=Marcia|date=2020-11-05|title=YA|url=https://arablit.org/category/ya/|access-date=2020-11-12|website=ArabLit & ArabLit Quarterly|language=en}}</ref> With this group of readers in mind, the Young Readers series of the [[New York University Press]]’s [[Library of Arabic Literature]] (LAL) offers contemporary and even classical texts in its Weaving Words collection, like the tenth-century anthology of stories and anecdotes ''Al-Faraj Ba’d al-Shiddah'' (Deliverance Follows Adversity'')'' by medieval writer Al-Muḥassin ibn ʿAlī al-Tanūkhī (327–84/939–94).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lynx Qualey|first=Marcia|date=2020-10-16|title=Series Brings Alive Classical Arabic Texts for Young Readers|url=https://www.al-fanarmedia.org/2020/10/series-brings-alive-classical-arabic-texts-for-young-readers/|access-date=2020-11-12|website=Al-Fanar Media|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Women in Arabic literature==
{{see also|Women's literary salons and societies in the Arab world}}{{Islamic Culture}}

In the words of Clarissa Burt,

:: Despite the historical and social conditions that contributed to an almost total eclipse of women's poetic expression in the literary record as maintained in Arabic culture from the pre-Islamic era through the nineteenth century, with a few significant exceptions, women poets writing in Arabic have made tremendous strides since the dawn of the twentieth century in presenting their poetic offerings in mainstream cultural forums, and contributing to a plethora of new and modern poetic currents in literary cultural throughout the Arab world.<ref>Clarissa Burt, 'Arts: Poets and Poetry: Arab States', in Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures, ed. by Suad Joseph (Leiden: Brill, 2003-2007), V: 77-80 (pp. 77-78).</ref>

Whilst not playing a major attested part in Arabic literature for much of its history, women have had a continuing role. Women's literature in Arabic has been relatively little researched, and features relatively little in most Arabic-language education systems, meaning that its prominence and importance is probably generally underrated.<ref>Hoda Thabet, ''Pioneering Female Authors in Egypt and the Levant: An Introduction into the Origins of the Arabic Novel'' (Reykjavík: Háskólaprent, 2013) {{ISBN|978-9979-72-479-7}}; cf.

===The Medieval Period===
{{see also|Medieval Arabic female poets}}

In the estimation of Tahera Qutbuddin,

: the citation of women's poetry in the general medieval anthologies is sparse. The earliest anthologists either ignored women poets or made disparaging remarks about them ... In his introduction to the ''Nuzhat al-Julasa'', al-Suyuti refers to a large (at least six-volume) anthology--now lost--of 'ancient' women's poetry ... It would seem from this that women poets may have formed a more dynamic part of the poetic landscape, at least in the earliest classical period, than is generally believed.<ref>Tahera Qutbuddin, 'Women Poets', in ''Medieval Islamic Civilisation: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Josef W. Meri, 2 vols (New York: Routledge, 2006), II 865-67 (p. 867), {{cite web|url=http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20(Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.).pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207005116/http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20%28Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.%29.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-07 }}.</ref>

Pre-Islamic women's literature seems to have been limited to the genre of ''marathiya'' ('elegy').<ref>Tahera Qutbuddin, 'Women Poets', in ''Medieval Islamic Civilisation: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Josef W. Meri, 2 vols (New York: Routledge, 2006), II 865, {{cite web |url=http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20(Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.).pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207005116/http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20%28Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.%29.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-07}}.</ref> The earliest poetesses were [[al-Khansa]] and [[Layla al-Akhyaliyyah]] of the 7th century. Their concentration on the ''ritha<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' or elegy suggests that this was a form deemed acceptable for women to work with. However, the love lyric was also an important genre of women's poetry. The [[Umayyad]] and [['Abbasid]] periods saw professional singing slave girls (''qiyan'', sing. ''quayna'') who sang love songs and accompanied these with music; alongside panegyric and competitive verse-capping, ''qiyan'' also sang love-poetry (''ghazal''). In his ''Risalat al-Qiyan'' (''Epistle of the Singing-Girls''), al-Jahiz (d. 255/868×69) reckoned that an accomplished singer might have a repertoire of 4,000 songs. Pre-eminent 'Abbasid singing-girls included: [['Inan]] (paramour of [[Harun al-Rashid]], r. 786-809); [[Arib al-Ma'muniyya]] (concubine of [[Al-Ma'mun]], r. 813-17); and [[Fadl Ashsha'ira]] (d. 871; concubine of [[Al-Mutawakkil]], r. 847-61). Meanwhile, Harun al-Rashid's half-sister [[‘Ulayya bint al-Mahdī]] (777-825) was also known for her poetic skills, as was the mystic and poet of Basra [[Rabia Basri|Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya]] (d. 801).<ref name="Tahera Qutbuddin 2006">Tahera Qutbuddin, 'Women Poets', in ''Medieval Islamic Civilisation: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Josef W.

Writings from medieval moorish Spain attest to several important female writers, pre-eminently [[Wallada bint al-Mustakfi]] (1001–1091), an Umawi princess of al-Andulus, who wrote [[Sufi]] poetry and was the lover of fellow poet [[ibn Zaydun]]; the Granadan poet [[Hafsa Bint al-Hajj al-Rukuniyya]] (d. 1190/91); and [[Nazhun al-Garnatiya bint al-Qulai’iya]] (d. 1100). These and other women writers suggest a hidden world of literature by women.

Despite their lack of prominence among the literary elite, women still played an important part as characters in Arabic literature. ''[[Delhemma|Sirat al-amirah Dhat al-Himmah]]'', for example, is an [[arabic epic literature|Arabic epic]] with a female warrior, Fatima Dhat al-Himma, as protagonist,<ref>Remke Kruk, ''The Warrior Women of Islam: Female Empowerment in Arabic Popular Literature'', Library of Middle East History, 54 (London: Tauris, 2014).</ref> and [[Scheherazade]] is famous for cunningly telling stories in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' to save her life.

The Mamluk period saw the flourishing of the Sufi master and poet [['A'isha al-Ba'uniyya]] (d. 1517), who was probably the Arabic-speaking world's most prolific female author before the twentieth century. Living in what is now Egypt and Syria, she came from the [[al-Ba'uni]] family, noted for its judges and scholars, and belonged to the 'Urmawi branch of the [[Qadiriyya]] order. 'A'isha composed at least twelve books in prose and verse, which included over three hundred long mystical and religious poems.<ref name="Tahera Qutbuddin 2006"/>

===Al- Nahda===
{{see also|Al-Nahda}}

The earliest prominent female Arabic writer of the modern period during which the Arab cultural renaissance ([[Al-Nahda]]) took place is [[Táhirih]] (1820–52), from what is now Iran. She wrote fine Arabic and Persian poetry.

[[Women's literary salons and societies in the Arab world]] were also pioneered during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, initially by [[Christian Arab]] women, who tended to have more freedom and access to education than their female Muslim counterparts in the Ottoman Empire at the time. [[Maryana Marrash]] (1848−1919) started what is now believed to have been the first salon including women, in [[Aleppo]]. In 1912, [[May Ziadeh]] (1886-1941) also started a literary salon in [[Cairo]] and in 1922, [[Mary 'Ajami]] (1888−1965) did the same in [[Damascus]]. These salons supported the emergence of women's writing (both literary and journalistic) and women's presses through increased interaction in the male-dominated world of Arab literature.

=== Late 20th century to early 21st century ===
A quote by Clarissa Burt on modern Arab poetry by Female Arab authors: <blockquote>Unlocked from the constraints of the traditional ode, several of these and other women have had long careers of poetry writing, entering into areas of expression of women's experience that had not been presented in print before. In many ways, this poetic work has gone hand in hand with the growth of critical discourse about women's role, status, and experience, and women's desires to be fully participating members of public society. [...] With few exceptions, critical reception in the Arab world of these and other women poets has been lukewarm at best, for the most part, often filled with criticism of their adherence or lack thereof to poetic principles that have been held as prescriptive in mahy schools of Arabic literary criticism.<ref name="Clarissa Burt 2007 p. 78" /></blockquote>Alongside [[Maryana Marrash]], May Ziadeh, and [[Mary 'Ajami]], pioneering figures in women's writing in Arabic during this time period are [[Zaynab Fawwaz]] (modern Lebanon/Egypt, 1846–1914), who arguably wrote the first novel in Arabic and was the first woman to write a play in that language as well; [[Aisha Taymur]] (modern Turkey/Egypt, 1840–1902); [[Malak Hifni Nasif]] (under the pseudonym Bahithat al-Badiyya, Egypt 1886-1918); [[Anbara Salam Khalidy]] (modern Palestine/Lebanon, 1897-1988) [[Anbara Salam Khalidy]] (modern Palestine/Lebanon, 1897–1986) and [[Salma al-Kadhimiyya]] (Iraq, 1908–1953, under the pseudonym Umm Nizar).

Since the Second World War, Arabic women's poetry has become markedly more prominent.<ref name="Clarissa Burt 2007 p. 78">Clarissa Burt, 'Arts: Poets and Poetry: Arab States', in ''Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures'', ed. by Suad Joseph (Leiden: Brill, 2003-2007), V: 77-80 (p. 78).</ref> [[Nazik Al-Malaika]] (Iraq/Egypt, 1923-2007) was daughter of [[Salma al-Kadhimiyya]], who in her own right was a poet and a vanguard of the early nationalist movement. Al-Malaika alongside [[Badr Shakir al-Sayyab]], can be considered the initiator of the Free Verse Movement in Arabic poetry. Al-Malaika's poetry is characterised by thematic variations and the use of imagery. She also wrote ''The Case of Contemporary Poets'' which is considered a major contribution to Arab literary criticism.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RIB5qT9sGnwC&q=Salma+al-Kadhimiyya&pg=PA152|title=Historical Dictionary of Iraq|last1=Ghareeb|first1=Edmund A.|last2=Dougherty|first2=Beth|date=2004-03-18|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810865686|language=en}}</ref>

Other major post-war poetic voices include [[Fadwa Touqan]] (Palestine, 1917-2003), [[Rabāb al-Kāẓimī]] (Iraq, b. 1920), [[Jalīla Riḍa]] (Egypt, 1920-2001), [[Salma Khadra Jayyusi]] (Palestine, 1926-), [[Lami'a 'Abbas 'Amara]] (Iraq, b. 1927).

[[Saniya Salih]]'s (Syria 1935-85) poetry appeared in many well-known magazines of her time, particularly ''Shi’r'' and ''[[Mawaqif,]]'' but remained in the shadow of work by her husband, the poet [[Muhammad al-Maghut|Muhammad al-Maghout]]. Her later poems often address her relationship with her two daughters, and many were written during her illness as she died of cancer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arablit.org/2017/06/23/saniyah-saleh/|title=Friday Finds: The Poetry of Underappreciated Saniyah Saleh|date=2017-06-23|work=ArabLit|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}</ref>

Moreover, other Arab post-war poetesses include: [[Zubayda Bashīr]] (Tunis, 1938-); [[Ghada al-Samman]] (Syria, 1942-), known not only for poetry but also for short stories and novels, [[Su'ad al-Sabah]] (Kuwait, 1942-) and [[Hamda Khamis]] (Bahrain, 1946-) who is regarded as Bahrain's first female free-verse poet.

More recent Arabic literature has seen an even greater number of female writers' works published: [[Suhayr al-Qalamawi]], [[Ulfat Idilbi|Ulfat Idlibi]], [[Layla Balabakki|Layla Ba'albakki]], [[Zuhrabi Mattummal]], [[Hoda Barakat]] and [[Alifa Rifaat]] are just some of the novelists and prose writers. There has also been a number of significant female authors who also wrote non-fiction work mainly exploring the female condition in Muslim Societies, which includes authors such as [[Zaynab al-Ghazali]], [[Nawal el-Saadawi]] and author/Sociologist [[Fatema Mernissi]].

Women writers in the Arab world have unavoidably courted controversy. [[Layla Balabakki|Layla Ba'albakki]], for instance, was charged with obscenity and "endangering public morality" a few months after she published her collection of short stories titled ''Tenderness to the Moon'' (1963). The Lebanese vice squad actually traveled to every bookstore where the book was sold to confiscate all remaining copies because of its erotic content.

In [[Algeria]], women's oral literature used in ceremonies called ''Būqālah'', also meaning ceramic pitcher, became a symbol of national identity and anti-colonialism during the [[Algerian War|War of Independence]] in the 1950s and 60s. These poems are usually four to ten lines in [[Algerian Arabic]], and cover topics from the everyday, like love and work, to the political, like the struggle for independence. Since speaking [[Algerian Arabic]] was considered cultural resistance in itself at the time, these poems took on a revolutionary implication.<ref>Slyomovics, S. (2014). Algerian Women's Buqalah Poetry: Oral Literature, Cultural Politics, and Anti-Colonial Resistance. Journal Of Arabic Literature, 45(2-3), 145-168.</ref>

=== Contemporary Arabic Literature ===
Suffice to say although female Arab authors still risk controversy by discussing explicit themes or taboo topic in their works, it is a theme explored more explicitly and with more vigour due to greater outreach thanks to social media and more international awareness of Arab literature. More current Arab female writers include [[Hanan al-Shaykh|Hanan al-Sheikh]], [[Salwa Al Neimi|Salwa al-Neimi]] (writer, poet and journalist), [[Joumana Haddad|Joumanna Haddad]] (journalist and poet), [[Assia Djebar]]. [[Ahdaf Soueif]] and [[Yasmine El Rashidi|Yasmine El-Rashidi]] amongst others who confront less-talked about topics such as sex, prostitution, homosexuality and political censorship and prosecution within the Arab diaspora and also internationally in relation to Arab emigration.

Contemporary female Arab writers/poets/journalists alongside producing literature and non-fiction works often take on an activist role in their careers in order to highlight and improve the female condition in Arab society. This concept is embodied in female figures such as [[Mona Eltahawy]], who is an award-winning Egyptian columnist and international public speaker. She is best known for her unconventional comments on Arab and Muslim issues and her involvement in global feminism. In 2015, she released her book ''[[Headscarves and Hymens]]'' in which she argues the need for a sexual revolution in the Middle East.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/12/headscarves-and-hymens-why-the-middle-east-needs-a-sexual-revolution-mona-eltahawy-review|title=Headscarves and Hymens: Why the Middle East Needs a Sexual Revolution by Mona Eltahawy – review|last=Aspden|first=Rachel|date=2015-06-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref>

Contemporary Arab women's literature has been strongly influenced by the diaspora of Arabic-speakers, who have produced writing not only in Arabic but also in other languages, prominently English, French, and German. The Internet is also important in furthering the reach of literature produced in Arabic or Arab regions:

<blockquote>It is among the younger generation of poets that the Internet has become a platform for mounting collections and sharing poetry. Some of these poets have their own websites, while others are included on ever growing web anthologies being posted by young Arab computer geeks dedicated to the construction of web archives for Arabic poetry and poetic history. Similarly, critical treatment of these women's poetry, while now well established in on-line resources and web-based sites for major paper publications throughout the arab world, has yet to produce clearly defined critical means of articulating emerging values for poetry, for measuring the critical worth of some of these new productions, and for encouraging the production of Arab women's poetry which will have weight, depth, and acclaim comparable to the work of some of the major Arab male poets of our day.<ref>Clarissa Burt, 'Arts: Poets and Poetry: Arab States', in ''Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures'', ed. by Suad Joseph (Leiden: Brill, 2003-2007), V: 77-80 (p. 80).</ref></blockquote>

==Literary criticism==
Early on in the Arabic literary world, there has been a culture of academic criticism. The poetry festivals of the pre-Islamic period often pitched two poets against each other in a war of verse in which one would be deemed winner by the audience. Literary criticism also grew into theology, and thus gained a more official status with Islamic study of the Qur'an. Although nothing which might be termed 'literary criticism', in the modern sense, was applied to a work held to be ''i'jaz'' or inimitable and divinely inspired, an analysis was permitted. This study allowed for a better understanding of the message and facilitated interpretation for practical use, all of which help the development of a critical method important for later work on other literature. A clear distinction regularly drawn between works in literary language and popular works has meant that only part of the literature in Arabic was usually considered worthy of study and criticism.

Some of the first studies of the poetry are ''Qawa'id al-shi'r'' or ''The Rules of Poetry'' by Tha'lab and ''Naqd al-shi'r'' ''Poetic Criticism'' by [[Qudamah ibn Ja'far]]. Other works tended to continue the tradition of contrasting two poets in order to determine which one best follows the rule of classical poetic structure. Plagiarism also became a significant idea exercising the critics' concerns. The works of [[al-Mutanabbi]] were particularly studied with this concern. He was considered by many the greatest of all Arab poets but his own arrogant self-regard for his abilities did not endear him to other writers and they looked for a source for his verse. Just as there were collections of facts written about many different subjects, numerous collections detailing every possible [[Figure of speech|rhetorical figure]] used in literature emerged as well as how to write guides.

Modern criticism at first compared the new works unfavourably with the classical ideals of the past but these standards were soon rejected as too artificial. The adoption of the forms of European [[romantic poetry]] dictated the introduction of corresponding critical standards. [[Taha Hussayn]], himself keen on European thought, would even dare to challenge the Qur'an with modern critical analysis in which he pointed out the ideas and stories borrowed from pre-Islamic poetry.

==Outside views of Arabic literature==
Literature in Arabic has been influential outside the Islamic world. One of the first important translations of Arabic literature was [[Robert of Ketton]]'s translation of the [[Qur'an]] in the twelfth century but it would not be until the early eighteenth century that much of Arabic's diverse literature would be recognised, largely due to [[Arabist]]s such as [[Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot]] and his books such as ''Arabic Authors: A Manual of Arabian History and Literature''.

[[Antoine Galland]]'s translation of the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]'' was the first major work in Arabic which found great success outside the Muslim world. Other significant translators were [[Friedrich Rückert]] and [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]], along with many working at [[Fort William, India]]. The Arabic works and many more in other eastern languages fuelled a fascination in [[Orientalism]] within Europe. Works of dubious 'foreign' morals were particularly popular but even these were censored for content, such as homosexual references, which were not permitted in [[Victorian era|Victorian society]]. Most of the works chosen for translation helped confirm the stereotypes of the audiences with many more still untranslated. Compared to the variety and number of literature written in Arabic, relatively few historical or modern Arabic works have been translated into other languages.

However, towards the end of the twentieth century, there was an increase of translations of Arabic books into other languages, and Arabic authors began to receive a certain amount of acclaim. Egyptian writer [[Naguib Mahfouz]] had most if not all of his works translated after he won the 1988 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. Several other writers, including [[Abdul Rahman Munif]] and [[Tayeb Salih]] have been taken quite seriously by Western scholars, and both [[Alaa Al Aswany]]'s ''[[The Yacoubian Building]]'' and [[Rajaa al-Sanea]]'s ''[[Girls of Riyadh]]'' attracted significant Western media attention in the first decade of the twenty-first century.
