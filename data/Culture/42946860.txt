The '''cultural views of the navel''' vary significantly. In some cultures the [[navel]] is seen as sexually and culturally significant, and its exposure has been subject to a variety of cultural norms and [[taboo]]s, based on concepts of [[modesty]]. The views, [[customs]] and [[fashion]]s relating to the navel change from time to time, and such exposure has become more widely acceptable, as reflected in [[fashion design|design of clothing]].

==Western culture==
The public exposure of the male and female [[midriff]] and bare navel has been taboo at times in [[Western culture]]s, being considered [[Modesty|immodest]] or [[indecent]]. It was banned in some jurisdictions.<ref name="news">{{cite news|title=New code may reveal navel |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eLtPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gFMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3939,2026891&dq=navel+reveal&hl=en |accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=Mohave Daily Miner|date=24 March 1985}}</ref> Eventually, only female navel exposure was banned and not male because, it was argued, the simulation or upward displacement from vagina to navel was commonplace and obvious in women.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Elaine Perez Zickler |title=Elizabeth Bronfen, The Knotted Subject: Hysteria and Its Discontents |url=http://www.brynmawr.edu/bmrcl/Spring2001/Bronfen.html |volume=2 |number=2 |date=Spring 2001 |journal=Bryn Mawr Review of Comparative Literature |access-date=16 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116053623/http://www.brynmawr.edu/bmrcl/Spring2001/Bronfen.html |archive-date=16 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Community perceptions have changed and exposure of female midriff and navel is more accepted today and in some societies or contexts it is both fashionable and common, though not without its critics. Although American teenage girls are more likely to wear shirts that reveal their midriffs, this kind of clothing is often banned in high schools and stores. It is also inappropriate to wear clothing that reveals the midriff in professional settings like places of work. The exposure of the male navel has not been as controversial nor as common, and is usually in the context of [[barechested]]ness. Exposure of the navel by females is commonly associated with the popularity of the [[bikini]], of the [[crop top]] and [[Low-rise (fashion)|low-rise clothing]].
 
===Film===
In the United States, the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], or Hays Code, enforced after 1934, banned the exposure of the female navel in Hollywood films.<ref>*{{cite book |last1=Moseley |first1=Rachel |title=Fashioning Film Stars: Dress, Culture, Identity |date=2005 |publisher=British Film Institute |isbn=978-1-8445-7067-6 |page=136 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7dVkAAAAMAAJ&q=navel }}

During the 1950s, [[Joan Collins]] was prohibited by the [[Censorship in the United States|censors]] from exposing her navel in ''[[Land of the Pharaohs]]'' (1955). To get around the censors' guidelines, she wore a jewel, a ruby, in her navel.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZU3j3M8MAssC&dq=navel+censor&q=navel+#search_anchor |title=Three complete books |author=Joan Collins |publisher=Random House Value Publishing |year=1994 |isbn=9780517100745}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Elisabeth Bronfen|title=The knotted subject: hysteria and its discontents|year=1998|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn= 9780691012308|page=469|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNaakruoSJgC}}</ref> [[Kim Novak]] wore a ruby jewel in her navel for the film ''[[Jeanne Eagels (film)|Jeanne Eagels]]'' (1957); saying in an interview, "they had to glue it in every time.

By the 1960s, community standards had changed. Marilyn Monroe was allowed to expose her navel in ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' (1962) and later commented, "I guess the censors are willing to recognize that everybody has a navel."<ref>{{cite news|author=Bob Thomas|title=Mystique endears 30 years after death|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cSdZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CUcNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5273,3224419&dq=navel+reveal&hl=en|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=The Union Democrat|date=24 July 1992}}</ref> [[Ursula Andress]], appearing as [[Honey Rider]] in the 1962 [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', wore her iconic [[White bikini of Ursula Andress|white bikini]], which exposed her midriff and navel.

The Hays Code was abandoned soon after, and with it the prohibition of female navel exposure, as well as other restrictions. The influence of the National Legion of Decency had also waned by the 1960s. With the withdrawal of the Code and the change to a classification regime, the ban on the exposure of parts of the human body that had previously been regarded as immodest or indecent was withdrawn; and with it there was an increasing level of body exposure over time. The exposure of the navel ceased to be controversial in the context of a general increase in nudity.

During the late 1980s, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s animated heroines began exposing more skin as well. In the 1989 musical-fantasy film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', the lead protagonist, [[Ariel (Disney)|Ariel]], revealed her navel while wearing only fins and a seashell bra, a first in Disney's history.<ref>{{cite news |author=Deborah Bradley |agency=Dallas Morning News |title=Disney animators give Pocahantas the sexiest cartoon image ever |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DyJVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hDsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3796,2488695&dq=navel+sexuality&hl=en |newspaper=Beaver County Times |location=Beaver, Pennsylvania |date=12 July 1995 |quote=And in 1989's "The Little Mermaid," rebellious teenager Ariel flashed her navel (a Disney first) wearing little more than fins, a couple of seashells, and some cleavage. |accessdate=9 December 2015}}</ref>

===Fashion===
Exposed midriff is associated with the [[crop top]], often in association with [[Low-rise (fashion)|low-rise clothing]]. Another way that the navel may be exposed is via a deep [[plunging neckline]] dress or top that drops below the natural waist line.

Exposure of the male navel was limited well into the 1960s. The swimwear covered the lower abdomen and usually the navel. Occasionally the swimwear would be worn immediately below the navel. The swimwear evolved to longer legs and lower waistline.

The ancient Mediterranean, [[Hebrew]], [[Israelites|Israelite]] and [[Middle Eastern]] [[worldview]] commonly incorporated beliefs that shrines, important places (such as cities or capitals), or other such places of prominence had a position of centrality to the world and hence equated to the child-bearing, life-giving navel of a mother.<ref name="Sperling">{{cite book |last= Sperling |first= D |year= 1976 |chapter= Navel of the earth |title= The Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible: An Illustrated Encyclopedia (Supplementary Volume) |editor= Keith Crim |editor2= Victor Paul Furnish |editor3= Lloyd Richard Bailey Sr. |display-editors= 3 |editor4= Emory Stevens Bucke |location= Nashville |publisher= Abingdon Press |pages= [https://archive.org/details/interpretersdict00crim/page/622 622–623] |isbn= 978-0687192694 |chapter-url= https://archive.org/details/interpretersdict00crim/page/622 }}</ref> These domains constituted what contemporaries could regard as important [[Maternal bond|bond]]s that linked the universe.<ref name="Sperling"/> Thus [[Nippur]], an ancient city of the [[Mesopotamian people]], was often described{{by whom|date=January 2019}} as the "navel".<ref name="Sperling"/> This usage expressed connotations of the prominence of the location and the way it was seen to function as a place of centrality and as a link between earth and the heavens and the Universe.<ref name="Sperling"/> The Ancient [[Greeks]] regarded the conical stone ''[[Omphalos]]'' (meaning "navel") located at [[Delphi]] as the center of the earth.<ref name="Sperling"/>

====Bengali Cinema====
The navel culture is moderately popular in Bengali Industry. Though during the last decade it has been popularised. During the 1990s Actresses like [[Rituparna Sengupta]], [[Rachana Banerjee]], [[Indrani Halder]], etc. started showing off their navels in sarees mostly. Actress [[Rituparna Sengupta]] shows her navel during recent times also. Her navel has been spotted often in her recent films... Actress [[Koel Mallick]] kept her navel hidden for a long time, but in the movie [[Arundhati (2014 film)]] she bared her tummy completely and showed off her navel which created a storm among the fans. But She had not exposed her navel anymore again after that movie. Actress [[Sreelekha Mitra]] did a bare tummy show in the movie [[Ashchorjyo Prodeep]], in the scene she wore a blouse and petticoat and her stomach was bare. In recent times, Actress [[Raima Sen]] has shown off her navel twice. In the movie Roga Howar Sohoj Upay, Raima in a scene removes her saree and holds her lower belly in one hand in order to check her lower belly fat, her navel is seen from close up. In the web series [[Hello (web series)]] Season 1, in an episode, Raima is seen to be lying on her bed removing the pallu of her saree, and her husband is seen to be playing with her tummy, Raima then points to her navel and says that she wants a tattoo below it but her husband objects it. Actress [[Arunima Ghosh]] has done a couple of navel baring songs in the movie [[Bonku Babu]] and [[Eagoler Chokh]]. [[Swastika Mukherjee]] has shown her navel in the movie [[Shaheb Bibi Golaam]] and in the web Series [[Dupur Thakurpo]]. Actress [[Subhashree Ganguly]] has exposed her navel many times during the last eight years. She has bared her navel in the movies like [[Boss (2013 Bengali film)]], [[Romeo (2011 film)]], [[Bachchan (2014 film)]], and especially in the movie [[Prem Ki Bujhini]] where the hero often got distracted due to heroine's unintentional navel show. Subhashree is especially known for showing her navel in ultra-low waist dresses where a larger portion of her lower belly is also shown, but after her marriage, she has decreased her expose. Now rarely she exposes her navel. Actress [[Nusrat Jahan]] is quite regular with her navel show, from the onset of her career, even after her marriage she equally continues to show her navel. In the movie [[Khiladi (2013 film)]] the actress teases the hero by intentionally dropping her pallu and showing her navel. Another renowned actress [[Mimi Chakraborty]] has also started exposing her bellybutton in the last 2-3 years. Previously she did not show her navel and always kept it covered. But from the movie [[Total Dadagiri]] she started navel showing as she wore belly showing dresses in the songs of the movie. After some time she made a feather tattoo on her lower belly, after this incident she started full fledged navel showing in her movies and photoshoots mostly to show her tattoo. Her navel can be spotted in most of her recent photographs... Bengali Actress [[Srabanti Chatterjee]] is totally different, she has kept her navel hidden till date . Only in one of the songs of the movie Bagh Bandi Khela her pallu flies off and her navel is exposed for a couple of seconds, that's her first and last navel show to date. Actress [[Madhumita Sarkar]] showed her navel in the movie [[Love Aaj Kal Porshu]]. Madhumita has started full fledged navel showing in recent times as almost all of her recent posts in social media clearly show her navel.. Actress [[Ritabhari Chakraborty]] is also known for exposing her navel in her toned abs and mostly ultra-low waist dresses.. Actresses like Bibriti Chatterjee and [[Rii Sen]] are known for baring their navel piercings in their pics. Besides actresses like [[Paoli Dam]], [[Sayantika Banerjee]], [[Tanusree Chakraborty]], [[Koushani Mukherjee]], [[Rittika Sen]] has done occasional navel exposures . 
 
====Contradictions====
The [[Censor Board of India]] for [[Indian cinema]] has created some limitations on "vulgar" visuals, such as restricting zoom shots of the navel, kissing the navel, and squeezing the navel and waist. It had been implemented during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WNS7LhIfiv8C|title=Erotic justice: law and the new politics of postcolonialism |author=Ratna Kapur |publisher=Permanent Black |year=2005 |isbn=9788178241326}}</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2015}}<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Efv3V7Y9WzsC&pg=PA492|title=Writing the women's movement: a reader |author=Shohini Ghosh |chapter=The Troubled Existence of Sex and Sexuality: Feminists Engage with Censorship |editor=Mala Khullar |publisher=Zubaan |year=2005 |isbn=9788186706992 |pages=491–492}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Usha Rai|title=New censorship proposals on anvil|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7IhlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wJ4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1223,2950368&dq=navel+kissing&hl=en|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=31 July 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Censor Guidelines|url=http://www.chitraloka.com/exclusive/823-censor-guidelines.html|website=Chitraloka.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref> Many films have faced censor cuts for navel scenes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Does this censor know Telugu, asks Tollywood|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Does-this-censor-know-Telugu-asks-Tollywood/articleshow/16922326.cms|website=timesofindia.com|accessdate=15 August 2014|date=23 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Censor Board against Shreya's navel Shivaji scene|url=http://www.filmibeat.com/tamil/news/2007/shivaji-censor-board-220507.html|website=Filmibeat.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=List of Censor Cuts in Aagadu|url=http://www.gulte.com/movienews/30742/List-of-Censor-Cuts-in-Aagadu|website=Gulte.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Why 'A' Certificate for 'Power'?|url=http://www.iqlikmovies.com/news/article/2014/09/04/reason-behind-ravi-teja-power-getting-a-certificat/5352|website=iqlikmovies.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>

Japan has long had a special regard for the navel. During the early [[Jōmon period]] in northern Japan, three small balls indicating the breasts and navel were pasted onto flat clay objects to represent the female body. The navel was exaggerated in size, informed by the belief that the navel symbolizes the center of where life begins. On many middle Jomon figurines, the significance of the navel was emphasized with an indentation or hole. Sometimes, the importance of the navel was further enhanced by connecting with a line from the navel towards the chest.<ref>{{cite book |author=Nelly Naumann |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yrla4QyhFasC&pg=PA114|title=Japanese prehistory: the material and spiritual culture of the Jōmon period |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag |year=2000 |isbn=9783447043298 |page=199|author-link = Nelly Naumann}}</ref> Early Japanese poems feature many references to the female navel.

A similar type festival is held at [[Shibukawa]], north of Tokyo. The idea was formed based on the location of Shibukawa, which is also referred to as the "Belly Button of Japan". The festival is based on a traditional Japanese form of entertainment where revelers paint a face on their torsos and stomachs to appear as a head. A ''[[kimono]]'' is wrapped around the waist, and the person's real head is hidden by a large cloth hat. The belly button is traditionally painted into a mouth. In recent years, modern motifs and Japanese anime designs have appeared in the festival.<ref>Muramoto, Hiroyuki.

In the 1980s and 1990s, a visible navel was very rare.

In 2004, the [[President of Indonesia]] [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] spoke out against exposed navels, saying, "Indonesian women, who are known for their courtesy, should refrain from exposing their midriffs or belly buttons, which now seems to be taken for granted. There are many ways to express beauty, as part of aesthetics, and to express freedom but not by showing things that lead to pornography." He further added that while the state could not dictate dress codes, citizens were expected to respect the country's moral values and courtesy. A week later, a cabinet minister quoted Yudhoyono as saying that he felt "disturbed and uneasy" to see television shows in which women exposed their navels.<ref>[http://www.thejakartafpost.com/news/2004/12/22/contemplating-susilo039s-navel-fixation.html "Contemplating Susilo's navel fixation"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

In 2006, Agus Suwage, an Indonesian artist, installed his Pinkswing Park exhibit at [[Jakarta]]'s international biennale.The exhibit was surrounded by massive panels with multiple pictures of a near-naked man and woman frolicking in a park. Within days of the exhibition's launch, Islamic fundamentalists had descended on the biennale, forcing its closure and demanding prosecutions. At first police claimed his work blasphemed the story of [[Adam and Eve]]; a few weeks later they told Suwage he faced five years in jail for producing pornography. The Indonesian parliament decided to introduce a sweeping anti-pornography law. The law imposes a rigid social template; couples who kiss in public will face up to five years' jail, as would anyone flaunting a "sensual body part"—including their navel—and tight clothing will be outlawed.<ref>[https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/02/24/1140670261932.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap3 Navel gazing ruled out as Indonesians button up].
