==The Four Seals==

The Four Seals can be variously translated as follows:

*All compounded things are [[Impermanence|impermanent]]
*All emotions are [[dukkha|painful]]
*All phenomena are without inherent existence
*[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]] is beyond extremes<ref name="nutshell"/>
____________________________________________________________________

*All compounded things are impermanent.
*All contaminated things are suffering.
*All phenomena are empty and devoid of self.
*Nirvana is true peace.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dalai Lama |first1=Tenzin Gyatso |title=Mind in Comfort and Ease |date=2012 |publisher=Wisdom Publications |location=New York |isbn=9780861717101 |page=119}}</ref>

*Everything conditioned is impermanent.
*Everything influenced by delusion is suffering.
*All things are empty and selfless.
*Nirvana is peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=May |first1=Will |title=The Four Seals |url=https://bootl.org/html/caturlaksana.htm |website=www.bootl.org |publisher=BOOTL |accessdate=20 July 2018}}</ref>

As suffering is not an inherent aspect of existence<ref name="heart"/> sometimes the second seal is omitted to make Three Dharma Seals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yun|first=Hsing|authorlink=Hsing Yun|title=The Core Teachings|publisher=Buddha's Light Publishing|year=2008|page=49|isbn=9781932293326}}</ref> However, when the second seal is taken to refer to existence contaminated by or influenced by the mental afflictions of ignorance, attachment, and anger and their conditioning actions (karma), this omission is not necessary.
