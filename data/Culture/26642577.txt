{{distinguish|Sophistication (books)}}

'''Sophistication''' has come to mean a few things, but its original definition was "to denature, or simplify"{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}. Today it is common as a measure of refinement—displaying [[Taste (sociology)|good taste]], [[wisdom]] and subtlety rather than crudeness, [[stupidity]] and [[vulgarity]].<ref>{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjwEQgAACAAJ&dq=intitle:Sophistication |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History |author=Faye Hammill|year=2010}}</ref>
In the perception of [[social class]], sophistication can be linked with concepts such as [[social status|status]], [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]] and [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]ity.<ref>

== Scope of sophistication ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In social terms, the connotations of sophistication depends on whether one is an insider or an outsider of the sophisticated class.  Sophistication can be seen as "a form of snobbery," or as "among the most desirable of human qualities."<ref>

==History==
{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}
In [[Ancient Greece]], ''sophia'' was the special [[insight]] of [[poet]]s and [[prophet]]s.  This then became the wisdom of [[philosophers]] such as [[sophists]].<ref>{{citation |title=Sophistication |author=Mark Backman |chapter=The Roots of Our Sophistication |isbn=978-0-918024-91-6 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |year=1991}}</ref>  But their use of [[rhetoric]] to win arguments gave sophistication a derogatory quality. Sophistry was then the art of misleading.

The system of modern Western sophistication has its roots in France, arguably helped along its way by the policies of King [[Louis XIV]] (reigned 1643–1715).<ref>
For example: {{cite book |last       = DeJean
 |first      = Joan
 |title      = The essence of style: how the French invented high fashion, fine food, chic cafes, style, sophistication, and glamour
 |year       = 2003

 |quote      = In the sixteenth century, the French were not thought of as the most elegant or the most sophisticated European nation. By the early eighteenth century, however, people all over Europe declared that 'the French are stylish' or 'the French know good food,' just as they said, 'the Dutch are clean.' France had acquired a sort of monopoly on culture, style, and luxury living, a position that it has occupied ever since. [...] Beginning in the late seventeenth century, travelers were saying what novelists and filmmakers are still repeating: travel to Paris was guaranteed to add a touch of magic to every life. [...] [F]rom this moment on, that touch of magic became widely desired: elegance, luxury, and sophistication became factors to be reckoned with.

The English regarded sophistication as decadent and deceptive until the aristocratic [[sensibility|sensibilities]] and refined elegance of Regency [[dandy|dandies]] such as [[Beau Brummell]] (1778–1840) became fashionable and admired.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=413279&sectioncode=26 |journal=[[Times Higher Education]] |author=Deborah Longworth |date=2 Sep 2010 |title=Sophistication: A Literary and Cultural History}}</ref>

Recognised varieties of sophistication include:

* cultural sophistication<ref>

| pages      = 91–92
| quote         = The pursuit of cultural sophistication (Bourdieu's cultural capital) was until recently a niche phenomenon in America. It existed mainly in 'old-money' families, which dominated elite breeding grounds (prep schools, Ivy league universities, elite liberal arts colleges), and in the small Bohemian circles in the country's biggest cities. [...] The transformation of the American class dynamic from a single-minded striving for economic abundance to a multi-dimensional striving for sophistication in addition to abundance – a mixture of status pursuits more typical of Europe – was seeded in the 1960s.                   = adam markovich

| quote         = By the second half of the seventeenth century the experience of the Grand Tour marked the socially successful gentleman. In 1678 Gailhard noted that many travelled Englishmen regarded their home-bred compatriots as their social inferiors and affected foreign accents, fashions and mannerisms in order to demonstrate their sophistication.
