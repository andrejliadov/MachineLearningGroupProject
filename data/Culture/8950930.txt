Because memory is not just an individual, private experience but is also part of the collective domain, '''cultural memory''' has become a topic in both [[historiography]] ([[Pierre Nora]], Richard Terdiman) and [[cultural studies]] (e.g., [[Susan Stewart (poet)|Susan Stewart]]). These emphasize cultural memory’s process (historiography) and its implications and objects ([[cultural studies]]), respectively. Two schools of thought have emerged, one articulates that the present shapes our understanding of the past. The other assumes that the past has an influence on our present behavior.<ref>Schwartz, Barry. 1991. "Social Change and Collective Memory: The Democratization of George Washington."

''Handbook of Cultural Sociology''. London: Routledge.</ref> It has, however, been pointed out (most notably by [[Guy Beiner]]) that these two approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive.<ref>Guy Beiner, [https://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/3846.htm Remembering the Year of the French: Irish Folk History and Social Memory (University of Wisconsin Press, 2007], pp. 29-30.</ref>

==Historiographical approach==

===Time===

Crucial in understanding cultural memory as a phenomenon is the distinction between memory and [[history]].  [[Pierre Nora]] (1931 - ) put forward this distinction, pinpointing a niche in-between history and memory.

Scholars disagree as to when to locate the moment representation "took over". Nora points to the formation of European [[nation state]]s. For [[Richard Terdiman]], the [[French revolution]] is the breaking point: the change of a political system, together with the emergence of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]], made [[life (disambiguation) | life]] more complex than ever before. This not only resulted in an increasing difficulty for people to understand the new society in which they were living, but also, as this break was so radical, people had trouble relating to the past ''before'' the revolution. In this situation, people no longer had an implicit understanding of their past. In order to understand the past, it had to be represented through history. As people realized that history was only one version of the past, they became more and more concerned with their own [[cultural heritage]] (in French called ''patrimoine'') which helped them shape a collective and [[national identity]]. In search for an identity to bind a country or people together, governments have constructed collective memories in the form of [[commemoration (disambiguation) | commemorations]] which should bring and keep together minority groups and individuals with conflicting agendas. What becomes clear is that the obsession with memory coincides with the fear of [[forgetting]] and the aim for [[Authentication| authenticity]].

However, more recently{{when?|date=June 2019}} questions have arisen whether there ever was a time in which "pure", non-representational memory existed – as Nora in particular put forward. Scholars like [[Tony Bennett (sociologist) |Tony Bennett]] rightly point out that representation is a crucial precondition for human perception in general: pure, organic and objective memories can never be witnessed as such.

===Space===

It is because of a sometimes too contracted conception of memory as just a temporal phenomenon, that the concept of cultural memory has often been exposed to misunderstanding. Nora pioneered connecting memory to physical, tangible locations, nowadays globally known and incorporated as ''lieux de mémoire''. He certifies these in his work as ''mises en abîme''; entities that symbolize a more complex piece of our history. Although he concentrates on a spatial approach to remembrance, Nora already points out in his early historiographical theories that memory goes beyond just tangible and visual aspects, thereby making it flexible and in flux. This rather problematic notion, also characterized by Terdiman as the "[[omnipresence]]" of memory, implies that for instance on a sensory level, a smell or a sound can become of cultural value, due to its commemorative effect.

Either in visualized or abstracted form, one of the largest complications of memorializing our past is the inevitable fact that it is absent. Every memory we try to reproduce becomes – as Terdiman states – a "present past". This impractical desire for recalling what is gone forever brings to surface a feeling of [[nostalgia]], noticeable in many aspects of daily life but most specifically in cultural products.

==Cultural studies approach==

===Embodied memory===

Recently, interest has developed in the area of '[[Embodied cognition|embodied]] memory'. According to [[Paul Connerton]] the body can also be seen as a container, or carrier of memory, of two different types of social practice; inscribing and incorporating. The former includes all activities which are helpful for storing and retrieving information: photographing, writing, taping, etc. The latter implies skilled performances which are sent by means of physical activity, like a spoken word or a handshake. These performances are accomplished by the individual in an unconscious manner, and one might suggest that this memory carried in gestures and habits, is more authentic than 'indirect' memory via inscribing.

The first conceptions of embodied memory, in which the past is 'situated' in the body of the individual, derive from late nineteenth century thoughts of [[evolutionist]]s like [[Jean Baptiste Lamarck]] and [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Lamarck’s law of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] and Haeckel's theory of [[recapitulation theory|ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny]], suggested that the individual is a summation of the whole history that had preceded him or her. (However, neither of these concepts is accepted by current science.)

===Objects===

Memory can, for instance be contained in objects. [[Souvenir]]s and [[photograph]]s inhabit an important place in the cultural memory discourse. Several authors stress the fact that the relationship between memory and objects has changed since the nineteenth century. Stewart, for example, claims that our culture has changed from a culture of production to a culture of consumption. Products, according to Terdiman, have lost 'the memory of their own process' now, in times of [[mass-production]] and [[commodification]]. At the same time, he claims, the connection between memories and objects has been institutionalized and exploited in the form of trade in souvenirs. These specific objects can refer to either a distant time (an [[antique]]) or a distant (exotic) place. Stewart explains how our souvenirs authenticate our experiences and how they are a survival sign of events that exist only through the invention of [[narrative]].

This notion can easily be applied to another practice that has a specific relationship with memory: [[photography]]. Catherine Keenan explains how the act of taking a picture can underline the importance of remembering, both individually and collectively. Also she states that pictures cannot only stimulate or help memory, but can rather eclipse the actual memory – when we remember in terms of the photograph – or they can serve as a reminder of our propensity to forget. Others have argued that photographs can be incorporated in memory and therefore supplement it.

[[Edward Chaney]] has coined the term 'Cultural Memorials' to describe both generic types, such as obelisks or sphinxes, and specific objects, such as the Obelisk of Domitian, Abu Simbel or 'The Young Memnon', which have meanings attributed to them that evolve over time. Readings of ancient Egyptian artefacts by [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], the Collector [[Earl of Arundel]], 18th-century travellers, [[Napoleon]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[William John Bankes|William Bankes]], [[Harriet Martineau]], [[Florence Nightingale]] or Sigmund and Lucian [[Freud]], reveal a range of interpretations variously concerned with reconstructing the intentions of their makers.

Historian [[Guy Beiner]] argued that "studies of cultural memory tend to privilege literary and artistic representations of the past. As such, they often fail to engage with the social dynamics of memory. Monuments, artworks, novels, poems, plays and countless other productions of cultural memory do not in themselves remember. Their function as ''aides-mémoire'' is subject to popular reception. We need to be reminded that remembrance, like trauma, is formulated in human consciousness and that this is shared through social interaction".<ref>Guy Beiner, [http://www.drb.ie/essays/memory-too-has-a-history “Memory Too Has a History”] in ''Dublin Review of Books'' (2015). See also Guy Beiner, [http://www.drb.ie/essays/troubles-with-remembering-or-the-seven-sins-of-memory-studies “Troubles with Remembering; or, The Seven Sins of Memory Studies”] in ''Dublin Review of Books'' (2017). </ref>

==Between culture and memory: experience==

As a contrast to the sometimes generative nature of previously mentioned studies on cultural memory, an alternative 'school' with its origins in [[gender]] and postcolonial studies underscored the importance of the individual and particular memories of those unheard in most collective accounts: women, minorities, homosexuals, etc.

[[Experience]], whether it be lived or imagined, relates mutually to culture and memory. It is influenced by both factors, but determines these at the same time. Culture influences experience by offering mediated perceptions that affect it, as [[Frigga Haug]] states by opposing conventional theory on femininity to lived memory. In turn, as historians such as Neil Gregor have argued, experience affects culture, since individual experience becomes communicable and therefore collective.  A memorial, for example, can represent a shared sense of loss.

The influence of memory is made obvious in the way the past is experienced in present conditions, for – according to Paul Connerton, for instance – it can never be eliminated from human practice. On the other hand, it is perception driven by a longing for authenticity that colors memory, which is made clear by a desire to experience the real (Susan Stewart). Experience, therefore, is substantial to the interpretation of culture as well as memory, and vice versa.

==Traumatic memory transmission==

{{Main|Transgenerational trauma}}
Traumatic transmissions are articulated over time not only through social sites or institutions but also through cultural, political, and familial generations, a key social mechanism of continuity and renewal across human groups, cohorts, and communities. The intergenerational transmission of collective trauma is a well-established phenomenon in the scholarly literature on psychological, familial, sociocultural, and biological modes of transmission. Ordinary processes of remembering and transmission can be understood as cultural practices by which people recognize a lineage, a debt to their past, and through which "they express moral continuity with that past."<ref>{{Cite book|title = State Terrorism and the Politics of Memory in Latin America: Transmissions Across The Generations of Post-Dictatorship Uruguay, 1984–2004|last = Fried Amilivia|first = Gabriela|publisher = Cambria Press|year = 2016|isbn = 9781604979190|location = Amherst, New York|pages = 24, 26|url = http://www.cambriapress.com/books/9781604979190.cfm}}</ref> The [[Intergenerationality|intergenerational preservation]], transformation, and transmutation of traumatic memory such as of [[genocide]] tragic historical legacy can be assimilated, redeemed, and transformed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Adelman|first1=A.|title=Traumatic memory and the intergenerational transmission of Holocaust narratives|journal=The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|date=1995|volume=50|pages=343–367|issn=0079-7308|doi=10.1080/00797308.1995.11822409|pmid=7480412}}</ref>

==Studies==

Recent research and theorizing in cultural memory has emphasized the importance of considering the content of cultural identities in understanding the study of social relations and predicting cultural attitudes.

The Institute of Germanic & Romance Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London, has developed its MA degree around the above-mentioned topics.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20100222220029/http://igrs.sas.ac.uk/postgraduate/mamres-programmes/cultural-memory.html MA in Cultural Memory] has now been running for 10 years. This unique degree explores the many different ways in which culture is based on the construction, manipulation and transmission of memories, and the role played by memory in collective and individual identity formation.

The degree programme is supplemented by a Cultural Memory Seminar and by the [http://modernlanguages.sas.ac.uk new Centre for the Study of Cultural Memory].

In 2008, the first issue of quarterly journal ''[[Memory Studies (journal)|Memory Studies]]'' concerning subjects of and relating to cultural memory was published by [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]].

== Other approaches ==

[[Jan Assmann]] in his book "Das kulturelle Gedächtnis", drew further upon [[Maurice Halbwachs]]'s theory on [[collective memory]].<ref>Assmann, J. (1992) ''Das Kulturelle Gedächtnis: Schrift, Erinnerung und Politische Identität in frühen Hochkulturen.'' Munich: Verlag C.H. Beck</ref> Other scholars like [[Andreas Huyssen]] have identified a general interest in memory and [[mnemonics]] since the early 1980s, illustrated by phenomena as diverse as [[memorial]]s and [[retro]]-culture.  Some might see cultural memory as becoming more democratic, due to liberalization and the rise of [[new media]].  Others see cultural memory as remaining concentrated in the hands of corporations and states.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

== Cultural Memory and Human Rights ==
Cultural Memory has long been disregarded in terms of a native people's right to their culture and the memories contained therein. 

[[Lowry Burgess]] has also been spearheading the creation of [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-9SWjbTXfKbJDUU8fOUFTF7TO30yhvJo/view?usp=sharing “The 31<sup>st</sup> Article, Declaration and Resolution for The United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights, The Right to Historic Memory”]. These revolutionary documents create an ecosystem where The UN and the World Bank can provide protection for cultural historical memory and artifacts from destructive groups by using their existing credit system to provide humanitarian benefit to countries that protect and maintain historic sites and related cultural artifacts.

‘The Right to historic Cultural Memory’ derives from 50 years of the author’s public political experience, institutional administration, study and research, arts practice, world travel, teaching, seminars, public lectures, international conferences, books, publications, and bibliographies.
