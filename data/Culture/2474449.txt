'''Bespoke tailoring''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Bespoke.ogg|b|i|ˈ|s|p|oʊ|k}} is clothing made to an individual buyer's specifications by a [[tailor]]. 

==Clothing==

===Meaning of the term===
The word ''[[bespoke]]'' derives from the verb ''bespeak'', to speak for something, in the specialised meaning of "to give order for it to be made."<ref>Bailey, Nathan (1756). ''An Universal Etymological English Dictionary''. R. Ware.</ref> Fashion terminology reserves ''bespoke'' for individually patterned and crafted men's clothing, analogous to women's [[haute couture]],<ref>''Art of Textile Designing''. Global Media. {{ISBN|81-89940-03-1}}</ref> as opposed to mass-manufactured [[ready-to-wear]] (off-the-peg or off-the-rack). The term originated on [[Savile Row]], a street in London considered the "Golden Mile of tailoring".<ref name=Norton>{{cite web|last=Norton|first=Kate|title=Savile Row Never Goes Out of Style|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-10-31/savile-row-never-goes-out-of-stylebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|work=Bloomberg Businessweek|accessdate=14 December 2013|date=31 October 2006}}</ref>

Bespoke clothing is traditionally cut from a pattern drafted from scratch for the customer, and so differs from [[ready-to-wear]], which is factory made in finished condition and standardised sizes, and from [[made to measure]], which is produced to order from an adjusted block pattern. The opposition of terms did not initially imply that a bespoke garment was necessarily well built, but since the development of ready-to-wear in the beginning of the twentieth century,<ref>Ugolini, Laura (2003). ''Men and Menswear: Sartorial Consumption in Britain 1880–1939'', p. 181. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7546-0384-9}}</ref> bespoke clothing is now more expensive and is generally accompanied by a high quality of construction.<ref group="n">In article published in ''[[Textile History]]'' (Volume 34, Number 2, November 2003 , pp. 192–213. ''Ready-to-wear or Made-to-measure? Consumer Choice in the British Menswear Trade'') Laura Ugolini concluded that "interested and well-informed male consumers generally preferred to buy bespoke suits: while usually more expensive than their ready-made counterparts, these were also perceived to be better quality, better looking, and better value, and therefore most likely to enhance the wearer's sense of self-worth as a manly, discerning and successful consumer".</ref>

While the distinction conferred by haute couture is protected by law in France,<ref group="n">A certain number of formal criteria, including the design for private customers with one or more fittings, must be met for a fashion house to use the label and a list of eligible houses is made official every year by the French Ministry of Industry.</ref> the British [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] has ruled it is a fair practice to use the term "bespoke" for products that do not fully incorporate traditional construction methods.<ref name="Cockroft">{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2149810/Savile-Row-tailors-lose-fight-to-preserve-the-term-bespoke.html |first=Lucy| last=Cockroft| title=Savile Row tailors lose fight to preserve the term bespoke|work = The Telegraph |date=2008-06-19 |accessdate=2008-10-10}}</ref> The [[Savile Row Bespoke Association]], a trade group of traditional tailors, disagrees.<ref group="n">The tailor Richard Anderson wrote an article in the Telegraph to argue that "the ASA has got the ruling wrong" ({{cite web

===Compared to made-to-measure===
A gray area has existed between the extremes of bespoke and ready-to-wear since the end of the 19th century<ref group="n">In 1895, the [[Leeds]] Factory Clothing Co. veered between calling itself "manufacturing clothiers" and "bespoke tailors" (''cf.'' {{cite book

}}).</ref> in which a tailor measures the customer, but the garment is then made to the closest standard size, sometimes in a factory.<ref>Benson, John (2003). ''A Nation of Shopkeepers: Five Centuries of British Retailing'', p.102. I.B.Tauris. {{ISBN|1-86064-708-1}}</ref> The distinction made here is between bespoke, created without use of a pre-existing pattern, and [[made to measure]], which alters a standard-sized pattern to fit the customer.<ref name="Norton"/> Technological change makes this distinction more subtle, since fittings are increasingly required for   made-to-measure. A bespoke service may require an individually-cut pattern, which is then kept should further suits be required;    made-to-measure measurements are often stored on a computer. Even hand-work, often cited as a benchmark of bespoke, is now increasingly found in made-to-measure garments, while machine-making plays some part in the creation of most bespoke suits. With a bespoke suit, a pattern is designed and made from scratch based on the client's measurements, often from 20+ measurements involving multiple fittings, and takes considerably longer to produce than a made-to-measure garment.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sharpsense.ca/blogs/style-guide/made-to-measure-vs-bespoke-vs-off-the-rack |title=Made to Measure vs Bespoke vs Off the Rack |publisher=sharpsense.ca |accessdate=2017-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926235812/https://www.sharpsense.ca/blogs/style-guide/made-to-measure-vs-bespoke-vs-off-the-rack |archive-date=2017-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This ensures a precise fit, particularly in the shoulders as well as the posture areas. This [[custom-fit|custom fit]] is handy for clients with short or long necks, high or low shoulders, excess girth, high hips, large or flat seats, and more. Made-to-measure cannot adjust for these shapes and slopes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://joeydimz.com/bespoke |title=Bespoke |publisher=joeydimz.com |accessdate=2017-09-26 }}</ref>

In addition, new technologies have allowed for bespoke garments to be made with [[lean manufacturing]] practices and digital patterning, making new patterns within minutes and fully bespoke garments in hours, at a price point similar to made to measure or even [[mass production]].

===Advertising Standards Authority ruling===
In June 2008, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA), a British advertising regulator, ruled that an advertisement describing a suit "put into a 'working-frame' where it would be cut and sewn by machine"<ref name="Asa">{{cite web

}}</ref> because the use of the term bespoke was not deemed likely to confuse. The ruling was significant in formalising a less traditional definition of bespoke clothing, even though the older distinction with made-to-measure was recognised.

The ruling cited the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' definition of bespoke as "made to order," and considered that despite the fact a bespoke suit was "...fully hand-made and the pattern cut from scratch, with an intermediary baste stage which involved a first fitting so that adjustments could be made to a half-made suit,"<ref name="Asa"/> while a suit made-to-measure "...would be cut, usually by machine, from an existing pattern, and adjusted according to the customer's measurements,"<ref name="Asa"/> "both fully bespoke and made-to-measure suits were "made to order" in that they were made to the customer's precise measurements and specifications, unlike off-the-peg suits."<ref name="Asa"/>

Some, such as the etymologist [[Michael Quinion]], feel the ruling showed that "the historic term of art had moved on."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-bes4.htm |title= Bespoke|accessdate=2008-10-09 |first=Michael |last=Quinion |date= 2008-09-13| work=World Wide Words}}</ref> Some others concluded that "bespoke tailoring has traditionally, if unofficially, meant something more than the dictionary definition allows"<ref name="Sim"/> and that the ASA "took a rather ignorant decision to declare that there is no difference between bespoke and made-to-measure."<ref>{{cite web
