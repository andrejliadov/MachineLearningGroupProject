'''The 3000 Club''' started as a  [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]-based charity which works with food banks in [[Arizona]] in order to reduce [[food waste]]. The 3000 Club's main program is known as Market on the Move,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tucson.com/business/local/the-club-opens-tucson-warehouse-with-thrift-shop/article_0c5e6caa-6348-57c6-80b5-61390c4f7cf5.html|title=The 3000 Club opens Tucson warehouse with thrift shop|last=Tucson|first=Angela Pittenger {{!}} This Is|newspaper=Arizona Daily Star|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en}}</ref> although the organization provides other services for Arizona communities. Their previous mission statement was "Providing life saving fresh fruits and vegetables to impoverished families" has been changed to "nothing useful should end up in a landfill."<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.streamschurch.org/market-on-the-move.html|title=Market on the Move}}</ref>

Goals are aimed at improving the community, such as preventing 30,000,000 pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables from being wasted each year, refurbishing computers and electronics for educational use, redistributing useful medical supplies into 3rd world countries, working with same-minded organizations who believe there is too much waste.<ref name=":0" />

== History ==

Founder of the organization, Lon Taylor, found a need for funding the continuation of a [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] [[food bank]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nogalesinternational.com/news/losing-bid-may-have-been-a-blessing/article_23ce52e3-ba6c-5cc6-b711-ae1ff851f88e.html|title=Losing bid may have been a blessing|last=Holley|first=Denise|work=Nogales International|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en}}</ref> Ethel Luzario, an original member of the entrepreneurial community, joined the organization and expanded it to promote satellite food-banks.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://the3000club.org|title=The 3000 Club {{!}}|website=the3000club.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> In February 2008, medical reclamation was added to the composition of the non-profit. This was initiated by a movement created by Lon and Ethel after their visit to the [[Philippines]].<ref name=":1" /> With the opening of a Tucson warehouse, a working partnership now exists between the Southwest Medical Aid in Tucson, Arizona and the 3000 Club.<ref name=":1" /> This resulted in the redistribution of 2 million dollars in supplies in the summer of 2008.<ref name=":1" /> In 2010, partnering with local churches and other non-profits, Market on the Move was created. As of October 2014, the 3000 Club became unaffiliated with the Nogales food bank, in support of the Nogales Community Food Bank.

== Market On the Move (MOM) ==
[[File:Market Picture.jpg|thumb|299x299px|Produce for sale]]
Market on the Move is the flagship enterprise of the 3000 Club. It consists of satellite sites throughout Arizona, including Tucson, Phoenix, Flagstaff, Prescott, Casa Grande, and Surprise. The venue will vary but usually exists in parking lots of churches, banks, schools, parks, and other well-trafficked areas. The premise of MOM is to distribute unused produce to those in need and to stop the produce from being dumped in a [[landfill]], specifically the Rio Rico landfill.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} This includes up to 60 lbs of food for a donation of $10, on a suggestion "donate what you can" basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tucson.com/news/blogs/centsible-mom/market-on-the-move-returns-to-tucson/article_91c2aa5a-449d-58f0-b2f7-145ea52d8665.html|title=Market on the Move returns to Tucson}}</ref> MOM encourages the participants to share this produce with friends, neighbors, family members and local organizations. This produce sharing also goes towards environmental concerns in that produce waste is one of the main causes of methane gas being released into the atmosphere. These pick-up sites are open Saturdays and Wednesdays during the majority of the year. Signage guides visitors to the specific temporary set-up location. The rotating sites create a farmers market style. The market provides primarily vegetables, although fruits, citrus (seasonally) and melons are occasionally available.

== MOMers shop for a cause and MOMer's Corner ==

The store is open 6 days a week, Monday-Friday: 9am-4pm, and Saturday during Market On the Move. They are located at Tucson Warehouse, 4515 East 22nd Street, Tucson, Arizona, 85711<ref>{{cite web|last=Boyer|first=Pamela|date=9 September 2020|title=|url=http://the3000club.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

== Disaster Relief ==

The 3000 club accepts donations of any items such as clothing, household cleaning and utility items, dry and canned foods, and toiletries. These items go towards the aid of victims of any disasters, natural or otherwise, and to better prepare and collaborate with relief efforts.

The Salvation Army and Team Up for Tucson also offer donation opportunities locally.<ref>http://the3000club.org</ref>

== American Medical Aid Program ==

The American Medical Aid Program (The 3000 Club Medical Reclamation Project) has been working since 2008 to redistribute medical supplies and equipment to people in need. Supplies are distributed to people in local, national, and global communities. In addition, the program travels to other countries with a team of volunteers in order to provide medical service and supplies to populations in critical need.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tmcaznews.com/2014/05/23/medical-aid-program-puts-tmcs-old-equipment-to-new-uses/|title=Medical Aid Program puts TMC's old equipment to new uses}}</ref>

== Blanket Program ==

One of the 3000 Club's program is the "Blank Program". They focus on providing blankets to both [[Homeless veterans in the United States|homeless veterans]] and [[homeless shelter]]s. The 3000 Club partners with numerous organizations to distribute donated blankets to the over 45,000 homeless veterans and civilians currently in America. The program includes an option of donating $3 to supply a blanket to those in need. In donating a blanket the organization stresses the importance of it being more than just a material good that provides warmth and comfort, but one that creates a livable sleeping arrangement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the3000club.org </ref>

== Computer Refurbishing Program ==
The 3000 Club also refurbishes donated computers, appliances, and other goods in order to reduce waste and provide affordable electronics for the Tucson Community. Students from 5th through 12th grade on the Arizona Free Lunch program qualify for reduced prices on the program's goods.
