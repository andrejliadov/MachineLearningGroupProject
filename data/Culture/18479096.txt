==The Programme==
Each year around 25 Clore Fellows are selected for a seven to eight  month training programme in [[fundraising]], media training, [[Financial plan|financial planning]], and personal development.  They also participate in extended secondments to organisations outside their previous professional experiences.  Each Fellowship is individually tailored and the each Fellow receives support by a [[Mentorship|Mentor]] and individual coaching.

In addition, each Fellow can submit a proposal to undertake research once they have completed their Fellowship, which is funded by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and supervised by a Higher Education Institute.

Since 2006, the Programme has also offered short courses to a greater number of participants which capture a lot of the Clore experience in an intensive 2-week residential course.  It also offers training for members of Boards of Directors of cultural organisations.
