{{short description|Expression of gratitude for assistance in creating a work}}
In the [[Creative Arts |creative arts]] and [[scientific literature]], an '''acknowledgement''' (also spelled '''acknowledgment''' in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]]<ref name="gram">{{cite web | url=http://grammarist.com/spelling/acknowledgment-acknowledgement/ | title=Acknowledgement vs. Acknowledgment – Correct Spelling – Grammarist}}</ref>) is an expression of a gratitude for  assistance in creating an original work.

Receiving [[credit (creative arts) |credit]] by way of acknowledgement rather than authorship indicates that the person or organization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in question, but may have contributed funding, criticism, or encouragement to the author(s). Various schemes exist for classifying acknowledgements; Cronin et al.<ref name="Cronin">{{cite journal |last=Cronin |first=Blaise |last2=McKenzie |first2=Gail |last3=Stiffler |first3=Michael |title=Patterns of acknowledgement |journal=[[Journal of Documentation|J. Doc.]] |year=1992 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=107–122 |doi=10.1108/eb026893}}</ref> give the following six categories:
# [[moral support]]
# [[funding |financial support]]
# [[editing |editorial support]]
# [[presentation |presentational support]]
# [[technical support |instrumental/technical support]]
# conceptual support, or peer interactive communication (PIC)

Apart from [[citation]], which is not usually considered to be an acknowledgement, acknowledgement of conceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for identifying intellectual debt. Some acknowledgements of financial support, on the other hand, may simply be legal formalities imposed by the granting institution. Occasionally, bits of science humor can also be found in acknowledgements.<ref>{{Cite web

There have been some attempts to extract [[bibliometric]] indices from the acknowledgments section (also called "acknowledgments [[paratext]]")<ref name="Salager">{{cite journal |last=Salager-Meyer |first=Françoise |last2=Alcaraz Ariza |first2=María Ángeles |last3=Pabón Berbesí |first3=Maryelis |title="Backstage solidarity" in Spanish- and English-written medical research papers: Publication context and the acknowledgment paratext |journal=[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|J.
