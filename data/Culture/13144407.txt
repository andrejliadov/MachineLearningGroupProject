'''Cultural practice''' is the manifestation of a [[culture]] or [[sub-culture]], especially in regard to the traditional and customary practices of a particular ethnic or other cultural group. 

The term is gaining in importance due to the increased controversy over "rights of cultural practice", which are protected in many jurisdictions for [[indigenous peoples]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/canadian/canada/justice/ethnocultural-groups/ecg-003-00.html|title=Cultural Practices in Conflict with Canadian Law|publisher=nizkor.org|access-date=2007-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612235807/http://nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/canadian/canada/justice/ethnocultural-groups/ecg-003-00.html|archive-date=2007-06-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> and sometimes ethnic minorities.  It is also a major component of the field of [[cultural studies]], and is a primary focus of international works such as the [[United Nations]] declaration of the rights of indigenous Peoples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/drip.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011180532/http://www.converge.org.nz/pma/drip.pdf|archive-date=2007-10-11|title=United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples}}</ref>

Cultural practice is also a subject of discussion in questions of cultural survival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onefish.org/servlet/CDSServlet?status=ND0zODkyLjMwMjUxJjY9ZW4mMzM9ZG9jdW1lbnRzJjM3PWluZm8~|title=oneFish Community Knowledge Directory|date=27 September 2011|publisher=www.onefish.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927234707/http://www.onefish.org/servlet/CDSServlet?status=ND0zODkyLjMwMjUxJjY9ZW4mMzM9ZG9jdW1lbnRzJjM3PWluZm8~|archive-date=2011-09-27}}</ref>  If an ethnic group retains its formal ethnic identity but loses its core cultural practices or the knowledge, resources, or ability to continue them, questions arise as to whether the culture is able to actually survive at all.  International bodies such as the [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] continually work on these issues, which are increasingly at the forefront of [[globalization]] questions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBUD7nh8S74C&q=globalization+indigenous+cultural+practice&pg=PA109|title=Globalization: Culture and identity|first=Roland|last=Robertson|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Taylor & Francis|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415236911|editor1=Roland Robertson|editor2=Kathleen E.

==Qualifications==

The real question of what qualifies as a legitimate cultural practice is the subject of much legal and ethnic community debate.  The question arises in controversial subject areas such as [[genital mutilation]], indigenous [[hunting]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/message.aspx?&mst=404|title=Global Affairs Canada|first1=Global Affairs|last1=Canada|first2=Affaires mondiales|last2=Canada|date=26 June 2013|access-date=10 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826163843/http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/message.aspx?&mst=404|archive-date=26 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Intensive gathering|gathering]] practices,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WD-huzL13PgC&q=native%20gathering%20rights&pg=PA49|title=The Role of Customary Law in Sustainable Development|first=Peter|last=Orebech|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780521859257}}</ref> and the question of licensing of [[Traditional medicine|traditional medical practitioners]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camsociety.org/issues/Attitudes.htm|title=Traditional Chinese Medicine in Chinese-American Communities|first=Conrad|last=Wang|publisher=www.camsociety.org|date=Fall 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001021235131/http://www.camsociety.org/issues/Attitudes.htm|archive-date=2000-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ann.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/583/1/173.pdf|title=Traditional Medicine in Africa|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=September 2002|volume=583|issue=1|pages=173–176|doi=10.1177/000271620258300111|last1=Romero-Daza|first1=Nancy|s2cid=146286646}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The changing geography of traditional medicine: Urban herbalism on the Witwatersrand, South Africa|first=Rolf P.

Many traditional cultures acknowledge members outside of their ethnicity as cultural practitioners, but only under special circumstances.  Generally, the knowledge or title must be passed in a traditional way, such as family knowledge shared through [[adoption]], or through a master of that practice choosing a particular student who shows qualities desired for that practice, and teaching that student in a hands-on manner, in which they are able to absorb the core values and belief systems of the culture.  The degree to which these non-ethnic practitioners are able to exercise "customary and traditional" rights, and the degree to which their practice is acknowledged as valid, is often a subject of considerable debate among indigenous and other ethnic communities,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/eaglefeatherlaw/argument.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200511095748/http://www.geocities.com/eaglefeatherlaw/argument.html |archive-date=2020-05-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and sometimes with the legal systems under which these communities function.  The difference between bona fide non-native cultural practitioners and cultural piracy, or [[cultural appropriation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthcall.org/en/faq/|title=Frequently Asked Questions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050903191209/http://www.earthcall.org/en/faq/|archive-date=2005-09-03|publisher=earthcall.org}}</ref> is a major issue within the study of [[globalization]]<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ejcl.org/75/art75-7.html|title=Biotechnology, Patent Law and Piracy|volume=7|issue=5|first=Jerzy |last=Koopman|journal=Electronic Journal of Comparative Law|year=2003}}</ref> and [[modernization]].<ref>{{cite web|title= indigenous cultures|url=http://www.caslon.com.au/ipguide14.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213204315/http://caslon.com.au/ipguide14.htm|archive-date=2014-02-13|publisher=Caslon Analytics}}</ref>

==Evolution of culture==
The evolution of traditional cultures is a subject of much discussion in legal, scholarly, and community forums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/Saht_indig_way.html|title=Earthdance: Chapter 20 - The Indigenous Way|access-date=2007-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905111625/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~sai/Saht_indig_way.html|archive-date=2007-09-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>  It is generally accepted that all cultures are to some degree in a continual state of [[sociocultural evolution]].  However, major questions surround the legitimacy of newly evolved cultural expressions, especially when these are influenced by [[modernization]] or by the influence of other cultures.  Also, there is significant debate surrounding the source of evolution: for example, an indigenous community may accept the use of store-bought materials in the creation of traditional arts, but may reject requirements to apply for a permit for certain gathering purposes; the central difference being that one is an ''internal'' cultural evolution, while the other is ''externally'' driven<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/8152/Westernization-Africa.html|title=Westernization - Africa - Bibliography}}</ref> by the society or legal body that surrounds the culture.
