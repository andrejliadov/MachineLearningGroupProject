! The Story of the Blue Jackal is one story in the ''Panchatantra''
|-
| One evening when it was dark, a hungry [[golden jackal|jackal]] went in search of food in a large village close to his home in the [[jungle]].  The local [[dog]]s didn't like Jackals and chased him away so that they could make their owners proud by killing a beastly jackal.  The jackal ran as fast as he could, and not looking where he was going fell into a bucket of indigo [[dye]] outside the home of the cloth dyer.  The dogs ran further and the jackal climbed out of the bucket, wet but unharmed.

The jackal continued into the jungle and saw the [[Asiatic lion|lion]], King of the Jungle. The Lion asked him who he was and the jackal seeing that he had now turned blue declared himself as ''Chandru'' - protector of all the animals in the jungle.  ''Chandru'' told the lion that he would only continue to protect the jungle if all the animals would give him food and shelter.

Soon ''Chandru'' was sought for advice from animals from other jungles and animals sat at his feet and brought him the best of food.  But one full moon night, some jackals were howling. Chandru had not heard or seen them, so he howled back too.  The animals realised that he was an ordinary jackal and chased him far into the jungle, where he was never seen again.<ref name="panchatantra.org"/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060505220539/http://www.bolokids.com/2006/0049.htm The Blue Jackal : A Panchtantra Story by Swapna Dutta<!-- Bot generated title -->]  </ref>  <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030210213402/http://www.indiaoz.com.au/hinduism/kids_corner/panchatantra/panchatantra4.shtml A - Z Hinduism - Panchatantra Stories<!-- Bot generated title -->]  </ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=The Blue Jackal|url=https://www.tell-a-tale.com/panchatantra-the-blue-jackal/|website=Tell-A-Tale|publisher=Tell-A-Tale|accessdate=26 April 2016}}</ref>
