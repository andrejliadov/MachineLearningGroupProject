The '''cinema of Lebanon''', according to film critic and historian Roy Armes, is the only other cinema in the Arabic-speaking region, beside Egypt's, that could amount to a national cinema.<ref name="Armes, Roy page 26">Armes, Roy.

==History==
The history of film in Lebanon goes back to the 1880s.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=The History of Lebanese Cinema 1929-1979: An Analytical Study of The Evolution and the Development of Lebanese Cinema.|last=Arabi|first=Afif|publisher=Ohio State University|year=1996|isbn=|location=Columbus, OH, USA|pages=}}</ref> Two years after the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière Brothers]] publicly projected their first film in December 1885 (Paris, France), they began sending traveling representatives to tour different countries to show their movies. One of the cities that they visited was Lebanon's capital city, Beirut.<ref name=":4" /> Several years later, in 1909, the first movie theater was opened in the same city by the [[Pathé|Pathé Frères]]. These events helped cultivate a film-viewing culture into the country.<ref name=":4" />

===French Mandate===

A sharp increase in the number of theaters was observed between 1923–1929.<ref>Kassir, Samir. ''Beirut'', University of California Press; First edition (15 November 2010), page 267</ref> By the end of the 1920s, cinemas were common in Beirut, and some were used as a place for political gatherings. For example, in 1925, the Communist Party met at the Crystal Cinema in Beirut.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=200}} Cinemas had become so popular that in 1931, students marched in a protest, demanding that prices of movie tickets be lowered.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=200}} To compete against Hollywood, France decreed that all American films that were being imported to Lebanon be dubbed into French.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=201}}

The first local film, ''The Adventures of Elias Mabruk'', was made in 1929.<ref name="Ginsberg 2010">Ginsberg, Terri and Chris Lippard. ''Historical Dictionary of Middle Eastern Cinema'', Scarecrow Press (11 March 2010), page xxiii</ref> It was a silent film, directed by Jordano Pidutti.{{sfn|Shafik|2007|p=12}} Pidutti was an Italian immigrant who worked as a chauffeur for the [[Sursock family]] before devoting his life to film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://homemagazinelebanon.com/2016-04-07-14-47-47/item/1000-lebanese-cinema-film-makers-history-worlwide |title=CANNES 1957: THE DEBUT OF LEBANESE CINEMA |publisher=Home Magazine |accessdate=31 May 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143028/https://homemagazinelebanon.com/2016-04-07-14-47-47/item/1000-lebanese-cinema-film-makers-history-worlwide |archive-date=12 June 2018 }}</ref> His first film, ''The Adventures of Elias Mabruk'' tells the story of a Lebanese emigrant who returns to Lebanon after a long absence in America in search of his family.<ref>Sadoul, George.

Lebanese women, like [[Assia Dagher]] and [[Mary Queeny]], played pioneering roles in Egyptian cinema.  In Lebanon, Herta Gargour, who managed the film studio, Luminar Films, is credited with establishing filmmaking in Lebanon after the silent era.<ref name="Hillauer, Rebecca 2006 page 132">Hillauer, Rebecca.

Documentaries were also being made during this period, but they were heavily censored by the French.{{sfn|Thompson|2000|p=201}}

===Post-Independence===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IlaAyn-George-Nasser.jpg|thumb|right|''Vers L'Inconnu'', A Film by Georges Nasser]] -->
After Lebanon gained its independence from France, filmmakers began to examine local themes, especially rural life and folklore.<ref name="Armes, Roy page 7">Armes, Roy. ''Arab Filmmakers of the Middle East: a Dictionary'', page 7</ref> During the post-independence period, Lebanon witnessed an economic boom that made its capital, [[Beirut]], the financial center of the eastern Mediterranean.{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|p=70}} Lebanon's economic success, along with the presence of 38 banks and its open, multi-cultural and liberal society, made the country an alternative production choice to Egypt, which was at the time the center of filmmaking in the Arabic-speaking world.{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|p=71}} Additionally, "Lebanon had the region's best technical facilities" for film production.<ref>Chaudhuri, Shohini. ''Contemporary World Cinema: Europe, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia'', page 60</ref> Fully equipped studios were set up in 1952, such as Haroun Studio owned by Michel Haroun and Al-Arz Studio<ref>Khatib, Lina. ''Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond'', I. B. Tauris, London 2008, page 22-23</ref>

For the first half of the twentieth century, Lebanese cinema was very closely associated with Egyptian cinema.{{sfn|Shafik|2007|p=29}} In addition to exporting numerous Lebanese actors and actresses, such as Nour Al Hoda and [[Sabah (singer)|Sabah]], belly dancers like Badia Massabni and producers like [[Assia Dagher]], Lebanese distributors monopolized export of Egyptian film from 1930s – 1970s.{{sfn|Shafik|2007|p=28}}

The first Lebanese film to be featured In Selection at [[Cannes Film Festival]] was [[Georges Nasser (filmmaker)|Georges Nasser's]] ''Ila Ayn?'' in 1958.<ref name="Ham, Anthony page 411">Ham, Anthony. ''Middle East'', Lonely Planet 2012, page 411</ref> Despite its success abroad and having been screened at numerous film festivals, such as in Moscow and Beijing, the movie theaters in Lebanon hesitated to screen the film, and it only received a limited screening in Cinema Opera.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://homemagazinelebanon.com/2016-04-07-14-47-47/item/1000-lebanese-cinema-film-makers-history-worlwide |title=CANNES 1957: THE DEBUT OF LEBANESE CINEMA |publisher=Home Magazine |accessdate=31 May 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143028/https://homemagazinelebanon.com/2016-04-07-14-47-47/item/1000-lebanese-cinema-film-makers-history-worlwide |archive-date=12 June 2018 }}</ref> For its sixty-year anniversary, the film was screened again in its restored print version as part of the Cannes Classics events in 2017.<ref name="https">{{cite web|title=Georges Nasser, the grandfather of Lebanese cinema and director of ''Ila Ayn''?|url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/69-editions/retrospective/2017/actualites/articles/georges-nasser-the-grandfather-of-lebanese-cinema-and-director-of-ila-ayn}}</ref> George Nasser's work has been more appreciated in recent years, and the filmmaker, who teaches at the [[Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts]] has been showered with accolades, including at the Tripoli Film Festival, which was held in his honor in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Putting Tripoli on the International Screen |url=https://en.annahar.com/article/582594-putting-tripoli-on-the-international-screen}}</ref>

Co-productions with Egypt and Syria were common in this period, which was considered the "Golden Age" of the Lebanese film industry.<ref name="Armes, Roy page 7"/> Additionally, Lebanese producers from 1945 up to 1951 played an influential role in the first stages of production of Iraqi cinema.{{sfn|Shafik|2007|pp=27–28}}

====The Golden Age====

The film industry continued to prosper in the 1960s. After [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalized the film industry in Egypt in 1963, many private producers, distributors and directors, including [[Youssef Chahine]], moved to Lebanon.<ref name="Gugler, Josef 2015, page 103">Gugler, Josef. ''Ten Arab Filmmakers: Political Dissent and Social Critique'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington 2015, page 103</ref> The migration of film production to Beirut ushered a Golden Age, making Lebanon the film set for almost all Egyptian movies and establishing the Lebanese film industry as the second largest in the Arab world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Just Like the Movies: Lebanon's Film Industry|url=http://irresistible.alrifai.com/2016/03/23/just-like-the-movies-lebanons-film-industry-2/|access-date=31 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616153931/http://irresistible.alrifai.com/2016/03/23/just-like-the-movies-lebanons-film-industry-2/|archive-date=16 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Beirut rivaled Cairo's dominance of Arab filmmaking, and even briefly replaced it as the center for Arab filmmaking;<ref>Kiarostami, Abbas. ''The Cinema of North Africa and the Middle East'', Wallflower Press, London 2007, page 160</ref> however, films produced in the sixties, for the most part, lacked a sense of national identity and were merely commercial films, targeting a pan-Arab audience.<ref name="Armes, Roy page 7"/> For instance, Lebanese filmmaker, Mohammed Selmane made a series of Bedouin-themed films, like ''Bedouin in Paris'' (1964) and ''Bedouin in Rome'' (1965), both starring [[Samira Tewfik]] and targeting not only local but also Syrian, Iraqi, Jordanian and Gulf audiences.<ref>Leamen, Oliver. Companion Encyclopedia of Middle Eastern and North African Film, Routledge London, 2001, page 375</ref> Mohamed Selmane, who was trained in Egypt and returned to Lebanon to make 30 films in 25 years, was one of the most successful directors of this period.<ref name="Armes, Roy page 7"/>

The musicals of the Rahbani Brothers that starred [[Fairuz]] were an exception to the films that lacked a national identity. The Rahbani films were centered around nostalgic themes of life in [[Mount Lebanon]] villages.<ref>Stone, Christopher Reed. ''Popular culture and nationalism in Lebanon: the Fairouz and Rahbani Nation'', pages 75–76</ref> Nostalgia was a common theme in Lebanese film since 1929.<ref name="Seigneurie, Ken 2011, page 96"/> While many films in the sixties were filmed in the Egyptian vernacular to cater to the large Egyptian market, the Rahbani films were filmed in the Lebanese dialect.{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|pp=72–73}} ''The Seller of Rings'' (1965), set in a [[Maronite]] village and displaying folkloristic elements, was an adaption of one of their operettas to the screen.<ref name="Gugler, Josef 2015, page 103"/> Another Rahbani film, ''[[Safar Barlik (film)|Safar Barlik]]'', which was set in 1912, depicted Lebanon's struggle against the Ottoman occupation. The film became a staple rerun on Lebanese television, especially on Independence Day.<ref>Frishkopf, Michael. Music and Media in the Arab World, page 98</ref>

There were other exceptions like the auteur films of George Nasser and Youssef Maalouf. Georges Nasser's second feature, ''The Small Stranger'' was also selected for Cannes in 1962.<ref name="https"/> Youssef Maalouf adapted to film [[Kahlil Gibran|Kahlil Gibran's]] novel, ''[[Broken Wings (Gibran novel)|The Broken Wings]]'' in 1962.<ref>Seigneurie, Ken. ''Standing by the Ruins: Elegiac Humanism in Wartime and Postwar Lebanon'', Fordham University Press, 2011, page 97</ref>  Prints of the film ''[[The Broken Wings]]'' were believed to have been destroyed during the war, but one was found after the war stored in a church, and the film, starring stage actress Nidal Al-Askhar, was restored.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://filmthreat.com/uncategorized/the-broken-wings/ |title=The Broken Wings |publisher=Film Threat |date= |accessdate=4 June 2018 }}</ref>

Lebanon was also a filming location for international productions. For example, in 1965, [[Val Guest]]'s ''[[Where the Spies Are]]'', starring [[David Niven]] and [[Françoise Dorléac]], was filmed in Beirut.<ref name="Kassir, Debevoise page 407">Kassir, Debevoise, and Fisk.

Köhler, filmed his film, ''[[Agent 505: Death Trap in Beirut]]''. [[George Lautner]]'s ''La grande sauterelle'' was also filmed in Beirut in 1967.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061729/ La grande sauterelle (1967) – IMDb<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> ''[[Rebus (film)|Rebus]]'', starring [[Ann-Margret]] was filmed on location at the [[Casino du Liban]] in 1969. While ''[[Honeybaby, Honeybaby]]'' was shot in 1974 in Beirut, the producers of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', which was partially set in Beirut, decided not to film in the Lebanese capital due to the burgeoning political problems.<ref name="Kassir, Debevoise page 407"/>

In 1965, [[UNESCO]] established the Arab Cinema Liaison Center<ref>Ginsberg, Terri and Chris Lippard.

[[Heiny Srour]] became not only the first Lebanese and Arab woman to have her film in competition at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistikrezo.com/agenda/l-heure-de-la-liberation-a-sonne-documentaire-de-heiny-srour.html|title=L'Heure de la liberation a sonné – documentaire de Heiny Srour |publisher=Artistik Rezo |date=16 June 2016}}</ref> but her documentary film ''The Hour of Liberation Has Arrived'' was actually the first film by any female filmmaker to be screened at the festival.<ref>Stone, Rob, with Paul Cooke, Stephanie Dennison, Alex Marlow-Mann. ''The Routledge Companion to World Cinema'', Routledge; 1 edition (3 October 2017), page 209</ref>

===Civil War===
Prior to the civil war, 161 films, mostly commercial melodramas, were produced in Lebanon and exported to various Arab countries, but when the civil war began, film production decreased tremendously.<ref>Hillauer, Rebecca. ''Encyclopedia of Arab Women Filmmakers'', The American University in Cairo Press; 1 edition (2 February 2006), page 131</ref>

Despite the war, there was an "emergence of a new wave of Lebanese filmmakers – fostering, unusually, equal numbers of women and men".<ref name="Kuhn page 239"/> The female filmmakers, who emerged during this period, made highly acclaimed and internationally renowned films.<ref name="Leamen, Oliver 2001, page 374">Leamen, Oliver. Companion Encyclopedia of Middle Eastern and North African Film, Routledge London, 2001, page 374</ref> Some of the filmmakers who emerged during this period were "[[Maroun Baghdadi]], [[Jocelyne Saab]], [[Borhane Alaouié]], [[Heiny Srour]], [[Randa Chahal Sabag]]" and Jean Chamoun.<ref>Westmoreland, Mark R. "Post-Orientalist Aesthetics: Experimental Film and Video in Lebanon"</ref> In the 1970s, film themes in Lebanon were concentrated around the political conflicts that the country was undergoing.<ref name="Armes, Roy page 204"/> Displacement was also a recurrent theme as evident in Borhane Alaouie's ''Beirut, the Encounter'' (1981).{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|p=80}} Films of this period were characterized by a lack of closure, reflective of the seemingly endless war at the time.{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|p=82}}

One of the most important directors to emerge during this period was Maroun Baghdadi. According to Lina Khatib, author of ''Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond'', Baghdadi's films were "considered the cornerstone of Lebanese cinema".<ref>{{cite web|author=– Saturday |url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/the-view-from-lebanon?pageCount=2 |title=Page 2/3: The view from Lebanon |publisher=The National |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> Maroun Baghdadi made ''[[Little Wars (film)|Little Wars]]'' (1982) with aid provided by the American filmmaker, Francis Coppola.<ref>Kuhn, Anne and Radstone, Annette.

Documentaries by filmmakers like Jocelyne Saab who "adopted a mainly journalistic style" also developed rapidly and successfully during this period.<ref name="Kuhn page 239"/> Lebanese and Palestinian documentaries produced in Lebanon during the 1970s caused a surge of documentary production across the Arab world.<ref name="Armes, Roy page 26"/> These documentaries contributed to the development of feature film production in the early eighties.<ref name="Armes, Roy page 26"/>

''[[Beirut: The Last Home Movie]]'' is a 1987 documentary film that was directed by [[Jennifer Fox (documentary filmmaker)|Jennifer Fox]] and shot on location at the historic [[Bustros]] mansion in Beirut.

Despite the war, Lebanon submitted a film for the first time for consideration for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film when ''Promise of Love'' (1978) an Armenian-language film by Sarky Mouradian was submitted to the [[List of submissions to the 51st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|51st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1979 |title=The 51ST Academy Awards, 1979 |publisher=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences  |date= |accessdate=29 May 2018}}</ref>

In addition to the wave of festival films and documentaries, a series of commercial films, mostly mimicking action [[B movie]]s from Hollywood, were made in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|author=– Saturday |url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/the-view-from-lebanon |title=The view from Lebanon |publisher=The National |date= |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> Prominent directors such as Youssef Charafeddine and Samir El-Ghoussaini aspired for escapism in their films to take their audiences out of the context of the war.<ref>Khatib, Lina.

===Post-War Revival===
After the war, Beirut reemerged as one of the centers of mass media production in the Arab world.{{sfn|Westmoreland|2008|p=91}} While media production was concentrated around television, there were attempts to revive the film industry in Lebanon, especially by fresh graduates of Lebanese film schools. While filmmaking schools are a rarity in the region, by the mid-1990s, six of Beirut's universities were offering degrees in cinema and television and that attracted an influx of students from Arab countries who chose to receive some or all of their media training in Lebanon.<ref name="ReferenceA">Marks, Laura U. "What Is That and between Arab Women and Video? The Case of Beirut"</ref> Financing of film production in Lebanon in this period was mainly dependent on foreign support, both European and from the Lebanese diaspora.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The civil war was a major theme for Lebanese filmmakers since 1975, and this trend continued in the early post-war era where films continued to be affected thematically by the war.<ref>Khatib, Lina. ''Lebanese Cinema: Imagining the Civil War and Beyond'', IB Tauris & Company, London 2008, page xx</ref> Films made after the war had a common theme of returning to the war setting and dealing with trauma common to post-conflict societies.<ref name="Rastegar, Kamran 2015, page 155">Rastegar, Kamran.

Many films, such as Jocelyne Saab's experimental film, ''Once Upon a Time in Beirut'', examined the destruction that was left after the war.<ref>Ginsberg, Terri and Lippard, Chris.

In 1997, Youssef Chahine's French-produced film, ''Destiny'', was shot on location in Lebanon, including the historic mountain town of in [[Beiteddine]].

While many films produced in the 1990s were hits at international festivals, Lebanese viewers were not drawn to the mainly war-themed films. An exception was ''[[West Beirut (film)]]'' (1998), which was a local and an international hit. It was not only the first Lebanese film, but also the first Arabic-language film to have general release in America.<ref>Hammond, Andrew. ''Pop Culture Arab World!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle'', page 115</ref> The film, that received worldwide attention, was the first Lebanese film that the post-war generation in Lebanon actually saw in cinemas, and it ushered a new era in Lebanese filmmaking that historian, Lina Khatib calls a renaissance.<ref>Khatib, Lina.
