'''''The Good Place''''' is an American [[fantasy]] [[Television comedy|comedy]] television series created by [[Michael Schur]]. It premiered on [[NBC]] on September 19, 2016, and concluded on January 30, 2020 after four seasons and [[List of The Good Place episodes|53 episodes]].

Although the plot evolves significantly over the course of the series, the initial premise follows Eleanor Shellstrop ([[Kristen Bell]]), a woman welcomed [[afterlife|after her death]] to "the Good Place", a highly selective [[Heaven]]-like [[utopia]] designed and run by afterlife "architect" Michael ([[Ted Danson]]) as a reward for her [[Righteousness|righteous]] life. However, she realizes that she was sent there by mistake and must hide her [[Morality|morally]] imperfect past behavior while trying to become a better and more [[ethical]] person. [[William Jackson Harper]], [[Jameela Jamil]], and [[Manny Jacinto]] co-star as other residents of the Good Place, alongside [[D'Arcy Carden]] as Janet, an [[artificial being]] who assists the residents.

''The Good Place'' received critical acclaim for its writing, acting, originality, setting, and tone. In addition, the first season's [[twist ending]] and the show's exploration and creative use of [[ethics]] and [[philosophy]] have been positively singled out. Among other accolades, the series has received a [[Peabody Award]] and three [[Hugo Awards]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]]. It has also been nominated for fourteen [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]] for its third and fourth seasons.

==Premise and synopsis==
{{Anchor|Plot|Plot summary}}
The series is set in an [[afterlife]] in which humans are sent to "the Good Place" or "the Bad Place" after death: all humans are assigned a numerical score based on the morality of their conduct in life. Only those with the very highest scores are sent to the Good Place, where they enjoy eternal happiness with their every wish granted, guided by an [[artificial intelligence]] named Janet; all others experience an eternity of torture in the Bad Place.

In [[The Good Place (season 1)|the first season]], amoral loner Eleanor and small-time criminal Jason believe that they have been sent to the Good Place incorrectly. Eleanor's assigned [[soulmate]], Chidi, a [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]], attempts to teach them ethics so they can earn their presence there. Jason's soulmate, wealthy socialite Tahani, attempts to help Michael, the kindly designer of their neighborhood, deal with the chaos apparently caused by Eleanor and Jason's presence. Eventually, Eleanor realizes that the four humans have actually been in an experimental Bad Place all along, chosen by Michael to torture each other emotionally and psychologically for eternity.

In [[The Good Place (season 2)|the second season]], Michael repeatedly erases the humans' memories to try to restart their psychological torture, but they figure out the truth each time. Eventually they persuade him to take their side and attempt to get them into the Good Place for real. Michael appeals their case to the eternal Judge, who rules that the humans may be returned to their lives on Earth, with no memory of the afterlife, to attempt to prove their moral development.

Back on Earth in [[The Good Place (season 3)|the third season]], the group participates in a research study led by Chidi and his colleague Simone. Once they learn the truth about the afterlife, they try to help others improve their moral behavior. Eventually they discover that no one has been admitted to the Good Place in centuries. They propose that the points system is fundamentally flawed and set up an experimental simulated Good Place to test their thesis that humans can develop morally with proper support.

In [[The Good Place (season 4)|the final season]], the year-long experiment eventually proves that humans can show moral improvement in the afterlife. The group institutes a new system whereby deceased humans will earn their way into the Good Place by passing tests of moral development; and then, to avoid becoming numbed by the ennui of eternal bliss, humans may choose to exit the Good Place and peacefully end their afterlife. In the final episode, Jason, Chidi, and Eleanor eventually choose to exit; Tahani becomes a designer of afterlife environments, and Michael is allowed to be sent to Earth to live as a human.

* [[Michael McKean]] and Noah Garfinkel as Doug Forcett. Michael keeps a picture of Garfinkel as Forcett on his office wall as a reminder of the human who almost understood the afterlife points system. In a later episode, Michael McKean appears as an older Forcett trying to live the best life possible on Earth. Garfinkel appears as Forcett in the final episode.

====Other celestial beings====
* [[Jason Mantzoukas]] as Derek, a malfunctioning artificial rebound boyfriend created by Janet.
* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Gen, the judge who rules on interdimensional matters between the Good Place and the Bad Place.
* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Jeff the Doorman, the gatekeeper of the doorway between the afterlife and Earth. He has an affinity for frogs.
* [[Brad Morris]] as Matt, a suicidal accountant who works in a neutral office between the Good Place and the Bad Place. He is assigned as the accountant for Eleanor and Michael's experiment. He had been formerly assigned to evaluating "Weird Sex Things" in Accounting.
* [[Paul Scheer]] as Chuck, leader of the Good Place committee.  Ostensibly wanting to help Eleanor and her friends, he is very hesitant to make any actual action and is overly deferential to any demands by the Bad Place in negotiations.
* [[Stephen Merchant]] as Neil, the manager in the Accounting office where all the life points are calculated. He reveals that nobody has been sent to the Good Place for about 500 years.

NBC issued a press release on August 13, 2015 announcing it had given the then-untitled show a 13-episode order based purely on a pitch by Michael Schur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2015/08/13/michael-schur-returns-to-nbc-with-series-order-for-untitled-comedy-809314/20150813nbc09/ |title=Michael Schur Returns to NBC with Series Order for Untitled Comedy |work=The Futon Critic |date=August 13, 2015 |access-date=April 27, 2017}}</ref> On January 12, 2016, it was announced that Kristen Bell and Ted Danson had been cast in the lead roles for the series. The first synopsis of the show was also released, stating that the show was set to revolve around Eleanor designing her own self-improvement course with Michael acting as her guide<ref name=pressrel/> â€“ although the afterlife element had always been a part of the series, as Bell has stated she was aware of the first-season finale twist when she signed onto the show.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://twitter.com/IMKristenBell/status/822262583939895296 |title=Kristen Bell on Twitter |website=Twitter |date=January 19, 2017 |access-date=January 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203114207/https://twitter.com/IMKristenBell/status/822262583939895296 |archive-date=February 3, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

William Jackson Harper was cast as Chris on February 11, 2016,<ref name="Deadline-Harper"/> though the character was renamed Chidi. Jameela Jamil was cast as Tessa on February 25, 2016,<ref name="Deadline-Jamil"/> and her character was renamed Tahani. On March 3, 2016, Manny Jacinto was revealed to have been cast as a "sweet and good-natured Jason" whose "dream is to make a living as a DJ in Southern Florida".<ref name="Deadline-Jacinto"/> On March 14, 2016, D'Arcy Carden was cast in a series regular role that was announced as "Janet Della-Denunzio, a violin salesperson with a checkered past"<ref name="Deadline-Carden"/> â€“ although writer Megan Amram later admitted that this was an intentional hoax.<ref>{{cite podcast |host=Marc Evan Jackson |title=The Good Place: The Podcast - Chapter Seven: D'Arcy Carden and Megan Amram |website=Art19 |publisher=NBC |date=July 13, 2018 |time=6:16 |url=https://art19.com/shows/the-good-place-the-podcast/episodes/3cd97855-6d0c-413a-a891-df67560f6b41 |access-date=July 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713232440/https://art19.com/shows/the-good-place-the-podcast/episodes/3cd97855-6d0c-413a-a891-df67560f6b41 |archive-date=July 13, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Development===
The final premise for the show, including the afterlife element, was ultimately announced on May 15, 2016 when NBC announced its schedule for the [[2016â€“17 United States network television schedule|2016â€“17]] TV season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2016/05/15/nbc-augments-its-stable-schedule-with-ambitious-new-dramas-high-concept-comedies-and-unpredictable-unscripted-series-191305/20160515nbc01/ |title=NBC Augments Its Stable Schedule with Ambitious New Dramas, High-Concept Comedies and Unpredictable Unscripted Series |work=The Futon Critic |date=May 15, 2016|access-date=January 24, 2017}}</ref>

According to Schur, the premise and idea was to include religious elements into the series after doing research on various faiths and groups, but he decided to scrap the plans, instead going for a concept that included all faiths that was diverse and free of religious views. "I stopped doing research because I realized it's about versions of ethical behavior, not religious salvation," he says. "The show isn't taking a side, the people who are there are from every country and religion." Schur also points out that the setting (shot in [[San Marino, California]]'s [[Huntington Library|Huntington Gardens]]) already had the feeling of a pastiche of different cultures, stating that the neighborhoods will feature people who are part of nondenominational and interdenominational backgrounds that interact with each other regardless of religion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/good-place-religion-explained-mike-927402 |title=How Will NBC's 'The Good Place' Tackle Religion? |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Joanne |last=Ostrow |date=September 15, 2016 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014042813/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/good-place-religion-explained-mike-927402 |archive-date=October 14, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The series' setting and premises, as well as the serialized cliffhangers, were modeled on ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', a favorite of Schur's. One of the first people he called when he developed the series was ''Lost'' co-creator [[Damon Lindelof]]. "I took him to lunch and said, 'We're going to play a game [of] 'Is this anything?'" He then added "I imagine this going in the ''Lost'' way, with cliffhangers and future storylines."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/the-good-place-kristen-bell-ted-danson-michael-schur-1201828975/ |title='The Good Place' Boss Mike Schur: The Model in My Head is 'Lost' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Debra |last=Birnbaum |date=August 16, 2016 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917213814/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/the-good-place-kristen-bell-ted-danson-michael-schur-1201828975/ |archive-date=September 17, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The first season's surprise twist, that the Good Place was the Bad Place, and Chidi, Eleanor, Jason and Tahani were the four souls chosen because they were best suited to torture each other indefinitely, is very similar in premise to philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s stage play ''[[No Exit]]'', in which three strangers die, are escorted to a single room by a friendly bellhop where they are informed they must co-exist together. They ultimately determine they are entirely incompatible and thus come to the conclusion that "hell is other people". The only actors who knew the fictional truth from the start were Danson and Bell.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://decoy.tvpassport.com/news/twist-good-place-returns-after-last-seasons-surprise-ending?subid=national-00001 |title=With a twist: 'The Good Place' returns after last season's surprise ending |last=Spendlove |first=Jacqueline |work=TV Media |access-date=September 25, 2017}}</ref>

Critics have also suggested resemblances to 1960s surreal TV show ''[[The Prisoner]]'' in its isolated, rule-bound setting.<ref name="Splitsider Squires">{{cite web |last1=Squires |first1=Bethy |title=The Refreshing Artifice of 'The Good Place' |url=http://splitsider.com/2016/10/the-refreshing-artifice-of-the-good-place/ |website=Splitsider |date=October 25, 2016 |access-date=August 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830061109/http://splitsider.com/2016/10/the-refreshing-artifice-of-the-good-place/ |archive-date=August 30, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="AV Club Adams">{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Eric |title=Kristen Bell and Ted Danson find a great home in a Good Place |url=https://tv.avclub.com/kristen-bell-and-ted-danson-find-a-great-home-in-a-good-1798188961 |website=The A.V.

The editors of ''[[TV Guide]]'' placed ''The Good Place'' second among the top ten picks for the most anticipated new shows of the 2016â€“17 season. In its review from writer Liam Matthews, "NBC's new comedy has an impressive pedigree" (referring to Mike Schur and stars, Kristen Bell and Ted Danson, the latter cited as "arguably the greatest sitcom actor of all time"). Matthews concludes, "The hope is that their combined star power can restore NBC's tarnished comedy brand to its former glory. It won't be the next ''[[Friends]]'', but it's something even better: a network comedy that feels different than anything that's come before."<ref name="most exciting">{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/most-anticipated-new-tv-shows-fall-2016-editors-picks/ |title=Our 10 Most Anticipated New TV Shows of Fall 2016 |work=[[TV Guide]] |first=Alexander |last=Zalben |date=September 16, 2016 |access-date=October 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006014746/http://www.tvguide.com/news/most-anticipated-new-tv-shows-fall-2016-editors-picks/ |archive-date=October 6, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Philosophical inspirations==
{{original research|section|date=February 2020}}
''The Good Place'' makes use of many different theories of [[moral philosophy]] and ethics through the character of Chidi Anagonye, the moral philosophy professor. Within the show, there is reference to [[John Locke]], [[Tim Scanlon]], [[Peter Singer]], and [[Derek Parfit]], and "the show has covered everything from [[Jonathan Dancy]]'s theory of [[moral particularism]], to [[Aristotelian ethics|Aristotelian virtue ethics]], to [[Kantian ethics|Kantian deontology]], to [[moral nihilism]]."<ref name="vox">{{cite web |last=Matthews |first=Dylan |title=How The Good Place taught moral philosophy to its characters â€“ and its creators |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/26/20874217/the-good-place-season-premiere-season-4-moral-philosophy |website=Vox |date=September 26, 2019 |access-date=December 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206172411/https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/26/20874217/the-good-place-season-premiere-season-4-moral-philosophy |archive-date=December 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> UCLA philosophy professor [[Pamela Hieronymi]] and Clemson philosophy professor [[Todd May]] served as consultants to the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/how-ucla-philosophy-professor-pamela-hieronymi-helped-construct-the-good-place |title=How a UCLA philosophy professor helped construct 'The Good Place' |website=UCLA Newsroom |first=Jessica |last=Wolf |date=October 3, 2018 |access-date=January 31, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200131164555/http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/how-ucla-philosophy-professor-pamela-hieronymi-helped-construct-the-good-place |archive-date=January 31, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/2020/01/08/clemson-professor-helps-bring-philosophy-masses-nbc-show-the-good-place/2636244001/ |title=Forkin' Philosophy: Clemson professor and 'The Good Place' consultant Todd May shares his big ideas |website=Greenville News |first=Todd |last=May |date=January 8, 2020 |access-date=November 1, 2020 }}</ref>They both made cameo appearances in the final episode.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/31/21116261/the-good-place-series-finale-recap-whenever-youre-ready-season-4-door|title=The Good Place was groundbreaking TV.

The beginning of ''The Good Place'' takes its inspiration from the idiom "Hell is other people" from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s play ''[[No Exit]]''. In the play three people are trapped in Hell, represented as one room, and they torture one another psychologically while reflecting upon the sins that got them there.<ref name="vox" /> The concept "Hell is other people" is an often-misunderstood philosophical idiom meant to reflect that "Hell is other people because you are, in some sense, forever trapped within them, subject to their apprehension of you."<ref>{{cite web |last=Ambrosino |first=Brandon |title=Hell is other people ... misquoting philosophers |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/17/7229547/philosophy-quotes-misunderstood-wittgenstein-sartre-descartes |website=Vox |date=November 17, 2014 |access-date=December 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114081026/https://www.vox.com/2014/11/17/7229547/philosophy-quotes-misunderstood-wittgenstein-sartre-descartes |archive-date=November 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="den of geek">{{cite web |last=Mellor |first=Louisa |title=The 1944 Existentialist Play That Inspired The Good Place |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/the-good-place/275396/the-1944-existentialist-play-that-inspired-the-good-place |website=Den of Geek |date=August 4, 2018 |access-date=December 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113190544/https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/the-good-place/275396/the-1944-existentialist-play-that-inspired-the-good-place |archive-date=November 13, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The play ''No Exit'' acts as a direct inspiration for ''The Good Place's'' first season where it is revealed that the human-loving Good Place architect Michael is a demon sent from Hell to run an experiment on the idea that humans are their own best torturers. He selectively chooses a group of four people who he decides are perfectly offset to torture one another, and in the beginning it appears to work. Chidi tortures Eleanor with his indecisiveness, inflexibility, and scholarly disposition; likewise Eleanor tortures Chidi by constantly putting him in situations where he must make decisions or go against the very moral tenets he espouses. Tahani tortures Eleanor by continuously reinforcing her superiority, Jason tortures Tahani by being unable to return her incessant need for validation (as he is initially the silent Buddhist monk Jianyu), and for Jason the mere fact he is forced to pretend he is someone other than himself is torture in itself. Each character is designed to bring out what they hate most about each other and themselves, resulting in the new form of torture Michael is experimenting with.<ref name="den of geek"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Fienberg |first=Daniel |title=Critic's Notebook: Twisty 'Good Place' Finale Sets Up a Second Season That NBC Needs to Order |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/good-place-finale-critics-notebook-966705 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 4, 2018 |access-date=December 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118214247/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/good-place-finale-critics-notebook-966705 |archive-date=January 18, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The second philosophical inspiration of ''The Good Place'' is the question of whether studying moral philosophy can have a direct effect on how moral one can be. In season two Chidi becomes a teacher to Eleanor, Jason, Tahani and the demon, Michael. The show does not definitively answer this question, as Eleanor often struggles to decide which moral philosophy is best to abide by in her situations, but the lessons do encourage the process of self-reflection. By encouraging Eleanor to reflect on the moral implications of an act, her challenges encourage her to develop her capacity to see her choices as moral ones.  Morality is also created in Michael not through Chidi's lessons, which Michael uses as a means of torture, but rather through the relationships he develops with the characters.<ref>{{cite video |last=Pickard |first=Claire |title=The Philosophy of The Good Place â€“ Wisecrack Edition |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHk4_VePds |website=YouTube |publisher=[[Wisecrack (company)|Wisecrack]] |date=September 22, 2018 |access-date=December 1, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029020158/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHk4_VePds |archive-date=October 29, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The final major philosophical tenet of the show is named in one of the series' episodes, "What We Owe to Each Other", which is a philosophy book written by Tim Scanlon. According to the show's head writer Michael Schur, this "book forms the spine of the entire show".<ref name="vox" /> The book presents the idea of [[Contractualism]]: the idea is that "to act morally is to abide by principles that no one could reasonably reject".<ref name="vox"/> The show and the relationships between the characters act as an investigation into contractualism with the four main humans, Michael, and Janet forming their own society whereby they must act in ways that no one could reasonably reject even when that goes against the rules and tenets of higher powers. The overarching thesis of the show, greatly influenced by the contractualist theory is "the point of morality... isn't to accumulate goodness points, as in the elaborate point system the organizers of ''The Good Place'' and its corresponding Bad Place employ to determine who goes to which upon death. It's to live up to our duties to each other."<ref name="vox" />

==''The Selection''==
In September 2019, prior to the release of the fourth season of ''The Good Place'', [[NBC]] released a six-episode [[web series]] on their website, app, and their [[YouTube]] channel, titled ''The Selection'' (full title: ''The Good Place Presents: The Selection''), directed by [[Eric Kissack]]. The series, set during an [[Ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipsis]] taking place during the season 3 episode "Chidi Sees the Time-Knife", follows Michael's former demon boss Shawn as he and his underlings decide which four people to pick for Michael's new incarnation of "the Good Place". [[Marc Evan Jackson]], Josh Siegal, [[Bambadjan Bamba]], [[Amy Okuda]], and [[Jama Williamson]] form the main cast by reprising their roles from ''The Good Place'' as Shawn and his underlings, with [[Joe Mande]] reprising his role as Toddrick "Todd" Hemple in the third episode.<ref name="The Selection"/> At the [[72nd Primetime Emmy Awards]], the series was nominated for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Comedy or Drama Series|Outstanding Short Form Comedy or Drama Series]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2020/outstanding-short-form-comedy-or-drama-series |title=Outstanding Short Form Comedy Or Drama Series Nominees/Winners |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] |access-date=July 29, 2020}}</ref>
