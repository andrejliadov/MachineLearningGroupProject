'''Official culture''' is the [[culture]] that receives social [[legitimation]] or institutional support in a given society.<ref>Lewis (1992) p.31</ref> Official culture is usually identified with [[bourgeoisie]] culture.<ref> Foster (1995) p.vii</ref> For revolutionary [[Guy Debord]], official culture is a "rigged game", where conservative powers forbid subversive ideas to have direct access to the [[public discourse]], and where such ideas are [[Social integration|integrated]] only after being trivialized and sterilized.<ref>Debord (1957) pp.2, 10</ref>

For instance [[Pushkin]], which some scholar regard as Russia's first great writer,<ref name="Nab81Censors"/> attracted the mad irritation of the Russian officialdom and particularly of the Tsar, since he {{cquote|instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings (if write he must), composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification, in the audacity of his sensual fancy, and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants."<ref name="Nab81Censors">[[Vladimir Nabokov]] (1981) ''[[Lectures on Russian Literature]]'', lecture on ''Russian Writers, Censors, and Readers'', pp.13-4</ref>}}
