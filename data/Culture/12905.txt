'''Goth''' is a [[subculture]] that began in the United Kingdom during the early 1980s. It was developed by fans of [[gothic rock]], an offshoot of the [[post-punk]] music genre. The name ''goth'' was derived directly from the genre. Notable post-punk artists who presaged the gothic rock genre and helped develop and shape the subculture include [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], [[the Cure]], and [[Joy Division]].

The goth subculture has survived much longer than others of the same era, and has continued to diversify and spread throughout the world. Its imagery and cultural proclivities indicate influences from 19th-century literature [[Gothic fiction|of the same name]] and [[horror film]]s. The scene is centered on music festivals, nightclubs, and organized meetings, especially in [[Western Europe]]. The subculture has associated tastes in music, aesthetics, and fashion.

The [[music]] preferred by goths includes a number of styles such as gothic rock, [[death rock]], [[post-punk]], [[Cold wave music|cold wave]], [[dark wave]], and [[ethereal wave]].<ref>Nym, Alexander: ''Schillerndes Dunkel.

The style most often includes dark (usually solid black) attire, dark makeup, and black hair. The subculture has continued to draw interest from a large audience decades after its emergence.

===Origins and development===

The term ''[[gothic rock]]'' was coined by music critic John Stickney in 1967 to describe a meeting he had with [[Jim Morrison]] in a dimly lit wine-cellar, which he called "the perfect room to honor the Gothic rock of [[the Doors]]".<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Williams Record |date=24 October 1967 |author=John Stickney |title=Four Doors to the Future: Gothic Rock Is Their Thing}} Posted at {{cite web|url=http://mildequator.com/performancehistory/articlesreviews1967.html |title=The Doors : Articles & Reviews Year 1967 |work=Mildequator.com |accessdate=3 October 2012 |quote="The Doors are not pleasant, amusing hippies proffering a grin and a flower; they wield a knife with a cold and terrifying edge.

In a live review about a Siouxsie and the Banshees' concert in July 1978, critic [[Nick Kent]] wrote that, concerning their music, "[P]arallels and comparisons can now be drawn with gothic rock architects like the Doors and, certainly, early Velvet Underground".<ref name="Nick Kent">{{cite magazine|last=Kent|first=Nick|title= Banshees make the Breakthrough live review - London the Roundhouse 23 July 1978 |magazine=[[NME]] |date=29 July 1978}}</ref> In March 1979, in his review of Magazine's second album ''[[Secondhand Daylight]]'', Kent noted that there was "a new austere sense of authority" in the music, with a "dank neo-Gothic sound".<ref name=magazine>{{cite magazine|last=Kent|first=Nick|title=Magazine's Mad Minstrels Gains Momentum (Album review) |magazine=[[NME]]|date=31 March 1979|page= 31}}</ref> Later that year, the term was also used by [[Joy Division]]'s manager, [[Tony Wilson]] on 15 September in an interview for the BBC TV programme's ''[[Something Else (UK TV series)|Something Else]]''.

Outside the British scene, [[deathrock]] developed in [[California]] during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a distinct branch of American [[punk rock]], with acts such as [[Christian Death]] and [[45 Grave]] at the forefront.<ref>{{cite news |first=Liz |last=Ohanesian |title=The LA Deathrock Starter Guide |newspaper=LA Weekly |date= 4 November 2009 |url= http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2009/11/04/the-la-deathrock-starter-guide |accessdate= 10 July 2014}}</ref>

===Gothic genre===
The bands that defined and embraced the gothic rock genre included Bauhaus, {{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=429}} early [[Adam and the Ants]],{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=421}} [[the Cure]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/pornography-mw0000199022 |title=''Pornography'' – The Cure : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards : AllMusic |last=Mason |first=Stewart |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=27 October 2012}}</ref> [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]],{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=431}} [[Southern Death Cult]], [[Specimen (band)|Specimen]], [[Sex Gang Children]], [[UK Decay]], [[Virgin Prunes]], [[Killing Joke]], and [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2005|p=435}} Near the peak of this first generation of the gothic scene in 1983, ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]''{{'s}} [[Paul Rambali]] recalled that there were "several strong Gothic characteristics" in the music of Joy Division.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rambali, Paul |title=A Rare Glimpse into A Private World |journal=The Face |issue=July 1983 |quote=Curtis' death wrapped an already mysterious group in legend.

[[File:The Cure Live in Singapore - 1st August 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Lead singer and guitarist [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[The Cure]]]]
By the mid-1980s, bands began proliferating and became increasingly popular, including [[The Sisters of Mercy]], [[The Mission (band)|the Mission]], [[Alien Sex Fiend]], [[the March Violets]], [[Xmal Deutschland]], [[the Membranes]], and [[Fields of the Nephilim]]. Record labels like [[Factory Records|Factory]], [[4AD]] and [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet]] released much of this music in Europe, and through a vibrant import music market in the US, the subculture grew, especially in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Los Angeles, California]], where many nightclubs featured "gothic/industrial" nights. The popularity of 4AD bands resulted in the creation of a similar US label, [[Projekt Records|Projekt]], which produces what was colloquially termed [[ethereal wave]], a subgenre of [[dark wave]] music.

The 1990s saw further growth for some 1980s bands and the emergence of many new acts, as well as new goth-centric U.S. record labels such as [[Cleopatra Records]], among others. According to Dave Simpson of ''[[The Guardian]]'', "[I]n the 90s, goths all but disappeared as [[dance music]] became the dominant youth cult".<ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Simpson |title=Back in black: Goth has risen from the dead - and the 1980s pioneers are (naturally) not happy about it |work=[[The Guardian]]|date= 29 September 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/sep/29/popandrock |accessdate= 14 July 2014}}</ref> As a result, the goth "movement went underground and mistaken for [[Cybergoth|cyber goth]], [[Shock rock]], [[Industrial metal]], [[Gothic metal]], Medieval folk metal and the latest subgenre, horror punk".<ref name="theguardian.com" /> [[Marilyn Manson]] was seen as a "goth-shock icon" by ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''.<ref>{{citation |first=Chuck |last=Klosterman |title=Who: Marilyn Manson |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date= June 2003 }}</ref>

==Art, historical and cultural influences==
The Goth subculture of the 1980s drew inspiration from a variety of sources. Some of them were modern or contemporary, others were centuries-old or ancient. Michael Bibby and Lauren M. E. Goodlad liken the subculture to a [[bricolage]].{{sfn|Goodlad|Bibby|2007}} Among the music subcultures that influenced it were [[Punk subculture|Punk]], [[New wave music|New wave]], and [[Glam rock|Glam]].{{sfn|Goodlad|Bibby|2007}} But it also drew inspiration from [[B movie]]s, [[Gothic fiction|Gothic literature]], [[horror film]]s, [[Vampire lifestyle|vampire cults]] and traditional [[mythology]]. Among the mythologies that proved influential in Goth were [[Celtic mythology]], [[Christian mythology]], [[Egyptian mythology]], and various traditions of [[Paganism]].{{sfn|Goodlad|Bibby|2007}}

The figures that the movement counted among its historic canon of ancestors were equally diverse. They included the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844‒1900), [[Comte de Lautréamont]] (1846‒1870), [[Salvador Dalí]] (1904‒1989) and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (1905‒1980).{{sfn|Goodlad|Bibby|2007}} Writers that have had a significant influence on the movement also represent a diverse canon. They include [[Ann Radcliffe]] (1764‒1823), [[John William Polidori]] (1795‒1821), [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (1809‒1849), [[Sheridan Le Fanu]] (1814-1873), [[Bram Stoker]] (1847‒1912), [[Oscar Wilde]] (1854‒1900), [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (1890‒1937), [[Anne Rice]] (1941‒), [[William Gibson]] (1948‒), [[Ian McEwan]] (1948‒), [[Storm Constantine]] (1956‒), and [[Poppy Z. Brite]] (1967‒).{{sfn|Goodlad|Bibby|2007}}

===18th and 19th centuries===
[[File:Frontispiece to Frankenstein 1831.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus]]'' (1818) has come to define Gothic fiction in the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]]. [[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to 1831 edition shown.]]

[[Gothic literature]] is a genre of fiction that combines romance and dark elements to produce mystery, suspense, terror, horror and the supernatural. According to David H. Richter, settings were framed to take place at "...ruinous castles, gloomy churchyards, claustrophobic monasteries, and lonely mountain roads". Typical characters consisted of the cruel parent, sinister priest, courageous victor, and the helpless heroine, along with supernatural figures such as [[demon]]s, [[vampire]]s, [[ghost]]s, and [[monster]]s. Often, the plot focused on characters ill-fated, internally conflicted, and innocently victimized by harassing malicious figures. In addition to the dismal plot focuses, the literary tradition of the gothic was to also focus on individual characters that were gradually going insane.{{sfn|Richter|1987.}}

English author [[Horace Walpole]], with his 1764 novel ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' is one of the first writers who explored this genre. The [[American Revolutionary War]]-era "American Gothic" story of the [[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Headless Horseman]], immortalized in "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]" (published in 1820) by [[Washington Irving]], marked the arrival in the New World of dark, romantic storytelling. The tale was composed by Irving while he was living in England, and was based on popular tales told by colonial Dutch settlers of the [[Hudson Valley]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The story would be [[The Headless Horseman (1922 film)|adapted to film in 1922]],{{sfn|Koszarski|1994|p=140}} in 1949 as the animated ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'',<ref>"The American Film Institute, catalog of motion pictures, Volume 1, Part 1, Feature films 1941-1950, The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad"</ref> and again in 1999.<ref>{{cite news | author = Roger Ebert | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991119/REVIEWS/911190303 | title = Sleepy Hollow | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = 19 November 1999 | accessdate = 1 November 2010 | authorlink = Roger Ebert}}</ref>

Throughout the evolution of the goth subculture, classic Romantic, Gothic and horror literature has played a significant role. [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] (1776–1822), [[Edgar Allan Poe]]<ref name="Simpson">{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Simpson |title= Back in black: Goth has risen from the dead - and the 1980s pioneers are (naturally) not happy about it |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 29 September 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/sep/29/popandrock |accessdate= 14 July 2014}} "Severin admits his band ([[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]) pored over gothic literature - [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]]".</ref> (1809–1849), [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821–1867),<ref name="Simpson"/> [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (1890–1937), and other tragic and Romantic writers have become as emblematic of the subculture{{sfn|Goodlad|Bibby|2007|p=14}} as the use of dark eyeliner or dressing in black. Baudelaire, in fact, in his preface to ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' (''Flowers of Evil'') penned lines that could serve as a sort of goth malediction:{{sfn|Kilpatrick|2004|p=210}}

<blockquote><poem>''C'est l'Ennui! —l'œil chargé d'un pleur involontaire,''
''Il rêve d'échafauds en fumant son houka.''
''Tu le connais, lecteur, ce monstre délicat,''
''—Hypocrite lecteur,—mon semblable,—mon frère!''

It is Boredom! — an eye brimming with an involuntary tear,
He dreams of the gallows while smoking his water-pipe.
You know him, reader, this delicate monster,
—Hypocrite reader,—my twin,—my brother!</poem></blockquote>

====Visual art influences====
[[File:John Everett Millais - Ophelia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' (1851) by [[John Everett Millais]]]]

The gothic subculture has influenced different artists—not only musicians—but also painters and photographers. In particular their work is based on mystic, morbid and romantic motifs. In photography and painting the spectrum varies from erotic artwork to romantic images of vampires or ghosts. There is a marked preference for dark colours and sentiments, similar to Gothic fiction. At the end of the 19th century, painters like [[John Everett Millais]] and [[John Ruskin (painting)|John Ruskin]] invented a new kind of Gothic.{{sfn|Spuybroek|2011|p=42}}

====Styling====
[[File:CO223SAF.jpg|thumbnail|A male trad-Goth wearing [[Batcave (club)|Batcave]] style clothing.]]
Gothic fashion is marked by conspicuously dark, antiquated and homogeneous features. It is stereotyped as eerie, mysterious, complex and exotic.<ref name= lr>{{cite news |author=La Ferla, Ruth |title=Embrace the Darkness |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/30/fashion/sundaystyles/30GOTH.html |work=The New York Times |date=30 October 2005 |accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> A dark, sometimes morbid fashion and style of [[clothing|dress]],<ref name="grunenberg2">{{harvnb|Grunenberg|1997|p=172}}</ref> typical gothic fashion includes [[Hair colouring|colored]] black hair and black period-styled clothing.<ref name="grunenberg2" /> Both male and female goths can wear dark [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] and dark fingernail polish, most especially black. Styles are often borrowed from [[punk fashion]] and—more currently—from the [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] and [[1550–1600 in Western European fashion#Elizabethan Style|Elizabethan]] periods.<ref name=grunenberg2/> It also frequently expresses pagan, occult or other [[religious symbolism|religious imagery]].<ref name = "ELipton1">Eric Lipton [http://www.lettuce.org/clipGoff.htm Disturbed Shooters Weren't True Goth] from the Chicago Tribune, 27 April 1999</ref> Gothic fashion and styling may also feature [[silver]] jewelry and piercings.


[[File:Lady Amaranth.jpg|thumb|upright|Lady Amaranth, a gothic model, pictured in June 2008]]
[[Ted Polhemus]] described goth fashion as a "profusion of black velvets, lace, fishnets and leather tinged with scarlet or purple, accessorized with tightly laced corsets, gloves, precarious stilettos and silver jewelry depicting religious or occult themes".<ref>{{cite book |last=Polhemus |first=Ted |author-link=Ted Polhemus |year=1994 |title=Street Style |location=London |publisher=Thames & Hudson |page=97}} Cited in {{harvnb|Mellins|2013|pp=17–18}}.</ref> Of the male "goth look", goth historian Pete Scathe draws a distinction between the Sid Vicious archetype of black spiky hair and black leather jacket in contrast to the gender ambiguous guys wearing makeup. The first is the early goth gig-going look, which was essentially punk, whereas the second is what evolved into the Batcave nightclub look. Early goth gigs were often very hectic affairs, and the audience dressed accordingly.

In contrast to the [[Live action role-playing game#Genres|LARP]]-based Victorian and Elizabethan pomposity of the 2000s, the more Romantic side of 1980s trad-goth—mainly represented by women—was characterized by new wave/post-punk-oriented hairstyles (both long and short, partly shaved and teased) and street-compliant clothing, including black frill blouses, midi dresses or tea-length skirts, and floral lace tights, Dr. Martens, spike heels (pumps), and pointed toe buckle boots ([[winklepickers]]), sometimes supplemented with accessories such as bracelets, chokers and bib necklaces. This style, retroactively referred to as ''Ethergoth'', took its inspiration from Siouxsie Sioux and mid-1980s protagonists from the 4AD roster like Liz Fraser and Lisa Gerrard.<ref>Aurelio Voltaire Hernandez: ''What Is Goth?'', Publishers Group UK, {{ISBN|1-578-63322-2}}<br />''"Serene, thoughtful and creative, ethergoths are defined by their affinity ... darkwave and classically inspired Gothic music. Ethergoths are more likely to be found sipping tea, writing poetry and listening to the Cocteau Twins than jumping up and down at a club."''</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' noted: "The costumes and ornaments are a glamorous cover for the genre's somber themes. In the world of Goth, nature itself lurks as a malign protagonist, causing flesh to rot, rivers to flood, monuments to crumble and women to turn into slatterns, their hair streaming and lipstick askew".<ref name= lr/>

====Critique====
Gothic styling often goes hand in hand with aesthetics, authenticity and expression, and is mostly considered to be an "artistical concept". Clothes are frequently self-designed.

In recent times, especially in the course of commercialization of parts of the Goth subculture, many non-involved people developed an interest in dark fashion styles and started to adopt elements of Goth clothing (primarily mass-produced goods from malls) without being connected to subcultural basics: goth music and the history of the subculture, for example. Within the Goth movement they have been regularly described as "poseurs" or "mallgoths"''.''<ref>Nancy Kilpatrick. ''Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined''. St. Martin's Griffin, 2004, p. 24</ref> (See also section ''[[#Identity|Identity]]'').

[[File:The Hunger film poster.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Film poster for ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'', an influence in the early days of the goth subculture{{sfn|Ladouceur|2011|pp=137–138}}]]
Some of the early gothic rock and deathrock artists adopted traditional horror film images and drew on horror film soundtracks for inspiration. Their audiences responded by adopting appropriate dress and props. Use of standard horror film props such as swirling smoke, rubber bats, and cobwebs featured as gothic club décor from the beginning in The Batcave. Such references in bands' music and images were originally [[tongue-in-cheek]], but as time went on, bands and members of the subculture took the connection more seriously. As a result, morbid, [[supernatural]] and [[occult]] themes became more noticeably serious in the subculture. The interconnection between horror and goth was highlighted in its early days by ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'', a 1983 vampire film starring [[David Bowie]], [[Catherine Deneuve]] and [[Susan Sarandon]]. The film featured gothic rock group Bauhaus performing ''Bela Lugosi's Dead'' in a nightclub. [[Tim Burton]] created a storybook atmosphere filled with darkness and shadow in some of his films like ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990), ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992) and the [[stop motion]] films ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993), which was produced/co-written by Burton, and ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (2005), which he co-produced. The [[Nickelodeon]] cartoon ''[[Invader Zim]]'' is also based on the goth subculture.

As the subculture became well-established, the connection between goth and horror fiction became almost a cliché, with goths quite likely to appear as characters in horror novels and film. For example, ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'', ''[[The Crow (franchise)|The Crow]]'', ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' and ''[[Underworld (film series)|Underworld]]'' film series drew directly on goth music and style. The dark comedies ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', ''[[The Faculty (film)|The Faculty]]'', ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'', and a few episodes of the animated TV show ''[[South Park]]'' portray or parody the goth subculture. In ''South Park'', several of the fictional schoolchildren are depicted as goths. The goth kids on the show are depicted as finding it annoying to be confused with the [[Hot Topic]] "[[Vampire lifestyle|vampire]]" kids from the episode "[[The Ungroundable]]" in season 12,<ref>Modell, Josh (19 November 2008). "The Ungroundable". ''The A.V. Club''.</ref><ref>Fickett, Travis (20 November 2008). "IGN: The Ungroundable Review". IGN. News Corporation. Retrieved 2008-11-23.</ref> and even more frustrating to be compared with [[emo]] kids. The goth kids are usually depicted listening to [[Gothic rock|goth music]], writing or reading Gothic poetry, drinking coffee, flipping their hair, and smoking. [[Morticia Addams]] from [[The Addams Family]] created by [[Charles Addams]] is a fictional character and the mother in the Addams family. Morticia was played by [[Carolyn Jones]] in the 1964 television show [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|''The Addams Family'']], and then played by [[Anjelica Huston]] in the [[The Addams Family (1991 film)|1991 version]].<ref>Modell, Josh (19 November 2008).

===Books and magazines===
{{Main|Gothic fiction}}
A prominent American literary influence on the gothic scene was provided by [[Anne Rice]]'s re-imagining of the vampire in 1976. In ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'', Rice's characters were depicted as self-tormentors who struggled with alienation, loneliness, and the human condition. Not only did the characters torment themselves, but they also depicted a surreal world that focused on uncovering its splendour. These Chronicles assumed goth attitudes, but they were not intentionally created to represent the gothic subculture. Their romance, beauty, and erotic appeal attracted
many goth readers, making her works popular from the 1980s through the 1990s.{{sfn|Jones|2015|pp=179–204}} While Goth has embraced [[Vampire literature]] both in its 19th century form and in its later incarnations, Rice's [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] take on the vampire mythos has had a "special resonance" in the subculture. Her vampire novels feature intense emotions, period clothing, and "cultured decadence". Her vampires are [[social alienation|socially alienated]] monsters, but they are also stunningly attractive. Rice's goth readers tend to envision themselves in much the same terms and view characters like [[Lestat de Lioncourt]] as [[role model]]s.{{sfn|Goodlad|Bibby|2007}}

[[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s novel ''[[Native Son]]'' contains gothic imagery and themes that demonstrate the links between blackness and the gothic; themes and images of "premonitions, curses, prophecies, spells, veils, demonic possessions, graves, skeletons" are present, suggesting gothic influence.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Smethurst|first=James|date=Spring 2001|title=Invented by Horror: The Gothic and African American Literary Ideology in Native Son|journal=African American Review|volume=35|issue=1|pages=29–30|doi=10.2307/2903332|jstor=2903332}}</ref> Other classic themes of the gothic are present in the novel, such as transgression and unstable identities of race, class, gender, and nationality.<ref name=":1" />

The re-imagining of the vampire continued with the release of [[Poppy Z. Brite]]'s book ''[[Lost Souls (Poppy Z. Brite novel)|Lost Souls]]'' in October 1992. Despite the fact that Brite's first novel was criticized by some mainstream sources for allegedly "lack[ing] a moral center: neither terrifyingly malevolent supernatural creatures nor (like Anne Rice's protagonists) tortured souls torn between good and evil, these vampires simply add blood-drinking to the amoral panoply of drug abuse, problem drinking and empty sex practiced by their human counterparts",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-30875-5 |title=firction reviews: Lost Souls by Poppy Z. Brite |work=publishersweekly.com|date=31 August 1992 |accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref> many of these so-called "human counterparts" identified with the teen angst and goth music references therein, keeping the book in print. Upon release of a special 10th anniversary edition of ''Lost Souls'', ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''—the same periodical that criticized the novel's "amorality" a decade prior—deemed it a "modern horror classic" and acknowledged that Brite established a "cult audience".<ref>{{cite web |title=Fiction review: The American Fantasy Tradition by Brian M.

[[Neil Gaiman]]'s graphic novel series ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' influenced goths with characters like the dark, brooding [[Dream (comics)|Dream]] and his sister, [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The 2002 release ''21st Century Goth'' by [[Mick Mercer]], an author, noted music journalist and leading historian of gothic rock,<ref>Blu [http://www.starvox.net/intview/mm.htm Interview with Mick Mercer] Starvox.net</ref><ref>Kyshah Hell [http://www.morbidoutlook.com/lifestyle/articles/2002_06_mickmercer.html Interview with Mick Mercer] Morbidoutlook.com</ref><ref>[http://www.brokenanklebooks.com/AuthorsMercer.htm Mick Mercer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070409035909/http://brokenanklebooks.com/AuthorsMercer.htm |date=9 April 2007 }} Broken Ankle Books</ref> explored the modern state of the goth scene around the world, including [[South America]], [[Japan]], and mainland [[Asia]]. His previous 1997 release, ''Hex Files: The Goth Bible'', similarly took an international look at the subculture.

In the US, ''[[Propaganda (magazine)|Propaganda]]'' was a gothic subculture magazine founded in 1982. In Italy, ''Ver Sacrum'' covers the Italian goth scene, including fashion, sexuality, music, art and literature. Some magazines, such as the now-defunct ''Dark Realms''<ref>''[http://www.monolithgraphics.com/darkrealms.html Dark Realms]''</ref> and ''Goth Is Dead'' included goth fiction and poetry. Other magazines cover fashion (e.g., ''[[Gothic Beauty]]''); music (e.g., ''Severance'') or culture and lifestyle (e.g., ''Althaus'' e-zine).

===Events===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}
[[File:Ddf5poster.png|thumb|upright=0.9|A poster for the 2007 [[Drop Dead Festival]]]]
There are large annual goth-themed festivals in [[Germany]], including [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] in [[Leipzig]] and [[M'era Luna]] in [[Hildesheim)]], both annually attracting tens of thousands of people. [[Castle Party]] is the biggest goth festival in Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://castleparty.com/|title=Festival Website}}</ref> The [[Lumous Gothic Festival]] (more commonly known as Lumous) is the largest festival dedicated to the goth subculture in [[Finland]] and the northernmost gothic festival in the world. The Ukrainian festival "Deti Nochi: Chorna Rada" (Children of the night) is the biggest gothic event in Ukraine. Goth events like "Ghoul School" and "Release the Bats" promote deathrock and are attended by fans from many countries, and events such as the [[Drop Dead Festival]] in the US attract attendees from over 30 countries. In England, [[Whitby Goth Weekend]] is a music festival held twice a year in [[Whitby|Whitby, North Yorkshire]]. In the US, events such as [[Bats Day in the Fun Park]] celebrate the culture, as well as the Goth Cruise and Gothic Cruise.

===Interior design===
In the 1980s, goths decorated their walls and ceilings with black fabrics and accessories like rosaries, crosses and plastic roses. Black furniture and cemetery-related objects such as candlesticks, death lanterns and skulls were also part of their interior design. In the 1990s, the interior design approach of the 1980s was replaced by a less macabre style.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.figuren-shop.de/|title=Gothic room furnishings}}</ref>

==Sociology==
===Gender and sexuality===
Since the late 1970s, the UK goth scene refused "traditional standards of sexual propriety" and accepted and celebrated "unusual, bizarre or deviant sexual practices".{{sfn|Siegel|2007|p=350}} In the 2000s, many members "... claim overlapping memberships in the [[queer]], [[Polyamory|polyamorous]], [[BDSM|bondage-discipline/sadomasochism]], and [[pagan]] communities".{{sfn|Wilkins|2004}}

Though sexual empowerment is not unique to women in the goth scene, it remains an important part of many goth women's experience: The "... [s]cene's celebration of active sexuality" enables goth women "... to resist mainstream notions of passive femininity". They have an "active sexuality" approach which creates "gender egalitarianism" within the scene, as it "allows them to engage in sexual play with multiple partners while sidestepping most of the stigma and dangers that women who engage in such behavior" outside the scene frequently incur, while continuing to "... see themselves as strong".{{sfn|Wilkins|2004|p=329}}

Men dress up in an androgynous way: "... Men 'gender blend,' wearing makeup and skirts". In contrast, the "... women are dressed in sexy feminine outfits" that are "... highly sexualized" and which often combine "... [[corset]]s with short skirts and [[fishnet stocking]]s". [[Androgyny]] is common among the scene: "... androgyny in Goth subcultural style often disguises or even functions to reinforce conventional gender roles". It was only "valorised" for male goths, who adopt a "feminine" appearance, including "make-up, skirts and feminine accessories" to "enhance masculinity" and facilitate traditional heterosexual courting roles.<ref name="Spooner">{{cite magazine|title=Goth Culture: Gender, Sexuality and Style|date=28 May 2009|first=Catherine|last=Spooner|magazine=[[Times Higher Education]]|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/goth-culture-gender-sexuality-and-style/406767.article/|accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref>

===Identity===
While goth is "considered a music-based scene", the goth subculture is also characterised by particular [[aesthetics]], outlooks, and a "way of seeing and of being seen". Observers have raised the issue of to what degree individuals are truly members of the goth subculture. On one end of the spectrum is the "Uber goth", a person who is described as seeking a pallor so much that he or she applies "... as much white foundation and white powder as possible".{{sfn|Goodlad|Bibby|2007|p=36}} On the other end of the spectrum another writer terms "[[poseur]]s": "goth wannabes, usually young kids going through a goth phase who do not hold to goth sensibilities but want to be part of the goth crowd..".{{sfn|Kilpatrick|2004|p=24}} It has been said that a "mallgoth" is a teen who dresses in a goth style and spends time in malls with a [[Hot Topic]] store, but who does not know much about the goth subculture or its music, thus making him or her a poseur.{{sfn|Ladouceur|2011}} In one case, even a well-known performer has been labelled with the pejorative term: a "number of goths, especially those who belonged to this subculture before the late-1980s, reject [[Marilyn Manson]] as a poseur who undermines the true meaning of goth".{{sfn|Siegel|2007|p=344}}

===Media and academic commentary===
The [[BBC]] described academic research that indicated that goths are "refined and sensitive, keen on poetry and books, not big on drugs or anti-social behaviour".<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news |first=Denise |last=Winterman |title=Upwardly gothic |publisher= BBC News Magazine |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4828230.stm}}</ref> Teens often stay in the subculture "into their adult life", and they are likely to become well-educated and enter professions such as medicine or law.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> The subculture carries on appealing to teenagers who are looking for meaning and for identity. The scene teaches teens that there are difficult aspects to life that you "have to make an attempt to understand" or explain.<ref>{{cite news|title=The devil in your family room|date=16 December 1998|first=Fiona|last=Morgan|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|url=http://www.salon.com/1998/12/15/15hot_2/|accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that a "glue binding the [goth] scene together was [[Recreational drugs|drug use]]"; however, in the scene, drug use was varied. Goth is one of the few subculture movements that is not associated with a single drug,<ref name="Simpson" /> in the way that the [[Hippie]] subculture is associated with [[cannabis]] and the [[Mod subculture]] is associated with [[amphetamines]]. A 2006 study of young goths found that those with higher levels of goth identification had higher drug use.{{sfn|Young|Sweeting|West|2006}}

===Perception on nonviolence===
A study conducted by the [[University of Glasgow]], involving 1,258 youth interviewed at ages 11, 13, 15 and 19, found goth subculture to be strongly nonviolent and tolerant, thus providing "valuable social and emotional support" to teens vulnerable to self harm and mental illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8996-goth-subculture-may-protect-vulnerable-children.html |title=Goth subculture may protect vulnerable children |work=New Scientist |date=14 April 2006 |accessdate=2009-04-25}}</ref>

====School shootings====
In the weeks following the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]], media reports about the teen gunmen, [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], portrayed them as part of a gothic cult. An increased suspicion of goth subculture subsequently manifested in the media.<ref>{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Carey |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/01/us/terror-littleton-shunned-for-those-who-dress-differently-increase-being-viewed.html |title=For Those Who Dress Differently, an Increase in Being Viewed as Abnormal |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1 May 1999 |accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref> This led to a [[moral panic]] over teen involvement in goth subculture and a number of other activities, such as violent video games.<ref name=" www.salon.comt">{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/04/23/gamers/index.html |title=Doom, Quake and mass murder |accessdate=24 August 2008 |author=Janelle Brown |date=23 April 1999 |work=Salon |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919092143/https://www.salon.com/tech/feature/1999/04/23/gamers/index.html |archivedate=19 September 2008}}</ref> Harris and Klebold had initially been thought to be members of "The Trenchcoat Mafia"; an informal club within Columbine High School.

[[Mick Mercer]] stated that Gill was "not a Goth. Never a Goth.

===Prejudice and violence directed at goths===
In part because of public misunderstanding surrounding gothic aesthetics, people in the goth subculture sometimes suffer [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]], and [[Toleration|intolerance]]. As is the case with members of various other subcultures and [[alternative lifestyle]]s, outsiders sometimes marginalize goths, either by intention or by accident.<ref name="NTTimesgoldberg">{{cite news |author=Goldberg, Carey |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/01/us/terror-littleton-shunned-for-those-who-dress-differently-increase-being-viewed.html?src=pm |title=Terror in Littleton: The Shunned; For Those Who Dress Differently, an Increase in Being Viewed as Abnormal |work=The New York Times |date=1 May 1999 |accessdate=2012-03-18}}</ref> Actress [[Christina Hendricks]] talked of being bullied as a goth at school and how difficult it was for her to deal with societal pressure: "Kids can be pretty judgmental about people who are different. But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy. My mother was mortified and kept telling me how horrible and ugly I looked. Strangers would walk by with a look of shock on their face, so I never felt pretty. I just always felt awkward".<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9088143/Christina-Hendricks-I-was-bullied-at-school-for-being-a-goth.html</ref>

On 11 August 2007, a couple walking through Stubbylee Park in Bacup (Lancashire) were attacked by a group of teenagers because they were goths. [[Murder of Sophie Lancaster|Sophie Lancaster]] subsequently died from her injuries.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lancashire/6943848.stm |title=Goth couple badly hurt in attack |work=BBC News-UK |date=11 August 2007 |accessdate=2012-03-18}}</ref> On 29 April 2008, two teens, Ryan Herbert and Brendan Harris, were convicted for the murder of Lancaster and given life sentences; three others were given lesser sentences for the assault on her boyfriend Robert Maltby. In delivering the sentence, Judge Anthony Russell stated, "This was a hate crime against these completely harmless people targeted because their appearance was different to yours". He went on to defend the goth community, calling goths "perfectly peaceful, law-abiding people who pose no threat to anybody".<ref>{{cite web |author=Byrne, Paul |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/2008/04/29/life-jail-trms-for-teenage-thugs-who-killed-goth-girl-86908-20398652/ |title=Life jail trms for teenage thugs who killed goth girl |work=dailyrecord.co.uk |date=29 April 2008 |accessdate=2012-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/two-teenagers-sentenced-to-life-over-murder-of-goth-817218.html |work=Independent.co.uk |title=Two teenagers sentenced to life over murder of Goth |author=Pilling, Kim |date=29 April 2008 |accessdate=2012-03-18}}</ref> Judge Russell added that he "recognised it as a hate crime without Parliament having to tell him to do so and had included that view in his sentencing".<ref>{{cite web |author=Henfield, Sally |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/display.var.2233349.0.sophies_family_and_friends_vow_to_carry_on_campaign.php |title=Sophie's family and friends vow to carry on campaign |work=lancashiretelegraph.co.uk |date=29 April 2008 |accessdate=2012-03-18}}</ref> Despite this ruling, a bill to add discrimination based on subculture affiliation to the definition of hate crime in British law was not presented to parliament.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1043926_call_for_hate_crimes_law_change |title=Call for hate crimes law change |author=Smyth, Catherine |work=manchestereveningnews.co.uk |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=2012-03-18}}</ref>

In 2013, police in Manchester announced they would be treating attacks on members of alternative subcultures, such as goths, the same as they do for attacks based on race, religion, and sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Manchester-goths-get-police-protection/tabid/417/articleID/293078/Default.aspx | archive-url= https://archive.today/20150315190920/http://www.3news.co.nz/Manchester-goths-get-police-protection/tabid/417/articleID/293078/Default.aspx | url-status= dead | archive-date= 15 March 2015 | work= 3 News NZ | title= Manchester goths get police protection | date= 5 April 2013 }}</ref>

===Self-harm study===
A study published on the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' concluded that "identification as belonging to the Goth subculture [at some point in their lives] was the best predictor of [[self-harm|self harm]] and attempted suicide [among young teens]", and that it was most possibly due to a selection mechanism (persons that wanted to harm themselves later identified as goths, thus raising the percentage of those persons who identify as goths).{{sfn|Young|Sweeting|West|2006}}

According to ''The Guardian'', some goth teens are more likely to harm themselves or attempt suicide. A medical journal study of 1,300 Scottish schoolchildren until their teen years found that the 53% of the goth teens had attempted to harm themselves and 47% had attempted suicide. The study found that the "correlation was stronger than any other predictor".<ref>Polly Curtis and John Carvel. "Teen goths more prone to suicide, study shows". ''The Guardian'', Friday 14 April 2006</ref> The study was based on a sample of 15 teenagers who identified as goths, of which 8 had self-harmed by any method, 7 had self-harmed by cutting, scratching or scoring, and 7 had attempted suicide.<ref name="bbc harm">{{cite news | work = [[BBC]] | title = Goths 'more likely to self-harm' | date = 13 April 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4905898.stm |accessdate=2012-03-18}}</ref>

The authors held that most self-harm by teens was done before joining the subculture, and that joining the subculture would actually protect them and help them deal with distress in their lives.<ref name="bbc harm" /><ref name="vince">{{cite news | work = [[New Scientist]] | title = Goth subculture may protect vulnerable children | date = 14 April 2006 | author = Gaia Vince | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8996-goth-subculture-may-protect-vulnerable-children.html |accessdate=2012-03-18}}</ref> The researchers cautioned that the study was based on a small sample size and needed replication to confirm the results.<ref name="bbc harm" /><ref name="vince" /> The study was criticized for using only a small sample of goth teens and not taking into account other influences and differences between types of goths.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Taubert |first1=Mark |last2=Kandasamy |first2=Jothy |year=2006 |title=Self Harm in Goth Youth Subculture: Conclusion Relates Only to Small Sample |journal=BMJ |type=letter to the editor |volume=332 |issue=7551 |page=1216 |doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7551.1216 |pmc=1463972 |pmid=16710018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Phillipov |first=Michelle |year=2006 |title=Self Harm in Goth Youth Subculture: Study Merely Reinforces Popular Stereotypes |journal=BMJ |type=letter to the editor |volume=332 |issue=7551 |pages=1215–1216 |doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7551.1215-b |pmid=16710012 |pmc=1463947}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Robert |last2=Sweeting |first2=Helen |last3=West |first3=Patrick |year=2006 |title=Self Harm in Goth Youth Subculture: Authors' Reply |journal=BMJ |type=letter to the editor |volume=332 |issue=7553 |page = 1335 |doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7553.1335-a |pmid=16740576 |pmc=1473089}}</ref>
