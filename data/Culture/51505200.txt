==Founding==

===Hashtag===

In 2013, Thompson coined the phrase via the [[hashtag]] #BlackGirlsAreMagic— now shortened to #BlackGirlMagic—to create an online dialogue centered on the achievements of Black women, in a society that has historically recognized very few of these achievements.<ref name=":0"/> Thompson saw the publication of a [[Psychology Today]] blog post titled "Why Are Black Women Rated Less Physically Attractive Than Other Women, But Black Men Are Rated Better Looking Than Other Men,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2011/05/17/136399684/bloggers-ugly-conclusions-anger-some-in-the-black-community|title=Bloggers' Post On Black Women Spurs Anger|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> as well as other negative articles about Black women. The article was retracted, but the negative message is pervasive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/201105/black-women-are-not-rated-less-attractive-our-independent-analysis-the|title=Black Women Are Not (Rated) Less Attractive! Our Independent Analysis of the Add Health Dataset|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> She created the original hashtag to share affirmations for Black women and girls in order to change the prominent narrative.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blavity.com/as-blackgirlmagic-turns-four-years-old-cashawn-thompson-has-a-fresh-word-for-all-the-magical-black-girls|title=As #BlackGirlMagic Turns Four Years Old, CaShawn Thompson Has A Fresh Word For All The Magical Black Girls - Blavity|website=blavity.com|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> Now colloquially used on popular social media sites, the hashtag can be seen being used widely on sites such as [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and other mainstream media platforms, with a symbol of celebrating positive messages and images of Black women all across the globe.

On June 26, 2016 actor [[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]] mentioned the movement in his speech at the [[BET Awards 2016]]. Williams showed his appreciation for Black women by emphasizing the importance of acknowledging their accomplishments. Williams ended his speech by stating the following "just because we're magic, does not mean we're not real." Williams' objective was to make the audience as well as viewers understand that Black Girl Magic is not just a [[hashtag]] but it is a slogan that is connected to deeply rooted pain and unspoken historical events of oppression, discrimination and dehumanization. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jesse-williams-bet-awards-humanitarian-award_n_57708cebe4b017b379f65077|title=Jesse Williams: 'Just Because We're Magic, Does Not Mean We're Not Real'|last=Workneh|first=Lilly|date=2016-06-26|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref>

=== Clothing campaign ===

In January 2014, Thompson began selling T-shirts sporting the "Black Girls Are Magic" logo that she created with her friend.<ref name=":0"/> At the time, Thompson only meant to sell these shirts to her friends and family, but has since sold over 3,000 T-shirts through her Teespring account.<ref>{{cite news|last1= D'Oyley|first1=Demetria Lucas|title= Elle, You Just Don't Understand #BlackGirlMagic.|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2016/01/elle_you_just_don_t_understand_blackgirlmagic/|access-date=30 November 2016|work=TheWrap|date=14 January 2016}}</ref> While the popularity of the shirts started among active social media users, Thompson was quickly surprised to see that people were also buying them as gifts for granddaughters, daughters, and nieces, as they felt that the message was encouraging for young girls too.

The shirts have also gained some celebrity recognition, with prominent young Black women such as [[Willow Smith]], [[Amandla Stenberg]] [[Ryan Destiny]], [[Yara Shahidi]], [[Zendaya]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], [[Laura Harrier]] and many other incredible Black women and girls posting pictures of themselves on various social media platforms wearing their Black Girls Are Magic gear.<ref name=":0"/>

===Philosophy===

"I say 'magic' because it's something that people don't always understand," Thompson told [[Los Angeles Times|''The Los Angeles Times'']].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-everyones-saying-black-girls-are-magic-20150909-htmlstory.html|title=Why everyone's saying 'Black Girls are Magic'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-12-08}}</ref> She went on to explain how "Sometimes our accomplishments might seem to come out of thin air, because a lot of times, the only people supporting us are other Black women." At its core, the purpose of this movement is to create a platform where women of color can stand together against the [[stereotyping]], [[colourism]], [[misogynoir]] and [[racism]] that is often their lived experience.<ref name=":0" />

Clarissa Joan of [[MadameNoire|Madame Noir]] wrote a series of articles called "Black Girl Magic Defined" that addresses the day to day experience of living black girl magic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://madamenoire.com/597506/black-girl-magic-defined-pt-1-why-were-so-fly/|title=Black Girl Magic Defined (Pt.1): Do You Put Race Before Womanhood?|last=Joan|first=Clarissa|date=2015-11-09|website=MadameNoire|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> Black women face challenges specific to their race and gender, and Joan's articles explore these ideas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://madamenoire.com/599631/black-girl-magic-defined-pt-2-the-strength-to-make-something-out-of-nothing/|title=Black Girl Magic Defined (Pt. 2): The Strength to Make Something Out of Nothing|last=Joan|first=Clarissa|date=2015-11-19|website=MadameNoire|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://madamenoire.com/605553/black-girl-magic-defined-pt-3-surviving-vs-thriving-and-the-happy-black-woman/|title=Black Girl Magic Defined (Pt.3): Surviving Vs.

On October 30, 2016 musician [[Solange Knowles]] and public scholar [[Melissa Harris-Perry]] took the stage at [[Cemex|CEMEX]] Auditorium for an intimate conversation about the Black Girl Magic, in the discussion Solange and Harris-Perry touched on the merits of [[Formal education of girls|formal education]], issues of geopolitical racism, family dynamics and more, all in the context of race and what it means to be an [[African-American women|African American woman]]. Solange, who pushes the agenda of Black excellence and has been very vocal about the issues of [[intersectionality]] in America, shared her thoughts on Black Girl Magic with Harris-Perry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stanforddaily.com/2016/10/30/solange-knowles-and-melissa-harris-perry-explore-blackgirlmagic/|title=Solange Knowles and Melissa Harris-Perry explore #BlackGirlMagic|last=Wang|first=Claire|date=2016-10-31|website=The Stanford Daily|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref>

In a separate interview, Harris-Perry described the celebration of Black Girl Magic: "What I like about Black Girl Magic is that it designates those moments when black girlhood or black womanhood isn’t being used for surplus labor value for some other system, but just for your damn self."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/melissa-harris-perry-black-girl-magic.html|title=TV Host Melissa Harris-Perry on Black Girl Magic|website=The Cut|language=en|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref>

==Controversy==

Some have criticised the movement as being racist, claiming that its reverse, "white Girl Magic" would be interpreted as racist, so it too should be classified as such.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35263240|title=Why are people arguing about 'Black Girl Magic'?|date=2016-01-16|access-date=2019-04-18|language=en-GB}}</ref>

While many Black women support the concept of Black Girl Magic, some{{who|date=November 2017}} feel it reinforces the "strong Black woman" [[archetype]] that Black women often confront.
