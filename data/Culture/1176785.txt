The organization teaches about the [[hidden people]] and the 13 different kinds of [[elves]] that the organization believes inhabit the country of Iceland.<ref>{{cite news | title=VIDEO: Belief in Elves Strong in Iceland | date=2008-12-11 | url =http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/12/081211-elves-video-ap.html | work =National Geographic News | access-date = 2009-05-30 }}</ref> According to the organization's headmaster, hidden people "are just the same size and look exactly like human beings, the only difference is that they are invisible to most of us. Elves, on the other hand, aren’t entirely human, they’re humanoid, starting at around eight centimetres".<ref>{{cite news | first=Marc | last=Vincenz | title=To Be or Not to Be; Álfar, Elves, Huldufólk, Fairies and Dwarves: Are They Really All the Same Thing? | date=2009-05-27 | url=http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/Article-To-Be-or-Not-to-Be | work=The Reykjavík Grapevine | access-date=2009-06-14 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404114957/http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/Article-To-Be-or-Not-to-Be | archive-date=2010-04-04 }}</ref>

The organization is headed by Magnús Skarphéðinsson. Magnús has a full curriculum, and certificate programs for visitors that can be earned in as little as half a day. However, the organization also publishes texts on hidden people, partly for its own use in the classroom.<ref>{{cite news | first=Douglas | last=McArthur | title=Elfschool tries to make a believer out of everyone | date=1996-03-13 | work =The Globe and Mail (Canada) }}</ref> Magnús organizes five hour long educational excursions for visitors, and finishes the tour with coffee and pancakes.<ref>{{cite news | title=Ferðast um huliðsheima | date=1997-06-15 | url =http://www.ismennt.is/vefir/ari/alfar/afraedi/alfaskoli1.htm | work =Morgunblaðið | access-date = 2009-05-30 | language = is }}</ref> Since opening in 1991, over 9,000 people, most of them foreigners, have attended the organization.<ref>{{cite news | first=Carl | last=Honoré | title=The Hidden Beings Of Iceland | date=2005-07-01 | url=http://www.americanwaymag.com/icelandic-elf-school-reykjavik-soccer-little-house-on-the-prairie | work=American Way | access-date=2009-06-14 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220181307/http://www.americanwaymag.com/icelandic-elf-school-reykjavik-soccer-little-house-on-the-prairie | archive-date=2009-02-20 }}</ref> The Álfaskólinn also provides "[[aura reading]]s" and "[[Past life regression|past-life explorations]]".<ref>{{cite book | last = Rakoff | first = David | title = Fraud: Essays | publisher = Broadway Books | year = 2002 | location = New York, NY | pages = 85 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gjnfDpm6ubIC&lpg=PP1&dq=fraud&pg=PT98#v=onepage&q=elf%20school&f=false | isbn = 978-0-7679-0631-9 }}</ref>
