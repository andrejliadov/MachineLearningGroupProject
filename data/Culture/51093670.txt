[[Plants]] provide the greater part of the [[food]] for people and their [[domestic animal]]s: much of human [[culture]] and [[civilisation]] came into being through [[agriculture]]. While many plants have been used for food, a small number of [[staple crop]]s including [[wheat]], [[rice]], and [[maize]] provide most of the food in the world today. In turn, [[animals]] provide much of the [[meat]] eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided a large part of the power used for work and transport. A variety of living things serve as [[model organism|models]] in [[biological research]], such as in [[genetics]], and in [[drug testing]]. Until the 19th century, [[medicinal plant|plants yielded]] most of the [[medicinal drugs]] in common use, as described in the 1st century by [[Dioscorides]]. Plants are the source of many [[psychoactive drug]]s, some such as [[coca]] known to have been used for thousands of years. [[Yeast]], a fungus, has been used to [[fermentation|ferment]] [[cereal]]s such as wheat and barley to make [[bread]] and [[beer]]; other fungi such as ''[[Psilocybe]]'' and [[fly agaric]] mushrooms have been gathered as psychoactive drugs.

Many species of animal are kept as [[pet]]s, the most popular being [[mammals]], especially [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s. Plants are grown for pleasure in gardens and greenhouses, yielding flowers, shade, and decorative foliage; some, such as [[cactus]]es, able to tolerate dry conditions, are grown as [[houseplant]]s.

Animals such as [[horse]]s and [[deer]] are among the earliest subjects of [[art]], being found in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s such as at [[Lascaux]].

Living things further play a wide variety of symbolic roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Sometimes a major [[disease]] like [[tuberculosis]], caused by a [[bacterium]], [[Tuberculosis in human culture|plays a role in culture]], in its case being associated for some reason with artistic creativity.

==Context==

===Culture===

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].<ref name=MacionisGerber2011>{{cite book |title=Sociology |last1=Macionis |first1=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |oclc = 652430995}}</ref><ref name="Churchman1987">{{cite book |last1=Churchman |first1=David |title=The Educational Role of Zoos: A Synthesis of the Literature (1928-1987) with Annotated Bibliography |date=1987 |publisher=California State University |page=8 |ref=ED289742 |quote=addressing the broad question of the relationship between animals and human culture.

===Three types of use===

Scholars of human culture have traditionally divided uses of living things into two categories: practical use for food<ref name="Mintz Du Bois 2002">{{cite journal |last1=Mintz |first1=Sidney W. |last2=Du Bois |first2=Christine M. |title=The Anthropology of Food and Eating |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2002 |pages=99–119 |issn=0084-6570 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.32.032702.131011}}</ref> and other resources; and symbolic use such as in art<ref name="Levine 1957">{{cite journal |last=Levine |first=Morton H. |title=Prehistoric Art and Ideology |journal=American Anthropologist |date=December 1957 |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=949–964 |doi=10.1525/aa.1957.59.6.02a00030 |jstor=666458}}</ref> and religion.<ref name="Insoll 2011"/> More recently, scholars have added a third type of interaction, where living things, whether animals, plants, fungi or microbes function as participants. This makes the relationships bidirectional, explicitly implying various forms of [[symbiosis]] in a complex [[ecology]].<ref name="White Candea Lazar Robbins 2018"/><ref name="Kirksey Helmreich 2010"/><ref name="Ogden Hall Tanita 2013"/><ref name="Birch2018"/> These three types are described in turn.

[[Working animal|Working domestic animals]] including cattle, horses, yaks, camels, and elephants have been used for work and transport from the origins of agriculture, their numbers declining with the arrival of mechanised transport and agricultural machinery. In 2004 they still provided some 80% of the power for the mainly small farms in the third world, and some 20% of the world's transport, again mainly in rural areas.

[[Vaccine]]s have been made using animals since their discovery by [[Edward Jenner]] in the 18th century. He noted that inoculation with live [[cowpox]] afforded protection against the more dangerous [[smallpox]]. In the 19th century, [[Louis Pasteur]] developed an attenuated (weakened) vaccine for [[rabies]]. In the 20th century, vaccines for the viral diseases [[mumps]] and [[polio]] were developed using animal cells grown [[in vitro]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Vaccines and animal cell technology |url=http://www.actip.org/library/vaccines-and-animal-cell-technology/ |publisher=Animal Cell Technology Industrial Platform |accessdate=9 July 2016}}</ref>

An increasing variety of [[medicinal drug]]s are based on [[toxin]]s and other molecules of animal origin. The cancer drug [[Yondelis]] was isolated from the [[tunicate]] ''[[Ecteinascidia turbinata]]''. One of dozens of toxins made by the deadly cone snail ''[[Conus geographus]]'' is used as [[Prialt]] in pain relief.<ref>{{cite web |title=Medicines by Design |url=https://publications.nigms.nih.gov/medbydesign/chapter3.html |publisher=National Institute of Health |accessdate=9 July 2016}}</ref>

Since [[classical antiquity|classical times]] and possibly much earlier, hundreds of species of plants have provided drugs to treat a wide range of conditions. [[Dioscorides]]'s ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', written by 70 AD, listed some 600 [[medicinal plant]]s and around 1000 drugs made from them, including substances known to be effective such as [[aconitum|aconite]], [[aloes]], [[colocynth]], [[colchicum]], [[henbane]], [[opium]] and [[squill]].

Thousands of plant species are cultivated for aesthetic purposes as well as to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion.

[[Arboretum]]s and [[botanical garden]]s are public collections of living plants.

Gardens may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with [[topiary]] or [[espalier]]. [[Gardening]] is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or [[horticulture therapy]] is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as [[houseplant]]s, or in specialized buildings such as [[greenhouse]]s that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. [[Venus Flytrap]], [[sensitive plant]] and [[resurrection plant]] are examples of plants sold as novelties.

===In art===
{{further|Animal painting}}

Both animals and plants are significant in art, whether as background or as main subjects.

Animals, often mammals but including fish and insects among other groups, have been the [[Animal painting|subjects of art]] from the earliest times, in both early history as in [[Ancient Egypt]], and prehistory, as in the [[Lascaux|cave paintings at Lascaux]] and other sites in the [[Dordogne]], France and elsewhere. Major artistic depictions of animals include [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s 1515 ''[[Dürer's Rhinoceros|The Rhinoceros]]'', and [[George Stubbs]]'s c. 1762 horse portrait ''[[Whistlejacket]]''.<ref name="Jones">{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Jonathan |title=The top 10 animal portraits in art |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/jun/27/top-10-animal-portraits-in-art |accessdate=24 June 2016 |agency=[[The Guardian]] |date=27 June 2014}}</ref>

Plants appear in art, either to illustrate their botanical appearance,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Antheunisse |first1=Max |title=About |url=http://www.plantillustrations.org/about.php |publisher=Plant Illustrations |accessdate=20 June 2016 |date=2009}}</ref> or for the purposes of the artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism. For example, the [[Virgin Mary]] was compared by the [[Venerable Bede]] to a [[lily]], the white [[petal]]s denoting purity of body, while the yellow [[anther]]s signified the radiant light of the soul; accordingly, European portraits of the Virgin's [[Annunciation]] may depict a vase of white lilies in her room to indicate her attributes. Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in portraits, and as main subjects in [[still life]]s.<ref>{{cite web |author=Meagher, Jennifer |title=Botanical Imagery in European Painting |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bota/hd_bota.htm |date=August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Raymond |first1=Francine |title=Why botanical art is still blooming today |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/plants/9924556/Why-botanical-art-is-still-blooming-today.html |accessdate=19 June 2016 |agency=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 March 2013}}</ref>

==As participants==

Social sciences including [[anthropology]], [[ethnography]], and [[archaeology]] have long investigated human interactions with living things. Anthropology and ethnography have traditionally studied the roles of living things in human culture in two opposed ways: as physical resources that humans used;<ref name="Mintz Du Bois 2002"/> and as symbols or concepts through [[totemism]] and [[animism]].<ref name="Insoll 2011">{{cite book |last=Insoll |first=Timothy |title=The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of Ritual and Religion |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0191743450 |oclc=986504637 |pages=1004–1016 |url=https://www.academia.edu/download/37847645/OUP_-_Animism.pdf}}</ref> More recently, these scientists have also seen living things as participants in human social interactions,<ref name="White Candea Lazar Robbins 2018">{{cite journal |last=White |first=Thomas |last2=Candea |first2=Matei |last3=Lazar |first3=Sian |last4=Robbins |first4=Joel |last5=Sanchez |first5=Andrew |last6=Stasch |first6=Rupert |editor-last=Stein |editor-first=Felix |editor-last2=Candea |editor-first2=Matei |editor-last3=Diemberger |editor-first3=Hildegard |title=Animals |journal=Cambridge Encyclopedia of Anthropology |date=2018-05-23 |doi=10.29164/18animals |doi-access=free }</ref> in what has been called "multispecies ethnography".<ref name="Kirksey Helmreich 2010">{{cite journal |last1=Kirksey |first1=S.

{{quote|Creatures previously appearing on the margins of anthropology—as part of the landscape, as food for humans, as symbols—have been pressed into the foreground in recent ethnographies. Animals, plants, fungi, and microbes once confined in anthropological accounts to the realm of zoe or 'bare life'—that which is killable—have started to appear alongside humans in the realm of bios, with legibly biographical and political lives.<ref name="Kirksey Helmreich 2010"/>}}

Archaeology, too, has traditionally centred ecological interactions on the human side, rather than, in Suzanne E. Pilaar Birch's words,<ref name="Birch2018">{{cite book |last=Birch |first=Suzanne E. Pilaar |title=Multispecies Archaeology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPZKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT15 |year=2018 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-1-317-48064-8 |pages=1–7 (Introduction)}}</ref> 

{{quote|emphasizing the uniqueness of our species rather than viewing [ecological] novelty as a collective shift shared amongst multiple species and their habitats.<ref name="Birch2018"/>}} 

Birch includes animals, plants, fungi, and microbes among critical interactions with humans:<ref name="Birch2018"/> 

{{quote|plants too are incredibly important determinants: for mobile hunter-gatherers, they might dictate a seasonal move; for sedentary agriculturalists, the reliability of your crop yields means the difference between survival and extinction.<ref name="Birch2018"/>}} 

{{quote|Fungi and microbes may also be given short shrift in archaeology because they are more difficult to study ... perhaps only ... their physical traces ... Yet they are huge determining factors that cannot be overlooked. So too we might include proteins and DNA in our summary of hwat might be defined as multispecies archaeology.<ref name="Birch2018"/>}} 

Whereas historically, Birch states, humans saw themselves as exceptional, such as in the medieval [[great chain of being]], an integrated multispecies approach would assemble expertise "in diverse areas, including archaeology, human-animal studies, biology, ecology, evolutionary theory, and philosophy".<ref name="Birch2018"/>
