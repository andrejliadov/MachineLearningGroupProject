The [[Convergence (telecommunications)|emerging telecommunications]] have developed a new form of communication, much faster and more direct. This allows people to work from anywhere in the world. People can easily group or perform any type of organization.
Art Cluster also refers artistic production of [[collective intelligence]]. The integration of social movement in the cyberspace is one of the potential strategies of this social movement.

==Precedents and precursors==
In Manhattan in 2003 Bill Wasik, senior editor of Harper's Magazine, creates the first [[Flash mob]]. A flash mob is a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, perform an unusual and seemingly pointless act for a brief time, then quickly disperse, often for the purposes of entertainment, satire, and artistic expression. Flash mobs began as a form of performance art.<ref>Goldstein, Lauren (August 10, 2003 (April 18, 2003 issue)). "The Mob Rules". Time Europe 162 (7). {{ISSN|0040-781X}}. {{OCLC|1767509}}. Retrieved March 14, 2007..</ref> While they started as an apolitical act, flash mobs may share superficial similarities to political demonstrations. Flash mobs can be seen as a specialized form of smart mob, a term and concept proposed by author Howard Rheingold in his 2002 book Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution.<ref>Wasik, Bill (March 2006). "My Crowd, or, Phase 5: A report from the inventor of the flash mob" (Subscription). Harper's Magazine: 56–66. {{ISSN|0017-789X}}. {{OCLC|4532730}}. Retrieved February 2, 2007.</ref>

The convergence culture is an important factor in Art Cluster. [[Henry Jenkins]] determines convergence culture to be the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want.<ref>Jenkins, H. Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide. New York: New York UP, 2006. Print</ref>

Art Cluster actions were captured in the form of itinerant exhibitions and printed editions of fanzines in 2005.This collective actions was promoted by [[Jofre Oliveras]], artist and cultural manager who created the movement in Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.girona.cat/museuhistoria/esp/agenda_exposicions.php?idReg=66|title=First Art Cluster Exhibition|last=|first=|date=2005|website=Girona History Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

==Use of the term==
The first documented use of the term ''Art Cluster'' as it is understood today was in 2011 in a blog entry posted in the aftermath of cultural platform event from [[Girona]].<ref>[http://artcluster.info Art cluster]</ref>
The term was inspired by the [[Cluster (computing)|computing cluster]] that consists of a set of loosely connected computers that work together so that in many respects they can be viewed as a single system.
