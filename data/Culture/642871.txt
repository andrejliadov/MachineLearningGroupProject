{{short description|Recurring assemblage of artifacts from a specific time and place that may constitute the material culture remains of a particular past human society}}
An '''archaeological culture''' is a recurring [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblage]] of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] from a specific time and place that may constitute the [[material culture]] remains of a particular past human [[society]]. The connection between the artifacts is based on archaeologists' understanding and interpretation and does not necessarily relate to real groups of humans in the past. The concept of archaeological culture is fundamental to [[culture-historical archaeology]].

==Concept==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}

Different cultural groups have [[material culture]] items that differ both functionally and aesthetically due to varying cultural and social practices. This notion is observably true on the broadest scales. For example, the equipment associated with the brewing of [[tea]] varies greatly across the world. Social relations to material culture often include notions of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[social status|status]].

Advocates of culture-historical archaeology use the notion to argue that sets of material culture can be used to trace ancient groups of people that were either self-identifying [[society|societies]] or [[ethnic group]]s. The classic definition of this idea comes from [[Gordon Childe]]:
{{quote|We find certain types of remains&nbsp;– pots, implements, ornaments, burial rites and house forms&nbsp;– constantly recurring together. Such a complex of associated traits we shall call a "cultural group" or just a "culture". We assume that such a complex is the material expression of what today we would call "a people".|{{Harvnb|Childe|1929|pp=v–vi}}}} 

The concept of an archaeological culture was crucial to linking the [[typology (archaeology)|typological]] analysis of archaeological evidence to mechanisms that attempted to explain why they change through time. The key explanations favoured by culture-historians were the [[diffusionism|diffusion]] of forms from one group to another or the [[migrationism|migration]] of the peoples themselves. A simplistic example of the process might be that if one pottery-type had handles very similar to those of a neighbouring type but decoration similar to a different neighbour, the idea for the two features might have diffused from the neighbours. Conversely, if one pottery-type suddenly replaces a great diversity of pottery types in an entire region, that might be interpreted as a new group migrating in with this new style.

Archaeological cultures were generally equated with separate 'peoples' ([[ethnic group]]s or [[race (human classification)|race]]s) leading in some cases to distinct [[nationalist]] archaeologies.

Most archaeological cultures are named after either the type artifact or type site that defines the culture. For example, cultures may be named after pottery types such as [[Linear Pottery Culture]] or [[Funnel beaker culture]]. More frequently, they are named after the site at which the culture was first defined  such as the [[Halstatt culture]] or [[Clovis culture]].

Since the term "culture" has many different meanings, scholars have also coined a more specific term  paleoculture, as a specific designation for prehistoric cultures.{{sfn|Polomé|1982|pp=287}} Critics argue that cultural taxonomies lack a strong consensus on the epistemological aims of cultural taxonomy,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reynolds |first1=Natasha |last2=Riede |first2=Felix |title=House of cards: cultural taxonomy and the study of the European Upper Palaeolithic |journal=Antiquity |date=15 October 2019 |volume=93 |issue=371 |pages=1350–1358 |doi=10.15184/aqy.2019.49|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marwick |first1=Ben |title=Galisonian logic devices and data availability: revitalising Upper Palaeolithic cultural taxonomies |journal=Antiquity |date=15 October 2019 |volume=93 |issue=371 |pages=1365–1367 |doi=10.15184/aqy.2019.131|url=http://osf.io/v8dej/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shea |first1=John J. |title=European Upper Palaeolithic cultural taxa: better off without them? |journal=Antiquity |date=15 October 2019 |volume=93 |issue=371 |pages=1359–1361 |doi=10.15184/aqy.2019.117}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scerri |first1=Eleanor M.L. |title=Cultural taxonomy for the European Upper Palaeolithic: a wide-ranging problem |journal=Antiquity |date=15 October 2019 |volume=93 |issue=371 |pages=1362–1364 |doi=10.15184/aqy.2019.135}}</ref>

==Development==
The use of the term "[[culture]]" entered archaeology through 19th-century German [[ethnography]], where the ''Kultur'' of tribal groups and rural peasants was distinguished from the ''Zivilisation'' of [[urbanization|urbanised]] peoples. In contrast to the broader use of the word that was introduced to English-language [[anthropology]] by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], ''Kultur'' was used by German ethnologists to describe the distinctive ways of life of a particular people or ''Volk'', in this sense equivalent to the French ''civilisation''. Works of ''Kulturgeschichte'' (culture history) were produced by a number of German scholars, particularly [[Gustav Klemm]], from 1780 onwards, reflecting a growing interest in [[ethnicity]] in 19th-century Europe.<ref name="Trigger 2006 The Concept of Culture">{{Harvnb|Trigger|2006|pp=232–235}}.</ref>

The first use of "culture" in an archaeological context was in [[Christian Jürgensen Thomsen|Christian Thomsen]]'s 1836 work ''Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed'' ({{lang-no|Guide to Northern Antiquity}}). In the later half of the 19th century archaeologists in Scandinavia and central Europe increasingly made use of the German concept of culture to describe the different groups they distinguished in the archaeological record of particular sites and regions, often alongside and as a synonym of "civilisation".<ref name="Trigger 2006 The Concept of Culture" /> It was not until the 20th century and the works of German prehistorian and fervent nationalist [[Gustaf Kossinna]] that the idea of archaeological cultures became central to the discipline. Kossinna saw the archaeological record as a mosaic of clearly defined cultures (or ''Kultur-Gruppen'', culture groups) that were strongly associated with [[Race (classification of humans)|race]]. He was particularly interested in reconstructing the movements of what he saw as the direct prehistoric ancestors of Germans, Slavs, Celts and other major [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] ethnic groups in order to trace the [[Aryan race]] to its homeland or ''[[urheimat]]''.<ref name="Trigger 2006 The Birth of Culture-Historical Archaeology">{{Harvnb|Trigger|2006|pp=235–241}}.</ref>

The strongly racist character of Kossinna's work meant it had little direct influence outside of Germany at the time (the [[Nazi Party]] enthusiastically embraced his theories), or at all after [[World War II]]. However, the more general "[[culture-historical archaeology|culture history]]" approach to archaeology that he began did replace [[social evolutionism]] as the dominant paradigm for much of the 20th century. Kossinna's basic concept of the archaeological culture, stripped of its racial aspects, was adopted by [[Vere Gordon Childe]] and [[Franz Boas]], at the time the most influential archaeologists in Britain and America respectively. Childe, in particular, was responsible for formulating the definition of archaeological culture that is still largely applies today:<ref name="Trigger 2006 Childe and The Dawn of European Civilization">{{Harvnb|Trigger|2006|pp=241–248}}.</ref>

Though he was sceptical about identifying particular ethnicities in the archaeological record and inclined much more to [[diffusionism]] than [[migrationism]] to explain culture change, Childe and later culture-historical archaeologists, like Kossinna, still equated separate archaeological cultures with separate "peoples".<ref name="Trigger 2006 Childe and The Dawn of European Civilization" /> Later archaeologists{{Who|date=September 2010}} have questioned the straightforward relationship between material culture and human societies. The definition of archaeological cultures and their relationship to past people has become less clear; in some cases, what was believed to be a monolithic culture is shown by further study to be discrete societies. For example, the [[Windmill Hill culture]] now serves as a general label for several different groups that occupied southern [[Great Britain]] during the [[Neolithic]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Conversely, some archaeologists have argued that some supposedly distinctive cultures are manifestations of a wider culture, but they show local differences based on environmental factors such as those related to [[Clactonian]] man.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Conversely, archaeologists may make a distinction between material cultures that actually belonged to a single cultural group. It has been highlighted,{{who|date=October 2010}} for example, that village-dwelling and nomadic [[Bedouin]] Arabs have radically different material cultures even if in other respects, they are very similar. In the past, such synchronous findings were often interpreted as representing intrusion by other groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}
