===History of the Arabs===
Arriving in the early 1870s, the first Middle Eastern settlers in the Detroit area were Lebanese people. Most of them were Christians, including Maronites, Melkites, and Eastern Orthodox. Some immigrants were Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims. Some [[Druze]] also immigrated.<ref name=ACMEp1/> A February 6, 1900 article in the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' stated that "Detroit's Colony of Syrians" included 75-100 people, mostly Lebanese Maronites.<ref name=ShryockAbrahamMarginsp1819>Shryock and Abraham, "On Margins and Mainstreams," p.

[[Henry Ford]]'s factories had 555 Syrian employees, including many recently-arrived Muslims, by 1916. 9,000 Arabic-speakers were among the residents of Detroit in 1930. Of them, 6,000 were Syrians. The remainder included Assyrians, Yemenis, and Palestinians.<ref name=ShryockAbrahamMarginsp19/> Immigrants from the Levant were originally labeled as being from the [[Ottoman Province of Syria]]. After 1920 the [[Ottoman Empire]] collapsed and European colonial administrators divided the areas in the Levant into [[Lebanon]], Palestine, and [[Syria]]. Therefore immigrants into the Detroit began to be classified as Lebanese, Palestinians, and Syrians.<ref name=ACMEp2/>

Immigration from Iraq started in the beginning of the 20th century, and immigration from Yemen and the Arabian peninsula began in the early 20th century. A peak immigration of Iraqis occurred from 1927 to 1950, and a peak immigration of Yemenis and those from the Peninsula occurred from 1912 to 1925.

===Demographics of Arabs===
Since their immigration to the United States in the 1870s, the Arab population has been continuously increasing. This increase can be observed in data collected by The American Community Survey and U.S Census Bureau. To determine this amount, surveys are sent out asking each individual to identify his or her "ancestry or ethnic origin." This phrase is defined by the U.S Census Bureau as ethnic origin, descent, roots, heritage or place of person's or ancestor's birth.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Asi|first1=Maryam|title=Arab Households in the United States: 2006–2010|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acsbr10-20.pdf|website=census.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce Economics and Statistics Administration|accessdate=February 6, 2015|date=May 2013}}</ref>  The U.S Census Bureau considers individuals who reported being one of the following ethnic origins as an Arab: Algerian, Bahraini, Egyptian, Emirati, Iraqi, Jordanian, Kuwaiti, Lebanese, Libyan, Moroccan, Omani, Palestinian, Qatari, Saudi Arabian, Syrian, Tunisian, and Yemeni.<ref name="census2006">{{cite web|last1=Asi|first1=Maryam|title=Arab Households in the United States: 2006–2010|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acsbr10-20.pdf|website=census.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce Economics and Statistics Administration|accessdate=February 6, 2015}}</ref>

With the aforementioned criteria, it was estimated that 850,000 people with Arab ancestry (0.35 percent of the total population) lived in the United States in 1990. In 2004, 1.2 million (0.42 percent of the total population) resided in the U.S. The 2006–2010 ACS 5-year estimates show that an estimated 1.5 million people (0.5 percent of the total population) with Arab ancestry were living in the United States, representing a 76.0 percent increase since 1990.<ref name="census2006"/> Currently, the ten states with the largest Arab populations are California, Michigan, New York, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, respectively.<ref name="aaiusa1">{{cite web|title=Demographics |url=http://www.aaiusa.org/pages/demographics/ |publisher=Arab American Institute |accessdate=February 6, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202071653/http://www.aaiusa.org/pages/demographics/ |archivedate=December 2, 2010 }}</ref> These populations are generally concentrated in metropolitan areas.

Arab American communities are generally tight-knit, as they value family, tradition, and economic achievement. Earlier immigrants worked as peddlers and in factories.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arab American Stories - Arab American Stories|url=http://www.arabamericanstories.org|publisher=The Violet Jabara Charitable Trust|accessdate=February 6, 2015}}</ref> More recent immigrants, however, have taken up roles in all parts of society, including public leadership positions. These increasingly professional roles have helped establish a majority of the populations in bustling cities. Consequently, their increasing role in high-level positions has helped raise the median income of Arab American households to $56,433 compared to the $51,914 for all households in the United States.<ref name="aaiusa1"/>
