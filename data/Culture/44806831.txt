'''Light Painting World Alliance''' (LPWA) is a [[Non profit|nonprofit organization (NPO)]]. Its goal is to offer the [[light painting]] community a cross-border platform to show its art, to set up networks and to promote social concerns and further training by means of light painting.

For this purpose LPWA established a network of local representatives<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lpwalliance.com/lr/|title=Local representatives LPWA|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> from currently 30 countries worldwide.
It was founded in December 2011 by Russian artist Sergey B. Churkin.
LPWA showcases light painting works of its members in the context of exhibitions, conferences and special events using an advisory board of lightpainters for selection.

In September 2014 LPWA was awarded status as an official Collaborating Partner<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lpwalliance.com/event/66|title=Official Collaborating Partner of the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies 2015|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref>  of the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies 2015 (IYL2015) by [[UNESCO]].
