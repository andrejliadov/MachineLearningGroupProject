July 2012, Millennium gained approval to be added to Transport Canada's List of Vehicles Admissible from the United States, after confirming compliance with all applicable Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS), and the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act (MVSA).

In December 2012, Millennium Luxury Coaches announced they had successfully relocated the diesel exhaust fluid inlet to the driver's side of the coach. It had previously been located on the passenger's side, which presented a problem at filling stations because of the pump being located on the driver's side. This stirred controversy as skeptics noted it brought warranty concerns with Prevost. Prevost engineers and management visited Millennium's facility to view the modifications, giving the modifications a thumbs up and eliminating warranty concerns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prevost OKs Millennium Chassis Modification|url=http://www.rvbusiness.com/2012/12/prevost-oks-millennium-chassis-modification/|work=Rv Business|accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref>
