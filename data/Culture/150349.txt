{{Sociology}}
A '''subculture''' is a group of people within a [[culture]] that differentiates itself from the parent culture to which it belongs, often maintaining some of its founding principles. Subcultures develop their own norms and values regarding cultural, political and sexual matters. Subcultures are part of society while keeping their specific characteristics intact. Examples of subcultures include [[hippies]], [[Goth subculture|goths]], [[Motorcycle club|bikers]] and [[Skinhead|skinheads]]. The [[concept]] of subcultures was developed in [[sociology]] and [[cultural studies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-subculture-theories-definition-examples.html|title=What Is Subculture? - Theories, Definition & Examples - Video & Lesson Transcript|publisher=Study.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-08}}</ref> Subcultures differ from [[counterculture]]s.

While exact definitions vary, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines a subculture as "a cultural group within a larger culture, often having [[belief]]s or interests at variance with those of the larger culture."<ref>http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/subculture</ref>
As early as 1950, [[David Riesman]] distinguished between a [[majority]], "which passively accepted [[Commerce|commercially]] provided styles and meanings, and a 'subculture' which actively sought a minority style ... and interpreted it in accordance with [[Subversion (politics)|subversive]] [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]".<ref>Middleton 1990</ref> In his 1979 book ''[[Subculture: The Meaning of Style]]'', [[Dick Hebdige]] argued that a subculture is a [[subversion]] to normalcy. He wrote that subcultures can be perceived as negative due to their nature of criticism to the dominant societal standard. Hebdige argued that subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erikclabaugh.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/181899847-Subculture.pdf|title=Subculture: the meaning of style|last=Hebdige|first=Dick|date=1979}}</ref>

In 1995, [[Sarah Thornton]], drawing on [[Pierre Bourdieu]], described "subcultural capital" as the cultural knowledge and commodities acquired by members of a subculture, raising their status and helping differentiate themselves from members of other groups.<ref>Thornton 1995</ref> In 2007, Ken Gelder proposed to distinguish subcultures from countercultures based on the level of immersion in society.<ref name="Gelder 2007">Gelder 2007</ref> Gelder further proposed six key ways in which subcultures can be identified through their:
# often negative relations to work (as 'idle', 'parasitic', at play or at leisure, etc.);
# negative or ambivalent relation to class (since subcultures are not 'class-conscious' and don't conform to traditional class definitions);
# association with territory (the 'street', the 'hood', the club, ''etc.), rather than property;
# movement out of the home and into non-domestic forms of belonging (i.e. social groups other than the [[family]]);
# stylistic ties to excess and exaggeration (with some exceptions);
# refusal of the banalities of ordinary life and massification.<ref name="Gelder 2007"/>

Sociologists [[Gary Alan Fine]] and [[Sherryl Kleinman]] argued that their 1979 research showed that a subculture is a group that serves to motivate a potential member to adopt the artifacts, behaviors, norms, and values characteristic of the group.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=Gary Alan|last2=Kleinman|first2=Sherryl|date=1979|title=Rethinking Subculture: An Interactionist Analysis|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2778065|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=85|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1086/226971|jstor=2778065|s2cid=144955053|issn=0002-9602}}</ref>

== History of studies ==
The evolution of subcultural studies has three main steps:<ref>Berzano L., Genova C., Lifestyles and Subcultures. History and a New Perspective, Routledge, London, 2015 (part II)</ref>

===Subcultures and deviance===
The earliest subcultures studies came from the so-called Chicago School, who interpreted them as forms of deviance and delinquency. Starting with what they called Social Disorganization Theory, they claimed that subcultures emerged on one hand because of some population sectors’ lack of socialisation with the mainstream culture and, on the other, because of their adoption of alternative [[Axiology|axiological]] and normative models. As [[Robert E. Park]], [[Ernest Burgess]] and [[Louis Wirth]] suggested, by means of selection and segregation processes, there thus appear in society natural areas or moral regions where deviant models concentrate and are re-inforced; they do not accept objectives or means of action offered by the mainstream culture, proposing different ones in their place – thereby becoming, depending on circumstances, innovators, rebels or retreatists ([[Richard Cloward]] and [[Lloyd Ohlin]]). Subcultures, however, are not only the result of alternative action strategies but also of labelling processes on the basis of which, as [[Howard S. Becker]] explains, society defines them as outsiders. As Cohen clarifies, every subculture's style, consisting of image, demeanour and language becomes its recognition trait. And an individual's progressive adoption of a subcultural model will furnish him/her with growing status within this context but it will often, in tandem, deprive him/her of status in the broader social context outside where a different model prevails.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jtpcrim.org/January-2015/Rethinking-subculture.pdf|title=Rethinking Subcultures and Subculture Theory in the Study of Youth Crime _ A theoretical Discourse|last=Nwalozie|first=Chijioke J.|date=2015}}</ref>. Cohen used the term 'Corner Boys' which were unable to compete with their better secured and prepared peers. These lower-class boys did not have equal access to resources, resulting in the status of frustration and search for a solution.<ref>Newburn, T. & Proquest, 2017. Criminology Third., Ann Arbor, Mich.]: ProQuest. pp. 210  </ref>

===Subcultures and resistance===
In the work of John Clarke, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], Tony Jefferson and Brian Roberts of the Birmingham CCCS ([[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]]), subcultures are interpreted as forms of resistance. Society is seen as being divided into two fundamental classes, the working class and the middle class, each with its own class culture, and middle-class culture being dominant. Particularly in the working class, subcultures grow out of the presence of specific interests and affiliations around which cultural models spring up, in conflict with both their parent culture and mainstream culture. Facing a weakening of class identity, subcultures are then new forms of collective identification expressing what Cohen called symbolic resistance against the mainstream culture and developing imaginary solutions for structural problems. As [[Paul Willis]] and [[Dick Hebdige]] underline, identity and resistance are expressed through the development of a distinctive style which, by a re-signification and ‘bricolage’ operation, use cultural industry goods to communicate and express one's own conflict. Yet the cultural industry is often capable of re-absorbing the components of such a style and once again transforming them into goods. At the same time the mass media, while they participate in building subcultures by broadcasting their images, also weaken them by depriving them of their subversive content or by spreading a stigmatized image of them.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwhHBQAAQBAJ&q=Subculture+and+Deviance+_+Post+War+Consumerism+and+Resistance&pg=PA115|title=The Death and Resurrection of Deviance: Current Ideas and Research|last1=Dellwing|first1=M.|last2=Kotarba|first2=J.|last3=Pino|first3=N.|date=2014-10-22|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137303806|language=en}}</ref>

===Subcultures and distinction===
The most recent interpretations see subcultures as forms of distinction. In an attempt to overcome the idea of subcultures as forms of deviance or resistance, they describe subcultures as collectivities which, on a cultural level, are sufficiently homogeneous internally and heterogeneous with respect to the outside world to be capable of developing, as Paul Hodkinson points out, consistent distinctiveness, identity, commitment and autonomy. Defined by [[Sarah Thornton]] as taste cultures, subcultures are endowed with elastic, porous borders, and are inserted into relationships of interaction and mingling, rather than independence and conflict, with the cultural industry and mass media, as [[Steve Redhead]] and David Muggleton emphasize. The very idea of a unique, internally homogeneous, dominant culture is explicitly criticized. Thus forms of individual involvement in subcultures are fluid and gradual, differentiated according to each actor's investment, outside clear dichotomies. The ideas of different levels of subcultural capital ([[Sarah Thornton]]) possessed by each individual, of the supermarket of style ([[Ted Polhemus]]) and of style surfing (Martina Böse) replace that of the subculture's insiders and outsiders – with the perspective of subcultures supplying resources for the construction of new identities going beyond strong, lasting identifications.

The study of subcultures often consists of the study of symbolism attached to [[clothing]], [[music]] and other visible affectations by members of subcultures, and also of the ways in which these same symbols are interpreted by members of the dominant culture. Dick Hebdige writes that members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes [[fashion]]s, mannerisms and [[argot]].<ref>Hebdige 1981</ref>

[[File:Star Trek uniforms.jpg|thumb|left|[[Star Trek fandom|Trekkies]] are a subculture of ''[[Star Trek]]'' fans.]]
Subcultures can exist at all levels of organizations, highlighting the fact that there are multiple cultures or value combinations usually evident in any one organization that can complement but also compete with the overall organisational culture.<ref>Anheier, Helmut K., Stefan Toepler and Regina List, eds., ''International Encyclopedia of Civil Society'', (Springer, 2010)</ref> In some instances, subcultures have been legislated against, and their activities regulated or curtailed.<ref name="HallStuart">Hall, Stuart, Tony Jefferson, Resistance Through Rituals: Youth Subcultures in Post-War Britain (Routledge, 1993).</ref> British [[youth subculture]]s had been described as a moral problem that ought to be handled by the guardians of the dominant culture within the [[post-war consensus]].<ref name="HallStuart" />

==Relationships with mainstream culture==
[[File:Bar-b-quin' with my HONEY.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Potato chip]] packages featuring [[Hip-hop culture|hip hop subcultural]] designs in a case of mainstream commercial cultural merging]]
It may be difficult to identify certain subcultures because their style (particularly clothing and music) may be adopted by mass culture for commercial purposes. Businesses often seek to capitalize on the subversive allure of subcultures in search of ''[[Cool (aesthetic)|Cool]]'', which remains valuable in the selling of any product.<ref>Howes, David. ''Cross-cultural consumption: global markets, local realities.'' New York: Routledge, 1996. Print.</ref> This process of [[cultural appropriation]] may often result in the death or evolution of the subculture, as its members adopt new styles that appear alien to mainstream society.<ref>Goldstein-Gidoni, Ofra. "Producers of 'Japan' in Israel: ''Cultural appropriation'' in a non-colonial context." ''Ethnos:Journal of Anthropology'' 68.3 (2003): 365. Print.</ref>

Music-based subcultures are particularly vulnerable to this process; what may be considered subcultures at one stage in their histories{{snd}}such as [[jazz]], [[Goth subculture|goth]], [[Punk subculture|punk]], [[Hip hop culture|hip hop]] and [[rave culture]]s{{snd}}may represent mainstream taste within a short period.<ref>Blair, M. Elizabeth, "Commercialization of Rap Music Youth ''Subculture''." Journal of Popular Culture 27.3 (1993): 21-33. Print.</ref> Some subcultures reject or modify the importance of style, stressing membership through the adoption of an [[ideology]] which may be much more resistant to commercial exploitation.<ref>Lewin, Phillip, J. Patrick Williams. "Reconceptualizing Punk through ''Ideology'' and Authenticity". ''Conference Papers--American Sociological Association''. 2007 Annual Meeting, 2007.</ref> The [[punk subculture]]'s distinctive (and initially shocking) style of clothing was adopted by mass-market fashion companies once the subculture became a media interest. [[Dick Hebdige]] argues that the punk subculture shares the same "radical aesthetic practices" as [[Dada]] and [[surrealism]]:
<blockquote>
Like Duchamp's 'ready mades' - manufactured objects which qualified as art because he chose to call them such, the most unremarkable and inappropriate items - a pin, a plastic clothes peg, a television component, a razor blade, a tampon - could be brought within the province of punk (un)fashion ... Objects borrowed from the most sordid of contexts found a place in punks' ensembles; lavatory chains were draped in graceful arcs across chests in plastic bin liners. Safety pins were taken out of their domestic 'utility' context and worn as gruesome ornaments through the cheek, ear or lip ... fragments of school uniform (white bri-nylon shirts, school ties) were symbolically defiled (the shirts covered in graffiti, or fake blood; the ties left undone) and juxtaposed against leather drains or shocking pink mohair tops.<ref>Dick Hebdige p.106-12</ref>
</blockquote>

== Urban tribes ==
{{redirect|Urban tribe|the  electronic musician|Urban Tribe}}
In 1985, French sociologist [[Michel Maffesoli]] coined the term ''urban tribe''. It gained widespread use after the publication of his ''Le temps des tribus: le déclin de l'individualisme dans les sociétés postmodernes'' (1988).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Frehse |first1=Fraya |title=As realidades que as 'tribos urbanas' criam |trans-title=The realities that 'urban tribes' create |language=pt |journal=Revista Brasileira de Ciências Sociais |date=February 2006 |volume=21 |issue=60 |doi=10.1590/S0102-69092006000100012 }}</ref> Eight years later, this book was published in the [[United Kingdom]] as ''The Time of the Tribes: The Decline of Individualism in Mass Society''.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Time of the Tribes: The Decline of Individualism in Mass Society|author= Maffesoli, Michel|date= 1996-02-27|isbn=080398474X }}</ref>

According to Maffesoli, urban tribes are microgroups of people who share common interests in urban areas. The members of these relatively small groups tend to have similar worldviews, dress styles and behavioral patterns.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.expatica.com/fr/news/Urban-tribes-thriving-in-modern-society_434885.html|title='Urban tribes' thriving in modern society|access-date=2017-09-08}}</ref> Their [[social interactions]] are largely [[Formality|informal]] and emotionally laden, different from [[late capitalism]]'s [[corporate]]-[[bourgeoisie]] cultures, based on dispassionate logic. Maffesoli claims that [[Punk subculture|punks]] are a typical example of an "urban tribe".<ref>Maffesoli 1996</ref>

Five years after the first English translation of ''Le temps des tribus'', writer [[Ethan Watters]] claims to have coined the same [[neologism]] in a ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' article. This was later expanded upon the idea in his book ''Urban Tribes: A Generation Redefines Friendship, Family, and Commitment''. According to Watters, urban tribes are groups of never-[[Marriage|marrieds]] between the ages of 25 and 45 who gather in common-interest groups and enjoy an urban [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], which offers an alternative to traditional [[family]] structures.<ref>Watters 2003</ref>

== Sexual ==

{{further|Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures}}
The [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s led to a countercultural rejection of the established sexual and gender norms, particularly in the urban areas of Europe, North and South America, Australia, and white South Africa. A more permissive social environment in these areas led to a proliferation of ''sexual subcultures''—cultural expressions of [[heteronormativity|non-normative sexuality]]. As with other subcultures, sexual subcultures adopted certain styles of fashion and gestures to distinguish them from the mainstream.<ref name=gale/>

Homosexuals expressed themselves through the [[gay culture]], considered the largest sexual subculture of the 20th century. With the ever-increasing acceptance of homosexuality in the early 21st century, including its expressions in fashion, music, and design, the gay culture can no longer be considered a subculture in many parts of the world, although some aspects of gay culture like [[Leather subculture|leathermen]], [[Bear (gay culture)|bears]], and [[Feeder (fetish)|feeders]] are considered subcultures within the gay movement itself.<ref name=gale>Jaime Hovey, ''Sexual subcultures'' entry in F. Malti-Douglas, ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender'', Vol. 4, Gale, 2007, pp. 1372-1373</ref> The [[butch and femme]] identities or roles among some lesbians also engender their own subculture with stereotypical attire, for instance [[drag king]]s.<ref name=gale2>Jaime Hovey, ''Sexual subcultures'' entry in F. Malti-Douglas, ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender'', Vol. 4, Gale, 2007, pp. 1374</ref> A late 1980s development, the [[queer]] movement can be considered a subculture broadly encompassing those that reject normativity in sexual behavior, and who celebrate visibility and activism. The wider movement coincided with growing academic interests in [[queer studies]] and [[queer theory]]. Aspects of sexual subcultures can vary along other cultural lines. For instance, in the United States, [[down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]] refers to African-American men who do not identify themselves with the gay or queer cultures, but who practice [[Cruising for sex|gay cruising]], and adopt a specific hip-hop attire during this activity.<ref name=gale2/>

==Social media==
In a 2011 study, Brady Robards and Andy Bennett said that online identity expression has been interpreted as exhibiting subcultural qualities. However, they argue it is more in line with [[neotribalism]] than with what is often classified as subculture. Social networking [[website]]s are quickly becoming the most used form of communication and means to distribute information and news. They offer a way for people with similar backgrounds, lifestyles, professions or hobbies to connect. According to a co-founder and executive creative strategist for RE-UP, as technology becomes a "life force," subcultures become the main bone of contention for brands as networks rise through cultural mash-ups and phenomenons.<ref>{{cite web|author=Laurent Francois @lilzeon |url=http://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/subcultures-big-opportunity-social-brands-generate-value |title=Subcultures: Big Opportunity for Social Brands to Generate Value |publisher=Social Media Today |date=2013-05-25 |accessdate=2017-10-19}}</ref> Where social media is concerned, there seems to be a growing interest among media producers to use subcultures for branding. This is seen most actively on social network sites with user-generated content, such as [[YouTube]].

Social media expert Scott Huntington cites one of the ways in which subcultures have been and can be successfully targeted to generate revenue: "It’s common to assume that subcultures aren’t a major market for most companies. Online apps for shopping, however, have made significant strides. Take Etsy, for example. It only allow vendors to sell handmade or vintage items, both of which can be considered a rather "hipster" subculture. However, retailers on the site made almost $900 million in sales."<ref>[http://socialmediadata.com/subcultures-and-social-media-mass-differentiation/ Subcultures and Social Media: Mass Differentiation]</ref>

==Discrimination==
[[Discrimination]] is sometimes directed towards a person based on their culture or subculture. In 2013, the [[Greater Manchester Police]] in the United Kingdom began to classify attacks on subcultures such as [[Goth subculture|goths]], [[Emo|emos]], [[Punk subculture|punks]] and [[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]] as hate crimes, in the same way they record abuse against people because of their religion, race, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity.<ref>{{cite news |date= 4 April 2013 |title= Attacks on goths, punks and emos are 'hate crimes' |url= https://www.channel4.com/news/goth-hate-crime-emo-punk-metal-police-gmp |work= Channel 4 News |access-date= 24 June 2020}}</ref> The decision followed the [[Murder of Sophie Lancaster|murder of Sophie Lancaster]] and beating of her boyfriend in 2007, who were attacked because they were goths.<ref>{{cite news |last= Sedgwick |first= Mark |date= 4 April 2013 |title= How are goths and emos defined? |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22026044 |work= BBC News |access-date= 24 June 2020}}</ref>

In 2012, [[emo killings in Iraq]] occurred, which consisted of between at least 6 and up to 70 teenage boys who were kidnapped, tortured and murdered in Baghdad and Iraq, due to being targeted because they dressed in a Westernized emo style.
