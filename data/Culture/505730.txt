== Overview ==
Cultural assimilation may involve either a quick or a gradual change depending on the circumstances of the group. Full assimilation occurs when members of a society become indistinguishable from those of the {{cl-span|dominant group|date=October 2020}}.

Whether a given group should assimilate is often disputed by both members of the group and others in society. Cultural assimilation does not guarantee social alikeness. Geographical and other natural barriers between cultures, even if created by the predominant culture, may be culturally different.[[Cultural assimilation#cite note-2|<sup>[2]</sup>]] Cultural assimilation can happen either spontaneously or forcibly, the latter when more dominant cultures use various means aimed at [[forced assimilation]].

Various types of assimilation, including forced cultural assimilation, is particularly relevant in regards to indigenous groups during colonialism taking place between the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. This type of assimilation included religious conversion, separation of families, changes of gender roles, division of property among foreign power, elimination of local economies and lack of sustainable food supply. Whether via colonialism or within one nation, methods of forced assimilation are often unsustainable, leading to revolts and collapses of power to maintain control over cultural norms.  Often, cultures that are forced into different cultural practices through forced cultural assimilation will revert to their native practices, and religions that differ from the forced cultural values from other dominant powers. In addition throughout history, voluntary assimilation is often in response to pressure from a more predominant culture, and conformity is a solution for people to remain in safety. An example of voluntary cultural assimilation would be during the Spanish Inquisition when Jews and Muslims accepted the Roman Catholic Church as their religion, meanwhile, in private, many people still practised their traditional religions. This type of assimilation is used to convince a dominant power that a culture has peacefully assimilated yet often voluntary assimilation does not mean the group fully conforms to the accepted cultural beliefs.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|title=assimilation {{!}} Definition, History, & Facts|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/assimilation-society|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref>

The term "assimilation" is often used with regard to not only indigenous groups but also immigrants settled in a new land. A new culture and new attitudes toward the origin culture are obtained through contact and communication. Assimilation assumes that a relatively-tenuous culture gets to be united to one unified culture. That process happens by contact and accommodation between each culture. The current definition of assimilation is usually used to refer to immigrants, but in [[multiculturalism]], cultural assimilation can happen all over the world and within varying social contexts and is not limited to specific areas.

===Australia===
{{see|Indigenous Australians|Stolen Generations}}

Legislation applying the policy of "protection" over [[Aboriginal Australians]] (separating them from white society<ref name=at/>) was adopted in some [[states and territories of Australia]] when they were still colonies, before the [[federation of Australia]]: in the [[Colony of Victoria|Victoria]] in 1867, [[Colony of Western Australia|Western Australia]] in 1886, and [[colony of Queensland|Queensland]] in 1897. After federation, [[New South Wales]] crafted their policy in 1909, [[South Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]] (which was under the control and of South Australia at the time) in 1910-11. [[Mission station]]s missions and Government-run [[Aboriginal reserve]]s were created, and Aboriginal people moved onto them. Legislation restricted their movement, prohibited [[liquor|alcohol use]] and regulated employment. The policies were reinforced in the first half of the 20th century (when it was realised that Aboriginal people would not die out or be fully absorbed in white society<ref name=at/>) such as in the provisions of the ''[[Welfare Ordinance 1953]]'', in which Aboriginal people were made [[wards of the state]]. "Part-Aboriginal" (known as [[half-caste]]) children were forcibly removed from their parents in order to educate them in European ways; the girls were often trained to be [[domestic servant]]s.<ref name=alrc>{{cite book|url=https://www.alrc.gov.au/publication/recognition-of-aboriginal-customary-laws-alrc-report-31/3-aboriginal-societies-the-experience-of-contact/changing-policies-towards-aboriginal-people/|title=Recognition of Aboriginal Customary Laws|series=ALRC Report 31|author=[[Australian Law Reform Commission]]|date=18 August 2010|chapter=3. Aboriginal Societies: The Experience of Contact: Changing Policies Towards Aboriginal People|access-date=10 August 2020}}</ref> The protectionist policies were discontinued, and an assimilation policies took over. These proposed that "full-blood" [[Indigenous Australians]] should be allowed to “die out”, while "half-castes" were encouraged to assimilate into the white community. Indigenous people were regarded as inferior to white people by these policies, and often experienced [[racism in Australia|discrimination in the predominantly white towns]] after having to move to seek work.<ref name=at>{{cite web | title=A White Australia | website=Australians Together  | url=https://australianstogether.org.au/discover/australian-history/a-white-australia/ | access-date=10 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite document|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/digitised_collections/remove/89976.pdf|via=AIATSIS|title=Annual Report 1958/59|author=Northern Territory Administration.

Between 1910 and 1970, several generations of Indigenous children were removed from their parents, and have become known as the [[Stolen Generations]]. The policy has done lasting damage to individuals, family and Indigenous culture.<ref name=at/>

=== Canada 1800s–1990s: Forced assimilation of Indigenous peoples ===
During the 19th and 20th centuries, and continuing until 1996, when the [[Canadian Indian residential school system|Canadian Indian residential school]] was closed, the Canadian government, aided by Christian Churches began a campaign to forcibly assimilate [[Indigenous peoples in Canada]]. The government consolidated power over Indigenous land through treaties and the use of force, eventually isolating most Indigenous peoples to reserves. Marriage practices and spiritual ceremonies were banned, and spiritual leaders were imprisoned. Additionally, the Canadian government instituted an extensive residential school system to assimilate children. Indigenous children were separated from their families and no longer permitted to express their culture at these new schools. They were not allowed to speak their language or practise their own traditions without receiving punishment. There were many cases in which violent or sexual abuse by the Christian church was committed. The [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada]] concluded that this effort amounted to [[cultural genocide]]. The schools actively worked to alienate children from their cultural roots. Students were prohibited from speaking their native languages, were regularly abused, and were arranged marriages by the government after their graduation. The explicit goal of the Canadian government, through the Catholic and Anglican churches, was to completely assimilate Indigenous peoples into broader Canadian society and destroy all traces of their native history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.myrobust.com/websites/trcinstitution/File/Reports/Executive_Summary_English_Web.pdf|title=Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future: Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626204608/http://www.myrobust.com/websites/trcinstitution/File/Reports/Executive_Summary_English_Web.pdf|archive-date=26 June 2018}}</ref>

=== Brazil ===
In January 2019, newly elected [[Brazil]]'s president [[Jair Bolsonaro]] has stripped the indigenous affairs agency [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|FUNAI]] of the responsibility to identify and demarcate [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous lands]]. He argued that those territories have very tiny isolated populations and proposed to integrate them into the larger Brazilian society.<ref>{{cite news |title=Brazil's new president makes it harder to define indigenous lands |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4808295/jair-bolsonaro-funai-indigenous-farm-brazil/ |work=Global News |date=January 2, 2019}}</ref> According to the [[Survival International]], "Taking responsibility for indigenous land demarcation away from FUNAI, the Indian affairs department, and giving it to the Agriculture Ministry is virtually a declaration of open warfare against [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Brazil’s tribal peoples]]."<ref>{{cite news |title=President Bolsonaro 'declares war' on Brazil's indigenous peoples - Survival responds |url=https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/12060 |publisher=[[Survival International]] |date=January 3, 2019}}</ref>

=== Latin America ===
A major contributor to cultural assimilation in South America began during exploration and colonialism that often is thought{{by whom?|date=July 2020}} to begin in 1492 when Europeans began to explore the Atlantic in search of "the Indies", leading to the discovery of the Americas.{{citation needed|date= May 2020}} Europe remained dominant over the Americas' indigenous populations as resources such as labor, natural resources i.e. lumber, copper, gold, silver and agricultural products flooded into Europe, yet these gains were one-sided, as indigenous groups did not benefit from trade deals with colonial powers.{{citation needed|date= May 2020}} In addition to this, colonial metropoles such as Portugal and Spain required that colonies in South America assimilate to European customs - such as following the Holy [[Roman Catholic Church]], acceptance of Spanish or Portuguese over indigenous languages and accepting European-style government.<ref>{{Cite web|title= Pueblo uprising of 1680 (article)|url= https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/precontact-and-early-colonial-era/spanish-colonization/a/pueblo-uprising-of-1680|website= Khan Academy|language= en|access-date= 2020-05-28}}</ref>

Through forced cultural assimilation, colonial powers such as Spain used methods of violence to assert cultural dominance over indigenous populations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Gabbert|first= Wolfgang|date= 2012|title= The longue durée of Colonial Violence in Latin America|journal= Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung|volume= 37|issue= 3 (141)|pages= 254–275|jstor= 41636608|issn= 0172-6404}}</ref> One example occurred in 1519 when the Spanish explorer [[Hernán Cortés]] reached  [[Tenochtitlan|Tenochtitlán]] - the original capital of the Aztec Empire in Mexico.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|title= The Spanish conquistadores and colonial empire (article)|url= https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history/precontact-and-early-colonial-era/spanish-colonization/a/the-spanish-conquistadores-and-colonial-empire|website= Khan Academy|language= en|access-date= 2020-05-28}}</ref> After discovering that the Aztecs practiced human sacrifice, Cortés killed high-ranked Aztecs and held  [[Moctezuma II]], the Aztec ruler, captive. Shortly after, Cortés began creating alliances to resume power in Tenochtitlán and renamed it Mexico City.<ref name=":12" />  Without taking away power through murder and spread of infectious diseases the Spanish [[conquistadores]] (relatively small in number) would not have been able to take over Mexico and convert many people to Catholicism and slavery.<ref name=":12" />{{qn|date=July 2020}}  While Spaniards influenced linguistic and religious cultural assimilation among indigenous peoples in South America during colonialism, many indigenous languages such as the Incan language [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] are still used in places such as Peru to this day by at least 4 million people. This demonstrates that forced cultural assimilation is not long-term or fully effective on different cultures such as the indigenous in Latin America.

=== New Zealand ===
In the course of the [[colonisation of New Zealand]] from the late-18th century onwards, assimilation of the indigenous  [[Māori people|Maori]] population to the culture of incoming European visitors and settlers at first occurred spontaneously. Genetic assimilation commenced early and continued - the 1961 [[New Zealand census]] classified only 62.2% of Maori as "full-blood Maoris".<ref>

== Immigrant assimilation ==
Social scientists rely on four primary benchmarks to assess immigrant assimilation: [[socioeconomic status]], geographic distribution, [[second language]] attainment, and [[exogamy|intermarriage]].<ref name="Waters" />  William A.V. Clark defines immigrant assimilation in the United States as "a way of understanding the social dynamics of American society and that it is the process that occurs spontaneously and often unintended in the course of interaction between majority and [[minority groups]]."<ref name="Clark">{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=W. |year=2003 |title=Immigrants and the American Dream: Remaking the Middle Class |location=New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-880-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/immigrantsameric0000clar }}</ref>

Studies have also noted the positive effects of immigrant assimilation. A study by Bleakley and Chin (2010) found that people who arrived at or before the age of nine from non-English speaking countries tend to speak English as well as those from English speaking countries. Conversely, those who arrived after nine from non- English speaking countries have much lower speaking proficiency and this increases linearly with age at arrival. The study also noted sociocultural impacts such as those with better English skills are less likely to be currently married, more likely to divorce, have fewer children, and have spouses closer to their age. A 2014 study done by Verkuyten found that immigrant children who adapt through integration or assimilation are received more positively by their peers than those who adapt through marginalization or separation.

== Perspective of dominant culture ==
There has been little to no existing research or evidence that demonstrates whether and how immigrant's mobility gains—assimilating to a dominant country such as language ability, socioeconomic status etc.— causes changes in the perception of those who were born in the dominant country. This essential type of research provides information on how immigrants are accepted into dominant countries. In an article by Ariela Schachter, titled "From "different" to "similar": an experimental approach to understanding assimilation", a survey was taken of white American citizens to view their perception of immigrants who now resided in the United States.<ref name=":5">{{cite journal |last1=Schachter |first1=Ariela |title=From "Different" to "Similar": An Experimental Approach to Understanding Assimilation |journal=American Sociological Review |date=1 October 2016 |volume=81 |issue=5 |pages=981–1013 |doi=10.1177/0003122416659248 |s2cid=151621019 |language=en |issn=0003-1224}}</ref> The survey indicated the whites tolerated immigrants in their home country. White natives are open to having "structural" relation with the immigrants-origin individuals, for instance, friends and neighbours; however, this was with the exception of black immigrants and natives and undocumented immigrants.<ref name=":5" /> However, at the same time, white Americans viewed all non-white Americans, regardless of legal status, as dissimilar.

A similar journal by Jens Hainmueller and Daniel J. Hopkins titled "The Hidden American Immigration Consensus: A Conjoint Analysis of Attitudes toward Immigrants" confirmed similar attitudes towards immigrants.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hainmueller |first1=Jens |last2=Hopkins |first2=Daniel J. |title=The Hidden American Immigration Consensus: A Conjoint Analysis of Attitudes toward Immigrants |journal=American Journal of Political Science |date=2015 |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=529–548 |issn=0092-5853|jstor=24583081 |doi=10.1111/ajps.12138 }}</ref> The researchers used an experiment to reach their goal which was to test nine theoretical relevant attributes of hypothetical immigrants. Asking a population-based sample of U.S citizens to decide between pairs of immigrants applying for admission to the United States, the U.S citizen would see an application with information for two immigrants including notes about their education status, country, origin, and other attributes. The results showed Americans viewed educated immigrants in high-status jobs favourably, whereas they view the following groups unfavourably: those who lack plans to work, those who entered without authorization, those who do not speak fluent English and those of Iraqi descent.

== Adaptation to new country ==
As the number of international students entering the US has increased, so has the number of international students in US colleges and universities. The adaption of these newcomers is important in cross-cultural research. In the study "Cross-Cultural Adaptation of International College Student in the United States" by Yikang Wang, the goal was to examine how the psychological and socio-cultural adaption of international college students varied over time.<ref name=":6">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yikang |last2=Li |first2=Ting |last3=Noltemeyer |first3=Amity |last4=Wang |first4=Aimin |last5=Zhang |first5=Jinghua |last6=Shaw |first6=Kevin |title=Cross-Cultural Adaptation of International College Students in the United States |journal=Journal of International Students |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=821–842 |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1180864 |language=en |issn=2162-3104|date=2017-11-30 |doi=10.32674/jis.v8i2.116 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The survey contained a sample of 169 international students attending a coeducational public university. The two subtypes of adaption: psychological and socio-cultural were examined. Psychological adaption refers to "feelings of well-being or satisfaction during cross-cultural transitions;"<ref name="ShockPsych">{{Cite book|title=The psychology of culture shock|last=Ward, Colleen A.|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|others=Bochner, Stephen., Furnham, Adrian.|isbn=978-0415162340|edition= 2nd|location=Hove, East Sussex|oclc=44927055}}</ref> while socio-cultural refers to the ability to fit into the new culture.<ref name=" ShockPsych"/> The results show both graduate and undergraduate students showed both the satisfactory and socio-cultural skilled changed over time. Psychological adaption had the most significant change for a student who has resided in the US for at least 24 months while socio-cultural adaption steadily increased over time. It can be concluded that eventually over time, the minority group will shed some of their culture's characteristic when in a new country and incorporate new culture qualities. Also, it was confirmed that the more time spent in a new country would result in becoming more accustomed to the dominate countries aspects of characteristics.

Figure 2 demonstrates as the length of time resided in the United States increase—the dominant country, the life satisfaction and socio-cultural skill increase as well—positive correlation.<ref name=":6" />

In a study by Viola Angelini, "Life Satisfaction of Immigrant: Does cultural assimilation matter?", the theory of assimilation as being beneficial is confirmed.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal |last1=Angelini |first1=Viola |last2=Casi |first2=Laura |last3=Corazzini |first3=Luca |title=Life satisfaction of immigrants: does cultural assimilation matter? |journal=Journal of Population Economics |date=1 July 2015 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=817–844 |doi=10.1007/s00148-015-0552-1 |s2cid=9417180 |language=en |issn=1432-1475|url=http://economia.unipd.it/sites/decon.unipd.it/files/20130168.pdf }}</ref> The goal of this study was to assess the difference between cultural assimilation and the subjective well-being of immigrants. The journal included a study that examined a "direct measure of assimilation with a host culture and immigrants' subjective well-being."<ref name=":3" /> Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, it was concluded that there was a positive correlation between cultural assimilation and an immigrant's life's satisfaction/wellbeing even after discarding factors such as employment status, wages, etc. "Life Satisfaction of Immigrant: Does cultural assimilation matter?" also confirms "association with life satisfaction is stronger for established immigrants than for recent ones."<ref name=":3" /> It was found that the more immigrants that identified with the German culture and who spoke the fluent national language—dominant country language, the more they reported to be satisfied with their lives. Life satisfaction rates were higher for those who had assimilated to the dominant country than those who had not assimilated since those who did incorporate the dominant language, religion, psychological aspects, etc.

== Willingness to assimilate and cultural shock ==
{{Further|Culture shock}}

One's willingness to assimilate is, surprisingly, not only based solely on their decision to adopt but other factors as well, such as how they are introduced to the dominant country. In the study "Examination of cultural shock, intercultural sensitivity and willingness to adopt" by Clare D’Souza, the study uses a diary method to analyze the data collected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=D’Souza|first1=Clare|last2=Halimi|first2=Tariq|last3=Singaraju|first3=Stephen|last4=Sillivan Mort|first4=Gillian|date=2016-09-21|title=Examination of cultural shock, intercultural sensitivity and willingness to adapt|journal=Education + Training|volume=58|issue=9|pages=906–925|doi=10.1108/ET-09-2015-0087|issn=0040-0912}}</ref> The study involved students undergoing a study abroad tour. The results show negative intercultural sensitivity is much greater in participants who experience "culture shock".<ref>{{cite web |title=Culture shock |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_shock |website=Wikipedia |access-date=24 April 2019 |language=en |date=10 April 2019}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2019}} Those who experience culture shock have emotional expression and responses of hostility, anger, negativity, anxiety frustration, isolation, and regression. Also, for one who has travelled to the country before permanently moving, they would have predetermined beliefs about the culture and their status within the country.  The emotional expression for this individual includes excitement, happiness, eagerness, and euphoria. This article addresses each theme, pre-travel, culture shock, negative cultural sensitivity and positive cultural sensitivity, their perception, emotional expression and responses, their gender, and the interpretation for the responses.

Similar to Clare D’Souza's journal "Examination of cultural shock, intercultural sensitivity and willingness to adapt," another journal titled "International Students from Melbourne Describing Their Cross-Cultural Transitions Experiences: Culture Shock, Social Interaction, and Friendship Development" by Nish Belford focuses on cultural shock.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Belford|first=Nish|date=2017|title=International Students from Melbourne Describing Their Cross-Cultural Transitions Experiences: Culture Shock, Social Interaction, and Friendship Development|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1140256|journal=Journal of International Students|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=499–521|issn=2162-3104|doi=10.32674/jis.v7i3.206|doi-access=free}}</ref> Belford interviewed international students to explore their experience after living and studying in Melbourne, Australia. The data collected were narratives from the students that focused on variables such as "cultural similarity, intercultural communication competence, intercultural friendship, and relational identity to influence their experiences."<ref name=":4" /> The names of the students have been changed for privacy purposes. Jules, one of the students, stated "It's just the small things that bother me a lot. For example, if people are just walking on the floor with their shoes and then just lying on the bed with their shoes. It bothers me a lot because that's not part of my culture."<ref name=":4" /> Man and Jeremy commented "Like yeah ... I found a few things as a culture shock. As one of my housemates, once like she said I have a step-mother, so in India, I was like in India we don’t have step-mothers - yes she was Aussie. And I mean this was one of those things. The way people speak was different."<ref name=":4" /> Last, Jeremy described his experience as "Yeah, like in Chinese background we normally do not stare at people - when talking to people - so eye contact is quite different and when I walk down the street - like random people say hi, how are you? To me - so which I found it was quite interesting because we Chinese we don't do that, like when you stop someone and if you talk to strangers to China it can be considered that you want something from me - yeah. Yes, it is a completely different experience."<ref name=":4" />, commonly, international students who come into a new country to study abroad are confronted with "strangeness."<ref name=":4" /> This exert focuses only on culture shock and does not include the responses from the students about social interaction and friendship development.

{{Further|Americanization (immigration)}}

[[File:California State Senator Ted Lieu (14023404919).jpg|thumb|Taiwan-born U.S. politician [[Ted Lieu]].]]

Between 1880 and 1920, the United States took in roughly 24 million [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]].<ref name="Waters">{{Cite journal |last1=Waters |first1=Mary C. |last2=Jiménez |first2=Tomás R. |title=Assessing Immigrant Assimilation: New Empirical and Theoretical Challenges |journal=[[Annual Review of Sociology]] |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=105–125 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100026 |url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3203280 }}</ref>  This increase in immigration can be attributed to many historical changes. The beginning of the 21st century has also marked a massive era of immigration, and sociologists are once again trying to make sense of the impacts that immigration has on society and on the immigrants themselves.<ref name="Waters"/>

Assimilation had various meanings in American sociology. [[Henry Pratt Fairchild]] associates American assimilation with Americanization or the ''[[melting pot]]'' theory. Some scholars also believed that assimilation and acculturation were synonymous. According to a common point of view, assimilation is a "process of interpretation and fusion" from another group or person. That may include memories, behaviours, and sentiments. By sharing their experiences and histories, they blend into the common cultural life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/earth-and-environment/ecology-and-environmentalism/environmental-studies/assimilation|title=Assimilation facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Assimilation|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-11-11}}</ref> A related theory is structural pluralism proposed by American sociologist [[Milton Gordon]]. It describes the American situation wherein despite the cultural assimilation of ethnic groups to mainstream American society, they maintained structural separation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Immigration, Assimilation, and the Cultural Construction of American National Identity|last=Anderson|first=Shannon Latkin|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138100411|location=New York|pages=135}}</ref> Gordon maintained that there is limited integration of the immigrants into American social institutions such as educational, occupational, political, and social cliques.<ref name=":2" />

The long history of immigration in the established gateways means that the place of immigrants in terms of [[social class|class]], [[race (classification of human beings)|racial]], and [[ethnic]] hierarchies in the traditional gateways is more structured or established, but on the other hand, the new gateways do not have much immigration [[history]] and so the place of immigrants in terms of class, racial, and ethnic hierarchies are less defined, and immigrants may have more influence to define their position. Secondly, the size of the new gateways may influence immigrant assimilation. Having a smaller gateway may influence the level of [[racial segregation]] among immigrants and native-born people. Thirdly, the difference in institutional arrangements may influence immigrant assimilation. Traditional gateways, unlike new gateways, have many institutions set up to help immigrants such as legal aid, bureaus, social organizations. Finally, Waters and Jimenez have only speculated that those differences may influence immigrant assimilation and the way researchers that should assess immigrant assimilation.<ref name="Waters"/>

=== Canada ===
Canada's multicultural history dates back to its European colonization in the 16th century, when French settlers, British settlers, and indigenous peoples vied for control of the region.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/building-mosaic-evolution-canadas-approach-immigrant-integration|title=Building a Mosaic: The Evolution of Canada's Approach to Immigrant Integration|last=Griffith|first=Andrew|date=2017-10-31|website=migrationpolicy.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>

==== 1900s–present: Integration ====
Canada remains one of the largest [[Immigration to Canada|immigrant populations]] in the world. The 2016 census recorded 7.5 million documented immigrants, representing a fifth of the country's total population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2017028-eng.htm|title=Immigrant population in Canada, 2016 Census of Population|last=Government of Canada|first=Statistics Canada|date=2017-10-25|website=www150.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> Focus has shifted from a rhetoric of cultural assimilation to cultural integration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/200920E|title=Canadian Multiculturalism|website=lop.parl.ca|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref> In contrast to assimilation, integration aims to preserve the roots of a minority society while still allowing for smooth coexistence with the dominant culture.<ref name=":0" />
