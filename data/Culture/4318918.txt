'''Doors Open Days''' or simply '''open days''' provide free access to buildings not normally open to the public. The first Doors Open Day took place in France in 1984,<ref>http://us.france.fr/en/events/european-heritage-days-5</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2015}} and the concept has spread to other places in Europe (see [[European Heritage Days]]), North America,<ref>[http://www.doorsopenontario.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_39_1.html About Doors Open Ontario Retrieved 25 February 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228053418/http://www.doorsopenontario.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/nts_1_39_1.html |date=February 28, 2010 }}</ref> [[Australia]] and elsewhere.

Doors Open Days promotes architecture and heritage sites to a wider audience within and beyond the country's borders. It is an opportunity to discover hidden architectural gems and to see behind doors that are rarely open to the public for free.

Open Doors Days trace their origin to the 1990 Door Open Day held as part of [[Glasgow]]'s  year as [[European City of Culture]]. <ref name="O'TooleSpaces"/>

== Heritage Open Days in England==

== Doors open days in Scotland==
Doors Open Days is organised by the [[Scottish Civic Trust]]. Alongside Scottish Archaeology Month,<ref>[http://www.scottisharchaeologymonth.com scottisharchaeologymonth.com]</ref> the open days form [[Scotland]]'s contribution to [[European Heritage Days]].  This joint initiative between the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Union]] aims to give people a greater understanding of each other through sharing and exploring cultural heritage.  49 countries across [[Europe]] take part annually, in September.

During [[Glasgow]]'s  year as [[European City of Culture]] in 1990, organisers ran an Open Doors event, an event credited with popularizing the Doors Open concept and spreading it to other countries.<ref name="O'TooleSpaces">{{cite news |last1=O'Toole |first1=Bill |title=Doors Open event returns to Pittsburgh, giving you inside access to normally off-limits spaces |url=https://www.nextpittsburgh.com/city-design/doors-open-event-returns-to-pittsburgh-giving-you-inside-access-to-normally-off-limits-spaces/ |accessdate=29 May 2019 |publisher=Next Pittsburgh |date=17 September 2018}}</ref>  Its popularity encouraged other areas to take part the following year and were coordinated by the [[Scottish Civic Trust]].  Doors Open Days now take place throughout Scotland thanks to a dedicated team of area coordinators.  These coordinators work for a mixture of organisations:  [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local councils]], civic trusts, [[cultural heritage|heritage]] organisations and archaeological trusts.

[[Scotland]] is one of the few participating countries where events take place every weekend in September, with different areas choosing their own dates.  More than 900 [[buildings]] now take part. In 2008, over 225,000 visits were made generating £2 million for the Scottish economy.  It is estimated that 5,000 or more [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s give their time to run activities and open doors for members of the public.

Doors Open Days was supported in 2009 by Homecoming Scotland 2009,<ref>[http://www.homecomingscotland2009.com]</ref> a year-long initiative that marked the 250th anniversary of the birth of Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns.  It was funded by the Scottish Government and part financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund.  Its aim was to engage Scots at home, as well as motivate people of Scottish descent and those who simply love Scotland, to take part in an inspirational celebration of Scottish culture and heritage.
