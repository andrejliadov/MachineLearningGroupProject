This '''list of awards for contributions to culture''' is an index to articles about notable awards for contributions to [[culture]]. The list is organized by region and country of the award sponsor, but some awards are open to people or organizations around the world.

"Culture" is an umbrella term that encompasses the [[social behavior]] and [[social norm]]s found in [[human]] [[Society|societies]], as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities and habits of the individuals in these groups.<ref name= tyor1871 >Tylor, Edward. (1871). Primitive Culture. Vol 1. New York: J.P. Putnam's Son</ref>
See "[[Lists of awards]]" for awards specific to the visual and performing arts, literature, law, religion and so on. The awards listed here typically have a more open-ended scope, or else apply to an aspect of culture that is not covered by a more specific list.
