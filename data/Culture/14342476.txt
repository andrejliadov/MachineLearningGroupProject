E. B. Du Bois]]' project of an ''Encyclopedia Africana''. Du Bois envisioned "an ''Encyclopedia Africana''," which was to be "unashamedly [[Afrocentric|Afro-Centric]] but not indifferent to the impact of the outside world."<ref>[[Wilson Jeremiah Moses]] and [[Cain Hope Felder]]: ''[http://www.nathanielturner.com/twoscholarsdiscussafrocentrism.htm Two Scholars Discuss Afrocentrism]''</ref>

[[Daniel Alexander Payne Murray]] was one of the first Afro-Americans to work as a [[librarian]] at the [[Library of Congress]] in 1871. In 1899 Murray organized an exhibit at the [[1900 Paris Exposition]] on [[Negro]] authors. Under his direction, his award-winning exhibit became the core of the Library of Congress's Colored Author Collection. Murray planned to expand his collection and create an [[encyclopedia]] of [[African-American]] achievement.<ref>''Daniel Alexander Payne Murray (1852-1925), Forgotten Librarian, Bibliographer, and Historian'' by Walker, Billie E. ''[[Libraries & Culture]]'' - Volume 40, Number 1, Winter 2005, pp. 25-37</ref> Although he never completed the project, the idea of an encyclopedia that explored the black experience was revived and expanded by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. In 1901 Du Bois widened the scope of the project to encompass the entire [[African diaspora]]. He suggested that the encyclopedia be called the ''Encyclopedia Africana'' in a similar fashion to the ''[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]]''. Du Bois envisioned a scientific and comprehensive work on Africa and peoples of African descent that would refute the [[Enlightenment age|Enlightenment]] notion of blacks as devoid of civilization and the hallmarks of humanity.  Due to lack of support from the established philanthropies, the project died.<ref>''W. E. B. Du Bois and the Encyclopedia Africana, 1909-63'' HENRY LOUIS GATES, JR.
