A '''duology''' is a set of two works of art that are connected, and that can be seen either as a single work or as two individual works. They are commonly found in [[literature]], [[film]], and [[video game]]s, and are less common in other art forms.  Two-part works that are considered components of a larger work also exist, but they are not commonly referred to with the term "duology".

Most duologies are works of [[fiction]] involving the same characters or setting. Others can be connected only by theme or in less obvious ways.
