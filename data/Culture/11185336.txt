'''''America Alone: The End of the World as We Know It''''' is a 2006 [[non-fiction]] book by the Canadian newspaper [[columnist]] and writer [[Mark Steyn]]. It forecasts the [[societal collapse|downfall]] of [[Western culture|Western civilization]] due to internal weaknesses and [[Muslim population growth]] in Western countries and the world generally. Based on his own observations, Steyn says that the fall of the Western world is caused by three factors: [[Demography|demographic]] [[Underpopulation|decline]], unsustainability of the advanced Western [[Social democracy|social democratic]] state, and exhaustion of civilization. By 2007, Steyn's ''America Alone'',  had already convinced many American conservatives that there was an imminent and inevitable Muslim invasion.<ref name="newrepublic_Hari_20070701"/>  The [[Canadian Islamic Congress]] (CIC) filed [[Human rights complaints against Maclean's magazine|Human rights complaints against ''Maclean's'' magazine]]—in which they accused the magazine of [[Islamophobia]]—with the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]], the [[British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal]] and the [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]], based partly on ''Maclean's'' publication of a chapter from Steyn's book, "The Future Belongs to Islam".

==Overview==
In ''America Alone'', which is set in the context of the [[War on Terror|global war on terror]], Steyn argues that "much of what we loosely call the [[Western world]] will not survive the [[21st century|twenty-first century]], and much of it will effectively disappear within our lifetimes, including many if not most European countries."<ref name="Steyn_Regnery_2006">{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Steyn |title=America Alone: The End Of The World As We Know It |publisher= [[Regnery Publishing]]  |date = September 16, 2006 | pages= 224 | isbn =  0-89526-078-6| oclc= 70866885}}</ref>{{rp|xiii}} According to a July 1, 2007 ''[[The New Republic]]'' article, Steyn says that white people "are too self-absorbed to breed", while the Muslim population is increasing rapidly—the 20 million European Muslims in 2006, will have increased to over 150 million by 2015. As a result, there will be a "large-scale evacuation operations circa 2015". Europe will cede to Al Qaeda and "Greater France" will "remorselessly evolve into Greater Bosnia."<ref name="newrepublic_Hari_20070701">{{Cite magazine| issn = 0028-6583| last = Hari| first = Johann| title = Titanic| magazine = The New Republic| access-date = January 20, 2020| date = July 1, 2007| url = https://newrepublic.com/article/64804/titanic |volume= 237 |number= 1}}</ref>{{rp|31}} 
    
Steyn attributes the forecast fall of the Western world to three factors, [[Demography|demographic]] decline, unsustainability of the advanced Western social-democratic state, and exhaustion of civilization. Steyn based his argument of population decline on his own observation that European nations have low birth rates while Muslim nations have higher [[birth rate]]s.<ref name="Coleman_2011">{{cite journal |last1=Coleman |first1=D. |last2=Rowthorn |first2=R. |date=2011 |title=Who's Afraid of Population Decline? A Critical Examination of Its Consequences |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=37 |issue = Suppl 1|pages=217–248 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2011.00385.x|pmid = 21280372}}</ref> Steyn wrote that in the 2000s, the population of the developed world declined from about 30% of world population to around 20%, while the population of Muslim nations increased from about 15% to 20%.<ref name="Steyn_Regnery_2006"/>{{rp|xiv}}

He argued that the advanced Western social-democratic state was unsustainable, based on his observation that the responsibilities of normal adults—such as care of the elderly, childcare, health care and insurance, have been slowly taken over by the state.<ref name="macleans_Steyn_20061020"/><ref name="Steyn_Regnery_2006"/> Steyn argues that these programs erode humanity's basic sense of self-reliance to a point at which a more resilient group of people — Muslims in his view — will take control. He said that civilization is exhausted because Western nations are so focused on moral and [[cultural relativism]]—with "diversity" and "racism" as their new favorite words—that they are unable to see that their existence is threatened. Specifically, he argues that European nations have given up defending themselves and rely on [[United States|America]] for their defense. He views [[anti-Americanism]] as a symptom of civilizational exhaustion, whether manifested by Muslims (to whom America symbolizes [[Gay pornography|gay porn]], children born [[out of wedlock]], immodest women, and immorality) or by Europeans (to whom America symbolises a crude and radical [[Christianity]], fat [[redneck]]s and uncontrolled firearms). However, in his view America is the most benign [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] power the world has ever seen. According to Steyn, America will be the last and only country—as all others will be taken over by Muslims—that will retain its sense of self-preservation, but this is not a given, as America's enemies know that it ran from [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and they hope that America will continue to flee when faced with a challenge.  
    
Steyn's final argument is that the Muslim world will not need to carry out an outright attack. Instead, Europe will collapse from "[[wikt:wimpy|wimpiness]]" or "multicultural 'sensitivity,'" leading to betrayal of the state's core values. Thus, during the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Danish 'cartoon jihad']] of 2006, [[Jack Straw]], then British foreign secretary, hailed the 'sensitivity' of [[Fleet Street]] in not reprinting the offending representations of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]."<ref name="Steyn_Regnery_2006"/>{{rp|xxx}}

In a 2016 post on his personal blog, "Ten Years, and Slightly Less Alone", Steyn wrote that his book ''America Alone'' was still the "biggest story of our time". He said that, "the west's leaders still can't talk about it, not to their own peoples, not honestly....I'm glad I brought up the subject. And it's well past time for others to speak out".<ref name="steynonline_Steyn_20161010">{{Cite news|url=http://www.steynonline.com/7554/ten-years-and-slightly-less-alone|title=Ten Years, and Slightly Less Alone|last=Steyn|first=Mark|work=SteynOnline |date=October 10, 2016 |access-date=January 20, 2020|language=en-US}}</ref>  

Steyn cites [[Robert D. Kaplan]], author of ''The Coming Anarchy'', who has referred to countries and regions where "scarcity, crime, overpopulation, tribalism, and disease are rapidly destroying the social fabric of our planet" as "Indian territory."  Steyn also refers to [[Thomas P. M. Barnett]]'s 2006 book,  ''Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating'', in which he examines potential relations between the United States and Iran, Iraq, and the Middle East, China and North Korea, Latin America and Africa in the post-9/11 world. Steyn says that the "difference between the old Indian territory and the new is this: no one had to worry about the Sioux riding down Fifth Avenue. Today, with a few hundred bucks on his ATM card, the fellow from the badlands can be in the heart of the metropolis within hours. Here’s another difference: in the old days, the white man settled the Indian territory. Now the followers of the badland’s radical imams settle the metropolis. And another difference: technology. In the old days, the Injuns had bows and arrows and the cavalry had rifles. In today’s Indian territory, countries that can’t feed their own people have nuclear weapons."<ref name="macleans_Steyn_20061020"/>   

Steyn dismisses the danger of [[climate change]], ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', and [[nuclear winter]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable sources needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2017}}

==Critical reception==
The ''New Republic'' article said that by 2007, Steyn's ''America Alone'',  had already convinced the readers of the ''[[National Review]]''—which he called "the bible of American conservatism"—of an imminent and inevitable Muslim invasion.<ref name="newrepublic_Hari_20070701"/>

In his 2007 [[City Journal (New York City)|City Journal]]'' review, [[Christopher Hitchens]] praised the book as "an admirably tough-minded book."<ref name="city-journal_Hitchens_2007">{{cite web |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_1_urbanities-steyn.html |title=Facing the Islamist Menace |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 2015-12-23|website=city-journal.org |publisher=[[City Journal (New York City)]] |access-date= |quote=Winter 2007}}</ref> Hitchens said that, "Mark Steyn's book is essentially a challenge to the ''[[wiktionary:bien pensant|bien-pensants]]'' among us: an insistence that we recognize an extraordinary threat and thus the possible need for extraordinary responses. He need not pose as if he were the only one with the courage to think in this way."<ref name="city-journal_Hitchens_2007"/>

The British novelist [[Martin Amis]] also reviewed the book in ''[[The Times]]'' and called Steyn as the "great sayer of the unsayable".<ref name="theguardian_Mishra_20090814">{{Cite news| issn = 0261-3077| last = Mishra| first = Pankaj| title = A culture of fear| work = The Guardian| access-date = January 20, 2020| date = August 14, 2009| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/15/eurabia-islamophobia-europe-colonised-muslims}}</ref> Amis added, "I continue to hope that his admonitions will gain some momentum, despite the efforts of his prose style to impede it."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.steynonline.com/7556/never-mind-the-prose-style|title=Never Mind the Prose Style...|last=Steyn|first=Mark|work=SteynOnline|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Then [[President of the United States]], [[George W.

In a 2007 ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' review by British politician and prominent [[Brexit]] campaigner, [[Michael Gove]], he wrote that the fact that "many of Steyn's conclusions will be unpalatable to the European consensus only underlines how much a failure to face harsh truths has characterised the European response to the scale of the terrorist threat we face."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/13th-january-2007/29/not-what-europe-wants-to-hear|title=Not what Europe wants to hear » 13 Jan 2007 » The Spectator Archive|work=The Spectator Archive|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref>

[[Daniel Johnson (journalist)|Daniel Johnson]] said that Steyn is as "damning as he is persuasive: from demographic suicide to the abdication of self-defence, he conducts a forensic analysis of the hollowing out of the high culture for which the Continent was still respected a generation ago."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/node/4156/full|title=The Mythology of Decline|work=Standpoint|language=en|access-date=2017-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316024930/http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/node/4156/full|archive-date=2017-03-16|url-status=dead}}</ref> 

Canadian newspaper publisher and author, [[Conrad Black]] in his review of Steyn's follow-up book ''After America: Get Ready for Armageddon'' referred to ''America Alone'' as extolling "...America’s heroic status as the chief and only plausible resister to the degeneration of the West and the endless primitive depredations of militant Islam, carried out with the mischievous connivance of a greedy and malevolent China."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Found-wanting-7189|title=Found Wanting|last=Black|first=Conrad|date=October 2011|website=The New Criterion|access-date=}}</ref>

[[Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting]] criticized the book as "inarguably Islamophobic,"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fair.org/extra/making-islamophobia-mainstream/|title=Making Islamophobia Mainstream|date=2008-11-01|work=FAIR|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en-US}}</ref> and author [[Suhayl Saadi]] in the [[The Independent|''Independent'']] referred to it as "hysterical".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-second-plane-by-martin-amis-776567.html | title=The Second Plane by Martin Amis| date=February 2008}}</ref> 

In a March 2013 ''[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]'' journal article, Nasar Meer wrote that the book was, "Remarkably similar to anxieties over western decline in the late 19th century."<ref name="ERS_Meer_20130301">{{Cite journal|last=Meer|first=Nasar|date=2013-03-01|title=Racialization and religion: race, culture and difference in the study of antisemitism and Islamophobia|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies (ERS)|volume=36|issue=3|pages=385–398|doi=10.1080/01419870.2013.734392|issn=0141-9870}}</ref>

== Human rights complaints ==
In December 2007, [[Mohamed Elmasry]] of the [[Canadian Islamic Congress]] (CIC) filed [[Human rights complaints against Maclean's magazine|Human rights complaints against ''Maclean's'' magazine]] with the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission]], the [[British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal]] and the [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]], accusing the magazine of publishing eighteen [[Islamophobia|Islamophobic]] articles between January 2005 and July 2007. The articles in question included a column by [[Mark Steyn]] titled "The future belongs to Islam"—an excerpt from ''America Alone''.<ref name="macleans_Steyn_20061020">{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/the-future-belongs-to-islam/|first=Mark |last=Steyn|title=The future belongs to Islam |magazine=Maclean's|date=October 20, 2006|access-date=January 20, 2020|language=en-US}}</ref> The CIC said that Steyn's column was "flagrantly Islamophobic" and that it subjected [[Canadian Muslims]] to "hatred and contempt".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.newswire.ca/en/story/170609/human-rights-complaints-launched-against-maclean-s-magazine|title=Human Rights Complaints Launched Against Maclean's Magazine (Press release)|last=|first=|publisher=Canadian Islamic Congress. CNW.|website=www.newswire.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-03-15}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The CIC's request for "equal space" to publish a response in ''Macleans'' was refused. 

The CIC also filed a complaint with the [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]]. The [[Ontario Federation of Labour]], with its 700,000 members, put pressure on all relevant parties, including ''Macleans''<nowiki/>' parent company, in support of the CIC complaint. The Ontario Human Rights Commission ruled that it did not have the jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal heard the complaint in June 2008 and issued a ruling on October 10, 2008 dismissing the complaint. The Canadian Human Rights Commission dismissed the federal complaint on June 26, 2008 without referring the matter to a tribunal.

The case has been cited as a motivating factor in the repeal of [[Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act]].

==America Alone==
The title of Steyn's 2007 book echoes that of the best-selling [[Cambridge University Press]] scholarly 2005 publication by American Studies in the Department of Politics and International Studies' director, [[Stefan Halper]], and Daniel Jonathan Clarke, entitled, ''America Alone: The Neo-Conservatives and the Global Order'' which is also set in the context of the [[War on Terror]].<ref name="CUP_Halper_Clarke_AmericaAlone">{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-67460-7| last1 = Halper| first1 = Stefan| last2 = Clarke| first2 = Jonathan| title = America Alone: The Neo-Conservatives and the Global Order| date = September 5, 2005}}</ref> Halper and Clarke trace the early rise to prominence and influence of a small group of "radical intellectuals"—the [[neoconservative]]s. The authors described how the neoconservatives succeeded in changing the global order by gaining control over American national security policy during the War on Terror. They persuaded then-President George W. Bush to abandon the bi-partisan diplomatic approach that had been used successfully against the Soviet threat since the 1950s, and to replace the consensus-driven approach with a [[neo-conservative]] foreign policy that promoted military confrontation and 'nation-building'.<ref name="CUP_Halper_Clarke_AmericaAlone"/>
