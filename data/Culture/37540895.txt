[[Human height|Height]] can significantly influence success in sports, depending on how the design of the sport is linked to factors that are height-biased due to physics and biology. The balance of the intricate array of links will determine the degree to which height plays a role in success, if any.

==Amateur wrestling==
Height can be both helpful and detrimental in wrestling. Since taller people have more bone mass, they will generally be slightly weaker than shorter people in the same weight class. This difference is made up in part by their longer arms, which allow them a longer reach and easier cradle. Long legs are detrimental in that they can easily be attacked by a lolly ([[Takedown (grappling)|shot]]). They do, however, assist in performing some actions and positions such as throwing, sprawling to counter a takedown or riding legs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The heights of amateur wrestlers vary greatly with successful athletes being as short as [[Sushil Kumar (wrestler)|Sushil Kumar]] at {{height|m=1.66}} and as tall as [[Alexander Karelin]] at {{height|m=1.91}}.

==Artistic gymnastics==
In [[artistic gymnastics]], it is advantageous to be shorter. A lower [[center of gravity]] can give an athlete better balance. A smaller athlete may also have an easier time manipulating their body in the air.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Football==
In [[association football]], or soccer, a player's height may somewhat determine the position that they play; however, people of all heights have an equal opportunity to excel professionally at the sport. Goalkeepers, centre backs and "target" heading forwards tend to be taller, while players in wide and attacking positions tend to be shorter. A study of the greatest male players in history showed that the distribution of heights approximated the average man and, when also looking at the typical weight distribution, an estimated 95% of the world's population would fall into the body type distribution of great footballers. A sample of reasonably select players from ages 11–18 in the United States tended to approximate the height distribution of the population.<ref>{{cite book|title= Principles of manual sports medicine |last= Karageanes|first= Steven J. |year=2005 |publisher=Limpincott Williams & Wilkins|location=USA |isbn= 0-8493-9197-0|page= 593|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7QVl60BQkRoC&q=%22both+short+and+tall+people%22&pg=PA593|accessdate=2010-07-08}}{{Cite book|title= The Global Art of Soccer|last= Witzig|first= Richard|year=2006 |publisher=CusiBoy Publishing |location=USA |isbn= 0-9776688-0-0|page= 500|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&q=%22body+types+in+soccer%22&pg=PA25|accessdate=2010-07-08}}{{Cite book|title= Physique, fitness, and performance |last= Battinelli|first= Thomas|year=2007 |publisher=Taylor & Francis Group LLC|location=USA |isbn= 978-0-8493-9197-2|page= 27|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6sQbvYluLqYC&q=soccer+participants+were+small+and+stout&pg=PA27|accessdate=2010-07-08}}{{Cite book|title= Science and Soccer|last1= Williams|first1= Mark|year=2003 |publisher=Routledge|location=USA |isbn= 0-415-26231-3|pages= 24, 303|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zUJEnSmj8SoC&q=Science+and+soccer+By+Thomas+Reilly,+A.+Mark+Williams&pg=PA1|accessdate=2010-07-08}}</ref> However, there is an overwhelming tendency for the 11-most picked players in a squad to be shorter than their teammates, which could suggest a bias in the scouting system.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/jan/26/european-football-survey | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jonathan | last=Wilson | title=Footballing trends in Europe: the long and the short of it – Jonathan Wilson | date=26 January 2011}}</ref>

For wide and attacking positions, the players are generally relatively shorter. Many of the world class players have been shorter than average and in many cases gained an advantage from their low centre of gravity. Examples include [[Lorenzo Insigne]], [[Ryan Fraser]], [[Sebastian Giovinco]] {{height|m=1.63}}, [[Bernard (footballer)|Bernard]], [[Ludovic Giuly]] {{height|m=1.64}}, [[Aaron Lennon]], [[Diego Maradona]], [[Marco Verratti]], [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]] {{height|m=1.65}}, [[Thomas Häßler]] {{height|m=1.66}}, [[Mathieu Valbuena]], [[Romário]] {{height|m=1.67}}, [[N'Golo Kanté]], [[Roberto Carlos]], [[Santi Cazorla]] {{height|m=1.68}}, [[Alexis Sánchez]], [[Garrincha]], [[Pedro (footballer, born July 1987)|Pedro]] {{height|m=1.69}}, [[David Silva]], [[Franck Ribéry]], [[Lionel Messi]], [[Paul Scholes]], [[Philipp Lahm]], [[Xavi]] {{height|m=1.70}}, [[Andrés Iniesta]] {{height|m=1.71}}, [[Dani Alves]], [[Luka Modrić]], [[Philippe Coutinho]], [[Robinho]], [[Sergio Agüero]], [[Zico (footballer)|Zico]] {{height|m=1.72}}, [[Eden Hazard]], [[Michael Owen]], [[Bobby Charlton]] and [[Pelé]] {{height|m=1.73}}. However, height is considered advantageous for forwards who aim to score with their heads. Forwards who are particularly noted for their strength in the air include [[Lacina Traoré]] {{height|m=2.03}}, [[Jan Koller]], [[Nikola Žigić]] {{height|m=2.02}} and [[Peter Crouch]] {{height|m=2.01}}. Many of the world's best forwards and midfielders are taller than average, while still possessing a high all round level of technical ability, such as  [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] {{height|m=1.95}}, [[Nemanja Matić]] {{height|m=1.94}}, [[Luca Toni]], [[Patrick Vieira]] {{height|m=1.93}}, [[Sócrates]] {{height|m=1.92}}, [[Paul Pogba]] {{height|m=1.91}}, [[Frank Rijkaard]], [[Romelu Lukaku]] {{height|m=1.90}}, [[Sergio Busquets]], [[Yaya Touré]] {{height|m=1.89}}, [[Didier Drogba]], [[Eric Cantona]], [[Harry Kane]], [[Marco van Basten]], [[Michael Ballack]], [[Ruud Gullit]], [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]], [[Thierry Henry]] {{height|m=1.88}}, [[Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]], [[Rivaldo]] {{height|m=1.87}}, [[Fernando Torres]] and [[Kaká]] {{height|m=1.86}}. Players like [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Gareth Bale]], [[Robert Lewandowski]] and [[Zinedine Zidane]] {{height|m=1.85}}, with their height being seen as an advantage for their heading and physical ability, adding to their completeness, are desired for modern top-level forward and midfielder positions.

Height is often an advantage for [[defender (football)|central defenders]], who are assigned to stop forwards from scoring through the air, as exemplified by players like [[Matej Bagarić]] {{height|m=2.02}}, [[Per Mertesacker]] {{height|m=2.00}}, [[Brede Hangeland]], [[Jannik Vestergaard]]  {{height|m=1.99}}, [[Naldo (footballer, born 1982)|Naldo]] {{height|m=1.98}}, [[Daniel Van Buyten]] {{height|m=1.97}}, [[Sebastián Coates]] {{height|m=1.96}}, [[Joël Matip]] {{height|m=1.95}}, [[Christoph Metzelder]], [[Gerard Piqué]] {{height|m=1.94}}, [[Marco Materazzi]], [[Sami Hyypiä]], [[Virgil van Dijk]] {{height|m=1.93}}, [[Jérôme Boateng]], [[Laurent Blanc]], [[Mats Hummels]] {{height|m=1.92}}, [[Raphaël Varane]], [[Tony Adams]] {{height|m=1.91}}, [[Jaap Stam]], [[Leonardo Bonucci]], [[Nemanja Vidić]] and [[Vincent Kompany]] {{height|m=1.90}}. There are, however, central defenders who are not of above-average height, such as [[Héctor Chumpitaz]] {{Height|m=1.68}}, [[Daniel Passarella]], [[Iván Córdoba]] {{height|m=1.73}}, [[Javier Mascherano]] {{height |m=1.74}}, [[Fabio Cannavaro]], [[Franco Baresi]] {{height|m=1.76}}, [[Roberto Ayala]] {{height|m=1.77}}, [[Carles Puyol]] and [[Gaetano Scirea]] {{height|m=1.78}}.

[[Goalkeeper (football)|Goalkeepers]] tend to be taller than average because their greater arm spans and total reach when jumping enable them to cover more of the goal area. Examples of particularly tall goalkeepers include [[Simon Bloch Jorgensen]] {{height|m=2.10}}, [[Kristof Van Hout]] {{height|m=2.08}}, [[Vanja Iveša]] {{height|m=2.05}}, [[Jason Mooney (Northern Irish footballer)|Jason Mooney]] {{height|m=2.04}}, [[Costel Pantilimon]] {{height|m=2.03}}, [[Zeljko Kalac]] {{height|m=2.02}}, [[Fraser Forster]], [[Goran Blažević]], {{height|m=2.01}}, [[Andreas Isaksson]] {{height|m=2.00}}, [[Asmir Begović]], [[Thibaut Courtois]] {{height |m=1.99}}, [[Maarten Stekelenburg]] {{height |m=1.98}}, [[Edwin van der Sar]] {{height|m=1.97}}, [[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]], [[Diego López Rodríguez|Diego López]], [[Joe Hart]], [[Petr Čech]] {{height|m=1.96}}, [[Vladimir Stojković]] and [[Wojciech Szczęsny]] {{height |m=1.95}}. In addition, there are examples of successful goalkeepers who are not significantly taller than average, such as [[Jorge Campos]] {{height|m=1.68}}, [[František Plánička]], [[Óscar Pérez Rojas|Óscar Pérez]] {{height|m=1.72}}, [[René Higuita]] {{height|m=1.76}}, [[Gyula Grosics]] {{height|m=1.78}} and [[Ladislao Mazurkiewicz]] {{height|m=1.79}}.

==Australian rules football==
[[Image:Spectacular mark by Irish player against South Africa.jpg|thumb|right|Height helps Australian rules footballers to gain "free kicks" from [[Mark (Australian football)|marking]] contests, perform [[Ruckman (Australian rules football)|ruckwork]], as well as key [[One percenter (Australian rules football)|attacking and defensive maneuvers]].  Pictured is Irish international [[Mike Finn]] ({{height|m=2.00}}) taking a contested mark.]]

In [[Australian rules football|Australian rules]], a footballer's height is considered an advantage.  This is evidenced by statistics and trends from the professional ([[Australian Football League]]) level, including an average player height of {{height|m=1.88}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2009/02/25/1235237738878.html|title=The AFL and the lore of averages|website=Theage.com.au|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref> as well as an ongoing trend in the recruitment of tall athletes from other sports, particularly basketball such as [[Dean Brogan]] at {{height|m=2.01}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-04-15/emulating-eric|title=Second USA Combine begins|work=afl.com.au|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/swans-sign-us-basketballer-alex-starling/story-e6frf9jf-1226253617207 |title=Swans sign US basketballer Alex Starling |website=Heraldsun.com.au |accessdate=2016-05-28}}</ref><ref name="punt">{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/rfnews/port-signs-basketball-star/2009/10/21/1255891860737.html|title=Port takes a punt on basketball star|website=Thewage.com.au|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref> and rugby football such as [[Mike Pyke]] at {{height|m=2.00}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/afl/more-news/swans-give-canadian-mike-pyke-two-more-years/story-e6frf9jf-1225901020388 |title=Swans give Canadian Mike Pyke two more years |first=Al |last=Paton |newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] |date=4 August 2010 |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref>

In the sport, players frequently compete for possession of the ball above the shoulders.  Players gain "free kick"s from a [[Mark (Australian football)|marking]], that is, catching the ball in the air from a kick.  As such, height combined with a [[Vertical jump|vertical leap]] ability are advantageous attributes.  Long arms assist in marking and ruckwork and defensive spoiling and long legs add leverage for long distance kicking - all key components of the sport.

Each Australian rules football team has at least one [[Ruckman (Australian rules football position)|ruckman]], a specialist position requiring height and leap. These player contest first possession of the ball or "hit out" after each goal or when the ball bounces out of the playing arena. At professional AFL level, the average height of ruckmen is over {{height|m=2.00}} tall.<ref>Maine, Jim. "Aussie Rules For Dummies". pg 20</ref> In addition, "key position" players also gain significant advantage in height.  Attacking key positions such as [[centre half-forward]], such as [[Lance Franklin]] at {{height|m=1.99}} and [[full-forward]] such as [[Tom Hawkins (footballer, born 1988)|Tom Hawkins]] at {{height|m=1.98}} gain an advantage by being taller than their opponent [[centre half-back]] such as [[Heritier Lumumba]] at {{height|m=1.88}} and [[full-back (Australian rules football)|full-back]] such as [[Mal Michael]] at {{height|m=1.90}} and vice versa.

Shorter players may have an advantage in the "crumbing" role of retrieving the ball from the ground or utilising pace to evade opponents.  However taller players may also have these abilities and as such versatile talls are often favoured by professional recruiters (such as in the [[AFL Draft]]).<ref>Hanlon, Peter.

==Baseball==
The average height for a baseball player is {{height|ft=6|in=1+1/2}} tall.<ref>http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2011/4/19/2114631/the-changing-size-of-mlb-players-1870-2010</ref> In baseball, being taller usually means longer legs, which power pitchers use to generate velocity and a release point closer to the plate, which means the ball reaches the batter more quickly. The ball also comes from a higher release angle opposed to a shorter pitcher. While taller position players have a larger strike zone, most position players are at least of average height because the larger frame allows them to generate more power.

A smaller player, however, will have a smaller strike zone; the White Sox once tried a pinch-hitter, [[Eddie Gaedel]], who stood three-foot-seven and drew a walk in his only plate appearance.  However, the commissioner banned him as "making a mockery of the game".

==Basketball==
Taller players are often thought to have an advantage in [[basketball]] because their shots have less distance to travel to the basket, they start closer to the [[Rebound (basketball)|rebound]], and their ability to reach higher into the air yields a better chance of blocking shorter players' shots.<ref name="idiots">''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Basketball'', p. 111, Walt Frazier and Alex Sachare, 1998. {{ISBN|0-02-862679-6}}.</ref>

Empirically, the over-representation of extremely tall athletes in basketball lends credence to the theory that the sport provides tall players with a very significant advantage. The average American male is {{height|ft=5|in=9.3}}.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111017192844/http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0209.pdf]</ref> Yet, in a 2007-08 player survey, the average player in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is listed at {{height|ft=6|in=7}} in shoes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/survey_height_2007.html|title=NBA.com - 2007-08 Player Survey: Height|website=Nba.com|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref> However, from the 2019-20 season onward, NBA teams are required to provide accurate height measurements without shoes. This resulted in a near universal downwards correction of heights among players.<ref name="height">https://lastwordonprobasketball.com/2019/10/07/nba-player-height-updates/</ref><ref>https://crownhoops.com/2019/10/08/complete-list-of-nba-player-height-changes-and-updates/</ref> 

Players sometimes inflate their height. Prospects may exaggerate their height while in high school or college to make themselves more appealing to coaches and scouts, who prefer taller players. Barkley stated, “I’ve been measured at 6-5, 6-4 ¾. But I started in college at 6-6.” Sportswriter [[Sam Smith (sportswriter)|Sam Smith]] said: “We sort of know the heights, because after camp, the sheet comes out. But you use that height, and the player gets mad. And then you hear from his agent. Or you file your story with the right height, and the copy desk changes it because they have the ‘official’ N.B.A. media guide, which is wrong. So you sort of go along with the joke.”<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/sports/basketball/22score.html</ref> 

Players sometimes understate their actual heights to avoid being moved to a different position. One example is [[Kevin Durant]], who's listed at {{height|ft=6|in=9}}, while he stated his actual height is {{height|ft=7|in=0}}. Durant's reasoning was, “Really, that's the prototypical size for a [[small forward]]. Anything taller than that, and they'll start saying, ‘Ah, he's a [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]].”<ref>https://www.sbnation.com/2017/6/12/15773612/how-tall-kevin-durant-height-warriors</ref> In 2019, the [[Brooklyn Nets]] measured Durant at {{height|ft=6|in=9.5}} barefoot. As a result, he is currently listed at {{height|ft=6|in=10}}.<ref>https://www.si.com/nba/2019/10/18/kevin-durant-height</ref><ref>https://www.nba.com/players/kevin/durant/201142</ref>

Until the 2019–20 season,<ref name="height"></ref> the NBA did not have a standard regarding whether players were measured with or without shoes. The [[NBA Draft Combine]], which most players attend before the draft, provided both measurements. Thereafter, a player's team was solely responsible for their listed height, which varied depending on the process selected.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sherwood Strauss |first=Ethan |title=Kevin Love and height liars in shoes |date=December 29, 2011 |work=ESPN.com |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/34789/kevin-love-and-height-liars-in-shoes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WFLbovDi?url=http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/34789/kevin-love-and-height-liars-in-shoes |archivedate=February 10, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Goffinet |first=Larry |title=Shoes shouldn't count in measuring height |date=January 25, 2015 |newspaper=Perry County News |url=http://www.perrycountynews.com/content/shoes-shouldn’t-count-measuring-height |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WFLlHWb8?url=http://www.perrycountynews.com/content/shoes-shouldn%E2%80%99t-count-measuring-height |archivedate=February 10, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The NBA instituted a new measuring standard starting with the 2019–20 season, measuring players without shoes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stein|first=Marc|title=N.B.A. Will Get to the Bottom of How Tall Its Players Are|date=September 26, 2019|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/sports/basketball/nba-height-age.html|accessdate=August 18, 2020}}</ref> Due to this change, the height of numerous players declined, from one to three inches, while others grew. Players who had their listed heights revised downwards include, [[Dwight Howard]], [[Bradley Beal]], [[J.J. Barea]], [[Kemba Walker]] and numerous others.<ref>{{cite news|last=Curtis|first=Charles|title=A running list of notable NBA players who grew and shrank thanks to new, official measurements|date=October 7, 2019|newspaper=USA Today|url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/10/nba-heights-new-official-durant-zion|accessdate=August 18, 2020}}</ref>

==Bodybuilding==
In [[bodybuilding]] competitors are generally average height or below. Thus, heights above {{height|ft=6|in=0}} are the exception. In bodybuilding height is often considered a disadvantage due to the fact that smaller bodies have a shorter range of motion in order to lift weights. Smaller bodies also tend to look more filled out compared to taller builds in the same weight class. However, taller people at the professional level tend to have the larger overall body mass. Notable bodybuilders, who have held many titles, are [[Franco Columbu]] {{height|ft=5|in=5}}, [[Phil Heath]] {{height|ft=5|in=9}}, [[Jay Cutler (bodybuilder)|Jay Cutler]] {{height|ft=5|in=10}}, [[Ronnie Coleman]] {{height|ft=5|in=11}} and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] {{height|ft=6|in=2}}.

==Cricket==
In [[cricket]], some of the great batsmen like [[Donald Bradman]] {{height|m=1.73}}, [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and [[Sunil Gavaskar]] both {{height|m=1.65}} are or were below average height. This may be because a smaller body makes for an advantage in footwork and balance. Similarly, the most graceful [[wicketkeeper|wicket-keepers]] have tended to be average height or below. Although there are fewer tall batsmen, the stand-outs are often noted for their heavy hitting and an ability to get a long stride forward to reach a full length delivery. Australia's [[Matthew Hayden]] at {{height|m=1.86}},  West Indies' [[Chris Gayle]] at {{height|m=1.91}} and England's [[Kevin Pietersen]] at {{height|m=1.93}} are modern examples of powerful, tall batsman. Past greats like [[Clive Lloyd]] and [[Graeme Pollock]] were well above {{height|m=1.83}}.

On the other hand, many of the most successful [[fast bowlers]] have been well above average height; for example past greats [[Curtly Ambrose]], [[Courtney Walsh]] and [[Joel Garner]] were all over {{height|m=1.97}} tall. [[Glenn McGrath]] regarded as one of the finest bowlers to play the game, was {{height|m=1.96}} tall. Examples of bowlers well above average in height are [[Javagal Srinath]] and [[Wasim Akram]] who measured {{height|m=1.88}} and {{height|m=1.91}}. Taller bowlers have access to a higher point of release, making it easier for them to make the ball bounce uncomfortably for a batsman. For extreme pace however, bowlers tend to be around {{height|m=1.80}} such as [[Dale Steyn]], [[Malcolm Marshall]] and [[Shoaib Akhtar]] thus combining advantage of shorter lever arms for pace generation with good ball release height. Since round arm bowling does not gain much advantage from taller release height, round arm bowlers tend to be shorter such as the classic [[Lasith Malinga]] at {{height|m=1.73}}. The fastest modern bowlers have ranged from [[Fidel Edwards]] {{height|m=1.73}} through to [[Brett Lee]] at {{height|m=1.87}}.

Height does not appear to be an advantage to spin bowling and few international spinners are ever much taller than {{height|m=1.80}}. Tall spin bowlers like [[Sulieman Benn]] {{height|m=2.01}} use extra pace and bounce, whereas spin is traditionally about using a looping, plunging trajectory at slow ({{convert|70|-|90|km/h|sigfig=1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) speeds. The most successful bowlers ever in Test cricket, [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] and [[Shane Warne]] are {{height|m=1.70}} and {{height|m=1.83}} respectively.
For extracting steep bounce height is useful for fast bowlers like [[Steven Finn (cricketer)|Steven Finn]] {{height|m=1.98}} and [[Boyd Rankin]] {{height|m=2.03}}.

==Cycling==
Road racing cyclists can be of all heights but their height generally determines what role they choose. Taller cyclists tend to excel at the [[cobbled classics]], as pure power helps get over the difficult and brutal cobblestones. Cyclists over {{height|m=1.90}} often understand the difficulties in hilly races, and realise their talents in cobbled classics from an early age and focus on them for their careers. This includes [[Johan Vansummeren]], [[Taylor Phinney]] both {{height|m=1.97}} and [[Magnus Bäckstedt]] {{height|m=1.93}}. In recent years [[Paris–Roubaix]] has been dominated by [[Tom Boonen]] {{height|m=1.92}} and [[Fabian Cancellara]] {{height|m=1.86}}.

Smaller cyclists on the other hand dominate mountain stages of Grand Tours. Their lack of body mass helps as it means they have less weight to carry up the steep inclines. [[José Rujano]] {{height|m=1.62}}, [[Domenico Pozzovivo]] {{height|m=1.65}}, [[Nairo Quintana]] {{height|m=1.67}}, [[Joaquim Rodríguez]] {{height|m=1.69}}, [[Gilberto Simoni]] {{height|m=1.70}}, [[Marco Pantani]] and [[Simon Yates (cyclist)|Simon Yates]] both {{height|m=1.72}} are examples of pure climbers.

However none of the above-mentioned small climbers are known for their [[Individual time trial|time trialing]] abilities, and in this slightly taller climbers, known as all rounders often gain the advantage in grand tours. [[Cadel Evans]] {{height|m=1.74}}, [[Alberto Contador]] {{height|m=1.76}}, [[Lance Armstrong]] {{height|m=1.77}} and [[Denis Menchov]] {{height|m=1.80}} have all won long Time trial stages in many races. [[Alejandro Valverde]] {{height|m=1.78}}, [[Samuel Sánchez]] and [[Vincenzo Nibali]] both {{height|m=1.81}} are, on top of their climbing and time trialing abilities, 3 of the world's best descenders.

In recent years taller cyclists with low builds have become among the world's best climbers, particularly on long gradual climbs. The best examples of this are [[Ivan Basso]] {{height|m=1.82}} who won on the [[Monte Zoncolan]] in 2010, [[Chris Froome]] {{height|m=1.86}} 4-times winner of the Tour de France and the brothers [[Andy Schleck|Andy]] & [[Fränk Schleck]] both {{height|m=1.86}} who specialise on the Alpine stages of the Tour de France. Further [[Mauricio Soler]] {{height|m=1.90}} could win the 2007 Tour de France Mountains classification, at the same height [[Bradley Wiggins]] achieved a Tour de France overall victory in 2012.

While there are exceptions to these rules, taller climbers do feature more in cobbled races and smaller riders in mountain stages. But where cycling does become indiscriminate height wise, is in sprinting. Sprints have been contested between [[Robbie McEwen]] {{height|m=1.71}} and [[Mario Cipollini]] {{height|m=1.89}}, or [[Mark Cavendish]] {{height|m=1.75}} and [[André Greipel]] {{height|m=1.84}}, or as the 2010 [[Milan–San Remo]] between [[Óscar Freire]] {{height|m=1.71}} and [[Tom Boonen]] {{height|m=1.92}}.

==Fencing==
In [[fencing]], it is generally advantageous (especially in épée) to be taller because a longer arm span allows one's weapon to reach one's opponent's body from a further distance as well as in some instances being easier to make more angulated attacks.

However, there are some advantages a being a shorter fencer. Shorter fencers generally have less target area to defend. Furthermore, it has been noted that if footwork abilities are equal, a smaller fencer finds it easier to co-ordinate their footwork when moving in and out of distance than taller opponents due to their lower center of balance. In certain instances they may have a slight advantage when infighting as they can retract and replace their weapon point with more ease.

A good example of such a fencer is [[Valentina Vezzali]] {{height|m=1.64}} who used her small size and lower centre of gravity to confound taller opponents.

Other shorter than average male fencers who have competed at the highest levels and won significant competitions include: [[Heo_Jun_(fencer)|Heo Jun]] 5ft 6inch, [[Erwann Le Péchoux]] 5ft 7inch, and [[Yuki_Ota|Yuki Ota]] 5ft7.inch"

Differences in height can also be mitigated in sabre or foil, because those weapons have Right of Way rules.
Hitting first does not necessarily result in scoring, as a riposte may take precedence.

It is in épée where height poses a more distinct advantage: though the entire body is a target, and the closest point of the body (the hand) is always a sword's distance away regardless of the fencers height, replacing the point in any (remise) actions generally leads to the taller person reaching the body first.   {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Formula 1==
The average driver height is around {{height|m=1.75}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. 20 of the 21 F1 seasons in the 21st century have been won by competitors shorter than {{height|m=1.80}}, including [[Fernando Alonso]] {{height|m=1.71}}, [[Lewis Hamilton]], [[Michael Schumacher]] both {{height|m=1.74}}, [[Kimi Räikkönen]], [[Sebastian Vettel]] both {{height|m=1.75}} and [[Nico Rosberg]] {{height|m=1.78}}, with the exception of [[Jenson Button]] {{height|m=1.82}}.

As F1 has strict size regulations for cars, designing cars for shorter drivers is easier. Shorter drivers also tend to be lighter which is seen as an advantage. This advantage has changed from season to season as [[FIA]] has altered the rules for minimum weight of the cars.

==American Football==
A 2014 CNN survey reported the average NFL player was {{height|ft=6|in=2}} and weighed {{convert|216|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Knight|first1=Matt|title=Rise of the supersize rugby player|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/27/sport/rugby-sporting-physique-compared/index.html?hpt=hp_c3|accessdate=5 March 2017|publisher=CNN|date=May 29, 2014}}</ref>

In [[American Football|American]] and [[Canadian Football]], a tall [[quarterback]] is at an advantage because it is easier for him to see over the heads of large offensive and defensive linemen while he is in the pocket in a passing situation. At {{Height|ft=5|in=9}}, [[Doug Flutie]] was initially considered to be too short to become an NFL quarterback despite his [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning success at the college level. In addition, shorter quarterbacks have an advantage with their lower center of gravity and balance, which means they are better able to duck under a tackle and avoid a sack. According to the former [[Washington Football Team]] quarterback Eddie LeBaron, being shorter means you can throw the ball higher instead of a sidearm release, meaning it is harder for the defense to knock it down. Shorter quarterbacks also generally have a quicker release time than taller quarterbacks.

Tall [[wide receivers]] have an advantage of being able to reach considerably higher than shorter defensive backs to catch highly thrown passes. Of course, this advantage has limits because exceedingly tall receivers are normally not as agile or lack overall speed or strength. Tight ends are usually over {{height|ft=6|in=4}} because they need greater body mass to be effective blockers and greater height is an advantage for them as receivers, since they run shorter routes based less on speed. By contrast, shorter defensive backs are utilized because of their typically greater agility, as the ability to change directions instantly is a prerequisite for the position.

Offensive and defensive linemen tend to be at least {{height|ft=6|in=1}} and are frequently as tall as {{height|ft=6|in=8}} to be massive enough to effectively play their positions. Height is especially an advantage for defensive linemen, giving them the ability to knock down passes with their outstretched arms.

Short running backs are at an advantage because their shorter stature and lower center of gravity generally makes them harder to tackle effectively. In addition, they can easily "hide" behind large offensive linemen, making it harder for defenders to react at the beginning of a play. Thus, in the [[National Football League]] and in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] Division I football, running backs under {{height|ft=6|in=0}} are more common than running backs over {{height|ft=6|in=3}}. Former Heisman Trophy winner and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]r [[Barry Sanders]], thought by some to be the greatest running back in history, is a classic example of a running back with an extraordinarily low center of gravity, as he stood only {{height|ft=5|in=8}}.

==Horse racing==
In [[horse racing]], it is a considerable advantage for a [[jockey]] to be both short and light. Having a jockey who is of short stature and light weight makes it easier for the horse to run at top speed without being weighed down. At the [[Kentucky Derby]], for example, a jockey cannot exceed 126 pounds, including his equipment.<ref name='kd'>

==Ice hockey==
While the history of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) is filled with shorter players who achieved greatness ([[Theoren Fleury]], [[Martin St. Louis]]), and the highest scorer in NHL history, [[Wayne Gretzky]], is {{height|ft=6|in=0}} tall and played at {{convert|185|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, the physicality of the game has often put a premium on imposing players, particularly over {{convert|1.80|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall and over {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} ([[Chris Pronger]], [[Eric Lindros]], [[Mario Lemieux]]). Taller, bigger players have a longer reach, are able to engage in more aggressive body checking, and have greater leverage for shooting, particularly on a slap shot{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} (examples include [[Tyler Myers]] at {{height|ft=6|in=8}}, and [[Eric Staal]], [[Joe Thornton]], [[Rick Nash]], and [[Ryan Getzlaf]], all at {{height|ft=6|in=4}}.  Since the 2004-2005 lockout, rule changes in the NHL<ref>https://www.nhl.com/mapleleafs/news/nhl-enacts-rule-changes-creates-competition-committee/c-460134</ref> have caused a trend towards more agile styles of play, allowing smaller players ([[Patrick Kane]], [[Johnny Gaudreau]], [[Tyler Johnson (ice hockey)|Tyler Johnson]]) to use their agility and puck skills to thrive.  This has resulted in greater diversity of player heights despite the league maintaining a generally constant average height, while the average player weight has generally decreased.<ref>https://hockey-graphs.com/2015/02/19/nhl-player-size-from-1917-18-to-2014-15-a-brief-look/</ref>  The average height of an NHL player is just over {{height|ft=6|in=1}} tall. [[Zdeno Chára]], at {{height|ft=6|in=9}}, is the tallest player ever to play in the NHL. In recent years, the height of goaltenders has increased as taller goaltenders can cover a larger portion of the goal when on their knees in the [[Butterfly style|butterfly]] goaltending style. [[Ben Bishop]] at {{height|ft=6|in=7}} is the tallest goaltender currently in the NHL.

==Judo==
In [[judo]], height can work both ways. The shorter person tends to have an advantage (both offensively and defensively) in hip throws, dropping techniques i.e. drop seoi nage and wrestling style pickups such as ura nage. A low [[center of gravity]] allows better position for these throws. Taller players have an advantage in sweeps because they can often use these maneuvers before getting in range of the shorter person's [[kuzushi]].  They can also use their long legs to their advantage with many ashi waza techniques and throws with a significance on legs such as uchi mata and harai goshi.  In ne waza (groundwork) having shorter limbs makes it more difficult to be submitted but also more difficult to use your legs to escape from hold downs.  In contrast being taller can help with escaping hold downs and certain submissions i.e. sangaku jime.  The 2013 judo rules somewhat shift or even out the advantages that shorter fighters had by no longer allowing leg grabs and no longer being allowed to prevent your opponent from taking grips.

==Mixed martial arts==
In [[mixed martial arts]], taller fighters have a distinct advantage in striking, because of their increased range. Shorter fighters on the other hand, tend to be stronger than taller opponents of equal weight and tend to pack a heavier punch. Shorter fighters often have the advantage while grappling defensively.  Their lower centre of gravity makes it difficult to take them down and their shorter limbs make it harder to submit them.  This however works both ways with smaller fighters sometimes struggling from certain positions i.e. the guard. While height is still regarded as an overall advantage, there have been many great fighters who are shorter than average such as [[Frankie Edgar]] or [[José Aldo]]. [[Fedor Emilianenko]], once widely regarded as the greatest heavyweight fighter in the world{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, stands no more than {{height|ft=6|in=0}} and has defeated opponents mostly taller than him, including most imposing [[Choi Hong-man|Hong-man Choi]], who stands tall at {{height|ft=7|in=2}}

==Rowing==
In [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], height is advantageous, because the taller a rower is, the longer his or her stroke can potentially be, thus moving the boat more effectively. The average male Olympic rower is {{height|m=1.92}}, and the average female Olympic rower is {{height|m=1.73}},<ref name="Physiology of the Elite Rower">{{cite web|url=http://home.hia.no/~stephens/rowphys.htm |title=Physiology of the Elite Rower |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414202424/http://home.hia.no/~stephens/rowphys.htm |archivedate=April 14, 2009 }}{{Self-published inline|date=December 2009}}</ref> well over the average height.

However, for the coxswain of the boat, it is advantageous to be shorter since having a lower body mass would contribute to a faster time for the overall crew. Most of the successful Olympic and Paralympic coxswains ([[Katelin Guregian]], [[Phelan Hill]]) are shorter in stature and lighter in mass hitting close to the international minimum at 55&nbsp;kg for both men and women's crews (Both genders have adopted 55&nbsp;kg by an amendment by FISA to make coxswains gender-neutral on the international level. Previously, coxswains for women's teams had a 45&nbsp;kg weight minimum).

==Rugby==

=== Rugby league===
Height is not generally seen as an important attribute in [[rugby league]] football, often with extreme height being a hindrance rather than  useful.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Gabbett T, Kelly J, Pezet T |title=Relationship between physical fitness and playing ability in rugby league players |journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=1126–33 |date=November 2007 |pmid=18076242 |doi=10.1519/R-20936.1|s2cid=20227110 }}</ref> However, recent tactics of cross-field kicking have resulted in the success of taller outside backs.

A survey of 121 senior player for the Australian Newcastle Knights team, in 2006, found the average player was 182.1&nbsp;cm (range 169.0 - 198.0&nbsp;cm), with an average mass of 93.0&nbsp;kg (range: 73.0 - 127.0&nbsp;kg)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Lee|title=Anthropometric and physical characteristics of rugby league players by grade and position [manuscript] / Lee Clark|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/34958386?selectedversion=NBD42318122|website=trove.nla.gov.au|publisher=University of Newcastle (N.S.W.).

Fullbacks and halfbacks such as [[Andrew Johns]] {{height|m=1.79}}, [[Billy Slater]] {{height|m=1.78}}, [[Brett Hodgson]] {{height|m=1.75}}, [[Cooper Cronk]] {{height|m=1.78}}, [[Darren Lockyer]] {{height|m=1.78}}, [[Hazem El Masri]] {{height|m=1.78}}, [[Johnathan Thurston]] {{height|m=1.79}}, [[Kurt Gidley]] {{height|m=1.78}}, [[Rhys Wesser]] {{height|m=1.75}} and [[Scott Prince]] {{height|m=1.77}} are usually average height due to their speed and agility.

[[Greg Inglis]] {{height|m=1.95}}, [[Israel Folau]] {{height|m=1.94}}, [[Shaun Kenny-Dowall]] {{height|m=1.94}}, [[Mark Gasnier]] {{Height |m=1.93}}, [[Jarryd Hayne]] {{height|m=1.90}}, [[Colin Best]] {{Height |m=1.89}}, [[Manu Vatuvei]] {{Height |m=1.89}}, [[Krisnan Inu]] {{height|m=1.85}} and [[Jason Nightingale]] {{height|m=1.83}} are examples of the trend in taller wingers and centres.

=== Rugby union ===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Lineout Throw.jpg|thumb|Locks are tall and typically the target of a rugby lineout.]] -->
In [[rugby union]], lineout jumpers, generally [[Lock (rugby union)|locks]], are usually the tallest players, as this increases their chance of winning the ball, whereas [[Scrum-half (rugby union)|scrum-halves]] are usually nearer the average. As examples, current world-class locks [[Chris Jack]], [[Paul O'Connell]], [[Richie Gray (rugby union, born 1989)|Richie Gray]] and [[Victor Matfield]] are all at least {{height|m=1.98}}, while  [[George Gregan]], who has 139 international appearances with Australia, is {{height|m=1.73}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby.com.au/players/wallabies/2007_squad/2007_rwc_squad/gregan_george,62575.html |title=George Gregan |publisher=rugby.com.au |date=1973-04-19 |accessdate=2011-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606231720/http://www.rugby.com.au/players/wallabies/2007_squad/2007_rwc_squad/gregan_george%2C62575.html |archivedate=June 6, 2011 }}</ref>

==Sailing==
When [[sailing]] small [[Dinghy sailing|dinghies]] (rather than keelboats), the crew [[Hiking (sailing)|hiking]] or [[Trapeze (sailing)|trapezing]] - essentially hanging off the side - is an important factor in keeping the boat upright and sailing it fast. A tall sailor can get their centre of gravity further out, thus providing more righting moment. For example, in the [[470 (dinghy)|470]] class, only the crew is on trapeze, so it is beneficial to have a taller crew and a smaller skipper (because the boat requires a light overall weight). Australia's top crew of [[Mathew Belcher]] and [[Malcolm Page (sailor)|Malcolm Page]] exemplify this at {{height|m=1.73}} and {{height|m=1.85}} respectively.

==Shooting==
In shooting sports, a shorter shooter can maintain better balance when standing for long periods of time holding a gun, as well as keep their gun steady.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Sumo==
Professional sumo wrestlers are required to be at least {{height|m=1.73}} tall.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Some aspiring sumo athletes have silicone implants added to the tops of their heads to reach the necessary height.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverychannelasia.com/sumo/world_famous_sumos/index.shtml |title=Discovery Channel South East Asia |publisher=Discoverychannelasia.com |accessdate=2011-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610011748/http://www.discoverychannelasia.com/sumo/world_famous_sumos/index.shtml |archivedate=June 10, 2008 }}</ref> The average height for a sumo wrestler is {{height|m=1.80}}, far above the national average in Japan.

==Swimming==
Elite swimmers are generally taller than the populations at large, indicating that height confers a competitive advantage. A main factor in swimming is the amount of [[drag (physics)|drag]] the swimmer has to overcome when swimming. Drag is composed of [[pressure drag]], [[friction drag]], and [[wave-making resistance]].

<math display="block">D_{total} = D_{pressure} + D_{friction} + D_{wave-making}</math>

The pressure drag is related to cross section size, the friction drag is related to total skin surface (which is generally higher in tall people), and the wave-making drag ''decreases'' with body length because a longer body will generally generate less waves due to a decreasing [[Froude number]]. Studies have found that total drag does not increase as swimmer height increases, mostly due to the decrease in wave-making drag. Since taller swimmers tend to have bigger muscles and bigger hands and feet to propel them, then they are generally at an advantage.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx22TcXodrwC&q=Froude+number+tall+swimmer&pg=PA642|title=Exercise and Sport Science|website=Books.google.dk|isbn=9780683034219|accessdate=28 May 2016|last1=Garrett|first1=William E.|last2=Kirkendall|first2=Donald T.|year=2000}}</ref>

An example of a tall swimmer is [[Michael Phelps]], at {{height|m=1.93}} who won 8 gold medals at the [[2008 Olympic Games]]. The average height of the eight finalists in the 100 meter Freestyle final at the US Olympic Trials was {{height|m=1.95}}. Another exceptionally tall swimmer is [[Michael Groß]], a German great of the 1980s who is {{height|m=2.01}} with an [[arm span]] of {{height|m=2.13}}. Notable exceptions for shorter swimmers, are Japanese [[Kosuke Kitajima]], who at {{height|m=1.77}} is much shorter, and with a more slender build, than a typical Olympic champion swimmer, has achieved astounding results in breaststroke, and [[Ricardo Prado]], a Brazilian medley swimmer of the 1980s, who at {{height|m=1.68}} held a world record and a world title for 400 metres medley for a number of years.

==Taekwondo==
In [[taekwondo]], a taller height gives the advantage of having a longer range and increased chance to strike a target when sparring. However, due to the length of the kicks, combinations and reflexes will not be as quick when compared with a fighter standing at a shorter height. A shorter height will also increase a lower centre of gravity giving a fighter better balance. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Tennis==
Height is advantageous to a tennis player as it allows players to create more power when serving as well as giving players a greater arm span, allowing them to get to sharp-angled shots more easily and a greater chance of returning a lobbed shot. However, being tall can have some disadvantages, such as difficulty bending down to reach low volleys or striking shots close to the abdomen.

Examples of very tall players are [[Ivo Karlović]] {{height|ft=6|in=11}}, [[John Isner]] {{height|ft=6|in=10}}, [[Kevin Anderson (tennis)|Kevin Anderson]] {{height|ft=6|in=8}}, [[Juan Martín del Potro]] and [[Marin Čilić]] both {{height|ft=6|in=6}}, all known for their powerful serves.

The [[Big Four (tennis)|Big Four]] in the present all measure above {{height|ft=6|in=0}}, but not exceedingly in the way those mentioned prior. [[Rafael Nadal]] and [[Roger Federer]] both stand {{height|ft=6|in=1}}, [[Novak Djokovic]] {{height|ft=6|in=2}} and [[Andy Murray]] {{height|ft=6|in=3}}. Other top greats of the game in the 21st century have been tall players, such as [[Andy Roddick]] {{height|ft=6|in=2}} and [[Gustavo Kuerten]] {{height|ft=6|in=3}}.

[[Lindsay Davenport]] {{height|m=1.89}}, [[Maria Sharapova]] {{height|m=1.88}}, [[Dinara Safina]] and [[Venus Williams]] both {{height|m=1.85}} are successful tall players on the women's side.

For both sexes, there have also been some successful players with lesser height, like [[Billie Jean King]] {{height|m=1.64}}, [[Justine Henin]] {{height|m=1.67}}, [[Chris Evert]] {{height|m=1.68}}, [[Pancho Segura]] {{height|ft=5|in=6}}, [[Arantxa Sánchez Vicario]]
{{height|m=1.69}}, [[Rod Laver]] {{height|ft=5|in=8}}, and [[Michael Chang]] {{height|ft=5|in=9}}. Shorter players continue to thrive. Present-day examples include [[Dominika Cibulková]] {{height|m=1.60}}, [[Sara Errani]] {{height|m=1.64}}, [[Simona Halep]] {{height|m=1.68}}, [[David Ferrer]] {{height|ft=5|in=9}}, [[Fabio Fognini]] and [[Kei Nishikori]] both {{height|ft=5|in=10}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/22/sports/tennis/wimbledon-2014-shorter-players-can-thrive-too.html|title=In Today's Power Game, Shorter Players Thrive With Quick Wits and Feet|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 21, 2014|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}</ref>

==Volleyball==
In volleyball, tall players are usually desirable, because it would be easier for them to attack or block the ball. However, shorter players usually have faster reaction time during defense and can pass the ball better. Therefore, since this game is a mixture of speed, skills and tactics, a typical team consist of players of varying height to cater for the specific roles required. The introduction of the [[Libero (volleyball)|libero]] since 1998 has developed the need for agile and quick-moving players who are usually of shorter stature. In professional volleyball, the men's height generally falls between {{height|m=1.85}} to {{height|m=2.10}}, while for women it ranges between {{height|m=1.70}} and {{height|m=1.95}}. Thus, most of them are above average height.

==Weightlifting==
In [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] shorter levers are advantageous and taller than average competitors usually compete in the {{convert|105|kg|lb|abbr=on}} + group. Short people also have a lower consumption of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[glycogen]] than a tall person to make the same proportional effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/how_tall_guys_get_jacked |title=How Tall Guys Get Jacked |publisher=t-nation.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}</ref> So at professional level, it is more advantageous to have short stature.
