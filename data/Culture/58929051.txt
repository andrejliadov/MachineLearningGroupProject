{{Main|Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions}}

The 2005 Convention is an international standard setting instrument providing a framework for the [[Cultural governance|governance of culture]]. In this context, governance of culture refers to policies and measures governments establish to regulate, to promote and to protect all forms of [[creativity]] and artistic expressions. The most recent UNESCO Convention in the field of culture and ratified by 146 parties, it is the first international legal tool to encourage governments to invest in creativity. It frames the formulation and implementation of different types of legislative, regulatory, institutional and financial interventions to promote the emergence of dynamic cultural and [[Creative industries|creative industry]] sectors around the world.<ref name="Creativity">{{cite book |last1=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) |title=Investing in Creativity |date=2018 |publisher=UNESCO |location=Paris |url=https://en.unesco.org/creativity/sites/creativity/files/info-kit_brochure-final-en-web.pdf |accessdate=2 November 2018}}</ref>

Within the context of the 2005 Convention, the diversity of cultural expressions ''″''refers to the manifold ways in which the cultures of groups and societies find expression. These expressions are passed on within and among groups and societies''″''. <ref>{{cite book |last1=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) |title=The 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions |date=2005 |publisher=UNESCO |location=Paris |url=https://en.unesco.org/creativity/convention/texts |accessdate=2 November 2018}}</ref><ref name=Lovrinić2018 /> Specifically, the Convention understands cultural expressions as all forms of creativity and artistic expressions, such as in [[Filmmaking|cinema]]/[[Audiovisual art|audiovisual arts]], [[design]], [[digital arts]], [[music]], [[performing arts]], [[publishing]] and the [[visual arts]]. The 2005 Convention was "since its beginnings, permeated by a material and economic perspective of cultural expressions, focused on the production and consumption of cultural goods and services, with a view to promote more balanced exchanges and sustainable development that takes into account cultural diversity concerns." <ref name="Hanania2016">{{cite journal|last1=Richieri Hanania|first1=Lilian|date=2016|title=The UNESCO Convention on the Diversity of Cultural Expressions as a coordination framework to promote regulatory coherence in the creative economy, International Journal of Cultural Policy.|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|volume=22|issue=4|pages=574–593|doi=10.1080/10286632.2015.1025068|s2cid=214652409}}</ref>

The implementation of the 2005 Convention aims to contribute to achieving several [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), precisely [[Sustainable Development Goal 4|SDG 4]] (Quality [[Education]]), SDG 5 ([[Gender equality|Gender Equality]]), [[Sustainable Development Goal 8|SDG 8]] (Decent Work and [[Economic growth|Economic Growth]]), SDG 10 (Reduced [[Economic inequality|Inequalities]]), SDG 16 ([[Peace]], [[Justice]] and Strong Institutions) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). The implementation process identifies investing in creativity as a priority for [[sustainable development]]. <ref name=GR2018 /> At the global level, the convention calls for countries to provide financial assistance for creativity through their [[Official development assistance|Official Development Assistance (ODA)]] by investing in the Convention’s [[International Fund for Cultural Diversity]]. Additionally, UNESCO, through the 2005 Convention, offers [[technical assistance]] to strengthen human and institutional capacities in [[Developing country|developing countries]].<ref name=Creativity />

The director general of UNESCO, [[Audrey Azoulay]] referring to the UNESCO General Conference's conviction that cultural activities, goods and services have both an economic and a cultural nature stated:<ref name="Hanania2016" /> <blockquote>″[c]ulture is not a commodity: it carries values and identities, it gives markers to live together in a globalized world. Our role is to encourage, question, collect data, to understand and energize creative channels, to encourage the mobility of artists, to stimulate a rapidly changing sector in the new digital environment″. <ref name="Launch"> [[Audrey Azoulay]], Director General of UNESCO.  In {{cite web |title=UNESCO Director-General Launches Global Report Re-shaping Cultural Policies |url=http://www.publicnow.com/view/F21BAD0B4EA808C605D8DDB0AF5C2BBB628BAB27 |website=Public |accessdate=2 November 2018}}</ref> </blockquote>Annika Markovic, Ambassador and Permanent Delegate of Sweden to UNESCO, in 2018, claimed that the report is ''“the only global document that presents an overview of cultural development world-wide and monitors state action to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions at all levels.”'' <ref name="publicnow">{{cite news |title=UNESCO Director-General Launches Global Report Re-shaping Cultural Policies |url=http://www.publicnow.com/view/F21BAD0B4EA808C605D8DDB0AF5C2BBB628BAB27 |accessdate=2 November 2018 |publisher=Public |date=15 December 2017}}</ref> 

The following aspects thematically summarize the core findings identified by the 2018 report with regard to the implementation of the 2005 UNESCO Convention.

=== Culture & sustainable development ===
For the first time, national development plans and strategies integrate culture, mainly of countries in the [[Global South]]. As a result, cities seem to invest more and more in cultural industries for development. The UN’s 2030 Agenda recognized the role of creativity in sustainable development in the implementation of the SDGs. However, the share of development aid spent on culture today is the lowest it has been in over 10 years. <ref name=GR2018 />

=== Cultural expressions in the digital age ===
According to the report, digital revenues make up 50% of the recorded music market, growing almost 18% over the past year due to a sharp increase in the share of streaming revenues. <ref name=GR2018 />

The report states that the internet transforms the cultural value chain into a network platform. E-commerce challenges both culture and trade policies that intend to promote the diversity of cultural expressions. <ref name=GR2018 />{{rp|28}} It articulates the urgency to improve data collection on revenues generated through digital channels in order to design better policies and negotiate fair trade agreements. The report claims that monitoring the relationship between large platforms, [[Big data|Big Data]], [[artificial intelligence]] and the diversity of cultural expressions is crucial to ensure that a variety of distribution platforms and providers promote and protect future artistic creations. <ref name="GR2018" />

=== Artistic freedom ===
As informed by the report, attacks against artists have increased in the past years, including in the digital environment where surveillance and online trolling pose new threats to artistic freedom. In 2016, 430 cases were reported around the world (compared to 340 in 2015 and 90 in 2014).<ref name=moderndiplomacy2017>{{cite news|url=https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2017/12/08/launch-of-global-culture-report-at-meeting-of-unesco-s-convention-on-the-diversity-of-cultural-expressions/|title=Launch of Global Culture Report at Meeting of UNESCO's Convention on the Diversity of Cultural Expressions|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=31 October 2018|publisher=Modern Diplomacy}}</ref><ref name=epd>{{cite news|url=https://www.epd.de/landesdienst/landesdienst-ost/schwerpunktartikel/unesco-fordert-st%C3%A4rkung-der-kulturwirtschaft|title=Unesco fordert Stärkung der Kulturwirtschaft. Deutsche Kulturverbände für regelmäßigen Regierungsbericht|date=8 December 2017|accessdate=31 October 2018|publisher=Evangelischer Pressedienst}}</ref> Musicians are the most threatened group, while authors also often become a target.<ref name=GR2018 /><ref name=mculturalsector >{{cite news|url=https://www.ifa.de/de/nachrichten-presse/detail/news/where-the-cultural-sector-stands.html|title=Where the Cultural Sector stands.|accessdate=31 October 2018|publisher=Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen}}</ref><ref name=epd />  In 2016, attacks against authors occurred most often in the [[Asia-Pacific|Asia-Pacific Region]] (80 cases), the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] (51 cases) and [[Europe]] (47 cases). <ref name=epd /> The report reveals that meanwhile, there exists an increased awareness with regard to such threats leading to a larger number of initiatives to support the social and economic rights of artists, particularly in African countries. While there exists legal action to affirm the freedom of expression for artists, other laws addressing terrorism and state security repress artistic expressions. <ref name=GR2018 />

=== Gender equality in cultural and creative industries ===
[[File:Proportion of female artists in ten recent global biennales, 2017.png|thumb|556x556px|Proportion of female artists in ten recent global biennales, 2017]]
The report states that half of the persons working in the cultural and creative industries are female. However, a gender gap persists worldwide concerning equal pay, access to funding and prices charged for creative works. Consequently, women remain under-represented in key creative roles and are outnumbered in decision-making positions.<ref name=GR2018 /><ref name=publicnow /> <ref name=epd /> Women make up only 34% of [[Culture minister|Ministers for Culture]] (compared to 24% in 2005) and only 31% of national arts program directors. Generally, women are represented in specific cultural fields such as arts education and training (60%), book publishing and press (54%), audiovisual and interactive media (26%), as well as design and creative services (33%).<ref name="moderndiplomacy2017" />

=== Mobility of artists and cultural professionals ===
[[File:Average number of countries accessible without visas passport-holders Global North and Global South, 2017.png|thumb|Average number of countries accessible without visas passport-holders Global North and Global South, 2017]]
The report demonstrates that predominantly restrictions in terms of mobility represent great challenges to persons pursuing careers in the cultural and creative industries, specifically to those from the Global South.<ref name="newspress2017">{{cite news |title=L'UNESCO soutient la mobilité des artistes en Tunesie |url=http://www.newspress.fr/Communique_FR_306040_1052.aspx |accessdate=2 November 2018 |publisher=News Press |date=14 December 2017}}</ref>  It reveals that a holder of a German passport can travel to 176 countries without a visa while a holder of an Afghan passport can only travel to 24 countries without a [[Travel visa|visa]].<ref name="newspress2017" /> As a matter of fact, artists and cultural professionals need to travel to perform, to reach new audiences or to attend a [[Artist-in-residence|residency]] or to engage in networking. The report exposes that travel restrictions, including difficulties in obtaining visas oftentimes impedes artists from the [[Global South]] to participate in art [[Biennale|biennales]] or [[Film festival|film festivals]], even when invited to receive an award or to promote their works. <ref name="GR2018" /><ref name="epd" />

=== Governance of culture ===
As stated in the report, the 2005 Convention provides legitimacy for the formulation of cultural policies and their adaptation to changing circumstances and needs. The report underscores that collaborative governance and multi-stakeholder policy making have progressed, notably in some developing countries particularly in the creative economy and cultural education. As a result, parties to the Convention have made considerable progress in fostering digital arts creation, supporting creative entrepreneurship, accelerating the modernization of cultural sectors, promoting distribution and updating [[copyright]] legislation.<ref name=GR2018 /> However, the report also reveals a lack in civil society participation in policy making. It underlines the urgency for more effort to ensure the creation of open, transparent and participatory policy processes in order to involve civil society participation in policy making. <ref name=GR2018 /> <ref name=publicnow />

=== Trade and investment in cultural goods and services ===
In accordance with the report, the 2005 Convention formally recognizes that cultural goods and services not only have important economic value, but also convey identities, meanings and values.<ref name=GR2018 /> As a consequence, at least eight bilateral and regional free trade agreements concluded between 2015 and 2017 have introduced cultural clauses or list of commitments that promote the objectives and principles of the 2005 Convention. Despite the lack of the promotion of the objectives and principles of the 2005 Convention with regard to the negotiation of mega-regional partnership agreements, some Parties to the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|Trans Pacific Partnership (TTP)]] have succeeded in introducing important cultural reservations to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions. <ref name=GR2018 />

== Next steps ==
The report’s primary objective is “to provide key actors with better knowledge on how to support evidence-based policy, and to strengthen informed, transparent and participatory systems of governance for culture.” <ref name=gmr /> It aims to motivate governments and civil society actors to integrate findings and recommendations into their national cultural policy and development strategies and frameworks.<ref name=GR2018 /> 

Following the findings presented above, the implementation of the 2005 Convention "introduce[s] a range of different policy strategies for integrating culture into development processes" <ref name="Throsby 2017">{{Cite journal|last=Throsby|first=David|date=February 2017|title=Culturally sustainable development: theoretical concept or practical policy instrument?|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|volume=23|issue=2|pages=133–147|doi=10.1080/10286632.2017.1280788|s2cid=149418865}}</ref> and culture is increasingly regarded as "an economic asset in pursuing sustainable development"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiktor-Mach|first=Dobrosława|date=October 2018|title=What role for culture in the age of sustainable development? UNESCO's advocacy in the 2030 Agenda negotiations|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|volume=26|issue=3|pages=312–327|doi=10.1080/10286632.2018.1534841|s2cid=149625996}}</ref>. Based on its analysis and findings, the Global Report of 2018 suggests the following road map for the parties to the 2005 Convention.<ref name="GR2018" /> Accordingly, parties could tackle major challenges in the implementation of the 2005 Convention by:

# Streamlining and harmonizing data and information required for national and global monitoring purposes;
# Encouraging research networks and statistical offices around the world to use the Global Report monitoring framework, its core indicators and means of verification as a basis for their data collection and the establishing of statistical baselines;
# Filling existing data gaps identified in the two Global reports referring to key cultural policy areas, such as trade in cultural services, mobility flows, culture in the digital environment, or gender-disaggregated data;
# Raising awareness among policy decision makers for cultural policy reforms;
# Building capacities on policy monitoring;
# Sensitizing the development community with regard to the creative sector's potential not only contributes to the creation of jobs and income, but also catalyzes innovation, permeating traditional development areas such as education and gender equality, and brings about change.

== Challenges  ==
Speaking about the visibility of the progress in cultural policies shown by the report series, Bárbara Lovrinić stated that ''“[u]nfortunately, where UNESCO is concerned, there is a lack of promotion in the media in general. In the long term, the report could have a positive impact on these issues, which would be enhanced if the public were made more aware of such work.”''<ref name="Lovrinić2018" />{{rp|137}} She also points out that there is ''"a risk that many people will not dwell on the 2005 Convention and the Sustainable Development Goals unless they are already somewhat familiar with the topic.”''<ref name="Lovrinić2018" />{{rp|137}} With reference to the title of the report series, she concludes that ''"cultural policy-making is still far from being reshaped, for it takes a serious amount of time to yield valuable results.”''<ref name="Lovrinić2018" />{{rp|139}}
