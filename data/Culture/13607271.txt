The '''''Coptic Encyclopedia''''' is an eight-volume work covering the history, theology, language, art, architecture, archeology and hagiography of [[Coptic Egypt]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Aziz Suryal |last=Atiya |author-link=Aziz Suryal Atiya |title=The Coptic encyclopedia |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |location=[[New York City]] |year=1991 |isbn=0-02-897025-X |oclc=22808960}}</ref> The encyclopedia was written by over 250 Western and Egyptian contributing experts in the field of [[Coptology]], [[history]], [[art]] and [[theology]] and was edited by [[Aziz Suryal Atiya]]. It was funded by [[Coptic Pope]] [[Shenouda III]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and others.

The ''Coptic Encyclopedia'' is the first Encyclopedia to focus on one of the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Churches]]<ref name=hulsman1992>[[Cornelis Hulsman]] in ''[[Coptic Church Review]]'', Vol. 13, no. 3, Fall 1992</ref> and since its publication in 1991 it has been used by many scholars and students in the West. The ''Encyclopedia'' is the fruit of the Coptic emigrant community in the West and the crown of the work of [[Aziz Suryal Atiya]], who did not live to see his work carried into print.<ref name=hulsman1992/>

Atiya developed the vision to publish an encyclopedia during the years he taught at the [[Middle East Center]] of the [[University of Utah]]. He formed an editorial committee and scholars from all over the world were asked to contribute. Suggestions for entries were given. The work started in 1980.<ref name=hulsman1992/> Contributors included many non-Orthodox scholars, including such Muslims as  [[Mustafa el-Fiqi]] and [[Ali el-Hillal Dessouki]].

The Coptic community in the West played a role in increasing Western interest in Egyptian church life. If the interest in a ''Coptic Encyclopedia'' in English had not existed and if the project of the ''Coptic Encyclopedia'' had not received support in the Coptic migrant community in North America, the idea of producing an English ''Coptic Encyclopedia'' would have never materialized. The production of this ''Encyclopedia'' is therefore strongly linked to the growth of the Coptic migrant community in the West.<ref name=hulsman1992/>

Coptic Orthodox Church leader Pope Shenouda III himself contributed to the entry about emigration. In no period of Coptic history have as many Copts migrated to the west as during the Papacy of Pope Shenouda.<ref name=hulsman1992/>

In 2009, the [[Claremont Graduate University]] (CGU) School of Religion acquired the right to develop an updated and continuously expanding and evolving web-based version of the ''Coptic Encyclopedia''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Claremont Coptic Encyclopedia|url=http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/cce|website=Claremont Colleges Digital Library|publisher=[[Claremont Colleges]]|access-date=2 January 2015}}</ref>
