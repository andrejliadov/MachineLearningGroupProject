==History==

Bal Harbour Shops  has ranked No. 1 in the U.S. for decades in productivity based on sales per square foot. It recently ranked No. 1 in the world, according to the September 2012 cover story in the International Council of Shopping Center's Shopping Centers Today magazine.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shopping Centers Today Retail Trophies |date=4 September 2012 |url=http://balharbourshops.com/shopping-centers-today-retail-trophies |accessdate=25 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330192550/http://balharbourshops.com/shopping-centers-today-retail-trophies |archive-date=30 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> With just two exceptions (following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the recession of 2008), sales at Bal Harbour Shops have increased every single year since its opening in 1965. For the year ended 2013, sales per square foot hit a record high of $3,010.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shopping Centers Today Retail Trophies |date=4 September 2012 |url=http://fortune.com/2014/10/29/malls-that-make-the-most/ |accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref>

Bal Harbour Shops is planning to add {{convert|340000|sqft}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bal Harbour Shops expansion approved after decade in the works |date=17 May 2017 |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/miami-beach/article150961342.html/ |accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref> To accomplish that, in 2012, the Whitman family struck a land swap deal with Church by the Sea.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bal Harbour Shops Strikes Deal With Church By The Sea For Retail Space Expansion |date=18 September 2012 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/18/bal-harbour-shops-church-by-the-sea_n_1894324.html |accessdate=25 March 2013 |work=Huffington Post |first=Christiana |last=Lilly}}</ref> In exchange, Bal Harbour Shops will build a {{convert|60000|sqft|adj=on}} church on land purchased for them, by Bal Harbour Shops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bal Harbour Shops expansion approved after decade in the works |date=18 May 2017 |url=http://www.balharbourfl.gov/quick-link-pages/news-center/2017/05/18/bal-harbour-shops-expansion-approved-after-decade-in-the-works |accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref>

In January 2013, Bal Harbour Shops announced an equity partnership with Swire Properties to jointly develop the {{convert|500000|sqft|adj=on}} retail component of [[Brickell CityCentre]] in downtown Miami.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bal Harbour Shops and Swire Properties develop jointly Brickell CityCentre |date=30 January 2012 |url=http://www.cpp-luxury.com/bal-harbour-shops-and-swire-properties-develop-jointly-brickell-citycentre-miamis-new-luxury-mall/ |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> Bal Harbour will contribute equity, brand recognition and its luxury retail expertise to the project.

A {{convert|340000|sqft|adj=on}} expansion of the Bal Harbour Shops, in the works for more than a decade, won final approval from the Bal Harbour Village Council in May 2017

The upgraded center is anticipated to feature the first Barneys New York flagship store in the southeastern U.S., major upgrades to longtime anchor tenant Neiman Marcus and new dining options, including Freds at Barneys.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bal Harbour Shops’ $400M expansion secures final approval |date=17 May 2017 |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/miami-beach/article150961342.html/ |accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref>

The Shops enhancement plan will build on its fifty-year legacy of community investment by providing funding for a new, environmentally-sustainable, hurricane-protected Village Hall and parking garage, improvements to Village infrastructure, donating the land to the nearby Fairfield and SunTrust properties, totaling nearly {{convert|2|acre}}, millions of dollars for a new waterfront community park, funding to create a new Art in Public Places program for the Village, and millions of dollars in new annual tax revenue that will help sustain the Village for years to come.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bal Harbour Shops’ $400M expansion secures final approval |date=17 May 2017 |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/miami-beach/article150961342.html/ |accessdate=27 July 2017}}</ref>
