'''Information exchange''' or '''information sharing''' means that people or other entities pass information from one to another. This could be done electronically or through certain systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/information-exchange|title=INFORMATION EXCHANGE {{!}} definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref> These are terms that can either refer to bidirectional ''[[information transfer]]'' in [[telecommunication]]s and [[computer science]] or ''[[communication]]'' seen from a [[system theory|system-theoretic]] or [[information-theoretic]] point of view.

'''Information exchange''' has a long history in [[information technology]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Young-Ybarra|first=Candace|last2=Wiersema|first2=Margarethe|date=August 1999|title=Strategic Flexibility in Information Technology Alliances: The Influence of Transaction Cost Economics and Social Exchange Theory|journal=Organization Science|volume=10|issue=4|pages=439–459|doi=10.1287/orsc.10.4.439|issn=1047-7039|url=https://digitalcommons.chapman.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=business_articles}}</ref> Traditional information sharing referred to one-to-one exchanges of data between a sender and receiver.

Some controversy comes when discussing regulations regarding information exchange.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Expert Roles and Information Exchange during Discussion: The Importance of Knowing Who Knows What|issue=3|pages=244–265|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=31|doi=10.1006/jesp.1995.1012|date=May 1995|last1=Stasser|first1=Garold|last2=Stewart|first2=Dennis D.|last3=Wittenbaum|first3=Gwen M.}}</ref> Initiatives to standardize information sharing protocols include extensible markup language ([[XML]]), simple object access protocol ([[SOAP]]), and web services description language ([[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]]).

From the point of view of a computer scientist, the four primary information sharing [[design pattern]]s are sharing information [[One-to-one (communication)|one-to-one]], [[Point-to-multipoint communication|one-to-many]], [[many-to-many]], and [[many-to-one]]. Technologies to meet all four of these design patterns are evolving and include [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[RSS|really simple syndication]], [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]], and [[Online chat|chat]].

One example of United States government's attempt to implement one of these design patterns (one to one) is the [[National Information Exchange Model]] (NIEM).<ref>[http://www.niem.gov/ NIEM]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.niem.gov/|title=NIEM {{!}} National Information Exchange Model|website=NIEM {{!}} National Information Exchange Model|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> One-to-one exchange models fall short of supporting all of the required design patterns needed to fully implement data exploitation technology.

Advanced information sharing platforms provide [[controlled vocabularies]], [[data integration|data harmonization]], [[data steward]]ship policies and guidelines, standards for uniform data as they relate to [[privacy]], [[data security|security]], and [[data quality]].

==Information Sharing, Intelligence Reform, and Terrorism Prevention Act==
The term '''information sharing''' gained popularity as a result of the [[9/11 Commission]] Hearings and its [[9/11 Commission Report|report]] of the [[United States government]]'s lack of response to information known about the planned [[terrorist]] attack on the [[New York City]] [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] prior to the event. The resulting commission report led to the enactment of several executive orders by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] that mandated agencies implement policies to "share information" across organizational boundaries. In addition, an Information Sharing Environment Program Manager<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ise.gov/ |title=Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment |access-date=2017-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212020757/http://www.ise.gov/ |archive-date=2006-12-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (PM-ISE) was appointed, tasked to implement the provisions of the [[Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act]] of 2004.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ise.gov/intelligence-reform-and-terrorism-prevention-act-2004-sec-1016-information-sharing |title = About the ISE}}</ref> In making recommendation toward the creation of an "Information Sharing Environment" the 9/11 Commission based itself on the findings and recommendations made by the [[Markle Foundation|Markle]] Task Force on National Security in the Information Age.<ref>[http://www.markle.org/national-security/markle-task-force-national-security Markle Task Force on National Security in the Information Age]</ref>
