[[File:El Tio Potosi Bolivia.jpg|thumbnail|A Figure of El Tio in [[Potosí]] mines, Bolivia, 1993]]
'''El Tío''' (The Uncle), is believed in [[Cerro Rico]], [[Potosí]], [[Bolivia]] to be the "Lord of the [[Underworld]]". There are many statues of this devil-like spirit in the [[Mining|mines]] of [[Cerro Rico]]. El Tío rules over the mines, simultaneously offering protection and destruction. Some figures are in the shape of a goat.<ref name="pbs">{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/devilsminer/mountain.html | title=THE DEVIL'S MINER .

Miners bring offerings such as cigarettes, coca leaves, and alcohol for the statues<ref name="BBC">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29448079 | title=Cerro Rico: Devil Worship on the man-eating mountain | publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref name="UCLA">{{cite web | url=http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~bolivia/potosi.html | title=Bolivia 2003 - Potosi | publisher=The UCLA, Department of Earth and Space Sciences Tours | accessdate=2013-04-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091227072415/http://www2.ess.ucla.edu/~bolivia/potosi.html | archivedate=11 April 2014}}</ref> and believe that if El Tío is not fed, he will take matters into his own hands. Villagers of Potosi ritually slaughter a [[llama]] and smear its blood on the entrance to the mines.<ref name="pbs"/>

The miners of [[Cerro Rico]] are [[Catholic]]s and they believe in both [[Jesus|Christ]] and El Tío. However, worship of El Tío is condemned  strongly by the [[Catholic Church]].<ref name="pbs"/> Images of El Tío are usually not allowed outside of the mines, as this is seen as the realm of God and El Tío has no place there. Likewise, Christian symbolism isn't allowed inside of the mines, as this "Underworld" is seen as El Tío's realm.<ref name="ctr"/>

Every year, the [[Carnaval de Oruro]] is held, and costumes and statues of El Tío are paraded around in a ceremony that represents his defeat at the hands of the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]]. This is the only time that images of El Tío are allowed above the surface of the mines.<ref name="ctr">{{cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/bolivia/articles/meet-el-tio-the-devil-who-rules-the-underworld-of-bolivias-mines/ | title=Meet El Tío: the Devil Who Rules the Underworld of Bolivia's Mines |publisher=Culture Trip}}</ref><ref>Alex Jordan, [https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/bolivia/articles/dancing-with-the-devil-bolivias-yearly-demonic-festival/ Dancing With The Devil in Bolivia], Culture Trip</ref>
