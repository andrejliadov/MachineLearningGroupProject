'''ChristianFilmDatabase.com, LLC''' ('''CFDb''') is an [[online database]] of [[Christian films]] and their associated information. It was designed to be a [[Christianity|Christian]] version of the [[Internet Movie Database]].

== History of the CFDb website ==
CFDb was founded in 2008 by Roger Rudlaff <ref>{{cite web |url=http://boxoffice.com/featured_stories/2010/01/pressing-on.php |title=Pressing On |last=Toto |first=Christian |date=January 27, 2010 |work=[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]] |accessdate=January 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130083449/http://boxoffice.com/featured_stories/2010/01/pressing-on.php |archive-date=January 30, 2010 |url-status = dead }}</ref> who had previously created "The Wayhouse Christian Film Library", a library that lent Christian movies to the public.<ref name="Podger">{{cite web |url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/110760 |title=Faith-based video lending libraries on increase |last=Podger |first=Pamela J. |date=March 29, 2007 |work=[[The Roanoke Times]] |accessdate=January 29, 2010}}</ref> He and his wife Annelie Rudlaff started "The Wayhouse [[Christianity|Christian]] Film Library" in 2001 by loaning out [[Christianity|Christian]] books and [[VHS]] movies in [[Buena Vista, Colorado]] out of their home and showing a few films to the public in their town's [[chamber of commerce]] building. They later moved to [[Roanoke, Virginia]], where they re-opened in 2006.<ref name="Podger"/> While the Rudlaffs were running this lending library, Roger Rudlaff had difficulty finding certain Christian films, because the different films he searched for were scattered on many different websites. He started a specialist Christian films website called CFDb, after doing some research on [[IMDb]]. He was unable to claim the title of CMDb, because that [[domain name]] was taken by another [[Christian music]] website. He registered the CFDb domain name in 2008 and on Feb. 25 2011, the company became a LLC.

The database includes information on the films such as release date, running time, [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA rating]], formats, [[film director]], [[film producer]], [[screenwriter]], [[film score composer]], [[cinematographer]], language and subtitles, film production company, [[film distribution company]], cast, [[film trailer]], film website, [[Facebook]] page, [[Twitter]] page, [[Film criticism|movie reviews]], contact info, and synopsis.

In March 2012 the company made informal agreements with "Cruciflicks" and with "Indy Christian Review" for sharing Christian [[Film criticism|movie review]] content.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cruciflicks.wordpress.com/2012/03/11/cruciflicks-partners-with-cfdb/ |title=Cruciflicks Partners With CFDb |last=Vaught |first=Lance |date=March 11, 2012 |work=[Cruciflicks] |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}</ref> In May 2012, CFDb signed an exclusive deal with [[Christian Book Distributors]] to sell the films listed on CFDb via Christian Book Distributors' website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/cfdb-news/cfdb-partners-with-cbd-christian-book-distributors-our-new-online-store/ |title=CFDb makes exclusive deal with Christian Book Distributors |last=Rudlaff |first=Annelie |date=May 2012 |work=[CFDb blog] |accessdate=November 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923203036/http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/cfdb-news/cfdb-partners-with-cbd-christian-book-distributors-our-new-online-store/ |archive-date=September 23, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On March 13, 2013 CFDb and the [[crowdfunding]] website FaithLauncher announced a strategic alliance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/3/prweb10525410.htm |title=CFDb, Christian Film Database And Crowdfunding Website, FaithLauncher Form Strategic Alliance |last=Chavez  |first=Fernando |date=March 13, 2013 |work=FaithLauncher |accessdate=March 26, 2013}}</ref>

As of March 2020 the site is undergoing major renovations and is currently down.

== Criteria for inclusion ==
According to their website, the CFDb states that they are a [[non-denominational]] list of what they call "Christian films" and that "We list all films with a Christian message, it does not matter who makes it."<ref>{{cite web|title=Christian Movies All in One Place, Easy to Find! CFDb!|url=http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/|publisher=www.christianfilmdatabase.com|accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref>

The CFDb states that two of their criteria for being a Christian film are: 1. "The film must show a need for [[God]], [[Jesus]], or the [[Holy Spirit]] in some way." 2. "The film is marketed to the  Christian Community, therefore  Christians  will be searching for it on the database." <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/christian-movie-news/cfdb-guidelines-what-films-get-posted-to-cfdb/ |title=CFDb Guidelines: What films get posted to CFDb |last=Rudlaff |first=Annelie |date=October 9, 2012 |work=Christian Film Database |accessdate=March 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414010345/http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/christian-movie-news/cfdb-guidelines-what-films-get-posted-to-cfdb/ |archive-date=April 14, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Number of films ==
On January 1, 2010, there were approximately 1,250 films listed on CFDb, with more added weekly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogcritics.org/video/article/interview-with-roger-rudlaff-of-the/ |title=Interview with Roger Rudlaff of the Christian Film Database |last=Biddinger |first=J.J. |date=January 1, 2010 |work=[[Blogcritics]] |accessdate=January 29, 2010}}</ref> Rudlaff said, "I list films in many formats, like [[16 mm film|16mm]], [[VHS]], [[DVD]], and now [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and (VOD) [[Video on Demand]]" <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/newsdesk_info.php?newsdesk_id=1239 |title=Video Ministry Becomes Christian Film Database |last=Walker |first=Angela |date=January 8, 2010 |work=[[ChristianCinema.com]] |accessdate=January 29, 2010}}</ref> As of January 2013, CFDb had over 1600 films listed, some of which have multiple film titles listed on one page as a series: these are counted as a single film.

== Rankings (CFDb's top 100) ==
In December 2012, the CFDb released its list of the top 100 Christian films for 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianfilmworksmag.com/index.php?p=1_9_CFDb/ |title=Christian Film Database makes Cover Story Christian Filmworks Magazine January 2013 issue |last=Wolf |first=Susan |date=January 1, 2013 |work=Christian Filmworks Magazine |accessdate=January 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200337/http://www.christianfilmworksmag.com/index.php?p=1_9_CFDb%2F |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Rudlaff">{{cite web |url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/634071297.html |title=Christian Film Database Releases Top 100 Films of 2012 |last=Rudlaff |first=Annelie |date=January 18, 2013 |work=Christian News Wire |accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref>
