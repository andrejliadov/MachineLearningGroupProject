The '''Black and Indian Mission Office''' comprises the [[Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions]], the [[Commission for the Catholic Missions among the Colored People and the Indians]] and the [[Catholic Negro-American Mission Board]], which are three [[Roman Catholic]] institutions for mission work in the United States that maintain separate functions but operate with one staff and one board of directors.

==History==
The ''Bureau'' and the ''Commission'' have shared common offices in Washington, D.C. since 1935<ref>''Our Negro and Indian Missions: Annual Report of the Secretary of the Commission for the Catholic Missions among the Colored People and the Indians'', 1935-1936, inside front cover.</ref> and were joined by the ''Catholic Negro-American Mission Board'' in 1980.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/Mss/BCIM/BCIM-SC3.shtml|title=Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions Records|website=[[Marquette University]]|accessdate=September 19, 2016}}</ref> In 2009, the three institutions adopted the ''Black and Indian Mission Office'' as a banner for their joint webpage.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.blackandindianmissions.org |title= Black and Indian Mission Office |website= Black and Indian Mission Office |accessdate= September 19, 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref> 

The '''Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions''' has supported and promoted Catholic missions among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and has defended the rights of Native Americans. It was founded as the ''Office of Catholic Commissioner for Indian Missions'' in 1874 with  approval by ''J. Roosevelt Bayley'', the [[Archbishop of Baltimore]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/Mss/BCIM/BCIM-SC1-history2.shtml |title= Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions Records |website=Marquette University |accessdate= September 19, 2016 |author= Paul A.

Since 1887, the '''Commission for the Catholic Missions among the Colored People and the Indians''' has administered a national annual Lenten collection to support African American and Native American missions. In 1884, the [[Third Plenary Council of Baltimore]] decreed the establishment of the Lenten collection and a commission of three bishops to administer it. Since the 1980s, the Commission and its collection have been known respectively as the ''Black and Indian Mission Office'' and the ''Black and Indian Mission collection''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/Mss/BCIM/BCIM-SC2.shtml|title=Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions Records|website=Marquette University|accessdate=September 19, 2016}}; ''The Quarterly: Report of the Commission for the Catholic Missions Among the Colored People and the Indians'', Winter, 1985, back page.</ref>

The '''Catholic Negro-American Mission Board''' has supported and promoted Catholic missions among African Americans. It was founded in 1907 as the ''Catholic Board for Mission Work among the Colored People'' to provide a second national funding stream for Black Catholic missions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/Mss/BCIM/BCIM-SC3.shtml|title=Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions Records|website=Marquette University|accessdate=September 19, 2016}}; ''Our Colored Missions'', "Reorganization of Mission Aid" 11 (1925): 24.</ref>
