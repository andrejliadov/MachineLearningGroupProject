'''Heitstrenging''', also known as '''Hietstrenja''', '''Heitstrengingar''' or '''Strengdir''',  was the [[Norsemen|Norse]] [[ritual]] of making solemn vows, particularly at [[Yule]]. The practice was eventually discarded when [[Christianity]] gained dominance in the region. 

The vows were traditionally made while laying hands on the bristles of the [[sonargöltr]], the boar sacrificed at the [[blót]] on the evening of Yule Eve, and in association with the [[Symbel#Scandinavian sumbel|Bragafull]] or chieftain's toast.<ref>"Sonargǫltr", [[Rudolf Simek]], ''Dictionary of Northern Mythology'', tr.

The association with the sacrificial boar and the ritual toast gave the vows the force of an [[oath]].<ref name=deVries/> However, due to the ritual process, they usually came after the speaker was drunk.<ref>[[Charles Francis Keary]], ''Norway and the Norwegians'', New York: Scribner, 1892, OCLC 2651194, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YI0BAAAAYAAJ&dq=Viking+oaths+Bragi&q=oaths#v=snippet&q=oaths&f=false p. 174]</ref> They became a topos in the later sagas,<ref name=deVries/> often as a form of bragging and promising the performance of some great feat, and taking place not only at Yule but at other sacrificial feasts, [[weddings]], [[arvals]] or just ordinary [[banquet]]s.<ref name=SSVA/><ref name="PLON">Rudolph Keyser, tr.

[[Harald I of Norway|Harald Hairfair]], the unifier of [[Norway]], promised to not comb or cut his hair until he ruled the entire country.<ref name=SSVA/> More often, though, they were regarded as a matter of great significance.
