In Indian mythology, the '''Solar dynasty''' or the '''Ikshvaku dynasty''' was founded by the legendary king [[Ikshvaku]].<ref name="hind">Geography of Rigvedic India, M.L. Bhargava, Lucknow 1964, pp. 15-18, 46-49, 92-98, 100-/1, 136</ref> The dynasty is also known as {{IAST|Sūryavaṁśa}} ("Solar dynasty" or "Descendants of the Sun") and along with [[Lunar dynasty]] comprises one of the main lineages of the [[Kshatriya|Kshatriya Varna]].

Both refers to the same person. According to Buddhist texts and tradition, [[Gautama Buddha]] descended from this dynasty. Many later kings of the [[Indian subcontinent]] claimed to be of Suryavanshi background.

The important personalities belonging to this royal house are [[Mandhatri]] , [[Muchukunda]] , [[Ambarisha]] , [[Bharata Chakravartin]], [[Bahubali]], [[Harishchandra]], [[Dilīpa]], [[Sagara (Vedic king)|Sagara]],<ref name="hind2">[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03106.htm Ikshaku tribe] [[Mahabharata|The Mahabharata]] translated by [[Kisari Mohan Ganguli]] (1883 -1896), Book 3: Vana Parva: Tirtha-yatra Parva: Section CVI, '''p. 228''' 'There was born in the family of the '''Ikshaku''', a ruler of the earth named '''Sagara''', endued with beauty, and strength...".</ref> [[Raghu]], [[Rama]] and [[Pasenadi]]. Although, both the Hindu [[Puranas]] and the [[Buddhist]] texts include [[Suddhodana|Shuddodhana]], [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[Rahula]] in their accounts of the Ikshvaku dynasty, but according to the Buddhist texts, [[Mahasammata]], an ancestor of Ikshvaku was the founder of this dynasty,<ref name="Malalasekera1">{{cite book|last=Malalasekera|first=G.

According to the Puranas, supreme preceptor of the Ikshvaku dynasty was sage [[Vashishta]].

==Origins==
Suryavansha or Solar Dynasty is the one of the two major legendary [[Kshatriya]] dynasties found in Hindu Puranic and epic literature, the other being Chandravansha or the [[Lunar Dynasty]].One of sons of [[Brahma]] was [[Marichi]], whose grandson was [[Surya|Vivasvan]], from whom started Suryavansha. (Reference-Bhaleram Beniwal: Jaton ka Adikalin Itihasa, Jaypal Agencies, Agra 2005 (Page 25). According to ''Harivamsa'', Ikshvaku is considered the primogenitor of the dynasty of [[Surya]] and was granted the kingdom of Aryavarta by his father [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Vaivasvata Manu]]. Manu settled down in the [[Aryavarta]] region after he survived the great flood. [[A. K. Mozumdar]] states that Manu is the one who built a city on the [[Sarayu]] and called it [[Ayodhya]] meaning the 'invincible city'. This city served as the capital of many kings from the solar dynasty and is also the birthplace of [[Rama]] an avatar of [[Vishnu]].{{sfn|A.K.Mazumdar|2008|p=161}}

Some hindu texts suggest Rishi [[Marichi]], one of the seven sages and first human creations of [[Brahma]] as the progenitor of the dynasty. Marichi's eldest son [[Kashyapa]] is said to have settled down in Kashmir (Kashyapa-Meru or Kashyameru). He also contributed to the verses of the Vedas. Later, Vivasvan's son of Kashyapa and Aditi rose as a prominent hindu god [[Surya]] and married [[Saranyu]] the daughter of [[Vishvakarman|Vishwakarma]], the architect of devas. He had many children but Manu was given the responsibility of building the civilization and as a result it formed a dynasty that was named 'Suryavansh' or the solar dynasty. Manu is also the progenitor of the Lunar Dynasty because he married his daughter [[Ila (Hinduism)|Ila]] to [[Budha]], the son of [[Chandra]] or the moon god and the couple gave birth to the magnanimous king [[Pururavas]] who became the first king of the Chandravansh or the Lunar dynasty.{{sfn|A.K.Mazumdar|2008|p=159}}

==In Bhagavata Purana==
Ikshvaku and his ancestor Manu are also mentioned in the [[Bhagavata Purana]] (Canto 9, Chapter 1),
{{Verse translation|
yo 'sau satyavrato nāma
rājarṣir draviḍeśvaraḥ
jñānaṁ yo 'tīta-kalpānte
lebhe puruṣa-sevayā

sa vai vivasvataḥ putro
manur āsīd iti śrutam
tvattas tasya sutāḥ proktā
ikṣvāku-pramukhā nṛpāḥ
|
he who was known as Satyavrata
the saintly king of '''dravida desa'''
one who received spiritual knowledge at the end of period of last Manu
by rendering service to the Supreme

became known as Vaivasvata Manu, the son of Vivasvan
in the period of next manu
I have already heard from you that his sons
were many kings, headed by '''Iksvaku'''
}}

== In Buddhism ==
The Buddhist text, [[Buddhavamsa]] and [[Mahavamsa]] (II, 1-24) traces the origin of the [[Shakya]]s to king Okkaka (Pali equivalent to Sanskrit Ikshvaku) and gives their genealogy from Mahasammata, an ancestor of Okkaka. This list comprises the names of a number of prominent kings of the Ikshvaku dynasty, namely, [[King Mandhata|Mandhata]] and Sagara.<ref>Law, B.C. (1973). ''Tribes in Ancient India'', Bhandarkar Oriental Series No.4, Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, p.246</ref> The genealogy according to the Mahavamsa is as follows:<ref>Misra, V.S.
