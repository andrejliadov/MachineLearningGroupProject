'''Mormons''' are a [[Religious denomination|religious]] and [[cultural group]] related to [[Mormonism]], the principal branch of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] started by [[Joseph Smith]] in [[upstate New York]] during the 1820s. After Smith's death in 1844 the movement split into several groups following different leaders; the majority followed [[Brigham Young]], while smaller groups followed [[Joseph Smith III]], [[Sidney Rigdon]], and [[James Strang]]. The term ''Mormon'' has been used to refer to members of all these groups, but it most often refers solely to members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), as today this branch is far larger than all the others combined. Since 2018, the LDS Church has requested that its members be referred to as "Latter-day Saints". 

Mormons have developed a strong sense of commonality that stems from their doctrine and history. One of the central doctrinal issues that defined the Mormonism in the 19th century was the practice of [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]], a form of religious [[polygamy]]. Between 1852 and 1904, Mormons who had followed Brigham Young to the [[Utah Territory]] openly practiced polygamy. The Mormons who followed [[James Strang]] (known as [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)|Strangites]]) practiced polygamy until Strang's death, after which the majority left to join the [[Community Of Christ|Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (RLDS, today the Community of Christ). The RLDS church initially denied that Joseph Smith Jr. had practiced polygamy and never adopted the practice.

Other doctrinal and historical legacies have also greatly impacted the development of Mormon culture. During the 19th century, Mormon converts tended to gather to a central geographic locations, a trend that reversed somewhat in the 1920s and 30s. The center of Mormon cultural influence is in [[Utah]], and North America has more Mormons than any other continent, although the majority of Mormons live outside the United States. Mormons dedicate significant time and resources to serving in their churches. A prominent practice among young and retired members of the LDS Church is to serve a full-time [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] [[Missionary (LDS Church)|mission]]. Mormons have [[Word of Wisdom|a health code]] which eschews alcoholic beverages, tobacco, "hot drinks" (later only tea and coffee), and [[Substance dependence|addictive substances]]. They tend to be very family-oriented and have strong connections across generations and with extended family, reflective of their belief that families can be [[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealed]] together beyond death. Most Mormon sects also have a strict [[law of chastity]], requiring abstention from sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage and fidelity within marriage, though the Community of Christ is accepting of [[Community of Christ#LGBT participation|LGBT individuals and relationships]]. Other Mormons may be independently religious, secular and non-practicing, or belong to [[List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement|another denomination]].

Mormons self-identify as Christian,<ref>[http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/01/Mormons-in-America.pdf Mormons in America: Certain in Their Beliefs, Uncertain of Their Place in Society] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924113625/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/01/Mormons-in-America.pdf |date=September 24, 2015 }}, Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life 2012, p.10: Mormons are nearly unanimous in describing Mormonism as a Christian religion, with 97% expressing this point of view</ref> but some non-Mormons consider Mormons to be non-Christian<ref>Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry (CARM), [https://carm.org/is-mormonism-christian Is Mormonism Christian?], accessed February 27, 2016</ref> because some of their [[Mormonism and Christianity|beliefs differ from those of mainstream Christianity]]. Mormons believe that Christ's church was [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restored]] through Joseph Smith and is guided by living [[prophet, seer, and revelator|prophets]] and [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]]. Mormons believe in the Bible, as well as other books of scripture, such as the [[Book of Mormon]]. They have a unique view of cosmology and believe that all people are spirit-children of God. Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]], and accepting his [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] through [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] such as baptism.

== Terminology ==

The word ''[[Mormon (word)#Origin of the term|Mormon]]'' was originally coined to describe any person who believes in the [[Book of Mormon]] as a volume of scripture.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mormonism |url=http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/OH/paintel2.htm#011831 |access-date=31 August 2019 |issue=2 |publisher=Painesville Telegraph |date=18 January 1831}}</ref> The term ''Mormonite'' and ''Mormon'' were originally descriptive terms used by outsiders to the faith<ref>{{cite news |title=Letter to the Editor |url=http://www.sidneyrigdon.com/dbroadhu/NY/wayn1830.htm#010631 |access-date=31 August 2019 |issue=2 |publisher=The Reflector |date=1 February 1831}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Untitled.

Today, while the term ''[[Mormonism]]'' can act as a blanket term for all sects following the religious tradition started by Joseph Smith, many sects do not prefer the term ''Mormon'' as an acceptable label. For example, the largest sect, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], based in Salt Lake City, recently clarified in a style guide that it prefers the term ''Latter-day Saints'' among other acceptable terms.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/style-guide |title = Style Guide – The Name of the Church |access-date = August 18, 2018 }}</ref><ref>On August 18, 2018, church president [[Russell M.

("Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, The", Associated Press, ''The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law'', 2002, {{ISBN|0-7382-0740-3}}, p.48) Despite the LDS Church's position, the term ''Mormon'' is widely used by journalists and non-journalists to refer to adherents of [[Mormon fundamentalism]].</ref> The second largest sect, the [[Community of Christ]], also rejects the term ''Mormon'' due to its association with the practice of polygamy among [[List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint_movement#Apostolic succession by Brigham Young|Brighamite sects]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shields|first=Steven L.|date=2014|title=The Early Community of Christ Mission to "Redeem" the Church in Utah|journal=Journal of Mormon History|volume=40|pages=158–170|via=JSTOR Journals}}</ref> Other sects, including several [[Mormon fundamentalism#Mormon fundamentalist sects|fundamentalist branches]] of the Brighamite tradition, embrace the term ''Mormon''.

== History ==
{{Main|History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

The history of the Mormons has shaped them into a people with a strong sense of unity and commonality.<ref>{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=75,119}}.</ref> From the start, Mormons have tried to establish what they call "[[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]", a utopian society of the righteous.<ref>A Mormon scripture describing the ancient city of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] became a model for the Saints. Enoch's city was a Zion "because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there were no poor among them" {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=36–38}}; ([http://churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.18?lang=eng#17 {{nowrap|Book of Moses 7:18}}]).</ref>
Mormon history can be divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of [[Joseph Smith]], (2) a "pioneer era" under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]] and his successors, and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century. In the first period, Smith attempted to build a city called Zion, in which converts could gather. During the pioneer era, Zion became a "landscape of villages" in Utah. In modern times, Zion is still an ideal, though Mormons gather together in their individual congregations rather than a central geographic location.<ref>"In Missouri and Illinois, Zion had been a city; in Utah, it was a landscape of villages; in the urban diaspora, it was the ward with its extensive programs." {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=107}}.</ref>

The Mormon movement began with the publishing of the [[Book of Mormon]] in March 1830, which Smith claimed was a translation of [[golden plates]] containing the religious history of an ancient American civilization which had been compiled by the ancient prophet-historian [[Mormon (Book of Mormon)|Mormon]].

The early church grew westward as Smith sent missionaries to proselytize.<ref>{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=41}} (by the next spring the church had 1,000 members).</ref> In 1831, the church moved to [[Kirtland, Ohio]] where missionaries had made a large number of converts<ref>{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=97}} (citing letter by Smith to Kirtland converts, quoted in {{Harvtxt|Howe|1833|p=111}});  {{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|p=41}}.</ref> and Smith began establishing an outpost in [[Jackson County, Missouri]],<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|Cowdery|Rigdon|Williams|1835|p=154}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=162}}; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=109}}.</ref> where he planned to eventually build the city of [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]] (or the [[New Jerusalem]]).<ref>Smith said in 1831 that God intended the Mormons to "retain a strong hold in the land of Kirtland, for the space of five years." ([[Doctrine and Covenants]] 64:21); {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=122}}.</ref> In 1833, Missouri settlers, alarmed by the rapid influx of Mormons, expelled them from Jackson County into the nearby [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]], where local residents were more welcoming.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=222–27}}; {{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=137}} (noting that the brutality of the Jackson Countians aroused sympathy for the Mormons and was almost universally deplored by the media); {{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1957|pp=43–45}} (The Mormons were forced out in a November gale, and were taken in by Clay County residents, who earned from non-Mormons the derogative title of "Jack Mormons").</ref>
After Smith led a mission, known as [[Zion's Camp]], to recover the land,<ref>{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|pp=141, 146–59}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=322}}.</ref> he began building [[Kirtland Temple]] in [[Lake County, Ohio]], where the church flourished.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Brodie|1971|p=101}}; {{Harvtxt|Arrington|1992|p=21}} (by summer of 1835, there were 1500 to 2000 Saints in Kirtland); Desert Morning News ''2008 Church Almanac'' p. 655 (from 1831 to 1838, church membership grew from 680 to 17,881); {{Harv|Bushman|2005|pp=310–19}} (The Kirtland Temple was viewed as the site of a new [[Pentecost]]); {{Harv|Brodie|1971|p=178}}.

[[File:Joseph Preaching to the Indians by C.C.A. Christensen.png|thumb|Joseph Smith preaching to the [[Sac and Fox Nation|Sac and Fox Indians]] who visited Nauvoo on August 12, 1841]]

In 1839, the Mormons purchased the small town of Commerce, converted swampland on the banks of the Mississippi River, and renamed the area [[Nauvoo, Illinois]],<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=383–84}}.</ref> and began construction of the [[Nauvoo Temple]].

During this time, Smith also introduced the doctrines of eternal progression or [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|exaltation]]<ref>{{Harvtxt|Widmer|2000|p=119}} (Smith taught that faithful Mormons may progress until they become co-equal with God); {{Harvtxt|Roberts|1909|pp=502–03}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=497–98}} (the [[second anointing]] provided a guarantee that participants would be exalted to godhood even if they sinned).</ref> and announced several new translation efforts, including the [[Book of Abraham]] and the [[Kinderhook plates]]. Smith created a service organization for women called the [[Relief Society]], as well as an organization called the [[Council of Fifty]], representing a future [[theodemocracy|theodemocratic]] "Kingdom of God" on the earth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Quinn|1980|pp=120–122, 165}}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=519–21}} (describing the Council of Fifty).</ref>
Smith also published an updated account of his [[First Vision]], in which he claimed that [[God the Father|Father]] and the [[Jesus|Son]] appeared to him while he was about 14 years old.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Shipps|1985|p=30}} The first extant account of the First Vision is the manuscript account in Joseph Smith, "[[Manuscript History of the Church]]" (1839); the first published account is [[Orson Pratt]], ''An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions and of the Late Discovery of Ancient American Records'' (Edinburgh: Ballantyne and Hughes, 1840); and the first American publication is Smith's [[Wentworth letter|letter to John Wentworth]] in ''[[Times and Seasons]]'', '''3''' (March 1842), 706–08.

As the LDS historian [[Richard Bushman]] wrote in his biography of Smith, "At first, Joseph was reluctant to talk about his vision. Most early converts probably never heard about the 1820 vision." {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=39}}.</ref>

In 1844, insider reports of polygamy and Smith's rapidly growing political power fueled conflicts between Mormons and "anti-Mormons".<ref>{{Harvtxt|O'Dea|1857|pp=64–67}}</ref> Smith used his political office and the [[Nauvoo_Legion|city militia]] to destroy the press of [[Nauvoo_Expositor|a newspaper]] exposing Smith's practice of polygamy, which led to Smith being arrested on charges of treason.

The suppression resulted in Smith being arrested, tried, and acquitted for "inciting a riot". On June 25, Smith let himself be arrested and tried for the riot charges again, this time in Carthage, the county seat, where he was incarcerated without bail on a new charge of treason. {{citation |contribution-url = http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/4208 |contribution = Smith, Joseph: Legal Trials of Joseph Smith |first = Joseph I. |last = Bentley |pages = 1346–1348 |editor1-last = Ludlow |editor1-first = Daniel H |editor1-link = Daniel H.

For two years after Smith's death, conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents.

=== Modern times ===
{{Further|Mormonism as a world religion}}

During the early 20th century, Mormons began to reintegrate into the American mainstream. In 1929, the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] began broadcasting a weekly performance on national radio, becoming an asset for public relations.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=103}}.</ref> Mormons emphasized patriotism and industry, rising in socioeconomic status from the bottom among American religious denominations to middle-class.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=22}}. "With the consistent encouragement of church leaders, Mormons became models of patriotic, law-abiding citizenship, sometimes seeming to "out-American" all other Americans. Their participation in the full spectrum of national, social, political, economic, and cultural life has been thorough and sincere".</ref>
In the 1920s and 1930s, Mormons began migrating out of Utah, a trend hurried by the [[Great Depression]], as Mormons looked for work wherever they could find it.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=105}}.</ref> As Mormons spread out, church leaders created programs that would help preserve the tight-knit community feel of Mormon culture.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=106}}.</ref> In addition to weekly worship services, Mormons began participating in numerous programs such as [[Scouts BSA (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouting]], a [[Young Women (organization)|Young Women organization]], church-sponsored dances, ward basketball, camping trips, plays, and [[LDS Seminaries|religious education programs]] for youth and college students.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=53}}.</ref> During the Great Depression, the church started a [[LDS Humanitarian Services|welfare program]] to meet the needs of poor members, which has since grown to include a humanitarian branch that provides relief to disaster victims.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=40–41}}.</ref>

[[File:Mtchoirandorchestra ConferenceCenter.jpg|left|thumb|The 360-member [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]]]]

During the later half of the 20th century, there was a retrenchment movement in Mormonism in which Mormons became more conservative, attempting to regain their status as a "peculiar people".<ref>The term ''peculiar people'' is consciously borrowed from [http://churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.9?lang=eng#8 1 Peter 2:9], and can be interpreted as "special" or "different", though Mormons have certainly been viewed as "peculiar" in the modern sense as well. {{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=60}}.</ref>
Though the 1960s and 1970s brought changes such as [[Women's Liberation]] and the [[civil rights movement]], Mormon leaders were alarmed by the erosion of traditional values, the [[sexual revolution]], the widespread use of recreational drugs, [[moral relativism]], and other forces they saw as damaging to the family.<ref>"Developments mitigating traditional racial, ethnic, and gender inequality and bigotry were regarded in hindsight by most Americans (and most Mormons) as desirable &nbsp;.... On the other hand, Mormons (and many others) have watched with increasing alarm the spread throughout society of 'liberating' innovations such as the normalization of non-marital sexual behavior, the rise in abortion, illegitimacy, divorce, and child neglect or abuse, recreational drugs, crime, etc." {{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=124}}.</ref>
Partly to counter this, Mormons put an even greater emphasis on family life, religious education, and missionary work, becoming more conservative in the process. As a result, Mormons today are probably less integrated with mainstream society than they were in the early 1960s.<ref>"[T]he church appears to have arrested, if not reversed, the erosion of distinctive Mormon ways that might have been anticipated in the 60s." {{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=140}}. "However, in partial contradiction to their public image, Mormons stand mostly on the liberal side of the continuum on certain other social and political issues, notably on civil rights, and even on women's rights, except where these seem to conflict with child-rearing roles." {{Harvtxt|Mauss|1994|p=156}}.</ref>

Although [[black people]] have been members of Mormon congregations since Joseph Smith's time, before 1978, black membership was small. From 1852 to 1978, the LDS Church enforced [[black people and Mormonism|a policy]] that restricted men of black African descent from being ordained to the church's lay [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]].<ref>{{Cite book |title = All Abraham's Children: Changing Mormon Conceptions of Race and Lineage |first = Armand L. |last = Mauss |pages = 213–215 |publisher = University of Illinois Press |year = 2003 |isbn = 978-0-252-02803-8 }}; {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=111–12}} ("The origins of this policy are not altogether clear.

{{Anchor|LDS}}

Members of the LDS Church, also known as Latter-day Saints, constitute over 95 percent of Mormons.<ref>As of the end of 2015, the LDS Church reported a membership of over 15 million ({{cite web |url = https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/2015-statistical-report-april-2016-general-conference |title = 2015 Statistical Report for 2016 April General Conference }}). Most other [[Brighamite|Brigham Young–lineage sects]] number in the tens of thousands. Historically, the [[Latter Day Saint  movement]] has been dominated by the LDS Church, with over 95 percent of adherents. One denomination dominates the [[Prairie Saints|non-LDS Church section of the movement]]: the [[Community of Christ]], which has about 250,000 members.)<br />Also note the use of the lower case ''d'' and hyphen in "Latter-day Saints", as opposed to the larger "Latter Day Saint movement."</ref> The beliefs and practices of LDS Mormons are generally guided by the teachings of [[general authority|LDS Church leaders]]. However, several smaller groups substantially differ from "mainstream" Mormonism in various ways.

LDS Church members who do not actively participate in worship services or church callings are often called "[[Less-active Mormon|less-active]]" or "inactive" (akin to the qualifying expressions ''non-observant'' or ''non-practicing'' used in relation to members of other religious groups).<ref name="Stack 2011-09-23">{{cite news |last = Stack |first = Peggy Fletcher |author-link = Peggy Fletcher Stack |date = September 23, 2011 |title = Active, inactive – do Mormon labels work or wound? |url = http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/lifestyle/52631643-80/mormon-church-lds-says.html.csp |newspaper = [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |access-date = September 20, 2013 }}.</ref> The LDS Church does not release statistics on church activity, but it is likely that about 40 percent of Mormons in the United States and 30 percent worldwide regularly attend worship services.<ref>Member activity rates are estimated from missionary reports, seminary and institute enrollment, and ratio of members per congregation – {{cite web |url = http://ldschurchgrowth.blogspot.com/2011/07/countries-of-world-by-estimated-member.html |title = Countries of the World by Estimated Member Activity Rate |date = July 11, 2011 |website = LDS Church Growth |access-date = November 11, 2011 }}; See also: {{cite web |url = http://rsc.byu.edu/archived/latter-day-saint-social-life-social-research-lds-church-and-its-members/8-consequential-dim |title = The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity |author = Stan L.

=== Fundamentalist Mormons ===

Members of sects that broke with the LDS Church over the issue of polygamy have become known as [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormons]]; these groups differ from mainstream Mormonism primarily in their belief in and practice of [[plural marriage]]. There are thought to be between 20,000 and 60,000 members of fundamentalist sects, (0.1–0.4 percent of Mormons), with roughly half of them practicing polygamy.<ref>Martha Sonntag Bradley, "Polygamy-Practicing Mormons" in [[J.

In addition to plural marriage, some of these groups also practice a form of Christian [[communalism]] known as the [[law of consecration]] or the [[United Order]].

=== Liberal Mormons ===
{{anchor|Liberal Mormon}}

Liberal Mormons, also known as Progressive Mormons, take an interpretive approach to LDS teachings and scripture.<ref name="Stack 2011-09-23" /> They look to the scriptures for spiritual guidance, but may not necessarily believe the teachings to be literally or uniquely true.

== Beliefs ==
{{Main|Mormonism|Mormon cosmology}}

Mormons have [[Standard Works|a scriptural canon]] consisting of the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), the [[Book of Mormon]], and a collection of revelations and writings by Joseph Smith known as the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]. Mormons, however, have a relatively [[Continuous revelation|open]] definition of [[Religious text|scripture]]. As a general rule, anything spoken or written by a [[Prophet, seer, and revelator|prophet]], while under inspiration, is considered to be the word of God.<ref>{{citation |contribution-url = http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/4172 |contribution = Scriptures: Authority of Scripture |pages = 1280–1281 |last = Jackson |first = Kent P. |author-link = Kent P.

The [[Book of Mormon]] is also believed to have been written by ancient prophets, and is viewed as a companion to the Bible. By this definition, the teachings of Smith's successors are also accepted as scripture, though they are always measured against, and draw heavily from the scriptural canon.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=25–26}}.</ref>

Mormons believe in "a friendly universe", governed by a God whose aim it is to bring his children to immortality and eternal life.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=79}}.</ref> Mormons have a unique perspective on the [[Plurality of gods|nature of God]], the origin of man, and the purpose of life. For instance, Mormons believe in a pre-mortal existence where people were literal spirit children of God,<ref name="PMGpos">{{Cite journal |title = Plan of Salvation |journal = True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference |year = 2004 |url = http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/plan-of-salvation |page = 115 }}</ref> and that God presented a [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] that would allow his children to progress and become more like him. The plan involved the spirits receiving bodies on earth and going through trials in order to learn, progress, and receive a "fulness of joy".<ref name=PMGpos /> The most important part of the plan involved [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], the eldest of God's children, coming to earth as the literal Son of God, to conquer sin and death so that God's other children could return. According to Mormons, every person who lives on earth will be resurrected, and nearly all of them will be received into various [[Degrees of glory|kingdoms of glory]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=75}}.</ref> To be accepted into the highest kingdom, a person must fully accept Christ through faith, repentance, and through [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] such as [[Baptism (Mormonism)|baptism]] and the [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|laying on of hands]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=78}}; In Mormonism, an ordinance is a formal act, in which people enter into [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenants]] with God. For example, covenants associated with baptism and the [[Eucharist]] involve taking the name of the Son upon themselves, always remembering him, and keeping his commandments; {{Cite journal |title = Atonement of Jesus Christ |journal = True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference |year = 2004 |url = http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/atonement-of-jesus-christ |page = 14 }};  {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=60–61}} Because Mormons believe that everyone must receive certain ordinances to be saved, Mormons perform vicarious ordinances such as [[baptism for the dead]] on behalf of deceased persons.

Mormons believe that God [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restored]] the [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] church through Joseph Smith. In particular, Mormons believe that [[Angel#Latter Day Saints|angels]] such as [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[John the Apostle|John]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Moses]], and [[Elijah]] appeared to Smith and others and bestowed various priesthood authorities on them. Mormons believe that their church is the "only true and living church" because of the divine authority restored through Smith. Mormons self-identify as being Christian,<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Mormonism in America |url = http://www.pewforum.org/Christian/Mormon/mormons-in-america-executive-summary.aspx |publisher = Pew Research Center |date = January 2012 }} (Mormons are nearly unanimous in describing Mormonism as a Christian religion, with 97% expressing this point of view); {{citation |author = Robinson, Stephen E. |date = May 1998 |url = http://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/new-era/1998/05/are-mormons-christians |title = Are Mormons Christians? |publisher = Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints |work = [[New Era (magazine)|New Era]] }}.</ref> while many Christians, particularly evangelical Protestants, disagree with this view.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Romney's Mormon Faith Likely a Factor in Primaries, Not in a General Election |publisher = Pew Research Center |url = http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/Romneys-Mormon-Faith-Likely-a-Factor-in-Primaries-Not-in-a-General-Election.aspx }} (About a third of Americans and half of evangelical Protestants view Mormonism as a non-Christian religion).</ref> Mormons view other religions as having portions of the truth, doing good works, and having genuine value.<ref>"Have the Presbyterians any truth? Yes. Have the Baptists, Methodists, etc., any truth? Yes. They all have a little truth mixed with error. We should gather all the good and true principles in the world and treasure them up, or we shall not come out true 'Mormons'." {{Cite journal |title = Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith |page = 316 |author = Joseph Fielding Smith |year = 1993 |title-link = Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (book) }}; Mormons take an [[Inclusivism|inclusivist]] position that their religion is correct and true but that other religions have genuine value. {{Cite book |title = Religions of the World: A Latter-day Saint View |last1 = Palmer |last2 = Keller |last3 = Choi |last4 = Toronto |publisher = Brigham Young University |year = 1997 }}.</ref>

The LDS Church has a top-down hierarchical structure with a president–prophet dictating [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelations]] for the entire church. Lay Mormons are also believed to have access to inspiration, and are encouraged to seek their own [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)#Personal revelation|personal revelations]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=54}}.</ref> Mormons see Joseph Smith's [[First Vision]] as proof that the heavens are open, and that God answers prayers. They place considerable emphasis on "asking God" to find out if something is true. Most Mormons do not claim to have had heavenly visions like Smith's in response to prayers, but feel that God talks to them in their hearts and minds through the [[Holy Ghost]]. Though Mormons have some beliefs that are considered strange in a modernized world, they continue to hold onto their beliefs because they feel God has spoken to them.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|pp=15, 35–35}} (Outside observers sometimes react to Mormonism as "nice people, wacky beliefs." Mormons insist that the "wacky" beliefs pull them together as a people and give them the strength and the know-how to succeed in the modern world).</ref>
