{{God}}
'''National gods''' are a class of guardian divinities or [[deities]] whose special concern is the safety and well-being of an ethnic group (''[[nation]]''), and of that group's leaders. This is contrasted with other guardian figures such as family gods responsible for the well-being of individual clans or professions, or personal gods who are responsible for the well-being of individuals. These guardian roles augment the functions that a divinity might otherwise have (wisdom, health, war, and so on).

==Ancient gods==
In antiquity (and to some extent continuing today), religion was a characteristic of regional culture, together with language, customs, traditions, etc. Many of these ethnic religions included national god(s) in their pantheons, such as <!-- in alphabetical order -->

==In antiquity==
In antiquity, each ethnic group (''[[nation]]'') had its own pantheon, which may or may not have [[Religious syncretism|overlapped]] with that of neighbouring groups. Many of these religions had guardian figures, which then sometimes included national gods, who were considered responsible for the safety and well-being of the nation and of its people, with a special concern for the nation's ruler and guardian. These national gods stood alongside the personal gods, that is, the patron gods who took a special interest in an individual's personal well-being. Additionally, there were the family gods associated with the care of a clan or profession, as well as gods associated with specific situations or the protection thereof (fertility, health, war, contracts and so on).

This perception of divinity was common in the ancient world. Deities were often geographically localized by association to their main cult centers, and in the Ancient Near East were often [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of their respective [[cities of the Ancient Near East|city-states]]. Many of the individual ethnic groups also considered itself the progeny of its national gods. For example, in the region that is now Yemen, the [[Sabaeans]], the [[Minaeans]] and the [[Himyar]] each perceived themselves to be the children of respectively [[Almaqah]], [[Wadd]] and [[Shamash]].<ref>{{citation|editor-last=Doniger|editor-first=Wendy|chapter=Arabian religions|title=Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of World Religions|year=1999|isbn=978-0-87779-044-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877790440}}.</ref> Similarly, in [[Canaanite religion|Canaan]], [[Milcom]] held that role for the [[Ammon|Ammonites]], while [[Chemosh]] did so for the [[Moab]].

[[Yahweh]]'s role as God of the [[Kingdom of Judah|Judaeans]] and [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samarians]] is a key reason for that figure's adoption as the [[monism|monist]] figure by the [[Deuteronomic reform|Yahweh-only movement]] of the 7th-century BC.{{fact|date=September 2019}} Yahweh's subsequent exaltation as a supreme figure occurred not because national gods were necessarily heads of their pantheons (this was certainly not the case for the national gods of the peoples surrounding Israel),<ref name="DDD" /> but as a reaction to the changing political landscape, in which other national gods had previously become exalted in that fashion.<ref name="Smith_2008" /> Because peoples were perceived to effectively worship the same gods, merely by different names (Smith (2008)<ref name="Smith_2008" /> terms this "translatability"), Yahweh's function as a national god had previously automatically equated him with other national gods. Thus, with the rise of the multi-cultural [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian Empire]] in the 10th century BC, the concomitant rise of the Assyrian's nation god Assur to inter-cultural prominence influenced how national gods were generally perceived. Moreover, the political unification of the fractured nation-states under a single supreme head of state encouraged the idea of a multi-national "one-god" worldview as well.<ref name="Smith_2008" /> By the 7th-century BC however, Assyria was in decline and the smaller nation-states began to reassert their independence. In this context, the development of a "one-god" worldview in 7th century BC [[Kingdom of Judah]] can be perceived as a response to the diminishing claims to cultural hegemony of the Assyrian "one-god" ideology of the time.<ref name="Smith_2008">{{citation|last=Smith|first=Mark S.|title=God in Translation: Deities in Cross-cultural Discourse in the Biblical World|series=Forschungen zum Alten Testament, vol. 57|location=Tübingen|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2008|isbn=978-3-16-149543-4|page=19}}.</ref> The process is evident in some parts of the [[Torah]] which predate the 6th century BC and thus preserve vestiges of the theology centered on a national god during the 10th-century BC [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|monarchic period]].<ref name="Smith_2003">{{citation|last=Smith|first=Mark S.|title=The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-516768-9|pages=155–163}}.</ref> "The OT {{bracket|{{=}}[[Old Testament]]}} is still conscious of the fact that Yhwh, the national god of Israel, originally was one of the gods in the council of El."

==Modern period==
===Philippine===
In search of a national culture and identity, away from those imposed by Spain during the 300-year Spanish-Christian colonial age, Filipino revolutionaries during the [[Philippine revolution]] proposed to revive the [[indigenous Philippine folk religions]] and make them the [[State religion|national religion]] of the entire country. The Katipunan opposed the religious teachings of the Spanish friars, saying that they "obscured rather than explained religious truths." After the revival of the Katipunan during the Spanish–American War, an idealized form of the folk religions was proposed by some, with  the worship of God under the ancient name of [[Bathala]], which applies to all supreme deities under the many ethnic pantheons in the [[Philippines]]. However, the re-vitalization process of the indigenous faiths of the Philippines did not progress further as the Filipino forces were defeated by the Americans in 1902, which led to the second Christian colonization of the archipelago.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25105201|title=The Katipunan of the Philippines|author=L. W. V. Kennon|journal=The North American Review|volume=17|issue=537|date=August 1901|pages=211, 214|publisher=University of Northern Iowa|via=[[Jstor]]}}</ref>

===Christianity===
[[Christian missionaries]] have repeatedly re-interpreted national gods in terms of the Christian God. This fact is reflected in the [[names of God]] in various languages of Christianized peoples, such as [[Shangdi]] or [[Shen (Chinese religion)|Shen]] among Chinese Christians, [[Ngai]] among a number of tribes of [[Kenya]], etc.

In a modern context, the term of a "national god" addresses the emergence of [[national church]]es within Christianity. {{citation needed|date=December 2020}} This tendency of "nationalizing" the Christian God, especially in the context of national churches sanctioning warfare against other Christian nations during [[World War I]], was denounced as heretical by [[Karl Barth]].<ref>Barth, ''Ethnics'', ed. Braun, transl. Bromiley, New York, 1981, p. 305.</ref>

===Germanic===
[[Carl Jung]] in his essay ''Wotan'' (1936) identifies the Germanic god of the storm (leader of the [[Wild Hunt]]), [[Wōden|Wotan]], as the national god of the [[German people]], and warns of the rise of [[German nationalism]] and ultimately the then-impending catastrophe of [[Nazism]] and [[World War II]] in terms of the re-awakening of this god:
:"But what is more than curious &mdash; indeed, piquant to a degree &mdash; is that an ancient god of storm and frenzy, the long quiescent Wotan, should awake, like an extinct volcano, to new activity, in a civilized country that had long been supposed to have outgrown the Middle Ages. [...] I venture the heretical suggestion that the unfathomable depths of Wotan's character explain more of National Socialism than all three reasonable factors [viz. economic, political, and psychological] put together. [...] This is a tragic experience and no disgrace. It has always been terrible to fall into the hands of a living god. [[Yahweh]] was no exception to this rule, and the Philistines, Edomites, Amorites and the rest, who were outside the Yahweh experience, must certainly have found it [[Biblical Canaanites|exceedingly disagreeable]]. The [[Arabs|Semitic]] experience of [[God in Islam|Allah]] was for a long time an extremely [[Islamic conquests|painful affair]] for the whole of Christendom. We who stand outside judge the Germans far too much, as if they were responsible agents, but perhaps it would be nearer the truth to regard them, also, as victims."<ref>First published in ''Neue Schweizer Rundschau'' (Zurich)  (March, 1936), 657-69.
