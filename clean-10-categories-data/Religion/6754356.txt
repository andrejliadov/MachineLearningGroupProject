The Diocese of Belleville finance council filed a complaint with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] alleging that Braxton had misused funds.<ref>[http://www.bnd.com/473/story/269708.html "Top nun wants papal intervention in Belleville Diocese; says it's lost trust"]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by George Pawlaczyk from the ''Belleville News-Democrat''</ref> This view was first expressed in a letter written by Sister Jan. E. Renz, the U.S. regional superior of the [[Adorers of the Blood of Christ]].

In February 2012, the Rev. William Rowe, pastor of Saint Mary's Church in [[Mount Carmel, Illinois]], resigned after Braxton expressed concern about "how Father Rowe celebrated the Mass". Following the implementation of the new English translation of the Roman Missal in late November 2011, Braxton had placed greater emphasis on following the translation exactly, but Braxton's concerns predated that translation's use, and "several meetings ... over the last five years [had] failed to resolve the bishop's concerns."<ref name="catholicregister.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicregister.org/news/international/item/13946-illinois-bishop-says-he-didnt-fire-priest-but-had-to-correct-bad-mass-wording |title=Illinois Bishop says he didn't 'fire' priest but had to correct bad Mass wording |access-date=February 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722230134/http://www.catholicregister.org/news/international/item/13946-illinois-bishop-says-he-didnt-fire-priest-but-had-to-correct-bad-mass-wording |archive-date=July 22, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Several parishioners had expressed dismay and furnished evidence about Rowe's celebration of the Mass.<ref name="catholicregister.org"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/23/rev-william-rowe-fired-catholic-priest-mass-prayers_n_1294769.html |title=Rev.
