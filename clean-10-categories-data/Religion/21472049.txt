A '''national church''' is a [[Christian church]] associated with a specific [[ethnic group]] or [[nation state]]. The idea was notably discussed during the [[Christianity in the 19th century|19th century]], during the emergence of modern [[nationalism]].

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in a draft discussing the question of [[Christianity and politics|church and state]] around 1828 wrote that 
:"a National Church might exist, and has existed, without [Christianity], because before the institution of the ''Christian'' Church - as [...] the Levitical Church in the Hebrew Constitution, [and] the [[Druidical]] in the Celtic, would suffice to prove".<ref>Samuel Taylor Coleridge. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AkiXWLPqoi8C On the Constitution of the Church and State]''. Classic Books Company; 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-7426-8368-6}}. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AkiXWLPqoi8C&pg=PA59 59].</ref>

[[John Wordsworth]], Bishop of Salisbury, wrote about the National Church of Sweden in 1911, interpreting the [[Church of Sweden]] and the [[Church of England]] as national churches of the Swedish and the English peoples, respectively. Lake (1987) traces the development of [[Presbyterianism]] in 16th-century England from the status of a "godly minority" which saw itself surrounded by the corrupt or hostile mass of the population, into a "genuine national church".<ref>Peter Lake, [[Maria Dowling]], ''Protestantism and the national church in sixteenth century England'', Taylor & Francis, 1987, ISBN, 9780709916819, ch. 8 (193ff.)</ref>

The concept of a national church remains alive in the Protestantism of England and Scandinavia in particular. While, in a context of England, the national church remains a common denominator for the Church of England, some of the Lutheran "'''folk churches'''" of Scandinavia, characterized as national churches in the ethnic sense as opposed to the idea of a state church, emerged in the second half of the 19th century following the lead of [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]].<ref>Dag Thorkildsen, "Scandinavia: Lutheranism and national identity" in ''World Christianities, c. 1815-1914'', vol. 8 of ''The Cambridge history of Christianity'', eds. Sheridan Gilley, Brian Stanley, Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81456-0}}, pp. 342–358.</ref> However, in countries in which the state church (also known as the established church) has the following of the majority of citizens, the state church may also be the national church, and may be declared as such by the government, e.g. [[Church of Denmark]],<ref name="Shadid1995">{{cite book|last=Shadid|first=W. A. R.|title=Religious Freedom and the Position of Islam in Western Europe|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Peeters Publishers|isbn=9789039000656|page=11|quote=Denmark has declared the Evangelical Lutheran church to be that national church (par. 4 of the Constitution), which corresponds the fact that 91.5% of the population are registered members of this church. This declaration implies that the Danish State does not take a neutral stand in religious matters. Nevertheless, freedom of religion has been incorporated in the Constitution. Nielsen (1992, 77) gives a short description of the position of the minority religious communities in comparison to that of the State Church: The Lutheran established church is a department of the state. Church affairs are government by a central government ministry, and clergy are government employees. The registration of births, deaths and marriages falls under this ministry of church affairs, and normally speaking the local Lutheran pastor is also the official registrar. The other small religious communities, viz. Roman Catholics, Methodists, Baptists and Jews, have the constitutional status of 'recognised communities of faith'. ... Contrary to the minority religious communities, the Lutheran Church is fully financed by the Danish State.}}</ref> [[Church of Greece]],<ref name="EnyediMadeley2004">{{cite book|last1=Enyedi|first1=Zsolt|last2=Madeley|first2=John T.S.|title=Church and State in Contemporary Europe|date=2 August 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135761417|page=228|quote=Both as a state church and as a national church, the Orthodox Church of Greece has a lot in common with Protestant state churches, and even with Catholicism in some countries.}}</ref> and [[Church of Iceland]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Protestantism|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816069835|page=283|quote=When Iceland obtained home rule in 1874, the new constitution, while granting religious freedom, maintained the Evangelical Lutheran Church as "a national church . . . supported by the State." This was reaffirmed in the 1944 constitution of the new independent Republic of Iceland. Democratic reforms were adopted early in the 20th century that allowed for some independent decision making in parish councils, and let congregations choose their own pastors. Under a 1998 law, the church became largely autonomous, though it is still designated established church, supported by government taxes. At the end of the 19th century, Lutherans who wanted freedom from the state church founded the Evangelical Free Church of Iceland, which now has in excess of 7,000 members. The majority of Icelanders are members of the state church. Almost all children are baptized as Lutheran and more than 90 percent are subsequently confirmed. The Church conducts 75 percent of all marriages and 99 percent of all funerals.}}</ref>
