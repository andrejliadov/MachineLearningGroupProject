An '''edict of toleration''' is a declaration, made by a government or ruler, and states that members of a given [[religion]] will not be persecuted for engaging in their religious practices and traditions. The edict implies tacit acceptance of the religion rather than its endorsement by the ruling power.

== Edicts of toleration in history ==

===Ancient times===
* 539 BCE – The [[Cyrus Cylinder]], a clay document issued by Achaemenid [[Persia]]n monarch [[Cyrus the Great]] declaring the restoration of the cult of [[Marduk]] in [[Babylon]] and the restorations of the temples of many peoples, including the [[Jews]].
* 311 CE – The [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius]] was issued in 311 by the Roman Tetrarchy of Galerius, Constantine and Licinius, officially ending the [[Diocletian]] persecution of Christianity.
* 313 – Roman Emperors [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]] issued the [[Edict of Milan]] that legalized Christianity across the whole [[Imperium Romanum|Empire]].
* 361 or 362 – [[Julian the Apostate]], Roman emperor, issued a new [[Julian (emperor)#Restoration of Paganism as state religion|edict]] that legalized / recognized all forms of Christianity, as well as Judaism and Paganism, across his empire.

===Middle Ages===
* 1436 – The [[Compacts of Basel]] (valid for the [[Crown of Bohemia]], previously declared in 1420 and approved by the [[Council of Basle]] in 1433) were formally accepted by Catholics and Utraquists (moderate [[Hussites]]) at an assembly in Jihlava and agreed by King and Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], introducing a limited toleration and stating that "the word of God is to be freely and truthfully preached by the priests of the Lord, and by worthy deacons"

===Early modern period===
* 1562 – The [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] was an edict of limited toleration issued by [[Catherine de' Medici]] (the [[regent]] for the young [[Charles IX of France]]) that ended insistent persecution of non-Catholics (mostly [[Huguenots]]).  The persecution was a result of the [[Concordat of Bologna]] (1516). A massacre of Huguenots a few weeks later began open hostilities in the [[French Wars of Religion]] (1562–1598).
* 1568 – The [[Edict of Torda]] (or Turda), also known as the Patent of Toleration (Act of Religious Tolerance and Freedom of Conscience), was an attempt by King [[John II Sigismund Zápolya|John II Sigismund]] of [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom|Hungary]] to guarantee religious freedom in his realm. Specifically, it broadened previous grants (to Roman Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists) to include the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarian Church]], and allowed toleration (not legal guarantees) for other faiths.
* 1573 – The [[Warsaw Confederation]] made all Christian confessions equal in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]
* 1579 – The [[Union of Utrecht]] included a decree of toleration allowing personal freedom of religion. An additional declaration allowed provinces and cities that wished to remain Catholic to join the Union.
* 1598 – The [[Edict of Nantes]], issued by the [[King of France]], [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], was the formal religious settlement which ended the first era of the French Wars of Religion. The Edict granted to French [[Huguenots]] legal recognition as well as limited religious freedoms, including: freedom of public worship, the right of assembly, rights of admission to public offices and universities, and permission to maintain fortified towns. The Edict of Nantes, however, would be revoked in 1685 by Henry IV's grandson, [[Louis XIV]], who once again proclaimed Protestantism to be illegal in France through the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]].
* 1609 – The [[Letter of Majesty]] by King of Bohemia and Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], valid for the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and [[Duchies of Silesia]], introducing freedom of religion and religious toleration for all (including non-privileged classes, i.e. peasants etc.)
* 1649 – [[Maryland Toleration Act]] in the early American colony [[Province of Maryland]], also known as the Act Concerning Religion, was passed by Maryland's colonial assembly mandating religious tolerance for Catholicism. It was the second law requiring religious tolerance in the [[British North American colonies]] and created the first legal limitations on [[hate speech]] in the world. The Calvert family, who founded Maryland partly as a refuge for [[English Catholics]], sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and those of other religions that did not conform to the dominant [[Anglicanism]] of Britain and her colonies. The Act was revoked in 1654, before being reinstated again, and finally, repealed permanently in 1692 following the [[Glorious Revolution]]. The Maryland Toleration Act influenced related laws in other colonies and was an important predecessor to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which enshrined religious freedom in American law over a century later.
* 1664 – Edict of Toleration in the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] (now in [[Germany]]), tolerance of the Protestant denominations with each other
* 1685 – [[Edict of Potsdam]], for reform of Huguenots in Lutheran [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian Kingdom]]
* 1689 – [[Parliament]] in [[England]] passes the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]] protecting [[Protestants]] with [[Roman Catholics]] intentionally excluded
* 1692 – The [[Kangxi Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] issued the [[Chinese Rites controversy#Reception in China|Chinese Edict of Toleration]] on 22 March,<ref>{{Citation
