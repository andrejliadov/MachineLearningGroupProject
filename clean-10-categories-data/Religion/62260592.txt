'''Māori identity''' is the objective or subjective state of [[Identity (social science)|perceiving oneself]] as a [[Māori people|Māori person]] and as relating to being Māori ([[Māoriness]]). The most commonly cited central pillar of Māori identity is [[whakapapa]] (genealogy),<ref>{{cite book|title=Women's Studies Journal |edition=Volumes 20–21|date=2009|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|quote=Knowledge of one's whakapapa and ancestral links is at the root of Maori identity and heritage}}</ref> which in its most literal sense requires blood-ancestry to Māori people.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Joanna Kidman|title=Engaging with Maori communities: an exploration of some tensions in the mediation of social sciences research|date=2007|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0958261067|quote=However, whakapapa is the basis for Maori identity, and whakapapa in its strictest genealogical sense, requires a blood-link to a Maori ancestor.}}</ref>

==Overview==
[[Witi Ihimaera]], the first published Maori novelist, has described its connection as follows: "For many Maori, the key to their cultural or ethnic identity as Maori lies in whakapapa, that mystical element that forever links Maori, through their tipuna, to this land".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Witi Ihimaera|author-link1=Witi Ihimaera|title=Growing up Maori|date=1998|publisher=Tandem Press|isbn=978-1877178160}}</ref> Alternatively, [[Peeni Henare]] has criticised blood quantum factors in relation to Māori identity, suggesting it is an attack on the identity of urban Māori and non-[[Māori language|Māori]]-speakers.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2019/05/15/585542/room-for-kumara-and-potato-at-table-of-identity# |title=Room for kumara and potato at table of identity |author=Rawiri Taonui|date=15 May 2019|work=[[Newsroom (website)|Newsroom]]}}</ref>

Colloquially, [[Taha Māori]] (the Māori perspective) is used closely in association with the identity of Māori people.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://gisborneherald.co.nz/localnews/4263106-135/hospital-weekly-waiata-like-having-our |title=Hospital weekly waiata 'like having our own marae' |author=Maika Akroyd |date=12 September 2019|work=[[Gisborne Herald]]}}</ref> Māori identity can be defined independently of [[religious identity]]; Māori are a diverse group in terms of religious affiliations, including [[Māori_religion#Christianity|Māori Christians]] and [[Māori Muslims]], as well as followers of the traditional Māori belief system. In [[Māori mythology]], the indigenous faith carried largely unchanged to [[Aotearoa]] from the tropical Eastern [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] homeland [[Hawaiki|Hawaiki Nui]].

Local government in the [[Auckland Region]] actively promotes its growth, stating that "Using Māori names for roads, buildings and other public places is an opportunity to publicly demonstrate Māori identity".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/articles/news/2019/08/new-maori-and-indian-street-names-in-puketapapa/ |title=New Māori and Indian street names in Puketāpapa |quote=Using Māori names for roads, buildings and other public places is an opportunity to publicly demonstrate Māori identity.

Academic research examining Māori cultural and racial identity has been conducted since the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=James H.

Community work in New Zealand has identified males struggling with their Māori identity, often also living by [[Māori_language#Calendar|Māori lunar calendar]], as a significant suicide risk.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://gisborneherald.co.nz/localnews/4152346-135/rangatahi-tackle-some-tough-subjects-in |title=Rangatahi tackle some tough subjects in Nga Manu Korero|date=20 June 2019|work=[[Gisborne Herald]]}}</ref> In 2015, ''The Guardian'' covered a crisis of Māori incarceration and identity in relation to the New Zealand prison system.
