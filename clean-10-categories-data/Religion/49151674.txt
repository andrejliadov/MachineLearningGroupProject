'''Hesby Church''' ({{lang-no|Hesby kyrkje}}) is a [[parish church]] of the [[Church of Norway]] in the large [[Stavanger Municipality]] in [[Rogaland]] county, [[Norway]]. It is located in the village of [[Hesby]] on the island of [[Finnøy (island)|Finnøy]]. It is the church for the Hesby [[parish]] which is part of the [[Tungenes prosti]] ([[deanery]]) in the [[Diocese of Stavanger]]. The old, stone church was built in a [[Churches in Norway#Floor plan|long church]] design around the year 1090 using designs by an unknown [[architect]]. The church seats about 230 people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hesby kyrkje |url=https://kirkesok.no/kirke/114100201 |access-date=2020-10-18 |publisher=Kirkesøk: Kirkebyggdatabasen}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Oversikt over Nåværende Kirker |url=http://www.kirkekonsulenten.no/kirker.htm |access-date=2020-10-18 |publisher=KirkeKonsulenten.no |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

==History==
The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1296, but the church was likely built during the early 12th century. Tradition says that the church was founded in the 1090s. Hesby was the seat of chiefs during the 11th century and during the [[Middle Ages]] was the residence of several notable [[Lendmann|Lendmenn]]. The church walls are about {{convert|1|m|adj=on}} thick. The stone church has a rectangular [[nave]] and a narrower, rectangular [[chancel]]. A large tower with a [[steeple]] on the west end of the building was removed during the early 1800s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hesby kyrkjestad |url=https://kulturminnesok.no/minne/?queryString=https://data.kulturminne.no/askeladden/lokalitet/84567 |access-date=2020-10-18 |publisher=[[Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref>
