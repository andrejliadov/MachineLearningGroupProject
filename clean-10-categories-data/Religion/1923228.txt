{{humanism}}

The '''Ethical movement''', also referred to as the '''Ethical Culture movement''', '''Ethical Humanism''' or simply '''Ethical Culture''', is an [[ethical]], [[educational]], and [[religion|religious]] movement that is usually traced back to [[Felix Adler (professor)|Felix Adler]] (1851–1933).<ref name=BK>[https://books.google.com/books?id=x2nYAAAAMAAJ From Reform Judaism to ethical culture: the religious evolution of Felix Adler] Benny Kraut, Hebrew Union College Press, 1979</ref> Individual chapter organizations are generically referred to as "Ethical Societies", though their names may include "Ethical Society", "Ethical Culture Society", "Society for Ethical Culture", "Ethical Humanist Society", or other variations on the theme of "Ethical".

The Ethical movement is an outgrowth of secular moral traditions in the 19th century, principally in Europe and the United States. While some in this movement went on to organise for a [[secular humanism|non-congregational secular humanist movement]], others attempted to build a secular moral movement that was emphatically "religious" in its approach to developing humanist ethical codes, in the sense of encouraging congregational structures and religious rites and practices. While in the United States, these movements formed as separate education organisations (the [[American Humanist Association]] and the American Ethical Union), the American Ethical Union's British equivalents, the South Place Ethical Society and the British Ethical Union consciously moved away from a congregational model to become [[Conway Hall Ethical Society|Conway Hall]] and [[Humanists UK]] respectively. Subsequent "godless" congregational movements include the [[Sunday Assembly]], whose London chapter has used Conway Hall as a venue since 2013.

At the international level, Ethical Culture and secular humanist groups have always organised jointly; the American Ethical Union and British Ethical Union were founding members of [[Humanists International]], whose original name "International Humanist and Ethical Union" reflected the movement's unity.

Ethical Culture is premised on the idea that honoring and living in accordance with ''ethical principles'' is central to what it takes to live meaningful and fulfilling lives, and to creating a world that is good for all. Practitioners of Ethical Culture focus on supporting one another in becoming better people, and on doing good in the world.<ref name=BD/><ref name=Deed/>

==History==
===Background===
The Ethical movement was an outgrowth of the general loss of faith among the intellectuals of the [[Victorian era]]. A precursor to the doctrines of the ethical movement can be found in the [[South Place Ethical Society]], founded in 1793 as the [[South Place Chapel]] on [[Finsbury Square]], on the edge of the [[City of London]].<ref>[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/4C693561-BCDF-4A35-9EF9-2591DC0C064A/0/DP_PL_FinsburyCircusAppendixA.pdf City of London page on Finsbury Circus Conservation Area Character Summary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008174243/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/4C693561-BCDF-4A35-9EF9-2591DC0C064A/0/DP_PL_FinsburyCircusAppendixA.pdf |date=8 October 2006 }}</ref>

[[File:Fabian society 1886.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Fabian Society]] was an outgrowth from the [[Fellowship of the New Life]].]]
In the early nineteenth century, the chapel became known as "a radical gathering-place".<ref>''The Sexual Contract'', by Carole Patema. P160</ref> At that point it was a [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|Unitarian]] chapel, and that movement, like Quakers, supported female equality.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.keele.ac.uk/history/currentundergraduates/tltp/WOMEN/RENDELL/CORE1.HTM#Title |title="Women's Politics in Britain 1780-1870: Claiming Citizenship" by Jane Rendall, esp.

In later decades, the chapel moved away from Unitarianism, changing its name first to the South Place Religious Society, then the South Place Ethical Society (a name it held formally, though it was better known as Conway Hall from 1929) and is now [[Conway Hall Ethical Society]].

The [[Fellowship of the New Life]] was established in 1883 by the Scottish intellectual [[Thomas Davidson (philosopher)|Thomas Davidson]].<ref>{{cite web|first=James A.|last=Good|url=http://www.autodidactproject.org/other/TD.html|title=The Development of Thomas Davidson's Religious and Social Thought}}</ref> Fellowship members included poets [[Edward Carpenter]] and [[John Davidson (poet)|John Davidson]], animal rights activist [[Henry Stephens Salt]],<ref>George Hendrick, ''Henry Salt: Humanitarian Reformer and Man of Letters'', University of Illinois Press, pg. 47 (1977).</ref> sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]], feminist [[Edith Ellis|Edith Lees]] (who later married Ellis), novelist [[Olive Schreiner]]<ref>[[Jeffrey Weeks (sociologist)|Jeffrey Weeks]], ''Making Sexual History'', Wiley-Blackwell, pg. 20, (2000).</ref> and [[Edward R. Pease]].

Its objective was "The cultivation of a perfect character in each and all." They wanted to transform society by setting an example of clean simplified living for others to follow. Davidson was a major proponent of a structured philosophy about [[religion]], [[ethics]], and [[social reform]].<ref>Knight, William. ''Memorials of Thomas Davidson''.(Boston: Ginn & Company, 1907), 18</ref>

At a meeting on 16 November 1883, a summary of the society's goals was drawn up by Maurice Adams:

{{quote|We, recognizing the evils and wrongs that must beset men so long as our social life is based upon selfishness, rivalry, and ignorance, and desiring above all things to supplant it by a life based upon unselfishness, love, and wisdom, unite, for the purpose of realizing the higher life among ourselves, and of inducing and enabling others to do the same.

And we now form ourselves into a Society, to be called the Guild [Fellowship] of the New Life, to carry out this purpose.<ref>Knight, William. ''Memorials of Thomas Davidson''.(Boston: Ginn & Company, 1907), 19</ref>}}

Although the Fellowship was a short-lived organization, it spawned the [[Fabian Society]], which split in 1884 from the Fellowship of the New Life.<ref name=knight>William A. Knight, ''Memorials of Thomas Davidson: The Wandering Scholar'' (Boston and London: Ginn and Co, 1907). p. 16, 19, 46.</ref><ref name=pease>{{cite book|last = Pease| first = Edward R.| title = The History of the Fabian Society| publisher = E.P.

===Ethical movement===
[[File:Felix-Adler-Hine.jpeg|thumb|[[Felix Adler (professor)|Felix Adler]], founder of the ethical movement.]]
In his youth, Felix Adler was being trained to be a rabbi like his father, [[Samuel Adler (rabbi)|Samuel Adler]], the rabbi of the [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] [[Congregation Emanu-El of New York|Temple Emanu-El]] in New York. As part of his education, he enrolled at the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he was influenced by [[neo-Kantian]] philosophy. He was especially drawn to the Kantian ideas that one could not prove the existence or non-existence of deities or immortality and that morality could be established independently of theology.<ref name=Radest>Howard B. Radest. 1969. ''Toward Common Ground: The Story of the Ethical Societies in the United States.''  New York: Fredrick Unger Publishing Co.</ref>

During this time he was also exposed to the moral problems caused by the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of women and labor.  These experiences laid the intellectual groundwork for the ethical movement.  Upon his return from Germany, in 1873, he shared his ethical vision with his father's congregation in the form of a sermon. Due to the negative reaction he elicited it became his first and last sermon as a rabbi in training.<ref name=Campbell>Colin Campbell. 1971. ''Towards a Sociology of Irreligion.'' London: MacMillan Press.</ref> Instead he took up a professorship at [[Cornell University]] and in 1876 gave a follow up sermon that led to the 1877 founding of the '''New York Society for Ethical Culture''', which was the first of its kind.<ref name=Radest/> By 1886, similar societies had sprouted up in Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis.<ref name=Campbell/>

These societies all adopted the same statement of principles:
*The belief that morality is independent of theology;
*The affirmation that new moral problems have arisen in modern industrial society which have not been adequately dealt with by the world's religions;
*The duty to engage in philanthropy in the advancement of morality;
*The belief that self-reform should go in lock step with social reform;
*The establishment of republican rather than monarchical governance of Ethical societies
*The agreement that educating the young is the most important aim.
In effect, the movement responded to the religious crisis of the time by replacing theology with unadulterated morality. It aimed to "disentangle moral ideas from [[religious doctrines]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] systems, and ethical theories, and to make them an independent force in personal life and social relations."<ref name=Campbell/> Adler was also particularly critical of the religious emphasis on [[creed]], believing it to be the source of [[sectarian]] [[bigotry]].  He therefore attempted to provide a universal fellowship devoid of ritual and ceremony, for those who would otherwise be divided by creeds. For the same reasons the movement also adopted a neutral position on religious beliefs, advocating neither [[atheism]] nor [[theism]], [[agnosticism]] nor [[deism]].<ref name=Campbell/>

[[File:Ethical Culture Society & school jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Ethical Culture School (red) and Ethical Culture Society (white) buildings.]]

The Adlerian emphasis on "deed not creed" translated into several public service projects.  The year after it was founded, the New York society started a kindergarten, a district nursing service and a tenement-house building company. Later they opened the [[Ethical Culture School]], then called the "Workingman's School," a Sunday school and a summer home for children, and other Ethical societies soon followed suit with similar projects.  Unlike the philanthropic efforts of the established religious institutions of the time, the Ethical societies did not attempt to proselytize those they helped.  In fact, they rarely attempted to convert anyone.  New members had to be sponsored by existing members, and women were not allowed to join at all until 1893.  They also resisted formalization, though nevertheless slowly adopted certain traditional practices, like Sunday meetings and life cycle ceremonies, yet did so in a modern humanistic context.  In 1893, the four existing societies unified under the umbrella organization, the '''American Ethical Union'''.<ref name=Campbell/>

After some initial success the movement stagnated until after [[World War II]]. In 1946 efforts were made to revitalize and societies were created in New Jersey and Washington D.C., along with the inauguration of the [[Encampment for Citizenship]]. By 1968 there were thirty societies with a total national membership of over 5,500. However, the resuscitated movement differed from its predecessor in a few ways. The newer groups were being created in suburban locales and often to provide alternative [[Sunday schools]] for children, with adult activities as an afterthought.

There was also a greater focus on organization and bureaucracy, along with an inward turn emphasizing the needs of the group members over the more general social issues that had originally concerned Adler. The result was a transformation of American ethical societies into something much more akin to small [[Christianity|Christian]] congregations in which the [[minister (Christianity)|minister]]'s most pressing concern is to tend to his or her flock.<ref name=Campbell/>

In the 21st century, the movement continued to revitalize itself through social media and involvement with other Humanist organizations, with mixed success. As of 2014, there were fewer than 10,000 official members of the Ethical movement.<ref name="Stedman">Stedman, Chris (1 October 2014).

===In Britain===
[[File:Stanton Coit 001.jpg|thumb|[[Stanton Coit]] led the ethical movement in Britain.]]
In 1885 the ten-year-old American Ethical Culture movement helped to stimulate similar social activity in Great Britain, when American sociologist John Graham Brooks distributed pamphlets by Chicago ethical society leader [[William Mackintire Salter|William Salter]] to a group of British philosophers, including [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], [[John Henry Muirhead]], and John Stuart MacKenzie.

One of Felix Adler's colleagues, [[Stanton Coit]], visited them in London to discuss the "aims and principles" of their American counterparts. In 1886 the first British ethical society was founded. Coit took over the leadership of South Place for a few years. Ethical societies flourished in Britain. By 1896 the four London societies formed the Union of Ethical Societies, and between 1905 and 1910 there were over fifty societies in Great Britain, seventeen of which were affiliated with the Union. Part of this rapid growth was due to Coit, who left his role as leader of South Place in 1892 after being denied the power and authority he was vying for.

Because he was firmly entrenched in British ethicism, Coit remained in London and formed the West London Ethical Society, which was almost completely under his control. Coit worked quickly to shape the West London society not only around Ethical Culture but also the trappings of religious practice, renaming the society in 1914 to the Ethical Church. He transformed his meetings into services, and their space into something akin to a church. In a series of books Coit also began to argue for the transformation of the [[Anglican Church]] into an Ethical Church, while holding up the virtue of ethical ritual.  He felt that the Anglican Church was in the unique position to harness the natural moral impulse that stemmed from society itself, as long as the Church replaced [[theology]] with science, abandoned supernatural beliefs, expanded its bible to include a cross-cultural selection of ethical literature and reinterpreted its creeds and liturgy in light of modern ethics and [[psychology]].  His attempt to reform the Anglican church failed, and ten years after his death in 1944, the Ethical Church building was sold to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].<ref name=Campbell/>

During Stanton Coit's lifetime, the Ethical Church never officially affiliated with the Union of Ethical Societies, nor did South Place. In 1920 the Union of Ethical Societies changed its name to the Ethical Union.<ref name=MacKillip>I.D. MacKillop. 1986. ''The British Ethical Societies''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref> [[Harold Blackham]], who had taken over leadership of the London Ethical Church, consciously sought to remove the church-like trappings of the Ethical movement, and advocated a simple creed of humanism that was not akin to a religion. He promoted the merger of the Ethical Union with the [[Rationalist Press Association]] and the South Place Ethical Society, and, in 1957, a Humanist Council was set up to explore amalgamation. Although issues over charitable status prevented a full amalgamation, the Ethical Union under Blackham changed its name in 1967 to become the [[British Humanist Association]] &ndash; establishing humanism as the principle organising force for non-religious morals and secularist advocacy in Britain. The BHA was the legal successor body to the Union of Ethical Societies.<ref name=bha>[https://humanism.org.uk/about/our-history-since-1896/ British Humanist Association: Our History since 1896]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ik5sfyeC?url=https://humanism.org.uk/about/our-history-since-1896/ |date=9 August 2013 }}</ref>

Between 1886 and 1927 seventy-four ethical societies were started in Great Britain, although this rapid growth did not last long.  The numbers declined steadily throughout the 1920s and early 30s, until there were only ten societies left in 1934. By 1954 there were only four. The situation became such that in 1971, sociologist Colin Campbell even suggested that one could say, "that when the South Place Ethical Society discussed changing its name to the South Place Humanist society in 1969, the English ethical movement ceased to exist."<ref name=Campbell/>

The organisations spawned by the 19th century Ethical movement would later live on as the British humanist movement. The South Place Ethical Society eventually changed its name Conway Hall Ethical Society, after [[Moncure D. Conway]], and is typically known as simply "Conway Hall". In 2017, the British Humanist Association again changed its name, becoming [[Humanists UK]]. Both organisations are part of [[Humanists International]], which had been founded by Harold Blackham in 1952 as the International Humanist and Ethical Union.

==Ethical perspective==
[[File:William H Childs house.jpg|thumb|Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture building on Prospect Park West, originally designed by architect [[William Tubby]] as a home for William H. Childs (inventor of [[Bon Ami|Bon Ami Cleaning Powder]])]]
{{Primary sources|date=February 2011}}
While Ethical Culturists generally share common beliefs about what constitutes ethical behavior and the [[Goodness and value theory|good]], individuals are encouraged to develop their own personal understanding of these ideas. This does not mean that Ethical Culturists condone [[moral relativism]], which would relegate ethics to mere preferences or social conventions. Ethical principles are viewed as being related to deep truths about the way the world works, and hence not arbitrary. However, it is recognized that complexities render the understanding of ethical nuances subject to continued [[dialogue]], exploration, and learning.

While the founder of Ethical Culture, Felix Adler, was a [[transcendentalist]], Ethical Culturists may have a variety of understandings as to the theoretical origins of ethics. Key to the founding of Ethical Culture was the observation that too often disputes over religious or philosophical [[doctrine]]s have distracted people from actually living ethically and doing good. Consequently, ''"Deed before [[creed]]"'' has long been a [[motto]] of the movement.<ref name=Deed>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_j0rAAAAYAAJ The conservator, Volumes 3-4], Horace Traubel, Volume 3, page 31</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=eCFIAAAAMAAJ&q=deed+not+creed#search_anchor Ethics as a Religion], David Saville Muzzey, 273 pages, 1951, 1967, 1986</ref>

== Organisational model ==
[[File:Back pews & stained glass NYSEC Concert hall jeh.jpg|thumb|Pews and stained glass]]
Functionally, the Ethical Societies were organised in a similar manner to [[Church (building)|church]]es or [[synagogue]]s and are headed by "leaders" as [[clergy]]. Their founders had suspected this would be a successful model for spreading secular morality. As a result, an Ethical Society typically would have Sunday morning meetings, offer moral instruction for children and teens, and do charitable work and social action. They may offer a variety of educational and other programs. They conduct [[wedding]]s, [[Domestic partnership|commitment ceremonies]], baby namings, and [[funeral|memorial service]]s.

Individual Ethical Society members may or may not believe in a [[deity]] or regard Ethical Culture as their religion. Felix Adler said "Ethical Culture is religious to those who are religiously minded, and merely ethical to those who are not so minded."  The movement does consider itself a religion in the sense that

{{quote |Religion is that set of beliefs and/or institutions, behaviors and emotions which bind human beings to something beyond their individual selves and foster in its adherents a sense of humility and gratitude that, in turn, sets the tone of one’s world-view and requires certain behavioral dispositions relative to that which transcends personal interests.<ref>Arthur Dobrin, quoted in [http://aeu.org/library/display_article.php?article_id=5 "Ethical Culture as Religion"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112161255/http://aeu.org/library/display_article.php?article_id=5 |date=12 November 2013 }}, Jone Johnson Lewis, 2003, American Ethical Union Library</ref>}}

The Ethical Culture 2003 ethical identity statement states:

{{quote |It is a chief belief of Ethical religion that if we relate to others in a way that brings out their best, we will at the same time elicit the best in ourselves.  By the "best" in each person, we refer to his or her unique talents and abilities that affirm and nurture life. We use the term "spirit" to refer to a person’s unique personality and to the love, hope, and empathy that exists in human beings. When we act to elicit the best in others, we encourage the growing edge of their ethical development, their perhaps as-yet untapped but inexhaustible worth.}}

Since around 1950 the Ethical Culture movement has been increasingly identified as part of the modern [[Humanism|Humanist]] movement. Specifically, in 1952, the [[American Ethical Union]], the national umbrella organization for Ethical Culture societies in the [[United States]], became one of the founding member organizations of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]].

In the United Kingdom, the ethical societies consciously rejected the "church model" in the mid-20th century, while still providing services like weddings, funerals, and namings on a secular basis.

==Key ideas==
While Ethical Culture does not regard its founder's views as necessarily the final word, [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Adler]] identified focal ideas that remain important within Ethical Culture. These ideas include:

* ''Human Worth and Uniqueness'' – All people are taken to have inherent worth, not dependent on the value of what they do. They are deserving of respect and dignity, and their unique gifts are to be encouraged and celebrated.<ref name =BD/>
* ''Eliciting the Best'' – "Always act so as to Elicit the best in others, and thereby yourself" is as close as Ethical Culture comes to having a [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]].<ref name=BD>{{citation | series = Books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hz8OAAAAQAAJ | title = Biographical dictionary of twentieth-century philosophers | contribution = Adler | page = 7 | first1 = Stuart C | last1 = Brown | first2 = Diané | last2 = Collinson|isbn = 9780415060431|year = 1996}}</ref>
* ''Interrelatedness'' – Adler used the term ''The Ethical Manifold'' to refer to his conception of the universe as made up of myriad unique and indispensable moral agents (individual human beings), each of whom has an inestimable influence on all the others. In other words, we are all interrelated, with each person playing a role in the whole and the whole affecting each person. Our interrelatedness is at the heart of ethics.

Many Ethical Societies prominently display a sign that says "The Place Where People Meet to Seek the Highest is Holy Ground".<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.paulgoldberger.com/lectures/46 | title = Architecture, Sacred Space, and the Challenge of the Modern | first = Paul | last = Goldberger | publisher = Chautauqua Institution | date = 12 August 2010 | access-date = 3 March 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715053316/http://www.paulgoldberger.com/lectures/46 | archive-date = 15 July 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

==Locations==
The largest concentration of Ethical Societies is in the [[New York City|New York]] metropolitan area, including Societies in New York, [[Manhattan]], the Bronx,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rysec.org |title=Riverdale Yonkers Society for Ethical Culture |publisher=Rysec.org |date=2012-08-24 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}</ref> [[Brooklyn]], Queens, Westchester and Nassau County; and [[New Jersey]], such as [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]] and Essex Counties, New Jersey.<ref>[http://aeu.org/index.php?case=members Ethical Societies].</ref><ref>[http://www.ethicalfocus.org Bergen, NJ Society]</ref>

Ethical Societies exist in several U.S. cities and counties, including [[Austin, Texas]]; [[Baltimore]]; [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]]; [[Asheville, North Carolina]]; [[Chicago]]; [[San Jose, California]]; [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]; [[St. Peters, Missouri]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]; [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]], and [[Vienna, Virginia]].

Ethical Societies also exist outside the U.S. Conway Hall in [[London]] is home to the [[South Place Ethical Society]], which was founded in 1787.<ref>South Place Ethical Society, [http://www.ethicalsoc.org.uk/spes/about About the Society] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129003230/http://www.ethicalsoc.org.uk/spes/about |date=29 November 2011 }}.</ref>

==Structure and events==
Ethical societies are typically led by "Leaders." Leaders are trained and certified (the equivalent of ordination) by the American Ethical Union.  Societies engage Leaders, in much the same way that Protestant congregations "call" a minister. Not all Ethical societies have a professional Leader. (In typical usage, the Ethical Movement uses upper case to distinguish certified professional Leaders from other leaders.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aeu.org/meet-our-leaders/|website=American Ethical Union|publisher=American Ethical Union|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref> A board of executives handles day-to-day affairs, and committees of members focus on specific activities and involvements of the society.

Ethical societies usually hold weekly meetings on Sundays, with the main event of each meeting being the "Platform", which involves a half-hour speech by the Leader of the Ethical Society, a member of the society or by guests. [[Sunday school]] for minors is also held at most ethical societies concurrent with the Platform.

The American Ethical Union holds an annual AEU Assembly bringing together Ethical societies from across the US.

==Legal challenges==
The tax status of Ethical Societies as religious organizations has been upheld in court cases in Washington, D.C. (1957), and in Austin, Texas (2003). In challenge to a denial of tax-exempt status, the [[Texas Courts of Appeals|Texas State Appeals Court]] decided that "the Comptroller's test was unconstitutionally underinclusive and that the Ethical Society should have qualified for the requested tax exemptions... Because the Comptroller's test fails to include the whole range of belief systems that may, in our diverse and pluralistic society, merit the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment's]] protection..."<ref>[https://cases.justia.com/texas/third-court-of-appeals/03-02-00066-cv.pdf Carole Keeton Strayhorn, in her Official Capacity as Comptroller of Public Accounts, Appellant v.

==Advocates==
British Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] was a strong supporter of the British Ethical movement, having been a Christian earlier in his life. He was a member of the Ethical Church and the Union of Ethical Societies (now [[Humanists UK]]), a regular attender at [[Conway Hall|South Place Ethical Society]]. During his time involved with the Ethical movement, he chaired the annual meeting of the Ethical Union on multiple occasions and wrote for [[Stanton Coit]]'s ''Ethical World'' journal.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Life of James Ramsay Macdonald (1866-1919)|author=Lord Godfrey Elton|date=1939|publisher=Collins|page=94}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Labour Church: Religion and Politics in Britain 1890-1914|last=Turner|first=Jacqueline|year=2018|publisher=I.B.Tauris & Co Ltd}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=An American Looks at Gandhi: Essays in Satyagraha, Civil Rights, and Peace|last=Hunt|first=James D.|year=2005|publisher=Promilla & Co Publishers Ltd}}</ref><ref>Marquand, David; ''Ramsay MacDonald''; London, 1977; p. 24</ref>

The British critic and mountaineer [[Leslie Stephen]] was a prominent supporter of Ethical Culture in the UK, serving multiple terms as President of the West London Ethical Society (later part of the Union of Ethical Societies).<ref>{{cite book|title=Leslie Stephen's life in letters: a bibliographical study|last=Fenwick|first=Gillian|page =125|year=1993}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Social Rights And Duties: Addresses to Ethical Societies (Complete)|author=Sir Leslie Stephen|year=2002|publisher=Library of Alexandria}}</ref>

[[Albert Einstein]] was a supporter of Ethical Culture. On the seventy-fifth anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, in 1951, he noted that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. Humanity requires such a belief to survive, Einstein argued. He observed, "Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity."<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WQYtAAAAMAAJ&q=salvation+for+humanity#search_anchor |title=The Humanist Way: An Introduction to Ethical Humanist Religion |accessdate=2008-07-23 |author=Ericson, Edward L |publisher=The American Ethical Union|isbn=9780804421768 |year=1988 }}</ref>

[[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was a regular attendee at the [[New York Society for Ethical Culture]] at a time when humanism was beginning to coalesce in its modern-day form, and it was there that she developed friendships with the leading humanists and Ethical Culturists of her day. She collaborated with Al Black, Ethical Society leader, in the creation of her nationwide Encampment of Citizenship. She maintained her involvement with the movement as figures on both sides of the Atlantic began to advocate for organising under the banner of [[secular humanism]]. She provided a cover endorsement for the first edition of ''Humanism as the Next Step'' (1954) by Lloyd and Mary Morain, saying simply that it was "A significant book."
