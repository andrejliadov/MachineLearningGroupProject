{{Christian culture}}
'''Christian culture''' is the [[cultural practice]]s common to [[Christianity]].  With the rapid expansion of Christianity to Europe, Syria, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Asia Minor]], Egypt, Ethiopia, and India and by the end of the 4th&nbsp;century it had also become the official [[state church of the Roman Empire]].<ref>Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B.

[[Cultural Christian]]s are secular people with a Christian heritage who may not believe in the religious claims of Christianity, but who retain an affinity for the [[Christian pop culture|popular culture]], art, [[Christian music|music]], and so on related to it. Another frequent application of the term is to distinguish political groups in areas of mixed religious backgrounds.

{{Main|Church architecture}}
[[File:Tomb of Jesus3.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Jesus]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre church]] in [[Jerusalem]].]]
The architecture of cathedrals, basilicas and abbey churches is characterised by the buildings' large scale and follows one of several branching traditions of form, function and style that all ultimately derive from the [[Early Christian architecture|Early Christian architectural]] traditions established in the [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Constantinian]] period.

Cathedrals in particular, as well as many [[abbey]] churches and [[basilica]]s, have certain complex structural forms that are found less often in [[parish church]]es. They also tend to display a higher level of contemporary architectural style and the work of accomplished craftsmen, and occupy a status both ecclesiastical and social that an ordinary parish church does not have.  Such a cathedral or great church is generally one of the finest buildings within its region and is a focus of local pride. Many cathedrals and basilicas, and a number of abbey churches are among the world's most renowned works of architecture. These include [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Notre Dame de Paris]], [[Cologne Cathedral]], [[Salisbury Cathedral]], [[Prague Cathedral]], [[Lincoln Cathedral]], the [[Basilica of St Denis]], the Basilica of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], [[Washington National Cathedral]], [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]], [[Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis]], Gaudí's incomplete [[Sagrada Familia]] and the ancient church of [[Hagia Sophia]], now a museum. [[Hagia Sophia]] has been described as architectural and [[cultural icon]] of [[Byzantine culture|Byzantine]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Culture|Eastern Orthodox civilization]].<ref>{{harvnb|Cameron|2009}}.</ref>

The earliest large churches date from [[Late Antiquity]]. As Christianity and the construction of churches and cathedrals spread throughout the world, their manner of building was dependent upon local materials and local techniques. Different [[Architectural style|styles of architecture]] developed and their fashion spread, carried by the establishment of monastic orders, by the posting of bishops from one region to another and by the travelling of master [[stonemason]]s who served as architects.<ref>John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''.</ref> The styles of the great church buildings are successively known as [[Early Christian architecture|Early Christian]], [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]], [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], various [[Victorian architecture|Revival]] styles of the late 18th to early 20th centuries and [[Modern architecture|Modern]].<ref name="BF"/> Overlaid on each of the academic styles are the regional characteristics. Some of these characteristics are so typical of a particular country or region that they appear, regardless of style, in the architecture of churches designed many centuries apart.<ref name="BF"/>

[[Christian art]] is [[sacred art]] which uses themes and imagery from Christianity. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image, and there have been major periods of [[iconoclasm]] within Christianity.

Images of [[Jesus]] and narrative scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' are the most common subjects, and scenes from the [[Old Testament]] play a part in the art of most denominations.  Images of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].

Christianity makes far wider use of images than related religions, in which figurative representations are forbidden, such as [[Aniconism in Islam|Islam]] and [[Aniconism in Judaism|Judaism]].  However, there is also a considerable history of [[aniconism in Christianity]] from various periods.

===Illumination===
{{Main|Illuminated manuscript}}

[[File:Armenian-manuscript-CIMG1727.JPG|thumb|upright|Armenian manuscript of 1053. Work of Johannes]]
An [[illuminated manuscript]] is a [[manuscript]] in which the [[Writing|text]] is supplemented by the addition of decoration. The earliest surviving substantive illuminated manuscripts are from the period AD 400 to 600, primarily produced in Ireland, [[Constantinople]] and Italy. The majority of surviving manuscripts are from the [[Middle Ages]], although many illuminated manuscripts survive from the 15th century [[Renaissance]], along with a very limited number from [[Late Antiquity]].

Most illuminated manuscripts were created as [[codex|codices]], which had superseded scrolls; some isolated single sheets survive. A very few illuminated manuscript fragments survive on [[papyrus]]. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on [[parchment]] (most commonly of [[calfskin|calf]], sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called [[vellum]], traditionally made of unsplit [[calfskin]], though high quality parchment from other skins was also called ''parchment''.

===Iconography===
{{Main|Iconoclasm|Religious image|Christian icons|Christian symbolism}}

[[File:St. Theodor.jpg|thumb|upright|There are few old ceramic icons, such as this [[Theodore Stratelates|St. Theodor]] icon which dates to ca. 900 (from [[Preslav]], Bulgaria)]]
Christian art began, about two centuries after Christ, by borrowing motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art. [[Religious images]] are used to some extent by the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] Christian faith, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition. In the [[Late Antique]] period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to [[Biblical]] texts, although many gaps in the [[canonical Gospel]] narratives were plugged with matter from the [[apocrypha|apocryphal gospels]]. Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]].

An [[icon]] is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from [[Orthodox Christianity]]. Christianity has used [[Christian symbolism|symbolism]] from its very beginnings.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Symbolism}}</ref> In both East and West, numerous iconic types of Christ, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas [[Christ Pantocrator]] was much the commonest image of Christ.

[[Christian symbolism]] invests objects or actions with an inner meaning expressing Christian ideas. Christianity has borrowed from the common stock of significant symbols known to most periods and to all regions of the world. [[Religious symbolism]] is effective when it appeals to both the intellect and the emotions. Especially important depictions of Mary include the [[Hodegetria]] and [[Panagia]] types. Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the [[Life of the Virgin]], parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular [[saint]]s. Especially in the West, a system of [[emblem|attributes]] developed for [[Saint symbology|identifying individual]] figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.

Each [[saint]] has a story and a reason why he or she led an exemplary life. Symbols have been used to tell these stories throughout the history of the Church. A number of Christian [[saint]]s are traditionally represented by a symbol or [[Icon|iconic motif]] associated with their life, termed an attribute or [[emblem]], in order to identify them. The study of these forms part of [[iconography]] in [[Art history]].

The dedication of [[Constantinople]] as capital in 330 AD created a great new Christian artistic centre for the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], which soon became a separate political unit. Major Constantinopolitan churches built under Constantine and his son, [[Constantius II]], included the original foundations of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].<ref>T. Mathews, ''The early churches of Constantinople: architecture and liturgy'' (University Park, 1971); N. Henck, "Constantius ho Philoktistes?", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' 55 (2001), 279–304 ([http://www.doaks.org/DOP55/DP55ch14.pdf available online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327035204/http://www.doaks.org/DOP55/DP55ch14.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}).</ref> As the [[Western Roman Empire]] disintegrated and was taken over by "barbarian" peoples, the art of the Byzantine Empire reached levels of sophistication, power and artistry not previously seen in Christian art, and set the standards for those parts of the West still in touch with Constantinople.
[[File:Rhodes Siana2 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright|Church of Agios Panteleimonos, Greece.]]
This achievement was checked by the controversy over the use of ''graven images'', and the proper interpretation of the Second Commandment, which led to the crisis of [[Byzantine iconoclasm|Iconoclasm]] or destruction of religious images, which racked the Empire between 726 and 843. The restoration of Orthodoxy resulted in a strict standardization of religious imagery within the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Church]]. Byzantine art became increasingly conservative, as the form of images themselves, many accorded [[Acheiropoieta|divine origin]] or thought to have been be painted by [[Saint Luke]] or other figures, was held to have a status not far off that of a scriptural text. They could be copied, but not improved upon. As a concession to Iconoclast sentiment, monumental religious sculpture was effectively banned. Neither of these attitudes were held in Western Europe, but Byzantine art nonetheless had great influence there until the [[High Middle Ages]], and remained very popular long after that, with vast numbers of icons of the [[Cretan School]] exported to Europe as late as the [[Renaissance]]. Where possible, Byzantine artists were borrowed for projects such as mosaics in [[Venice]] and [[Palermo]]. The enigmatic frescoes at [[Castelseprio (archaeological park)|Castelseprio]] may be an example of work by a Greek artist working in Italy.

The art of [[Eastern Catholicism]] has always been rather closer to the Orthodox art of Greece and Russia, and in countries near the Orthodox world, notably Poland, Catholic art has many Orthodox influences. The [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]] may well have been of Byzantine origin – it has been repainted and this is hard to tell. Other images that are certainly of Greek origin, like the [[Salus Populi Romani]] and [[Our Lady of Perpetual Help]], both icons in Rome, have been subjects of specific veneration for centuries.

Although the influence has often been resisted, especially in Russia, Catholic art has also affected Orthodox depictions in many respects, especially in countries like Romania, and in the post-Byzantine [[Cretan School]], which led [[Greek Orthodox]] art under Venetian rule in the 15th and 16th centuries. [[El Greco]] left Crete when relatively young, but [[Michael Damaskinos]] returned after a brief period in Venice, and was able to switch between Italian and Greek styles. Even the traditionalist [[Theophanes the Cretan]], working mainly on [[Mount Athos]], nevertheless shows unmistakable Western influence.

Many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the [[Muslim world|Muslim]] states of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], preserved many aspects of the empire's culture and art for centuries afterward. A number of states contemporary with the [[Byzantine Empire]] were culturally influenced by it, without actually being part of it (the "[[Byzantine commonwealth]]"). These included [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[History of Medieval Serbia|Serbia]], and the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]], as well as some non-Orthodox states like the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire despite being in other respects part of western European culture. Art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the [[Ottoman Empire]] is often called "post-Byzantine." Certain artistic traditions that originated in the Byzantine Empire, particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture, are maintained in Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.

=== Roman Catholic art ===
{{main|Roman Catholic art}}
[[File:Cornaro chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome HDR.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|[[Bernini]]'s ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Theresa]]'']]
[[Roman Catholic art]] consists of all visual works produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the teachings of the [[Catholic Church]]. This includes sculpture, painting, mosaics, metalwork, embroidery and even architecture. Catholic art has played a leading role in the history and development of Western Art since at least the fourth century. The principal subject matter of Catholic Art has been the life and times of [[Jesus Christ]], along with those of his disciples, the saints, and the events of the Jewish [[Old Testament]].

The earliest surviving art works are the painted frescoes on the walls of the [[catacomb]]s and meeting houses of the persecuted Christians of the Roman Empire. The Christian Church in Rome was influenced by the Roman style of art and the religious Christian artists of the time. The stone [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] of Roman Christians exhibit the earliest surviving carved statuary of Jesus, Mary and other biblical figures. The legalisation of Christianity transformed Catholic art, which adopted richer forms such as [[mosaics]] and illuminated manuscripts. The [[iconoclasm]] controversy briefly divided the eastern and western churches, after which artistic development progressed in separate directions. [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art]] flowered in the Western Church as the style of painting and statuary moved in an increasingly naturalistic direction. The Protestant Reformation produced new waves of image-destruction, to which the Church responded with the dramatic and emotive [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles. In the 19th century the leadership in western art moved away from the Catholic Church which, after embracing historical revivalism was increasingly affected by the modernist movement, a movement that in its "rebellion" against nature, counters the Church's emphasis on nature as a good creation of God.

Renaissance artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Caravaggio]], and [[Titian]], were among a multitude of innovative virtuosos sponsored by the Church.<ref name="Duffy133">Duffy, p. 133.</ref>

British art historian [[Kenneth Clark]] wrote that Western Europe's first "great age of civilisation" was ready to begin around the year 1000. From 1100, he wrote, monumental abbeys and cathedrals were constructed and decorated with sculptures, hangings, mosaics and works belonging one of the greatest epochs of art and providing stark contrast to the monotonous and cramped conditions of ordinary living during the period. [[Abbot Suger]] of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] is considered an influential early patron of Gothic architecture and believed that love of beauty brought people closer to God: "The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material". Clarke calls this "the intellectual background of all the sublime works of art of the next century and in fact has remained the basis of our belief of the value of art until today".<ref name="Civilisation, BBC 1969">[[Kenneth Clarke]]; ''Civilisation'', BBC, SBN 563 10279 9; first published 1969.</ref>

Later, during [[The Renaissance]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], Catholic artists produced many of the unsurpassed masterpieces of [[Western art]] – often inspired by Biblical themes: from Michelangelo's ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]'' and ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' and ''[[Pietà]]'' sculptures, to Da Vinci's ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'' and Raphael's various ''Madonna'' paintings. Referring to a "great outburst of creative energy such as took place in Rome between 1620 and 1660", Kenneth Clarke wrote:<ref name="Civilisation, BBC 1969"/>

<blockquote>[W]ith a single exception, the great artists of the time were all sincere, conforming Christians. [[Guercino]] spent much of his mornings in prayer; [[Bernini]] frequently went into retreats and practised the [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius]]; [[Rubens]] attended Mass every morning before beginning work. The exception was [[Caravaggio]], who was like the hero of a modern play, except that he happened to paint very well.

This conformism was not based on fear of the Inquisition, but on the perfectly simple belief that the faith which had inspired the great saints of the preceding generation was something by which a man should regulate his life.</blockquote>

It is small, and generally naturalistic in style, avoiding iconic elements like the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], which is barely discernible.]]
The [[Protestant Reformation]] during the 16th century in Europe almost entirely rejected the existing tradition of Catholic art, and very often destroyed as much of it as it could reach.  A new artistic tradition developed, producing far smaller quantities of art that followed [[Protestant]] agendas and diverged drastically from the southern European tradition and the [[Renaissance humanist|humanist]] art produced during the [[High Renaissance]].  In turn, the Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] both reacted against and responded to Protestant criticisms of [[art in Roman Catholicism]] to produce a more stringent style of Catholic art.  Protestant religious art both embraced Protestant values and assisted in the proliferation of Protestantism, but the amount of religious art produced in Protestant countries was hugely reduced.  Artists in Protestant countries diversified into secular forms of art like [[history painting]], [[landscape painting]], [[portrait painting]] and [[still life]].

Prominent painters with Protestant background were, for example, [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. World literature was enriched by the works of [[Edmund Spenser]], [[John Milton]], [[John Bunyan]], [[John Donne]], [[John Dryden]], [[Daniel Defoe]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Conrad Ferdinand Meyer]], [[Theodor Fontane]], [[Washington Irving]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Emily Brontë]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Thomas Stearns Eliot]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[William Faulkner]], [[John Updike]], and many others.

== Music ==
{{Main|Christian music}}
[[Christian music]] is music that has been written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding Christian life and faith. Common themes of Christian music include [[praise]], [[worship]], [[penitence]], and [[lament]], and its forms vary widely across the world.

Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of Christian music varies according to culture and social context. Christian music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace.

In music, Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern Western musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church,<ref name="Hall100">Hall, p. 100.</ref> and an enormous body of religious music has been composed for it through the ages. This led directly to the emergence and development of European classical music, and its many derivatives. The [[Baroque]] style, which encompassed music, art, and architecture, was particularly encouraged by the post-Reformation Catholic Church as such forms offered a means of religious expression that was stirring and emotional, intended to stimulate religious fervor.<ref name="Murray45">Murray, p. 45.</ref>

The list of Catholic composers and Catholic sacred music which have a prominent place in Western culture is extensive, but includes [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Ode to Joy]]''; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s ''[[Ave verum corpus]]''; [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[Ave Maria]]'', [[César Franck]]'s ''[[Panis angelicus]]'', and [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s ''[[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]]''.

[[Martin Luther]], [[Paul Gerhardt]], [[George Wither]], [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]], and many other authors and composers created well-known church hymns. Musicians like [[Heinrich Schütz]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[George Frederick Handel]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]] composed great works of music.

[[Christian literature]] is writing that deals with Christian themes and incorporates the Christian world view. This constitutes a huge body of extremely varied writing. [[Christian poetry]] is any poetry that contains Christian teachings, themes, or references. The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the Bible, while others provide [[allegory]].

While falling within the strict definition of literature, the Bible is not generally considered literature. However, the Bible has been treated and appreciated as literature; the [[Bible]] is a corner stone of Western civilization.<ref name="Perry2012">{{cite book|author=Marvin Perry|title=Western Civilization: A Brief History, Volume I: To 1789|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2pnv0Aoh2EC&pg=PA33|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-83720-4|pages=33–}}</ref> The [[King James Version]] in particular has long been considered a masterpiece of English prose, whatever may be thought of its religious significance. The Authorized Version has been called "the most influential version of the most influential book in the world, in what is now its most influential language", "the most important book in English religion and culture", and "the most celebrated book in the [[English-speaking world]]". [[David Crystal]] has estimated that it is responsible for 257 idioms in English, examples include [[feet of clay]] and [[wikt:sow the wind, reap the whirlwind|reap the whirlwind]]. Furthermore, prominent [[atheist]] figures such as the late [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] have praised the King James Version as being "a giant step in the maturing of English literature" and "a great work of literature", respectively, with Dawkins then adding, "A native speaker of English who has never read a word of the King James Bible is verging on the barbarian".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2011/05/hitchens-201105?currentPage=all|title=When the King Saved God|year=2011|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|access-date=10 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/19/richard-dawkins-king-james-bible|title=Why I want all our children to read the King James Bible|date=20 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date= 10 August 2017}}</ref> Several retellings of the Bible, or parts of the Bible, have also been made with the aim of emphasising its literary qualities.

In [[Byzantine literature]], four different cultural elements are recognised: the [[Greek literature|Greek]], the Christian, the [[Latin literature|Roman]], and the Oriental. Byzantine literature is often classified in five groups: historians and annalists, encyclopaedists (Patriarch Photios, [[Michael Psellus]], and [[Michael Choniates]] are regarded as the greatest encyclopaedists of Byzantium) and essayists, and writers of secular poetry. The only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the ''[[Digenis Acritas]]''. The remaining two groups include the new literary species: ecclesiastical and theological literature, and popular poetry.<ref name="Mango275–276">{{harvnb|Mango|2007|pp=275–276}}.</ref> And it was in [[Alexandria]] that Graeco-Oriental Christianity had its birth. There the [[Septuagint]] translation had been made; there that that fusion of Greek philosophy and Jewish religion took place which culminated in [[Philo]]; there flourished the mystic speculative [[Neoplatonism]] associated with [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry of Tyros|Porphyry]]. At Alexandria the great Greek ecclesiastical writers worked alongside pagan rhetoricians and philosophers; several were born here, e.g. [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and his opponent [[Arius]], also [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]] and [[Synesius]]. On Egyptian soil [[monasticism]] began and thrived. After Alexandria, [[Antioch]] held great prestige, where a school of Christian commentators flourished under [[St. John Chrysostom]] and where later arose the Christian universal chronicles. In surrounding Syria, we find the germs of Greek ecclesiastical poetry, while from neighboring [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] came [[St. John of Damascus]], one of the [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]].

The list of Catholic authors and literary works is vast. With a literary tradition spanning two millennia, the Bible and [[Papal Encyclicals]] have been constants of the Catholic canon but countless other historical works may be listed as noteworthy in terms of their influence on Western society. From late Antiquity, [[St Augustine]]'s book [[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]], which outlines his sinful youth and conversion to Christianity, is widely considered to be the first autobiography of ever written in the canon of [[Western Literature]]. Augustine profoundly influenced the coming medieval worldview. The ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', written 1265–1274, is the best-known work of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (c.1225–1274), and although unfinished, "one of the classics of the history of philosophy and one of the most influential works of Western literature."<ref>Ross, James F., "Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa theologiae'' (ca. 1273), Christian Wisdom Explained Philosophically", in ''The Classics of Western Philosophy: A Reader's Guide'', (eds.) Jorge J. E. Gracia, Gregory M. Reichberg, Bernard N. Schumacher (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003), p. 165.

It presents the reasoning for almost all points of Christian theology in the West. The epic poetry of the Italian [[Dante]] and his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of the late [[Middle Ages]] is also considered immensely influential. The English statesman and philosopher, [[Thomas More]], wrote the seminal work [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]] in 1516. [[St Ignatius Loyola]], a key figure in the Catholic counter-reformation, is the author of an influential book of meditations known as the ''[[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]]''.

Catholics have also given greater value to the world through literary works by [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[John Dryden]], [[Walker Percy]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Thomas Merton]], [[Toni Morrison]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[J.R.R.

== Philosophy==
{{Main|Christian philosophy|Scholasticism}}
[[File:Augustine Confessiones.jpg|thumb|upright|''Confessions'' by St. [[Augustine of Hippo]]]]
[[Christian philosophy]] is a term to describe the fusion of various fields of philosophy with the [[Theology|theological]] doctrines of Christianity. [[Scholasticism]], which means "that [which] belongs to the school", and was a method of learning taught by the [[academics]] (or ''school people'') of medieval universities c. 1100–1500. Scholasticism originally started to reconcile the philosophy of the ancient classical philosophers with medieval Christian theology. Scholasticism is not a philosophy or theology in itself but a tool and method for learning which places emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]].

Medieval philosophy is the philosophy of Western Europe and the Middle East during the [[Middle Ages]], roughly extending from the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]] until the Renaissance.<ref name="encyclopedia">Frederick Copleston, ''A History of Philosophy, Volume II: From Augustine to Scotus'' (Burns & Oates, 1950), p. 1, dates medieval philosophy proper from the Carolingian Renaissance in the eighth century to the end of the fourteenth century, though he includes [[Augustine]] and the Patristic fathers as precursors. Desmond Henry, in Paul Edwards (ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan, 1967), vol. 5, pp. 252–257, starts with Augustine and ends with [[Nicole Oresme|Nicholas of Oresme]] in the late fourteenth century. David Luscombe, ''Medieval Thought'' (Oxford University Press, 1997), dates medieval philosophy from the conversion of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] in 312 to the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1520s. Christopher Hughes, in A.C. Grayling (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), covers philosophers from Augustine to Ockham. Jorge J.E. Gracia, in Nicholas Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed. (Blackwell, 2003), p. 620, identifies medieval philosophy as running from Augustine to [[John of St. Thomas]] in the seventeenth century. Anthony Kenny, ''A New History of Western Philosophy, Volume II: Medieval Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), begins with Augustine and ends with the Lateran Council of 1512.</ref> Medieval philosophy is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]], and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then widespread sacred doctrines of [[Abrahamic religion]] ([[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and Christianity) with [[secularism|secular]] learning.

The history of western European medieval philosophy is traditionally divided into two main periods: the period in the [[Latin West]] following the [[Early Middle Ages]] until the 12th century, when the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] were preserved and cultivated; and the "golden age" of the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries in the Latin West, which witnessed the culmination of the recovery of ancient philosophy, and significant developments in the field of [[philosophy of religion]], [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]].
[[File:SummaTheologiae.jpg|thumb|upright|''Summa theologica'', Pars secunda, prima pars. (copy by Peter Schöffer, 1471)]]
The medieval era was disparagingly treated by the Renaissance humanists, who saw it as a barbaric "middle" period between the classical age of Greek and Roman culture, and the "rebirth" or ''renaissance'' of classical culture. Yet this period of nearly a thousand years was the longest period of philosophical development in Europe, and possibly the richest. [[Jorge Gracia]] has argued that "in intensity, sophistication, and achievement, the philosophical flowering in the thirteenth century could be rightly said to rival the golden age of Greek philosophy in the fourth century B.C."<ref name="gracia">Gracia, p. 1</ref>

Some problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of [[faith]] to [[reason]], the existence and unity of God, the object of theology and [[metaphysics]], the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation.

Philosophers from the Middle Ages include the Christian philosophers [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Boethius]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Gilbert of Poitiers]], [[Peter Abelard]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Jean Buridan]]; the Jewish philosophers [[Maimonides]] and [[Gersonides]]; and the [[Muslim]] philosophers [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]], [[Al-Farabi|Alfarabi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Ghazali|Algazel]], [[Ibn Bajjah|Avempace]], [[Ibn Tufail|Abubacer]], [[Ibn Khaldūn]], and [[Averroes]]. The medieval tradition of [[Scholasticism]] continued to flourish as late as the 17th century, in figures such as [[Francisco Suarez]] and [[John of St. Thomas]].

Aquinas, father of [[Thomism]], was immensely influential in Catholic Europe, placed a great emphasis on reason and argumentation, and was one of the first to use the new translation of Aristotle's metaphysical and epistemological writing. His work was a significant departure from the [[Neoplatonic]] and Augustinian thinking that had dominated much of early Scholasticism.

The Renaissance ("rebirth") was a period of transition between the Middle Ages and modern thought,<ref name="contemporaries">Charles Schmitt and Quentin Skinner (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 5, loosely define the period as extending "from the age of Ockham to the revisionary work of Bacon, Descartes and their contemporaries."</ref> in which the recovery of classical texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies in logic, metaphysics, and theology towards eclectic inquiries into morality, philology, and mysticism.<ref name="renaissance3">Brian Copenhaver and Charles Schmitt, ''Renaissance Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 4: "one may identify the hallmark of Renaissance philosophy as an accelerated and enlarged interest, stimulated by newly available texts, in primary sources of Greek and Roman thought that were previously unknown or partially known or little read."</ref> The study of the classics and the humane arts generally, such as history and literature, enjoyed a scholarly interest hitherto unknown in Christendom, a tendency referred to as [[humanism]].<ref name="transmission">Jorge J.E. Gracia in Nicholas Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed. (Blackwell, 2002), p. 621: "the humanists … restored man to the centre of attention and channeled their efforts to the recovery and transmission of classical learning, particularly in the philosophy of Plato."</ref> Displacing the medieval interest in metaphysics and logic, the humanists followed [[Petrarch]] in making man and his virtues the focus of philosophy.<ref name="intellectual">Charles B. Schmitt and Quentin Skinner (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 61 and 63: "From Petrarch the early humanists learnt their conviction that the revival of ''humanae literae'' was only the first step in a greater intellectual renewal" […] "the very conception of philosophy was changing because its chief object was now man—man was at centre of every inquiry".</ref>

These new movements in philosophy developed contemporaneously with larger religious and political transformations in Europe: the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the decline of [[feudalism]].  Though the theologians of the Protestant Reformation showed little direct interest in philosophy, their destruction of the traditional foundations of theological and intellectual authority harmonized with a revival of [[fideism]] and skepticism in thinkers such as [[Erasmus]], [[Montaigne]], and [[Francisco Sanches]].<ref name="scepticism">Richard Popkin, ''The History of Scepticism from Savonarola to Bayle'' (Oxford University Press, 2003).</ref> Meanwhile, the gradual centralization of political power in nation-states was echoed by the emergence of secular political philosophies, as in the works of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (often described as the first modern political thinker, or a key turning point towards modern political thinking), [[Thomas More]], [[Erasmus]], [[Justus Lipsius]], [[Jean Bodin]], and [[Hugo Grotius]].<ref name="renaissance5">Copenhaver and Schmitt, ''Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 274–284.</ref><ref name="renaissance6">Schmitt and Skinner, ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 430–452.</ref>

Earlier attempts at reconciliation of Christianity with [[Newtonian mechanics]] appear quite different from later attempts at reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of [[evolution]] or [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].<ref name=habgood>''Religion and Science'', [[John Habgood]], Mills & Brown, 1964, pp., 11, 14–16, 48–55, 68–69, 90–91, 87</ref><!-- Habgood: pages 48-55 --> Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a ''[[survival of the fittest|struggle for existence]].'' These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal [[sociobiology|patterns of biological cooperation]]. According to [[John Habgood]], all man really knows here is that the [[universe]] seems to be a mix of [[good and evil]], beauty and [[pain]], and that [[suffering]] may somehow be part of the process of creation.

While refined and clarified over the centuries, the [[Roman Catholic]] position on the relationship between science and religion is one of harmony, and has maintained the teaching of [[natural law]] as set forth by [[Thomas Aquinas]].  For example, regarding scientific study such as that of evolution, the church's unofficial position is an example of [[theistic evolution]], stating that faith and scientific findings regarding human evolution are not in conflict, though humans are regarded as a special creation, and that the existence of God is required to explain both [[monogenism]] and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] component of human origins. Catholic schools have included all manners of scientific study in their curriculum for many centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13554b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=New Advent |access-date=2013-06-16}}</ref>

Galileo once stated "The intention of the [[Holy Spirit]] is to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."<ref>{{cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Galileo|last= Machamer|first= Peter|year= 1998|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn= 0-521-58841-3|page= [https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_m2w3/page/306 306]|url= https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_m2w3/page/306}}</ref> In 1981 [[John Paul II]], then pope of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], spoke of the relationship this way: "The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer".<ref>Pope [[John Paul II]], 3 October 1981 to the Pontifical Academy of Science, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2COSM.HTM "Cosmology and Fundamental Physics"]</ref>

The influence of the Church on Western letters and learning has been formidable. The ancient texts of the Bible have deeply influenced Western art, literature and culture. For centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, small monastic communities were practically the only outposts of literacy in Western Europe. In time, the Cathedral schools developed into Europe's earliest universities and the church has established thousands of primary, secondary and tertiary institutions throughout the world in the centuries since. The Church and clergymen have also sought at different times to censor texts and scholars. Thus different schools of opinion exist as to the role and influence of the Church in relation to western letters and learning.

One view, first propounded by [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment philosophers]], asserts that the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have hindered the progress of civilization. [[Communist states]] have made similar arguments in their education in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such critics are the Church's condemnations of the teachings of [[Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].

The Church's priest-scientists, many of whom were [[Jesuit]]s, have been among the leading lights in [[astronomy]], [[genetics]], [[geomagnetism]], [[meteorology]], [[seismology]], and [[solar physics]], becoming some of the "fathers" of these sciences. Examples include important churchmen such as the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] abbot [[Gregor Mendel]] (pioneer in the study of genetics), [[Roger Bacon]] (a [[Franciscan]] friar who was one of the early advocates of the [[scientific method]]), and Belgian priest [[Georges Lemaître]] (the first to propose the [[Big Bang]] theory). Other notable priest scientists have included [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Nicholas Steno]], [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Giambattista Riccioli]], [[Roger Boscovich]], and [[Athanasius Kircher]]. Even more numerous are Catholic laity involved in science:[[Henri Becquerel]] who discovered [[radioactivity]]; [[Galvani]], [[Alessandro Volta|Volta]], [[Ampere]], [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]], pioneers in electricity and [[telecommunications]]; [[Lavoisier]], "father of modern [[chemistry]]"; [[Vesalius]], founder of modern [[human anatomy]]; and [[Cauchy]], one of the mathematicians who laid the rigorous foundations of [[calculus]].

Throughout history many of the [[List of Roman Catholic cleric-scientists|Roman Catholic clerics]] have made contributions to science, mostly during periods of Church domination of public life. These cleric-scientists include [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Georges Lemaître]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Roger Joseph Boscovich]], [[Marin Mersenne]], [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]], [[Nicole Oresme]], [[Jean Buridan]], [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Christopher Clavius]], [[Nicolas Steno]], [[Athanasius Kircher]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], [[William of Ockham]], and others. The Catholic Church has also produced many [[List of Catholic scientists|lay scientists and mathematicians]], including 20th century Nobel Laureates like chemist [[Mario J. Molina]], chemist [[John Polanyi]], physicist [[Riccardo Giacconi]], among many others.

The Jesuits have made numerous significant contributions to the development of science. For example, the Jesuits have dedicated significant study to earthquakes, and [[seismology]] has been described as "the Jesuit science".<ref>Susan Elizabeth Hough, ''Richter's Scale: Measure of an Earthquake, Measure of a Man'', Princeton University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-691-12807-3}}, [https://archive.org/details/richtersscalemea00houg/page/68 p. 68.]</ref> The Jesuits have been described as "the single most important contributor to experimental physics in the seventeenth century".<ref>{{cite book|first1=David C.|last1=Lindberg|first2=Ronald Leslie|last2=Numbers|author-link1=David C.

Protestantism had an important influence on science.

Merton]] focused on English Puritanism and [[Pietism|German Pietism]] as having been responsible for the development of the [[scientific revolution]] of the 17th and 18th centuries. Merton explained that the connection between [[religious affiliation]] and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the [[ascetic]] Protestant values and those of modern science.<ref name=becker1992>Becker, George (1992), ''The Merton Thesis: Oetinger and German Pietism, a significant negative case,'' [[Sociological Forum]] (Springer) 7 (4), pp. 642–660</ref> Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to study God's influence on the world and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.<ref name=sztompka2003/>

The university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the [[History of Christianity|Medieval Christian]] setting.<ref name="Rüegg, Walter 1992, pp. XIX"/><ref name="verger1999"/> Prior to the establishment of universities, European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian [[cathedral school]]s or [[monastic school]]s (''Scholae monasticae''), in which [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD.<ref>Riché, Pierre (1978): "Education and Culture in the Barbarian West: From the Sixth through the Eighth Century", Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, {{ISBN|0-87249-376-8}}, pp.&nbsp;126–7, 282–98</ref>

Missionary activity for the Catholic Church has always incorporated education of evangelized peoples as part of its social ministry. History shows that in evangelized lands, the first people to operate schools were Roman Catholics. In some countries, the Church is the main provider of education or significantly supplements government forms of education. Presently, the Church operates the world's largest non-governmental school system.<ref name="Gardner148">Gardner, p.&nbsp;148</ref><ref>{{Citation |last1=Gardner |first1=Roy |first2=Denis |last2=Lawton |first3=Jo |last3=Cairns |title=Faith Schools |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |page=148 |isbn=978-0-415-33526-3}}</ref> Many of Western Civilization's most influential universities were founded by the Catholic Church.

The Catholic Church founded the West's first universities, which were preceded by the schools attached to monasteries and cathedrals, and generally staffed by monks and friars.<ref name="ReferenceA">Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011</ref> Universities began springing up in Italian towns like [[Salerno University|Salerno]], which became a leading medical school, translating the work of Greek and Arabic physicians into Latin.

[[Paris University]], specialising in such topics as theology, came to rival Bologna under the supervision of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]. [[Oxford University]] in England later came rival Paris in Theology and [[Salamanca University]] was founded in Spain in 1243. According to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], the universities benefitted from the use of Latin, the common language of the Church, and its internationalist reach, and their role was to "teach, argue and reason within a Christian framework".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of enquiry and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |access-date=16 July 2011}}</ref> and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |access-date=16 July 2011}}</ref> The Catholic church has always been involved in education, since the founding of the first universities of Europe.

As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible, education on all levels got a strong boost. Compulsory education for both boys and girls was introduced. For example, the [[Puritans]] who established [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1628 founded [[Harvard College]] only eight years later. About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century, including [[Yale University]] (1701). [[Pennsylvania]] also became a centre of learning.<ref>Clifton E.

Protestantism also initiated translations of the Bible into national languages and hereby supported the development of national literatures.

A large number of [[mainline Protestant]]s have played leadership roles in many aspects of American life, including politics, business, science, the arts, and education. They founded most of the country's leading institutes of higher education.<ref name=mainline2000>McKinney, William. "Mainline Protestantism 2000."

According to the same study "there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in sub-Saharan Africa" as [[Muslim]] adults in this region are far less educated than their Christian counterparts,<ref name="Pew2016"/> with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the educational facilities that were created by [[Christian missionaries]] during the colonial era for fellow believers.<ref name="Pew2016"/>

The administration of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires split and the [[Fall of Rome|demise of the Western Empire]] by the sixth century was accompanied by a series of violent invasions and precipitated the collapse of cities and civic institutions of learning, along with their links to the learning of classical Greece and Rome. For the next thousand years, medical knowledge would change very little.<ref>Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; pp82-83</ref> A scholarly medical tradition maintained itself in the more stable East, but in the West, scholarship virtually disappeared outside of the Church, where monks were aware of a dwindling range of medical texts.<ref>Roy Porter; The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present; Harper Collins; 1997; p.90.</ref> [[Hospitality]] was considered an obligation of [[Christian charity]] and bishops' houses and the valetudinaria of wealthier Christians were used to tend the sick. And the legacy of this early period was, in the words of Porter, that "Christianity planted the hospital: the well-endowed establishments of the Levant and the scattered houses of the West shared a common religious ethos of charity."

The [[Byzantine Empire]] was one of the first empires to have flourishing medical establishments. Prior to the Byzantine Empire the Roman Empire had [[hospitals]] specifically for soldiers and slaves. However, none of these establishments were for the public. The hospitals in Byzantium were originally started by the church to act as a place for the poor to have access to basic amenities. Hospitals were usually separated between men and women. Although the remains of these hospitals have not been discovered by archaeologists, recordings of hospitals from the Byzantine Empire describe large buildings that had the core feature of an open hearth.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title=The Birth of the Hospital in the Byzantine Empire|last=Miller|first=Timothy|journal=The Henry e. Sigerist Supplements to the Bulletin of the History of Medicine|issue=10|publisher=Johns Hopkins|year=1985|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=142–146|pmid=3902734}}</ref> The establishments of the Byzantine Empire resembled the beginning of what we now know as modern hospitals. The first hospital was erected by Leontius of Antioch between the years 344 to 358 and was a place for strangers and migrants to find refuge. Around the same time, a deacon named Marathonius was in charge of hospitals and monasteries in Constantinople. His main objective was to improve urban aesthetics, illustrating hospitals as a main part of Byzantine cities. These early hospitals were designed for the poor. In fact, most hospitals throughout the Byzantine Empire were almost exclusively utilized by the poor. This may be due to descriptions of hospitals similar to "[[Gregory of Nazianzus|Gregory Nazianzen]] who called the hospital a stairway to heaven, implying that it aimed only to ease death for the chronically or terminally ill rather than promote recovery".<ref name=":0"/> There is debate between scholars as to why these institutions were started by the church. Many scholars believe that the church founded hospitals in order to receive additional donations. Whatever the case for these hospitals, they began to diffuse across the empire. Soon after, [[Basil of Caesarea|St. Basil of Caesarea]] developed a place for the sick in which provided refuge for the sick and homeless.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |jstor = 3657030|title = The Earliest Hospitals in Byzantium, Western Europe, and Islam|journal = The Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume = 35|issue = 3|pages = 361–389|last1 = Horden|first1 = Peregrine|year = 2005|doi = 10.1162/0022195052564243|s2cid = 145378868}}</ref>

Geoffrey Blainey likened the Catholic Church in its activities during the Middle Ages to an early version of a welfare state: "It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates.<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 214-215.</ref> It was common for monks and clerics to practice medicine and medical students in northern European universities often took minor Holy orders. Mediaeval hospitals had a strongly Christian ethos, and were, in the words of historian of medicine [[Roy Porter]], "religious foundations through and through", and Ecclesiastical regulations were passed to govern medicine, partly to prevent clergymen profiting from medicine.<ref name="Present pp. 110-112">[[Roy Porter]]; ''The Greatest Benefit to Mankind - a Medical History of Humanity from Antiquity to the Present''; Harper Collins; 1997; pp. 110-112</ref>  During Europe's [[Age of Discovery]], Catholic missionaries, notably the Jesuits, introduced the modern sciences to India, China and Japan. While persecutions continue to limit the spread of Catholic institutions to some Middle Eastern Muslim nations, and such places as the People's Republic of China and North Korea, elsewhere in Asia the church is a major provider of health care services - especially in Catholic Nations like the [[Philippines]].

The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties, including the power of reason. That means that they are allowed to explore God's creation and, according to Genesis 2:15, make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way. Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the [[humanities]] and the [[sciences]].<ref>[[Gerhard Lenski]] (1963), ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life'', Revised Edition,  A Doubleday Anchor Book, Garden City, N.Y., pp.348–351</ref> Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers, in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ, are to follow God's commandments.

[[Western Christianity|Western Christian]] liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church,<ref name="calendar" /> and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] use analogous calendars based on the cycle of their respective [[Rite#Christian|rites]].

Christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations, such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and [[Pentecost]]: these are the celebrations of [[Jesus at the Nativity|Christ's birth]], [[resurrection]] and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Church, respectively.

Roman Catholic theology enumerates seven sacraments:<ref>Cf. [https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1210] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609042152/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3E.HTM |date=9 June 2011 }}</ref> [[Baptism]] ([[infant baptism|Christening]]), [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|Confirmation]] ([[Chrismation]]), [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]] ([[Holy Communion|Communion]]), [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]] (Reconciliation), [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Anointing of the Sick]] (before the [[Second Vatican Council]] generally called Extreme Unction), [[Marriage (Catholic Church)|Matrimony]]

In Christian belief and practice, a ''sacrament'' is a [[rite]], instituted by Christ, that mediates [[divine grace|grace]], constituting a [[Sacred Mysteries|sacred mystery]]. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sacramentum'', which was used to translate the Greek word for ''mystery''. Views concerning both what rites are sacramental, and what it means for an act to be a sacrament vary among Christian denominations and traditions.<ref name="ODCC1435">Cross/Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. p. 1435f.</ref>

The most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign, instituted by Christ, that conveys an inward, spiritual grace through Christ. The two most widely accepted sacraments are [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] (or Holy Communion), however, the majority of Christians also recognize five additional sacraments: [[Confirmation (Christian sacrament)|Confirmation]] ([[Chrismation]] in the Orthodox tradition), [[Holy orders]] ([[ordination]]), [[Penance]] (or [[Confession (religion)|Confession]]), [[Anointing of the Sick]], and [[Matrimony]] (see [[Christian views on marriage]]).<ref name="ODCC1435" />

Taken together, these are the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Seven Sacraments]] as recognized by churches in the [[High Church]] tradition—notably [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], [[Independent Catholic Churches|Independent Catholic]], [[Old Catholic]], many [[Anglican sacraments|Anglicans]], and some [[Lutherans]]. Most other denominations and traditions typically affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments, while some Protestant groups, such as the Quakers, reject sacramental theology.<ref name="ODCC1435" /> [[Christian denominations]], such as [[Baptists]], which believe these rites do not communicate grace, prefer to call Baptism and Holy Communion ''[[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinances]]'' rather than sacraments.

Today, most [[Christian denominations]] are neutral about [[religious male circumcision]], neither requiring it nor forbidding it. The practice is customary among the [[Coptic Christian|Coptic]], [[Ethiopian Orthodox|Ethiopian]], and [[Eritrean Orthodox]] Churches, and also some other African churches.<ref name=Christian>Customary in some Coptic and other churches:
*"The Coptic Christians in Egypt and the Ethiopian Orthodox Christians— two of the oldest surviving forms of Christianity— retain many of the features of early Christianity, including male circumcision. Circumcision is not prescribed in other forms of Christianity... Some Christian churches in South Africa oppose the practice, viewing it as a pagan ritual, while others, including the Nomiya church in Kenya, require circumcision for membership and participants in focus group discussions in Zambia and Malawi mentioned similar beliefs that Christians should practice circumcision since Jesus was circumcised and the Bible teaches the practice."
*"The decision that Christians need not practice circumcision is recorded in {{Bibleverse|Acts|15}}; there was never, however, a prohibition of circumcision, and it is practiced by Coptic Christians." [https://web.archive.org/web/20080720054046/http://bartleby.com/65/ci/circumci.html "circumcision"], The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001–05.</ref>

Worship can be varied for special events like [[baptism]]s or weddings in the service or significant [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. In the [[Early Christianity|early church]], Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship. In many churches today, adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age-appropriate teaching. Such children's worship is often called [[Sunday school]] or [[Sabbath school]] (Sunday schools are often held before rather than during services).

A [[Pew Center]] study about Religion and Living arrangements around the world in 2019, found that Christians around the world live in somewhat smaller households, on average, than non-Christians (4.5 vs. 5.1 members). 34% of world’s Christian population live in  two parent families with minor children, while 29% live in household with [[Extended family|extended families]], 11% live as couples without other family members, 9% live in household with least one child over the age of 18 with one or two parents, 7% live alone, and 6% live in [[single parent]] households.<ref>[Religion and Living Arrangements Around the World: Muslims and Hindus have larger households than Christians and religious ‘nones,’ in patterns influenced by regional norms], [[Pew Research Center]], 12 December 2019</ref> Christians in [[Asia]] and [[Pacific]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], and in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], overwhelmingly live in extended or two parent families with minor children.<ref>[Religion and Living Arrangements Around the World: Muslims and Hindus have larger households than Christians and religious ‘nones,’ in patterns influenced by regional norms], [[Pew Research Center]], 12 December 2019</ref> While more Christians in Europe and North America live alone or as couples without other family members.<ref>[Religion and Living Arrangements Around the World: Muslims and Hindus have larger households than Christians and religious ‘nones,’ in patterns influenced by regional norms], [[Pew Research Center]], 12 December 2019</ref>

== Christian pop culture ==
{{See|Contemporary Christian music|Christian video game}}
[[File:LVB 1590.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Christian music festival]] in [[Portugal]].]]
Christian pop culture (or Christian popular culture), is the [[vernacular]] Christian [[culture]] that prevails in any given [[society]].  The content of popular culture is determined by the daily interactions, needs and desires, and cultural 'movements' that make up everyday lives of [[Christians]].  It can include any number of practices, including those pertaining to cooking, clothing, mass media and the many facets of [[entertainment]] such as [[sports]] and [[literature]]

In modern urban mass societies, Christian pop culture has been crucially shaped by the development of industrial [[mass production]], the introduction of new technologies of sound and image broadcasting and recording, and the growth of [[mass media]] industries—the [[film]], [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[radio]] and [[television]], [[radio]], [[video game]], and the book publishing industries, as well as the print and electronic news media.

Items of Christian pop culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of Christians. Some argue that broad-appeal items dominate Christian pop culture because profit-making Christian companies that produce and sell items of Christian pop culture attempt to maximize their profits by emphasizing broadly appealing items. And yet the situation is more complex. To take the example of [[Christian pop]] music, it is not the case that the music industry can impose any product they wish. In fact, highly popular types of music have often first been elaborated in small, counter-cultural circles such as [[Christian punk rock]] or [[Christian rap]].

Because the Christian pop industry is significantly smaller than the secular pop industry, a few organizations and companies dominate the market and have a strong influence over what is dominant within the industry.

Another source of Christian pop culture which makes it differ from pop culture is the influence from [[mega churches]]. Christian pop culture reflects the current popularity of megachurches, but also the uniting of smaller community churches. The culture has been led by [[Hillsong Church]] in particular, which resides in many countries including [[Australia]], [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="routledge">{{Cite book |last=Wagner |first=Tom |title="Branding, Music, and Religion: Standardization and Adaptation in the Experience of the 'Hillsong Sound.'"

=== Film Industry ===
{{Main|Christian film industry}}
[[File:ChristianCinema.png|thumb|right|200px|[[ChristianCinema.com]] is a website that lists movies related to Christianity.]]
The [[Christian film industry]] is an [[umbrella term]] for films containing a [[Christianity|Christian]] themed message or moral, produced by Christian filmmakers to a Christian audience, and films produced by non-Christians with Christian audiences in mind. They are often interdenominational films, but can also be films targeting a specific denomination of Christianity. Popular [[mainstream]] studio productions of films with strong Christian messages or Biblical stories, like ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=christian.htm|title=Christian Movies at the Box Office|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=23 April 2019}}</ref> ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=christian.htm|title=Christian|website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=25 April 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Book of Eli]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://insidemovies.moviefone.com/2010/01/15/book-of-eli-christian-messages-themes-audiences/ |title=Will Christian Audiences Embrace Denzel's 'Book of Eli'? |last=Chen |first=Sandie Angulo |date=15 January 2010 |work=[[Moviefone]] |access-date=15 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702121456/http://insidemovies.moviefone.com/2010/01/15/book-of-eli-christian-messages-themes-audiences |archive-date=2 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Machine Gun Preacher]]'', ''[[The Star (2017 film)|The Star]]'',<ref name=VarietyReckartDebut>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/timothy-reckart-sony-animated-film-1201466219/|last1=Flores|first1=Terry|title=Oscar-Nommed Timothy Reckart to Make Feature Directing Debut on Sony Toon (EXCLUSIVE)|work=Variety|date=7 April 2015|access-date=22 December 2016}}</ref> ''[[The Flying House (TV series)|The Flying House]]'',<ref name=Erickson>{{cite book |last1=Erickson |first1=Hal |title=Television Cartoon Shows: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1949 Through 2003 |date=2005 |edition=2nd |publisher=McFarland & Co |isbn=978-1476665993 |pages=808–809}}</ref> ''[[Superbook]]'' and ''[[Silence (2016 film)|Silence]]'', are not specifically part of the Christian film industry, being more agnostic about their audiences' religious beliefs.

[[Televangelism]] ([[wikt:tele-|tele-]] "distance" and "[[evangelism]]," meaning "[[Christian ministry|ministry]]," sometimes called ''teleministry'') is the use of media, specifically [[radio]] and [[television]], to communicate [[Christianity]].<ref name=Stewart>{{cite web|last1=Stewart|first1=Tim|title=televangelism|url=http://www.dictionaryofchristianese.com/televangelism/|website=Dictionary of Christianese|access-date=25 March 2016|date=13 January 2015}}</ref> Televangelists are [[minister (Christianity)|ministers]], whether official or self-proclaimed, who devote a large portion of their ministry to television [[broadcast]]ing. Some televangelists are also regular [[pastor]]s or ministers in their own places of worship (often a [[megachurch]]), but the majority of their followers come from TV and radio audiences. Others do not have a conventional congregation, and work primarily through television. The term is also used derisively by critics as an insinuation of aggrandizement by such ministers.<ref>"Bishop Fulton Sheen: The First 'Televangelist'", ''Time Magazine'', Monday, 14 April 1952</ref>

Televangelism began as a uniquely American phenomenon, resulting from a [[Television in the United States|largely deregulated media]] where access to [[television network]]s and [[cable TV]] is open to virtually anyone who can afford it, combined with a [[Christianity in the United States|large Christian population]] that is able to provide the necessary funding. It became especially popular among [[Evangelical Protestant]] audiences, whether independent or organized around Christian denominations.<ref>{{cite news|title=S.

Domestically produced televangelism is increasingly present in some other nations such as [[Brazil]].

Some countries have a more regulated media with either general restrictions on access or specific rules regarding religious broadcasting. In such countries, religious programming is typically produced by TV companies (sometimes as a regulatory or public service requirement) rather than private [[interest group]]s.
