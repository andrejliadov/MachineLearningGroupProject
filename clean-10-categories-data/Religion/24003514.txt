The '''Bar Ilan Responsa Project''' (the ''Global Jewish Database'') is a collection of Jewish texts in Hebrew, sold on CD and more recently on USB flash-drive by [[Bar-Ilan University]] (in [[Ramat Gan]], [[Israel]]).

== Background ==

The database consists of one of the world's largest electronic collection of Jewish texts in Hebrew.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://responsa.biu.ac.il/about.htm |title=About the CD |publisher=Judaic Responsa |accessdate=2009-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815103642/http://responsa.biu.ac.il/about.htm |archivedate=2009-08-15 }}</ref>

It includes numerous works from the [[History of Responsa|Responsa Literature]] (rabbinic case-law rulings).<ref name="about"/>

The database also includes the [[Bible]] and the [[Talmud]] (with commentaries); articles about Jewish law and customs; [[Maimonides]]' [[Mishneh Torah]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]] with main commentaries; [[Zohar]], [[Midrashim]], and the [[Talmudic Encyclopedia]].<ref name="about"/>

Today the Responsa Project CD-ROM contains more than 90,000 Responsa and more than 420,000 hypertext links between the databases totalling 200 million words.

The project was founded by [[Aviezri Fraenkel]] who served as its initial director (1963–1974), and subsequent director [[Yaakov Choueka]] (1975–1986), as cited by the [[Israel Prize]] committee. Currently the project is headed by [[Shmaryahu Hoz]].
