[[File:C.T. Russell.gif|left|182px|thumb|[[Charles Taze Russell|Pastor Russell]], founder of the [[Bible Student movement|Watch Tower Society]]]]
In 1870, [[Charles Taze Russell]] and others formed a group in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] to study the Bible.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogerson|first=Alan|title=Millions Now Living Will Never Die: A Study of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Constable & Co, London|year=1969|pages=6|isbn=978-0094559400}}</ref> During the course of his ministry, Russell disputed many beliefs of mainstream Christianity including immortality of the soul, hellfire, predestination, the fleshly return of Jesus Christ, the Trinity, and the burning up of the world.<ref name="beckford1874">{{harvnb|Beckford|1975|page=2}}</ref> In 1876, Russell met [[Nelson H.

The book taught that God's dealings with humanity were divided [[Dispensationalism|dispensationally]], each ending with a "harvest," that Christ had returned as an invisible spirit being in 1874<ref name="beckford1874" /> inaugurating the "harvest of the Gospel age," and that 1914 would mark the end of a 2520-year period called "the Gentile Times,"<ref>{{cite book|last=Crompton|first=Robert|title=Counting the Days to Armageddon|publisher=James Clarke & Co|year=1996|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-227-67939-5|pages=37–39}}</ref> at which time world society would be replaced by the full establishment of God's kingdom on earth.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Bible Examiner|date=October 1876|title=Gentile Times: When Do They End? |pages=27–28 |quote=The seven times will end in A.D. 1914; when Jerusalem shall be delivered forever ... when Gentile Governments shall have been dashed to pieces; when God shall have poured out of his fury upon the nations and they acknowledge him King of Kings and Lord of Lords.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Studies in the Scriptures|publisher=Watchtower Bible and Tract Society|year=1897|page=xii|volume=IV The Battle of Armageddon}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Time is at Hand|last=Russell|first=Charles|publisher=Watchtower Bible and Tract Society |year=1889|page=101}}</ref> Beginning in 1878 Russell and Barbour jointly edited a religious journal, ''Herald of the Morning''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses|last1=Botting|first1=Heather|last2=Botting|first2=Gary|publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1984|page=36}}</ref> In June 1879 the two split over doctrinal differences, and in July, Russell began publishing the magazine ''[[The Watchtower|Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence]]'',<ref name="Holden18">{{harvnb|Holden|2002|Portrait|page=18}}</ref> stating that its purpose was to demonstrate that the world was in "the last days," and that a new age of earthly and human restitution under the reign of Christ was imminent.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Zion's Watch Tower|date=July 1, 1879|page=1 |title=Prospectus|quote=This is the first number of the first volume of "Zion's Watch Tower," and it may not be amiss to state the object of its publication.

From 1879, ''Watch Tower'' supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the Bible topically. Thirty congregations were founded, and during 1879 and 1880, Russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings.<ref>{{cite book|title=1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watchtower Bible and Tract Society|chapter=Part 1 &mdash; United States of America|year=1975|page=38|chapter-url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/301975002}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Zion's Watch Tower|date=September 1884|pages=7–8|title=The Ecclesia.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Charles|title=Studies in the Scriptures|publisher=Watchtower Bible and Tract Society|year=1904|volume=VI The New Creation|pages=195–272}}</ref> In 1881, ''Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society'' was presided over by [[William Henry Conley]], and in 1884, Russell incorporated the society as a non-profit business to distribute tracts and Bibles.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Russell|first=Charles |magazine=Zion's Watch Tower|date=April 25, 1894 |title=A Conspiracy Exposed |pages=55–60 |quote=This is a business association merely ... it has no creed or confession ... it is merely a business convenience in disseminating the truth. }}</ref><ref>''Historical Dictionary of Jehovah's Witnesses'' by [[George D.

Russell moved the Watch Tower Society's headquarters to [[Brooklyn]], New York, in 1909, combining printing and corporate offices with a house of worship; volunteers were housed in a nearby residence he named ''Bethel''.

On July 26, 1931, at a convention in [[Columbus, Ohio]], Rutherford introduced the new name – ''Jehovah's witnesses'' – based on [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 43:10: "'Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.'" (King James Version, KJV) —which was adopted by resolution.

From 1932, it was taught that the "little flock" of 144,000 would not be the only people to survive Armageddon. Rutherford explained that in addition to the 144,000 "anointed" who would be resurrected—or transferred at death—to live in heaven to rule over earth with Christ, a separate class of members, the "great multitude," would live in a paradise restored on earth; from 1935, new converts to the movement were considered part of that class.<ref>{{harvnb|Beckford|1975|page=31}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Penton|1997|pages=71–72}}</ref> By the mid-1930s, the timing of the beginning of Christ's presence (Greek: ''parousía''), his enthronement as king, and the start of the "[[end times|last days]]" were each moved to 1914.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crompton|first=Robert|title=Counting the Days to Armageddon|publisher=James Clarke & Co|year=1996|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-227-67939-5|pages=109–110}}</ref>

===Life after death===
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation}}
Jehovah's Witnesses believe death is a state of non-existence with no [[consciousness]]. There is no [[Christian views on hell|Hell]] of fiery torment; [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]] and [[Sheol]] are understood to refer to the condition of death, termed the ''common grave''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoekema|1963|pages=322–324}}</ref> Jehovah's Witnesses consider the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to be a life or a living body that can die.<ref name="hoeksin">{{harvnb|Hoekema|1963|pages=265–269}}</ref> Jehovah's Witnesses believe that humanity is in a [[Christian views of sin#Protestant views|sinful]] state,<ref name="hoeksin" /> from which release is only possible by means of Jesus' shed blood as a ransom, or [[substitutionary atonement|atonement]], for the sins of humankind.<ref>{{harvnb|Penton|1997|page=186}}</ref>

Witnesses believe that a "little flock" of 144,000 selected humans go to heaven, but that the majority (the "other sheep") are to be resurrected by God to a cleansed earth after Armageddon. They interpret [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 14:1–5 to mean that the number of Christians going to heaven is limited to exactly 144,000, who will rule with Jesus as kings and priests over earth.<ref>{{harvnb|Penton|1997|page=193–194}}</ref> They believe that baptism as a Jehovah's Witness  is vital for salvation<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|edition=study|date=March 2016|page=4|title=Young Ones&mdash;Are You Ready to Get Baptized|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2016201|quote=It is a great privilege to get baptized as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

===God's Kingdom===
Jehovah's Witnesses believe that [[Kingdom of God|God's Kingdom]] is a literal government in heaven, ruled by Jesus Christ and 144,000 "spirit-anointed" Christians drawn from the earth, which they associate with Jesus' reference to a "new covenant".<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|date=January 15, 2012 |title=A Royal Priesthood to Benefit All Mankind |pages=26–30 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2012046 }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hoekema|1963|pages=295–296}}</ref> The kingdom is viewed as the means by which God will accomplish his original purpose for the earth, transforming it into a paradise without sickness or death.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan Rogerson|title=Millions Now Living Will Never Die|publisher=Constable|year=1969|page=106}}</ref> It is said to have been the focal point of Jesus' ministry on earth.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|date=October 15, 2000 |title=God's Kingdom—Earth's New Rulership |page=10 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2000763 }}</ref> They believe the kingdom was established in heaven in 1914,<ref>{{harvnb|Hoekema|1963|page=298}}</ref> and that Jehovah's Witnesses serve as representatives of the kingdom on earth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan Rogerson|title=Millions Now Living Will Never Die|publisher=Constable|year=1969|page=105}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|date=November 1, 1993 |title=Daniel's Prophetic Days and Our Faith|pages=8–9 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1993802|quote=In 1914 the appointed times of the nations ended, and the time of the end for this world began.

Without any doubt at all, it was the small body of anointed brothers of Jesus who in 1914 were known as the Bible Students but since 1931 have been identified as Jehovah's Witnesses. }}</ref>

===Eschatology===
{{Main|Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
A central teaching of Jehovah's Witnesses is that the current world era, or "system of things", entered the "[[End time|last days]]" in 1914 and faces imminent destruction through intervention by God and Jesus Christ, leading to deliverance for those who worship God acceptably.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoekema|1963|page=297}}</ref> They consider all other present-day religions to be false, identifying them with "[[Whore of Babylon#Jehovah's Witnesses|Babylon the Great]]", or the "harlot", of Revelation&nbsp;17,<ref>{{harvnb|Hoekema|1963|pages=286}}</ref> and believe that they will soon be destroyed by the [[United Nations]], which they believe is represented in scripture by the [[Jehovah's Witnesses and the United Nations|scarlet-colored wild beast]] of Revelation chapter 17. This development will mark the beginning of the "[[great tribulation]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=July 15, 2013|pages=4&ndash;5|title=Tell Us, When Will These Things Be?|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2013530|quote=In the larger fulfillment, the "standing" will occur when the United Nations (the modern-day "disgusting thing") attacks Christendom (which is holy in the eyes of nominal Christians) and the rest of Babylon the Great. The same attack is described at Revelation 17:16-18. That event will be the beginning of the great tribulation.}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|title=Apocalypse—When?|date=February 15, 1986|page=6}}</ref> Satan will subsequently use world governments to attack Jehovah's Witnesses, an action that will prompt God to begin the war of [[Armageddon]], during which all forms of government and all people not counted as Christ's "sheep" will be destroyed.

This judgment will be based on their actions after resurrection rather than past deeds. At the end of the thousand years, Christ will hand all authority back to God. Then a final test will take place when Satan is released to mislead perfect mankind. Those who fail will be destroyed, along with Satan and his demons. The end result will be a fully tested, glorified human race on earth.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoekema|1963|pages=307–321}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=November 1, 1952|page=670|title=Questions From Readers|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1952809}}</ref>

Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus Christ began to rule in heaven as king of God's kingdom in October 1914, and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth, resulting in "woe" to humanity. They believe that Jesus rules invisibly, from heaven, perceived only as a series of "signs". They base this belief on a rendering of the Greek word ''[[parousia]]''—usually translated as "coming" when referring to Christ—as "presence". They believe Jesus' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914, and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth. They thus depart from the mainstream Christian belief that the "[[second coming]]" of [[Matthew 24]] refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans.<ref>{{harvnb|Penton|1997|page=17–19}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=October 1, 1992|page=16|title=The Messiah's Presence and His Rule|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1992723}}</ref>

==Practices==
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses practices}}

===Worship===
[[File:Reunião em Salão do Reino.jpg|thumb|right|Worship at a [[Kingdom Hall]] in Portugal]]
Meetings for worship and study are held at [[Kingdom Hall]]s, which are typically functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols.<ref name=holdenhall /> Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose "territory" they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as "meetings" as scheduled by congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible. The format of the meetings is established by the group's headquarters, and the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide.<ref name=holdenhall>{{harvnb|Holden|2002|Portrait|pages=64–69}}</ref> Congregations meet for two sessions each week comprising four distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours, typically gathering mid-week (two meetings) and on the weekend (two meetings). Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for "family worship".<ref>{{cite book|title=Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|publisher=Watchtower Bible and Tract Society|year=2010|page=6|chapter=Highlights of the Past Year|chapter-url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/302010009}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|date=May 15, 2011|title=Christian Families—"Keep Ready" |page=14 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011364 }}</ref> Gatherings are opened and closed with [[hymns]] (which they call [[Kingdom song]]s) and brief prayers. Twice each year, Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a "circuit" gather for a one-day assembly. Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day "regional convention", usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums.<ref>{{cite book|title=Organized to Do Jehovah's Will|year=2015|pages=63&ndash;64|publisher=Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society}}</ref> Their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the "Lord's Evening Meal", or "[[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Memorial of Christ's death|Memorial of Christ's Death]]" on the date of the Jewish [[Passover]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hoekema|1963|page=292}}</ref>

==Sociological analysis==
{{See also|Sociological classifications of religious movements}}
Sociologist [[James A. Beckford]], in his 1975 study of Jehovah's Witnesses, classified the group's organizational structure as ''Totalizing'', characterized by an assertive leadership, specific and narrow objectives, control over competing demands on members' time and energy, and control over the quality of new members. Other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities, reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations, a high rate of membership turnover, a low rate of doctrinal change, and strict uniformity of beliefs among members.<ref>{{harvnb|Beckford|1975|pages=92, 98–100}}</ref> Beckford identified the group's chief characteristics as ''historicism'' (identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of God's purpose), ''absolutism'' (conviction that Jehovah's Witness leaders dispense absolute truth), ''activism'' (capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks), ''rationalism'' (conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery), ''authoritarianism'' (rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism) and ''world indifference'' (rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments).<ref>{{harvnb|Beckford|1975|pages=196–207}}</ref>

Sociologist [[Bryan R. Wilson]], in his consideration of five religious groups including Jehovah's Witnesses, noted that each of the denominations:<ref>Bryan R. Wilson, "The Persistence of Sects", ''Diskus'', Journal of the British Association for the Study of Religions, Vol 1, No. 2, 1993</ref>
# "exists in a state of tension with the wider society;"
# "imposes tests of merit on would-be members;"
# "exercises stern discipline, regulating the declared beliefs and the life habits of members and prescribing and operating sanctions for those who deviate, including the possibility of expulsion;"
# "demands sustained and total commitment from its members, and the subordination, and perhaps even the exclusion of all other interests."

A sociological comparative study by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that Jehovah's Witnesses in the [[United States]] ranked highest in statistics for getting no further than high school graduation, belief in God, importance of religion in one's life, frequency of religious attendance, frequency of prayers, frequency of Bible reading outside of religious services, belief their prayers are answered, belief that their religion can only be interpreted one way, belief that theirs is the only one true faith leading to eternal life, opposition to abortion, and opposition to homosexuality. In the study, Jehovah's Witnesses ranked lowest in statistics for having an interest in politics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2008/06/01/u-s-religious-landscape-survey-religious-beliefs-and-practices|title=Religious Beliefs and Practices|work=U.S. Religious Landscape Survey|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=December 14, 2017|date=June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/educational-distribution/by/religious-tradition/|title=Educational distribution by religious group|work=U.S. Religious Landscape Survey|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=December 14, 2017|date=June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/religious-tradition/jehovahs-witness|title=Jehovah's Witnesses|work=U.S. Religious Landscape Survey|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}</ref> It was also among the most ethnically diverse religious groups in the US.<ref name="pewfact"/><!--The small sample size of JWs (215) in comparison to other groups surveyed—over 9000 Evangelicals, over 8000 Catholics, over 7000 'mainline' churches, etc, total 35556) may skew these results-->

==Opposition==
Controversy surrounding various beliefs, doctrines and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses has led to opposition from governments, communities, and religious groups. Religious commentator Ken Jubber wrote that "Viewed globally, this persecution has been so persistent and of such intensity that it would not be inaccurate to regard Jehovah's Witnesses as the most persecuted group of Christians of the twentieth century."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jubber|first=Ken|title=The Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Southern Africa|journal=Social Compass|volume=24|issue=1|pages=121–134|year=1977|doi=10.1177/003776867702400108|s2cid=143997010}}</ref>

Political and religious animosity against Jehovah's Witnesses has at times led to [[mob action]] and [[government]] oppression in various countries.
Their stance regarding political neutrality and their refusal to serve in the military has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription during [[World War II]] and at other times where [[national service]] has been compulsory.

Authors including [[William J.

In the United States, legal challenges by Jehovah's Witnesses prompted a series of state and federal court rulings that reinforced judicial protections for civil liberties.<ref>Botting, ''Fundamental Freedoms and Jehovah's Witnesses'', pp. 1–14; Shawn Francis Peters, ''Judging Jehovah's Witnesses'', University Press of Kansas: 2000, pages 12–16.</ref> Among the rights strengthened by Witness court victories in the United States are the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference, the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service, the right of patients to refuse medical treatment, and the right to engage in public discourse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knocking.org/Jehovahs_Witness_History_Civil_Rights.html|title=Jehovah's Witnesses and civil rights|publisher=Knocking.org|accessdate=August 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901075011/http://www.knocking.org/Jehovahs_Witness_History_Civil_Rights.html|archive-date=September 1, 2012}}</ref> Similar cases in their favor have been heard in Canada.<ref>Botting, ''Fundamental Freedoms...'', pp. 15–201</ref>

==Criticism and controversy==
{{Main|Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
Jehovah's Witnesses have received criticism from mainstream Christianity, members of the medical community, former members and commentators regarding [[Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs|their beliefs]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices|practices]]. The movement has been accused of doctrinal inconsistency and reversals, failed predictions, mistranslation of the Bible, harsh treatment of former members and autocratic and coercive leadership. Criticism has also focused on their rejection of [[blood transfusion]]s, particularly in life-threatening medical situations, and failing to report cases of [[sexual abuse]] to the authorities. Many of the claims are denied by Jehovah's Witnesses and some have also been disputed by courts and religious scholars.

Some of it may lack the precision that its detractors appear to demand, but the Society's position is quite clear. Jehovah's Witnesses do not claim to have any new revelation or people who are designated as prophets. As cessationists, they identify the ability to prophesy as a gift that died out with the first generation of Christians, but prophetic utterances remain in the Bible, which serves as the key source of authority. ... since the Bible is held to contain predictive prophecy, Jehovah's Witnesses claim to see into the future through the Society's interpretation of scripture." pg 225.</ref> With these interpretations, Jehovah's Witnesses' publications have made various predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible.<ref name=WT59>{{cite magazine |magazine=The Watchtower|date=January 15, 1959 |title=Down with the Old-Up with the New! |pages=39–41 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1959041 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Crompton|first=Robert|title=Counting the Days to Armageddon|publisher=James Clarke & Co|year=1996|location=Cambridge|pages=9, 115|isbn=978-0-227-67939-5}}</ref> Failed predictions have led to the alteration or abandonment of some doctrines.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jehovah's Witnesses—Proclaimers of God's Kingdom|publisher=Watchtower Bible and Tract Society|year=1993|pages=78, 632|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101993008}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Beckford|1975|pages=219–221}}</ref> Some failed predictions had been presented as "beyond doubt" or "approved by God".<ref>James A.
