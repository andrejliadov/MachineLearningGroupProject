'''Criticism of Buddhism''' has taken numerous different forms, including that its practitioners act in ways contrary to Buddhist principles or that those principles systemically marginalize women. There are many sources of criticism, both ancient and modern, stemming from other religions, the non-religious, and other Buddhists.

Most schools of Buddhism have more rules for ''[[bhikkunis]]'' (nuns) than ''[[bhikkus]]'' (monk) lineages. Theravada Buddhists explain that in the time of the [[Buddha]], nuns had such problems like safety if they were to be ordained the same way as monks who traveled around in the forest and between cities. Thus, more rules have to be created for nuns; for instance: nuns are forbidden to travel alone.<ref>[http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/WomenInBuddhism2.html Women in Buddhism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504040739/http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/WomenInBuddhism2.html |date=2009-05-04 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>

[[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]] referred to the [[Dalai Lama]]'s statement at the 2007 Hamburg congress:<ref name="studybuddhism.com">Berzin Summary Report [http://studybuddhism.com/web/en/archives/approaching_buddhism/world_today/summary_report_2007_international_c/part_4.html#n063b0e55a12ff6f34 Human Rights and the Status of Women in Buddhism]</ref>
{{quote|Sometimes in religion there has been an emphasis on male importance. In Buddhism, however, the highest vows, namely the bhikshu and bhikshuni ones, are equal and entail the same rights. This is the case despite the fact that in some ritual areas, due to social custom, bhikshus go first. But Buddha gave the basic rights equally to both sangha groups. There is no point in discussing whether or not to revive the bhikshuni ordination; the question is merely how to do so properly within the context of the Vinaya.|}}

The most criticised doctrine is found in [[Amitābha|Amida Buddha's]] vow 35: "The Buddha established the Vow of transformation [women] into men, Thereby vowing to enable women to attain Buddhahood".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingdharma.org/Living.Dharma.Articles/WomenInBuddhism4.html|title=Women In Buddhism Part IV by Rev.

===Nationalism===
{{See also|Religious nationalism|Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism|Nichirenism}}
In medieval Southeast Asia, there were a number of Buddhist states, including the [[Pagan Kingdom]], the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], and the [[Kingdom of Polonnaruwa]]. In [[Sri Lanka]] especially, modern monks frequently involve themselves in nationalist politics.<ref>Ananda Abeysekara, "[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3270564 The Saffron Army, Violence, Terror(ism): Buddhism, Identity, and Difference in Sri Lanka]". ''Numen'' 48.1 (2001).</ref> These Buddhist nationalists have been opposed by the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]], a [[self-governance]] movement led by the Buddhist [[A. T. Ariyaratne]] and based in Buddhist ideals, who condemn the use of violence and the denial of [[human rights]] to [[Tamils]] and other non-Buddhists.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas Banchoff|author-link=Thomas Banchoff|author2=Robert Wuthnow|author2-link=Robert Wuthnow|title=Religion and the Global Politics of Human Rights|date=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=[[Oxford]]|isbn=9780199841035|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oVViGSEpu8C&pg=PA178|accessdate=17 June 2015}}</ref>

[[Maung Zarni]], a Burmese democracy advocate, human rights campaigner, and a research fellow at the [[London School of Economics]] who has written on the violence in Myanmar and Sri Lanka, states that there is no room for fundamentalism in Buddhism. "No Buddhist can be nationalistic," said Zarni, "There is no country for Buddhists. I mean, no such thing as ‘me,’ ‘my’ community, ‘my’ country, ‘my’ race or even ‘my’ faith."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/nirvanaless-asian-buddhisms-growing-fundamentalist-streak/2014/05/01/9af7413c-d161-11e3-a714-be7e7f142085_story.html|title=Nirvanaless: Asian Buddhism's growing fundamentalist streak|author1=Pujari|first=Anuradha Sharma|author-link=Anuradha Sharma Pujari|last2=Arora|first2=Vishal|author-link2=Vishal Arora|date=1 May 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=14 October 2019}}</ref>

===Accusations of violence===
{{main|Buddhism and violence}}
Violence in Buddhism refers to acts of violence and aggression committed by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] with religious, political, and socio-cultural motivations. Buddhism is generally seen as among the religious traditions least associated with violence,<ref>Buddhist Warfare by Michael Jerryson and Mark Juergensmeyer / Oxford University Press 2010, p.3 {{ISBN|978-0-19-539484-9}}</ref> but in the history of Buddhism there have been acts of violence directed, fomented or inspired by Buddhists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jerryson|first1=Michael|title=Buddhist Warfare|url=https://archive.org/details/buddhistwarfare00jerr|url-access=limited|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539483-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/buddhistwarfare00jerr/page/n36 24]}}</ref>

== Criticism of Buddhist doctrine ==
=== Accusations of nihilism ===
{{See also|Nihilism|Sukha}}
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], through [[Schopenhauer]] whose pessimism was highly influenced by Buddhist philosophy, interpreted Buddhism as a life-negating philosophy that seeks to escape an existence dominated by [[suffering]]. According to Omar Moad, Nietzsche misunderstood the meaning of Buddhist doctrine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/buddhism.htm|title=Buddhism and Nietzsche|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> The term ''[[Dukkha]]'' has different meanings and is neither pessimistic nor optimistic.<ref>{{Citation| author=Rupert Gethin| author-link=Rupert Gethin| year =1998 | title =Foundations of Buddhism | url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/The%20Foundations%20of%20Buddhism_Gethin_1998.pdf | publisher =[[Oxford University Press]] | page=62}}</ref><ref>{{Citation| author=Walpola Rahula| author-link=Walpola Rahula| year =2014 | title =What the Buddha Taught | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8CcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT525 | pages=525–541 | publisher = [[Oneworld Publications]] | isbn=9781780740003}}</ref> ''Dukkha'' may mean disappointment, desires, cravings, bereavement, unfulfillment, or dissatisfaction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/beliefs/fournobletruths_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Buddhism: The Four Noble Truths|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref>

Lama [[Surya Das]] emphasizes the matter-of-fact nature of ''Dukkha'':<ref>{{Citation| author =Surya Das| author-link =Surya Das| year =2009 | title =Awakening the Buddha Within | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9_fMzGKtWsC | publisher =Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony | isbn=9780385530989}}</ref>
{{quote|Buddha Dharma does not teach that everything is suffering. What Buddhism does say is that life, by its nature, is difficult, flawed, and imperfect. [...] That's the nature of life, and that's the First Noble Truth. From the Buddhist point of view, this is not a judgement of life's joys and sorrows; this is a simple, down-to-earth, matter-of-fact description.}}

While the Buddha describes the flawed and imperfect nature of life in the first noble truth, he also points to the causes that underlie this imperfection and how to bring these causes to an end.<ref>https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part1.html</ref>

===Confucian criticism===
Buddhism is sometimes seen as antithetical to much of [[Confucian philosophy]]. Due to the focus on social roles as the source of ethical obligation in Confucianism compared to the seemingly inherent nonconformity of Buddhism, there was a sustained ethical critique of Buddhism in early Confucianism. While Buddhism entails the belief there is nothing rightfully considered the self, Confucianism emphasized the self a great deal in their doctrines of self-development and societal roles. As a consequence Buddhism was considered by many to be [[Nihilism|nihilistic]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://history.cultural-china.com/en/165History5834.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321175102/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/165History5834.html |archive-date=2016-03-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Arguments of secular origin===

[[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], a prominent proponent of [[New Atheism]]<ref>Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens and [[Daniel Dennett]] have been described as the "Four Horsemen" of the "New Atheism".

[[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]], author of "Buddhism without Beliefs" has written about karma and rebirth, asserting that the Buddha “did not claim to have had experience that granted him privileged, esoteric knowledge of how the universe ticks”. However, his critics point out that his assertion is contrary to the earliest written records of the Buddha's teaching as well as hundreds of years of academic study on the topic. They also point to a lack of scholarly research on Batchelor's part to give credibility to his claims; and suggest that Batchelor may be attempting to reshape Buddhism due to his own discomfort with concepts such as karma and rebirth.<ref>http://fpmt.org/mandala/archives/mandala-issues-for-2010/october/distorted-visions-of-buddhism-agnostic-and-atheist/</ref>
