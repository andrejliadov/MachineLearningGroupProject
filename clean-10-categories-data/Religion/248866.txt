'''Our Lady of Fátima''' ({{lang-pt|Nossa Senhora de Fátima}}, formally known as '''Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of Fátima''', {{IPA-pt|ˈnɔsɐ sɨˈɲɔɾɐ dɨ ˈfatimɐ|eu}} {{IPA-pt|ˈnɔsɐ siˈɲɔɾɐ d(ʒ)i ˈfatʃimɐ|br}}), is a [[Catholic]] title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] based on the [[Marian apparition]]s reported in 1917 by three shepherd children at the [[Cova da Iria]], in [[Fátima, Portugal]]. The three children were [[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia dos Santos]] and her cousins [[Francisco and Jacinta Marto]].

Bishop [[José Alves Correia da Silva]] declared the events ''worthy of belief'' on 13 October 1930.<ref name=worthy>{{cite web|url=http://www.miraclehunter.com/marian_apparitions/statements/fatima_statement_02.html|title=Results of the Investigative Commission|date=October 1930|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref>  On 13 May 1946, [[Pope Pius XII]] granted a [[canonical coronation]] to the venerated image enshrined at the Chapel of the Apparitions of Fátima via his [[Papal legate|apostolic legate]], Cardinal [[Benedetto Aloisi Masella]]. On 11 November 1954, he raised the [[Sanctuary of Fátima]] to the status of a [[minor basilica]] by his papal brief ''Lucer superna''.

The published memoirs of Lúcia dos Santos in the 1930s revealed two secrets that she claimed came from the Virgin while the third secret was to be revealed by the Catholic Church in 1960. The controversial events at Fátima gained fame due partly to elements of the secrets, [[prophecy]] and [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] revelations allegedly related to the [[World War II|Second World War]] and possibly more global wars in the future, particularly the Virgin's alleged request for the [[Consecration of Russia]] to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

==History==
===Prelude===
[[File:AnjodePortugal.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Monument of the [[Guardian Angel of Portugal]].]]

===Marian apparitions===
Beginning in the spring of 1917, the children reported apparitions of an Angel, and starting in May 1917, apparitions of the [[Virgin Mary]], whom the children described as "the Lady more brilliant than the Sun". The children reported a prophecy that prayer would lead to an end to the [[World War I|Great War]], and that on 13 October that year the Lady would reveal her identity and perform a miracle "so that all may believe."<ref><!-- Which one? -->De Marchi 1952:118</ref>  Newspapers reported the prophecies, and many pilgrims began visiting the area. The children's accounts were deeply controversial, drawing intense criticism from both local secular and religious authorities.  A provincial administrator briefly took the children into custody, believing the prophecies were politically motivated in opposition to the officially secular [[First Portuguese Republic]] established in 1910.<ref>Bennett, 2012</ref> The events of 28
October became known as the [[Miracle of the Sun]].

[[File:Calváro Hungaro Fatima 0593 (18588992344).jpg|thumb|225px|left|Statue dedicated to the apparition.]]
On 13 May 1917, the children reported seeing a woman "brighter than the sun, shedding rays of light clearer and stronger than a crystal goblet filled with the most sparkling water and pierced by the burning rays of the sun."<ref name=cna/> The woman wore a white mantle edged with gold and held a rosary in her hand. She asked them to devote themselves to the Holy Trinity and to pray "the Rosary every day, to bring peace to the world and an end to the war".<ref name=cna>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=485|title=Our Lady of Fatima|publisher= Catholic News Agency (CNA)|accessdate=8 September 2016}}</ref> While the children had never told anyone about seeing the angel, Jacinta told her family about seeing the brightly lit woman. Lúcia had earlier said that the three should keep this experience private. Jacinta's disbelieving mother told neighbors about it as a joke, and within a day the whole village knew of the children's vision.<ref name="heart">De Marchi, John. ''The Immaculate Heart,'' New York: Farrar, Straus and Young, 1952</ref>

[[File:ChildrensofFatima.jpg|thumb|right|245px|[[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia dos Santos]] (left) with her cousins [[Francisco and Jacinta Marto]], 1917]]
The children said the woman told them to return to the Cova da Iria on 13 June 1917. Lúcia's mother sought counsel from the parish priest, Father Ferreira, who suggested she allow them to go. He asked to have Lúcia brought to him afterward so that he could question her. The second appearance occurred on 13 June, the feast of [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]], patron of the local parish church. On this occasion the lady revealed that Francisco and Jacinta would be taken to Heaven soon, but Lúcia would live longer in order to spread her message and devotion to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]].<ref name=cna/><ref name=Bennett />

During the June visit, the children said the lady told them to say the [[Rosary|Holy Rosary]] daily in honor of [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] to obtain peace and the end of the Great War. (Three weeks earlier, on 21 April, the first contingent of Portuguese soldiers had embarked for the front lines of the war.) The lady also purportedly revealed to the children a vision of hell, and entrusted a secret to them, described as "good for some and bad for others".<ref name=Bennett/> Fr. Ferreira later stated that Lúcia recounted that the lady told her, "I want you to come back on the thirteenth and to learn to read in order to understand what I want of you. ...I don't want more."<ref>Santuário de Fátima, 1992, 12</ref>

[[File:Igreja Matriz de Fátima - Portugal (21418731630).jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Parish Church of Fátima]] where the three children who saw the apparition were baptized.]]
In the following months, thousands of people flocked to Fátima and nearby Aljustrel, drawn by reports of visions and miracles. On 13 August 1917, the provincial administrator [[Artur Santos (journalist)|Artur Santos]]<ref>Jaki, Stanley. ''God and the Sun at Fátima'' (1999) Real View Books, Michigan, p. 15.</ref> (no relation to Lúcia dos Santos) intervened, as he believed that these events were politically disruptive in the conservative country. He took the children into custody, jailing them before they could reach the Cova da Iria. Santos interrogated and threatened the children to get them to divulge the contents of the secrets. Lúcia's mother hoped the officials could persuade the children to end the affair and admit that they had lied.<ref name=Bennett/> Lúcia told Santos everything short of the secrets, and offered to ask the woman for permission to tell the official the secrets.<ref name=cges />

That month, instead of the usual apparition in the Cova da Iria on 13 August, the children reported that they saw the Virgin Mary on 19 August, a Sunday, at nearby [[Valinhos (Fátima)|Valinhos]]. She asked them again to pray the rosary daily, spoke about the miracle coming in October, and asked them "to pray a lot, a lot for the sinners and [[Mortification in Roman Catholic teaching|sacrifice a lot]], as many souls perish in hell because nobody is praying or [[Acts of Reparation|making sacrifices for them]]."<ref name="heart"/>

The three children claimed to have seen the Blessed Virgin Mary in a total of six apparitions between 13 May and 13 October 1917. Lúcia also reported a seventh Marian apparition at [[Cova da Iria]]. 2017 marked the 100th anniversary of the apparitions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| url=https://www.britannica.com/spotlight/100th-anniversary-of-our-lady-of-ftima| title=100th Anniversary of Our Lady of Fátima| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| access-date=2017-05-16| first=Melissa| last=Petruzzello| language=en}}</ref>

===Miracle of the Sun===

[[File:Newspaper fatima 353.jpg|thumb|200px|Page from ''Ilustração Portuguesa,'' 29 October 1917, showing the people looking at the Sun during the Fátima apparitions attributed to the Virgin Mary]]
After some newspapers reported that the Virgin Mary had promised a miracle for the last of her apparitions on 13 October, a huge crowd, possibly between 30,000 and 100,000,<ref>{{cite book| first=John| last=De Marchi| year=1952| title=The True Story of Fátima| publisher=Catechetical Guild Entertainment Society| location=St. Paul, Minnesota}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|De Marchi|1952|p=177}}</ref> including reporters and photographers, gathered at Cova da Iria. What happened then became known as the "Miracle of the Sun".

Various claims have been made as to what actually happened during the event. The three children who originally claimed to have seen Our Lady of Fátima reported seeing a panorama of visions during the event, including those of [[Jesus]], [[Our Lady of Sorrows]], [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]], and of [[Saint Joseph]] blessing the people.<ref>De Marchi 1952b:151–166</ref> Father John De Marchi, an Italian Catholic priest and researcher wrote several books on the subject, which included descriptions by witnesses who believed they had seen a miracle created by [[Mary, Mother of God]].<ref name=cges>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/tsfatima.htm De Marchi, John. ''True Story of Fatima'', Catechetical Guild Educational Society, St. Paul, Minnesota, 1956]</ref> According to accounts, after a period of rain, the dark clouds broke and the Sun appeared as an opaque, spinning disc in the sky. It was said to be significantly duller than normal, and to cast multicolored lights across the landscape, the people, and the surrounding clouds. The Sun was then reported to have careened towards the Earth before zig-zagging back to its normal position.<ref name="Bennett">{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5AaCA1qA0QAC&q=miracle+of+the+sun+october+13+1917&pg=PT102| last=Bennett| first=Jeffrey S.| title=When the Sun Danced: Myth, Miracles, and Modernity in Early Twentieth-Century Portugal| publisher=University of Virginia Press| year=2012|

Francisco and Jacinta Marto died in the international [[1918 flu pandemic|flu pandemic that began in 1918]] and swept the world for two years. Francisco Marto died at home on 4 April 1919, at the age of ten. Jacinta died at the age of nine in [[Hospital de Dona Estefânia|Queen Stephanie's Children's Hospital]] in [[Lisbon]] on 20 February 1920. They are buried at the [[Sanctuary of Fátima]].

At the age of fourteen, in 1922 [[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia]] was sent to the school of the Sisters of [[Dorothea of Caesarea|St. Dorothy]] (Dorothean) in Vilar, a suburb of [[Porto]], Portugal. In 1928 she became a [[postulant]] at the convent of the Sisters of St. Dorothy in [[Tui, Pontevedra|Tui]], [[Spain]], near the border with Portugal. Lúcia continued to report private visions periodically throughout her life. She reported seeing the Virgin Mary again in 1925 in the convent. This time she said she was asked to convey the message of the [[First Saturdays Devotion]]. She said that a subsequent vision of Christ as a child reiterated this request. In 1929, Lúcia reported that Mary returned and repeated her request for the [[Consecration of Russia]] to her [[Immaculate Heart of Mary|Immaculate Heart]]. She also reported an apparition in [[Rianxo]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], in 1931, in which she said that Jesus visited her, taught her two prayers, and delivered a message to give to the church's hierarchy.

In 1936 and again in 1941, Sister Lúcia said that the Virgin Mary had predicted the deaths of her two cousins during the second apparition on 13 June 1917. According to Lúcia's 1941 account, on 13 June, Lúcia asked the Virgin if the three children would go to heaven when they died. She said that she heard Mary reply, "Yes, I shall take Francisco and Jacinta soon, but you will remain a little longer, since Jesus wishes you to make me known and loved on Earth. He wishes also for you to establish devotion in the world to my Immaculate Heart."<ref name="heart62">{{Harv|De Marchi|1952|p=62}}</ref>

In 1947, Sister Lúcia left the Dorothean order. She joined the [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite Order]] in a monastery in [[Coimbra]], Portugal. Lúcia died on 13 February 2005, at the age of 97.

==Pilgrimage==

The widely reported miracle of the Sun contributed to Fátima quickly becoming a major centre of pilgrimage. Two million pilgrims visited the site in the decade following the events of 1917.<ref>Ian Bradley, ''Pilgrimage: A Spiritual and Cultural Journey,'' Lion Hudson (2009), p. 68</ref> A small chapel – the ''Capelinha'' – was built by local people on the site of the apparitions. The construction was neither encouraged nor hindered by the Catholic Church authorities.

On 13 May 1920, pilgrims defied government troops to install a statue of the Virgin Mary in the chapel.<ref name=LaBoda>{{cite book| title=International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74JI2UlcU8AC&q=fatima| first=Sharon| last=LaBoda| editor1-last=Ring| editor1-first=Trudy| editor2-last=Salkin| editor3-last=La Boda| editor3-first=Sharon| publisher=Taylor & Francis| date=1 January 1996| isbn=978-1884964022| page=245}}</ref> The [[Holy Sacrifice of the Mass]] was first officially celebrated there in January 1924. A hostel for the sick was begun in that year. In 1927 the first rector of the sanctuary was appointed, and a set of [[Stations of the Cross]] were erected on the mountain road. The foundation stone for the present basilica was laid the next year.<ref>[[Leo Madigan]], ''A Pilgrim's Handbook to Fátima,'' Gracewing Publishing, 2001 pp. 20–24</ref>

In 1930 the Catholic Church officially recognised the apparition events as "worthy of belief" and granted a papal [[indulgence]] to pilgrims visiting [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]]. In 1935 the bodies of the child visionaries, Francisco and Jacinta, were reinterred in the basilica. [[Pope Pius XII]] granted a [[Canonical Coronation]] of the statue of Our Lady of Fátima on 13 May 1946. This event drew such large crowds that the entrance to the site had to be barred.<ref>Madigan, ''A Pilgrim's Handbook to Fátima'', 2001, p. 24</ref>

In the 21st century, pilgrimage to the site takes place year round. Additional chapels, hospitals and other facilities have been constructed at the site. The principal pilgrimage festivals take place on the thirteenth day of each month, from May to October, on the anniversaries of the original apparitions. The largest crowds gather on 13 May and 13 October, when up to a [[million]] pilgrims have attended to pray and witness processions of the statue of Our Lady of Fátima, both during the day and by the light of tens of thousands of candles at night.<ref name=LaBoda/>

==Official position of the Catholic Church==
The reported visions at Fátima gathered widespread attention, as numerous pilgrims began to visit the site. After a canonical inquiry, the Bishop of Leiria-Fátima officially declared the visions of Fátima as "worthy of belief" in October 1930, officially permitting the belief of Our Lady of Fátima.<ref>"In virtue of considerations made known, and others which for reason of brevity we omit; humbly invoking the Divine Spirit and placing ourselves under the protection of the most Holy Virgin, and after hearing the opinions of our Rev. Advisors in this diocese, we hereby: 1) Declare worthy of belief, the visions of the shepherd children in the Cova da Iria, parish of Fátima, in this diocese, from 13 May to 13 October 1917. 2) Permit officially the belief of Our Lady of Fátima.", Bishop of Leiria-Fátima, 13 October 1930.</ref>

==Political aspects==
{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}
At the time of the apparitions, Portugal was undergoing tensions between the secularizing [[First Portuguese Republic#Religion|Republican government]] and more conservative elements in society. The [[Portuguese First Republic|First Republic]] had begun with the [[5 October 1910 revolution|revolution of 1910]] overthrowing the constitutional monarch.  It was intensely anticlerical and provoked a strong conservative reaction, ultimately leading to the military coup of 1926. Later in Spain during the 1920s and 1930s, as the forces of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] gathered strength, armies of faithful Roman  Catholics carried images of the Virgin Mary, as protest and protection against groups they called godless.<ref>{{cite book| last=Vincent| first=Mary| title=Catholicism in the Second Spanish Republic: Religion and Politics in Salamanca, 1930–1936| place=New York City| publisher=Clarendon Press| series=Oxford historical monographs| date=25 July 1996| pages=82–108| isbn=978-0198206132}}</ref>

During the Spanish Second Republic, apparitions of the Virgin Mary were seen on Spanish soil at [[Ezquioga]]. Ramona Olazabal said that Mary had marked the palms of her hands with a sword. Seers gained much credence in [[Integrist]] and [[Carlist]] circles. The visions at Ezquioga were widely covered in the press, as were sixteen other visitations of the Virgin reported in 1931 in Spain. Conservative elements in the Spanish Catholic Church actively encouraged the Fátima devotion as a way of countering the perceived threat of atheistic [[Communism]]. In Portugal and its former colony of [[Brazil]], conservative groups were sometimes associated with the adoration of Fátima. When Germany invaded Russia in 1941, some Catholics interpreted this in terms of the Fátima apparitions, and believed that the Virgin's prophecy was about to be fulfilled.

The original apparitions took place during the six months preceding the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, and the children related that the Lady talked to them about the need to pray for Russia. Lúcia admitted later that the children initially thought she was requesting prayers for a girl named Russia. In the first edition of Sister Lúcia's memoirs, published after the outbreak of World War II, she focused on the issue of Russia. The warning by the Lady that "if Russia was not consecrated to God, it would spread errors throughout the world" was often seized upon as an anti-communist rallying cry.

The [[Blue Army of Our Lady of Fátima]], for instance, has always been strongly anti-Communist and its members often associated the Fátima story in the context of the Cold War.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Kselman| first1=Thomas A.| last2=Avella| first2=Steven| title=Marian Piety and the Cold War in the United States| journal=[[The Catholic Historical Review]]| volume=72| issue=3| pages=402–424| date=July 1986| jstor=25022337}}</ref> The Blue Army is made up of Catholics and non-Catholics who believe that by dedicating themselves to daily prayer (specifically, of the [[Rosary]]), they can help to achieve world peace and put an end to the error of communism. Organizations such as the Blue Army (nowadays known as the World Apostolate of Fátima) have gained the approval of the Catholic Church.

==Memoirs of Sister Lúcia==
[[File:Pfärrich Pfarrkirche Marienstatue aus Fatima.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Statue depicting the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]] as described by Sister Lúcia.]]
The Fátima story developed in two parts: that which was reported in 1917, and information later mentioned in [[Sister Lúcia]]'s memoirs which she wrote years later, after the Church ruled that the events in Fátima were "worthy of belief." Her memoir was not subject to the same scrutiny.<ref name=Maunder>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTs6CwAAQBAJ&q=our+lady+of+f%C3%A1tima&pg=PA29| last=Maunder| first=Chris| title=Our Lady of the Nations: Apparitions of Mary in 20th-century Catholic Europe| publisher=Oxford University Press| date=25 April 2016| isbn=978-0198718383}}</ref> The early messages focused on the need to pray the rosary for peace and an end to World War I.

The alleged supernatural events in Fátima were not widely known outside [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] until Lúcia published her memoirs, starting in the late 1930s. Between 1935 and 1993, she wrote six memoirs. The first four, written between 1935 and 1941 during World War II, were published under the title ''[[Fatima in Lucia's Own Words]]'' (1976). The fifth and six memoirs, written in 1989 and 1993, are published as ''[[Fatima in Lucia's Own Words II]]''.

In the mid-1930s the Bishop of Leiria encouraged Lúcia (at that time named Sister Maria Lúcia das Dores) to write her memoirs, so that she might reveal further details of the 1917 apparitions. In her first memoir, published in 1935, focused on the holiness of Jacinta Marto. The deceased girl was by then popularly considered a saint.<ref name=Maunder/> In her second memoir, published in 1937, Lucia wrote more about her own life, the apparition of 13 June 1917, and first reveals the earlier apparitions of the Angel of Peace.<ref name=Maunder/>

Finding herself inundated with constantly repeated questions concerning the [[Marian apparition]]s occurred in [[Fátima, Portugal]], and the visionaries, the message they received and the reason for some of the requests contained in that message, and feeling that it was beyond her to reply individually to each questioner, [[Sister Lúcia]] asked the [[Holy See]] for permission to write a text in which she could reply in general to the many questions that had been put to her. This permission was granted and a new book was published entitled ''[[Calls from the Message of Fatima]]''.

===Three Secrets of Fátima===
{{Main|Three Secrets of Fátima}}
In her third memoir of 1941, Sister Lúcia described three secrets. She said these had been entrusted to the children during the apparition of 13 July 1917.

====First secret====
This was a vision of hell, which Lúcia said they experienced on 4 July 1917.<ref>Lúcia de Jesus, ''Fátima In Lúcia's Own words'' (1995), The Ravengate Press, pp. 101, 104</ref>

====Second secret====
This was a recommendation for devotion to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]] as a way to save souls and bring peace to the world. It predicted an end to the Great War, but predicted a worse one if people did not cease offending God. This second war would be presaged by a night illuminated by an unknown light, as a "great sign" that the time of chastisement was near. To avert this, Mary would return to ask for the consecration of [[Russia]] to the Immaculate Heart, and the establishment of the [[First Saturdays Devotion]]. If her requests were heeded, Russia would be converted, and there would be peace; if not, Russia would [[History of communism#Spreading Communism|spread her errors]]<ref>Ryan, Maurice (1993), "Fatima, Lourdes, and Medjugorje: A Challenge for Religious Educators", Religious Education, 88 (4): 564–575</ref> throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church.

=====Consecration of Russia=====
{{Main|Consecration of Russia|Pope Pius XII Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary|Sacro Vergente}}
[[File:Statue of Pope Pius XII in Fatima Portugal.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Pope Pius XII]] in Fátima, Portugal.]]

According to Sister Lúcia, the Virgin Mary promised that the [[Consecration of Russia]] would lead to Russia's conversion and an era of peace.<ref name="heart"/>  At the time the supposed request for the consecration of Russia was made, however, the [[Bolsheviks]] had not yet taken control of Russia.

[[Pope Pius XII]], in his Apostolic Letter ''[[Sacro Vergente]]'' of 7 July 1952, consecrated Russia to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Pius XII wrote,

:"Just as a few years ago We consecrated the entire human race to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin Mary, Mother of God, so today We consecrate and in a most special manner We entrust all the peoples of Russia to this Immaculate Heart..."<ref>PIUS PP. XII, Epist. apost. Sacro vergente anno de universae Russorum gentis Immaculato Mariae Cordi consecratione, [Ad universos Russiae populos], 7 July 1952: AAS 44(1952), pp. 505–</ref>

In 1952 the Pope said to the [[Russian people]] and the [[Stalinist regime]] that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Virgin Mary]] was always victorious. "The [[gates of hell]] will never prevail, where she offers her protection. She is the good mother, the mother of all, and it has never been heard, that those who seek her protection, will not receive it. With this certainty, the Pope dedicates all people of Russia to the immaculate heart of the Virgin. She will help! Error and [[atheism]] will be overcome with her assistance and divine grace."<ref>Sacro Vergente 12</ref>

Popes Pius XII and [[John Paul II]] both had a special relationship with Our Lady of Fátima. [[Pope Benedict XV]] began Pacelli's church career, elevating him to [[archbishop]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]] on 13 May 1917, the date of the first reported apparition. Pius XII was laid to rest in the crypt of Saint Peter's Basilica on 13 October 1958, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima.

Pope John Paul II again consecrated the entire world to the Virgin Mary in 1984, without explicitly mentioning Russia. Some believe that [[Sister Lúcia]] verified that this ceremony fulfilled the requests of the Virgin Mary.<ref>[http://www.catholicdoors.com/faq/qu26.htm Consecration of Russia FAQ] at catholicdoors.com, with quotations from Lúcia and pointing out possible signs that the 1984 consecration was sufficient. Page found 19 May 2010.</ref> However, in the [[Blue Army of Our Lady of Fátima|Blue Army's]] Spanish magazine, ''[[Sol de Fatima|Sol de Fátima]]'', in the September 1985 issue, Sister Lúcia said that the ceremony did not fulfil the Virgin Mary's request, as there was no specific mention of Russia and "many bishops attached no importance to it." In 2001, Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone met with Sister Lúcia, who reportedly told him, "I have already said that the consecration desired by Our Lady was made in 1984, and has been accepted in Heaven."<ref>{{cite web| last=Bertone| first=Tarciso| date=2001| title=Meeting with Sr Maria Lucia| type=web page| publisher=Eternal Word Television Network| place=Irondale, Alabama| url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDFLUCIA.HTM| accessdate=29 July 2016}}</ref> Sister Lúcia died on 13 February 2005, without making any further public statement of her own to settle the issue.

Some maintain that, according to Lúcia and Fátima advocates such as Abbé [[League for Catholic Counter-Reformation|Georges de Nantes]], Fr. Paul Kramer and [[Nicholas Gruner]], Russia has never been specifically consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary by any Pope simultaneously with all the world's bishops, which is what Lúcia in the 1985 interview had said Mary had asked for. Two interviews with Sister Lucia, in 1992 and 1993, tape recorded and televised with the Seer's permission on Portuguese State Television RTP1 and on SIC, TVI iand RAI 2, in March 1998, finally clarified the Seer's personal opinion regarding the Secret, Consecration and Conversion of Russia.<ref>[http://www.crc-internet.org/CCR/2009/Apocalyptic-Times.php Apocalyptic Times] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506000851/http://www.crc-internet.org/CCR/2009/Apocalyptic-Times.php |date=6 May 2009 }} at Catholic Counter-Reformation, Abbe Georges de Nantes' website.

However, by letters of 29 August 1989 and 3 July 1990, she stated that the consecration had been completed; indeed in the 1990 letter in response to a question by the [[Robert J. Fox|Rev. Father Robert J. Fox]], she confirmed:

<blockquote>
I come to answer your question, "If the consecration made by Pope John Paul II on 25 March 1984 in union with all the bishops of the world, accomplished the conditions for the consecration of Russia according to the request of Our Lady in Tui, Spain on 13 June 1929?" Yes, it was accomplished, and since then I have said that it was made.

And I say that no other person responds for me, it is I who receive and open all letters and respond to them.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/Fatima1984.htm Fátima – 1984 Consecration] EWTN Expert Answers, accessed 9 July 2010</ref>
</blockquote>

In the meantime, the conception of [[Theotokos Derzhavnaya]], Orthodox Christian venerated icon, points out that Virgin Mary is considered actual [[Tsarina]] of Russia by the religious appeal of [[Nicholas II]]; thus "Consecration of Russia" may refer to return of Russian [[monarchy]]. The icon was brought to Fátima in 2003 and 2014, together with another significant icon, the [[Theotokos of Port Arthur]].<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://gazetaslovo.com/новости/португалия/item/portugaliya-pravoslavnye-svyatyni-posetili-fatimu.html Orthodox Shrines Visit Fátima] (in Russian: [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fgazetaslovo.com%2F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%2F%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2Fitem%2Fportugaliya-pravoslavnye-svyatyni-posetili-fatimu.html&edit-text=&act=url English translation here]).</ref>

====Third Secret====
[[File:PIC MAD Madalena NS.jpg|thumb|Statue of Our Lady of Fátima in the Church of Santa María Madalena, Madalena, the [[Azores]], 2007. The devotion is especially popular among Catholics in [[Lusophone]] countries and the Portuguese diaspora.]]

The third secret, a vision of the death of the Pope and other religious figures, was transcribed by the [[Bishop of Leiria]] and reads:

:"After the two parts which I have already explained, at the left of Our Lady and a little above, we saw an Angel with a flaming sword in his left hand; flashing, it gave out flames that looked as though they would set the world on fire; but they died out in contact with the splendour that Our Lady radiated towards him from her right hand: pointing to the earth with his right hand, the Angel cried out in a loud voice: 'Penance, Penance, Penance!' And we saw in an immense light that is God: 'something similar to how people appear in a mirror when they pass in front of it' a Bishop dressed in White 'we had the impression that it was the Holy Father'. Other Bishops, Priests, Religious men and women going up a steep mountain, at the top of which there was a big Cross of rough-hewn trunks as of a cork-tree with the bark; before reaching there the Holy Father passed through a big city half in ruins and half trembling with halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed for the souls of the corpses he met on his way; having reached the top of the mountain, on his knees at the foot of the big Cross he was killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him, and in the same way there died one after another the other Bishops, Priests, Religious men and women, and various lay people of different ranks and positions. Beneath the two arms of the Cross there were two Angels each with a crystal [[aspersorium]] in his hand, in which they gathered up the blood of the Martyrs and with it sprinkled the souls that were making their way to God."<ref>The Message of Fátima (2000), The [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]</ref>

=====Controversy around the Third Secret=====
{{main|Three Secrets of Fátima#Third Secret controversy|l1=Third Secret of Fátima controversy}}

Lúcia declared that the Third Secret could be released to the public after 1960. Some sources, including Canon Barthas and [[Cardinal Ottaviani]], said that Lúcia insisted to them it must be released by 1960, saying that, "by that time, it will be more clearly understood", and, "because the Blessed Virgin wishes it so."<ref>{{cite book |author=Kramer, Father Paul |title=The Devil's Final Battle |url=http://www.devilsfinalbattle.com/content2.htm |pages=29–30 |id=(Content available for free online) |access-date=7 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307113643/http://www.devilsfinalbattle.com/content2.htm |archive-date=7 March 2017 |url-status=dead |edition=1st }}</ref><ref name="Trinite470">{{cite book |author= Frere Michel de la Sainte Trinite |title=The Whole Truth About Fátima, Volume III |year=1990 |page=470 |location=Buffalo, New York, U.S.A.}}</ref> Instead, in 1960 the Vatican published an official press release stating that it was "most probable the Secret would remain, forever, under absolute seal."<ref>{{cite book |author=Frere Michel de la Sainte Trinite |title=The Whole Truth About Fátima, Volume III |year=1990 |pages=578–79 |location=Buffalo, New York}}</ref> This announcement triggered widespread speculation.

The [[Holy See|Vatican]] did not publish the Third Secret, a four-page, handwritten text, until 26 June 2000.

Such writers as Father Paul Kramer, Christopher Ferrara, Antonio Socci, and Marco Tosatti have suggested that this was not the full text of the secret<ref name="OfficialText">{{cite web| url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000626_message-fatima_en.html| title=The Message of Fátima| accessdate=30 October 2009| publisher=Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith}}</ref> and stating the Third Secret is not the full text.<ref name="KramerBook">{{cite book |author=Kramer, Father Paul |title=The Devil's Final Battle |publisher=Good Counsel Publications Inc. |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-9663046-5-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/devilsfinalbattl00kram |id=(Content available for free online --click book title) |edition=1st }}</ref><ref name="FerraraBook">{{cite book |last=Ferrara |first=Christopher |title=The Secret Still Hidden |publisher=Good Counsel Publications Inc. |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-9815357-0-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/secretstillhidde0000ferr |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref name="SocciBook">{{cite book |title=Il Quarto Segreto di Fátima ("The Fourth Secret of Fátima" – |last=Socci |first=Antonio |year=2006 |location=Italy|language=it}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Il Segreto Non Svelato ("The Unrevealed Secret" – Italian only) |last=Tosatti |first=Marco |year=2002 |isbn=978-88-384-4552-1}}</ref> They alleged that Cardinals [[Tarcisio Bertone|Bertone]], [[Pope Benedict XVI|Ratzinger]] and [[Angelo Sodano|Sodano]] concealed the existence of another one-page document, containing information about the Apocalypse and a great apostasy.<ref name="KramerBook"/><ref name="FerraraBook"/><ref name="SocciBook"/>

The Vatican has maintained its position that the full text of the Third Secret was published. According to a December 2001 Vatican [[press release]] (published in ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]''), Lúcia told then-Archbishop Bertone in an interview that the secret had been completely revealed when published.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Holy See Press Office | language=it |title=In Contro di S.E.

==Fátima prayers and reparations==
{{see also|Fátima prayers}}
{{Acts of Reparation}}
Many [[Roman Catholic]]s recite prayers based on Our Lady of Fátima. Lúcia later said that, in 1916, she and her cousins had several visions of an angel calling himself the "Angel of Portugal" and the "Angel of Peace," who taught them to [[prostration|bow with their heads to the ground]]<ref>[[Sujud|''Sajdah'' in Islam]]</ref> and to say "My God, I believe, I adore, I hope, and I love you. I ask pardon for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not hope and do not love you." Lúcia later set this prayer to music and a recording exists of her singing it.<ref>EWTN Special, [http://www.thecalltofatima.com/ Calls of the Fátima Message, 2009.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514061336/http://www.thecalltofatima.com/ |date=14 May 2009 }}</ref> It was also said that sometime later, the angel returned and taught them a [[eucharist]]ic devotion now known as the [[Angel Prayer]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Angel of Fatima and Reparation at Holy Mass |first=Father Michael |last=Rodriguez |url=http://www.fatimacrusader.com/cr116/CR116.pdf |journal=The Fatijma Crusader |date=Autumn 2016 |issue=116 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title=Fatima and the Scapular| journal=Salve Maria Regina| url=http://www.salvemariaregina.info/SalveMariaRegina/SMR-104.html| volume=40| issue=104|year=2000}}</ref>

Lúcia said that the Lady emphasized [[Acts of Reparation]] and prayers to console Jesus for the sins of the world. Lúcia said that Mary's words were, "When you make some sacrifice, say 'O Jesus, it is for your love, for the conversion of sinners, and in reparation for sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.'" At the apparition of 13 July 1917, Lucia said Mary told the children that sinners could be saved from damnation by devotion to the Immaculate Heart, but also by making "sacrifices". They heard her repeat the idea of sacrifices several times. Her vision of hell prompted them to ever more stringent [[Mortification in Roman Catholic teaching|self-mortifications]] to save souls. Among many other practices, Lúcia wrote that she and her cousins wore tight cords around their waists, flogged themselves with stinging nettles, gave their lunches to beggars, and abstained from drinking water on hot days. Francisco and Jacinta became extremely devoted to this practice.<ref>The Congregation for the Causes of Saints, in the report that confirmed Jacinta as [[Beatification|beatified]], observed that she seemed to have "an insatiable hunger for immolation." [http://www.scborromeo.org/saints/jacinta.htm Congregation for the Causes of Saints Decree regarding the Canonization of the Servant of God Jacinta Marto]. 13 May 1989.</ref> Lúcia wrote that Mary said God was pleased with their sacrifices and bodily penances.<ref>Lúcia Santos, ''Fátima in Lucia's Own Words'', [http://www.piercedhearts.org/hearts_jesus_mary/apparitions/fatima/MemoriasI_en.pdf Full text online at piercedhearts.org], translation by the Dominican Nuns of the Perpetual Rosary, p. 93.</ref>

At the first apparition, Lúcia wrote, the children were so moved by the radiance that they involuntarily said "Most Holy Trinity, I adore you! My God, my God, I love you in the Most Blessed Sacrament."<ref>William Thomas Walsh, ''Our Lady of Fátima'', p. 52.</ref> Lúcia also said that she heard Mary ask for the following words to be added to the Rosary after the [[Gloria Patri]] prayer: "O my Jesus, pardon us, save us from the fires of hell. Lead all souls to heaven, especially those in most need."<ref>Walsh, p. 220.</ref>

According to Vatican teaching on the tradition of Marian visitations, references to the "conversion of sinners" do not necessarily mean [[religious conversion]] to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Pope Leo XIII, in his encyclical on the "Unity of the Church, Satis Cognitum", said that would mean the "conversion of heretics or apostates who are 'outside the church and alien to the Christian Faith.' Rather, "conversion of sinners" refers to general repentance and an attempt to amend one's life according to the teachings of Jesus for those true Catholics who are fallen into sins. Lúcia wrote that she and her cousins defined "sinners" not as non-Catholics but as those who had fallen away from the church or, more specifically, willfully indulged in sinful activity, particularly "sins of the flesh"<ref>Walsh, p. 90.</ref> and "acts of injustice and a lack of charity towards the poor, widows and orphans, the ignorant and the helpless," which she said were even worse than sins of impurity.<ref>From an undated letter written by Lúcia and quoted in ''Fátima, caminho da paz'' (Fátima, the Path to Peace) by A. M. Martins (Braga, 1983), pp. 88–89.

==Popes and Fátima==
[[File:Pius XII with stole.png|thumb|170px|[[Pope Pius XII]] consecrated humanity to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin in 1942. The consecration was renewed by [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] at the end of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1965.]]
The cultus of the Immaculate Heart is the central message of Fátima. Ecclesiastical approbation does not imply that the Church provides an infallible guarantee on the supernatural nature of the event. But, [[Karl Rahner]] and other theologians have said that popes, by authoritatively fostering the Marian veneration in places such as [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]] and [[Lourdes]], motivate the faithful into an acceptance of divine faith.<ref>Karl Rahner, ''Visionen und Prophezeiungen,'' München 1960</ref>

In October 1930 Bishop da Silva declared that the apparitions at Fátima were "worthy of belief," and approved public devotion to the Blessed Virgin under the title Our Lady of Fátima. The Vatican granted indulgences and permitted special Liturgies of the Mass to be celebrated in Fátima.<ref name="Koster">H M Köster Fátima, in Bäumer, ''Marienlexikon,'' II, 448 1940</ref>

In 1939, [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], who was consecrated as a bishop on 13 May 1917 — the day of the first apparition — was elected to the papacy as Pius XII. He is considered to have become "the Pope of Fátima."<ref name=Koster/> In 1940 after World War II had started, Sister Lúcia asked Pope Pius XII to consecrate the world and Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. She repeated this request later that year on 2 December 1940, stating that in the year 1929, the Blessed Lady requested in another apparition that Russia be consecrated to her Immaculate Heart. Mary was said to promise the conversion of Russia from its errors.<ref name="ReferenceA">Auguste Meessen, "Apparitions and Miracles of the Sun," International Forum in Porto ''Science, Religion and Conscience,'' 23–25 October 2003 {{ISSN|1645-6564}}</ref>

On 13 May 1942, the 25th anniversary of the first apparition and the silver jubilee of the episcopal consecration of Pope Pius XII, the Vatican published the "Message and Secret of Fátima." On 31 October 1942, [[Pope Pius XII]], in a radio address to the people of Portugal, discussed the apparitions of Fátima and consecrated the human race to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin, with specific mention of Russia. (See below)<ref>AAS, 1942, 313</ref> On 8 December 1942, the Pontiff officially and solemnly declared this consecration in a ceremony in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. This consecration was made in the context of the reported messages from Jesus and the Virgin Mary received by Blessed [[Alexandrina of Balazar]], and communicated to her spiritual director, Father Mariano Pinho.

On 13 May 1946, Cardinal Masalla, the personal delegate of Pius XII, crowned in his name Our Lady of Fátima, as the Pope issued a second message about Fátima:
* "The faithful virgin never disappointed the trust put on her. She will transform into a fountain of graces, physical and spiritual graces, over all of Portugal, and from there, breaking all frontiers, over the whole Church and the entire world".<ref>AAS 1946 246.</ref>

On 1 May 1948, in ''[[Auspicia quaedam]]'', Pope Pius XII requested the consecration to the Immaculate Heart of every Catholic family, parish and diocese.
* "It is our wish, consequently, that wherever the opportunity suggests itself, this consecration be made in the various dioceses as well as in each of the parishes and families."<ref>''Auspicia quaedam'', 21</ref><ref>AAS 148, 171</ref>

On 18 May 1950, the Pope again sent a message to the people of Portugal regarding Fátima: "May Portugal never forget the heavenly message of Fátima, which, before anybody else she was blessed to hear. To keep Fátima in your heart and to translate Fátima into deeds, is the best guarantee for ever more graces".<ref>AAS 1951, 780</ref> In numerous additional messages, and in his encyclicals ''[[Fulgens corona]]'' (1953), and ''[[Ad Caeli Reginam]]'' (1954), Pius XII encouraged the veneration of the Virgin in Fátima.

At the end of the [[Second Vatican Council]], [[Pope Paul VI]] renewed the consecration of Pius XII to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. In an unusual gesture, he announced his own pilgrimage to the sanctuary on the fiftieth anniversary of the first apparition. On 13 May 1967, he prayed at the shrine together with Sister Lúcia.

[[File:Coroa de Nossa Senhora de Fátima (12 de Maio de 2017).png|thumb|left|250px|One of the bullets that struck Pope John Paul II in his [[Attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II|1981 assassination attempt]] was later encased in the crown of the image of Our Lady of Fatima, in the [[Sanctuary of Fátima]].]]
In the final and historic consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Pope John Paul II on 25 March 1984 consecrated Russia and the world in a public ceremony at St. Peter's in Rome; the consecration was in the form of a 'whole-world consecration' carried out in union with the Catholic bishops throughout the world. Cardinal Bertone said to the press many times that the message of Fátima was finished.<ref>Mark Miravalle, 1993, ''Introduction to Mary'', p. 171.</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]] credited Our Lady of Fátima with saving his life following an assassination attempt on 13 May 1981, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima.<ref name="OfficialText"/> Then on 12 May 1987, he expressed his gratitude to the Virgin Mary for saving his life. The following day, he renewed the consecration of Pius XII to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

On 12–13 May 2010, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] visited the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima]] and strongly stated his acceptance of the supernatural origin of the Fátima apparitions. On the first day, the Pope arrived at the Chapel of Apparitions to pray; he gave a [[Golden Rose]] to Our Lady of Fátima "as a homage of gratitude from the Pope for the marvels that the Almighty has worked through you in the hearts of so many who come as pilgrims to this your maternal home". The Pope also recalled the "invisible hand" that saved John Paul II. He said in a prayer to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] that "it is a profound consolation to know that you are crowned not only with the silver and gold of our joys and hopes, but also with the 'bullet' of our anxieties and sufferings."<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-29242?l=english ZENIT – Fátima Shrine receives Golden Rose]</ref>

On the second day, Pope Benedict spoke to more than 500,000 pilgrims; he referred to the Fátima prophecy about the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and related it to the final "glory of the Most Holy Trinity."<ref>[http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=36550&wf=rsscol Catholic Online (www.catholic.org) – Our Lady of Fátima: Pope Benedict's Homily.

In March 2017 the Holy See announced that Pope Francis would [[canonize]] two of the visionaries, [[Francisco and Jacinta Marto]], on 13 May at a Mass in Fátima during a two-day visit. The decision followed papal confirmation of a miracle attributed to the intercession of the two visionaries.<ref name="Crux">{{Cite news |url=https://cruxnow.com/uncategorized/2017/03/23/pope-francis-proclaim-fatima-visionaries-saints-portugal-trip/ |title=Pope Francis to proclaim Fatima visionaries saints during Portugal trip |last=Staff |date=23 March 2017 |work=Crux |access-date=23 March 2017}}Announcement of forthcoming canonization of two Fatima visionaries</ref>

* The statue carved by [[:pt:José Ferreira Thedim|José Ferreira Thedim]], now enshrined within the Chapel of Apparitions, was [[Canonical coronation|canonically crowned]] on 13 May 1946 by [[Pope Pius XII]].

*The ''National Pilgrim Image of Our Lady of Fatima - Philippines,'' also known as the ''EDSA Image,'' is a gift to the Philippines from the Sanctuary of Fatima in Portugal. It was blessed by Pope Paul VI in 1967 during the 50th Anniversary of the Apparitions. It was crowned as the ''National Pilgrim Image'' in 1984 by the late Jaime Cardinal Sin and became the main Fatima image during the peaceful EDSA People Power Revolution of 1986. The image has been taken around the country  in different Churches and Schools. The image was Episcopally Crowned by the late Bishop Jose Oliveros of Malolos in celebration of the Centennial of the Apparitions, with the crown and rosary as gifts from the Sanctuary of  Fatima.
