Though Abubakar Shekau eventually became the preeminent commander of the movement, he never really controlled all Boko Haram groups. Instead the factions were loosely allied, but also occasionally clashed with each other.{{sfnp|TRADOC G-2|2015|pp=4, 19}}{{sfn|ICG|2014|pp=ii, 22, 26, 27}} This situation changed in 2015, when Shekau pledged allegiance to ISIL.<ref name="Province vs Shekau"/><ref name="Boko Haram joins ISIL"/> The leadership of ISIL eventually decided to replace Shekau as local commander with Abu Mus'ab al-Barnawi, whereupon the movement split completely.

Boko Haram's initial [[2009 Boko Haram uprising|uprising]] failed, and its leader [[Mohammed Yusuf (Boko Haram)|Mohammed Yusuf]] was killed by the Nigerian government. The movement consequently fractured into autonomous groups and started an insurgency, though rebel commander [[Abubakar Shekau]] managed to achieve a kind of primacy among the insurgents. Though challenged by internal rivals, such as Abu Usmatul al-Ansari's [[Salafist]] conservative faction and the [[Ansaru]] faction, Shekau became the insurgency's ''de facto'' leader and mostly kept the different Boko Haram factions from fighting each other, instead focusing on overthrowing the Nigerian government. Supported by other jihadist organizations including [[al-Qaeda]] and [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], Shekau's tactics were marked by extreme brutality and explicit targeting of [[civilian]]s.

After years of fighting, the insurgents became increasingly aggressive, and started to seize large areas in northeastern Nigeria. The violence escalated dramatically in 2014, with 10,849 deaths, while Boko Haram drastically expanded its territories.<ref name="NST">{{cite web|title=Nigeria Security Tracker|url=http://www.cfr.org/nigeria/nigeria-security-tracker/p29483|website=Council on Foreign Relations|author=John Campbell|access-date=9 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110011423/http://www.cfr.org/nigeria/nigeria-security-tracker/p29483|archive-date=10 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Boko Haram's four-year reign of terror|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/boko-haram-nigeria-schoolgirls-kidnapping-killed-graphic|access-date=2 June 2014|publisher=Channel 4 News|date=8 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606205214/http://www.channel4.com/news/boko-haram-nigeria-schoolgirls-kidnapping-killed-graphic|archive-date=6 June 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/boko-harams-bloodiest-year-yet-over-9000-killed-1-5-million-displaced-800-schools-destroyed-in-2014-131864/|title=Boko Haram's Bloodiest Year Yet: Over 9,000 Killed, 1.5 Million Displaced, 800 Schools Destroyed in 2014|work=Christian Post|access-date=10 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108104356/http://www.christianpost.com/news/boko-harams-bloodiest-year-yet-over-9000-killed-1-5-million-displaced-800-schools-destroyed-in-2014-131864/|archive-date=8 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/05/boko-haram-key-military-base-nigeria-chad-border|title=Thousands flee as Boko Haram seizes military base on Nigeria border|author=Monica Mark|newspaper=the Guardian|access-date=10 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111004908/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/05/boko-haram-key-military-base-nigeria-chad-border|archive-date=11 January 2015|url-status=live|date=6 January 2015}}</ref> At the same time, the insurgency spread to neighboring [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], and [[Niger]], thus becoming a major regional conflict. Meanwhile, Shekau attempted to improve his international standing among Jihadists by tacitly aligning with the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) in March 2015, with Boko Haram becoming the "Islamic State's West Africa Province" (ISWAP).

The insurgents were driven back during the [[2015 West African offensive]] by a Nigeria-led coalition of African and Western states, forcing the Islamists to retreat into [[Sambisa Forest]] and bases at [[Lake Chad]]. Discontent about various issues consequently grew among Boko Haram. Dissidents among the movement allied themselves with ISIL's central command and challenged Shekau's leadership, resulting in a violent split of the insurgents. Since then, Shekau and his group are generally referred to as "Boko Haram", whereas the dissidents continued to operate as ISWAP under [[Abu Musab al-Barnawi]]. The two factions consequently fought against each other while waging insurgencies against the local governments. After a period of reversals, Boko Haram and ISWAP launched new offensives in 2018 and 2019, again growing in strength.

When Boko Haram's insurgency was at its peak in the mid-2010s, it was called the world's deadliest [[terrorist]] group, in terms of the number of people it killed.<ref name = BBCDefeated/><ref name="ITI">{{cite news|last1=Pisa|first1=Katie|last2=Hume|first2=Tim|title=Boko Haram overtakes ISIS as world's deadliest terror group, report says|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/17/world/global-terror-report/|access-date=23 March 2016|publisher=CNN|date=19 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143919/http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/17/world/global-terror-report/|archive-date=6 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="IEP">{{cite web|title=Global Terrorism Index 2015|url=http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2015.pdf|publisher=Institute for Economics and Peace|access-date=23 March 2016|page=41|date=November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411115536/http://economicsandpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Global-Terrorism-Index-2015.pdf|archive-date=11 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Background==
{{Jihadism sidebar}}
===Nigerian statehood===
Nigeria was amalgamated both the Northern and Southern protectorate in 1914, only about a decade after the defeat of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] and other Islamic states by the British which were to constitute much of [[Northern Nigeria]]. Sir Frederick Lugard assumed office as governor of both protectorates in 1912. The aftermath of the [[First World War]] saw Germany lose its colonies, one of which was [[Cameroon]], to French, Belgian and British mandates. Cameroon was divided in [[French Cameroon|French]] and [[British Cameroon|British parts]], the latter of which was further subdivided into [[Southern Cameroons|southern]] and [[Northern Cameroons|northern]] parts. Following a [[plebiscite]] in 1961, the [[Southern Cameroons]] elected to rejoin French Cameroon, while the [[Northern Cameroons]] opted to join Nigeria, a move which added to Nigeria's already large Northern Muslim population.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Meredith|first1=Martin|author-link=Martin Meredith|title=The State of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence|publisher=The Free Press|page=197|chapter=11. A House Divided|title-link=The State of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence}}</ref> The territory made up much of what is now Northeastern Nigeria, and a large part of the areas affected by the insurgency.

===Early religious conflict in Nigeria===
{{main|Religious violence in Nigeria}}
Religious conflict in Nigeria dates [[Kano riot of 1953|as far back as 1953]]. The [[1966 anti-Igbo pogrom|Igbo massacre of 1966]] in the North that followed the [[Nigerian Counter-Coup of 1966|counter-coup of the same year]] had as a dual cause the [[1966 Nigerian coup d'etat|Igbo officers' coup]] and pre-existing (sectarian) tensions between the Igbos and the local Muslims. This was a major factor in the [[Biafran secession]] and the [[Nigerian civil war|resulting civil war]].

===Maitatsine===
{{main|Maitatsine|Yan Tatsine}}
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a major Islamic uprising led by [[Maitatsine]] (Mohammed Marwa) and his followers, [[Yan Tatsine]] that led to several thousand deaths. After Maitatsine's death in 1980, the movement continued some five years more.

In the same decade the erstwhile military ruler of Nigeria, General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] enrolled Nigeria in the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]. This was a move which aggravated religious tensions in the country, particularly among the Christian community.<ref name= AP>Holman, Michael (24 February 1986) "Nigeria, Politics; Religious Differences Intensify", ''Financial Times'',</ref> In response, some in the Muslim community pointed out that [[Member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation#Member states|certain other African member states]] have smaller proportions of Muslims, as well as Nigeria's diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See]].

===Establishment of Sharia===

{{See also|Sharia in Nigeria}}
Since the return of democracy to [[Nigeria]] in 1999, [[Sharia]] has been instituted as a main body of civil and criminal law in 9 Muslim-majority and in some parts of 3 Muslim-plurality states, when then-[[Zamfara State]] governor [[Ahmad Rufai Sani]]<ref name=BBC_sharia/> began the push for the institution of Sharia at the state level of government. This was followed by controversy as to the would-be legal status of the non-Muslims in the Sharia system. A spate of Muslim-Christian riots soon emerged.

In the primarily Islamic northern states of Nigeria, a variety of Muslim groups and populations exist, who favour the nationwide introduction of [[Sharia|Sharia Law]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unilorin.edu.ng/courseware/religion/RIS%20128.pdf | title=Course Lecture: Muslim Groups in Nigeria | work=Unilorin | access-date=7 June 2014 | author=Olawale, Abdul-Gafar | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714170237/https://www.unilorin.edu.ng/courseware/religion/RIS%20128.pdf | archive-date=14 July 2014 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The demands of these populations have been at least partially upheld by the Nigerian Federal Government in 12 states, firstly in Zamfara State in 1999.

'''15 June 2011''' also marked the start of a Federal Government sanctioned military effort to counter the growing threat of Boko Haram's insurgency. With 21 Armoured Brigade (21 Bde) of the Nigerian Army as its nucleus, Joint Task Force Operation Restore Order (JTF ORO 1) marked the start of the Army's lengthy counter-insurgency (COIN) campaign against Boko Haram.

As Boko Haram's power waned, Shekau's leadership was increasingly criticised among Boko Haram and ISIL's central command. These elements repeatedly attempted to convince Shekau to change his tactics or his extreme ideas (such as considering everyone an apostate who has not openly sided with him, including all Muslims). Shekau refused to budge, and openly disobeyed ISIL's "[[Caliph]]" [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] in regard to various matters. ISIL and parts of Boko Haram eventually came to the conclusion that this was no longer tolerable, whereupon Shekau was removed from his position as vali of ISIL's West Africa Province in '''August'''. [[Abu Musab al-Barnawi]], a son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf was appointed as his successor. This event resulted in an open split among the Nigerian insurgents. Shekau refused to accept his dismissal, rallied a large number of supporters and violently opposed Barnawi and ISIL's central command. In turn, Barnawi and those who were loyal to him declared Shekau's group ''[[Khawarij]]''.<ref name="Province vs Shekau" /> The two insurgent factions subsequently became fully separate organizations, with Shekau's followers re-adopting their old name "Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād" (outsiders refer to this faction as "Boko Haram"), whereas Barnawi's forces continued to operate as "Islamic State's West Africa Province" (ISWAP). The two groups are generally hostile and fight each other, though it is possible that they occasionally cooperate against their common enemies.<ref name="offemsive jan 2019">{{cite web |url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2019/01/thousands-flee-islamic-state-west-africa-offensive-in-northeast-nigeria.php |title=Thousands flee Islamic State West Africa offensive in northeast Nigeria |author1=Thomas Joscelyn |author2=Caleb Weiss |work=Long War Journal |date=17 January 2019 |access-date=24 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224231528/https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2019/01/thousands-flee-islamic-state-west-africa-offensive-in-northeast-nigeria.php |archive-date=24 February 2019 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Chris Kwaja, a Nigerian university lecturer and researcher, asserted in 2011 that "religious dimensions of the conflict have been misconstrued as the primary driver of violence when, in fact, disenfranchisement and inequality are the root causes". Nigeria, he pointed out, has laws giving regional political leaders the power to qualify people as 'indigenes' (original inhabitants) or not. It determines whether citizens can participate in politics, own land, obtain a job, or attend school. The system is abused widely to ensure political support and to exclude others. Muslims have been denied indigene-ship certificates disproportionately often.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nigeria's Pernicious Drivers of Ethno-Religious Conflict|publisher=Africa Center for Strategic Studies |author= Chris Kwaja|date=July 2011|issue=14|journal=Africa Security Brief|url=http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/africa-security-brief/asb-14.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303230823/http://www.ndu.edu/press/lib/pdf/Africa-Security-Brief/ASB-14.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2013}}</ref>

=== Rehabilition of insurgents ===
A major problem faced by local governments is the rehabilition of captured or surrendered militants, as these are generally suspected by officials and civilians to still hold connections to the rebels and pose a security risk. As result, ex-rebels are often ostracized, which in turn increases the risk of them rejoining the insurgency. Cameroon has planned to construct rehab centers for Boko Haram fighters which are supposed to teach them useful skills to get jobs, and to de-radicalise them. As of February 2019, however, no rehab centers for Boko Haram insurgents had been built yet in Cameroon due to lack of funding.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-yet-to-build-planned-rehab-centers-for-ex-boko-haram-fighters/4791847.html |title=Cameroon Yet to Build Planned Rehab Centers for ex-Boko Haram Fighters |author=Moki Edwin Kindzeka |work=Voice of America |date=18 February 2019 |access-date=27 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301013317/https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-yet-to-build-planned-rehab-centers-for-ex-boko-haram-fighters/4791847.html |archive-date=1 March 2019 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

==International context==

The insurgence can be seen in the context of other conflicts nearby, for example in the North of Mali. The Boko Harām leadership has international connections to [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]], [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]], the [[Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa]] (MUJAO), [[Mokhtar Belmokhtar]]'s factions, and other militant groups outside Nigeria.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27529566 "UN committee imposes sanctions on Nigeria's Boko Haram".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181222215935/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27529566 |date=22 December 2018 }} BBC News online, 23 May 2014.

Despite this, there were concerns that conflict could spread to Nigeria's neighbours, especially Cameroon, where it existed at a relatively low level until 2014, subsequently escalating considerably.
