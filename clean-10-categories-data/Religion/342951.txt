The concept of ''Drang nach Osten'' was a core element of [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]]. In ''Mein Kampf'' [[Adolf Hitler]] declares the idea to be an essential element of his reorganisation plans for Europe. On 7 February 1945 he stated: "It is eastwards, only and always eastwards, that the veins of [[Aryan race#Nazism and Neo-Nazism|our race]] must expand. It is the direction which nature herself has decreed for the expansion of the German peoples."<ref>''Hitler, a chronology of his life and time''. Milan Hauner, Macmillan, 1983, p. 197</ref>

==Origin of the term==
The first known use of {{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}} was by the Polish journalist [[Julian Klaczko]] in 1849, yet it is debatable whether he invented the term as he used it in form of a citation.<ref name="Lawaty_2003">Andreas Lawaty, Hubert Orłowski, {{lang|de|Deutsche und Polen: Geschichte, Kultur, Politik}}, 2003, p. 34, {{ISBN|3-406-49436-6}}, {{ISBN|978-3-406-49436-9}}</ref> Because the term is used almost exclusively in its German form in English, Polish, Russian, Czech and other languages, it has been concluded that the term is of German origin.<ref name="Lawaty_2003"/>

During the 19th and the early 20th century {{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}} has been associated with the medieval German {{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}}, the High Medieval migration period of ethnic Germans to Eastern Europe, inhabited by [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] and [[Baltic peoples|Balts]]. This movement caused legal, cultural, linguistic, religious and economic changes, that had a profound influence on the history of Eastern Europe between the Baltic Sea and the Carpathians.<ref name=sze>{{cite web |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332981514_Iure_Theutonico_German_settlers_and_legal_frameworks_for_immigration_to_Hungary_in_an_East-Central_European_perspective | title=Iure Theutonico ?

Massive population increase during the [[High Middle Ages]] left increasing numbers of commoners like peasants, craftsmen and artisans displaced, who were joined by nobility not entitled to land inheritance, stimulating the movement of settlers from territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], such as the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]] and [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] into the sparsely-populated East. These movements were supported by the Slavic kings and dukes and the Church.<ref name="Rösener1992">{{cite book|author=Werner Rösener|title=Agrarwirtschaft, Agrarverfassung und ländliche Gesellschaft im Mittelalter - p. 17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w86ZAAAAIAAJ|year=1992|publisher=Oldenbourg|isbn=978-3-486-55024-5}}</ref><ref name="Brzechczyn2009">{{cite book|author=Krzysztof Brzechczyn|title=Idealization XIII: Modeling in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4i5ZmD9CAgQC&pg=PA235|year=2009|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-420-2831-9|pages=235–}}</ref><ref name="FulbrookFulbrook2004">{{cite book|author1=Mary Fulbrook|author2=Professor of German History Mary Fulbrook|title=A Concise History of Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFBu8ujJWzkC&pg=PA13|date=19 February 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-54071-1|pages=13–}}</ref>

The future state of [[Prussia]], named for the conquered [[Old Prussians]], had its roots largely in these movements. As the Middle Ages came to a close, the [[Teutonic Knights]], who had been invited to northern Poland by [[Konrad of Masovia]], had assimilated and forcibly converted much of the southern Baltic coastlands.

After the [[Partitions of Poland]] by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], and the [[Russian Empire]] in the late 18th century, Prussia gained much of western Poland.  The Prussians, and later the Germans, engaged in a policy of [[Germanisation of Poles during Partitions|Germanization]] in Polish territories. Russia and [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] eventually conquered the lands taken by the [[Teutonic Knights]] in [[Estonia]] and [[Livonia]].

=={{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}} in German discourse==
The term became a centerpiece of the program of the German nationalist movement in 1891, with the founding of the {{lang|de|Alldeutschen Verbandes}}, in the words: {{lang|de|„Der alte Drang nach dem Osten soll wiederbelebt werden“}} ("The old {{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}} must be revived").<ref>Wippermann, 1981, p. 87</ref>
[[Nazi Germany]] employed the slogan in calling the [[Czechs]] a "Slav bulwark against the {{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}}" in the 1938 {{lang|de|[[Sudetenland|Sudeten crisis]]}}.<ref name="Osmańczyk_2003"/>

Despite {{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}} policies, population movement took place in the opposite direction also, as people from rural low-developed areas in the East were attracted by the prospering industrial areas of Western Germany. This phenomenon became known by the German term {{lang|de|[[Ostflucht]]}}, literally the ''flight from the East''.

==={{lang|de|Drang nach Westen}}===
A new {{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}} was called for by [[Romantic nationalism|German nationalists]] to oppose a Polish {{lang|de|Drang nach Westen}} ("thrust toward the West").<ref name="Best_2008"/><ref name="Hayes_1994" /> [[World War I]] had ended with the [[Treaty of Versailles]], by which most or parts of the [[German Empire|Imperial German]] provinces of [[Province of Posen|Posen]], [[West Prussia]], and [[Province of Upper Silesia|Upper Silesia]] were given to [[Second Polish Republic|reconstituted Poland]]; the West Prussian city of Danzig became the [[Free City of Danzig]].
The Polish paper {{lang|pl|[[Wprost]]}} used both {{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}} and {{lang|de|Drang nach Westen}} in August 2002 to title stories about German [[RWE]] company taking over Polish [[STOEN]] and Polish migration into eastern Germany, respectively.<ref>Paul Reuber, Anke Strüver, Günter Wolkersdorfer, {{lang|de|Politische Geographien Europas - Annäherungen an ein umstrittenes Konstrukt: Annäherungen an ein umstrittenes Konstrukt}}, 2005, {{ISBN|3-8258-6523-1}}, {{ISBN|978-3-8258-6523-8}}</ref>

{{lang|de|Drang nach Westen}} is also the ironic title of a chapter in [[Eric Joseph Goldberg]]'s book ''Struggle for Empire'', used to point out the "missing" eastward ambitions of [[Louis the German]] who instead expanded his kingdom to the West.<ref>Eric Joseph Goldberg, ''Struggle for Empire: Kingship and Conflict Under Louis the German, 817–876'', pp. 233''ff'', 2006, {{ISBN|0-8014-3890-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8014-3890-5}}</ref>

With the development of [[romantic nationalism]] in the 19th century, Polish and Russian intellectuals began referring to the German {{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}} as {{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}}. The [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] attempted to expand their power eastward; Germany by gaining influence in the declining [[Ottoman Empire]] (the [[Eastern Question]]) and Austria-Hungary through the acquisition of territory in the [[Balkans]] (such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]).

==Lebensraum concept of Nazi Germany==
{{main|Lebensraum|Generalplan Ost|Germanization|Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany}}

[[Adolf Hitler]], dictator of [[Nazi Germany]] from 1933–1945, called for a {{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}} to acquire territory for German colonists at the expense of central and eastern European nations ({{lang|de|[[Lebensraum]]}}). The term by then had gained enough currency to appear in foreign newspapers without explanation.<ref>Carlson, p. 233.</ref> His eastern campaigns during [[World War II]] were initially successful with the conquests of Poland, the Baltic countries, Belarus, Ukraine and much of [[European Russia]] by the {{lang|de|[[Wehrmacht]]}}; {{lang|de|[[Generalplan Ost]]}} was designed to eliminate the native Slavic peoples from these lands and replace them with Germans.<ref>"[https://archive.is/20120527021449/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm Hitler's plans for Eastern Europe]"</ref> The {{lang|de|[[Wehrbauer]]}}, or soldier-peasants, would settle in [[Generalplan Ost#Phases of the plan and its implementation|a fortified line]] to prevent civilization arising beyond and threatening Germany.<ref>[[Robert Cecil (British diplomat)|Robert Cecil]], ''The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology'' p. 190 {{ISBN|0-396-06577-5}}</ref>

This was greatly hindered by the lack of German people who actually desired to settle in the east, let alone act as [[Teutonic Knights]] there.<ref>Robert Cecil, ''The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology'' p. 191 {{ISBN|0-396-06577-5}}</ref> Settlements actually established during the war did not receive colonists from the {{lang|de|[[Altreich (pre-1938 Nazi Germany)|Altreich]]}}, but in the main part [[Nazi–Soviet population transfers|East European Germans resettled from Soviet "spheres of interest"]] according to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]],<ref>[[Lynn H. Nicholas]], ''Cruel World: The Children of Europe in the Nazi Web'' pp. 206–9, {{ISBN|0-679-77663-X}}</ref> and such Poles as deemed [[Germanization|Germanizable]] by Nazis.<ref>[[Richard Overy]], ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p. 543 {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}</ref> However, the [[Soviet Union]] began to reverse the German conquests by 1943, and Nazi Germany was defeated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1945.

==Expulsion of Germans from the East after World War II==
{{main|Former eastern territories of Germany|Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–1950)}}
Most of the demographic and cultural outcome of the {{lang|de|[[Ostsiedlung]]}} was terminated after [[World War II]]. The [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]] east of the [[Oder-Neisse line|{{lang|de|Oder-Neisse|nocat=y}} line]] in 1945–48 on the basis of decisions of the [[Potsdam Conference]] were later justified by their beneficiaries as a rollback of the {{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}}. "[[Historical Eastern Germany]]"— historically the land of the Baltic people called [[Old Prussians]] who had been colonised and assimilated by German {{lang|de|Drang Nach Osten}}—was split between [[Poland]], [[Russia]], and [[Lithuania]] (a Baltic country) and repopulated with settlers of the respective ethnicities. The {{lang|de|Oder-Neisse}} line has been accepted to be the eastern German boundary by all post-war German states ([[German Democratic Republic|East]] and [[West Germany]], as well as reunited [[Germany]])<ref>[[Oder%E2%80%93Neisse line#Schengen Agreement]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}, reneging on all plans to (re-)expand into or (re-)settle territories beyond this line. The Old Prussians were conquered by the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century, and gradually assimilated over the following centuries; the [[Old Prussian language]] was extinct by the 17th or early 18th century. [[Henry Cord Meyer]], in his book "{{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}}: Fortunes of a Slogan-Concept in German–Slavic Relations, 1849–1990" claims that the slogan {{lang|de|Drang nach Osten}}<ref name="Meyer_1996">[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=4569892242187 Hnet Review of] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627001651/http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=4569892242187 |date=27 June 2007 }} Henry Cord Meyer.
