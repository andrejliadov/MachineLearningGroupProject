{{For|the descriptive term in the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible and the New Testament|People of God}}
Throughout history, various groups of people have considered themselves to be '''chosen people''' by a [[deity]] for a purpose, such as to act as the deity's agent on earth.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In [[monotheistic]] faiths references to [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] are used in constructs such as "God's Chosen People". The phenomenon of a "chosen people" is particularly common in the Israelite tradition, where it originally referred to the Israelites—in fact Jews refer to this as a burden to spread the message of one God. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Some claims of chosenness are based on parallel claims of [[groups claiming affiliation with Israelites|Israelite]] ancestry, as is the case for the [[Christian Identity]] and [[Black Hebrew]] sects—both which claim themselves (and not Jews) to be the "true Israel". Others claim a "spiritual" chosenness, including most Christian denominations, who traditionally believe the church has replaced Israel as the [[People of God]].

[[Anthropologist]]s commonly regard claims of chosenness as a form of [[ethnocentrism]].<ref name="HavilandPrins2009">{{cite book|author1=William A. Haviland|author2=Harald E. L.

==Judaism==
{{Main|Jews as the chosen people}}
In Judaism, "chosenness" is the belief that the [[Jew]]s, via descent from the ancient [[Israelites]], are the chosen people, i.e., chosen to be in a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with [[God in Judaism|God]]. The idea of the Israelites being chosen by God is found most directly in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]]<ref>Clements, Ronald (1968). ''God's Chosen People: a Theological Interpretation of the Book of Deuteronomy''. In series, ''Religious Book Club'', 182. London: S.C.M. Press</ref> as the verb '[[wikt:בחר|bahar]]  ({{native name|he|בָּחַ֣ר}}), and is alluded to elsewhere in the [[Hebrew Bible]] using other terms such as "holy people".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9nN8AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 The Jews as a Chosen People: Tradition and Transformation, S. Leyla Gurkan]</ref> Much is written about these topics in [[rabbinic literature]]. The three largest Jewish denominations—[[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]]—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission—to be a [[light unto the nations]], and to exemplify the [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God as described in the Torah.

===Mormonism===
{{See also|Mormonism|Judaism and Mormonism|Islam and Mormonism}}
In [[Mormonism]], all [[Latter Day Saint]]s are viewed as [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]], or chosen, people because they have accepted the name of Jesus Christ through the [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] of baptism. In contrast to [[supersessionism]], Latter Day Saints do not dispute the "chosen" status of the Jewish people. Most practicing Mormons receive a [[patriarchal blessing]] that reveals their lineage in the House of Israel. This lineage may be blood related or through "adoption;" therefore, a child may not necessarily share the lineage of her parents (but will still be a member of the [[tribes of Israel]]). It is a widely held belief<ref>[[Daniel H. Ludlow]], [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1991/01/of-the-house-of-israel "Of the House of Israel"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', January 1991.</ref> that most members of the faith are in the [[tribe of Ephraim]] or the [[tribe of Manasseh]].

===Christian Identity===
{{Main|Christian Identity}}
Christian Identity is a belief which holds the view that only [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]], [[Celtic people|Celtic]], [[Nordic race|Nordic]], [[Aryan race|Aryan]] people and those of kindred blood are the descendants of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]] and hence the descendants of the ancient [[Israelites]].<ref name="Doctrine"/>

Independently practiced by individuals, [[Local church|independent congregations]], and some [[prison gang]]s, it is not an [[organized religion]], nor is it connected with specific [[Christian denomination]]s.<ref name="BehindBars">{{cite web|url= http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/bigotry-behind-bars-racist-groups-in-US-prisons.html|title= Bigotry Behind Bars: Racist Groups In U.S. Prisons|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150729081815/http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/bigotry-behind-bars-racist-groups-in-US-prisons.html|archive-date= 2015-07-29}}</ref> Its [[theology]] promotes a racial interpretation of Christianity.<ref>{{cite book|last= Eck|first= Diane|year= 2001|author-link= Diana L.

Christian Identity holds that all non-whites (people not of wholly European descent) will either be exterminated or enslaved in order to serve the [[White people|white race]] in the new [[Kingdom of God (Christianity)|Heavenly Kingdom]] on Earth under the reign of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]]. Its doctrine states that only "Adamic" (white) people can achieve salvation and paradise.<ref name="Barkun">''Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement'', Michael Barkun, 1997, pp 115-119.</ref>

==Rastafari==
{{Main| Rastafari}}
Based on Jewish biblical tradition and Ethiopian legend via [[Kebra Nagast]], Rastas believe that Israel's [[King Solomon]], together with Ethiopian [[Queen of Sheba]], conceived a child which began the [[Solomonic dynasty|Solomonic line]] of kings in Ethiopia, rendering the Ethiopian people as the true children of Israel, and thereby chosen. Reinforcement of this belief occurred when [[Beta Israel]], Ethiopia's ancient Israelite First Temple community, were rescued from Sudanese famine and brought to Israel during [[Operation Moses]] in 1985.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}{{dubious|Is that a fact?

==Nation of Islam==
{{main|Nation of Islam}}
The Nation of Islam teaches that black people constitute a nation and that through the institution of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] they were systematically denied knowledge of [[History of Africa|their history]], [[Languages of Africa|language]], [[Culture of Africa|culture]], and [[Traditional African religion|religion]] and, in effect, lost control of their lives. Founder [[Elijah Muhammad]] called for the establishment of a separate nation for black Americans and the adoption of a religion based on the worship of [[Allah]] and on the belief that blacks were his chosen people.
