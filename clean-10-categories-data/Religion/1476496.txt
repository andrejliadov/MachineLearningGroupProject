The '''Dīn-i-Ilāhī''' ({{lang-fa|دين إله}}, lit. "Religion of God"),<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9030480/Din-i-Ilahi Din-i Ilahi - Britannica Online Encyclopedia]</ref><ref name="MLR">{{Citation | last = Roy Choudhury | first =Makhan Lal | date =1997 | orig-year =First published 1941 | title =The Din-i-Ilahi, or, The religion of Akbar | edition =4th | location =New Delhi | publisher =Oriental Reprint | isbn = 978-81-215-0777-6}}</ref> known during its time as '''Tawḥīd-i-Ilāhī''' ("Divine Monotheism", lit: "Oneness of God") or '''Divine Faith''' was a [[syncretism|syncretic]] religion propounded by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar]] in 1582, intending to merge some of the elements of the religions of his empire, and thereby reconcile the differences that divided his subjects.<ref name="MLR" /> The elements were primarily drawn from [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Zoroastrianism]], but some others were also taken from [[Christianity]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]].

==Name==
The name ''Dīn-i Ilāhī'' literally translates to "God's Religion" or "Religion of God". According to the renowned historian [[Mubarak Ali]], ''Dīn-i Ilāhī'' is a name that was not used in Akbar's period. At the time, it was called '''''Tawhid-i-Ilāhī''''' ("Divine Monotheism"), as it is written by [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazl]], a court historian during the reign of Akbar.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Akbarnama of Abu'l-Fazl|author=Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|publisher=Low Price Publications|orig-year=1902–39|date=2010|isbn=81-7536-481-5|location=Delhi}}</ref> This name suggests a particularly [[monotheistic]] focus for Akbar's faith. The anonymous ''[[Dabestan-e Mazaheb]]'' uses the name ''Ilahíah'' to refer to the faith.<ref name="persian.packhum.org">[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Fauth%3D155%26work%3D001 THE DABISTÁN, OR SCHOOL OF MANNERS, Trans.

==History==
[[File:AbulFazlPresentingAkbarnama.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazl]], one of the disciples of Din-i-Ilahi, presenting ''[[Akbarnama]]'' to [[Akbar]], Mughal miniature]]

Akbar promoted [[religious tolerance|tolerance]] of other faiths and even encouraged debate on philosophical and religious issues. This led to the creation of the [[Ibadat Khana|''Ibādat Khāna'']] ("House of Worship") at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in 1575, which invited theologians, poets, scholars, and philosophers from all religious denominations, including Christians, Hindus, Jains, and Zoroastrians.

Since Akbar suffered from severe [[dyslexia]], rendering him totally unable to read or write, such dialogues in the House of Worship became his primary means of exploring questions of faith. Despite his aforementioned illiteracy, Akbar would eventually amass a library full of more than 24,000 volumes of texts in [[Hindi]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]]. The later [[Mughal Emperor]] and son of Akbar, [[Jahangir]], stated that his father was "always associated with the learned of every creed and religion." In a letter to [[King Philip II of Spain]], Akbar laments that so many people do not inquire into issues within their own religion, stating that most people will instead "follow the religion in which [they] were born and educated, thus excluding [themselves] from the possibility of ascertaining the truth, which the noblest aim of the human intellect."<ref name="huffingtonpost.in">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/finding-tolerance-in-akba_b_3031746|title=Finding Tolerance in Akbar, the Philosopher-King}}</ref>

The respect Akbar harbored for Christianity is exhibited on the [[Buland Darwaza]] (lit: "Door of Victory"), a massive gate in [[Fatehpur Sikri]]. Among passages from the [[Qur'an]] etched in the [[Naskh (script)|Naskh script]], Khwaja Hussain Chishti, a Sufi of the [[Chishti Order]], transcribed the following forewarning of [[impermanence]]:

{{quote|[[Christ|Isa]], son of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], said: This world is a bridge. Pass over it, but build no houses on it. He who hopes for an hour may hope for eternity. The world endures but an hour. Spend it in prayer, for the rest is unseen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agraindia.org.uk/fatehpur-sikri/monuments/buland-darwaza.html|title=Buland Darwaza India - Buland Darwaja Fatehpur Sikri - Buland Darwaza Sikri India|website=agraindia.org.uk}}</ref>}}

By the time Akbar established the Dīn-i Ilāhī, he had already repealed the ''[[jizya]]'' (tax on non-Muslims) over a decade earlier in 1568. A religious experience while he was hunting in 1578 further increased his interest in the religious traditions of his empire.<ref>Schimmel, Annemarie (2006) ''The Empire of the Great Mughals: History, Art and Culture'', Reaktion Books, {{ISBN|1-86189-251-9}}</ref> From the discussions held at the Ibādat Khāna, Akbar concluded that no single religion could claim the monopoly of truth. This revelation inspired him to create the Dīn-i Ilāhī in 1582. Various pious Muslims, among them the [[Qadi]] of [[Bengal Subah]] and Shaykh [[Ahmad Sirhindi]], responded by declaring it to be [[blasphemy]] to Islam.

===After Akbar===

Dīn-i Ilāhī appears to have survived Akbar according to the ''[[Dabestan-e Mazaheb|Dabestān-e Mazāheb]]'' of [[Mohsin Fani]]. However, the movement never numbered more than 18 adherents.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9030480/Din-i-Ilahi Din-i Ilahi - Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="persian.packhum.org"/>

In the 17th century, an attempt to re-establish the Dīn-i-Ilāhī was made by [[Shah Jahan]]'s eldest son, [[Dara Shikoh]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC&pg=PA194&dq=Dara+Shikoh&as_brr=0#PPA195,M1 Dara Shikoh] ''Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia'', by Josef W. Meri, Jere L Bacharach. Routledge, 2005. {{ISBN|0-415-96690-6}}. ''Page 195-196''.</ref> but any prospects of an official revival were halted by his brother, [[Aurangzeb]], who executed him<ref>"India was at a crossroads in the mid-seventeenth century; it had the potential of moving forward with Dara Shikoh, or of turning back to medievalism with Aurangzeb".{{cite book |title=The Mughal Throne : The Saga of India's Great Emperors |last=Eraly |first=Abraham |year=2004 |publisher=Phoenix |location=London |isbn=0-7538-1758-6 |page=336}}<br />"Poor Dara Shikoh!....thy generous heart and enlightened mind had reigned over this vast empire, and made it, perchance, the garden it deserves to be made".

Aurangzeb later compiled the [[Fatawa-e-Alamgiri]], reimposed the ''jizya'', and established Islamic [[Sharia]] law across the [[Indian Subcontinent]], spreading Islamic orthodoxy and extinguishing any chance of religious reform for generations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Roy|title=Mawlana Mawdudi and Political Islam: Authority and the Islamic State|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136950360}}</ref>

==Beliefs and practices==
Although the spirit and central principles of Dīn-i Ilāhī were adapted from [[Sufism]] (including ideas from the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusi]] Sufi mystic, [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn al-'Arabi]]), Akbar endeavored to create a synthesis of other beliefs and so his personal religion borrowed concepts and tenets from many other faiths. Aligned with [[Sufi]] practices, one's soul is encouraged to [[Tazkiah|purify itself]] through yearning of God. Sins included lust, sensuality, slander, and pride; virtues included piety, prudence, abstinence, and kindness. The following details illustrate the personal religious observances of Akbar:

{{quote|As an inquisitive inquirer endowed with the spirit of reason, he learnt the Hindu alchemy and medicine and cultivated their [[Yoga]] system; like his [[Central Asian]] ancestor, he believed in [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]]; and after his association with the Zoroastrian [[Mobad|mobed]], he believed that life might be lengthened by lightning fire or by the repetition of a thousand names of the Sun. Following the Buddhist custom, he used to [[Tonsure#Buddhism|shave the crown of his head]] thinking that the soul passed through the brain. He turned into a vegetarian later in life.<ref name="MLR" />}}

The visitation of [[Jesuit]] missionaries such as [[Rodolfo Acquaviva]] brought the virtue of [[celibacy]] into the House of Worship, where it consequently became a virtue of Akbar's faith that was not mandatory (as it is for the priests of [[Roman Catholicism]]) but respected. The faith also adopted the principle of [[ahimsa]], an ancient virtue of almost all [[Indian religions]], including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. The nonviolence extended from humans to animals, encouraging vegetarianism and prohibiting the slaughter of animals for any reason at all. The Dīn-i Ilāhī had no sacred scriptures and, similar to both Islam and [[Sikhi]], there was no priestly hierarchy.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ti8clvedTAC Children's Knowledge Bank], Dr. Sunita Gupta, 2004</ref>

Light was a focus of divine worship, with a light-fire ritual based on the [[yasna]] (the primary form of worship in [[Zoroastrianism]]) and an adoption of the hymn of the 1,000 Sanskrit names for the [[Surya|sun]]. Followers were referred to as ''chelah'' (meaning: “disciples”).

The major practices and beliefs of Dīn-i-Ilāhī were as follows:
#[[Tawhid|The unity of God]]
#Followers salute one-another with [[Takbir|''Allah-u-Akbar'']] or ''Jalla Jalalahu'' (meaning: "may His glory be glorified")
#[[vegetarianism|Absence of meat of all kinds]]
#One’s "[[Birthday|on-birth-by-anniversary]]" party was a must for every member
#[[Ahimsa]] (non-violence); followers were prohibited from dining with fishers, butchers, hunters, etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/0f9f9d9d8a153c8f8f42f14ed3a6323e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1819375 |title=A Note on "Din-i-Ilahi" |author=Ghaznavi, A Waheed |date=1 Oct 1988 |website=https://search.proquest.com/  |access-date=30 October 2020}}</ref>

===''Ṣulḥ-i-kul''===
It has been argued that the theory of Dīn-i Ilāhī being a new religion was a misconception which arose because of erroneous translations of [[Abu'l-Fazl]]'s work by later British historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Ali|2006|pp=163–164}}</ref> However, it is also accepted that the policy of ''sulh-i-kul'', which formed the essence of ''Dīn-i Ilāhī'', was adopted by Akbar as a part of general imperial administrative policy. ''Sulh-i-kul'' means "[[World peace|universal peace]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/804548/why-putting-less-mughal-history-in-school-textbooks-might-not-be-a-bad-idea|title=Why putting less Mughal history in school textbooks may be a good idea}}</ref><ref name="huffingtonpost.in"/> According to Abu'l-Fazl, the emperor was a [[Divine right of kings|universal agent of god]], and so his sovereignty was not bound to any single faith. The emperor is further prohibited from discriminating between the [[Dabestan-e_Mazaheb#Outline|different religions of the realm]] and if the ruler did discriminate, then they were not fit for the role as agent of god.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roy|first=Himanshu|title=Indian Political Thought themes and thinkers|publisher=Pearson|year=2020|isbn=978-93-325-8733-5|pages=;page=130}}</ref> Abu'l-Fazl saw the religious views of as a rational decision toward maintaining harmony between the various faiths of the empire.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roy|first=Himanshu|title=Indian Political Thought themes and thinkers|publisher=Pearson|year=2020|isbn=978-93-325-8733-5|pages=;page=131}}</ref>
