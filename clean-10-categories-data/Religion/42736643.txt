{{short description|Latin phrase from the Albigensian Crusade}}
{{italic title}}
"'''''Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius.'''''" is a phrase reportedly spoken by the commander of the [[Albigensian Crusade]], prior to the [[massacre at Béziers]] on 22 July 1209. A direct translation of the [[Latin]] phrase is "'''Kill them. For the Lord knows those that are His own.'''"  [[Papal legate]] and [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] abbot [[Arnaud Amalric]] was military commander of the Crusade in its initial phase and leader of this first major military action of the Crusade, the assault on [[Béziers]], and was reported to have uttered the order by [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]].

Less formal English translations have given rise to variants such as "'''Kill them all; let God sort them out.'''" Some modern sources give the quotation as {{Lang-la|Neca eos omnes. Deus suos agnoscet|label=none}}, evidently a translation from English back into Latin, and so omitting a biblical reference to [[2 Timothy 2:19]] evident in the original.<ref name="Gregory">{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Rocky L. |title=Just Baptize Them All and Let God Sort Them Out: Usurping the Authority of God |year=2014 |publisher=[[LifeWay Christian Resources|CrossBooks]] |page=xii |isbn=9781462735877 |oclc=874730661}}</ref>

==Background==
{{further|Massacre at Béziers}}
Amalric's own version of the siege, described in his letter to [[Pope Innocent III]] in August 1209, states:
<blockquote>
While discussions were still going on with the barons about the release of those in the city who were deemed to be Catholics, the servants and other persons of low rank and unarmed attacked the city without waiting for orders from their leaders. To our amazement, crying "to arms, to arms!", within the space of two or three hours they crossed the ditches and the walls and Béziers was taken. Our men spared no one, irrespective of rank, sex or age, and put to the sword almost 20,000 people. After this great slaughter the whole city was despoiled and burnt&nbsp;...<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sibly |first1=W. A. |last2=Sibly |first2=M.

About thirteen years later Caesarius of Heisterbach relates this story about the massacre, with the papal legate quoted using the words {{Lang-la|Caedite eos.

<blockquote>
When they discovered, from the admissions of some of them, that there were Catholics mingled with the heretics they said to the abbot "Sir, what shall we do, for we cannot distinguish between the faithful and the heretics." The abbot, like the others, was afraid that many, in fear of death, would pretend to be Catholics, and after their departure, would return to their heresy, and is said to have replied "Kill them all for the Lord knoweth them that are His" (2 Tim. ii. 19) and so countless number in that town were slain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/caesarius-heresies.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Caesarius of Heisterbach: Medieval Heresies: Waldensians, Albigensians, Intellectuals |publisher=[[Fordham University]] |accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

Caesarius did not state definitively that this sentence had been uttered, he wrote that Amalric "was reported to have said it" (''dixisse fertur'' in the original text).<ref>{{cite book |last=Meschini |first=Marco |title=L'eretica: Storia della crociata contro gli Albigesi |publisher=Laterza |year=2010 |page=116 |language=Italian |isbn=978-88-420-9306-0 |oclc=656501629}}</ref> Whilst there remains doubt that the abbot said these words there is little if any doubt that these words captured the spirit of the assault,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bloodlustonroots00jaco |url-access=registration |quote=Caesarius of Heisterbach amalric. |first=Russell |last=Jacoby |title=Bloodlust: On the Roots of Violence from Cain and Abel to the Present |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |page=29f |isbn=978-1-4391-0024-0 |oclc=787862175 |year=2011}}</ref> and that Arnaud and his crusaders planned to kill the inhabitants of any stronghold that offered resistance.<ref>[[William of Tudela]], cited in Zoé Oldenburg, ''Massacre at Montségur'', page 116</ref> The crusaders (which Arnaud referred to as ''nostri'', "our men")<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sibly |first1=W.A. |last2=Sibly |first2=M.D. |title=The Chronicle of William of Puylaurens: The Albigensian Crusade and Its Aftermath |date=2003 |publisher=The Boydell Press |location=Woodbridge, Suffolk, England, UK |pages=127–128 |isbn=9780851159256 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mIQTe2VaZQsC&pg=PA127}}</ref> rampaged and killed without restraint.<ref>{{cite book |last=Oldenbourg |first=Zoé |authorlink=Zoé Oldenbourg |title=Massacre at Montségur: A History of the Albigension Crusade |year=2000 |publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson|Phoenix Press]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/massacreatmontse00olde_0/page/109 109ff] |isbn=1-84212-428-5 |oclc=47720027 |url=https://archive.org/details/massacreatmontse00olde_0/page/109 }}</ref>

==Meaning==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2020}}
The [[Albigensian Crusade]] was intended to eliminate [[Catharism]], a religious movement denounced by the [[Catholic Church]] as [[heresy|heretical]]. [[Béziers]] was not a Cathar stronghold but, according to contemporary Catholic records, home to almost 20,000 baptised Catholics and just over 300 baptised Cathars. Presented with the difficulty of distinguishing Catholics from the Cathars, especially if individuals might misrepresent their own beliefs, the phrase indicated that [[God in Christianity|God]] would [[Particular judgment|judge]] those who were killed, and accordingly "sort" them into [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] or [[Hell]].

The phrase is generally recognised{{Who|date=May 2020}} as a partial quotation from the Vulgate version of [[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Timothy]] 2:19  ({{Lang-la|cognovit Dominus qui sunt eius|lit=Master knows them that are his}}). In the [[King James Version]], the English translation of the verse is: "Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His."

==In culture==
The phrase has been adopted by members of the [[United States Armed Forces|US military]] in various conflicts, such as the [[Vietnam War]],<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Doyle |editor1-first=Charles Doyle |editor2-last=Mieder |editor2-first=Wolfgang |editor3-last=Shapiro |editor3-first=Fred R. |title=The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs |year=2012 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=9780300136029 |oclc=759174383}}</ref> and is used as an unofficial slogan by certain units. In parts of the [[War on Terror]], the variant "Kill them all. Let [[God in Islam|Allah]] sort them out" has been used.<ref name=Gregory/>
