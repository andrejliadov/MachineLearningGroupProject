{{Anthropology of religion}}
{{Anthropology|social/cultural}}
'''Anthropology of religion''' is the study of religion in relation to other social [[institution]]s, and the comparison of [[religious belief]]s and [[Ritual#Religious rituals|practices]] across [[culture]]s.{{sfnm |1a1=Adams |1y=2017 |2a1=Eller |2y=2007 |2p=2}}

==History==
In the early 12th century [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] (973–1048), wrote detailed comparative studies on the anthropology of religions and cultures across the [[Mediterranean Basin]] (including the so-called  "[[Middle East]]") and the [[Indian subcontinent]].{{sfn|Walbridge| 1998}} He discussed the peoples, customs, and religions of the Indian subcontinent.

In the 19th century [[cultural anthropology]] was dominated by an interest in [[cultural evolution]]; most [[anthropologist]]s assumed a simple distinction between "primitive" and "modern" religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter.{{citation needed|date= April 2015}} In the 20th century most anthropologists rejected this approach.  Today the anthropology of religion reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as [[Karl Marx]] (1818-1883), [[Sigmund Freud's views on religion | Sigmund Freud]] (1856-1939), [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858-1917), and [[Max Weber]] (1864-1920).{{sfnm |1a1=Eller |1y=2007 |1p=22 |2a1=Weber |2y=2002}} Anthropologists of religion are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p= 4}}{{clarify|date= April 2015}}

In 1912 Émile Durkheim, building on the work of [[Ludwig Feuerbach | Feuerbach]], considered religion "a projection of the social values of society", "a means of making [[symbol]]ic statements about society", "a symbolic language that makes statements about the social order";{{sfnm |1a1=Durkheim |1y=1912 |2a1=Bowie |2y=1999 |2pp=15, 143}} in short, "religion is society worshiping itself".{{sfn|Nelson |1990}}<ref>Durkheim, p.266 in the 1963 edition</ref>{{incomplete short citation|date= November 2017}}

Anthropologists ''circa'' 1940 assumed that religion was in complete continuity with [[magical thinking]],{{efn|In 1944, [[Ernst Cassirer]] wrote: {{quote|It seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion. [note 35: See, for instance, RR Marett, Faith, Hope, and Charity in Primitive Religion, the Gifford Lectures (Macmillan, 1932), Lecture II, pp. 21 ff.] ... We have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion.{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp= 122–123}}}}}}{{sfn|Cassirer|2006|pp= 122–123}}{{Dubious |Problems with many claims |reason= Citation does not say anything about modern anthropology and is not a work on the issue |date= April 2015}}
and that it is a cultural product.{{efn|T. M. Manickam wrote: {{quote| Religious anthropology suggests that every religion is a product of the cultural evolution, more or less coherent, of one race or people; and this cultural product is further enriched by its interaction and cross-fertilization with other peoples and their cultures, in whose vicinity the former originated and evolved.{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p= 6}}}}}}{{sfn|Manickam|1977|p=6}} The complete continuity between [[magic and religion]] has been a postulate of modern anthropology at least since early 1930s.{{efn|[[Robert Ranulph Marett |R. R. Marett]] wrote: {{quote|In conclusion, a word must be said on a rather trite subject. Many leading anthropologists, including the author of ''The Golden Bough'', would wholly or in the main refuse the title of religion to these almost inarticulate ceremonies of very humble folk. I am afraid, however, that I cannot follow them. Nay, I would not leave out a whole continent from a survey of the religions of mankind in order to humour the most distinguished of my friends. Now clearly if these observances are not to be regarded as religious, like a wedding in church, so neither can they be classed as civil, like its drab equivalent at a registry office. They are mysteries, and are therefore at least generically akin to religion. Moreover, they are held in the highest public esteem as of infinite worth whether in themselves or for their effects. To label them, then, with the opprobrious name of magic as if they were on a par with the mummeries that enable certain knaves to batten on the nerves of fools is quite unscientific; for it mixes up two things which the student of human culture must keep rigidly apart, namely, a normal development of the social life and one of its morbid by-products. Hence for me they belong to religion, but of course to rudimentary religion—to an early phase of the same world-wide institution that we know by that name among ourselves. I am bound to postulate the strictest continuity between these stages of what I have here undertaken to interpret as a natural growth.{{sfn|Marett|1932}}}}}}{{sfnm |1a1= Cassirer |1y=2006 |1pp= 122–123 |2a1= Marett |2y= 1932}} The perspective of modern anthropology towards religion is the ''[[Psychological projection| projection]] idea'', a methodological approach which assumes that every religion is created by the human [[community]] that worships it, that "creative activity ascribed to God is projected from man".{{sfnm |1a1=Guthrie |1y= 2000 |1pp= 225–226 |2a1= Harvey |2y= 1996 |2p= 67 |3a1= Pandian |3y= 1997 |p= 507}} In 1841, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] was the first to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion.{{sfnm |1a1= Feuerbach |1y= 1841 |2a1= Harvey |2y= 1995 |2p= 4 |3a1= Mackey |3y= 2000 |pages= 41–42 |4a1= Nelson |4y= 1990}} A prominent precursor in the formulation of this projection principle was [[Giambattista Vico]]{{sfnm |1a1=Cotrupi |1y=2000 |1p=21 |2a1=Harvey |2y=1995 |2p=4}} (1668-1744), and an early formulation of it appears in the ancient Greek writer [[Xenophanes]] {{circa}} 570 – {{circa}} 475 BCE), who observed that "the gods of Ethiopians were inevitably black with flat noses while those of the Thracians were blond with blue eyes."{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p= 4}}

== Definition of religion ==

One major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}} At one time{{vague|date=April 2015}} anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or [[ghost]]s, the use of [[magic (religion)|magic]] as a means of controlling the [[supernatural]], the use of [[divination]] as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of [[ritual]]s such as [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]] as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of [[shamanism]] or [[ancestor worship]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} According to [[Clifford Geertz]], religion is
{{quote|(1) a system of symbols which acts to (2) establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by (3) formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and (4) clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that (5) the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1966|p=4}}}}

Today, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European [[primitivism]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion &ndash; such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual &ndash; but few claim that these criteria are universally valid.{{sfn|Eller|2007|p=7}}

[[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rathman |first=Jessica |title=Anthony Francis Clarke Wallace |url=http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030927142508/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/uvwxyz/wallace_anthony.html |archive-date=27 November 2003 |access-date=22 November 2017}}</ref>

# Individualistic: most basic; simplest. Example: [[vision quest]].
# Shamanistic: part-time religious practitioner, uses religion to heal, to divine, usually on the behalf of a client. The [[Tillamook (tribe)|Tillamook]] have four categories of shaman. Examples of shamans: spiritualists, faith healers, palm readers. Religious authority acquired through one's own means.
# Communal: elaborate set of beliefs and practices; group of people arranged in clans by lineage, age group, or some religious societies; people take on roles based on knowledge, and ancestral worship.
# Ecclesiastical: dominant in agricultural societies and states; are centrally organized and hierarchical in structure, paralleling the organization of states. Typically deprecates competing individualistic and shamanistic cults.
