'''Benjamin Creme''' (5 December 1922 − 24 October 2016) was a Scottish artist, author, [[esotericist]], and editor of ''[[Share International]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://share-international.org/background/bcreme/bc_main.htm|title=Benjamin Creme: A Messenger of Hope|publisher=Share-international.org|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref>

He asserted that the [[second coming]], prophesied by many religions, would come in the form of Maitreya, the World Teacher. ''[[Maitreya]]'' is the name [[Buddhists]] use for the future [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], but Creme claimed that Maitreya is the teacher that all religions point towards and hope for. Other names for him, according to Creme, are the [[Christ]], the [[Imam Mahdi]], [[Krishna]], and the [[Messiah]].  Creme claimed Maitreya is the "[[Avatar]] for the [[Age of Aquarius|Aquarian Age]]", is omniscient and omnipresent, and has lived in London since 19 July 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://share-international.org/index.htm|title=Share International Index|publisher=Share-international.org|accessdate=4 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102002835/http://www.share-international.org/index.htm|archivedate=2 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=SI1/><ref>{{cite news|author=Niebuhr, Gustav|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3D71F39F933A15754C0A960958260|title= New Millennium, Great Expectations|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 July 1996|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
At the age of thirteen Creme began painting, inspired by the work of Rembrandt. In order to become a painter he left school at sixteen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandgallery.com/artist_bio.php?mainId=65|title=Benjamin Creme, b. 1922, A Selected Chronology|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref> At the age of fourteen, Creme said, he became interested in the [[occult]], when he read ''With Mystics and Magicians in Tibet'' by [[Alexandra David-Neel]]. From 1957 to 1959 Creme was the Vice-President of the [[Aetherius Society]], a [[UFO religion]] based largely on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)| Theosophy]].<ref>Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London: Tara Press 1980 , p. 11</ref><ref>[[David V.

==Assigned mission by his Master==
Creme said that he was first contacted [[telepathy|telepathically]] by his [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Master]] in January 1959, when Creme was asked to make tape recordings of his messages.<ref>Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London: Tara Press 1980, p. 14</ref> Creme first began to speak publicly of his mission on 30 May 1975, at the [[Friends Meeting House]] on [[Euston Road]] in London, England.<ref>Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London: Tara Press 1980, p. 19</ref><ref>Creme, Benjamin (ed.). ''Messages from Maitreya the Christ''. Amsterdam: Share International Foundation 1981</ref> His central message announced the emergence of a group of enlightened spiritual teachers who could guide humanity forward into the new [[Aquarian Age]] of peace and brotherhood based on the principles of love and sharing. At the head of this group would be a great [[Avatar]], Maitreya, the [[World Teacher]], expected by all the major religions as their "Awaited One":  the Christ to the Christians, the [[Imam Mahdi]] to the [[Muslims]], the [[Messiah]] for [[Jews]] and the [[5th Buddha]] ([[Maitreya]]) for [[Buddhists]].

== Predictions in 1982 and later ==
[[File:Si cover 2008small.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Creme's magazine ''[[Share International]]'', featuring one of his artworks]]

In the spring of 1982 Creme placed advertisements in newspapers around the world saying, "The Christ is now here." According to Creme, the Christ, whom he also called Maitreya, would announce his existence on worldwide television broadcasts.  Creme stated in these newspaper advertisements that the [[Second Coming of Christ]] would occur on Monday 21 June 1982 (the [[summer solstice]] in the [[Northern hemisphere]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} On 14 May 1982 Creme held a press conference in Los Angeles. More than 90 reporters attended and heard Creme announce that Maitreya was living within the Asian community in the [[Brick Lane]] area of London. Creme presented the reporters with a challenge: if the media made a serious attempt to seek Maitreya in London, he would reveal himself to them. Afterwards, Creme wrote, "It was hoped that the media would respond to my information at a level which would allow Him to come forward to them. This hope, however, was not fulfilled. While the media did show an interest in the reappearance story, it did not go so far as to actually get involved in searching for Maitreya."<ref>[http://share-international.org/background/printed/mission_1.htm] Maitreya's Mission, Vol.1, p. 14</ref>

After 1982, Creme made a number of additional predictions and announcements about the imminent appearance of Maitreya, based on his claims of receiving telepathic messages from a [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Master of Wisdom]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Creme said that in January 1986, Maitreya contacted media representatives at the highest level in Britain who agreed to make an announcement. Under pressure from high religious and government officials, however, this statement was withheld.<ref>[http://share-international.org/background/printed/mission_1.htm] Maitreya's Mission, Vol.1, p. 14</ref><ref>[http://alcuinbramerton.blogspot.com/2016/04/christ-and-jesus-at-bbc-london-1986.html] Alcuin Bramerton: '''Christ and Jesus at the BBC''' - London 1986 BBC misses biggest story in English history. UK church establishment rejects Second Coming of Christ. Why did the BBC, the Queen and the Church of England bishops choose to ignore the Second Coming of Christ in 1986?</ref> 

Creme wrote, "On 26 February 1987 Maitreya gave an interview to the major American television company, Cable News Network (CNN). He was interviewed under His ordinary, everyday name, and did not call Himself the Christ. He did say, however, that, among other names, He was known as Maitreya. A group of His closest associates journeyed to the United States to arrange further interviews[...]" The CNN interview was made available for possible showing in 26 of a promised 29 countries in Europe, Scandinavia, North Africa and the Middle East, but was not broadcast in the United States. The CNN office in Atlanta explained that they could not see a framework in which to present the interview.<ref>Maitreya's Mission Vol. II (1993)</ref>

In 1997 Creme made similar announcements that there would be imminent global TV broadcasts from Christ/Maitreya, though with far less media interest.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Canada NewsWire|date=2 December 1997|title=British Futurist Says 'World Teacher'... will be interviewed on a major American network before the end of the year. This will be followed by appearances on other networks around the world and...will lead to a global satellite hook-up where Maitreya can speak to all people simultaneously -- in their own language.}}</ref> Creme stated that when the "Day of Declaration" occurred "The [[Maitreya (Benjamin Creme)|Christ]] will come on the world's television channels, linked together by satellite. All those with access to television will see ... [his face]. He will establish a telepathic rapport with all humanity simultaneously. While the Christ is speaking... [everyone will feel far more love than they've ever felt before, that massive outpouring of love will cause] hundreds of thousands of 'miracle' cures [to] take place simultaneously."<ref>Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission I'' 1986 p. 23</ref>

On 14 January 2010 Creme announced that Maitreya had given his first interview on American television. Soon afterwards several people in the [[United States]], working from Creme's predictions, concluded that the British-American economist and author [[Raj Patel]] was Maitreya. After newspaper articles spread this story around the world Creme responded that Raj Patel was not the coming World Teacher in an article in ''The Guardian'' under the headline "Raj Patel is Not Maitreya, But the World Teacher is Here — and Needed."<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|title=Raj Patel is Not Maitreya, But the World Teacher is Here – and Needed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/20/raj-patel-maitreya-world-teacher|author=Benjamin Creme|date=30 November 2006}}</ref>

Creme, who claimed that the time was now very near for Maitreya's emergence, apparently did not receive any money for his work or royalties from his 14 books, and for more than 30 years he gave lectures around the world by invitation only. A worldwide network of volunteers worked with Creme to give his views to the public.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Times |date=3 June 1982 |page=6 |author=The Tara Press |title=Advertisement}}</ref>

Creme died in October 2016 at the age of 93.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://omtimes.com/2016/10/benjamin-creme-passed-away/ | title=Author Benjamin Creme Has Passed Away| date=28 October 2016}}</ref>

==Crop circles and UFOs==
During an interview in 2006 Creme confirmed his views on the importance of [[crop circles]]: "The [[UFO]]s have an enormous part to play in the security of this planet at the ecological level. [The crop circles are part of] a new science that will give us energy directly from the sun. Oil will become a thing of the past. No one will be able to sell energy in the future."<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Sacramento News & Review|title=Signs of the Times: Crop Circles, Weeping Madonnas and the Strange Esoteric World of Benjamin Creme|author=R.V. Scheide|date=30 November 2006}}</ref>

Creme gave his explanation as to how crop circles are made by UFOs in his magazine: "The crop circles are there to draw attention to the fact that the [[Nordic aliens|Space Brothers]] are there. They are amazing constructions. They are made in seconds by the 'ships' of the Space Brothers. They are complex and beautiful constructions which cannot be made in any other way. They appear all over the world, but the majority are in the South of England. Why? Because Maitreya is in London."<ref name=SI1>{{cite web|url=http://www.share-international.org/magazine/old_issues/2009/2009-07.htm|title=Share International July / August 2009|publisher=Share-international.org|accessdate=4 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409071736/http://share-international.org/magazine/old_issues/2009/2009-07.htm|archivedate=9 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Predictions and responses==
Sceptics ridiculed the story presented by Benjamin Creme and took issue with the possibility that his predictions might have come true.<ref>"Francis Wheen's Diary". ''The Independent'' 27 January 1991: "Alas and alack, on the great issue of the day poor Mr Maitreya seems to have stubbed his toe rather badly. After Saddam sent his tanks across the border last August Maitreya suggested that a mystical power and force in nature will make Iraq withdraw totally and unconditionally from Kuwait. In November his message was unequivocal: The Gulf Crisis: Maitreya has made it clear from the beginning that there will be no war."</ref><ref>"Kiwis Prove to Aussies They're Not That Gullible". ''The Evening Post'' 4 December 1995. "But it's not just the eruptions at issue. Benjamin Creme, based in London and a five-time visitor to New Zealand as ambassador for Maitreya, the saviour he claims is awaited by all religions, has extended the connection. John O'Donnell of the New Zealand Transmission Meditation Network said Mr Creme had told him the 5.9 South Island quake on Friday, November 24 had been caused by the fourth French atomic test two days before. Nobody has yet predicted plagues of locusts, frogs, flies, rivers of blood or other disasters for the fifth and subsequent tests."</ref><ref>Ron Rosenbaum (15 August 2005). [http://www.bookrags.com/news/voices-in-our-head-where-is-good-old-20050814-moc/ "Voices in Our Head: Where is Good Old American Weirdness?"], New York Observer</ref> Some others have treated Creme's story with interest and are waiting to see what happens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.share-international.org/av/v_tv_interviews.htm|title=TV interviews with Benjamin Creme|publisher=Share-international.org|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref>

Between 1989 and 1991 Creme's magazine ''Share International'' published a series of forecasts given to two journalists{{who|date=March 2012}} by an associate of Maitreya, which the magazine claimed had come about with uncanny accuracy. These forecasts were purported to have included the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall]], the [[fall of the Soviet Union|ending of Communist rule in the Soviet Union]], the release of [[Nelson Mandela]] and the [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|ending of Apartheid]] in [[South Africa]], the release of [[Terry Waite]], the resignation of [[Margaret Thatcher]], and many more.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.share-international.org/magazine/old_issues/2007/s2606_30%20years_small.pdf |title=The Coming of Maitreya, the World Teacher |publisher=Share-international.org |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.share-international.org/background/miracles/mi_main.htm |title=Signs and Miracles |publisher=Share-international.org |accessdate=4 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625061310/http://share-international.org/background/miracles/MI_main.htm |archive-date=25 June 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.share-international.org/magazine/old_issues/2005/bc_2005.pdf |title=Compilation of Comments on World Events by Benjamin Creme in the Year 2005 as Published in Share International Magazine |publisher=Share-international.org |accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref>

Some [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] sources and other detractors accused Creme of being part of a satanic conspiracy and placed him among a number of "[[antichrist]] potentials".<ref>[[David V. Barrett]], ''[[The New Believers]]'', 2001 {{ISBN|0-304-35592-5}}, page 349</ref>
