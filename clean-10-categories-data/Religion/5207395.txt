A '''sacred garden''' is a religiously-influenced [[garden]], often found on [[temple]] grounds.

==Overview==
Religion has been an important influence on [[garden design]]. Temple gardens were made in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]]. [[Sacred grove]]s were made in ancient India, Greece, Rome, China and Japan. [[Sacred tree]]s were important in [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] and Germanic Europe and still are important in India. 

Many groves or forests were sacred in [[ancient India]] and continue to be so in modern [[Hindu]] worship. [[Buddhism]] had a significant influence on garden design, with the [[Japanese rock garden|Zen gardens]] of China and Japan as famous examples. In Christianity, particularly [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], [[Mary garden]]s are common among churches and institutions.

The practise of creating sacred gardens is re-invigorated and adapted for modern times in the ''Ringing Cedars'' series of books by Russian author [[Vladimir Megre]].
