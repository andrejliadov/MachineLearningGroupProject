In [[theology]], one meaning of the term '''dispensation''' is as a distinctive arrangement or period in history that forms the framework through which God relates to mankind.

==Protestant dispensations==
The concept of a dispensation – the arrangement of divisions in [[The Bible and history|Biblical history]] – dates back to [[Irenaeus]] in the second century. Other Christian writers and leaders since then, such as [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Joachim of Fiore]] (1135–1202), have also offered their own dispensation arrangements of history.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Progressive Dispensationalism | last = Blaising | first = Craig A. |author2=Darrell L. Bock | location = Wheaton, IL | date = 1993 | publisher = BridgePoint | isbn = 1-56476-138-X }} p. 116</ref> Many Protestant writers, including [[Herman Witsius]], [[Francis Turretin]], and [[Isaac Watts]] (1674–1748) also preached and taught dispensation schemes and divisions, and the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] noted "various dispensations" in 1646.

Within [[dispensationalism]], dispensations are a series of chronologically successive dispensations of Biblical history. The number of dispensations held are typically three,  four, seven or eight. The three and four dispensation schemes are often referred to as minimalist, as they recognize the commonly held{{by whom?|date=May 2020}} major breaks within Biblical history{{explain|date=May 2020}}. The seven and eight dispensation schemes are often closely associated with the announcement or inauguration of certain [[Covenant (biblical)|Biblical covenants]]. The variance in number relates to the extent of detail being emphasized by the author or speaker. Below is a table comparing some of the various dispensational schemes:

These different dispensations are not separate ways of [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]]. During each of them man is reconciled to God in only one way, (i.e. by [[Grace in Christianity|God's grace]] through the work of Christ that was [[Atonement in Christianity|accomplished on the cross]] and vindicated in [[Resurrection of Christ|His resurrection]]). Before the cross, man was saved on the basis of Christ's atoning sacrifice to come, through believing the revelation thus far given. Since the cross, man has been saved by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, in whom revelation and redemption have been consummated. On man's part, the continuing requirement is obedience to the revelation of God. This obedience is referred to as stewardship of faith.

Although the divine revelation unfolds progressively, the deposit of truth in earlier time-periods is not discarded, rather it is cumulative. Thus conscience (moral responsibility) is an abiding truth in human life (Ro. 2:15; 9:1; 2 Co. 1:12; 4:2), although it does not continue as a dispensation. Similarly, the saved of this present dispensation are "not under law" as a specific test of obedience to divine revelation (Gal. 5:18; cp. Gal 2:16; 3:11), yet the [[Christian views on the old covenant#Dispensationalism|law remains an integral part of Dispensational teaching]]. The Law clarifies that, although Christ fulfilled the law for us, by it we have had the knowledge of [[Christian views on sin|sin]] (Rom 7:7), and it is an integral part of the [[Holy Scriptures]], which, to the redeemed, are profitable for "training in [[righteousness]]" (2 Ti. 3:16–17; cp. Ro. 15:4). The purpose of each dispensation, then, is to place man under a [[Christian ethics|specific rule of conduct]], but such stewardship is not a condition of salvation. In every past dispensation [[Regeneration (theology)|unregenerate man]] has failed, much like he is failing in the present dispensation, and will fail in the future until [[End times|Eternity arrives]]. Salvation has been and will continue to be available to everyone by God's grace through faith. (The [[Scofield Reference Bible|New Scofield Study Bible]], 1984, pg. 3–4).

==Latter Day Saint dispensations==
In the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], a dispensation is a period of time in which God gave [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] authority to men on the Earth through [[Prophet#Latter Day Saint movement|prophetic]] callings. Between each dispensation is an apostasy where the priesthood is at least partially absent.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-a/lesson-2-the-priesthood-from-adam-to-the-restoration?lang=eng |title=Lesson 2: The Priesthood from Adam to the Restoration |work=Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part A |year=2000 |publisher=[[LDS Church]] }}</ref> The [[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)|LDS Bible Dictionary]] says: {{quote|A dispensation of the gospel is a period of time in which the Lord has at least one authorized servant on the earth who bears the holy priesthood and the keys, and who has a divine commission to dispense the gospel to the inhabitants of the earth.<ref name="LDS_BD">{{citation |contribution-url= http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bd/d/45 |contribution= Dispensations |title= Bible Dictionary, LDS edition of the Bible |publisher= LDS Church }}</ref> }}

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that there have been many dispensations, and use the Bible and modern revelation to identify and clarify some of them.  They also make note of dispensations occurring among the [[Ten Lost Tribes|Lost Tribes of Israel]] as well as [[Book of Mormon]] peoples, namely the [[Nephites]] and the [[Jaredites]].

;Adamic dispensation
According to Latter-day Saint scriptures an angel appeared to [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]] soon after they were driven out of the [[Garden of Eden]], who taught them the gospel and gave him priesthood authority which he passed down to his children (see Moses 5:6–9, Moses 6:64–65).  Eventually they "began from that time forth to be carnal, sensual, and devilish" (see Moses 5:12–13) and the priesthood was lost thus ending the dispensation in apostasy.

;Dispensation of Enoch
:See (Moses 7:69; Doctrine and Covenants D&C 107:48, D&C 107:53.
After [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] and the [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|people of Zion]] were taken from the earth, the wicked people became very numerous.

;Dispensation of [[Noah]]
:See Moses 8:19–20.

;Dispensation of Abraham
:See D&C 84:14; Abraham 1:16,18.
Which [[Abraham]] received the priesthood from [[Melchizedek]], who received it through the lineage of his fathers, even till Noah.

;Mosaic dispensation
:See D&C 84:6.
[[Moses]] and his sons, according to the Holy Priesthood which he received under the hand of his father-in-law, [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]].

;Dispensation of the meridian of time
This dispensation's authority was in [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] himself and then with the apostles after his death and resurrection. Following their death, shortly after the record of the Bible, and before the [[first seven Ecumenical Councils]], the Earth fell into the [[Great Apostasy]].

;Dispensation of the fulness of times
The [[dispensation of the fulness of times]] is the last dispensation before the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. It was begun with the [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|church in 1830]] and continued with the restoration of all the [[priesthood keys]] of each prior dispensation.
