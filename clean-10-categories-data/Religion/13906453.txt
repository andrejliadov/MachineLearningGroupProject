The '''Abrahamic religions''', also referred to collectively as the world of '''Abrahamism''', are a group of [[Semitic people|Semitic]]-originated [[religion]]s that claim descent from the [[Judaism]] of the ancient [[Israelites]] and the worship of the [[God in Abrahamic religions|God of Abraham]]. The Abrahamic religions are [[monotheistic]], with the term deriving from the patriarch [[Abraham]] (a major figure described both in the [[Tanakh]] and the [[Quran]], recognized by [[Jews]], [[Christians]], [[Muslims]] and others).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2010 |title=Philosophy of Religion |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497132/philosophy-of-religion |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=24 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721151923/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497132/philosophy-of-religion |archive-date=21 July 2010  |url-status=live}}</ref> The three Abrahamic religions trace their origins to the first two sons of Abraham. For Jews and Christians it is his second son [[Isaac]] and for Muslims, his eldest son [[Ishmael]].

Abrahamic religions spread globally through [[Christianity]] being adopted by the [[Roman Empire]] in the 4th century and [[Islam]] by the [[List of Muslim states and dynasties|Islamic empires]] from the 7th century. Today the Abrahamic religions are one of the major divisions in [[comparative religion]] (along with [[Indian religions|Indian]], [[Iranian religions|Iranian]], and [[East Asian religions]]).<ref name="Adams2">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-38030/classification-of-religions C.J.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Adherents of worlds major religions (2015).jpg|thumb|450x450px|Major religious groups as a percentage of world population {{asof|2015||lc=y}}.<ref>{{Cite web|title=World’s largest religion by population is still Christianity|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/05/christians-remain-worlds-largest-religious-group-but-they-are-declining-in-europe/|access-date=2020-10-25|website=Pew Research Center|language=en-US}}</ref>]]
The Catholic scholar of Islam [[Louis Massignon]] stated that the phrase "Abrahamic religion" means that all these religions come from one spiritual source.<ref name="Massignon 1949" /> The modern term comes from the plural form of a Quranic reference to ''[[millat Ibrahim|dīn Ibrāhīm]]'', 'religion of Ibrahim', the Arabic form of Abraham's name.<ref>[[Guy Stroumsa|Guy G.Stroumsa]], ''The Making of the Abrahamic Religions in Late Antiquity,'' {{isbn|978-0-191-05913-1}} Oxford University Press 2015 p.7</ref>

God's promise at Genesis 15:4-8 regarding Abraham's heirs became paradigmatic for Jews, who speak of him as "our father Abraham" (''Avraham Avinu''). With the emergence of Christianity, [[Paul the Apostle]], in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans 4:11-12]], likewise referred to him as "father of all" those who have faith, circumcised or uncircumcised. Islam likewise conceived itself as the religion of Abraham.<ref name="Levinson" >Jon D. Levenson, ''Inheriting Abraham: The Legacy of the Patriarch in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam,'' [[Princeton University Press]], 2014 {{isbn|978-0-691-16355-0}} ch.1 & pp.3, 6, 178-179</ref>

All the major Abrahamic religions claim a direct lineage to Abraham, although in Christianity this is understood in spiritual terms:
* Abraham is recorded in the [[Torah]] as the ancestor of the [[Israelites]] through his son [[Isaac]], born to [[Sarah]] through a promise made in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].{{bibleref2c|Gen.|17:16}}<ref>Scherman, pp.&nbsp;34–35.</ref>
* Christians affirm the ancestral origin of the Jews in Abraham, but, as [[gentiles]], faith is what determines the issue for being Christian, not lineal descent.<ref name="Levinson" />
* It is the Islamic tradition that [[Muhammad]], as an [[Arabs|Arab]], is descended from Abraham's son [[Ishmael]]. Jewish tradition also equates the descendants of Ishmael, [[Ishmaelites]], with Arabs, while the descendants of Isaac by Jacob, who was also later known as Israel, are the Israelites.<ref>Saheeh al-Bukharee, Book 55, hadith no. 584; Book 56, hadith no. 710</ref>

Adam Dodds argues that the term "Abrahamic faiths", while helpful, can be misleading, as it conveys an unspecified historical and theological commonality that is problematic on closer examination. While there is commonality among the religions, in large measure their shared ancestry is peripheral to their respective foundational beliefs and thus conceals crucial differences.<ref name="Dodds" /> For example, the common Christian beliefs of [[Incarnation]], [[Trinity]], and the [[resurrection of Jesus]] are not accepted by Judaism or Islam (see for example [[Islamic view of Jesus' death]]). There are key beliefs in both Islam and Judaism that are not shared by most of Christianity (such as strict [[monotheism]] and [[religious law|adherence to Divine Law]]), and key beliefs of Islam, Christianity, and the Baháʼí Faith not shared by Judaism (such as the [[prophet]]ic and [[Messiah|Messianic]] position of [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy|Jesus]], respectively).<ref>Greenstreet, p.&nbsp;95.</ref>

== Challenges to the term ==
The appropriateness of grouping Judaism, Christianity, and Islam by the terms "Abrahamic religions" or "Abrahamic traditions" has been challenged.

In 2012, [[Alan L. Berger]], Professor of Judaic Studies at Florida Atlantic University,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.fau.edu/aberger/web/bio.htm |title=Dr. Alan L. Berger |website=Florida Atlantic University |access-date=15 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003410/http://home.fau.edu/aberger/web/bio.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> in his Preface to ''Trialogue and Terror: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam after 9/11'' wrote that there are "commonalities", but "there are essential differences between the Abrahamic traditions" both "historical and theological". Although "Judaism birthed both Christianity and Islam", the "three monotheistic faiths went their separate ways". The three faiths "understand the role of Abraham" in "differing ways", and the relationships between Judaism and Christianity and between Judaism and Islam are "uneven". Also, the three traditions are "demographically unbalanced and ideologically diverse".<ref>Alan L. Berger, ed., ''Trialogue and Terror: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam after 9/11'' (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2012), xiii.</ref>{{Third-party inline|date=November 2020}}

Also in 2012, [[Aaron W. Hughes]] published a book about the category Abrahamic religions as an example of "abuses of history." He said that only recently the category "Abrahamic religions" has come into use and that it is a "vague referent." It is "largely a theological neologism" and "an artificial and imprecise" term. Combining the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions into this one category might serve the purpose of encouraging "interfaith trialogue", but it is not true to the "historical record". Abrahamic religions is "an ahistorical category". There are "certain family resemblances" among these three religions, but the "amorphous" term "Abrahamic religions" prevents an understanding of the "complex nature" of the interactions among them. Furthermore, the three religions do not share the same story of Abraham. For these and other reasons, Hughes argued that the term should not be used, at least in academic circles.<ref>Aaron W. Hughes, ''Abrahamic Religions: On the Uses and Abuses of History'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), 3–4, 7–8, 17, 32.</ref>{{Third-party inline|date=November 2020}}

== Religions ==
=== Judaism ===
{{Main|History of Judaism}}
[[File:Skverer Rebbe With Torah.jpg|thumb|200px|A Jewish [[Rebbe]] holds a [[Torah]]]]
One of Judaism's primary texts is the [[Tanakh]], an account of the [[Israelite]]s' relationship with God from their earliest history until the building of the [[Second Temple]] (c. 535 BCE). Abraham is hailed as the first [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] and the father of the [[Jews|Jewish people]]. One of his great-grandsons was [[Judah (Biblical person)|Judah]], from whom the religion ultimately gets its name. The Israelites were initially a number of tribes who lived in the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah]].

After being conquered and exiled, some members of the Kingdom of Judah eventually returned to Israel. They later formed an [[List of Jewish states and dynasties|independent state]] under the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE, before becoming a client kingdom of the [[Roman Empire]], which also conquered the state and dispersed its inhabitants. From the 2nd to the 6th centuries Jews wrote the [[Talmud]], a lengthy work of legal rulings and Biblical exegesis which, along with the Tanakh, is a key text of Judaism.

=== Christianity ===
{{Main|History of Christianity}}
[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|right|thumb|Christianity is based on the teachings of the Bible]]
[[Christianity]] [[Christianity in the 1st century|began in the 1st century]] as a sect within Judaism initially led by [[Jesus]]. His followers viewed him as the [[Messiah]], as in the [[Confession of Peter]]; after his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and death they came to view him as [[Incarnation|God incarnate]],<ref>Pavlac, Brian A (2010). ''A Concise Survey of Western Civilization: Supremacies and Diversities''.  Chapter 6.</ref> who was [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] and will [[Second Coming|return]] at the end of time to [[Last Judgment|judge the living and the dead]] and create an eternal [[Kingdom of God]]. Within a few decades the new movement [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|split from Judaism]]. Christian teaching is based on the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s of the [[Bible]].

After several periods of alternating persecution and relative peace ''vis a vis'' the Roman authorities under different administrations, Christianity became the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, but has been [[Early centers of Christianity|split into various churches from its beginning]]. An attempt was made by the [[Byzantine Empire]] to unify [[Christendom]], but this formally failed with the [[East–West Schism]] of 1054. In the 16th century, the birth and growth of [[Protestantism]] during the [[Reformation]] further split Christianity into many [[Christian denomination|denominations]].

=== Islam ===
{{Main|History of Islam|God in Islam}}
[[File:Abraham tomb.JPG|thumb|200px|The tomb of Abraham, a [[cenotaph]] above the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] traditionally considered to be the burial place of Abraham.]]
Islam is based on the teachings of the [[Quran]]. Although it considers Muhammad to be the [[Seal of the prophets]], Islam teaches that every [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] preached Islam, as the word ''Islam'' literally means submission to God, the main concept preached by all Abrahamic prophets. The teachings of the Quran are believed by Muslims to be the direct and final revelation and words of [[Allah]] (i.e. God in Arabic). Islam, like Christianity, is a [[Religion#Morphological classification|universal religion]] (i.e. membership is open to anyone). Like Judaism, it has a strictly unitary conception of God, called ''[[tawhid]]'', or "strict" monotheism.<ref name="BBCIslam">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/ataglance/glance.shtml Religions » Islam » Islam at a glance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521230250/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/ataglance/glance.shtml|date=21 May 2009}}, BBC, 5 August 2009.</ref>

=== Other Abrahamic religions ===
Historically, the Abrahamic religions have been considered to be Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Some of this is due to the age and larger size of these three. The other, similar religions were seen as either too new to judge as being truly in the same class, or too small to be of significance to the category.

However, some of the restriction of Abrahamic to these three is due only to tradition in historical classification. Therefore, restricting the category to these three religions has come under criticism.<ref name="trialogue">

Founded in 1844, Bábism flourished in [[Persian Empire|Persia]] until 1852, then lingered on in exile in the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially [[Cyprus]], as well as underground. An anomaly amongst Islamic messianic movements, the Bábí movement signaled a break with Islam, beginning a new religious system with its own unique laws, teachings, and practices. While Bábism was violently opposed by both clerical and government establishments, it led to the founding of the Baháʼí Faith, whose followers consider the religion founded by the Báb as a predecessor to their own.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

====  Rastafari====
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
[[Rastafari]], sometimes termed Rastafarianism, is also sometimes listed as an Abrahamic religion. Classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and [[social movement]], it developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It lacks any centralised authority and there is much heterogeneity among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.

Rastafari refer to their beliefs, which are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]], as "Rastalogy". Central is a monotheistic belief in a single God—referred to as [[Jah]]—who partially resides within each individual. The former emperor of Ethiopia, [[Haile Selassie]], is given central importance. Many Rastas regard him as an incarnation of Jah on Earth and as the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. Others regard him as a human prophet who fully recognised the inner divinity within every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses its attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or "Babylon". Many Rastas call for the resettlement of the African diaspora in either Ethiopia or Africa more widely, referring to this continent as the [[Promised Land]] of "Zion". Other interpretations shift focus on to the adoption of an Afrocentric attitude while living outside of Africa. Rastas refer to their practices as "livity". Communal meetings are known as "groundations", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter being regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas place emphasis on what they regard as living 'naturally', adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, allowing their hair to form into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.

Rastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures like [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several Christian clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that the crowning of Haile Selassie as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians like [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley.

The Rasta movement is organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or "[[Mansions of Rastafari]]", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], [[Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each of which offers different interpretations of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world; the largest population is in Jamaica although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres.

====  Samaritanism ====
[[Samaritanism]] is based on some of the same books used as the basis of Judaism but differs from the latter. Samaritan religious works include the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan version of the Torah]], the Memar Markah, the Samaritan liturgy, and Samaritan law codes and biblical commentaries. Many{{who|date=April 2017}} claim the Samaritans appear to have a text of the Torah as old as the [[Masoretic Text]]; scholars have various theories concerning the actual relationships between these three texts.

====  Shabakism  ====
[[Shabakism]] is the name given to the beliefs and practices of the [[Shabak people]] of [[Kurdistan region]] and around [[Mosul]] in [[Iraq]]. A majority of Shabaks regard themselves as Shia, and a minority identify as [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]].<ref name="aina">{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20140721084628.htm|title=Iraq: The Minorities of the Nineveh Plain|author=Mina al-Lami|date=21 August 2014|access-date=9 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015121233/http://www.aina.org/news/20140721084628.htm|archive-date=15 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niqash.org/en/articles/society/2219/|title=The Shabak Search for Identity|first=Adel|last=Kamal|website=Niqash.org|access-date=1 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727212216/http://www.niqash.org/en/articles/society/2219/|archive-date=27 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28351073|title=Iraq: The minorities of Nineveh|first=Mina|last=al-Lami|date=21 July 2014|access-date=1 August 2018|newspaper=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180803025212/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28351073|archive-date=3 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/07/07/iraqs-religious-ethnic-minorities-disappearing-due-isis-violence-global-inaction/|title=Iraq's Religious, Ethnic Minorities Disappearing Due to ISIS Violence and Global Inaction - Non Profit News - Nonprofit Quarterly|website=nonprofitquarterly.org|access-date=1 August 2018|date=2016-07-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728035632/https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/07/07/iraqs-religious-ethnic-minorities-disappearing-due-isis-violence-global-inaction/|archive-date=28 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite this, their actual faith and rituals differ from Islam, and have characteristics that make them distinct from neighboring [[Muslim]] populations. These include features from Christianity including [[Confession (religion)|confession]], and the consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and the fact that Shabaks often go on pilgrimage to [[Yazidi]] shrines.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Nevertheless, the Shabak people also go on pilgrimages to Shia holy cities such as [[Najaf]] and [[Karbala]], and follow many Shiite teachings.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Imranali Panjwani|title=Shi'a of Samarra: The Heritage and Politics of a Community in Iraq|page=172}}</ref>

The organization of Shabakism appears to be much like that of a [[Sufi order]]: adult laymen ([[Murid]]s) are bound to spiritual guides ([[Pir (Sufism)|pîrs]] or [[Murshid]]s) who are knowledgeable in matters of religious doctrine and ritual. There are several ranks of such pîrs; at the top stands the Baba, or supreme head of the order. Theoretically individuals can choose their own pîr, but in practice the pir families often become associated with lay families over several generations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node/133|title=The Shabak and the Kakais - Kurdish Academy of Language|website=Kurdishacademy.org|access-date=1 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730110626/http://kurdishacademy.org/?q=node%2F133|archive-date=30 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Shabakism combines elements of [[Sufism]] with the uniquely Shabak interpretation of "divine reality." According to Shabaks, this divine reality supersedes the literal, or [[Shar'ia]], interpretation of the [[Quran]]. Shabaks comprehend divine reality through the mediation of the "Pir" or spiritual guide, who also performs Shabak rituals.<ref name="AVino">{{cite journal | last1 = Vinogradov | first1 = A. | year = 1974| title = Ethnicity, Cultural Discontinuity and Power Brokers in Northern Iraq: The Case of the Shabak | jstor = 643810 | journal = American Ethnologist | volume =  1| issue = 1 | pages = 207–218| doi = 10.1525/ae.1974.1.1.02a00110 }}</ref> The structure of these mediatory relationships closely resembles that of the Yarsan.<ref name=KaW>{{cite web|url=http://kurdishacademy.org/?q=node%2F133|title=The Shabak and the Kakais|first=Michiel|last=Leezenberg|access-date=2 November 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412221746/http://kurdishacademy.org/?q=node%2F133|archive-date=12 April 2016}}</ref>

== Origins and history ==
{{See also|Ancient Canaanite religion|Yahweh|Origins of Judaism|Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia}}
The civilizations that developed in [[Mesopotamia]] influenced some religious texts, particularly the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Book of Genesis]]. Abraham is said to have originated in Mesopotamia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bertman|first1=Stephen|title=Handbook to life in ancient Mesopotamia|date=2005|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0195183641|page=312|edition=Paperback}}</ref>

Judaism regards itself as the religion of the descendants of Jacob,<ref group="n">Jacob is also called Israel, a name the [[Bible]] states he was given by God.</ref> a grandson of Abraham. It has a [[God in Judaism|strictly unitary]] view of God, and the central holy book for almost all branches is the [[Masoretic Text]] as elucidated in the [[Oral Torah]]. In the 19th century and 20th centuries Judaism developed a small number of branches, of which the most significant are [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]].

[[Early Christianity|Christianity began]] as a [[Jewish Christian|sect of Judaism]]<ref group="n">cf. [[Judaizer]], [[Messianic Judaism]]</ref> in the [[Mediterranean Basin]]<ref group="n">With several centers, such as [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Rome]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Greece|Thessaloniki and Corinth]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]], and later spread outwards, eventually having two main centers in the empire, one for the [[Western Church]] and one for the [[Eastern Church]] in Rome and [[Constantinople]] respectively by the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century CE]]</ref> of the first century [[Common Era|CE]] and [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|evolved into a separate religion]]—Christianity—with distinctive beliefs and practices. [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] is the central figure of Christianity, considered by almost all denominations to be [[God the Son]], one [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|person]] of the [[Trinity]]. (''See [[God in Christianity]].<ref group="n">[[Trinity|Triune God]] is also called the "Holy Trinity"</ref>'') The [[Christian biblical canons]] are usually held to be the ultimate authority, alongside [[sacred tradition]] in some [[Christian denomination|denominations]] (such as the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]). Over many centuries, Christianity divided into three main branches (Catholic, Orthodox, and [[Protestantism|Protestant]]), [[List of Christian denominations|dozens of significant denominations]], and hundreds of smaller ones.

Islam arose in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]<ref group="n">Islam arose specifically in [[Tihamah]] city of [[Mecca]] and [[Hejaz]] city of [[Medina]] of Arabia</ref> in the 7th century CE with a [[God in Islam|strictly unitary view of God]].<ref group="n">The monotheistic view of God in Islam is called ''[[tawhid]]'' which is essentially the same as the conception of God in Judaism</ref> [[Muslim]]s hold the Quran to be the ultimate authority, as revealed and elucidated through the [[Sunnah|teachings and practices]]<ref group="n">Teachings and practices of Muhammad are collectively known as the ''[[sunnah]]'', similar to the [[Halakha|Judaic concepts of oral law]] and [[exegesis]], or ''[[talmud]]'' and ''[[midrash]]''</ref> of a central, but not divine, prophet, Muhammad. The Islamic faith considers all [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|prophets and messengers]] from [[Adam]] through the [[Seal of the Prophets|final messenger]] (Muhammad) to carry the same Islamic monotheistic principles. Soon after its founding, Islam split into two main branches (Sunni and Shia Islam), each of which now has a number of denominations.

The Baháʼí Faith began within the context of Shia Islam in 19th-century Persia, after a merchant named [[Báb|Siyyid 'Alí Muḥammad Shírází]] claimed divine revelation and took on the title of the Báb, or "the Gate". The Bab's ministry proclaimed the imminent advent of "[[He whom God shall make manifest]]", who Baháʼís accept as [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. Baháʼís revere the Torah, Gospels and the Quran, and the writings of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, and 'Abdu’l-Bahá' are considered the central texts of the faith. A vast majority of adherents are unified under a single denomination.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Baháʼí Faith – The website of the worldwide Baháʼí community |url=http://www.bahai.org |website=Bahai.org |access-date=5 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904043121/http://www.bahai.org/ |archive-date=4 September 2015 |url-status=live |quote=the religions of the world come from the same Source and are in essence successive chapters of one religion from God}}</ref>

Lesser-known Abrahamic religions, originally offshoots of Shia Islam, include Bábism<ref group="n">Historically, the Baháʼí Faith arose in 19th-century Persia, in the context of Shia Islam, and thus may be classed on this basis as a divergent strand of Islam, placing it in the Abrahamic tradition. However, the Baháʼí Faith considers itself an independent religious tradition, which arose from a Muslim context but also recognizes other traditions. The Baháʼí Faith may also be classed as a [[new religious movement]], due to its comparatively recent origin, or may be considered sufficiently old and established for such classification to not be applicable.</ref> and the Druze faith.<ref>* {{cite news |last=Dolbee |first=Sandi |title=Faith, Hope and Understand: Teenagers Questions and learn about each other's Faiths |newspaper=The San Diego Union–Tribune |page=E.1 |date=27 March 2003 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/319404861.html?dids=319404861:319404861&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+27%2C+2003&author=Sandi+Dolbee&pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&edition=&startpage=E.1&desc=FAITH%2C+HOPE+AND+UNDERSTAND+%7C+TEENAGERS+QUESTIONS+AND+LEARN+ABOUT+EACH+OTHER%27S+FAITHS |access-date=3 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111205124/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/319404861.html?dids=319404861:319404861&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+27%2C+2003&author=Sandi+Dolbee&pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&edition=&startpage=E.1&desc=FAITH%2C+HOPE+AND+UNDERSTAND+%7C+TEENAGERS+QUESTIONS+AND+LEARN+ABOUT+EACH+OTHER%27S+FAITHS |archive-date=11 January 2012 |url-status=live }}

In the three main Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), the individual, God, and the universe are highly separate from each other. The Abrahamic religions believe in a judging, paternal, fully external god to which the individual and nature are subordinate. One seeks [[salvation]] or transcendence not by contemplating the natural world or via philosophical speculation, but by seeking to please God (such as obedience with God's wishes or his law) and see [[divine revelation]] as outside of self, nature, and custom.

=== Monotheism ===
[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|right|The [[Trinity]] is the belief in Christianity that God is one God in three persons: [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]] ([[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]]), and [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|God the Holy Spirit]].]]

Christianity and Islam both revere Jesus ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''[[Jesus in Islam|Isa]]'' or ''Yasu'' among Muslims and [[Arab Christians]] respectively) but with vastly differing conceptions:
* Christians view Jesus as the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|saviour]] (and most Christians also regard him as [[Incarnation|God incarnate]]).
* Muslims see Isa as a [[Prophet of Islam]]<ref name="EoQP">Uri Rubin, ''Prophets and Prophethood'', ''[[Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an]]''</ref> and Messiah.

However, the worship of Jesus, or the ascribing of partners to God (known as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' in Islam and as ''[[shituf]]'' in Judaism), is typically viewed as the [[heresy]] of [[idolatry]] by Islam and Judaism. Judaism and Islam see the incarnation of God into human form as a heresy.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Theological continuity ===
{{See also|Messianism}}
All the Abrahamic religions affirm one eternal God who created the universe, who rules history, who sends [[prophecy|prophetic]] and angelic messengers and who reveals the [[divine law|divine will]] through inspired [[revelation]]. They also affirm that obedience to this [[creator deity]] is to be lived out historically and that one day God will unilaterally intervene in human history at the [[Last Judgment]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Christianity, Islam, and Judaism have a [[Teleology|teleological]] view on history, unlike the static or [[Social cycle theory|cyclic]] view on it found in other cultures<ref>[[Samuel P. Huntington]]: Der Kampf der Kulturen. Die Neugestaltung der Weltpolitik im 21. Jahrhundert, Frankfurt 1997, p. 337.</ref> (the latter being common in [[Indian religions]]).

=== Scripture ===
{{See also|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Development of the Christian biblical canon|History of the Quran}}
All Abrahamic religions believe that God guides humanity through [[revelation]] to prophets, and each religion recognizes that God revealed teachings up to and including those in their own scripture.

=== Ethical orientation ===
{{See also|Ethical monotheism}}
An [[Ethics|ethical]] orientation: all these religions speak of a choice between good and evil, which is associated with obedience or disobedience to a single God and to [[Divine Law]].

=== Eschatological world view ===
An [[eschatology|eschatological]] world view of history and destiny, beginning with the [[Creation myth|creation]] of the world and the concept that God works through history, and ending with a [[resurrection of the dead]] and [[Last Judgment|final judgment]] and [[world to come]].<ref>Wiener, Philip P.

Even though members of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not all claim Abraham as an ancestor, some members of these religions have tried to claim him as exclusively theirs.<ref name="Lubar">{{cite web |title=Why 'Abrahamic'? |publisher=Lubar Institute for Religious Studies at [[University of Wisconsin - Madison]] |year=2007 |url=http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/Why%20Abrahamic.html |access-date=15 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809154055/http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/Why%20Abrahamic.html |archive-date=9 August 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

For [[Jews]], Abraham is the founding [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarch]] of the children of Israel. God promised Abraham: "I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you."{{Bibleref2c|Gen.|12:2}} With Abraham, God entered into "an everlasting covenant throughout the ages to be God to you and to your offspring to come".{{Bibleref2c|Gen.|17:7}} It is this covenant that makes Abraham and his descendants children of the covenant. Similarly, converts, who join the covenant, are all identified as sons and daughters of Abraham.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

Abraham is primarily a revered ancestor or [[patriarch]] (referred to as ''Avraham Avinu'' (אברהם אבינו in [[Hebrew]]) "Abraham our father") to whom God made several promises: chiefly, that he would have numberless descendants, who would receive the land of Canaan (the "[[Promised Land]]"). According to Jewish tradition, Abraham was the first post-[[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]] prophet to reject [[idolatry]] through rational analysis, although [[Shem]] and [[Eber]] carried on the tradition from [[Noah]].<ref>Shultz, Joseph P. "Two Views of the Patriarchs", in Nahum Norbert Glatzer, Michael A. Fishbane, Paul R. Mendes-Flohr (eds.) (1975). ''Texts and Responses: Studies presented to Nahum N.

[[Abraham#Christianity|Christians view Abraham]] as an important exemplar of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], and a spiritual, as well as physical, ancestor of Jesus. For Christians, Abraham is a spiritual forebear as well as/rather than a direct ancestor depending on the [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism|individual's interpretation of Paul the Apostle]],{{bibleref2c|Rom.|4:9–12}} with the [[Abrahamic covenant]] "reinterpreted so as to be defined by faith in Christ rather than biological descent" or both by faith as well as a direct ancestor; in any case, the emphasis is placed on faith being the only requirement for the Abrahamic Covenant to apply<ref>Blasi, Turcotte, Duhaime, p.&nbsp;592.</ref> (see also [[New Covenant]] and [[supersessionism]]). In Christian belief, Abraham is a [[role model]] of faith,{{bibleref2c|Heb.|11:8–10}}{{primary source inline|date=August 2017}} and his obedience to God by [[Binding of Isaac|offering Isaac]] is seen as a [[foreshadowing]] of God's offering of his son Jesus.{{bibleref2c|Rom.|8:32}}<ref>{{Cite book | last = MacArthur | first = John | author-link = John F.

Christian commentators have a tendency to interpret God's promises to Abraham as applying to Christianity subsequent to, and sometimes rather than (as in supersessionism), being applied to Judaism, whose adherents [[Rejection of Jesus|rejected Jesus]]. They argue this on the basis that just as Abraham as a [[Gentile]] (before he was [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]]) "believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness" {{bibleref2c|Gen.|15:6}} (cf. Rom. 4:3, James 2:23), "those who have faith are children of Abraham" {{bibleref2c|Gal.|3:7}} (see also John 8:39). This is most fully developed in [[Pauline Christianity|Paul's theology]] where all who believe in God are spiritual descendants of Abraham.{{bibleref2c|Rom.|4:20}} {{bibleref2c|Gal.|4:9}}<ref>"So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith."  "In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring." (Rom. 9:8)</ref> However, with regards to {{Biblesource|Rom.|4:20}} and {{Biblesource|Gal.|4:9}}, in both cases he refers to these spiritual descendants as the "[[sons of God]]"{{bibleref2c|Gal.|4:26}} rather than "children of Abraham".<ref>Bickerman, p.&nbsp;188cf.</ref>

For Muslims, Abraham is a [[Prophet of Islam|prophet]], the "[[apostle (Islam)|messenger]] of God" who stands in the line from Adam to Muhammad, to whom God gave revelations,{{Cite quran|4|163}}, who "raised the foundations of the House" (i.e., the [[Kaaba]]){{Cite quran|2|127}} with his first son, [[Isma'il]], a symbol of which is every mosque.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Leeming | first = David Adams | title = The Oxford companion to world mythology | publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 2005 | location = US | page = [https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont0000leem/page/209 209] | url = https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont0000leem| url-access = registration | isbn = 978-0-19-515669-0}}</ref> Ibrahim (Abraham) is the first in a [[genealogy]] for Muhammad.

== Differences ==

=== God ===
{{Main|God in Abrahamic religions|God in Judaism|God in Christianity|God in Islam|Yahweh|Tetragrammaton|El (deity)}}
The Abrahamic God is conceived of as [[Eternity#God and eternity|eternal]], [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]] and as the [[Creator deity|creator of the universe]]. God is further held to have the properties of holiness, justice, [[omnibenevolence]] and [[omnipresence]]. Proponents of Abrahamic faiths believe that God is also [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], but at the same time [[personal God|personal]] and involved, listening to [[prayer]] and reacting to the actions of his creatures.

[[File:JudaismSymbol.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Star of David]] (or ''Magen David''), is a generally recognized symbol of modern Jewish identity and Judaism.]]
In [[Jewish theology]], God is strictly monotheistic. God is an absolute one, indivisible and incomparable [[being]] who is the ultimate cause of all existence. Jewish tradition teaches that the true aspect of God is incomprehensible and unknowable and that it is only God's revealed aspect that brought the universe into existence, and interacts with mankind and the world. In Judaism, the one God of Israel is the God of Abraham, [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]], who is the guide of the world, delivered [[Israelites|Israel]] from [[The Exodus|slavery in Egypt]], and gave them the [[613 Mitzvot]] at [[Mount Sinai]] as described in the [[Torah]].

The [[national god]] of the [[Israelite]]s has a [[Theonym|proper name]], written [[YHWH]] ({{Hebrew name|יְהֹוָה|Yehovah|Yəhōwāh}}) in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]]. The name YHWH is a combination of the future, present, and past tense of the verb "howa" ({{lang-he|הוה}}) meaning "to be" and translated literally means "The self-existent One". A further explanation of the name was given to Moses when YHWH stated ''Eheye Asher Eheye'' ({{lang-he|אהיה אשר אהיה}}) "I will be that I will be", the name relates to God as God truly is, God's revealed essence, which transcends the universe. It also represents God's compassion towards the world. In Jewish tradition another name of God is [[Elohim]], relating to the interaction between God and the universe, God as manifest in the physical world, it designates the justice of God, and means "the One who is the totality of powers, forces and causes in the universe".

[[File:Christianity Symbol.png|thumb|right|The [[Christian cross]] (or crux) is the best-known religious symbol of Christianity; this version is known as a Latin Cross.]]
In [[Christian theology]], God is the [[Eternity#God and eternity|eternal being]] who [[Genesis creation narrative|created]] and [[Divine providence|preserves]] the world. Christians believe God to be both transcendent and [[immanent]] (involved in the world).<ref name=Leith55>''Basic Christian Doctrine'' by John H.

[[File:IslamSymbolAllahComp.PNG|thumb|right|The word [[God]] written in [[Arabic]]]]

In [[Islamic theology]], God ({{lang-ar|{{large|الله}}}} ''[[Allāh|{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh}}]]'') is the [[Omnipotence|all-powerful]] and [[Omniscience|all-knowing]] creator, sustainer, ordainer and judge of everything in existence.<ref name="EoQ-Quran">Gerhard Böwering ''God and his Attributes'', [[Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān]] Quran.com, ''Islam: The Straight Path'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p.&nbsp;22</ref> Islam emphasizes that God is strictly singular (''[[tawhid|{{transl|ar|ALA|tawḥīd}}]]'')<ref>John L.

These 99 names describe attributes of God, including Most Merciful, The Just, The Peace and Blessing, and the Guardian.

Islamic belief in God is distinct from Christianity in that God has no progeny. This belief is summed up in [[Sura|chapter]] 112 of the Quran titled [[Al-Ikhlas]], which states "Say, he is Allah (who is) one, Allah is the Eternal, the Absolute. He does not beget nor was he begotten. Nor is there to Him any equivalent".{{cite quran|112|1|4}}

=== Scriptures ===
{{Main|Tanakh|Bible|Old Testament|New Testament|Quran|Hadith}}
All these religions rely on a body of scriptures, some of which are considered to be the word of God—hence sacred and unquestionable—and some the work of religious men, revered mainly by tradition and to the extent that they are considered to have been divinely inspired, if not dictated, by the divine being.

The sacred scriptures of Judaism are the [[Hebrew Bible|Tanakh]], a Hebrew acronym standing for ''[[Torah]]'' (Law or Teachings), ''[[Nevi'im]]'' (Prophets) and ''[[Ketuvim]]'' (Writings). These are complemented by and supplemented with various (originally oral) traditions: ''[[Midrash]]'', the ''[[Mishnah]]'', the ''[[Talmud]]'' and collected rabbinical writings. The Tanakh (or [[Hebrew Bible]]) was composed between 1,400 BCE, and 400 BCE by Jewish [[:Category:Jewish prophets|prophets]], kings, and [[Kohen|priests]].

The Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular is considered holy, down to the last letter: transcribing is done with painstaking care. An error in a single letter, ornamentation or symbol of the 300,000+ stylized letters that make up the Hebrew Torah text renders a Torah scroll unfit for use; hence the skills of a Torah scribe are specialist skills, and a scroll takes considerable time to write and check.

[[File:Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg|thumb|250px|A Bible handwritten in [[Latin]], on display in [[Malmesbury Abbey]], Wiltshire, England. This Bible was transcribed in Belgium in 1407 for reading aloud in a monastery.]]
The sacred scriptures of most Christian groups are the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]]. Latin Bibles originally contained 73 books; however, 7 books, collectively called the [[Apocrypha]] or [[Deuterocanon]] depending on one's opinion of them, were removed by [[Martin Luther]] due to a lack of original Hebrew sources, and now vary on their inclusion between denominations. Greek Bibles contain additional materials.

The New Testament comprises four accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus (the [[Four Gospels]]), as well as several other writings (the [[Epistle#New Testament epistles|epistles]]) and the [[Book of Revelation]]. They are usually considered to be [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]], and together comprise the [[Bible|Christian Bible]].

The vast majority of Christian faiths (including Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity, and most forms of Protestantism) recognize that the Gospels were passed on by oral tradition, and were not set to paper until decades after the resurrection of Jesus and that the extant versions are copies of those originals. The version of the Bible considered to be most valid (in the sense of best conveying the true meaning of the word of God) has varied considerably: the Greek [[Septuagint]], the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Peshitta]], the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]], the English [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]] and the Russian Synodal Bible have been authoritative to different communities at different times.

The sacred scriptures of the Christian Bible are complemented by a large body of writings by individual Christians and councils of Christian leaders (see [[canon law]]). Some Christian churches and denominations consider certain [[Religious text#Additional and alternate scriptures|additional writings]] to be binding; other Christian groups consider only the Bible to be binding ([[sola scriptura]]).

[[File:Quran rzabasi1.JPG|thumb|9th-century Quran in [[Reza Abbasi Museum]]]]
Islam's holiest book is the Quran, comprising 114 [[Sura]]s ("chapters of the Qur'an"). However, Muslims also believe in the religious texts of Judaism and Christianity in their original forms, albeit not the current versions. According to the Quran (and mainstream Muslim belief), the verses of the Quran were revealed by God through the Archangel [[Jibrail]] to Muhammad on separate occasions. These revelations were written down and also memorized by hundreds of companions of Muhammad. These multiple sources were collected into one official copy. After the death of Mohammed, Quran was copied on several copies and Caliph [[Uthman]] provided these copies to different cities of Islamic Empire.

The Quran mentions and reveres several of the Israelite prophets, including Moses and [[Jesus#Islamic views|Jesus]], among others (see also: [[Prophets of Islam]]). The stories of these prophets are very similar to those in the Bible. However, the detailed precepts of the Tanakh and the [[New Testament]] are not adopted outright; they are replaced by the new commandments accepted as revealed directly by God (through Gabriel) to Muhammad and codified in the Quran.

Like the Jews with the Torah, Muslims consider the original [[Arabic language|Arabic]] text of the Quran as uncorrupted and holy to the last letter, and any translations are considered to be interpretations of the meaning of the Quran, as only the original Arabic text is considered to be the divine scripture.<ref>{{Cite book| author = Baker, Mona |author2= Saldanha, Gabriela | title = Routledge encyclopedia of translation studies | publisher = Routledge | year = 2008 | page = 227 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eXsDckV5GuMC&pg=PA227 | isbn = 978-0-415-36930-5|author-link= Mona Baker }}</ref>

Like the Rabbinic [[Oral Law]] to the Hebrew Bible, the Quran is complemented by the ''[[Hadith]]'', a set of books by later authors recording the sayings of the prophet Muhammad. The Hadith interpret and elaborate Qur'anic precepts. Islamic scholars have categorized each Hadith at one of the following levels of authenticity or [[isnad]]: genuine (''sahih''), fair (''hasan'') or weak (''da'if'').<ref>{{Cite book| last = ʻUthmān ibn ʻAbd al-Raḥmān Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ al-Shahrazūrī |author2= Eerik Dickinson | title = An Introduction to the Science of Hadith: Kitab Ma'rifat Anwa' 'ilm Al-hadith | publisher = Garnet & Ithaca Press | year = 2006 | page = 5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Yq-aprUAyuUC&pg=PA5 | isbn = 978-1-85964-158-3 }}</ref>

By the 9th century, [[six major Hadith collections]] were accepted as reliable to Sunni Muslims.
* [[Sahih al-Bukhari]]
* [[Sahih Muslim]]
* [[Sunan ibn Majah]]
* [[Sunan Abu Dawud]]
* [[Jami al-Tirmidhi]]
* [[Sunan an-Nasa'ii]]

Shia Muslims, however, refer to other authenticated hadiths instead.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Momen | first = Moojan | title = An introduction to Shiʻi Islam: the history and doctrines of Twelver Shiʻism | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1985 | pages = 173–4 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zot5IK1csp0C | isbn = 978-0-300-03531-5 | access-date = 14 October 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160531015036/https://books.google.com/books?id=zot5IK1csp0C&dq | archive-date = 31 May 2016 | url-status = live }}</ref> They are known collectively as [[The Four Books]].

The Hadith and the life story of Muhammad ([[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]]) form the [[Sunnah]], an authoritative supplement to the Quran. The legal opinions of Islamic jurists ([[Faqīh]]) provide another source for the daily practice and interpretation of Islamic tradition (see [[Fiqh]].)

The Quran contains repeated references to the "religion of Abraham" (see Suras 2:130,135; 3:95; 6:123,161; 12:38; 16:123; 22:78). In the Quran, this expression refers specifically to Islam; sometimes in contrast to Christianity and Judaism, as in Sura 2:135, for example: 'They say: "Become Jews or Christians if ye would be guided (to salvation)." Say thou (O Muslims): "Nay! (I would rather) the Religion of Abraham the True, and he joined not gods with God." ' In the Quran, Abraham is declared to have been a Muslim (a ''[[hanif]]'', more accurately a "[[fitra|primordial monotheist]]"), not a Jew nor a Christian (Sura 3:67).

=== Eschatology ===
{{Main|Eschatology|Jewish eschatology|Christian eschatology|Islamic eschatology}}
In the major Abrahamic religions, there exists the expectation of an individual who will herald the [[Eschatology|time of the end]] or bring about the [[Kingdom of God]] on Earth; in other words, the [[Messianic prophecy]]. Judaism awaits the coming of the [[Jewish Messiah]]; the Jewish concept of Messiah differs from the Christian concept in several significant ways, despite the same term being applied to both. The Jewish Messiah is not seen as a "god", but as a mortal man who by his holiness is worthy of that description. His appearance is not the end of history, rather it signals the coming of the [[Jewish eschatology#Olam Haba|world to come]].

Christianity awaits the [[Second Coming]] of Christ, though [[Full Preterism|Full Preterists]] believe this has already happened. Islam awaits both the second coming of Jesus (to complete his life and die) and the coming of [[Mahdi]] (Sunnis in his first incarnation, Twelver Shia as the return of [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]]).

Most Abrahamic religions agree that a human being comprises the body, which dies, and the [[soul]], which is [[Immortality of the Soul|capable of remaining alive beyond human death]] and carries the person's essence, and that God will judge each person's life accordingly on the Day of Judgement. The importance of this and the focus on it, as well as the precise criteria and end result, differ between religions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Judaism's views on the afterlife ("the Next World") are quite diverse. This can be attributed to the fact that although there clearly are traditions in the [[Hebrew Bible]] of an afterlife (see [[Naboth]] and the [[Witch of Endor]]), Judaism focuses on this life and how to lead a holy life to please God, rather than future reward.

Christians have more diverse and definite teachings on the [[end times]] and what constitutes [[afterlife]]. Most Christian approaches either include different abodes for the dead ([[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], [[Hell]], [[Limbo]], [[Purgatory]]) or [[universal reconciliation]] because all souls are made in the [[image of God]]. A small minority teach [[annihilationism]], the doctrine that those persons who are not reconciled to God simply cease to exist.

In Islam, God is said to be "Most Compassionate and Most Merciful" (Quran 1:2, as well as the start of all Suras but one). However, God is also "Most Just"; Islam prescribes a literal [[Hell#Islam|Hell]] for those who disobey God and commit gross sin. Those who obey God and submit to God will be rewarded with their own place in Paradise. While sinners are punished with fire, there are also many other forms of punishment described, depending on the sin committed; Hell is divided into numerous levels.

Those who worship and remember God are promised eternal abode in a physical and spiritual Paradise. Heaven is divided into eight [[Jannah|levels]], with the highest level of Paradise being the reward of those who have been most virtuous, the prophets, and those killed while fighting for Allah (martyrs).

Upon repentance to God, many sins can be forgiven, on the condition they are not repeated, as God is supremely merciful. Additionally, those who believe in God, but have led sinful lives, may be punished for a time, and then eventually released into Paradise. If anyone dies in a state of [[Shirk (polytheism)|Shirk]] (i.e. associating God in any way, such as claiming that He is equal with anything or denying Him), this is not pardonable—he or she will stay forever in Hell.

Once a person is admitted to Paradise, this person will abide there for eternity.<ref>{{Cite book|last=al-Misri|first=Ahmad ibn Naqib|title=Reliance of the Traveler (edited and translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller)|publisher=Amana Publications|year=1994|pages=995–1002|isbn=978-0-915957-72-9|title-link=Nuh Ha Mim Keller}}</ref>

=== Worship and religious rites ===
{{Main|Christian worship}}
Worship, ceremonies and religion-related customs differ substantially among the Abrahamic religions. Among the few similarities are a seven-day cycle in which one day is nominally reserved for worship, prayer or other religious activities—''[[Shabbat]]'', [[Christian Sabbath|Sabbath]], or ''[[jumu'ah]]''; this custom is related to the biblical story of Genesis, where God created the universe in six days and rested in the seventh.

[[Orthodox Judaism]] practice is guided by the interpretation of the [[Torah]] and the [[Talmud]]. Before the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], Jewish priests offered [[korban|sacrifices]] there two times daily; since then, the practice has been replaced, until the Temple is rebuilt, by Jewish men being required to pray three times daily, including the [[Cantillation|chanting]] of the [[Torah]], and facing in the direction of [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Temple Mount]]. Other practices include [[Brit milah|circumcision]], [[Kashrut|dietary laws]], [[Shabbat]], [[Passover Seder|Passover]], [[Torah study]], [[Tefillin]], [[Niddah|purity]] and [[613 Mitzvot|others]]. [[Conservative Judaism]], [[Reform Judaism]] and the [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] movement all move away, in different degrees, from the strict tradition of the law.

Jewish women's prayer obligations vary by [[Jewish religious movements|denomination]]; in contemporary Orthodox practice, women do not read from the [[Torah]] and are only required to say certain parts of these daily services.

All versions of Judaism share a common, specialized calendar, containing many festivals. The calendar is lunisolar, with lunar months and a solar year (an extra month is added every second or third year to allow the shorter lunar year to "catch up" to the solar year). All streams observe the same festivals, but some emphasize them differently. As is usual with its extensive law system, the Orthodox have the most complex manner of observing the festivals, while the Reform pay more attention to the simple symbolism of each one.

Christian worship varies from [[Christian denominations|denomination to denomination]]. Individual [[Prayer in Christianity|prayer]] is usually not ritualised, while group prayer may be ritual or non-ritual according to the occasion. During church services, some form of [[liturgy]] is frequently followed. Rituals are performed during [[sacraments]], which also vary from denomination to denomination and usually include [[Baptism]] and [[Eucharist|Communion]], and may also include [[Confirmation]], [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], [[Last Rites]] and [[Holy Orders]].

Catholic worship practice is governed by  documents, including (in the largest, Western, [[Latin Church]]) the [[Roman Missal]]. Individuals, churches and denominations place different emphasis on ritual—some denominations consider most ritual activity optional (see [[Adiaphora]]), particularly since the [[Protestant Reformation]].

The followers of Islam (Muslims) are to observe the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]. The first pillar is the belief in the oneness of Allah, and in Muhammad as his final and most perfect prophet. The second is to pray five times daily ([[salat]]) towards the direction ([[qibla]]) of the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]]. The third pillar is almsgiving ([[Zakah]]), a portion of one's wealth given to the poor or to other specified causes, which means the giving of a specific share of one's wealth and savings to persons or causes, as is commanded in the Quran and elucidated as to specific percentages for different kinds of income and wealth in the [[hadith]]. The normal share to be paid is two and a half percent of one's earnings: this increases if labour was not required, and increases further if only capital or possessions alone were required (i.e. proceeds from renting space), and increases to 50% on "unearned wealth" such as treasure-finding, and to 100% on wealth that is considered [[haram]], as part of attempting to make atonement for the sin, such as that gained through financial interest ([[riba]]).

[[Fasting]] ([[sawm]]) during the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar, [[Ramadan]], is the fourth pillar of Islam, to which all Muslims after the age of puberty in good health (as judged by a Muslim doctor to be able fast without incurring grave danger to health: even in seemingly obvious situations, a "competent and upright Muslim physician" is required to agree), that are not menstruating are bound to observe—missed days of the fast for any reason must be made up, unless there be a permanent illness, such as diabetes, that prevents a person from ever fasting. In such a case, restitution must be made by feeding one poor person for each day missed.

Finally, Muslims are also required, if physically able, to undertake a [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] at least once in one's life: it is strongly recommended to do it as often as possible, preferably once a year. Only individuals whose financial position and health are severely insufficient are exempt from making Hajj (e.g. if making Hajj would put stress on one's financial situation, but would not end up in homelessness or starvation, it is still required). During this pilgrimage, the Muslims spend three to seven days in worship, performing several strictly defined rituals, most notably circumambulating the [[Kaaba]] among millions of other Muslims and the "[[stoning of the devil]]" at [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]].

At the end of the [[Hajj]], the heads of men are shaved, sheep and other [[halal]] animals, notably [[camel]]s, are slaughtered as a ritual sacrifice by bleeding out at the neck according to a strictly prescribed ritual slaughter method similar to the Jewish [[kashrut]], to commemorate the moment when, according to Islamic tradition, Allah replaced Abraham's son [[Ishmael]] (contrasted with the [[Judaeo-Christian]] tradition that [[Isaac]] was the intended sacrifice) with a sheep, thereby preventing human sacrifice. The meat from these animals is then distributed locally to needy Muslims, neighbours and relatives. Finally, the hajji puts off ''[[ihram]]'' and the hajj is complete.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

=== Circumcision ===
{{See also|Circumcision in the Bible|Brit Milah|Khatna|Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|History of male circumcision}}
Judaism commands that [[brit milah|males be circumcised]] when they are 8 days old, as does the [[Sunnah]] in [[Khitan (Circumcision)|Islam]].

[[Western Christianity]] replaced the custom of male circumcision with the ritual of [[baptism]]<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&letter=B&search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612045248/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&letter=B&search=baptism |date=12 June 2008 }}: "According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a [[proselyte]] to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab. Zarah 57a; Shab. 135a; Yer. Kid. iii. 14, 64d). Circumcision, however, was much more important, and, like baptism, was called a "seal" (Schlatter, "Die Kirche Jerusalems", 1898, p.&nbsp;70). But as circumcision was discarded by Christianity, and the sacrifices had ceased, Baptism remained the sole condition for initiation into religious life. The next ceremony, adopted shortly after the others, was the [[Laying on of hands|imposition of hands]], which, it is known, was the usage of the Jews at the ordination of a rabbi. [[Anointing]] with oil, which at first also accompanied the act of Baptism, and was analogous to the anointment of priests among the Jews, was not a necessary condition".</ref> a ceremony which varies according to the doctrine of the denomination, but it generally includes [[Baptism by immersion|immersion]], [[aspersion]], or [[anointment]] with water. The [[Early Church]] (Acts 15, the [[Council of Jerusalem]]) decided that [[Gentile Christians]] are not required to undergo circumcision.

=== Dietary restrictions ===
{{Main|kashrut|halal|ital}}
{{See also|Apostolic Decree}}
Judaism and Islam have strict [[dietary laws]], with permitted food known as [[kosher]] in Judaism, and [[halal]] in Islam. These two religions prohibit the consumption of [[pork]]; Islam prohibits the consumption of [[Alcoholic drink|alcoholic beverages]] of any kind. Halal restrictions can be seen as a modification of the [[kashrut]] dietary laws, so many kosher foods are considered halal; especially in the case of meat, which Islam prescribes must be slaughtered in the name of God. Hence, in many places, Muslims used to consume kosher food. However, some foods not considered kosher are considered halal in Islam.<ref>[http://www.soundvision.com/info/halalhealthy/halal.kosher.asp "Halal & Healthy: Is Kosher Halal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823055532/http://www.soundvision.com/info/halalhealthy/halal.kosher.asp |date=23 August 2009 }}, SoundVision.com—Islamic information & products. 5 August 2009.</ref>

With rare exceptions, Christians do not consider the Old Testament's strict food laws as relevant for today's church; see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]]. Most Protestants have no set food laws, but there are minority exceptions.<ref>Schuchmann, Jennifer.

The Roman Catholic Church believes in observing abstinence and penance. For example, all Fridays through the year and the time of Lent are penitential days.<ref>Canon 1250, 1983. The 1983 Code of Canon Law specifies the obligations of Latin Rite Catholic.</ref> The law of abstinence requires a Catholic from 14 years of age until death to abstain from eating meat on Fridays in honor of the Passion of Jesus on Good Friday. The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] obtained the permission of the Holy See for Catholics in the U.S. to substitute a penitential, or even a charitable, practice of their own choosing.<ref>[http://www.catholic.org/clife/lent/abfast.php "Fasting and Abstinence"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301194748/http://www.catholic.org/clife/lent/abfast.php |date=1 March 2009 }}, Catholic Online. 6 August 2009.</ref> [[Eastern Rite Catholics]] have their own penitential practices as specified by the Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] (SDA) embraces numerous Old Testament rules and regulations such as tithing, Sabbath observance, and Jewish food laws. Therefore, they do not eat pork, shellfish, or other foods considered unclean under the [[Old Covenant]]. The "Fundamental Beliefs" of the SDA state that their members "are to adopt the most healthful diet possible and abstain from the unclean foods identified in the Scriptures".{{Bibleref2c|Leviticus|11:1–47}} <sup>among others</sup><ref>[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html "Fundamental Beliefs"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310104717/http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html |date=10 March 2006 }}, No. 22.

In the [[Christian Bible]], the consumption of strangled animals and of [[Taboo food and drink#Blood|blood]] was forbidden by [[Apostolic Decree]]{{Bibleref2c|Acts|15:19–21}} and are still forbidden in the [[Greek Orthodox]] Church, according to German theologian [[Karl Josef von Hefele]], who, in his Commentary on Canon II of the Second Ecumenical Council held in the 4th century at Gangra, notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod [the [[Council of Jerusalem]] of Acts 15] with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the [[Greek Orthodox|Greeks]], indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show." He also writes that "as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]], in 731, forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days."<ref>Schaff, Philip.

Sabbath in the Bible is a weekly day of [[leisure|rest]] and time of [[worship]].

[[Moses Maimonides]], one of the major Jewish teachers, commented: "Quoting from our sages, the righteous people from other nations have a place in the world to come if they have acquired what they should learn about the Creator". Because the commandments applicable to the Jews are much more detailed and onerous than [[Noahide]] laws, Jewish scholars have traditionally maintained that it is better to be a good non-Jew than a bad Jew, thus discouraging conversion. In the U.S., as of 2003 28% of married Jews were married to non-Jews.<ref>Kornbluth, Doron. ''Why marry Jewish?''.

Christianity encourages [[evangelism]]. Many Christian organizations, especially Protestant churches, send [[missionary|missionaries]] to non-Christian communities throughout the world. ''See also [[Great Commission]]''. [[Forced conversion]]s to Catholicism have been alleged at various points throughout history. The most prominently cited allegations are the [[Constantine I turn against Paganism|conversions of the pagans after Constantine]]; of Muslims, Jews and Eastern Orthodox during the [[Crusades]]; of Jews and Muslims during the time of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], where they were offered the choice of exile, conversion or death; and of the Aztecs by [[Hernán Cortés]]. Forced conversions to Protestantism may have occurred as well, notably during the [[Reformation]], especially in England and Ireland (see [[recusancy]] and [[Popish plot]]).

Forced conversions are condemned as sinful by major denominations such as the Roman Catholic Church, which officially states that forced conversions pollute the Christian religion and offend human dignity, so that past or present offences are regarded as a scandal (a cause of unbelief). According to [[Pope Paul VI]], "It is one of the major tenets of Catholic doctrine that man's response to God in faith must be free: no one, therefore, is to be forced to embrace the Christian faith against his own will."<ref>Pope Paul VI.

[[Dawah]] is an important Islamic concept which denotes the preaching of Islam. Da‘wah literally means "issuing a summons" or "making an invitation". A Muslim who practices da‘wah, either as a religious worker or in a volunteer community effort, is called a dā‘ī, plural du‘āt. A dā‘ī is thus a person who invites people to understand Islam through a dialogical process and may be categorized in some cases as the Islamic equivalent of a missionary, as one who invites people to the faith, to the prayer, or to Islamic life.

Da'wah activities can take many forms. Some pursue Islamic studies specifically to perform Da'wah. [[Mosques]] and other Islamic centers sometimes spread Da'wah actively, similar to evangelical churches. Others consider being open to the public and answering questions to be Da'wah. Recalling Muslims to the faith and expanding their knowledge can also be considered Da'wah.

In [[Islamic theology]], the purpose of Da‘wah is to invite people, both Muslims and non-Muslims, to understand the commandments of God as expressed in the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet, as well as to inform them about Muhammad. Da‘wah produces converts to Islam, which in turn grows the size of the Muslim [[Ummah]], or community of Muslims.

== Dialogue between Abrahamic religions ==
{{Main|Interfaith dialogue}}
This section reports on writings and talks which describe or advocate dialogue between the Abrahamic religions.

'''Amir Hussain'''<br />
In 2003, a book called ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'' contains a chapter by [[Amir Hussain]] on "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue" which he shows how interfaith dialogue has been an integral part of Islam from its beginning. From his "first revelation" for the rest of his life, Muhammad was "engaged in interfaith dialogue." Islam would not have spread without "interfaith dialogue."<ref>Amir Hussain, "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue," in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 252–253 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).</ref>

Hussain gives an early example of "the importance of pluralism and interfaith dialogue" to Islam. When some of Muhammad's followers suffered "physical persecution" in [[Mecca]], he sent them to [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], a Christian nation, where they were "welcomed and accepted" by the Christian king. Another example is [[Córdoba, Andalusia]] in Muslim Spain, in the ninth and tenth centuries. Córdoba was "one of the most important cities in the history of the world". In "Christians and Jews were involved in the Royal Court and the intellectual life of the city." Thus, there is "a history of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and other religious traditions living together in a pluralistic society."<ref>Amir Hussain, "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue," in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 253–254 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).</ref>

Turning to the present, Hussain says that one of the challenges faced by Muslims now is the conflicting passages in the Qur̀an some of which support interfaith "bridge-building," but others can be used "justify mutual exclusion." 
<ref>Amir Hussain, "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue," in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 254 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).</ref>

'''Trialogue'''<br />
The 2007 book ''Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue'' puts the importance of interfaith dialogue starkly: "We human beings today face a stark choice: dialogue or death!"<ref>Leonard Swidler, Khalid Duran, Reuven Firestone, ''Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue'' (Twenty-Third Publications, 2007), 1, 7.</ref>
The ''Trialogue'' book gives four reasons why the three Abrahamic religions should engage in dialogue:<ref>Leonard Swidler, Khalid Duran, Reuven Firestone, ''Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue'' (Twenty-Third Publications, 2007), 38.</ref>
:1. They "come from the same Hebraic roots and claim Abraham as their originating ancestor."
:2. "All three traditions are religions of ethical monotheism."
:3. They "are all historical religions."
:4. All three are "religions of revelation."

'''Pope Benedict XVI'''<br />
In 2010, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] spoke about "Interreligious dialogue." He said that "the Church's universal nature and vocation require that she engage in dialogue with the members of other religions." For the Abrahamic religions, this "dialogue is based on the spiritual and historical bonds uniting Christians to Jews and Muslims." It is dialogue "grounded in the sacred Scriptures" and "defined in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church ''Lumen Gentium'' and in the Declaration on the Church's Relation to Non-Christian Religions ''Nostra Aetate''. The Pope concluded with a prayer: "May Jews, Christians and Muslims . . . give the beautiful witness of serenity and concord between the children of Abraham."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20120914_ecclesia-in-medio-oriente.html|title=Ecclesia in Medio Oriente: Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation on the Church in the Middle East: Communion and Witness (14 September 2012) – BENEDICT XVI|access-date=15 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022110009/http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20120914_ecclesia-in-medio-oriente.html|archive-date=22 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

'''Learned Ignorance'''<br />
In the 2011 book ''Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims'', the three editors address the question of "why engage in interreligious dialogue; its purpose?":
*[https://web.archive.org/web/20161105133544/https://dornsife.usc.edu/tools/mytools/PersonnelInfoSystem/DOC/Faculty/REL/vita_1012733.pdf James L. Heft], a Roman Catholic priest, suggests "that the purpose of interreligious dialogue is, not only better mutual understanding . . . but also trying . . . to embody the truths that we affirm."<ref>James L. Heft, Reuven Firestone, and Omid Safi, ''Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2011), 301–302.</ref>
*[[Omid Safi]], a Muslim, answers the question of "why engage in interreligious dialogue?" He writes, "because for me, as a Muslim, God is greater than any one path leading to God." Therefore, "neither I nor my traditions has a monopoly on truth, because in reality, we belong to the Truth (God), Truth to us."<ref>James L. Heft, Reuven Firestone, and Omid Safi, editors, ''Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2011), 305.</ref>
*[http://huc.edu/directory/reuven-firestone# Reuven Firestone], a Jewish Rabbi writes about the "tension" between the "particularity" of one's "own religious experience" and the "universality of the divine reality" that as expressed in history has led to verbal and violent conflict. So, although this tension may never be "fully resolved," Firestone says that "it is of utmost consequence for leaders in religion to engage in the process of dialogue."<ref>James L. Heft, Reuven Firestone, and Omid Safi, editors, ''Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2011), 308.</ref>

'''The Interfaith Amigos'''<br />
In 2011, [[TED (conference)|TED]] broadcast a 10-minute program about "Breaking the Taboos of Interfaith Dialogue" with Rabbi Ted Falcon (Jewish), Pastor Don Mackenzie (Christian), and Imam Jamal Rahman (Muslim) collectively known as [http://interfaithamigos.com/Home.html The Interfaith Amigos] See their TED program [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPnZArtsG_c by '''clicking here'''.]

'''Divisive matters should be addressed'''<br />
In 2012, a [[PhD]] thesis ''Dialogue Between Christians, Jews and Muslims'' argues that "the paramount need is for barriers against non-defensive dialogue conversations between Christians, Jews, and Muslims to be dismantled to facilitate the development of common understandings on matters that are deeply divisive." As of 2012, the thesis says that this has not been done.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://traubman.igc.org/frythesis.pdf |title=Ian Rex Fry, ''Dialogue Between Christians, Jews and Muslims'' (PhD Thesis, 2012), 37, 333.

'''Cardinal Koch'''<br />
In 2015, Cardinal [[Kurt Koch]], the President of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] and who is "responsible for the Church's dialogue with the Jewish people," was interviewed in 2015. He noted that the Church is already engaged in "bilateral talks with Jewish and Muslim religious leaders." However, he said that it is too early for "trialogue" talks among the three Abrahamic religions. Yet, Koch added, "we hope that we can go in this [direction] in future."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/05/22/cardinal_koch_trialogue_among_catholics,_jews,_muslims/1145856|title=Cardinal Koch: Trialogue among Catholics, Jews, Muslims?|access-date=15 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019004624/http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/05/22/cardinal_koch_trialogue_among_catholics,_jews,_muslims/1145856|archive-date=19 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

'''Omid Safi'''<br />
In 2016, a 26-minute interview with Professor [[Omid Safi]], a Muslim and Director of the [http://islamicstudies.duke.edu/ Duke Islamic Studies Center], was posted on YouTube.com. In it, Safi said that his life had been trying to combine "love and tenderness" which are the "essence of being human" with "social justice."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRX0XlgTvzo |title=Interview with Professor Omid Safi [Eng Subs] |author=Parmida Mostafavi |date=19 April 2016 |website=YouTube |access-date=15 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310153624/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRX0XlgTvzo |archive-date=10 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>
