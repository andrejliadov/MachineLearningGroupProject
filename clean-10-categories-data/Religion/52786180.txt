==Name==
Amamikyu's name comes from the reading of the [[Chinese characters]] 阿摩美久 or 阿摩彌姑, which were most likely written [[ad-hoc]] for the [[Okinawan language|Okinawan pronunciation]]. Readings can vary widely from Amamikyu, Amamikyo, Amamikiyo, Amamiko, Amamiku, Amamigu, Amamichuu, and Amanchuu. "Amamikyu" was used by [[George H. Kerr]] in his ''Ryukyu: Kingdom and Province Before 1945'' in 1953.<ref>Kerr, George. ''Okinawa:History of an Island People''. Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Publishing, 1958. 36.</ref>

==Creation myth==
The beginning of ''[[Chūzan Seikan]]'' details the creation of the Ryukyu Islands. The Heavenly Emperor (天帝), who lived in the Heavenly [[Gusuku]] (天城), looked down on the world and saw that there were no islands, so he ordered Amamikyu (阿摩美久) to create the Ryukyu Islands. She asked for materials to build the islands, so the Heavenly Emperor sent Shinerikyu to bring her grasses, trees, and stones. She descended to Earth on [[Kudaka Island]], and then made landfall on [[Okinawa Island]] on the spot of [[Sefa-utaki]], and later built [[Tamagusuku Castle]] and [[Chinen Castle]] and a number of communities. She asked the Heavenly Emperor for materials to make people, but the other gods would not go down to Earth. Without sexual intercourse, she became pregnant by Shinerikyu (志仁禮久, {{lang-ryu|シニリチュー}} ''shinirichuu''<ref name="okinawan"/>) and populated the islands. Some generations later, a "heavenly grandchild" named Tentei was born, who split Ryukyuan society into five classes with his three sons and two daughters: the first son was [[List of monarchs of Ryukyu Islands#Tenson Dynasty|Tenson]], who became the first King of Ryukyu; the second son became the first feudal lord ([[Anji (Ryukyu)|Aji]]); the third son became the first farmer; the first daughter became the first royal [[noro (priestess)|noro priestess]]; and the second daughter became the first village noro priestess.<ref>Glacken, Clarence. ''The Great Loochoo''. University of California Press, 1955. Pp 29-30.</ref> Her final home was located at [[Minton Castle]] in [[Tamagusuku, Okinawa]].

==Historical legacy==
Amamikyu's tomb is located on [[Hamahiga Island]] in [[Uruma, Okinawa]].<ref>http://www.nifee.net/piman/ha-rekisi.html</ref> Sefa-utaki is the holiest [[utaki]] site in the Ryukyuan religion. During the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] era, the king and [[kikoe-ōgimi]] made an annual [[pilgrimage]] to the site from [[Shuri Castle]] to worship Amamikyu, facing [[Kudaka Island]].
