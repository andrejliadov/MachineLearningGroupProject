The original version was one of dozens of works displayed as large outdoor posters in [[Jerusalem]] in 2001.<ref name=Atu2 /><ref name=Mots /><ref name=MotsLegal />

Variations of this artwork have been used as [[bumper stickers]] and elements in [[rock concert]]s.<ref name=Atu2 /><ref name=TDB />

==Creation – ''COEXISTENCE'' art exhibition==

{{Interlanguage link multi|Piotr Młodożeniec|pl}}, a Polish graphic designer based in [[Warsaw]], had his original work chosen by a [[Juried (competition)|jury]] to be one of several dozen images to be displayed as {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}} x {{convert|5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}} outdoor posters as part of a touring exhibit sponsored by the [[Museum on the Seam]] in Jerusalem.  The exhibit opened to the public in Jerusalem in 2001.<ref name=Atu2 /><ref name=Mots />

His original image consisted of the word COEXIST in all capital letters, with the C replaced by an oversized [[Crescent#Pre-Islamic and Islamic uses|Muslim Crescent]], the X replaced by an oversized [[Star of David]], and the T replaced by an oversized [[Latin Cross]].<ref name=Atu2>{{cite web|url=http://www.atu2.com/news/cant-we-all-just-coexist.html

==U2 Vertigo Tour==
[[File:U2 MexicoCity1.jpg|thumb|U2 in Mexico City on the ''Vertigo'' tour – photo taken during the playing of [[Sunday Bloody Sunday]] ]]
During the international 2005–2006 [[Vertigo Tour]] of the Irish rock band [[U2]], the original version of the image played a key role. Shortly after playing "[[Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own]]", the group would play politically-themed songs.  During the opening portion of "[[Love and Peace or Else]]", [[Bono]] wore a white headband bearing a handwritten version of the word.<ref>{{cite web|date=2015-05-28|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bonobaltimore/18007038/|others=Kurman, Mike|accessdate=2015-10-20|title=Bono, 5\28\05, Boston, MA, TD Banknorth Garden

==Bumper sticker==
The image and variations of it are used as automobile [[bumper sticker]]s.<ref name=TDB>{{cite web|work=The Daily Beast|date=2014-12-21|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/21/coexist-s-bonehead-bumper-sticker-politics.html|title=COEXIST's Bonehead Bumper-Sticker Politics: America's simplistic adoption of the COEXIST bumper sticker signals a dangerous inability to understand the roots of religious conflict.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224214154/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/21/coexist-s-bonehead-bumper-sticker-politics.html|archivedate=2014-12-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The bumper stickers first began to emerge in the United States in the early 2000s in partial response to the military involvement in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]] which began after the events of [[September 11, 2001]]. The stickers signify the capability or desire of humans to live together in peace.<ref name = "Wrasman" />

One common version of the bumper sticker spells "COEXIST" using an Islamic crescent moon for the "C", a [[peace sign]] for the "O", the Hindu Om symbol for the "E”, a [[Star of David]] for the "X", a [[pentacle]] for the dot of the "I", a [[yin-yang symbol]] for the "S", and a Christian cross for the "T".<ref name = "Wrasman">{{cite book|last=Wrasman|first=Andy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guGZAgAAQBAJ&q=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22|title=Contradict|year=2014|publisher=WestBow Press|pages=2–3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023043909/https://books.google.com/books?id=guGZAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBGoVChMIk5L4mL7MyAIVQvI-Ch2mqQEN#v=onepage&q=coexist%20%22bumper%20sticker%22&f=false|archivedate=2015-10-23|isbn=9781490819297}}</ref> This version, designed by Jerry Jaspar, is perhaps the most common version of the bumper sticker.<ref name = "Gharavi">{{cite book|editor-first=Lance|editor-last=Gharavi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wjDAgAAQBAJ&q=coexist+%22bumper+sticker%22&pg=PT289|title=Religion, Theatre, and Performance: Acts of Faith|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9781136483400}}</ref>

The prevalence of the COEXIST bumper stickers has been noted in the [[Bay Area]] region centered on [[San Francisco]]. Users of the bumper stickers are often not practicing adherents of religion.<ref name=Fish>{{cite book|last=Fish|first=M.

==Legal disputes==
In 2005, Młodożeniec and U2 were unaware of each other.  They were also unaware that a company{{who|date=December 2020}} in [[Indiana]] already filed for a trademark in the United States in 2003.  At the time, as there was no official U2 merchandise carrying this image, U2 fans created their own.  The Indiana company filed suit against companies like [[CafePress]] in May 2005 in an effort to stop sales of merchandise they had not authorized. Młodożeniec's attorneys maintained that he owned the copyright to the image.  Separately, The Museum on the Seam, which sponsored the competition in which the original image first appeared in public, claimed legal rights to the image.<ref name=Atu2 /><ref name=MotsLegal />

==Versions and other variations==
The following table shows the individual characters of the more well-known versions, either as [[Unicode]] characters, icons, or descriptions.

<!-- Editor instructions:
* Only add it to this table if it spells out Coexist,
  not other variants, spoofs, etc.  Variants in
  capitalization such as COEXIST are fine.  Translations are fine.
* Only add it if you have a reliable source that the
  image is in wide use.
  This can be a newspaper article, a legal proceeding, or,
  IF the image in question has been released under a "free" license
  by its creator, a link to a copy of the image uploaded to the Wikimedia Commons
  Put the source or a small version of the Commons image in the "notes" section.
* Only add it if it's in wide use – be aware that some versions may be "novelty"
  items created for a specific event and adding them here would likely clutter up
  the list or worse, invite the creators to "spam" this page for promotional purposes.
* A partial table of unicode symbols can be found at
  http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/So/list.htm
  and many other places on the Internet
* PREVIEW YOUR CHANGES BEFORE SAVING YOUR EDIT – it's really easy
  to mess up a table if you are not careful.
* Double-check that any "Note" links work in both directions.

==Parodies==

There are several parodies, spelling out words such as 'Toxic', 'Fiction', 'Contradict', 'Atheist' and, 'Heathen'. There is also an anti-Islamic version with the image of the crescent altered with the addition of explosives.<ref name = "Gharavi" />

Other parodies include a Communist [[hammer and sickle]] for the "E" and a [[swastika]] for the "X", indicating the dangers inherent in totalitarian ideologies,<ref name=Bowen>{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=Jack|url=https://archive.org/details/ifyoucanreadthis00bowe|url-access=registration|quote=coexist bumper sticker.|title=If You Can Read This: The Philosophy of Bumper Stickers|publisher=Random House|year=2010|page=[https://archive.org/details/ifyoucanreadthis00bowe/page/193 193]|isbn=9781588369505}}</ref> and weapon-related versions.
