Weixinism is a [[Chinese salvationist religion]].]]

In the study of [[comparative religion]], the '''East Asian religions''' or '''Taoic religions''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taoic.org/|title=taioc.org}}</ref> form a subset of the [[Eastern religions]]. This group includes Chinese religion overall, which further includes [[Ancestor veneration in China|Ancestral Worship]], [[Chinese folk religion]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and so-called [[Chinese salvationist religions|popular salvationist organisations]] (such as [[Yiguandao]] and [[Weixinism]]), as well as elements drawn from [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]] that form the core of [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[East Asian Buddhism]] at large. The group also includes Japanese [[Shintoism]] and Korean [[Korean shamanism|Sindoism]] (both meaning "Ways of Gods" and identifying the indigenous shamanic religion and ancestor worship of such peoples), which have received influences from Chinese religions throughout the centuries. Chinese salvationist religions have influenced the rise of Korean and [[Japanese new religions]]—for instance, respectively, [[Jeungsanism]] and [[Tenrikyo|Tenriism]]; these movements draw upon indigenous traditions but are heavily influenced by [[Chinese philosophy]] and [[Chinese theology|theology]].

All these religious traditions, more or less, share core Chinese concepts of spirituality, divinity and world order, including [[Tao]], [[:wikt:道|道]] ("Way", Pinyin ''dào'', Japanese ''tō'' or ''dō'' and Korean ''do'') and [[Tian]], [[:wikt:天|天]] ("Heaven", Japanese ''ten'' and Korean ''cheon'').

Early Chinese philosophies defined the Tao and advocated cultivating the ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'', "virtue", which arises from the knowledge of such Tao.<ref>Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. ''Taoism and Chinese Religion''. pg 32. University of Massachusetts, 1981.</ref> Some ancient schools merged into traditions with different names or became extinct, such as [[Mohism]] (and many others of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]), which was largely absorbed into Taoism. East Asian religions include many theological stances, including [[polytheism]], [[nontheism]], [[henotheism]], [[monotheism]], [[pantheism]], [[panentheism]] and [[agnosticism]].<ref>{{cite book|title=中央研究院國際漢學會議論文集: 藝術史組|page=141|publisher=該院|year=1981|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RIxCAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> East Asian religions have many Western adherents, though their interpretations may differ significantly from traditional East Asian religious thought and culture.

The place of Taoic religions among [[major religious groups]] is comparable to the [[Abrahamic religion]]s found in Europe and the Western World as well as across the Middle East and the Muslim World and [[Indian religions|Dharmic religions]] across [[South Asia]].<ref>Sharot, Stephen.

==Terminology==
Despite a wide variety of terms, the traditions described as "Far Eastern religions", "East Asian religions" or "Chinese religions" are recognised by scholars as a distinct religious family.<ref>de Groot, J. J. M. ''Religion in China: Universism a Key to the Study of Taoism and Confucianism''. Pp 45–46. Kessinger Publishing. 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-4658-X}}.</ref><ref>James, Edwin Olver. ''The Comparative Study of Religions of the East (excluding Christianity and Judaism).'' Pg 5. University of Michigan Press. 1959.</ref>

[[Syncretism]] is a common feature of East Asian religions, often making it difficult to recognise individual faiths.<ref>Ito, Satoshi. Translated by [[John Breen (scholar)|Breen, John]] and [[Mark Teeuwen]]. ''Shinto – A Short History''. Pg 9.  Routledge. 2003. {{ISBN|0-415-31179-9}}</ref><ref>Fisher, Mary Pat. Living Religions: An Encyclopaedia of the World's Faiths. Pg 164. I.B. Tauris. 1997. {{ISBN|1-86064-148-2}}.</ref> Further complications arise from the inconsistent use of many terms. "Tao religion" is often used for Taoism itself,<ref>Vrijhof, Pieter Hendrik & Waardenburg, Jean Jacques. ''Official and Popular Religion: Analysis of a Theme for Religious Studies''. Pg 419. Walter de Gruyter. 1979. {{ISBN|90-279-7998-7}}.</ref> as well as being used for many Tao-based new religious movements.<ref>Beversluis, Joel Diederik.

==The Tao and its virtue==
{{Main|Tao|De (Chinese)}}
The Tao may be roughly defined as the flow of reality, of the universe, or the force behind the natural order.<ref>Cane, Eulalio Paul. ''Harmony: Radical Taoism Gently Applied''. Pg 13. Trafford Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|1-4122-4778-0}}.</ref> Believed to be the influence that keeps the universe balanced and ordered, the Tao is associated with nature, due to a belief that nature demonstrates the Tao.<ref>Martinson, Paul Varo ''A theology of world religions: Interpreting God, self, and world in Semitic, Indian, and Chinese thought''. Pp 168–169. Augsburg Publishing House. 1987. {{ISBN|0-8066-2253-9}}.</ref> Similar to the [[negative theology]] of Western scholars, the Tao is compared to what it is not.<ref>This concept of being unable to accurately describe the Tao is common among East Asian religions and Taoist writings. For example, "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao; The name that can be named is not the eternal name"; first lines of the ''Tao Te Ching''.</ref> It is often considered to be the source of both existence and non-existence.<ref>See ''[[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]]'' and ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]'' for more information about "non-existence" and "existence" in East Asian religious thought.</ref>

The Tao is often associated with a "virtue" of being, the ''de'' or ''te''. This is considered the active expression of Tao.<ref>Sharot, Stephen. ''A Comparative Sociology of World Religions: virtuosos, priests, and popular religion''. Pp 77–78, 88. New York: NYU Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8147-9805-5}}.</ref> Generally, those religions closer to Taoism explain ''de'' as "integrity" or "wholeness", while those faiths closer to Confucianism express this concept as "morality" or "sound character".<ref>Yao, Xinzhong. ''An Introduction to Confucianism''. Pp 155–156. Cambridge University Press. 2000. {{ISBN|0-521-64430-5}}.</ref>

==Religions==
===Taoism===

{{Main|Taoism}}
Taoism consists of a wide variety of religious, philosophical and ritual orders. There are [[hermeneutic]] (interpretive) difficulties in the categorisation of Taoist schools, sects and movements.<ref>Mair (2001) p. 174</ref>

Taoism does not fall strictly under an umbrella or a definition of an [[organised religion]] like the [[Abrahamic traditions]], nor can it purely be studied as a variant of [[Chinese folk religion]], as much of the traditional religion is outside of the tenets and core teachings of Taoism. Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a way of life than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done.<ref>Robinet (1997), pp. 3–4, 103.</ref>

In general, Taoist propriety and ethics place an emphasis on the unity of the universe, the unity of the material world and the spiritual world, the unity of the past, present and future, as well as on the [[Three Jewels of the Tao]] (love, moderation, humility).<ref>Leaman, Oliver. ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy ''. Pg 111. Routledge, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-17362-0}}.</ref> Taoist theology focuses on doctrines of [[wu wei]] ("non-action"), spontaneity, relativity and emptiness.<ref>Slingerland, Edward Gilman. ''Effortless Action: Wu-Wei as Conceptual Metaphor and Spiritual Ideal in Early China''. Oxford University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-19-513899-6}}.</ref><ref>Sharot, Stephen. ''A Comparative Sociology of World Religions: virtuosos, priests, and popular religion''. Pg 78. New York: NYU Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8147-9805-5}}.</ref>

Traditional Chinese Taoist schools accept polytheism, but there are differences in the composition of their pantheon.<ref>Segal, Robert Alan. ''The Blackwell Companion to the Study of Religion''. Pg 50. Blackwell Publishing. 2006. {{ISBN|0-631-23216-8}}.</ref> On the popular level, Taoism typically presents the [[Jade Emperor]] as the head [[deity]]. Professionalised Taoism (i.e. priestly orders) usually presents Laozi and the [[Three Pure Ones]] at the top of the pantheon.<ref>Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. ''Taoism and Chinese Religion''. pg 41. University of Massachusetts, 1981.</ref>

Worship of nature deities and ancestors is common in popular Taoism, while professional Taoists put an emphasis on [[internal alchemy]]. The Tao is never an object of worship, being treated more like the Indian concept of [[Atman (Buddhism)|atman]].<ref>LaFargue, Michael. ''Tao and Method: A Reasoned Approach to the Tao Te Ching''. Pg 283. SUNY Press. 1994. {{ISBN|0-7914-1601-1}}</ref>

===Confucianism===
{{Main|Confucianism}}
[[File:柳州市孔庙 Temple of Confucius in Liuzhou, Guangxi.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of Confucius]] in [[Liuzhou]], [[Guangxi]].]]
Confucianism is a complex system of moral, social, political, and religious thought, influential in the history of East Asia. It is commonly associated with [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]], but actually rejects legalism for [[ritualism]].<ref>Yao, Xinzhong. ''An Introduction to Confucianism''. pp 191–192.  Cambridge University
Press. 2000. {{ISBN|0-521-64430-5}}</ref> It also endorses [[meritocracy]] as the ideal of [[nobility]].<ref>Smart, Ninian. ''World Philosophies''. Pp 66. Routledge (UK). 2000. {{ISBN|0-415-22852-2}}.</ref> Confucianism includes a complicated system governing duties and etiquette in relationships. Confucian ethics focus on familial duty, loyalty and humaneness.<ref>De Bary, William Theodore & Tu, Weiming. ''Confucianism and Human Rights''. Pg 149. Columbia University Press. 1998. {{ISBN|0-231-10936-9}}.</ref>

Confucianism recognises the existence of ancestral spirits and deities, advocating paying them proper respect.<ref>Sharot, Stephen. ''A Comparative Sociology of World Religions: virtuosos, priests, and popular religion''. Pp 46, 85. New York: NYU Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8147-9805-5}}.</ref> Confucian thought is notable as the framework upon which the syncretic [[Neo-Confucianism]] was built.<ref>Huang, Siu-chi. ''Essentials of Neo-Confucianism: Eight Major Philosophers of the Song and Ming Periods''. Pg 5. Greenwood Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-313-26449-X}}.</ref>

[[Neo-Confucianism]] was developed in reaction to Taoism and Chan Buddhism. It was formulated during the [[Song dynasty]], but its roots may be traced to scholars of the [[Tang dynasty]]. It draw Buddhist religious concepts and Taoist [[yin yang]] theory, as well as the ''[[Yijing]]'', and placed them within the framework of classic Confucianism.<ref>Huang, Siu-chi. ''Essentials of Neo-Confucianism: Eight Major Philosophers of the Song and Ming Periods''. Pp 11–12, 63–64, 106. Greenwood Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-313-26449-X}}.</ref>

Despite Neo-Confucianism's incorporation of elements of Buddhism and Taoism, its apologists still decried both faiths.<ref>Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. ''Taoism and Chinese Religion''. pg 52–53. University of Massachusetts, 1981.</ref> Neo-Confucianism was an officially endorsed faith for over five centuries, deeply influencing all of East Asia.<ref>Flew, Antony G. ''A Dictionary of Philosophy''. Pg 62. St. Martin's Griffin. 1984. {{ISBN|0-312-20923-1}}.</ref>

[[New Confucianism]] is a [[modernist]] Confucianism, which accommodates modern science and democratic ideals, while remaining conservative in preserving traditional Neo-Confucianist positions. The influence of New Confucianism prompted since [[Deng Xiaoping]] became the leader of China in 1978 and helped cultural exchanges between China and Taiwan.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Renaissance of Confucianism in Contemporary China |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|author=Ruiping Fan|year=2011|isbn=9789400715424|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TflW14YLLxUC}}</ref>

===Shintoism===
[[File:Plum trees Kitano Tenmangu.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Two women praying in front of a Japanese Shinto shrine.]]
{{Main|Shintoism}}

Shintoism is the [[ethnic religion]] of Japan. Shinto literally means "Way of the Gods". Shinto practitioners commonly affirm tradition, family, nature, cleanliness and ritual observation as core values.<ref>Ono, Sakyo. ''Shinto: The Kami Way''. Pp 97–99, 103–104. Tuttle Publishing. 2004. {{ISBN|0-8048-3557-8}}</ref>

Taoist influence is significant in their beliefs about nature and self-mastery. [[Ritual cleanliness]] is a central part of Shinto life.<ref>Ono, Sakyo. ''Shinto: The Kami Way''. Pp 51–52, 108. Tuttle Publishing. 2004. {{ISBN|0-8048-3557-8}}</ref> [[Shinto shrine|Shrines]] have a significant place in Shinto, being places for the veneration of the ''[[kami]]'' (gods or spirits).<ref>Markham, Ian S. & Ruparell, Tinu . ''Encountering Religion: an introduction to the religions of the world''. pp 304–306 Blackwell Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|0-631-20674-4}}.</ref> "Folk", or "popular", Shinto features an emphasis on shamanism, particularly [[divination]], [[spirit possession]] and [[faith healing]]. "Sect" Shinto is a diverse group including mountain-worshippers and Confucian Shinto schools.<ref>Ono, Sakyo. ''Shinto: The Kami Way''. Pg 12. Tuttle Publishing. 2004. {{ISBN|0-8048-3557-8}}</ref>

==Taoism and Confucianism==
The concepts of Tao and ''de'' are shared by both Taoism and Confucianism.<ref>Markham, Ian S. & Ruparell, Tinu. ''Encountering Religion: an introduction to the religions of the world''. Pg 254. Blackwell Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|0-631-20674-4}}.</ref> The authorship of the [[Tao Te Ching]], the central book of Taoism, is assigned to [[Laozi]], who is traditionally held to have been a teacher of Confucius.<ref>Hansen, Chad D. ''A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought: A Philosophical Interpretation''. Pp 202, 210. Oxford University Press. 2000. {{ISBN|0-19-513419-2}}.</ref> However, some scholars believe that the Tao Te Ching arose as a reaction to Confucianism.<ref>Fisher, Mary Pat. ''Living Religions: An Encyclopaedia of the World's Faiths''. Pg 167. I.B. Tauris. 1997. {{ISBN|1-86064-148-2}}.</ref> [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], reacting to the Confucian-[[Mohist]] ethical disputes casts Laozi as a prior step to the Mohists by name and the Confucians by implication. However, secular scholars usually consider Laozi and Zhuangzi to have been [[myth]]ological figures.<ref>Boltz, William G. "Lao tzu Tao te ching." ''Early Chinese Texts: A Bibliographical Guide'', edited by Michael Loewe. pg 270. Berkeley: University of California, Institute of East Asian Studies. 1993. (Laozi)</ref><ref>Birrell, Anne. ''Chinese Myths''. Pp 16–17. University of Texas Press. 2000. {{ISBN|0-292-70879-3}}. (Zhuangzi)</ref>

Early Taoist texts reject Confucian emphasis on rituals and order, in favour of an emphasis on "wild" nature and individualism. Historical Taoists challenged conventional morality, while Confucians considered society debased and in need of strong ethical guidance.<ref>Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. ''Taoism and Chinese Religion''. pg 39. University of Massachusetts, 1981.</ref>

==Interaction with Indian and South Asian religions==
{{Main|East Asian Buddhism}}
[[Image:Confucius Laozi Buddha.jpg|right|thumb|160px|A painting of Confucius presenting a young Buddha to Laozi.]]
The entry of [[Buddhism]] into China from India was marked by interaction and [[syncretism]] with Taoism in particular.<ref>Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. ''Taoism and Chinese Religion''. pg 46. University of Massachusetts, 1981.</ref> Originally seen as a kind of "foreign Taoism", Buddhism's scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary.<ref name="Prebish, Charles Pg 192">Prebish, Charles. ''Buddhism: A Modern Perspective.'' Pg 192. Penn State Press, 1975. {{ISBN|0-271-01195-5}}.</ref> Chan Buddhism was particularly modelled after Taoism, integrating distrust of scripture, text and even language, as well as the Taoist views of embracing "this life", dedicated practice and the "every-moment".<ref>Dumoulin, Heinrich, Heisig, James W. & Knitter, Paul. ''Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China)''. Pp 68, 70–73, 167–168. World Wisdom, Inc, 2005. {{ISBN|0-941532-89-5}}.</ref> In the [[Tang period]] Taoism incorporated such Buddhist elements as monasteries, vegetarianism, prohibition of alcohol, the doctrine of emptiness, and collecting scripture into tripartite organisation. During the same time, Chan Buddhism grew to become the largest sect in Chinese Buddhism.<ref>Dumoulin, Heinrich, Heisig, James W. & Knitter, Paul. ''Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China)''. Pp 166–167, 169–172. World Wisdom, Inc, 2005. {{ISBN|0-941532-89-5}}.</ref>

The Buddha's "[[Dharma]]" seemed alien and amoral to conservative and Confucian sensibilities.<ref>Dumoulin, Heinrich, Heisig, James W. & Knitter, Paul. ''Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China)''. Pp 189–190, 268–269. World Wisdom, Inc, 2005. {{ISBN|0-941532-89-5}}.</ref> Confucianism promoted social stability, order, strong families, and practical living, and Chinese officials questioned how monastic lifestyle and personal attainment of enlightenment benefited the empire.<ref name="Prebish, Charles Pg 192"/> However, Buddhism and Confucianism eventually reconciled after centuries of conflict and assimilation.<ref name="Moore, Charles Alexander Pp 133, 147">Moore, Charles Alexander. ''The Chinese Mind: Essentials of Chinese Philosophy and Culture''. Pp 133, 147. University of Hawaii Press. 1967. {{ISBN|0-8248-0075-3}}.</ref>

Ideological and political rivals for centuries, Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism deeply influenced one another.<ref>Markham, Ian S. & Ruparell, Tinu . ''Encountering Religion: an introduction to the religions of the world''. pp 248–249. Blackwell Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|0-631-20674-4}}.</ref> They did share some similar values. All three embraced a [[humanism|humanist]] philosophy emphasising moral behavior and human perfection. In time, most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously.<ref name="window">[http://www.asia.msu.edu/eastasia/China/religion.html Windows on Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220182953/http://www.asia.msu.edu/eastasia/China/religion.html |date=2009-02-20 }} Asian Studies Center, Michigan State University.</ref> This became institutionalised when aspects of the three schools were synthesised in the Neo-Confucian school.<ref name="Moore, Charles Alexander Pp 133, 147"/>
