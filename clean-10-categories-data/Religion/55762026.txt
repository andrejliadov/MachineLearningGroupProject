'''Christianity and Theosophy''', for more than a hundred years, have had a "complex and sometimes troubled" relationship.{{sfn|Ellwood}} The [[Christianity|Christian]] faith was the native religion of the great majority of Western [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]], but many came to Theosophy through a process of opposition to Christianity. According to professor [[Robert S. Ellwood]], "the whole matter has been a divisive issue within Theosophy."{{sfn|Ellwood}}{{refn|group=note|Gregory Tillett, a religious studies scholar, claimed in his dissertation, "The relationship of Theosophy to Christianity was never straightforward."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=991}}}}

=== God ===
According to the Theosophical spiritual [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Teachers]],{{refn|group=note|[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]] wrote that "the very concept of the Masters" is the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] idea of "invisible and secret adepts, working for the advancement of humanity."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=6}} And Tillett stated: "The concept of Masters or Mahatmas as presented by [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] involved a mixture of western and eastern ideas; she located most of them in India or Tibet. Both she and Colonel Olcott claimed to have seen and to be in communication with Masters. In Western [[occultism]] the idea of 'Supermen' has been found in such schools as... the fraternities established by [[Martinez de Pasqually|de Pasqually]] and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin|de Saint-Martin]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=966}}}} neither their philosophy nor themselves believe in a [[God in Christianity|God]], "least of all in one whose pronoun necessitates a capital H."{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=52|Дружинин|2012|2p=42}}

A [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox cleric]] and theologian Dimitry Drujinin cited the Theosophical Master [[Kuthumi]]:{{quote|"We know there is in our [solar] system no such thing as God, either personal or impersonal. [[Para Brahman|Parabrahm]] is not a God, but absolute immutable law... The word 'God' was invented to designate the unknown cause of those effects which man has either admired or dreaded without understanding them."{{sfnm|Barker|1924|1p=52|Дружинин|2012|2pp=42, 45}}}}

A religious studies scholar [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn|Alvin Kuhn]] wrote that Theosophist [[Annie Besant]] believed:{{quote|"God is a composite photograph of the innumerable [[gods]] who are the personifications of the forces of nature... It is all summed up in the phrase: Religions are branches from a common trunk—human ignorance."{{sfnm|Besant|1902|1p=8|Kuhn|1992|2p=145}}}}

In addition the Master Kuthumi said,{{quote|"In our [Tibetan] temples there is neither a god nor gods worshipped, only the thrice sacred memory of the greatest as the holiest [[Gautama Buddha|''man'']] that ever lived."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 10}}

An American author [[Gary Lachman]], noting Blavatsky's "animus toward the Judeo-Christian ethos," cited her article in which she wrote that the Bible is not the "word of God" but contains at best the "words of fallible men and imperfect teachers."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960a|1p=176|Lachman|2012|2p=112}}

In ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' Helena Blavatsky stated that "an ''extra''-cosmic god is fatal to philosophy, an ''intra''-cosmic Deity — ''i.e.'' [[Spirit]] and matter inseparable from each other — is a philosophical necessity. Separate them and that which is left is a gross superstition under a mask of emotionalism."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888b|p=41}}{{sfn|Ellwood}} Professor Santucci wrote that she has defined the Supreme in the Proem to ''The Secret Doctrine'' as an "Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and Immutable '''[[Para Brahman|Principle]]''' on which all speculation is impossible, since it transcends the power of human conception and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or similitude."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888a|1p=14|Kuhn|1992|2p=199|Santucci|2012|3pp=234–235}} John Driscoll, a theologian and author of ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]],'' wrote in 1912 that Theosophy denies a [[personal god]], and this "nullifies its claim to be a spiritualistic philosophy."{{sfn|Driscoll|1912|p=628}}{{refn|group=note|Blavatsky was refusing to accept God as the personality.{{sfn|Кураев|2002}}}} Blavatsky proclaimed that the Theosophists believe "in the Deity as the '''All''', the source of all existence, the infinite that cannot be either comprehended or known, the universe alone revealing ''It,'' or, as some prefer it, Him, thus giving a sex to that, to anthropomorphize which is ''blasphemy''."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1967a|1p=91|Movement|1951|2p=72}}

Professor Mary Bednarowski wrote that Theosophists "see the [[Absolute (philosophy)|One]] as the cause of the universe," but not as its creator. When asked who it is that created the universe, Blavatsky responded that, "No one creates it. Science would call the process evolution; the pre-Christian philosophers and the Orientalists call it emanation; we, [[Occult]]ists and Theosophists, see in it only the universal and eternal ''reality'' casting a reflection of ''itself'' on the infinite Spatial depths."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=84|Bednarowski|1989|2p=36}} A Russian Christian philosopher [[Nikolai Berdyaev]] wrote that in the Theosophical books "the name of God is not mentioned."{{sfn|Berdyaev|1972|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|Theologian Drujinin wrote that Berdyaev noted, "In the contemporary Theosophy it is difficult to find a teaching about God."{{sfn|Berdyaev}}{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=41}}}} 

{{sfn|Соловьёв|1911|p=397}}{{refn|group=note|According to professor [[Wouter J. Hanegraaff|Hanegraaff]], Blavatskian Theosophy is "an example of [[Comparative Religion]] on occultist premises, developed with the express intention of undermining established Christianity."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1998|p=443}}}}

=== Jesus ===

According to Blavatsky, Jesus was the grand "philosopher and moral reformer."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=150|Purucker|1998|2p=1}} She considered Jesus as "The Great Teacher," an [[Avatar]] with healing and demon-exorcising abilities. An American author Joseph H. Tyson stated, "She did not view him as The Second Person of the [[Blessed Trinity]], but a [[Brahmin|Brahman]] Perfect [[Master Jesus|Master]]" with [[clairvoyance]], [[siddhi|supernatural powers]], and "fakir-like unconcern for the morrow."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=553|Tyson|2006|2p=213}} In Blavatsky's opinion, "Jesus, the Christ-God, is a myth concocted two centuries after the real Hebrew Jesus died."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=544|Сенкевич|2012|2p=298}} According to Theosophy, term "Christ" means the personal divinity "indwelling" each individual human.{{sfn|Campbell|1980|p=3}} An author of the journal of Christian theology ''[[Quodlibet (journal)|Quodlibet]]''

In December 1887 Blavatsky printed an open letter to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the Lord Primate of England. This editorial letter gave proof to show that "in almost every point the doctrines of the churches and the practices of Christians are ''in direct opposition to the teachings of Jesus.''"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1960b|1p=270|Movement|1951|2p=131|Крэнстон|1999|3p=408}} She always opposed those who understood Jesus' teaching literally.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1960a|p=208}}{{refn|group=note|Professor Williams wrote that one should not understand literally the words of Jesus, "I am [[Via et veritas et vita|the Way, the Truth, and the Life]]." ([[John 14]].6) He speaks here, not as a historical character, but as "the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|divine light]], the light presumably known to all the wise sages of every age."{{sfn|Williams|2001}}}} Her representation of Jesus as similar of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] "grated on Christian nerves."{{sfn|Tyson|2006|p=210}}{{refn|group=note|[[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa]] wrote that Mahachohan, the great [[mahatma|Adept]], wrote that the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|seventh principle]] of man is being named some as Christ, others as Buddha.{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|1919|p=7}}}}

=== Prayer ===
Drujinin wrote that to the question, "Do you believe in [[prayer]], and do you ever pray?" Blavatsky answered: "We do not. We ''act,'' instead of ''talking.'' <...> The visible universe depends for its existence and phenomena on its mutually acting forms and their laws, not on prayer or prayers."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=66|Дружинин|2012|2p=122}} Blavatsky "rules out the propriety of prayer, except in the sense of an internal command."{{sfn|Sheldon|1916|p=49}} She said, "We call our 'Father in heaven' that deific essence of which we are cognizant within us."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1889|p=67}} According to Bednarowski, in Blavatsky's opinion, prayer kills "self-reliance" and "refutes the Theosophical understanding of divine immanence." She stated, "We try to replace fruitless and useless prayer by meritorious and good-producing action."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=70|Bednarowski|1989|2p=66}}

Berdyaev wrote that the experience of "prayerful communication" with God, revealed to man by the Christian church, is not recognized by the Theosophical teaching. Prayer in Theosophy is only "one of the others forms of meditation."{{sfn|Бердяев|1994|p=185}}

=== Сondition after death ===
Bednarowski wrote that Blavatsky objected to the Christian interpretations afterlife "because they are described as eternal." She stated that, "nothing is eternal and unchangeable."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=112|Bednarowski|1989|2p=92}} She said, "We believe in no hell or paradise as localities; in no objective hell-fires and worms that never die, nor in any Jerusalems with streets paved with sapphires and diamonds."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=138|Bednarowski|1989|2p=92}} [[René Guénon]] wrote that on the Theosophical "heaven" the condition of man  is such:
<blockquote>"As to the ordinary mortal, his bliss in it is complete. It is an absolute oblivion of all that gave it pain or sorrow in the past incarnation, and even oblivion of the fact that such things as pain or sorrow exist at all."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=148|Guénon|2004|2p=114}}</blockquote>

=== Karma and reincarnation ===
According to ''The Catholic Encyclopedia,'' the main Theosophical teachings are [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]]. Karma is the law of ethical causation. {{quote|In the past incarnation the ego had acquired certain faculties, set in motion certain causes. The effect of these causes and of causes set in motion in previous incarnations and not yet exhausted are its karma and determine the conditions into which the ego is reborn.{{sfn|Driscoll|1912|p=628}}}}

Reincarnation is directly related to karma. James Skeen stated that the Theosophical teaching about karma and "its relation to forgiveness and faith" contradicts the Bible definitions of these important concepts.{{sfn|Skeen|2002}} ''Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs'' argues that the laws of karma and reincarnation "are really a doctrine of self salvation." And consequently there is no need for "Jesus Christ's substitutionary death for our sins," when the person, who offends, pays himself.{{sfn|Strohmer|1996}}{{refn|group=note|The [[Mahatma|Master]] [[Kuthumi]] wrote, "Though we may not say with the Christians, 'return good for evil' — we repeat with [[Confucius]] — 'return good for good; for evil — ''justice''.'"{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 85}}}}{{refn|group=note|Berdyaev stated that "Christianity is a religion of love, and not a religion of justice," therefore, for a true Christian, the law of karma is abolished.{{sfn|Бердяев|1994|p=185}} Opposed to the Christian doctrines of [[Redeemer (Christianity)|redemption]] and punishment, Theosophy offers no remission for evil except "through myriads of reincarnations."{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=287}} Theosophy offers no "living redeemer, no freedom from the power of sin."{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=296}}}}

Blavatsky and other Theosophists believed that karma, the "unerring law of Retribution," is a system of penalty "as stern as that of the most rigid [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], only far more philosophical and consistent with absolute justice."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1889|1p=140|Bednarowski|1989|2p=92}} Ellwood wrote that, according to Blavatsky, "Karma is an Absolute and Eternal law in the World of manifestation." Karma is the "impersonal force" which brings retribution for thoughts, words, and deeds of men without "destroy intellectual and individual liberty" in order to demonstrate that men must live with the consequences of their choices.{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=305|Ellwood|2014a|2p=153}} A religious studies scholar Jeffrey D. Lavoie noted that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the [[soul]] "must purify itself through [[reincarnation|cyclic transmigrations]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=280|Lavoie|2012|2p=186}} Ellwood has quoted in ''The Secret Doctrine:''
<blockquote>"Intimately, or rather indissolubly, connected with Karma, then, is the law of re-birth, or of the re-incarnation of the same spiritual individuality in a long, almost interminable, series of personalities. The latter are like the various costumes and characters played by the same actor."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=306|Ellwood|2014a|2p=153}}</blockquote>

Drujinin stated that the concept of reincarnation fundamentally contradicts the most important [[dogma]]s of [[Orthodox Christianity]]. Moreover, he stated that there are good reasons to believe that the concept of reincarnation, bringed in Theosophy, was entered "by the inspiring it dark spiritual forces" for the preparation of an appearance of [[Antichrist]].{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|pp=106, 107}} He wrote that the Theosophical doctrine of reincarnation denies the tragedy of death and glorifies it as a positive moment of the cosmic evolution. Depreciating "death, this doctrine thereby devalues life and reconciles man with any suffering and injustice."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=103}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, a Russian Christian philosopher [[Nikolay Lossky]] believed that "doctrine of reincarnation" is not contradicting Christian teaching.{{sfnm|Лосский|1992|1p=133|Aliaiev, Kutsepal|2018|2p=159}}}}

== Accusations ==
=== Fraud ===
{{See also|Coulomb Affair}}
In September 1884 the Rev. George Patterson, a principal of [[Madras Christian College]], wrote about Blavatsky's occult [[paranormal|phenomena]]: "What if these signs and wonders are proofs of something very different?... Instead of a message from [[mahatma|beings of supernal wisdom and power]], we shall have only the private thoughts of a clever but not over scrupulous woman."{{sfn|Patterson|1884|p=200}}{{sfn|Melton|2014|p=132}} The anti-Theosophical publications in ''The Madras Christian College Magazine'' in September 1884 were made by the time of arrival of [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]], an expert of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], aimed at studying the phenomena of Blavatsky.{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=25}} The Committee of SPR, after analyzing and discussing Hodgson's research, came with reference to Blavatsky herself to the following conclusion published in December 1885: "For our own part, we regard her neither as the mouthpiece of hidden seers, nor as a mere vulgar adventuress; we think that she has achieved a title to permanent remembrance as one of the most accomplished, ingenious, and interesting impostors in history."{{sfnm|Hodgson|1885b|1p=207|Дружинин|2012|2p=25}} According to the Rev. George Patterson, "It is to these phenomena, and to the openly expressed antagonism of Theosophy to Christianity, that the rapid spread of the new cult in India is to be ascribed, and not to any system of positive doctrine."{{sfn|Patterson|1891}}{{refn|group=note|Washington wrote that Patterson, "Blavatsky's bitter enemy", hated Theosophy for its anti-Christian and anti-European orientation.{{sfn|Washington|1995|p=82}}}}

=== Spirit communication ===
{{See also|Incidents in the Life of Madame Blavatsky#Mediums and mediumship}}
Theologian Kuraev wrote that Theosophists' feature is [[spirit possession]]. If the usual scientific or philosophical book appears as a result of systematic and consistent reflections of its author, then the theosophical treatises are written as a "dictation of capricious spirits." A person-medium does not have power over the text that is "communicated" to him, he is not fully competent in its planning and word processing.{{sfn|Кураев|2000|p=39}}{{refn|group=note|In [[Alexander Senkevich|Senkevich's]] opinion, ''The Secret Doctrine'' was created under dictation of the Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] by the method of [[automatic writing]].{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=427}}}} In Drujinin's opinion, Theosophy preaches "reckless" communication with spirits. And the spirits who presented themselves as "teachers-mahatmas" can expel the disciple in general from his body. In confirmation, he quoted [[Ignatius Bryanchaninov]]: "The desire to see spirits, curiosity to learn something from them is a sign of the greatest folly and complete ignorance of the moral and active traditions of the Orthodox Church."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=144}} Theologian Martin noted that the Bible prohibits to practice a communication with spirits.{{sfn|Martin|2003|p=263}} Nevertheless, in 1860 at Zadonsk, [[:ru:Исидор (Никольский)|Isidore]], the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of the Russian Orthodox Church, seeing the manifestations of Blavatsky's [[mediumship]], said: "Let not your heart be troubled by the gift you are possessed of, nor let it become a source of misery to you hereafter."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1913|1p=108|Крэнстон|1999|2p=99}} According to Blavatsky, mediumship is the contrast of [[adept]]ship, because the medium is the "passive instrument of foreign influences, [while] the adept actively controls himself and all inferior potencies."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1877|1p=588|Сенкевич|2012|2p=300}}

=== Demonization ===
Mersene Sloan, an editor and Bible teacher, called the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|theosophical initiation]] a process of "disguised" demonization, a "gross perversion" of the Christian regeneration.{{sfn|Sloan|1922|pp=135, 138}}
<blockquote>"The pupil [of Theosophy] becomes an Adept. This is one of many theosophic statements proving the end of the cult's endeavors to be the incarnation of demons in human beings. Of course, it is denied that the masters are demons, but the doctrines and practices of the cult prove them to be such, and such only. Some know it by actual contact with them... It is not, then, a matter of developing latent powers in man that Theosophy seeks, but the subjection of man to the invading powers of demons."{{sfn|Sloan|1922|pp=133–134}}</blockquote>

Drujinin argued that Theosophy seeks to "control the world" with the help of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Every Theosophist wants to achieve supernatural powers that "will elevated him above other people." The natural continuation of the absence of faith in the "true God" is that the Theosophist, who is a magic practitioner, "considers himself a god."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|pp=120–121}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, professor [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]], an Indian philosopher, wrote that supernatural powers are "by-products" of the higher life and "obstacles to [[samadhi]]" of the [[yogi]]. Only "through the disregard" of these powers, he can gain the [[Moksha|liberation]].{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|2008|p=367}}}} Drujinin summed up: "Exploring Theosophy, we came to the conclusion that such a muddled, contradictory and fantasy doctrine could had been created only by the mentally ill men!"{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=132}}

=== Satanism ===
The ministers of the Christian churches had related to the Theosophical Society as the "brood of the Evil one."{{sfn|Murphet|1975|p=216}} In 1879 Blavatsky wrote that the Christian Church called the Theosophists "infidel emissaries of [[Satan]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1967b|1p=98|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=65}}{{refn|group=note|Drujinin proclaimed, "The founders of Theosophy were actively fulfilling the task of their patron—[[Satan|Prince of Darkness]]."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=53}} The same way, Skeen declared that Blavatsky's teachings are of "[[Satanism|Satanic]] character."{{sfn|Skeen|2002}}}} In theologian Kuraev's opinion, the Theosophists declared that there is no other God at all except [[Lucifer]]: "It is 'Satan who is the god of our planet and ''the only'' god,' and this without any allusive metaphor to its wickedness and depravity. For he is one with the [[Logos]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=234|Кураев|2000|2p=174}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, according to professor Julia Shabanova, a Ukrainian philosopher, in ''The Secret Doctrine,'' the interpretation of the definitions of ''Satan, Lucifer'' is fundamentally different from Christian declarations.{{sfn|Шабанова|2016}}}}

Ellwood has quoted in ''The Secret Doctrine:''
<blockquote>Satan represents metaphysically simply the ''reverse or the polar opposite'' of everything in nature. He is the 'adversary,' allegorically, the 'murderer,' and the great Enemy of ''all,'' because there is nothing in the whole Universe that has not two sides—the reverses of the same medal. But in that case, light, goodness, beauty, etc., may be called Satan with as much propriety as the Devil, since they are the ''adversaries'' of darkness, badness and ugliness.{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888b|1p=389|Ellwood|2014a|2p=161}}{{refn|group=note|"Satan of the [[exoteric]] Jewish and Christian books is a mere figment of the monkish theological imagination."{{sfn|Purucker|1999|loc=Satan}}}}{{refn|group=note|Doctor Kuhn wrote that Blavatsky used ancient lore to prove that in their esoteric meaning all the "old legends" of the Evil Ones and the Powers of Darkness refer to no "essentially evil" beings but to the Divine Wisdom of the Sons of Light who had have the principle of intelligence.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=212}}}}</blockquote>

== Confrontations ==
Drujinin noted that Blavatsky "personally took part in the armed struggle against the Roman Catholic Church."{{sfn|Дружинин|2012|p=105}} In 1866 she was accompanying [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] on his expeditions. In 1867 she with the Italian volunteers "fought at [[Viterbo]] and then at [[Mentana]]" against French-[[Pope|Papal]] troops.

On December 2, 1994 the [[Bishops' Council of the Russian Orthodox Church]] accepted the interdict ''On the Pseudo-christian Sects, Neopaganism, and Occultism,'' in which Blavatskian Theosophy was defined as an anti-Christian doctrine.{{sfn|Interdict}}{{sfn|Кураев|2002}} Thus, the Russian Theosophists who counted himself the Orthodox Christians were [[anathema|excommunicated]].{{sfn|Максимович|2001}} [[Franz Hartmann]], a prominent Theosophist, wrote on clerics as follows:
<blockquote>"Every attack made upon the erroneous opinions and the selfishness of the church autocrats is misrepresented by the latter as an attack upon religion; not upon ''their'' religious views, but as an attack upon religion itself. Their church is their God, and the interests of the church are their religion; it is all the God and the religion they know; they can form no conception of a God without priestcraft, nor of a religion without church benefits."{{sfn|Hartmann|1909|p=150}}</blockquote>

== Modern Christian Theosophy ==
In Ellwood's opinion, in addition to the Blavatsky-Olcott line in Theosophy, there was another, quasi-theosophical, attitude to Christianity. In addition to the anti-clerical line in Theosophy, "Christian/Catholic Theosophy" of [[Anna Kingsford|Kingsford]] and [[Edward Maitland|Maitland]] arose. In 1882 they published a book ''The Perfect Way, or the Finding of Christ,''{{sfn|Kingsford|1919}} which made a great impression on Besant. This book says on the liberation of spirit from matter, a [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] prefigured, after the mystery drama of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and Death of Christ, in His [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]].{{sfn|Ellwood}}

In her book ''Esoteric Christianity'' Besant continued the Theosophical interpretation of Christianity.{{refn|group=note|Berdyaev wrote that in this book by Besant you can find a number of truths peculiar to the mystical understanding of Christianity, and that, compared to others, this book is less anti-Christian.{{sfn|Бердяев|1994|p=181}}}} In his article{{sfn|Skeen|2002}} Skeen analyzed her book in detail: according to her, a "healthy religion must contain a secret element attainable only by the spiritual elite."{{sfn|Skeen|2002}}{{sfn|Ellwood}}{{sfn|Besant|1902|p=2}} To prove that this secret element passed from Jesus to the Apostles, she cites [[Second Timothy]] 2:2. The verse reads: "The things that thou have heard from me ('teacher to pupil') among many witnesses, the same commit thou ('in a secret manner') to faithful men who shall be able to teach ('also in a secret teacher to pupil manner') others also."{{sfn|Besant|1902|pp=60–61}}{{sfn|Skeen|2002}} Besant named this esoteric knowledge the Greater Mysteries. The Lesser Mysteries meant the partial uncovering of the deep truths that must first be assimilated before entry into the Greater Mysteries. And Greater Mysteries can only be passed on "'from mouth to ear' as a pupil becomes qualified."{{sfn|Besant|1902|p=ix}}{{sfn|Skeen|2002}} In Besant's opinion, a return to the esoteric Christianity of the early ages is "the only way to save Christianity's importance."{{sfn|Skeen|2002}}{{sfn|Besant|1902|p=40}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, according to Berdyaev, modern "theosophical sects" discredited the "glorious word Theosophia" and forced to forget about the existence of the "genuine Christian Theosophy."{{sfn|Бердяев|1994|p=175}} He wrote, "We ought to be re-united with the traditions of the theosophy and anthroposophy of [[Jakob Böhme|J.Boehme]], in truth with a Christian theosophy and anthroposophy. And moreover, even more deeply ought we to be re-united with the traditions of the esoteric, hidden Christianity."{{sfn|Berdyaev}}}}

According to Besant, the Christ is "more than the man Jesus."{{sfn|Besant|1902|p=123}} She has three views of Christ: "the historical Christ, the mythic Christ, and the mystic Christ."{{sfn|Skeen|2002}} Skeen has quoted:
<blockquote>"Round this glorious Figure gathered the myths which united Him to the long array of His predecessors, the myths telling in allegory the story of all such lives, as they symbolise the work of the [[Logos]] in the Kosmos and the higher evolution of the individual human soul."{{sfn|Besant|1902|p=140}}{{sfn|Skeen|2002}}{{refn|group=note|[[Henry C. Sheldon|Henry Sheldon]], professor of theology, wrote that Besant, praising Jesus in ardent words, "makes him a debtor to Eastern wisdom, of which he is assumed to have been a devoted student for many years."{{sfnm|Besant|1902|1p=129|Sheldon|1916|2p=36}}}}</blockquote>

== Theosophical Christianity ==
In the post-Blavatsky works of Theosophists, the "earlier trenchant anticlericalism" is visibly lacking, and the attitude to Christianity is almost entirely positive. In particular, [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] demonstrated a new regard for "Catholic-type doctrine and worship, understood esoterically and theosophically." They also viewed Christ, "together with the church's seasons, festivals, and sacraments, as not only symbols of spiritual truth but also as means of transmitting transcendent energies." Large group of Theosophists entered the [[Liberal Catholic Church]], though some have been Anglicans and Roman Catholics.{{sfn|Ellwood}}{{refn|group=note|February 13, 1916 is regarded as "the foundation date" of the Church.{{sfn|Hooker}} "The first public services of the Church in Australia were held in Penzance Chambers in Sydney in April, 1917."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=610}}}} Ian Hooker, former Presiding Bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church, wrote:
<blockquote>"The Liberal Catholic Church arose from the sense of loss of many English theosophists whose new affiliation left them unwelcome in the churches where they had been worshiping, and from the endeavor of these people to find a place of Christian worship, along with freedom of interpretation, in the English branch of the European [[Old Catholic Church]]."{{sfn|Hooker}}</blockquote>
[[File:Eucharistform.jpg|thumb|200px|<center>''The Completed [[Eucharist]]ic Form''.{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Frontispiece}}</center>]]
The founding bishops of the Liberal Catholic Church were Theosophists [[J. I. Wedgwood]] and [[C. W. Leadbeater]] who were "actively involved" in the work of the Theosophical Society (Adyar). The doctrine of this Church offered an interpretation of Christianity in which "judgment and salvation after only one life," were substituted by liberation from the necessity for rebirth after many; and in which eschewal of the aftermath of sin "via the redemptive sacrifice of Christ," was substituted by the just and pedagogical receiving of results of whatever has been making in earlier incarnations under the "Law of Karma."{{sfn|Hooker}} The meaning of the rites of the Liberal Catholic Church was expounded in Leadbeater's book ''The Science of the Sacraments.''{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007}} The author's idea was to save the basic forms of traditional Christianity, but to put "new wine into its old wineskins." The "new wine" was the new nature of the Ancient Wisdom transmitted by the modern Theosophy. According to Ellwood, the Christian rite, "especially when well enacted and well supported by constructive thoughts on the part of all worshipers, creates thought-forms that are vessels and channels of the divine powers evoke by those exalted ideas."{{sfn|Ellwood|2000}}{{refn|group=note|In a book [[Thought-Forms (book)|''Thought-Forms'']]{{sfn|TForms|1901}} its authors have provided illustrated descriptions of the "subtle energies" that surround men. The subtle energies "activated and directed by Christian worship" surely correlate with the thought-forms.{{sfn|Ellwood|2014b|p=88}}}}

== Basis of mutual understanding ==
[[Stephan Hoeller]], a Regionary Bishop of [[Ecclesia Gnostica]], noted that the including the nineteenth-century polemics materials in the modern Christianity-Theosophy dialogue "is not useful."{{sfn|Hoeller|2001}} David Bland, a member of the Theosophical Society since 1970, stated:
<blockquote>"In the workshop recently [November 5–7, 2000] held to explore a greater interface between the Theosophical Society and the Christian tradition, it was recognized that some Christian faith tenets can indeed inhibit dialogue and create what may appear as in surmountable barriers to open exploration. As the participants in that workshop, members of the Society from various Christian backgrounds, worked through these issues, we identified our dilemma. Each of us recognized that dogmas, if accepted at face value, will continue to be a chasm, but we also realized that there are principles that can bridge that chasm. If one accepts the imperative of love, the interpretations that would divide can be placed to the side, and an atmosphere of love and understanding created."{{sfn|Bland}}</blockquote>
Professor Ellwood, a religious studies scholar and Liberal Catholic priest, proclaimed that Christianity could be rebuilt to be consonant "with the deepest insights of Theosophy, and moreover become for some people a vehicle for the transmission of those insights and the powers latent in them."{{sfn|Ellwood|2000}} In his book ''The Cross and the Grail: Esoteric Christianity for the 21st Century'' Ellwood wrote: 
<blockquote>"The [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox liturgy]], a [[Catholicity|Catholic form]] of service, suggests the desire to make physically visible what is transpiring on the [[astral plane|astral]] and [[mental plane]]s by intentionally creating sacramental thought-forms that channel divine energy from the heart of God. The actual correspondence may not always be exact, since no human craft or art could completely reproduce the worlds of the inner planes; but the feeling of color, richness, and unity-in-diversity is there. In Eastern Orthodoxy, the often-concealed altar behind the ''[[iconostasis]],'' a screen covered with icons and pictures of saints, is like the innermost eternal realm of [[pneuma]], spirit, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atma]], the God within. This power seems to radiate through the saints with their luminous eyes as though they were beings in the heaven of the mental plane, or [[Devachan]]. As the service progresses with its mystical and unforgettable music, its richly-robed clergy moving with the slowness of ancient ritual, and its billowing clouds of incense, a dome of silvery-blue light that merges upward into gold is formed above the congregation, like the onion-shaped domes atop many Orthodox churches. The structure is so exalted that it barely touches the earth, and not all present are able to perceive it directly."{{sfn|Ellwood|2014b|p=94}}</blockquote>
