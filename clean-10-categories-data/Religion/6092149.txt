==History==
The name ''Hypsistarioi'' first occurs in [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] (Orat., xviii, 5) and the name ''Hypsistianoi'' in [[Gregory of Nyssa]] (Contra Eunom., II), about 374 CE. Gregory of Nazianzus describes a syncretic Jewish-pagan group that does not worship idols, reveres lamps and fire, and worships the Almighty (''Pantokrator''). They keep Sabbath and adhere to dietary restrictions, but they do not circumcise. Gregory of Nyssa adds that they refer to God as the Highest (''Hypsistos'') or Almighty (''Pantokrator''). Gregory of Nazianzus' description of this cult occurs in his eulogy for his father, who was a Hypsistarian before his conversion to Christianity. This cult may have formed as the native [[Cappadocian Greeks|Cappadocian]] cult of [[Sabazios|Zeus Sabazios]] integrated with the cult of [[Names of God in Judaism#Tzevaot|Jahve Sabaoth]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-MVDAAAQBAJ&q=hypsistarians|title=Architects of Piety: The Cappadocian Fathers and the Cult of the Martyrs|last=Limberis|first=Vasiliki|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0199730889|location=USA|pages=122|quote="Their ideas about God derived from a syncretized monotheism, combining elements of the Cappadocian cult of Zeus Sabazios with the Jewish God Yahweh Sabaoth.

Another inscription below the first dedicates a lantern to the Most High God. In addition, a great number of votive tablets and other inscriptions establish that the cult worshipping the Most High (''Hypsistos'', often as ''Theos Hypsistos'' 'god most high', or as [[Zeus]] or [[Attis]], but frequently unnamed) as the supreme god was widespread in the countries adjacent to the Bosphorus (cf. Acts 16:17, "these men are servants of the most high God" — oracle of the [[Pythia]] at [[Philippi]]).

Contemporary Hellenistic use of ''hypsistos'' as a religious term appears to be derived from and compatible with the term as appears in the [[Septuagint]], from a much earlier date. (Greek {{lang|grc|ὕψιστος}} (''hypsistos'') translates Hebrew {{Hebrew|עליון}} (''elyon''), meaning "highest". This term occurs more than fifty times as a substitution for the [[Tetragrammaton]] (the name of God) or in direct relation to God (most often in the [[Psalms]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], and [[Sirach]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The existence of Hypsistarians may have contributed to the astounding swiftness of the spread of Christianity in Asia Minor; yet not all of them accepted the new faith, and small communities of monotheists, neither Christians nor Jews, continued to exist, especially in Cappadocia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}
 
[[Persius]] (34-62) may have had Hypsistarians in view when he ridiculed such hybrid religionists in Satire v, 179–84, and [[Tertullian]] (c. 160 – c. 225 AD) seems to refer to them in ''[[wikisource:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/Ad Nationes|Ad nationes]]'', I, xiii. The claim that Hypsistarians continued to exist until the ninth century relies on a mistaken interpretation of [[Nicephorus Const.]], "Antirhet. adv. Const. Copr.", I, in Migne, PG, col. 209. Hypsistarians are probably referred to under the name Coelicoloe in a decree of the Emperors [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] and [[Theodosius II]] (AD 408), in which their places of worship are transferred to the Christians.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

==Mention by Goethe==

After describing his difficulties with mainstream religion, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] laments that 
{{quote|...I have found no confession of faith to which I could ally myself without reservation. Now in my old age, however, I have learned of a sect, the Hypsistarians, who, hemmed in between heathens, Jews and Christians, declared that they would treasure, admire, and honour the best, the most perfect that might come to their knowledge, and inasmuch as it must have a close connection to the Godhead, pay it reverence. A joyous light thus beamed at me suddenly out of a dark age, for I had the feeling that all my life I had been aspiring to qualify as a Hypsistarian. That, however, is no small task, for how does one, in the limitations of one's individuality, come to know what is most excellent?<ref>{{Citation | type = letter | contribution = To Sulpiz Boisserée | origyear = 22 March 1831 | editor-first = Peter | editor-last = Boerner | first = Johann Wolfgang | last = von Goethe | title = 1832/1982: A Biographical Essay | place = Bonn | publisher = Inter Nations | year = 1981 | page = 82}}.</ref>}}
