{{short description|General review of religious attitudes towards evolution}}
Although biological [[evolution]] has been vocally opposed by some religious groups, many other groups accept the scientific position, sometimes with additions to allow for theological considerations.  The positions of such groups are described by terms including "[[theistic evolution]]", "theistic evolutionism" or "evolutionary creation".  Theistic evolutionists believe that [[existence of God|there is a God]], that God is [[Creator deity|the creator]] of the [[matter|material]] universe and (by consequence) all life within, and that biological evolution is a [[nature|natural process]] within that creation. Evolution, according to this view, is simply a tool that God employed to develop [[human being|human life]]. According to the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], a [[Christians|Christian]] organization of scientists:

{{quotation|A theory of theistic evolution (TE) — also called evolutionary creation — proposes that God's method of creation was to cleverly design a universe in which everything would naturally evolve. Usually the "evolution" in "theistic evolution" means Total Evolution — astronomical evolution (to form galaxies, solar systems,...) and geological evolution (to form the earth's geology) plus chemical evolution (to form the first life) and biological evolution (for the development of life) — but it can refer only to biological evolution.<ref>{{cite web|author=Craig Rusbult, Ph.D.|title=Evolutionary Creation|url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/education/origins/te2-cr.htm|year=1998|publisher=American Scientific Affiliation|quote=A theory of theistic evolution (TE) — also called evolutionary creation * — proposes that God's method of creation was to cleverly design a universe in which everything would naturally evolve.

According to [[Eugenie Scott]], Director of the US [[National Center for Science Education]], "In one form or another, Theistic Evolutionism is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline Protestant [[seminaries]], and it is the official position of the Catholic church".<ref name="Scott, 271">* [[Eugenie C. Scott|Scott, Eugenie C.]], "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2952523 Antievolution and Creationism in the United States]", ''[[Annual Review of Anthropology]]'', Vol. 26, (1997), pp.&nbsp;263–289.</ref>

Theistic evolution is not a [[scientific theory]], but a particular view about how the science of evolution relates to religious belief and interpretation. Theistic evolution supporters can be seen as one of the groups who reject the [[conflict thesis]] regarding the [[relationship between religion and science]]{{spaced ndash}}that is, they hold that religious teachings about creation and scientific theories of evolution need not contradict, what evolutionary biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] called [[non-overlapping magisteria]].  Christian proponents of this view are sometimes described as Christian [[Darwinism|Darwinists]].<ref>{{cite book

== Acceptance ==
This view is generally accepted by major [[Christianity|Christian]] churches, including the [[Catholic Church]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)]], and some other [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] denominations;<ref name="Scott, 271"/> virtually all [[Judaism|Jewish]] denominations; and other religious groups that lack a [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] stance concerning some holy [[scripture]]s. Various biblical literalists have accepted or noted openness to this stance, including theologian [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B.B. Warfield]] and evangelist [[Billy Graham]]. A 2007 poll showed that acceptance among American Buddhists, Hindus and Jews was higher than among any Christian groups (graph below). One recent survey, conducted by physicist [[Max Tegmark]], on "of how different US faith communities view origins science, particularly evolution and Big Bang cosmology." Although "[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] reports that 46% of Americans believe that God created humans in their present form less than 10,000 years ago", it found "only 11% belong to religions openly rejecting evolution."<ref>[Max Tegmark, Eugena Lee, and Meia Chita-Tegmark, "The MIT Survey on Science, Religion and Origins: the Belief Gap", Feb. 11, 2013,http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/survey/survey.pdf, p. 1]</ref>

With this approach toward evolution, scriptural creation stories are typically interpreted as being [[allegory|allegorical]] in nature.
Both Jews and Christians have considered the idea of the [[Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|creation history as an allegory]] (instead of a historical description) long before the development of Darwin's theory. An example in Christianity would be the earlier writings by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (4th century), though he later rejected allegory in favor of  literal interpretation.  By this Augustine meant that in Genesis 1 the terms "light", "day", and "morning" hold a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, and that this spiritual morning is just as literal as physical morning.  Augustine recognizes that the creation of a spiritual morning is as much a historical event as the creation of physical light.<ref name="PSCF3-88Young.html">[http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html Davis A. Young, "The Contemporary Relevance of Augustine's View of Creation" from ''Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith'' 40.1]</ref> [In later work, Augustine said that "there are some who think that only the world was made by God and that everything else is made by the world according to his ordination and command, but that God Himself makes nothing".<ref>Taylor, JH (trans) (1982) "St. Augustine.

Theistic evolutionists argue that it is inappropriate to use [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] as a scientific text, since it was written in a pre-scientific age and originally intended for religious instruction; as such, seemingly chronological aspects of the creation accounts should be thought of in terms of a [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)|literary framework]].  Theistic evolutionists may believe that creation is not literally a week-long process but a process beginning in the time of Genesis and continuing through all of time, including today.  This view affirms that God created the world and was the primary causation of our being, while scientific changes such as evolution are part of "creatio continua" or continuing creation which is still occurring in the never ending process of creation.  This is one possible way of interpreting biblical scriptures, such as Genesis, that seem otherwise to be in opposition to scientific theories, such as evolution.<ref name=Peters>''Can You Believe in God and Evolution'', Ted Peters and Matrinez Hewlett</ref>

== Spectrum of viewpoints ==
Many religious organizations accept evolutionary theory, though their related theological interpretations vary. Additionally, individuals or movements within such organizations may not accept evolution, and stances on evolution may have adapted (or evolved) throughout history.  There is considerable variance in overall acceptance of evolution between different countries, with studies showing that acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Europe or Japan (only [[Turkey]] had a lower rate in the 34 countries sampled),<ref name=miller-et-al>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1126746|title=SCIENCE COMMUNICATION: Public Acceptance of Evolution|year=2006|last1=Miller|first1=J.D.|journal=Science|volume=313|issue=5788|pages=765–6|pmid=16902112|last2=Scott|first2=EC|last3=Okamoto|first3=S|s2cid=152990938}}</ref> and attitudes within religious groups may differ somewhat between counties.

=== Baháʼí Faith===
In the [[Baháʼí Faith]], [[`Abdul-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote about the origin of life. A fundamental part of `Abdul-Bahá's teachings on evolution is the belief that all life came from the [[Common descent|same origin]]: "the origin of all material life is one..."<ref>{{harvnb|Effendi|1912|p=350}}</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=May 2020}} He states that from this sole origin, the complete diversity of life was generated: "Consider the world of created beings, how varied and diverse they are in species, yet with one sole origin"<ref>{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1912|pp= 51–52}}</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=May 2020}} He explains that a slow, gradual process led to the development of complex entities:

:"[T]he growth and development of all beings is gradual; this is the universal divine organization and the natural system. The seed does not at once become a tree; the embryo does not at once become a man; the mineral does not suddenly become a stone. No, they grow and develop gradually and attain the limit of perfection"<ref>{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1908|pp=198–99}}</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=May 2020}}

=== Christianity ===
{{See also|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|Framework interpretation (Genesis)}}

Evolution contradicts a literalistic interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]; however, according to [[Catholicism]] and most contemporary [[Protestant]] denominations, [[biblical literalism]] in the creation account is not mandatory. Christians have considered allegorical interpretations of Genesis since long before the development of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution, or [[James Hutton|Hutton]]'s principle of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]. A notable example is [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (4th century), who, on [[theology|theological]] grounds, argued that everything in the universe was created by God in the same instant, and not in six days as a plain reading of Genesis would require.<ref name="PSCF3-88Young.html"/> Modern theologians such as [[Meredith G. Kline]] and [[Henri Blocher]] have advocated what has become known as the [[literary framework interpretation]] of the days of Genesis.

==== Contemporary Christian denominations ====
All of the traditional [[mainline Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s support or accept theistic evolution. For example, on 12 February 2006, the 197th anniversary of [[Charles Darwin]]'s birth was commemorated by "[[Evolution Sunday]]" where the message that followers of Christ do not have to choose between biblical stories of creation and evolution was taught in classes and sermons at many [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[United Church of Christ]], [[Baptist]] and community churches.<ref>[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060220creationism.shtml Churches urged to challenge Intelligent Design  -20/02/06]</ref>

Additionally, the [[National Council of Churches]] United States has issued a teaching resource to "assist people of faith who experience no conflict between science and their faith and who embrace science as one way of appreciating the beauty and complexity of
God's creation." This resource cites the Episcopal Church, according to whom the stories of creation in Genesis "should not be understood as historical and scientific accounts of origins but as proclamations of basic theological truths about creation."<ref>[http://www.ncccusa.org/pdfs/evolutionbrochurefinal.html Science, Religion, and the Teaching of Evolution in Public School Science Classes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819203651/http://www.ncccusa.org/pdfs/evolutionbrochurefinal.html |date=2014-08-19 }} (pdf), The [[National Council of Churches]] Committee on Public Education and Literacy, [http://www.ncccusa.org/news/060330evolution.html Teaching Evolution], March 2006</ref>

The positions of particular denominations are discussed below.

===== Anglicanism =====
[[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] (including the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], the [[Church of England]] and others) believe that the Bible "contains all things necessary to salvation," while believing that "science and Christian theology can complement one another in the quest for truth and understanding." Specifically on the subject of creation/evolution, some Anglicans view "Big Bang cosmology" as being "in tune with both the concepts of creation out of nothing and continuous creation." Their position is clearly set out in the ''Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://episcopalscience.org/creation-science/ |title=Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science |access-date=2014-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222213843/http://episcopalscience.org/creation-science/ |archive-date=2014-02-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In a March 2006 interview, the then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] Dr [[Rowan Williams]] expressed his thought that "creationism is, in a sense, a kind of [[category mistake]], as if the Bible were a theory like other theories. Whatever the biblical account of creation is, it's not a theory alongside theories... My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,1735404,00.html ''The Guardian'', March 21, 2006]</ref> His view is that creationism should not be taught in schools.

===== United Methodist Church =====
The [[United Methodist Church]] affirms a Creator God and supports the scientific study of evolution.
<blockquote>
"We recognize science as a legitimate interpretation of God's natural world. We affirm the validity of the claims of science in describing the natural world and in determining what is scientific. We preclude science from making authoritative claims about theological issues and theology from making authoritative claims about scientific issues. We find that science's descriptions of cosmological, geological, and biological evolution are not in conflict with theology." <ref>[http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&b=3082929&ct=6715227] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607070533/http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&b=3082929&ct=6715227 |date=2011-06-07 }}  The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church – 2008,  The United Methodist Publishing House.</ref></blockquote>

===== Church of the Nazarene =====
The [[Church of the Nazarene]], an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian denomination, sees "knowledge acquired by science and human inquiry equal to that acquired by divine revelation," and, while the church "'believes in the Biblical account of creation' and holds that God is the sole creator, it allows latitude 'regarding the "how" of creation.'"<ref name="msnbc.msn.com">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070915141141/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20657204/site/newsweek/ "Can God Love Darwin, Too?" by Sharon Begley, ''Newsweek'', Sept. 17, 2007 issue]</ref>

While [[Richard G. Colling]], author of ''Random Designer''<ref>''Random Designer: Created from Chaos to Connect with the Creator'', Browning Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-9753904-0-6}}</ref> and professor at [[Olivet Nazarene University]], received criticism from elements within the denomination in 2007 for his book (published in 2004),<ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/> [[Darrel R. Falk]] of [[Point Loma Nazarene]] published a similar book in 2004,<ref>''Coming to Peace with Science: Bridging the Worlds Between Faith and Biology'', InterVarsity Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8308-2742-0}}</ref> and [[Karl Giberson]] of [[Eastern Nazarene]], the first Nazarene scholar to publish with [[Oxford University Press]], has published four books since 1993 on the tensions between science and religion,<ref>''Worlds Apart: The Unholy War between Religion and Science'', Beacon Hill Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8341-1504-2}}<br>With [[Donald Yerxa]], ''Species of Origins: America's Search for a Creation Story'', Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2002 {{ISBN|0-7425-0764-5}}<br>With [[Mariano Artigas]], ''The Oracles of Science: Celebrity Scientist Versus God and Religion'', Oxford University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-531072-1}}</ref> including his most recently published ''Saving Darwin''.<ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/>

Theologians of note in the denomination whose work on science and religion shows the promise of cooperation include [[Thomas Jay Oord]] (''Science of Love'', ''The Altruism Reader'', ''Defining Love''), [[Michael Lodahl]] (''God of Nature and of Grace''), and Samuel M. Powell (''Participating in God'').  These theologians see no major problem reconciling theology with the general theory of evolution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Nazarene ''Manual'', a document crafted to provide Biblical guidance and denominational expression for Church members, states: "The Church of the Nazarene believes in the biblical account of creation ("In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . . ."—Genesis 1:1). We oppose any godless interpretation of the origin of the universe and of humankind. However, the church accepts as valid all scientifically verifiable discoveries in geology and other natural phenomena, for we firmly believe that God is the Creator. (Articles I.1., V. 5.1, VII.) (2005)<ref>[http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf Manual, p.371] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302214359/http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf |date=2013-03-02 }}</ref>

===== Eastern Orthodox Church =====
The Eastern Orthodox Church is divided in two large categories, which might be labeled as compatibilism and dualism.

On the one hand, compatibilists hold that evolutionary science and theology are compatible and view them as complementary revelations of God. As God is the source of both his specific revelation of himself in the Christian faith and the source of the general revelation of himself in nature, the findings of science and theology cannot really contradict; the contradictions must be merely apparent and a resolution possible which is faithful to the truth of God's revelation.
Nicozisin (Father George) is a compatibilist.<ref>http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/dogmatics/nicozisin_creationism.htm</ref>

On the other hand, dualists hold that evolution can be incompatible with faith. They usually argue either that evolutionary science is philosophically based on a kind of naturalism or that God's specific revelation is infallible and therefore trumps the findings of human reason in the case of any conflict between them. This is often based on a suspicion of human reason to arrive at reliable conclusions in the first place. Their stance is somewhat similar to [[Averroism]], in that there is one truth, but it can be arrived at through (at least) two different paths, namely Philosophy and Religion.
Bufeev, S. V, is a dualist, preferring to see the spiritual level above the mechanical, physico-chemical, or biological levels; he attributes discrepancies between spiritual matters and scientific matters to be because of the purely naturalistic views of evolutionists.<ref>http://www.creatio.orthodoxy.ru/sbornik/sbufeev_whynot_english.html</ref>

===== Roman Catholic Church =====
{{Main article|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church}}
The position of the Roman Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has changed over the last two centuries from a large period of no official mention, to a statement of neutrality in the early-1950s, to limited guarded acceptance in recent years, rejecting the materialistic and reductionist philosophies behind it, and insisting that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and the reality of a single human ancestor (commonly called [[Monogenesis (disambiguation)|monogenism]]) for all of mankind. The Church does not argue with scientists on matters such as the [[age of the earth]] and the authenticity of the [[fossil record]], seeing such matters as outside its area of expertise. Papal pronouncements, along with commentaries by cardinals, indicate that the Church is aware of the general findings of scientists on the gradual appearance of life.  Indeed, Belgian priest [[Georges Lemaître]], astronomer and physics professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Louvain]], was the first to propose the theory of [[expansion of the universe]], often incorrectly credited to [[Edwin Hubble]]. In the 1950 [[encyclical]] ''[[Humani generis]]'', [[Pope Pius XII]] confirmed that there is no intrinsic conflict between Christianity and the theory of evolution, provided that Christians believe that the individual [[soul]] is a direct creation by [[God in Christianity|God]] and not the product of purely material forces.<ref>{{cite news |title=Catholics and the Evolving Cosmos |first=John |last=Farrell |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703846604575447493644515142 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=August 27, 2010 |access-date=September 11, 2012}}</ref> {{As of|2013|alt=Today}}, many members of the Church support [[theistic evolution]], also known as ''evolutionary creation''.<ref name="Alberta">{{cite web|url = http://www.lastseminary.com/genesis-modern-science/Evolutionary%20Creation.pdf|title =Evolutionary Creation|quote=Evolutionary creation best describes the official position of the Roman Catholic Church, though it is often referred to in this tradition as 'theistic evolution.'|publisher = [[University of Alberta]]|access-date = 2007-10-18}}</ref> Under Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]], the International Theological Commission published a paper accepting the [[Big Bang|big bang]] of 15 billion years ago and the evolution of all life including humans from the microorganisms that formed approximately 4 billion years ago.<ref>"Communion and Stewardship: Human Persons Created in the Image of God."

=== Deism ===
{{See also|Deism}}
[[Deism]] is belief in a [[God]] or [[first cause]] based on [[reason]], rather than on [[faith]] or [[revelation]]. Most deists{{Who|date=June 2012}} believe that God does not interfere with the world or create [[miracle]]s. Some deists{{Who|date=June 2012}} believe that a [[Divine Creator]] initiated a universe in which evolution occurred, by designing the system and the natural laws, although many deists believe that God also created life itself, before allowing it to be subject to evolution. They find it to be undignified and unwieldy for a deity to make constant adjustments rather than letting evolution elegantly adapt organisms to changing environments.

One recent convert to deism was philosopher and professor [[Antony Flew]], who became a deist in December 2004. Professor Flew, a former [[atheist]], later argued that recent research into the origins of life supports the theory that some form of intelligence was involved. Whilst accepting subsequent Darwinian evolution, Flew argued that this cannot explain the complexities of the origins of life. He also stated that the investigation of [[DNA]] "has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce [life], that intelligence must have been involved."<ref>[http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/atheist_philosopher_041210.html Atheist Philosopher, 81, Now Believes in God | LiveScience<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He subsequently clarified this statement in an interview with Joan Bakewell for BBC Radio 4 in March 2005: "What I was converted to was the existence of an [[Aristotelian view of God|Aristotelian God]], and Aristotle's God had no interest in human affairs at all."<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/belief/scripts/antony_flew.html BBC interview, Professor Antony Flew] March 22, 2005.</ref>{{Relevance inline|date=March 2012}}<!-- No evidence that Flew is a TE, so how is this paragraph relevant? --><!-- He accepts evolution, but believes in a deity. -->

=== Hinduism ===
{{See also|Hindu views on evolution}}
Hindu views on evolution include a range of viewpoints with regard to [[evolution]], [[creationism]], and the [[origin of life]] within the traditions of [[Hinduism]]. The accounts of the emergence of life within the universe vary, but classically tell of the [[deity]] called [[Brahma]], from a [[Trimurti]] of three deities also including [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], performing the act of "creation", or more specifically of "propagating life within the universe". with the other two deities responsible for "preservation" and "destruction" (of the universe) respectively.<ref>

==== Day and night of Brahma ====
Science writers [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Fritjof Capra]] have pointed out similarities between the latest scientific understanding of the age of the universe, and the Hindu concept of a "day and night of Brahma", which is much closer to the current known age of the universe than other creation myths. The days and nights of Brahma posit a view of the universe that is divinely created, and is not strictly evolutionary, but an ongoing cycle of birth, death, and rebirth of the universe. According to Sagan:
{{quotation|The Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths. It is the only religion in which time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma, 8.64 billion years long, longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time since the Big Bang.<ref>{{cite book | last =Sagan | first =Carl | author-link =Carl Sagan | title =[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]] | publisher =Ballantine Books | year =1985 | isbn =978-0-345-33135-9 }} p. 258.</ref>}}

Capra, in his popular book ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'', wrote that:
{{quotation|This idea of a periodically expanding and contracting universe, which involves a scale of time and space of vast proportions, has arisen not only in modern cosmology, but also in ancient Indian mythology. Experiencing the universe as an organic and rhythmically moving cosmos, the Hindus were able to develop evolutionary cosmologies which come very close to our modern scientific models.<ref>{{cite book | last =Capra | first =Fritjof | author-link =Fritjof Capra | title =[[Tao of Physics]] | publisher =Shambhala | year =1991 | isbn =978-0-87773-594-6 }} p. 198</ref>}}

==== Daśāvatāras and evolution ====
The British geneticist and evolutionary biologist [[J B S Haldane]] observed that the Dasavataras (ten principal avatars of Lord [[Vishnu]]) provide a true sequential depiction of the great unfolding of [[evolution]]. The avatars of [[Vishnu]] show an uncanny similarity to the biological theory of evolution of life on earth.<ref>

|-
| Matsya.
| First avatar is a [[fish]], one which is creature living in water.
| If we compare it with biological evolution on different Geological Time Scale first developed life was also in the form of fish which originated during [[Cambrian]] period.
|-
| Kurma
| Second avatar was in the form of Tortoise (reptiles).
| In geology also first reptiles comes as second important evolution which originated in [[Mississippian age]] just after [[Amphibians]].
|-
| Varaha
| Third avatar was in the form of Boar.
| Evolution of the amphibian to the land animal.
|-
| Narasimha
| The Man-Lion (Nara= man, simha=lion) was the fourth avatar.
| But in geology no such evidences are mentioned. It may have been related with Ape Man The term may sometimes refer to extinct early human ancestors.
|-
| Vamana
| Fifth Avatar is the dwarf man.
| It may be related with the first man originated during [[Pliocene]]. It may be related with [[Neanderthals]]. Neanderthals were generally only 12 to 14&nbsp;cm (4½–5½ in) shorter than modern humans, contrary to a common view of them as "very short" or "just over 5 feet".
|-
| Parashurama,
| The man with an axe was the sixth avatar.
| It has the similarities with the first modern man originated during [[Quaternary]] period or the man of Iron Age.

Lord Rama, Lord Krishna and Lord Buddha were the seventh, eighth and ninth other avatars of Lord Vishnu. It indicates the physical and mental changes and evolution in the man from its time of appearance.

=== Islam ===
{{See also|Islamic creationism}}
{{See also|Islamic evolution}}
Some predated Muslims{{Who|date=June 2012}} reject origin of species from a common ancestor by evolution as incompatible with the [[Qur'an]]. Famous scholar of Indian subcontinent [[Israr Ahmed| Dr. Israr Ahmed]] and most of his followers accept the theory of evolution because according to them, Quran itself has references of [[Primordial soup]] spanning in various chapters and the event of prostration to Adam does not nullify evolution rather it reinforces it. Amongst Muslims who accept evolution, many believe that humanity was a special creation by God. For example, Shaikh Nuh Ha Mim Keller, an American Muslim and specialist in Islamic law has argued in ''Islam and Evolution''<ref>[http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/nuh/evolve.htm Evolution and Islam<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> that a belief in [[macroevolution]] is not incompatible with Islam, as long as it is accepted that "Allah is the Creator of everything" (Qur'an 13:16) and that Allah specifically created humanity (in the person of Adam; Qur'an 38:71-76). Shaikh Keller states in his conclusion however:
<blockquote>
"As for claim that man has evolved from a non-human species, this is unbelief (kufr) no matter if we ascribe the process to Allah or to "nature," because it negates the truth of Adam's special creation that Allah has revealed in the Qur'an. Man is of special origin, attested to not only by revelation, but also by the divine secret within him, the capacity for ma'rifa or knowledge of the Divine that he alone of all things possesses. By his God-given nature, man stands before a door opening onto infinitude that no other creature in the universe can aspire to. Man is something else."
</blockquote>

==== Ahmadiyya ====
{{See also|Ahmadiyya views on evolution}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] movement [[Ahmadiyya views on evolution|universally accept]] the scientific principle of the process of evolution, with divine guidance.<ref>[http://itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html  Jesus and the Indian Messiah – 13. Every Wind of Doctrine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509033003/http://www.itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html |date=2010-05-09 }}</ref>

[[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], the (late) leader of the Ahmadiyya movement, elaborated this by explaining the complex mechanism of evolution as having been played more like strategic game of chess rather than a random game of dice.<ref>Revelation, Rationality, Knowledge & Truth: [http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_5_section_10.html Part V, Section 10: A Game of Chess or a Game of Chance!]</ref>

=== Judaism ===
{{See also|Judaism and evolution}}
In general, three of the four major [[Jewish denominations|denominations]] of American [[Judaism]] ([[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]) accept theistic evolution. Within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]], there is much debate about the issue.  Most [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] groups accept theistic evolution and most [[Haredi Judaism|Ultra-Orthodox]] groups do not.  This disagreement was most vociferous in the [[Natan Slifkin#Controversy|Natan Slifkin controversy]] which arose when a number of prominent Ultra-Orthodox Rabbis banned books written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin which explored the idea of theistic evolution within Jewish tradition.  These Rabbis forming part of [[Jewish opposition to evolution]] considered that his books were [[heresy]] as they indicated that the [[Talmud]] is not necessarily correct about scientific matters such as the [[age of the Earth]].

Advocates of theistic evolution within Judaism follow two general approaches. Either the [[Genesis creation myth|creation account]] in the [[Torah]] is not to be taken as a literal text, but rather as a [[symbol]]ic work, or, alternatively, that the 'days' do not refer to 24-hour periods. The latter view, called [[day-age creationism]], is justified by how the first day in the biblical account actually precedes the creation of the sun and earth by which 24 hour days are reckoned and by how the seventh day of rest has no evening and morning. In the day-age view, Jewish [[scholars]] point out how the order of creation in Genesis corresponds to the scientific description of the development of life on Earth—the sun, then earth, then oceans, then oceanic plant life, fish preceding land-based life, with mammals and finally humans last—and in no way specifies the method of creation in a manner prohibitive of evolution.

[[Karaite Judaism]] is a Jewish a movement which is distinct in that they do not accept the [[Talmud]] (a series of Rabbinic commentaries) as law and follow the Hebrew scriptures as they are written. Karaites are currently divided on the question of evolution with many or most Karaite Jews leaning in favor of Theistic Evolution.

=== Samaritanism ===
The [[Samaritans]], a divergent branch of the Israelites (the other being the Jews), generally accept Theistic Evolution. Samaritans do not consider themselves to be Jewish, but hold similar beliefs. The Jews, however, hold the [[Tanakh]] (consisting of the [[Torah]] or [[Pentateuch]], plus [[Nevi'im]], and [[Ketuvim]]) as canonical scripture in conjunction with the Oral Law as compiled in the Talmud, while the Samaritan's canonical scriptures consists only of the Torah (a slightly differing Pentateuch, i.e. the Five Books of Moses), but exclude both Nevi'im and Ketuvim, as well as excluding the Talmud.

=== Pantheism ===
[[Pantheism|Pantheists]] (for instance in [[Naturalistic Pantheism]]) may view natural processes, including evolution, as work or emanations from the impersonal, non-anthropomorphic deity.<ref>{{Cite book  | title = The New Oxford Dictionary Of English  | publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1998 | location = Oxford  | pages =  1341|isbn = 0-19-861263-X  }}</ref><ref name="Deity">Owen, H.

=== Evolutionary biologists who were also theists ===
Although [[evolutionary biologists]] have often been [[agnostics]] (most notably [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]]) or [[Atheism|atheists]] (most notably [[Richard Dawkins]]), from the outset many have had a belief in some form of theism. These have included [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823&ndash;1913), who in a joint paper with [[Charles Darwin]] in 1858, proposed the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. Wallace, in his later years, was effectively a [[deist]] who believed that "the unseen universe of Spirit" had interceded to create life as well as consciousness in animals and (separately) in humans.<ref>Martin Fichman, (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j2E293wQ63AC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false An elusive Victorian: the evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace]''. p. 159</ref> Darwin had a longstanding close friendship with the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] who was a leading supporter of Darwin's theory, and a devout Presbyterian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/religion-historical-resources |title=Historical Resources |year=2009 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |access-date=2009-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504201014/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/religion-historical-resources |archive-date=2012-05-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Gray wrote a series of essays on the relationship of natural selection to religious belief and [[natural theology]], and supported the views of theologians who said that design through evolution was inherent in all forms of life.<ref name=Grayreviews>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/essays-reviews-by-asa-gray |title=Essays & reviews by Asa Gray |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |access-date=2009-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007070259/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/essays-reviews-by-asa-gray |archive-date=2010-10-07 |url-status=dead }}<br>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/gray-essay-evolution-theology |title=Essay: Evolution & theology |author=Asa Gray |author-link=Asa Gray |date=January 15, 1874 |work=Darwin Correspondence Project |publisher=The Nation |access-date=2009-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007070628/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/gray-essay-evolution-theology |archive-date=October 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Darwin had Gray and [[Charles Kingsley]] in mind when he wrote that "It seems to me absurd to doubt that a man may be an ardent theist & an evolutionist".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-12041 |title=Letter 12041 — Darwin, C.

An early example of this kind of approach came from computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] who published his unofficial ''Ninth [[Bridgewater Treatise]]'' in 1837, putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required.

[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881&ndash;1955) was a noted geologist and paleontologist as well as a [[Jesuit]] Priest who wrote extensively on the subject of incorporating evolution into a new understanding of Christianity. Initially suppressed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], his theological work has had considerable influence and is widely taught in Catholic and most [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] seminaries.

Both [[Ronald Fisher]] (1890&ndash;1962) and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] (1900&ndash;1975), were Christians and architects of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. Dobzhansky, a Russian Orthodox, wrote a famous 1973 essay entitled ''[[Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution]]'' espousing evolutionary creationism:

:"I am a creationist and an evolutionist. Evolution is God's, or Nature's, method of creation. Creation is not an event that happened in 4004 BC; it is a process that began some 10 billion years ago and is still under way... Does the evolutionary doctrine clash with religious faith? It does not. It is a blunder to mistake the Holy Scriptures for elementary textbooks of astronomy, geology, biology, and anthropology. Only if symbols are construed to mean what they are not intended to mean can there arise imaginary, insoluble conflicts... the blunder leads to blasphemy: the Creator is accused of systematic deceitfulness."

In the realm of biology and theology, the saying coined by [[Thomas Jay Oord]] is perhaps appropriate: "The Bible tells us how to find abundant life, not the details of how life became abundant."
