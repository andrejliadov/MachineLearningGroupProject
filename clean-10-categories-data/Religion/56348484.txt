'''Known unto God''' is a phrase used on the gravestones of unknown soldiers in [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] (CWGC) cemeteries.  The phrase was selected by British poet [[Rudyard Kipling]] who worked for what was then the Imperial War Graves Commission during the [[First World War]].  The origin of the phrase is unknown but it has been linked to sections of the [[King James Bible]].  The phrase was re-used for those killed during the [[Second World War]] and appears on more than 212,000 gravestones across the world.  In 2013 there was controversy when it was proposed that the phrase be removed from the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] at the [[Australian War Memorial]].

== Background ==
The phrase "Known unto God" forms the standard epitaph for all unidentified soldiers of the [[First World War]] buried in [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] (CWGC) cemeteries.<ref name=knowles/><ref name=booth>{{cite book |last1=Booth |first1=Howard J. |title=The Cambridge Companion to Rudyard Kipling |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781107493636 |page=91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oBIWAwAAQBAJ |accessdate=22 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref>  The phrase is engraved towards the bottom of the gravestone.  The first line of text on the stone is a description of the deceased, which may be little more than "A soldier of the Great War"; the centre shows a cross, though the deceased's actual religious affiliation may be unknown; and the top an appropriate unit badge where known.<ref name=knowles>{{cite book |last1=Knowles |first1=Elizabeth |title=Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations |date=2007 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=9780199208951 |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjLTsncFKCgC |accessdate=22 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Frequently asked questions about our documents |url=https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-war-dead-and-cemeteries/documents-faqs |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref>  The phrase appears on more than 212,000 CWGC gravestones around the world.<ref name=bolt>{{cite news |last1=Bolt |first1=Andrew |title=Chiselling God from the Unknown Soldier's grave |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/chiselling-god-from-the-unknown-soldiers-grave/news-story/3397eee85ed8c7f79318e135219f3318 |accessdate=22 November 2018 |work=Herald Sun |date=28 October 2013}}</ref>

== Kipling ==
The phrase was selected by British poet [[Rudyard Kipling]].<ref name=bbc>{{cite news |title=Solving the mystery of Kipling's son |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35321716 |accessdate=22 November 2018 |work=BBC News |date=2016}}</ref>  Kipling had joined the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC)<ref>This organisation was changed the name to Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) in 1960.</ref> – the predecessor to the CWGC – in 1917 as its first literary adviser.<ref name=archive>{{cite web |title=6 poetic stories from the CWGC archives |url=https://www.cwgc.org/learn/news-and-events/news/2017/09/28/09/38/6-poetic-stories-from-the-cwgc-archives |website=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |accessdate=22 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

Kipling's involvement with the IWGC may have been influenced by the loss of his only son [[John Kipling]] in the 1915 [[Battle of Loos]].<ref name=roberts>{{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=Andrew |title=A History of the English-Speaking Peoples since 1900 |date=2010 |publisher=Orion |isbn=9780297865247 |page=195 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rQTgHvsUhyMC |accessdate=22 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=booth/>  John was [[Missing in action|missing presumed killed in action]] (his grave was only identified in 1992) and this weighed heavily upon Rudyard Kipling.<ref name=bbc/><ref name=booth/>  In discussing memorials to those missing with no known grave he said {{nowrap|"[t]his}} matter is naturally of the deepest concern to the relatives of those whose bodies have never been recovered or identified, or whose graves, once made, have been destroyed by later battles" and when the ongoing funding of the IWGC was discussed in parliament he was quick to defend it stating "our boy was missing at Loos.  The ground is of course battered and mined past all hope of any trace being recovered.  I wish some of the people who are making this trouble realised how more than fortunate they are to have a name on a headstone in a known place".<ref name=booth/>  Kipling was renowned as an author who contributed to the mythology of the British Empire in the late-19th and early 20th-centuries so he seems to have been a natural choice to compose the texts to commemorate that Empire's contribution to the war.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sheftall |first1=Mark David |title=Altered Memories of the Great War: Divergent Narratives of Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada |date=2010 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=9780857710321 |page=146 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2sAAwAAQBAJ |accessdate=22 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

== Origins of the phrase ==
Kipling's choice of wording may have been influenced by his experience as a grieving father.<ref name=roberts/>  At the time his poetry was also becoming more fragmented and bitter in nature.  Some of his poems of the time were just two lines long, of a similar length to the epitaphs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adams |first1=Jad |title=Kipling |date=2012 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=9781908323071 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1crDwAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref>  Kipling's inspiration for the wording of "known unto God" is unknown, however the phrase occurs twice in the [[King James Bible]].  In [[Philippians]] 4:6 in which the reader is urged not to worry and to make all his desires "known unto God" and in [[Acts of the Apostles]] 15:18 which states "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world" to explain the extent of God's power.<ref>{{cite web |title=Philippians 4:6 Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. |url=https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm |website=Bible Hub |accessdate=22 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Acts 15:18 that have been known for ages.' |url=https://biblehub.com/acts/15-18.htm |website=Bible Hub |accessdate=22 November 2018}}</ref>  Kipling's phrasing has been linked by at least one commentator to the [[Epistle to the Galatians]] 4:9 which in the King James version is rendered "But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God" and describes the nature of the personal relationship between the worshipper and the deity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Known Unto God |url=https://www.publicchristianity.org/known-unto-god/ |website=Centre for Public Christianity |accessdate=22 November 2018 |date=9 June 2013}}</ref>  Kipling is known to have taken phrases from the King James Bible for his works, including "[[Lest we forget (phrase)|lest we forget]]" (from [[Deuteronomy]] 6:12) in his 1897 work ''[[Recessional (poem)|Recessional]]'', which is now frequently used in remembrance services.<ref>{{cite web |title=Recessional |url=http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/rg_recess1.htm |website=The Kipling Society |accessdate=11 December 2018}}</ref>

Kipling also selected the phrasings "their glory shall not be blotted out" which is used on the headstones of those whose burial place was once known but was lost during the course of the war; "believed to be buried in this cemetery" which is used for individuals whose exact burial place is unknown but are known to be within a certain cemetery; "the glorious dead" which is used on [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall]] and "[[their name liveth for evermore]]" which is used on [[Stone of Remembrance|Stones of Remembrance]] in CWGC cemeteries.<ref>{{cite news |title=Plan for 'creepy' fake graves rejected |url=https://www.news-mail.com.au/news/discovered-document-uncovers-creepy-australian-fak/3570066/ |accessdate=22 November 2018 |work=News Mail |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Davies |first1=Caroline |title=Epitaphs for first world war fallen offer glimpse of unprecedented loss |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/23/epitaphs-for-first-world-war-fallen-offer-glimpse-of-unprecedented-loss |accessdate=22 November 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=23 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=keegan>{{cite news |last1=Keegan |first1=John |title=We'll miss our corners of a foreign field |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3625387/Well-miss-our-corners-of-a-foreign-field.html |accessdate=22 November 2018 |date=2 June 2006}}</ref>  The phrasing of the last is known to have been taken by Kipling from the [[Book of Ecclesiasticus]].<ref name=archive/>

== Legacy ==
Kipling is described as one of the three key figures in the development of the IWGC cemeteries, along with architect [[Edwin Lutyens]] and garden designer [[Gertrude Jekyll]].<ref name=keegan/>  He continued to be involved in the IWGC post-war, writing a description of the work of the commission in the 1919 book ''The Graves of the Fallen'' and also contributing a preface to a [[Thomas Cook & Son|Thomas Cook]] sales brochure describing the decorum that tourists should exhibit whilst visiting the cemeteries.<ref name=booth/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Richards |first1=David Alan |title=Rudyard Kipling: The Books I Leave Behind |date=2007 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300126747 |page=83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COxpyG54ufwC |accessdate=22 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

The phrase was used again by the CWGC for unknown graves of the 1939-45 war in which use it is preceded by the phrase "a soldier of the Second World War" or a variant thereof. It has been used on the gravestones of the British dead of the 1899–1901 [[Second Boer War]], for example at [[Spion Kop (mountain)|Spion Kop]] where some graves read: "A brave British soldier – known unto God", though these stones do not seem to be contemporary to the war.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maxwell |first1=Tony |title=Searching for the Queen's Cowboys: Travels in South Africa Filming a Documentary on Strathcona's Horse and the Anglo-Boer War |date=2009 |publisher=Tony Maxwell |isbn=9780968325612 |page=269 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrBU0Cjw6l0C |accessdate=22 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref>  The phrase continues to be used in modern works, for example a British poet included it as a line in a work to honour the dead of the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Passenger Known Unto God – Nation |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2014/08/22/a-passenger-known-unto-god/ |accessdate=22 November 2018 |work=The Star (Malaysia) |date=22 August 2014}}</ref>

To mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the First World War in 1993, an unknown Australian soldier from the CWGC Adelaide Cemetery at [[Villers-Bretonneux]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/2701/adelaide-cemetery,-villers-bretonneux/ |title=Adelaide Cemetery, Villers Bretonneux |publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission |accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref> was returned to Australia to establish a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the Hall of Memory of the [[Australian War Memorial]] (AWM) in Canberra.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/visit/visitor-information/features/hall-of-memory/tomb |title=Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier |publisher=[[Australian War Memorial]] |accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref> A eulogy was delivered by Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] at the re-interment, which included the words: "We do not know this Australian's name ... he has always been among those we have honoured ... We know that he was one of the 45,000 Australians who died on the Western Front ... He is all of them.

In 1999, the "Known unto God" phrase was added to the tomb, despite founding figure [[Charles Bean]]'s intention that there were to be no religious aspects to the memorial and the AWM always having been a secular institution.<ref name=abc/><ref name="ct2013">{{cite news |url=https://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/act/known-unto-god-to-remain-at-tomb-of-unknown-soldier-at-war-memorial-20131029-2wcnj.html |title='Known Unto God' to remain at Tomb of Unknown Soldier at War Memorial |first=Ross |last=Peake |date=29 October 2013 |work=[[The Canberra Times]] |accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref> In 2013 the AWM resolved to replace the phrase with words from Keating's eulogy. After some complaints about removal of the phrase, it was determined to retain it but to add the words to the tomb from the Keating eulogy: "He is all of them, and he is one of us".<ref name=abc/><ref name="ct2013"/>

== Variations ==
The [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Arlington)|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] in the United States bears a similar inscription "...known but to God", on the west panel.
