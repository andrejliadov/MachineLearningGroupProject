'''Secular morality''' is the aspect of philosophy that deals with [[morality]] outside of religious traditions. Modern examples include [[humanism]], [[freethinking]], and most versions of [[consequentialism]]. Additional philosophies with ancient roots include those such as [[skepticism]] and [[virtue ethics]]. [[Greg M. Epstein]] also states that, "much of ancient Far Eastern thought is deeply concerned with human goodness without placing much if any stock in the importance of gods or spirits."<ref name=Epstein2010>

Others eschew the idea that religion is required to provide a guide to right and wrong behavior. The ''Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' however states that religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other".<ref name=Childress/>{{rp|401}} Some believe that religions provide poor guides to moral behavior. Various commentators, such as [[Richard Dawkins]] (''[[The God Delusion]]''), [[Sam Harris]] (''[[The End of Faith]]'') and [[Christopher Hitchens]] (''[[God Is Not Great]]'') are among those who have asserted this view.

== Secular moral frameworks ==
=== Consequentialism ===
{{Main|Consequentialism}}

Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence. In his 2010 book, ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] describes a utilitarian [[science of morality]].

=== Freethought ===
{{Main|Freethought}}
Freethought is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] viewpoint that holds that [[opinion]]s should be formed on the basis of [[science]], [[logic]], and [[reason]], and should not be influenced by [[authority]], [[tradition]], or other [[dogma]]s. Freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of [[fact]]s, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and [[logic]]al principles, independent of any logical [[fallacy|fallacies]] or intellectually limiting effects of [[authority]], [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[prejudice]], [[sectarianism]], [[tradition]], [[urban legend]], and all other [[dogma]]s.

=== Secular humanism ===
{{Main|Secular humanism}}
Secular humanism focuses on the way human beings can lead [[Happiness|happy]] and functional lives.   It posits that human beings are capable of being ethical and moral without religion or [[God]], it neither assumes humans to be inherently [[Good and evil|evil]] or innately [[Good and evil|good]], nor presents humans as "above nature" or superior to it. Rather, the humanist life stance emphasizes the unique responsibility facing humanity and the ethical consequences of human decisions.  Fundamental to the concept of secular humanism is the strongly held viewpoint that ideology—be it religious or political—must be thoroughly examined by each individual and not simply accepted or rejected on faith. Along with this, an essential part of secular humanism is a continually adapting search for truth, primarily through [[science]] and [[philosophy]].

==Positions on religion and morality==
{{See also|Ethics in religion|Secular ethics}}
The subject of secular morality has been discussed by prominent secular scholars as well as popular culture-based [[atheism|atheist]] and [[antireligion|anti-religious]] writers. These include [[Paul Chamberlain]]'s ''Can We Be Good Without God?'' (1996), [[Richard Holloway]]'s '' Godless Morality: Keeping Religion Out of Ethics'' (1999), [[Robert Buckman]]'s ''Can We Be Good Without God?'' (2002), [[Michael Shermer]]'s ''[[The Science of Good and Evil]]'' (2004), [[Richard Dawkins]]'s ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), [[Christopher Hitchens]]'s ''[[God Is Not Great]]'' (2007), [[Greg Epstein|Greg Epstein's]] ''Good Without God: What A Billion Nonreligious People ''Do'' Believe'' (2010), and [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris's]] ''[[The Moral Landscape|The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values]]'' (2011).

=== "Morality does not require religious tenets" ===
According to Greg Epstein, "the idea that we can't be 'good without God'&thinsp;" has been with us for nearly 2,000 years.<ref name=Epstein2010/>{{rp|5}} Others suggest this idea goes back further; for example in [[Psalm 14]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] which according to [[Hermann Gunkel]] date to the exile period of approximately 580 BCE.<ref name="Hermann Gunkel p. 233"/> It states, "The fool says in his heart, 'there is no God.' They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good ... not even one."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.esvbible.org/Psalm+14/|title= Psalm 14 - ESVBible.org|author= ESVBible.org|publisher= Crossway|accessdate= 4 September 2012}}</ref>

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] famously declared [[God is Dead]] but also warned "When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident...Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole." <ref>{{cite book|last1=Nietzsche|first1=Friedrich|title=Twilight of the Idols, or, How to Philosophize with a Hammer|date=1889}}</ref>

This idea is still present today. "Many today&nbsp;... argue that religious beliefs are necessary to provide moral guidance and standards of virtuous conduct in an otherwise corrupt, materialistic, and degenerate world."<ref name=Dixon2008>

Proponents of theism argue that without a God or gods it is impossible to ''justify'' moral behavior on metaphysical grounds and thus to make a coherent case for abiding by moral standards. C. S. Lewis makes such an argument in ''Mere Christianity''. [[Peter Robinson (speechwriter)|Peter Robinson]], a political author and commentator with [[Stanford University|Stanford]]'s [[Hoover Institution]], has commented that, if an inner moral conscience is just another adaptive or evolved feeling in the human mind like simple emotional urges, then no inherent reason exists to consider morality as over and above other urges.<ref name=hoover/>
According to Thomas Dixon, "Religions certainly do provide a framework within which people can learn the difference between right and wrong."<ref name=Dixon2008/>

=== "Morality does not rely on religion" ===
{{Quote|"A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death."| [[Albert Einstein]], "Religion and Science," New York Times Magazine, 1930}}

Various commentators have stated that morality does not require religion as a guide. ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' states that, "it is not hard to imagine a society of people that has no religion but has a morality, as well as a legal system, just because it says that people cannot live together without rules against killing, etc., and that it is not desirable for these all to be legally enforced. There have also certainly been people who have had a morality but no religious beliefs."<ref name=Childress>

If they are, then one is already equipped with moral motivations, and the introduction of God adds nothing extra. But if they are not moral motives, then they will be motives of such a kind that they cannot appropriately motivate ''morality'' at all&nbsp;... we reach the conclusion that any appeal to God in this connection either adds to nothing at all, or it adds the wrong sort of thing."<ref name=Williams/>{{rp|64–65}}

[[Socrates]]' "[[Euthyphro dilemma]]" is often considered one of the earliest refutations of the idea that morality requires religion. This line of reasoning is described by Peter Singer:

{{quote|"Some theists say that ethics cannot do without religion because the very meaning of 'good' is nothing other than 'what God approves'. Plato refuted a similar claim more than two thousand years ago by arguing that if the gods approve of some actions it must be because those actions are good, in which case it cannot be the gods' approval that makes them good. The alternative view makes divine approval entirely arbitrary: if the gods had happened to approve of torture and disapprove of helping our neighbors, torture would have been good and helping our neighbors bad. Some modern theists have attempted to extricate themselves from this type of dilemma by maintaining that God is good and so could not possibly approve of torture; but these theists are caught in a trap of their own making, for what can they possibly mean by the assertion that God is good? That God is approved of by God?"<ref name=Singer2010/>{{rp|3–4}}}}

[[Greg Epstein]], a [[Secular humanism|Humanist]] [[chaplain]] at [[Harvard University]], dismisses the question of whether God is needed to be good "because that question does not need to be answered—it needs to be rejected outright," adding, "To suggest that one ''can't'' be good without belief in God is not just an opinion&nbsp;... it is a prejudice. It may even be discrimination."<ref name=Epstein2010/>{{rp|ix}} This is in line with the ''Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics'' which states that religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides."<ref name=Childress/>{{rp|401}} Others share this view. Singer states that morality "is not something intelligible only in the context of religion".<ref name=Singer2010/>{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Atheistic philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] stated that "there is nothing to stop atheists believing in morality, a meaning for life, or human goodness. Atheism is only intrinsically negative when it comes to belief about God. It is as capable of a positive view of other aspects of life as any other belief."<ref name=Baggini>{{cite book |title= Atheism: A Very Short Introduction|last= Baggini|first= Julian|year= 2003|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280424-2}}</ref>{{rp|3}} He also states that "Morality is more than possible without God, it is entirely independent of him.<!-- "Him" is not capitalized in Baggini's work --> That means atheists are not only more than capable of leading moral lives, they may even be able to lead more moral lives than religious believers who confuse [[Divine command theory|divine law]] and punishment with right and wrong.<ref name=Baggini/>{{rp|37}}

Popular atheist author and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' writer [[Christopher Hitchens]] remarked on the program ''[[Uncommon Knowledge]]'':
{{quote|"I think our knowledge of right and wrong is innate in us. Religion gets its morality from humans.

=== "Religion is a poor moral guide" ===
Popular atheist author and biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], writing in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', has stated that religious people have committed a wide variety of acts and held certain beliefs through history that are considered today to be morally repugnant. He has stated that [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|Nazis]] held broadly Christian religious beliefs that inspired the [[Holocaust]] on account of [[Christian antisemitism|antisemitic Christian]] doctrine, that Christians have traditionally imposed [[Christianity and women|unfair restrictions]] on the legal and civil rights of women, and that [[Slavery and Christianity|Christians have condoned slavery]] of some form or description throughout most of Christianity's history. Dawkins insists that, since Jewish and Christian interpretations of the Bible have changed over the span of history so that what was formerly seen as permissible is now seen as impermissible, it is intellectually dishonest for them to believe theism provides an absolute moral foundation apart from secular intuition. In addition, he argued that since Christians and other religious groups do not acknowledge the binding authority of all parts of their holy texts (e.g., The books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] state that those who work on the Sabbath<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bible.cc/exodus/31-15.htm|title= Exodus 31:15|author= Biblos.com|date= 2004–2011|publisher= Biblos.com|accessdate= 6 September 2012}} Exodus 35:2 is similarly worded.</ref> and those caught performing acts of homosexuality,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bible.cc/leviticus/20-13.htm|title= Leviticus 20:13|author= Biblos.com|date= 2004–2011|publisher= Biblos.com|accessdate= 6 September 2012}}</ref> respectively, were to be put to death.), they are already capable of distinguishing "right" from "wrong."<ref>

The well-known passage from [[Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky's]] ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', "If God is dead, all is permitted,"<ref name=Epstein2010/>{{rp|63}} suggests that non-believers would not hold moral lives without the possibility of punishment by a God. [[Greg M. Epstein]] notes a similar theme in reverse. Famous apologies by Christians who have "sinned" (such as [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Jimmy Swaggart]]) "must embolden some who take enormous risks for the thrill of a little immoral behavior: their Lord will forgive them, if they only ask nicely enough when—or if—they are eventually caught. If you're going to do something naughty, you're going to do it, and all the theology in the world isn't going to stop you."<ref name=Epstein2010/>{{rp|115–116}} Some survey and sociological literature suggests that theists do no better than their secular counterparts in the percentage adhering to widely held moral standards (e.g., lying, theft and sexual infidelity).{{Ref label|E|e|none}}

Some non-religious [[nihilism|nihilistic]] and [[existentialism|existentialist]] thinkers have affirmed the prominent theistic position that the existence of the personal God of theism is linked to the existence of an objective moral standard, asserting that questions of right and wrong inherently have no meaning and, thus, any notions of morality are nothing but an anthropogenic fantasy. Agnostic author and [[Absurdism|Absurdist]] philosopher [[Albert Camus]] discussed the issue of what he saw as the universe's indifference towards humankind and the meaninglessness of life in his prominent novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', in which the [[protagonist]] accepts [[capital punishment|death via execution]] without sadness or feelings of injustice. In his philosophical work, ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', Camus argues that human beings must choose to live defiantly in spite of their longing for purpose or direction and the apparent lack of evidence for God or moral imperatives.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The atheistic existentialist philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] proposed that the individual must create his own [[existence precedes essence|essence]] and therefore must freely and independently create his own subjective moral standards by which to live.
