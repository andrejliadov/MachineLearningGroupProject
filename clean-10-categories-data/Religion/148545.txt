The '''Holy Land''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אֶרֶץ הַקּוֹדֶשׁ}} {{transl|he|''Eretz HaKodesh''}}, {{lang-la|Terra Sancta}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|الأرض المقدسة}} {{transl|ar|''Al-Arḍ Al-Muqaddasah''}} or {{lang|ar|الديار المقدسة}} {{transl|ar|''Ad-Diyar Al-Muqaddasah''}}) is an area roughly located between the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] that also includes the Eastern Bank of the Jordan River. Traditionally, it is synonymous both with the biblical [[Land of Israel]] and with the [[Palestine (region)|region of Palestine]]. The term "Holy Land" usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern [[State of Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], western [[Jordan]], and parts of southern [[Lebanon]] and of southwestern [[Syria]]. [[Jews]], [[Christians]], and [[Muslim]]s all regard it as [[holy]].

Part of the significance of the land stems from the [[religious significance of Jerusalem]] (the holiest city to [[Judaism]]), as the historical region of [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus' ministry]], and as the site of the first [[Qibla]] of Islam, as well as the site of the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] event of {{circa}} 621 CE in [[Islam]].

The holiness of the land as a destination of [[Christian pilgrimage]] contributed to launching the [[Crusades]], as [[European Christians]] sought to win back the Holy Land from the Muslims, who had [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered it]] from the Christian [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 630s. In the 19th century, the Holy Land became the subject of diplomatic wrangling as [[holy places|the Holy Places]] played a role in the [[Eastern Question]] which led to the [[Crimean War]] in the 1850s.

Many sites in the Holy Land have long been [[pilgrimage]] destinations for adherents of the [[Abrahamic religions]], including Jews, Christians, Muslims, and [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼís]]. [[Pilgrim]]s visit the Holy Land to touch and see physical manifestations of their [[faith]], to confirm their [[belief]]s in the holy context with collective excitation,<ref>

Jews do not commonly refer to the [[Land of Israel]] as "Holy Land" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אֶרֶץ הַקוֹדֵשׁ}} {{transl|he|''Eretz HaKodesh''}}). The [[Tanakh]] explicitly refers to it as "holy land" in only one passage.<ref>{{bibleverse||Zechariah|2:16|HE}}</ref> The term "holy land" is further used twice in the [[deuterocanonical books]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Wisdom|12:3|NRSV}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||2 Maccabees|1:7|NRSV}}</ref> The holiness of the Land of Israel is generally implied in the Tanakh by the Land being given to the [[Israelites]] by God, that is, it is the "[[promised land]]", an integral part of [[Covenant (biblical)|God's covenant]]. In the [[Torah]], many [[mitzvot]] commanded to the Israelites can only be performed in the Land of Israel,<ref>Aharon Ziegler, ''Halakhic positions of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik: Volume 4'', KTAV Publishing House, 2007, p.173</ref> which serves to differentiate it from other lands. For example, in the Land of Israel, "no land shall be sold permanently" ({{Bibleverse|Lev|25:23}}). [[Shmita]] is only observed with respect to the Land of Israel, and the observance of many [[Jewish holiday|holy]] days is different, as an extra day is observed in the [[Jewish diaspora]].

According to [[Eliezer Schweid]]:
{{quote|The uniqueness of the Land of Israel is...'geo-theological' and not merely climatic. This is the land which faces the entrance of the spiritual world, that sphere of existence that lies beyond the physical world known to us through our senses. This is the key to the land's unique status with regard to prophecy and prayer, and also with regard to the commandments.<ref>''The Land of Israel: National Home Or Land of Destiny'', By Eliezer Schweid, Translated by Deborah Greniman, Published 1985 Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, {{ISBN|0-8386-3234-3}}, p.56.</ref>|sign=|source=}}

From the perspective of the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], the holiness of Israel had been concentrated since the sixteenth century, especially for burial, in the "[[Four Holy Cities]]": [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]], [[Safed]] and [[Tiberias]] – as [[Judaism]]'s holiest cities. Jerusalem, as the site of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], is considered especially significant.<ref name=1000BCE>

According to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem is Mount [[Moriah]], the location of the [[binding of Isaac]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions the name "[[Jerusalem]]" 669 times, often because many mitzvot can only be performed within its environs. The name "[[Zion]]", which usually refers to Jerusalem, but sometimes the Land of Israel, appears in the Hebrew Bible 154 times.

The [[Talmud]] mentions the religious duty of populating Israel.<ref name="Herzog1967">{{cite book|author=Isaac Herzog|title=The Main Institutions of Jewish Law: The law of obligations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eq3XAAAAMAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Soncino Press|page=51}}</ref> So significant in Judaism is the act of purchasing land in Israel, the Talmud allows for the lifting of certain religious restrictions of [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] observance to further its acquisition and settlement.<ref name="Zahavi1962">{{cite book|author=Yosef Zahavi|title=Eretz Israel in rabbinic lore (Midreshei Eretz Israel): an anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yK7hAAAAMAAJ|year=1962|publisher=Tehilla Institute|page=28|quote=If one buys a house from a non-Jew in Israel, the title deed may be written for him even on the Sabbath.

However, after suffering persecutions in Israel for centuries after the destruction of the Temple, Rabbis who had found it very difficult to retain their position moved to [[Babylon]], which offered them better protection.

[[File:Holy sepulchre mass.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] is one of the most important [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] sites in Christianity, as it is the purported site of Christ's resurrection.]]

For [[Christians]], the [[Land of Israel]] is considered holy because of its association with the [[Birth of Jesus|birth]], ministry, [[crucifixion]] and [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of [[Jesus]], whom Christians regard as the Savior or [[Messiah]]. It is also because Jesus was himself Jewish, and personally considered it the Holy Land within the original Jewish religious context.

Christian books, including many editions of the Bible, often have maps of the Holy Land (considered to be Galilee, Samaria, and Judea). For instance, the ''Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae'' ({{Lit|Travel book through Holy Scripture}}) of Heinrich Bünting (1545–1606), a German Protestant pastor, featured such a map.<ref name="wdl" /> His book was very popular, and it provided "the most complete available summary of biblical geography and described the geography of the Holy Land by tracing the travels of major figures from the Old and New testaments."<ref name="wdl">{{cite web|title=Description of the Holy Land|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2891/|website=[[World Digital Library]]|date=1585|language=German|author1=Bünting, Heinrich}}</ref>

As a geographic term, the description "Holy Land" loosely encompasses modern-day [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], [[Lebanon]], western [[Jordan]] and south-western [[Syria]].

In the [[Qur'an]], the term {{transl|ar|''Al-Ard Al-Muqaddasah''}} ({{lang-ar|'''الأرض المقدسة'''}}, {{lang-en|"Holy Land"}}) is used in a passage about [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] ([[Moses]]) proclaiming to the [[Children of Israel]]: "O my people! Enter the holy land which [[Allah]] hath assigned unto you, and turn not back ignominiously, for then will ye be overthrown, to your own ruin."{{Cite Quran|5|21}} The Quran also refers to the land as being 'Blessed'.<ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns">{{cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns}}</ref><ref name="Cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns">{{cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns}}</ref><ref name="Cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns">{{cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns}}</ref>

[[Jerusalem]] (referred to as ''Al-Quds,'' {{lang-ar|الـقُـدس}}, "The Holy") has particular significance in Islam. The Quran refers to [[Muhammad]]'s experiencing the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] as "a Journey by night from ''[[Masjid Al-Haram|Al-Masjidil-Haram]]'' to ''[[Masjid Al-Aqsa|Al-Masjidil-Aqsa]]'', whose precincts We did bless ...".{{Cite Quran|17|1}}<ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"/> ''[[Ahadith]]'' infer that the "Farthest Masjid" is in Al-Quds; for example, as narrated by [[Abu Huraira]]h: "On the night journey of the Apostle of Allah, two cups, one containing wine and the other containing milk, were presented to him at Al-Quds (Jerusalem). He looked at them and took the cup of milk. Angel Gabriel said, 'Praise be to Allah, who guided you to Al-Fitrah (the right path); if you had taken (the cup of) wine, your ''[[Ummah]]'' would have gone astray'." [[Jerusalem]] was Islam's first ''Qiblah'' (direction of prayer) in Muhammad's lifetime, however, this was later changed to the [[Kaaba]] in the [[Hijaz]]i city of [[Mecca]], following a revelation to Muhammad by the Archangel [[Jibril]].<ref name="Cite quran|2|142|e=177|s=ns">{{cite quran|2|142|e=177|s=ns}}</ref> The current construction of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque|Al-Aqsa mosque]], which lies on the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem, is dated to the early Umayyad period of rule in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Architectural historian [[K. A. C. Creswell]], referring to a testimony by [[Arculf]], a [[Gaul|Gallic]] monk, during his pilgrimage to Palestine in 679–82, notes the possibility that the second [[caliph]] of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], erected a primitive quadrangular building for a capacity of 3,000 worshipers somewhere on the Haram ash-Sharif. However, Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of [[Mu'awiyah I]], and it is possible that Mu'awiyah ordered the construction, not Umar. This latter claim is explicitly supported by the early Muslim scholar al-Muthahhar bin Tahir.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Elad, Amikam.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/30399668|title=Medieval Jerusalem and Islamic worship : holy places, ceremonies, pilgrimage|date=1995|publisher=E.J.

The exact region referred to as being 'blessed' in the Qur'an, in verses like {{Cite quran|17|1|expand=no|style=nosup}}, {{Cite quran|21|71|expand=no|style=nosup}} and {{Cite quran|34|18|expand=no|style=nosup}},<ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"/><ref name="Cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns"/><ref name="Cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns"/> has been interpreted differently by various scholars. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] likens it to a wide land-range including [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], especially the cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]]; Az-Zujaj describes it as, ''"[[Damascus]], Palestine, and a bit of [[Jordan]]"''; [[Muadh ibn Jabal]] as, ''"the area between [[al-Arish]] and the [[Euphrates]]"''; and [[Ibn Abbas]] as, ''"the land of [[Jericho]]"''.<ref>Ali (1991), p. 934</ref> This overall region is referred to as "[[Ash-Shām]]" ({{lang-ar|الـشَّـام}}).<ref name="Volume 9 1997 page 261">Article "AL-SHĀM" by [[C.E.

In his writings he set the slope of [[Mount Carmel]] to host the [[Shrine of the Báb]] which his appointed successor [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] erected in 1909 as a beginning of the [[Terraces (Baháʼí)|terraced gardens]] there. The Head of the religion after him, [[Shoghi Effendi]], began building other structures and the [[Universal House of Justice]] continued the work until the [[Baháʼí World Centre]] was brought to its current state as the spiritual and administrative centre of the religion.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Jay D.
