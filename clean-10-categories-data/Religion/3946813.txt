'''Prehistoric religions''' are the [[religion|religious beliefs and practices]] of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] peoples. The term may cover [[Paleolithic religion]], [[Mesolithic]] religion, [[#Neolithic|Neolithic religion]] and [[Bronze Age religion (disambiguation) | Bronze Age religions]].

==Paleolithic==
{{Main|Paleolithic religion}}
 
Intentional [[burial]], particularly with [[grave goods]], may be one of the earliest detectable forms of religious practice (the onset of burial itself being a canonical indicator of [[behavioral modernity]]) since, as [[Philip Lieberman]] suggests, it may signify a "concern for the dead that transcends daily life".<ref name="lieberman">{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&pg=PA162 | title= Uniquely Human|isbn=0-674-92183-6| year= 1991| authorlink= Philip Lieberman| last1= Lieberman| first1= Philip}}</ref>

A number of archeologists propose that Middle Paleolithic societies such as [[Neanderthal]] societies may also have practiced early forms of [[totemism]] or of [[animal worship]]. Emil Bächler in particular suggests (based on archeological evidence from Middle Paleolithic caves) that a widespread [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Neanderthal]] [[bear cult|bear-cult]] existed ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&nbsp;434-435).  A claim that evidence was found for [[Middle Paleolithic]] animal worship [[circa|c]] 70,000 BCE (originating from the [[Tsodilo Hills]] in the African Kalahari desert) has been denied by the original investigators of the site.<ref>World's Oldest Ritual Discovered -- Worshipped The Python 70,000 Years Ago The Research Council of Norway (2006, November 30).

Animal worship during the Upper Paleolithic intertwined with hunting rites.<ref name="Narr"/> For instance, archeological evidence from [[Paleolithic art]]  and from bear remains reveals that the bear cult apparently had a type of sacrificial bear ceremonialism in which a bear was shot with [[arrow]]s, then finished off with a shot in the lungs and ritualistically buried near a clay bear-statue covered by a bear fur, with the skull and the body of the bear buried separately.<ref name="Narr"/>

==Neolithic==
There are no extant textual sources from the [[Neolithic]] era, the most recent available dating from the [[Bronze Age]], and therefore all statements about any [[belief system]]s Neolithic societies may have possessed are glimpsed from archaeology.

[[Jacques Cauvin]] suggested that the [[Neolithic Revolution]] was influenced by an important theme he termed the "[[Jacques Cauvin#The Revolution of the Symbols|Revolution of the Symbols]]", suggesting the birth of "religion" in the Neolithic. He argued that Neolithic humans were influenced by a change in thinking as much as changes in the environment and noted a series of stages in this process.<ref name="Aurenche">Olivier Aurenche, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/paleo_0153-9345_2001_num_27_2_4728 Jacques Cauvin et la préhistoire du Levant], Paléorient, Volume 27, Number 27-2, pp. 5-11, 2001.</ref> His work suggested important concepts in the evolution of human thinking; by examining figurines and early art depicting women as goddesses and bulls as gods, he developed several important ideas about the evolution of perception and duality.<ref name="CauvinWatkins2000">{{cite book|author1=Jacques Cauvin|author2=Trevor Watkins|title=The birth of the Gods and the origins of agriculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4epGQpNyucC|accessdate=1 April 2011|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65135-6}}</ref>

The structures known as [[circular enclosure (archaeology)|Circular Enclosures]] built in Central Europe during the 5th millennium BCE have been interpreted as serving a cultic function. In the case of the [[Goseck circle]], remains of [[human sacrifice]] were found. Many of these structures had openings aligned with sunset and/or sunrise at the [[solstice]]s, suggesting that they served as a means of maintaining a [[lunisolar calendar]]. The construction of [[Megalithic]] monuments in Europe also began in the 5th millennium, and continued throughout the Neolithic and in some areas well into the early Bronze Age.

[[Marija Gimbutas]], pioneer of [[feminist archaeology]], put forward a notion of a "woman-centered" society surrounding "goddess worship" in [[Neolithic Europe]]. The Neolithic "matristic" cultures would have been replaced by [[patriarchy]] only with the arrival of the [[Bronze Age]]. Gimbutas' views on this matter do not have widespread support today.<ref>Archaeologist Sarah M. Nelson criticizes Gimbutas suggesting that she used the same techniques used in the past to disparage women but in this case to glorify them, and quotes another archaeologist, Pamela Russell, as saying "The archaeological evidence is, in some cases, distorted enough to make a careful prehistorian shudder".

==Bronze Age==
{{Main|Religions of the ancient Near East|Minoan religion|Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Ancient Egyptian religion}}

===Reconstructions===
The early [[Bronze Age]] [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] (itself [[historical linguistics|reconstructed]]), and the attested early [[Semitic gods]], are presumed continuations of certain traditions of the late Neolithic.

====Bronze Age Europe====
Hints to the religion of [[Bronze Age Europe]] include images of [[solar barge]]s, frequent appearance of the [[Sun cross]], deposits of bronze [[axe]]s, and later [[sickle]]s, so-called [[moon idol]]s, the conical [[golden hat]]s, the [[Nebra skydisk]], and burial in [[tumulus|tumuli]], but also [[cremation]] as practised by the [[Urnfield culture]].

==Iron Age==
{{Further|Axial Age}}
While the [[Iron Age]] religions of the [[Mediterranean]], [[Near East]], [[Iron Age India|India]] and [[Iron Age China|China]] are well attested in written sources, much of [[Iron Age Europe]], from the period of about 700 BCE down to the [[Migration Period|Great Migrations]], falls within the prehistoric period. There are scarce accounts of non-Mediterranean religious customs in the records of Hellenistic and Roman era [[Greek ethnography|ethnography]].
*[[Scythian mythology]] ([[Herodotus]])
*[[Indian mythology (disambiguation)|Indian mythology]]
*[[Celtic polytheism]] ([[Posidonius]])
*[[Paleo-Balkan mythology]]
*[[Germanic polytheism]] ([[Tacitus]])
*[[Slavic polytheism]] ([[Procopius]])
*[[Mythology of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples]]

In the case of Circumpolar religion ([[Shamanism in Siberia]], [[Finnic mythology]]), [[traditional African religions]], [[native American religions]] and [[Pacific religions]], the prehistoric era mostly ends only with the [[Early Modern period]] and European [[colonialism]]. These traditions were often only first recorded in the context of [[Christianization]].

For these reasons, the interpretations and understanding of the Iron Age cult in Europe has to rely primarily on archaeological material.
