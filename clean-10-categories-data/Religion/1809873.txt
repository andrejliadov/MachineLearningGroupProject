}}
'''John Marco Allegro''' (17 February 1923 – 17 February 1988) was an English [[archaeologist]] and [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] scholar. He was a populariser of the Dead Sea Scrolls through his books and radio broadcasts. He was the editor of some of the most famous and controversial scrolls published, the ''[[pesher|pesharim]]''. A number of Allegro's later books, including ''[[The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross]]'', brought him both popular fame and notoriety, and also destroyed his career.

==Training==
Allegro went through [[grammar school]] in 1939. He joined the [[Royal Navy]], serving during World War Two. After the war he began training for the [[Methodist]] ministry, but found that he was more interested in Hebrew and Greek, so he went to study at Manchester University with fees paid by government grant due to his military service.<ref>{{cite book|author=Weston W. Fields|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls, A Full History|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|year=2009|volume=1|isbn=978-9004175815|pages=212–213}}</ref> Allegro received his Honours degree in Oriental Studies at the [[Manchester University|University of Manchester]] in 1951. This was followed in 1952 by a [[masters degree]] under supervision of [[H. H. Rowley]]. While engaged in further research in Hebrew dialects at Oxford under [[Godfrey Driver]] in 1953, Allegro was invited by [[Gerald Lankester Harding]] to join the team of scholars working on the Dead Sea Scrolls in Jerusalem, where he spent one year working on the scrolls. He became a lecturer in Comparative Semitic Philology in Manchester in 1954.<ref name="css">Philip R. Davies, "John Allegro and the Copper Scroll" in {{cite book |editor=George J.

==The Copper Scroll==
It was on Allegro's recommendation in 1955 that the [[Copper Scroll]] was sent by the Jordanian government to Manchester University in order for it to be cut into sections, allowing the text to be read. He was present during the cutting process in 1956 and later made a preliminary transcription of the text, which he soon translated, sending copies of his work back to Gerald Lankester Harding in Jordan.<ref>Judah K.

Milik]] by [[Roland de Vaux]], the editor in chief of the scrolls.<ref>{{cite book|author=Norman Golb|title=Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York|year=1995|page=164}}</ref> While he was in England he made a series of radio broadcasts on [[BBC]] Radio aimed at popularising the scrolls, in which he announced that the leader discussed in the scrolls may have been crucified.<ref name="css"/> He posited that the [[Teacher of Righteousness]] had been martyred and crucified by [[Alexander Jannaeus]], and that his followers believed he would reappear at the [[End time]] as [[Messiah]], based on [[Qumran]] document [[Nahum Commentary|Commentary on Nahum]] 1.4–9<ref>[[James VanderKam]], Peter Flint, ''The Meaning of The Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding The Bible, Judaism, Jesus and Christianity'', pp. 323–324 (T & T Clark International, 2002). {{ISBN|056708468X}}, also in [[Time (magazine)|Time]], Volume 67, Issue 6 (6 February 1956), article entitled "Religion: Crucifixion Before Christ" [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893345,00.html]</ref> (a position that he re-iterated in 1986<ref>[[R. Joseph Hoffmann]], [[Gerald A. Larue]]; Eds, ''Jesus in History and Myth'' (Prometheus Books, 1986) {{ISBN|978-0879753320}}</ref>). His colleagues in Jerusalem immediately responded with a letter to the Times on 16 March 1956 refuting his claim.<ref name="css"/> The letter concluded,

:"It is our conviction that either he [Allegro] has misread the texts or he has built up a chain of conjectures which the materials do not support."<ref>Philip R. Davies, "John Allegro and the Copper Scroll" in {{cite book |editor=George J. Brooke |editor2=Philip R. Davies|title=Copper Scroll Studies|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|year=2002|isbn=0826460550|page=33}}</ref>

One result of this letter seemed to be that his appointment at Manchester was not to be renewed.<ref>This was Allegro's view, stated in a letter to [[John Strugnell]] dated 6 February 1957, cited in {{cite book|author=Judith Anne Brown|title=John Marco Allegro: The Maverick Of The Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.]] |location=Grand Rapids|year=2005|isbn=0802828493|page=106}}</ref> However, in July after several uneasy months the appointment was renewed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Judith Anne Brown|title=John Marco Allegro: The Maverick Of The Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=William B Eerdmans Publishing Co|location=Grand Rapids|year=2005|isbn=0802828493|page=107}}</ref>

Allegro was asked a number of times by the Jordanian Director of Antiquities if he would publish the text of the Copper Scroll.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Marco Allegro|title=The Treasure of the Copper Scroll|publisher=Doubleday & Co|location=New York|year=1960|page=6}}</ref> After a few years of waiting for Milik's publication of the scroll, Allegro succumbed and set about publishing the text.<ref name="dsse">Philip R. Davies, "John Marco Allegro", in {{cite book |editor=Lawrence H. Schiffman |editor2=James C. VanderKam|title=Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=Oxford|year=2000|volume=1|isbn=0195137965|page=18}}</ref> His book, ''The Treasure of the Copper Scroll'', was released in 1960, while the official publication had to wait another two years. Although several of his readings in the text are acknowledged, Allegro's book was disparaged by his colleagues.<ref name="dssuk">George J. Brooke, "Dead Sea Scrolls Scholarship in the United Kingdom", in {{cite book|editor=Devorah Dimant|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls in Scholarly Perspective: A History of Research|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|year=2012|isbn=978-9004208063|page=457}}</ref> He believed that the treasure in the scroll was real—a view now held by most scholars<ref name="dssuk" />—and led an expedition to attempt to find items mentioned in the scroll, though without success.

During this period Allegro also published two popular books on the Dead Sea scrolls, ''The Dead Sea Scrolls'' (1956) and ''The People of the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (1958). He was keen to photograph the site of Qumran and various texts, providing an important source of information for posterity.<ref name="dsse" />

==Publishing the Pesharim==
Allegro was entrusted with the publication of 4Q158–4Q186, a collection of fragments which mainly contained exemplars of a unique kind of commentary on biblical works known as ''[[pesher|pesharim]]''. He believed that it was necessary to get these works out as quickly as possible<ref name="gb458">George J. Brooke, "Dead Sea Scrolls Scholarship in the United Kingdom", in {{cite book|editor=Devorah Dimant|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls in Scholarly Perspective: A History of Research|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|year=2012|isbn=978-9004208063|page=458}}</ref> and published several preliminary editions in learned journals during the late 1950s. He told de Vaux that he could have his share of the texts ready in 1960, but due to hold ups had to wait until 1968 for his volume, ''Discoveries in the Judaean Desert of Jordan V: 4Q158–4Q186'', to be published.<ref>{{cite book|author=Judith Anne Brown|title=John Marco Allegro: The Maverick Of The Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=William B Eerdmans Publishing Co|location=Grand Rapids|year=2005|isbn=0802828493|page=152}}</ref> He reworked his material in 1966 with the assistance of a Manchester colleague, Arnold Anderson, before publication.<ref name="dsse" /> He stated in the volume that

:"it has been my practice to offer no more than the basic essentials of photographs, transliteration, translation of non-biblical passages where this might serve some useful interpretative purpose, and the minimum of textual notes."<ref>Cited in {{cite book|author=Judith Anne Brown|title=John Marco Allegro: The Maverick Of The Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=William B Eerdmans Publishing Co|location=Grand Rapids|year=2005|isbn=0802828493|page=155}}</ref>

[[John Strugnell]] published a severe critique of the volume, "Notes en Marge du volume V des 'Discoveries in the Judean Desert of Jordan'" in ''Revue de Qumran''. Allegro's minimalist approach has received widespread scorn in the scholarly world, which nevertheless had the opportunity to analyse the Allegro texts for decades while waiting for other editors to publish their allotments. The first part of Strugnell's allotment was published in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orion.mscc.huji.ac.il/resources/djd/X.html|work=Orion Center|title=Discoveries in the Judaean Desert: X|accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref>

==Change of direction==
As early as 1956 Allegro held controversial views regarding the content of the scrolls, stating in a letter to de Vaux, "It's a pity that you and your friends cannot conceive of anything written about Christianity without trying to grind some ecclesiastical or non-ecclesiastical axe." The bulk of his work on the Dead Sea Scrolls was done by 1960 and he was at odds with his scrolls colleagues. When a conflict broke out with H.H. Rowley concerning Allegro's interpretation of the scrolls,<ref>{{cite book|author=Judith Anne Brown|title=John Marco Allegro: The Maverick Of The Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=William B Eerdmans Publishing Co|location=Grand Rapids|year=2005|isbn=0802828493|page=182}}</ref> Allegro, on the invitation of [[F.F. Bruce]], moved from the Department of Near East Studies in the Faculty of Arts at Manchester to the Faculty of Theology.<ref name="gb458" /> It was during his stay in Theology that he wrote his controversial book, ''[[The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross]]'', whose subtitle was "A Study of the Nature and Origins of Christianity within the Fertility Cults of the Ancient Near East". Apparently realising the impact this book would have, Allegro resigned his post at Manchester.<ref name="gb458" />

==The ''Sacred Mushroom'' and ''Christian Myth''==

Allegro's book ''[[The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross]]'' (1970) argued that Christianity began as a [[shamanism|shamanistic]] cult. In his books ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' and ''[[The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth]]'' (1979), Allegro put forward the theory that stories of early Christianity originated in an [[Essene]] clandestine cult centred around the use of [[Psychedelic experience|psychedelic]] mushrooms, and that the ''New Testament'' is the coded record of this shamanistic cult.<ref>John Allegro, ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' 1970 {{ISBN|978-0-9825562-7-6}}</ref><ref>John Allegro ''The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth'' 1979 {{ISBN|978-0-879-75757-1}}</ref> Allegro further argued that the authors of the Christian gospels did not understand the Essene thought. When writing down the Gospels based on the stories they had heard, the evangelists confused the meaning of the scrolls. In this way, according to Allegro, the Christian tradition is based on a misunderstanding of the scrolls.<ref name=Meaning323/><ref name=Taylor305>''The Essenes, the Scrolls, and the Dead Sea'' by Joan E. Taylor (Dec 14, 2012) {{ISBN|019955448X}} Oxford University Press p. 305</ref> He also argued that the story of Jesus was based on the crucifixion of the [[Teacher of Righteousness]] in the scrolls.<ref>[[Robert E. Van Voorst]] ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence'' Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}} p. 77</ref> Mark Hall writes that Allegro suggested the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] all but proved that a historical Jesus never existed.<ref>Hall, Mark. "Foreword," in Allegro, John M. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls & the Christian Myth''. Prometheus 1992, first published 1979, p. ix.</ref>

Allegro argued that Jesus in the ''[[Gospels]]'' was in fact a [[code]] for a type of [[psychedelic drug|hallucinogen]], the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', and that Christianity was the product of an ancient "sex-and-mushroom" cult.<ref name=Meaning>''The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls'' by Peter Flint and James VanderKam (10 July 2005) {{ISBN|056708468X}} T&T Clark pp. 323–325</ref><ref name=MidE82>''A History of the Middle East'' by [[Saul S. Friedman]] (15 March 2006) {{ISBN|0786423560}} page 82</ref> Critical reaction was swift and harsh: fourteen British scholars (including Allegro's mentor at Oxford, Godfrey Driver) denounced it.<ref name=Meaning/> Sidnie White Crawford wrote of the publication of ''Sacred Mushroom'', "Rightly or wrongly, Allegro would never be taken seriously as a scholar again."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sidnie White Crawford|year=2006|title=Review of Judith Anne Brown, ''John Marco Allegro: The Maverick of the Dead Sea Scrolls''|journal=Catholic Biblical Quarterly|volume=68|issue=4|page=725}}</ref>

Allegro's theory of a shamanistic cult as the origin of Christianity was criticised sharply by Welsh historian [[Philip Jenkins]] who wrote that Allegro was an eccentric scholar who relied on texts that did not exist in quite the form he was citing them. Jenkins called the ''Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' "possibly the single most ludicrous book on Jesus scholarship by a qualified academic".<ref>Jenkins, Philip. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv6x5kTHGvsC&pg=PA180 ''Hidden Gospels'']. Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 180.</ref> Based on the reactions to the book, Allegro's publisher later apologized for issuing the book and Allegro was forced to resign his academic post.<ref name=Meaning323>''The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls'' by Peter Flint and James VanderKam (Jul 10, 2005) {{ISBN|056708468X}} T&T Clark pp. 323-325</ref><ref name=MidE82/> A 2006 article discussing Allegro's work called for his theories to be re-evaluated by the mainstream.<ref>[http://www.egodeath.com/WassonEdenTree.htm Hoffman, Michael., ed. by Dr. Robert Price., "Wasson and Allegro on the Tree of Knowledge as Amanita" in Journal of Higher Criticism, 2006.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814053612/http://egodeath.com/WassonEdenTree.htm |date=14 August 2007 }}</ref> In November 2009 ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross'' was reprinted in a 40th anniversary edition with a 30-page addendum by [[Carl A.
