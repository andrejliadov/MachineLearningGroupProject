'''Daniel H. Bays''' (1942 &ndash; May 9, 2019) was an American [[historian]] of [[China]], best known for his works on [[Christianity in China]].

== Biography ==
Bays was born in 1942 in [[St. Joseph, Michigan]], received his B.A. in history from [[Stanford University]] in 1964, an M.A. in [[Sinology|Far Eastern studies]] from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1967, and a PhD in history of modern China from the University of Michigan in 1971.<ref name="calvin">{{cite web|url=https://calvin.edu/directory/people/daniel-bays|title=Daniel Bays|website=Calvin College|language=en|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608132520/http://www.calvin.edu/directory/people/daniel-bays|archivedate=8 June 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref> His PhD dissertation was on the Chinese politician [[Zhang Zhidong]] in the midst of China's late-imperial quest for modernity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bays |first1=Daniel H. |title=China Enters the Twentieth Century: Chang Chih-Tung and the Issues of a New Age, 1895-1909 |date=2016 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor, MI |isbn=9780472750184 |edition=revised |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJkbMQAACAAJ |language=en}}</ref>

After completing his PhD, Bays took up a post teaching history at the [[University of Kansas]], directing the Center for East Asian Studies and becoming a full professor in 1985.<ref>{{Cite document|title=Personal Papers of Daniel Bays (1970&ndash;2001)|last=Bays|first=Daniel H.|hdl = 10407/3686006845}}</ref> After working there for thirty years, in 2000, Bays moved to the History Department of [[Calvin College]], where he held the [[William Spoelhof|Spoelhof]] chair from 2000–2002.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://obituaries.ljworld.com/obituaries/ljworld/obituary.aspx?n=daniel-bays&pid=192886449|title=Obituary: Dr. Daniel Bays|date=15 May 2019|website=Lawrence Journal-World|access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://calvin.edu/offices-services/provost/endowed-chairs/spoelhofchair.html|title=Office of the Provost: The William Spoelhof Teacher-Scholar-in-Residence Chair|website=Calvin College|language=en|access-date=15 May 2019}}</ref> He retired from Calvin College in 2012 and was appointed as [[Emeritus|professor emeritus]], though he relocated with his wife Janice to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].<ref name="calvin" />

In 1984, when Bays was a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholar]] in Taiwan, he received a letter from the historian of China, [[John K. Fairbank]], who encouraged him to conduct a more systematic study of [[Christianity in China]], a topic Bays had recently begun work on. This would lead to his launch of the History of Christianity in China Project, which resulted in the edited volume ''Christianity in China: From the Eighteenth Century to the Present'', published in 1996.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAXnnu1oFhUC|title=Christianity in China: From the Eighteenth Century to the Present|date=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804736510|editor1-last=Bays|editor1-first=Daniel H.|location=Stanford, CA|pages=vii, ix, xiii|language=en}}</ref>

Bays died on May 9, 2019, after a lengthy battle with [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://calvin.edu/news/archive/calvin-remembers-daniel-bays|title= Calvin Remembers Daniel Bays|website=Calvin College|date=17 May 2019|access-date=17 May 2019}}</ref><!--The article was published on May 17, however the article say 19th.
