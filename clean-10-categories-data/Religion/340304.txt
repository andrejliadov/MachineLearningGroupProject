A '''totem''' ([[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] ''[[doodem]]'') is a spirit being, sacred object, or symbol that serves as an emblem of a group of [[people]], such as a [[family]], [[clan]], [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]], or [[tribe]].

While the term ''totem'' is derived from the North American [[Ojibwe]] language, belief in [[Tutelary deity|tutelary spirits and deities]] is not limited to [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] but common to a number of cultures worldwide.

Contemporary [[Neoshamanism|neoshamanic]], [[New Age]], and [[mythopoetic men's movement]]s not otherwise involved in the practice of a tribal religion have been known to use "totem" terminology for the personal identification with a tutelary spirit or [[spirit guide]]. However, this can be seen as [[cultural misappropriation]].<ref name="Aldred">Aldred, Lisa, "Plastic Shamans and Astroturf Sun Dances: New Age Commercialization of Native American Spirituality" in: ''The American Indian Quarterly'' 24.3 (2000) pp. 329–352.

Totemism is a [[belief]] associated with [[animism|animistic]] religions. The totem is usually an animal or other natural figure that spiritually represents a group of related people such as a clan.

Early anthropologists and ethnologists like [[James George Frazer]], [[Alfred Cort Haddon]], [[John Ferguson McLennan]] and [[W. H. R. Rivers]] identified totemism as a shared practice across indigenous groups in unconnected parts of the world, typically reflecting a stage of human development.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" />

Scottish [[ethnologist]] [[John Ferguson McLennan]], following the vogue of 19th-century research, addressed totemism in a broad perspective in his study ''The Worship of Animals and Plants'' (1869, 1870).<ref name=MacLennan1>MacLennan, J., ''The worship of animals and plants'', ''[[Fortnightly Review]], vol. 6-7 (1869-1870)</ref><ref name="Wolfe1998">{{cite book|author=Patrick Wolfe|title=Settler Colonialism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdhnThYIgGAC&pg=PA112|accessdate=4 December 2012|date=22 December 1998|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|isbn=978-0-304-70340-1|pages=111–}}</ref> McLennan did not seek to explain the specific origin of the totemistic phenomenon but sought to indicate that all of the human race had, in [[ancient times]], gone through a totemistic stage.<ref name=MacLennan1/>

Another Scottish scholar, [[Andrew Lang]], early in the 20th century, advocated a [[Nominalism|nominalistic]] explanation of totemism, namely, that local groups or clans, in selecting a totemistic name from the realm of nature, were reacting to a need to be differentiated.<ref name=Lang>Andrew Lang A., ''Method in the Study of Totemism'' (1911)</ref> If the origin of the name was forgotten, Lang argued, there followed a mystical relationship between the object — from which the name was once derived — and the groups that bore these names. Through nature myths, animals and natural objects were considered as the relatives, patrons, or ancestors of the respective social units.<ref name=Lang/>

British anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]] published ''Totemism and Exogamy'' in 1910, a four-volume work based largely on his research among [[Indigenous Australians]] and [[Indigenous peoples of Oceania|Melanesians]], along with a compilation of the work of other writers in the field.<ref name=Frazer1>''Totemism and Exogamy. A Treatise on Certain Early Forms of Superstition and Society'' (1911-1915)</ref>

By 1910, the idea of totemism as having common properties across cultures was being challenged, with Russian American ethnologist [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]] subjecting totemistic phenomena to sharp criticism. Goldenweiser compared Indigenous Australians and [[First Nations in British Columbia]] to show that the supposedly shared qualities of totemism - exogamy, naming, descent from the totem, taboo, ceremony, reincarnation, guardian spirits and secret societies and art - were actually expressed very differently between Australia and British Columbia, and between different peoples in Australia and between different peoples in British Columbia. He then expands his analysis to other groups to show that they share some of the customs associated with totemism, without having totems. He concludes by offering two general definitions of totemism, one of which is: "Totemism is the tendency of definite social units to become associated with objects and symbols of emotional value".<ref name=":3">Goldenweiser A., ''Totemism; An analytical study'', 1910</ref>

The founder of a French school of sociology, [[Émile Durkheim]], examined totemism from a [[sociological]] and theological point of view, attempting to discover a pure religion in very ancient forms and claimed to see the [[origin of religion]] in totemism.<ref>Durkheim E., ''Totémisme'' (1910)</ref>

The leading representative of British social anthropology, [[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]], took a totally different view of totemism. Like [[Franz Boas]], he was skeptical that totemism could be described in any unified way. In this he opposed the other pioneer of social anthropology in England, [[Bronisław Malinowski]], who wanted to confirm the unity of totemism in some way and approached the matter more from a biological and psychological point of view than from an ethnological one. According to Malinowski, totemism was not a cultural phenomenon, but rather the result of trying to satisfy basic human needs within the natural world. As far as Radcliffe-Brown was concerned, totemism was composed of elements that were taken from different areas and institutions, and what they have in common is a general tendency to characterize segments of the community through a connection with a portion of nature. In opposition to Durkheim's theory of sacralization, Radcliffe-Brown took the point of view that nature is introduced into the social order rather than secondary to it. At first, he shared with Malinowski the opinion that an animal becomes totemistic when it is “good to eat.” He later came to oppose the usefulness of this viewpoint, since many totems—such as crocodiles and flies—are dangerous and unpleasant.<ref name=Radcliffe-Brown1>Radcliffe-Brown A., ''Structure and Function in Primitive Society'', 1952</ref>

In 1938, the [[Structural functionalism|structural functionalist]] anthropologist [[A. P. Elkin]] wrote ''The Australian Aborigines: How to understand them.'' His typologies of totemism included eight "forms" and six "functions".<ref name=":2" />

The forms identified were:

* individual (a personal totem), 
* sex (one totem for each gender), 
* moiety (the "tribe" consists of two groups, each with a totem), 
* section (the "tribe" consists of four groups, each with a totem), 
* subsection (the "tribe" consists of eight groups, each with a totem),
* clan (a group with common descent share a totem or totems), 
* local (people living or born in a particular area share a totem) and 
* "multiple" (people across groups share a totem

The functions identified were:

* social (totems regulate marriage, and often a person cannot eat the flesh of their totem), 
* cult (totems associated with a secret organisation), 
* conception (multiple meanings), 
* dream (the person appears as this totem in others' dreams),
* classificatory (the totem sorts people) and 
* assistant (the totem assists a healer or clever person). 

The terms in Elkin's typologies see some use today, but Aboriginal customs are seen as more diverse than his typologies suggest.<ref name=":2" />

As a chief representative of modern [[structuralism]], French ethnologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], and his, ''Le Totémisme aujourd'hui'' ("Totemism Today" [1958])<ref name="L-S1">(Lévi-Strauss C., ''Le Totémisme aujourd'hui''(1958); english  trans.  as  ''Totemism'', by [[Rodney Needham]]. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963</ref> are often cited in the field.

In the 21st century, Australian anthropologists question the extent to which "totemism" can be generalised even across different [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal Australian]] peoples, let alone to other cultures like the [[Ojibwe]] from whom the term was originally derived. Rose, James and Watson write that:<ref name=":2" />

===Literature===
Poets, and to a lesser extent fiction writers, often use anthropological concepts, including the anthropological understanding of totemism. For this reason, literary criticism often resorts to psychoanalytic, anthropological analyses.<ref name=Maryniak>Maryniak, Irena.

Early anthropologists sometimes attributed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander totemism to ignorance about procreation, with the entrance of an ancestral spirit individual (the "totem") into the woman believed to be the cause of pregnancy (rather than [[insemination]]). [[James George Frazer]] in ''Totemism and Exogamy'' wrote that Aboriginal people "have no idea of procreation as being directly associated with sexual intercourse, and firmly believe that children can be born without this taking place".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Th_jlN06nPYC&q=Totemism+and+Exogamy+indigenous+people+procreation&pg=PA191|title=Totemism and Exogamy - A Treatise on Certain Early Forms of Superstition and Society|last=Frazer|first=James George|date=2011|publisher=SEVERUS Verlag|isbn=9783863471071|pages=191–192|language=en}}</ref> Frazer's thesis has been criticised by other anthropologists,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B040KquZAEIC&pg=PA21|title=A Place for Strangers: Towards a History of Australian Aboriginal Being|last=Swain|first=Tony|date=1993-08-09|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521446914|pages=36–39|language=en}}</ref> including [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]] in ''Nature'' in 1938.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/141263a0|title=Coming into being among the Australian Aborigines|last=Radcliffe-Brown|first=A.
