The '''Clergy of the Church of England database''' ('''CCEd''') is an online database of [[clergy]] of the [[Church of England]] between 1540 and 1835.

The database project began in 1999 with funding from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]], and is ongoing as a collaboration between [[King's College London]], the [[University of Kent]] and [[Durham University]]. As of September 2014, the database contained nearly 1.5 million evidential records about the careers of Church of England clergy, and the public version of the database had information on over 155,000 individuals.<ref name=about>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://theclergydatabase.org.uk/about/|website=CCEd: Clergy of the Church of England Database Project|publisher=King's College London|accessdate=6 October 2017}}</ref>
