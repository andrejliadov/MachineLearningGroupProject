==History==
[[File:Tenri University1.jpg|thumb|Tenri University building]]

===Background===
The Tenri Foreign Language College, the predecessor to Tenri University, was founded by the Tenrikyo Young Men's Association (a subdivision of [[Tenrikyo Church Headquarters]]) under the direction of the second [[Shinbashira]], [[Nakayama Shozen]]. The college was founded to educate Tenrikyo adherents who would engage in missionary work abroad. At the time of its establishment in 1925, Tenri Foreign Language College was the only private foreign language school in Japan.<ref name=tahot1986>Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department (1986). The Teachings and History of Tenrikyo. Tenri, Japan: Tenrikyo Overseas Mission Department. p. 180-3.</ref>

In 1928, following the government's Technical Schools Act, the Tenri Foreign Language College was split into two schools – Tenri Foreign Language College and Tenri Women's Academy. In 1944, Tenri Foreign Language College was reorganized and renamed as Tenri Language College, and in 1947, the school absorbed the Tenri Women's Academy, which itself had been renamed the Tenri Women's Technical College.<ref name=tahot1986/>

===Establishment===
In 1949, Tenri University was instituted as a four-year college. At its founding the university only had one [[faculty (division)|faculty]], the Faculty of Humanities.<ref name=tahot1986/> In 1959, faculties in Foreign Language and Physical Education were added.<ref name=tahot1986/> By the 1970s, the university had developed a strong reputation in Japan for foreign language study and [[judo]].<ref name="hawkins">{{cite journal|title=Tenri University: A Religious Approach to International Education|last=Hawkins|first=John N.|author2=Judith A.
