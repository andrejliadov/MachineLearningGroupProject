'''Desecration''' is the act of depriving something of its sacred character, or the disrespectful, contemptuous, or destructive treatment of that which is held to be sacred or holy by a group or individual.

==Detail==
Many consider acts of desecration to be [[Sacrilege|sacrilegious]] acts. This can include desecration of sacred books, sacred places or sacred objects. Desecration generally may be considered from the perspective of a particular religion or spiritual activity. Desecration may be applied to natural systems or components, particularly if those systems are part of naturalistic spiritual religion.

To respectfully remove the sacred character of a place or an object is [[deconsecration]], and is distinct from desecration.

Some religions, such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]] have specific rules as to what constitutes desecration and what should be done in these circumstances.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|accessdate=2007-02-17|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04748c.htm|title=Desecration}}</ref>

== Examples ==
===In Judaism===
{{main|Chillul Hashem}}

In [[Judaism]], the "Desecration of [[Names of God in Judaism|God's Name]]" meaning the desecration of any aspect of Judaism and its beliefs and practices as commanded in the [[Torah]]  and [[Halakha|Jewish Law]] and hence of God, is known as '''''[[Chillul Hashem]]''''' from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] meaning "[the] Desecration [of] the Name [of] God". In some instances to avoid ''Chillul Hashem'' Judaism would require that its adherents [[Martyrdom in Judaism|die as martyrs]].

The opposite or converse of ''Chillul Hashem'' in Judaism is ''[[Kiddush Hashem]]'' meaning "[[Sanctification]] [of] the [[Names of God in Judaism|Name of God]]".

===Christianization of the Roman Empire===
Examples of the destruction of pagan temples in the late fourth century, as recorded in surviving texts, describe [[Martin of Tours]]' attacks on holy sites in [[Gaul]],<ref>[http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~eknuth/npnf2-11/sulpitiu/lifeofst.html#14 Life of St. Martin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the destruction of temples in [[Syria]] by [[Marcellus of Ancyra|Marcellus]] <ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], "''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''", ch28</ref> the destruction of temples and images in, and surrounding, [[Carthage]],<ref name="ramsey">R.

<blockquote>
I peacefully removed your gods...there is no such thing as robbery for those who truly possess Christ.<ref name="ramsey"/>
</blockquote>

At the turn of the century [[St Augustine]] gave a sermon to his congregation in [[Carthage]] on removing all tangible symbols of paganism:<ref>St. Augustine, Sermon 26 from ''The Works of Saint Augustine, Part III; Sermons 20 to 51'', New City Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-911-78275-3 }} (Weblink: https://wesleyscholar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Augustine-Sermons-20-51.pdf (PDF))</ref>
<blockquote>
Am I saying "Stop wanting what you want"? On the contrary, we must be thankful that you want what God wants. That every superstition of the pagans and the Gentiles should be abolished is what God wants, God has ordered, God has foretold, God has begun to bring about, and in many parts of the world has already in great measure achieved.
</blockquote>

In the year 407 a decree was issued to the west from Rome: 
<blockquote>
If any images stand even now in the temples and shrines...., they shall be torn from their foundations...The temples situated in cities or towns shall be taken for public use. Altars shall be destroyed in all places.<ref name="ramsey"/>
</blockquote>
Sacred sites were now appropriated by Christianity: "Let altars be built and relics be placed there" wrote [[Pope Gregory I]], "so that [the pagans] have to change from the worship of the daemones to that of the true God."<ref>[[Ramsay MacMullen]], ''Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries'', Yale University Press, 1997.</ref>
