'''Iranian religions''' are [[religion]]s which originated in [[Greater Iran]].

==Background==
The beliefs, activities, and cultural events of the ancient [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] in [[ancient Iran]] are complex matters. The ancient Iranians made references to a combination of several [[Aryan race|Aryans]] and non-Aryan tribes. Aryans, or ancient Iranians, worshiped natural elements such as the sun, sunlight and thunder, but they eventually shifted their attention mostly to a single god, whilst acknowledging others. The Iranian ancient prophet, [[Zoroaster]], reformed Iranian religious beliefs to a form of [[Henotheism]]. The [[Gathas]], hymns of Zoroaster's [[Avesta]], brought monotheistic ideas to [[Persia]], while through the [[Yashts]] and [[Yasna]], mentions are made to [[Polytheism]] and earlier creeds. The [[Vedas]] and the Avesta have both served researchers as important resources in discovering early Aryan beliefs and ideas.<ref>Jahangir Oshidri (1997), ''Mazdisna encyclopedia '', Markaz Publishers , 1st publish.{{ISBN|964-305-307-5}}.</ref>

==Antiquity==
*[[proto-Indo-Iranian religion]]:<ref>Relating Religion: Essays in the Study of Religion
 by Jonathan Z. Smith</ref> The various beliefs and practices from which the later indigenous religion of the Iranian peoples evolved. This religion also influenced the development of the [[Indian religions]]. 
* [[Scythian religion]]: The religion of the [[Scythians]] and precursor to modern [[Uatsdin]].
* [[ancient Iranian religion]]: The ancient religion of the Iranian peoples
* [[Zoroastrianism]]: The present-day umbrella term for the indigenous native beliefs and practices of the Iranian peoples. While present-day Zoroastrianism is monolithic, a continuation of the [[elite religion|elite form]] of the [[Sasanian Empire]], in antiquity it had several variants or denominations, differing slightly by location, ethnic affiliation and historical period. It once had large population and high diversity.
* [[Zurvanism]]: By the late [[Achaemenid Empire]], Zoroastrianism was also evident as Zurvanism (Zurvanite Zoroastrianism), a [[monism|monist]] [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] that had a following as late as the Sasanian Empire.
* [[Mithraism]]: A mystery religion centred around the proto-Zoroastrian Persian god Mithras that was practised in the Roman Empire from about the 1st to the 4th century CE
* [[Manichaeism]]: A 3rd century [[Dualistic cosmology|ditheistic]] gnosticism that may have been influenced by Mandaeism. Manichaens believed in a "Father of Greatness" (Aramaic: ''Abbā dəRabbūṯā'', Persian: ''pīd ī wuzurgīh'') and observed Him to be the highest deity (of light). 
* [[Mazdak]]ism: A late-5th or early-6th century proto-[[socialist]] gnosticism that sought to do away with [[private property]].
* [[Yazdanism]]

==Medieval period==
Some religionists made syncretic teachings of [[Islam]] and local [[Zoroastrianism]].<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/article/603447 The Nativist Prophets of Early Islamic Iran: Rural Revolt and Local Zoroastrianism by Patricia Crone (review)]</ref>
* The early Islamic period saw the development of [[Persian mysticism]], a traditional interpretation of existence, life and love with Perso-Islamic [[Sufism|Sufi]] monotheism as its practical aspect. This development believed in a direct perception of spiritual truth (God), through mystic practices based on divine love.
* [[Khurramites]], a 9th-century religious and political movement based on the 8th century teachings of [[Sunpadh]], who preached a syncretism of Shia Islam and Zoroastrianism. Under [[Babak Khorramdin]], the movement sought the redistribution of private wealth and the abolition of Islam.
* [[Behafarid]]ians, an 8th-century cult movement around the prophet [[Behafarid]]. Although the movement is considered to have its roots in Zoroastrianism, Behafarid and his followers were executed on charges (made by Zoroastrians) of harm to both Zoroastrianism and Islam.
* [[Yarsan]], a religious order of [[Yazdanism]], which is believed to have been founded in the 16th century. Yazdanism promulgated the belief in a God manifest as one primary and five secondary avatars to form with God the Holy Seven.
