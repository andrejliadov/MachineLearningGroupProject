[[Islamic extremism]] is adherence to a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam (see [[Islamic fundamentalism]]), potentially including the promotion of violence to achieve political goals (see [[Jihadism]]). In contemporary times, '''Islamic extremism in Northern Nigeria''' is typified by the [[Boko Haram]] insurgency and the proselytizing campaigns of [[Salafi movement|salafist]] groups like the [[Izala Society]].<ref name=benamara>{{cite web|last=Ben Amara|first=Razi|title=The Izala Movement in Nigeria: From Guiding the Muslim Ummah to Losing Authority|url=http://www.nai.uu.se/ecas-4/panels/101-120/120/Ramzi%20Ben%20Amara%20-%20Abstract.pdf|access-date=2014-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424130054/http://www.nai.uu.se/ecas-4/panels/101-120/120/Ramzi%20Ben%20Amara%20-%20Abstract.pdf|archive-date=2014-04-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
The first recorded Jihad in what is now Northern Nigeria was waged in the 14th century by the then Sultan of Kano Ali Yaji, it culminated in the [[Battle of Santolo]] and the subsequent transformation of the Habe-Hausa Kingdoms of Northern Nigeria into Islamic Sultanates. In the 19th Century, the Fula people led by [[Usman dan Fodio]] overthrew many of these Sultanates in another [[Fula jihads|Jihad campaign]] and replaced them with the more puritanical [[Sokoto Caliphate]]. The slow rise of Islamic mysticism in the form of Sufi Brotherhoods under the Caliphate reversed some of the more puritanical tendencies of the early caliphate.

After the pacification of Northern Nigeria by the British, they preserved most of the native institutions of the Sokoto Caliphate including its Emirates which were aligned with the Sufi Orders. In the 1960s, the former Grand Qadi of Northern Nigeria, [[Abubakar Gumi]] and Sheikh Ismaila Idris with support of [[Wahhabi movement|wahabbist organisations]] from [[Saudi Arabia]] established the ''Jamatul Izalatul Bidia Wa Ikhamatul Sunnah''.<ref name=hill>{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Jonathan N C|title=SUFISM IN NORTHERN NIGERIA: FORCE FOR COUNTER-RADICALIZATION?|url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub989.pdf}}</ref>

Infused with further religious zeal from Gumi, offshoots of [[Izala Society|Izalatul Bidi'a Wa Ikamatul Sunnah]] like [[Boko Haram]] and [[Ansaru]] developed.

==Izala==
{{main|Izala Society}}
Izala was the first Islamist organization in modern times to openly advocate for a militant transformation of Northern Nigerian institutions in line with fundamentalist interpretations of Islam.<ref name="hill"/> Officially founded in 1978 with funding from Saudi Arabia, it is split between the more Militant Ikhwanist-Qutbist view and the more political Maududist view. The Ikhwanists find inspiration from the teachings of the early Wahabist [[Ikhwan|Ikhwan Movement]] and [[Sayyid Qutb]], who justified the violent overthrow of systems deemed unIslamic. In 2001, a faction of the Ikhwanist broke away to form [[Boko Haram]].
The Maududist faction found inspiration from the teachings of the movements founder [[Abubakar Gumi]] and [[Abul A'la Maududi]], and advocated for a 'smart' political jihad that they believe will mitigate any loss of life on their part.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dauda|first=Malam Ibrahim|title=Sharrin Izala}}</ref>
