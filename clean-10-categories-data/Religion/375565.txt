{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|denominations}}
'''Jewish religious movements''', sometimes called "[[Religious denomination|denominations]]" or "branches", include different groups which have developed among [[Jews]] from ancient times. Today, the main division is between the "traditional Judaism" ([[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]), and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], with several smaller movements alongside them. This denominational structure is mainly present in the United States, while in [[Israel]], the fault lines are between [[Haredi Judaism]] (Haredim), [[Religious Zionism]] (Datim), [[Masortim]] (traditional) and [[Hiloni]] (secular) Jews.<ref>{{cite web |title=Israel's Religiously Divided Society |work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project |date=2016-03-08 |access-date=2020-02-23 |url= https://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/ }}</ref>

The movements [[Relationships between Jewish religious movements|differ in their views]] on various issues. These issues include the level of observance, the methodology for interpreting and understanding [[Halakha|Jewish law]], [[Historical criticism|biblical authorship]], [[textual criticism]], and the nature or role of [[Messiah in Judaism|the messiah]] (or [[messianic age]]). Across these movements, there are marked differences in [[Jewish services|liturgy]], especially in the language in which services are conducted, with the more traditional movements emphasizing Hebrew. The sharpest theological division occurs between Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews who adhere to other denominations, such that the non-Orthodox movements are sometimes referred to collectively as the "liberal denominations" or "progressive streams".

== Terminology ==
Some Jews reject the term ''denomination'' as a label for different groups and ideologies within Judaism, arguing that the notion of denomination has a specifically Christian resonance that does not translate easily into the Jewish context. However, in recent years the ''[[American Jewish Year Book]]'' has adopted "denomination", as have many scholars and theologians.<ref>Sarna, Jonathan D. (2004). ''American Judaism: A History''. p. xix-xx notes the "newfound popularity" of the term "denomination".</ref>

Commonly used terms are ''movements'',<ref name="20th">{{cite book |editor1-surname=Cohen |editor1-given=Arthur A. |editor1-link=Arthur A.

The Jewish groups themselves reject characterization as [[sects]]. Sects are traditionally defined as religious subgroups that have broken off from the main body, and this separation usually becomes irreparable over time. Within Judaism, individuals and families often switch affiliation, and individuals are free to marry one another, although the major denominations disagree on [[Who is a Jew?|who is a Jew]]. It is not unusual for clergy and Jewish educators trained in one of the liberal denominations to serve in another, and left with no choice, many small Jewish communities combine elements of several movements to achieve a viable level of membership.

[[Relationships between Jewish religious movements]] are varied; they are sometimes marked by interdenominational cooperation outside of the realm of ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law), and sometimes not. Some of the movements sometimes cooperate by uniting with one another in community federations and in campus organizations such as the [[Hillel Society|Hillel Foundation]]. Jewish religious denominations are distinct from, but often linked to, [[Jewish ethnic divisions]] and [[Jewish political movements]].

== Samaritanism ==
{{Further|Samaritanism}}
[[File:Samaritanholyday.jpg|thumb|The Samaritans on Mount Gerizim]]
The [[Samaritans]] regard themselves as direct descendants of the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] in the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], which was conquered by [[Assyria]] in 722 BCE.<ref name="samaritans2010">{{cite book |editor-last1=Mor |editor-first1=Menachem |editor-last2=Reiterer |editor-first2=Friedrich V. |editor-last3=Winkler |editor-first3=Waltraud |year=2010 |title=Samaritans: Past and Present: Current Studies |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |series= Studia Samaritana, 5 & Studia Judaica, 53 |isbn=978-3-11-019497-5 |url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/title/19357}}</ref> Modern genetics has suggested some truth to both the claims of the Samaritans and of the Jews in account to the Talmud.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Oefner |first=Peter |title=Reconstruction of Patrilineages and Matrilineages of Samaritans and Other Israeli Populations From Y-Chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Variation |journal=Human Mutation |year=2004 |pages=248–260 |volume=24 |issue=3 |doi=10.1002/humu.20077 |pmid=15300852 |s2cid=1571356 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=March 2011}}

[[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan Torah]] preserves a version of the Torah in slightly variant forms. The first historical references to the Samaritans date from the [[Babylonian Exile]]. According to the Talmud, Samaritans are to be treated as Jews in matters where their practice agrees with the mainstream but are otherwise to be treated as non-Jews. The Samaritans have dwindled to two communities of about 700 individuals. One such community is located in the [[Israel]]i city of [[Holon]], while the other is located near [[Nablus]] on [[Mount Gerizim]], in the [[West Bank]].<ref name="samaritans2010" />

Today, Samaritans need to officially go through formal [[conversion to Judaism]] in order to be considered Jewish. One example is Israeli TV personality [[Sofi Tsedaka]] who was brought up Samaritan and converted to Judaism at the age of 18.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/54/ART2/155/455.html |title=אחרי הפיצוץ הגדול: סופי צדקה מתפייסת עם השומרונים |trans-title=After the big explosion: Sophie Izedaka reconciles with the Samaritans |work=nrg |language=he |date=2010-09-12 |access-date=2014-11-09}}</ref>

== Sects in the Second Temple period ==
{{Further|Second Temple Judaism}}
Prior to the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, Jews of the Roman province of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judaea]] were divided into several movements, sometimes warring among themselves: [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Essenes]], [[Zealots]], and ultimately [[Jewish Christian|early Christians]]. Many historic sources such as [[Flavius Josephus]], the [[New Testament]] and the recovered fragments of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], attest to the divisions among Jews at this time. [[Rabbinical writings]] from later periods, including the [[Talmud]], further attest these ancient schisms.<ref name="schiffman">{{cite book |last=Schiffman |first=Lawrence H. |author-link=Lawrence Schiffman |editor1=Jon Bloomberg |editor2=Samuel Kapustin |title=Understanding Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism |publisher=KTAV |year=2003 |location=Jersey, NJ |isbn=9780881258134 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQDkLzQimk8C}}</ref>

The main internal struggles during this era were between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, as well as the early Christians, and also the Essenes and Zealots. The Pharisees wanted to maintain the authority and traditions of classical Torah teachings and began the early teachings of the [[Mishna]], maintaining the authority of the [[Sanhedrin]], the supreme Jewish court. According to Josephus, the Sadducees differed from the Pharisees on a number of doctrinal grounds, notably rejecting ideas of life after death. They appear to have dominated the aristocracy and the temple, but their influence over the wider Jewish population was limited. The Essenes preached an ascetic way of life. The Zealots advocated armed rebellion against any foreign power such as [[Rome]]. All were at violent logger-heads with each other, leading to the confusion and disunity that ended with the destruction of the Second Temple and the sacking of [[Jerusalem]] by Rome. The [[Jewish Christians]] were the original Jewish followers of [[Jesus]]. The radical interpretation of [[Biblical law in Christianity|Moses' Law]] by Jesus' [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] and their belief he is the [[Divinity of Jesus|Son of God]], along with the [[Development of the New Testament canon|development of the New Testament]], ensured that [[Christianity and Judaism]] would become [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|distinctively different religions]].<ref name="schiffman" />

== Rabbinic Judaism ==
{{Further|Rabbinic Judaism}}
Most streams of modern Judaism developed from the Pharisaic movement, which became known as [[Rabbinic Judaism]] (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Yahadut Rabanit'' — יהדות רבנית) with the compilation of the [[Oral Torah]] into the [[Mishna]]. After the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] and the destruction of the Second Temple the other movements disappeared from the historical record, yet the [[Sadducees]] probably kept on existing in a non-organized form for at least several more decades.<ref name="schiffman" /><ref name="rabbinic">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/rabbinic-judaism |title=Rabbinic Judaism |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online |access-date=2020-11-07}}</ref>

== Non-Rabbinic Judaism ==
{{Further|Karaite Judaism|Samaritanism|Haymanot}}
[[File:Karay2617 (1).JPG|thumb|In central Karaite synagogue, [[Ramla]]]]
Non-Rabbinic Judaism—[[Sadducees]], [[Karaite Judaism]], [[Samaritanism]], and [[Haymanot]]—contrasts with Rabbinic Judaism and does not recognize the [[Oral Torah]] as a divine authority nor the rabbinic procedures used to interpret Jewish scripture.<ref>Sela, Shulamit (1994). ''The Head of the Rabbanite, Karaite and Samaritan Jews: On the History of a Title'', Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. Vol. 57, No. 2. pp. 255–267.</ref>

=== Karaite Judaism ===
{{Further|Karaite Judaism}}
The tradition of the ''Qara'im'' survives in [[Karaite Judaism]], started in the early 9th century when non-rabbinic sages like [[Benjamin Nahawandi]] and their followers took the rejection of the Oral Torah by [[Anan ben David]] to the new level of seeking the plain meaning of the [[Hebrew Bible|Tanakh's]] text. Karaite Jews accept only the Tanakh as divinely inspired, not recognizing the authority that Rabbinites ascribe to basic rabbinic works like the [[Talmud]] and the [[Midrash|Midrashim]].<ref>{{JewishEncyclopedia|author=[[Kaufmann Kohler|Kohler, Kaufmann]]; [[Abraham Harkavy|Harkavy, Abraham de]] |title=Karaites and Karaism|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9211-karaites-and-karaism}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Yaron |first1=Y. |first2=Joe |last2=Pessah |first3=Avraham |last3=Qanaï |author3-link=Avraham Qanaï |first4=Yosef |last4=El-Gamil |title=An Introduction to Karaite Judaism: History, Theology, Practice and Culture |publisher=Qirqisani Center |year=2003 |location=Albany, NY |isbn=978-0-9700775-4-7}}</ref>

== Ethno-cultural divisions' movements ==
{{See also|Jewish ethnic divisions}}
Although there are numerous Jewish ethnic communities, there are several that are large enough to be considered predominant. Generally, they do not constitute a separate religious branches within Judaism, but rather a separate cultural tradition ([[Nusach (Jewish custom)|nusach]]) and rite of prayer ([[minhag]]). [[Ashkenazi Jews]] compose about 75% of the world's Jewish population. [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Mizrahi Jews]] compose the greatest part of the rest, with about 20% of the world's Jewish population. Israel has two [[Chief Rabbi]]—one for the Ashkenazic, another for the Sephardic with Mizrahi Jews.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |surname=Himelstein |given=Shmuel |title=Chief Rabbinate |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion  |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&pg=PA195 |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |place=Oxford; New York |isbn=978-0-19-973004-9 |page=166}}</ref> The remaining 5% of Jews are divided among a wide array of small groups (such as the [[Beta Israel]] group of Ethiopian Jews who follow the [[Haymanot]] branch of Judaism), some of which are nearing extinction as a result of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and [[interfaith marriage|intermarriage]] into surrounding non-Jewish cultures or surrounding Jewish cultures.

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] had a tremendous effect on [[Jewish identity]] and on ideas about the importance and role of Jewish observance.{{cn|date=November 2020}} Due to the geographical distribution and the geopolitical entities affected by the Enlightenment, this [[philosophy|philosophical]] revolution essentially affected only the Ashkenazi community; however, because of the predominance of the Ashkenazi community in [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]] and in [[Jewish leadership]] worldwide, the effects have been significant for all Jews.

=== Sephardic and Mizrahi Judaism ===
{{Further|Sephardic law and customs|Baladi-rite prayer}}
[[File:Torah Reading Sephardic custom.jpg|thumb|Torah reading [[Sephardic law and customs|Sephardic custom]]]]

"[[Sephardic law and customs|Sephardic Judaism]]' is the practice of Judaism as observed by the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]] ([[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]]). The [[Mizrahi Jews]] (including [[Maghrebi Jews|Maghrebi]]) are all Oriental Jewry. Some definitions of "Sephardic" also include Mizrahi, many of whom follow the same traditions of worship but have different ethno-cultural traditions. So far as it is peculiar to themselves and not shared with other Jewish groups such as the Ashkenazim (German rite).<ref name="dobrinsky">Dobrinsky, Herbert C. (1988). ''A treasury of Sephardic laws and customs: the ritual practices of Syrian, Moroccan, Judeo-Spanish and Spanish and Portuguese Jews of North America.'' Revised ed.

Press. {{ISBN|0-88125-031-7}}</ref><ref name="weiner">{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html |title=Judaism: Sephardim |author=Weiner, Rebecca |work=Jewish Virtual Library.

Sephardim are primarily the descendants of Jews from the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. They may be divided into the families that left in the [[Alhambra Decree|Expulsion of 1492]] and those that remained as [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]], [[Marrano]]s and those who left in the following few centuries. In religious parlance, and by many in modern Israel, the term is used in a broader sense to include all Jews of [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] or other Asian or African backgrounds (Mizrahi Jews), whether or not they have any historic link to Spain, although some prefer to distinguish between Sephardim proper and Mizraḥi Jews.

Sephardic and Mizrachi Jewish synagogues are generally considered Orthodox by non-Sephardic Jews, and are primarily run according to the Orthodox tradition, even though many of the congregants may not keep a level of observance on par with traditional Orthodox belief. For example, many congregants will drive to the synagogue on the [[Shabbat]], in violation of ''[[halakha]]'', while discreetly entering the synagogue so as not to offend more observant congregants.

Unlike the predominantly Ashkenazic Reform, and Reconstructionist denominations, Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews who are not observant generally believe that Orthodox Judaism's interpretation and legislation of ''halakha'' is appropriate, and true to the original philosophy of Judaism. That being said, Sephardic and Mizrachi rabbis tend to hold different, and generally more lenient, positions on ''halakha'' than their Ashkenazi counterparts, but since these positions are based on rulings of Talmudic scholars as well as well-documented traditions that can be linked back to well-known codifiers of Jewish law, Ashkenazic and Hasidic Rabbis do not believe that these positions are incorrect, but rather that they are the appropriate interpretation of ''halakha'' for Jews of Sephardic and Mizrachi descent.<ref name="dobrinsky" /><ref name="weiner" />

The [[Yemenite Jews]]—[[Dor Daim]] and other movements—use a separate [[Baladi-rite prayer|Baladi-rite]]. The Yemenite and the Aramaic speaking [[Kurdish Jews]] are the only communities who maintain the tradition of reading the Torah in the synagogue in both Hebrew and the Aramaic [[Targum]] ("translation"). Most non-Yemenite synagogues have a specified person called a Baal Koreh, who reads from the Torah scroll when congregants are called to the Torah scroll for an [[aliyah (Torah)|aliyah]]. In the Yemenite tradition, each person called to the [[Torah scroll (Yemenite)|Torah scroll]] for an aliyah reads for himself.<ref>Simon, Reeva; Laskier, Michael; Reguer, Sara (eds.) (2002).

=== Ashkenazic movements ===
==== Hasidic Judaism ====
{{Further|Hasidic Judaism|List of Hasidic dynasties}}
[[File:Judios ortodoxos.jpg|thumb|Hasidim]]
[[Hasidic Judaism]] was founded by [[Israel ben Eliezer]] (1700–1760), also known as the [[Baal Shem Tov]], who had previously called themselves ''Freylechn'' ("happy ones") and now call themselves Hasidim ("pious, holy ones"). His charismatic disciples attracted many followers among Ashkenazi Jews, and established numerous Hasidic groups across Europe. The Baal Shem Tov came at a time when the Jewish masses of Eastern Europe were reeling in bewilderment and disappointment engendered by the two notorious Jewish [[Jewish Messiah claimants|false messiahs]], [[Sabbatai Zevi]] (1626–1676) and [[Jacob Frank]] (1726–1791), and their respective [[Jewish schisms#Sabbatians and Frankists|followers]]. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. The Hasidim are organized in independent "courts" or [[List of Hasidic dynasties|dynasties]], each headed by its own hereditary spiritual leader-''[[rebbe]]''. Unlike other Ashkenazim, most Hasidim use some variation of ''[[Nusach Sefard]]'', a blend of Ashkenazi and Sephardi liturgies, based on the innovations of [[Kabbala|Kabbalist]] [[Isaac Luria]]. [[Neo-Hasidism]] is trends of interest in the teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism by members of other existing Jewish movements.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |author=Assaf, David |url=https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Hasidism/Historical_Overview |title=Hasidism: Historical Overview |encyclopedia=[[YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]] |publisher=[[YIVO|YIVO Institute for Jewish Research]] |access-date=2020-11-25}}</ref>

==== Lithuanian ====
{{Further|Lithuanian Jews|Misnagdim}}
In the late 18th century, there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed ''[[Misnagdim|Mitnagdim]]'' ("opponents") by the followers of the Baal Shem Tov. [[Lithuania]] became the centre of this opposition under the leadership of ''[[Vilna Gaon]]'' (Elijah ben Solomon Zalman), which adopted the epithet ''[[Lithuanian Jews|Litvishe]]'' (Yiddish word) or ''Litvaks'' that refers to [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews who are not Hasidim (and not [[Hardal]]im or [[Sephardic Haredim]]). Since then, all the groups of Hasidic Judaism have been subsumed theologically into mainstream Orthodox Judaism, particularly [[Haredi Judaism]], although cultural differences persist. The Lithuanian spirituality mainly incorporated into the [[Musar movement]].<ref name="Jacobs" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Nadler |first=Allan |title=The Faith of the Mithnagdim: Rabbinic Responses to Hasidic Rapture |year=1997 |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |series=Johns Hopkins Jewish studies |isbn=9780801861826}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |author=Nadler, Allan |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Misnagdim |title=Misnagdim |encyclopedia=[[YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]] |publisher=[[YIVO|YIVO Institute for Jewish Research]] |access-date=2020-11-02}}</ref>

==== Post-Enlightenment movements (Orthodoxy, Conservatism, Reformism) ====
Late-18th-century Europe, and then the rest of the world, was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements that taken together were referred to as the Enlightenment. These movements promoted scientific thinking, free thought, and allowed people to question previously unshaken religious dogmas. The [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] of the Jews in many European communities, and the [[Haskalah]] movement started by [[Moses Mendelssohn]], brought the Enlightenment to the Jewish community.

In response to the challenges of integrating Jewish life with Enlightenment values, German Jews in the early 19th century began to develop the concept of [[Reform Judaism]], adapting Jewish practice to the new conditions of an increasingly urbanized and secular community.<ref name="Plaut">{{cite book |author=Plaut, W.

At same time, the notion "traditional Judaism" includes the Orthodox with Conservative<ref name="Jacobs" /> or solely the Orthodox Jews.<ref name="Mendes-Flohr" />

Orthodox Jews who were sympathetic to the Haskalah formed what became known as neo-Orthodox or [[modern Orthodox Jews]].<ref name="Silber" /> Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah became known as [[Haredi Jews]].

Over time, three main movements emerged:<ref name="Jacobs" /><ref name="Mendes-Flohr" />
; [[Orthodox Judaism]]
[[File:MORNING TORA READING.jpg|thumb|230px|Orthodox men during morning [[Torah reading]] at the Western Wall]]
Orthodox Jews generally see themselves as practicing normative Judaism, rather than belonging to a particular movement. Within Orthodox Judaism, there is a spectrum of communities and practices, ranging from ultra-Orthodox [[Haredi Judaism]] (Haredim) to [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] (with [[Torah im Derech Eretz|Neo-Orthodoxy]], [[Open Orthodoxy]], and [[Religious Zionism]]).<ref name="Silber" />
; [[Conservative Judaism]] (Masorti)
[[File:BirkatHachamaEncino.jpg|thumb|230px|''[[Birkat Hachama]]'' of Conservative Jews, [[Encino, Los Angeles]]]]
Conservative or ''Masorti'' Judaism, originated in Germany in the 19th century, but became institutionalized in the United States, where it was to become the largest Jewish movement.<ref name="Mendes-Flohr" /> After the division between Reform and Orthodox Judaism, the Conservative movement tried to provide Jews seeking liberalization of Orthodox theology and practice with a more traditional and halakhically-based alternative to Reform Judaism. It has spread to Ashkenazi communities in Anglophone countries and Israel.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Elazar |first1=Daniel J. |first2=Rela Mintz |last2=Geffen |author1-link=Daniel J.

[[File:ReformJewishService.jpg|230px|thumb|Reform Jewish service with mixed sitting]]
; [[Reform Judaism]]
Also known as Liberal or Progressive Judaism. Originally formed in Germany as a reaction to modernity, stresses assimilation and integration with society and a personal interpretation of the [[Torah]].<ref name="Plaut" /><ref name="Kaplan" />

==== Migration ====
The particular forms which the denominations have taken on have been shaped by immigration of the Ashkenazi Jewish communities, once concentrated in eastern and central Europe, to western and mostly Anglophone countries (in particular, in North America). In the middle of the 20th century, the institutional division of North American Jewry between Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox movements still reflected immigrant origins. Reform Jews at that time were predominantly of German or western European origin, while both Conservative and Orthodox Judaism came primarily from eastern European countries.<ref>{{cite book|author=Herberg, Will|title=Protestant, Catholic, Jew: An Essay in American Religious Sociology |year=1983 |publisher=University Of Chicago Press (Reprint edition) |isbn=0-226-32734-5|oclc=9686985}}</ref>

==== Zionists and anti-Zionists ====
{{see also|Haredim and Zionism}}
[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|An Israeli soldier prays]]
The issue of [[Zionism]] was once very divisive in the Jewish community. [[Religious Zionism]] combines Zionism and Orthodox Judaism according to rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]].

Religious Zionists (''datim'') have embraced the Zionist movement, including [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]], as part of the divine plan to bring or speed up the messianic era, based on the teachings of Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]].<ref name="Jacobs" />

Ultra-Orthodox Jewish non-Zionists believed that the return to Israel could only happen with the coming of the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]], and that a political attempt to re-establish a [[Jewish state]] through human means alone was contrary to God's plan. Non-Zionists believed that Jews should integrate into the countries in which they lived, rather than moving to the [[Land of Israel]]. The original founders of Reform Judaism in Germany rejected traditional prayers for the restoration of Jerusalem. The view among Reform Jews that Judaism was strictly a religion rather than a nation with cultural identity, and that Jews should be assimilated, loyal citizens of their host nations, led to a non-Zionist, and sometimes [[anti-Zionist]], stance. After events of the 20th century, most importantly [[the Holocaust]] and the establishment of the modern [[State of Israel]], opposition to Zionism largely disappeared within Reform Judaism.

Among most religious non-Zionists, such as [[Chabad]], there is a de facto recognition of Israel, but only as a secular non-religious state.

A few of the fringe groups of the anti-Zionists does not recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli state. Among them are both the Orthodox ([[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar hasids]], [[Edah HaChareidis]], [[Neturei Karta]]) and Reform ([[American Council for Judaism]]).<ref name="Jacobs" />

==== Pressures of assimilation ====
{{Main|Jewish intermarriage}}
Among the most striking differences between the Jewish movements in the 21st century is their response to pressures of assimilation, such as [[Jewish intermarriage|intermarriage]] between Jews and non-Jews.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tobin, Gary A. and Katherine G. Simon |title=Rabbis Talk About Intermarriage |year=1999 |publisher=Institute for Jewish and Community Research |isbn=1-893671-00-3|oclc=44759291}}</ref> Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis have been most accepting of intermarried couples, with some rabbis willing to officiate in mixed religious ceremonies, although most insist that children in such families be raised strictly Jewish. Conservative rabbis are not permitted to officiate in such marriages, but are supportive of couples when the non-Jewish partner wishes to convert to Judaism and raise children as Jewish.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bloom, Mark|title=A Place In The Tent: Intermarriage And Conservative Judaism |year=2004 |publisher=Eks Publishing |isbn=0-939144-46-8|oclc=179259677 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

=== Beta Israel (Haymanot) ===
{{Further|Beta Israel|Haymanot}}
[[File:חג הסיגד בארמון הנציב.jpg|thumb|Beta Israel celebrates [[Sigd]], Jerusalem]]
The [[Beta Israel]] (House of Israel), also known as Ethiopian Jews, are a Jewish community that developed and lived for centuries in [[Ethiopia]]. Most of them emigrated to Israel in the late 20th century. They practiced [[Haymanot]] (Religion), which are generally recognized as a non-Rabbinic Judaism (in Israel practicing both Haymanot and Rabbinic Judaism). The holiest book is the ''Orit'' (meaning "law"), which consists of the [[Torah]] with [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]] and [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]].

=== Crypto-Judaism ===
{{Main|Crypto-Judaism}}
The secret adherence to Judaism while publicly professing to be of another faith; practitioners are referred to as "crypto-Jews" (origin from Greek kryptos – κρυπτός, 'hidden').

In the United States [[Reform Judaism|Reform rabbi]] Jacques Cukierkorn is one of the leaders of the outreach to the descendants of those Crypto-Jews who wish to renew their ties with the Jewish people.<ref>{{Citation|last=Chicago Jewish Cafe|title=Are American Jews the New Secret Jews?

== 20th-century movements ==
Additionally, a number of smaller groups have emerged:
; [[Subbotniks]] (Sabbatarians) 
A movement of Jews of [[Russians|Russian]] ethnic origin in the late 18th – 20th centuries. Them majority belonged to Rabbinic and Karaite Judaism, the minority to [[Spiritual Christianity]].<ref>{{JewishEncyclopedia|author=[[Herman Rosenthal|Rosenthal, Herman]]; Hurwitz, S. |title=Subbotniki ("Sabbatarians")|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14094-subbotniki}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author-link=Glenn Dynner |last=Dynner |first=Glenn |title=Holy Dissent: Jewish and Christian Mystics in Eastern Europe |publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYnlGaeUBx0C&pg=PT358 |isbn=9780814335970 |pages=358–9}}</ref> Subbotnik families settled in the [[Holy Land]] at the time part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], in the 1880s, as part of the Zionist [[First Aliyah]] in order to escape oppression in the Russian Empire and later mostly intermarried with other Jews. Their descendants included Israeli Jews such as [[Alexander Zaïd]], Major-General Alik Ron,<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3992298,00.html Dr. Ruchama Weiss ▪ Rabbi Levi Brackman, "Russia's Subbotnik Jews get rabbi"], Ynet, December 9, 2010.

; [[Black Judaism]]
Is Judaism that is predominantly practiced by African communities, both within the African Continent and outside Africa (such as North America). It is theologically characterized by the selective acceptance of the Judaic faith (in some cases such selective acceptance has historical circumstances), and that the belief system of Black Judaism is significantly different from the mainstream sects of Judaism. In addition, although Black Judaic communities adopt Judaic practices such as Jewish holidays and Jewish prayers, some of them are generally not recognized by the mainstream Jewish societies as legitimately Jewish.
; [[Neolog Judaism]]
A movement in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and in its [[Treaty of Trianon|territories ceded in 1920]], which is similar to the more traditional branch of American Conservative Judaism.
; [[Jewish Science]]
Formed in the early 20th century by Alfred G. Moses and [[Morris Lichtenstein]]. Jewish Science was founded as a counterweight Jewish movement to [[Christian Science]]. Jewish Science sees God as a force or energy penetrating the reality of the Universe and emphasis is placed upon the role of [[affirmative prayer]] in personal healing and spiritual growth. The Society of Jewish Science in New York is the institutional arm of the movement regularly publishing ''The Interpreter'', the movement's primary literary publication.
; [[Reconstructionist Judaism]]
[[File:Synagogue-reconstructionist-mtl.jpg|thumb|Inside Reconstructionist synagogue, [[Montreal]]]]
A 1920s – 1940s-founded by rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan]] split from Conservative movement that views Judaism as a progressivelly evolving civilization with focus on Jewish community.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |surname=Alpert |given=Rebecca |title=Judaism, Reconstructionist |encyclopedia=The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture |page=346 |year=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> The central organization is "Reconstructing Judaism".

; [[Humanistic Judaism]]
A [[nontheism|nontheistic]] movement that emphasizes [[Jewish culture]] and [[Jewish history|history]] as the sources of Jewish identity. Founded by [[Sherwin Wine]] in 1963, it is centered in North America but has spread to Europe, the Far East, Latin America, and Israel.
; [[Jewish Renewal]]
Founded in the counter-cultural movements of the late 1960s, Jewish Renewal tends to embrace the [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] worship style and mysticism of hasidism, while rejecting the halakhic rigor of Orthodox Judaism. Jewish Renewal congregations tend to be inclusive on the subject of who is a Jew. The Jewish Renewal movement lacks the formal institutional structure of the other liberal movements.
; [[Open Orthodoxy]]
A movement founded by [[Avi Weiss]] in the late 1990s, with its own schools for religious ordination, one for men,<ref>[[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]]</ref> one for women,<ref>[[Yeshivat Maharat]]</ref> and a membership organization.<ref>[[International Rabbinic Fellowship]]</ref>

; [[Messianic Judaism]]
Made up of followers who seek to combine parts of Rabbinic Judaism with a belief in Jesus as the Messiah and other Christian beliefs. It is not regarded as Judaism by the major movements of Judaism, and is considered a form of Protestant Christianity.<ref>[[J. Gordon Melton|Melton, J. Gordon]] (2005). ''Encyclopedia of Protestantism'', Infobase Publishing.
{{ISBN|978-0-8160-5456-5}}. p.&nbsp;373. "Messianic Judaism is a Protestant movement that emerged in the last half of the 20th century among believers who were ethnically Jewish but had adopted an Evangelical Christian faith.…By the 1960s, a new effort to create a culturally Jewish Protestant Christianity emerged among individuals who began to call themselves Messianic Jews."</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/messianic-judaism/ |title=Who Are Messianic "Jews"?|website=My Jewish Learning |access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=December 2020}}

The [[baal teshuva movement]] is a description of the return of secular Jews to religious Judaism and involved with all the Jewish movements.

==== Trans- and post-denominational Judaism ====
The very idea of Jewish denominationalism is contested by some Jews and Jewish [[non-denominational]] organizations, which consider themselves to be "trans-denominational" or "post-denominational".<ref>{{cite newspaper |newspaper=Jerusalem Post |title=Beyond Dogma |author=Heilman, Uriel |date=February 11, 2005}}</ref> A variety of new Jewish organizations are emerging that lack such affiliations:
* [[Independent minyan]] movement is a [[laity|lay]]-led Jewish worship and study community that has developed independently of established denominational and synagogue structures and combines halakha with [[egalitarianism]];<ref>{{cite newspaper |newspaper=Washington Post |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2009/jun/06/new-judaism |title=New Judaism |author=Salmon, Jackquelin L. |date=June 6, 2009}}</ref>
* The [[International Federation of Rabbis]] (IFR), a non-denominational rabbinical organization for rabbis of all movements and backgrounds;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intfedrabbis.org/about.htm |title=International Federation Of Rabbis &#124; About Us |website=intfedrabbis.org |access-date=2012-08-15}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=November 2020}}
* Some [[Jewish day school]]s lack affiliation with any one movement;<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mendelsohn, Martha |title=High School Without Labels |journal=The Jewish Week |date=August 22, 2002}}</ref>
* There are several seminaries which are not controlled by a denomination: 
** The [[Academy for Jewish Religion (California)|Academy for Jewish Religion]], California, is a transdenominational academy based in Los Angeles. It draws faculty and leadership from all denominations of Judaism. It has programs for rabbis, cantors, chaplains, community leadership and Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE).

** The [[Academy for Jewish Religion (New York)|Academy for Jewish Religion]], is a transdenominational academy in Yonkers, NY. AJR is a fully accredited program that trains rabbis and cantors and also offers Master's Program in Jewish Studies;{{Citation need|date=November 2020}}
** The [[Hebrew College]] seminary, in [[Newton Centre, Massachusetts]], near Boston;<ref>{{cite web |author=Meskin, Jacob |title=Answers Divide Us, Questions Unite Us |url=http://hebrewcollege.edu/hct/spring-summer_2003/insight/answers.html |year=2002 |access-date=2007-03-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040104022259/http://hebrewcollege.edu/hct/spring-summer_2003/insight/answers.html |archive-date=2004-01-04}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=November 2020}}

Organizations such as these believe that the formal divisions that have arisen among the "denominations" in contemporary Jewish history are unnecessarily divisive, as well as religiously and intellectually simplistic. According to Rachel Rosenthal, "the post-denominational Jew refuses to be labeled or categorized in a religion that thrives on stereotypes. He has seen what the institutional branches of Judaism have to offer and believes that a better Judaism can be created."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosenthal, Rachel |title=What's in a name? |journal=Kedma |year=2006 |issue=Winter}}</ref> Such Jews might, out of necessity, affiliate with a synagogue associated with a particular movement, but their own personal Jewish ideology is often shaped by a variety of influences from more than one denomination.

==== Bnei Noah ====
{{Further|Noahidism}}
[[Noahidism]], Noahides, or Bnei Noah ({{lang-he |בני נח}}, "Sons of Noah") is a [[new religious movement]] which is based upon the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. Historically, the Hebrew term ''Bnei Noah'' has been applied to all non-Jews because Jews believe that they are the [[Generations of Noah|descendants of Noah]].<ref>{{JewishEncyclopedia|author=[[Isidore Singer|Singer, Isidore]]; Greenstone, Julius H.|title=Noachian Laws|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9679-laws-noachian}}</ref> Nowadays However, it is specifically used to refer to those "Righteous Gentiles" who observe the Seven Laws of Noah. According to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], non-Jews ([[Gentile#Judaism|Gentiles]]) are not obligated to [[Conversion to Judaism|convert to Judaism]], but they are required to observe the Seven Laws of Noah in order to be assured that they will have a place in the [[World to Come#Jewish eschatology|World to Come (Olam Ha-Ba)]], the final reward of the righteous. The modern Noahide movement was founded in the 1990s by Orthodox rabbis from Israel (mainly tied Hasidic and Zionist).<ref name="Feldman2017">{{cite web |url=https://wrldrels.org/2017/10/08/the-bnei-noah-children-of-noah/ |title=The Bnei Noah (Children of Noah) |last=Feldman |first=Rachel Z. |date=October 8, 2017 |website=World Religions and Spirituality Project |access-date=2020-11-03 |archive-url=http://archive.md/20200121162034/https://wrldrels.org/2017/10/08/the-bnei-noah-children-of-noah/ |archive-date=2020-01-21 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Feldman2018">{{cite journal |last=Feldman |first=Rachel Z. |date=August 2018 |title=The Children of Noah: Has Messianic Zionism Created a New World Religion? |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/737561/pdf |journal=[[Nova Religio|Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions]] |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=115–128 |doi=10.1525/nr.2018.22.1.115 |format=PDF |via=[[Project MUSE]]}}</ref>
