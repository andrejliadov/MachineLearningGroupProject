In Europe, [[Alija Izetbegović]], the first President of the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], began to embrace the "Pakistan model" in the 1960s, alienating [[Serbs]] which would use this ideology to attack Bosniaks later on,<ref>[[Faisal Devji]], ''Muslim Zion: Pakistan as a Political Idea'', Hurst Publishers, (2013), p. 248</ref> while in his ''[[Islamic Declaration]]'' he "designated Pakistan as a model country to be emulated by Muslim revolutionaries worldwide."<ref>[[Vjekoslav Perica]], ''[[Balkan Idols: Religion and Nationalism in Yugoslav States]]'', Oxford University Press (2002), p. 77</ref>

==Nigeria==
Pakistanism became a concern in [[Nigeria]]'s independence movement. The primary subdivisions of Nigeria consisted of the [[Hausa-Fulani]]-dominated [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]], the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]-dominated [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]], and the [[Igbo people|Igbo]]-dominated [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]]. In addition to  these ethnic differences, the Northern Region was primarily [[Muslim]], while the Western and Eastern regions were primarily [[Christians|Christian]]. In the 1950s, the Northern Region threatened to secede. [[Godfrey Mwakikagile]] noted that it was the Northern region that was the first region threatening to secede.<ref name="mwakikagile1">{{cite book |title=Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria |first=Godfrey |last=Mwakikagile |author-link=Godfrey Mwakikagile |year=2001 |publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]] |location=Huntington, NY |isbn=1-56072-967-8 |page=4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gqTjUjdvTQwC&pg=PA4 |access-date=2011-09-02}}</ref> At the 1950 General Conference at Ibadan, Northern Region delegates demanded 50% of the seats in Nigeria's legislature and threatened secession otherwise.<ref name="mwakikagile1"/> In 1958, Nnamdi Azikiwe said:

<blockquote>"It is essential that ill-will be not created in order to encourage a Pakistan in this country."<ref name="mazrui1-p104"/><ref name="azikiwe1"/></blockquote>

The original goal of the countercoup against the government of [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]] on July 29, 1966, was to facilitate the Northern Region's secession from the rest of Nigeria.<ref name="ikein1">{{cite book |title=Oil, Democracy, and the Promise of True Federalism in Nigeria |first1=Augustine A. |last1=Ikein |first2=Diepreye S.

In February 2011, Mazrui used the term to describe the division of the [[Sudan]] into Sudan proper, which is primarily Muslim, and [[South Sudan]], which is primarily Christian and [[animism|animistic]].<ref name="guardian1">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/09/sudan-secession-postcolonial-africa |title=Is this Pakistanism in Sudan? |first=Ali |last=Mazrui |author-link=Ali Mazrui |date=2011-02-09 |work=guardian.co.uk |access-date=2011-08-31}}</ref>
