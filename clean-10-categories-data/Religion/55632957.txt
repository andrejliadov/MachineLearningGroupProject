{{EarlyBuddhism}}
'''Early Buddhist texts''' (EBTs), '''Early Buddhist literature''' or '''Early Buddhist discourses''' refers to the parallel texts shared by the [[Early Buddhist schools]]. The most widely studied EBT material are the first four [[Pali]] [[Nikayas]], as well as the corresponding Chinese [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]].<ref>Tse-Fu Kuan.

Vol. 49, No. 4 (May 2010), pp. 393-420</ref> However, some scholars have also pointed out that some [[Vinaya]] material, like the [[Patimokkha]]s of the different Buddhist schools, as well as some material from the earliest [[Abhidharma]] texts could also be quite early.<ref>* {{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|pages=9-10|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|author-link1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref><ref name=":4" />

Besides the large collections in [[Pali]] and Chinese, there are also fragmentary collections of EBT materials in [[Sanskrit]], [[Saka language|Khotanese]], [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]] and [[Gāndhārī language|Gāndhārī]]. The modern study of early [[pre-sectarian Buddhism]] often relies on comparative scholarship using these various early Buddhist sources.<ref>e.g. "''Mun-keat, Choong (2000), The Fundamental Teachings of Early Buddhism''" and "''Analayo. Early Buddhist Meditation Studies (Volume 1)''"</ref>

Various scholars of [[Buddhist studies]] such as [[Richard Gombrich]], Akira Hirakawa, Alexander Wynne and [[A. K. Warder]] hold that Early Buddhist texts contain material that could possibly be traced to the historical [[Buddha]] himself or at least to the early years of [[pre-sectarian Buddhism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Warder|first=A. K.|author-link=A. K. Warder|year=2004|title=Indian Buddhism, 3rd Revised edition|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Gombrich|first=Richard F.|author-link=Richard Gombrich|year=1997|title=How Buddhism Began|publisher=Munshiram Manoharlal}}</ref><ref name=":1">Wynne, Alexander.

JOCBS. 2019(16): 98–148.</ref> According to the Japanese scholar Akira Hirakawa, "any attempt to ascertain the original teachings of the historical Buddha must be based on this literature."<ref>Hirakawa, Akira (1993) ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From Śākyamuni to Early Mahāyāna,'' Motilal Banarsidass Publ. p. 38.</ref> 

In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, these texts are sometimes referred to as "[[Hinayana]]" or "[[Śrāvakayāna]]" texts and are not considered Mahayana works.

==Overview==
Different genres comprise the Early Buddhist texts, including prose "[[Sutta Piṭaka|suttas]]" ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]: ''sūtra'', discourses), monastic rules (''[[Vinaya]]''), various forms of verse compositions (such as [[Gatha|gāthā]] and [[Udana|udāna]]), mixed prose and verse works (''geya''), and also lists (''matika'') of monastic rules or doctrinal topics. A large portion of Early Buddhist literature is part of the "sutta" or "sutra" genre, these are usually placed in different collections (called [[Nikāya|Nikayas]] or [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Agamas]]) and constitute the "Sutta Pitaka" (Skt: Sūtra Pitaka, "Basket of sutras") section of the various early Buddhist Canonical collections called [[Tripiṭaka|Tripitakas]] ("Three Baskets"). The suttas generally contain doctrinal, spiritual and philosophical content. 

There are EBTs from various Buddhist schools, especially from the Theravada and [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] schools, but also from the [[Dharmaguptaka]], [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahāsāṅghika]], [[Mahīśāsaka]], [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivāda]], and other texts of uncertain prominence.<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|pages=39|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|author-link1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref>  

According to [[Oskar von Hinüber]] the main purpose for the composition of the EBTs was to "preserve and to defend an orthodox tradition." He adds that this literary effort was influenced by the Vedic prose of the [[Brāhmaṇas]].<ref name=":2">[[Oskar von Hinüber]] (2006). [https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/view/8977/2870 "Hoary past and hazy memory. On the history of early Buddhist texts"], ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'', 29, (2), 198-206</ref> As noted by [[Oskar von Hinüber|von Hinüber]], these collections also contain the first ever Indian texts to commemorate historical events, such as the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta|Mahāparinibbānasuttanta]],'' which recounts the death of the Buddha. The early suttas also almost always open by introducing the geographical location of the event they depict, including ancient place names, always preceded by the phrase "thus have I heard" (''evaṃ me sutaṃ'').<ref name=":2" /> 

The textual evidence from various traditions shows that by the 1st century BCE to the fourth century CE, slight differences developed among these parallel documents and that these differences reflected "school affiliation, local traditions, linguistic environment, nonstandardized scripts, or any combination of these factors."<ref>Marcus Bingenheimer, Editor in Chief; Bhikkhu Anālayo and Roderick S. Bucknell, Co-Editors. [https://www.bdkamerica.org/system/files/pdf/dBET_T0026_MadhyamaAgama1_2013_0.pdf ''The Madhyama Agama: Middle Length Discourses Vol I (Taishō Volume 1, Number 26)'']. Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai America, Inc. 2013. BDK English Tripiṭaka Series, p. xviii</ref>

=== Orality ===
These texts were initially transmitted through [[oral literature|oral methods]]. According to Marcus Bingenheimer,

{{quote|After the death of the founder, Buddhist texts were transmitted orally in Middle Indo-Aryan dialects (Prakrits). While the southern tradition eventually settled on one of these dialects, Pāli, as its canonical language, in India and Central Asia Buddhist texts were successively Sanskritized and/or translated into other languages such as Chinese, Tokharian, Khotanese, Sogdian, and Tibetan. Also, new Buddhist texts in India, from at least the third century onward, were directly composed in standard Sanskrit. Manuscripts from the northern tradition, especially those of Central Asian provenance, are therefore often in Prakrit (especially Gāndhārī) or some nonstandard form of Sanskrit, sometimes called Buddhist Sanskrit, an intermediate stage between some Prakrit and standard Sanskrit. <ref>Marcus Bingenheimer, Editor in Chief; Bhikkhu Anālayo and Roderick S. Bucknell, Co-Editors. ''The Madhyama Agama: Middle Length Discourses Vol I (Taishō Volume 1, Number 26).'' Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai America, Inc. 2013. BDK English Tripiṭaka Series, p. xvi</ref>}}

As noted by Mark Allon there are various reasons why these texts are held to have been transmitted orally by modern scholars. These include internal evidence from the texts themselves which indicates that they were to be memorized and recited, the lack of any evidence (whether archeological or internal to the texts) that writing was being used to preserve these texts and the stylistic features of the texts themselves.<ref>Allon, Mark (1997), ''The Oral Composition and Transmission of Early Buddhist Texts'', in Indian Insights: Buddhism, Brahmanism and Bhakti, Luzac, pp 39–61 </ref> 

An important feature that marks the Early Buddhist texts are formal characteristics which reflect their origin as orally transmitted literature such as the use of repetition and rhetorical formulas.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Anālayo|author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Reflections on Comparative Āgama Studies|url=https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/reflect-comp-agama.pdf|journal =Chung-Hwa Buddhist Journal|year=2008|volume=21|pages=3–21|publisher=Taipei: Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies|issn=1017-7132}}</ref> Other stylistic features which betray orality include: the use of multiple synonyms, standardized phrases and passages, verse summaries similies, numbered lists and standard framing narratives.<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|pages=51|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|author-link1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref>  

These stylistic features are in contrast to later works such as [[Mahayana sutras]], which contain more elaborate and complex narratives, that would be more difficult to memorize. Also, the EBTs are always historically situated in ancient Indian locales, unlike many later Mahayana works, which depict themselves as being taught by the Buddha in heavenly realms or other supernatural circumstances.<ref>Reat, Noble Ross. ''“The Historical Buddha and his Teachings”''. In: Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy. Ed. by Potter, Karl H. Vol. VII: Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 AD. Motilal Banarsidass, 1996, pp. 26-27."</ref> 

Early Buddhist texts are believed to have been transmitted by lineages of [[bhāṇaka]], monks who specialized in memorization and recitation of particular collections of texts,<ref>Cousins, L.S. (2013) ''The Early Development of Buddhist Literature and Language in India.'' Journal of the Oxford Center for Buddhist Studies 5:89-135</ref> until they were eventually recorded in writing after the 1st Century BCE. As noted by Alexander Wynne:

{{quote|Although there is no evidence for writing before Aśoka, the accuracy of oral transmission should not be underestimated. The Buddhist community was full of [[Brahmin|Brahmins]] who knew that the Vedic educational system had transmitted a mass of difficult texts, verbatim, in an increasingly archaic language, for more than a thousand years. Since the early Buddhists required a different means of oral transmission, for quite different texts, other [[Mnemonic|mnemonic techniques]] were developed, based on communal chanting (saṅgīti). The texts explicitly state that this method was to be employed, and their actual form shows that it was, on a grand scale.<ref name=":1" />}}

Some scholars such as Wynne and [[Bhikkhu Analayo|Analayo]] generally hold that these texts were memorized in fixed form, to be recited verbatim (in contrast to other forms of oral literature, such as [[epic poetry]]) and that this was affirmed during communal recitations (where there is little room for improvisation), while others argue that they could have been performed in more poetic and improvisational ways ([[L. S. Cousins|L.S. Cousins]], [[Rupert Gethin]]) through the use of basic lists or formulas.<ref>Shulman, E. Forthcoming. 'Orality and Creativity in Early Buddhist Discourses.' In L. Gomez and N. Gummer (eds.), ''The Language of the Sūtras''.</ref>

The EBTs also show the influence of [[Vedas|Vedic texts]], including the adoption of certain Vedic poetic metres, as well as forms of organization (using topic and number). EBTs share similar terminology and ideas with Vedic texts.<ref>Gombrich Richard (2009). ''What the Buddha Thought.'' Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies monographs. Equinox, pp. 28, 43–44, 80–81, 122–128, 133–137, 182, 188, 202–206.</ref> They also share certain metaphors and imagery with texts like the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad]]'', such as the single salty taste of the ocean (AN 8.157 vs. ''Bṛhadāraṇyaka'' 2.4.11).<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|pages=67|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|author-link1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref>

=== Setting and date ===
[[File:Mahajanapadas_(c._500_BCE).png|thumb|250x250px|Gangetic plain during the pre-Nanda era. ]]
Regarding the setting, the EBTs generally depict the world of the [[Second Urbanisation|second urbanisation period]], which features small scale towns and villages, and small competing states (the [[mahajanapadas]]) with a lower level of urbanisation compared to that of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] era.<ref name=":1" /> As such, the EBTs depict the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|Gangetic Plain]] before the rise of the [[Nanda Empire|Nanda empire]], who unified all these small competing states during the 4th century.<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|pages=13|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|author-link1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref> 

They also depict [[Pataliputra]] as the small village of ''Pataligama'', while it would later become the capital of the Mauryan empire and the largest city in India.<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|pages=24|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|author-link1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref> They do not mention [[Ashoka]] but they mention the Jain leader [[Mahavira]] (a.k.a. ''Nātaputta'') as a contemporary of the Buddha.<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|pages=25, 34|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|author-link1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref>  

The EBTs also depict a small scale local economy, during a time before the establishment of the long distance trading networks, as noted by Brahmali and [[Bhante Sujato|Sujato]]:

{{quote|King Pasenadi of Kosala is said to have used kāsi sandalwood (MN 87.28), indicating that even the highest social strata used locally produced luxuries. This situation is perhaps to be expected given the political divisions in North India at the time, which may have complicated long-distance trade.<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|author-link1=Bhante Sujato|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|ISBN=9781312911505|page=23}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}

As noted by [[Oskar von Hinüber|von Hinüber]], the omission of any mention of the Mauryas in EBTs such as the ''Mahāparinibbānasuttanta'', in contrast to other later Buddhist texts which do mention them, is also evidence of its pre-Mauryan date:

{{quote|Given the importance of the rise of the Maurya empire even under [[Chandragupta Maurya|Candragupta]], who is better known for his inclination towards Jainism, one might conjecture that the latest date for the composition of the ''Mahāparinibbānasuttanta'', at least for this part of it, is around 350 to 320 BC.<ref name=":2" /> }}According to Alexander Wynne,{{quote|The corresponding pieces of textual material found in the canons of the different sects... probably go back to pre-sectarian times. It is unlikely that these correspondences could have been produced by the joint endeavour of different Buddhist sects, for such an undertaking would have required organisation on a scale which was simply inconceivable in the ancient world.<ref>Tse-fu Kuan (2007). ''Mindfulness in Early Buddhism: New Approaches Through Psychology and Textual Analysis of Pali, Chinese and Sanskrit Sources.'' Routledge. p. 3.</ref>}}

=== Archeology ===
[[File:Bhabru_inscription.jpg|thumb|250px|Ashoka Minor Rock Edict No.3]]
The [[Edicts of Ashoka]] are some of the earliest Indian historical documents and they agree with the EBTs in some respects. 

According to Sujato, the MPE 2 (Sārnāth) edict makes use of various EBT specific terms such as: "bhikhusaṁgha, bhikhuni-saṁgha, sāsana, upāsaka, anuposatha, saṁgha bheta, saṁgha samaga (Sāñcī version), cila-thitīka (Sāñcī)."<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|pages=106|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|author-link1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref> 

Sujato also notes that the RE 5 (Kālsī) edict states: “Good deeds are difficult to perform,” “bad acts are easy to commit”, which could be a quote from the [[Udana]] (5:8). Likewise, the RE 9 (Girnār) edict states “there is no gift like the gift of the Dhamma”, which could be a quote from the EBTs (see [[Aṅguttara Nikāya|AN]] 9:5 or [[Dhammapada|Dhp]] 354).<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|pages=103-104|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|author-link1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref>

A. Wynne notes that [[Minor Rock Edicts#Full texts of the Minor Rock Edicts|Minor Rock Edict #3]] mentions some Buddhist texts which have been identified and which might show that at the time of [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) these were already fixed.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wynne|first=Alexander|year=2004|title=The Oral Transmission of the Early Buddhist Literature|url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/view/8945|journal=Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies|volume=27|issue=1|pages=97–128}}</ref> These citations include the "''Rāhulāvada''", which could refer to the ''Ambalaṭṭhikā Rāhulovāda Sutta'' (MN 61)''.''<ref>Reat, Noble Ross. ''“The Historical Buddha and his Teachings”''. In: Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy. Ed. by Potter, Karl H. Vol. VII: Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 AD. Motilal Banarsidass, 1996, p. 29.</ref> 

Some early archeological sites like the [[Bharhut|Bharhut stupa]] (most visible material dates from the 1st or 2nd century BCE) contain many details from the EBTs such as: the mention of Buddha Gotama and all five past Buddhas of the EBTs, as well as kings Ajātasatru and Pasenadi. Major events from the Buddha's life from the EBTs are mentioned such as his awakening, the first teaching and his death.<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|pages=110|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|author-link1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref> According to Lüders “… the visit of Ajātasattu [to the Buddha] is depicted even in details exactly according to the ''[[Samaññaphala Sutta|Sāmaññaphala Sutta]]'',” and “… the representation of the visit of Sakka follows the text of the ''Sakkapañha Sutta''.”<ref>Luders, H., Waldschmidt, E., and Mehendale, ''A. Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum: Vol. II Part II Bharhut Inscriptions''. Government epigraphist for India, 1963.</ref>

Other Indian inscriptions from the 1st and 2nd century CE include terms such as ''dhamma-kathika'', ''peṭakin'', and ''suttantika'', indicating the existence of a Buddhist literature during this time.<ref name=":1" />

==Extant material==
Most modern scholarship has generally focused on the Pāli Nikāyas (which have been fully translated into Western languages) and the Chinese Āgamas (only partially translated). As early as the late 19th century, it was known that the Nikāyas and the Āgamas contain a great number of parallel texts. In 1882, Samuel Beal published his ''Buddhist Literature in China'', where he wrote:

{{quote|The [[Mahaparinibbana Sutta|Parinibbāna]], the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajāla]], the [[Sigalovada Sutta|Sigalovada]], the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|Dhammacakka]], the Kasi-Bhāradvadja, the [[Mangala Sutta|Mahāmangala]]; all these I have found and compared with translations from the Pali, and find that in the main they are identical. I do not say literally the same; they differ in minor points, but are identical in plot and all important details. And when the Vinaya and Āgama collections are thoroughly examined, I can have little doubt we shall find most if not all the Pali suttas in a Chinese form.<ref>{{citation|last=Sujato|first=Bhante|author-link=Bhante Sujato|title=A History of Mindfulness|publisher=Santipada|year=2012|url=http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A_History_of_Mindfulness_Bhikkhu_Sujato.pdf|ISBN=9781921842108|page=16}}</ref>}}

During the 20th century various scholars including Anesaki Masaharu and Akanuma Chinzen began critical studies of these correspondences. Probably the most important early works in the comparative study of these two collections are Anesaki's ''The Four Buddhist Āgamas in Chinese – A Concordance of their Parts and of the Corresponding Counterparts in the Pāli Nikāyas'' and Akanuma's ''The Comparative Catalogue of Chinese Āgamas and Pāli Nikāyas''.<ref>Akanuma, Chizen 赤沼智善 (1929): ''Kanpa shibu shiagon goshōroku 漢巴四部四阿含互照錄 - The Comparative Catalogue of Chinese Āgamas and Pāli Nikāyas.'' Nagoya: Hajinkaku shobō破塵閣書房, 1929. xvi + 424 pp. [Reprinted by Sankinbō Busshorin, 1958. Sri Satguru Publications, 1990 (Bibliotheca Indo-Buddhica no. 74).]</ref><ref>Anesaki, Masaharu 姉崎正治: ''The Four Buddhist Āgamas in Chinese – A Concordance of their Parts and of the Corresponding Counterparts in the Pāli Nikāyas.'' Yokohama : Kelly & Walsh (The Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan), 1908</ref> 

Over time this comparative study of these parallel Buddhist texts became incorporated into modern scholarship on Buddhism, such as in the work of [[Étienne Lamotte|Etienne Lamotte]], who commented on their close relationship: 

{{quote|However, with the exception of the Mahāyanist interpolations in the [[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara]], which are easily discernable, the variations in question [between the Nikāyas and Āgamas] affect hardly anything save the method of expression or the arrangement of the subjects. The doctrinal basis common to the Nikāyas and Āgamas is remarkably uniform. Preserved and transmitted by the schools, the sūtras do not, however, constitute scholastic documents, but are the common heritage of all the sects.<ref>{{citation|last=Sujato|first=Bhante|author-link=Bhante Sujato|title=A History of Mindfulness|publisher=Santipada|year=2012|url=http://santifm.org/santipada/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/A_History_of_Mindfulness_Bhikkhu_Sujato.pdf|ISBN=9781921842108|page=17}}</ref>}}

A recent study by Bhikkhu Analayo also agrees with this position. Analayo argues the Theravada Majjhima Nikaya and Sarvastivada Madhyama Agama contain mostly the same major doctrines.<ref>Analayo (2011). ''A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya.'' Dharma Drum Academic Publisher. p. 891.</ref> 

According to some Asian scholars like [[Yin Shun]], Mizuno Kogen and Mun-Keat Choong, the common ancestor of the [[Saṃyutta Nikāya|Samyutta Nikaya]] and the Samyukta Agama is the basis for the other EBTs.<ref name=":3" /> 

Recent work has also been done on other more fragmentary materials surviving in Sanskrit, Tibetan and Gandhari collections.  [[File:Burmese-Pali Manuscript Wellcome L0067944.jpg|thumb|Burmese-Pali [[Palm-leaf manuscript]].]]

=== Pāli EBTs ===
The [[Pali Canon|Pāli Canon]] of the [[Theravada]] school contains the most complete fully extant collection of EBTs in an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic language]] which has survived until today.<ref>Crosby, Kate; ''Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity'', 2013, page 2.</ref> According to the Theravada tradition, after having been passed down orally, it was first written down in the first century BCE in [[Sri Lanka]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gethin|first=Rupert|author-link=Rupert Gethin|title=The Foundations of Buddhism|isbn=9780192892232|url=https://archive.org/details/foundationsofbud00rupe/page/42|year=1998|pages=[https://archive.org/details/foundationsofbud00rupe/page/42 42]|url-access=registration}}</ref> 

While some scholars such as [[Gregory Schopen]] are skeptical of the antiquity of the Pali texts, Alexander Wynne notes that:

{{quote|Canonical fragments are included in the Golden Pāli Text, found in a reliquary from Śrī kṣetra dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century AD; they agree almost exactly with extant Pāli manuscripts. This means that the Pāli Tipiṭaka has been transmitted with a high degree of accuracy for well over 1,500 years. There is no reason why such an accurate transmission should not be projected back a number of centuries, at the least to the period when it was written down in the first century BC, and probably further.<ref name=":1" />}}

The Early Buddhist material in the [[Pali Canon|Pāli Canon]] mainly consists of the first four Pāli [[Nikāya]]s, the [[Patimokkha]] (basic list of monastic rules) and other [[Vinaya]] material as well as some parts of the [[Khuddaka Nikāya]] (mainly  [[Sutta Nipata]], [[Itivuttaka]], [[Dhammapada]], [[Therigatha]], [[Theragatha]], and the [[Udana]]).<ref>Abeynayake, oliver.

These texts have been widely translated into Western languages.

===Chinese EBTs===
The EBTs preserved in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] include the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgama]]s, collections of sutras which parallel the Pali Nikāyas in content as well as structure.<ref name="parallels2">{{cite journal|author=Anālayo|author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Some Pali discourses in light of their Chinese parallels, part two|url=https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/pdf/5-personen/analayo/some-pali-dis1.pdf|journal=Buddhist Studies Review|volume=22 |issue=1|year=2005|pages=93–105}}</ref> There are also some differences between the discourses and collections as modern comparative studies has shown, such as omissions of material, additions and shifts in the location of phrases.<ref name="parallels2"/> These various Agamas possibly come down to us from the [[Sarvastivada]] (the Samyukta and [[Madhyama Agama|Madhyama Agamas]]), [[Dharmaguptaka]] and [[Kasyayipa]] schools.<ref>Warder, A.

The language of these texts is a form of [[Classical Chinese|Ancient Chinese]] termed Buddhist Chinese (''fójiào Hànyǔ'' 佛教漢語) or Buddhist Hybrid Chinese (''fójiào hùnhé Hànyǔ'' 佛教混合漢語) which shows considerable [[Vernacular|vernacularity]]. Buddhist Chinese also shows a significant number of elements which derive from the source language, including [[Calque|calques]] and phonological transcriptions.<ref>Qingzhi ZHU, “Buddhist Chinese (Buddhist Hybrid Chinese)”, in: ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Language and Linguistics'', General Editor Rint Sybesma.

While the other Chinese Agamas are mostly doctrinally consistent with the Pali Nikayas, the [[Ekottara Agama]] (EA) has been seen by various scholars such as Johannes Bronkhorst and [[Etienne Lamotte]] as being influenced by later [[Mahayana]] concepts.<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes. The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India, page 14</ref> According to Lamotte, these 'interpolations' are easily discernible.<ref>Lamotte, History of Indian Buddhism, From the origins to the Saka era, Institut Orientaliste Louvain-la-neuve, 1988, page 156.</ref> According to Analayo, the most often proposed hypothesis is that the EA derives from the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamgika]] school.<ref>Analayo, ''Mahāyāna in the Ekottarika-āgama,'' Singaporean Journal of Buddhist Studies, Volume 1, 2013.</ref>

===EBTs from Pakistan and Afghanistan===
[[File:Fragmentary_Buddhist_text_-_Gandhara_birchbark_scrolls_(1st_C),_part_31_-_BL_Or._14915.jpg|thumb|Gandhara birchbark scroll fragments (c. 1st century) from British Library Collection]]
Modern discoveries of various fragmentary manuscript collections from [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] has contributed significantly to the study of Early Buddhist texts. 

Most of these texts are written in the [[Gandhari language|Gandhari Language]] and the [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī script]], but some have also been discovered in [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]].<ref name=":0">Allon, M. (2013). ''Recent Discoveries of Buddhist Manuscripts from Afghanistan and Pakistan and Their Significance''. In Wei Shan and Zhang Xuesong (Eds.), ''Religious Studies 2013'', (pp. 28-46). Beijing: Religious Culture Press (Zongjiao Wenhua Chubanshe).</ref> According to Mark Allon, the [[Gandhāran Buddhist texts]] contain several EBTs which parallel those found in other collections "such as the ''Ekottarikāgama'' and ''Vana-saṃyutta'' of the ''Saṃyutta-nikāya''/''Saṃyuktāgama."''<ref>Allon, Mark. ''The Formation of Canons in the Early Indian Nikāyas or Schools in the Light of the New Gāndhārī Manuscript Finds''. Buddhist Studies Review, Vol. 35, No. 1–2 (2018).</ref>

These texts include a parallel to the [[Anattalakkhana Sutta]], possibly belonging to the [[Dharmaguptaka]] school. A few publications have translated some of these texts.<ref>Andrew Glass, Mark Allon. ''Four Gandhari Samyuktagama Sutras'', pp 5, 15.</ref> 

According to Mark Allon, the most recent major finds include the following collections:<ref name=":0" /> 

* "The British Library Kharoṣṭhī Manuscripts", Birch bark scrolls in the Gandhari Language and the Kharoṣṭhī script, possibly belonging to the [[Dharmaguptaka]] school. They include prose sutras and verse works like parts of the [[Dhammapada|Dharmapada]] dating to the 1st century CE, making them the earliest EBT manuscripts discovered.
* "The Senior Kharoṣṭhī Manuscripts", Birch bark scrolls in the Gandhari Language and the Kharoṣṭhī script, possibly belonging to the [[Dharmaguptaka]] school. Most of these preserve "canonical" prose sutras, as well as some biographical material on the Buddha's life associated with the Vinaya.
* "The [[Schøyen Collection|Schøyen]] Manuscripts", discovered in the [[Bamyan|Bamiyan]] caves, a collection which preserves Early Buddhist, Abhidharma and Mahayana texts in either Sanskrit or Gandhari.

Another important recent find is "a substantial portion of a large Sanskrit birch bark manuscript of the [[Dīrghāgama|''Dirghagama'']], the division of the canon containing long discourses, belonging to the (Mula)-Sarvastivada school, which dates to the seventh or eighth centuries AD".<ref name=":0" />

=== Abhidharma ===
The various [[Abhidharma]] texts and collections (''Pitakas'') are considered by scholars to be (mostly) later material (3rd century BCE onwards) and thus are not EBTs.<ref>"Abhidhamma Pitaka." Encyclopædia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008.</ref> In spite of the relative lateness of the Abhidharma works, according to scholars like [[Erich Frauwallner]], there are kernels of early pre-sectarian material in the earliest layer of the Abhidharma literature, such as in the [[Theravada]] ''[[Vibhanga]]'', the ''[[Dharmaskandha]]'' of the [[Sarvastivada]], and the ''[[Śāriputrābhidharma]]'' of the [[Dharmaguptaka]] school. According to Frauwallner's comparative study, these texts were possibly developed and "constructed from the same material", mainly early Buddhist doctrinal lists (Pali: ''mātikā'', Sanskrit: ''mātṛkā'') which forms the "ancient core" of early Abhidharma.<ref name=":4">Frauwallner, Erich. Kidd, Sophie Francis (translator). Steinkellner, Ernst (editor). ''Studies in Abhidharma Literature and the Origins of Buddhist Philosophical Systems.'' SUNY Press. pp. 18, 100.</ref>

=== Mahāsāṃghika sources ===
The first schism among the Buddhist community was between the so called [[Sthavira nikāya|Sthaviras]] ("Elders") and the [[Mahāsāṃghika]] ("Great Community"). Some scholars such as Edward Conze have thus emphasized the importance of EBTs that have parallels in both Sthavira and Mahāsāṅghika sources.<ref>Reat, Noble Ross. ''“The Historical Buddha and his Teachings”''. In: Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy. Ed. by Potter, Karl H. Vol. VII: Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 AD. Motilal Banarsidass, 1996, p. 27.</ref> However, fewer Mahāsāṃghika texts have survived in comparison to Sthavira material.

One important source for Mahāsāṃghika EBTs is the ''[[Mahāvastu]]'' ("Great Event"). This is a mythic life of the Buddha which includes many legendary tales but also includes various EBTs parallels.<ref>Rahula, Bhikkhu Telwatte (1978). ''A Critical Study of the Mahāvastu,'' chapter 2''.'' Motilal Banarsidass.</ref>

There are also fragments of the Mahāparinirvāṇa and Caṁgi (Pali: Caṅki) sutras of the Mahāsāṃghika dating to the 3rd–4th century.<ref>Braarvig, Jens et al., eds. ''Buddhist manuscripts of the Schøyen collection vol. I.'' Hermes Academic Publishing, 2000.</ref>  

The ''[[Salistamba Sutra|Śālistamba Sūtra]] (rice stalk sūtra)'' is an early Buddhist text which has been tied to the Mahāsāṃghika school, it contains many parallel passages to the Pali suttas. As noted by N. Ross Reat, this text is in general agreement with the basic doctrines of the Sthavira EBTs such as [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]], the "[[Middle Way|middle way]]" between eternalism and annihilationism, the "[[Skandha|five aggregates]]", the "[[Three poisons|three unwholesome roots]]", the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path|noble eightfold path]].<ref>Reat, Noble Ross. ''“The Historical Buddha and his Teachings”''. In: Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophy. Ed. by Potter, Karl H. Vol. VII: Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 AD. Motilal Banarsidass, 1996, pp. 28, 33, 37, 41, 43, 48.</ref>

There are also various Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya texts which contain early material, including their ''[[Prātimokṣa]]'' monastic code, which is almost identical with Sthavira pātimokkhas.<ref>{{citation|last1=Sujato|first1=Bhante|title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts|url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf|pages=45-46|year=2015|publisher=Chroniker Press|last2=Brahmali|first2=Bhikkhu|author-link1=Bhante Sujato|ISBN=9781312911505}}</ref>

The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara Āgama]]'' (增壹阿含經; pinyin: ''zēngyī-ahánjīng'') has been attributed to the Mahāsāṃghikas by various scholars, though this attribution remains uncertain.<ref>G. P. Malalasekera (ed, 2009), ''Encyclopaedia of Buddhism: Volume VIII, fascicle 3.'' p. 822.</ref>

===Other fragmentary sources===
There are various EBTs collected in the Tibetan [[Kangyur]]. Peter Skilling has published English translations of these texts in his two volume "Mahasutras" (Pāli Text Society, 1994). According to [http://read.84000.co/section/O1JC114941JC14668.html 84000.co], a site of Tibetan Canon translations, the Degé [[Kangyur]] catalogue states that sutras Toh 287-359 of the General Sutra section are "[[Śrāvakayāna]]" works "probably extracted from the Āgamas of the Mūlasarvāstivāda". 

Another important source of early Buddhist material in the Tibetan canon are numerous quotations by Śamathadeva in his ''Abhidharmakośopāyikā-ṭīkā'' (Derge no. 4094 / Peking no. 5595), a commentary to the [[Abhidharmakosha]]. Some of this material is available in English translation by Bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā.<ref>Dhammadinnā. ''The Madhyama-āgama in Śamathadeva’s Abhidharmakośopāyikā-ṭīkā: annotated translation, comparative studies and concordances ''(Dharma Drum Buddhist College Research Series 9), Taiwan: Dharma Drum Publishing Corporation (in preparation).</ref>

Likewise, numerous sutra quotations by authors of [[Sautrantika]] treatises are also a source of EBT fragments. The Sautrantika school was known for focusing on using examples from and references to EBT sutras. These works include Kumaralata’s ''Drstantapankti'', the ''Abhidharmamrtara-sasastra'' attributed to Ghosaka, the ''Abhidharmavatara-sastra'' attributed to Skandhila and the ''[[Tattvasiddhi]]'' of Harivarman.<ref>Charles Willemen, Bart Dessein, Collett Cox (editors) ''Sarvastivada Buddhist Scholasticism'', ''Handbuch Der Orientalistik'', page 108.</ref>

Sanskritized fragments of different early Buddhist Agamas also survive from archaeological finds in the [[Tarim Basin]] and the city of [[Turfan]]. These finds include versions of a Sanskrit [[Udanavarga]].<ref>Nariman, J. K.; Introduction to the Early Buddhist Texts in Sanskritised Prākit from Literary History of Sanskrit Buddhism, Ch 1–6. http://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Reference/Early-Buddhist-Texts/02-EBT-Sanskrit-Canon.htm</ref>

[[Mahayana]] treatises also sometimes quote EBTs. According to [[Étienne Lamotte|Etienne Lamotte]], the ''[[Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa|Dà zhìdù lùn]]'' cites "about a hundred sūtras of the Lesser Vehicle; the majority are borrowed from the Āgama collections."<ref>Lamotte, Etienne; Gelongma Karma Migme Chodron. The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom of Nāgārjuna (Mahāprajñāpāramitāśāstra) Vol. II Chapters XVI–XXX, pp 494–495</ref>
