In [[astronomy]],  '''axis mundi''' is the Latin term for the [[Axial tilt|axis of Earth]] between the [[celestial pole]]s.

In a geocentric coordinate system, this is the [[axis of rotation]] of the [[celestial sphere]]. 
Consequently, in ancient [[Greco-Roman astronomy]], the ''axis mundi'' is the axis of rotation of the [[celestial spheres|planetary spheres]] of the classical [[Geocentrism|geocentric]] model of the cosmos.<ref>the term is used by [[Geminus]] in his ''Elementa'', in early modern editions misattributed to [[Proclus]] as ''Commentarius in sphaeram''. R.B. Todd, 'The Manuscripts of the Pseudo-Proclan Sphaera', ''Revue d'histoire des textes'' 23 (1993), 57-71.

The term continues to be used in modern astronomical works throughout the 18th century, e.g. [[Johann Samuel Traugott Gehler]], ''Physikalisches Wörterbuch'' (1791), [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_5qEtAAAAcAAJ/page/n701 p. 688].</ref>

In 20th-century [[comparative mythology]], the term '''axis mundi''' — also called the '''cosmic axis''', '''world axis''', '''world pillar''', '''center of the world''', or '''world tree''' — was greatly extended to refer to any mythological concept representing "the connection between [[Heaven]] and [[Earth]]" or the "higher and lower realms".<ref>Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols''. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.48-51</ref>
The concept was introduced by [[Mircea Eliade]] in the 1950s.<ref>Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.40</ref> It is closely related to the mythological concept of ''[[omphalos]]'' (navel) of the world or cosmos.<ref>J. C. Cooper. ''An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Traditional Symbols.'' Thames and Hudson: New York, 1978. {{ISBN|0500271259}}.</ref><ref>Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask).

''Cartouche'' 89: 15–21 https://www.academia.edu/8727362/World_Navels</ref>
Items adduced as examples of the ''axis mundi'' by comparative mythologists include plants (notably a [[tree]] but also other types of plants such as a [[vine]] or [[Plant stem|stalk]]), a [[world mountain|mountain]],  a column of [[smoke]] or [[fire]], or a product of human manufacture (such as a staff, a [[tower]], a [[ladder]], a [[staircase]], a [[maypole]], a [[cross]], a [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]], a [[rope]], a [[totem pole]], a [[Column|pillar]], a [[spire]]). 
Its proximity to heaven may carry implications that are chiefly religious ([[pagoda]], [[temple mount]], [[minaret]], [[church (building)|church]]) or secular ([[obelisk]], [[lighthouse]], [[rocket]], [[skyscraper]]). The image appears in religious and secular contexts.<ref name="Alain Gheerbrandt 1982. pp.61-63">[[Jean Chevalier (writer)|Jean Chevalier]] and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols''. Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.61–63, 173–175</ref> The ''axis mundi'' symbol may be found in cultures utilizing [[shamanism|shamanic]] practices or [[animism|animist]] belief systems, in major world religions, and in technologically advanced "urban centers". In [[Mircea Eliade]]'s opinion, "Every Microcosm, every inhabited region, has a Centre; that is to say, a place that is sacred above all."<ref name="Mircea Eliade 1991. p.39">Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols''. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.39</ref>

==Background==
[[File:Kailash-Barkha.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mount Kailash (viewed from the south) is holy to [[Hinduism]] and several religions in [[Tibet]].]]

There exist multiple interpretations as to the origin of the symbol. One psychological and sociological interpretation suggests that the symbol originates in a natural and universal psychological perception: that the particular spot in which one occupies stands at "the center of the world". This space serves as a microcosm of order because it is known and settled. Outside the boundaries of the microcosm lie foreign realms that, because they are unfamiliar or not ordered, represent chaos, death or night.<ref>Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.37-39</ref> From the center one may still venture in any of the four cardinal directions, make discoveries, and establish new centers as new realms become known and settled. The name of [[China]], meaning "Middle Nation" ({{lang|zh|中国}} [[pinyin]]: ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|Zhōngguó}}''), is often interpreted as an expression of an ancient perception that the Chinese polity (or group of polities) occupied the center of the world, with other lands lying in various directions relative to it.<ref name="Alain Gheerbrandt 1982. pp.61-63" /> 

A second interpretation suggests that ancient symbols such as the axis mundi lie in a particular philosophical or metaphysical representation of a common and culturally shared philosophical concept, which is that of an natural reflection of the macrocosm, or existence at grand scale, in the microcosm, which consists of either an individual, community, or local environment but shares the same principles and structures as the macrocosm. In this metaphysical representation of the universe, mankind is placed into an existence which serves as a microcosm of the universe or the entire cosmic existence, and who in order to achieve higher states of existence or liberation into the macrocosm must gain necessary insights into universal principles which can be represented by his life or environment in the microcosm.<ref>Fritjof Schuon. 'From the Divine to the Human: Survey of Metaphysics and Epistemology' World Wisdom Books, 1982 p. 23-27 </ref> In many religious and philosophical traditions around the world, mankind is seen as a sort of bridge between either two worlds, the earthly and the heavenly (as in Judeo-Christian, Hindu, and Taoist philosophical and theological systems), or three worlds, namely the earthly, heavenly, and the "sub-earthly" or "infra-earthly" (e.g. the underworld, as in the Ancient Greek, Incan, Mayan, and Ancient Egyptian religious systems). Spanning these philosophical systems is the belief that through man traverses a sort of axis, or path, which can lead from man's current central position in the intermediate realms into heavenly or sub-earthly realms. Thus, in this view, symbolic representations of a vertical axis represent a path of "ascent' or "descent" into other spiritual or material realms, and often capture a philosophy which considers the human life to be a quest in which one develops insights or perfections in order to move beyond this current microcosmic realm and to engage with the grand macrocosmic order.<ref>Fritjof Schuon. 'From the Divine to the Human: Survey of Metaphysics and Epistemology' World Wisdom Books, 1982 p. 27-31 </ref> 

In concepts of the axis mundi, certain geographic representations are used to capture this symbolic connection between the heavenly and the earthly -- often a mountain or other elevated place, a spot where earth and sky come closest, gains status as center of the center, the '''axis mundi'''. High mountains are typically regarded as sacred by peoples living near them. Shrines are often erected at the summit or base.<ref>Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols''. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.41-43</ref> [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Mount Kunlun]] fills a similar role in China.<ref>Wang, Chong. ''Lunheng Part I: Philosophical Essays of Wang Ch'ung''. Trans. Alfred Forke. London: Luzac & Co., 1907. p.337.</ref> [[Mount Kailash]] is holy to [[Hinduism]] and several religions in [[Tibet]]. The [[Pitjantjatjara people]] in central Australia consider [[Uluru]] to be central to both their world and culture. In ancient [[Mesopotamia]] the cultures of ancient [[Sumer]] and [[Babylon]] erected artificial mountains, or [[ziggurat]]s, on the flat river plain. These supported staircases leading to temples at the top. The Hindu temples in India are often situated on high mountains. E.g. [[Amarnath Temple|Amarnath]], [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati]], [[Vaishno Devi]] etc. The pre-Columbian residents of [[Teotihuacán]] in [[Mexico]] erected huge [[pyramid]]s featuring staircases leading to heaven. These [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] temples were often placed on top of caves or subterranean springs, which were thought to be openings to the underworld.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bailey |first=Gauvin Alexander |title=Art of Colonial Latin America |url=https://archive.org/details/artofcoloniallat0000bail |url-access=registration |publisher=Phaidon Press Limited |year=2005 |location=New York (NY) |pages=[https://archive.org/details/artofcoloniallat0000bail/page/21 21]}}</ref> [[Jacob's Ladder]] is an axis mundi image, as is the [[Temple Mount]]. For Christians the [[Cross]] on Mount [[Calvary]] expresses the symbol.<ref>Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols''. Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.680–685</ref> The Middle Kingdom, China, had a central mountain, [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun]], known in [[Taoism|Taoist literature]] as "the mountain at the middle of the world." To "go into the mountains" meant to dedicate oneself to a spiritual life.<ref>Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols''. Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.681</ref> 

Because the axis mundi is an idea that unites a number of concrete images, no contradiction exists in regarding multiple spots as "the center of the world". The symbol can operate in a number of locales at once.<ref name="Mircea Eliade 1991. p.39" /> [[Mount Hermon]] was regarded as the axis mundi in [[Canaan|Canaanite]] tradition, from where the sons of God are introduced descending in [[1 Enoch]] (1En6:6).<ref name="Bautch2003">{{Cite book |last=Bautch |first=Kelley Coblentz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FPNFEtWNrQC&pg=PA62 |title=A Study of the Geography of 1 Enoch 17–19: "no One Has Seen what I Have Seen" |date=25 September 2003 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-13103-3 |page=62}}</ref> The [[Urartu|ancient Armenians]] had a number of holy sites, the most important of which was [[Mount Ararat]], which was thought to be the home of the gods as well as the center of the Universe.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.peopleofar.com/2013/08/11/noahs-ark-in-the-mountains-of-armenia/ |title=Noah´s ark in the Mountains of Armenia |date=11 August 2013}}</ref> Likewise, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] regarded several sites as places of earth's ''[[omphalos]]'' (navel) stone, notably the oracle at [[Delphi]], while still maintaining a belief in a cosmic [[world tree]] and in [[Mount Olympus]] as the abode of the gods. Judaism has the [[Temple Mount]], Christianity has the [[Mount of Olives]] and [[Calvary]], Islam has the [[Ka'aba]], said to be the first building on earth, and the [[Temple Mount]] ([[Dome of the Rock]]).  In [[Hinduism]], [[Mount Kailash]] is identified with the mythical [[Mount Meru]] and regarded as the home of [[Shiva]]; in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], Mount Kailash is recognized as the most sacred place where all the [[Ley line|dragon currents]] converge and is regarded as the gateway to [[Shambhala]].  In [[Shinto]], the [[Ise Shrine]] is the omphalos.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} 

Sacred places constitute world centers ([[omphalos]]) with the [[altar]] or place of prayer as the axis. Altars, incense sticks, candles and torches form the axis by sending a column of smoke, and prayer, toward heaven. The architecture of sacred places often reflects this role. "Every temple or palace—and by extension, every sacred city or royal residence—is a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Centre."<ref name="Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12">Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask). 'Archetypes and Repetition' in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return''. Princeton, 1971. {{ISBN|0691017778}}. p.12</ref> The [[stupa]] of [[Hinduism]], and later [[Buddhism]], reflects [[Mount Meru]]. Cathedrals are laid out in the form of a [[cross]], with the vertical bar representing the union of earth and heaven as the horizontal bars represent union of people to one another, with the altar at the intersection. [[Pagoda]] structures in Asian temples take the form of a stairway linking earth and heaven. A [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] in a church or a [[minaret]] in a mosque also serve as connections of earth and heaven. Structures such as the [[maypole]], derived from the [[Saxons]]' [[Irminsul]], and the [[totem pole]] among [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] also represent world axes. The [[calumet (pipe)|calumet]], or sacred pipe, represents a column of smoke (the soul) rising form a world center.<ref>Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols''. Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.148–149</ref> A [[mandala]] creates a world center within the boundaries of its two-dimensional space analogous to that created in three-dimensional space by a shrine.<ref>Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols''. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.52-54</ref>

In the [[Classical element]]s and the Vedic [[Pancha Bhoota]] the axis mundi corresponds to [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]], the quintessence.

===Plants===
Plants often serve as images of the axis mundi. The image of the [[Cosmic Tree]] provides an axis symbol that unites three planes: sky (branches), earth (trunk) and underworld (roots).<ref>Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols''. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.42-45</ref> In some [[Pacific island]] cultures the [[banyan]] tree, of which the [[Bodhi tree]] is of the [[Sacred Fig]] variety, is the abode of ancestor spirits. In Hindu religion, the banyan tree is considered sacred and is called ''ashwath vriksha'' ("I am banyan tree among trees" – ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''). It represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever-expanding branches.  The Bodhi tree is also the name given to the tree under which [[Gautama Siddhartha]], the historical [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], sat on the night he attained [[Bodhi|enlightenment]]. The [[Mesoamerican world tree]] connects the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial realm.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Mary |url=https://archive.org/details/godssymbolsofa00mill/page/186 |title=The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya |last2=Karl Taube |publisher=Thames and Hudson |year=1993 |isbn=0500050686 |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/godssymbolsofa00mill/page/186 186] |author-link=Mary Miller (art historian) |author-link2=Karl Taube}}</ref> The [[Yggdrasil]], or World Ash, functions in much the same way in [[Norse mythology]]; it is the site where [[Odin]] found enlightenment. Other examples include [[Jievaras]] in [[Lithuanian mythology]] and [[Thor's Oak]] in the myths of the pre-Christian [[Germanic peoples]]. The [[Tree of Life]] and the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] present two aspects of the same image. Each is said to stand at the center of the [[Garden of Eden|Paradise garden]] from which four rivers flow to nourish the whole world. Each tree confers a boon. [[Bamboo]], the plant from which Asian calligraphy pens are made, represents knowledge and is regularly found on Asian college campuses. The [[Christmas tree]], which can be traced in its origins back to pre-Christian [[Europe]]an beliefs, represents an axis mundi.<ref name="ReferenceA">Chevalier, Jean and Gheerbrandt, Alain.

===Human figure===
The human body can express the symbol of world axis.<ref>Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols''. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.54</ref> Some of the more abstract Tree of Life representations, such as the ''[[sefirot]]'' in [[Kabbalism]] and in the ''[[chakra]]'' system recognized by Hinduism and Buddhism, merge with the concept of the human body as a pillar between heaven and earth. Disciplines such as [[yoga]] and [[tai chi]] begin from the premise of the human body as axis mundi. The Buddha represents a world centre in human form.<ref>Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Indian Symbolisms of Time and Eternity' in ''Images and Symbols''. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.76</ref> Large statues of a meditating figure unite the human figure with the symbolism of temple and tower. [[Astrology]] in all its forms assumes a connection between human health and affairs and the orientation of these with celestial bodies. World religions regard the body itself as a temple and prayer as a column uniting earth to heaven. The ancient [[Colossus of Rhodes]] combined the role of human figure with those of portal and skyscraper. The image of a human being suspended on a tree or a cross locates the figure at the axis where heaven and earth meet. The Renaissance image known as the [[Vitruvian Man]] represented a symbolic and mathematical exploration of the human form as world axis.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

===Homes===
Homes can represent world centers. The symbolism for their residents is the same as for inhabitants of palaces and other sacred mountains.<ref name="Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12" /> The hearth participates in the symbolism of the [[altar]] and a central [[garden]] participates in the symbolism of primordial [[Garden of Eden|paradise]]. In some Asian cultures houses were traditionally laid out in the form of a square oriented toward the four compass directions. A traditional home was oriented toward the sky through [[feng shui]], a system of [[geomancy]], just as a palace would be. Traditional Arab houses are also laid out as a square surrounding a central fountain that evokes a primordial garden paradise. Mircea Eliade noted that "the symbolism of the pillar in [European] peasant houses likewise derives from the 'symbolic field' of the ''axis mundi''. In many archaic dwellings the central pillar does in fact serve as a means of communication with the heavens, with the sky."<ref>Mircea Eliade. 'Brâncuși and Mythology' in ''Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts''. Continuum, 1992. {{ISBN|0826406181}}. p. 100</ref> The nomadic peoples of Mongolia and the Americas more often lived in circular structures. The central pole of the tent still operated as an axis but a fixed reference to the four compass points was avoided.<ref>Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols''. Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.529–531</ref>

[[File:Caduceus large.jpg|thumb|110px|right|The [[caduceus]]]]

===Shamanic function===
A common [[shamanism|shamanic]] concept, and a universally told story, is that of the healer traversing the axis mundi to bring back knowledge from the other world. It may be seen in the stories from [[Odin]] and the [[Yggdrasil|World Ash Tree]] to [[the Garden of Eden]] and [[Jacob's Ladder]] to [[Jack and the Beanstalk]] and [[Rapunzel]]. It is the essence of the journey described in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]]. The epic poem relates its hero's descent and ascent through a series of spiral structures that take him from through the core of the earth, from the depths of Hell to celestial Paradise.
It is also a central tenet in the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Townsend |first=Richard F. |title=Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand |title-link=Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=0-300-10601-7}}</ref>

Anyone or anything suspended on the axis between heaven and earth becomes a repository of potential knowledge. A special status accrues to the thing suspended: a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], a victim of crucifixion or hanging, a rod, a fruit, [[mistletoe]]. Derivations of this idea find form in the [[Rod of Asclepius]], an emblem of the medical profession, and in the [[caduceus]], an emblem of correspondence and commercial professions. The staff in these emblems represents the axis mundi while the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] act as guardians of, or guides to, knowledge.<ref>Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols''. Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.142–145</ref>

==Modern expressions==

A modern artistic representation of the axis mundi is the ''Colonne sans fin'' (''[[The Endless Column]]'', 1938) an abstract [[sculpture]] by Romanian [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. The column takes the form of a "sky pillar" ({{lang|ro|{{vanchor|columna cerului}}}}) upholding the heavens even as its rhythmically repeating segments invite climb and suggest the possibility of ascension.<ref>Mircea Eliade. 'Brâncuși and Mythology' in ''Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts''. Continuum, 1992. {{ISBN|0826406181}}. p.99-100</ref>
