'''Religious nationalism''' is the relationship of [[nationalism]] to a particular [[religion|religious]] belief, dogma, or affiliation. This relationship can be broken down into two aspects: the politicization of religion and the influence of religion on politics.<ref name=Xypolia>{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Cypriot Muslims among Ottomans, Turks and British|journal=Bogazici Journal|year=2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=109–120|url=http://www.bujournal.boun.edu.tr/docs/13330942935.pdf|accessdate=10 November 2012|doi=10.21773/boun.25.2.6}}</ref>

In the former aspect, a shared religion can be seen to contribute to a sense of national unity, a common bond among the citizens of the nation. Another political aspect of religion is the support of a national identity, similar to a shared ethnicity, language, or culture. The influence of religion on politics is more ideological, where current interpretations of religious ideas inspire political activism and action; for example, laws are passed to foster stricter religious adherence.<ref>Juergensmeyer, Mark. "The Worldwide Rise of Religious Nationalism", ''[[Journal of International Affairs]]'', Summer 1996, 50, 1.</ref>

[[Ideology|Ideologically]]-driven religious nationalism may not necessarily be targeted against other religions ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'', but can be articulated in response to [[modernity]] and, in particular, [[secular]] nationalism. Indeed, religious nationalism may articulate itself as the binary of secular nationalism. Nation-states whose boundaries and borders are relatively recent or that have experienced [[colonialism]] may be more prone to religious nationalism, which may stand as a more authentic or "traditional" rendering of identity. Thus, there was a global rise of religious nationalism in the wake of the end of the [[cold war]], but also as postcolonial politics (facing considerable developmental challenges, but also dealing with the reality of colonially-defined, and therefore somewhat artificial, borders) became challenged. In such a scenario, appealing to a national sense of Islamic identity, as in the cases of Pakistan and Indonesia, may serve to override regional tensions.

The danger is that when the state derives political legitimacy from adherence to religious doctrines, this may leave an opening to overtly religious elements, institutions, and leaders, making the appeals to religion more 'authentic' by bringing more explicitly theological interpretations to political life. Thus, appeals to religion as a marker of ethnicity creates an opening for more strident and ideological interpretations of religious nationalism. Many ethnic and cultural nationalisms include religious aspects, but as a marker of group identity, rather than the intrinsic motivation for nationalist claims.

==Buddhist nationalism==
{{Category see also|Buddhist nationalism}}Buddhist Nationalism is mainly prevalent and influential in countries like Sri Lanka and Myanmar. 

* [[Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism]] is a political ideology which combines a focus upon Sinhalese culture and ethnicity with an emphasis upon Theravada Buddhism, which is the majority belief system of the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka.
* The [[Patriotic Association of Myanmar]] and [[969 Movement|969 movement]] have the goal to "organise and protect" the Burman people and their Buddhist religion, which are influenced by Buddhist nationalism in Myanmar.

==Christian nationalism==
{{main|Christian nationalism}}
Christian nationalists focus more on internal politics, such as passing laws that reflect their view of Christianity. In the United States, Christian nationalism tends to be conservative. Distinctive radicalized forms of religious nationalism or ''clerical nationalism'' (clero-nationalism or clerico-nationalism) were emerging on the far-right of the political spectrum in various European countries specially during the interwar period in the first half of 20th century.{{sfn|Feldman|Turda|Georgescu|2008|3, 60, 65-69, 222, 227-231}}

*In [[Poland]], nationalism was always characterized by loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church. Groups like the [[National Revival of Poland]] use slogans like ''Wielka Polska Katolicka'' (Great Catholic Poland) and protest vigorously against legalization of [[gay marriage]] and [[abortion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nop.org.pl/2013/05/28/malopolska-za-zyciem/|title=Małopolska za życiem!|website=Nop.org.pl|accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref> Conservative religious groups connected with [[Radio Maryja]] are often accused of harboring nationalist and antisemitic attitudes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/poland.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105030845/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/poland.htm |archive-date=2006-01-05 }}</ref>
*Religious nationalism characterized by communal adherence to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and national Orthodox Churches is found in many states of [[Eastern Europe]] and in the [[Russian Federation]].

==Hindu nationalism==
{{main|Hindu nationalism|Hindutva|Indian nationalism}}
Given the extensive linguistic, religious, and ethnic diversity of the Indian population,<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/India.pdf India, a Country Study], ''United States Library of Congress, Note on Ethnic groups''</ref> nationalism in India in general does not fall within the purview of a solitary variant of nationalism. Indians may identify with their nation on account of [[civic nationalism|civic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6943598.stm|title=India's model democracy|date=15 August 2007|accessdate=22 October 2017|website=News.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> [[cultural nationalism|cultural]], or [[Non-Aligned Movement|third-world nationalism]]. Some commentators have expressed the idea that in modern [[India]], a contemporary form of [[Hindu nationalism]], or [[Hindutva]], has been endorsed by the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]].<ref name='veer'>{{cite book | last = van der Veer | first = Peter | title = Religious nationalism: Hindus and Muslims in India | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1994 | location = Berkeley, CA }}</ref> The Hindu nationalism however is more of a cultural nationalism called as "Hindu polity" than actual religious nationalism.<ref name="Jain">{{cite book | title=The Hindu Phenomenon | publisher=UBS Publishers' Distributors | author=Jain, Girilal | year=1994 | location=New Delhi | isbn=978-81-86112-32-8}}</ref>{{cn|date=December 2020}}

==Islamic nationalism==
{{See also|Muslim nationalism in South Asia|Palestinian nationalism|Turkish-Islamic synthesis|Islamic state}}
[[Pakistani nationalism]] is very closely associated with Muslim heritage, the religion of Islam, and [[Pan-Islamism]], as described in [[Two-nation theory]]. It also refers to the consciousness and expression of religious and ethnic influences that help mould the national consciousness. [[Hamas]] is a Palestinian nationalist party with Islamic elements.

==Jewish nationalism==
{{main|Religious Zionism|Zionism}}
[[Religious Zionism]] is an ideology that combines [[Zionism]] and [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Before the establishment of [[Israel|the State of Israel]], Religious Zionists were mainly observant Jews who supported Zionist efforts to rebuild a [[Jewish state]] in the [[Land of Israel]]. After the [[Six-Day War]], and the capture of the [[West Bank]], a territory referred to in Jewish, Biblical terms as [[Judea and Samaria Area|Judea and Samaria]], right-wing components of the Religious Zionist movement became integrated with Israeli nationalism and evolved into [[Neo-Zionism]], whose ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp. 314–315.</ref>

==Other religious movements and nationalism==
In the [[Korea]]n peninsula the ''[[Donghak]]'' movement and its leader, [[Choe Je-u]], were inspired by [[Christianity in Korea|Korean Catholic]] missionaries. However, they condemned the 'Western learning' preached by missionaries and contrasted it with the indigenous 'Eastern learning'. They started a [[Donghak Peasant Revolution|rebellion]] in 1894 in [[Jeolla]] province in southwestern Korea. The rebellion was eventually crushed by Chinese and Japanese troops, resulting in 300,000 fatalities. It is comparable to the [[millenarian]] [[Taiping Rebellion|Taiping revolution]] led by [[Hong Xiuquan]], who was also inspired by [[Roman Catholicism in China|Catholic missionaries]]. The ''Donghak'' movement served as a template for the later ''[[Daejonggyo]]'' and ''[[Jeung San Do|Jeungsan-gyo]]'' movements, as well as for other religious nationalist movements. The [[Buddhist]]-influenced ''Daejonggyo'' movement financed guerillas in [[Manchuria]] during [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial rule]] of both Korea and Manchuria. The [[North Korea]]n state ideology, ''[[Juche]]'', is sometimes classified as a religion in the [[United States Department of State]]'s human rights reports.<ref name="Becker2005">{{cite book|author=Jasper Becker|title=Rogue Regime : Kim Jong Il and the Looming Threat of North Korea: Kim Jong Il and the Looming Threat of North Korea|url=https://archive.org/details/rogueregimekimjo00beck|url-access=registration|date=1 May 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803810-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rogueregimekimjo00beck/page/78 78]–80}}</ref>
