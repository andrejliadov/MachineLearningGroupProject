[[Water]] is considered a [[Ritual purification|purifier]] in most [[religion]]s.

==Holy water==

Some faiths use water especially prepared for religious purposes ([[holy water]] in most Christian denominations, ''[[amrita]]'' in Sikhism and Hinduism). Many religions also consider particular sources or bodies of water to be sacred or at least auspicious; examples include [[Lourdes]] in [[Roman Catholicism]], the [[Jordan River]] (at least symbolically) in some Christian churches, the [[Zamzam Well]] in Islam and the River [[Ganges]] (among many others) in Hinduism.

==Ritual washing==
{{Main|Ritual purification|Ablution in Christianity|Ritual washing in Judaism}}
Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], the [[Baháʼí Faith]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and the [[Rastafari movement]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases (see ''[[Tayammum]]'') after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]'').

==Immersion of deities==

In Hinduism, statues of [[Durga]] and [[Ganesh]] are immersed in rivers at the final stages of the festivals [[Durga Puja]] and [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] respectively.<ref>{{cite book |last= Sehgal |first= Sunil |title= Encyclopaedia of hinduism: (R - S)., Volume 4 |year= 1999 |publisher= Sarup & Sons |location= New Delhi, India |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sDmwCcLza2AC| isbn= 81-7625-064-3| pages = 1082, 1087 |ref = harv}}</ref>

In [[Christianity]], the [[baptism of Jesus]] is an important moment in [[Christian theology]] and is celebrated in [[Western Christianity]] as [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]. In the Christian East this feast is celebrated as [[Theophany]] on January 6.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Theophany of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ|url=http://goarch.org/chapel/saints_view?contentid=374|publisher=Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref>

==Water deities==
{{Main|List of water deities}}
[[Water deity|Water deities]] are usually a focus of worship at specific springs or [[holy well]]s, but there are also more abstract [[ocean]] deities, and deities representing "water" as an abstract element, such as [[Aban]] in Zoroastrianism.

Example for local [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] water deities include  [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] [[Sulis]], worshipped at the thermal spring at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], or [[Ganges in Hinduism]], personified as a goddess. The Hindu goddess [[Saraswati]] originated as a personification of the [[Sarasvati River|Saraswati River]] in the [[Rigvedic deities|Rigveda]], but became a more abstract deity of wisdom in Hinduism. African examples include the [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] river goddess [[Oshun]], the [[Igbo mythology|Igbo]] lake goddess [[Ogbuide]]  (Uhammiri), the Igbo river goddess [[Idemili]] and Agulu Lake (Achebe).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
