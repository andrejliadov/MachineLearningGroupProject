{{distinguish|text=[[deconstruction]] as a philosophical theory of textual criticism}}

'''Positive deconstruction''', in relation to [[Christian apologetics]], is a term first used by [[Nick Pollard]] in ''Evangelism Made Slightly Less Difficult''<ref name=emsld>[[Nick Pollard]], ''Evangelism Made Slightly Less Difficult'' (Leicester: IVP, 1997) pp. 48–56.</ref> (drawing on Dr. David Cook),<ref name=cook>E. David Cook, ''Blind Alley Beliefs'' 2nd ed. (Leicester: Inter-Varsity Press, 1996).</ref> to describe a methodology for engaging with [[worldview]]s in Christian apologetics. The process is one of ''deconstruction'' because it involves 'dismantling' the worldview in order to identify areas of conflict with a Christian worldview. It is ''positive'' because the intention is not to destroy a person's ideas and belief system, but to build on areas of agreement between the two worldviews in order to argue for the truth of the Christian worldview.

Pollard identifies four key aspects:

* '''Identify the worldview:''' What beliefs, values and attitudes are being communicated?
* '''Analyse the worldview,''' primarily in terms of the [[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]], [[Coherence theory of truth|coherence]] and [[Pragmatic theory of truth|pragmatic]] theories of truth
* '''Affirm the truth:''' what aspects of the worldview are in agreement with a Christian worldview?
* '''Deny the error:''' what aspects of the worldview are in conflict with a Christian worldview?

Tony Watkins develops this in relation to film in ''Focus: The Art and Soul of Cinema''.<ref name=focus>Tony Watkins, ''Focus: The Art and Soul of Cinema'' (Milton Keynes and Tyrone, GA: Damaris, 2007)</ref> He aims to make the positive deconstruction process more accessible, and accordingly re-labels the four aspects of the process (pp.&nbsp;31–45):

* '''Analyse the worldview''', in which he suggests a five-part framework for considering worldviews:
** What is reality?
** What does it mean to be human?
** How do we know what the good is?
** How do we know anything at all?
** What is the fundamental problem confronting all human beings, and what is the solution?
* '''Evaluate the worldview''' (as with Pollard's second stage, this is terms of correspondence, coherence, pragmatism)
* '''Celebrate the good'''
* '''Challenge the bad'''
