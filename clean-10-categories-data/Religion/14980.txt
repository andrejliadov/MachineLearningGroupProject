Very little is known of Imhotep as a historical figure, but in the 3,000 years following his death, he was gradually glorified and [[Deifying|deified]].

Traditions from long after Imhotep's death treated him as a great author of [[Sebayt|wisdom texts]]<ref>D. Wildung (1977), ''Egyptian Saints: Deification in Pharaonic Egypt'', p. 34</ref> and especially as a physician.<ref>William Osler, ''The Evolution of Modern Medicine'', Kessinger Publishing 2004, p.12</ref><ref name="Musso2005">Musso, C.

(2011). ''Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt'', p. 96.</ref><ref>Baud, M. (2002). ''Djéser et la IIIe dynastie'', p. 125. (In French).</ref> Apart from the three short contemporary inscriptions that establish him as chancellor to the Pharaoh, the first text to reference Imhotep dates to the time of [[Amenhotep III]] (c. 1391–1353 BC). It is addressed to the owner of a tomb, and reads:

{{Quote|text=The wab-priest may give offerings to your ka. The wab-priests may stretch to you their arms with libations on the soil, as it is done for Imhotep with the remains of the water bowl. |source=D. Wildung (1977), ''Egyptian Saints: Deification in Pharaonic Egypt'', p. 34.}}

It appears that this libation to Imhotep was done regularly, as they are attested on papyri associated with statues of Imhotep until the Late Period (c. 664–332 BC). To Wildung, this cult holds its origin in the slow evolution of the memory of Imhotep among intellectuals from his death onward. To [[Alan Gardiner]], this cult is so distinct from the offerings usually made to commoners that the epithet of "demi-god" is likely justified to describe the way Imhotep was venerated in the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550–1077 BC).<ref>Hurry, J. B. (1926). ''Imhotep: The Egyptian God of Medicine'' (2014 re-impression, 133 pages). Oxford: Traffic Output, pp. 47–48.</ref>

The first references to the healing abilities of Imhotep occur from the [[Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth Dynasty]] (c. 380–343 BC) onward, some 2,200 years after his death.<ref>Baud, M. (2002). ''Djéser et la IIIe dynastie'', p. 127. (in French).</ref><ref>Wildung, D. (1977). ''Egyptian Saints – Deification in Pharaonic Egypt'', p. 44.</ref>

Imhotep is among the few non-royal Egyptians who were [[Apotheosis|deified]] after their death, and until the 21st century, he was thought to be only one of two commoners{{snd}}along with [[Amenhotep, son of Hapu]]{{snd}}to achieve this status.{{sfn|Albrecht|Feldmeier|2014|p=29|loc=Leiden; Boston}} The center of his cult was in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. The location of his tomb remains unknown, despite efforts to find it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/harpers_lay.htm |title=Lay of the Harper |publisher=Reshafim.org.il |accessdate=2015-06-23}}</ref> The consensus is that it is hidden somewhere at [[Saqqara]].

==Historicity==
Imhotep's [[historicity]] is confirmed by two contemporary inscriptions made during his lifetime on the base or pedestal of one of Djoser's statues (Cairo JE 49889) and also by a [[Graffito (archaeology)|graffito]] on the enclosure wall surrounding [[Sekhemkhet]]'s unfinished step pyramid.<ref name=Malek>Jaromir Malek. "The Old Kingdom" in ''The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt'' by Ian Shaw (ed.) Oxford University Press paperback 2002. p. 92–93</ref><ref>J. Kahl "Old Kingdom: Third Dynasty" in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'' by Donald Redford (ed.) Vol. 2, p. 592</ref> The latter inscription suggests that Imhotep outlived Djoser by a few years and went on to serve in the construction of Pharaoh Sekhemkhet's pyramid, which was abandoned due to this ruler's brief reign.<ref name=Malek/>

===Architecture and engineering===
[[Image:Sakkara 01.jpg|right|thumb|Pyramid of Djoser]]
Imhotep was one of the chief officials of the [[Pharaoh]] [[Djoser]]. Egyptologists ascribe to him the design of the [[Pyramid of Djoser]], a [[step pyramid]] at [[Saqqara]] built during the [[3rd Dynasty]].<ref>[[Barry J. Kemp]], ''Ancient Egypt'', Routledge 2005, p. 159</ref> He may also have been responsible for the first known use of stone [[column]]s to support a building.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Baker |first1=Rosalie |last2=Baker |first2=Charles |date=2001 |title=Ancient Egyptians: People of the Pyramids |url=https://archive.org/details/ancientegyptians0000bake/page/23 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/ancientegyptians0000bake/page/23 23] |isbn=978-0195122213 }}</ref> Despite these later attestations, the pharaonic Egyptians themselves never credited Imhotep as the designer of the stepped pyramid nor with the invention of stone architecture.<ref>John Romer, ''A History of Ancient Egypt From the First Farmers to the Great Pyramid'', Penguin Books 2013, p. 294-295</ref>

==Deification==
Two thousand years after his death, Imhotep's status had risen to that of a god of medicine and [[healing]]. He was eventually equated with [[Thoth]], the god of architecture, mathematics, and medicine, and patron of [[scribes]]: Imhotep's cult had merged with that of his former tutelary god.

He was revered in the region of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as the "brother" of [[Amenhotep, son of Hapu]], another deified architect, in the temples dedicated to Thoth.<ref>''Thoth or the Hermes of Egypt: A Study of Some Aspects of Theological Thought in Ancient Egypt'', p. 166–168, Patrick Boylan, Oxford University Press, 1922</ref><ref>M. Lichtheim, ''Ancient Egyptian Literature'', The University of California Press 1980, vol. 3, p. 104</ref> Imhotep was also linked to [[Asclepius|Asklepios]] by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Egyptian mythology|last=Geraldine|first=Pinch|isbn=9781576072424|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|oclc=52716451|year=2002}}</ref>

According to myth, Imhotep's mother was a mortal named Kheredu-ankh, she too being eventually revered as a demi-goddess as the daughter of [[Banebdjedet]].<ref>Marina Warner, Felipe Fernández-Armesto, ''World of Myths'', University of Texas Press 2003, {{ISBN|0-292-70204-3}}, p. 296</ref> Alternatively, since Imhotep was known as the "Son of Ptah",<ref>[[Miriam Lichtheim]], ''Ancient Egyptian Literature: A Book of Readings'', University of California Press 1980, {{ISBN|0-520-04020-1}}, p. 106</ref> his mother was sometimes claimed to be [[Sekhmet]], the patron of [[Upper Egypt]] whose consort was [[Ptah]].

The Upper Egyptian [[Famine Stela]], which dates from the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic period]] (305–30 BC), bears an inscription containing a legend about a famine lasting seven years during the reign of [[Djoser]]. Imhotep is credited with having been instrumental in ending it. One of his priests explained the connection between the god [[Khnum]] and the rise of the [[Nile]] to the Pharaoh, who then had a dream in which the Nile god spoke to him, promising to end the drought.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/famine_stele.htm |title=The Famine Stele on the Island of Sehel |publisher=Reshafim.org.il |accessdate=2015-06-23}}</ref>

A [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] papyrus from the temple of [[Tebtunis]], dating to the 2nd century AD, preserves a long story about Imhotep.<ref>[[Kim Ryholt]], 'The Life of Imhotep?', ''Actes du IXe Congrès International des Études Démotiques'', edited by G. Widmer and D. Devauchelle, Bibliothèque d'étude 147, Le Caire, Institut français d'archéologie orientale, 2009, pp. 305–315.</ref>The Pharaoh Djoser plays a prominent role in the story, which also mentions Imhotep's family; his father the god Ptah, his mother Khereduankh, and his younger sister [[Ranpatnafrat|Renpetneferet]]. At one point Djoser desires Renpetneferet, and Imhotep disguises himself and tries to rescue her. The text also refers to the royal tomb of Djoser. Part of the legend includes an anachronistic battle between the Old Kingdom and the Assyrian armies where Imhotep fights an [[Assyria]]n sorceress in a duel of magic.<ref>[[Kim Ryholt]], ''The Assyrian invasion of Egypt in Egyptian literary tradition'', in Assyria and Beyond, Nederlands Instituut voor het Nabije Oosten 2004, {{ISBN|9062583113}}, p. 501</ref>

As an instigator of Egyptian culture, Imhotep's idealized image lasted well into the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman period]]. In the Ptolemaic period, the Egyptian priest and historian [[Manetho]] credited him with inventing the method of a stone-dressed building during Djoser's reign, though he was not the first to actually build with stone. Stone walling, flooring, [[Lintel (architecture)|lintels]], and jambs had appeared sporadically during the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Archaic Period]], though it is true that a building of the size of the step pyramid made entirely out of stone had never before been constructed. Before Djoser, Pharaohs were buried in [[mastaba]] tombs.

===Medicine===
[[Egyptologist]] [[James Peter Allen]] states that "The Greeks equated him with their own god of medicine, [[Asklepios]], although ironically there is no evidence that Imhotep himself was a physician."<ref name="Allen">{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=James Peter|title=The Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300107289|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNbVl5LOjHUC&q=+Imhotep|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
[[Imhotep (The Mummy)|Imhotep]] is the antagonistic title character of Universal's 1932 film ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reid|first1=Danny|title=The Mummy (1932) Review, with Boris Karloff and David Manners|url=http://pre-code.com/mummy-1932-review-boris-karloff/|website=Pre-Code.com|date=April 24, 2014|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref> and its 1999 [[The Mummy (1999 film)|remake]], along with a [[The Mummy Returns|sequel to the remake]].<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|last1=Holden|first1=Stephen|title=Sarcophagus, Be Gone: Night of the Living Undead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E06E0D7103CF934A35756C0A96F958260|website=NYTimes.com|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>
