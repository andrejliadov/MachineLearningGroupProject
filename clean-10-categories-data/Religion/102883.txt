{{short description|Psychological state of holding a proposition or premise to be true}}
{{Epistemology sidebar}}
A '''belief''' is an [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] that something is the case, or that some [[proposition]] about the world is [[truth|true]].<ref>{{citation |last= Primmer |first= Justin |editor-last= Primmer |editor-first= Justin |contribution= Belief |title= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= The Metaphysics Research Lab |location= Stanford, CA |year= 2018|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/ |accessdate= 2008-09-19}}</ref> In [[epistemology]], philosophers use the term "belief" to refer to attitudes about the world which can be either [[truth value|true or false]].<ref name="SEP Belief">{{cite web |title=Belief |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=22 June 2020}}</ref> To believe something is to take it to be true; for instance, to believe that snow is white is comparable to accepting the truth of the [[proposition]] "snow is white". However, holding a belief does not require active [[introspection]]. For example, few carefully consider whether or not the sun will rise tomorrow, simply assuming that it will. Moreover, beliefs need not be ''occurrent'' (e.g. a person actively thinking "snow is white"), but can instead be ''dispositional'' (e.g. a person who if asked about the color of snow would assert "snow is white").<ref name="SEP Belief"/> 

There are various different ways that contemporary philosophers have tried to describe beliefs, including as representations of ways that the world could be ([[Jerry Fodor]]), as dispositions to act as if certain things are true ([[Roderick Chisholm]]), as interpretive schemes for making sense of someone's actions ([[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]), or as mental states that fill a particular function ([[Hilary Putnam]]).<ref name="SEP Belief"/> Some have also attempted to offer significant revisions to our notion of belief, including [[Eliminativism|eliminativists]] about belief who argue that there is no phenomenon in the natural world which corresponds to our [[folk psychology|folk psychological]] concept of belief ([[Paul Churchland]]) and [[Formal epistemology|formal epistemologists]] who aim to replace our bivalent notion of belief ("either we have a belief or we don't have a belief") with the more permissive, probabilistic notion of credence ("there is an entire spectrum of degrees of belief, not a simple dichotomy between belief and non-belief").<ref name="SEP Belief"/><ref name="SEP Formal Belief">{{cite web |title=Formal Representations of Belief |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/formal-belief/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=22 June 2020}}</ref>

Beliefs are the subject of various important philosophical debates. Notable examples include: "What is the rational way to revise one's beliefs when presented with various sorts of evidence?"; "Is the content of our beliefs entirely determined by our mental states, or do the relevant facts have any bearing on our beliefs (e.g. if I believe that I'm holding a glass of water, is the non-mental fact that water is H<sub>2</sub>O part of the content of that belief)?"; "How fine-grained or coarse-grained are our beliefs?"; and "Must it be possible for a belief to be expressible in language, or are there non-linguistic beliefs?".<ref name="SEP Belief"/>

==Psychology==
Mainstream psychology and related disciplines have traditionally treated belief as if it were the simplest form of mental representation and therefore one of the building blocks of conscious thought. Philosophers have tended to be more abstract in their analysis, and much of the work examining the viability of the belief concept stems from philosophical analysis.

The concept of belief presumes a subject (the believer) and an object of belief (the proposition). So, like other [[propositional attitude]]s, belief implies the existence of [[mental state]]s and [[intentionality]], both of which are hotly debated topics in the [[philosophy of mind]], whose foundations and relation to brain states are still controversial.

Beliefs are sometimes divided into [[core beliefs]] (that are actively thought about) and [[dispositional belief]]s (that may be ascribed to someone who has not thought about the issue). For example, if asked "do you believe tigers wear pink pajamas?" a person might answer that they do not, despite the fact they may never have thought about this situation before.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bell |first1=V. |last2=Halligan |first2=P.W. |last3=Ellis |first3=H.D. |year=2006 |chapter=A Cognitive Neuroscience of Belief |editor1-first=Peter W. |editor1-last=Halligan |editor2-first=Mansel |editor2-last=Aylward |title=The Power of Belief: Psychological Influence on Illness, Disability, and Medicine |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-853010-7 }}</ref>

This has important implications for understanding the [[neuropsychology]] and [[neuroscience]] of belief. If the concept of belief is incoherent, then any attempt to find the underlying neural processes that support it will fail.

Philosopher [[Lynne Rudder Baker]] has outlined four main contemporary approaches to belief in her book ''Saving Belief'':<ref>{{cite book |first=Lynne Rudder |last=Baker |title=Saving Belief: A Critique of Physicalism |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-691-07320-0 }}</ref>
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is correct – Sometimes called the "mental sentence theory," in this conception, beliefs exist as coherent entities, and the way we talk about them in everyday life is a valid basis for scientific endeavour. [[Jerry Fodor]] was one of the principal defenders of this point of view.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief may not be entirely correct, but it is close enough to make some useful predictions – This view argues that we will eventually reject the idea of belief as we know it now, but that there may be a correlation between what we take to be a belief when someone says "I believe that snow is white" and how a future theory of psychology will explain this behaviour. Philosopher [[Stephen Stich]] has argued for this particular understanding of belief.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong and will be completely superseded by a radically different theory that will have no use for the concept of belief as we know it – Known as [[eliminativism]], this view (most notably proposed by [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]]) argues that the concept of belief is like obsolete theories of times past such as [[the four humours]] theory of medicine, or the [[phlogiston theory]] of combustion. In these cases science has not provided us with a more detailed account of these theories, but completely rejected them as valid scientific concepts to be replaced by entirely different accounts. The Churchlands argue that our common-sense concept of belief is similar in that as we discover more about neuroscience and the brain, the inevitable conclusion will be to reject the belief hypothesis in its entirety.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong; however, treating people, animals, and even computers as if they had beliefs is often a successful strategy – The major proponents of this view, [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Lynne Rudder Baker]], are both eliminativists in that they hold that beliefs are not a scientifically valid concept, but they do not go as far as rejecting the concept of belief as a predictive device. Dennett gives the example of playing a computer at chess. While few people would agree that the computer held beliefs, treating the computer as if it did (e.g. that the computer believes that taking the opposition's queen will give it a considerable advantage) is likely to be a successful and predictive strategy. In this understanding of belief, named by Dennett ''the [[intentional stance]]'', belief-based explanations of mind and behaviour are at a different level of explanation and are not reducible to those based on fundamental neuroscience, although both may be explanatory at their own level.
Strategic approaches make a distinction between rules, norms and beliefs as follows:
* Rules. Explicit regulative processes such as policies, laws, inspection routines, or incentives. Rules function as a coercive regulator of behavior and are dependent upon the imposing entity's ability to enforce them.
* Norms. Regulative mechanisms accepted by the social collective. Norms are enforced by normative mechanisms within the organization and are not strictly dependent upon law or regulation.
* Beliefs. The collective perception of fundamental truths governing behavior. The adherence to accepted and shared beliefs by members of a social system will likely persist and be difficult to change over time. Strong beliefs about determinant factors (i.e., security, survival, or honor) are likely to cause a social entity or group to accept rules and norms.<ref>Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012). Information Operations. Joint Publication 3–13. Joint Doctrine Support Division, Suffolk, VA. p. 22.</ref>

==Historical conceptions of belief==
In the context of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek thought]], three related concepts were identified regarding the concept of belief: ''[[Pistis#Pistis in rhetoric|pistis]],'' ''[[doxa]],'' and ''[[dogma]].'' Simplified, ''pistis'' refers to "[[Trust (social science)|trust]]" and "confidence," ''doxa'' refers to "[[opinion]]" and "acceptance," and ''dogma'' refers to the [[Philosophical theory|positions]] of a philosopher or of a [[Philosophical movement|philosophical school]] such as [[Stoicism]].

== Emotion and beliefs ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2020}}
Research has indicated that [[emotion]] and cognition act in conjunction to produce beliefs, and more specifically emotion plays a vital role in the formation and maintenance of beliefs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Emotions and Beliefs|last=Frijda|first=Nico H|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780511659904}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mercer|first=Jonathan|date=January 2010|title=Emotional Beliefs|journal=International Organization|volume=65|pages=1–31|doi=10.1017/S0020818309990221}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Harlé|first1=Katia M.|last2=Shenoy|first2=Pradeep|last3=Paulus|first3=Martin P.|date=2013-09-19|title=The influence of emotions on cognitive control: feelings and beliefs—where do they meet?|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=7|pages=508|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00508|issn=1662-5161|pmc=3776943|pmid=24065901}}</ref>

==Formation==
[[File:Ripples of influence.jpg|thumb|We are influenced by many factors that ripple through our minds as our beliefs form, evolve, and may eventually change]]
Psychologists study belief formation and the relationship between beliefs and actions. Three models of belief formation and change have been proposed:

===Conditional inference process===
When people are asked to estimate the likelihood that a statement is true, they search their memory for information that has implications for the validity of this statement. Once this information has been identified, they estimate the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were true, and the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were false. If their estimates for these two [[Probability|probabilities]] differ, people average them, weighting each by the likelihood that the information is true and false. Thus, information bears directly on beliefs of another, related statement.<ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005">Wyer, R.S., & Albarracin, D. (2005). Belief formation, organization, and change: Cognitive and motivational influences. In D. Albarracin, B.T. Johnson, & M.P. Zanna, The Handbook of Attitudes (273–322). New York: Psychology Press.</ref>

===Linear models===
Unlike the previous model, this one takes into consideration the possibility of multiple factors influencing belief formation. Using regression procedures, this model predicts belief formation on the basis of several different pieces of information, with weights assigned to each piece on the basis of their relative importance.<ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005" />

===Information processing models and change===
These models address the fact that the responses people have to belief-relevant information is unlikely to be predicted from the objective basis of the information that they can recall at the time their beliefs are reported. Instead, these responses reflect the number and meaning of the thoughts that people have about the message at the time that they encounter it.<ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005" />

Some influences on people's belief formation include:

* Internalization of beliefs during childhood, which can form and shape our beliefs in different domains. [[Albert Einstein]] is often quoted as having said that "Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen." Political beliefs depend most strongly on the political beliefs most common in the community where we live.<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Andrew Gelman |first1=Andrew |last1=Gelman |first2=David |last2=Park |first3=Boris |last3=Shor |first4=Joseph |last4=Bafumi |first5=Jeronimo |last5=Cortina |title=Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State: Why Americans Vote the Way They Do |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-691-13927-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/redstatebluestat00gelm }}</ref> Most individuals believe the [[religion]] they were taught in childhood.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Argyle |title=The Psychology of Religious Behaviour, Belief and Experience |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-415-12330-3 |page=25 |quote=Religion, in most cultures, is ascribed, not chosen. }}</ref>
* Charismatic leaders can form or modify beliefs (even if those beliefs fly in the face of all previous beliefs).<ref>{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Hoffer |title=The True Believer |location=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-06-050591-2 }}</ref> Rational individuals need to reconcile their direct reality with any said belief; therefore, if belief is not present or possible, it reflects the fact that contradictions were necessarily overcome using [[cognitive dissonance]].
*[[Advertising]] can form or change beliefs through repetition, shock, and association with images of sex, love, beauty, and other strong positive emotions.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Jane |last1=Kilbourne |first2=Mary |last2=Pipher |title=Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel |publisher=Free Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-684-86600-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/cantbuymylovehow00kilb }}</ref> Contrary to intuition, a delay, known as the [[sleeper effect]], instead of immediate succession may increase an advertisement's ability to persuade viewer's beliefs if a discounting cue is present.<ref>see Kumkale & Albarracin, 2004</ref>
* Physical trauma, especially to the head, can radically alter a person's beliefs.<ref>{{cite book |first=Babette |last=Rothschild |title=The Body Remembers: The Psychophysiology of Trauma and Trauma Treatment |publisher=W.W. Norton & Company |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-393-70327-6 }}</ref>

However, even educated people, well aware of the process by which beliefs form, still strongly cling to their beliefs, and act on those beliefs even against their own self-interest. In Anna Rowley's book, ''Leadership Therapy'', she states "You want your beliefs to change. It's proof that you are keeping your eyes open, living fully, and welcoming everything that the world and people around you can teach you." This means that peoples' beliefs should evolve as they gain new experiences.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rowley |first=Anna |title=Leadership Therapy: Inside the Mind of Microsoft |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |page=[https://archive.org/details/leadershiptherap0000rowl/page/69 69] |isbn=978-1-4039-8403-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/leadershiptherap0000rowl/page/69 }}</ref>

==Modification of beliefs==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2020}}
{{see also|Belief revision}}
An extensive amount of scientific research and philosophical discussion exists around the modification of beliefs, which is commonly referred to as belief revision.
Generally speaking, the process of belief revision entails the believer weighing the set of truths and/or evidence, and the dominance of a set of truths or evidence on an alternative to a held belief can lead to revision. One process of belief revision is [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian updating]] and is often referenced for its mathematical basis and conceptual simplicity. However, such a process may not be representative for individuals whose beliefs are not easily characterized as probabilistic.

There are several techniques for individuals or groups to change the beliefs of others; these methods generally fall under the umbrella of [[persuasion]]. Persuasion can take on more specific forms such as [[consciousness raising]] when considered in an activist or political context.
Belief modification may also occur as a result of the experience of outcomes. Because [[goal]]s are based, in part on beliefs, the success or failure at a particular goal may contribute to modification of beliefs that supported the original goal.

Whether or not belief modification actually occurs is dependent not only on the extent of truths or evidence for the alternative belief, but also characteristics outside the specific truths or evidence. This includes, but is not limited to: the source characteristics of the message, such as [[Source credibility|credibility]]; [[Peer pressure|social pressures]]; the anticipated consequences of a modification; or the ability of the individual or group to act on the modification. Therefore, individuals seeking to achieve belief modification in themselves or others need to consider all possible forms of resistance to belief revision.

==Prediction==
Different psychological models have tried to predict people's beliefs and some of them try to estimate the exact probabilities of beliefs. For example, [[Robert S. Wyer|Robert Wyer]] developed a model of subjective probabilities.<ref name="Wyer, R. S. 1970">{{cite journal |last=Wyer |first=R.S. |year=1970 |title=Quantitative prediction of belief and opinion change: A further test of a subjective probability model |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=559–570 |doi=10.1037/h0030064 }}</ref><ref name="WyerGoldberg">{{cite journal |last1=Wyer |first1=R.S. |last2=Goldberg |first2=L. |year=1970 |title=A probabilistic analysis of the relationships among beliefs and attitudes |journal=Psychological Review |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=100–120 |doi=10.1037/h0028769 }}</ref> When people rate the likelihood of a certain statement (e.g., "It will rain tomorrow"), this rating can be seen as a subjective probability value. The subjective probability model posits that these subjective probabilities follow the same rules as objective probabilities. For example, the [[law of total probability]] might be applied to predict a subjective probability value. Wyer found that this model produces relatively accurate predictions for probabilities of single events and for changes in these probabilities, but that the probabilities of several beliefs linked by "and" or "or" do not follow the model as well.<ref name="Wyer, R. S. 1970" /><ref name="WyerGoldberg" />

==Knowledge and epistemology==
{{Main|Epistemology}}
[[File:Classical_definition_of_Kno.svg|thumb|236px<!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)-->|A [[Venn diagram]] illustrating the traditional definition of knowledge as justified true belief (represented by the yellow circle). The Gettier problem gives us reason to think that not all justified true beliefs constitute knowledge.]]
[[Epistemology]] is concerned with delineating the boundary between justified belief and [[opinion]],<ref>Oxford Dictionaries – [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/epistemology definition] published by [[OUP]] [Retrieved 2015-08-09]</ref> and involved generally with a theoretical [[philosophical]] study of [[knowledge]]. The primary problem in epistemology is to understand exactly what is needed in order for us to have knowledge. In a notion derived from [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', where the epistemology of Socrates (Platon) most clearly departs from that of the [[sophist]]s, who at the time of Plato seem to have defined knowledge as what is here expressed as "[[justified true belief]]". The tendency to translate from belief (here: doxa – common opinion) to knowledge (here: episteme), which Plato (e.g. [[Socrates]] of the dialogue) utterly dismisses, results from failing to distinguish a [[dispositive]] belief (gr. 'doxa', not 'pistis') from knowledge (episteme) when the opinion is regarded ''true'' (here: orthé), in terms of right, and juristically so (according to the premises of the dialogue), which was the task of the [[rhetor]]s to prove. Plato dismisses this possibility of an affirmative relation between belief (i.e. opinion) and [[knowledge]] even when the one who opines grounds his belief on the rule, and is able to add ''justification'' (gr. [[logos]]: reasonable and necessarily plausible assertions/evidence/guidance) to it.<ref>http://www.friesian.com/knowledg.htm – 2007, 2008 Kelley L. Ross, Ph.D.</ref>

Plato has been credited for the "''justified true belief''" theory of knowledge, even though Plato in the [[Theaetetus (dialogue)]] elegantly dismisses it, and even posits this argument of Socrates as a cause for his death penalty. Among American epistemologists, [[Edmund Gettier|Gettier]] (1963)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gettier|first=E.L.|year=1963|title=Is justified true belief knowledge?|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01439314/file/2013%20Gettier%20Conocimiento.pdf|journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]]|volume=23|issue=6|pages=121–123|doi=10.1093/analys/23.6.121|jstor=3326922}}</ref> and [[Alvin Goldman|Goldman]] (1967),<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=A.I.|s2cid=53049561|year=1967|title=A causal theory of knowing|journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]]|volume=64|issue=12|pages=357–372|doi=10.2307/2024268|jstor=2024268}}</ref> have questioned the "justified true belief" definition, and challenged the "sophists" of their time.

===Justified true belief<!--Justified true belief' redirects here-->===
'''Justified true belief'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> is a definition of [[knowledge]] that gained approval during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], "justified" standing in contrast to "revealed". There have been attempts to trace it back to [[Plato]] and his dialogues, more specifically in the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]<ref>The received view holds it that Plato's theory presents knowledge as remembering eternal truths and justification reawakens memory, see {{cite book|title=Plato on Knowledge and Forms: Selected Essays|last=Fine|first=G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-924558-1|location=New York|pages=5–7|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> The concept of justified true belief states that in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but also have justification for doing so. In more formal terms, an agent <math>S</math> knows that a proposition <math>P</math> is true [[if and only if]]:
*<math>P</math> is true
*<math>S</math> believes that <math>P</math> is true, and
*<math>S</math> is justified in believing that <math>P</math> is true

This theory of knowledge suffered a significant setback with the discovery of [[Gettier problem]]s, situations in which the above conditions were seemingly met but where many philosophers deny that anything is known.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Foundations of Knowing|last=Chisholm|first=Roderick|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1982|isbn=978-0-8166-1103-4|location=Minneapolis|chapter=Knowledge as Justified True Belief|author-link=Roderick Chisholm}}</ref> [[Robert Nozick]] suggested a [[Gettier problems#Fred Dretske's conclusive reasons and Robert Nozick's truth-tracking|clarification]] of "justification" which he believed eliminates the problem: the justification has to be such that were the justification false, the knowledge would be false.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674664791|title=Philosophical explanations|last=Nozick, Robert.|date=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674664485|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=7283862}}</ref> Bernecker and Dretske (2000) argue that "no epistemologist since Gettier has seriously and successfully defended the traditional view."<ref>{{cite book|title=Knowledge.

===Epistemology versus religion===
Historically ''belief-in'' belonged in the realm of religious thought, ''belief-that'' instead belonged to epistemological considerations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=H.H.|year=1965|title=Belief 'In' and Belief 'That'|journal=Religious Studies|volume=1|issue=1|pages=5–27|doi=10.1017/S0034412500002304}}</ref>

====Belief-in====
To "believe in" someone or something is a distinct concept from "believing-that." There are at least these types of belief-in:<ref>{{cite journal|last=MacIntosh|first=J.J.|year=1994|title=Belief-in Revisited: A Reply to Williams|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-15948893/belief-revisited-reply-williams.html|journal=Religious Studies|volume=30|issue=4|pages=487–503|doi=10.1017/S0034412500023131}}</ref>

*''Commendatory'' / ''[[faith]]'' – we may make an expression of 'faith' in respect of some performance by an agent X, when without prejudice to the truth value of the factual outcome or even confidence in X otherwise, we expect that specific performance. In particular [[self-confidence]] or faith in one's self is this kind of belief.
*''Existential claim'' – to claim belief in the existence of an entity or phenomenon in a general way with the implied need to justify its claim of existence. It is often used when the entity is not real, or its existence is in doubt. "He believes in witches and ghosts" or "many children believe in [[Santa Claus]]" or "I believe in a deity" are typical examples.<ref name="belief-in">{{cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|title-link=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|last=Macintosh|first=Jack|isbn=978-0-19-926479-7|page=86|chapter=Belief-in}}</ref> The linguistic form is distinct from the assertion of the truth of a proposition since verification is either considered impossible or irrelevant or a [[counterfactual]] situation is assumed.

====Belief-that====
=====Economic belief=====
{{See|Economic ideology}}
Economic beliefs are beliefs which are reasonably and necessarily contrary to the tenet of rational choice or instrumental rationality.<ref>Peter Taylor-Gooby – [https://www.issa.int/html/pdf/jeru98/theme3/3-1a.pdf Economic Beliefs and Social Policy Behaviour] [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (Economic Beliefs and behaviour research programme) [Retrieved 2015-08-09]</ref>

Studies of the Austrian tradition of the economic thought, in the context of analysis of the influence and subsequent degree of change resulting from existing economic knowledge and belief, has contributed the most to the subsequent holistic collective analysis.<ref name="R.

=====Delusion=====
Insofar as the truth of belief is expressed in sentential and propositional form we are using the sense of ''belief-that'' rather than ''belief-in''. [[Delusion]] arises when the truth value of the form is clearly nil.<ref name="L. Bortolotti">{{cite book|title=Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs|author=L.

Delusions are defined as beliefs in [[psychiatric]] diagnostic criteria<ref>[http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2013/06/delusions-in-dsm-5.html ''Delusions in the DSM 5''] A blog by Lisa Bortolotti & Ema Sullivan-Bissett</ref> (for example in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''). Psychiatrist and historian [[G.E. Berrios]] has challenged the view that delusions are genuine beliefs and instead labels them as "empty speech acts," where affected persons are motivated to express false or bizarre belief statements due to an underlying psychological disturbance. However, the majority of mental health professionals and researchers treat delusions as if they were genuine beliefs.

=====Science=====
In scientific [[medical writing]], the verb 'believe' can mean "actively accept as true" on the basis of external [[Scientific evidence|evidence]] (for example, a statement of the type, "we believe that ''x'' is a better treatment than ''y'' in this disease" can imply that "after examining the available evidence, we have concluded that ''x'' is...").<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/medicalstyleform00huth/page/264|title=Medical Style & Format: An International Manual for Authors, Editors, and Publishers|last=Huth|first=Edward J|publisher=ISI Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0-89495-063-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/medicalstyleform00huth/page/264 264]}}</ref>

==Religion==

Religious belief refers to attitudes towards [[mythological]], [[supernatural]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] aspects of a [[religion]].{{cn|date=October 2020}} Religious belief is distinct from [[religious ritual|religious practice]] and from [[religious behaviour]]s – with some believers not practicing [[religion]] and some practitioners not believing religion. Religious beliefs, deriving from ideas that are exclusive to religion,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} often relate to the existence, characteristics and worship of a [[deity]] or deities, to the idea of [[Miracle|divine intervention]] in the [[universe]] and in [[Personal life|human life]], or to the [[deontological]] explanations for the values and practices centered on the teachings of a [[spiritual leader]] or [[community]]. In contrast to other [[belief system]]s, religious beliefs are usually [[Codification (law)|codified]].<ref>{{cite book | title = Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology and Religious Belief | publisher = University of California Press | author = Wittgenstein, Ludwig | year = 2007 | pages = 53 | isbn = 978-0-520-25181-6}}</ref>

===Forms===
A popular view holds that different religions each have identifiable and exclusive sets of beliefs or [[creed]]s, but surveys of religious belief have often found that the official doctrine and descriptions of the beliefs offered by [[religious authority|religious authorities]] do not always agree with the privately held beliefs of those who identify as members of a particular religion.<ref>{{cite book | title = An empiricist's view of the nature of religious belief | publisher = Norwood Editions (Norwood, Pa.) | author = Braithwaite, R.B. | year = 1975 | isbn = 978-0-88305-955-5}}</ref> For a broad classification of the kinds of religious belief, see below.

====Fundamentalism====
{{Main|Religious fundamentalism}}
First self-applied as a term to the conservative doctrine outlined by anti-modernist [[Protestants]] in the United States,<ref name="A.C. Dixon">{{cite web |date= 2012-11-27 |url = http://user.xmission.com/~fidelis/volume1/volume1.php |title = The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth |accessdate = 2012-11-28 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121203144842/http://user.xmission.com/~fidelis/volume1/volume1.php |archive-date = 3 December 2012 }}</ref> "fundamentalism" in religious terms denotes strict adherence to an interpretation of scriptures that are generally associated with theologically conservative positions or traditional understandings of the text and are distrustful of innovative readings, new revelation, or alternative interpretations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Religious fundamentalism has been identified{{by whom|date=November 2017}} in the media as being associated with [[fanaticism|fanatical]] or [[zealotry|zealous]] political movements around the world that have used a strict adherence to a particular religious doctrine as a means to establish political identity and to enforce societal norms.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

====Orthodoxy====
{{Main|Orthodoxy}}
First used in the context of [[Early Christianity]], the term "orthodoxy" relates to religious belief that closely follows the edicts, [[apologetics|apologies]], and [[hermeneutics]] of a prevailing religious authority. In the case of Early Christianity, this authority was the communion of bishops, and is often referred to by the term "[[Magisterium]]". The term ''orthodox'' was applied{{when|date= November 2017}} almost as an epithet to a group of Jewish believers who held to pre-Enlightenment understanding of Judaism – now known as [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] of Christianity and the [[Catholic Church]] each consider themselves to be the true heir to Early Christian belief and practice. The antonym of "orthodox" is "[[heterodox]]", and those adhering to orthodoxy often accuse the heterodox of [[apostasy]], [[schism (religion)|schism]], or [[heresy]].

====Modernism/reform====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}
The [[Renaissance]] and later the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe exhibited varying degrees of [[religious tolerance]] and intolerance towards new and old religious ideas. The ''[[philosophes]]'' took particular exception to many of the more fantastical claims of religions and directly challenged religious authority and the prevailing beliefs associated with the established churches. In response to the liberalizing political and social movements, some religious groups attempted to integrate Enlightenment ideals of rationality, equality, and individual liberty into their belief systems, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Liberal Christianity]] offer two examples of such religious associations.

===Approaches to others===
Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions or by other [[religious denomination]]s in a variety of ways.

====Exclusivism====
{{See also|Religious exclusivism}}
People with exclusivist beliefs typically explain other beliefs either as in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the [[one true faith|true faith]]. This approach is a fairly consistent feature among smaller [[new religious movement]]s that often rely on doctrine that claims a unique [[revelation]] by the [[Founders of religious traditions|founders]] or [[leader]]s, and considers it a matter of faith that the "correct" religion has a monopoly on truth. All three major [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic monotheistic religions]] have passages in their holy scriptures that attest to the primacy of the scriptural testimony, and indeed [[monotheism]] itself is often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} vouched{{by whom|date= November 2017}} as an innovation characterized specifically by its explicit rejection of earlier polytheistic faiths.

Some exclusivist faiths incorporate a specific element of [[proselytization]]. This is a strongly-held belief in the Christian tradition which follows the doctrine of the [[Great Commission]], and is less emphasized by the Islamic faith where the [[Quran]]ic edict "There shall be no compulsion in religion" (2:256) is often quoted as a justification for toleration of alternative beliefs. The [[Conversion to Judaism|Jewish tradition]] does not actively seek out converts.

Exclusivism correlates with conservative, fundamentalist, and orthodox approaches of many religions, while pluralistic and syncretist approaches either explicitly downplay or reject the exclusivist tendencies within a religion.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Inclusivism====
People with [[inclusivism|inclusivist]] beliefs recognize some truth in all faith [[system]]s, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences. This attitude is sometimes associated{{by whom|date= November 2017}} with [[Interfaith dialog]]ue or with the Christian [[Ecumenical]] movement, though in principle such attempts at pluralism are not necessarily inclusivist and many actors in such interactions (for example, the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) still hold to exclusivist dogma while participating in inter-religious organizations.

Explicitly inclusivist religions include many that are associated with the [[New Age]] movement, as well as modern reinterpretations of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Baháʼí Faith]] considers it doctrine that there is truth in all faith-systems.

====Pluralism====
{{Main|Religious pluralism}}
People with [[religious pluralism|pluralist]] beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture.

====Syncretism====
{{Main|Syncretism}}
People with syncretic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular [[experience]]s and contexts (''see'' [[eclecticism]]). [[Unitarian Universalism]] exemplifies a syncretic faith.

===Adherence===
{{See also|Existence of God}}
Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:
* Some see belief in a deity as necessary for [[Morality|moral behavior]].<ref name="moore">Compare: {{cite magazine | date= 2005-03-07 | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/110/13.0.html | title = Roy Moore: 'We Have No Morality Without an Acknowledgment of God' | magazine = [[Christianity Today]] | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}</ref>
* Some regard religious practices as serene, beautiful, and conducive to religious experiences, which in turn support religious beliefs.<ref>{{cite web | last= Miller | first = David Ian | date = 2005-02-15 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2005/02/15/findrelig.DTL | title = Finding My Religion: Steve Georgiou on his faith and mentor, minimalist poet Robert Lax | publisher = SFGate | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}</ref>
* Organized religions promote a [[sense of community]] among their followers, and the moral and cultural common ground of these communities makes them attractive to people with similar [[values]].<ref name="repa">{{cite web | last = Repa | first = J. Theodore | date = 1998-10-18 | url = http://pages.nyu.edu/~jtr1/sermon.htm | title = Building Community: The Marriage of Religion and Education | accessdate = 2006-05-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907172411/http://pages.nyu.edu/~jtr1/sermon.htm | archive-date = 7 September 2006 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Indeed, while religious beliefs and practices are usually connected, some individuals with substantially secular beliefs still participate in religious practices for cultural reasons.<ref>Note for example the concept of a [[cultural Christian]].</ref>
* Each religion asserts that it is a means by which its adherents may come into closer contact with the Divine, with Truth, and with [[spiritual power]]. They all promise to free adherents from spiritual bondage, and to bring them into spiritual freedom. It naturally follows that a religion which can free its adherents from deception, sin, and spiritual death will have significant mental-health benefits. [[Abraham Maslow]]'s research after [[World War II]] showed that [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors tended to be those who held strong religious beliefs (not necessarily temple attendance, etc.), suggesting that belief helped people cope in extreme circumstances. [[Humanistic psychology]] went on to investigate how religious or spiritual identity may have correlations with longer lifespan and better health. The study found that humans may particularly need religious ideas to serve various emotional needs such as the need to feel loved, the need to belong to homogeneous groups, the need for understandable explanations and the need for a guarantee of ultimate justice. Other factors may involve sense of [[purpose]], sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], or a sense of contact with the divine. See also ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', by [[Viktor Frankl]], detailing his experience with the importance of religion in surviving the Holocaust. Critics assert that the very fact that religion was the primary selector for research subjects may have introduced a bias, and that the fact that all subjects were Holocaust survivors may also have had an effect. According to Larson et al. (2000), "[m]ore longitudinal research with better multidimensional measures will help further clarify the roles of these [religious] factors and whether they are beneficial or harmful."<ref name="larson">{{cite journal | last= Larson | first = David B. |author2 = Susan S. Larson |author3 = Harold G. Koenig |date = October 2000 | title = Research Findings on Religious Commitment and Mental Health | journal = Psychiatric Times | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | url = http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/p001078.html | accessdate= 2006-05-19 }}</ref>

Psychologist [[James Alcock]] also summarizes a number of apparent benefits which reinforce religious belief. These include prayer appearing to account for successful resolution of problems, "a bulwark against existential anxiety and fear of annihilation," an increased sense of control, companionship with one's deity, a source of self-significance, and group identity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alcock |first1=James |author-link1=James Alcock |title=The God Engine |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=32–38}}</ref>

===Apostasy===
{{Main|Apostasy}}
{{See also|Existence of God#Arguments against belief in God}}
Typical reasons for rejection of religion include:
* Some people regard certain fundamental doctrines of some religions as illogical, contrary to experience, or unsupported by sufficient [[evidence]]; such people may reject one or more religions for those reasons.<ref name="russell">For example: {{cite web |last= Russell |first = Bertrand |author-link = Bertrand Russell |date = 1927|url = http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |title = Why I am Not a Christian |accessdate = 2006-05-19 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061119081311/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |archive-date = 2006-11-19}}</ref> Even some believers may have difficulty accepting particular religious assertions or doctrines. Some people believe the body of evidence available to humans to be insufficient to justify certain religious beliefs. They may thus disagree with religious interpretations of ethics and human purpose, or with various [[creation myth]]s. This reason has perhaps{{original research inline|date= November 2017}} been aggravated by the protestations and emphases of some [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]].
* Some religions include beliefs that certain groups of people are inferior or sinful and deserve contempt, persecution, or even death, and that non-believers will be punished for their unbelief in an [[after-life]].<ref>For example, some [[Muslim]]s believe that women are inferior to men. Some [[Christians]] share this belief. At the time of the [[American Civil War]] of 1861–1865, many Southerners used passages from the [[Bible]] to justify race-based [[slavery]]. Certain campaigners have used the Christian religion as a reason to persecute and to deny the rights of homosexuals, on the basis that the Christian biblical God disapproves of homosexuality, and by implication of homosexuals. Compare http://www.godhatesfags.com</ref> Adherents to a religion may feel antipathy to unbelievers. Numerous examples exist of people of one religion or sect using religion as an excuse to murder people with different religious beliefs. To mention just a few examples:
** the slaughter of the [[Huguenot]]s by French [[Catholics]] in the sixteenth century
** [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s killing each other when [[Pakistan]] separated from India in 1947
** the persecution and killing of [[Shiite]] Muslims by [[Sunni]] Muslims in Iraq
** the murder of [[Protestant]]s by [[Catholics]] and vice versa in [[Ireland]] (both of these examples in the late twentieth century)
** the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] that continues {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}} – According to some critics of religion, such beliefs can encourage completely unnecessary conflicts and in some cases even wars. Many [[atheist]]s believe that, because of this, religion is incompatible with world peace, freedom, civil rights, equality, and good government. On the other hand, most religions perceive atheism as a threat and will vigorously and even violently{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} defend themselves against religious sterilization, making the attempt to remove public religious practices a source of strife.<ref>Beauchamp, Philip (pseudonym of Jeremy Bentham) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qiRQAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover ''Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind''], 1822, R. Carlile, London, at page 76: "Of all human antipathies, that which the believer in a God bears to the unbeliever is the fullest, the most unqualified, and the most universal"</ref>
* Some people may be unable to accept the values that a specific religion promotes and will therefore not join that religion. They may also be unable to accept the proposition that those who do not believe will go to hell or be damned, especially if said nonbelievers are close to the person.
* The maintenance of [[Personal life|life]] and the achievement of [[self-esteem]] require of a person the fullest exercise of reason{{citation needed|date= November 2017}}—but morality (people are taught{{by whom|date=November 2017}}) rests on and requires faith.<ref>{{cite book

==Collective belief==
{{See also|Ideology|World view}}
A [[world view]] comprises a set of mutually supportive beliefs. The beliefs of any such system can be [[Religious belief|religious]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[politics|political]], [[Ideology|ideological]], or a combination of these. Philosopher [[Jonathan Glover]] says that beliefs are always part of a belief system, and that tenanted belief systems are difficult for the tenants to completely revise or reject.<ref name=BitesGlover/><ref>{{cite book|author= Elizabeth A. Minton, Lynn R. Khale|title= Belief Systems, Religion, and Behavioral Economics|year= 2014|location= New York|publisher= Business Expert Press LLC|isbn= 978-1-60649-704-3 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hk5pngEACAAJ}}</ref>{{qn|date= April 2019}} This insight has relevance for [[inquisitor]]s, [[missionaries]], [[agitprop]] groups and [[wiktionary:thought police|thought-police]].

[[Sociology|Sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote of collective beliefs and proposed that they, like all "[[social fact]]s", "inhered in" social [[Group (sociology)|groups]] as opposed to individual persons. [[Jonathan Dancy]] states that "Durkheim's discussion of collective belief, though suggestive, is relatively obscure".<ref>

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Margaret Gilbert]] (1942- ) has offered a related account in terms of the joint commitment of a number of persons as a body to accept a certain belief. According to this account, individuals who together collectively believe something need not personally believe it individually. Gilbert's work on the topic has stimulated a developing literature among philosophers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} One question that has arisen is whether and how philosophical accounts of belief in general need to be sensitive to the possibility of collective belief.

[[File:Snipa.JPG|thumb|right|240px| Philosopher Jonathan Glover warns that belief systems are like whole boats in the water; it is extremely difficult to alter them all at once (for example, it may be too stressful, or people may maintain their biases without realizing it).<ref name=BitesGlover/>]]
[[Jonathan Glover]] (1941- ) believes that he and other philosophers ought to play some role in starting dialogues between people with deeply-held, opposing beliefs, especially if there is risk of violence. Glover also believes that philosophy can offer insights about beliefs that would be relevant to such dialogue.

Glover suggests that beliefs have to be considered [[holistically]], and that no belief exists in isolation in the mind of the believer. Each belief always implicates and relates to other beliefs.<ref name=BitesGlover/> Glover provides the example of a patient with an illness who returns to a doctor, but the doctor says that the prescribed medicine is not working. At that point, the patient has a great deal of flexibility in choosing what beliefs to keep or reject: the patient could believe that the doctor is incompetent, that the doctor's assistants made a mistake, that the patient's own body is unique in some unexpected way, that Western medicine is ineffective, or even that Western science is entirely unable to discover truths about ailments.<ref name=BitesGlover/>

Glover maintains that any person can continue to hold any belief if they would really like to<ref name=BitesGlover/> (for example, with help from [[ad hoc hypotheses|''ad hoc'' hypotheses]]). One belief can be held fixed, and other beliefs will be altered around it. Glover warns that some beliefs may not be entirely [[Explicit memory|explicitly]] believed (for example, some people may not realize they have racist belief-systems adopted from their environment as a child). Glover believes that people tend to first realize that beliefs can change, and may be contingent on their upbringing, around age 12 or 15.<ref name=BitesGlover/>

Glover emphasizes that beliefs are difficult to change. He says that one may try to rebuild one's beliefs on more secure foundations ([[axioms]]), like building a new house, but warns that this may not be possible. Glover offers the example of [[René Descartes]], saying: "[Descartes] starts off with the characteristic beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman; he then junks the lot, he rebuilds the system, and somehow it looks a lot like the beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman." To Glover, belief systems are not like houses but are instead like boats. As Glover puts it: "Maybe the whole thing needs rebuilding, but inevitably at any point you have to keep enough of it intact to keep floating."<ref name=BitesGlover/>

Glover's final message is that if people talk about their beliefs, they may find more deep, relevant, philosophical ways in which they disagree (e.g., less obvious beliefs, or more-deeply-held beliefs). Glover thinks that people often manage to find agreements and consensus through philosophy. He says that at the very least, if people do not convert each other, they will hold their own beliefs more [[Open-mindedness|openminded]]ly and will be less likely to go to war over conflicting beliefs.<ref name=BitesGlover>[http://philosophybites.com/2011/10/jonathan-glover-on-systems-of-belief.html "Jonathan Glover on systems of belief", Philosophy Bites Podcast, Oct 9 2011]</ref><ref name=GloverBeliefs>[http://www.jonathanglover.co.uk/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts '' 'Philosophy, Beliefs, and Conflict' '', JonathanGlover.co.uk]</ref>

The British philosopher [[Stephen Law]] (1960-) has described some belief systems (including belief in [[homeopathy]], [[psychic powers]], and [[alien abduction]]) as [[wikt:claptrap|"claptrap"]] and says that such belief-systems can "draw people in and hold them captive so they become willing slaves of claptrap [...] if you get sucked in, it can be extremely difficult to think your way clear again".<ref>''[[New Scientist]]'' (magazine), 11 June 2011 [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028160.200-a-field-guide-to-bullshit.html A field guide to bullshit | New Scientist] - "Intellectual black holes are belief systems that draw people in and hold them captive so they become willing slaves of claptrap. Belief in homeopathy, psychic powers, alien abductions – these are examples of intellectual black holes. As you approach them, you need to be on your guard because if you get sucked in, it can be extremely difficult to think your way clear again."</ref>
