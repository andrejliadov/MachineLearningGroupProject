'''The Joshua Project''' is a Christian organization based in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], United States, which seeks to coordinate the work of [[Christian_mission#Contemporary_concepts_of_mission|missionary organizations]] to highlight the [[ethnic group]]s of the world with the fewest followers of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christianity]]. To do so, it maintains [[ethnologic]] data to support [[Christian missions]]. 

==History==
The project began in 1995 within the former [[AD2000]] and Beyond Movement.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thebeyondproject.org/ | title=Beyond Project}}</ref> From 2001 through 2005 the Joshua Project was at different times informally connected with the Caleb Project, and the International Christian Technologists Association (ICTA) and World Help.{{cn|date=September 2020}} In 2006, the Joshua Project officially became part of the [[U.S. Center for World Mission]], now called the [[Venture Center]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontierventures.org/ministries/joshua-project|title=Frontier Ventures|website=www.frontierventures.org}}</ref>

The goal of the project is to identify people who "do not have enough worshipers of Jesus Christ" and provide the needs and support to [[evangelize]] about Christianity and Jesus.

Focusing on ethnicity, the project maintains a database of "[[Unreached people group|unreached peoples]]" listed by country and language. As of 2010, they list 9,803 ethnic groups. These are further divided into 16,350 peoples-by-countries, counting national minorities individually for each of 236 countries, of which 6,642 are classified as "unreached peoples". Ethnic groups are organized hierarchically in 251 "People Clusters" which in turn are divided in 16 "Affinity Blocs" ([[Arab World]], [[East Asians]], [[Eurasia]]ns, [[Cushitic|Horn of Africa-Cushitic]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian-Median]], [[Jews]], [[Latin America#Ethnic groups|Latin-Caribbean Americans]], [[Malay peoples]], [[Demographics of North America|North American peoples]], [[Pacific Islanders]], [[South Asians]], [[Southeast Asians]], [[Sub-Saharan Africans]], [[Ethnic groups in Asia#Central Asia|Tibetan / Himalayan peoples]], [[Turkic peoples]] and Unclassified). Each ethnicity is listed as speaking at least one of 6,510 languages.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joshua Project |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/great-commission-statistics.php |title=Great Commission Statistics |publisher=Joshua Project |date= |accessdate=2010-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peoplegroups.org/Documents/26-6-joshua-project.pdf|title=peoplegroups.org, Joshua Project}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/joshua-project|title=Joshua Project: Bringing Definition to the Great Commission|first=Dan|last=Scribner|website=www.missionfrontiers.org}}</ref>

Some have criticized the organization for [[zealotry]] and disdain towards the non-Christian faiths.<ref name="auto">Christian Evangelism and The Joshua Project: An existential threat to Hinduism, K Bhattacharjee, 23 November, 2018</ref>
