'''''Shakubuku''''' {{Nihongo|"break and subdue"|折伏}} is a term that originates in the Chinese version of the [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist text]], ''[[Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra]]''.  

The term has historically been used to indicate the rebuttal of false teachings, and thereby break negative patterns in one's thoughts, words and deeds.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Granoff|first1=Phyllis|last2=Shinohara|first2=Koichi|title=Sins and sinners : perspectives from Asian religions|date=2012|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9004229469}}</ref>{{rp|133}} In modern times, the term often refers to the [[proselytism|proselytization]] and [[Religious conversion#Buddhism|conversion]] of new adherents in [[Nichiren Buddhism]] (see second President of [[Soka Gakkai]] [[Josei Toda]]), and the rebuttal of teachings regarded as heretical or preliminary.<ref name=moos>{{cite journal|last=Moos|first=Felix|title=Religion and Politics in Japan: The Case of the Soka Gakkai|journal=Asian Survey|date=March 1963|url=http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/1135/1/CEAS.1963.n6.pdf|accessdate=13 January 2014|doi=10.1525/as.1963.3.3.01p1616c }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last =McRae | first =John | year =2004 | title =The Sutra of Queen Śrīmālā of the Lion's Roar and the Vimalakīrti Sutra | place =Berkeley, CA | publisher =Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research | url =http://www.bdkamerica.org/digital/dBET_Srimala_Vimalakirti_2004.pdf | isbn =1886439311 | quote =All the remaining living beings who stubbornly cling to false teachings, instead of to the most profound Dharma, turn their backs to the True Dharma and habitually practice the corrupt ways of various heterodoxies.

Although often associated with the teachings of the [[Japanese Buddhist]] [[priest]] [[Nichiren]], the term appears often in the [[Taishō Tripiṭaka|SAT Daizokyo]] and the works of the Chinese [[Tiantai]] patriarchs [[Zhiyi]] and [[Zhanran]].  [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren Buddhist]] organizations such as [[Kokuchūkai]], [[Nichiren Shōshū]] and [[Soka Gakkai]] continue to use the term today, which is meant to underline or convince a counterpart of one's own interpretation of [[Buddhism]].

Another method of propagation mentioned by [[Nichiren]] is {{nihongo|''shōju''|摂受}}, which underlines the individual's own insight on Buddhism. Nichiren himself referred to both methods in his {{Nihongo|"Opening of the Eyes"|開目抄|Kaimokushō}}. A combination of the two is known as {{nihongo|''shōju-shakubuku''|摂受折伏}}.<ref name=Britannica>''Britannica Kokusai Dai-Hyakkajiten'' article on "shōju-shakubuku".</ref>In Japan, the term ''shakubuku'' is used when proselytising adherents of other Buddhist traditions, while ''shōju'' is used when proselytising non-Buddhists.  In the West today, though, ''shakubuku'' and ''shōju'' are interchangeably used to refer to the same method of proselytization of Nichiren Buddhism.<ref>A Dictionary of Buddhist Terms and Concepts.
