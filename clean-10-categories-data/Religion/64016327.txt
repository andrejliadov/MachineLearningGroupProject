In terms of religious comparison, [[Nicene Christianity|mainstream Christian denominations]] do not believe in [[reincarnation]] or the [[transmigration of the soul]], contrary to the beliefs of the Druze.<ref name=Nisan2002/> Where the [[reincarnation]] is a paramount tenet in the [[Druze]] faith.<ref>Seabrook, W. B., ''Adventures in Arabia'', Harrap and Sons 1928, (chapters on Druze religion)</ref> Christianity teaches [[evangelism]], often through the establishment of [[Christian mission|missions]], unlike the Druze who do not accept converts to their faith. Marriage outside the Druze faith is rare and is strongly discouraged.
