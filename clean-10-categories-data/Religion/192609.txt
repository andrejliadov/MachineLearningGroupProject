[[File:Poem by Martin Niemoeller at the the Holocaust memorial in Boston MA.jpg|300px|thumb|Engraving of the confession in poetic form presented at the [[New England Holocaust Memorial]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]]]

"'''First they came ...'''" is the poetic form of a [[post-war]] confessional [[prose]] by the German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor [[Martin Niemöller]] (1892–1984). It is about the [[cowardice]] of German [[Intelligentsia|intellectuals]] and certain clergy—including, by his own admission, Niemöller himself—following the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]]s' [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rise to power]] and subsequent incremental [[Purge|purging]] of their chosen targets, group after group. Many variations and adaptations in the spirit of the original have been published in the English language. It deals with themes of [[persecution]], [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[repentance]], and [[personal responsibility]].

Martin Niemöller was a German Lutheran pastor and theologian born in [[Lippstadt]], Germany, in 1892. Niemöller was an [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] and supported [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power at first. But when Hitler insisted on the supremacy of the state over religion, Niemöller became disillusioned. He became the leader of a group of German clergymen opposed to Hitler. In 1937 he was arrested and eventually confined in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. He was released in 1945 by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. He continued his career in Germany as a clergyman and as a leading voice of penance and reconciliation for the German people after [[World War II]].

== Origin ==
Niemöller made confession in his speech for the [[Confessing Church]] in [[Frankfurt]] on 6 January 1946, of which this is a partial translation:<ref name=quotation/>

{{bquote |
... the people who were put in the camps then were Communists. Who cared about them? We knew it, it was printed in the newspapers. Who raised their voice, maybe the Confessing Church? We thought: Communists, those opponents of religion, those enemies of Christians—"should I be my brother's keeper?"

Then they got rid of the sick, the so-called incurables. I remember a conversation I had with a person who claimed to be a Christian. He said: Perhaps it's right, these incurably sick people just cost the state money, they are just a burden to themselves and to others. Isn't it best for all concerned if they are taken out of the middle [of society]? Only then did the church as such take note.

Then we started talking, until our voices were again silenced in public. Can we say, we aren't guilty/responsible?

The persecution of the Jews, the way we treated the occupied countries, or the things in Greece, in Poland, in Czechoslovakia or in Holland, that were written in the newspapers. … I believe, we Confessing-Church-Christians have every reason to say: mea culpa, mea culpa! We can talk ourselves out of it with the excuse that it would have cost me my head if I had spoken out.

We preferred to keep silent. We are certainly not without guilt/fault, and I ask myself again and again, what would have happened, if in the year 1933 or 1934—there must have been a possibility—14,000 Protestant pastors and all Protestant communities in Germany had defended the truth until their deaths? If we had said back then, it is not right when Hermann Göring simply puts 100,000 Communists in the concentration camps, in order to let them die. I can imagine that perhaps 30,000 to 40,000 Protestant Christians would have had their heads cut off, but I can also imagine that we would have rescued 30–40,000 million [sic] people, because that is what it is costing us now.}}

This speech was translated and published in English in 1947, but was later retracted when it was alleged that Niemöller was an early supporter of the Nazis.<ref name="speech">{{cite web|author=Marcuse, Harold|url= http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/projects/niem/Niem1946GuiltHope13-16.htm |title=Of Guilt and Hope|author2= Niemöller, Martin |website=University of California at Santa Barbara}}</ref> The "sick, the so-called incurables" were killed in the euthanasia programme "[[Aktion T4]]". A 1955 version of the speech, mentioned in an interview of a German professor quoting Niemöller, lists Communists, socialists, schools, Jews, the press, and the Church. An American version delivered by a congressman in 1968 includes industrialists, who were only persecuted by the Nazis on an individual basis, and omits Communists.

Niemöller is quoted as having used many versions of the text during his career, but evidence identified by professor [[Harold Marcuse]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara|University of California Santa Barbara]] indicates that the Holocaust Memorial Museum version is inaccurate because Niemöller frequently used the word "[[Communism|communists]]" and not "[[Socialism|socialists]]."<ref name=quotation /> The substitution of "socialists" for "communists" is an effect of [[anti-communism]], and most common in the version that has proliferated in the United States. According to Harold Marcuse, "Niemöller's original argument was premised on naming groups he and his audience would instinctively not care about. The omission of Communists in Washington, and of Jews in Germany, distorts that meaning and should be corrected."<ref name=quotation />

In 1976, Niemöller gave the following answer in response to an interview question asking about the origins of the poem.<ref name=quotation /> The ''Martin-Niemöller-Stiftung'' ("Martin Niemöller Foundation") considers this the "classical" version of the speech:

{{bquote|
There were no minutes or copy of what I said, and it may be that I formulated it differently. But the idea was anyhow: The Communists, we still let that happen calmly; and the trade unions, we also let that happen; and we even let the Social Democrats happen. All of that was not our affair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://martin-niemoeller-stiftung.de/martin-niemoeller/was-sagte-niemoeller-wirklich |title=Was sagte Niemöller wirklich?|author=Niemöller, Martin|website=Martin Niemöller Foundation}}</ref>}}

== Role in Nazi Germany ==
Like most Protestant pastors, Niemöller was a [[national conservative]], and openly supported the conservative opponents of the [[Weimar Republic]]. He thus welcomed Hitler's accession to power in 1933, believing that it would bring a national revival. However, he decidedly opposed the Nazis' "[[Aryan paragraph|Aryan Paragraph]]". In 1936, he signed the petition of a group of Protestant churchmen which sharply criticized Nazi policies and declared the Aryan Paragraph incompatible with the Christian virtue of [[charity (virtue)|charity]].

The Nazi regime reacted with mass arrests and charges against almost 800 pastors and ecclesiastical lawyers.<ref>{{cite web|author=LeMO |url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/nazi/innenpolitik/bekennende/index.html |title=Die Bekennende Kirche |publisher=Dhm.de |accessdate=2014-06-19}}</ref>  By the autumn of 1934, Niemöller joined other Lutheran and Protestant churchmen such as [[Karl Barth]] and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] in founding the [[Confessional Church]], a Protestant group that opposed the Nazification of the German [[Landeskirche|Protestant churches]]. Author and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Thomas Mann]] published Niemöller's sermons in the United States and praised his bravery.

However, Niemöller only gradually abandoned his national socialist views and made pejorative remarks about Jews of faith while protecting—in his own church—baptised Christians, persecuted as Jews by the Nazis, due to their or their forefathers' Jewish descent. In one sermon in 1935, he remarked: "What is the reason for [their] obvious punishment, which has lasted for thousands of years? Dear brethren, the reason is easily given: the Jews brought the Christ of God to the cross!"<ref>The text of this sermon, in English, is found in Martin Niemöller, First Commandment, London, 1937, pp. 243–250.</ref>
