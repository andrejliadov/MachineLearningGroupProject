Anne Marie's grandmother, also a free Black, worked as a housekeeper for Charles Carroll (the only Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence) and was likely his concubine; Carroll presented Annie Marie's father with several of the Carroll family’s prized relics, paintings, and other keepsakes just before Carroll’s death in 1832.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Williams|first=Shannen Dee|date=2016-09-18|title=Congratulations Georgetown.

The oldest of seven children, Anne Marie began her formal education at the age of four at the white-operated Potter School in [[Washington, D.C.]] Race hostilities forced her to leave the school in 1812. Becraft continued her studies at another white-operated school, New Georgetown, until 1820, when it closed because white involvement in the education of black people was discouraged.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0XMXmwEACAAJ|title=Black Women in America: The Early Years, 1617-1899|last1=Hine|first1=Board of Trustees Professor of African American Studies and Professor of History Darlene Clark|last2=Hine|first2=Edited by Darlene Clark|date=1997-07-31|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=9780816034253|language=en}}</ref>

At 15, Becraft became the proprietor of a day school for girls. The school operated from a house on Dunbarton Street in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]]. There was an average of 35 girls who "comprised girls from the best colored families of Georgetown, Washington, Alexandria, and surrounding counties."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2eztAAAAMAAJ|title=Contributions of Black Women to America: Civil rights, politics and government, education, medicine, sciences|last=Davis|first=Marianna W.|date=1982|publisher=Kenday Press|language=en}}</ref> The school became known as the Georgetown Seminary and operated as an academy for boarders and day students, one of the first for females in the District. Becraft operated the school for eight years,<ref name=":0" /> at which point she resigned and moved to [[Baltimore]] in 1831 to join the [[Oblate Sisters of Providence]] in [[Baltimore]], the first [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religious institute for Catholic women of African descent. The school continued under the direction of Ellen Simonds.

== Religious life ==
On September 8, 1832, Becraft received the religious name Sister Aloysius (some sources say Sister Aloyons).<ref name=":1" /> The following year she took her vows and became the 11th sister to join the Oblates.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/emergenceofblack0000macg|url-access=registration|title=The Emergence of a Black Catholic Community: St. Augustine's in Washington|last=MacGregor|first=Morris J.|date=1999|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=9780813209432|language=en}}</ref> She was a teaching oblate who instructed her students in arithmetic, English and embroidery.<ref name=":0" />

On April 18, 2017, [[Georgetown University]] renamed Remembrance Hall (formerly McSherry Hall) after Becraft. The dedication of Anne Marie Becraft Hall was attended by Georgetown president [[John J. DeGioia|John DeGioia]], current students and administrators, and descendants of Becraft.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/georgetown-apologizes-renames-halls-after-slaves-n747976|title=Georgetown apologizes, renames halls after slaves|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref> Anne Marie Becraft Hall is the first building at Georgetown University to be named after an African-American woman.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehoya.com/viewpoint-celebrating-anne-marie-becraft/|title=VIEWPOINT: Celebrating Anne Marie Becraft|date=2017-04-18|work=[[The Hoya]]|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}</ref>

McSherry Hall was originally named after former Georgetown president Fr. [[William McSherry]], one of the two Jesuits who played a major role in the [[1838 Georgetown slave sale]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.georgetown.edu/news/liturgy-remembrance-contrition-hope-slavery|title=Georgetown Apologizes for 1838 Sale of 272 Slaves, Dedicates Buildings|website=www.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref> In November 2015, Georgetown University announced that the name of McSherry Hall would be temporarily changed to Remembrance Hall, based the recommendations of the university's 16-member Working Group on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation. Consisting of administrators, faculty and students, the group was convened by DeGioia in September to research the university's slavery-related sites. Mulledy Hall, named for the Rev. [[Thomas Mulledy]], S.J., the president who authorized the 1838 Georgetown slave sale of 272 enslaved Africans, was also temporarily changed to Freedom Hall.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/georgetown-university-to-rename-two-buildings-that-reflect-schools-ties-to-slavery/2015/11/15/e36edd32-8bb7-11e5-acff-673ae92ddd2b_story.html|title=Georgetown University to rename two buildings that reflect school's ties to slavery|last=Shaver|first=Katherine|date=2015-11-15|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

[[Marcia Chatelain]], associate professor of history and African American studies and a member of the Georgetown University Working Group on Slavery, Memory, and Reconciliation, described Becraft as "a devout Catholic and deeply committed to educating young girls of color in the nation’s capital. Though she experienced both anti-Catholic and anti-black intimidation, she nevertheless responded to her calling to teach and to serve God.”<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.georgetown.edu/news/anne-marie-becraft-hall|title=Building to Be Renamed for Pioneer Black Educator Anne Marie Becraft|website=www.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-04}}</ref>

The 1870 “Condition and Improvement of Public Schools in the District of Columbia" stated that Becraft "is remembered, wherever she was known, as a woman of the rarest sweetness and exaltation of Christian life, graceful and attractive in person and manners, gifted, well educated, and wholly devoted to doing good."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Special report of the commissioner of education on the condition and improvement of public schools in the District of Columbia :submitted to the Senate June, 1868, and to the House, with additions, June 13, 1870|last=|first=|date=1871|publisher=Washington, D.C. |isbn=|location=|pages=|hdl = 2027/hvd.32044028319382}}</ref>
