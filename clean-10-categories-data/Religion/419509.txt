{{Book of Mormon}}
Since the publication of the [[Book of Mormon]] in 1830, [[Mormons|Mormon]] [[archaeology|archaeologists]] have attempted to find archaeological evidence to support it.  Although [[historian]]s and archaeologists consider the book to be an [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] invention of [[Joseph Smith]], many members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and other denominations of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] believe that it describes ancient historical events in the [[Americas]].

The Book of Mormon principally describes [[God in Mormonism|God's]] dealings with two [[civilization]]s in the Americas over the course of several hundred years. The book primarily deals with the [[Nephite]]s and the [[Lamanites]], who - it states - existed in the Americas from about 600 BC to about AD 400. It also deals with the rise and fall of the [[Jaredites|Jaredite nation]], which the Book of Mormon says came from the [[Old World]] shortly after the [[confusion of tongues|confounding of the languages]] at the [[Tower of Babel]]. The Book of Mormon mentions several animals, plants, and technologies that are not substantiated by the archaeological record of the period 3100 BC to 400 AD in the Americas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|pp=74–77}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wolverton|2004|pp=84–85}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Persuitte|2000|p=102}}

Some early-20th century Mormons claimed various archaeological findings such as place names, and ruins of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Olmec]], and other ancient American and Old World civilizations as giving credence to the Book of Mormon record.<ref>{{Harvnb|Priddis|1975}}; see [http://www.centerplace.org/hs/dc/rdc-110.htm RLDS D&C 110:20], were advanced by [[Community of Christ|RLDS]] members: {{Harvnb|Hills|1917}}; {{Harvnb|Hills|1918}}; {{Harvnb|Hills|1924}}, and {{Harvnb|Gunsolley|1922}}</ref> Many current believers, including the LDS Church, have no strong position on whether or how to attribute the people in the narrative to specific groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/book-of-mormon-and-dna-studies?lang=eng|title=Book of Mormon and DNA Studies|last=Saints|first=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org|access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref>

==Archaeology research in pre-Columbian Americas and the Book of Mormon==
Numerous observers have suggested that the Book of Mormon appears to be a work of fiction that parallels others within the 19th-century "mound-builder" genre that was pervasive at the time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Silverberg|1969}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kennedy|1994}}.</ref><ref>Garlinghouse, Thomas, "Revisiting the Mound Builder Controversy", ''History Today'', September 2001, Vol. 51, Issue 9, p. 38.</ref><ref>Robert Silverberg, ''Mound Builders of Ancient America: The Archeology of a Myth'' (New York: New York Graphic Society, 1968); {{Harvnb|Silverberg|1969}}.</ref><ref>Curtis Dahl, "Mound-Builders, Mormons, and William Cullen Bryant", ''[[The New England Quarterly]]'', vol. 34, no. 2, June 1961, pp. 178–90 ("Undoubtedly the most famous and certainly the most influential of all Mound-Builder literature is the ''Book of Mormon'' (1830)).

==Organizational statements regarding the Book of Mormon==

===Smithsonian Institution===
During the early 1980s, rumors circulated in Mormon culture that the Book of Mormon was being used by the Smithsonian to guide primary archaeological research. These rumors were brought to the attention of Smithsonian directors who, by 1982, sent a [[form letter]] to inquiring parties stating that the Smithsonian did not use the Book of Mormon to guide any research, and included a list of specific reasons Smithsonian archaeologists considered the Book of Mormon historically unlikely. In 1998, the Smithsonian revised the form letter and stated that Book of Mormon had not been used by the Smithsonian in any form of archaeological research.<ref>{{citation <!--|url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=7&num=1&id=176--> |title= New Light: Smithsonian Statement on the Book of Mormon Revised |journal= [[Journal of Book of Mormon Studies]] |volume= 7 |issue= 1 |page= 77 |place= Provo, Utah |publisher= [[Maxwell Institute]] |year= 1998 |url= http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1397&index=14 |accessdate= 2014-12-15}}</ref> Mormon scholars speculated that this was because the earlier version of the letter contradicts some aspects of research published by Smithsonian staff members. Non-Mormon scholars note that the Smithsonian has not retracted any of its previous statements and feel that the response was toned down to avoid negative public relations with Mormons. [[Terryl Givens]] speculates that the change in the statement was an effort to avoid controversy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Givens|2002|p=132}}</ref>

===National Geographic Society===
The [[Institute for Religious Research]] posted on their website a 1998 letter from [[National Geographic Society]] that stated that they were unaware of any archaeological evidence that would support the Book of Mormon.<ref>[http://mit.irr.org/national-geographic-society-statement-on-book-of-mormon "National Geographic Society Statement on the Book of Mormon"].  August 12, 1998.

==Anachronisms and archaeological findings==
{{See also|Book of Mormon anachronisms}}
Critics of the Book of Mormon have argued that there are words and phrases in the book that are [[anachronistic]] with archaeological findings. These relate to artifacts, animal, plant, or technology that critics believe did not exist in the Americas during the Book of Mormon time period (before 2500 BC to about 400 AD). The list below summarizes a few of the anachronistic criticisms in the Book of Mormon, as well as perspectives and rebuttals by Mormon [[apologist]]s.

There are five incidences where horses are mentioned in the Book of Mormon, and are portrayed as being in the forest upon first arrival of the Nephites, "raise(d)," "fed," "prepared" (in conjunction with chariots), used for food, and being "useful unto man".<ref>1 Nephi 18:25, Enos 1:21, Alma 18:9,10,12, Alma 20:6, 3 Nephi 3:22, 3 Nephi 4:4, and Ether 9:19.</ref> Critics argue that horses were extinct in the Western Hemisphere over 10,000 years ago and did not reappear there until the Spaniards brought them from Europe. Horses were re-introduced to the Americas ([[Caribbean]]) by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1493 and to the American continent by [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]] in 1519.<ref>{{cite web| title=A brief history of the horse in America; Horse phylogeny and evolution | last = Singer | first=Ben | publisher=Canadian Geographic Magazine | url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/ma05/indepth/naturalhistory.asp | accessdate=2006-12-10 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029004405/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/ma05/indepth/naturalhistory.asp |archive-date = October 29, 2006}}</ref> Mormon archaeologist [[John L. Sorenson]] claims that there is fossil evidence that some New World horses may have survived the [[Pleistocene]]–[[Holocene]] transition,<ref>See references cited in John L. Sorenson, ''An Ancient American Setting for the Book of Mormon'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book Company, 1996), 295, n.63.</ref> though these findings are disputed by other Book of Mormon scholars.<ref>Peterson Daniel C. and Roper, Matthew "Ein Heldenleben?

Bennett suggests that the word "horse" in the Book of Mormon may have referred to a different animal, such as a [[tapir]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Robert R. |last=Bennett |url=http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1055&index=1 |title=Horses in the Book of Mormon |work=[[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies|FARMS]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111140522/http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1055&index=1 |archive-date=November 11, 2013 }}</ref>

[[Elephants]] are mentioned twice in the earliest Book of Mormon record, the [[Book of Ether]]. Critics argue that the archaeological record suggests that all elephant-like creatures became extinct in the New World around 10,000 BC. The source of this extinction is speculated to be the result of human predation, a significant climate change, or a combination of both factors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Diamond|1999}}</ref><ref>Sharon Levy, "Mammoth Mystery, Did Climate Changes Wipe Out North America's Giant Mammals, Or Did Our Stone Age Ancestors Hunt Them To Extinction?" Onearth, Winter 2006, pp15-19</ref> A small population of mammoths survived on [[St. Paul Island, Alaska]], up until 3700 BC,<ref>Kristine J. Crossen, "5,700-Year-Old Mammoth Remains from the Pribilof Islands, Alaska: Last Outpost of North America Megafauna", Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs, Volume 37, Number 7, (Geological Society of America, 2005), 463</ref>

Apologists deal with the "elephant" in much the same way as they treat the "horse" anachronism, countering with the following arguments:
*Various amateur archaeologists and Mormon authors have cited controversial evidence that North American [[mound builder (people)|mound builder]] cultures were familiar with the elephant. This evidence has long been a topic of debate with modern archaeologists concluding that the elephantine remains were improperly dated, misidentified, or openly fraudulent.<ref>In his 1903 ''The Mound Builders, Their Works and Relics'', minister Stephen Dennison Peet cites instances of exhumed mastodon remains and arguments given for why the remains were believed to be contemporary with [[mound builder (people)|mound builders]]. Stephen Dennison Peet, ''The Mound Builders'', pp. 38–44. Elephant effigy pipes, of the characteristic mound builder platform style, were reported as archaeological finds in Iowa, Stephen Dennison Peet, ''The Mound Builders'', pp. 11–14. see also M.C. Read's 1896, ''Archaeology of Ohio'', pp 116–17 and a mound in Wisconsin has been called the "elephant mound," though archaeologists question whether this is in fact the animal represented. On Elephant platform pipes and the Elephant Mound of Grand County, Wisconsin, see Charles E. Putnam (President of the Davenport Academy of Natural Sciences), ''Elephant Pipes and Inscribed Tablets in the Museum of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Davenport, Iowa'', 1885, pp. 19–20, and U.S. Ethnology Bureau, Vol. 2., 1880–81,Pg. 153; see also Charles Valentine Riley, ''The American Naturalist'', American Society of Naturalists (Essex Institute), pp. 275–77. The former Iowa state archaeologist Marshall McKusick discusses the evidence indicating that the elephant platform pipes are frauds in his book on the so-called [[Davenport Tablets]].

===Cattle and cows===

[[File:Llama, peru, machu picchu.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Llamas are the only large mammal other than alpacas known to have been domesticated in the Americas.]]
There are five separate incidences of "cows" or "cattle" in the New World in the Book of Mormon, including verbiage that they were "raise(d)" and were "for the use of man" or "useful for the food of man,"<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=Enos|chapter=1|verse=21}}, {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=1 Nephi|chapter=18|verse=25}}, {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=Ether|chapter=9|verse=18}}</ref> and indicates that "cattle" and "cows" were not considered the same animal.<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|version=1981|book=Ether|chapter=9|verse=18}}</ref> While the Book of Mormon may follow the common biblical precedent of referring to all domesticated animals as "cattle", there is no evidence that Old World cattle (members of the genus ''[[Bos]]'') inhabited the New World prior to European contact in the 16th century AD.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 3498335 | pmid=23155451 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0049066 | volume=7 | issue=11 | title=Genetic footprints of Iberian cattle in America 500 years after the arrival of Columbus | journal=PLOS ONE | pages=e49066 | last1 = Martínez | first1 = AM | last2 = Gama | first2 = LT | last3 = Cañón | first3 = J |display-authors=et al |year=2012 | bibcode=2012PLoSO...749066M }}</ref> Further, there is currently no archaeological evidence of American bison having been domesticated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Diamond|1999|pp=165, 167–68}}</ref> It is widely accepted that the only large mammals to be domesticated in the Americas were the [[llama]] and the [[alpaca]] and that no species of goats, deer, or sheep were fully domesticated before the arrival of the Europeans to the continent.

Some Mormon apologists believe that the term "cattle," as used in the Book of Mormon is more general and does not exclusively mean members of the genus ''[[Bos]]''. Thus, they claim the term "cattle" may refer to [[mountain goat]]s; [[llama]]s; or the ancestor of the [[American bison]], ''[[Bison antiquus]]'' (of the sub family [[Bovinae]]).<ref>See, for example, {{cite web|title= Plants and Animals in the Book of Mormon: Possible Solutions to Apparent Problems |url= http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_BMProb2.shtml|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref>

===Sheep===

"Sheep" are mentioned in the Book of Mormon metaphorically at various places in the Nephite record<ref>Mosiah 14:5-7, Mosiah 15:6, Mosiah 26:20-21, Alma 5:37-39, 59-60, Alma 25:12, Helaman 15:13, 3 Nephi 14:15, 3 Nephi 15:17, 21, 24, 3 Nephi 16:1, 3, 3 Nephi 18:31, 3 Nephi 20:16, 3 Nephi 21:12</ref> but are conspicuously absent in the list of animals observed in the New World upon the arrival of the Nephites.<ref>1 Nephi 18:25</ref> In one instance sheep are described as being possessed by the [[Jaredites]] in the Americas at approximately 2300 BC.<ref>Ether 9:18</ref> Another verse mentions "lamb-skin" worn by enemy armies of robbers about their loins (circa AD 21).<ref>{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=3 Nephi|chapter=4|verse=7}}</ref> However, domesticated sheep are known to have been first introduced to the Americas during the second voyage of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] in 1493.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Mormon apologists argue the following to deal with this anachronism:
*One apologist cites the discovery of some charred wool cloth in a grave during a dig in central Mexico in 1935.<ref>Sorenson, John L. ''An Ancient American Setting for the Book of Mormon''. Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1996. 296.</ref> However, the discovering archeologists noted their uncertainty in determining if the grave was pre-Spanish.<ref>Linne, Sigvald ''Mexican Highland Cultures: Archaeological Researches at Teotihuacan, Calpoulalpan and Chalchicomula in 1934-35''. University Alabama Press, 2006. 116.</ref>
*Some suggest that the word "sheep" may refer to another species of animal that resembled sheep such as [[big horn sheep]] or llamas.<ref>{{cite web|title= Plants and Animals in the Book of Mormon: Possible Solutions to Apparent Problems |url= http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_BMProb2.shtml|accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref> Critics point out that big horn sheep have never been domesticated by humans.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
*The sheep referred to by the Jaredites, as the reference is not long after their arrival around 2500 BC, is referring to Old World sheep as it is mentioned in the Book of Mormon that the Jaredites brought animals and birds with them,<ref>Ether 6:4</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Roper |first1=Matthew |last2=Miller |first2=Wade E. |title=Animals in the Book of Mormon: Challenges and Perspectives |journal=BYU Studies |date=2017 |volume=56:4 |pages=133–175 |url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/animals-book-mormon-challenges-and-perspectives |accessdate=24 September 2019}}</ref> and the reference to lamb-skins may refer to wild sheep that were hunted.

===Goats===

[[File:Mazama americana.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Brocket deer: Some Mormon apologists believe that "goat" in the Book of Mormon refers to brocket deer in order to explain the apparent anachronism.]]"Goats" are mentioned three times in the Book of Mormon<ref>1 Ne. 18: 25, Enos 1: 21, Ether 9: 18.</ref> placing them among the Nephites and the Jaredites (i.e., between 2500 BC and 400 AD). In two of the verses, "goats" are distinguished from "wild goats", indicating that there were at least two varieties, one of them possibly domesticated.

Domesticated goats are known to have been introduced on the American continent by Europeans in the 15th century,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} 1000 years after the conclusion of the Book of Mormon, and nearly 2000 years after goats are last mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The aggressive [[mountain goat]] is indigenous to North America. There is no evidence that it was ever domesticated.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Mormon apologists argue the following to deal with this anachronism:
*Apologist Matthew Roper points out that 16th-century Spanish friars used the word "goat" to refer to native Mesoamerican [[brocket deer]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Matthew Roper |url=http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1324&index=2 |title=Deer as "Goat" and Pre-Columbian Domesticate |journal=[[Insights (FARMS)|Insights]] |volume=26 |issue=6 |date=2006 |accessdate=2014-12-15}}</ref> There is no evidence that brocket deer were ever domesticated.

===Swine===
[[File:Collared peccary02 - melbourne zoo.jpg|thumb|A [[collared peccary]]]]

"Swine" are referred to twice in the Book of Mormon,<ref>{{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|14|6}}</ref><ref name=eth917>{{lds|Ether|ether|9|17|18}}</ref> and states that the swine were "useful for the food of man" among the [[Jaredite]]s.<ref name=eth917 /> There have not been any remains, references, artwork, tools, or any other evidence suggesting that swine were ever present in the pre-Columbian New World.<ref>John J. Mayer and I Lehr Brisbin, Jr.  ''Wild Pigs in the United States: Their History, Comparative Morphology, and Current Status'' (1991, University of Georgia Press).</ref>

Apologists note that [[Peccary|peccaries]] (also known as javelinas), which bear a superficial resemblance to pigs and are in the same subfamily [[Suinae]] as swine, have been present in South America since prehistoric times.<ref>Gongora, J., and C.

[[File:Wheat close-up.JPG|thumb|300px|Wheat was domesticated in the Old World and was introduced on the American continent by Europeans.]]"Barley" is mentioned three times and "wheat" once in the Book of Mormon narrative with the ground being "tilled" to plant barley and wheat at one geographical location, in the 1st and 2nd century BC according to Book of Mormon chronology.<ref>See Alma 11: 7, 15; Mosiah 7: 22; Mosiah 9: 9.</ref> The introduction of domesticated modern barley and wheat to the New World was made by Europeans after 1492.<ref name=Price>John A.

[[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies|FARMS]] scholar Robert Bennett argues the following to deal with this anachronism:
*That the words "barley" and "wheat" in the Book of Mormon may actually be referring to other crops in the Americas, such as ''[[Hordeum pusillum]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal| author =Robert R. Bennett | title =Barley and Wheat in the Book Mormon | year =2000 | journal =Featured Papers| url =http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1052&index=1| accessdate =2014-12-15}}</ref><ref>Bennett cites, Nancy B.

*That these words may refer to genuine varieties of New World barley and wheat, which are as yet undiscovered in the archaeological record.
*That the Norse, after reaching North America, claimed to have found what they called "self-sown wheat".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fossum, Andrew.

Bennett states:
<blockquote>
Research on this matter supports two possible explanations. First, the terms barley and wheat, as used in the Book of Mormon, may refer to certain other New World crop plants that were given Old World designations; and second, the terms may refer to genuine varieties of New World barley and wheat. For example, the Spanish called the fruit of the prickly pear cactus a "fig," and emigrants from England called maize "corn," an English term referring to grains in general. A similar practice may have been employed when Book of Mormon people encountered New World plant species for the first time.<ref>Barley and Wheat in the Book Mormon, Robert R. Bennett Provo, Utah: Maxwell Institute.[http://farms.byu.edu/publications/transcripts/?id=126] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918075436/http://farms.byu.edu/publications/transcripts/?id=126 |date=2008-09-18 }}</ref></blockquote>

Bennett describes the use of ''[[Hordeum pusillum]]'', also known as "little barley," a species of grass native to the Americas. The seeds are edible, and this plant was part of the pre-Columbian [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]] of cultivated plants used by Native Americans. ''Hordeum pusillum'' was unknown in Mesoamerica, where there is no evidence of pre-Columbian barley cultivation.

===Silk===

The Book of Mormon mentions the use of "silk" in the New World four times.<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/1?lang=eng Alma 1:29], [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/4?lang=eng Alma 4:6], [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng Ether 9:17], [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/10?lang=eng Ether 10:24].</ref> "Silk" ordinarily refers to material that is created from the cocoon of one of several Asian moths, predominantly ''[[Bombyx mori]]''; this type of silk was unknown in pre-Columbian America.

Mormon scholar [[John L. Sorenson]] documents several materials which were used in Mesoamerica to make fine cloth equivalent to silk, some of which the Spanish actually called "silk" upon their arrival, including the fiber (kapok) from the seed pods of the ceiba tree, the cocoons of wild moths, the fibers of silkgrass (''Achmea magdalenae''), the leaves of the wild pineapple plant, and the fine hair of the underbelly of rabbits.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sorenson |first1=John L. |title=Mormon's Codex |date=2013 |publisher=Deseret Book |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |pages=346–347}}</ref> He alleges that the inhabitants of Mexico used the fiber spun by a wild silkworm to create a fabric.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://publications.mi.byu.edu/transcript/a-new-evaluation-of-the-smithsonian-institution-statement-regarding-the-book-of-mormon/|title=A New Evaluation of the Smithsonian Institution "Statement regarding the Book of Mormon"|last=Sorenson|first=John L|date=March 1995|work=Neal A.

The [[Aztec Empire|Aztecs]] used a silk material taken from nests made by two indigenous insects, the moth ''[[Eucheira socialis]]'' and the butterfly [[Eutachyptera|''Gloveria'' ''psidii'']].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Latin American insects and entomology|url=https://archive.org/details/latinamericanins00hogu|url-access=limited|last=Hogue|first=Charles Leonard|date=1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520078499|location=Berkeley|pages=[https://archive.org/details/latinamericanins00hogu/page/n175 328]|oclc=25164105|author-link=Charles L.

===Old World artifacts and products===

====Chariots or wheeled vehicles====
[[File:Standard of Ur chariots.jpg|500px|thumb|right|Chariots depicted in a Mesopotamian relief circa 2500 B.C. Evidence of wheeled vehicles has not been found in the Americas.]]
The Book of Mormon contains two accounts of "chariots" being used in the New World.<ref>{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=18|verse=9|range=-10,12}}, {{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=20|verse=6}}, {{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=3 Nephi|chapter=3|verse=22}}</ref>

Critics argue that there is no archaeological evidence to support the use of [[wheeled]] vehicles in Mesoamerica, especially since many parts of ancient Mesoamerica were not suitable for wheeled transport. [[Clark Wissler]], the Curator of Ethnography at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City, noted: "we see that the prevailing mode of land transport in the New World was by human carrier. The wheel was unknown in pre-Columbian times."<ref>Wissler, Clark. ''The American Indian'', pp. 32–39, as quoted in {{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=99}}</ref>

A comparison of the South American [[Inca]] civilization to Mesoamerican civilizations shows the same lack of wheeled vehicles. Although the Incas used a [[Inca road system|vast network of paved roads]], these roads are so rough, steep, and narrow that they appear to be unsuitable for wheeled use. Bridges that the Inca people built, and even continue to use and maintain today in some remote areas, are straw-rope bridges so narrow (about 2–3 feet wide) that no wheeled vehicle can fit. Inca roads were used mainly by [[chaski]] message runners and llama caravans.

Some Mormon apologists argue the following to deal with this anachronism:
*One apologist has suggested that the "chariots" mentioned in the Book of Mormon might refer to mythic or cultic wheeled vehicles.<ref>See [http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&id=68 Pre-Columbian Contact with the Americas across the Oceans: An Annotated Bibliography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306071511/http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&id=68 |date=2008-03-06 }}</ref>
*Some apologists point out that pre-Columbian wheeled toys have been found in Mesoamerica, indicating that the wheel was known by ancient American peoples.<ref>Miller, Robert Ryal, [https://archive.org/details/mexicohistory0000mill_z5e9 ''Mexico: A History''], University of Oklahoma Press, 1985</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last =Phillips| first =Charles|author2=Jones, David M| title =Aztec & Maya: Life in an Ancient Civilization| publisher =Hermes House| year= 2005| location =London| page =65}}</ref> Some of these wheeled toys were referred to by Smithsonian archaeologist [[William Henry Holmes]] and archaeologist [[Désiré Charnay]] as "chariots." <ref>{{cite book |last1=Charnay |first1=Désiré |title=The Ancient Cities of the New World, being Voyages and Explorations in Mexico and Central America from 1857–1882 |date=1888 |publisher=Harper and Brothers |location=New York, New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/ancientcitiesofn00char_0/page/171 171] |url=https://archive.org/details/ancientcitiesofn00char_0 |accessdate=24 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Holmes |first1=William Henry |title=Handbook of Aboriginal American Antiquities - Bulletin 60, Part 1 |date=1919 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |location=Washington, DC |page=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofaborig00holmrich/page/20 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofaborig00holmrich |accessdate=24 September 2019}}</ref>
*One Mormon apologist argues that few chariot fragments have been found in the Middle East dating to Biblical times (apart from the disassembled chariots found in [[KV62|Tutankhamun's tomb]]), and therefore wheeled chariots did exist in the Book of Mormon timeframe and it would not be unreasonable to assume that archaeologists have not yet discovered any evidence of them.<ref>Sorenson, p. 59</ref>
**Critics counter that although few fragments of chariots have been found in the Middle East, there are many images of ancient chariots on pottery and [[fresco]]es and in many sculptures of Mediterranean origin, thus confirming their existence in those societies. The absence of these images among pre-Columbian artwork found in the New World (with the exception of Pre-Columbian wheeled toys), they state, does not support the existence of Old World–style chariots in the New World.
*Mormon scholar [[Brant Gardner]] has asserted that the Book of Mormon "chariot' may be a palanquin or litter vehicle,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gardner |first1=Brant |title=Traditions of the Fathers: The Book of Mormon As History |date=2015 |publisher=Greg Kofford Books |location=Sandy, Utah |isbn=978-1589586659 |pages=295–297}}</ref> and apologist Michael Ash generally speculates that the word "chariot" may refer to a non-wheeled vehicle.<ref>{{citation |last= Ash |first= Michael R. |author-link= Michael R.

====Iron and steel====
[[File:Florentine Codex IX Aztec Warriors.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Aztec warriors brandishing [[maquahuitl]], which are made of stone. From the 16th-century [[Florentine Codex]], Vol. IX.]]
"Steel" and "iron" are mentioned several times in the Book of Mormon.<ref>See {{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=16|verse=18}}, {{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=2 Nephi|chapter=5|verse=15}}, {{Sourcetext|source=Book of that iron was hardened anciently to the consistency of "steel" in Mormon|book=Jarom|chapter=1|verse=8}}, {{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=7|verse=9}}</ref> Ancient mound-building cultures of North America are known to have mined and worked native copper, silver, gold, and meteoric iron, although evidence of iron being hardened to make steel in ancient times has not been found in the Americas.

Between 2004 and 2007, a [[Purdue University]] archaeologist, Kevin J. Vaughn, discovered a 2000-year-old [[hematite]] mine near [[Nazca]], Peru. Although hematite is today mined as an iron ore, Vaughn believes that the hematite was then being mined for use as red pigment. There are also numerous excavations that included iron minerals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/NWAF&CISOPTR=3909&REC=14 |title=Mound 27 and the Middle Preclassic Period at Mirador, Chiapas, Mexico |author=Pierre Agrinier |series=Papers of the New World Archaeological Foundation |number=58 |publisher=[[New World Archaeological Foundation]] |location=Provo, Utah |year=2000 |accessdate=2014-12-15}}</ref> He noted:

<blockquote>Even though ancient Andean people smelted some metals, such as copper, they never smelted iron like they did in the Old World .... Metals were used for a variety of tools in the Old World, such as weapons, while in the Americas, metals were used as prestige goods for the wealthy elite.<ref name="sciencedaily.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/01/080129125405.htm |title=Archaeologist 'Strikes Gold' With Finds Of Ancient Nasca Iron Ore Mine In Peru |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2008-02-03 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref></blockquote>

Apologists counter that the word "steel" in the Book of Mormon likely refers to a hardened metal other than iron. This argument follows from the fact that the Book of Mormon refers to certain Old World articles made of "steel".<ref>{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=4|verse=9}}; {{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=16|verse=18}}</ref> Similar "steel" articles mentioned in the [[King James Version of the Bible]] (KJV) are actually hardened copper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/22.35?lang=eng |title=2 Samuel 22:35 |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}</ref> It has been demonstrated that much of the terminology of the Book of Mormon parallels the language of the KJV.<ref>http://www.fairlds.org/Book_of_Mormon/Steel_in_the_Book_of_Mormon.html article by [[William Hamblin]] on steel in the Book of Mormon</ref> Ancient mound-building cultures of North America are known to have mined and worked [[native copper]], silver, gold, and meteoric iron, although few instances of metallic blades or of deliberately alloyed (or "hardened") copper have been uncovered from ancient North America.<ref>''Mound Builders & Cliff Dwellers'', Lost Civilizations series, edited by Dale M.

====Metal swords, which had "rusted"====
The Book of Mormon makes numerous references to "swords" and their use in battle.<ref>{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=2 Nephi|chapter=5|verse=14}}</ref> When the remnants of the Jaredites' final battle were discovered, the Book of Mormon narrative states that some swords were collected and "the hilts thereof have perished, and the blades thereof were cankered with rust."<ref>{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=8|verse=11}}</ref>

Apologists argue that most references to swords do not speak of the material they were made of, and that they may refer to a number of weapons such as the [[macuahuitl]], a "sword" made of [[obsidian]] blades that was used by the Aztecs. It was very sharp and could decapitate a man or horse.<ref>{{Cite journal| last =Roper| first =Matthew| title =Swords and "Cimeters" in the Book of Mormon | journal =Journal of Book of Mormon Studies| volume =8| issue =1| pages =34–43| year= 1999| url =http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1396&index=7| accessdate =2014-12-15}}"Spaniards who faced native Mesoamerican swords in battle were deeply impressed by their deadly cutting power and razorlike sharpness."</ref>

====Cimeters====
"Cimeters" are mentioned in eight instances in the Book of Mormon stretching from approximately 500 BC to 51 BC.<ref>Enos 1:20, Mosiah 9:16, Mosiah 10:8, Alma 2:12, Alma 27:29, Alma 43:18, 20, 37, Alma 44:8, Alma 60:2, Helaman 1:14</ref> Critics argue this existed hundreds of years before the term "scimitar" was coined. The word "cimiter" is considered an anachronism since the word was never used by the Hebrews (from which the Book of Mormon peoples came) or any other civilization prior to 450 AD.<ref>[[B. H. Roberts]] noted: "The word <nowiki>[cimiter]</nowiki> is of oriental and uncertain origin and appears in various forms. How it came to be introduced into the speech and writings of the Nephites, and how not used in the other Hebrew literature at an earlier date, is so far as I know, unaccountable. The earliest use of the word I have found is in Gibbon, where referring to the alleged incident of finding the sword of Mars for Attila, he there calls that sword of Mars 'cimiter'; but that was about 450 A.D." - {{Harvnb|Roberts|1992|pp=112}}</ref> The word 'cimeterre' is found in the 1661 English dictionary Glossographia and is defined as "a crooked sword" and was part of the English language at the time that the Book of Mormon was translated.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blount |first1=Thomas |title=Glossographia, or, A dictionary interpreting all such hard words of whatsoever language now used in our refined English tongue with etymologies, definitions and historical observations on the same : also the terms of divinity, law, physick, mathematicks and other arts and sciences explicated |date=1661 |publisher=Tho.

Apologists Michael R. Ash and [[William Hamblin]] postulate that the word was chosen by Joseph Smith as the closest workable English word for a short curved weapon used by the Nephites.<ref>Ash states: "there is enough Mesoamerican artwork and artifacts that display the basic characteristics of a scimitar that the Book of Mormon is vindicated for its usage." See: http://www.fairlds.org/FAIR_Brochures/Anachronisms3.pdf</ref>
Mormon scholar Matthew Roper has noted there are a variety of weapons with curved blades found in Mesoamerica.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Roper |first1=Matthew |title=Swords and Cimeters in the Book of Mormon |journal=Journal of Book of Mormon Studies |date=1999 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=34–43, 77–78 |url=https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1205&context=jbms |accessdate=24 September 2019}}</ref>

====System of exchange based on measures of grain using precious metals as a standard====
The Book of Mormon details a [[Book of Mormon weights and measures|system of measures]] used by the societies described therein.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.6,13,22,25?lang=eng |title=Alma 11 |publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}</ref> However, the overall use of metal in ancient America seems to have been extremely limited. A more common exchange medium in Mesoamerica were [[cacao bean]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Coe|2002|p=132}} "[W]ell into Colonial times the beans served as a form of money in regional markets."</ref>

===Knowledge of Hebrew and Egyptian languages===
{{See also|Linguistics and the Book of Mormon}}
[[File:Caractors large.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The "[[Anthon Transcript|Caractors document]]", which shows characters transcribed from the [[golden plates]] (the source of the Book of Mormon). These characters are claimed to be from an unknown language called [[reformed Egyptian]].]] The Book of Mormon describes more than one literate people inhabiting ancient America. The Nephite people are described as possessing a language and writing with roots in [[Hebrew]] and [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], and writing part of the original text of the Book of Mormon in this unknown language, called [[reformed Egyptian]]. A transcript of some of the characters of this language has been preserved in what had previously been erroneously identified as the "[[Anthon Transcript]]" but is now known as the "Caractors document."

Fifteen examples of distinct [[Mesoamerican writing systems|scripts]] have been identified in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, many from a single inscription.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Macri |first1=Martha J. |title="Maya and Other Mesoamerican Scripts," in The World's Writing Systems |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford |location=England |pages=172–182}}</ref> While Maya contains cartouches and is a form of hieroglyphic script like Egyptian, no further resemblance to Hebrew or Egyptian hieroglyphs has been identified. Additionally, professional linguists and Egyptologists do not consider the [[Anthon Transcript|Caractors document]] to contain any legitimate ancient writing. Edward H. Ashment called the characters of the transcript "hieroglyphics of the Micmac Indians of northeastern North America".<ref>{{cite journal | author=Edward H. Ashment | title=The Book of Mormon and the Anthon Transcript: An Interim Report | journal=[[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone]] | date= May–June 1980 | page=30 | issue=21 | url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/issue-details/?in=21 | accessdate=2014-12-15}}</ref>

The Smithsonian Institution has noted, "Reports of findings of ancient Egyptian Hebrew, and other Old World writings in the New World in pre-Columbian contexts have frequently appeared in newspapers, magazines, and sensational books. None of these claims has stood up to examination by reputable scholars. No inscriptions using Old World forms of writing have been shown to have occurred in any part of the Americas before 1492 except for a few Norse rune stones which have been found in Greenland."<ref name="irr.org/smith">{{citation | title=Statement Regarding the Book of Mormon | year=1996 | publisher=Department of Anthropology, Smithsonian Institution | url=http://mit.irr.org/smithsonian-institution-statement-on-book-of-mormon | accessdate=2014-12-15}} (hosted on the [[Institute for Religious Research]] website)</ref>

Linguistic studies on the evolution of the spoken languages of the Americas agree with the widely held model that ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' arrived in America between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. According to the Book of Mormon, additional immigrants arrived on the American continent about 2500 BC and about 600 BC.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

===Systems of measuring time (calendars)===
Chronologic dates given in the Nephite portion of the Book of Mormon are stated in terms of the Nephite calendar. The Jaredite abridgment does not contain an apparent calendar, the length of reigns and ages of kings are indicated in years, but no connection beyond that to a continuous calendar is indicated. The system of dates used by the Lamanites is not stated, though the Book of Mormon indicates that Lamanites had a different system of counting hours.<ref>{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=18|verse=14}}</ref> The highest numbered month mentioned in the Book of Mormon is the eleventh, and the highest numbered day is the twelfth, but the total number of months in a year and the number of days in a month is not explicitly stated.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Sorenson| first =John L| editor-last =Thorne|editor-first = Melvin J.| title =Seasons of War, Seasons of Peace| journal =Rediscovering the Book of Mormon| page =250| publisher =Deseret Book Company and FARMS| year= 1991| isbn =978-0-87579-387-0}}</ref> Even so, it appears that Book of Mormon peoples observed lunar cycles, "months",<ref>{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Omni|chapter=1|verse=21}}</ref> and that the Nephites observed the Israelite Sabbath at the end of a seven-day week.<ref>{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Jarom|chapter=1|verse=5}}, {{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=13|verse=16–19}}</ref>

Most North American tribes relied upon a calendar of 13 months, relating to the annual number of lunar cycles. Seasonal rounds and ceremonies were performed each moon. Months were counted in the days between phase cycles of the moon. Calendar systems in use in North America during this historical period relied on this simple system.<ref>13 Moons On the Turtles Back. A Native American Year of Moons'', {{ISBN|0-698-11584-8}}, Putnam and Grossnet Group, 199</ref>

One of the more distinctive features shared among pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations is the use of an extensive [[Mesoamerican calendars|system of inter-related calendars]]. The [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] and archaeological record for this practice dates back at least 2,500 years, by which time it appears to have been well-established.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Marcus, Joyce |title=First Dates: The Maya calendar and writing system were not the only ones in Mesoamerica&mdash;or even the earliest |journal=Natural History |url=http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/ant/MARCUS01.ANT |year=1991 |volume=April |pages=22–25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909175226/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/ant/MARCUS01.ANT |archive-date=September 9, 2005 }}</ref> The most widespread and significant of these calendars was the 260-day calendar, formed by combining 20 named days with 13 numerals in successive sequence (13 × 20 = 260).<ref>{{Harvnb|Coe|2002|p=59}}</ref> Another system of perhaps equal antiquity is the 365-day calendar, approximating the [[solar year]], formed from 18 "months" × 20 named days + 5 additional days.

==Latter-day Saints and Book of Mormon archaeology==

===Early activities===
In the early 1840s, [[John Lloyd Stephens]]' two-volume work ''Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan'' was seen by some church members as an essential guide to the ruins of Book of Mormon cities. In the fall of 1842, an article appearing in the church's ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' alleged that the ruins of [[Quiriguá]], discovered by Stephens, may be the very ruins of [[Zarahemla]] or some other Book of Mormon city.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/TimesAndSeasonsVol3/Times_and_Seasons_Vol_3#page/n563/mode/1up "ZARAHEMLA"], ''[[Times and Seasons]]'', October 1, 1842, Volume 3, Number 23, p. 927.</ref> Other articles followed, including one published shortly after the death of [[Joseph Smith]]. Every Latter Day Saint was encouraged to read Stephens' book and to regard the stone ruins described in it as relating to the Book of Mormon.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/TimesAndSeasonsVol4/Times_and_Seasons_Vol_4#page/n522/mode/1up "STEPHENS' WORKS ON CENTRAL AMERICA"], ''[[Times and Seasons]]'', October 1, 1843, Volume 4, Number 22, p. 346; See also [https://archive.org/stream/TimesAndSeasonsVol6/Times_and_Seasons_Vol_6#page/n91/mode/1up ''Times and Seasons'', April 1, 1845, Volume 6, Number 6, pg 855]</ref> It is now believed that these Central American ruins date more recent than Book of Mormon times.<ref>Scholars date the ruins of Quirigua to about the 8th century AD. See [[Quirigua]]</ref>

In recent years, there have been differing views among Book of Mormon scholars, particularly between the scholars and the "hobbyists".<ref>{{Harvnb|Givens|2002|p=146}}</ref>

===New World Archaeological Foundation===
From the mid-1950s onwards, [[New World Archaeological Foundation]] (NWAF), based out of [[Brigham Young University]], has sponsored archaeological excavations in [[Mesoamerica]], with a focus on the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Mesoamerican time period]] known as the Preclassic (earlier than ''c.'' AD 200).<ref>[http://www.lib.byu.edu/spc/nwaf/ New World Archaeological Foundation], online collections at BYU.</ref> The results of these and other investigations, while producing valuable archaeological data, have not led to any widespread acceptance by non-Mormon archaeologists of the Book of Mormon account. In 1973, citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, [[Michael D. Coe]], a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, wrote,

<blockquote>As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing the historicity of the Book of Mormon, and I would like to state that there are quite a few Mormon archaeologists who join this group.<ref name="Coe 1973 41–46">{{Harvnb|Coe|1973|pp=41–46}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1955, [[Thomas Stuart Ferguson]], an attorney and the founder of the NWAF, received five years of funding from the LDS Church and the NWAF then began to dig throughout Mesoamerica for evidence of the veracity of the Book of Mormon claims. In a 1961 newsletter, Ferguson predicted that although nothing had been found, the Book of Mormon cities would be found within 10 years. The NWAF became part of BYU in 1961 and Ferguson was removed from the director position.

Eleven years after Ferguson was no longer affiliated with the NWAF, in 1972 Christian scholar Hal Hougey wrote Ferguson questioning the progress given the stated timetable in which the cities would be found.<ref name="Larson 1990 76">{{Harvnb|Larson|1990|pp=76}}</ref> Replying to Hougey, as well as other secular and non-secular requests, Ferguson wrote in a letter dated 5 June 1972: "Ten years have passed .... I had sincerely hoped that Book-of-Mormon cities would be positively identified within 10 years—and time has proved me wrong in my anticipation."<ref name="Larson 1990 76"/>

In 1976, fifteen years removed from any archaeological involvement with the NWAF, referring to his own paper, Ferguson wrote a letter in which he stated:

<blockquote>The real implication of the paper is that you can't set the Book-of-Mormon geography down anywhere—because it is fictional and will never meet the requirements of the dirt-archeology. I should say—what is in the ground will never conform to what is in the book."<ref>{{Harvnb|Larson|1990|pp=79}}</ref></blockquote>

Archaeological efforts have failed to garner complete support from all prominent Mormon scholars. Author and Mormon Professor of Biblical and Mormon scripture [[Hugh Nibley]] published the following critical remarks:

<blockquote>Book of Mormon archaeologists have often been disappointed in the past because they have consistently looked for the wrong things .... Blinded by the gold of the pharaohs and the mighty ruins of Babylon, Book of Mormon students have declared themselves "not interested" in the drab and commonplace remains of our lowly Indians. But in all the Book of Mormon we look in vain for anything that promises majestic ruins.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nibley|1988|pp=431, 440–41}}</ref></blockquote>

Though the NWAF failed to establish Book of Mormon archaeology, the archaeological investigations of NWAF-sponsored projects were a success for ancient American archaeology in general which has been recognized and appreciated by non-Mormon archaeologists.<ref name="Coe 1973 41–46"/> Currently BYU maintains 86 documents on the work of the NWAF at the [http://www.lib.byu.edu/dlib/spc/nwaf/ BYU NWAF website]; these documents are used outside both BYU and the LDS Church by researchers.

===Modern approach and conclusions===
As noted above, there is a general consensus among archaeologists that the archaeological record does not substantiate the Book of Mormon account, and in most ways directly contradicts it.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OqkRc8uDHoC&pg=PA288|title=The Mormon Contradiction:: In Their Own Words|first=Marcia Van|last=Outen|date=11 July 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|via=Google Books|isbn=9781467893497}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Rapid body size decline in Alaskan Pleistocene horses before extinction|first=R.|last=Dale Guthrie|date=13 November 2003|journal=Nature|volume=426|issue=6963|pages=169–171|doi=10.1038/nature02098|pmid=14614503|bibcode=2003Natur.426..169D|s2cid=186242574}}</ref>

An example of the mainstream archaeological opinion of Mormon archaeology is summarized by historian and journalist [[Hampton Sides]]:

<blockquote>Yale's Michael Coe likes to talk about what he calls "the fallacy of misplaced concreteness," the tendency among Mormon theorists like Sorenson to keep the discussion trained on all sorts of extraneous subtopics ... while avoiding what is most obvious: that Joseph Smith probably meant "horse" when he wrote down the word "horse".<ref>Sides, Hampton, "This is Not the Place!", ''Double Take Magazine'', Vol. 5, No 2; Also included in his work ''American: Dispatches from the New Frontier'', 2004</ref></blockquote>

===Old World Mormon archaeology===
Some Mormon archaeologists and researchers have focused on the Arabian peninsula in the Middle East where they believe the Book of Mormon narrative describes actual locations. These alleged connections include the following:
*One Mormon apologist believes that an ancient tribe known to have existed on the Arabian Peninsula with a similar name to that of the Book of Mormon figure [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]] may have adopted his name.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hilton|Hilton|1996|pp=46, 75}}</ref> Other Mormon scholars have not reached this conclusion, as "far too little is yet known about early Arabia to strengthen a link with the historical Lehi, and other explanations are readily available for every point advanced."<ref>{{Harvnb|Aston|1997}}</ref>
*The Wadi Tayyib al-Ism is considered to be a plausible location for the Book of Mormon River of Laman by some Mormon researchers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Potter|1999}}</ref> This is disputed by other Mormon researchers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chadwick|2005|pp=197–215}}</ref>
*Some Mormon apologists believe that the Book of Mormon place name "[[Nahom]]" correlates to a location in Yemen referred to as "NHM".<ref>See, for example, the documentary ''Journey of Faith'' produced by the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]]; see also [[S. Kent Brown]], "New Light from Arabia on Lehi's Trail," in ''Evidences and Echoes of the Book of Mormon'', ed. [[Donald W. Parry]], [[Daniel C. Peterson]], and [[John W.

*One Mormon apologist believes that an ancient Judean artifact is connected with the Book of Mormon figure [[Mulek]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Chadwick|2003|pp=72–83}}</ref>
*Several Mormon apologists have proposed a variety of locations on the Arabian Peninsula that they believe could be the Book of Mormon location "Shazer".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hilton|Hilton|1996|p=33}}, {{Harvnb|Potter|Wellington|2004}}</ref>

===New World Mormon archaeology===
{{See also|Proposed Book of Mormon geographical setting}}
Archaeological studies in the New World that tie Book of Mormon places and peoples to real world locations and civilizations are incredibly difficult since there are generally no landmarks defined in the Book of Mormon that can unambiguously identify real world locations. Generally non-Mormon archaeologists do not consider there to be any authentic Book of Mormon archaeological sites. Various apologists have claimed that events in the Book of Mormon took place in a variety of locations<ref>One book compiled by prominent Mormon scholar John Sorenson has more than 400 pages of possible location theories placing Book of Mormon events everywhere from the Finger Lakes region of the Northeast United States to Chile.

Olsen, [https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/131%2030-34.pdf "A Malay Site for Book of Mormon Events"], ''[[Sunstone (magazine)|Sunstone]]'' (131), March 2004, 30.</ref> These finds are divided into competing models, most notably the Hemispheric Geography Model, the Mesoamerican Limited Geography Model, and the Finger Lakes Limited Geography Model.

====Hemispheric Geography Model====
The Hemispheric Geography Model posits that the events of the Book of Mormon took place over the entirety of the North and South American continents. By corollary many Mormons believe that the three groups mentioned in the Book of Mormon (Jaredites, Nephites, and Lamanites) exclusively populated an empty North and South American Continent, and that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] were all of Israeli descent.

Speculations from various church leaders has shifted slightly over time, with early Mormon leaders including Orson Pratt taking a traditional stance.<ref>This view was incorporated by [[Orson Pratt]] into his footnotes for the 1879 edition of the Book of Mormon.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} (These geographical footnotes were later removed in 1920 and all subsequent editions).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}</ref><ref>Silverberg quotes early Mormon Apostle [[Orson Pratt]] who attempted to incorporate "ancient mounds filled with human bones" in a geographic model spanning "North and South America."

Williams]], one of Joseph Smith's counsellors and scribes, asserts that Lehi's people landed in South America at thirty degrees south latitude. U.A.S. Newsletter (Provo, Utah: University Archaeological Society at Brigham Young University) January 30, 1963, p. 7. An official statement by the LDS Church discourages Church members from making too much of the Williams document. Frederick J. Pack (Chairman of the Gospel Doctrine Committee of the Church) and George D. Pyper, ''The Instructor'' 73, No. 4, 1938, pg 160.</ref><ref>[[Orson Pratt]] also speculated that the Nephite landing site was on the coast of Chile near [[Valparaiso]], Orson Pratt, Journal of Discourses (London, England: Albert Carrington, 1869), vol. 12; p. 342; Volume 14, p. 325, 1872.</ref> This model was also implicitly endorsed in the introduction to the Book of Mormon which, before 2008, stated that [[Lamanites]] are the "principal ancestors of the American Indians."<ref>Introduction to the Book of Mormon, prior to 2008. See for instance 1979 edition.</ref> More recently, the church has not taken as strong position on the absolute origin of Native American peoples.<ref>A 1938 church study guide asserted that "all the Book of Mormon text requires" is a "Hebrew origin for at least a part of Indian ancestry". {{Harvnb|Berrett|Hunter|1938}}</ref>

Some Mormon apologists note that on June 4, 1834, during the [[Zion's Camp]] trek through Illinois, Joseph Smith stated that the group was "wandering over the plains of the Nephites, recounting occasionally the history of the Book of Mormon, roving over the mounds of that once beloved people of the Lord, picking up their skulls & their bones, as proof of its divine authenticity".<ref>{{Harvnb|Jessee|1984|p=324}} (See also [[Zelph]])</ref>

=====Criticism of the Hemispheric Model=====
Critics have noted that the assumption that Lamanites are the ancestors of the American Indians are wholly unfounded in current archaeological and genetic research.<ref>{{Harvnb|Southerton|2004|p=42}} "For many Mormons, this is as deep as their awareness of the origin of Native Americans extends. They remain oblivious to the large volume of research that has revealed continuous, widespread human occupation of the Americas for the last 14,000 years. Such research conflicts with erroneous LDS interpretations and oral traditions and unfortunately has, until recently, been ignored."</ref>

====Mesoamerican Limited Geography Model====
{{Main|Limited Geography Model (Book of Mormon)}}
The Mesoamerican [[Limited Geography Model (Book of Mormon)|Limited Geography Model]] posits that the events of the Book of Mormon occurred in a geographically "limited" region in Mesoamerica only hundreds of miles in dimension and that other people were present in the New World at the time of Lehi's arrival. This model has been proposed and advocated by various Mormon apologists in the 20th century (both [[Community of Christ|RLDS]] and [[Latter Day Saint|LDS]]).<ref>See {{Harvnb|Hills|1917}}, {{Harvnb|Smith|1997}}, {{Harvnb|Berrett|Hunter|1938|pg=48}}, {{Harvnb|Sorenson|1985}}, {{Harvnb|Roper|2004}}, {{Harvnb|Nibley|1980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last =Sjodahl| first =Janne M| title =An Introduction to the Study of the Book of Mormon| work =Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press| year= 1927}}</ref><ref>"Limited Geography and the Book of Mormon: Historical Antecedents and Early Interpretations", by Matthew Roper, section on the geographic ideas of John E. Page, BYU Maxwell Institute, 2004.</ref> Geographically limited settings for the Book of Mormon have been suggested by LDS church leaders as well,<ref name="Roper 2004">{{Harvnb|Roper|2004}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Sorenson|1985|pp=1–48}}</ref> and this view has been published in the official church magazine, [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|''Ensign'']].<ref>{{Harvnb|Sorenson|1984}}</ref>

Mormon apologists believe the following archaeological evidence supports the Mesoamerican Geography Model:
*Some Mormon apologists argue that there is only a single plausible match with the geography in Mesoamerica centered around the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] (current day [[Guatemala]], the southern Mexico States of [[Tabasco]], [[Chiapas]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Veracruz]], and the surrounding area).<ref>{{Harvnb|Sorenson|1985|pp=35–36}}</ref> This region was first proposed as the location of Zarahemla (ruins of Quirigua) in the anonymous newspaper article of October 1, 1842 (''Times and Seasons'').
*Mormon apologist John L. Sorenson cites discoveries of fortifications at Becán, Tlaxcala, Puebla, Teotihuacan, and Kaminaljuyu, dated between 100 and 300 AD, as evidence of the Book of Mormon's account of large-scale warfare.<ref>{{Cite journal| last =Sorenson| first =John L| title =Last-Ditch Warfare in Ancient Mesoamerica Recalls the Book of Mormon | journal =Journal of Book of Mormon Studies| volume =9| issue =2| pages =44–53| year= 2000| url =http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=jbms&id=227| accessdate = 29 Dec 2014 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061208055454/http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=jbms&id=227| archive-date= 8 December 2006 | url-status= live}}</ref>
*Some apologists, and church leaders (including Joseph Smith) believe that the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] ruins on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] belonged to Book of Mormon peoples<ref>The ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' proclaims the ruins were likely Nephite or belonging to "the ancient inhabitants of America treated of in the Book of Mormon". [http://www.meridianmagazine.com/ideas/030930joseph.html "Did the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1842 Locate Book of Mormon Lands in Middle America?"], by V. Garth Norman - ''History of the Church'' Volume 5, pg 44.</ref> LDS efforts to relate anachronistic Mayan ruins to Book of Mormon cities, owes much of its origins to an infatuation with archaeologists Stephens' and Catherwood's discoveries of Mesoamerican ruins, made public more than a decade after the first publication of the Book of Mormon.<ref>Stephens, John Lloyd, ''Incident of Travel In Central America'', Vol. II, pp. 442-443</ref> These findings were cited by early church leaders and publications as confirming evidence.<ref>Roberts, Jennifer, ''The Art Bulletin'', "Landscapes of Indifference; Robert Smithson and John Lloyd Stephens in Yucatan", September 1, 2000.</ref> This correlation is clearly problematic however, since conventional archaeology places the pinnacle of Mayan civilization several centuries after the final events in the Book of Mormon supposedly occurred.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  Critics note that according to {{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mormon|chapter=6|verse=5}}, Nephite civilization came to an end near the year 384 AD.  [[Copan]], [[Quirigua]], and sites in the Yucatàn visited by Stephens and Catherwood, contain artifacts that date more recent than Book of Mormon times. It has not been shown that any of Stephens' artifacts date to Book of Mormon times.

=====Criticism of the Mesoamerican Geography Model=====
*The Limited Mesoamerican Geography Model has been critiqued by a number of scholars, who suggest that it is not an adequate explanation for Book of Mormon geography and that the locations, events, flora and fauna described in it do not precisely match.<ref>{{Cite journal |last= Wunderli |first= Earl M |journal= [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]] |title= Critique of a Limited Geography for Book of Mormon Events |volume= 35 |issue= 3 |pages= 161–197 |url= https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V35N03_169.pdf |date= Fall 2002 |accessdate= 2014-12-15 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last= Matheny |first= Deanne G |editor-last= Metcalfe|editor-first = Brent Lee|journal= New Approaches to the Book of Mormon: Explorations in Critical Methodology |title= Does the Shoe Fit?

*Among apologists, there have been critiques—particularly around the location of the [[Hill Cumorah]], which most Mormons consider to be definitively identified as a location in New York. In a Mesoamerican Limited Geography model, this would require there to be two Cumorahs (which some consider preposterous<ref>Sides remarks, "As fantastic as it may seem, Sorenson actually argues that there were two Cumorahs: one in Mexico where the great battle took place, and where Moroni buried a longer, unexpurgated version of the golden Nephite records; and one near Palmyra, New York, where Moroni eventually buried a condensed version of the plates after lugging them on an epic trek of several thousand miles" (Sides, Hampton, "This is Not the Place!", ''Double Take Magazine'', Vol. 5, No 2; Also included in his work ''American: Dispatches from the New Frontier'', 2004)</ref>).

====Finger Lakes Limited Geography Model====
Some Mormon apologists hold that the events of the Book of Mormon occurred in a small region in and around the [[Finger Lakes]] region of New York. Part of the basis of this theory lies on statements made by Joseph Smith and other church leaders.<ref>See letter from Joseph Smith published in ''Times and Seasons'' October 1842, later canonized as the section 128 of the LDS Church's [[Doctrine and Covenants]]. In this letter, the Book of Mormon land [[Cumorah]] is referenced among other locations of significance near the Finger Lakes. See also [[Joseph Fielding Smith]]: Doctrines of Salvation, Volume 3, pp. 233-234; [[Bruce R. McConkie]]: [[Mormon Doctrine]]; s.v. "Cumorah", p. 175; [[Mark E.

I am not responsible for the publication, or arrangement of the former paper; the matter did not come under my supervision. JOSEPH SMITH.</ref>

Mormon apologists believe the archaeological evidence below supports claims that authentic Book of Mormon sites exist in the Finger Lakes region of New York:
*Mormon scholar [[Hugh Nibley]] drew attention to [[mound builder (people)|mound builder]] works of North America as "an excellent description of Book of Mormon strong places".<ref>{{Harvnb|Nibley|1988|pp=439}}, also Nibley, Hugh, ''The Prophetic Book of Mormon'', pp.272–73</ref>

====South American Limited Geography Model====
A document in the handwriting of [[Frederick G. Williams]], one of Joseph Smith's counselors and scribes, asserts that Lehi's people landed in South America at thirty degrees south latitude, which is Coquimbo Bay, Chile.  Analysis of the history and provenance of this document does not indicate it came from Joseph Smith and looks to just be an opinion from an unknown source.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Frederick G., III |title=Did Lehi Land in Chile? in Reexploring the Book of Mormon |date=1992 |publisher=Deseret Book |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |isbn=978-0875796000 |pages=57–61 |url=https://archive.bookofmormoncentral.org/content/did-lehi-land-chile |accessdate=22 November 2019}}</ref>

==Mormon cultural belief regarding Book of Mormon archaeology==

===Archaeological evidence of large populations===
Mormon scholars have estimated that at various periods in Book of Mormon history, the populations of civilizations discussed in the book ranged between 300,000 and 1.5 million people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=280}}</ref> The size of the late Jaredite civilization was even larger. According to the Book of Mormon, the final war that destroyed the Jaredites resulted in the deaths of at least two million people.<ref>{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Ether|chapter=15|verse=2}}</ref>

From Book of Mormon population estimates, it is evident that the civilizations described are comparable in size to the civilizations of [[ancient Egypt]], [[ancient Greece]], [[ancient Rome]], and the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. Such civilizations left numerous artifacts in the form of hewn stone ruins, tombs, temples, pyramids, roads, arches, walls, frescos, statues, vases, and coins. The archaeological problem posed by the earth-, timber-, and metal-working societies described in the Book of Mormon was summarized by [[Hugh Nibley]], a prominent BYU professor:

<blockquote>We should not be surprised at the lack of ruins in America in general. Actually the scarcity of identifiable remains in the Old World is even more impressive. In view of the nature of their civilization one should not be puzzled if the Nephites had left us no ruins at all. People underestimate the capacity of things to disappear, and do not realize that the ancients almost never built of stone. Many a great civilization which has left a notable mark in history and literature has left behind not a single recognizable trace of itself. We must stop looking for the wrong things.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nibley|1988|pp=431}}</ref> </blockquote>

====Existing ancient records of the New World====
The National Geographic Society has noted, "Reports of findings of ancient Egyptian Hebrew, and other Old World writings in the New World in pre-Columbian contexts have frequently appeared in newspapers, magazines, and sensational books. None of these claims has stood up to examination by reputable scholars. No inscriptions using Old World forms of writing have been shown to have occurred in any part of the Americas before 1492 except for a few Norse rune stones which have been found in Greenland."<ref name="irr.org/smith"/>

Losses of ancient writings occurred in the Old World, including as a result of deliberate or accidental fires, wars, earthquakes, and floods. Similar losses occurred in the New World. Much of the literature of the pre-Columbian [[Maya civilization|Maya]] was destroyed during the Spanish conquest in the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite book| last =Laughton| first =Timothy| title =The Maya| url =https://archive.org/details/mayalifemythart0000laug_g6s5| url-access =registration| publisher =Duncan Baird Publishers| year= 1998| location =London| page =[https://archive.org/details/mayalifemythart0000laug_g6s5/page/26 26]| isbn =978-1-84483-016-9}}"In the late 1560s the Spanish bishop of Yucatán, Fray Diego de Landa, wrote of the Maya: 'These people also made use of certain characters or letters, with which they wrote in their books of ancient matters and sciences. We found a large number of books written in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which there was not superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all'".</ref> On this point, Michael Coe noted:

<blockquote>Nonetheless, our knowledge of ancient Maya thought must represent only a tiny fraction of the whole picture, for of the thousands of books in which the full extent of their learning and ritual was recorded, only four have survived to modern times (as though all that posterity knew of ourselves were to be based upon three prayer books and ''Pilgrim's Progress'').<ref>{{Harvnb|Coe|2002|pp=199–200}}</ref></blockquote>

The Maya civilization also left behind a vast corpus of inscriptions (upwards of ten thousand are known) written in the [[Maya script]], the earliest of which date from around the 3rd century BC with the majority written in the Classic Period (c. 250–900 AD).<ref>{{Harvnb|Kettunen|Helmke|2005|pg=6}}</ref> [[Mayanist]] scholarship is now able to decipher a large number of these inscriptions. These inscriptions are mainly concerned with the activities of Mayan rulers and the commemoration of significant events, with the oldest known Long Count date corresponding to December 7, 36 BC, being recorded on Chiapa de Corzo ''Stela 2'' in central Chiapas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Coe|2002|p=62}}</ref> None of these inscriptions have been correlated with events, places, or rulers of Book of Mormon.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hougey|first=Hal| title=Archaeology and The Book of Mormon| location=Concord, CA| publisher=Pacific Publishing| year=1983}}</ref>

One Mormon researcher has referred to ancient Mesoamerican accounts that appear to parallel events recorded in the Book of Mormon.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Hemingway| first=Donald| year=2000| title=Ancient America Rediscovered as recorded by Mariano Veytia (1720–1778)| publisher=Bonneville Books| isbn=978-1-55517-479-8}}Among some of the myths recorded by Veytia are that seven families traveled across the ocean to northern American near the time of the confusion of tongues, and thereafter migrated to Central America (pp. 40, 49-50, 192), the belief that there was a great flood (p. 44), an account of a solar eclipse coincident with a tremendous earthquake which resulted in no human fatalities (p. 148), the arrival of Quetzalcoatl in the company of other bearded men as many as thirty years after the earthquake and eclipse (pp. 152, 154, 164), and the presence of giants in New Spain (pp. 140–41).</ref>

====Jaredites and the Olmec====
{{See also|Olmec alternative origin speculations}}
There is no archaeological evidence of the Jaredite people described in the Book of Mormon that is accepted by mainstream archaeologists. Nevertheless, some Mormon scholars believe that the Jaredites were the [[Olmec]] civilization,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sorenson |first1=John L. |title=Mormon's Codex |date=2013 |publisher=Deseret Book |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |isbn=978-1609073992}}</ref><ref>Exploring the Lands of the Book of Mormon, by Joseph L Allen PhD printed in the United States</ref> though archaeological evidence supporting this theory is disputed and circumstantial.

The Jaredites of the Book of Mormon are identified as being primarily located in the land northward as opposed to the land southward,<ref>{{lds|Ether|ether|10|20-21}}</ref> however, no information is discussed specific to the Jaredites as to where the dividing line of the land northward and land southward was.

The date at which the Jaredites would be considered a civilization is not identified in the Book of Mormon. The Jaredite civilization in the American covenant land is said to have been completely destroyed as the result of a civil war some time after (as late as 400 BC).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sorenson |first1=John |title=An Ancient American Setting for the Book of Mormon |date=1985 |publisher=Deseret Book |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |page=119}}</ref> Lehi's party is said to have arrived in the New World (approximately 590 BC). Olmec civilization flourished in Mesoamerica during the Preclassic period, dating from 1200 BC to about 400 BC.

====Nephites====
No Central or South American civilization is recognized to correlate with the Nephites of the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon makes no mention of Lamanites or Nephites erecting impressive works of hewn stone as did the Maya or various South American peoples.<ref>There is no indication that the "walls of stone" mentioned in Alma 48:7 were constructed of hewn stone. The remnants of massive wall piles of stone made by mound builder societies are known to exist in the eastern United States. See for instance May, Wayne N., ''This Land – One Cumorah'', pp. 61–68</ref> Some believe that Nephites lived in the Great Lakes region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bookofmormonevidence.org/feature.php?id=9 |title=BookofMormonEvidence.org |publisher=BookofMormonEvidence.org |date=2010-08-28 |accessdate=2012-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222221144/http://bookofmormonevidence.org/feature.php?id=9 |archive-date=2010-12-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Numerous aboriginal fortresses of earth and timber were known to have existed in this region.<ref>{{Harvnb|Squier|1849}}</ref>

====Military fortifications====
There are ten instances in the Book of Mormon in which cities are described as having defensive fortifications. For example, Alma 52:2 describes how the Lamanites "sought protection in their fortifications" in the city of Mulek.<ref>{{Sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=52|verse=2}}</ref>

One archaeologist has noted the existence of ancient Mesoamerican defensive fortifications.<ref>{{Harvnb|Coe|2002|p=100}}"Bekan in the Chenes region just north of the Peten, which was completely surrounded by massive defensive earthworks some time between the second and fourth centuries B.C. These consist of a ditch and inner rampart, with a total height of 38 ft (11.6 m), and would have been formidable ... if the rampart had been surmounted by a palisade."</ref> According to one article in an LDS Church magazine, military fortifying [[berm]]s are found in the Yucatán Peninsula.<ref>{{cite journal | author=John L.

===Efforts to correlate artifacts===

====Izapa Stela 5====
{{Main|Izapa Stela 5}}
In the early 1950s, [[M. Wells Jakeman]] of the BYU Department of Archaeology suggested that a complicated scene carved on [[Izapa Stela 5|Stela 5]] in [[Izapa]] was a depiction of a Book of Mormon event called "Lehi's dream", which features a vision of the [[tree of life]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Jakeman|1953}}</ref> This interpretation is disputed by other Mormon and non-Mormon scholars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Clark|1999|pp=22–33}}</ref> Julia Guernsey Kappelman, author of a definitive work on Izapan culture, finds that Jakeman's research "belies an obvious religious agenda that ignored Izapa Stela 5's heritage".<ref>{{Harvnb|Guernsey|2006|pp=53}}</ref>

====Other artifacts====
Sorenson claims that one artifact, La Venta Stela 3, depicts a person with Semitic features ("striking beard and beaked nose").<ref>{{Harvnb|Sorenson|1990|p=12}}</ref> Mormon researchers such as Robin Heyworth have claimed that Copan Stela B depicts elephants;<ref>Heywroth, Robin (July 30, 2014), "[https://uncoveredhistory.com/honduras/copan/the-elephants-of-copan/ The Elephants of Copán]," Uncovered History. Retrieved October 5, 2017</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1925}}</ref> others such as Alfred M Tozzer and Glover M Allen claim it depicts macaws.<ref>Zidar, Charles "[http://research.famsi.org/fauna/fauna_info.php?fauna_id=415&family=&genus=&species=&authority=&common=&maya=%3Cspan%20CLASS= ANCIENT MAYA ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH]," Famsi.
