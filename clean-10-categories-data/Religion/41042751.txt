'''The Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation''' or '''CJCUC''' is an educational institution at which Christians who tour [[Israel]] can study the [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis and learn about the Hebraic roots of Christianity. The center was established in [[Efrat]] in 2008 by Rabbi Dr. [[Shlomo Riskin]], who has been described as "the most prominent rabbinic spokesperson to Christian Zionists".<ref name=jesus>{{cite journal|title=The Messiah and Rabbi Jesus: Policing the Jewish–Christian border in Christian Zionism|journal=Culture and Religion|first=Faydra L.|last=Shapiro|year=2012|volume=12|issue=4|pages=463–477|doi=10.1080/14755610.2011.633537|s2cid=143392018}}</ref> CJCUC partners with major Christian interfaith organizations such as [[Christians United for Israel]] and the [[International Christian Embassy Jerusalem]].<ref name=jesus/> Since Riskin's retirement as president of [[Ohr Torah Stone]] in 2018, the overseeing of all CJCUC activities has been turned over to [[David Nekrutman]] who has served as the center's chief director since its inception.<ref name="jpost-feb-2019">{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Interfaith-Relations-Evangelical-Jewish-relations-after-Eckstein-582099|title=INTERFAITH RELATIONS: EVANGELICAL-JEWISH RELATIONS AFTER ECKSTEIN|first1=JEREMY|last1=SHARON|first2=EYTAN|last2=HALON|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=28 February 2019|access-date=1 March 2019}}</ref>

== History ==
The ideological groundwork, which led to the eventual establishment of CJCUC in 2008, began to take shape almost 50 years beforehand. In 1964, Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], the teacher and mentor of CJCUC's Chancellor and Founder, [[Shlomo Riskin]], published an essay entitled "Confrontation"<ref>''Confrontation'', Tradition 6:2 p5-9, 1964. Reprinted in "A Treasury of Tradition", Hebrew Publishing Co, NY, 1967. – {{OCLC|1974913}}</ref> in which he expounded his views on interfaith dialogue and carefully drew out guidelines which permitted such a dialogue and, in the view of Riskin, not only permitted it but rendered it necessary.

At around the same time, fundamental ideological shifts were forming within the ranks of the [[Catholic Church]], and a year after Soloveitchik's essay was published, [[The Holy See]] issued ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions. ''Nostra aetate'' absolved the Jews from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], and admitted that religious antisemitism had a significant role in laying the foundation for the atrocities perpetrated against the Jewish people.

Riskin's academic plunge into Jewish–Christian relations began in the early 1960s when he attended seminars, held by Professor [[David Flusser]], about the Christian Gospels at The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. As an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]], he could pinpoint the parallels for Jesus' teachings within the Hebrew scripture.<ref>''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 15</ref>

After settling in Efrat, Riskin began to engage with the Christian world. Most of the Christian visitors to Efrat, those who came to hear and learn, were [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]]. He formed relations with Rev. Robert Stearns of Eagles' Wings and with Pastor [[John Hagee]].<ref>''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 18</ref><ref name="shabbat-gadol">{{cite web|language=he|url=https://musaf-shabbat.com/2012/05/17/%D7%93%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%92-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99-%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94/|title=Jewish–Christian Dialogue: Rethinking|first=Zur|last=Erlich|publisher=[[Makor Rishon]]|date=17 May 2012|access-date=25 October 2017}}</ref>

Since Riskin's retirement as president of [[Ohr Torah Stone]] institutions in 2018, the overseeing of all CJCUC activities has been turned over to [[David Nekrutman]] who has served as the center's chief director since its inception.<ref name="jpost-feb-2019" />

CJCUC has established a Theological Think Tank, the Institute for Theological Inquiry (ITI),<ref>[http://www.standardnewswire.com/news/890647512.html "CJCUC Announces the Publication of Covenant & Hope"] – standardnewswire.com – 10 August 2012</ref> headed by Rabbi [[Eugene Korn]] and Dr. [[Robert Jenson]] of the [[Witherspoon Institute]], which consists of international scholars and theologians whose tasks are to clarify areas of Jewish and Christian theological agreement and disagreement,<ref>''Covenant and Hope – Christian and Jewish Reflections'' – Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. – July 2012 – {{ISBN|978-0802867049}}</ref> as well as identify areas of fruitful cooperation.

Jews and Christians must be in the forefront of teaching basic moral values to the world.|author=Rabbi [[Shlomo Riskin]]|source=[[Vatican Radio]]<ref name="vaticanradio" />}}

The statement cites traditional opinions by past rabbinic authorities to justify partnership with Christians and religious appreciation of Christianity.<ref name="vaticanradio" />
