'''Baháʼu'lláh'''<ref>The first apostrophe-like letter in "Baháʼu'lláh" is a [[hamza]], which in Persian is pronounced like the catch in the throat in English "uh-oh!". The second is an actual apostrophe, used to show a contraction of the first vowel of "Alláh", and is not pronounced. (Baháʼ-u-Alláh > "Baháʼu'lláh" or "Baháʼulláh".) In printed and ASCII texts they are rendered the same, unless the second is omitted.</ref> (12 November 1817&nbsp;– 29 May 1892) was a [[Persian people|Persian]] religious leader, and the founder of the [[Baháʼí Faith]], which advocates universal peace and unity among all races, nations, and religions.

At the age of 27, Baháʼu'lláh became a follower of the [[Báb]], a Persian merchant who began preaching that God would soon send a new prophet similar to Moses, Jesus, or Muhammad.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} The Báb and thousands of followers were executed by the Iranian authorities for their beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Baháʼu'lláh faced exile from his native Iran, and in [[Baghdad]] in 1863 claimed to be the prophet the Báb foretold. Thus, Baháʼís regard Baháʼu'lláh as a [[Manifestation of God (Baháʼí Faith)|Manifestation of God]], fulfilling the [[eschatology|eschatological]] expectations of [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and other major religions.{{sfn|Buck|2004|pp=143–78}}

Baháʼu'lláh faced further imprisonment under Ottoman authorities, first in [[Edirne]], and ultimately in the prison city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] (present-day [[Israel]]), where he spent his final 24 years. His burial place is a destination of [[Baháʼí pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] for his followers, as well as the direction they face for daily obligatory prayers. The [[Baháʼí World Centre]] sits in nearby [[Haifa]].

{{Main|List of writings of Baháʼu'lláh}}
Baháʼu'lláh wrote many texts, of which only a part has been translated into English until now.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=79–80}}

There have been 15,000 works written by him identified; many of these are in the form of short letters, or tablets, to Baháʼís,{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=79–80}} but he also wrote larger pieces including the ''[[Hidden Words]]'' the ''[[Seven Valleys]]'', the ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán|Book of Certitude]] (Kitáb-i-Íqán)'' and the ''[[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]]''.{{sfn|Daume|Daphne|1988}} The total volume of his works is more than 70 times the size of the [[Quran|Qurʼan]] and more than 15 times the size of the combined [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New Testaments]] of the Bible.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A new volume of Baháʼí sacred writings, recently translated and comprising Baháʼu'lláh's call to world leaders, is published |last=BWNS |accessdate=2006-11-24 |url=http://www.bahaiworldnews.org/story.cfm?storyid=163}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Baháʼí Archives&nbsp;– Preserving and safeguarding the Sacred Texts |author=Archives Office at the Baháʼí World Centre, Haifa, Israel |accessdate=2006-11-24 |url=http://home.wanadoo.nl/arjen.nandita2/bahai-archives.htm}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Numbers and Classifications of Sacred Writings texts |author=Universal House of Justice |accessdate=2006-11-24 |url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_numbers_sacred_writings}}</ref>

The books and letters written by Baháʼu'lláh cover religious doctrine, the proclamation of his claims, social and moral teachings as well as Baháʼí laws; he also wrote many prayers.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=79–80}} Jináb-i-Fádil-i-Mázindarání, analyzing Baháʼu'lláh's writings, states that he wrote in the different styles or categories including the interpretation of religious scripture, the enunciation of laws and ordinances, mystical writings, writings about government and world order, including letters to the kings and rulers of the world, writings about knowledge, philosophy, medicine, and alchemy, writings calling for education, good character and virtues, and writing about social teachings.{{sfn|Fádil-i-Mázindarání|1967|p=453}} All of his works are considered by Baháʼís to be [[revelation]], even those that were written before his announcement of his prophetic claim.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=79–80}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=18–19}}

==Doctrine==
Baháʼu'lláh's teachings focus on the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is considered the source of all created things. Religion, according to Baháʼu'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who reflect perfections through divine intervention and whose teachings are the sources of the major world religions throughout history. Baháʼu'lláh wrote that there are no perfect personalities,{{fact|date=May 2020}} that former Messengers of God reflected God's perfections, that there will be future Messengers of God, and that this is a key concept for understanding how all people are one with Messenger's of God. For instance, Christ is seen as embodying God by reflecting God, but he is not seen as being the whole embodiment of God. He is seen as being given his power. Baháʼís view Baháʼu'lláh as the most recent of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Baháʼu'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Baháʼu'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing about every thousand years.

===Early and family life===
{{Main|Baháʼu'lláh's family}}
[[File:Bahaullah3.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A depiction of [[Mírzá Buzurg]], the father of Baháʼu'lláh]]
Baháʼu'lláh ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|h|ɑː|ʊ|ˌ|l|ɑː}}) was born '''Mírzá Ḥusayn-ʻAlí Núrí''' ({{lang-fa|میرزا حسین‌علی نوری}}) on 12 November 1817 (Muharram 2, 1233 [[Hijri year|AH]]), in [[Tehran]], the capital of [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]], present-day Iran. Baháʼí authors trace his ancestry back to [[Abraham]] through Abraham's wife [[Keturah]],{{sfn|Hatcher|Martin|1998|pp=130–31}} to [[Zoroaster]], to [[Yazdgerd III]], the last king of the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid Empire]], and also to [[Jesse]].{{sfn|Balyuzi|2000|pp=9–12}}{{sfn|Effendi|1944|p=94}} According to the Baháʼí author John Able, Baháʼís also consider Baháʼu'lláh to have been "descended doubly, from both Abraham and Sarah, and separately from Abraham and Keturah".<ref>{{cite book |title=Apocalypse Secrets: Baha'i Interpretation of the Book of Revelation |author=Able, John |publisher=John Able Books Ltd. |year=2011 |location=McLean, VA |isbn=978-0-9702847-5-4 |page=219 |url=https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=WnhSbFFEq0cC&q=keturah#v=snippet&q=keturah&f=false | access-date=1 August 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123062217/https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=WnhSbFFEq0cC&q=keturah#v=snippet&q=keturah&f=false | archive-date=23 January 2015 | url-status=dead}}</ref>

His mother was Khadíjih Khánum, and his father was [[Mírzá ʻAbbás Núrí|Mírzá Buzurg]]. Baháʼu'lláh's father served as [[vizier]] to Imám-Virdi Mírzá, the twelfth son of [[Fath-ʻAli Shah Qajar]]. Mírzá Buzurg was later appointed governor of [[Borujerd|Burujird]] and [[Lorestan]],{{sfn|Balyuzi|2000|pp=11}} a position that he was stripped of during a government purge when [[Mohammad Shah Qajar|Muhammad Shah]] came to power. After the death of his father, Baháʼu'lláh was asked to take a government post by the new vizier [[Hajj Mirza Aghasi|Hajji Mirza Aqasi]], but declined.{{sfn|Cole|1996}}

Baháʼu'lláh had three wives. He married his first wife [[Ásíyih Khánum]], the daughter of a nobleman, in Tehran in 1835, when he was 18 and she was 15.{{sfn|Taherzadeh|2000|pp=20–22}} She was given the title of ''The Most Exalted Leaf'' and ''Navváb''.{{sfn|Taherzadeh|1976|p=13}} His second wife was his widowed cousin Fátimih Khánum. The marriage took place in Tehran in 1849 when she was 21 and he was 32.{{sfn|Taherzadeh|2000|pp=20–22}} She was known as ''Mahd-i-ʻUlyá''. His third wife was Gawhar Khánum and the marriage occurred in Baghdad sometime before 1863.{{sfn|Taherzadeh|2000|pp=20–22}}

He had [[Baháʼu'lláh's family|14 children]], four daughters and ten sons, five of whom he outlived.{{sfn|Cole|1988}} Baháʼís regard Ásíyih Khánum and her children [[Mírzá Mihdí]], [[Bahíyyih Khánum]] and [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]] to be the Baháʼí holy family.{{sfn|Taherzadeh|2000|p=22}}

==Bábí movement==
{{Main|Bábism}}
In 1844, a 24-year-old man from [[Shiraz]], Siyyid Mírzá ʻAlí-Muḥammad, claimed to be the promised redeemer (or [[Mahdi]] and [[Al-Qāʾim Āl Muḥammad|Qaim]]) of Islam, taking the title of the [[Báb]], which means "the gate".{{sfn|MacEoin|1988}} The resulting Bábí movement quickly spread across the [[Persian Empire]], attracting widespread opposition from the Islamic clergy. The Báb himself was executed in 1850 by a firing squad in the public square of [[Tabriz]] at the age of 30.{{sfn|MacEoin|1988}}

The Báb claimed no finality for his revelation.{{sfn|Browne|1889|p=339}} In his writings, he alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as "[[Him whom God shall make manifest]]". According to the Báb, this personage, promised in the sacred writings of previous religions, would establish the kingdom of God on the Earth;{{sfn|MacEoin|1988}}{{sfn|Farah|1970|pp=242–49}} several of the Báb's writings state the coming of ''Him whom God shall make manifest'' would be imminent.{{sfn|Saiedi|2008|p=344}} The Báb constantly entreats his believers to follow ''Him whom God shall make manifest'' when he arrives.{{sfn|Browne|1889|p=339}} The Báb also eliminated the institution of successorship or [[vicegerency]] to his movement, and stated that no other person's writings would be binding after his death until ''Him whom God shall make manifest'' had appeared.{{sfn|Saiedi|2008|p=344}}

===Acceptance of the Báb===
Baháʼu'lláh first heard of the [[Báb]] when he was 27, and received a visitor sent by the Báb, [[Mullá Husayn]], telling him of the Báb and his claims. Baháʼu'lláh became a Bábí and helped to spread the new movement, especially in his native province of [[Noor, Iran|Núr]], where he became recognized as one of its most influential believers.{{sfn|Cole|1988}}{{sfn|Balyuzi|2000|pp=35–37}} His notability as a local gave him many openings, and his trips to teach the religion were met with success, even among some of the religious class. He also helped to protect fellow believers, such as [[Táhirih]], for which he was temporarily imprisoned in [[Tehran]] and punished with [[bastinado]] or foot whipping.{{sfn|Cole|1988}} Baháʼu'lláh, in the summer of 1848, also attended the conference of Badasht in the province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], where 81 prominent Bábís met for 22 days; at that conference where there was a discussion between those Bábís who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the Báb's message began a new dispensation, Baháʼu'lláh took the pro-change side, which eventually won out. It is at this conference that Mírzá Ḥusayn-ʻAlí Núrí took on the title Bahá.{{sfn|Cole|1988}}<ref>{{Cite book|last=Johnson, Todd M. (Todd Michael), 1958-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/826899669|title=The worlds religions in figures : an introduction to international religious demography|others=Bellofatto, Gina A.|date=25 March 2013|isbn=978-1-118-32303-8|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|pages=59|oclc=826899669}}</ref>

When violence started between the Bábís and the Qajar government in the later part of 1848, Baháʼu'lláh tried to reach the besieged Bábís at the [[Battle of Fort Tabarsi|Shaykh Tabarsi]] in [[Mazandaran]], but was arrested and imprisoned before he could get there.{{sfn|Cole|1988}} The following years until 1850 saw the Bábís being massacred in various provinces after the Báb publicly made his claim of being the [[Manifestation of God (Baháʼí Faith)|Manifestation of God]].{{sfn|Cole|1988}}

===Síyáh-Chál===
After the Báb was executed in 1850, a group of Tehran Bábís, headed by a Bábí known as Azim, who was previously a [[Shaykhism|Shaykhi]] cleric, plotted an assassination plan against the Shah [[Nasser-al-Din Shah]], in retaliation for the Báb's execution.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=14–15}} Baháʼu'lláh condemned the plan; however, any moderating influence that he may have had was diminished in June 1851 when he went into exile to [[Baghdad]] at the chief minister's request, returning only after [[Amir Kabir]]'s fall from power.{{sfn|Cole|1988}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=14–15}} On 15 August 1852, the radical group of Bábís attempted the assassination of the [[Shah]] and failed.{{sfn|Cole|1988}} The group of Bábís linked with the plan, were rounded up and executed, but notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire Bábí community was blamed, precipitating [[pogrom|violent riots]] against the Bábí community that were encouraged and orchestrated by the government.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=14–15}} During this time many Bábís were killed, and many more, including Baháʼu'lláh, were imprisoned in the [[Síyáh-Chál]] ("black pit"), an underground dungeon of Tehran.{{sfn|Hutter|2005}}

According to Baháʼu'lláh, it was during his imprisonment in the Síyáh-Chál that he had several mystical experiences, and received a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] of a [[Maid of Heaven|maiden from God]], through whom he received his mission as a messenger of God and as the one whose coming the Báb had prophesied.{{sfn|Cole|1988}}{{sfn|Hutter|2005}} The confession of the would-be assassin had exonerated the Bábí leaders, and in the context of the continuing mass executions of Babis, the [[ambassador]] of [[Russia]] requested that Baháʼu'lláh and other persons apparently unconnected with the conspiracy be spared. After he had been in the Síyáh-Chál for four months Baháʼu'lláh was in fact finally released, on condition he left Iran. Declining an offer of [[refugee status]] in Russia, he chose exile in [[Iraq]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]); in 1853 Baháʼu'lláh and his family, accompanied by a member of the Shah's bodyguard and a representative of the Russian embassy, travelled from Persia,<!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, "Persian Empire"; link to a specific iteration of this topic --> arriving in [[Baghdad]] on 8 April 1853.{{sfn|Cole|1988}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=16}}

==Baghdad==
[[File:Bahaullah-passport.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Baháʼu'lláh's passport, dated January 1853]]

The Báb had appointed Mírzá Yahyá (later known as [[Subh-i-Azal]]) as the leader after himself. Mírzá Yahyá had gone into hiding after the assassination attempt on the Shah, and after Baháʼu'lláh's exile to Baghdad, he chose to join his brother there.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=16}} At the same time, an increasing number of Bábís considered Baghdad the new center for leadership of the Bábí religion, and a flow of [[pilgrim]]s started going there from Persia.

Mírzá Yahyá's leadership was controversial. He generally absented himself from the Bábí community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he went so far as to publicly disavow allegiance to the Báb.{{sfn|Cole|1996}}{{sfn|MacEoin|1987}}{{sfn|Barrett|2001|p=246}} Mírzá Yahyá gradually alienated himself from a large number of the Bábís, who started giving their allegiance to other claimants.{{sfn|MacEoin|1987}} During the time that Mírzá Yahyá remained in hiding, Baháʼu'lláh performed much of the daily administration of Bábí affairs.{{sfn|Cole|1996}} In contrast to Mírzá Yahyá, Baháʼu'lláh was outgoing and accessible, and he was seen by an increasing number of Bábís as a religious leader, rather than just an organizer, and became their center of devotion.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}}

This was increasingly resented by Mírzá Yahyá, who began trying to discredit Baháʼu'lláh,{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}} thus driving many people away from the religion.{{sfn|Cole|1996}} Tensions in the community mounted, and in 1854 Baháʼu'lláh decided to leave the city to pursue a solitary life.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}}

===Kurdistan===
On 10 April 1854, without telling anyone of his intention or destination, Baháʼu'lláh left his family to the care of his brother Mirza Musa and travelled with one companion to the mountains of [[Kurdistan]], northeast of Baghdad, near the city of [[Sulaymaniyah]].{{sfn|Cole|1996}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}} He later wrote that he left so as to avoid becoming a source of disagreement within the Bábí community, and that his "withdrawal contemplated no return".{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}}{{sfn|Baháʼu'lláh|2003|p=160}}

For two years, Baháʼu'lláh lived alone in the mountains of Kurdistan.{{sfn|Hutter|2005}} He originally lived as a [[hermit]], dressed like a [[dervish]] and used the name ''Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani''.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}}{{sfn|Balyuzi|2000|p=116}} At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders.{{sfn|Cole|1996}} As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh ʻUthmán, Shaykh ʻAbdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the [[Naqshbandi|Naqshbandíyyih]], [[Qadiriyyah|Qádiríyyih]], and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2000|p=118}} It was to the second of these that the ''[[Four Valleys (Baháʼí)|Four Valleys]]'' was written. Baháʼu'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.{{sfn|Hutter|2005}}

In Baghdad, given the lack of firm and public leadership by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community had fallen into disarray.{{sfn|Cole|1996}} Some Babis, including Baháʼu'lláh's family, began searching for Baháʼu'lláh, and when news of a man living in the mountains under the name of Darvish Muhammad spread to neighboring areas, Baháʼu'lláh's family begged him to come back to Baghdad.{{sfn|Cole|1996}} On 19 March 1856, after two years in Kurdistan he returned to Baghdad.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}}

===Return to Baghdad===
[[File:Map iran ottoman empire banishment.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Baháʼu'lláh's banishments]]
When Baháʼu'lláh returned to Baghdad he saw that the Bábí community had become disheartened and divided.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}} During Baháʼu'lláh's absence, it had become alienated from the religion because Mirza Yahya had continued his policy of militancy and had been unable to provide effective leadership.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}} Mirza Yahya had married the widow of the Báb against the Báb's clear instructions;{{sfn|Cole|1996}} dispatched followers to the province of Nur for the second attempt on the life of the [[Shah]];{{sfn|Smith|1987|p=60}} and instigated violence against prominent Bábís who had challenged his leadership.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}}

After his return to Baghdad, Baháʼu'lláh tried to revive the Bábí community, mostly through correspondence, writing extensively to give the Bábís a new understanding of the Bábí religion,{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}} while keeping his perceived station as the one promised by the Báb and a [[Manifestation of God (Baháʼí Faith)|Manifestation of God]] hidden. He was soon recognized by the Bábís, as well as government authorities, as the foremost Bábí leader, and there was a growing number of people joining the Bábí movement.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}} He also gained sympathy from government officials and [[Sunni]] clerics.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}} Baháʼu'lláh's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian Bábí community, gained the attention of his enemies in [[Islamic]] clergy and the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian government]].{{sfn|Daume|Daphne|1988}} The Persian government asked the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] to extradite Baháʼu'lláh to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose to move Baháʼu'lláh from the sensitive border region to [[Constantinople]].{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=17}}

===Declaration in the Garden of Ridvan===
On 21 April 1863, Baháʼu'lláh left Baghdad and entered the Najibiyyih gardens, now the location of [[Baghdad Medical City]] and known to Baháʼís as the [[Garden of Ridván, Baghdad|Garden of Ridván]]. Baháʼu'lláh and those accompanying him stayed in the garden for twelve days before departing for Constantinople.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=296–97}} It was during this time that Baháʼu'lláh declared to a small group of his companions his perceived mission and station as a Messenger of God.{{sfn|Hutter|2005}} Baháʼu'lláh declared himself ''[[He whom God shall make manifest]]'', a [[messianic figure]] in the religion of [[Bábism]]. Baháʼu'lláh based this announcement on an experience he had previously while imprisoned in the [[Síyáh-Chál]] in Tehran where he is said to have had a vision of the [[Maid of Heaven]]. Baháʼís regard this period with great significance and celebrate the twelve days that Baháʼu'lláh spent in this Garden as the festival of [[Ridván]].{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=296–97}} He referred to the period of messianic secrecy between when he claimed to have seen the Maiden of Heaven in the Síyáh-Chál and his declaration as the ''ayyam-i butun'' ("Days of Concealment"). Baháʼu'lláh stated that this period was a "set time of concealment".{{sfn|Buck|1998}} The declaration in the Garden of Ridván was the beginning of a new phase in the Bábí community which led to the emergence of the [[Baháʼí Faith]] as a distinctive movement separate from Bábísm.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=23}}

==Imprisonment==
Baháʼu'lláh was given an order to relocate to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. Although not a formal prisoner yet, the forced exile from [[Baghdad]] was the beginning of a long process which would gradually move him into further exiles and eventually to the penal colony of Acre, in Ottoman province Syria.

===Constantinople===
Baháʼu'lláh travelled from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, accompanied by a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he was treated as a government guest.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=23}} Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Baháʼu'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for [[Adrianople]]. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Baháʼu'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=23}}

===Adrianople===
[[File:Early Bahais-1.jpg|thumb|left|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá ín Adrianople with his brothers and companions of Baháʼu'lláh. He is third from the left in the front row.]]

From 1 to 12 December 1863, Baháʼu'lláh and [[Baháʼu'lláh's family|his family]] travelled to [[Adrianople]]. Unlike his travel to Constantinople, this journey was in the nature of an exile.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=23}} Baháʼu'lláh stayed in Adrianople for four and a half years, and was the clear leader of the newly established Bábí community there.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=23}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Anthony A.

The barber, Muhammad ʻAlí of Isfahán, apparently refused and spread word of the danger around the community. Baháʼu'lláh is reported to have counseled "on all patience, quietude and gentleness".{{sfn|Browne|1918|p=17}} This pattern was repeated when, according to the personal account of Ustád Muhammad-ʻAlíy-i Salmání, Mirza Yahya attempted to persuade him likewise to murder Baháʼu'lláh in the bath.{{sfn|Salmání|1982|p=51}} Eventually Mirza Yahya attempted to poison Baháʼu'lláh, an act that left him gravely ill for a time, and left him with a shaking hand for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=24}}{{sfn|Browne|1918|p=16}}<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Cole, J.R.I. |author-link=Juan Cole |title=Baháʼu'lláh's Surah of God: Text, Translation, Commentary |journal=Translations of Shaykhi, Babi and Baháʼí Texts |year=2002 |volume=6 |issue=1 |url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/trans/vol6/surall.htm}}</ref><ref>''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland'', Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland p.296</ref><ref>''Holy People of the World'', Phyllis G. Jestice p.101</ref>

After this event in 1866, Baháʼu'lláh made his claim to be ''He whom God shall make manifest'' public,{{sfn|MacEoin|1987}} as well as making a formal written announcement to Mirza Yahya referring to his followers for the first time as the "''people of Bahá''".{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=24}} After his public announcement, Baháʼu'lláh secluded himself in his house and instructed the Bábís to choose between himself and Mirza Yahya. Baháʼu'lláh's claims threatened Mirza Yahya's position as leader of the religion since it would mean little to be leader of the Bábís if ''Him whom God shall make manifest'' were to appear and start a new religion.{{sfn|Cole|1996}} Mirza Yahya responded by making his own claims, but his attempt to preserve the traditional Bábísm was largely unpopular, and his followers became the minority.{{sfn|MacEoin|1987}}

In 1867, Mirza Yahya challenged Baháʼu'lláh to a test of the divine will in a local [[mosque]] in Adrianople, such that "God would strike down the impostor." Baháʼu'lláh agreed, and went to the Sultan Selim mosque at the appointed time, but Mirza Yahya lost credibility when he failed to show up.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=24}}{{sfn|Browne|1918|p=18}}{{sfn|Salmání|1982|pp=94–95}} Eventually Baháʼu'lláh was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as "He whom God shall make manifest" and his followers began calling themselves [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼís]].{{sfn|Cole|1996}}

===Writings and letters to the leaders of the world===
[[File:House-Bahaullah-Edirne.jpg|thumb|The house where Baháʼu'lláh stayed in [[Edirne|Adrianople]]]]
During his time in Adrianople, Baháʼu'lláh wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during this time was the proclamation of his claimed mission; he instructed some of his followers to take his claims to Bábís in Iran and Iraq who had not heard of his statements, as well as asking the Baháʼís to be united and detached from the world.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=24–25}} He also started to write about distinctive Baháʼí beliefs and practices.

Also, while in Adrianople, Baháʼu'lláh proclaimed the [[Baháʼí Faith]] further by addressing [[Tablet (religious)|tablets]] to the kings and rulers of the world asking them to accept his revelation, renounce their material possessions, work together to settle disputes, and endeavour toward the betterment of the world and its peoples. His first letter was sent to Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] of the Ottoman Empire and his ministers, which was followed by the [[Summons of the Lord of Hosts#Súriy-i-Mulúk (Tablet of the Kings)|Tablet of the Kings]] which was a general address to all rulers.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=24–25}} In that latter letter, the rulers of the earth were asked to listen to Baháʼu'lláh's call, and cast away their material possessions, and since they were given the reins of government that they should rule with [[justice]] and protect the rights of the downtrodden. He also told the rulers to reduce their [[armaments]] and reconcile their differences.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=24–25}} The Christian monarchs were also asked to be faithful to Jesus' call to follow the promised "Spirit of Truth".{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=24–25}}

Later when Baháʼu'lláh was in Acre, he continued writing letters to the leaders of the world including:{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=28–29}}
* [[Pope Pius IX]]
* [[Napoleon III]], Emperor of France
* [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], Tsar of Russia
* [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]], King in Prussia
* [[Queen Victoria]], Queen of Great Britain and Ireland
* [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], Emperor of Austria-Hungary
* [[Sultan ʻAbdu'l-ʻAzíz of the Ottoman Empire]]
* [[Nasser al-Din Shah|Násiri'd-Dín Sháh]] of the Persian Empire
* Rulers of [[Americas|America]] and the Presidents of the republics therein

===Acre===
[[File:AkkaPrison.jpg|thumb|right|Prison in Acre in which Baháʼu'lláh was imprisoned]]
With the Bábí community now irrevocably divided, the followers of Mirza Yahya tried to discredit Baháʼu'lláh to the Ottoman authorities, accusing him of causing agitation against the government.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=26}} While an investigation cleared Baháʼu'lláh, it did bring to the attention of the government that Baháʼu'lláh and Mirza Yahya were propagating religious claims, and, fearing that this might cause future disorder, they decided to again exile the 'Bábí' leaders.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=26}} A royal command was issued in July 1868 condemning the Bábís to perpetual imprisonment and isolation in far-flung outposts of the Ottoman Empire&nbsp;– [[Famagusta]], [[Cyprus]] for Mirza Yahya and his followers, and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], in Ottoman [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], for Baháʼu'lláh and his followers.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=26}}

The Baháʼís, including Baháʼu'lláh and his family, left Adrianople on 12 August 1868, and, after a journey by land and sea through [[Gallipoli]] and [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]], arrived in Acre on 31 August and were confined in the barracks of the city's citadel.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=26}} The inhabitants of Acre were told that the new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly forbidden. The first years in Acre imposed very harsh conditions with many becoming sick, and eventually three Baháʼís dying.{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=26}} Dr. Thomas Chaplin, director of a British Hospital in Jerusalem<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lev |first=Efraim |author2=Yaron Perry |title=Dr Thomas Chaplin, Scientist and Scholar in Nineteenth-Century Palestine |journal=Palestine Exploration Quarterly |volume=136 |issue=2 |pages=151–62 |date=September 2004 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233719857 |doi=10.1179/003103204x4067 |s2cid=161268746 |accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref> visited Baháʼu'lláh in April 1871 and sent a letter to the editor printed in ''[[The Times]]'' in October.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21161/the_times/ "The Babs of Persia"], ''The Times'', London, 5 Oct 1871, p. 8, 3rd column down from top</ref> This seems to be the first extended commentary on Baháʼu'lláh in western newspapers.{{sfn|Momen|1981}} It was also a very trying time for Baháʼu'lláh, whose son, [[Mirzá Mihdí]], died in June 1870 at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and [[meditation]]. After some time, relations between the prisoners and officials and the local community improved, so that the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after the Sultan's death, Baháʼu'lláh was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879 Baháʼu'lláh lived in the house of [[Mazra'a|Mazra'ih]].{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=26}}

}}
The final years of Baháʼu'lláh's life (1879–1892) were spent in the [[Mansion of Bahjí]], just outside Acre, even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. During his years in Acre and Bahjí, since [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]], his eldest son, had taken care of the organizational work, Baháʼu'lláh was able to devote his time to writing, and he produced many volumes of work including the [[Kitáb-i-Aqdas]], his book of laws.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=27–28}} His other works included letters outlining his vision for a [[New world order (Baháʼí)|united world]], as well as the need for ethical action; he also composed many [[Prayer in the Baháʼí Faith|prayers]].{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=27–28}}

In 1890, the [[Cambridge]] [[Orientalism|orientalist]] [[Edward Granville Browne]] had an interview with Baháʼu'lláh in this house. After this meeting he wrote his famous pen-portrait of Baháʼu'lláh:

{{quote|In the corner where the divan met the wall sat a wondrous and venerable figure, crowned with a felt head-dress of the kind called táj by dervishes (but of unusual height and make), round the base of which was wound a small white turban. The face of him on whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read one's very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow; while the deep lines on the forehead and face implied an age which the jet-black hair and beard flowing down in indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist seemed to belie. No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain!{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=27–28}}<ref>[[Edward Granville Browne]] in the introduction to {{Cite web |title=A Traveller's Narrative |publisher=Cambridge |year=1891 |url=http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/tn/tnfrnt.htm |accessdate=2006-06-22 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310135754/http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/tn/tnfrnt.htm | archive-date=10 March 2007 | url-status=dead}}, pp. xxxix–xl.</ref>}}

On 9 May 1892, Baháʼu'lláh contracted a slight fever which grew steadily over the following days, abated, and then finally resulted in his death on 29 May 1892 (Dhu'l Qa'dah 2, 1309 [[Hijri year|AH]]). He was buried in the [[Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh|shrine]] located next to the Mansion of Bahjí.{{sfn|Balyuzi|2000|p=328}}

==Claims==
Baháʼu'lláh stated that he was a messenger of God, and he used the term [[Manifestation of God (Baháʼí Faith)|Manifestation of God]] to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God.{{sfn|Cole|1982}} In the Baháʼí writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated individuals who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization.{{sfn|Cole|1982}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=109}} The Manifestations of God, as explained by Baháʼu'lláh, are not incarnations of God; they reveal God's attributes, not God's essence.{{sfn|Cole|1982}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=107}}

===The Promised One===
Baháʼu'lláh wrote that all the "Manifestations of God" are, in a sense, the same person and speak of past and future manifestations in the first-person. Baháʼís view Baháʼu'lláh as the "Promised One" of older world religions:{{sfn|Buck|2004|pp=143–78}} the "Spirit of Truth" or Comforter predicted by Jesus in his farewell discourse of John 14–17 and the return of [[Christ]] "in the glory of the Father", the return of the [[Kalki avatar]] of Hinduism, the appearance of the [[Maitreya]] Buddha,{{sfn|Momen|1995|pp=50–52}} the return of the [[Husayn ibn Ali|Third Imam]], or the return of Jesus ([[Islamic view of Jesus|Isa]]) expected in Islam.{{sfn|Momen|2000|pp=32–36}}

He stated that his claims to being several messiahs converging in one person were the symbolic, rather than literal, fulfilment of the messianic and [[Eschatology|eschatological]] prophecies found in the literature of the major religions.{{sfn|Buck|2004|pp=143–78}} Baháʼu'lláh's eschatological claims constitute six distinctive messianic identifications:

===Divinity===
Baháʼu'lláh wrote in many styles including cases where he speaks as if he was instructed by God to bring a message; in other cases he writes in the first-person as God speaking, garnering some criticism that he was claiming to be God incarnated.{{sfn|Esslemont|1980|p=41}}{{sfn|Esslemont|1980|p=45}}<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bahaʼi Faith: A Guide For The Perplexed |last=Stockman |first=Robert |year=2012 |page=28 |publisher=[[A & C Black]]}}</ref> [[Denis MacEoin]] states ''"...it is difficult to avoid the suspicion that he [Baha'u'llah] himself made much more radical claims than this in parts of his later writings. The following statements are, I think, explicit enough to serve as examples: 'he who speaks in the most great prison (i.e. Acre) is the Creator of all things and the one who brought all names into being'."''<ref>{{Cite book|last=MacEoin|first=Dennis|url=https://brill.com/view/title/14923|title=The Messiah of Shiraz: Studies in Early and Middle Babism|date=2008-11-30|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-474-4307-0|location=|pages=500|language=en}}</ref> However, the understanding among Baháʼís is that writing in the voice of God is a literary style and represents a message coming through Baháʼu'lláh.{{sfn|Cole|1982}}

===Ancestry===
Baháʼu'lláh is believed to be a descendant of a long line of kings in Persia through [[Yazdgerd III]], the last monarch of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sasanian Dynasty]];{{sfn|Balyuzi|2000|pp=9–12}} he also asserted to be a descendant of [[Abraham]] through his third wife [[Keturah]].{{sfn|Sears|2002}}

==Succession==
After Baháʼu'lláh died on 29 May 1892, the [[Tablets of Baháʼu'lláh#Kitáb-i-ʻAhd (Book of the Covenant)|Will and Testament]] of Baháʼu'lláh named his son [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]] as [[Covenant of Baháʼu'lláh|Centre of the Covenant]], successor and interpreter of Baháʼu'lláh's writings,{{sfn|Bausani|MacEoin|1982}}{{sfn|Momen|2004|pp=97–98}} and the appointment was readily accepted by almost all Baháʼís, since the appointment was written and unambiguous, and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá had proved himself a capable and devoted assistant.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=43–44}} However, the appointment given to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was a cause of jealousy within [[Baháʼu'lláh's family]]. Baháʼu'lláh had also stated that another one of his sons [[Mírzá Muhammad ʻAlí]] was to be subordinate and second in rank after ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=43–44}} Mírzá Muḥammad ʻAlí, however, insisted that ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was exceeding his powers, and started a rebellion, at first covert, and then public to discredit ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. Mírzá Muḥammad ʻAlí's actions, however, were rejected by the majority of the Baháʼís.{{sfn|Smith|2008|pp=43–44}} Due to this conflict, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá later ex-communicated his brother as a [[covenant-breaker]]. The conflict was not long-lived; after being alienated by the Baháʼí community, Muhammad Ali died in 1937 with a handful of followers.

==Commemorations in the Baháʼí calendar==
In the [[Baháʼí calendar]] the events of the birth, declaration and death of the Baháʼu'lláh are commemorated by Baháʼí communities on a yearly basis.{{sfn|Smith|2000|pp=182–83}}

==Photographs and imagery==
[[File:Bahaullah from miller.jpg|thumb|Baháʼu'lláh in 1868. The inscription lists his [[Persian name]]: ''Mírzá Ḥusayn-ʻAlí Núrí'']]
<!-- The use of photographs and imagery has been the subject of much controversy.

Through extensive and repeated consultations a decision has been made to include the picture at the bottom of the article.

There are two known photographs of Baháʼu'lláh, both taken at the same occasion in 1868 while he was in [[Adrianople]] (present-day [[Edirne]]). The one where he looks at the camera was taken for passport purposes and is reproduced in [[William McElwee Miller|William Miller]]'s book on the Baháʼí Faith. Copies of both pictures are at the [[Baháʼí World Centre]], and one is on display in the [[Baháʼí World Centre buildings#International Archives|International Archives]] building, where the Baháʼís view it as part of an organized [[pilgrimage]]. Outside of this experience Baháʼís prefer not to view his photos in public, or even to display any of them in their private homes,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_photographs_bahaullah_miller |title=Photographs of Baháʼu'lláh; William Miller |author=Office for Public Information |accessdate=2014-09-29}}</ref> and Baháʼí institution strongly suggests to use an image of Baháʼu'lláh's burial shrine instead.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bahai.us/system/files/PublicationPhotosV8.pdf |title=Publication of Baháʼí Photos |accessdate=2009-03-19 |publisher=bahai.us |author=United States Baháʼí Office of Communications |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319010835/http://www.bahai.us/system/files/PublicationPhotosV8.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2009}}</ref>

Baháʼu'lláh's image is not in itself offensive to Baháʼís. However, Baháʼís are expected to treat the image of any [[Manifestation of God (Baháʼí Faith)|Manifestation of God]] with extreme reverence. According to this practice, they avoid depictions [[Depiction of Jesus|of Jesus]] or [[depictions of Muhammad|of Muhammad]], and refrain from portraying any of them in [[Play (theatre)|plays]] and [[drama]].{{sfn|Hornby|1983|pp=99–100}} Copies of the photographs are displayed on highly significant occasions, such as six conferences held in October 1967 commemorating the hundredth anniversary of Baháʼu'lláh's writing of the ''[[Suriy-i-Mulúk]]'' (Tablet to the Kings), which [[Shoghi Effendi]] describes as "the most momentous Tablet revealed by Baháʼu'lláh".{{sfn|Effendi|1944|p=171}} After a meeting in Adrianople, the [[Hands of the Cause]] travelled to the conferences, "each bearing the precious trust of a photograph of the Blessed Beauty (Baháʼu'lláh), which it will be the privilege of those attending the Conferences to view".{{sfn|Universal House of Justice|1996|p=105}}

The official Baháʼí position on displaying the photograph of Baháʼu'lláh is:

{{quote|There is no objection that the believers look at the picture of Baháʼu'lláh, but they should do so with the utmost reverence, and should also not allow that it be exposed openly to the public, even in their private homes. |From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, 6 December 1939{{sfn|Hornby|1983|p=540}}}}

While the above passage clarifies that it is considered disrespectful to display his photograph to the public, regarding postings on other websites the [[Baháʼí World Centre]] has written:

{{quote|For Baháʼís, the photograph of Baháʼu'lláh is very precious and it should not only be viewed but also handled with due reverence and respect, which is not the case here [on a non-Baháʼí web site]. Thus, it is indeed disturbing to Baháʼís to have the image of Baháʼu'lláh treated in such a disrespectful way. However, as the creator of the site is not a Baháʼí, there is little, if anything, that can be done to address this matter. We hope these comments have been of assistance."|Office for Public Information, 4 September 1999, Photo of Baháʼu'lláh on Web Site<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_website_photo_bahaullah |title=Photograph of Baha'u'llah on Website |author=Office for Public Information |accessdate=2014-09-29}}</ref>}}
