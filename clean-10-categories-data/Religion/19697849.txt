Infidel is an [[ecclesiastical]] term in [[Christianity]] around which the Church developed a body of theology that deals with the concept of infidelity, which makes a clear differentiation between those who were [[baptized]] and followed the teachings of the Church versus those who are outside the [[faith]].<ref name="IESS">{{cite web|url =http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045301127.html| title = "Infidels."

After the ancient world the concept of otherness, an exclusionary notion of the outside by societies with more or less coherent cultural boundaries, became associated with the development of the monotheistic and prophetic religions of [[Judaism]], Christianity and Islam (cf.

==Etymology==
The origins of the word infidel date to the late 15th century, deriving from the [[French language|French]] ''infidèle'' or [[Latin]] ''īnfidēlis'', from ''in-'' "not" + ''fidēlis'' "faithful" (from ''[[wikt:fides|fidēs]]'' "faith", related to ''fīdere'' 'to trust'). The word originally denoted a person of a religion other than one's own, especially a Christian to a Muslim, a Muslim to a Christian, or a [[gentile]] to a Jew.<ref name="Infidel-Oxford"/> Later meanings in the 15th century include "unbelieving", "a non-Christian" and "one who does not believe in religion" (1527).

==Usage==
Christians historically used the term infidel to refer to people who actively opposed Christianity. This term became well-established in English by sometime in the early sixteenth century, when Jews or Mohammedans (Muslims; formerly called [[saracen]]s), were described contemptuously as active opponents to Christianity. In [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|Catholic dogma]], an infidel is one who does not believe in the doctrine at all and is thus distinct from a [[heresy|heretic]], who has [[Lapsed Catholic|fallen away]] from true doctrine, i.e. by denying the [[divinity of Jesus]]. Similarly, the ecclesiastical term was also used by the [[Methodist Church]],<ref name="Oxford University">{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kxEEAAAAQAAJ&q=A+Dialogue+between+a+Believer+and+an+Infidel&pg=PA305| title = The Wesleyan-Methodist magazine: A Dialogue between a Believer and an Infidel|publisher = [[Oxford University]]|access-date = 2007-03-25| year = 1812}}</ref><ref name="Methodist Review">{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gslWAAAAIAAJ&q=infidel+methodist&pg=PA972| title = The Methodist review, Volume 89|quote=Is it conceivable that a Spirit which is invisible, and imponderable, and impalpable, and yet which is the seat of physical and moral powers, really occupies the universe?

Today, the usage of the term infidel has declined;<ref name="Wheatcroft">{{cite book|url = https://archive.org/details/infidelshistoryo00whea|url-access = registration|page = [https://archive.org/details/infidelshistoryo00whea/page/197 197]| title = Infidels|publisher = [[Random House]]|quote=Likewise, "infidel," which had still been in use in the early nineteenth century, fell out of favor with hymn writers.|access-date = 2007-03-25| isbn = 9780812972399| year = 2005}}</ref> the current preference is for the terms ''non-Christians'' and ''non-believers'' (persons without religious affiliations or beliefs), reflecting the commitment of mainstream [[Christian denominations]] to engage in dialog with persons of other faiths.<ref name="OSVCE">Russell B.

Stravinskas, ''Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Encyclopedia'', [[Our Sunday Visitor Publishing]], 1998, {{ISBN|0-87973-669-0}} p. 535.</ref> Nevertheless, some apologists have argued in favor of the term, stating that it does not come from a disrespectful perspective, but is similar to using the term ''[[orthodoxy|orthodox]]'' for devout believers.<ref name="Orthodox">{{cite book|url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8TYrAAAAYAAJ|page = [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_8TYrAAAAYAAJ/page/n263 188]| title = Infidel Testimony|publisher = J.E.

Moreover, some translations of the [[Bible]], including the [[King James Version]], which is still in vogue today, employ the word ''infidel'', while others have supplanted the term with ''nonbeliever''. The term is found in two places:
{{quotation|And what concord hath [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] with [[Belial]]? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?  —[[2 Corinthians]] 6:15 KJV}}
{{quotation|But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], and is worse than an infidel. —[[1 Timothy]] 5:8 KJV}}

==Infidels under canon law==
===Right to rule===
In ''Quid super his'', [[Innocent IV]] asked the question, "[I]s it licit to invade a land that infidels possess or which belongs to them?" and held that while Infidels had a right to ''dominium'' (right to rule themselves and choose their own governments), the [[pope]], as the [[Vicar]] of [[Christ]], ''de jure'' possessed the care of their [[soul]]s and had the right to politically intervene in their affairs if their ruler violated or allowed his subjects to violate a Christian and Euro-centric normative conception of [[Natural law#Christian natural law|Natural law]], such as sexual perversion or idolatry.<ref name=williams-48>Williams, p.48</ref> He also held that he had an obligation to send [[missionaries]] to infidel lands, and that if they were prevented from entering or preaching, then the pope was justified in dispatching Christian forces accompanied with missionaries to invade those lands, as Innocent stated simply: "If the infidels do not obey, they ought to be compelled by the secular arm and war may be declared upon them by the pope, and nobody else."<ref>Williams, p. 14</ref> This was however not a reciprocal right and non-Christian missionaries such as those of Muslims could not be allowed to preach in Europe "because they are in error and we are on a righteous path."<ref name=williams-48/>

A long line of Papal hierocratic canonists, most notably those who adhered to Alanus Anglicus's influential arguments of the Crusading-era, denied Infidel dominium, and asserted [[Rome]]'s universal jurisdictional authority over the earth, as well as the right to authorize pagan conquests solely on the basis of non-belief because of their rejection of the Christian God.<ref>Williams, pp. 41, 61–64</ref> In the extreme, the hierocractic canonical discourse of the mid-twelfth century, such as that espoused by Bernard of Clairvaux, the mystic leader of the Cisertcians, legitimized [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] colonial expansion and practice of forceful [[Christianisation]] in the [[Slavic Europe|Slavic territories]] as a [[religious war|holy war]] against the [[Wends]], arguing that infidels should be killed wherever they posed a menace to Christians. When [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick the II]] unilaterally arrogated papal authority, he took on the mantle to "destroy convert, and subjugate all barbarian nations," a power in papal doctrine reserved for the pope. Hostiensis, a student of Innocent, in accord with Alanus, also asserted "... by law infidels should be subject to the faithful." [[John Wyclif]], regarded as the forefather of [[English Reformation]], also held that valid ''dominium'' rested on a state of [[Divine grace|grace]].<ref name=williams-61>Williams, pp. 61–64</ref>

The [[Teutonic Knights]] were one of the by-products of this papal hierocratic and German discourse. After the [[Crusades]] in the [[Levant]], they moved to crusading activities in the infidel [[Baltics]]. Their crusades against the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuanians]] and [[History of Poland (1385–1569)|Poles]], however, precipitated the Lithuanian Controversy, and the [[Council of Constance]], following the condemnation of Wyclif, found Hostiensis's views no longer acceptable and ruled against the knights. Future Church doctrine was then firmly aligned with Innocents IV's position.<ref name=williams-64>Williams, pp. 64–67</ref>

The later development of counterarguments on the validity of Papal authority, the rights of infidels, and the primacy of [[natural law]] led to various treatises such as those by [[Hugo Grotius]], [[John Locke]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]], which in turn led to the transformation of [[international law]]'s treatment of the relationship between Christian and non-Christian societies and the development of [[human rights]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Colonization of the Americas====
During the [[Age of Discovery]], [[papal bull]]s such as ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' and, more importantly, ''[[inter caetera]]'' (1493), implicitly removed ''dominium'' from infidels and granted them to the [[Spanish Empire]] and [[Portugal]] with the charter of guaranteeing the safety of missionaries. Subsequent rejections of the bull by [[Protestantism|Protestant]] powers rejected the Pope's authority to exclude other Christian princes. As independent authorities, they drew up [[charter]]s for their own [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[Mission (Christian)|mission]]s based on the temporal right for care of infidel souls in language echoing the ''inter caetera''. The charters and papal bulls would form the legal basis of future negotiations and consideration of claims as [[title deed]]s in the emerging [[law of nations]] during the period of [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]].<ref>Christopher 31-40</ref>

The rights bestowed by ''Romanus Pontifex'' and ''inter caetera'' have never fallen from use, serving as the basis for legal arguments over the centuries. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in the 1823 case ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]] ''that as a result of European discovery and assumption of ultimate dominion, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] had only a right to occupancy of native lands, not the right of title. This decision was upheld in the 1831 case ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'', giving Georgia authority to extend state laws over [[Cherokee]]s within the state, and famously describing Native American tribes as "domestic dependent nations." This decision was modified in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', which stated that the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], and not individual [[U.S. state|states]], had authority in Indian affairs, but it maintained the loss of right to title upon discovery by Europeans.

Native American groups including the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] and [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] have called on the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to revoke the bulls of 1452, 1453, and 1493.

===Marriage===
According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], the Catholic Church views [[Catholic marriage|marriage]] as forbidden and null when conducted between the faithful (Christians) and infidels, unless a [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] has been granted. This is because marriage is a [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament of the Catholic Church]], which infidels are deemed incapable of receiving.<ref name="catenc">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08002b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Infidels |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1910-10-01 |access-date=2014-08-22}}</ref>

==As a philosophical tradition==
Some [[Philosophy|philosophers]] such as [[Thomas Paine]], [[David Hume]], [[George Holyoake]], [[Charles Bradlaugh]], [[Voltaire]] and [[Rousseau]] earned the label of infidel or [[Freethought|freethinkers]], both personally and for their respective traditions of thought because of their attacks on religion and opposition to the Church. They established and participated in a distinctly labeled, infidel movement or tradition of thought, that sought to reform their societies which were steeped in Christian thought, practice, laws and culture. The Infidel tradition was distinct from parallel anti-Christian, sceptic or deist movements, in that it was anti-theistic and also synonymous with atheism. These traditions also sought to set up various independent model communities, as well as societies, whose traditions then gave rise to various other socio-political movements such as [[secularism]] in 1851, as well as developing close philosophical ties to some contemporary political movements such as [[socialism]] and the [[French Revolution]].<ref name="Royle">Royle, Edwards, "Victorian Infidels: The Origins of the British Secularist Movement 1791–1866", Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0-7190-0557-4}}</ref>

Towards the early twentieth century, these movements sought to move away from the tag "infidel" because of its associated negative connotation in Christian thought, and there is attributed to George Holyoake the coining of the term 'secularism' in an attempt to bridge the gap with other theist and Christian liberal reform movements.<ref name = "Royle"/>

In 1793, Immanuel Kant's ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', reflected the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] periods' philosophical development, one which differentiated between the moral and rational and substituted rational/irrational for the original true believer/infidel distinction.<ref name="IESS"/>

==Implications for medieval civil law==
Laws passed by the Catholic Church governed not just the laws between Christians and infidels in matters of religious affairs, but also civil affairs. They were prohibited from participating or aiding in infidel religious rites, such as [[circumcision]]s or wearing images of non-Christian religious significance.<ref name="catenc"/>

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], based on the idea of the superiority of Christians to infidels, regulations came into place such as those forbidding Jews from possessing Christian [[slave]]s; the laws of the [[decretal]]s further forbade Christians from entering the service of Jews, for Christian women to act as their nurses or midwives; forbidding Christians from employing Jewish physicians when ill; restricting Jews to definite quarters of the towns into which they were admitted and to wear a dress by which they might be recognized.<ref name="catenc"/>

Later during the Victorian era, testimony of either self-declared, or those accused of being Infidels or Atheists, was not accepted in a [[court]] of law because it was felt that they had no moral imperative to not lie under [[oath]] because they did not believe in God, or [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]].<ref name = "Royle"/>

These rules have now given way to modern [[legislation]] and Catholics, in civil life, are no longer governed by ecclesiastical law.<ref name="catenc"/>

The class of ''kafir'' also includes the category of ''murtadd'', variously translated as [[apostasy|apostate]] or [[apostasy in islam|renegades]], for whom [[Fiqh|classical jurisprudence]] prescribes death if they refuse to return to Islam.<ref name="J. Brill 1936, page 619"/> On the subject of ritual impurity of unbelievers, one finds a range of opinions, "from the strictest to the most tolerant", in classical jurisprudence.<ref name="J.

Historically, the attitude toward unbelievers in Islam was determined more by socio-political conditions than by religious doctrine. A tolerance toward unbelievers  prevailed even to the time of the [[Crusades]], particularly with respect to the People of the Book. However, animosity was nourished by repeated wars with unbelievers, and warfare between [[Safavid]] Persia and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]] brought about application of the term ''kafir'' even to Persians in Turkish [[fatwa]]s.<ref name="J. Brill 1936, page 619"/>

In [[Sufism]] the term underwent a special development, as in a well-known verse of [[Abū-Sa'īd Abul-Khayr|Abu Sa'id]]: "So long as belief and unbelief are not perfectly equal, no man can be a true Muslim", which has prompted various explanations.<ref name="J. Brill 1936, page 619"/>

[[Judaism]] has a notion of [[pagan]] gentiles who are called {{hebrew|עכומ}} ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>acum'', an acronym of Ovdei Cohavim u-Mazzaloth or, literally, "star-and-constellation worshippers".<ref name = "IESS"/><ref>Walter Zanger, "[http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/ancient-israel/jewish-worship-pagan-symbols/ Jewish Worship, Pagan Symbols: Zodiac mosaics in ancient synagogues]", ''Bible History Daily''; first published 24 August 2012, updated 24 August 2014.</ref><ref>Shay Zucker, "[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/seri/IAUS./0260//0000301.000.html Hebrew Names of the Planets]", ''The Role of Astronomy in Society and Culture, Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union'', IAU Symposium, Volume 260; p. 302.</ref>

The [[Hebrew]] term, ''[[kofer]]'', cognate with the Arabic ''kafir'', is reserved only for [[Apostasy in Judaism|apostate Jews]].<ref name = "IESS"/>
