'''Collective responsibility''' also known as '''collective guilt'''{{by whom|date=December 2020}} refers to [[Social responsibility|responsibilities]] of organizations, groups and societies.<ref name="Mellema1997">{{cite book|author=Gregory Mellema|title=Collective Responsibility|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wiz-mc1nOLAC|year=1997|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-420-0311-1}}</ref> In reality collective responsibility could be both collective guilt as well as collectible honor. Particularly, it could be seen in the Soviet honoring system which was awarding state orders and decorations to Soviet enterprises and even Soviet [[union republics]] or cities, such as [[Hero city]].

As the business practices known as [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) and [[sustainability]] mature and converge with the responsibilities of governments and citizens, the term "collective responsibility" is beginning to be more widely used.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Journal|first=Scientific Research|title=Scientific Research Journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/7890971|language=en}}</ref>

Collective responsibility is widely applied in corporations, where the entire workforce is held responsible for failure to achieve corporate targets (for example, profit targets), irrespective of the performance of individuals or teams which may have achieved or overachieved within their area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.continental-people.com/building-a-culture-of-responsibility-in-cep-plant-timisoara/|title=Building a culture of Responsibility in CEP Plant Timișoara – Continental|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> [[Collective punishment]], even including measures that actually further harm the prospect of achieving targets, is applied as a measure to 'teach' the workforce.

==In culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
The concept of collective responsibility is present in literature, most notably in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s "[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]", a poem telling the tale of a ship's crew who died of thirst after they approved of one crew member's killing of an [[albatross]].

1959's ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' and 1983's prison [[crime drama]] ''[[Bad Boys (1983 film)|Bad Boys]]'' depict collective responsibility and punishment.
The play 'An Inspector Calls' by J.B Priestley also features the theme of collective responsibility throughout the investigation process.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Samuel Taylor Coleridge {{!}} SpringerLink|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-230-62785-7|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-0-230-62785-7|doi-broken-date=9 November 2020}}</ref>

== In politics ==
{{main|Cabinet collective responsibility}}
In some countries with [[parliamentary system]]s, there is a convention that all members of a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] must publicly support all government decisions, even if they do not agree with them. Members of the cabinet that wish to dissent or object publicly must resign from their position or be sacked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tutor2u.net/politics/reference/collective-cabinet-responsibility|title=Collective Cabinet Responsibility|last=tutor2u|date=2018-12-22|website=tutor2u|language=en|access-date=2018-12-22}}</ref>

As a result of collective responsibility, the entire government cabinet must resign if a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]] is passed in [[parliament]].

This concept is found in the [[Old Testament]] (or Tanakh), some examples include the account of the [[Noah's Ark|Flood]], the [[Tower of Babel]], [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and in some interpretations, the [[Book of Joshua]]'s [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]]. In those records entire communities were punished for the acts of the vast majority of their members, however it is impossible to state that there were no innocent people, or children too young to be responsible for their deeds, on whom it was inflicted as well.

The practice of [[Jewish deicide|blaming the Jews for Jesus' death]] is the longest example of collective responsibility.  In this case, the blame was cast not only on the Jews of the time but upon successive generations. This comes from Matthew 27:25-66 New International Version (NIV) 25: "All the people answered, 'His blood is on us and on our children!'"

== Collective punishment ==
{{main|Collective punishment}}
[[File:Bekanntmachung Warschau 1943.jpg|thumb|Announcement of execution of 100 [[Poles|Polish]] ''[[roundup (history)|roundup]]'' (pol: ''łapanka'') hostages as revenge for assassination of 5 German policemen and 1 SS man by [[Armia Krajowa]]'s guerrilla fighters (referred to in the text as: a Polish "terrorist organization in British service"). Warsaw, 2 October 1943]]
Collective responsibility in the form of collective punishment is often used as a disciplinary measure in closed institutions, e.g. [[boarding schools]] (punishing a whole class for the actions of one known or unknown pupil), military units, prisons (juvenile and adult), psychiatric facilities, etc. The effectiveness and severity of this measure may vary greatly, but it often breeds distrust and isolation among their members. Historically, collective punishment is a sign of [[authoritarian]] tendencies in the institution or its home society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psypost.org/2017/09/personality-traits-predict-authoritarian-tendencies-study-finds-49705|title=Personality traits predict authoritarian tendencies, study finds|date=2017-09-29|website=PsyPost|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> For example, in the Soviet [[Gulag]]s, all members of a ''brigada'' (work unit) were punished for bad performance of any of its members.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alexopoulos|first=Golfo|date=January 2008|title=Stalin and the Politics of Kinship: Practices of Collective Punishment, 1920s–1940s|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=50|pages=91–117|doi=10.1017/S0010417508000066}}</ref>

Collective punishment is also practiced in the situation of war, [[economic sanctions]], etc., presupposing the existence of collective guilt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/dickson/dickson_collectivepunishment.pdf|title=On the (in) effectiveness of collective punishment: An experimental investigation|last=Dickson|first=Eric|website=NYU.edu}}</ref> Collective guilt, or guilt by association, is the controversial collectivist idea that individuals who are identified as a member of a certain group carry the responsibility for an act or behavior that members of that group have demonstrated, even if they themselves were not involved.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fletcher|first=George|date=January 2004|title=Collective Guilt and Collective Punishment|journal=Theoretical Inquiries in Law 5, No. 1|pages=163–178}}</ref> Contemporary systems of criminal law accept the principle that guilt shall only be personal.<ref>{{Citation|last=Edwards|first=James|title=Theories of Criminal Law|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/criminal-law/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> Others view groups as being entities in themselves (an [[wikt:entitative|entitative]] group), capable of holding guilt or responsibility independent of any of the group's members.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=David L.|last2=Sherman|first2=Steven J.|last3=Castelli|first3=Luigi|date=2002-01-01|title=A Group By Any Other Name—The Role of Entitativity in Group Perception|journal=European Review of Social Psychology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=139–166|doi=10.1080/14792772143000049|s2cid=144009376|issn=1046-3283}}</ref>

Terror groups of all kinds bomb civilians who are seen as collectively responsible for the acts of their leaders.  The state level bombing of civilians became popular in the Twentieth Century although ancient warriors would often slaughter whole cities if they resisted demands for capitulation or tribute.

During the [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany]], the Germans applied collective responsibility: any kind of help given to a person of Jewish faith or origin was punishable by death, and that not only for the rescuer but also for his/her family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/ulma.asp|title=Jozef & Wiktoria Ulma – The Righteous Among The Nations – Yad Vashem}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/wegrzynowska.asp|title=Vasiuta Wegrzynowska and her children – Righteous Among the Nations}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/stories/wolska.asp|title=Malgorzata Wolska and her children – Righteous Among the Nations}}</ref> This was widely publicized by the Germans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citinet.net/ak/polska.php?Page=27&Lang=EN|title=Info|publisher=citinet.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235753/http://www.citinet.net/ak/polska.php?Page=27&Lang=EN|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead|access-date=15 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ww2today.com/19th-june-1943-the-nazi-abuse-of-the-polish-people-continues|title=The Nazi abuse of the Polish people continues – WWII Today|date=19 June 2013|website=ww2today.com}}</ref> During the occupation, for every German killed by a Pole, 100-400 Poles were shot in retribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projectinposterum.org/docs/survivors_print.htm|title=Project InPosterum: Forgotten Survivors.

Another example is when after the war, [[History of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe|ethnic Germans in Central and Eastern Europe]] were held collectively responsible for [[Nazi]] crimes, resulting in numerous atrocities against the German population, including killings (see [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II]] and [[Beneš decrees]]).<ref>Steffen Prauser and Arfon Rees, [http://cadmus.iue.it/dspace/bitstream/1814/2599/1/HEC04-01.pdf "The Expulsion of 'German' Communities from Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001022039/http://cadmus.iue.it/dspace/bitstream/1814/2599/1/HEC04-01.pdf |date=1 October 2009 }}, cadmus.iue.it, European University Institute, Florence.

==Criticism==
In ethics, both methodological individualists and normative individualists question the validity of collective responsibility.

<blockquote>
''Methodological individualists challenge the very possibility of associating moral agency with groups, as distinct from their individual members, and normative individualists argue that collective responsibility violates principles of both individual responsibility and fairness''. ([[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]])<ref>{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/collective-responsibility/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Marion|last=Smiley|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> </blockquote>

Normally, only the individual actor can accrue culpability for actions that they freely cause. The notion of collective culpability seems to deny individual moral responsibility. Does collective responsibility make sense? History is filled with examples of a wronged man who tried to avenge himself, not only on the person who has wronged him, but on other members of the wrongdoer's family, tribe, ethnic group, religion, or nation.<ref name="MayHoffman1992">{{cite book|author1=Larry May|author2=Stacey Hoffman|title=Collective Responsibility: Five Decades of Debate in Theoretical and Applied Ethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQMfAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA36|date=27 October 1992|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-0-7425-7402-1|pages=36–}}</ref>

According to [[genocide scholar]] [[A. Dirk Moses]], "The ''collective guilt'' accusation is unacceptable in scholarship, let alone in normal discourse and is, I think, one of the key ingredients in genocidal thinking."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Margaret Lavinia |last2=Reynolds |first2=Michael |last3=Kieser |first3=Hans-Lukas |last4=Balakian |first4=Peter |last5=Moses |first5=A.

The ''collective guilt'' accusation is unacceptable in scholarship, let alone in normal discourse and is, I think, one of the key ingredients in genocidal thinking. It fails to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, on which international humanitarian law has been insisting for over a hundred years now.}}</ref>
