'''Mahanam Sampraday''' is a [[Sampradaya]] or a tradition or religious lineage founded by Sripad Mahendraji  .<ref>{{Cite book|last=[[Mahanambrata Brahmachari]]|title=Mahendra Leelalamrita|location=Kolkata|pages=26}}</ref> Mahanam Sampraday was formed between late 19th century and early 20th century in [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal Presidency/province of colonial British India.]]Presently followers of Mahanam Sampraday are centered in [[West Bengal]], India and throughout Bangladesh. [[Radha Krishna]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Gour]] [[Nitai]] and [[Prabhu Jagadbandhu|Prabhu Jagadbandu]] are the chief deities worshiped by the Mahanam Sampraday.

== History of formation ==

=== Arrival of new incarnation ===
Formation of Mahanam Sampraday started with the advent of [[Prabhu Jagadbandhu]] , whom Mahanam Sampraday ( and many others ) believe as a reincarnation of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] and [[Nitai|Nityananda Ram]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=mahanam.org|url=http://mahanam.org/?q=Prabhu-Jagadbandhu|access-date=2020-10-19|website=mahanam.org}}</ref> on 28 April 1871.

[[Prabhu Jagadbandhu|Prabhu Jagadbandu]] was a great Hindu Saint. He said<ref>{{Cite book|last=Collection by|first=Brahmachari Parimalbadhu Das|title=Bandhu Ved Bani[Veda quotes of Bandhu]|location=Kolkata,Sri Mahanambrata cultural and welfare trust|pages=1}}</ref>

{{Quote|text=Show kindness and compassion and do well to all creatures. Make a free gift of religion to all. Initiation in the hallowed name of Hari is the sure means of attaining salvation (i.e; deliverance from all agonies and sufferings). This is the secret of salvation. This is the secret of eternal good done to others|author=[[Prabhu Jagadbandhu]]|title=|source=}}

=== Preaching of religion by Prabhu Jagadbandhu and Mahagambhira Lila :- ===
[[Prabhu Jagadbandhu]] preached [[Vaishnavism|Vaishavite Hinduism]] for 30 years. He asked people to chant the holy name of God ( [[Radha Krishna]] or [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Gour]] [[Nitai]] ), to develop [[Love of God#Bhakti movements|love for God]]  or prem. He urged everyone to love all creatures irrespective of [[Caste system in India|caste]] or creed.

Later in 1902 [[Prabhu Jagadbandhu|Prabhu Jagadbandu]] closed him in a small cottage and stayed there for 17 years. This time period is referred to as the 'Maha Gambhira Lila'. ( in contrast to [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's]] Gambhira Lila.)

=== Arrival of Sripad Mahendraji :- ===
Sripad Mahendraji renounced the world at an early age of 20 years. He went to [[Vrindavan]] in search of [[Krishna|lord Krishna]]. later, he went to [[Sri Angan]], [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]], [[Bangladesh]] where [[Prabhu Jagadbandhu]] was at that time, in the small cottage.

Sripad Mahendraji decided to settle in [[Sri Angan]] and lead the life of an aashramite Brahmachari i.e. Living in a [[ashram]] and follow [[Brahmacarya]] .

=== Formation of Mahanam Sampraday and after:- ===
After few years, [[Prabhu Jagadbandhu|Prabhu jagadbandhu]] employed Sripad Mahendraji with a mission. Prabhu Jagadbandu asked Sripad Mahendraji to organise a band of selfless Brahmacharies i.e. those who follow [[Brahmacarya]]. He asked Sripad Mahendraji to go with the band of Brahmacharies from place to place and preach the  'Mahanam'.

Accordingly, a band of about 50 [[Sannyasa|sannyasins]] was assembled, who together founded the Mahanam Sampraday under the leadership of Sripad Mahendraji.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Mahanam Sampraday|url=http://www.mahanam.org/?q=history-of-mahanam-sampraday}}</ref>

Later Sripad Mahendraji made his disciple [[Mahanambrata Brahmachari|Dr. Mahanambrata Brahmachariji]] , the head of Mahanam Sampraday.

== Mahanam Sampraday under Dr. Mahanambrataji. ==
After the formation of Mahanam Sampraday, Sripad Mahendraji received letter of invitation for the 2nd [[Parliament of the World's Religions|parliament of world religion]] ( or more commonly the [[World Fellowship Center|world fellowship of faiths]] ) in the year 1933.<ref name=":0" />

Sripad Mahendra ji sent [[Mahanambrata Brahmachari|Mahanambrata brahmachariji]] as a deligate to [[Chicago]] to attend the conference.

After returning from Chicago and after the death of Sripad Mahendraji, [[Mahanambrata Brahmachari|Dr. Mahanambrata Brahmachariji]] was made the head of Mahanam Sampraday.

Under [[Mahanambrata Brahmachari|Dr. Mahanambrata Brahmachariji's]] guidance Mahanam Sampraday developed further.Under [[Mahanambrata Brahmachari|Dr. Mahanambrata Brahmachariji's]] guidance 'Mahanam Sevak Sangha' , a subsidiary of Mahanam Sampradaya was established for the non-ashramite followers. 'Mahanambrata Cultural and Welfare Trust' , a publication was also initiated by [[Mahanambrata Brahmachari|Dr. Mahanambrata Brahmachariji]].

== Mahanam Sampraday in present ==
[[Mahanambrata Brahmachari|Dr. Mahanambrata Brahmachariji]] allowed Srimat Nabanibandhu Brahmachari and Srimat Upasakbandhu Brahmachari to carry forward the guru parampara or spiritual lineage or. allowed them to give [[Diksha|mantra diksha]] or initiate devotees.

By the time [[Mahanambrata Brahmachari|Dr. Mahanambrata Brahmachariji]]  left the world in 1999,<ref>{{Cite news|date=1 November 1999|title=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/01/world/mahanambrata-brahmachari-is-dead-at-95.html}}</ref> [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Bangladesh attained its liberation]].

So, in 1999, Srimat Nabanibandhu Brahmachari became the head of Mahanam Sampraday in Bangladesh and Srimat Upasakbandhu Brahmachari became the head of Mahanam Sampraday in India.

When Srimat Nabanibandhu Brahmachari left the world Srimat Kantibandhu Brahmachari became the head of Mahanam Sampraday in Bangladesh.

Therefore, Srimat Upasakbandhu Brahmachari Srimat Kantibandhu Brahmachari are the head of Mahanam Sampraday in India and Bangladesh respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Present Spiritual head of Mahanam Sampraday|url=http://mahanam.org/?q=content/present-sprirtual-head}}</ref>

== Philosophy/Ideology of Mahanam Sampraday ==
Mahanam Sampraday is a [[neo Vaishavite]] religious cult. It believes in attaining the five principals of [[Humanity (virtue)|Mansatvya or Humanity]] namely-<ref name=":0" />

1.[[Achourya or Asteya|Achourya [also called Asteya]]].([[Stealing|Not to steal]])

2.[[Ahimsa]]. ([[Nonviolence|Non- Violence]])

3.[[Satya]] ( [[Honesty|to be truthful]])

4. [[Samyama]] ( [[Self-control|Self - restraint]])

5.[[shaucha]]  ( [[cleanliness]] of both inner self and body )

Dr. Mahanambrata Brahmachariji once said the following about Mahanam Sampraday's philosophy called Manav Dharma -<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bio sketch of Dr. [[Mahanambrata Brahmachari]]ji by|first=Mahanam Sampraday|title=Rekhay lekhay Mahanambrata [Dr. [[Mahanambrata Brahmachari]]ji in text and sketch]|publisher=Sree Mahanambrata Cultural and Welfare Trust|year=2008|location=[[Kolkata]]|pages=Pg no. 33}}</ref>

{{Quote|text=The perfection of human life is in the attainment of humanity.  In order to gain humanity, one has to achieve five Qualities. [[Ahimsa]]([[Non-Violence]]), [[Samyama]]([[Self-restraint]]), [[Shaucha]]([[cleanliness]]), [[Achourya]]( non- thiefness), and [[Satya]]([[truth]]).  Do not envy anyone.  Do not steal anyone's goods.  Body and mind, Keep them holy.  Always be self - restrained in moral character. Don't let untruth touch(influence) your deeds and words .  As a human being, we have just one [[Dharma]] ie. Attaining Manushatvya ([[Humanity (virtue)|Humanity]]).  This same thing has been told by [[Prabhu Jagadbandhu]] in the form of a [[Sutra]] - " Ei Marma Ei Dharma"

 I advice all to become human beings after attaining Manushatvya ([[Humanity (virtue)|humanity]]) and also help others to become human.  This is the best service to the people.|author=Dr. [[Mahanambrata Brahmachari]]ji|title=|source=}}

== Mahanam Mahakirtan ==
According to Mahanam Sampraday, Mahanam Mahakirtan is a key aspect of their religious practice/cult. Mahanam literally means 'Great name'. It generally refers to the following lines from Prabhu Jagadbandhu's book named 'Chandrapath'<ref>{{Cite book|last=Prabhu|first=Jagadbandhu|title=Chandrapath|publisher=Mahanam Cultural and Welfare Trust|year=1951|pages=Pg no. 3}}</ref>
{{Quote|text=Hari purusha Jagadbandhu Maha Uddharana

Charihasta Chandraputra Hakitapatana

(Prabhu Prabhu Prabhu Hey)  (Anantanantamaya)|author=[[Prabhu Jagadbandhu]]|title='MAHANAM'|source=Chandrapath}}Mahakirtan means 'Great [[Kirtan#Vaishnavism|Kirtan]] or congregation chanting of holy name of lord.'

So, <u>Mahanam Mahakirtan</u> literary means congregation chanting of above mentioned Mahanam.

[[Mahanambrata Brahmachari|Dr. Mahanambrata Brahmachariji]]  and Mahanam Sampraday believes that [[Prabhu Jagadbandhu]]sundar will someday come out the casket after hearing the Mahanam Mahakirtan.
