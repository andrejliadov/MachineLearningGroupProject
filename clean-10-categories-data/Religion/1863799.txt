{{short description|Term for period of hypothesized peace between Muslims, Christians and Jews in Iberia}}
{{History of al-Andalus}}
'''''La Convivencia''''' ({{IPA-es|la kombiˈβenθja|lang}}, "The Coexistence") is an academic hypothesis, first proposed by the Spanish philologist [[Américo Castro]], regarding the period of [[History of Spain| Spanish history]] from the [[Muslim]] [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in the early eighth century until the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Edict of Expulsion|expulsion of the Jews]] in 1492. It claims that in the different [[Al-Andalus|Moorish Iberian kingdoms]], the [[Moors|Muslims]], [[Catholic Church|Christians]] and [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Jews]] lived in relative peace. According to this interpretation of history, this period of religious diversity differs from later Spanish and Portuguese history when—as a result of expulsions and forced conversions—Catholicism became the sole religion in the Iberian Peninsula.

However, some voices have challenged the historicity of the above view of the supposed intercultural harmony as a "myth", with the argument that it depends too strongly on unreliable documentation.<ref name="DassMyth">{{cite news|last1= Dass|first1= Nirmal|title= Review of The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise: Muslims, Christians, and Jews Under Islamic Rule in Medieval Spain|url= http://newramblerreview.com/book-reviews/history/andalusia-or-the-legend-of-islamic-spain|access-date= 24 May 2016|publisher= Intercollegiate Studies Institute|date= 20 April 2016}}</ref><ref name="Qurtuba">[http://www.awraq.es/blob.aspx?idx=5&nId=96&hash=ac20943d589408c5a0a3cd2c1e0908a4], Qurtuba:  Algunas reflexiones críticas sobre el califato de Córdoba y el mito de la convivencia [Qurtuba:  Some Critical Reflections on the Caliphate of Cordova and the Convivencia Myth], by Eduardo Manzano Moreno, Awraq n.° 7. 2013, pp 226-246</ref> According to ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages'', "Critics charge that [the term 'convivencia'''<nowiki/>''''] too often describes an idealized view of multi-faith harmony and symbiosis, while supporters retort that such a characterization is a distortion of the complex interactions they seek to understand."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Alvarez|first=Lourdes María|title=The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|editor-last=Bjork|editor-first=Robert E.|chapter=Convivencia}}</ref>

==Cultural meaning==
''La Convivencia'' often refers to the interplay of cultural ideas between the three religious groups and ideas of [[religious tolerance]]. [[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]] invokes this concept and indicates that it played an important role in bringing the classics of Greek philosophy to Europe, with translations from Greek to Arabic to Hebrew and Latin.<ref>Carroll, James (2001), ''Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews'', Chapter 33. Houghton Mifflin, Co., Boston.</ref> Jerrilynn Dodds references this concept in the spatial orientation seen in architecture that draws on building styles seen in synagogues and mosques.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The arts of intimacy : Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the making of Castilian culture|last=Denise.|first=Dodds, Jerrilynn|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|others=Menocal, Maria Rosa., Balbale, Abigail Krasner.|isbn=9780300142143|location=New Haven|oclc=213407379}}</ref>

An example of ''La Convivencia'' was [[Córdoba, Andalusia]] in [[Al-Andalus]], in the ninth and tenth centuries. Córdoba was “one of the most important cities in the history of the world.” In it, “Christians and Jews were involved in the Royal Court and the intellectual life of the city.”<ref>Amir Hussain, “Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue,” in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 257 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).</ref> [[María Rosa Menocal]],  Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, further describes the libraries of Córdoba as "a significant benchmark of overall social (not just scholarly) well being, since they represented a near-perfect crossroads of the material and the intellectual." <ref>Menocal, María Rosa (2002), "The Ornament of the World: how Muslims, Jews, and Christians created a culture of tolerance in medieval Spain", Little, Brown, Boston.</ref>

James L. Heft, the Alton Brooks Professor of Religion at [[University of Southern California|USC]], describes ''La Convivencia'' as one of the “rare periods in history” when the three religions did not either keep “their distance from one another, or were in conflict.” During most of their co-existing history, they have been “ignorant about each other” or “attacked each other.”<ref>[http://ifacs.com/the-necessity-of-inter-faith-diplomacy-the-catholicmuslim-dialogue/ James L. Heft, “The Necessity of Inter-Faith Diplomacy: The Catholic/Muslim Dialogue”] The First Sheridan-Campbell Lecture Given at the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies, Malta, May 20, 2011.</ref>

==Historical Context==
The period of Convivencia began in the early eighth century when Arab invaders took political control over the Iberian Peninsula, calling it al-Andalus. With the death of ruler Al-Hakam in 976, the Caliphate began to dissolve and fragmented into six large states and a number of smaller ones. Al-Andalus was briefly consolidated again by Muslim invaders and reformists, the Almoravids and the Almohads, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The Christian kingdoms progressively expanded south taking over Muslim territory in what is historiographically known as the Reconquista, effectively confining al-Andalus to the southern emirate of Granada, ruled by the Nasrid dynasty from 1231 to 1492.<ref>Mills, K., Taylor, W. B., & Lauderdale, G. S. (2002). Colonial Latin America: A documentary history. Wilmington, Del: Scholarly Resources.</ref>

==End of the Convivencia==
{{main|Expulsion of the Moriscos}}
{{main|Expulsion of the Jews from Spain}}
While the [[Reconquista]] was ongoing, Muslims and Jews who came under Christian control were allowed to practise their religion to some degree. This ended in the late 15th century with the [[fall of Granada]] in 1492. Even before this event, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] had been established in 1478. In 1492, with the [[Alhambra decree]], those Jews who had not converted to Catholicism were expelled. Many Jews settled in [[Portugal]], where they were expelled in 1497.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lowenstein|first=Steven|title=The Jewish Cultural Tapestry: International Jewish Folk Traditions|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=36|isbn=9780195313604|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWToS3VyqVMC&dq=jewish+cultural+tapestry}}</ref>

Similarly the Muslims of Iberia were forced to convert or face either death or expulsion. This happened even though the Granadan Muslims had been assured of religious freedom at the time of their surrender. Between 1500 and 1502 all remaining Muslims of Granada and Castile were converted.<ref name="Making Europe">{{cite book|last1=Kidner|first1=Frank|last2=Bucur|first2=Maria|last3=Mathisen|first3=Ralph|last4=McKee|first4=Sally|last5=Weeks|first5=Theodore|title=Making Europe: The Story of the West|date=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781285415185|pages=376|edition=2}}</ref> In 1525, Muslims in Aragon were similarly forced to convert. The Muslim communities who converted became known as [[Moriscos]]. Still they were suspected by the ''old Christians'' of being crypto-Muslims and so between 1609 and 1614 their entire population of 300,000 was forcibly expelled. All these expulsions and conversions resulted in Catholic Christianity becoming the sole sanctioned religion in the Iberian Peninsula.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

As Anna Akasoy has summarized in a review article, Menocal "argues that the narrow-minded forces that brought about its end were external."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Akasoy|first=Anna|date=August 2010|title=Convivencia and its discontents: Interfaith life in Al-Andalus|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=42:3|pages=489-99}}</ref>

==Primary Sources==
'''Muslims Celebrate Christian Festivals in Mid-Ninth Century'''
<br>
The first source is a collection of letters in which the Islamic leaders were asked about the legality of Muslims' observance and participation in Christian festivals.
<br>
{{Quotation|“Do you think that it is a forbidden innovation, which a Muslim cannot be permitted to follow, and that he should not agree to accept from any of his relatives and in-laws any of the food that they prepared for the celebration? Is it disapproved of, without being unambiguously forbidden? Or is it absolutely forbidden? There are traditions handed down from the prophet of God concerning those of his community who imitated the Christians in their celebration of Nauruz and Mihrajan, to the effect that they would be mustered with the Christians on the Day of Judgement… So explain to us what you consider correct in this matter, if God wills.” 
He answered: “It is forbidden to do everything that you have mentioned in your letter, according to the ‘ulama (scholars of religious learning). Receiving presents at Christmas from a Christian or from a Muslim is not allowed, neither is accepting invitations on that day, nor is making preperations for it… whoever imitates a people, will be mustered with them.”<ref>Mills, K., Taylor, W. B., & Lauderdale, G. S. (2002). Colonial Latin America: A documentary history. Wilmington, Del: Scholarly Resources.</ref>|}}

'''A Description of Christian Spain from the Tenth Century'''
<br>
An excerpt from the work of al-Bakri, the son of a Muslim ruler of the southern Spanish town of Saltes, offers a short description of Christian Spain, particularly on customs of washing.<br>

{{Quotation|“Early authorities divided Jilliqiyya (León and Castile, Christian kingdoms in the north of the Iberian Pensinsula) into four parts; the first part is that which lies to the west and faces to the north… The city of Braga is one of the first cities founded by the Christians and one of their capitals… nowadays it is ruined and almost empty; the Muslims destroyed it and drove away their inhabitants… The whole of Jilliqiyya is flat and most of the land is covered in sand… the inhabitants are a treacherous people of depraved morals, who do not keep themselves clean and only wash once or twice a year in cold water. They do not wash their clothes once they have put them on until they fall to pieces on them…they have great courage and do not contemplate flight when battle is joined, but rather consider death a lesser evil.”<ref>Mills, K., Taylor, W. B., & Lauderdale, G. S. (2002). Colonial Latin America: A documentary history. Wilmington, Del: Scholarly Resources.</ref> |}}

'''Rules for the Christians from the Early Twelfth Century'''<br>
Rules Muslims should follow when living among Christians.<br>
{{Quotation|“A Muslim should not rub down a Jew, nor a Christian (in the baths), neither should he throw out their refuse nor cleanse their lavatories; the Jews and Christians are more suitable for such a job, which is a task for the meanest. A Muslim should not work with the animals of a Jew, nor of a Christian, neither should he ride in their company, nor grasp their stirrup. If the muhtasib gets to know of this, the perpetrator will be censured.”
“Muslim women must be prevented from entering disgusting churches, for the priests are fornicators, adulterers, and pederasts… they have made what is lawful unlawful, and made what is unlawful lawful. One must not sell a scientific book to the Jews, nor to the Christians, unless it deals with their own law; for they translate book sof science, and attribute them to their own people and to their bishops, when they are really the works of the Muslims.”
“Muslims are forbidden to buy meat intentionally from the butcheries of the dhimmis (Christians and Jews)… Ibn al-Qasim said, about a Christian who willed that some of his property should be sold on behalf of a church, that it was not lawful for a Muslim to buy it, and that any Muslim who bought it would be a bad Muslim… He (Malik) abhorred traveling with them (dhimmis) in ships, because of the fear of divine wrath descending upon them.”
“The dhimmis must be prevented from having houses that overlook Muslims, and from spying on them, and from exhibiting wine and pork in the Muslims’ markets, from riding horses with saddles and wearing the costumes of Muslims or anything ostentatious. They must be made to display a sign that will distinguish them from Muslims, such as the shakla (piece of yellow cloth)…”<ref>Mills, K., Taylor, W. B., & Lauderdale, G. S. (2002). Colonial Latin America: A documentary history. Wilmington, Del: Scholarly Resources.</ref> |}}

'''Letter from Jewish Philosopher Moses Maimonides (1135-1204) fleeing Al-Andalus'''

{{Quotation|“Dear brothers, because of our many sins Hashem has cast us among this nation, the Arabs, who are treating us badly. They pass laws designed to cause us distress and make us despised. ... Never has there been a nation that hated, humiliated and loathed us as much as this one.”<ref>Maimonides, Moses, and Avraham Yaakov Finkel. The Essential Maimonides: Translations of the Rambam. Jason Aronson, Incorporated, 1996.</ref>|}}

==Debate==
The idea of the ''convivencia'' has had supporters and detractors from the time Castro first proposed it.  Hussein Fancy has summarized the underlying assumptions on both sides of the debate: "The ''convivencia'' debates were never about political ideologies or partisan politics, as they are often construed, but rather," as Ryan Szpiech<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Szpiech|first=Ryan|date=2013|editor-last=Akbari|editor-first=Suzanne|editor2-last=Mallette|editor2-first=Karla|title=The Convivencia Wars|journal=A Sea of Languages: Rethinking the Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History.|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=135–61}}</ref> has argued, "about fundamental and unresolved methodological and philosophical issues. While Castro appealed to philosophical interpretivism, [Claudio] Sánchez-Albornoz appealed to scientific positivism."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hussein|first=Fancy|date=2019|title=The new convivencia|journal=Journal of Medieval Iberian Studies|volume=11:3}}</ref>

[[David Nirenberg]] challenged the significance of the age of "convivencia," claiming that far from a "peaceful ''convivencia''" his own work "demonstrates that violence was a central and systemic aspect of the coexistence of majority and minority in medieval Spain, and even suggests that coexistence was in part predicated on such violence".<ref>Nirenberg, David, Communities of violence • Persecution of Minorities in the Middle ages. Princeton University Press, 1996. P. 9.</ref>

[[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]], professor of Near Eastern studies at [[Princeton University]], in his ''Under Crescent and Cross'', calls the "idealized" interfaith utopia a "myth" that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as [[Heinrich Graetz]] in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews.<ref name = cohen>{{cite book |last= Cohen |first= Mark R. |title= Under Crescent and Cross |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |date=October 1995 |isbn= 0-691-01082-X}}</ref> This myth was met with what Cohen calls the "counter-myth" of the "neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history" by [[Bat Yeor]] and others,<ref name = cohen /> which also "cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lasker |first1=Daniel J. |last2=Cohen |first2=Mark R. |title=Under Crescent and Cross. The Jews in the Middle Ages |journal=The Jewish Quarterly Review |date=July 1997 |volume=88 |issue=1/2 |pages=76 |doi=10.2307/1455066}}</ref> Cohen aims to present a correction to both these "myths".

The Spanish mediaevalist Eduardo Manzano Moreno wrote that the concept of convivencia has no support in the historical record [“el concepto de convivencia no tiene ninguna apoyatura histórica“]. He further states that there is scarcely any information available on the Jewish and Christian communities during the Caliphate of Cordoba, and that this may come as a shock in view of the huge clout of the convivencia [[meme]] [“... quizá pueda resultar chocante teniendo en cuenta el enorme peso del tópico convivencial.”] According to Manzano, Castro’s conception "was never converted into a specific and well-documented treatment of el-Andalus, perhaps because Castro never succeeded in finding in the Arabist bibliography materials suitable for incorporation into his interpretation.”<ref name="Qurtuba"/>

"[C]ontemporary ecumenicists appeal to the 'Golden Age' of tolerance" in the 10th and 11th centuries in [[Caliphate of Córdoba | Córdoba]] under Muslim rule, but, for the most part, they are not interested in what actually happened among the Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Rather, they mention "tolerance", a concept that "would have had little or no meaning" at that time.<ref>

On the contrary,they make appeals to categories that carry much valence in the modern world (such as 'tolerance'), but that clearly would have had little or no meaning in the time in question.|author-link1=Aaron W.
