Most Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be [[sacramental character|neither repeated nor undone]]. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by [[irreligion|rejecting religion]] entirely. But some other organizations and individuals are practicing '''debaptism'''.

In addition to ''de facto'' renunciation through [[apostasy]], or [[heresy]], the Roman Catholic Church envisaged from 1983 to 2009 the possibility of [[formal act of defection from the Catholic Church|formal defection from the Church]] through a decision manifested personally, consciously and freely, and in writing, to the competent church authority, who was then to judge whether it was genuinely a case of "true separation from the constitutive elements of the life of the Church ... (by) an act of apostasy, heresy or schism."<ref name=PCLT>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/intrptxt/documents/rc_pc_intrptxt_doc_20060313_actus-formalis_en.html |title=Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, '&#39;Actus formalis defectionis ab Ecclesia catholica'&#39; |publisher=Vatican.va |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref> A formal defection of this kind was then noted in the register of the person's baptism, an annotation that, like those of marriage or ordination, was independent of the fact of the baptism and was not an actual "debaptism", even if the person who formally defected from the Catholic Church had also defected from the Christian religion. The fact of having been baptized remains a fact and the Catholic Church holds that baptism marks a person with a lasting [[sacramental character|seal or character]] that "is an ontological and permanent bond which is not lost by reason of any act or fact of defection."<ref name=PCLT/> Nonetheless, formal requests for debaptisms are made; in France, a man sued the French Catholic church for "its refusal to let him nullify his baptism." He had been "un-baptized" in 2000, and ten years later he demanded to have his name stricken from the baptismal records, a request granted by a judge in Normandy, a decision appealed by the church.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/01/29/146046428/on-the-record-a-quest-for-de-baptism-in-france|title=Off The Record: A Quest For De-Baptism In France : NPR|last=Beardsley|first=Eleanor|date=January 29, 2012|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=February 2, 2012}}</ref>
