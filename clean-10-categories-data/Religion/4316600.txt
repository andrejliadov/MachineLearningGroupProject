The '''eagle bone whistle''' is a religious object, used by some members of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] spiritual societies in [[sacred]] ceremonies. They are made from bones of either the American [[bald eagle]] or the American [[golden eagle]], and are considered powerful spiritual objects.<ref name="Maroukis">Maroukis, Thomas Constantine (2005).

==Use==
Eagle bone whistles are used in many ceremonies of various American Indigenous cultures.<ref name="Maroukis"/> The eagle bone whistle may be considered as a ceremonial or sacred object which may not be considered a musical instrument, if music is defined as entertainment: "There is no time or need...<!--here-->to wallow in distinctions between a feather-and-bone raptor and a bone whistle avian mysticism; one would no doubt end in [[dichotomy|dichotomous]] Western readings thereof."<ref name="Gannon"/>

The whistle is used in some [[Peyote]] ceremonies of some sects of the [[Native American Church]].<ref>Swan, Daniel C. (1999). ''Peyote Religious Art: Symbols of Faith and Belief'', p.29.

==Federal law==
Both the bald and golden eagle are protected by federal law: the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] (MBTA) prohibits the taking, killing, possession, transportation, and importation of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, and nests except as authorized under a valid permit as outlined at [[Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations|50 CFR]] 21.11<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/50/22.1 |title= 50 CFR 22.1 - What is the purpose of this part? |publisher=Cornell University Law School - Legal Information Institute | accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/RegulationsPolicies/mbta/43603%20QA%201013%20rule.pdf | date=17 September 1999 | title = Migratory Bird Management Information: List of Protected Birds (10.13) Questions and Answers | publisher = [[US Fish & Wildlife Service]] | accessdate = 7 August 2015}} As amended 20 May 2008.</ref> The MBTA authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to determine if, and by what means, the hunting of migratory birds should be allowed, as well as to adopt and implement suitable regulations permitting and governing the hunting of any type of migratory bird (for example, hunting seasons for ducks and geese). The [[Eagle feather law]] is another name for the exemptions to this act that are sometimes granted to enrolled members of federally recognized Native American tribes. Penalties under the MBTA include a maximum of two years imprisonment and $250,000 fine for a felony conviction and six months imprisonment or $5,000 fine for a misdemeanor conviction.<ref>[http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/environment/ac-cn-eagles-drones-0423-story.html Drone pilot buzzed Bald Eagle's Nest] Capital Gazette.

These laws would apply to the collection and use of eagle bone whistles.
