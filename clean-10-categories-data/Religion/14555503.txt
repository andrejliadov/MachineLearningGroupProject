The '''Leipzig Human Rights Award''' is an honor given by the European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA, which recognizes "efforts towards [[human rights]] and [[freedom of expression]] in the USA" and actions against what the organization refers to as "human rights violations by the [[totalitarian]] [[Scientology]]."<ref name="cisar">{{cite news | last =Cisar | first =Joe |  title =Introduction from American Co-Moderator | work =Leipzig Award |    date =June 3, 2000 | url =http://www.leipzig-award.org/englisch/preisverleihung_2000.htm | access-date =  2007-12-03}}</ref>  Prior to 2001, the honor was known as the '''Alternative Charlemagne Award'''.<ref name="cisar" />

==History==

===Formation===
Originally begun as the "Alternative Charlemagne Award," the honor was formed as a counterpoint to the [[Karlspreis|Charlemagne Award]] given to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] in 2000.<ref name="winkel2000">{{cite news   | last =Winkel   | first =Achim  |  title =Alternative Charlemagne Award for Scientology Critic from the USA  | work =Badische Neueste Nachrichten   |    date =May 31, 2000  }}</ref> Presented in [[Aachen, Germany]], the Charlemagne Award, or Karlspreis, "honors individuals who promote democracy, human rights and the common values of Europe."<ref name="singer2004" />  The original title of the Leipzig Human Rights Award was so-named as a way of criticizing the relationship between the [[Church of Scientology]] and the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]], which granted Scientology [[tax exemption]] status during Clinton's term in office.<ref name="evers2000">{{cite news   | last =Evers    | first =Bernd   |  title =Scientology: Criticism of the Charlemagne Award for U.S. President Clinton  | work =Neue Bildpost  | pages =Nr. 23, Page 1  |   date =June 1, 2000  }}</ref>  The European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA was formed in 1997, and includes committee members from [[Germany]], the [[United States]], [[England]], [[Austria]], [[Russia]] and [[Sweden]].<ref name="freie2003" />  The Committee opposes "physical and psychological abuse of humans under the pretext of religion."<ref name="freie2003" />  The organization notes that their criticism of the United States for "its failure to confront Scientology’s human rights abuses while promoting the cult around the world" has made the Award controversial, and states that all past recipients of the Award have been targeted by the Church of Scientology as [[Suppressive person]]s, and subjected to the Church's [[Fair game (Scientology)|Fair Game policy]].<ref name="singer2004" />  Award recipients do not receive financial compensation as part of the award.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Distinction for Ex-Minister Blüm  | work =[[Bild-Zeitung]]  |    date =May 31, 2001  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news   | last =Staff  |   title =Leipzig Human Rights Award for French Cult Commissioner  | work =EPD Press agency|    date =May 11, 2002  }}</ref>

The organization's charter cites its concern over the deaths of [[Lisa McPherson]] and [[Patrice Vic]], and states "We wish to express our support for the American people and the American government in ending human rights violations against US citizens and other people, committed by the Scientology Organization."<ref name="charter">{{cite news  | last =European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA |   title =Charter | work =Leipzig Award | url =http://www.leipziger-preis.de/englisch/grundsatztext.htm  | access-date =  2007-12-03}}</ref>  Specifically, the Leipzig Human Rights Award charter calls on the United States to reestablish "true freedom of life, speech, religion, personality and pursuit of happiness," and emphasizes [[freedom of speech]], freedom for members of an organization to leave that organization without fear of retribution, freedom from [[blackmail]] through materials obtained during spiritual counseling, and calls on the United States for full disclosure of "secret agreements" between the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and the Church of Scientology.<ref name="charter" />
