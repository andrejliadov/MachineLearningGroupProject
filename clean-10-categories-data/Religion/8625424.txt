'''Nudity in religion''' deals with the differing attitudes to [[nudity]] and [[modesty]] among world [[religion]]s.

==Ancient Greek religion==
[[File:Venere di Milo 02.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of ''[[Aphrodite of Milos]]'', the Greek goddess of love and beauty, ({{circa|100}} BC), [[Louvre]]]]
[[Hesiod]], the writer of the poem ''[[Theogony]]'', which describes the origins and genealogies of the [[Greek gods]] in [[Ancient Greek religion]], suggested that farmers should "Sow naked, and plough naked, and harvest naked, if you wish to bring in all [[Demeter]]'s fruits in due season."{{sfn|Villing|2010|p=40}} Demeter is the goddess of the harvest and agriculture, who presided over grains and the fertility of the earth.

Although most ceremony and traditions involve dressing up, often with some preferential attire, certain cultural or religious traditions actually prescribe(d) ritual nudity. For example, ancient [[Sparta]] held a yearly celebration from 668 BC called [[gymnopaedia]] during which [[nudity|naked]] youths displayed their athletic and martial skills through the medium of [[war dance|war dancing]].<ref>Paul Cartledge, ''Spartan Reflections'' p.102</ref>

== Abrahamic religions ==

The [[Abrahamic religion]]s of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] all recount the legend of the [[Garden of Eden]], found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in which [[Adam and Eve]] are unaware of their nakedness until they eat the [[forbidden fruit]] of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]]. After this, they feel ashamed and try to cover themselves with [[Figs in the Bible|fig leaves]].{{bibleverse||Genesis|3:74|NIV}} Judaism does not share the Christian association of nakedness with [[original sin]], an aspect integral to the doctrine of redemption and salvation. In Islam the garden is in Paradise, not on Earth.{{efn|when they tasted of the tree, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to sew together the [[ficus|fig]] [[fig leaf|leaves]] of the garden over their bodies.{{Cite quran|7|22}} }} This is to show that women and men should be covered in clothing, for nudity has the stigma of shame attached to it.{{efn|O children of Adam! We have indeed sent down to you clothing to cover your shame, and (clothing) for beauty and clothing that guards (against evil), that is the best.{{Cite quran|7|26}} }} Each of these religions has its own unique understanding of what is meant to be taught with the recounting of the story of Adam and Eve.

=== Judaism ===
{{see also|Tzniut}}

In Judaism, nudity is an aspect of [[body modesty]] which is regarded as very important in most social and familial situations. Attitudes to modesty vary between the different movements within Judaism as well as between communities within each movement. In more strict (orthodox) communities, modesty is an aspect of [[Tzniut]] which generally has detailed rules of what is appropriate behaviour. [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]] generally promote modesty values but do not regard the strict Tzniut rules as binding, with each person being permitted (at least in principle) to set their own standards. With the exception of the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] community, Jewish communities generally tend to dress according to the standards of the society in which they find themselves.

A person who enters a ritual bath (a ''[[mikveh]]'') does so without clothing, and with no jewelry or even bandages.

Care needs to be taken when reading the Bible, where some references to nakedness serve as a euphemism for intimate sexual behaviour.{{sfn|Telushkin|1977|p=17-18}} For example, in the story of Noah we see the hesitancy of two of [[Noah]]'s sons when they have to cover their father's nakedness, averting their eyes, after Noah's youngest son "saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside" what he had done to his father.{{efn|[Noah] drank the wine [of his vineyard] and became drunk. He uncovered himself inside his tent. Ham saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their backs, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And when Noah awoke and learned what [Ham] had done to him, he said "Cursed be Canaan [Ham's son], the lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers.{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:21-25|NIV}} }}{{efn|it has been suggested that this episode involved Ham doing more than just viewing his father's nakedness.{{sfn|Edwards|1978|p=113}} }} Nakedness may also be a metaphor for empty-handedness, specifically in situations where a sacrifice or offering to God is expected.

=== Christianity ===

[[File:Baptism - Marcellinus and Peter.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Representation of baptism in early Christian art]]
[[File:Chlodwigs taufe.jpg|thumb|upright|Baptism of [[Clovis I]] (496)]]
''{{Main|Christian naturism}}''

The early Christian Church reflected the contemporary attitudes of Judaism towards nudity. The Old Testament is not positive towards nudity.{{sfn|Knights|1999}} In {{bibleverse||Isaiah|20|NIV}}, Isaiah walks nude as a sign of shame.

The first recorded [[liturgy]] of [[baptism]], written down by Saint [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in his ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'', required men, women and children to remove all clothing, including all foreign objects such as jewellery and hair fastenings.{{sfn |Hippolytus|2013|p=33}} {{harvtxt|Guy|2003}}, however argues that complete nudity for baptism candidates (especially women) would not be the norm. He notes that at certain times and in certain places candidates may have been totally naked at the point of baptism, but the Jewish taboo of female nakedness would have mitigated widespread practice of naked baptism.

Later [[Christians|Christian]] attitudes to nudity became more restrictive, and baptisms were segregated by sex and then later were usually performed with clothed participants. Some of the [[Eastern Orthodox church]]es today maintain the early church's liturgical use of baptismal nudity, particularly for infants but also for adults.

Several saints, such as a number of the [[Desert Fathers]] as well as [[Basil Fool for Christ]], practiced nudity as a form of [[ascetic]] poverty.

Early Christian art included depictions of nudity in baptism. When artistic endeavours revived following the [[Renaissance]], the [[Catholic Church]] was a major sponsor of art bearing a religious theme, many of which included subjects in various states of dress and including full nudity. Painters sponsored by the Church included [[Raphael]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Michelangelo]], but there were many others. Many of these paintings and statues were and continue to be displayed in churches, some of which were painted as murals, the most famous of which are at the [[Sistine Chapel]] painted by Michelangelo.

{{harvtxt|Smith|1966}}, in discussing [[logion]] 37{{efn|Jesus' disciples ask, "When will you be revealed to us and when will we see you? Jesus said: When you unclothe yourselves without being ashamed and take off your clothes and put them under your feet as little children and tread on them, then [shall you see] the Son of the Living One and you shall not fear"<ref name="free_Gosp">{{Cite web | title = Gospel of Thomas Translated by Paterson Brown | work = freelyreceive.net | accessdate = 2016-07-18 | url = http://freelyreceive.net/metalogos/files/thomas.html#37 }}</ref>
 }} of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], notes that early Christian art depicts,{{sfn|Wilpert|1929}} as one would expect, Adam and Eve in Paradise naked. The only other Old Testament figures who are depicted nude are [[Jonah]] emerging from the mouth of the Great Fish, [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] emerging from the Lion's Den, and the resurrected in [[Ezekiel]]'s vision of the dry bones:<ref>{{bibleref |Ezekiel|37:1|KJV}}</ref> these Old Testament scenes containing nude figures are precisely those which were held to be types of the [[resurrection]]. Among the New Testament illustrations, apart from baptismal scenes, there are nudes only in one representation of the raising of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and one representation of the [[Miracle at Cana]].

In 1981, [[Pope John Paul II]] expressed the Catholic Church's attitude to the exposure of the human body in ''[[Love and Responsibility]]'': "The human body can remain nude and uncovered and preserve intact its splendour and its beauty... Nakedness as such is not to be equated with physical shamelessness... Immodesty is present only when nakedness plays a negative role with regard to the value of the person... The human body is not in itself shameful... Shamelessness (just like shame and modesty) is a function of the interior of a person."{{sfn|Wojtyla|2013|p=}}

=== Christian sects ===
[[File:The arrest of Adamites in a public square in Amsterdam. Etch Wellcome V0035701.jpg|thumb|The arrest of [[Adamites]] in a public square in Amsterdam]]
Sects have arisen within [[Christianity]] from time to time that have viewed nudity in a more positive light. For example, to the [[Adamites]] and the [[Freedomites]], social nudity was an integral part of their ritual.{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Adamites, an early Christian [[sect]], practiced "holy nudism", engaging in common worship in the nude. During the [[Middle Ages]], the doctrines of this obscure sect were revived: in the Netherlands by the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] and the [[Taborites]] in Bohemia, and, in a grosser form, by the [[Beghards]] in Germany. Everywhere, they met with firm opposition from the mainstream churches.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01135b.htm Adamites], Catholic Encyclopedia</ref>

A religious sect in Canada that immigrated from Russia, the [[Sons of Freedom (political group)|Sons of Freedom]], went so far in the 1900s (1903-1950s) as to publicly strip in mass public demonstrations to protest against government policies which were meant to assimilate them.<ref>* Jim Hamm Productions Limited ''Spirit Wrestlers'', a 2002 documentary video and DVD about the Russian Christian sect called Freedomite Doukhobors,</ref>

[[Christian naturism]] contains various members associated with most [[Christian denomination|denominations]]. Although beliefs vary, a common theme is that much of Christianity has misinterpreted the events regarding the Garden of Eden, and God was displeased with Adam and Eve for covering their bodies with fig leaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.figleafforum.com/resources_genesis.html |title="What Do The First Three Chapters Of Genesis Teach About Clothing?" by Ian B. Johnson, Fig Leaf Forum (note: articles such as this one are peer reviewed) |publisher=Figleafforum.com |accessdate=2013-03-14}}</ref> {{harvtxt|De Clercq|2011}} argues that the significance of the human need for clothing by far exceeds its theological meaning.

== Indian religions ==

[[File:Naga baba.jpg|thumb|right|[[Naga sadhu|Naga mystics]], at the Hindu bathing ceremony of Ardha [[Kumbh Mela]], at [[Allahabad]]]]

In ancient [[Indian Subcontinent|Indian]] cultures, there was a tradition of extreme asceticism (obviously [[minoritarian]]) that included full nudity. This tradition continued from the [[gymnosophists]] (philosophers in antiquity) to certain holy men (who may however cover themselves with ashes) in present-day [[Hindu]] devotion and in [[Jainism]].

In the 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] encountered, in India, wandering groups of naked holy men whom he dubbed the ''naked philosophers'' (''Gr ''gymnos'': naked; ''sophist'': knowledge''). The philosopher [[Onesicritus]] investigated their beliefs and lifestyle. [[Pyrrho]] the [[Sceptic]] was impressed and incorporated nudity into his philosophy. The Gymnosophists were [[Hindu]]s, but [[Jain]] and [[Ajivika]] monks practiced nudity as a statement that they had given up all worldly goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/subdivisions/subdivisions.shtml |title=Religion & Ethics - Jain sects |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>

=== Hinduism ===
====Philosophical basis====
The philosophical basis of nudity arises out of the concept of ‘Purushartha’ (four ends of human life). ‘Purushartha’ ([[Puruṣārtha]]) are ‘Kama’ (enjoyment), ‘Artha’ (wealth), ‘Dharma’ (virtue) and ‘Moksha’ (liberation). It is ‘Purushartha’ which impels a human being towards nudity or any of its related aspect(s) either for spiritual aim or for the aim of enjoyment. Practice of ‘Dharma’ (virtue) brings good result(s) and non-practice of ‘Dharma’ leads to negative result(s).<ref>Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) pp.9 and 14-15</ref>

=====Spiritual basis=====
In the spiritual aspect of Hinduism nudity symbolizes renunciation ('tyaga' in Hindi) of the highest type. A nude person or deity (for example [[Kali]] is a nude deity) denotes one who is devoid of [[Maya (religion)|Maya]] or attachment to the body and one who is an embodiment of infinity.<ref>Pravrajika Vedantaprana, Saptahik Bartaman, Volume 28, Issue 23, Bartaman Private Ltd., 6, JBS Haldane Avenue, 700 105 (ed. 10 October 2015) p.16</ref> [[Trailanga Swami]], the famous nude saint of India, had given an explanation for nudity in religion in the following words, "Lahiri Mahasaya is like a divine kitten, remaining wherever the Cosmic Mother has placed him. While dutifully playing the part of a worldly man, he has received that perfect Self-realization which I have sought by renouncing everything – even my loincloth!"<ref>Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 31: An Interview with the Sacred Mother, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 288</ref>

=====Material basis=====
In comparison in the material aspect nudity is considered an art. This view is supported by Sri Aurobindo in his book ''The Renaissance in India''. He says about Hinduism in the book – "Its spiritual extremism could not prevent it from fathoming through a long era the life of the senses and its enjoyments, and there too it sought the utmost richness of sensuous detail and the depths and intensities of sensual experience. Yet it is notable that this pursuit of the most opposite extremes never resulted in disorder…"<ref>SRINVANTU Magazine, 63, College Street, Kolkata – 700 073(ed. 8 June 2018) pp.26 and 28 (Website: http://srinvantu.com/</ref>
Extreme hedonists and materialists like the [[Charvaka]]s are very candid with regard to pursuing of sensual pleasures. They say, "Marthakamaveva purusharthau" (Riches and pleasure is the summum bonum of life). ).<ref>Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 53</ref> There is another sloka in support of their view – "Anganalingananadijanyam sukhameva purusatha" (The sensual pleasure arising from the embrace of a woman and other objects is the highest good or end) ).<ref>Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 54</ref>
For non-hedonists pursuing [[kama]] (sensual pleasures) accompanied with [[dharma]] (virtue) can be the highest ideal or goal in life. There is nothing wrong in it. ).<ref>Sanyal, Jagdiswar, Guide to Indian Philosophy, Sribhumi Publishing Company, 79, Mahatma Gandi Road, Kolkata – 700 009 (ed. 1999) p. 15</ref>

====Occurrence====
Some of the famous nude male and female yogi (male and female saints of India) of Hinduism include Lalla Yogishwari ([[Lalleshwari]]),<ref>Yogananda, Paramhansa , Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 20: We Do Not Visit Kashmir, Jaico Publishing House, 127, Mahatma Gandhi Road Fort, Mumbai  - 400 023 (ed. 1997) p. 195</ref> Trailanga Swami, Harihar Baba, Tota Puri.<ref>Roy Sankarnath, Bharater Sadhak (Saints of India), 3 and 4, Hare Street, Kolkata – 700 001 (ed.  1980, Volume 7) pp. 187 and 251</ref> Also in the biography of saint Gorakhnath we have reference to  nude male and female yogis who had visited the famous Amarnath Temple during medieval period of India.<ref>Roy Sankarnath, Bharater Sadhak (Saints of India), 3 and 4, Hare Street, Kolkata – 700 001 (ed.  1980, Volume 7) p. 16</ref>

Among the Hindu religious sects, only the [[sadhu]]s (monks) of the [[Nāga]] sect can be seen nude.{{sfn|Crooke|1919}} They usually wear a loin-cloth around their waist, but not always; and usually remain in their [[Akhara]] or deep forest or isolation and come out in public only once every four years during [[Kumbh Mela]]. They have a very long history and are warrior monks, who usually also carry a ''[[talwar]]'' ([[sword]]), ''[[trishula|trishul]]'' ([[trident]]), ''bhala'' ([[javelin]]) or such weapons, and in medieval times have fought many wars to protect Hindu temples and shrines.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Siddharth|first1=Gautam|title=Nagas: Once were warriors|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/Nagas-Once-were-warriors/articleshow/18026313.cms|website=Times of India|publisher=Times Syndication Service|accessdate=26 December 2014}}</ref>

=== Jainism ===

In [[India]], [[Digambara monk]]s reject any form of clothing and practice nudity. Digambara (lit. 'sky clad') is one of the two main sects of [[Jainism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/subdivisions/subdivisions.shtml |title=Religion & Ethics - Jain sects |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref> However, the ''[[Śvētāmbara|Shwetambar]]'' sect is "white-clad" and their holy statues wear a loin cloth.{{sfn|Sharma| Sharma|2004|p=262}}

== New religious movements ==

[[File:Raëlian Women at the Seoul, Korea Love Hug Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|Raelians in [[South Korea]]]]

=== New Gymnosophy Society ===
The first English naturists adopted the name Gymnosophy as a thinly disguised euphemism for their pastime. The [[English Gymnosophical Society]] was formed in 1922 and became the [[New Gymnosophy Society]] in 1926; they purchased land at 'Bricketts Wood' to become Britain's first [[nudist colony]]. One of the first members was [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who in 1945 established the 'Five Acres Club' nearby, ostensibly as a nudist club, but as a front for [[Wicca]]ns, as [[witchcraft]] was illegal in England until 1951.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

=== Neopaganism ===

In many modern [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] [[religious movement]]s, such as [[Wicca]], social and ritual nudity is (relatively) commonplace. In Wicca, the term [[Skyclad (Neopaganism)|''skyclad'']] refers to ritual nudity instead of social nudity.{{sfn|Zimmermann|Gleason|2006|p=77}}

=== Raëlism ===

In [[Raëlism]], nudity is not problematic. Raëlists in North America have formed GoTopless.org, which organizes demonstrations in support of [[topfreedom]] on the basis of the legal and public attitudes to the gender inequality. GoTopless sponsors an annual "[[Go Topless Day]]" protest (also known as "National GoTopless Day", "International Go-Topless Day", etc.) in advocacy for women's right to go topless on gender equality grounds.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moye|first1=David|title=Take Off Your Shirt Everybody!
