{{For|religions sometimes described as "folk religions" or "ethnic religions"|Ethnic religion}}

In [[religious studies]] and [[folkloristics]], '''folk religion''', '''popular religion''', or '''vernacular religion''' comprises various forms and expressions of [[religion]] that are distinct from the official doctrines and practices of [[organized religion]]. The precise definition of folk religion varies among scholars. Sometimes also termed '''popular belief''', it consists of [[ethnic]] or regional [[religion|religious]] customs under the umbrella of a [[religion]], but outside official [[doctrine]] and practices.<ref name="Bowman">{{cite book |last=Bowman | first=Marion |editor-first=Steven| editor-last=Sutcliffe |title=Religion: empirical studies |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2004 |pages=3–4 |chapter=Chapter 1: Phenomenology, Fieldwork, and Folk Religion |isbn=978-0-7546-4158-2 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BU2BSj4dcHMC&q=%22folk+religion%22&pg=PA3}}</ref>

The term "folk religion" is generally held to encompass two related but separate subjects.  The first is the religious dimension of [[folk culture]], or the folk-cultural dimensions of religion. The second refers to the study of [[syncretism]]s between two cultures with different stages of formal expression, such as the melange of African folk beliefs and [[Roman Catholicism]] that led to the development of [[Vodun]] and [[Santería]], and similar mixtures of formal religions with folk cultures.

[[Chinese folk religion]], folk Christianity, folk Hinduism, and folk Islam are examples of folk religion associated with major religions. The term is also used, especially by the [[clergy]] of the faiths involved, to describe the desire of people who otherwise infrequently attend religious [[worship]], do not belong to a [[church body|church]] or similar religious society, and who have not made a formal profession of [[faith]] in a particular [[creed]], to have religious weddings or funerals, or (among Christians) to have their children [[baptism|baptised]].<ref name="Bowman"/>

==Definition==
In ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', [[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]] characterized "folk religion" as either "religion which occurs in small, local communities which does not adhere to the norms of large systems" or "the appropriation of religious beliefs and practices at a popular level."{{sfn|Bowker|2003}}

[[Don Yoder]] argued that there were five separate ways of defining folk religion.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} The first was a perspective rooted in a [[cultural evolution]]ary framework which understood folk religion as representing the survivals of older forms of religion; in this, it would constitute "the survivals, in an official religious context, of beliefs and behavior inherited from earlier stages of the culture's development".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} This definition would view folk religion in Catholic Europe as the survivals of pre-Christian religion and the folk religion in Protestant Europe as the survivals of Medieval Catholicism.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=12}} The second definition identified by Yoder was the view that folk religion represented the mixture of an official religion with forms of ethnic religion; this was employed to explain the place of folk religion in the syncretic belief systems of the Americas, where Christianity had blended with the religions of [[indigenous American]] and [[indigenous African|African]] communities.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=12&ndash;13}}

Yoder's third definition was that often employed within folkloristics, which held that folk religion was "the interaction of belief, ritual, custom, and mythology in traditional societies", representing that which was often pejoratively characterised as [[superstition]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=13}} The fourth definition provided by Yoder stated that folk religion represented the "folk interpretation and expression of religion". Noting that this definition would not encompass beliefs that were largely unconnected from organised religion, such as in [[witchcraft]], he therefore altered this definition by including the concept of "folk [[religiosity]]", thereby defining folk religion as "the deposit in culture of folk religiosity, the full range of folk attitudes to religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=13&ndash;14}} His fifth and final definition represented a "practical working definition" that combined elements from these various other definitions. Thus, he summarized folk religion as "the totality of all those views and practices of religion that exist among the people apart from and alongside the strictly theological and liturgical forms of the official religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=14}}

Yoder described "folk religion" as existing "in a complex society in relation to and in tension with the organized religion(s) of that society. Its relatively unorganized character differentiates it from organized religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=11}}

Alternately, the sociologist of religion [[Matthias Zic Varul]] defined "folk religion" as "the relatively un-reflected aspect of ordinary practices and beliefs that are oriented towards, or productive of, something beyond the immediate here-and-now: everyday transcendence".{{sfn|Varul|2015|p=449}}

===Historical development===

In Europe the study of "folk religion" emerged from the study of ''religiöse Volkskund'', a German term which was used in reference to "the religious dimension of folk-culture, or the folk-cultural dimension of religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=2}} This term was first employed by a German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] preacher, [[Paul Drews]], in a 1901 article that he published which was titled "''Religiöse Volkskunde, eine Aufgabe der praktischen Theologie''". This article was designed to be read by young Lutheran preachers leaving the seminary, to equip them for the popular variants of Lutheranism that they would encounter among their congregations and which would differ from the official, doctrinal Lutheranism that they had been accustomed to.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=2&ndash;3}} Although developing within a religious environment, the term came to be adopted by German academics in the field of [[folkloristics]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}} During the 1920s and 1930s, theoretical studies of ''religiöse Volkskund'' had been produced by the folklorists [[Josef Weigert]], [[Werner Boette]], and [[Max Rumpf]], all of whom had focused on religiosity within German peasant communities.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}} Over the coming decades, [[Georg Schreiber]] established an Institut für religiöse Volkskund in [[Munich]] while a similar department was established in [[Salzburg]] by [[Hanns Koren]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=3&ndash;4}} Other prominent academics involved in the study of the phenomenon were [[Heinrich Schauert]] and [[Rudolf Kriss]], the latter of whom collected one of the largest collections of folk-religious art and material culture in Europe, later housed in Munich's [[Bayerisches Nationalmuseum]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=3&ndash;4}} Throughout the 20th century, many studies were made of folk religion in Europe, paying particular attention to such subjects as [[pilgrimage]] and the use of [[shrines]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=3}}

In the Americas, the study of folk religion developed among [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] studying the syncretistic cultures of the Caribbean and Latin America.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} The pioneer in this field was [[Robert Redfield]], whose 1930 book ''Tepoztlán: A Mexican Village'' contrasted and examined the relationship between "folk religion" and "official religion" in a peasant community.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} Yoder later noted that although the earliest known usage of the term "folk religion" in the English language was unknown, it probably developed as a translation of the German ''Volksreligion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} One of the earliest prominent usages of the term was in the title of [[Joshua Trachtenberg]]'s 1939 work ''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} The term also gained increasing usage within the academic field of [[comparative religion]], appearing in the titles of [[Ichiro Hori]]'s ''Folk Religion in Japan'', [[Martin Nilsson]]'s ''Greek Folk Religion'', and [[Charles Miller Leslie|Charles Leslie]]'s reader, the ''Anthropology of Folk Religion''.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}} Courses on the study of folk religion came to be taught at various universities in the United States, such as [[John Messenger]]'s at [[Indiana University]] and [[Don Yoder]]'s at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=5}}
Although the subject of folk religion fell within the remit of scholars operating in both folkloristics and religious studies, by 1974 Yoder noted that U.S.-based academics in the latter continued to largely ignore it, instead focusing on the study of [[theology]] and institutionalised religion; he contrasted this with the situation in Europe, where historians of religion had devoted much time to studying folk religiosity.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=6}} He also lamented that many U.S.-based folklorists also neglected the subject of religion because it did not fit within the standard genre-based system for cataloguing folklore.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=9}}

The term "folk religion" came to be increasingly rejected in the 1990s and 2000s by scholars seeking more precise terminology.{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|p=4}}

===Problems and critique===

Yoder noted that one problem with the use of the term "folk religion" was that it did not fit into the work of those scholars who used the term "religion" in reference solely to [[organized religion]].{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}} He highlighted the example of the prominent sociologist of religion [[Émile Durkheim]], who insisted that "religion" was organized in order to contrast it with "[[magic (paranormal)|magic]]".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}} Yoder noted that scholars adopting these perspectives often preferred the term "folk belief" over "folk religion".{{sfn|Yoder|1974|p=10}}

A second problem with the use of "folk religion" that Yoder highlighted was that some scholars, particularly those operating in the [[sociology of religion]], used the term as a synonym for [[ethnic religion]] (which is alternately known as national religion or tribal religion), meaning a religion closely tied to a particular ethnic or national group and is thus contrasted with a "universal religion" which cuts across ethnic and national boundaries.{{sfn|Yoder|1974|pp=10&ndash;11}} Among the scholars to have adopted this use of terminology are E. Wilbur Bock.{{sfn|Bock|1966|p=204}}

The folklorist Leonard Norman Primiano argued that the use of "folk religion", as well as related terms like "popular religion" and "unofficial religion", by scholars, does "an extreme disservice" to the forms of religiosity that scholarship is examining, because &ndash; in his opinion &ndash; such terms are "residualistic, [and] derogatory".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=38}} He argued that using such terminology implies that there is "a pure element" to religion "which is in some way transformed, even contaminated, by its exposure to human communities".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=39}} As a corrective, he suggested that scholars use "vernacular religion" as an alternative.{{sfn|Primiano|1995|pp=41&ndash;42}} Defining this term, Primiano stated that "vernacular religion" is, "by definition, religion as it is lived: as human beings encounter, understand, interpret, and practice it. Since religion inherently involves interpretation, it is impossible for the religion of an individual not to be vernacular".{{sfn|Primiano|1995|p=44}}

Kapaló was critical of this approach, deeming it "mistaken" and arguing that switching from "folk religion" to "vernacular religion" results in the scholar "picking up a different selection of things from the world".{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|p=9}} He cautioned that both terms carried an "ideological and semantic load" and warned scholars to pay attention to the associations that each word had.{{sfn|Kapaló|2013|pp=15&ndash;16}}

==Chinese folk religion==
[[Chinese folk religion]] is one of the labels used to describe the collection of [[ethnic religion|ethnic religious]] traditions which have historically comprised the predominant belief system in [[China]] and among [[Han Chinese]] ethnic groups up to the present day. [[Chinese mythology]] includes the worship of ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]'' ([[spirit]], [[Deity|god]], [[awareness]], [[consciousness]]) which can be [[nature god|nature deities]], [[Taizu (disambiguation)|Taizu]] or clan deities, [[city god]]s, [[national god|national deities]], [[culture hero]]es and [[demigod]]s, [[Chinese dragon|dragons]] and [[veneration of the dead|ancestors]].

Chinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with [[Taoism]], since over the centuries institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administrate local religions. More accurately, Taoism emerged from and overlaps with folk religion and [[Chinese philosophy]]. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous.  With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population,<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Religion | year = 2011 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica| title-link = Encyclopædia Britannica }}.</ref> Chinese folk religion is one of the [[major religious groups|major religious traditions in the world]].

==Indigenous Philippine folk religions==
{{main|Indigenous Philippine folk religions}}
Indigenous Philippine folk religions are the distinct native religions of various ethnic groups in the Philippines, where most follow belief systems in line with [[animism]]. Generally, these indigenous folk religions are referred to as ''Anitism'' or ''Bathalism''.<ref name="Almocera2005">Almocera, Ruel A., (2005) Popular Filipino Spiritual Beliefs with a proposed Theological Response. in Doing Theology in the Philippines. Suk, John., Ed. Mandaluyong: OMF Literature Inc. Pp 78-98</ref> Some of these beliefs stem from pre-Christian religions that were especially influenced by [[Hinduism]] and were regarded by the Spanish as "myths" and "superstitions" in an effort to de-legitimize legitimate precolonial beliefs by forcefully replacing those native beliefs with colonial Catholic Christian myths and superstitions. Today, some of these precolonial beliefs are still held by Filipinos, especially in the provinces.

==Folk Islam==

==Folk Judaism==
In one of the first major academic works on the subject, titled ''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion'', Joshua Trachtenberg provided a definition of Jewish folk religion as consisting of ideas and practices that whilst not meeting with the approval of religious leaders enjoyed wide popularity such that they must be included in what he termed the field of religion.<ref>''Jewish Magic and Superstition: A Study in Folk Religion'', Joshua Trachtenberg, 1939, Forgotten Books, Preface, pg xxvii</ref> This included unorthodox beliefs about demons and angels, and magical practices.

Later studies have emphasized the significance of the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] to the many Jewish folk customs linked to mourning and in particular to the belief in ''hibbut ha-qever''  (torture of the grave) a belief that the dead are tortured in their grave for three days after burial by demons until they remember their names. This idea began with early eschatalogical [[aggadah]] and was then further developed by the kabbalists.<ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion'', Edited by Adele Berlin,  Oxford University Press, 2011, pg 344,</ref>
 
Raphael Patai has been acknowledged as one of the first to utilize anthropology to study Jewish folk religion.<ref>''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'',
by Victor D. Sanua, pg 28</ref> In particular he has drawn attention to the important role of the female divine element,<ref>''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'', by Victor D. Sanua, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1983, pg 27</ref> which he sees in the goddess [[Asherah]], the [[Shekhinah]], the [[Matronit]], and [[Lilith]].<ref>''Fields of Offerings: Studies in Honor of Raphael Patai'', by Victor D. Sanua, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1983, pg 2</ref>
 
Writer Stephen Sharot has stated that Jewish popular religion in common with other forms of folk religion, has a focus on the [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]], or [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]], i.e. it is used to assist in protecting the individual from sickness, and misfortune.  He emphasizes that while Rabbinical Judaism dealt with orthodox Jewish ritual, and [[halakah]], magicians claimed to use unorthodox magical rituals to help people in everyday life.  He points to the example of a relatively professionalised type of magician being the [[Baal Shem|ba'al shem]] of Poland, who beginning in the 16th century thrived with the popularity of practical kabbalah in the 18th century.  These ba'al shem promised to use their knowledge of the names of god, and the angels, along with exorcism, chiromancy, and [[herbal medicine]] to bring harm to enemies, and  success in areas of social life such as marriage, and childbirth.<ref>''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities'', By Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 58</ref>

[[Charles Liebman]] has written that the essence of the folk religion of [[American Jews]] is their social ties to one another, illustrated by the finding  that religious practices that would prevent social integration -such as a strict interpretation of  dietary laws and the Sabbath- have been abandoned, whilst the practices that are followed -such as the [[Passover seder]], social rites of passage, and the High Holy Days- are ones that strengthen Jewish family and community integration.<ref>''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities'', By Stephen Sharot, Wayne State University Press, 2011, pg 152</ref> Liebman described the rituals and beliefs of contemporary Jewish folk religion in his works, ''The Ambivalent American Jew'' (1973) and ''American Jewry: Identity and Affiliation''.

==Folk Hinduism==
McDaniel (2007) classifies [[Hinduism]] into six major kinds and numerous minor kinds, in order to understand expression of emotions among the Hindus.<ref name=junemcdaniel6>June McDaniel "Hinduism", in John Corrigan, ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Emotion'', (2007) Oxford University Press, 544 pages, pp. 52–53 {{ISBN|0-19-517021-0}}</ref> The major kinds, according to McDaniel are, Folk Hinduism, based on local traditions and cults of local [[deities]] and is the oldest, non-literate system.<ref name=junemcdaniel6/> Folk Hinduism involves worship of deities which are not found in Hindu scriptures. It involves worship of [[Gramadevata]] (village deity), [[Kuldevta]] (household deity) and local deities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sociology.iresearchnet.com/sociology-of-religion/folk-hinduism/|title=Folk Hinduism|website=sociology.iresearchnet}}</ref> It is folk religion or tribal religion, polytheist, sometimes animistic religion based on locality, community, form of worship with countless local texts in local language. In most cases these religions have their own priest, most worship only regional deities (in villages or among a subcaste- Kuldevta, Gramadevata) whose myth of origin linked to place of worship or their own pantheon which also includes spirits or deified heroes. Human can often be possessed by these gods or spirits. From the perspectives of Brahmanic or Sanskritic Hinduism, the form of worship are considered impure in many cases, so the folk religion is quite often tension with the Brahmanic Hinduism. In the so-called folk Hinduism, folk form of Brahmanic-Sanskritic Hinduism are usually combined with aspects of folk religion.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jID3TuoiOMQC&pg=PA22|title=Hinduism: Past and Present|website=books.google|isbn=0691089523|last1=Michaels|first1=Axel|year=2004}}</ref>

==In sociology==
In [[sociology]], folk religion is often contrasted with [[elite religion]]. Folk religion is defined as the beliefs, practices, rituals and symbols originating from sources other than the religion's leadership. Folk religion in many instances is tolerated by the religion's leadership, although they may consider it an error.<ref>Leibman, Charles. "The Religion of the American Jew". ''The Ambivalent American Jew''. Jewish Publication Society. 1975.</ref> A similar concept is [[lived religion]], the study of religion as practiced by believers.
