==In religion and mysticism==
[[File:Sant'Alfonso Liguori.jpg|thumb|right|Several religious figures have historically claimed to have bilocated. In 1774, [[Alphonsus Liguori]] claimed to have gone into a trance while preparing for Mass. When he came out of the trance he said that he had visited the bedside of the dying [[Pope Clement XIV]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}]]

Several [[Christian saint]]s, [[monk]]s and [[Muslim]] [[Sufi]]s are said to have exhibited bilocation. Among the earliest is the apparition of [[Our Lady of the Pillar]] in the year 40. [[Isidore the Farmer]] claimed to be praying or attending Mass in Church while at the same time plowing in the fields.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Other Christian figures said to have experienced bilocation include [[Alphonsus Liguori]], [[Anthony of Padua]], [[Ursula Micaela Morata]], [[Gerard Majella]], [[Charles of Mount Argus]], [[Pio of Pietrelcina]],<ref>{{Cite journal| last= Day| first= Malcolm| title= Blood brother: Padre Pio| url= http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/228/blood_brother_padre_pio.html| journal= Fortean Times| date= September 2002| url-status= dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090203170134/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/228/blood_brother_padre_pio.html| archive-date= 2009-02-03}}</ref> [[Severus of Ravenna]], [[Ambrose]], [[María de Ágreda]],<ref>This holy virgin burned with a most ardent love for God and for the salvation of souls. One day, she beheld in a vision all the nations of the world. She saw the greater part of men were deprived of God's grace, and running headlong to everlasting perdition. She saw how the Indians of Mexico put fewer obstacles to the grace of conversion than any other nation who were out of the Catholic Church, and how God, on this account, was ready to show mercy to them. Hence she redoubled her prayers and penances to obtain for them the grace of conversion. God heard her prayers. He commanded her to teach the Catholic religion to those Mexican Indians. From that time, she appeared, by way of '''bilocation''', to the savages, not less than five hundred times, instructing them in all the truths of our holy religion, and performing miracles in confirmation of these truths. When all were converted to the faith, she told them that religious priests would be sent by God to receive them into the Church by baptism. As she had told, so it happened. God, in his mercy, sent to these good Indians several Franciscan fathers, who were greatly astonished when they found those savages fully instructed in the Catholic doctrine. When they asked the Indians who had instructed them, they were told that a holy virgin appeared among them many times, and taught them the Catholic religion and confirmed it by miracles. (Life of the Venerable Mary of Jesus of Agreda, § xii.) Thus those good Indians were brought miraculously to the knowledge of the true religion in the Catholic Church,'' because they followed their conscience in observing the natural law''. Muller, Michael.

==Witchcraft==
In the 17th century, persons accused of witchcraft were reported to appear in dreams and visions of witnesses. The trials at [[Bury St. Edmunds witch trials|Bury St. Edmunds]] and [[Salem witch trials|Salem]] included this "[[spectral evidence]]" against defendants. [[Matthew Hopkins]] described the phenomenon in his book ''The Discovery of Witches''.

==Modern==

The English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] was reported by acquaintances to have the ability, even though he said he was not conscious of its happening at the time.<ref>Booth, Martin (2000) "A Magick Life: Biography of Aleister Crowley", Hodder & Stoughton Ltd, {{ISBN|0-340-71805-6}}</ref>

Bilocation figures heavily in [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997) and  [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[Against the Day]]'' (2006). Bilocation also plays a part in the Christopher Priest novel ''The Prestige''. Additionally, the phenomenon is explored in an episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'', "[[Fight Club (The X-Files)|Fight Club]]", and several season two episodes of ''[[Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond]]'', including "Dead Ringer".

A mystical story that involved Soviet author [[Yevgeny Petrov (writer)|Yevgeny Petrov]] served as inspiration for the film ''[[Envelope (film)|Envelope]]'' (2012) starring [[Kevin Spacey]].

==Skepticism==

Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has written that there is no scientific evidence that bilocation is a real phenomenon and that cases are often from anecdotal reports that cannot be verified. Nickell listed self-[[delusion]], [[hoax]]ing and [[illusion]] to explain alleged cases of bilocation.<ref name="Nickell 1993"/>
