===Proclamation===

[[File:Baba-1940's.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sai Baba at the age of 14, soon after proclaiming he was the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba]]
On 8 March 1940, while living with his elder brother Seshama Raju in [[Uravakonda]], a small town near Puttaparthi, 14 year old Sathya was apparently stung by a scorpion.<ref name="AlexandraKent"/> He lost consciousness for several hours<ref name="kent"/> and in the next few days underwent a noticeable change in behaviour. There were "symptoms of laughing and weeping, eloquence and silence." It is claimed that then "he began to sing [[Sanskrit]] verses, a language of which it is alleged he had no prior knowledge."<ref name="RichardWeiss"/> Doctors concluded his behaviour to be [[hysteria]].<ref name="RichardWeiss"/> Concerned, his parents brought Sathya back home to Puttaparthi and took him to many priests, doctors and exorcists. One of the exorcists at [[Kadiri]], a town near Puttaparthi, went to the extent of torturing him with the aim of curing him; Sathya seemingly kept calm throughout the torture.

On 23 May 1940, Sathya called household members and reportedly materialised sugar candy (''[[prasad]])'' and flowers for them. His father became furious at seeing this, thinking his son was [[Spirit possession|bewitched]]. He took a stick and threatened to beat him if Sathya did not reveal who he really was, the young Sathya responded calmly and firmly "I am Sai Baba", a reference to [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]].<ref name="RichardWeiss"/><ref name="kent"/> This was the first time he proclaimed himself to be the reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi—a saint who became famous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in [[Maharashtra]] and had died eight years before Sathya was born.<ref name="RichardWeiss"/>

===First mandir and development of Puttaparthi===

In 1944, a [[mandir]] for Sai Baba's devotees was built near the village of [[Puttaparthi]]. It is now referred to as the "old mandir".<ref name="bowen">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fJwQAAAACAAJ|title=The Sathya Sai Baba Community in Bradford: Its Origin and Development, Religious Beliefs and Practices|last=Bowen|first=David|date=1988|publisher=Department of Theology and Religious Studies, University of Leeds|isbn=9781871363029|language=en}}</ref> The construction of [[Prashanthi Nilayam]], the current ashram, began in 1948 and was completed in 1950.<ref name="BabbLawrence"/><ref name="bowen"/> In 1954, Sai Baba established a small free general hospital in the village of Puttaparthi.<ref name="TheHinduNewspaper">{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/features/saibaba/stories/2005112300270300.htm |title=Sri Sathya Sai 80th year of Advent |newspaper=The Hindu |date=23 November 2005|access-date=10 January 2010|location=Chennai, India}}</ref> He won fame for his reputed mystical powers and ability to heal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/24/sri-sathya-sai-baba-dies|title=Sai Baba, spiritual guru to millions, dies at 85|author=Jason Burke|newspaper=the Guardian|date=24 April 2011}}</ref> In 1957 Sai Baba went on a North Indian temple tour.<ref name="Eade"/>

===Stroke, prediction of reincarnation and sole foreign tour===

In 1963, it was asserted that Sai Baba suffered a stroke and four severe heart attacks, which left him paralysed on one side. These events culminated in an event where he apparently healed himself in front of the thousands of people gathered in Prashanthi Nilayam who were then praying for his recovery.<ref name="BabbLawrence"/>

On recovering, Sai Baba announced that he would one day next be reborn as an incarnation named ''Prema Sai Baba'' in the neighbouring state of [[Karnataka]].<ref name="BabbLawrence"/> He stated, "I am Shiva-Sakthi, born in the [[gotra]] (lineage) of [[Bharadwaja]], according to a boon won by that sage from [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Shakti|Sakthi]]. Siva was born in the gotra of that sage as Sai Baba of Shirdi; Shiva and Sakthi have incarnated as Myself in his gotra now; Sakthi alone will incarnate as the third Sai (Prema Sai Baba) in the same gotra in [[Mandya]] district of Karnataka State."<ref name="BabbLawrence"/> He stated he would be born again eight years after his death at the age of 96, but died at the age of 84.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13180011 | work=BBC News | title=Satya Sai Baba, Indian guru, dies at 84 | date=24 April 2011}}</ref>

On 29 June 1968, Sai Baba made his only overseas trip, to [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]].

===Later years===

In 1968, he established Dharmakshetra or the Sathyam Mandir in [[Mumbai]]. In 1973, he established the Shivam Mandir in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]]. On 19 January 1981, in [[Chennai]], he inaugurated the Sundaram Mandir.

In a [[1993 Murders in Prashanthi Nilayam|1993 incident]], four intruders armed with knives entered his bedroom, either as an assassination attempt or as part of a power struggle between his followers. Sai Baba was unharmed. During the scuffle and the police response, the intruders and two of Sai Baba's attendants were killed. The official investigation left questions unanswered.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/who-is-sri-sathya-sai-baba-101102|title=Who is Sri Sathya Sai Baba?|agency=Press Trust of India|date=24 April 2011|publisher=[[NDTV]]|access-date=25 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/religion-obituaries/8471342/Sathya-Sai-Baba.html |title=Religion Obituaries; Satya Sai Baba |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=24 April 2011 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_sathya-sai-baba-escaped-murder-attempt_1535839 |title=Sathya Sai Baba escaped murder attempt|date=25 April 2011|last=Madhusoodan|first=M K |work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]}}</ref>

In March 1995, Sai Baba started a project to provide drinking water to 1.2&nbsp;million people in the drought-prone Rayalaseema region in the [[Anantapur district]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/water-projects-cm-all-praise-for-satya-sai-trust/article27563258.ece|title=Water projects: CM all praise for Satya Sai Trust|last=Reporter|first=Staff|date=13 February 2004|work=The Hindu|access-date=9 October 2019|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> In April 1999 he inaugurated the Ananda Nilayam Mandir in [[Madurai]], Tamil Nadu.

In 2001 he established another free super-speciality hospital in [[Bangalore]] to benefit the poor.

===Old age, illness and death===

In 2003, Sai Baba suffered a fractured hip when a student standing on an iron stool slipped and the boy and stool both fell on him. After that he gave [[darshana]] from a car or his porte chair.<ref name="ibnlive.in.com82-2">{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/sai-baba-turns-82-is-still-going-strong/52860-3.html?from=search-relatedstories|title=Sai Baba turns 82, is still going strong|last=Balakrishnan|first=Deepa|date=23 November 2007|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|access-date=6 January 2010}}</ref> After 2004, Sai Baba used a wheelchair and began to make fewer public appearances.

On 28 March 2011, Sai Baba was admitted to the [[Sri Sathya Sai Super Speciality Hospital]] at Prashantigram at Puttaparthi, following respiration-related problems.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Sai Baba in stable condition: Hospital| newspaper = [[Hindustan Times]]| date = 5 April 2011| url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sai-Baba-in-stable-condition-Hospital/Article1-681433.aspx| access-date = 24 April 2011| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110509014742/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sai-Baba-in-stable-condition-Hospital/Article1-681433.aspx| archive-date = 9 May 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = Baba's health condition 'stable' | newspaper = [[The Times of India]] | date = 6 April 2011 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-06/hyderabad/29388337_1_vital-parameters-condition-crrt | access-date = 24 April 2011}}</ref> After nearly a month of hospitalisation, during which his condition progressively deteriorated, Sai Baba died on Sunday, 24 April at 7:40 IST, aged 84.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Spiritual leader Sathya Sai Baba passes away | newspaper = [[The Times of India]] | date = 24 April 2011 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-24/india/29468573_1_sai-baba-sathya-sai-central-trust-puttaparthi   | access-date = 24 April 2011}}</ref>

Sai Baba had predicted that he would die at age 96 and would remain healthy until then.<ref>{{cite book|title=Redemptive Encounters: Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition|last=Babb|first=Lawrence A.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0-520-07636-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/redemptiveencoun0000babb/page/166 166]|quote=His present incarnation, he says, ...

However it was soon  clearly shown that the lunar reckoning does not work.  Post.

Prasad, Malayalam Daily. Kerala, India: 25 April 2011. "What Baba has foretold was indeed correct. According to the Roman calendar he has completed 85 years. But one can note that generally in all of Baba's discourses Baba had been referring to the star (lunar) basis in calculations. In Indian astrology there are 27 stars in a month starting with Aswathy and ending with Revathy. Accordingly a year of 12 months is composed of 324 days. Sai Baba was born on 23 November 1925. From that day till his death day 24 April 2011 there were a total of 33,899 days. If this is divided with 324, we get 95 years and 54 days. Accordingly, under the star basis of calculation he was in his 96th year having completed 54 days when he left his physical body."</ref> Other devotees have spoken of his anticipated [[resurrection]], [[reincarnation]] or [[wakefulness|awakening]].<ref>''The Hindustan Times'', New Delhi: 25 April 2011.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Narayan |first1=Sreejith |title=Sai, Thy Kingdom Come | year = 2012| isbn = 978-1-62314-842-3 | url =http://www.saikingdom.com}}</ref>

Followers believed in seeking the spiritual benefit of Sai Baba's ''[[darsana|darshan]]'', scheduled for morning and afternoon each day. Sai Baba would interact with people, accept letters, materialise and distribute [[vibhuti]] (sacred ash) or call groups or individuals for interviews. Devotees considered it a great privilege to have an interview and sometimes a single person, group or family was invited for a private interview for answers to spiritual questions and general guidance.<ref name="kent"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/emeralds-desperation-mother-sathya-sai-baba-200301081601873.html|title=Emeralds and desperation: My mother and Sathya Sai Baba|last=Neutill|first=Rani|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>

In 1972 [[Abraham Kovoor]] made the first public criticism of Sai Baba<ref name="srisathyasaibabaandthepress">Ruhela S.P., ''Sri Sathya Sai Baba and the Press'', pp. 1–5, 1997 {{ISBN|81-7533-041-4}}</ref> when he looked into a claim publicly narrated by one devotee<ref name="srisathyasaibabaandthepress" /> that Sai Baba had created a new model of a [[Seiko]] watch, and found the claim to be untrue.<ref name="sathyasaibabasgrace">Ruhela S.P., ''How to Receive Sri Sathya Sai Baba's Grace'', pp. 277, 2006 {{ISBN|81-7182-089-1}}</ref><ref name=OutlookSingh>{{cite web|title=The Spell Breaker|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?262445|publisher=Outlook|access-date=16 October 2013|author=Rahul Singh|date=2 November 2009}}</ref>

In April 1976, [[Hosur Narasimhaiah|Hossur Narasimhaiah]], a physicist, rationalist and then vice-chancellor of [[Bangalore University]], founded and chaired a committee "to rationally and scientifically investigate miracles and other verifiable superstitions". Narasimhaiah wrote Sai Baba three widely publicised letters challenging him to perform his miracles under controlled conditions. The letters were ignored.<ref name="haraldsson204">Haraldson, ''op. cit'', pp&nbsp;204–205</ref> Sai Baba said that he ignored Narasimhaiah's challenge because he felt that a scientific approach to spiritual issues was improper, adding that "Science must confine its inquiry only to things belonging to the human senses, while spiritualism transcends the senses. If you want to understand the nature of spiritual power you can do so only through the path of spirituality and not science. What science has been able to unravel is merely a fraction of the cosmic phenomena&nbsp;..."<ref name="blitz">Interview given by Sai Baba to [[R. K. Karanjia]] of ''Blitz'' news magazine in September 1976 [http://www.saibaba.ws/articles/interviewwithjournalistsept1976.htm Available online]</ref> Narasimhaiah's committee was dissolved in August 1977. Narasimhaiah held the fact that Sai Baba ignored his letters to be an indication that his miracles were fraudulent.<ref>Haraldsson, pp 209</ref> As a result of this episode, a public debate raged for several months in Indian newspapers.<ref>Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp. 206</ref>

Indian rationalist [[Basava Premanand]], who began campaigning against Sai Baba in 1976, unsuccessfully attempted to sue him in 1986 for violations of the [[Gold Control Act]], citing Sai Baba's purported materialisations of gold objects. When the case was dismissed, Premanand unsuccessfully appealed on the grounds that claimed spiritual power is not a defence recognised in law.<ref name=bbca1>{{cite news|author=Tanya Datta|title=Sai Baba: Goan or con man?|date=17 June 2004|work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3813469.stm | access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref>

A 1995 TV documentary ''Guru Busters'', produced by filmmaker [[Robert Eagle (writer and director)|Robert Eagle]] for the UK's [[Channel 4]], accused Sai Baba of faking his materialisations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eagletv.co.uk/projects/guru-busters.html |title=Eagle & Eagle |publisher=Eagletv.co.uk |access-date=7 January 2010}} [https://vimeo.com/352879776 Doordarshan clip]</ref> The clip from the film was mentioned in the ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'', on 23 November 1992, in a front-page headline "DD Tape Unveils Baba Magic".<ref>Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp.&nbsp;295–301</ref>

===Allegations of  abuse===
In January 2002, a documentary produced by Denmark's national television and radio broadcast company, [[Danish radio|Danmarks Radio]] (DR), called ''Seduced By Sai Baba'', analysed videos of public manifestations of Sai Baba and suggested that they could be explained as [[sleight of hand]].<ref name="seduced">{{cite video|people=Øyvind Kyrø, Steen Jensen |title=Seduced by Sai Baba |medium=Documentary |publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] |date=2002 |url=http://dr.dk/Salg/DRsales/Programmes/Documentary/Society_and_Social/20070629133445_3_1_3_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204010039/http://www.dr.dk/Salg/DRsales/Programmes/Documentary/Society_and_Social/20070629133445_3_1_3_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.htm |archive-date=4 February 2010 }}</ref> The documentary also presented interviews with Alaya Rahm, former devotee of Sathya Sai Baba, where he alleged abuse by Sathya Sai Baba.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/> As a result, in 2002 the parliament of the United Kingdom discussed the  danger to male children of British families intending to visit the ashram of Sathya Sai Baba in case of individual audiences with the guru.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2001-02/886] UK Parliament official web site</ref>

In 2004, the [[BBC]] produced a documentary titled ''The Secret Swami'' as part of its series "The World Uncovered".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3791921.stm |title=Programmes &#124; This World &#124; Secret Swami |work=BBC News |date=11 June 2004 |access-date=7 January 2010}}</ref> One central theme of the BBC documentary was again Alaya Rahm's sexual abuse allegations against Sathya Sai Baba.<ref name=bbcd>{{cite video|people=Eamon Hardy, Tanya Datta|title=Secret Swami|medium=Documentary|publisher=BBC News|date=2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3791921.stm | access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref> This documentary interviewed him together with Mark Roche, who had spent 25 years of his life since 1969 in the movement and alleged abuse by Sai Baba.<ref name=bbcd/> The show also featured allegations from Sai Baba critic Basava Premanand.

===Responses===
Sathya Sai Baba and his followers reject any allegations of misconduct.<ref name=funeral/> Devotee [[Bill Aitken (traveller)|Bill Aitken]] was quoted by ''[[The Week]]'' as saying that Sathya Sai Baba's reputation had not been harmed by the negative stories published about him. He said that the more detractors railed against Sathya Sai Baba, the more new devotees went to see him.<ref>Aitken, Bill (27 November 2005),{{cite web|url=http://www.the-week.com/25nov27/currentevents_article10.htm |title=Miracle of Welfare |access-date=9 September 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909111636/http://www.the-week.com/25nov27/currentevents_article10.htm |archive-date=9 September 2006  }}</ref>

In the article ''Divine Downfall'', published in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Anil Kumar, the ex-principal of the Sathya Sai Educational Institute, said that he believed that the controversy was part of Sathya Sai Baba's divine plan and that all great religious teachers had to face criticism during their lives. Anil Kumar also said that allegations had been levelled at Sathya Sai Baba since childhood, but with every criticism he had become more and more triumphant.<ref name="divine">Brown, Mick (28 October 2000).

In the book ''Redemptive Encounters: Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition'', Lawrence A. Babb wrote of Sathya Sai Baba, "Whoever he is, he is certainly more than the mere parlour magician many of his critics claim that he is."<ref name="BabbLawrence"/>

Sathya Sai Baba publicly responded to the allegations on 25 December 2000:
{{quote|Some people out of their mean-mindedness are trying to tarnish the image of Sai Baba. I am not after name and fame. So, I do not lose anything by their false allegations. My glory will go on increasing day by day. It will never diminish even a bit if they were to publicise their false allegations in the whole world in bold letters. Some devotees seem to be perturbed over these false statements. They are not true devotees at all. Having known the mighty power of Sai, why should they be afraid of the 'cawing of crows'? One should not get carried away by all that is written on walls, said in political meetings or the vulgar tales carried by the print media.<ref>Sathya Sai Speaks Vol.33, pg.389</ref>}}

''[[The Times of India]]'' on 26 December 2000 quoted Sathya Sai Baba as saying: {{quote|[[Jesus Christ]] underwent many hardships, and was put to the cross because of jealousy. Many around him could not bear the good work he did and the large number of followers he gathered. One of his disciples, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], betrayed him. In those days there was one Judas, but today there are thousands. Just as that Judas was tempted to betray Jesus, the Judases of today, too, are bought out to lie. Jealousy was the motive behind the allegations levelled at him.<ref>Rao, Manu (26 December 2000), Sai Baba lashes out at detractors http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore/sai-baba-lashes-out-at-detractors/articleshow/534425761.cms</ref>}}

In an official letter made public in December 2001, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] (then [[Prime Minister of India]] and a devotee of Sai Baba),<ref name=Palmer97-98 /> [[P. N. Bhagwati|P.N.
