[[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼís]] venerate [[Muhammad]] as one of a number of prophets or "[[Manifestation of God (Baháʼí Faith)|Manifestations of God]]", but consider his teachings (as with the teachings of [[Jesus]] and [[Moses]]) to have been superseded by those of [[Baháʼu'lláh]], the founder of the [[Baháʼí Faith]].<ref name="Smith">{{cite book |last= Smith |first= Peter |title= A concise encyclopedia of the Baháʼí Faith  |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |page = 251}}</ref>

== Muhammad in the Baháʼí Faith ==

Baháʼís believe in Muhammad as a prophet of [[God in the Baháʼí Faith|God]], and in the [[Qurʼan]] as the word of God. Baha'i teachings 'affirm that Islam is a true religion revealed by Allah'; accordingly, members of the faith can give full assent to the traditional words of the [[Shahada]]h.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Islam and the Baha'i Faith|last = Momen|first = Moojan|publisher = George Ronald Pub Ltd|year = 2000|isbn = 9780853984467|location = Oxford|pages = 10}}</ref> Muhammad is taken to be one of the most important messengers of God as an "independent" manifestation of God. Furthermore, Baháʼís believe that [[Báb|the Báb]], a central figure in the Baháʼí Faith, was a descendant of Muhammad through [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Husayn]],<ref name=lambden1991>{{cite journal | author= Lambden, Stephen | title =Islam, Muhammad, and the Qurʼan: Some Introductory Notes | journal =Baháʼí Studies Review | volume =1 | issue =1 | publisher = Association for Baha'i Studies English-Speaking Europe | location =London, UK | date =1991 | url =http://bahai-library.com/lambden_islam_muhammad_quran | access-date = Dec 15, 2015 }}</ref> whose coming was foretold by Muhammad. [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]], the son and successor of Baháʼu'lláh, wrote that 'His Holiness the Prophet Muhammad made a covenant concerning His Holiness the Báb and the Báb was the One promised by Muhammad, for Muhammad gave the tidings of His coming.ʼ<ref>{{cite book |last = Terry |first = Peter |year = 2008 |title = Proofs of the Prophets  |publisher = Lulu Press |isbn = 978-1435713468 |pages = 22 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UYLRAQAAQBAJ }}</ref>

In the [[Baháʼí literature|Baháʼí writings]] Muhammad is known by the titles the "Apostle of God", the "Seal of the Prophets" and the "Day-Star of Truth".<ref name=JBS5-3>{{cite journal |author1=  Fazel, Seena |author2= Fananapazir, Khazeh | title =A Baháʼí Approach to the Claim of Finality in Islam | journal = Journal of Baháʼí Studies | volume =5 | issue =3 | pages =17–40 | publisher =Association for Baha'i Studies North America | date =1993 | url =http://bahai-library.com/fananapazir_fazel_finality_islam

He was nevertheless responsible for producing 'a book in which, in a perfect and eloquent style, He explained the divine attributes and perfections, the prophethood of the Messengers of God, the divine laws, and some scientific facts.ʼ{{sfn|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá|2015|pp=27 (7.11)}} Abdu'l-Baha believed that one of the proofs that the Qurʼan is a product of the divine are the facts about the workings of nature contained therein, facts which he believed were not known in Muhammad's own time. He claimed, for example, that Sura 36 of the Qurʼan depicts a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] understanding of the solar system.

In the Baháʼí Faith Muhammad is regarded as one of the class of 'independent Prophets' – that is, those prophets 'who are followed' and who 'establish a new religion and make new creatures of men'. They also 'change the general morals, promote new customs and rules, [and] renew the cycle and the law.'{{sfn|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá|2015|pp=187 (43.2–3)}} Along with Muhammad, [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], [[Báb|the Báb]] and [[Baháʼu'lláh]] are classed among the 'independent Prophets'. The religion teaches the unity and the oneness of all the prophets of God. As such, Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ, Muhammad, the Báb and Baháʼu'lláh are believed to have proclaimed the same message at different times. It is only due to the 'difference in their station and mission' that their 'words and utterances' ever 'appear to diverge and differ.'{{sfn|Baháʼu'lláh|2003|pp=177 (§ 192)}} As with all the Prophets of God, Baháʼís believe that Muhammad was sinless. Being Holy, prophets are believed to be pure from sin and purged of faults. In response to Sura 48:2 of the Qurʼan which, referring to Muhammad, states that God forgives his past and future sins, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá states that this address was 'in reality for all the people' and is only 'apparently directed to Muhammad'.{{sfn|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá|2015|pp=194 (44.11)}}

The Baháʼí Faith teaches that Muhammad was a man of peace. On the occasions when he did fight, he only did so in order to defend himself and his followers from the hostile pagan [[Quraysh|Arab tribes]] who inhabited the [[Arabian Peninsula]] in his time.{{sfn|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá|2015|pp=24 (7.7)}} ʻAbdu'l-Bahá claimed that 'Muhammad never fought against the Christians',{{sfn|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá|2015|pp=26 (7.9)}} though this ignores the [[Battle of Tabouk]] – a military expedition which, according to Muslim biographies, was launched by Muhammad against the Romans in 630 CE.

== Hadith ==
ʻAbdu'l-Bahá taught that some [[Sunnah|stories]] about the teachings, deeds and sayings of Muhammad as described in certain [[hadith]] which he perceived to be negative, were fabricated due to 'fanaticism', 'ignorance' or 'enmity'. He told that most of those who narrated such stories were either members of the 'clergy', 'antagonistic' or 'ignorant Muslims who repeated unfounded traditions about Muhammad which they ignorantly believed to be to His praise.' Thus, he says, 'some benighted Muslims made His polygamy the pivot of their praises'.

While disregarding some hadith about Muhammad as fabrications and exaggerations with no foundation, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá accepted the authenticity of others. For example, traditions about Muhammad's friendly treatment of the Christians of Najran of whom Muhammad is said to have proclaimed: 'If any one infringes their rights, I myself will be his enemy, and in the presence of God I will bring a charge against him.' According to Baháʼí belief, in this time Muslims and Christians lived in harmony with each other, however, 'after a certain time', due to 'the transgression of both Muhammadans and the Christians, hatred and enmity arose between them.'{{sfn|ʻAbdu'l-Bahá|2015|pp=26 (7.9)}}

== Qur'án ==
Baháʼís believe in authenticity and inerrancy of the Qur’an.

Shoghi Effendi, in ''Advent of Divine Justice'' says: "They (Baháʼís) must... approach reverently and with a mind purged from preconceived ideas the study of the Qur'án which, apart from the sacred scriptures of the Bábí and Bahá'í Revelations, constitutes the only Book which can be regarded as an absolutely authenticated Repository of the Word of God."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-10-01|title=The Story of Joseph: Illuminating the Relationship between the Bahá’í Faith and Islam: Dr. Todd Lawson’s Web Talk|url=https://wilmetteinstitute.org/the-story-of-joseph-illuminating-the-relationship-between-the-bahai-faith-and-islam-dr-todd-lawsons-web-talk/|access-date=2020-10-24|website=Wilmetteinstitute.org/|language=en}}</ref>

== Seal of the Prophets ==
In contrast to the Muslims, Baháʼís do not believe that Muhammad is the final messenger of God,<ref name=JBS5-3 /><ref>{{cite journal
| author= Wittman, Brian | title =Keys to the Proper Understanding of Islam in The Dispensation of Baha'u'llah | journal = Lights of Irfan | volume =2 | pages =135–48 | publisher = Irfan Colloquia | location = Wilmette, IL | date =2001 | url =http://bahai-library.com/wittman_understanding_islam.html | access-date = Dec 15, 2015}}</ref> or rather define [[eschatology]] and [[end times]] references as metaphorical for changes in the ages or eras of mankind but that it and progress of God's guidance continues. Although, in common with Islam, the title the [[Seal of the prophets|Seal of the Prophets]] is reserved for Muhammad, Baháʼís interpret it differently. They believe that the term Seal of the Prophets applies to a specific epoch, and that each prophet is the 'seal' of his own epoch. Therefore, in the sense that all the prophets of God are united in the same 'Cause of God', having the same underlying message, and all 'abiding in the same tabernacle, soaring in the same heaven, seated upon the same throne, uttering the same speech, and proclaiming the same Faith', they can all claim to be 'the return of all the Prophets'. Likewise, since they all have 'a definitely prescribed mission, a predestined revelation, and specially designated limitations', they can all claim to be the 'seal of the prophets' for their own epoch.{{sfn|Baháʼu'lláh|2003|pp=176 (§ 191)}} According to this understanding, there is no reason why another prophet cannot follow with a message which is a seal for his own specific epoch.

Baháʼu'lláh cited Sura 5:64 of the Qurʼan in arguing that the censure applied to the Jews in that [[ayah]] (that they had sought to limit the power of God to do as he wills) was just as applicable to Muslims who held to the doctrine that no prophets could follow Muhammad. He writes that: 'For over a thousand years they have been reciting this verse, and unwittingly pronouncing their censure against the Jews, utterly unaware that they themselves, openly and privily, are voicing the sentiments and belief of the Jewish people'.{{sfn|Baháʼu'lláh|2003|pp=137 (§ 148)}}

Muhammad is seen as ending the ''[[Progressive revelation (Baháʼí)#Universal cycles|Adamic cycle]]'', also known as the ''Prophetic cycle'', which is stated to have begun approximately 6,000 years ago,<ref>Letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer, March 13, 1986.
