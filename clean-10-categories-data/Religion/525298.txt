'''Interfaith dialogue''' refers to cooperative, constructive, and positive interaction between people of different [[religion|religious]] traditions (i.e. "faiths") and/or [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[humanism|humanistic]] beliefs, at both the individual and institutional levels. It is distinct from [[syncretism]] or alternative religion, in that dialogue often involves promoting understanding between different religions or beliefs to increase [[acceptance]] of others, rather than to synthesize new beliefs.

The [[Archdiocese of Chicago]]'s Office for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs defines "the difference between ecumenical, interfaith, and interreligious relations", as follows:
*"ecumenical" as "relations and prayer with other Christians",
*"interfaith" as "relations with members of the '[[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic faiths]]' (Jewish and Muslim traditions)," and
*"interreligious" as "relations with other religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archchicago.org/departments/ecumenical/Relations.htm|title=Archdiocese of Chicago|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005044003/https://www.archchicago.org/departments/ecumenical/Relations.htm|archive-date=2016-10-05}}</ref>
Some interfaith dialogues have more recently adopted the name '''interbelief dialogue''',<ref name="ICC">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160202185558/http://publicreligion.org/2014/07/the-morning-buzz-how-religious-affiliation-and-attendance-influence-likelihood-of-divorce/ "The Morning Buzz," ''Public Religion Research Institute'', July 10, 2014].

Similarly, [[Pluralistic Rationalism|pluralistic rationalist]] groups have hosted public reasoning dialogues to transcend all worldviews (whether religious, cultural or political), termed '''transbelief dialogue'''.<ref name="pluralism1">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160202183045/http://www.pluralism.org/interfaith/twin_cities/practices/secular_bible_study "Promising Practice: Finding Common Ground Through Difference," ''Harvard Pluralism Project''].

The [[World Council of Churches]] distinguishes between 'interfaith' and 'interreligious'. To the WCC, interreligious refers to action between different Christian denominations. So, interfaith refers to interaction between different faith groups such as Muslim and Christian or Jew for example.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interreligious Dialogue|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/programmes/interreligiousdialogue/christian-self-understanding.html|publisher=World Council of Churches|accessdate=24 July 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017232433/http://www.oikoumene.org/en/programmes/interreligiousdialogue/christian-self-understanding.html|archive-date=17 October 2012}}</ref>

Throughout the world there are local, regional, national and international interfaith initiatives; many are formally or informally linked and constitute larger networks or federations. The often quoted<ref>Musser, D  & Sunderland, D., ''War or Words:  Interreligious Dialogue as an Instrument of Peace'' Cleveland: The Pilgrim Press, (2005) 1.</ref> "There will be no peace among the nations without peace among the religions. There will be no peace among the religions without dialogue among the religions" was formulated by [[Hans Küng]], a Professor of Ecumenical Theology and President of the Global Ethic Foundation. Interfaith dialogue forms a major role in the study of [[religion and peacebuilding]].

History records examples of interfaith initiatives throughout the ages, with varying levels of success in establishing one of three types of "dialogue" to engender, as recently described, either understanding, teamwork, or tolerance:<ref name="auto">Leonard Swidler, Khalid Duran, Reuven Firestone, ''Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue'' (Twenty-Third Publications, 2007), 2.</ref>
# "In the dialogue of the head, we mentally reach out to the other to learn from those who think differently from us."
# "In the dialogue of the hands, we all work together to make the world a better place in which we must all live together."
# "In the dialogue of the heart, we share the experience of the emotions of those different from us."

The historical effectiveness of interfaith dialogue is an issue of debate. Friar James L. Heft, in a lecture on "The Necessity of Inter-Faith Diplomacy," spoke about the conflicts among practitioners of the three Abrahamic religions ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]). Noting that except for the [[La Convivencia|Convivencia]] in the 14th and 15th centuries, believers in these religions have either kept their distance or have been in conflict, Heft maintains, "there has been very little genuine dialogue" between them. "The sad reality has been that most of the time Jews, Muslims and Christians have remained ignorant about each other, or worse, especially in the case of Christians and Muslims, attacked each other."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ifacs.com/the-necessity-of-inter-faith-diplomacy-the-catholicmuslim-dialogue/|title=The Necessity of Inter-Faith Diplomacy: The Catholic/Muslim Dialogue - Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911193129/http://ifacs.com/the-necessity-of-inter-faith-diplomacy-the-catholicmuslim-dialogue/|archive-date=2016-09-11}}</ref>

In contrast, The Pluralism Project at Harvard University<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pluralism.org/|title=The Pluralism Project|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129201707/http://www.pluralism.org/|archive-date=2012-11-29}}</ref> says, "Every religious tradition has grown through the ages in dialogue and historical interaction with others. Christians, Jews, and Muslims have been part of one another's histories, have shared not only villages and cities, but ideas of God and divine revelation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pluralism.org/religions/rivers-of-faith/|title=Rivers of Faith - The Pluralism Project|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731074628/http://pluralism.org/religions/rivers-of-faith/|archive-date=2016-07-31}}</ref>

The importance of Abrahamic interfaith dialogue in the present has been bluntly presented: "We human beings today face a stark choice: dialogue or death!"<ref name="auto"/>

More broadly, interfaith dialogue and action have occurred over many centuries: 
*In the 16th century, the Emperor [[Akbar the Great|Akbar]] encouraged [[Toleration|tolerance]] in [[Mughal India]], a diverse nation with people of various faith backgrounds, including [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], and [[Christianity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://progressivescottishmuslims.blogspot.com/2008/04/learning-interfaith-from-mughals-akbar.html|title=Progressive Scottish Muslims : Learning Interfaith from the Mughals: Akbar the Great (1556-1605)|first=Dr Amanullah De|last=Sondy|date=8 April 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708061041/http://progressivescottishmuslims.blogspot.com/2008/04/learning-interfaith-from-mughals-akbar.html|archive-date=8 July 2011}}</ref>
*Religious pluralism can also be observed in other historical contexts, including [[Muslim Spain]]. [[Zarmanochegas]] (Zarmarus) (Ζαρμανοχηγὰς) was a monk of the [[Sramana]] tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) from India who journeyed to [[Antioch]] and Athens while Augustus (died 14 CE) was ruling the Roman Emprire.<ref>Strabo, xv, 1, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&redirect=true%20change on the immolation of the Sramana in Athens (Paragraph 73)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007122332/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239&redirect=true%20change |date=2016-10-07 }}.</ref><ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/54*.html#9 liv.

*"[[Disputation of Barcelona]] – religious disputation between [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] in 1263. The apostate Paulus [Pablo] Christiani proposed to King [[James I of Aragon]] that a formal public religious disputation on the fundamentals of faith should be held between him and R. Moses b. Nahman ([[Nachmanides]]) whom he had already encountered in [[Gerona, Spain|Gerona]]. The disputation took place with the support of the ecclesiastical authorities and the generals of the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] and [[Franciscan]] orders, while the king presided over a number of sessions and took an active part in the disputation. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] [[Raymond of Penyafort|Raymond de Peñaforte]], [[Raymond Martini]], and Arnold de Segarra, and the general of the [[Franciscan order]] in the kingdom, Peter de Janua, were among the [[Christians|Christian]] disputants. The single representative for the [[Jewish]] side was [[Naḥmanides]]. The four sessions of the disputation took place on July 20, 27, 30, and 31, 1263 (according to another calculation, July 20, 23, 26, and 27). [[Naḥmanides]] was guaranteed complete freedom of speech in the debate; he took full advantage of the opportunity thus afforded and spoke with remarkable frankness. Two accounts of the disputation, one in Hebrew written by [[Naḥmanides]] and a shorter one in [[Latin]], are the main sources for the history of this important episode in Judeo-Christian polemics. According to both sources the initiative for the disputation and its agenda were imposed by the [[Christians|Christian]] side, although the [[Hebrew]] account tries to suggest a greater involvement of [[Naḥmanides]] in finalizing the items to be discussed. When the ecclesiastics who saw the "not right" turn the disputation was taking, due to Nahmanides persuasive argumentation, they urged that it should be ended as speedily as possible. It was, therefore, never formally concluded, but interrupted. According to the [[Latin]] record of the proceedings, the disputation ended because [[Nahmanides]] fled prematurely from the city. In fact, however, he stayed on in [[Barcelona]] for over a week after the disputation had been suspended in order to be present in the synagogue on the following [[Sabbath]] when a conversionist sermon was to be delivered. The king himself attended the synagogue and gave an address, an event without medieval precedent. Nahmanides was permitted to reply on this occasion. The following day, after receipt of a gift of 300 sólidos from the king, he returned home."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02023.html|title=Disputation of Barcelona - Jewish Virtual Library|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210085554/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02023.html|archive-date=2015-02-10}}</ref>

:"While the Disputation may have been a great achievement for [[Paulus Christiani]] in his innovative use of rabbinic sources in [[Christians|Christian]] missionary efforts, for [[Naḥmanides]] it represented an additional example of the wise and courageous leadership which he offered his people."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02023.html|title=Disputation of Barcelona|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210085554/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02023.html|archive-date=2015-02-10}}</ref><ref>A History of the Jews in Christian Spain, Volume 1 {{ISBN|978-1-5904-5112-0}}</ref><ref>Gleanings : Essays in Jewish History, Letters, and Art by Cecil Roth.

===20th-century initiatives===
*In 1900, the [[International Association for Religious Freedom]] (IARF) was founded under a name different from its current one. In 1987, its statement of purpose was revised to include advancing "understanding, dialogue and readiness to learn and promotes sympathy and harmony among the different religious traditions". In 1990, its membership was enlarged "to include all the world's major religious groups". In 1996, IARF's World Congress included representatives of Palestinian and Israeli IARF groups and Muslim participants made presentations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://iarf.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Summary-IARF-history-written-1999.pdf|title="IARF History".

*In December 1914, just after [[World War I]] began, a group of Christians gathered in Cambridge, England to found the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (FOR) "in hopes of bringing people of faith together to promote peace, and it went on to become a leading interfaith voice for non-violence and non-discrimination". It has branches and affiliated groups in over 50 countries on every continent. The membership includes "Jews, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, Indigenous religious practitioners, Baháʼí, and people of other faith traditions, as well as those with no formal religious affiliation".<ref name="auto1"/>
*In 1936, the World Congress of Faiths (WCF) formed in London. It is "one of the oldest interfaith bodies in the world". One of its purposes is to bring "people of faith together to enrich their understandings of their own and others' traditions". It does this by offering opportunities "to meet, explore, challenge and understand different faith traditions through events from small workshops to large conferences, partnership working, online conversation, and publications".<ref name="auto1"/>
*In 1949, following the devastation of [[World War II]], the Fellowship In Prayer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fellowshipinprayer.org/fip/_top|title=Fellowship in Prayer|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819052036/http://www.fellowshipinprayer.org/fip/_top|archive-date=2016-08-19|access-date=2016-08-11}}</ref> was founded in 1949 by Carl Allison Evans and Kathryn Brown. Evans believed that unified prayer would "bridge theological or structural religious differences," would "open the mind and heart of the prayer to a new understanding of and appreciation for the beliefs and values of those following different spiritual paths," and would  "advance interfaith understanding and mutual respect among religious traditions,"<ref name="auto1"/>
*In 1952, the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU) was founded in Amsterdam. It serves as "the sole world umbrella organisation embracing Humanist, atheist, rationalist, secularist, skeptic, laique, ethical cultural, freethought and similar organisations world-wide".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://interfaith.directory/organizations?udt_489_param_detail=3246|title=IHEU Information.

It implements its vision by seeking "to influence international policy through representation and information, to build the humanist network, and let the world know about the worldview of Humanism".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org|title=IHEU - The International Humanist and Ethical Union|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226020934/http://www.iheu.org/|archive-date=2012-12-26}}</ref>
*In 1958, the [[Center for the Study of World Religions]] (CSWR) at [[Harvard Divinity School]] (HDS) began. Since then, it "has been at the forefront of promoting the sympathetic study and understanding of world religions. It has supported academic inquiry and international understanding in this field through its residential community," and "its research efforts and funding, and its public programs and publications".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cswr.hds.harvard.edu/about/history|title=History|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803075543/http://cswr.hds.harvard.edu/about/history|archive-date=2016-08-03}}</ref>
*In 1960, Juliet Hollister (1916–2000) created the [[Temple of Understanding]] (TOU) to provide "interfaith education" with the purpose of "breaking down prejudicial boundaries". The Temple of Understanding "over several years hosted meetings that paved the way for the [[North American Interfaith Network]] (NAIN)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://templeofunderstanding.org/who-we-are/history/written-history/|title=Written History - Temple of Understanding|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818202432/http://templeofunderstanding.org/who-we-are/history/written-history/|archive-date=2016-08-18}}</ref>
*In the late 1960s, interfaith groups such as the Clergy And Laity Concerned (CALC) joined around [[Civil Rights]] issues for [[African-Americans]] and later were often vocal in their opposition to the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Give Peace a Chance: Exploring the Vietnam Antiwar Movement {{ISBN|978-0-8156-2559-9}}</ref>

*In 1965, "about 100 Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish clergy" formed Clergy Concerned about Vietnam (CCAV). Its purpose was "to challenge U.S. policy on Vietnam". When the group admitted laity, it renamed itself National Emergency Committee of Clergy and Laymen Concerned about Vietnam (CALCAV) In 1967, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] used its platform for his "Beyond Vietnam" speech.  Later, CALCAV addressed other issues of social justice issues and changed its name to become simply Clergy and Laymen Concerned (CALC).<ref>Mitchell K.

*In 1965, during [[Vatican II]], it was decided that relations with all religions should be developed. To do this, [[Pope Paul VI]] established a special secretariat (later a pontifical council) for relationships with non-Christians. The papal encyclical ''Ecclesiam Suam '' emphasized the importance of positive encounter between Christians and people of other faith traditions. ''The Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions'' (''Nostra Aetate'') of 1965, spelled out the pastoral dimensions of this relationship.<ref name="oikoumene.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-programmes/interreligious-dialogue-and-cooperation/interreligious-trust-and-respect/ecumenical-dictionary-interfaith-dialogue|title=Dictionary of the Ecumenical Movement article on Interfaith Dialogue – World Council of Churches|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910180502/https://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/wcc-programmes/interreligious-dialogue-and-cooperation/interreligious-trust-and-respect/ecumenical-dictionary-interfaith-dialogue|archive-date=2016-09-10}}</ref>

*In 1970, the first World Conference of [[Religions for Peace]] was held in [[Kyoto]], Japan. Religions for Peace is "the world's largest and most representative multi-religious coalition advancing common action for peace".  Its work includes "dialogue" that "bears fruit in common concrete action". Through the organization, diverse religious communities discern "deeply held and widely shared" moral concerns, such as, "transforming violent conflict, promoting just and harmonious societies, advancing human development and protecting the earth".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religionsforpeace.org/vision-history/history|title=History - Religions for Peace International|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010011522/http://www.religionsforpeace.org/vision-history/history|archive-date=2016-10-10|access-date=2016-08-16}}</ref>
*In 1978, the [[Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington]] (IFC) was formed.<ref name="auto1"/> "The IFC brings together eleven historic faith communities to promote dialogue, understanding and a sense of community and to work cooperatively for justice throughout the [[District of Columbia]] region."

*On October 27, 1986 [[Pope John Paul II]] had a day of prayer at Assisi and invited "about fifty Christians and fifty leaders of other faiths". In his book ''One Christ–Many Religions'', [[S. J. Samartha]] says that the importance of that day of prayer for "interreligious relationships cannot be overestimated" and gives "several reasons" for its importance:<ref>S. J. Samartha, ''One Christ–Many Religions: Toward a Revised Christology''. 1991. (Reprint. Wipf and Stock, 2015), 14-15.</ref>
# "It conferred ''legitimacy'' to Christian initiatives in interreligious dialogues."
# "It was seen as an event of ''theological'' significance."
# "Assisi was recognized as ''an act of dialogue'' in the highest degree."
# "It emphasized the ''religious'' nature of peace."
:However, Samartha added, two points caused "disquiet" to people of faiths other than Christian:<ref>S. J. Samartha, ''One Christ–Many Religions: Toward a Revised Christology''. 1991. (Reprint. Wipf and Stock, 2015), 15-16.</ref>

A [[PhD]] thesis ''Dialogue Between Christians, Jews and Muslims'' argues that "the paramount need is for barriers against non-defensive dialogue conversations between Christians, Jews, and Muslims to be dismantled to facilitate development of common understandings on matters that are deeply divisive".

Interfaith and multi-faith interactivity is integral to the teachings of the [[Baháʼí Faith]].  Its founder [[Bahá'u'lláh]] enjoined his followers to "consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship".<ref name="tab_baha_1">[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-4.html#pg22 Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh, page 22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103034255/http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-4.html |date=2009-11-03 }}, Bahá'u'lláh, From the "Bishárát" (Glad-Tidings).</ref> Baháʼís are often at the forefront of local inter-faith activities and efforts.

In 2002 the [[Universal House of Justice]], the global governing body of the Baháʼís, issued a letter to the religious leadership of all faiths in which it identified religious prejudice as one of the last remaining "isms" to be overcome, enjoining such leaders to unite in an effort to root out extreme and divisive religious intolerance.<ref>{{Cite book|editor= Catharine Cookson  |year = 2003 |title = Encyclopedia of Religious Freedom |publisher = Taylor & Francis |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=R0PrjC1Ar7gC | page = 9 |isbn = 9780415941815 }}</ref>

The fourteenth century Zen master [[Gasan Joseki]] indicated that the [[Gospels]] were written by an enlightened being:

:"And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.

===Christianity===
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2013}}
Traditional Christian doctrine is [[Christocentric]], meaning that [[Christ]] is held to be the sole full and true revelation of the will of God for humanity.  In a Christocentric view, the elements of truth in other religions are understood in relation to the fullness of truth found in Christ.  God is nevertheless understood to be free of human constructions.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}  Therefore, God the [[Holy Spirit]] is understood as the power who guides non-Christians in their search for truth, which is held to be a search for the mind of Christ, even if "anonymously," in the phrase of Catholic theologian [[Karl Rahner]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} For those who support this view, [[anonymous Christian]]s belong to Christ now and forever and lead a life fit for Jesus' commandment to love, even though they never explicitly understand the meaning of their life in Christian terms.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

While the [[Catholic ecumenical councils|conciliar document]] ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' has fostered widespread dialogue, the declaration [[Dominus Iesus]] nevertheless reaffirms the centrality of the person of [[Jesus Christ]] in the spiritual and cultural identity of Christians, rejecting various forms of [[syncretism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Pope [[John Paul II]] was a major advocate of interfaith dialogue, promoting meetings in [[Assisi]] in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Pope [[Benedict XVI]] took a more moderate and cautious approach, stressing the need for [[intercultural dialogue]], but reasserting Christian theological identity in the revelation of Jesus of Nazareth in a book published with [[Marcello Pera]] in 2004.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In 2013, [[Pope Francis]] became the first Catholic leader to call for "sincere and rigorous" interbelief dialogue with atheists, both to counter the assertion that Christianity is necessarily an "expression of darkness of superstition that is opposed to the light of reason," and to assert that "dialogue is not a secondary accessory of the existence of the believer" but instead is a "profound and indispensable expression ...

In traditional Christian doctrine, the value of inter-religious dialogue had been confined to acts of love and understanding toward others either as anonymous Christians or as potential converts.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In mainline liberal Protestant traditions, however, as well as in the [[emerging church]], these doctrinal constraints have largely been cast off.  Many theologians, pastors, and lay people from these traditions do not hold to uniquely Christocentric understandings of how God was in Christ. They engage deeply in interfaith dialogue as learners, not converters, and desire to celebrate as fully as possible the many paths to God.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

[[Reform Judaism]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] encourage interfaith dialogue.

Building positive relations between Jews and members of other religious communities has been an integral component of Reform Judaism's "DNA" since the movement was founded in Germany during the early 19th century, according to Rabbi A. James Rudin. It began with Israel Jacobson, a layman and pioneer in the development of what emerged as Reform Judaism, who established an innovative religious school in Sessen, Germany in 1801 that initially had 40 Jewish and 20 Christian students. "Jacobson's innovation of a 'mixed' student body reflected his hopes for a radiant future between Jews and Christians."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reformjudaism.org/blog/2017/06/08/why-interfaith-relations-are-dna-reform-judaism|title=Why Interfaith Relations Are in the DNA of Reform Judaism|website=ReformJudaism.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170613223916/http://reformjudaism.org/blog/2017/06/08/why-interfaith-relations-are-dna-reform-judaism|archive-date=2017-06-13}}</ref>
 
[[Moravia]]n born Rabbi [[Isaac Mayer Wise]], who founded the Reform movement in the United States, sought close relations with Christian church leaders.

[[Islam]] has long encouraged dialogue to reach truth.  Dialogue is particularly encouraged amongst the People of the Book (Jews, Christians and Muslims) as Qur'an states, "Say, "O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you – that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah."

Many traditional and religious texts and customs of the faith have encouraged this, including specific verses in the [[Quran]], such as: "O people!

In recent times, Muslim theologians have advocated inter-faith dialogue on a large scale, something which is new in a political sense.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The declaration [[A Common Word]] of 2007 was a public first{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} in Christian-Islam relations, trying to work out a moral common ground on many social issues. This common ground was stated as "part of the very foundational principles of both faiths: love of the One God, and love of the neighbour". The declaration asserted that "these principles are found over and over again in the sacred texts of Islam and Christianity".<ref name="acommonword.com"/>

Relations between Muslims and Jews remain quite difficult, exacerbated by the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. There are inter-Muslim issues in between [[Sunnis]] and [[Shiites]] that are very much unresolved in the [[Middle East]]. Also, relations between Muslims and Hindus in India and Pakistan have included tension.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

;Interfaith dialogue integral to Islam
A 2003 book called ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'' contains a chapter by [[Amir Hussain]] on "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue" in which he shows how interfaith dialogue has been an integral part of Islam from its beginning. Hussain writes that "Islam would not have developed if it had not been for interfaith dialogue". From his "first revelation" for the rest of his life, Muhammad was "engaged in interfaith dialogue" and "pluralism and interfaith dialogue" have always been important to Islam. For example, when some of Muhammad's followers suffered "physical persecution" in [[Mecca]], he sent them to [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], a Christian nation, where they were "welcomed and accepted" by the Christian king. Another example is [[Córdoba, Andalusia]] in Muslim Spain, in the ninth and tenth centuries. Córdoba was "one of the most important cities in the history of the world". In it, "Christians and Jews were involved in the Royal Court and the intellectual life of the city". Thus, there is "a history of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and other religious traditions living together in a pluralistic society".<ref>Amir Hussain, "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue," in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 252–255 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).</ref> Turning to the present,  Hussain writes that in spite of Islam's history of "pluralism and interfaith dialogue", Muslims now face the challenge of conflicting passages in the Qur'an some of which support interfaith "bridge-building", but others can be used "justify mutual exclusion".<ref>Amir Hussain, "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue," in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 254 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).</ref>

By their fuller understanding, they became "defenders of each other's religion, denouncing the twin threats of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and promoting interfaith cooperation".<ref>[http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/226732/sons-of-abraham-by-rabbi-marc-schneier-and-imam-shamsi-ali/9780807033074/ Penguin-Randomhouse description of the book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920065605/http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/226732/sons-of-abraham-by-rabbi-marc-schneier-and-imam-shamsi-ali/9780807033074/ |date=2016-09-20 }}.</ref> In the book, regarding the state of Jewish-Muslim dialogue, although Rabbi Schneier acknowledges a  "tremendous growth", he does not think that "we are where we want to be".<ref>Rabbi Marc Schneier and Imam Shamsi Ali,  ''Sons of Abraham: A Candid Conversation about the Issues That Divide and Unite Jews and Muslims'' (Beacon Press, 2013), 180.</ref>

====Ahmadiyya====
{{Main|Ahmadiyya}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] Muslim Community was founded in 1889. Its members "exceeding tens of millions" live in 296 countries. It rejects "terrorism in any form".  It broadcasts its "message of peace and tolerance" over a satellite television channel MTA International Live Streaming,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.tv/live|title=MTA International Live Streaming|date=8 December 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215193529/http://www.mta.tv/live/|archive-date=15 February 2014}}</ref> on its internet website,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alislam.org|title=IslamAhmadiyya - Ahmadiyya Muslim Community - Al Islam Online - Official Website|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518011718/https://www.alislam.org/|archive-date=2017-05-18|access-date=2016-10-17}}</ref> and by its Islam International Publications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islaminternationalpublications.com/|title=Islam International Publications|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211091612/http://www.islaminternationalpublications.com/|archive-date=2017-02-11}}</ref><ref>[https://www.alislam.org/introduction/ About Ahmadiyya.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022140856/https://www.alislam.org/introduction/ |date=2016-10-22 }} Retrieved October 17, 2016.</ref> A 2010 story in the [[BBC News]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8711026.stm|title=Who are the Ahmadi?|date=28 May 2010|publisher=BBC News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530013220/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8711026.stm|archive-date=2010-05-30}}</ref> said that the Ahmadi "is regarded by orthodox Muslims as heretical", The story also reported persecution and violent attacks against the Ahmadi.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8711026.stm BBC News.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530013220/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8711026.stm |date=2010-05-30 }} Retrieved October 17, 2016.</ref>

According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding, interfaith dialogues are an integral part of developing inter-religious peace and the establishment of peace. The [[Ahmadiyya Community]] has been organising interfaith events locally and nationally in various parts of the world in order to develop a better atmosphere of love and understanding between faiths. Various speakers are invited to deliver a talk on how peace can be established from their own or religious perspectives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ahmadiyyatimes.blogspot.com/2010/02/malta-ahmadiyya-muslim-community-to.html|title=Ahmadiyya Muslim Community to hold Peace Conference in Malta|work=Ahmadiyya times|accessdate=19 October 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110729022913/http://ahmadiyyatimes.blogspot.com/2010/02/malta-ahmadiyya-muslim-community-to.html|archive-date=29 July 2011}}</ref>

===Zoroastrianism===
[[Zoroastrianism]] has long encouraged interfaith, all the way from [[Cyrus the Great]]'s speech in [[Babylon]], which permitted the population to keep following their own religion and keep speaking their own language. Cyrus did not enforce [[Zoroastrianism|the state religion]] unto the people. As well, Cyrus freed all the Jewish slaves from Babylon, which earned him a place in the Jewish scriptures. [[Zoroastrian]]s believe that all religions are equal, and that their religion is not superior to other religions. They believed that the [[Zoroaster|Prophet Zoroaster]] implied the religion unto them, and did not convert each of them. Therefore, they do not even accept converts into their religion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} All adherents must be born into the religion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Preconditions==
In her 2008 book ''The Im-Possibility of Interreligious Dialogue'', [[Catherine Cornille]] outlines her preconditions for "constructive and enriching dialogue between religions".<ref>[http://www.crossroadpublishing.com/crossroad/title/im-possibility-of-interreligious-dialogue Catherine Cornille, ''The Im-Possibility of Interreligious Dialogue'' (Crossroad Publishing Company, 2008). Retrieved August 1, 2016.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019040943/http://www.crossroadpublishing.com/crossroad/title/im-possibility-of-interreligious-dialogue |date=October 19, 2016 }}</ref> In summary, they include "doctrinal humility, commitment to a particular religion, interconnection, empathy, and hospitality". In full, they include the following:<ref>Balcomb, Michael W. "Religion As An Obstacle To Peace?" Dialogue & Alliance 26.2 (2012): 40-49. ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials. Web. 10 Feb. 2015.</ref>
* humility (causes a respect of a person's view of other religions)
* commitment (causes a commitment to faith that simultaneously accept tolerance to other faiths)
* interconnection (causes the recognition of shared common challenges such as the reconciliation of families)
* empathy (causes someone to view another religion from the perspective of its believers)
* hospitability (like the tent of Abraham, that was open on all four sides as a sign of hospitality to any newcomer).

Breaking down the walls that divides faiths while respecting the uniqueness of each tradition requires the courageous embrace of all these preconditions.<ref>Balcomb, Michael W. "Religion As An Obstacle To Peace?." Dialogue & Alliance 26.2 (2012): 40-49. ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials. Web. 10 Feb. 2015.</ref>

In 2016, [[President Obama]] made two speeches that outlined preconditions for meaningful interfaith dialogue: On February 3, 2016, he spoke at the [[Islamic Society of Baltimore]] and on February 4, 2016, at the [[National Prayer Breakfast]].<ref name="parliamentofreligions.org">{{cite web|url=https://parliamentofreligions.org/articles/8-principles-interfaith-relations-president-obama|title=Title - Parliament of the World's Religions|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019013007/https://parliamentofreligions.org/articles/8-principles-interfaith-relations-president-obama|archive-date=2016-10-19}}</ref> The eight principles of interfaith relations as outlined by Obama were as follows:<ref name="parliamentofreligions.org"/>
#Relationship building requires visiting each other.
#Relationship requires learning about the others' history.
#Relationship requires an appreciation of the other.
#Relationship requires telling the truth.
#Relationships depend on living up to our core theological principles and values.
#Relationships offer a clear-headed understanding of our enemies.
#Relationships help us overcome fear.
#Relationship requires solidarity.

==United Nations support==
The United Nations [[Alliance of Civilizations]] is an initiative to prevent violence and support social cohesion by promoting intercultural and interfaith dialogue. The UNAOC was proposed by the President of the Spanish Government, [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] at the 59th General Assembly of the United Nations in 2005. It was co-sponsored by the Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In 2008, [[Anwarul Karim Chowdhury]] said:  "Interfaith [[dialogue]] is absolutely essential, relevant, and necessary. ... If 2009 is to truly be the Year of Interfaith [[Cooperation]], the U.N. urgently needs to appoint an interfaith representative at a senior level in the Secretariat."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social-assistance-lifestyle/religion-spirituality/2239077-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-10 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505135634/http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social-assistance-lifestyle/religion-spirituality/2239077-1.html |archive-date=2012-05-05 }}</ref>{{citation needed|reason=Link no longer active.

The [[Philippines|Republic of the Philippines]] will host a Special [[Non-Aligned Movement]] Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and Development from March 16 to 18 in Manila.  During the meeting, to be attended by ministers of foreign affairs of the NAM member countries, a declaration in support of interfaith dialogue initiatives will be adopted.  An accompanying event will involve civil society activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snammm.org.ph/aboutthemeeting.asp|title=About the Meeting|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005012644/http://www.snammm.org.ph/aboutthemeeting.asp|archive-date=2009-10-05}}</ref>{{citation needed|reason=Link no longer active.

In 2010, HM King Abdullah II addressed the 65th UN General Assembly and proposed the idea for a 'World Interfaith Harmony Week' to further broaden his goals of faith-driven world harmony by extending his call beyond the Muslim and Christian community to include people of all beliefs, those with no set religious beliefs as well. A few weeks later, HRH Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad presented the proposal to the UN General Assembly, where it was adopted unanimously as a UN Observance Event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/about-us/how-it-began/|title=» How It Began|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116083718/http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/about-us/how-it-began/|archive-date=2011-01-16}}</ref> The first week of February, every year, has been declared a UN World Interfaith Harmony Week. The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre released a document which summarises the key events leading up to the UN resolution as well as documenting some Letters of Support and Events held in honour of the week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rissc.jo/docs/WIHW-110619.pdf|title=The First UN World Interfaith Harmony Week Booklet|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722071459/http://www.rissc.jo/docs/WIHW-110619.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-22}}</ref>

==Criticism==
The Islamist group [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] rejects the concept of interfaith dialogue, stating that it is a western tool to enforce non-Islamic policies in the Islamic world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.e-prism.org/images/clashofcivilisation.pdf|title=www.e-prism.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226035005/http://www.e-prism.org/images/clashofcivilisation.pdf|archive-date=2011-02-26|access-date=2010-10-08}}</ref>

Many [[Traditionalist Catholics]], not merely [[Sedevacantist]]s or the [[Society of St. Pius X]], are critical of interfaith dialogue as a harmful novelty arising after the [[Second Vatican Council]], which is said to have altered the previous notion of the Catholic Church's supremacy over other religious groups or bodies, as well as demoted traditional practices associated with traditional Roman Catholicism. In addition, these Catholics contend that, for the sake of collegial peace, tolerance and mutual understanding, interreligious dialogue devalues the divinity of [[Jesus Christ]] and the revelation of the [[Triune God]] by placing Christianity on the same footing as other religions that worship other deities. [[Evangelical Christian]]s also critical for dialogues with Catholics.

Religious sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] argued that one can reject interfaith dialogue on moral grounds in certain cases. The example he gave was that of a dialogue with imams who legitimate [[ISIS]], saying such discussions ought to be avoided so as not to legitimate a morally repugnant theology.<ref>Berger, Peter.  [http://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/01/11/a-jewish-take-on-pluralism/ "A Jewish Take on Pluralism."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128014629/http://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/01/11/a-jewish-take-on-pluralism/ |date=2017-01-28 }} ''The American Interest''.  11 January 2017.  1 February 2017.</ref>

In the case of Hinduism, it has been argued that the so-called interfaith "dialogue ... has [in fact] become the harbinger of violence. This is not because 'outsiders' have studied Hinduism or because the Hindu participants are religious 'fundamentalists' but because of the logical requirements of such a dialogue". With a detailed analysis of "two examples from Hinduism studies", [[S.N. Balagangadhara]] and Sarah Claerhout argue that, "in certain dialogical situations, the requirements of reason conflict with the requirements of morality".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Balagangadhara|first1=S.N|last2=Claerhout|first2=Sarah|title=Are Dialogues Antidotes to Violence? Two Recent Examples from Hinduism Studies|journal=Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies|date=2008|volume=7|issue=9|pages=118–143|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/RAOADA|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104111658/http://philpapers.org/rec/RAOADA|archive-date=2014-11-04}}</ref>

The theological foundations of interreligious dialogue have also been critiqued on the grounds that any interpretation of another faith tradition will be predicated on a particular cultural, historical and anthropological perspective<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moulin-Stożek|first=Daniel|date=2017|title=How do we see each other? Interdisciplinarity and the potential of interreligious scholarship|journal=Journal of Beliefs & Values|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=235–237|doi=10.1080/13617672.2017.1317516|issn=1361-7672|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Some critics of interfaith dialogue may not object to dialogue itself, but instead are critical of specific events claiming to carry on the dialogue. For example, the French Algerian prelate [[Pierre Claverie]] was at times critical of formal inter-religious conferences between Christians and Muslims which he felt remained too basic and surface-level. He shunned those meetings since he believed them to be generators of slogans and for the glossing over of theological differences.<ref name=NR>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/all-things-catholic/bishop-pierre-claverie-algeria-patron-dialogue-cultures|title=Bishop Pierre Claverie of Algeria: Patron for the dialogue of cultures|publisher=National Catholic Reporter|author=John L. Allen|date=26 October 2007|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=IO>{{cite web|author=Douglas Johnson|title=Bishop Pierre Claverie: Obituary|date=4 August 1996|publisher=Independent|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/bishop-pierre-claverie-obituary-5605610.html}}</ref> However, he had such an excellent knowledge of Islam that the people of Oran called him "the Bishop of the Muslims" which was a title that must have pleased him since he had dreamed of establishing true dialogue among all believers irrespective of faith or creed. Claverie also believed that the Islamic faith was authentic in practice focusing on people rather than on theories.<ref name=NR/> He said that: "dialogue is a work to which we must return without pause: it alone lets us disarm the fanaticism; both our own and that of the other". He also said that "Islam knows how to be tolerant". In 1974 he joined a branch of [[Cimade]] which was a French [[NGO]] dedicated to aiding the oppressed and minorities.<ref name=LC>{{cite web|url=https://international.la-croix.com/news/pierre-claverie-a-life-in-dialogue/3538|title=Pierre Claverie: A life in dialogue|newspaper=[[La Croix International]]|date=12 July 2016|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>
