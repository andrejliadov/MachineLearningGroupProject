{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Mahāvatār Bābājī''' (literally; Great [[Avatar]] [[Indian honorifics#Replacement type|(Revered) Father or Elder or Wise One]]) is the name given to an Indian [[yogi]] by [[Lahiri Mahasaya|Yogiraj Lahiri Mahasaya]],
and several of his disciples,<ref>[[Sri Yukteswar Giri]], Baba Nasib Singh Ji, Ram Gopal Muzumdar, Swami Kebalananda, and Swami Pranabananda Giri</ref> who reported meeting him between 1861 and 1935. Some of these meetings were described by [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] in his 1946 book ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', including a report of Yogananda's own meeting with the yogi.<ref name=yogananda>Yogananda, Paramahansa, ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-56589-212-5}}.</ref> Another account was given by [[Sri Yukteswar Giri]] in his 1894 book ''[[The Holy Science]]''.<ref name=yukteswar>Yukteswar Giri, ''The Holy Science''.

In the second last chapter of his book, he mentions Babaji changing his form to that of Lord Shiva.

==Childhood==

There are very few accounts of Babaji's childhood.  One source of information is the book ''Babaji and the 18 Siddha Kriya Yoga tradition'' by [[Marshall Govindan|Marshal Govindan]].<ref name="Govindan2001">{{cite book |title=Babaji and the 18 Siddha Kriya Yoga tradition |last=Govindan |first=Marshall |date=1 January 2001
|publisher=Babaji's Kriya Yoga Publications |isbn=978-1-895383-00-3}}</ref> According to Govindan, Babaji was born to a [[Nambudiri Brahmin]] couple
and was named Nagarajan (king of serpents) by them.<ref name=it/> V.T. Neelakantan and S.A.A. Ramaiah founded on 17 October 1952, (they claim – at the request of Babaji) a new organization, "Kriya Babaji Sangah," dedicated to the teaching of Babaji's Kriya Yoga. They claim that in 1953 Mahavatar Babaji told them that he was born in the year 203 CE in a small coastal village now known as [[Parangipettai]], [[Cuddalore district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], India.<ref name="NeelakantanRamaiah2006">{{cite book |last1=Neelakantan |first1=V. T. |last2=Ramaiah |first2=S. A.

In Paramahansa Yogananda's ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', many references are made to Mahavatar Babaji, including from Lahirī Mahasaya and [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri|Sri Yukteswar]].<ref name=yogananda/>
In his book ''[[The Second Coming of Christ (book)|The Second Coming of Christ]]'', Yogananda states that [[Jesus in India|Jesus Christ went to India]] and conferred with Mahavatar Babaji.<ref name=it/> This would make Babaji at least 2000 years old.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramahansa |title=The Second Coming of Christ: The Resurrection of the Christ Within You p. |year=2004 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship |location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn=0-87612-555-0}}</ref>
According to Govindan's book, Babaji Nagaraj's father was the priest of the village's temple. Babaji revealed only those details which he believed to be formative as well as potentially instructive to his disciples. Govindan mentioned one incident like this: "One time Nagaraj's mother had got one rare [[jackfruit]] for a family feast and put it aside. Babaji was only 4 years old at that time. He found the jackfruit when his mother was not around and ate it all. When his mother came to know about it, she flew in blind rage and stuffed a cloth inside Babaji's mouth, nearly suffocating him, but he survived. Later on he thanked God for showing him that she was to be loved without attachment or illusion. His love for his mother became unconditional and detached."<ref name="Govindan2001"/>

When Nagaraj was about 15 years of age, he joined a small group of wandering [[Sannyasa|sannyāsin]] due to their radiant faces and love for God. During the next few years, he wandered from place to place, studying holy scriptures like the [[Vedas]], [[Upanishad]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]] and [[Bhagavad Gita]] and practiced deep meditation{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Quest for Self-realization==
According to Marshall Govindan's book, at the age of eleven, he made a difficult journey on foot and by boat with a group of ascetics to [[Kataragama]], Sri Lanka. Nagaraj met [[Siddha]] [[Bhogarnathar]] and became his disciple. Nagaraj performed intensive yogic [[sadhana]] for a long time with him. Bhogarnathar inspired Nagaraj to seek his initiation into Kriya Kundalini Pranayam from Siddha [[Maharishi]] [[Agastya]]. Babaji became a disciple of Siddha Agastya. Nagaraj was initiated into the secrets of Kriya Kundalini Pranayama or "Vasi Yogam". Babaji made a long pilgrimage to [[Badrinath]] and spent eighteen months practising yogic [[kriya]] taught to him by Siddha Agastya and Bhogarnathar. Babaji attained self-realization shortly thereafter.<ref name="Govindan2001"/>

It is claimed that these revelations were made by Babaji himself to S.A.A. Ramaiah, a young graduate student in geology at the University of Madras and V.T. Neelakantan, a famous journalist, and close student of [[Annie Besant]], President of the Theosophical Society and mentor of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti]]. Babaji was said to have appeared to each of them independently and then brought them together to work for his Mission in 1942.<ref>{{cite web |title=Babaji's Kriya Yoga |url=http://www.babajiskriyayoga.net/english/about-babaji.htm}}</ref>

==Reports of meetings, 1861–1935==

===Shyāmacharan Lahirī===
{{Main|Lahiri Mahasaya}}
The first reported encounter with Mahavatar Babaji was in 1861, when Shyāmacharan Lahirī (called "Mahāsaya" by disciples, devotees, and admirers) was posted to [[Ranikhet]] in his work as an accountant for the British government. One day while walking in the hills of [[Dunagiri]] above Ranikhet, he heard a voice calling his name. Following the voice up the mountain, he met a "tall, divinely radiant [[sadhu]]."<ref name=lahiribio/> He was amazed to find that the sadhu knew his name.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=lahiribio/> This sadhu was Mahavatar Babaji.

Mahavatar Babaji told Lahirī that he was his guru from the past, then initiated him into [[Kriya Yoga]] and instructed Lahiri to initiate others. Lahiri wanted to remain with Mahavatar Babaji, who told him instead that he must return to the world to teach Kriya Yoga and that "Kriya Yoga [[sadhana]] would spread through the people of the world through his (Lahiri's) presence in the world."<ref name=lahiribio/>

Lahirī reported that Mahavatar Babaji did not give his name or background, so Lahiri gave him the title "Mahavatar Babaji." Many sadhus in India are called Babaji, and sometimes even "Babaji Maharaj", which has caused confusion between Mahavatar Babaji and other sadhus with similar names.<ref name=lahiribio/>

Lahirī had many meetings with Mahavatar Babaji, recounted in several books, including Paramhansa Yogananda's ''Autobiography of a Yogi'',<ref name=yogananda/> ''Yogiraj Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya'' (Lahiri's biography),<ref name=lahiribio/> and ''Purana Purusha: Yogiraj Sri Shama Churn Lahiri'',<ref name=purana>Chatterjee, Ashoke Kumar, ''Purana Purusha: Yogiraj Sri Shama Churn Lahiri''. Yogiraj Publications, 2004. {{ISBN|81-87563-01-X}}.</ref> among others.

There are references to Sri Lahiri Mahasaya in Sampoorna Sripada Vallabha Charitam as guru to [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sri Shirdi Saibaba]], who initiated him to kriya yoga.

===Disciples of Shyāmacharan Lahirī===

Several disciples of Shyāmacharan Lahirī also reported having met Babaji. Through discussion with each other, and the fact that some of these encounters included two or more witnesses, they confirmed that the person they saw was the same sadhu that Lahirī called Mahavatar Babaji.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=lahiribio/><ref name=kebalanandabio>{{cite book |last=Giri |first=Satyananda |title=Yogacharya Shastri Mahasaya: a short biographical sketch of Hamsaswami Kebalanandaji Maharaj |publisher=Yoganiketan |year=2004 |url=http://www.yoganiketan.net}}</ref>

At the 1894 [[Kumbha Mela]] in Allahabad, [[Yukteswar Giri]], a disciple of Lahirī, met Mahavatar Babaji. He was struck by the resemblance between Lahirī and Mahavatar Babaji.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=yukteswarbio/> Others who met Babaji also commented on the resemblance.<ref name=lahiribio/> It was at this meeting that Mahavatar Babaji instructed Sri Yukteswar to write the book that was to become ''Kaivalya Darshanam'', or ''[[The Holy Science]]''.<ref name=yukteswar/> Yukteswar had two more meetings with Mahavatar Babaji, including one in the presence of Lahiri Mahasaya.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=yukteswarbio/><ref name=lahiribio/>

Pranabananda Giri, another disciple of Lahirī, also met Mahavatar Babaji in the presence of Lahirī, at Lahirī's home. Pranabananda asked Mahavatar Babaji his age. Mahavatar Babaji responded that he was about 500 years old at that time.<ref name=pranabananda/>

Keshabananda, a disciple of Lahirī, tells of meeting Mahavatar Babaji in the mountains near [[Badrinath]] around 1935, after he became lost wandering in the mountains.<ref name=yogananda/> At that meeting, Pranabananda reported that Babaji gave him a message for Paramahansa Yogananda, that "I won't see him this time, as he is eagerly hoping; but I shall see him on some other occasion."<ref name=yogananda/> In his book ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', Paramahansa Yogananda wrote that Mahavatar Babaji visited him before his journey to America and addressed him saying, "You are the one I have chosen to spread the message of Kriya Yoga in the West."<ref name=yogananda/>

Other disciples of Lahirī who reported meetings with Mahavatar Babaji include Kebalananda Giri<ref name=kebalanandabio/> and Ram Gopal Muzumdar, who recounted meeting Mahavatar Babaji and his sister, whom he called Mataji.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=lahiribio/> In addition, a disciple of [[Trailanga Swami]], Shankari Mata (also called Shankari Mai [[-ji|Jiew]]) met Mahavatar Babaji while visiting Lahiri Mahasaya.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=lahiribio/>

==Traditional legends==
[[File:Altar-Langerringen.jpg|350px|thumb|Altar of the meditation circle Langerringen near Augsburg in Bavaria, Germany. Group of Self-Realization Fellowship.]] 
Paramahansa Yogananda, in his Autobiography, described Mahavatar Babaji's role on earth:<ref name=it/>
<blockquote>The Mahavatar is in constant communion with Christ; together they send out vibrations of redemption, and have planned the spiritual technique of salvation for this age. The work of these two {{Sic|?|hide=y|fully|-}}illumined masters–one with the body, and one without it–is to inspire the nations to forsake suicidal wars, race hatreds, religious sectarianism, and the boomerang-evils of materialism. Babaji is well aware of the trend of modern times, especially of the influence and complexities of Western civilization, and realizes the necessity of spreading the self-liberations of yoga equally in the West and in the East.</blockquote>

In addition, Babaji is reputed to be ageless, according to some accounts, and about 500 years old around the late 1800s, according to Pranabananda.<ref name=pranabananda/> Yogananda reports that, according to the disciples of Lahirī, nobody knows Babaji's age, family, place of birth, true name, or other details "dear to the annalist's heart."<ref name=yogananda/>

According to Yogananda's autobiography, he has a sister called Mataji (meaning "Holy Mother") who also has lived throughout the centuries.<ref name="E">{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism / Self Realisation Fellowship / Page: 781|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzPgCgAAQBAJ&q=Mahavatar+Babaji+hinduism&pg=PA781|isbn=978-0-7007-1267-0|last1 = Cush|first1 = Denise|last2 = Robinson|first2 = Catherine|last3 = York|first3 = Michael|date = 21 August 2012}}</ref> Her level of spiritual attainment is comparable to her brother's, and she lives in a state of spiritual ecstasy in a cave. Although only three pages in the book are dedicated to her, she is described by Ram Gopal as "young and surpassingly lovely" as well as a "glorious woman." .......<ref name=yogananda/>

Yogananda frequently prayed out loud to "Babaji-Krishna."<ref>Yogananda, Paramahansa: various articles (''Praecepta Lessons'', Volume 1, 1934) and recordings (''One Life Versus Reincarnation'' [CD]. {{ISBN|0-87612-439-2}}).</ref>

In Book 3 of ''[[Conversations with God]]'' (1998), by [[Neale Donald Walsch]], it is mentioned that Babaji may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead, just like Lazarus, Jesus and others.<ref>Walsch, Neale Donald, ''Conversations with God: an uncommon dialog (Book #3)'', page 95.</ref>

The 2002 [[Tamil film]] ''[[Baba (2002 film)|Baba]]'' written by [[Rajinikanth]] was based on Babaji.
[[Swami Maheshwarananda]] writes in his book ''The hidden power in humans'', that the Guru of the legendary Babaji is Sri Alakh Puriji.<ref>[[Swami Maheshwarananda]], ''The hidden power in humans'', Ibera Verlag, page 245. {{ISBN|3-85052-197-4}}</ref>

In his autobiography ''Apprenticed to a Himalayan master: a yogi's autobiography'' (2010), [[Sri M]] (Mumtaz Ali) narrates his meeting with Babaji near Neelkant hill.<ref>Sri M (Mumtaz Ali), ''Apprenticed to a Himalayan master: a yogi's autobiography'', Magenta Press, 2010, {{ISBN|81-910096-0-9}}</ref> In his book, Sri M gave description of Babaji as golden complexioned, bare-bodied, except for a shining white loin cloth that barely reached the knees, and flowing brown hair that fell to his shoulders. He mentioned that a lovely scent emanated from Babaji and he looked divine. In the second last chapter of his book, he mentions that Babji himself was Lord Shiva. He describes seeing Babaji changing his form to Lord Shiva again and again. He also mentions that Sai Baba, Jesus, Guru Nanak and many others were disciples of Mahavatar Babaji.

Songwriter [[Roger Hodgson]] of English rock band [[Supertramp]] composed a song called "[[Babaji (song)|Babaji]]" in reference to Mahavatar Babaji. This song was recorded and released on their 1977 album ''[[Even in the Quietest Moments...]]''
