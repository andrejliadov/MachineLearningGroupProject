The '''Holy of Holies''' ([[Tiberian Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew|קֹדֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִׁים}} ''Qṓḏeš HaQŏḏāšîm'') or '''HaDvir''' ({{lang-he|הדְּבִיר}}, lt. "[The] Sanctuary") is a term in the [[Hebrew Bible]] which refers to the inner sanctuary of the [[Tabernacle]] where God's presence appeared.  According to Hebrew Tradition, the area was defined by four pillars which held up the veil of the covering, under which the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was held above the floor. The Ark according to Hebrew Scripture contained the [[Ten Commandments]], which were given by God to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. King Solomon built the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]], where the Ark of the Covenant was supposed to be kept.

The [[Crusades|Crusaders]] associated it with the [[Well of Souls]],<ref name=secrets>{{cite book|last=Ritmeyer|first=Kathleen|title=Secrets of Jerusalem's Temple Mount|date=1 January 2006|publisher=[[Biblical Archaeology Society]]|language=en|isbn=9781880317860|page=104}}</ref> which is located under the [[Foundation Stone]] of the [[Dome of the Rock]].

==Hebrew terminology and translation==
[[File:Holman The Holy of Holies.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a Jewish [[High Priest]] wearing [[Hoshen]] and [[Ephod]] included as an illustration in a Christian Bible; the Holy of Holies is in the background (1890, Holman Bible)]]
The construction "Holy of Holies" is a literal translation of the Hebrew {{Hebrew|קֹדֶשׁ הַקֳּדָשִׁים}} ([[Tiberian Hebrew]]: ''Qṓḏeš HaQŏḏāšîm'') which is intended to express a [[superlative]]. Examples of similar constructions are "servant of servants" (Gen 9:25), "Sabbath of sabbaths" (Ex 31:15), "God of gods" (Deut 10:17), "Vanity of vanities" (Eccl 1:2), "Song of songs" (Song of Songs 1:1), "king of kings" (Ezra 7:12), etc.

In the [[Authorized King James Version]], "Holy of Holies" is always translated as "Most Holy Place". This is in keeping with the intention of the Hebrew idiom to express the utmost degree of holiness. The King James Version of the Bible has been in existence for over four hundred years. For most of that time, it was a primary reference in much of the English speaking world for information about Judaism. Thus, the name "Most Holy Place" was used to refer to the "Holy of Holies" in many English documents.

A related term is the ''[[debir]]'' ({{Hebrew|דְּבִיר}}) transliterated in the [[Septuagint]] (the Greek translation as ''dabir'' ({{lang|grc|δαβιρ}}),<ref>[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H1687&t=KJV Strong's Concordance, Gesenius ''devir'']</ref> which either means the back (i.e. western) part of the Sanctuary,<ref>The Solomonic Debir according to the Hebrew Text of I Kings 6 J. Ouellette - [[Journal of Biblical Literature]], 1970 - JSTOR "The immediate implication of this reading is that the holy of holies was built "from within the debir," that is ... The LXX simply transliterates dabir, while the Vulgate has "oraculum", thus suggesting a derivation from dbr "to speak."</ref> or derives from the verb stem D-V-R, "to speak", justifying the translation in the Latin Vulgate as ''oraculum'', from which the traditional English translation "oracle" (KJV, 1611) derives.<ref>The Damaged "blueprints" of the Temple of Solomon. L. Waterman - [[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]], 1943 - JSTOR "The term "holy of holies" has long been accepted as a later descriptive term applied to the debir. The Hebrew word debir, rendered "oracle" in the versions, is a mistranslation based on a false etymology. The term itself signifies only the back or part behind, for example."</ref>

==Ancient Israel==
===Tabernacle===
[[File:Tabernacle.gif|thumb|Layout of the tabernacle with the holy and holy of holies]]
According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], in order that [[Names of God in Judaism|God]] may dwell among the Israelites, [[tetragrammaton|God]] gave Moses instructions for erecting a [[sanctuary]]. The directions provide for:
# A [[Ark of the Covenant|wooden ark]], [[gold|gilded]] inside and outside, for the [[Tablets of stone|Tablets of the Covenant]], with a pure gold cover as the "[[mercy seat]]" for the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]];
# A gilt table for the "[[showbread|Table of Showbread]]", on which loaves of bread were arranged;
# A golden [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], lampstand of 7 oil lamps for a [[light]] never to be extinguished;
# The dwelling, including the curtains for the roof, the walls made of boards resting on [[silver]] feet and held together by [[wood]]en [[Screw|bolts]], the multi-colored [[curtain]] veiling the Holy of Holies (of blue, purple, crimson, white and gold), the table and [[Menorah (Temple)|candlestick]], and the outer curtain;
# A [[Altar (Bible)|sacrificial altar]] made of [[bronze]]d boards for its ''[[korban]]''/sacrifice;
# The outer court formed by [[column|pillars]] resting on bronze [[pedestal]]s and connected by hooks and crossbars of silver, with embroidered curtains;
# Recipe and preparation of the [[holy anointing oil|oil]] for the Lampstand.

According to the Bible, the Holy of Holies was covered by a [[veil]],<ref>Exodus 26:31-33</ref> and no one was allowed to enter except the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]], and even he would only enter once a year on [[Yom Kippur]],<ref>Leviticus 16</ref> to offer the blood of sacrifice and [[Incense offering in rabbinic literature|incense]]. The Bible reports that in the wilderness, on the day that the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|tabernacle]] was first raised up, the cloud of the Lord covered the tabernacle ({{Bibleverse|Exodus|40:33-40:34}}). There are other times that this was recorded, and instructions were given that the Lord would appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat (''kapporet''), and at that time the priests should not enter into the tabernacle (Leviticus 16:2). According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Holy of Holies contained the [[Ark of the Covenant]] with representation of [[Cherub]]im.

Upon completion of the dedication of the Tabernacle, the Voice of God spoke to Moses "from between the Cherubim" ({{Bibleverse|Numbers|7:89}}).

===Solomon's Temple===
{{main|Solomon's Temple}}
[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e15 669-0.jpg|thumb|[[Solomon's Temple]] which was on the site prior to the building of the [[Second Temple]]]]

The Holy of Holies, the [[Most sacred sites|most sacred site]] in [[Judaism]], is the inner sanctuary within the [[Tabernacle]] and [[Temple in Jerusalem]] when [[Solomon's Temple]] and the [[Second Temple]] were standing. A [[brocade]] curtain ([[Hebrew]]: ''parochet''), made with [[cherub]]im motifs woven directly into the fabric from the loom, divided the Holy of Holies from the lesser Holy place.<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Yoma'' 72b); [[Rashi]]'s Commentary and Aramaic Targum of Exodus 26:31. The "parochet" was "the work of an artisan," meaning, one who was skilled in motifs worked into the loom. Brocade refers to the decorative elements inserted into the weft on the loom, unlike embroidery which is added to the finished cloth.</ref> The Holy of Holies was located in the westernmost end of the Temple building, being a perfect cube: 20 [[cubit]]s by 20 cubits by 20 cubits. The inside was in total darkness and contained the Ark of the Covenant, gilded inside and out, in which was placed the [[Tablets of stone|Tablets of the Covenant]]. According to both Jewish and Christian tradition, [[Aaron's rod]] and a pot of [[manna]] were also in the ark.<ref>[[Midrash Rabba]], [[Midrash HaGadol]], et al.; [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 9:4 in the [[New Testament]]</ref> The Ark was covered with a lid made of pure gold, known as the "[[mercy seat]]" ({{bibleverse|Exodus|37:6}}) which was covered by the beaten gold cherubim wings, creating the space for the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] ({{bibleverse|Exodus|25:22}}).

===Second Temple===
{{main|Second Temple}}
[[File:Jerus-n4i.jpg|right|thumb|Model of the Second Temple]]

When the Temple was rebuilt after the [[Babylonian captivity]], the Ark was no longer present in the Holy of Holies; instead, a portion of the floor was raised slightly to indicate the place where it had stood. In Jewish tradition, two curtains separated the Holy of Holies from the lesser Holy place during the period of the Second Temple. These curtains were woven with motifs directly from the loom, rather than embroidered, and each curtain had the thickness of a handbreadth (ca. 9&nbsp;cm.).<ref>[[Midrash HaGadol]] on Exodus 26:31; [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Yoma'' 72b)</ref> [[Josephus]] records that [[Pompey]] profaned the Temple by insisting on entering the Holy of Holies in 63 BCE.<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Jews/Book_I#Chapter_7 The War of the Jews, Book 1, Chapter 7]</ref> When [[Titus]] captured the city during the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], Roman soldiers took down the curtain and used it to wrap therein golden vessels retrieved from the Temple.

===Day of Atonement===
{{Main|Yom Kippur}}
The Holy of Holies was entered once a year by the High Priest on the [[Day of Atonement]], to sprinkle the blood of sacrificial animals (a bull offered as atonement for the Priest and his household, and a goat offered as atonement for the people) and offer incense upon the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and the [[mercy seat]] which sat on top of the ark in the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] (the [[Second Temple]] had no ark and the blood was sprinkled where the Ark would have been and the incense was put on the [[Altar (Bible)#Altar of Incense|Brazen Altar]] of incense). The animal was sacrificed and the blood was carried into the most holy place. The golden [[censer]]s were also found in the Most Holy Place.

[[File:Magdala Stone (4).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Magdala stone]]]]

==In ancient Judaism==
The [[Magdala stone]] is thought to be a representation of the Holy of Holies carved before the destruction of the Temple in the year 70.<ref name=Kershner>{{cite news|last1=Kershner|first1=Isabel|title=A Carved Stone Block Upends Assumptions About Ancient Judaism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/middleeast/magdala-stone-israel-judaism.html|access-date=9 December 2015|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 December 2015}}</ref>

==In Rabbinical Judaism==
Traditional [[Judaism]] regards the location where the inner sanctuary was originally located, on the [[Temple Mount]] ([[Mount Moriah]]), as retaining some or all of its original sanctity for use in a future [[Third Temple]]. The exact location of the Kodesh Hakodashim{{underdiscussion-inline|Duplicate articles with non-English titles}} is a subject of dispute.

[[File:Women praying in the Western Wall tunnels by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Women praying in the tunnel at the closest physical point not under Islamic [[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|Waqf]] jurisdiction to the Holy of Holies]]
Traditional Judaism regards the Holy of Holies as the place where the presence of [[God]] dwells. The [[Talmud]] gives detailed descriptions of Temple architecture and layout. According to the [[Babylonian Talmud]] Tractate [[Yoma]], the Kodesh Hakodashim is located in the center North-South but significantly to the West from an East–West perspective, with all the major courtyards and functional areas lying to its east.

The [[Talmud]] supplies additional details, and describes the ritual performed by the High Priest. During the ritual, the High Priest would pronounce the [[Tetragrammaton]], the only point according to traditional [[Judaism]] that it was pronounced out loud. According to Jewish tradition, the people prostrated themselves fully on the ground when it was said. According to the Talmud, the High Priest's face upon exit from the Holy of Holies was radiant.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

While under normal circumstances, access to the Holy of Holies was restricted to the High Priest and only on [[Yom Kippur]], the Talmud suggests that repair crews were allowed inside as needed but were lowered from the upper portion of the room via enclosures so that they only saw the area they were to work on.<ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Pesachim.pdf Talmud Mas. Pesachim 26a]</ref><ref>[http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Eiruvin.pdf Talmud Mas. Eiruvin 105a]</ref>

===Synagogue architecture===
[[Judaism]] regards the [[Torah ark]], a place in a [[synagogue]] where the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] are kept, as a miniature Holy of Holies.

[[File:The rock of the Dome of the Rock Corrected.jpg|thumb|The [[Foundation Stone]] under the Dome of the Rock, a possible historical location for the Kodesh Hakodashim.]]

===Modern location===
The exact location of the Holy of Holies is a contentious issue, as elements of questioning the exact placement of the Temple is often associated with [[Temple denial]]. There are three main theories as to where the Temple stood: where the [[Dome of the Rock]] is now located, to the north of the Dome of the Rock (Professor Asher Kaufman), or to the east of the Dome of the Rock (Professor Joseph Patrich of the [[Hebrew University]]).<ref>See article in the ''World Jewish Digest'', April 2007</ref> Since the Holy of Holies lay at the center of the complex as a whole, the Temple's location is obviously connected with the location of the Holy of Holies. The location of the Temple was even a question less than 150 years after the Second Temple's destruction, as detailed in the [[Talmud]]. Chapter 54 of the [[Berakhot (tractate)|Tractate Berakhot]] states that the Holy of Holies was directly aligned with the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]], which would have placed the Holy of Holies slightly to the north of the Dome of the Rock, as Kaufman postulated.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.54a.7?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi Berakhot 54a:7]</ref> However, chapter 54 of the [[Yoma|Tractate Yoma]] and chapter 26 of the [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Tractate Sanhedrin]] asserts that the Holy of Holies stood directly on the [[Foundation Stone]], which agrees with the consensus theory that the Dome of the Rock stands over the Holy of Holies.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.54b.2?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi Yoma 54b:2]</ref><ref>[https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.26b.5?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi Sanhedrin 26b:5]</ref>

The [[Crusades|Crusaders]] associated the Holy of Holies with the [[Well of Souls]], which is located under the [[Foundation Stone]] of the [[Dome of the Rock]].<ref name=secrets/> Most [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] today completely avoid climbing up to [[Temple Mount]], to prevent them from accidentally stepping on the ''Most Holy Place'' or any sanctified areas.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} A few Orthodox Jewish authorities, following the opinion of the medieval scholar [[Maimonides]], permit Jews to visit parts of the Temple Mount known not to be anywhere near any of the sanctified areas. Orthodox Jewish visitors to the Temple Mount, who come especially from those groups associated with the [[Temple Institute]] and its efforts to rebuild a [[Third Temple|Temple]], seek to conform to the minimal requirements for coming near the Temple, such as immersing in a [[mikvah]] ("collection of water"), not coming during or following [[niddah|menstruation]] or immediately following a [[semen|seminal emission]], not showing their back towards its presumed location, and other strictures.

To avoid religious conflict, Jewish visitors caught praying or bringing ritual objects are usually expelled from the area by police.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Nadav |last=Shragai

==In apocryphal literature==

According to the ancient [[apocrypha]]l ''[[Lives of the Prophets]]'', after the death of [[Zechariah ben Jehoiada]], the priests of the Temple could no more, as before, see the apparitions of the [[angels]] of the Lord, nor could make [[divination]]s with the [[Ephod]], nor give responses from the ''[[Debir]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.summascriptura.com/html/Lives_of_the_Prophets_Torrey.html |title=The Lives of the Prophets - Zechariah son of Jehoiada |access-date=2016-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301192214/http://www.summascriptura.com/html/Lives_of_the_Prophets_Torrey.html |archive-date=2016-03-01 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Christianity==

===New Testament===
The Greek New Testament retains the pre-Christian Septuagint phrase "Holy of the Holies" ''hágion ''([[Singular number|sg]] [[Neuter gender|n]])'' tōn hagíōn'' ({{lang|grc|ἅγιον τῶν ἁγίων}})<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWEESjS8bg4C&pg=PA514|title=Ezekiel|isbn=978-9004177130|last1=Olley|first1=John W.|year=2009}}</ref> without the definite article as "Holies of Holies" ''hágia ''([[Plural number|pl]] [[neuter gender|n]])'' hagíōn'' ({{lang|grc|ἅγια ἁγίων}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/bible/heb009.htm|title=NEW ADVENT BIBLE: Hebrews 9|work=newadvent.org}}</ref> in Hebrews 9:3. In the [[Vulgate]], these are rendered as ''sanctum sanctorum'' and ''sancta sanctorum'', respectively. The Greek language was the common language upon Hellenization of much of the Middle East after the death of Alexander the Great, and the division of his empire among four generals. The Jews of the Diaspora spoke it. The Latin Vulgate of St. Jerome was a faithful translation for Christian Rome.

===Christian traditions===
Certain branches of [[Christianity]], including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] continue to have a tradition of a Holy of Holies which they regard as a [[Most sacred sites|most sacred site]]. The [[ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]], a permanent canopy over the altar in some churches, once surrounded by curtains at points in the [[liturgy]], symbolizes the Holy of Holies. Some Christian churches, particularly the [[Catholic Church]], consider the [[Church tabernacle]], or its location (often at the rear of the sanctuary), as their symbolic equivalent of the Holy of Holies, due to the storage of consecrated host in that vessel.

====Eastern Orthodox Church====
{{main|iconostasis}}
The Greek phrase refers to the Tabernacle or Temple. The name in [[Greek language|Greek]] for the sanctuary of a church is '''{{lang|grc|Ἱερόν Βῆμα}}''' (''Hieron Vema'', see [[Bema#Christianity]]), in [[Russian language|Russian]] it is called '''Святой Алтарь''' (''Svyatoy Altar'' – literally: "Holy Altar"), and in Romanian it is called ''Sfântul Altar''.

====Ethiopian Orthodox Church====
A [[cognate]] term in [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] is found in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]]: ''Qidduse Qiddusan'', referring to the innermost sanctuary of an Orthodox Christian church, where the [[tabot]] is kept and only clergy may enter. This is also called the "Bete Mekdes. Every Ethiopian Orthodox Church has one, and it is covered with a Curtain. There are Three ways to enter (most of the time) and those three doors are also a way to reveal the Holy Trinity. In the middle there is always an Altar where the Church's [[Tabot]] is kept. There can be as many altars as the number of Tabots."<ref>Stuart C. Munro-Hay, ''Ethiopia, the unknown land: a cultural and historical guide'', (London: I.B.Tauris, 2002). p. 50</ref>

====Malabar Nasrani tradition====
[[File:A Syro Malabar Catholic Church or Nasrani Palli.JPG|thumb|250px|A church of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] in [[Kerala]], [[South India]] still following the [[Jewish Christian]] tradition of keeping the Holy of Holies veiled by a red curtain in the tradition of the [[Ancient Temple of Jerusalem]], much like their [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] counterparts viz. the [[Malankara Jacobite Syriac Orthodox Church]] and the [[Indian Orthodox Church]].]]

The [[Saint Thomas Christians]] (also known as Nasrani or Syrian Christians) from [[Kerala]], [[South India]] still follow much [[Jewish Christian]] tradition.<ref name= "Ross">Ross, Israel J. (1979). "Ritual and Music in South India: Syrian Christian Liturgical Music in Kerala". ''Asian Music''. 11 (1): 80–98.</ref> In Nasrani tradition the Holy of Holies is kept veiled for much of the time. The red veil covers the inner altar or the main altar. It is unveiled only during the central part of the main Nasrani ritual. The main ritual of the Saint Thomas Christians is the [[Qurbana]] (derived from the Syriac word "Qurobo" meaning "sacrifice").<ref name="Ross"/>

====Roman Catholic Church====

The Latin [[Vulgate]] Bible translates ''Qṓḏeš HaqQŏḏāšîm'' as [[Sanctum sanctorum]] (Ex 26:34). Reproducing in Latin the Hebrew construction, the expression is used as a superlative of the neuter adjective ''sanctum'', to mean "a thing most holy". It is used by Roman Catholics to refer to holy objects beyond the Holy of Holies, and is specifically often used as an alternative name for a [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]], due to the object being a storage chamber for [[Sacramental bread|consecrated host]] and thus where the presence of God is most represented.

The [[Vulgate]] also refers to the Holy of Holies with the plural form ''Sancta sanctorum'' (2 Chr 5:7), arguably a [[synecdoche]] referring to the holy objects hosted there. This form is also used more broadly in Catholic tradition with reference to sanctuaries other than the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. A notable example is for the [[Sancta Sanctorum|Chiesa di San Lorenzo in Palatio ad Sancta Sanctorum]], a chapel in the complex of [[St John Lateran]] in Rome.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
{{Main|Holy of Holies (LDS Church)}}
The [[Salt Lake Temple]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) contains a Holy of Holies wherein the church's [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]]—acting as the Presiding High Priest—enters to fulfill the relationship between the High Priest of Israel and God in accordance with the LDS Church's interpretation of the [[Book of Exodus]] ({{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Exodus|chapter=25|verse=22}}) and Latter-day Saint religious texts.

'''Seventh-Day Adventist Church'''

[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-Day Adventism]] (SDA) believes that the [[Holy of Holies]] on Earth was a copy of the true [[tabernacle]] in [[heaven]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.andrews.edu/~damsteeg/pion.html|title=How Our Pioneers Discovered the Sanctuary Doctrine|last=Damsteegt|first=P.
