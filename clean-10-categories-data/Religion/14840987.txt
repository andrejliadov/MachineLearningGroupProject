'''Indigenous religions''' is a category used in the [[Religious studies|study of religion]] to demarcate the [[religion|religious]] belief systems of communities described as being "[[indigenous people|indigenous]]". This category is often juxtaposed against others such as the "[[world religions]]" and "[[new religious movements]]". The term is commonly applied to a range of different belief systems across the Americas, Australasia, Asia, Africa, and Northern Europe, particularly to those practiced by communities living under the impact of [[colonialism]].

The term "indigenous religions" is usually applied to the localised belief systems of small-scale societies. These belief systems do not typically engage in proselytization, thus distinguishing them from movements like [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Buddhism]] that all seek converts and which are typically classified as "world religions"; unlike [[Judaism]], even though it’s often referred to as a “world religion”.  They are also often characterised as being distinct from the "world religions" because they are orally transmitted, intertwined with [[tradition]]al lifestyles, and [[Religious pluralism|pluralist]]. Numerically, the majority of the world's religions could be classed as "indigenous", although the number of "indigenous religionists" is significantly smaller than the number of individuals who practice one of the "world religions".

Within the study of religion there has been much debate as to what the scope of the category should be, largely arising from debates over what the term "indigenous" should best encompass. For instance, the Japanese religion of [[Shinto]] is often referred to as an "indigenous religion" although, because the Japanese are not a colonised society but have colonised neighbouring societies like that of the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], there is debate as to whether they meet the definition of "indigenous". In some cases, practitioners of new religions like [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]] have sought to present theirs as "indigenous religions" although have faced scepticism from scholars of religion.

==Definition==

The [[Religious studies|academic study of religions]] has used three concepts through which to categorise different religious groups: "[[world religions]]", "[[new religious movements]]", and "indigenous religions".{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=6}} The scholar of religion Carole M. Cusack noted that "indigenous religions" were rejected from the "world religions" category because they "are typically this-wordly, orally transmitted, non-proselytizing, folk-oriented, expressed in myths and traditional law, and pluralist."{{sfn|Cusack|2016|p=154}}

According to the scholar of religion Graham Harvey, indigenous religions constitute the majority of the world's religions.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=3}} At the same time, he noted that "indigenous religionists" do not numerically make up the majority of religious people.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=3}}

Some indigenous religions have gained as much global visibility as some of the "world religions".{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=4}} For instance, musicians influenced by the belief systems of the [[Māori people|Maori]], Indigenous Australian, and Canadian First Nations peoples have had their work exposed to an international audience.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=4}}

The Japanese religion [[Shinto]] is often described as an "indigenous religion", although the scholar of [[Asian studies]] John K. Nelson noted that it is often left "unclear" as to what is meant by the term "indigenous" in this context.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=7}} He noted, for example, that there remain debates as to when the ancestors of the Japanese arrived in the islands that now make up Japan and that there were other communities, such as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]], who lived on some of these islands before them.{{sfn|Nelson|1996|p=7}}

Although often referred to as one of the "three religions", mainly due to [[Eurocentrism]] and [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewashing]], [[Judaism]] is one of the best examples of an "indigenous religion". Specifically, it is an [[Ethnic religion]] by classification. The [[Jewish People]] follow a land-based faith, and isn't a faith that crosses borders like [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], but rather its a faith that the [[Jewish People]] brought with them to preserve their identity following the many [[Jewish diaspora]]s. Most notably, the Roman exile of the [[Jews]] following the destruction the [[Second Temple]] in [[70 CE]]. The [[Hebrew calendar]] follows the agricultural cycle of the land of [[Judea]] (modern day [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]]). In the times of the [[Second Temple]], the [[613 commandments]] of the [[Torah]], are binding to all [[Jews]], and of which a vast majority of them (about 4/5) can only be done in the land of [[Eretz Israel]]. By the authority of the [[Gedolim]], most of these land-centric laws must still be kept by [[Jews]] living in the Diaspora. [[Jews]] pray an average of three times a day: [[Shacharit]], [[Mincha]], and [[Maariv]]. During these services, [[Jews]] must pray facing [[Zion]], and pray for the coming of [[Moshiach]] and the return to [[Zion]] ([[Jerusalem]]).

Many followers of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], a [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] religion that scholars recognise as a new religious movement, like to regard their belief system as an "indigenous religion".{{sfnm|1a1=Snook|1y=2015|1p=145|2a1=Gregorius|2y=2015|2p=74}} In claiming a sense of indigeneity, some Heathens—particularly in the United States—attempt to frame themselves as the successors to the pre-Christian belief systems of linguistic Germanic communities in Northern Europe and thus victims of Medieval Christian [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]]. The scholars Jenifer Snook, Thad Horrell, and Kirsten Horton argued that in doing so, these Heathens ignore the fact that most of them are [[white people|white]], and thus members of the same ethnic community which has perpetrated and benefitted from colonial and imperial policies against indigenous communities in the Americas and elsewhere.{{sfn|Snook|Horrell|Horton|2017|p=58}}
