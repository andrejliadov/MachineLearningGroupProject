The origins of the megachurch movement, with many local congregants who return on a weekly basis, can be traced to the 1800s.<ref>Anne C. Loveland, Otis B.

== Criticism ==
In 2005, [[Baptist]] Pastor [[Al Sharpton]] criticized megachurches for focusing on "bedroom morals", statements against same-sex marriage and abortion, by ignoring issues of [[social justice]], such as the immorality of war and the erosion of [[affirmative action]].<ref> Associated Press, [https://www.chron.com/life/houston-belief/article/Megachurches-have-wrong-focus-black-leaders-say-1894628.php Megachurches have wrong focus, black leaders say], chron.com, USA, 2 juillet 2006 </ref>

In 2018, American professor Scot McKnight of Northern Baptist Theological Seminary criticized nondenominational megachurches for the weak external accountability relationship of their leaders, by not being members of [[Christian denomination]], further exposing them to abuse of power.<ref> James Wellman Jr., Katie Corcoran, Kate Stockly, Ã‰loi Ficquet, ''High on God: How Megachurches Won the Heart of America'', Oxford University Press, UK, 2020, p. 212 </ref>
