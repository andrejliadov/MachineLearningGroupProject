The persistence of "natural philosophy" in the twentieth century is owing largely to historical references to a past practice (see figure 11).

</ref> In the early 1870s the American science-popularizer Edward Livingston Youmans invited Draper to write a ''History of the Conflict between Religion and Science'' (1874), a book replying to contemporary issues in [[Roman Catholicism]], such as the [[papal infallibility|doctrine of papal infallibility]], and mostly criticizing what he claimed to be [[anti-intellectualism]] in [[Roman Catholicism|the Catholic tradition]],<ref>Alexander, D (2001), ''Rebuilding the Matrix'', Lion Publishing, {{ISBN| 0-7459-5116-3}} (pg. 217)</ref> but also making criticisms of [[Islam]] and of [[Protestantism]].<ref>
"Averroes, in his old age&nbsp;– he died A. D. 1193&nbsp;– was expelled from Spain; the religious party had triumphed over the philosophical. He was denounced as a traitor to religion.  An opposition to philosophy had been organized all over the Mussulman world. There was hardly a philosopher who was not punished." (p142) "The two rival divisions of the Christian Church&nbsp;– Protestant and Catholic&nbsp;– were thus in accord on one point: to tolerate no science except such as they considered to be agreeable to the Scriptures." (p218)

{{wikisource|Popular Science Monthly/Volume 8/February 1876/The Warfare of Science I|"The Warfare of Science"}}
In 1874 White published his thesis in ''[[Popular Science Monthly]]'' and in book form as ''The Warfare of Science'':

{{quotation|In all modern history, interference with science in the supposed interest of religion, no matter how conscientious such interference may have been, has resulted in the direst evils both to religion and to science—and invariably.

</ref>}}

In 1896, White published ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'', the culmination of over thirty years of research and publication on the subject, criticizing what he saw as restrictive, dogmatic forms of [[Christianity]]. In the introduction, White emphasized that he arrived at his position after the difficulties of assisting [[Ezra Cornell]] in establishing a university without any official religious affiliation.

The criticism of White is not entirely recent: historian of medicine [[James Joseph Walsh]] criticized White's perspective as anti-historical in [https://archive.org/details/popesandscience00goog <!-- quote="popes and science". --> ''The Popes and Science; the History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time''] (1908),<ref>Fordam University Press, 1908, Kessinger Publishing, reprinted 2003. {{ISBN|0-7661-3646-9}}  Reviews: [https://books.google.com/books?vid=02tZKPD5CJrIa31EgK&id=G57Y1rlQVP0C&pg=PT2&lpg=PT2&dq=%22the+popes+and+science%22] {{cite journal | pmc = 1407075 | pages=445–447 | volume=49 | issue=3 | journal=Ann Surg | title=The Popes and Science | year=1909 | doi=10.1097/00000658-190903000-00030 | last1=Walsh | first1=James J. }}</ref> which he dedicated to [[Pope Pius X]]:

Only those who know nothing  about the history of medicine and of science continue to harbor it. That Dr. White's book, contradicted as it is so directly by all serious histories of medicine and of science, should have been read by so many thousands in this country, and should have been taken seriously by educated men, physicians, teachers, and even professors of science who want to know the history of their own sciences, only shows how easily even supposedly educated men may be led to follow their prejudices rather than their mental faculties, and emphasizes the fact that the tradition that there is no good that can possibly come out of the Nazareth of the times before the reformation, still dominates the intellects of many educated people who think that they are far from prejudice and have minds perfectly open to conviction.<ref>Walsh, James Joseph, ''The Popes and Science; the History of the Papal Relations to Science During the Middle Ages and Down to Our Own Time'', Fordam University Press, New York 1908, p. 19.</ref>}}

In ''God and Nature'' (1986), [[David C. Lindberg|David Lindberg]] and [[Ronald Numbers]] report that "White's ''Warfare'' apparently did not sell as briskly as Draper's ''Conflict'', but in the end it proved more influential, partly, it seems, because Draper's work was soon dated, and because White's impressive documentation gave the appearance of sound scholarship".<ref>David C.

Numbers, ''God & Nature: Historical Essays on the Encounter Between Christianity and Science'', University of California Press (April 29, 1986)</ref> During the 20th century, historians' acceptance of the conflict thesis declined until fully rejected in the 1970s.

In his course on science and religion, historian Lawrence Principe summarizes Draper's and White's works by saying,
{{quote|While we can look today with astonishment upon the shoddy character of Draper and White's writings, their books have had enormous impact, and we can’t deny that.  Much of this is due to their great success in their creating a myth for science as a religion.  Their myth of science as a religion is replete with battles, and martyrdoms, and saints, and creeds.  And as we know, or should know, myths are often much more powerful than historical realities.<ref name="Principe, Lawrence M. 2006 Lecture 2">{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=Lecture 2}}</ref>}}

In the coursebook, Principe writes,
{{quote|No serious historians of science or of the science–religion issue today maintain the warfare thesis&nbsp;... The origins of the warfare thesis lie in the late 19th century, specifically in the work of two men&nbsp;– John William Draper and Andrew Dickson White.  These men had specific political purposes in mind when arguing their case, and the historical foundations of their work are unreliable.<ref>{{cite book|author=Principe, Lawrence M.|title=Science and Religion|year=2006|publisher=The Teaching Company|page=7}}</ref>}}

Regarding the scholarship of Draper's work, Principe says
{{quotation|How does he [John William Draper] support his contention of conflict?  Well, unfortunately, with some of the worst historical writing you are ever likely to come across.  Historical facts are confected, causes and chronologies twisted to the author’s purpose.  We find interpretations made merely by declaration.  We find quotations violently taken out of context.  And instances, quite a few of them where Draper claims a historical writer said something in fact 180 degrees away from what he actually claimed...Much of Draper’s book is so ridiculous, so malodramatic, so rabid, it’s hard for a knowledgeable person actually to read it without a wry smirk...Let’s start with a simple and a notorious example: the idea that before Columbus people thought that the world was flat.  Well, in fact, it is Draper and White, specifically, both of them, who bear most of the blame for popularizing this baseless view to the extent that nowadays, 80 percent of school teachers still foist this upon poor innocent school children.  The fact is that of course the sphericity of the Earth was well established by the fifth century BC by the Greeks, and a good measure of its circumference made by the third century BC.  And these facts were never forgotten in learned Western Culture.<ref name="Principe, Lawrence M. 2006 Lecture 2"/>}}

Principe's summary comment on Draper's work at the end of his coursebook reads: "The book that started the conflict myth.  Take a sense of humor and/or a stiff drink with this dated bit of melodrama."<ref>
{{cite book|author= Principe, Lawrence M.|title= Science and Religion|year= 2006|publisher= The Teaching Company|page= 79
}}
</ref>

But according to James C. Ungureanu, Draper and White actually hoped their narratives would preserve religious belief, not remove it. For them, science was ultimately a scapegoat for a much older argument that dated back to the Protestant Reformation, where progressive and liberal theologies had their conflict with traditional and orthodox theologies.<ref>{{cite book|author= Ungureanu, C. James|title= Science, Religion, and the Protestant Tradition: Retracing the Origins of Conflict|year= 2019|publisher= Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press}}</ref>

=== Academic ===
Historians of science today have moved away from a conflict model, which is based mainly on two historical episodes (those involving Galileo and Darwin) in favor of a "complexity" model, because religious figures took positions on both sides of each dispute and there was no overall aim by any party involved in discrediting religion.<ref name="glory rich jones">{{cite book|last= Jones|first= Richard H.|title= For the Glory of God : The Role of Christianity in the Rise and Development of Modern Science|year= 2011|publisher= University Press of America|isbn= 9780761855668|pages= 139}}</ref> Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] said: "White's and Draper's accounts of the actual interaction between science and religion in Western history do not differ greatly. Both tell a tale of bright progress continually sparked by science.

Russell]], the former President of [[Christians in Science]], said that "Draper takes such liberty with history, perpetuating legends as fact that he is rightly avoided today in serious historical study. The same is nearly as true of White, though his prominent apparatus of prolific footnotes may create a misleading impression of meticulous scholarship".<ref>Russell, Colin A., "The Conflict of Science and Religion", ''Encyclopedia of the History of Science and Religion'', p. 15, New York 2000</ref>

In ''Science & Religion'', Gary Ferngren proposes a complex relationship between religion and science:

{{quotation|While some historians had always regarded the Draper-White thesis as oversimplifying and distorting a complex relationship, in the late twentieth century it underwent a more systematic reevaluation.  The result is the growing recognition among historians of science that the relationship of religion and science has been much more positive than is sometimes thought.  Although popular images of controversy continue to exemplify the supposed hostility of Christianity to new scientific theories, studies have shown that Christianity has often nurtured and encouraged scientific endeavour, while at other times the two have co-existed without either tension or attempts at harmonization.  If [[Galileo affair|Galileo]] and the [[Scopes trial]] come to mind as examples of conflict, they were the exceptions rather than the rule.<ref>Gary Ferngren (editor).

A few modern historians of science (such as Peter Barker, [[Bernard R. Goldstein]], and Crosbie Smith) proposed that scientific discoveries&nbsp;– such as [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] in the 17th century, and the reformulation of physics in terms of [[energy]], in the 19th century&nbsp;– were driven by religion.<ref>Barker, Peter, and Goldstein, Bernard R.

The Galileo affair is an example commonly used by advocates of the conflict thesis. Maurice Finocchiaro writes that the Galileo affair epitomizes the common view of "the conflict between enlightened science and obscurantist religion," and that this view promotes "the myth that alleges the incompatibility between science and religion." Finocchiaro writes, "I believe that such a thesis is erroneous, misleading, and simplistic," and refers to John Draper, Andrew White, Voltaire, Einstein, Bertrand Russell, and Karl Popper as writers or icons who have promoted it.<ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /> Finocchiaro also describes as mythical the notion that Galileo "saw" the Earth's motion, since this direct observation was only possible in the 21st century, and the idea that Galileo was "imprisoned", since he was "actually held under house arrest."<ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" /> He notes that the situation was complex and objections to the Copernican system included arguments that were philosophical and scientific, as well as theological.<ref name="Trial Galileo Essential" />

The Galileo affair was a sequence of events that begin around 1610,<ref>Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.2). Blackwell ([[#Reference-Blackwell-1991|1991]], p.50) dates the start of the Galileo affair to 1610. Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://archive.org/details/galileoaffair00uisi/page/1 p.1]) puts it a few years later, in 1613.</ref> culminating with the trial and condemnation of [[Galileo Galilei]] by the [[Roman Inquisition|Roman Catholic Inquisition]] in 1633 for his support of [[heliocentrism]].<ref>Finocchiaro ([[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|1989]], [https://archive.org/details/galileoaffair00uisi/page/1 p.1]): "By the 'Galileo affair' is meant the sequence of developments which began in 1613 and culminated with the trial and condemnation of Galileo Galilei by the Roman Catholic Inquisition in 1633."</ref> In 1610, Galileo published his ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]] (Starry Messenger)'', describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [[telescope]], namely the phases of [[Venus]] and the [[Galilean moons]] of Jupiter. With these observations he promoted the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (published in ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' in 1543). Galileo's initial discoveries were met with opposition within the Catholic Church, and in 1616, the Inquisition declared heliocentrism to be formally heretical. Heliocentric books were banned and Galileo was ordered to refrain from holding, teaching or defending heliocentric ideas.<ref name=h218>Heilbron (2010), p.218</ref>

Pope Urban VIII had been an admirer and supporter of Galileo, and there is evidence he did not believe the Inquisition's declaration rendered heliocentrism a heresy. Urban may have rather viewed heliocentrism as a potentially dangerous or rash doctrine that nevertheless had utility in astronomical calculations.<ref name="Trial Galileo Essential">{{cite book|last1=Finocchiaro|first1=Maurice A.|title=The Trial of Galileo : Essential Documents|date=2014|isbn=978-1624661327|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> In 1632, Galileo published his  ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', which implicitly defended heliocentrism, and was popular. Pope Urban VIII had asked that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book, and were voiced by a character named "Simplicio", who was a simpleton.<ref>[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://archive.org/details/galileoonworldsy00gali/page/82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&Wallace-2003|Moss & Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&pg=PA11 p. 11]</ref><ref>See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133–134)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than on Pope Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]].

=== Scientist and public perceptions ===
This thesis is still held to be true in whole or in part by some scientists including the theoretical physicist and cosmologist [[Stephen Hawking]], who said "There is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based on authority, [and] science, which is based on observation and reason. Science will win because it works."<ref>{{cite web|last1=HEUSSNER|first1=KI MAE|title=Stephen Hawking on Religion: 'Science Will Win'|website=ABC News|date=June 7, 2010}}</ref> Others, such as [[Steven Weinberg]], grant that it is possible for science and religion to be compatible since some prominent scientists are also religious, but he sees some significant tensions that potentially weaken religious beliefs overall.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=Lake Views: This World and the Universe|date=2011|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674062306|pages=231–237}}</ref>

A study done on scientists from 21 American universities showed that most did not perceive conflict between science and religion. In the study, the strength of religiosity in the home in which a scientist was raised, current religious attendance, peers' attitudes toward religion, all had an impact on whether or not scientists saw religion and science as in conflict. Scientists who had grown up with a religion and retained that identity or had identified as spiritual or had religious attendance tended to perceive less or no conflict. However, those not attending religious services were more likely to adopt a conflict paradigm. Additionally, scientists were more likely to reject conflict thesis if their peers held positive views of religion.<ref name="scientists religion">{{cite journal|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine Howard|author2=Park, Jerry Z. |title=Conflict Between Religion and Science Among Academic Scientists?|year=2009|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=48|issue=2|pages=276–292|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01447.x}}</ref>

Science historian [[Ronald Numbers]] suggests the conflict theory lingers in a popular belief, inclusive of scientists and clerics alike, and that while history reflects an intrinsic and inevitable intellectual conflict between (Judeo-Christian) religion and science, it is perpetuated by the surrounding controversies involving [[creation–evolution controversy|creation–evolution]], [[stem cell controversy|stem cells]], and [[birth control]].<ref name="numbers">{{cite video | people=[[Ronald Numbers]] (Lecturer) | date=May 11, 2006 | url=http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/Lectures.php | title=Myths and Truths in Science and Religion: A historical perspective | medium=Video Lecture | location=University of Cambridge (Howard Building, Downing College) | publisher=The Faraday Institute for Science and Religion | access-date=March 13, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514112643/http://www.st-edmunds.cam.ac.uk/faraday/Lectures.php | archive-date=May 14, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Many religious groups have made statements regarding the compatibility of religion and science,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ncse.com/media/voices/religion|title=Statements from Religious Organizations|date=2008-09-08|work=NCSE|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}</ref> urging, for example, "school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge.
