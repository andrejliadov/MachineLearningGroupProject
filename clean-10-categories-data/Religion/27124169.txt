==History==
Lighthouse Trails was founded in 2002 by David and Deborah Dombrowski from [[Silverton, Oregon]]. They decided to start the company as an [[apologetics]] outreach in hopes of exposing what they saw as the dangers of the [[Emerging church]] and the [[Contemplative prayer]] movement.<ref>[http://www.lighthousetrails.com/aboutus.htm About Us - LighthouseTrails.com]</ref> Their research project, named Lighthouse Trails Research, in turn received criticism from [[Moody Bible Institute]] regarding certain areas of belief in the emerging church movement.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Moody Responds to Lighthouse Trails |url=http://www.moodyministries.net/crp_NewsDetail.aspx?id=7080 |quote=Moody Bible Institute recently became aware of certain assertions made about the Institution by Lighthouse Trails Research Project. |publisher=[[Moody Bible Institute]] |date=September 17, 2007 |accessdate=March 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223140931/http://www.moodyministries.net/crp_NewsDetail.aspx?id=7080 |archivedate=December 23, 2011 }} - Archived via [[Archive.org]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/6474712474.html|title=Converge Worldwide (Baptist General Conference)/Bethel University and Seminary Push Questionable Doctrinal Practices|date=Dec 16, 2009|accessdate=March 3, 2015|publisher=ChristianNewsWire}}</ref>
