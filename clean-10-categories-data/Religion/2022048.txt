'''Ayya Vaikundar''' (c.1833&ndash;c.1851; {{lang-ta|அய்யா வைகுண்டர்}}), also called '''Sriman Narayana Vaikundaswamy''', is the tenth [[Vishnu#Avatars|avatar]] or [[Incarnation#Hinduism|incarnation]] of [[Vishnu]] who worked for the upliftment of downtrodden people in the Kingdom of [[Travancore]] while in human form in the 19th century. He is central to the [[Hindu denominations|Hindu denomination]] of [[Ayyavazhi]], as per the holy scripture, [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]].

== Early avatars ==
{{Ayyavazhi}}
[[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] says, whenever the yuga ages and major injustice happens, [[God]] appears as incarnations to establish [[dharma]] by destroying [[adharma]].

At the beginning of Universe, [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s gathered in Kailasa and had Amrutham. After having, devas asked [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]], do we have any enemies. To answer this, [[Shiva]] lights an ''[[agni kunda]]'' and went himself into it and sang ''vedakandam'' with dance. After completion when he returned from agni kunda, a deadly monster called Kroni (Asura or evil force) was also born inside an agni kunda. After few days, the evil force kroni was trying to destroy Kailasa in order to kill devas. To save devas, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] took a penance to get grace of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] to destroy Kroni. Lord Shiva appeared and said to [[Vishnu|Narayana]], "Kroni should be cut in six pieces”. In doing so, every piece of him will be born as a monster on the earth, and you will have to incarnate to destroy the other demons.

[[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] consents and chops Kroni into six pieces in [[Neetiya Yuga|Neetiya yuga]]. Accordingly, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] incarnated by the Yuga-Yugas in order to protect the Dharma. So, he appeared in the [[Chathura Yukam|Chathur Yuga]] and the [[Netu Yukam|Netu Yuga]] by destroying the asuras such as Gundomasali, Thillai Mallalan, and Mallossy Vaughan that emerged from Kroni's chunk. Later in the [[Kretha Yukam|Kretha Yuga]], Lord incarnated as [[Kartikeya|Muruga]], [[Narasimha]] and [[Rama|Sri Rama]] in the [[Thretha Yukam|Thretha Yuga]] to destroy the Asuras such as Singamukha Suran, Surapathman, Iranian, and [[Ravana]]. In the [[Dvapara Yuga]] Lord incarnated as [[Krishna|Sri Krishna]] to destroy the Asuras such as [[Duryodhana]], Takkan and helped the [[Pandava]]s to establish the Dharma by establishing the [[Pandava]]s Kingdom again. Kroni was refused to listen [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]’s council, whenever he was born and destroyed. [[Vishnu|Lord narayana]] was angry on this and last said to kroni "You will die because of yourself”. Then, at the end of Dvapara Yuga, Lord was known that Kailyan will come, that is the reason he had led the route of forest, while on the way he had taken back the powers of [[pandava]]s and left his body on top of the hill and left this world.

== Legend ==
{{Main|Vishnu}}
Whenever [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] incarnates, he gives the details in scriptures about his incarnation. The [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] is the divine scripture, which gives the details of tenth incarnation of [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] in form of Vaikundar.

Yes, to understand [[Rama|Rama Avatara]], [[Ramayana]] was provided to the world. For [[Krishna|Krishna Avatara]], [[Mahabharata|Mahabharatha]] was written. To know about Vaikunta Avatara, [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] was provided to mankind. [[Vedas]], [[puranas]], [[Itihasa]]s, and also according to the predictions in other religions, to end the cruelties of Kali Yuga and to protect the world, [[Vishnu|Narayana]] appeared as Vaikuntar.

[[Ayyavazhi]] scripture [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] gives the world's historical and mythological events. It also gives prophecy of the avatars of [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] and his coming along with extensive quantity of historical facts. This holy book focus on the “supreme oneness” and narrates the events starting from the creation of the Universe. It also explains us what has happened so far and what is going to happen next. This holy book was compiled by his fifth citar - [[Hari Gopalan Citar|Hari Gopalan]] on Kollam Year 1016 at 27th day of Tamil Month Karthikai (10 December 1841 CE, Friday). [[Hari Gopalan Citar|Hari Goplan]] received holy Apostle from Lord in his dream, which commissioned him to write the [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] by giving him the first syllable - “The Kappu”.

== Ayyavazhi beliefs ==

===Lord Ayya Vaikundar Avatar===
Ayyavazhi followers believe that [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] itself incarnated as Lord Ayya Vaikundar during an encounter with a deity [[Lakshmi|Goddess Lakshmi]].

As per [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]], by the words of the devas, the [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] gave birth to the [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan (Asura)]], that emerged from last and sixth piece of Kroni's chunk. The [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]] begun, when the Kaliyan was born. Kroni’s fifth chunk [[Duryodhana]] in the previous yuga was transmigrated as [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] in [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]]. After his birth, he received much boon from [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]], which had more powers compared to the powers of the [[Asura]] of previous yuga’s. His Powers included reign of the King, various tricks, long life tricks and the Lord’s Chakrayuta. When [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] was on the way to earth, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] in the form of Pantaram (Monk) stopped him and challenged him for fight. [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] ignored by saying, “I have lot of powers, If I fight with you, my wife will laugh!”. In response, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] asked him to promise - "Going forward he won't fight or disrupt any Pantaram”. [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] agreed and gave the promise – “I will never fight or disrupt any Pantaram, If I will do so, will lose everything and will go to hell". [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] says, this is the reason behind [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]’s tenth avatar in [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]] as Narayana Pantaram.

It is said that this [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] became the king of earth in various places and tortured the lives of the good people. He created various caste system in order to divide and rule. Collected heavy taxes from public, That is to say, from feather to Mangalasutra, he put heavy taxes and tortured the people lives. Due to this, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] got angry and advised [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] to stop torturing the people who are innocent by mind and heart. However, he did not agree and preferred death rather than giving up. As per the [[vedas]] of [[Vyasa|sage Vyasa]], In order to stop the rule of [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] and to bring an end to this [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]], [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] planned to make Vaikundar incarnate as Pantaram.

When the day came, In [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]], the [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] himself incarnated as Vaikundar during an encounter with a deity [[Lakshmi|Goddess Lakshmi]], he was beget inside the sea and arose from the sea of [[Thiruchendur|Tiruchendur]] on Kollam Year 1008 at 20th day of Tamil Month Masi (1st March 1833 CE, Friday). He took the human form as Pantaram at Tharuvaiyur near seashore, this is considered a unique avatar in ayyavazhi mythology. Then he started walking towards [[Detchanam]]. This place became a holy place for the devotees of [[Ayyavazhi Mythology|Ayyavazhi]] and they erected a temple there named [[Avatharappathi]]. This event is celebrated during the festival of [[Ayya vaikundar avataram|Ayya Vaikundar Avataram]]. From the point of incarnation of Vaikundar, it is said that he will destroy [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] and the evil in [[Kali Yuga]]. It is also said that he will take all righteous people along with him in the succeeding eighth yuga called as [[Dharma Yukam|Dharma yuga]].

Lord Ayya Vaikundar, who arose from the sea at [[Thiruchendur]] ''(per [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]])'' on 20th of the [[Tamil Calendar|Tamil Month of Masi]] (1_March_1833 CE, Friday) is considered a unique [[avatar]] by the followers of Ayyavazhi. [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilam]], speaks about it in great detail, as summarized below:

I (Hari Gopalan) am writing these words of [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]] with the grace of God!

“ ‘O’ Lord you took avatar for [[Pandava]]s and eliminated their enemies.

    You attained the abode of Kailasa with anger due to birth of [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]].

     Came again to the world to protect santror (good people) and dharma”

“On Masi 1008, I ([[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]) myself appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea, have taken residence in Theksanapuri as Vaikundar” – [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]]

[[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] says, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] himself incarnated as Vaikundar and appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayya vazhi and they erected a temple there named [[Avathara Pathi|Avathara pathi]].

God says this prophecy,

"I ([[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]) took the avatar for yuga trail and became the praise child for Sita.

As a king of Dharma yuga, I am going to rule the world with single command" – [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]]

In each of the five [[yuga]]s prior to the avatar of Lord Ayya Vaikundar, as each fragment of [[Kroni]] (evil or Devil) came into physical form, the Lord [[Vishnu]] incarnated as well, destroying them. However, in this the sixth yuga, the evil was called [[Kalineesan|Kali (कलि)]] (n''ot the Hindu deity''),{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=206}} and having no physical form (see [[Pre-Incarnational Events]] for this account) he occupied the mind of people of earth as the Mayai (illusion), causing them to behave discourteously.  [[Kalineesan|Kaliyan]] claimed, it was impossible to destroy him by the use of weapons in this [[yuga]] as in the previous ones as he held the [[Wiktionary:boon|boon]] from Supreme god Shiva, that is the reason [[Vishnu|Lord Narayan]], to incarnate as "pandaram" in the world to destroy him.

In the name of Vaikundar, Lord came towards [[Swamithope|Swamithopu]] as Pantaram. [[Lord Vaikundar]] as a Pantaram, had donned himself in squalid rags, smeared the white mark on forehead, tied a turban on his head and carried a cane. Upon reaching [[Swamithope|Swamithopu]], he undertook a penance for 6 years to get grace and power of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]. He got the power to abolish the rule of the evil force [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] from the world and for the subsequent end of [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]]. Lord did many mighty miracles. These include, curing all the diseases for those people who came to get blessing from him. He baught eighteen-caste people together for peace and equality. [[Lord Vaikundar]] had five disciples (Citars). According to [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]], the [[Pandava]]s of previous [[Dvapara Yuga]] were made to take birth in this [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]] as [[Seedars|Citars]] of Vaikundar. The holy book [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] was compiled by his fifth citar - [[Hari Gopalan Citar|Hari Gopalan]] alias [[Sahadeva]].

According to Akilam, Vaikundar is 10th avatar of [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]], also popularly called as “Narayana Pantaram” or “[[Kalki]]” alias “Ayya”. Lord's avatar happens to be next to his [[Krishna]] avatar. In this avatar, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] incarnated as “Trimurti” alias “[[Harihara|Siva Narayana]]”. He had supreme power for the responsibility to destroy the evil of [[Kali|Kali (कलि)]].

Another view is that [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] did not take a human body and showed only a bodily appearance{{sfn|Thuvarakapathi|p=37}} to mankind based upon quotes in Akilam.{{sfn|Pathippakam|2004|p=112}}

===Tavam===
{{Main|Tavam of Vaikundar}}

Upon reaching Poovantanthoppe, (present-day [[Swamithope]]), he undertook a penance. The penance consisted of three stages, each spanning two years. A tradition describes his postures during the six-year tavam as follows: during the first two years, he stood inside a six feet deep pit; during the next two years, he squatted on the ground; and during the last two years, he sat on a raised platform. His appearance was squalid, "long and entangled plait of hair" and frayed clothes. He spoke less and subsisted on frugal meals.<ref>{{harvnb|Patrick|2003|p=79}} ''He seems to have spoken less and subsisted on frugal meals.''</ref>

===Supernatural Abilities===
[[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] speaks of his incineration of evil spirits as an important event in Lord Ayya Vaikundar's incarnation. It took place when he was performing his penance, which he had announced to be the means of destroying the [[kalimayai]] - the illusory evil force. He gathered the people and caused some of them, both male and female, to be possessed of the evil spirits (peyattam).{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=80}} The possessed ones danced in front of the crowd as if the evil spirits had come upon them. Vaikundar, then, ordered these evil spirits to make an oath, in front of the people, to surrender their powers and incinerate themselves. When he had finished his orders, the dancers fell flat on the ground and burned.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p=254-260}}

Similarly, Vaikundar performed another action to 'seize the esoteric evil powers'. [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] says that he took away the powers of those who knew to perform witchcraft, sorcery  and other magical rituals. People living in the hills, called as Kanikkarar, were believed to be powerful [[shaman]]s, having powers to contain or to provoke the demons. Vaikundar, in a trance, made some of them testify that they had surrendered their powers. People grew appreciative of Ayya's actions. They began addressing him as Vaikuntasami. This implied an attribution of divinity to Vaikundar.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=80}} [[Vaikundar]] exhorted the people as follows:

<blockquote>
There are no demons, no devils.'' No ill effects of magical practices,<br />
No disease, no pain  and no extortion of taxes,<br />
And, therefore, live courageously.''
</blockquote>

===Five Citars===
Lord Vaikundar has five disciples (citars). According to holy scripture [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu Ammanai]] the [[Pandavas]] of previous [[Dwapara Yukam]] was made to take birth in this [[Kali Yukam]] as [[Seedars|Citars]] of Vaikundar. They are [[Dharma Citar]], [[Bhima Citar]], [[Arjunan Citar]], [[Nakulan Citar]] and [[Sakatevan Citar]].

==Vaikundar as Narayana Pandaram==
[[File:Ayya Vaikundar Avatar.jpg|thumb|Vaikundar as Narayana Pantaram]]
The fame of Vaikundar began to spread in the countries of [[Travancore]] and [[Tirunelveli]]  and he was gradually recognised as a religious person with extraordinary powers.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=81}} He was addressed as a [[Pantaram]], a religious person hailing from  and serving the ordinary folk. [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] addresses him as Narayana Pantaram.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p=253}}

People came to listen to his teachings and instructions, to be cured by him of different diseases, to witness, worship and serve a religious person. Vaikundar encouraged the people to come together around a well to take a ritual bath, irrespective of caste. He encouraged them to dine together in his presence.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p=251}}[[File:Ayya's Holy Perambu and Surai koodu.jpg|thumb|right|The things used by Vaikundar; 'Surai Koodu', 'Pirambu' and 'Thandayam'.]]He stressed that he had come to abolish [[Kali Yukam]]  and to usher in an age of [[Dharma Yukam]], when the now-oppressed and suffering people would be liberated and rule the land under his leadership. 'Uplift of the lowly is dharmam’{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p= 212}} was a constant refrain in his teachings.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=81}} People were encouraged to serve as catalysts for the destruction of [[Kaliyan|Kali]] by transforming themselves to be 'people of [[Dharma Yukam]]' and to acquire a new character. The new character would come upon them, he said, if they learned to live with self-respect, social dignity and fearlessness. Underscoring the importance of self-respect and social dignity, he said,  ‘if one lives with dignity and self-respect, the kali would destroy itself’ .   He said when people grew out of kalimayai, [[Dharma Yukam]] would unfold and in that age, he would rule over the people as [[Dharma Raja]], the king of [[Dharma Yukam]].

According to the legend as per holy akilam, when [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] was born, he got the boon from Supreme god [[Shiva]], which has more powers than compare to which he got on previous yuga's. When he was on the way to earth, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] was in the form of Pantaram stopped him and asked him to fight with. When [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] was ignored, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] asked him to promise, "going forward i won't fight or distrupt any Pantaram. If i will do so, will lose everything  and will go to hell".

That is the reason [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] has taken his tenth avatar on this [[Kali Yuga|kali yuga]] as Narayana Pantaram. 
{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=81}}

==Arrest and imprisonment==
{{See also|Ayyavazhi mythology#Vaikundar.27s trial|l1=Vaikundar's Trial}}
He made some controversial statements like mentioning the [[travancore]] king as ‘Devil in Ananthapuri’ and the British rule as ‘Rule of White Devils’. Against the background of the growing popularity of Vaikundar  and the convergence of people around him in multitudes, a complaint was lodged against him with the [[Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma|king of Travancore]]. The [[Travancore]] king Swathi thirunal arrested Vaikundar in 1838 and imprisoned him at Singarathoppu jail in Travancore. After 110 days of imprisonment, on March 26, 1839 he was released by Swathithirunal on the advise of Thycaud Ayya who was the Guru of Swathi thirunal Maharaj and a disciple of Vaikundar as well.

==Post-imprisonment ==
After returning from the prison, Vaikundar inspired a group of his devotees to undertake a religious exercise called [[Thuvayal Thavasu]].{{sfn|Nadar|1989|pp= 290-298}}{{sfn|LMS Report|1838|p=71}} He also performed miracles. He married [[Saptha Kanniyar]] as [[Narayana]]r (see: [[Ayyavazhi mythology#Marriage with the Seven Virgins|Marriage with the Seven Virgins]]), the [[Seven deities]] in the form of [[Ekam]] (see:[[Ayyavazhi mythology#Marriage with the Deities|Marriage with the Deities]]). He initiated festivities (see: [[Ayyavazhi mythology#Festivals and celebrations|Festivals and Celebrations]])." The deities were made to 'come upon' some of the female devotees who became their human media  and a marriage ceremony was performed.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p= 336-338}} Ceremonial processions were held amidst singing, incantations and shouts of joy by the followers. Several rites and rituals were instituted during these occasions.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=83}}

==Lord Ayya Vaikundar at Vaikundam==
{{Further|Ayyavazhi mythology#Ascending to Vaikundam.}}

Later [[Lord Vaikundar]] was invited by his devotees to their homes and treated in a grand manner. By way of soliciting his blessings, his devotees carried him to different places. During these occasions, he laid foundations in various places for small shrine-like centres, called [[Nizhal Thangal]]s. [[Lord Vaikundar]] came to recognize five individuals as his closest disciples. Through one of his disciples, [[Hari Gopalan Citar]], he wrote the holy book, called [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|''Akilam'']].{{sfn|Pathippakam|2004|p=4}}

[[Lord Vaikundar]] returned to Vaikundam on 3 June 1851. According to Ayyavazhi followers, he has returned to Vaikundam.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p=}} However, this date is disputed, as Samuel Mateer mentions the year as 1848.{{sfn|Mateer|1871|p=222}} As he returned to Vaikundam, with his body he went to vaikundam and he does thavam in the rathina throne which made of 32 (அறம்) law , so in that holy land  made a pati (temple)  was later built. His devotees continued to visit this site  and performed the rituals as they used to do when Vaikundar was bodily present. His life and works remain the foundation of the Ayyavazhi. The head temple of the Ayyavazhi religion is the [[Swamithoppepathi]] and is located in the Village of [[Swamithope]].

==Popular culture==
The film ''[[Ayyavazhi (film)|Ayyavazhi]]'' released in 2008 was based on the life of Lord Vaikundar.
