'''Jewish identity''' is the objective or subjective state of [[Identity (social science)|perceiving oneself]] as a Jew and as relating to being [[Jews|Jewish]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=87sx1v9UmlQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=jewish+identity&sig=uWlgMwXei1dyZFhqvXV3RxvWK3I ''Spinoza, Liberalism, and the Question of Jewish Identity'']. [[Yale University Press]], 1997.</ref> Under a broader definition, Jewish identity does not depend on whether a person is regarded as a Jew by others, or by an external set of religious, or legal, or sociological norms. Jewish identity does not need to imply religious orthodoxy.  Accordingly, Jewish identity can be [[Cultural Judaism|cultural]] in nature. Jewish identity can involve ties to the Jewish community.  Orthodox Judaism bases Jewishness on matrilineal descent. According to Jewish law ([[halacha]]), all those born of a Jewish mother are considered Jewish, regardless of personal beliefs or level of observance of Jewish law.

[[Atheist Jew|Jews who are atheists]] or Jews who follow other religions ([[Christianity]], etc) may have a Jewish identity. While the absolute majority of people with this identity are of Jewish ethnicity, people of a [[Who is a Jew?#"Half-Jewish"|mixed Jewish and non-Jewish background]] or [[gentiles]] of [[Zera Yisrael|Jewish ancestry]] may still have a sense of Jewish self-identity.

==Components==
Jewish identity can be described as consisting of three interconnected parts:

#'''[[Jewish peoplehood]]''', an ethnic identity composed of [[Jewish ethnic divisions|several subdivisions]] that [[ethnogenesis|evolved]] in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]].<ref>Peoplehood Now, sponsored by the NADAV Foundation, editors: Shlomi Ravid, Shelley Kedar, Research: Ari Engelberg, Elana Sztokman, Varda Rafaeli, p.11</ref>
#'''[[Judaism|Jewish religion]]''', observance of spiritual and ritual tenets of Judaism.
#'''[[Jewish culture]]''', celebration of traditions, secular and religious alike.

==A cultural/ancestral concept==
Jewish identity can be [[cultural]], religious, or through ancestry.<ref>[[Lawrence Schiffman]], ''Understanding Second Temple and Rabbinic Judaism''. [[KTAV Publishing House]], 2003. p. 3.</ref> There are religious, cultural, and ancestral components to Jewish identity due to its fundamental non-proselytizing nature, as opposed to Christian or Muslim identity which are both "universal" religions in that they ascribe to the notion that their faith is meant to be [[missionary|spread]] throughout all of humanity, regardless of nationality.<ref>Galatians 6:11, Romans 16:22, Colossians 4:18, 2 Thessalonians 3:17</ref> However, Jewish identity is firmly intertwined with Jewish ancestry dating back to the historical [[Kingdom of Israel (United Monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]], which was largely depopulated by the Roman Empire c. first century CE, leading to what is known as today as the [[Jewish Diaspora]].

==In contemporary sociology==
{{see also|Sociology of Jewry}}
Jewish identity began to gain the attention of Jewish sociologists in the United States with the publication of [[Marshall Sklare]]'s "Lakeville studies".<ref>Sklare, Marshall, Joseph Greenblum, and Benjamin Bernard Ringer. The Lakeville Studies. Under the Dir. of Marshall Sklare. Basic books, 1967.</ref> Among other topics explored in the studies was Sklare's notion of a "good Jew".<ref>Sklare, Marshall. "The Image of the Good Jew in Lakeville." Observing America’s Jews. Brandeis University Press, 1993.</ref> The "good Jew" was essentially an idealized form of Jewish identity as expressed by the Lakeville respondents. Today, sociological measurements of Jewish identity have become the concern of the Jewish Federations who have sponsored numerous community studies across the U.S.;<ref>Sheskin, Ira M. "Comparisons between local Jewish community studies and the 2000–01 National Jewish Population Survey." ''[[Contemporary Jewry]]'' 25, no. 1 (2005): 158-192.</ref> policy decisions (in areas such as funding, programming, etc.) have been shaped in part due to studies on Jewish identity.

==Antisemitism and Jewish identity==
According to the social-psychologist Simon Herman, antisemitism plays a part in shaping Jewish identity.<ref>Herman, Simon N. Jewish identity: A social psychological perspective. Transaction Pub, (1989): 51.</ref> This view is echoed by religious leaders such as [[Rabbi]] [[Jonathan Sacks]] who writes that modern Jewish communities and the modern Jewish identity are deeply influenced by [[antisemitism]].<ref>[http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/09/003-love-hate-and-jewish-identity-12 Love, Hate, and Jewish Identity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414202138/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/09/003-love-hate-and-jewish-identity-12 |date=14 April 2012 }}, by Jonathan Sacks. ''First Things'', November 1997.</ref>
