Over the centuries of [[History of Islam|Islamic history]], [[Muslim]] rulers, [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]], and ordinary Muslims have held many different attitudes towards other religions. Attitudes have varied according to time, place and circumstance.

== Non-Muslims and Islam ==
The [[Qur'an]] distinguishes between the monotheistic [[People of the Book]] (''ahl al-kitab''), i.e. [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christians]], [[Sabians]] and others on the one hand and [[polytheism|polytheists]] or [[idol worship|idolaters]] on the other hand'. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} There are certain kinds of restrictions that apply to polytheists but not to "People of the Book" in classical [[Islamic law]]. One example is that Muslim males are allowed to marry a Christian or Jew, but not a polytheist. Muslim women, however, may not marry non-Muslim men.<ref name="Friedmann 2003, p. 35">Friedmann (2003), p. 35</ref>

The Quran told Muslims to discuss the common points between Muslims and non- Muslims. It directs Muslims not to fight with people of the Book.{{cn|date=September 2019}}
.
The idea of Islamic infallibility is encapsulated in the formula, "Islam is exalted and nothing is exalted above it."<ref name="Friedmann 2003, p. 35"/>

[[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Nevi'im|Hebrew prophets]], and [[Jesus]] were all [[prophets of Islam]], but according to Muslim tradition their message and the texts of the [[Torah]] and the [[Gospels]] were [[tahrif|corrupted]].<ref>Friedmann (2003), p. 18</ref>

''And dispute not with the People of the Book, except with means better than mere disputation, unless I be with those of them who inflict wrong and injury, but say to them: "We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; Our God and your God is one; and it is to Him that we bow''.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/35626405/Rights_of_Minorities_under_Islam</ref>

[[Apostasy in Islam]] can be punishable by death and/or imprisonment according to some interpretations but they are only found in [[hadiths]] and there is nothing in the [[Quran]] that commands death penalty for apostate so the issue of apostasy is controversial.<ref>"Murtadd", ''Encyclopedia of Islam'' Quote: "A woman who apostasizes [sic?] is to be executed according to some jurists, or imprisoned according to others."</ref> W. Heffening states that Shafi'is interpret verse {{Quran-usc|2|217}} as adducing the main evidence for the death penalty in Qur'an.<ref name="EI">W. Heffening, in ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]''</ref> Wael Hallaq states the death penalty was a new element added later and "reflects a later reality and does not stand in accord with the deeds of the Prophet." He further states that "nothing in the law governing apostate and apostasy derives from the letter of the holy text." <ref name="EoQ">[[Encyclopedia of the Quran]], Apostasy</ref> There are also interpretations according to which apostates aren't executed nor punished, and there is freedom of religion.

In the 7th century text ''[[John_of_Damascus#Teachings_and_dogmatic_works|Concerning Heresy]]'', the Christian scholar [[Saint John of Damascus]] named Islam as Christological [[heresy in Christianity|heresy]], referring to it as the "heresy of the Ishmaelites".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Griffith |first1=Sidney H. |title=The Church in the Shadow of the Mosque: Christians and Muslims in the World of Islam |date=April 4, 2010 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-14628-7 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IwV2G-A-Oz0C&q=Islam+Christian+heresy+Damascus&pg=PA41}}</ref> The position has remained popular in Christian circles well into the 20th century, by theologians such as the Congregationalist cleric [[Frank Hugh Foster]] and the Roman Catholic historian [[Hilaire Belloc]], the latter of who described it as "the great and enduring heresy of Mohammed."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wismer |first1=Don |title=Routledge Revivals: The Islamic Jesus (1977): An Annotated Bibliography of Sources in English and French |publisher=Routledge |date=September 13, 2016 |quote=The old opinion of John of Damascus continues to persist among Christian orientalists.

== Early Muslim practice ==
During the thirteen years that [[Muhammad]] led his followers against the [[Mecca]] and then against the other [[Arab]] tribes, [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Jew]]ish communities who had submitted to [[Early Muslim conquests|Muslim rule]] were allowed to worship in their own way and follow their own family law, and were given a degree of self-government.

However, the non-Muslim dhimmis were subject to taxation [[jizyah]] at a different rate of the Muslim [[zakat]]. [[Dhimmi]]s also faced economic impediments, restrictions on political participation and/or social advancement based on their non-Muslim status.

Some Jews generally rejected Muhammad's status as a prophet.<ref name="Esp">Esposito, John. 1998. Islam: the Straight Path, extended edition. Oxford university press, p.17</ref> According to Watt, "Jews would normally be unwilling to admit that a [[Gentile|non-Jew]] could be a prophet."<ref name="Camb1">''The Cambridge History of Islam'', pp. 43-44</ref> In the [[Constitution of Medina]], Muhammad demanded the Jews' political loyalty in return for religious and cultural autonomy.<ref name="Esp"/><ref>Jacob Neusner, ''God's Rule: The Politics of World Religions'', p. 153, Georgetown University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-87840-910-6}}</ref> In every major battle with the Medinans, two local Jewish tribes were found to be treacherous (see {{Quran-usc|2|100}}). After [[Battle of Badr|Badr]] and [[Uhud]], the [[Banu Qainuqa]] and [[Banu Nadir]] (the latter being an ethnic Arab tribe who converted to Judaism, according to the Muslim historian [[al-Yaqubi]]), respectively, took up arms against the ummah and were subsequently expelled "with their families and possessions" from Medina.<ref>Esposito, ''Islam: the straight path'', extended edition, Oxford University Press, pp. 10-11</ref>

However, this incident does not imply that Jews in general rejected Muhammad's constitution. One Yemenite Jewish document, found in the [[Cairo Genizah]], claims that many Jews had not only accepted Muhammad as a prophet, but even desecrated [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] in order to join Muhammad in his struggle; historians suggest that this document, called ''Dhimmat an-nabi Muhammad'' (Muhammad's Writ of Protection), may have been fabricated by Yemenite Jews for the purpose of self-defence.<ref>Yakov Rabkin {{cite web |url= http://www.cismor.jp/en/publication/jismor/documents/JISMOR5en_Rabkin.pdf |title= Perspectives on the Muslim Other in Jewish Tradition |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120327204751/http://www.cismor.jp/en/publication/jismor/documents/JISMOR5en_Rabkin.pdf |archive-date= 2012-03-27 }}&nbsp;{{small|(126&nbsp;KB)}}</ref> Still, some Yemeni Jews considered Muhammad a true prophet, including [[Natan'el al-Fayyumi]], a major 12th century rabbi who incorporated various [[Shia]] doctrines into his view of Judaism.

The Syriac [[Patriarch]] [[Ishôyahb III]] wrote in his correspondence to [[Simeon of Rewardashir]], "As for the Arabs, to whom God has at this time given rule (shultãnâ) over the world, you know well how they act toward us. Not only do they not oppose Christianity, but they praise our faith, honour the priests and saints of our Lord, and give aid to the churches and monasteries."<ref>Sidney H. Griffith: [http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol3No1/HV3N1Griffith.html Disputing with Islam in Syriac] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716191151/http://syrcom.cua.edu/hugoye/Vol3No1/HV3N1Griffith.html |date=2006-07-16 }}</ref>

After Muhammad's death in 632, Islamic rule grew rapidly, encompassing what is now the [[Middle East]], [[Egypt]], [[North Africa]], and [[Iran]]. Most of the new subjects were Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian, the first two being considered People of the Book. (After some argument, the [[Zoroastrian]]s were considered People of the Book as well.<ref>[http://www.iranchamber.com/religions/zoroaster_zoroastrians_in_iran.php Zoroaster and Zoroastrians in Iran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122103247/http://www.iranchamber.com/religions/zoroaster_zoroastrians_in_iran.php |date=2005-11-22 }}, by Massoume Price, ''Iran Chamber Society'', retrieved March 24, 2006</ref>) Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians were called ''[[dhimmi]]'', protected persons. As noted above, they could worship, follow their own family law, and own property. People of the Book were not subject to certain Islamic rules, such as the prohibitions on alcohol and pork, but were subject to other restrictions. Under the Islamic state, they were exempt from military service, but were required to pay a [[Tax per head|poll tax]] known as ''[[jizya]]''. (They were, however, exempt from the ''[[zakat]]'' required of Muslims.) They could be bureaucrats and advisors, but they could never be rulers.

== Later Islamic practices ==
Under the [[Ummayad]]s and [[Abbasid]]s, the Islamic community was increasingly fragmented into various sects and kingdoms, each of which had its own evolving policy towards dhimmi and towards conquered polytheists.

===Later Islamic conquests===
{{further|Muslim conquests|Spread of Islam}}

From historical evidence, it appears [[Tokharistan]] was the only area of [[Greater Iran|Iran]] heavily colonized by Arabs, where [[Buddhism]] flourished when they arrived and the only area incorporated into the Arab empire where [[Sanskrit]] studies were pursued up to the conquest. The grandson of Barmak was the ''[[vizier]]'' of the empire and took personal interest in Sanskrit works and Indian religions. When the [[Barmakids]] were removed from power and their influence disappeared, no further translations of Sanskrit works into Arabic is known until that of [[Al-Biruni]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZfWXIfbynwYC&pg=PA47|title=Islam and Tibet - Interactions along the Musk Route|year=2011|publisher=Routlegde|page=46|isbn=9780754669562}}</ref>

With the [[Ghaznavid]]s and later the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], Islam also expanded further into northern [[India]]. [[Will Durant]], in ''[[The Story of Civilization]]'', described this as "probably the bloodiest story in history." This approach was not uniform, and different rulers adopted different strategies. The Mughal emperor [[Akbar]], for example, was relatively tolerant towards Hindus, while his great-grandson [[Aurangzeb]] was heavily intolerant. Hindus were ultimately given the tolerated religious minority status of dhimmi.

The [[Buddhists]] of India were not as fortunate; although Buddhism had been in decline prior to the Muslim invasions, the destruction of monastic universities in the invasions such as [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramashila]] were a calamity from which it never recovered. According to one Buddhist scholar, the monasteries were destroyed because they were large, fortified edifices considered threats by Muslim Turk invaders.

The [[Almohad]] rulers of Muslim [[Spain]] were initially intolerant, and engaged in forced conversions {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}; [[Maimonides]], for example, was forced to masquerade as a Muslim and eventually flee Spain after the initial Almohad conquest.

===Comparative religion and anthropology of religion===
After the Arab conquest of the Buddhist center of Balkh, a Quranic commentator was denounced for anthropomorphism, a standard attack on those sympathetic to Buddhism. [[Hiwi al-Balkhi]] had attacked the authority of Quran and revealed religions, reciting the claims of Zoroastrianism, Christianity and Judaism.<ref name=Starr>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kW8PAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA98|title=Lost Enlightenment: Central Asia's Golden Age from the Arab Conquest to Tamerlane|publisher=Princeton University Press|author=S. Frederick Starr|pages=98–99|year=2013|isbn=9781400848805}}</ref>

In the early 11th century, the Islamic scholar [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] wrote detailed comparative studies on the [[anthropology]] of religions across the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and especially the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Biruni's [[anthropology of religion]] was only possible for a scholar deeply immersed in the lore of other nations.<ref>J. T. Walbridge (1998). "Explaining Away the Greek Gods in Islam", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''59''' (3): 389-403</ref> He carried out extensive, personal investigations of the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]], and was a pioneer in [[comparative religion]] and the anthropology of religion.

According to [[Arthur Jeffery]], "It is rare until modern times to find so fair and unprejudiced a statement of the views of other [[religion]]s, so earnest an attempt to study them in the best sources, and such care to find a method which for this branch of study would be both rigorous and just."<ref name=Watt>{{cite web|author=[[William Montgomery Watt]]|date=2004-04-14|title=BĪRŪNĪ and the study of non-Islamic Religions|url=http://www.fravahr.org/spip.php?article31|accessdate=2008-01-25|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210053854/http://www.fravahr.org/spip.php?article31|archive-date=2009-02-10}}</ref> Biruni compared Islam with pre-Islamic religions, and was willing to accept certain elements of pre-Islamic wisdom which would conform with his understanding of the Islamic spirit.<ref>Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] (1993), ''An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines'', p. 166, [[State University of New York Press]], {{ISBN|0-7914-1516-3}}</ref>

In the introduction to his ''Indica'', Biruni himself writes that his intent behind the work was to engage [[dialogue]] between Islam and the [[Indian religions]], particularly [[Hinduism]] as well as [[Buddhism]].<ref name=Watt/> Biruni was aware that statements about a religion would be open to criticism by its adherents, and insisted that a scholar should follow the requirements of a strictly scientific method. According to [[William Montgomery Watt]], Biruni "is admirably objective and unprejudiced in his presentation of facts" but "selects facts in such a way that he makes a strong case for holding that there is a certain unity in the religious experience of the peoples he considers, even though he does not appear to formulate this view explicitly." Biruni argued that Hinduism was a [[monotheistic]] faith like Islam, and in order to justify this assertion, he quotes [[Hindu texts]] and argues that the worship of [[Cult image|idols]] is "exclusively a characteristic of the common people, with which the educated have nothing to do."<ref name=Watt/>

Biruni argued that the worship of idols "is due to a kind of confusion or corruption."<ref name=Watt/> According to Watt, Biruni "goes on to maintain that in the course of generations the origin of the veneration of the images is forgotten, and further that the ancient legislators, seeing that the Veneration of images is advantageous, made it obligatory for the ordinary. He mentions the view of some people that, before God sent prophets, all mankind were idol-worshippers, but he apparently does not presumably held that, apart from the messages transmitted by prophets, men could know the existence and unity of God by rational methods of philosophy." Biruni argued that "the Hindus, no less than the Greeks, have philosophers who are believers in monotheism."<ref name=Watt/> Al-Biruni also compared Islam and [[Christianity]], citing passages from the Qur'an and [[Bible]] which state that their followers should always speak the [[truth]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Great Muslim Mathematicians|first=Mohaini|last=Mohamed|year=2000|publisher=Penerbit UTM|isbn=983-52-0157-9|pages=71–2|oclc=48759017}}</ref>

== Contemporary Islam ==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2007}}

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, most Islamic states fell under the sway of European colonialists. The colonialists enforced tolerance, especially of European Christian missionaries. After World War II, there was a general retreat from colonialism, and predominantly Muslim countries were again able to set their own policies regarding non-Muslims. This period also saw the beginning of increased migration from Muslim countries into the [[First World]] countries of Europe, the UK, Canada, the US, etc. This has completely reshaped relations between Islam and other religions.

===In predominantly Muslim countries===
Some predominantly Muslim countries allow the practice of all religions. Of these, some limit this freedom with bans on proselytizing or conversion, or restrictions on the building of places of worship; others (such as [[Mali]]) have no such restrictions. In practice, the situation of non-Muslim minorities depends not only on the law, but on local practices, which may vary.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Some countries are predominantly Muslim and allow freedom of religion adhering to democratic principles. Of particular note are the following countries:<ref>[http://bicn.com/bangladesh/refshelf/bgdholidays.htm Bangladesh Official Government Holidays 2001], ''bicn'', 2002, retrieved March 25, 2006</ref>
*[[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] have a significant population from the Hindu, Christian and Buddhist religions. They are allowed to practice their religions {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}, build places of worship and even have missionary schools and organizations but with limitation of such practice. 
*In [[Syria]], there are about 2.2 million Christians (10-12% of the population) from about 15 different religious and ethnic sects (Greek Orthodox, Syrian Orthodox, Church of the East, Protestants, Armenians Apostolic and various Catholics, Greek, Syrian, Aremenian, Chaldean, Maronite, Latin), as well as a [[History of the Jews in Syria|few dozen Jews]], and they have many hundreds of independent privately owned churches and some 15 synagogues. The freedom of religion is well observed by the state law as well as the historical long record of tolerance since the Ummayde caliph days. Christmas and Easter days are official holidays for both the Catholic or Orthodox calendar.

* [[Pakistan]] has different electorates for Muslims and non-Muslims, and also two chief justices of Supreme Court of Pakistan were Hindu and Christian after the formation of the country. 

Other Islamic nations are not so tolerant of minority religions :

* [[Saudi Arabia]] limits religious freedom to a high degree, prohibiting public worship by other religions.
* The now-overthrown [[Taliban]] regime in [[Afghanistan]] was considered intolerant by many observers. Some ancient Buddhist monuments, like the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]], were destroyed as idolatrous.
* The constitution of the [[Islamic Republic]] of [[Iran]] recognizes Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism as ''[[People of the Book]]'' and official religions, and they are granted the right to exercise religious freedom in Iran.<ref name="fidh">{{cite web | url = http://www.fidh.org/asie/rapport/2003/ir0108a.pdf | author = Federation Internationale des Ligues des Droits de L'Homme | publisher = fidh.org | accessdate = 2008-05-19 | date = August 2003 | title = Discrimination against religious minorities in IRAN|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080422184053/http://www.fidh.org/asie/rapport/2003/ir0108a.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 2008-04-22}}</ref><ref name="sanasarian">{{cite book | first = Eliz | last = Sanasarian | title = Religious Minorities in Iran | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521770736/page/73 73–84] | isbn = 0-521-77073-4 | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521770736/page/73 }}</ref> Five of the 270 seats in parliament are reserved for these three religions.

According to Islamic law, ''[[jizya]]'' (poll tax) is to be paid by all non-Muslims,{{ref|note}} excluding the weak and the poor, living in a Muslim state, to the general welfare of the state. Also, in his book "Al-Kharaj," Abu Yusuf says, "No Jizya is due on females or young infants." In exchange for the tax, the non-Muslims are required to be given security, provided compensation from the Muslim Exchequer when they are in need, treated on equality with Muslims, and enjoy rights as nationals of the state. Al-Balathiri comments on this saying, "Khaled Ibn Al-Walid, on entering [[Damascus]] as a conqueror, offered a guarantee of security to its people and their properties and churches, and promised that the wall of the city would not be pulled down, and none of their houses be demolished. It was a guarantee of God, he said, and of the Caliph and all believers to keep them safe and secure on condition they paid the dues of the Jizya."<ref>[http://www.islam.tc/alhilaal/site/war6.html The Poll Tax (jizya)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213224038/http://www.islam.tc/alhilaal/site/war6.html |date=2005-02-13 }}, ''Islam.tc'', retrieved March 23, 2006</ref> This poll tax is different from the alms tax (''[[Zakah]]'') paid by the Muslim subjects of a Muslim state.

Muslims and non-Muslims who hold property, especially land, were required however to pay [[Kharaj]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===Territorial disputes===
{{further|Divisions of the world in Islam|Islamism}}
One of the open issues in the relation between [[Islamic state]]s and non-Islamic states is the claim from hardline [[Muslims]] that once a certain land, state or territory has been under "Muslim" rule, it can never be relinquished anymore, and that such rule, somewhere in history would give the Muslims a kind of an eternal right on the claimed territory. This claim is particularly controversial with regard to [[Israel]] and to a lesser degree [[Spain]] and parts of the [[Balkan]] and it applies to parts of [[Kashmir]] as well.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

== Islamic views on religious pluralism ==
Reference to Islamic views on [[religious pluralism]] is found in the [[Quran]]. The following verses are generally interpreted as an evidence of religious pluralism:

[[Sura]]h Al-Ma'idah verse 48 states:
{{quote |If Allah so willed, He would have made you a single People, but His plan is to test each of you separately, in what He has given to each of you: so strive in all virtues as in you are in a race. The goal of all of you is to Allah. It is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute. ({{cite quran|5|48|style=nosup}}) }}

[[Sura]]h Al-Ankabut verse 46 states:

And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, "We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."

The Quran criticizes Christians and Jews who believed that their own religions are the only source of truth.

{{quote |They say, if you want to be guided to salvation, you should either become a Jew or Christian. Say: What about the religion of Abraham, he also worshiped no one but Allah. We believe in Allah, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, to Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes of Israel, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to all prophets from their Lord: We make no difference between one and another of them: And we bow to Allah. So, if they believe, they are indeed on the right path, but if they turn back, Allah will suffice them, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing. This is the Baptism of Allah. And who can baptize better than Allah. And it is He Whom we worship. Say: Will you dispute with us about Allah, He is our Lord and your Lord; that we are responsible for our doings and you for yours; and that We are sincere in Him? Or do ye say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: Do ye know better than Allah? Ah! who is more unjust than those who conceal the testimony they have from Allah. But Allah is not unmindful of what ye do! That was a people that hath passed away. They shall reap the fruit of what they did, and ye of what ye do! Of their merits there is no question in your case. ({{cite quran|2|135-141|style=nosup}}) }}

Surah Al-Baqara verse 113 states:
{{quote |The Jews say: "The Christians have nothing to stand upon"; and the Christians say: "The Jews have nothing to stand upon." Yet they both have something to stand upon, they both recite the Book. Like unto their word is what those say who know not; but Allah will judge between them in their quarrel on the Day of Judgment. ({{cite quran|2|113|style=nosup}}) }}

Many Muslims agree that cooperation with the Christian and Jewish community is important but some Muslims believe that theological debate is often unnecessary:
{{quote |Say: "O People of the Book! Come to what is common between us and you: That we worship none but God, that we associate no partners with Him, that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords other than Allah. If then they turn back, say: 'Bear witness that we are bowing to Allah’s will.'" ({{cite quran|3|64|style=nosup}}) }}

Islam's fundamental theological concept is the belief in one God. Muslims are not expected to visualize God but to worship and adore him as a protector. Any kind of idolatry is condemned in Islam. ({{cite quran|112|2|style=nosup}}) As a result, Muslims hold that for someone to worship any other gods or deities other than Allah (''[[Shirk (polytheism)|Shirk]]'' ([[polytheism]])) is a sin that will lead to separation from [[Allah]].

[[Muslims]] believe that [[Allah]] sent the [[Qur'an]] to bring peace and harmony to humanity through [[Islam]] (submission to Allah).<ref>[http://www.islamicbookseller.com/product_info.php/6_Modern_Issues/Islam_and_Universal_Peace/ Islam and Universal Peace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207112427/http://www.islamicbookseller.com/product_info.php/6_Modern_Issues/Islam_and_Universal_Peace/ |date=2008-12-07 }}
[[Sayyid Qutb]] 1977</ref> [[Muhammad]]'s worldwide mission was to establish universal peace under the ''[[Khilafat]]''.
The ''Khilafat'' ensured security of the lives and property of non-Muslims under the ''[[dhimmi]]'' system.
This status was originally only made available to non-Muslims who were "[[People of the Book]]" (Christians, Jews, and Sabians), but was later extended to include Zoroastrians, Sikhs, Hindus, Mandeans (Sabians), and Buddhists.
''Dhimmi'' had more rights than other non-Muslim religious subjects, but often fewer legal and social rights than Muslims. Some Muslims, however, disagree, and hold that adherents of these faiths cannot be ''dhimmi''.
Dhimmi enjoyed some freedoms under the state founded by [[Muhammad]] and could practice their religious rituals according to their faith and beliefs.

Non-Muslims who were not classified as "people of the book," for example practitioners of the pre-Muslim indigenous Arabian religions, had few or no rights in Muslim society.

Muslims and Muslim theologians attend at many [[interfaith|interfaith dialogues]], for example at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] with whom in 1993 also Muslim theologians signed the [[Declaration Toward a Global Ethic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weltethos.org/data-ge/c-10-stiftung/13-deklaration.php|title=''Declaration Toward a Global Ethic'' and their undersigner|accessdate=2013-08-17|format=PDF in Arabic, Malaysian, Bulgarian, Chinese, German, English, French, Italian, Catalan, Croatian, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Slovene, Spanish, Turkish|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930105840/http://www.weltethos.org/data-ge/c-10-stiftung/13-deklaration.php|archive-date=2013-09-30}}</ref>
 
[[Religious persecution]] is also prohibited,{{cite quran|10|99 | end=100 | translator=y}} although religious persecution in Muslim majority states has occurred, especially during periods of cruel rulers and general economic hardships. Pre-Islamic religious minorities continue to exist in some of their native countries, although only as marginal percentages of the overall population.

Over the centuries, several known religious debates, and [[polemic]]al works did exist in various Muslim countries between various [[Divisions of Islam|Muslim sects]], as well as between Muslims and non-Muslims. Many of these works survive today, and make for some very interesting reading in the [[apologetics]] genre. Only when such debates spilled over to the unlearned masses, and thus causing scandals and civil strife, did rulers intervene to restore order and pacify the public outcry on the perceived attack on their beliefs.

As for sects within Islam, history shows a variable pattern. Various sects became intolerant when gaining favour with the rulers, and often work to oppress or eliminate rival sects, for example, the contemporary persecution of Muslim minorities in [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref>https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2008/09/22/ismailis-najran</ref> [[Sectarian strife]] between [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] inhabitants of [[Baghdad]] is well known through history.

===Views on forms of worship in other religions===
The 14th century [[Sufi]] [[saint]] [[Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī|Abd al-Karim al-Jili]] stated, all religions could be summed up to principle religions and actually worship Allah in their own way:
# The Infidels; they disbelieve in a lord, because they worship the essence of God which reflects there is no lord over Him.
# The Physicists; worshipping the [[Physical law|natural properties]], which are actually attributes of God.
# The Philosophers; worshipping the [[Astrology|seven planets]], which represents further names of God.
# The [[Dualistic cosmology|Dualists]]; worshipping God as the Creator and the One.
# The Magians; worship God in the names of Unity in which all names and attributes past just as fire destroys and transmutes them in their nature.
# The Materialists; denying a [[Creator deity|creator]] and instead believe in the eternity of [[Father Time|Time]]. Thus they just believe in his [[Hu (Sufism)|He-ness]], in which God is just potentially but not actually creative.
# The [[Judaism|Jews]].
# The [[Christianity|Christians]].
# The Muslims.

Although there are different ways to worship God, those who do not worship like it was ordinated by a prophet will suffer in the afterlife. This suffering causes pleasure, because they feel spiritual delight in the way of their worship until they repent and take refuge in God.<ref>Reynold A. Nicholson ''Studies in Islamic Mysticism'' Routledge 2003 {{ISBN|978-1-135-79893-2}} page 99-100</ref>

The [[Sunnism|Sunni]] scholar and mystic [[Ibn Arabi]] holds that every religion is kind of worshipping Allah. Even [[Kafir|idol-worshippers]] actually would unconsciously worship Him,<ref>N. Ahmadi ''Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual'' Springer 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-230-37349-5}} page 96</ref> but they do not recognise, that in reality, there is no other entity than Allah to worship, thus unnecessarily limiting Him.

== Forced conversion ==
Many Muslim scholars believe that Quranic verses such as "Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error" ({{cite quran|2|256|style=ref}}) and ({{cite quran|18|29|style=ref}}) show that Islam prohibits [[forced conversion]] towards people of any religion.

The meaning of verse 9:5 has however been a subject of discussion amongst other scholars of Islam as well (see [[At-Tawba 5]]). This Surah was [[Revelation in Islam|revealed]] in the historical context of a broken treaty between Muslims and a group of idolaters during the time of [[Muhammed]]. Regarding this verse, Quranic translator [[M. A. S. Abdel Haleem]] writes: "In this context, this definitely refers to the ones who broke the treaty,"<ref>''The Qur'an: A new translation by M. A. S. Abdel Haleem'', 2005, Oxford University Press</ref> rather than polytheists generally. In addition, according to Sahih Al-Bukhari although clear orders were given to kill everyone who broke the treaty, Muhammed made a second treaty before entering Mecca and spared even Amar who was responsible for his daughter Rukayya's death and the person who killed his Uncle Hamza.

According to historian [[Bernard Lewis]], forced conversions played a role especially in the 12th century under the [[Almohad]] dynasty of [[North Africa]] and [[al-Andalus|Andalusia]].<ref name="conseq">Lewis (1984), p. 17, 18, 94, 95.</ref> He is however also of the opinion that other incidents of forced conversions have been rare in Islamic history. He adds that "In the early centuries of Islamic rule there was little or no attempt at forcible conversion, the spread of the faith being effected rather by persuasion and inducement."<ref>Lewis (1984) p. 151</ref><ref name="Waines 2003 p. 53">Waines (2003) p. 53</ref><ref>Esposito (2002) p. 71</ref> A few well-known examples of forced conversion are:<ref name="Waines 2003 p. 53"/>
