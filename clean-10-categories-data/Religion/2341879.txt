'''''Gott mit uns''''' ("God with us") is a phrase commonly used in heraldry in [[Prussia]] (from 1701) and later by the German military during the periods spanning the [[German Empire]] (1871 to 1918), the [[Third Reich]] (1933 to 1945), and the early years of [[West Germany]] (1949 to 1962). It was also commonly used by [[Sweden]] in most of its wars and especially as a warcry during the [[Thirty Years' War]].
== Origins ==
[[Matthew 1:23]], refers to the prophecy written in [[Isaiah 7:14]], glossing the name [[Immanuel]] (Emmanuel, {{Hebrew|עִמָּנוּאֵל}}) as  "God with us":

In the 17th century, the phrase ''Gott mit uns'' was used as a 'field word', a means of recognition akin to a password,<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Young |editor-first=Alan R. |title=The English Emblem Tradition: Volume 3: Emblematic Flag Devices of the English Civil Wars, 1642-1660 Index Emblematicus |page=xxiv |publisher=University of Toronto Press |date=1995}}</ref> by the army of [[Gustavus Adolphus]] at the battles of [[Battle of Breitenfeld (1631)|Breitenfeld (1631)]], [[Battle of Lützen (1632)|Lützen (1632)]] and [[Battle of Wittstock|Wittstock (1636)]] in the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YylYMtCMz2UC&pg=PA21 |last=Brzezinski |first=Richard |title=The Army of Gustavus Adolphus (2): Cavalry (Men-at-Arms) |page=21 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |date=1993 |isbn=1-85532-350-8}}</ref>

In 1701, [[Frederick I of Prussia]] changed his coat of arms as [[Prince-Elector]] of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]. The electoral scepter had its own shield under the electoral cap. Below, the motto ''Gott mit uns'' appeared on the pedestal.
The [[Order of the Crown (Prussia)|Prussian Order of the Crown]] was [[Prussia]]'s lowest ranking [[Order (decoration)|order of chivalry]], and was instituted in 1861. The obverse gilt central disc bore the crown of Prussia, surrounded by a blue enamel ring bearing the motto of the German Empire ''Gott Mit Uns''.

At the time of the completion of [[German unification]] in 1871, the imperial standard bore the motto ''Gott mit uns'' on the arms of an [[Iron Cross]].<ref>Preble, George Henry, ''History of the Flag of the United States of America: With a Chronicle of the Symbols, Standards, Banners, and Flags of Ancient and Modern Nations'', 2nd ed, p. 102; A. Williams and co, 1880</ref> Imperial German [[German gold mark#Silver coins|3 and 5 mark silver]] and [[German gold mark#Gold coins|20 mark gold]] coins had ''Gott mit uns'' inscribed on their edge.

German soldiers had ''Gott mit uns'' inscribed on their helmets in the [[First World War]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5Ceq6l0M0C&pg=PA14 |last=Spector |first=Robert Melvyn |title=World Without Civilization: Mass Murder and the Holocaust, History, and Analysis |pages=14 |publisher=University Press of America |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-7618-2963-8}}</ref> The slogan entered the mindset on both sides; in 1916 a cartoon was printed in the ''[[New York Tribune]]'' captioned "Gott Mit Uns!", showing "a German officer in spiked helmet holding a smoking revolver as he stood over the bleeding form of a nurse. It symbolized the rising popular demand that the United States shed its neutrality".<ref>Hoehling, Adolph A.; ''The Great War at Sea: A History of Naval Action, 1914-18'', p. 106; Crowell, 1965; {{ISBN|1-56619-726-0}}</ref>

In June 1920 [[George Grosz]] produced a lithographic collection in three editions entitled ''Gott mit uns''. A satire on German society and the counterrevolution, the collection was swiftly banned. Grosz was charged with insulting the [[Reichswehr|army]], which resulted in a 300 [[Deutsche Mark|German Mark]] fine and the [[Book burning|destruction]] of the collection.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQzdp1zN--oC&pg=PA28 |last=Crockett |first=Dennis |title=German Post-Expressionism: The Art of the Great Disorder, 1918-1924 |pages=28–29 |publisher=Penn State University Press |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-271-01796-9}}</ref>

During the [[Second World War]] [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers wore this slogan on their belt buckles,<ref>{{cite book |last=Armbrüster |first=Thomas |title=Management and Organization in Germany |page=64 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-7546-3880-3}}</ref> as opposed to members of the [[Waffen SS]], who wore the motto ''[[Meine Ehre heißt Treue]]'' ('My honour is loyalty').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wu0B6_XO3boC&pg=PA1 |last=McConnell |first=Winder |title=A Companion to the Nibelungenlied |page=1 |publisher=Boydell & Brewer |date=1998 |isbn=978-1-57113-151-5}}</ref> After the war the motto was also used by the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' and German police. It was replaced with "''Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit''" ("Unity and Justice and Freedom") in 1962 (police within the 1970s), the first line of the third stanza of the [[Deutschlandlied|German national anthem]].
