Boko Haram was founded upon the principles of [[Salafi movement|Salafism]] which advocates strict adherence to [[Sharia|Sharia law]]. It developed into a [[Jihadism|Jihadist]] group in 2009. The movement is diffuse, and fighters who are associated with it follow the [[Salafi movement#Tenets|Salafi doctrine]]. Their beliefs tend to be centered on strict adherence to [[Wahabi]]sm, which is an extremely strict form of Sunni Islam that sees many other forms of Islam as idolatrous.<ref name="Congressional">{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43558.pdf |title=Nigeria's Boko Haram: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Congressional Research Service |author=Lauren Ploch Blanchard |date=10 June 2014 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=cfrBackgrounder>{{cite web | url=http://www.cfr.org/africa/boko-haram/p25739 | title=Backgrounder&nbsp;— Boko Haram | publisher=Council of Foreign Relations | work=cfr.org | date=27 December 2011 | accessdate=12 March 2012 | last=Johnson |first=Toni}}</ref><ref name="CTC">{{cite web |url=http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-rise-of-boko-haram-in-nigeria |title=The Rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria|last=Cook |first=David |date=26 September 2011 |publisher=Combating Terrorism Centre |accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gloria-center.org/2014/07/the-diffusion-of-intra-islamic-violence-and-terrorism-the-impact-of-the-proliferation-of-salafiwahhabi-ideologies/ |title=The Diffusion of Intra-islamic Violence and Terrorism: the Impact of the Proliferation of Salafi/Wahhabi Ideologies |accessdate=10 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803072301/http://www.gloria-center.org/2014/07/the-diffusion-of-intra-islamic-violence-and-terrorism-the-impact-of-the-proliferation-of-salafiwahhabi-ideologies/ |archive-date=3 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=Onuoha>{{Cite book |title=Boko Haram: Islamism, politics, security and the state in Nigeria |chapter=Boko Haram and the evolving Salafi Jihadist threat in Nigeria|last=Onuoha |first=Freedom |year=2014 |publisher=African Studies Centre|location= Leiden |isbn=978-90-5448-135-5 |pages=158–191 |chapter-url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/23853/ASC-075287668-3441-01.pdf |accessdate=14 May 2014 |editor-last=Pérouse de Montclos |editor-first=Marc-Antoine }}</ref> The group has denounced the members of the [[Sufi]] and the [[Shiite]] sects as infidels.<ref>[[Tolu Ogunlesi]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/opinion/nigerias-internal-struggles.html?_r=0 "Nigeria's Internal Struggles"], ''The New York Times'', 23 March 2015.</ref> Boko Haram seeks the establishment of an Islamic state in Nigeria.

==History==
===Background===
{{Further|Fourth Nigerian Republic}}
Before it was colonized and subsequently incorporated into [[British Empire]] in 1900 as [[Colonial Nigeria]], the [[Bornu Empire]] ruled the territory where Boko Haram is currently active. It was a [[sovereign]] [[sultanate]] run according to the principles of the [[Constitution of Medina]], with a majority [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] Muslim population. In 1903, both the [[Borno Emirate]] and [[Sokoto Caliphate]] had come under British rule. [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] at this time spread the Christian message in the region and had many converts among the Nigerian populace.<ref name="Nigeria">[http://countrystudies.us/nigeria/ Helen Chapin Metz, ed.

Except for a brief period of civilian rule between 1979 and 1983, Nigeria was governed by a series of military dictatorships from 1966 until the advent of democracy in 1999. [[Ethnic violence|Ethnic militancy]] is thought to have been one of the causes of the [[Nigerian Civil War|1967–1970 civil war]]; [[Religious violence in Nigeria|religious violence]] reached a new height in 1980 in [[Kano]], the largest city in the north of the country, where the Muslim fundamentalist sect [[Yan Tatsine]] ("followers of Maitatsine") instigated riots that resulted in four or five thousand deaths. In the ensuing military crackdown, Maitatsine was killed, fuelling a backlash of increased violence that spread across other northern cities over the next twenty years.<ref name="Martin Ewi">{{cite web |url=http://www.issafrica.org/iss-today/why-nigeria-needs-a-criminal-tribunal-and-not-amnesty-for-boko-haram |title=Why Nigeria needs a criminal tribunal and not amnesty for Boko Haram |publisher=Institute for Security Studies |author=Martin Ewi |date=24 June 2013 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref> Social inequality and poverty contributed both to the Maitatsine and Boko Haram uprisings.<ref name=journals>{{cite web |url=http://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/afsp/article/viewFile/330/330 |title=The Boko Haram Uprising and Islamic Revivalism in Nigeria |publisher=Africa Spectrum |last=Adesoji |first=Abimbola |year=2010 |accessdate=August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301012207/http://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/afsp/article/viewFile/330/330 |archive-date=1 March 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{rp|97–98}}

In the decades since the end of British rule, politicians and academics from the mainly Islamic North have expressed their fundamental opposition to Western education. Political ethno-religious interest groups, whose membership includes influential political, military and religious leaders, have thrived in Nigeria, though they were largely suppressed under military rule. Their [[paramilitary]] wings, formed since the country's return to civilian rule, have been implicated in much of the sectarian violence in the years following. The [[Arewa People's Congress]], the militia wing of the [[Arewa Consultative Forum]], the main political group representing the interests of northern Nigeria, is a well-funded group with military and intelligence expertise, and is considered capable of engaging in military action, including covert bombing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://africanarguments.org/2014/05/19/revolt-in-the-north-interpreting-boko-harams-war-on-western-education-by-kirk-ross/ |title=Revolt in the North: Interpreting Boko Haram's war on western education |publisher=African Arguments |author=Kirk Ross |date=19 May 2014 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref>

===Founding===
[[Mohammed Yusuf (Boko Haram)|Mohammed Yusuf]] founded the sect that became known as Boko Haram in 2002 in Maiduguri, the capital of the north-eastern state of Borno. He established a religious complex and school that attracted poor Muslim families from across Nigeria and neighbouring countries. The center had the political goal of creating an [[Islamic state]], and became a recruiting ground for [[Jihadism|jihadis]]. By denouncing the police and state corruption, Yusuf attracted followers from unemployed youth.<ref name=cfrBackgrounder/><ref name="bbc20110826">{{cite news |first=Farouk |last=Chothia |title=Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamists? |date=11 January 2012 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13809501 |work=BBC News |accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="IRIN">{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report/93250/Analysis-Understanding-Nigeria-s-Boko-Haram-radicals |title=Analysis: Understanding Nigeria's Boko Haram radicals |publisher=www.irinnews.org |date=18 July 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=econ1405>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2014/05/islam-west-and-nigeria |title=Whose faith, whose girls? |newspaper=The Economist}}</ref> He is reported to have used the existing infrastructure in Borno of the [[Izala Society]] (Jama'at Izalatil Bidiawa Iqamatus Sunnah), a popular conservative Islamic sect, to recruit members, before breaking away to form his own faction.

Boko Haram retreated to [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla warfare]] tactics. But since 2018, there has been [[#2018|major spike in attacks]] by Boko Haram.

==Campaign of violence==
{{Further|Boko Haram insurgency|Timeline of the Boko Haram insurgency}}

Boko Haram's attacks consist of suicide bombers as well as conventional armed assaults on both civilian and military targets. Following the 2014 kidnapping, the majority of Boko Haram's suicide bombers are female; some are as young as seven years old. Boko Haram jihadists rely on stealth, blending into local communities or hiding in the vast countryside. Critics accuse the Nigerian military of not properly equipping its soldiers to fight Boko Haram.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Mark|title=Why January is Boko Haram's deadliest month|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42735414|accessdate=23 February 2018|work=BBC News|date=2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=CNN|first1=Robyn Kriel|title=Boko Haram favors women, children as bombers: Study|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/10/africa/boko-haram-women-children-suicide-bombers/index.html|accessdate=23 February 2018|work=CNN|date=2018}}</ref>

In 2008, police began an investigation into the group code-named Operation Flush. On 26 July, security forces arrested nine Boko Haram members and confiscated weapons and bomb-making equipment. Either this or a clash with police during a funeral procession led to revenge attacks on police and widespread rioting in [[Bauchi]], Maiduguri, Potiskum and Wudil. A joint military task force operation was launched in response. By 30 July more than 700 people had been killed; police stations, prisons, government offices, schools and churches had been destroyed.<ref name=enc/><ref name=journals/>{{rp|98–102}}<ref name="Nigeria: Boko Haram 101">{{cite web |author=Joe Bavier |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/nigeria-boko-haram-terrorist-group-islam-christian-church-targets-youth-military |title=Nigeria: Boko Haram 101 |website=Pulitzercenter.org |date=15 January 2012 }}</ref><ref name=NOSSITER>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/world/africa/28nigeria.html?scp=6&sq=nigeria&st=cse |title=Scores Die as Fighters Battle Nigerian Police|last=Nossiter|first=Adam |date=27 July 2009 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=22 January 2012}}</ref> Yusuf was arrested, and died in custody "while trying to escape".

According to the leaked document, there were reports that Yusuf's deputy had survived, and audio tapes were believed to be in circulation in which Boko Haram threatened future attacks. Nevertheless, many observers did not anticipate imminent bloodshed. Security in Borno was downgraded. Borno government official Alhaji Boguma believed that the state deserved praise from the international community for ending the conflict in such a short time, and that the "wave of fundamentalism" had been "crushed".<ref name=wikileaks/>

===2010===

{{main|Bauchi prison break}}
On 7 September 2010, having regrouped under their new leader, Boko Haram broke 105 of its members out of prison in [[Bauchi]] along with over 600 other prisoners.

Under Shekau's leadership, the group continuously improved its operational capabilities. It launched a string of [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] attacks against [[soft target]]s and its first [[vehicle-borne IED]] attack [[2011 Abuja police headquarters bombing|on 16 June 2011]], killing six at [[Abuja]]'s police headquarters. On 26 August, Boko Haram [[2011 Abuja United Nations bombing|bombed]] the [[United Nations]] (UN) headquarters in Abuja, the first time they had struck a Western target. A spokesman claiming responsibility for the attack, in which 11 UN staff members died as well as 12 others, with more than 100 injured, warned of future planned attacks on U.S. and Nigerian government interests. Speaking soon after the U.S. embassy's announcement of the arrival in the country of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], he went on to announce Boko Haram's terms for negotiation, i.e. the release of all imprisoned members. The increased sophistication of the group led observers to speculate that Boko Haram was affiliated with [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] (AQIM), which was active in [[Niger]].<ref name="Boko Haram attacks – timeline"/><ref name="Peace and Security Council Report"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/08/un-house-bombing-why-we-struck-boko-haram/ |title=UN House bombing: Why we struck-Boko Haram |work=Vanguard |author=Ndahi Marama |date=30 July 2014 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref><ref name="Counterterrorism 2014 Calendar"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/29/us-nigeria-bombing-claim-idUSTRE77S3ZO20110829 |title=Islamist sect Boko Haram claims Nigerian U.N. bombing |work=Reuters |author=Ibrahim Mshelizza |date=29 August 2011 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/31/us-nigeria-bokoharam-idUSTRE80U0LR20120131 |title=Special Report: Boko Haram&nbsp;— between rebellion and jihad |work=Reuters |author=Joe Brock |date=31 January 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="Reuters">{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/31/us-nigeria-bokoharam-idUSTRE80U0LR20120131 |title=Special Report: Boko Haram – between rebellion and jihad |work=Reuters}}</ref>

Boko Haram has maintained a steady rate of attacks since 2011, striking a wide range of targets, multiple times per week. They have attacked politicians, religious leaders, security forces and civilian targets. The tactic of [[Suicide attack|suicide bombing]], used in the two attacks in the capital - on the police and UN headquarters - was new to Nigeria.

====Presidential inauguration====
{{Further|2011 Nigerian presidential election}}
Within hours of [[Goodluck Jonathan]]'s presidential inauguration in May 2011, Boko Haram carried out a series of bombings in [[Bauchi]], [[Zaria]] and Abuja. The most successful of these was the attack on the army barracks in Bauchi. A spokesman for the group told BBC Hausa that the attack had been carried out, as a test of loyalty, by serving members of the military hoping to join the group. This charge was later refuted by an army spokesman who claimed: "This is not a [[banana republic]]". However, on 8 January 2012 the president would announce that Boko Haram had in reality infiltrated both the army and the police, as well as the executive, parliamentary and legislative branches of government. Boko Haram's spokesman also claimed responsibility for the killing outside his home in Maiduguri of the politician Abba Anas Ibn Umar Garbai, the younger brother of the Shehu of Borno, who was the second most prominent Muslim in the country after the [[Sultan of Sokoto]]. He added: "We are doing what we are doing to fight injustice, if they stop their satanic ways of doing things and the injustices, we would stop what we are doing".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/06/boko-haram-claims-responsibility-for-bomb-blasts-in-bauchi-maiduguri/ |title=Boko Haram claims responsibility for bomb blasts in Bauchi, Maiduguri |work=Vanguard News |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punchng.com/news/boko-haram-has-infiltrated-my-govt-jonathan/ |title=Boko Haram has infiltrated my govt –Jonathan |work=Punch |author=Olalekan Adetayo |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808043607/http://www.punchng.com/news/boko-haram-has-infiltrated-my-govt-jonathan/ |archivedate=8 August 2014}}</ref>

This was one of several political and religious assassinations Boko Haram carried out that year, with the presumed intention of correcting injustices in the group's home state of Borno. Meanwhile, the trail of massacres continued relentlessly, apparently leading the country towards civil war. By the end of 2011, these conflicting strategies led observers to question the group's cohesion; comparisons were drawn with the diverse motivations of the militant factions of the oil-rich [[Niger Delta]]. Adding to the confusion, in November the [[State Security Service (Nigeria)|State Security Service]] announced that four criminal syndicates were operating under the name Boko Haram.<ref name="Richard Dowden"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-rise-of-boko-haram-in-nigeria |title=The Rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria |publisher=Combating Terrorism Center |author=David Cook |date=26 September 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref><ref name="JEAN HERSKOVITS">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/opinion/in-nigeria-boko-haram-is-not-the-problem.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |title=In Nigeria, Boko Haram Is Not the Problem |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Jean Herskovits |date=2 January 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://africanarguments.org/2012/01/19/boko-haram-the-answer-to-terror-lies-in-providing-more-meaningful-human-security-by-olly-owen/ |title=Boko Haram: Answering Terror With More Meaningful Human Security |publisher=African Arguments |author=Olly Owen |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>

The common theme throughout the north-east was the targeting of police, who were regularly massacred at work or in [[drive-by shooting]]s at their homes, either in revenge for the killing of Yusuf, or as representatives of the state apparatus, or for no particular reason. Five officers were arrested for Yusuf's murder, which had no noticeable effect on the level of unrest. Opportunities for criminal enterprise flourished. Hundreds of police were dead and more than 60 police stations had been attacked by mid-2012. The government's response to this self-reinforcing trend towards insecurity was to invest heavily in security equipment, spending $5.5 billion, 20 percent of their overall budget, on bomb detection units, communications and transport; and $470&nbsp;million on a [[Africa–China relations|Chinese]] [[CCTV]] system for Abuja, which has failed in its purpose of detecting or deterring acts of [[Terrorism|terror]].<ref name="JEAN HERSKOVITS"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://africanarguments.org/2012/01/19/boko-haram-the-answer-to-terror-lies-in-providing-more-meaningful-human-security-by-olly-owen/ |title=Boko Haram: Answering Terror With More Meaningful Human Security |publisher=African Arguments |author=Olly Owen |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://icinspector.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Nigeria-March-20121.pdf |title=Review of the January 2012 UK Border Information Service Nigeria Country of Origin Information Report |publisher=Independent Advisory Group on Country Information |author=Gernot Klantschnig |date=February 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016235722/http://icinspector.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Nigeria-March-20121.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2012humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&dlid=204153#wrapper |title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |author=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="HRW2012">{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/11/nigeria-boko-haram-attacks-likely-crimes-against-humanity |title=Nigeria: Boko Haram Attacks Likely Crimes Against Humanity |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/163975-high-level-corruption-rocks-470million-cctv-project-secure-abuja.html#sthash.rEA1DWAX.dpbs |title=High-level corruption rocks $470million CCTV project that could secure Abuja |work=Premium Times |author=Ibanga Isine |date=27 June 2014 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref>

The election defeat of former military dictator [[Muhammadu Buhari]] increased ethno-religious political tensions, as it broke the terms of a tacit agreement that the presidency would alternate after two terms of office between candidates from the Christian south and Muslim north of the country. Sectarian riots engulfed the twelve northern states of the country during the three days following the election, leaving more than 800 dead and 65,000 displaced. The subsequent campaign of violence by Boko Haram culminated in a string of bombings across the country on Christmas Day. In the outskirts of Abuja, 37 died in a church that had its roof blown off. One resident commented, "Cars were in flames and bodies littered everywhere", a phrase commonly repeated in international press reports about the bombings. Similar Christmas events had been reported in previous years. Jonathan declared a [[state of emergency]] on New Year's Eve in local government areas of Jos, Borno, [[Yobe]] and [[Niger State|Niger]] and closed the international border in the north-east.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/8977585/Coordinated-bomb-attacks-across-Nigeria-kill-at-least-40.html |title=Coordinated bomb attacks across Nigeria kill at least 40 |newspaper=The Telegraph |author=Duncan Gardham |author2=Laura Heaton |date=25 December 2011 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/88249/five-bombs-explode-across-nigeria-killing-dozens |title=Five bombs explode across Nigeria killing dozens |newspaper=Buenos Aires Herald |date=25 December 2011 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/world/africa/explosion-rips-through-catholic-church-in-nigeria.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |title=Nigerian Group Escalates Violence With Church Attacks |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Adam Nossiter |date=25 December 2011 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/christmas-day-bombings-nigeria-kill-25-radical-muslim-sect-claims-responsibility-article-1.996711 |title=Christmas Day bombings in Nigeria kill at least 39, radical Muslim sect claims responsibility |newspaper=New York Daily News |author=Tina Moore |date=25 December 2011 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/12/2011122581347745807.html |title=Nigeria churches hit by blasts |publisher=Aljazeera |date=26 December 2011 |accessdate=August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918023235/http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/12/2011122581347745807.html |archivedate=18 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12077944 |title=Christmas bombings kill many near Jos, Nigeria |publisher=BBC |date=25 December 2010 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/31/us-nigeria-emergency-idUSL6E7NV07T20111231 |title=Nigeria's Jonathan declares state of emergency |work=Reuters |author=Felix Onuah |author2=Tim Cocks |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16579001 |title=Nigerian fuel subsidy: Strike suspended |publisher=BBC |date=16 January 2012 |accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/05/16/nigeria-post-election-violence-killed-800 |title=Nigeria: Post-Election Violence Killed 800 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=November 2014}}</ref><ref name="FalolaHeaton2008">{{cite book|author1=Toyin Falola|author2=Matthew M.

Three days later they began a series of mostly small-scale attacks on Christians and members of the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] ethnic group, causing hundreds to flee. In Kano, on 20 January, they carried out by far their most deadly action yet, an assault on police buildings, killing 190. One of the victims was a TV reporter.

[[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] published reports in 2012 that were widely quoted by government agencies and the media, based on research conducted over the course of the conflict in the worst affected areas of the country. The [[NGO]]s were critical of both security forces and Boko Haram. HRW stated "Boko Haram should immediately cease all attacks, and threats of attacks, that cause loss of life, injury, and destruction of property. The Nigerian government should take urgent measures to address the human rights abuses that have helped fuel the violent militancy". According to the 2012 [[US Department of State]] ''[[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|Country Report on Human Rights Practices]]'':<ref name="hrw report">{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/11/nigeria-boko-haram-attacks-likely-crimes-against-humanity |title=Nigeria: Boko Haram Attacks Likely Crimes Against Humanity |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>
{{quote|[S]erious [[Human rights in Nigeria|human rights problems]] included extrajudicial killings by security forces, including [[summary executions]]; security force torture, rape, and other cruel, [[inhuman, or degrading treatment]] of prisoners, detainees, and criminal suspects; harsh and life-threatening prison and detention center conditions; [[arbitrary arrest and detention]]; prolonged pretrial detention; denial of fair public trial; executive influence on the judiciary; infringements on citizens' privacy rights; restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, religion, and movement.

On 9 October, witnesses in Maiduguri claimed members of the [[Joint Task Force|JTF]] "Restore Order" [<nowiki />a [[vigilante]] group], based in Maiduguri, went on a [[killing spree]] after a suspected Boko Haram bomb killed an officer. Media reported the JTF killed 20 to 45 civilians and razed 50 to 100 houses in the neighborhood. The JTF commander in Maiduguri denied the allegations. On 2 November, witnesses claimed the JTF shot and killed up to 40 people during raids in Maiduguri. The army claimed it dismissed some officers from the military as a result of alleged abuses committed in Maiduguri, but there were no known formal prosecutions in Maiduguri by year's end.

Credible reports also indicated&nbsp;... uniformed military personnel and [[paramilitary]] [[Nigerian Mobile Police|mobile police]] carried out summary executions, assaults, torture, and other abuses throughout Bauchi, Borno, [[Kano State|Kano]], [[Kaduna State|Kaduna]], [[Plateau State|Plateau]], and Yobe states&nbsp;... The national police, army, and other security forces committed [[extrajudicial killing]]s and used lethal and [[excessive force]] to apprehend criminals and suspects, as well as to disperse protesters. Authorities generally did not hold police accountable for the use of excessive or [[deadly force]] or for the deaths of persons [[Death in custody|in custody]]. Security forces generally operated with impunity in the illegal apprehension, detention, and sometimes [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial]] [[execution]] of criminal suspects. The reports of state or federal panels of inquiry investigating [[suspicious death]]s remained unpublished.

There were no new developments in the case of five police officers accused of executing Muhammad Yusuf in 2009 at a state police headquarters. In July 2011 authorities arraigned five police officers in the federal high court in Abuja for the [[murder]] of Yusuf. The court granted bail to four of the officers, while one remained in custody.

Police use of excessive force, including use of live ammunition, to disperse demonstrators resulted in numerous killings during the year. For example, although the January fuel subsidy demonstrations generally remained peaceful, security forces reportedly fired on protesters in various states across the country during those demonstrations, resulting in 10 to 15 deaths and an unknown number of wounded.

Despite some improvements resulting from the closure of police checkpoints in many parts of the country, states with an increased security presence due to the activities of Boko Haram experienced a rise in violence and lethal force at police and military [[roadblock]]s.

Continuing abductions of civilians by criminal groups occurred in the Niger Delta and [[Biafra|Southeast]]&nbsp;... Police and other security forces were often implicated in the kidnapping schemes.

Although the constitution and law prohibit such practices and provide for punishment of such abuses, torture is not criminalized, and security service personnel, including police, military, and State Security Service (SSS) officers, regularly tortured, beat, and abused demonstrators, criminal suspects, detainees, and convicted prisoners.

Nigeria's Borno State, where Boko Haram is based, adjoins [[Lake Chad]] as do [[Niger]], [[Cameroon]] and the country of [[Chad]]. The conflict and refugees spilled over the national borders to involve all four countries.

In 2013, Boko Haram increased operations in Northern Cameroon, and were involved in skirmishes along the borders of [[Chad]] and Niger. They were linked to a number of kidnappings, often reportedly in association with the splinter group [[Ansaru]], drawing towards them a higher level of international attention.

The [[Bureau of Counterterrorism|U.S. Bureau of Counterterrorism]] provides the following summary of Boko Haram's 2013 foreign operations:
{{quote|In February 2013, Boko Haram was responsible for kidnapping seven French tourists in the far north of Cameroon. In November 2013, Boko Haram members kidnapped a French priest in Cameroon. In December 2013, Boko Haram gunmen reportedly attacked civilians in several areas of northern Cameroon. Security forces from Chad and Niger also reportedly partook in skirmishes against suspected Boko Haram members along Nigeria's borders. In 2013, the group also kidnapped eight French citizens in northern Cameroon and obtained ransom payments for their release.<ref name=Bureau/>}}

Boko Haram has often managed to evade the Nigerian army by retreating into the hills around the border with Cameroon, whose army is apparently unwilling to confront them. Nigeria, Chad and Niger had formed a Multinational Joint Task Force in 1998. In February 2012, Cameroon signed an agreement with Nigeria to establish a Joint Trans-Border Security Committee, which was inaugurated in November 2013, when Cameroon announced plans to conduct "coordinated but separate" border patrols in 2014. It convened again in July 2014 to further improve cooperation between the two countries.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/99174/with-cross-border-attacks-boko-haram-threat-widens |title=With cross-border attacks, Boko Haram threat widens |publisher=IRIN |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/30/us-nigeria-boko-haram-idUSKBN0EA1LE20140530 |title=Cameroon weakest link in fight against Boko Haram |work=Reuters |author=Tim Cocks |date=30 May 2014 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201302060270.html |title=Nigeria: FG Inaugurates Nigeria-Cameroon Trans-Border Security Committee |publisher=allAfrica |date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://dailyindependentnig.com/2014/07/2nd-session-nigeriacameroon-trans-border-security-committee-meets-abuja/ |title=2nd session of Nigeria/Cameroon Trans-Border Security Committee meets in Abuja |newspaper=Daily Independent |accessdate=August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809232618/http://dailyindependentnig.com/2014/07/2nd-session-nigeriacameroon-trans-border-security-committee-meets-abuja/ |archivedate=9 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://m.news24.com/nigeria/National/News/Nigeria-Cameroon-security-committee-meets-20140707 |title=Nigeria-Cameroon security committee meets |publisher=News 24 Nigeria |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref>

The state of emergency was extended in May 2013 to cover the whole of the three north-eastern states of [[Borno State|Borno]], [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]] and [[Yobe State|Yobe]], raising tensions in the region. In the 12 months following the announcement, 250,000 fled the three states, followed by a further 180,000 between May and August 2014. A further 210,000 fled from bordering states, bringing the total displaced by the conflict to 650,000. Many thousands left the country. An August 2014 Amnesty International video showed Army and allied militia executing people, including by slitting their throats, and dumping their corpses in mass graves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.informationng.com/2014/08/650000-nigerians-displaced-following-boko-haram-attacks-un.html |title=650,000 Nigerians Displaced Following Boko Haram Attacks&nbsp;– UN |publisher=Information Nigeria |date=5 August 2014 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/536ca0f79.html |title=Refugees fleeing attacks in north eastern Nigeria, UNHCR watching for new displacement |publisher=UNHCR |author=Adrian Edwards |date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-05/amnesty-says-gruesome-nigerian-footage-shows-war-crimes.html |title=Amnesty Says 'Gruesome' Nigerian Footage Shows War Crimes |publisher=Bloomberg |author=Emele Onu |date=5 August 2014 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref> According to Human Rights Watch, more than 130 villages and towns were attacked or controlled by the group.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/nigeria |title=World Report 2015: Nigeria &#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date= 12 January 2015|accessdate=2016-05-21}}</ref>

Parents of the missing girls and those who had escaped were kept waiting until July to meet with the president, which caused them concern. In October, the government announced the girls' imminent release, but the information proved unreliable. The announcement to the media of a peace agreement and the imminent release of all the missing girls was followed days later by a video message in which Shekau stated that no such meeting had taken place and that the girls had been "married off". The announcement to the media, unaccompanied by any evidence of the reality of the agreement, was thought by analysts to have been a political ploy by the president to raise his popularity before his confirmation of his candidacy in the [[2015 Nigerian general election|2015 general election]]. Earlier in the year, the girls' plight had featured on "#BringBackOurGirls" political campaign posters in the streets of the capital, which the president denied knowledge of and soon took down after news of criticism surfaced. These posters, which were interpreted, to the dismay of campaigners for the girls' recapture, as being designed to benefit from the fame of the kidnapping, had also been part of Jonathan's "pre-presidential campaign". In September, "#BringBackGoodluck2015" campaign posters again drew criticism.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-10/nigeria-s-president-jonathan-bans-bring-back-goodluck-campaign.html |title=Nigeria's President Jonathan Bans 'Bring Back Goodluck' Campaign |publisher=Bloomberg |author=Daniel Magnowski |date=10 September 2014 |accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref> The official announcement of the president's candidacy was made before cheering crowds in Abuja on 11 November.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/11/11/nigeria-politics-idUKL6N0T136F20141111 |title=Nigeria's Jonathan seeks second term, vows to beat Boko Haram |work=Reuters |author=Felix Onuah |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=11 November 2014}}</ref>

In February 2016, the organizations [[International Alert]] and [[UNICEF]] published a study revealing that girls and women released from Boko Haram captivity often face rejection upon returning to their communities and families, in part due to a culture of stigma around sexual violence.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/16/women-freed-boko-haram-rejected-for-bringing-bad-blood-back-home-nigeria |title=Women freed from Boko Haram rejected for bringing 'bad blood' back home |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Liz Ford |date=16 February 2016|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref>

Boko Haram continued to increase its presence in northern Cameroon. On 16 May, ten Chinese workers were abducted in a raid on a construction company camp in Waza, near the Nigerian border. Vehicles and explosives were also taken in the raid, and one Cameroonian soldier was killed. Cameroon's anti-terrorist Rapid Intervention Battalion attempted to intervene but were vastly outnumbered.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304908304579567933126108684 |title=Chinese Workers Kidnapped by Suspected Boko Haram Militants in Cameroon |work=The Wall Street Journal |author=Emmanuel Tummanjong |date=17 May 2014 |accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref> In July, the deputy prime minister's home village was attacked by around 200 militants; his wife was kidnapped, along with the Sultan of [[Kolofata]] and his family.

====Rise in child suicide bombing====
UNICEF reported an increase in child suicide bombers with 27 incidents occurring in the first three months of 2017 in Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad, compared to 30 in the entire previous year, 56 in 2015 and 4 in 2014. Kidnapped children who escape from Boko Haram are often held in custody or ostracized by their community or family. Patrick Rose, a UNICEF regional coordinator, stated: "They are held in military barracks, separated from their parents, without medical follow-up, without psychological support, without education, under conditions and for durations that are unknown". According to the NGO: "Society's rejection of these children, and their sense of isolation and desperation, could be making them more vulnerable to promises of martyrdom through acceptance of dangerous and deadly missions".<ref>{{cite news|title=Boko Haram Is Increasingly Using Children in Suicide Attacks|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/boko-haram-increasingly-using-children-suicide-attacks-n745456|accessdate=2 June 2017|work=NBC News|agency=Reuters|date=12 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Alarming' rise in Boko Haram child suicide bombers|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/rise-boko-haram-child-suicide-bombers-170412041301650.html|accessdate=2 June 2017|work=Aljazeera|date=12 April 2017}}</ref>
In addition to child suicide bombers and despite having been routed from key areas and significantly downgraded in their capacities, throughout 2016 and into 2017, Boko Haram in Nigeria continued to wage attacks against Nigerian security forces, the community-based Civilian Joint Task Forces (CJTF), and regular citizens, using improvised explosives devices (IEDs) and other crude weaponry. These were often deployed with suicide bombers; an increasing number of whom were women and girls recruited to attack markets, transportation depots, mosques, and IDP camps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://library.fundforpeace.org/fp303011602|title=Confronting the Unthinkable: Suicide Bombers in Northern Nigeria|access-date=13 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613134219/http://library.fundforpeace.org/fp303011602|archive-date=13 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Organization==

===Leader===

Boko Haram was founded by Mohammed Yusuf who led the group from 2002 until his death in 2009. After his death, his deputy [[Abubakar Shekau]] took control of the group and has led it until the present day.

Although Boko Haram is organized in a hierarchical structure with one overall leader, the group also operates as a [[clandestine cell system]] using a network structure,<ref name="START">{{cite web |url=http://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/STARTBackgroundReport_BokoHaramRecentAttacks_May2014_0.pdf |title=Boko Haram Recent Attacks |publisher=National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism}}</ref> with units having between 300 and 500 fighters each.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Estimates of the total number of fighters range between 500 and 9,000.<ref name="conflict-news.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.conflict-news.com/boko-haram-worse-isis/ |title=Are Boko Haram Worse Than ISIS? |publisher=Conflict News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317153121/http://www.conflict-news.com/boko-haram-worse-isis/ |archivedate=17 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="visionofhumanity.org-p53">{{cite web |title=Global Terrorism Index 2014 |publisher=Institute for Economics and Peace |url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/Global%20Terrorism%20Index%20Report%202014.pdf |page=53 |accessdate=23 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216091255/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/Global%20Terrorism%20Index%20Report%202014.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/10893889/Al-Qaeda-map-Isis-Boko-Haram-and-other-affiliates-strongholds-across-Africa-and-Asia.html |title=Al-Qaeda map: Isis, Boko Haram and other affiliates' strongholds across Africa and Asia |date=12 June 2014 |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref>

===Financing===

====Kidnap for ransom====

Boko Haram is said to have raised substantial sums from kidnap for ransom. In 2013, Boko Haram kidnapped a family of seven French tourists on vacation in Cameroon and two months later released the hostages along with 16 others in exchange for a ransom of $3.15 million.<ref name="Caulderwood">{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/fake-charities-drug-cartels-ransom-extortion-where-islamist-group-boko-haram-gets-its-cash-1585743 |title=Fake Charities, Drug Cartels, Ransom and Extortion: Where Islamist Group Boko Haram Gets Its Cash |work=International Business Times |author=Kathleen Caulderwood |date=16 May 2014 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref>

====Extortion====

As well as extortion from local residents, Boko Haram has claimed to extort money from local state governments. A spokesman of Boko Haram claimed that Kano state governor [[Ibrahim Shekarau]] and Bauchi state governor [[Isa Yuguda]] had paid them monthly.<ref name="thenation20120129">{{cite news|url=http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index.php/mobile/sunday-magazine/cover/34867-tracking-the-sect%E2%80%99s-cash-flow.html |title=Tracking the sect's cash flow |work=The Nation |date=29 January 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2012 |last=Ogundipe |first=Taiwo |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613065340/http://www.thenationonlineng.net/2011/index.php/mobile/sunday-magazine/cover/34867-tracking-the-sect%E2%80%99s-cash-flow.html |archivedate=13 June 2012 }}</ref>

===Ties to other militant groups===

It has long been alleged that Boko Haram had a relationship with al-Qaeda. In 2011, letters from Boko Haram were reportedly found in bin Laden's compound.<ref name="thedailybeast.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/11/boko-haram-s-bin-laden-connection.html |title=Boko Haram's Bin Laden Connection |website=The Daily Beast}}</ref>

Three weeks after the [[2009 Boko Haram uprising]] began, [[al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] expressed sympathy for Boko Haram.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/world/africa/abduction-of-girls-an-act-not-even-al-qaeda-can-condone.html|title=Abduction of Girls an Act Not Even Al Qaeda Can Condone|date=8 May 2014|work=The New York Times|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> Speaking by phone to reporters in November 2012, group spokesman [[Abu Qaqa]] said: "We are together with al-Qaeda, they are promoting the cause of Islam, just as we are doing. Therefore they help us in our struggle and we help them, too." The 2012 Reuters special report details how fighters have trained with al-Qaeda affiliates in small groups over at least 6 years.<ref name="Reuters"/>

According to the UN Security Council listing of Boko Haram under the al-Qaeda sanctions regime in May 2014,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2014/sc11410.doc.htm |title=Security Council Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee |publisher=United Nations}}</ref> the group "has maintained a relationship with [[al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb|AQIM]] for training and material support purposes", and "gained valuable knowledge on the construction of improvised explosive devices from AQIM". The UN found that a "number of Boko Haram members fought alongside al Qaeda affiliated groups in Mali in 2012 and 2013 before returning to Nigeria with terrorist expertise". AQIM is one of al-Qaeda's regional branches, whose leader, [[Abu Musab Abdel Wadoud]], has sworn an oath of allegiance to al-Qaeda's senior leadership.<ref name="longwarjournal.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2014/05/un_adds_boko_haram_t.php |title=UN adds Boko Haram to al Qaeda sanctions list |publisher=longwarjournal.org}}</ref>

Despite historic ties, al-Qaeda central has never officially accepted Boko Haram as an affiliate. The issues between AQ and Boko Haram are related to the extremism of Abubakar Shekau with respect to him declaring the entire general population of Muslims in Nigeria to be non-Muslims. Shekau argues that due to the widespread apostasy of Muslims through voting in elections that it is legitimate to kill Muslim civilians. Al-Qaeda takes the view that the general population should be viewed as Muslim and thus killing civilians is not acceptable.<ref name="nytimes.com"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-boko-haram-nigeria-20150115-story.html |title=How to help Nigerians defeat Boko Haram |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=15 January 2015}}</ref>

In July 2014, Shekau released a 16-minute video where he voiced support for [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]'s head [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], al-Qaeda's head [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] and Afghan Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/africa/2014/07/13/Boko-Haram-voices-support-for-ISIS-Baghdadi.html |title=Boko Haram voices support for ISIS' Baghdadi |website=English.alarabiya.net |accessdate=2016-05-22}}</ref> In March 2015, Shekau formally pledged allegiance to ISIL, which was accepted by the group's spokesman several days later.<ref name="BokoHaramIS"/> The group was nominally renamed 'Wilayat Garb Ifriqiyah' or the Islamic State's 'West African province' and was led by Shekau.

In August 2016, [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] attempted to remove Shekau from his leadership role and replace him with [[Abu Musab al-Barnawi]]. The reason behind this was that Shekau had disobeyed [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]]'s order to cease targeting Muslim civilians. Shekau rejected the move, leading to a split between the groups.

==Response by Nigerian authorities==
The Nigerian military is, in the words of a former British military attaché speaking in 2014, "a shadow of what it's reputed to have once been. It's fallen apart". They are short of basic equipment, including radios and [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armoured vehicles]]. Morale is said to be low. Senior officers are alleged to be skimming military procurement budget funds that are intended to pay for the standard issue equipment of soldiers. The country's defense budget accounts for more than a third of the security budget of $5.8 billion, but only 10 percent is allocated to capital spending.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/09/us-nigeria-military-insight-idUSBREA4809220140509 |title=Boko Haram exploits Nigeria's slow military decline|work=Reuters |author=Tim Cocks |date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> A 2014 [[United States Department of Defense]] assessment stated, funds are being "skimmed off the top", troops are "showing signs of real fear" and are "afraid to even engage".<ref name="Congressional"/>{{rp|9}}

In the summer of 2013, the Nigerian military shut down mobile phone coverage in the three north-eastern states to disrupt the group's communication and ability to detonate IEDs. Accounts from military insiders and data of Boko Haram incidences before, during and after the mobile phone blackout suggest that the shut down was 'successful' from a military- tactical point of view. However it angered citizens in the region (owing to negative social and economic consequences of the mobile shutdown) and engendered negative opinions toward the state and new emergency policies. While citizens and organizations developed various coping and circumventing strategies, Boko Haram evolved from an open network model of insurgency to a closed centralized system, shifting the center of its operations to the [[Sambisa Forest]]. This fundamentally changed the dynamics of the conflict.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jacob | first1 = J.U.U. | last2 = Akpan | first2 = I | year = 2015 | title = Silencing Boko Haram: Mobile Phone Blackout and Counterinsurgency in Nigeria's Northeast region.

In July 2014, Nigeria was estimated to have had the highest number of terrorist killings in the world over the past year, 3477, killed in 146 attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=35643:nigeria-tops-world-terror-attack-fatality-list&catid=49:National%20Security&Itemid=115 |title=Nigeria tops world terror attack fatality list |publisher=defenseWeb |author=Oscar Nkala |date=29 July 2014 |accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref> The governor of Borno, [[Kashim Shettima]], of the opposition [[All Nigeria Peoples Party|ANPP]], said in February 2014:<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/17/us-nigeria-violence-idUSBREA1G1AO20140217 |title=Nigeria Islamists better armed, motivated than army: governor |work=Reuters |author=Felix Onuoh |date=17 February 2014 |accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> {{quote|Boko Haram are better armed and are better motivated than our own troops.

In March 2015, it was reported that Nigeria had employed hundreds of mercenaries from South Africa and the former Soviet Union to assist in making gains against Boko Haram before the 28 March election.<ref>{{cite news | title=Nigeria drafts in foreign mercenaries to take on Boko Haram | author=Ed Cropley and David Lewis | date=12 March 2015 | work=Reuters | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/12/uk-nigeria-violence-mercenaries-idUKKBN0M80VT20150312?irpc=932}}</ref>

In October 2015, General [[David M. Rodriguez]], head of U.S. Africa Command, reported that Boko Haram has lost territory, directly contradicting statements made by Boko Haram. U.S. efforts to train and share intelligence with regional military forces is credited with helping to push back against Boko Haram, but officials warn that the group remains a grave threat.<ref>{{cite news | title=Boko Haram Has Lost Territory in Nigeria, U.S. General Says | author=Julian E.

In April 2018, the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, approved a release of $1bn for the procurement of security equipment to fight insurgency and revolt in the country. This announcement came days after an attack by Boko Haram that left 18 dead in northern Nigeria.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Adetayo|first1=Olalekan|title=Boko Haram: Buhari approves release of $1bn for security equipment|url=http://punchng.com/breaking-boko-haram-buhari-approves-release-of-1bn-for-security-equipment/|website=Punch|publisher=Punch}}</ref>

===United States responses===
In 2012, the [[U.S. Department of State]] had an internal debate on whether to place Boko Haram on its '''list of FTOs''' ([[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|Foreign Terrorist Organizations]]).<ref name="KesslerBoko">{{cite web|author=Glenn Kessler|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/05/19/boko-haram-inside-the-state-department-debate-over-the-terrorist-label/|title=Boko Haram: Inside the State Department debate over the 'terrorist' label|website=The Washington Post|date=19 May 2014}}</ref> The [[Bureau of Counterterrorism]] leaned towards designation while the [[Bureau of African Affairs]] urged caution.<ref name="KesslerBoko" /> Officials from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], the FBI, the CIA, and a number of members of Congress urged the State Department to designate Boko Haram as an FTO.<ref>Josh Rogin, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/07/hillary-s-state-department-refused-to-brand-boko-haram-as-terrorists.html Hillary's State Department Refused to Brand Boko Haram as Terrorists], ''Daily Beast'' (7 May 2014).</ref> The Nigerian government voiced its opposition to an FTO designation, citing concerns that it would raise Boko Haram's stature and have implications for humanitarian aid in the region where Boko Haram operated.<ref name="KesslerBoko" /> Twenty academic experts on Nigeria signed a letter to the State Department urging it not to designate Boko Haram as an FTO, saying that it would hinder NGO efforts in the region and might legitimize the Nigerian Army's human rights abuses in its efforts to fight Boko Haram.<ref name="KesslerBoko" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://carllevan.com/2012/05/boko-haram-letter-to-clinton-from-scholars/|title=Letter to Secretary Clinton from Nigeria Scholars|date=2012-05-21|language=English|access-date=2016-07-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://carllevan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Boko-Haram-FTO-letter-to-Clinton4.pdf|title=Boko Haram FTO letter to Clinton}}</ref>

The U.S. State Department designated Boko Haram and its offshoot [[Ansaru]] as terrorist organizations in November 2013, citing Boko Haram's links with AQIM and its responsibility for "thousands of deaths in northeast and central Nigeria over the last several years including targeted killings of civilians".<ref name="Office of the Spokesperson">{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2013/11/217509.htm|title=Terrorist Designations of Boko Haram and Ansaru |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref> The State Department also cited Ansaru's 2013 kidnapping and execution of seven international construction workers.<ref name="Office of the Spokesperson"/> In the statement it was noted, however, "These designations are an important and appropriate step, but only one tool in what must be a comprehensive approach by the Nigerian government to counter these groups through a combination of law enforcement, political, and development efforts."<ref name="Office of the Spokesperson"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr3209ih/pdf/BILLS-113hr3209ih.pdf |title=A bill to impose sanctions against persons who knowingly provide material support or resources to Boko Haram or its affiliates, associated groups, or agents, and for other purposes |publisher=U.S. Congress |date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref> The State Department had resisted earlier calls to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist group after the [[2011 Abuja United Nations bombing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-112HPRT71725/pdf/CPRT-112HPRT71725.pdf|title=Boko Haram: Emerging Threat to the U.S. Homeland |publisher=[[United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence]]|date=2011}}</ref> The U.S. government does not believe Boko Haram is currently (2014) affiliated with al Qaeda Central, despite regular periodic pledges of support and solidarity from its leadership for al-Qaeda, but is particularly concerned about ties between Boko Haram and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) (including "likely sharing funds, training, and explosive materials").<ref name="Congressional"/><!--see page 7-->

Efforts to cooperate in freeing the Chibok schoolgirls had faltered, largely due to mutual distrust; the infiltration of the military by Boko Haram meant that U.S. officials were wary of sharing raw intelligence data, and the Nigerian military had failed to supply information that might have aided U.S. drone flights in locating the kidnapped girls. The Nigerian government claims that Boko Haram is "the West Africa branch of the world-wide Al-Qaida movement" with connections to [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] in [[Somalia]] and AQIM in Mali. The Nigerian government denies having committed human rights abuses in the conflict, and therefore oppose U.S. restrictions on arms sales, which they see as being based on the U.S. mis-application of the [[Leahy Law]] due to concerns over [[human rights in Nigeria]]. The U.S. had supplied the Nigerian army with trucks and equipment but had blocked the sale of [[Cobra helicopter]]s. In November 2014 the U.S. State department again refused to supply Cobras, citing concerns over the Nigerian military's ability to maintain and use them without endangering civilians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nigeriaembassyusa.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=357&cntnt01origid=15&cntnt01detailtemplate=nigeriadet&cntnt01returnid=108 |title=A Stable and Secure Nigeria: An Asset to America |publisher=Embassy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Washington, D.C. |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-30006066 |title=Boko Haram crisis: Nigeria fury over U.S. arms refusal |work=BBC News|date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/with-schoolgirls-still-missing-fragile-us-nigeria-ties-falter.html |title=With Schoolgirls Taken by Boko Haram Still Missing, U.S.-Nigeria Ties Falter |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Eric Schmidt |date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=cobra/>

On 1 December 2014, the U.S. embassy in Abuja announced that the U.S. had discontinued training a Nigerian battalion at the request of the Nigerian government. A spokesman for the U.S. state department said: "We regret premature termination of this training, as it was to be the first in a larger planned project that would have trained additional units with the goal of helping the Nigerian Army build capacity to counter Boko Haram. The U.S. government will continue other aspects of the extensive bilateral security relationship, as well as all other assistance programs, with Nigeria.

Specific details of the cooperation between the British and Nigerian governments include:

A£13 million programme to educate 100,000 children living in the conflict zone and;

In January 2019, when thousands of refugees from north-east Nigeria were forced to return from [[Cameroon]], despite the continuous threat to civilian lives by Boko Haram jihadists, the United Nations was "extremely alarmed". "This action was totally unexpected and puts lives of thousands of refugees at risk," the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[Filippo Grandi]] said. The UNHCR appealed to Cameroon "to continue its open door and hospitable policy" and stop any more returns.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/19/thousands-of-nigerian-refugees-fleeing-boko-haram-forced-back-by-cameroon|title=Thousands of Nigerian refugees fleeing Boko Haram forced back by Cameroon|accessdate=19 January 2019|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>
