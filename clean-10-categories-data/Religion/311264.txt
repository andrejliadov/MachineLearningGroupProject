The '''American Humanist Association''' ('''AHA''') is a [[501(c) organization|non-profit organization]] in the [[United States]] that advances [[secular humanism]], a philosophy of life that, without [[theism]] or other [[supernatural]] beliefs, affirms the ability and responsibility of human beings to lead personal lives of ethical fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Humanism|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Who_We_Are/About_Humanism|accessdate=2009-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612211444/http://americanhumanist.org/Who_We_Are/About_Humanism|archive-date=2010-06-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Background==
{{Humanism}}
In 1927 an organization called the "Humanist Fellowship" began at a gathering in Chicago. In 1928 the Fellowship started publishing the ''New Humanist'' magazine with  H.G. Creel as first editor. The ''New Humanist'' was published from 1928 to 1936. By 1935 the Humanist Fellowship had become the "Humanist Press Association", the first national association of humanism in the United States.<ref name=Harris>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6XEPjO1-4e0C&pg=PA20&dq=American+Humanist+Association&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jv1WVMPhG7OHsQSNgoHwCA&ved=0CCEQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=American%20Humanist%20Association&f=false Harris, Mark W., ''The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism'', Scarecrow Press, 2009] {{ISBN|9780810863330}}</ref>

The first ''[[Humanist Manifesto I|Humanist Manifesto]]'' was issued by a conference held at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1933. Signatories included the philosopher [[John Dewey]], but the majority were ministers (chiefly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]) and theologians. They identified humanism as an ideology that espouses [[reason]], [[ethics]], and [[social justice|social and economic justice]].<ref>Walter, Nicolas. ''Humanism: What's in the Word?'' (London: RPA/BHA/Secular Society Ltd, 1937), p.43.</ref>

In July 1939 a group of [[Quakers]], inspired by the 1933 [[Humanist Manifesto]], incorporated under the state laws of California the Humanist Society of Friends as a religious, educational, charitable nonprofit organization authorized to issue charters anywhere in the world and to train and ordain its own [[ordination|ministry]]. Upon ordination these [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] were then accorded the same rights and privileges granted by law to [[priests]], ministers, and [[rabbis]] of traditional theistic religions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Humanist Society's Early History|url=http://humanist-society.org/about|accessdate=2012-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210150430/http://humanist-society.org/about/|archive-date=February 10, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==History==
[[Curtis Reese]] was a leader in the 1941 reorganization and incorporation of the "Humanist Press Association" as the American Humanist Association. Along with its reorganization, the AHA began printing ''The Humanist'' magazine. The AHA was originally headquartered in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]], then [[San Francisco, California]], and in 1978 [[Amherst, New York]].<ref name=Harris/> Subsequently, the AHA moved to [[Washington, D.C.]].

In 1952 the AHA became a founding member of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] (IHEU) in Amsterdam, Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web|title=IHEU founding|url=http://www.iheu.org/about|accessdate=2012-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109101806/http://www.iheu.org/about/|archive-date=November 9, 2007|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The AHA was the first national membership organization to support abortion rights. Around the same time, the AHA joined hands with the American Ethical Union (AEU) to help establish the rights of nontheistic conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War. This time also saw Humanists involved in the creation of the first nationwide memorial societies, giving people broader access to cheaper alternatives than the traditional burial. In the late 1960s the AHA also secured a religious tax exemption in support of its [[Celebrant USA Foundation and Institute|celebrant]] program, allowing Humanist celebrants to legally officiate at weddings, perform [[chaplaincy]] functions, and in other ways enjoy the same rights as traditional [[clergy]].

In 1991 the AHA took control of the [[Humanist Society]], a religious Humanist organization that now runs the celebrant program. Since 1991 the organization has worked as an adjunct to the American Humanist Association to certify qualified members to serve in this special capacity as ministers. The Humanist Society's ministry prepares Humanist Celebrants to lead ceremonial observances <ref>{{cite web|title=Humanist Society's Services|url=http://humanist-society.org/|accessdate=2012-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412091912/http://humanist-society.org/|archive-date=April 12, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> After this transfer, the AHA commenced the process of jettisoning its religious tax exemption and resumed its exclusively educational status. Today the AHA is recognized by the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] as a nonprofit, tax exempt, 501(c)(3), publicly supported educational organization.

Membership numbers are disputed, but Djupe and Olson place it as "definitely fewer than 50,000."<ref name=Djupe>[https://books.google.com/books?id=frt7RDOT1PUC&pg=PA24&dq=American+Humanist+Association&hl=en&sa=X&ei=awZXVN7hEenlsAT3uICoCA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&q=American%20Humanist%20Association&f=false Djupe, Paul A. and Olsen, Laura R., "American Humanist Association", ''Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics", Infobase Publishing, 2014]</ref>  The AHA has over 575,000 followers on Facebook and over 42,000 followers on Twitter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/americanhumanist|title=Security Check Required|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311100542/https://www.facebook.com/americanhumanist|archive-date=March 11, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/americnhumanist|title=American Humanist (@americnhumanist) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|access-date=2016-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615101550/https://twitter.com/americnhumanist|archive-date=June 15, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Adjuncts and affiliates==
The AHA is  the supervising organization for various Humanist affiliates and adjunct organizations.

=== Black Humanist Alliance ===
The Black Humanist Alliance of the American Humanist Association was founded in 2016 as a pillar of its new "Initiatives for Social Justice."<ref name="americanhumanist.org">{{Cite web|url=http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2016-05-humanist-group-launches-initiatives-for-racial-justi|title=Humanist Group Launches Initiatives for Racial Justice, Women's Equality and LGBTQ Rights|website=American Humanist Association|access-date=2016-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627064344/http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2016-05-humanist-group-launches-initiatives-for-racial-justi|archive-date=June 27, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Like the Feminist Humanist Alliance and the LGBT Humanist Alliance, the Black Humanist Alliance uses an [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] approach to addressing issues facing the Black community. As its mission states, the BHA "concern ourselves with confronting expressions of religious hegemony in public policy," but is "also devoted to confronting social, economic, and political deprivations that disproportionately impact Black America due to centuries of culturally ingrained prejudices."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blackhumanists.org/mission|title=Mission – The Black Humanist Alliance – Menu|website=blackhumanists.org|access-date=2016-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524060604/http://blackhumanists.org/mission|archive-date=May 24, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Feminist Humanist Alliance===
The Feminist Humanist Alliance (formerly the Feminist Caucus) of the American Humanist Association was established in 1977 as a coalition of  women and men within the AHA to work toward the advancement of [[women's rights]] and equality between the sexes in all aspects of society. Originally called the Women's Caucus, the new name was adopted in 1985 as more representative of all the members of the caucus and of the caucus' goals. Over the years, members of the Caucus have advocated for the passage of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] and participated in various public demonstrations, including marches for women's and civil rights. In 1982, the Caucus established its annual Humanist Heroine Award, with the initial award being presented to [[Sonia Johnson]]. Others receiving the awards have included [[Tish Sommers]], [[Christine Craft]], and [[Fran Hosken]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Feminist Caucus Previous Work|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/What_We_Do/Feminist_Caucus|accessdate=2012-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505061439/http://www.americanhumanist.org/What_We_Do/Feminist_Caucus|archive-date=May 5, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2012 the Caucus declared it would be organizing around two principal efforts: "Refocusing on passing the ERA" and "Promoting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Feminist Caucus of the American Humanist Association|url=http://thehumanist.org/september-october-2012/the-feminist-caucus-of-the-american-humanist-association/|accessdate=2012-09-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024013643/http://thehumanist.org/september-october-2012/the-feminist-caucus-of-the-american-humanist-association/|archive-date=October 24, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2016, the Feminist Caucus reorganized as the Feminist Humanist Alliance as a component of their larger "Initiatives for Social Justice."<ref name="americanhumanist.org"/> As stated on its website, the "refinement in vision" emphasized "FHA's more active partnership with outreach programs and social justice campaigns with distinctly inclusive feminist objectives."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://feministhumanists.org/history|title=History – Feminist Humanist Alliance|website=feministhumanists.org|access-date=2016-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625084750/http://feministhumanists.org/history|archive-date=June 25, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Its current goal is to provide a "movement powered by and for women, transpeople, and genderqueer people to fight for social justice.

=== LGBTQ Humanist Alliance ===
The LGBTQ Humanist Alliance (formerly LGBT Humanist Council) of the American Humanist Association is committed to advancing equality for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] people and their families. The alliance "seeks to cultivate safe and affirming communities, promote humanist values, and achieve full equality and social liberation of LGBTQ persons."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lgbthumanists.org/about/|title=About the LGBTQ Humanist Alliance|website=LGBTQ Humanist Alliance|access-date=2016-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627064353/http://lgbthumanists.org/about/|archive-date=June 27, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Paralleling the Black Humanist Alliance and the Feminist Humanist Alliance, the Council reformed in 2016 as the LGBTQ Humanist Alliance as a larger part of the AHA's "Initiatives for Social Justice."<ref name="americanhumanist.org"/>

===Disaster Recovery===
In 2014, the American Humanist Association (AHA) and [[Foundation Beyond Belief]] (FBB) merged their respective charitable programs Humanist Charities (established in 2005) and Humanist Crisis Response (established in 2011). AHA's Executive Director [[Roy Speckhardt]] commented that, “This merger is a positive move that will grow the relief efforts of the humanist community. The end result will be more money directed to charitable activities, dispelling the false claim that nonbelievers don’t give to charity.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2014-05-humanist-charities-and-humanist-crisis-response-anno|title=Humanist Charities and Humanist Crisis Response Announce Merger|website=American Humanist Association|access-date=2016-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609133914/http://americanhumanist.org/news/details/2014-05-humanist-charities-and-humanist-crisis-response-anno|archive-date=June 9, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Appignani Humanist Legal Center===
[[File:AHLC FINAL LOGO.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Official logo of the AHLC]]The Association launched the Appignani Humanist Legal Center (AHLC) in 2006 to ensure that humanists' constitutional rights are represented in court. Through [[Amicus curiae|amicus]] activity, [[litigation]], and legal advocacy, a team of cooperating lawyers, including Jim McCollum, [[Wendy Kaminer]], and [[Michael Newdow]], provide legal assistance by challenging perceived violations of the [[Establishment Clause]].

* The AHLC's first independent litigation was filed on November 29, 2006, in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]]. Attorney James Hurley, the AHLC lawyer serving as lead counsel, filed suit against the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections on behalf of Plaintiff Jerry Rabinowitz, whose polling place was a church in [[Delray Beach, Florida]]. The church featured numerous religious symbols, including signs exhorting people to “Make a Difference with God” and anti-abortion posters, which the AHLC claimed demonstrated a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]]. In the voting area itself, "Rabinowitz observed many religious symbols in plain view, both surrounding the election judges and in direct line above the voting machines. He took photographs that will be entered in evidence."<ref>{{cite news| last =Jones| first =Susan| title ='Humanists' Challenge Voting Booths in Churches| work =crosswalk.com| date =November 30, 2006| url =http://www.crosswalk.com/1453724| accessdate =2012-03-28| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20131030135540/http://www.crosswalk.com/1453724/| archive-date =October 30, 2013| url-status =dead| df =mdy-all}}</ref> U.S. District Judge [[Donald M.

==Advertising campaigns==
[[File:Humanism.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Bus Campaign]]The American Humanist Association has received media attention for its various advertising campaigns; in 2010, the AHA's campaign was said to be the more expensive than similar ad campaigns from the [[American Atheists]] and [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]].<ref>Laurie Goodstein, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/us/10atheist.html Atheist Groups Promote a Holiday Message: Join Us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308073401/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/us/10atheist.html |date=March 8, 2017 }}, ''New York Times'' (November 9, 2010).</ref>

==National Day of Reason==
The [[National Day of Reason]] was created by the American Humanist Association and the Washington Area Secular Humanists in 2003. In addition to serving as a holiday for [[secularists]], the National Day of Reason was created in response to the [[unconstitutionality]] of the [[National Day of Prayer]]. According to the organizers of the event, the National Day of Prayer "violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]] because it asks federal, state, and local government entities to set aside tax dollar supported time and space to engage in religious ceremonies".<ref name="About National Day of Reason">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationaldayofreason.org/about.php |title=National Day of Reason History |access-date=2012-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408154835/http://www.nationaldayofreason.org/about.php |archive-date=2012-04-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Several organizations associated with the National Day of Reason have organized [[food drive]]s and [[blood donations]], while other groups have called for an end to prayer invocations at city meetings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/crt/blood.htm|title=Positive Protest Against the Day of Prayer!
