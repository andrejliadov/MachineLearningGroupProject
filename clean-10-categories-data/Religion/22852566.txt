<!-- READ THIS FIRST: The use of event vs "alleged event" has been discussed many times on the talk page of this article and on the [[Good Friday]] page, and the result was not to use it. This article includes WP:RS references that state that the general scholarly consensus (per WP:RS/AC) is that the crucifixion was, in fact, a historical event, and hence per WP:LEAD the introduction of the article should not say "supposedly occurred", "was alleged to have occurred", "is a Biblical story", etc. and should say "occurred" based on many talk page discussions. Do not change it to any of those, or a variant of them.  ALSO: The theology concerning the event is discussed later in the article. The introductory sentence introduces the event, not the theology!  --> 
{{Death of Jesus}}
The '''Crucifixion of Jesus''' occurred in 1st-century [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]], most likely between AD 34 and AD 35. Jesus' [[crucifixion]] is described in the four [[canonical gospels]], referred to in the [[New Testament epistles]], attested to by [[#Other accounts and references|other ancient sources]], and is established as a historical event confirmed by non-Christian sources,<ref>{{cite book|author=Eddy, Paul Rhodes and [[Gregory A.

He was then hung between two convicted thieves and, according to the [[Gospel of Mark]], died by the 9th hour of the day (at around 3:00 p.m.). During this time, the soldiers affixed a sign to the top of the cross stating "[[Jesus, King of the Jews|Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews]]" which, according to the [[Gospel of John]] (John 19:20), was written in three languages (Hebrew, Latin, and Greek). They then divided his garments among themselves and cast lots for his seamless robe, according to the Gospel of John. According to the Gospel of John, after Jesus' death, one soldier pierced his side with a spear to be certain that he had died, then [[Five Holy Wounds|blood and water]] gushed from the wound. The Bible describes [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|seven statements]] that Jesus made while he was on the cross, as well as several [[supernatural]] events that occurred.

==New Testament narrative==
{{See also|Gospel harmony}}

The earliest detailed accounts of the death of Jesus are contained in the four [[Biblical canon|canonical]] [[gospel]]s. There are other, more implicit references in the New Testament epistles. In the [[Synoptic Gospel|synoptic]] gospels, [[Jesus predicts his death]] in three separate places.<ref>''St Mark's Gospel and the Christian faith'' by Michael Keene (2002) {{ISBN|0-7487-6775-4}} pp.&nbsp;24–25</ref> All four Gospels conclude with an extended narrative of [[Arrest of Jesus|Jesus' arrest]], [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|initial trial at the Sanhedrin]] and final trial at [[Pilate's court]], where Jesus is flogged, condemned to death, is led to the place of crucifixion initially [[Christ Carrying the Cross|carrying his cross]] before Roman soldiers induce Simon of Cyrene to carry it, and then Jesus is crucified, [[Entombment of Christ|entombed]], and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] from the dead. His death is described as a [[sacrifice]] in the Gospels and other books of the New Testament.<ref name="David Hawkin">{{cite book | last = Hawkin | first =  David J.| title = The twenty-first century confronts its gods: globalization, technology, and war | publisher =SUNY Press | year = 2004 | page =121}}</ref>  In each Gospel these five events in the life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that Gospel's narrative.

After arriving at [[Calvary|Golgotha]], Jesus was offered wine mixed with [[myrrh]] or [[Citrullus colocynthis|gall]] to drink. Matthew's and Mark's Gospels record that he refused this. He was then crucified and hung between two convicted thieves. According to some translations of the original Greek, the thieves may have been bandits or Jewish rebels.<ref>[[Reza Aslan]] (2014).

In the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (written about 93 AD) Jewish historian [[Josephus]] stated ([[s:The Antiquities of the Jews/Book XVIII#Chapter 3|Ant 18.3]]) that Jesus was crucified by Pilate, writing that:<ref name=Theissen81 />

<blockquote>Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man,&nbsp;... He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles&nbsp;... And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross&nbsp;...</blockquote>

Another possible reference to the crucifixion ("hanging", cf. {{Bibleverse|Luke|23:39|KJV}}; [[Galatians 3:13]]) is found in the Babylonian [[Talmud]]:

{{Quote|On the eve of the Passover [[Yeshu]] was hanged. For forty days before the execution took place, a herald went forth and cried, "He is going forth to be stoned because he has practised sorcery and enticed Israel to [[apostasy]]. Anyone who can say anything in his favour, let him come forward and plead on his behalf." But since nothing was brought forward in his favour he was hanged on the eve of the Passover.|[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin 43a]]| ''Babylonian Talmud'' (Soncino Edition)}}

Although the question of the equivalence of the identities of Yeshu and Jesus has at times been debated, many historians agree that the above 2nd-century passage is likely to be about Jesus, [[Peter Schäfer]] stating that there can be no doubt that this narrative of the execution in the Talmud refers to Jesus of Nazareth.<ref>''Jesus in the Talmud'' by Peter Schäfer (2009) {{ISBN|0-691-14318-8}} pp. 141 and 9</ref> [[Robert Van Voorst]] states that the Sanhedrin 43a reference to Jesus can be confirmed not only from the reference itself, but from the context that surrounds it.<ref>Van Voorst, Robert E. (2000). ''Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. {{ISBN|0-8028-4368-9}}. pp.&nbsp;177–118.</ref> However, Sanhedrin 43a relates that Yeshu had been condemned to death by [[Hasmonean dynasty|the royal government of Judea]] – this lineage was stripped of all legal authority upon [[Herod the Great]]'s ascension to the throne in 37 BCE, meaning the execution had to have taken place close to 40 years before Jesus was even born.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/jesusnarr.html |title=The Jesus Narrative In The Talmud |author=Gil Student |publisher=Talmud: The Real Truth About the Talmud |date=2000 |accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref><ref>L.

Although almost all ancient sources relating to crucifixion are literary, in 1968, an archeological discovery just northeast of Jerusalem uncovered the body of a crucified man dated to the 1st century, which provided good confirmatory evidence that crucifixions occurred during the Roman period roughly according to the manner in which the crucifixion of Jesus is described in the gospels.<ref>David Freedman (2000), ''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'', {{ISBN|978-0-8028-2400-4}}, p. 299.</ref> The crucified man was identified as [[Yehohanan ben Hagkol]] and probably died about AD 70, around the time of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish revolt]] against Rome. The analyses at the [[Hadassah Medical School]] estimated that he died in his late 20s. Another relevant archaeological find, which also dates to the 1st century AD, is an unidentified heel bone with a spike discovered in a Jerusalem gravesite, now held by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and displayed in the [[Israel Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/probe/docs/arch-nt.html|title=Archaeology and the New Testament}}</ref><ref>[http://www.allaboutjesuschrist.org/crucifixion.htm Article on the Crucifixion of Jesus]</ref>

There is no consensus regarding the exact date of the crucifixion of Jesus, although it is generally agreed by biblical scholars that it was on a [[Good Friday|Friday]] on or near [[Passover]] ([[Nisan]] 14), during the governorship of Pontius Pilate (who ruled AD 26–36).<ref name="Lémonon 1981 29–32">{{cite book |last=Lémonon |first=J.P. |title=Pilate et le gouvernement de la Judée: textes et monuments, Études bibliques |publisher=Gabalda |location=Paris |year=1981 |pages=29–32}}</ref> Various approaches have been used to estimate the year of the crucifixion, including the canonical Gospels, the chronology of the life of Paul, as well as different [[astronomy|astronomical]] models.

===Path to the crucifixion===

The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] refer to a man called [[Simon of Cyrene]] whom the Roman soldiers order to carry the cross after Jesus initially carries it but then collapses,<ref>{{Bibleref2|Matthew|27:32}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark|15:21}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|23:26}}</ref> while the Gospel of John just says that Jesus "bears" his own cross.{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19:17}} <!-- However, John uses "bastazō" with a figurative meaning of ''enduring'' or ''sustaining''.<ref>{{StrongGreek|941}}</ref> By contrast, the first two accounts use "airō" which literally means to ''raise'', ''take up'', or ''lift'',<ref>{{StrongGreek|142}}</ref> and Luke uses "pherō̄" which literally means to ''bear'', ''carry'', or ''bring forth''.<ref>{{StrongGreek|5342}}</ref> -->

Luke's gospel also describes an interaction between Jesus and the women among the crowd of mourners following him, quoting Jesus as saying "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!' Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us,' and to the hills, 'Cover us.' For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?"{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|23:28–31}}

The [[Gospel of Luke]] has Jesus address these women as "daughters of Jerusalem", thus distinguishing them from the women whom the same gospel describes as "the women who had followed him from Galilee" and who were present at his crucifixion.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|23:46|ESV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|23:55}}</ref>

Traditionally, the path that Jesus took is called [[Via Dolorosa]] ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "Way of Grief" or "Way of Suffering") and is a street in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]]. It is marked by nine of the fourteen [[Stations of the Cross]]. It passes the [[Ecce Homo (church)|Ecce Homo Church]] and the last five stations are inside the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].

There is no reference to a woman named [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]]<ref>Lavinia Cohn-Sherbok, ''Who's who in Christianity'', (Routledge 1998), p. 303.</ref> in the Gospels, but sources such as ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'' describe her as a pious woman of [[Jerusalem]] who, moved with pity as [[Jesus]] carried his cross to [[Golgotha]], gave him her veil that he might wipe his forehead.<ref>''[[Notes and Queries]]'', Volume July 6–December 1852, London, page 252</ref><ref>The Archaeological journal (UK), Volume 7, 1850 p. 413</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15362a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Veronica}}</ref><ref>Alban Butler, 2000 ''Lives of the Saints'' {{ISBN|0-86012-256-5}} p. 84</ref>

===Location===
[[File:Golgotha cross-section.svg|thumb|300px|A diagram of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] and the historical site]]
The precise location of the crucifixion remains a matter of conjecture, but the biblical accounts indicate that it was outside the city walls of Jerusalem,{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19:20}} {{Bibleref2c|Heb.|13:12}} accessible to passers-by{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|27:39}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk.|15:21,29–30}} and observable from some distance away.{{Bibleref2c|Mk.|15:40}} [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] identified its location only as being north of [[Mount Zion]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Onomasticon (Concerning the Place Names in Sacred Scripture) |author=Eusebius of Caesarea |author-link=Eusebius of Caesarea |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_onomasticon_02_trans.htm#G_THE_GOSPELS}}</ref> which is consistent with the two most popularly suggested sites of modern times.

[[Calvary]] as an English name for the place is derived from the Latin word for skull (''calvaria''), which is used in the [[Vulgate]] translation of "place of a skull", the explanation given in all four Gospels of the Aramaic word ''Gûlgaltâ'' (transliterated into the [[Greek language|Greek]] as Γολγοθᾶ (Golgotha)), which was the name of the place where Jesus was crucified.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:33}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|15:22}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|23:33}}; {{bibleverse||John|19:17}}</ref> The text does not indicate why it was so designated, but several theories have been put forward. One is that as a place of public execution, Calvary may have been strewn with the skulls of abandoned victims (which would be contrary to Jewish burial traditions, but not Roman). Another is that Calvary is named after a nearby cemetery (which is consistent with both of the proposed modern sites). A third is that the name was derived from the physical contour, which would be more consistent with the singular use of the word, i.e., the place of "a skull". While often referred to as "Mount Calvary", it was more likely a small hill or rocky knoll.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letter to the Presbyter Faustus |author=Eucherius of Lyon |author-link=Eucherius of Lyon |url=http://homepages.luc.edu/~avande1/jerusalem/sources/eucherius.htm |quote=The three more frequented exit gates are one on the west, another on the east, and a third on the north. As you enter the city from the northern side, the first of the holy places due to the condition of the directions of the streets is to the church which is called the Martyrium, which was by Constantine with great reverence not long ago built up. Next, to the west one visits the connecting places Golgotha and the Anastasis; indeed the Anastasis is in the place of the resurrection, and Golgotha is in the middle between the Anastasis and the Martyrium, the place of the Lord's passion, in which still appears that rock which once endured the very cross on which the Lord was. These are however separated places outside of Mount Sion, where the failing rise of the place extended itself to the north. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613200112/http://homepages.luc.edu/~avande1/jerusalem/sources/eucherius.htm |archive-date=June 13, 2008 }}</ref>

The traditional site, inside what is now occupied by the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in the [[Christian Quarter]] of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]], has been attested since the 4th century. A second site (commonly referred to as Gordon's Calvary<ref>{{cite web|title=General Charles Gordon's Letters Discussing His Discovery of "Cavalry" in Jerusalem|url=http://www.shapell.org/manuscript.aspx?cavalry-crucifixion-sites-identified|work=SMF Primary Source Documents|publisher=Shapell Manuscript Foundation}}</ref> ), located further north of the Old City near a place popularly called the [[Garden Tomb]], has been promoted since the 19th century.

Whereas most Christians believe the [[gibbet]] on which Jesus was executed was the traditional two-beamed cross, the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] hold the view that a single upright stake was used. The Greek and Latin words used in the earliest Christian writings are ambiguous. The [[Koine Greek]] terms used in the New Testament are {{lang|grc-Latn|[[stauros]]}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|σταυρός}}) and {{lang|grc-Latn|xylon}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|ξύλον}}). The latter means wood (a live tree, timber or an object constructed of wood); in earlier forms of Greek, the former term meant an upright stake or pole, but in Koine Greek it was used also to mean a cross.<ref name=LSJ>{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2396298 |author1=Henry George Liddell |author2=Robert Scott |work=A Greek–English Lexicon |title=σταυρός |via=[[Tufts University]] }}</ref> The Latin word {{wikt-lang|la|crux}} was also applied to objects other than a cross.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=crux&highlight=crux |author1=Charlton T.

However, [[early Christianity|early Christian]] writers who speak of the shape of the particular gibbet on which Jesus died invariably describe it as having a cross-beam. For instance, the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], which was certainly earlier than 135,<ref>For a discussion of the date of the work, see [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/barnabas.html Information on Epistle of Barnabas] and Andrew C.

Moses therefore pileth arms one upon another in the midst of the encounter, and standing on higher ground than any ''he stretched out his hands'', and so Israel was again victorious" (Epistle of Barnabas, 12:2–3).</ref> [[Justin Martyr]] (100–165) explicitly says the cross of Christ was of two-beam shape: "That lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.xl.html |title=ANF01. The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr and Irenaeus }}</ref> [[Irenaeus]], who died around the end of the 2nd century, speaks of the cross as having "five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails."<ref>Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus Haereses]]'', [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103224.htm II, xxiv, 4]</ref>

The assumption of the use of a two-beamed cross does not determine the number of nails used in the crucifixion and some theories suggest three nails while others suggest four nails.<ref>''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-3785-9}} p. 826</ref> However, throughout history larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized, at times as high as 14 nails.<ref name=Kitto >''Encyclopedia of Biblical Literature, Part 2'' by John Kitto 2003 {{ISBN|0-7661-5980-9}} p. 591</ref> These variations are also present in the artistic depictions of the crucifixion.<ref name=IreneE >''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' by Irene Earls 1987 {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} p. 64</ref> In the [[Western Church]], before the [[Renaissance]] usually four nails would be depicted, with the feet side by side. After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails, with one foot placed on the other.<ref name=IreneE /> Nails are almost always depicted in art, although [[Roman Empire|Romans]] sometimes just tied the victims to the cross.<ref name=IreneE /> The tradition also carries to Christian [[emblem]]s, e.g. the [[Jesuits]] use three nails under the [[Holy Name of Jesus|IHS monogram]] and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion.<ref>''The visual arts: a history'' by Hugh Honour, John Fleming 1995 {{ISBN|0-8109-3928-2}} p.  526</ref>

The placing of the nails in the hands, or the wrists is also uncertain. Some theories suggest that the Greek word {{lang|grc-Latn|cheir}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|χείρ}}) for hand includes the wrist and that the Romans were generally trained to place nails through [[Destot's space]] (between the [[capitate]] and [[lunate bone]]s) without fracturing any bones.<ref name=Ball82 >''The Crucifixion and Death of a Man Called Jesus'' by David A Ball 2010 {{ISBN|1-61507-128-8}} pp. 82–84</ref> Another theory suggests that the Greek word for hand also includes the forearm and that the nails were placed near the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]] of the [[forearm]].<ref name=Moore639 >''The Chronological Life of Christ'' by Mark E.

Another issue of debate has been the use of a hypopodium as a standing platform to support the feet, given that the hands may not have been able to support the weight. In the 17th century [[Rasmus Bartholin]] considered a number of analytical scenarios of that topic.<ref name=Kitto /> In the 20th century, forensic pathologist [[Frederick Zugibe]] performed a number of crucifixion experiments by using ropes to hang human subjects at various angles and hand positions.<ref name=Moore639 /> His experiments support an angled suspension, and a two-beamed cross, and perhaps some form of foot support, given that in an {{lang|de|Aufbinden}} form of suspension from a straight stake (as used by the [[Nazi]]s in the [[Dachau concentration camp]] during [[World War II]]), death comes rather quickly.<ref>''Crucifixion and the Death Cry of Jesus Christ'' by Geoffrey L Phelan MD, 2009 {{ISBN?}} pp.&nbsp;106–111</ref>

{{main|Sayings of Jesus on the cross}}
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - What Our Lord Saw from the Cross (Ce que voyait Notre-Seigneur sur la Croix) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Crucifixion, seen from the Cross]]'', by [[James Tissot]], c. 1890, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
The Gospels describe various "last words" that Jesus said while on the cross,<ref>Thomas W. Walker, ''Luke'', (Westminster John Knox Press, 2013) p. 84.</ref> as follows:

====Mark / Matthew====
* {{lang|arc-Latn|E′li, E′li, la′ma sa‧bach‧tha′ni?}} {{Bibleref2c|Mt.|27:46}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk.|15:34}} ([[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?").  However, as Aramaic linguist Steve Caruso of [http://aramaicnt.org/what-is-galilean-aramaic/ AramaicNT.org]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aramaicnt.org/what-is-galilean-aramaic/ |title=What is Galilean Aramaic? &#124; The Aramaic New Testament |publisher=Aramaicnt.org |date=March 31, 2015 |accessdate=January 15, 2019}}</ref> explains, Jesus most likely spoke Galilean Aramaic, which would render the pronunciation of these words as follows: {{lang|arc|[http://aramaicnt.org/2015/03/31/my-god-my-god-why-have-you-forsaken-me/ əlahí əlahí ləmáh šəvaqtáni]}}.<ref>http://aramaicnt.org/2015/03/31/my-god-my-god-why-have-you-forsaken-me/</ref>

The only words of Jesus on the cross mentioned in the Mark and Matthew accounts, this is a quotation of [[Psalm 22]]. Since other verses of the same Psalm are cited in the crucifixion accounts, some commentators consider it a literary and theological creation; however, [[Geza Vermes]] points out that the verse is cited in Aramaic rather than the Hebrew in which it usually would have been recited, and suggests that by the time of Jesus, this phrase had become a proverbial saying in common usage.<ref>Geza Vermes, ''The Passion'' (Penguin, 2005) p. 75.</ref> Compared to the accounts in the other Gospels, which he describes as 'theologically correct and reassuring', he considers this phrase 'unexpected, disquieting and in consequence more probable'.<ref>Geza Vermes, ''The Passion'' (Penguin, 2005) p.  114.</ref> He describes it as bearing 'all the appearances of a genuine cry'.<ref>Geza Vermes, ''The Passion'' (Penguin, 2005) p. 122.</ref> [[Raymond E. Brown|Raymond Brown]] likewise comments that he finds 'no persuasive argument against attributing to the Jesus of Mark/Matt the literal sentiment of feeling forsaken expressed in the Psalm quote'.<ref>Raymond Brown, ''The Death of the Messiah'' Volume II (Doubleday, 1994) p. 1051</ref>

====Luke====
* "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." [Some early manuscripts do not have this]{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|23:34}}
* "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise."{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|23:43}}
* "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!"{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|23:46}}

The Gospel of Luke does not include the aforementioned exclamation of Jesus mentioned in Matthew and Mark.<ref>John Haralson Hayes, ''Biblical Exegesis: A Beginner's Handbook'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1987) pp. 104–105. The author suggests this possibly was designed to play down the suffering of Jesus and replace a cry of desperation with one of hope and confidence, in keeping with the message of the Gospel in which Jesus dies confident that he would be vindicated as God's righteous prophet.</ref>

====John====
* "Woman, behold, your son!" {{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19:25–27}}
* "I thirst."{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19:28}}
* "It is finished."{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19:30}}

The words of Jesus on the cross, especially his [[last words]], have been the subject of a wide range of Christian teachings and sermons, and a number of authors have written books specifically devoted to the last sayings of Christ.<ref>David Anderson-Berry, 1871 ''The Seven Sayings of Christ on the Cross'', Glasgow: Pickering & Inglis Publishers</ref><ref>Rev.

====Darkness====
{{main|Crucifixion darkness}}
[[File:Christ at the Cross - Cristo en la Cruz.jpg|thumb|''Christ on the Cross'', by [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]], showing the skies darkened]]
In the synoptic narrative, while Jesus is hanging on the cross, the sky over Judea (or the whole world) is "darkened for three hours," from the sixth to the ninth hour (noon to mid-afternoon). There is no reference to darkness in the Gospel of John account, in which the crucifixion does not take place until after noon.<ref>Edwin Keith Broadhead ''Prophet, Son, Messiah: Narrative Form and Function in Mark'' (Continuum, 1994) p. 196.</ref>

Some ancient Christian writers considered the possibility that pagan commentators may have mentioned this event and mistook it for a solar eclipse, pointing out that an eclipse could not occur during the Passover, which takes place during the full moon when the moon is opposite the sun rather than in front of it. Christian traveler and historian [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] and Christian theologian [[Origen]] refer to Greek historian [[Phlegon of Tralles|Phlegon]], who lived in the 2nd century AD, as having written "with regard to the eclipse in the time of Tiberius Caesar, in whose reign Jesus appears to have been crucified, and the great earthquakes which then took place".<ref>{{cite web |author=Origen |author-link=Origen |title=''Contra Celsum (Against Celsus)'', Book 2, XXXIII |url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/origen162.html}}</ref>

Sextus Julius Africanus further refers to the writings of historian [[Thallus (historian)|Thallus]]: "This darkness Thallus, in the third book of his History, calls, as appears to me without reason, an eclipse of the sun. For the Hebrews celebrate the passover on the 14th day according to the moon, and the passion of our Saviour falls on the day before the passover; but an eclipse of the sun takes place only when the moon comes under the sun."<ref>{{cite book |title=The ante-Nicene fathers |last=Donaldson |first=Coxe |publisher=The Christian Literature Publishing Co. |volume=6 |year=1888 |location=New York |page=136 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5gsAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA136}}</ref> Christian apologist [[Tertullian]] believed the event was documented in the Roman archives.<ref>"In the same hour, too, the light of day was withdrawn, when the sun at the very time was in his meridian blaze. Those who were not aware that this had been predicted about Christ, no doubt thought it an eclipse. You yourselves have the account of the world-portent still in your archives."{{cite web |author=Tertullian |author-link=Tertullian |title=''Apologeticum'' |url=http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian01.html}}</ref>

Colin Humphreys and W. G. Waddington of [[Oxford University]] considered the possibility that a lunar, rather than solar, eclipse might have taken place.<ref name=HumWadJASA>Colin J. Humphreys and W. G.

Historian David Henige dismisses this explanation as 'indefensible'<ref name="henige">{{cite book | last=Henige | first=David P. | author-link=David Henige | title=Historical evidence and argument | publisher=University of Wisconsin Press | isbn=978-0-299-21410-4 | year=2005}}</ref> and astronomer Bradley Schaefer points out that the lunar eclipse would not have been visible during daylight hours.<ref>Schaefer, B.

Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, 103, 645–660.</ref>

Modern biblical scholarship treats the account in the synoptic gospels as a literary creation by the author of the Mark Gospel, amended in the Luke and Matthew accounts, intended to heighten the importance of what they saw as a theologically significant event, and not intended to be taken literally.<ref>Burton L. Mack, ''A Myth of Innocence: Mark and Christian Origins'' (Fortress Press, 1988) p. 296; George Bradford Caird, ''The language and imagery of the Bible'' (Westminster Press, 1980), p. 186; Joseph Fitzmyer, ''The Gospel According to Luke, X–XXIV'' (Doubleday, 1985) p. 1513; William David Davies, Dale Allison, ''Matthew: Volume 3'' (Continuum, 1997) p. 623.</ref> This image of darkness over the land would have been understood by ancient readers, a typical element in the description of the death of kings and other major figures by writers such as [[Philo]], [[Dio Cassius]], [[Virgil]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Josephus]].<ref>David E. Garland, ''Reading Matthew: A Literary and Theological Commentary on the First Gospel'' (Smyth & Helwys Publishing, 1999) p. 264.</ref> [[Géza Vermes]] describes the darkness account as typical of "Jewish eschatological imagery of the day of the Lord", and says that those interpreting it as a datable eclipse are "barking up the wrong tree".<ref>Géza Vermes, ''The Passion'' (Penguin, 2005) pp. 108–109.</ref>

The synoptic gospels state that the [[Veil#Biblical references|veil]] of [[temple in Jerusalem|the temple]] was torn from top to bottom.

The Gospel of Matthew mentions an account of earthquakes, rocks splitting, and the opening of the graves of dead [[saint]]s and describes how these resurrected saints went into the holy city and appeared to many people.{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|27:51-53}}

In the Mark and Matthew accounts, the [[Longinus|centurion in charge]] comments on the events: "Truly this man was the Son of God!"{{Bibleref2c|Mk.|15:39}} or "Truly this was the [[Son of God]]!".{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|27:54}} The Gospel of Luke quotes him as saying, "Certainly this man was innocent!"{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|23:47}}

The historian [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] in the early [[third century]] wrote, describing the day of the crucifixion, "A most terrible darkness fell over all the world, the rocks were torn apart by an earthquake, and many places both in Judaea and the rest of the world were thrown down. In the third book of his Histories, [[Thallus (historian)|Thallos]] dismisses this darkness as a solar eclipse. ..."<ref name=Africanus>[[George Syncellus]], ''Chronography'', [http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/syncellus/#E1 chapter 391].</ref>

A widespread 6.3 magnitude earthquake has been confirmed to have taken place between 26 and 36 AD. This earthquake was dated by counting [[varve]]s (annual layers of sediment) between the disruptions in a core of sediment from [[En Gedi]] caused by it and by an earlier known quake in 31&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jefferson Williams, Markus Schwab and Achim Brauer |title=An early first-century earthquake in the Dead Sea' |journal=International Geology Review |date=Jul 2012 |volume=54 |issue=10 |pages=1219–1228 |doi=10.1080/00206814.2011.639996 |bibcode=2012IGRv...54.1219W |s2cid=129604597 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229810999}}</ref> The authors concluded that either this was the earthquake in Matthew and it occurred more or less as reported, or else Matthew "borrowed" this earthquake which actually occurred at another time or simply inserted an "allegorical fiction".

A number of theories to explain the circumstances of the death of Jesus on the cross have been proposed by [[physicians]] and Biblical scholars. In 2006, Matthew W. Maslen and Piers D. Mitchell reviewed over 40 publications on the subject with theories ranging from [[cardiac rupture]] to [[pulmonary embolism]].<ref>''Medical theories on the cause of death in Crucifixion '' J R Soc Med April 2006 vol. 99 no. 4 185–188.

[[File:Deposition of Christ C2RMF.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Bronzino]]'s ''Deposition of Christ'']]
In 1847, based on the reference in the Gospel of John ({{Bibleref2|John|19:34}}) to blood and water coming out when Jesus' side was pierced with a spear, physician William Stroud proposed the ruptured heart theory of the cause of Christ's death which influenced a number of other people.<ref>William Stroud, 1847, ''Treatise on the Physical Death of Jesus Christ'' London: Hamilton and Adams.</ref><ref>William Seymour, 2003, ''The Cross in Tradition, History and Art'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4527-1}}</ref>

The cardiovascular collapse theory is a prevalent modern explanation and suggests that Jesus died of profound shock. According to this theory, the scourging, the beatings, and the fixing to the cross would have left Jesus dehydrated, weak, and critically ill and that this would have led to cardiovascular collapse.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meridianmagazine.com/byustudies/050325cause.html |title=''The Search for the Physical Cause of Christ's Death'' BYU Studies |access-date=January 20, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210172435/http://meridianmagazine.com/byustudies/050325cause.html |archive-date=February 10, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.frugalsites.net/jesus/death.htm The Physical Death Of Jesus Christ, Study by The Mayo Clinic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131191153/http://www.frugalsites.net/jesus/death.htm |date=January 31, 2009 }} citing studies by Bucklin R (The legal and medical aspects of the trial and death of Christ.

Writing in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', physician William Edwards and his colleagues supported the combined cardiovascular collapse (via [[hypovolemic]] shock) and exhaustion [[asphyxia]] theories, assuming that the flow of water from the side of Jesus described in the [[The Gospel of John|Gospel of John]]{{Bibleref2c-nb|Jn.|19:34}} was [[pericardial fluid]].<ref>Edwards, William D.; Gabel, Wesley J.; Hosmer, Floyd E; ''On the Physical Death of Jesus'', JAMA March 21, 1986, Vol 255, No. 11, pp. 1455–1463 [http://www.godandscience.org/apologetics/deathjesus.pdf]</ref>

[[Pierre Barbet (physician)|Pierre Barbet]], a French physician, and the chief surgeon at Saint Joseph's Hospital in [[Paris]],<ref>[[New Scientist]] October 12, 1978, p. 96</ref> hypothesized that Jesus would have had to relax his muscles to obtain enough air to utter his last words, in the face of exhaustion asphyxia.<ref>Barbet, Pierre.

In 2003, historians FP Retief and L. Cilliers reviewed the history and pathology of crucifixion as performed by the Romans and suggested that the cause of death was often a combination of factors.

In [[Johannine]] "agent Christology" the submission of Jesus to crucifixion is a sacrifice made as an agent of God or servant of God, for the sake of eventual victory.<ref name=Cullmann >''The Christology of the New Testamen''t by Oscar Cullmann 1959 {{ISBN|0-664-24351-7}} p. 79</ref><ref>''The Johannine exegesis of God'' by Daniel Rathnakara Sadananda 2005 {{ISBN|3-11-018248-3}} p. 281</ref> This builds on the [[salvation in Christianity|salvific]] theme of the [[Gospel of John]] which begins in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:29|John 1:29]] with [[John the Baptist]]'s proclamation: "The Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world".<ref name=Pollard >''Johannine Christology'' and the Early Church by T.

A central element in the Christology presented in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by crucifixion happened "with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan".<ref name=Matera67 >''New Testament christology'' by Frank J. Matera 1999 {{ISBN|0-664-25694-5}} p. 67</ref> In this view, as in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#2:23|Acts 2:23]], the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus "at the hands of the lawless" is viewed as the fulfillment of the plan of God.<ref name=Matera67 /><ref>''The speeches in Acts: their content, context, and concerns'' by Marion L. Soards 1994 {{ISBN|0-664-25221-4}} p. 34</ref>

Paul's Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term "the cross of Christ" used in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Galatians#6:12|Galatians 6:12]] may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the gospels.<ref name=Schwarz132 >''Christology'' by Hans Schwarz 1998 {{ISBN|0-8028-4463-4}} pp.&nbsp;132–134</ref> For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant [[eschatological]] consequences, as in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#2:8|1 Corinthians 2:8]].<ref name=Schwarz132 /> In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Philippians#2:8|Philippians 2:8]]) died "at the right time" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Romans#4:25|Romans 4:25]]) based on the plan of God.<ref name=Schwarz132 /> For Paul the "power of the cross" is not separable from the Resurrection of Jesus.<ref name=Schwarz132 />

However, the belief in the redemptive nature of Jesus' death predates the Pauline letters and goes back to the earliest days of Christianity and the [[First Christian church|Jerusalem church]].<ref>''Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity'' by Larry W. Hurtado (2005) {{ISBN|0-8028-3167-2}} pp.&nbsp;130–133</ref> The [[Nicene Creed]]'s statement that "for our sake he was crucified" is a reflection of this core belief's formalization in the fourth century.<ref name=Harris12>''Christian Theology'' by J. Glyndwr Harris (2002) {{ISBN|1-902210-22-0}} pp.&nbsp;12–15</ref>

[[John Calvin]] supported the "agent of God" Christology and argued that in his trial in [[Pilate's Court]] Jesus could have successfully argued for his innocence, but instead submitted to crucifixion in obedience to the Father.<ref name=CalvinC >''Calvin's Christology'' by Stephen Edmondson 2004 {{ISBN|0-521-54154-9}} p. 91</ref><ref>''The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures'' by [[Hughes Oliphant Old]] 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-4775-7}} p. 125</ref> This Christological theme continued into the 20th century, both in the [[Eastern Church|Eastern]] and [[Western Church]]es. In the Eastern Church [[Sergei Bulgakov]] argued that the crucifixion of Jesus was "[[Pre-existence of Christ|pre-eternally]]" determined by the Father before the creation of the world, to redeem humanity from the disgrace caused by the fall of Adam.<ref name=SBulgakov >''The Lamb of God'' by Sergei Bulgakov 2008 {{ISBN|0-8028-2779-9}} p. 129</ref> In the Western Church, [[Karl Rahner]] elaborated on the analogy that the blood of the [[Lamb of God]] (and the water from the side of Jesus) shed at the crucifixion had a cleansing nature, similar to [[Baptism in Christianity|baptismal water]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by Karl Rahner 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} p. 74</ref>

=== Atonement ===
{{main|Atonement in Christianity}}
Jesus' death and resurrection underpin a variety of theological [[soteriology|interpretations]] as to how [[salvation]] is granted to humanity. These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place on the death of Jesus as compared to his words.<ref>For example, see {{Bibleref2|Matthew|6:14–15}}. See also [[Sermon on the Mount]]</ref> According to the [[substitutionary atonement]] view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God.<ref name="Atonement">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Doctrine of the Atonement |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02055a.htm}}</ref> By contrast the [[moral influence theory of atonement]] focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a [[martyr]]dom.<ref>A. J. Wallace, R. D. Rusk ''Moral Transformation: The Original Christian Paradigm of Salvation'', (New Zealand: Bridgehead, 2011) {{ISBN|978-1-4563-8980-2}}</ref> Since the [[Middle Ages]] there has been conflict between these two views within Western Christianity. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Protestants]] typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of [[penal substitution]]. [[Liberal Protestant]]s typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the [[moral influence theory of atonement]]. Both views are popular within the [[Roman Catholic church]], with the [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|satisfaction]] doctrine incorporated into the idea of [[penance]].<ref name="Atonement"/>

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that the Crucifixion of Jesus was part of the Atonement. "The Atonement of Jesus Christ is the foreordained but voluntary act of the Only Begotten Son of God. He offered his life, including his innocent body, blood, and spiritual anguish as a redeeming ransom (1) for the effect of the Fall of Adam upon all mankind and (2) for the personal sins of all who repent, from Adam to the end of the world. Latter-day Saints believe this is the central fact, the crucial foundation, the chief doctrine, and the greatest expression of divine love in the Plan of Salvation." <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Atonement_of_Jesus_Christ|title=Atonement of Jesus Christ – The Encyclopedia of Mormonism|website=eom.byu.edu}}</ref>

In the [[Roman Catholic]] tradition this view of atonement is balanced by the duty of Roman Catholics to perform [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]]<ref name="Encyclopedia">{{cite book |author=Ball, Ann |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=0-87973-910-X |publisher=Our Sunday Visitor |location=Huntington, Ind.}}</ref> which in the encyclical ''[[Miserentissimus Redemptor]]'' of [[Pope Pius XI]] were defined as "some sort of compensation to be rendered for the injury" with respect to the sufferings of Jesus.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Miserentissimus Redemptor'' |publisher=Encyclical of Pope Pius XI |url= https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_08051928_miserentissimus-redemptor_en.html |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140812031528/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_08051928_miserentissimus-redemptor_en.html |archive-date=August 12, 2014 }}</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]] referred to these [[Acts of Reparation]] as the "unceasing effort to stand beside the endless crosses on which the Son of God continues to be crucified."<ref>{{cite web |title=Vatican archives |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_20001021_riparatrici_en.html |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502234831/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_20001021_riparatrici_en.html |archive-date=May 2, 2008 }}</ref>

Among [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] Christians, another common view is [[Christus Victor]].<ref>See [[Christus Victor#Development of the Christus Victor view after Aulén|Development of the Christus Victor view after Aulén]]</ref> This holds that Jesus was sent by God to defeat death and [[Satan]]. Because of his [[Perfection of Christ|perfection]], voluntary death, and resurrection, Jesus defeated Satan and death, and arose victorious. Therefore, humanity was no longer bound in sin, but was free to rejoin God through faith in Jesus.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Johnson, Alan F. |author2=Robert E. Webber |title=What Christians Believe: A Biblical and Historical Summary |publisher=Zondervan |year=1993 |pages=261–263}}</ref>

==Denial of crucifixion==

===Docetism===
In [[Christianity]], [[docetism]] is the doctrine that the phenomenon of Jesus, his historical and bodily existence, and above all the human form of Jesus, was mere semblance without any true reality.<ref>{{harvnb|Brox|1984|p=306}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Schneemelcher|Maurer|1994|p=220}}.</ref> Broadly it is taken as the belief that Jesus only seemed to be human, and that his human form was an illusion.

===Nag Hammadi Manuscripts===
According to the First Revelation of James in the [[Nag Hammadi library]], Jesus appeared to James after apparently being crucified and stated that another person had been inflicted in his place:

{{quote|"The master appeared to him. He stopped praying, embraced him, and kissed him, saying, “Rabbi, I’ve found you. I heard of the sufferings you endured, and I was greatly troubled. You know my compassion. Because of this I wished, as I reflected upon it, that I would never see these people again. They must be judged for what they have done, for what they have done is not right.”
The master said, “James, do not be concerned for me or these people. I am the one who was within me. Never did I suffer at all, and I was not distressed. These people did not harm me. Rather, all this was inflicted upon a figure of the rulers, and it was fitting that this figure should be [destroyed] by them."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meyer |first1=Marvin |last2=Robinson |first2=James |title=The Nag Hammadi Scriptures: The Revised and Updated Translation of Sacred Gnostic Texts Complete in One Volume |date=2009 |publisher=HarperOne |isbn=978-0061626005 |edition=2009 |chapter=The First revelation of James}}</ref>}}

===Islam===
{{main|Islamic views on Jesus' death}}
{{see also|Jesus in Islam}}
Most Islamic traditions, save for a few, categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner.

Professor and scholar [[Mahmoud M. Ayoub]] sums up what the Quran states despite interpretative arguments:

{{quote|"The Quran, as we have already argued, does not deny the death of Christ. Rather, it challenges human beings who in their folly have deluded themselves into believing that they would vanquish the divine Word, Jesus Christ the Messenger of God. The death of Jesus is asserted several times and in various contexts." (3:55; 5:117; 19:33.)<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ayoub |first=Mahmoud M. | author-link=Mahmoud M. Ayoub|date=April 1980 |title=Towards an Islamic christology II: The death of Jesus, reality or delusion (A study of the death of Jesus in Tafsir literature) |journal=The Muslim World |publisher=Hartford Seminary |volume=70 |issue=2 |page=106 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1980.tb03405.x }}</ref>}}

The below quranic verse says Jesus was neither killed nor crucified:

{{Quote| "And they said we have killed the Messiah Isa son of Maryam, the Messenger of God.  They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him, though it was made to appear like that to them; those that disagreed about him are full of doubt, with no knowledge to follow, only supposition: they certainly did not kill him.  On the contrary, God raised him unto himself. God is almighty and wise."|''Quran surah 4 ([[Al-Nisa]] النساء) ayat 157–158''<ref name="Cite quran|4|157|e=158|s=ns">{{Cite quran|4|157|e=158|s=ns}}</ref>}}

Contrary to Christian teachings, some Islamic traditions teach that Jesus [[entering heaven alive|ascended to Heaven]] without being put on the cross, but that God transformed another person to appear exactly like him and to be then crucified instead of him. This thought is supported in misreading an account by [[Irenaeus]], the 2nd-century [[Alexandria]]n [[Gnostic]] [[Basilides]] when refuting what he believes to be a heresy denying the death.<ref>"Wherefore he did not himself suffer death, but Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, being compelled, bore the cross in his stead; so that this latter being transfigured by him, that he might be thought to be Jesus, was crucified, through ignorance and error, while Jesus himself received the form of Simon, and, standing by, laughed at them. For since he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he transfigured himself as he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all" ([http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103124.htm Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', book I, ch. 24, 4]).</ref>

=== Gnosticism ===
Some scriptures identified as Gnostic reject the atonement of Jesus' death by distinguishing the earthly body of Jesus and his divine and immaterial essence. According to the [[Second Treatise of the Great Seth]], [[Yaldabaoth]] (the Creator of the material universe) and his [[Archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]] tried to kill Jesus by crucifixion, but only killed ''their own man'' (that is the body). While Jesus ascended from his body, Yaldabaoth and his followers thought Jesus to be dead.<ref>John Douglas Turner, Anne Marie McGuire ''The Nag Hammadi Library After Fifty Years: Proceedings of the 1995 Society of Biblical Literature Commemoration [in Philadelphia]'' Brill 1997 {{ISBN|978-9004108240}} p. 54</ref><ref>Tuomas Rasimus''Paradise Reconsidered in Gnostic Mythmaking: Rethinking Sethianism in Light of the Ophite Evidence'' Brill, 2009 {{ISBN|978-9047426707}} p. 13</ref> In [[Gnostic Apocalypse of Peter|Apocalypse of Peter]], Peter talks with the savior whom the "priests and people" believed to have killed.<ref>John Douglas Turner, Anne Marie McGuire ''The Nag Hammadi Library After Fifty Years: Proceedings of the 1995 Society of Biblical Literature Commemoration [in Philadelphia]'' Brill 1997 {{ISBN|978-9004108240}} p. 55</ref>

[[Manichaeism]], which was influenced by Gnostic ideas, adhered to the idea that not Jesus, but somebody else was crucified instead.<ref name="gil1992">{{Cite book| volume = 12| pages = 9–58|editor= Joel L. Kraemer | last = Gil| first = Moshe| title = Israel Oriental Studies| chapter = The Creed of Abū ‘Āmir| date = 1992}}</ref>{{rp|41}} Jesus suffering on the cross is depicted as the state of ''light particles'' (spirit) within matter instead.<ref>Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} p. 596</ref>

According to [[Bogomilism]], the crucifixion was an attempt by [[Lucifer]] to destroy Jesus, while the earthly Jesus was regarded as a prophet, Jesus himself was an immaterial being that can not be killed. Accordingly, Lucifer failed and Jesus' sufferings on the cross were only an illusion.<ref>Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} p. 751</ref>

=== Others ===
According to some Christian sects in Japan, Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha. Instead his younger brother, Isukiri,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyotravel/tokyojapantravel/3523/tokyojapantravelinc.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825022848/http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyotravel/tokyojapantravel/3523/tokyojapantravelinc.htm |archive-date=August 25, 2006 |title=Metropolis – Japan Travel: Jesus in Japan |accessdate=January 15, 2019}}</ref> took his place on the cross, while Jesus fled across Siberia to Mutsu Province, in northern Japan. Once in Japan, he became a rice farmer, married, and raised a family with three daughters near what is now [[Shingō, Aomori#Local attractions|Shingō]]. While in Japan, it is asserted that he traveled, learned, and eventually died at the age of 106. His body was exposed on a hilltop for four years. According to the customs of the time, Jesus' bones were collected, bundled, and buried in a mound.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bartlett |first=Duncan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/5326614.stm |title=Programmes &#124; From Our Own Correspondent &#124; The Japanese Jesus trail |work=BBC News |date=September 9, 2006 |accessdate=January 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/110_japson.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310200846/http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/110_japson.shtml |archive-date=March 10, 2007 |title=Jesus In Japan – FT110 |accessdate=January 15, 2019}}</ref> There is also a museum in Japan which claims to have evidence of these claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-little-known-legend-of-jesus-in-japan-165354242/ |title=The Little-Known Legend of Jesus in Japan &#124; History &#124; Smithsonian |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date=January 1, 1970 |accessdate=January 15, 2019}}</ref>

In [[Yazidism]], Jesus is thought of as a "figure of light" who could not be crucified.

Since the crucifixion of Jesus, the cross has become a key element of [[Christian symbolism]], and the crucifixion scene has been a key element of [[Christian art]], giving rise to specific artistic themes such as [[Ecce Homo]], [[The Raising of the Cross]], [[Descent from the Cross]] and [[Entombment of Christ]].

The [[Crucifixion, seen from the Cross (James Tissot)|Crucifixion, seen from the Cross]] by Tissot presented a novel approach at the end of the 19th century, in which the crucifixion scene was portrayed from the perspective of Jesus.<ref>''James Tissot: the Life of Christ'' by Judith F. Dolkart 2009 {{ISBN|1-85894-496-1}} p. 201</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern Art and the Death of a Culture|first=H.

The [[Christian symbolism#Cross and crucifix|symbolism of the cross]] which is today one of the most widely recognized Christian symbols was used from the earliest Christian times and [[Justin Martyr]] who died in 165 describes it in a way that already implies its use as a symbol, although the [[crucifix]] appeared later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14373b.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Symbolism}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07664a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Veneration of Images}}</ref> Masters such as [[Caravaggio]], [[Rubens]] and [[Titian]] have all depicted the [[Commons:Category:Paintings of crucifixion|Crucifixion scene]] in their works.

Devotions based on the process of crucifixion, and the sufferings of Jesus are followed by various Christians. The [[Stations of the Cross]] follows a number of stages based on the stages involved in the crucifixion of Jesus, while the [[Rosary of the Holy Wounds]] is used to meditate on the wounds of Jesus as part of the crucifixion.

The presence of the Virgin Mary under the cross{{Bibleref2c|Jn.|19:26–27}} has in itself been the subject of [[Roman Catholic Marian art|Marian art]], and well known Catholic symbolism such as the [[Miraculous Medal]] and [[Pope John Paul II]]'s Coat of Arms bearing a [[Marian Cross]]. And a number of Marian devotions also involve the presence of the Virgin Mary in Calvary, e.g., Pope John Paul II stated that "Mary was united to Jesus on the Cross".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/jp2bvm3.htm |title=Mary was United to Jesus on the Cross |publisher=EWTN |date=November 1, 1995 |accessdate=January 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19881123en.html |title=Vatican website on 'Behold Your Mother!' |access-date=February 19, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517005051/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19881123en.html |archive-date=May 17, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Well known works of Christian art by masters such as [[Raphael]] (e.g., the [[Mond Crucifixion]]), and [[Caravaggio]] (e.g., his [[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment]]) depict the Virgin Mary as part of the crucifixion scene.
