'''Hinduism and Judaism''' are among the [[Timeline of religion|oldest]] existing religions in the world.  The two share some similarities and interactions throughout both the [[Ancient world|ancient]] and [[modern world]]s.

==Theological similarities==

Scholarly efforts to compare [[Hinduism]] and [[Judaism]] were popular during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], in the process of arguing the deistic worldview.<ref>{{cite book|title = Between Jerusalem and Benares: Comparative Studies in Judaism and Hinduism|author = Hananya Goodman|page = 3|isbn = 9780791417157|publisher = SUNY Press}}</ref> Hananya Goodman states that Hinduism and Judaism have played an important role in European discussions of idolatry, spirituality, primitive theories of race, language, mythologies, etc.<ref>{{cite book|title = Beyond Sacred Violence: A Comparative Study of Sacrifice|author=Kathryn McClymond|page = 33|publisher = JHU Press|isbn = 9780801896293}}</ref>

Both religions were regarded by some scholars to be [[ethnic religion]]s<!--Ethnic in the sense that they present a major race/nationality.-->, and not promoting conversions.<!--Cited as per it was written in the source--> Adherents of both religions, however, are found across the world.<ref>{{cite book|title = Religions and Development|author = Emma Tomalin|page = 109|publisher=Routledge}}</ref> Both religions share common elements in regard to a complicated system of laws, purity codes, and dietary restrictions, for defining their communities.<ref>{{cite book|title = Religions of South Asia: An Introduction|author = Sushil Mittal, Gene Thursby|page = 181|publisher = Routledge|isbn = 9781134593224}}</ref>

Judaism has been compared with [[Brahminism]] by [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh|Osho Rajneesh]]<ref>I Say Unto You (Vol -I), p. 259 - 260</ref> and [[Steve J. Rosen|Steven Rosen]] in their books. They cite the similarities between Brahmins and Jews who viewed themselves as "[[Chosen people|God's chosen people]]." Rosen adds that Brahmins had a "community of priests" while Jews had a "Kingdom of Priests".<ref>"Essential Hinduism", by Steven Rosen, page. 13</ref>

[[David Flusser]] says that the tale of [[Abraham]] has many similarities with a certain story from the [[Upanishads]], stating that "One can easily discover parallels in the Upanishads to the Abraham legend".<ref>{{cite book|title = Judaism and the origins of Christianity|page = 650|author = David Flusser|year = 1988|publisher = Magnes Press, Hebrew University}}</ref><ref>"Between Jerusalem and Benares: Comparative Studies in Judaism and Hinduism", page 35- 40</ref>

American [[biologist]] [[Constantine Samuel Rafinesque]] (1783-1840) in his book ''The American Nations'' discusses linguistic and traditional similarities between the two religions. In one chapter he writes:

<blockquote>"Our Noah- is thus NH (pr NOE) which the Jews since pronounced NUH, and even Mnuh! Exactly the same name as given him by the Hindus! And all meaning repose, with many collateral meanings, lawgiver, collecting people, assembly humanity & c. The laws of M'nu are preserved by the Hindus : to him is also ascribed the substance of the Vedas, and the whole Mosaic history till near his own death. But the Hindus have many- M'nus; Adam and Seth were such, by the names of Adimo and Satya."<ref>{{cite book|title = The American nations; or, Outlines of their general history, ancient and modern|author = Constantine Samuel Rafinesque|page = 104|publisher = Oxford University|url = http://www02.us.archive.org/stream/americannations01rafigoog/americannations01rafigoog_djvu.txt}}</ref></blockquote>

==Scriptures==

[[Barbara Holdrege]] analyzed the comparative analysis in her writing, about the role of scriptures in [[Brahmanical]], [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic]], and [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] traditions, and noted that cosmological conceptions of sacred scripture in which Veda and Torah are portrayed not merely as restricted corpus of texts, but as a multileveled cosmic reality that encircle both historical and transmundane dimensions.{{clarify|reason=This is scholarly gobbledegook; nobody but a scholar of religion can fully understand this. A paraphrasing in laymen's terms would be helpful.|date=October 2014}} She adds further that sacred status, authority, and function of scripture in these traditions are to a certain extent shaped by these conceptions and thus such a study is essential for understanding the role of Veda and Torah as the paradigmatic signs of their respective traditions.<!--Rephrased, but not greatly.--><ref>{{cite book|title = Between Jerusalem and Benares: Comparative Studies in Judaism and Hinduism|author = Hananya Goodman|page = 13|isbn = 9780791417157|publisher = SUNY Press}}</ref>

Judaism, notable for its monotheistic conception of God, has some similarities with those Hindu scriptures that are monotheistic, such as the [[Vedas]].<ref>{{cite book|title = Between Mumbai and Manila: Judaism in Asia Since the Founding of the State of Israel (Proceedings of the International Conference, Held at the Department of Comparative Religion|author=Manfred Hutter|publisher = V&R unipress GmbH|page=241|year = 2013|isbn=9783847101581}}</ref> In Judaism God is [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], while in Hinduism God is both [[Immanence|immanent]] and transcendent.<ref>{{cite book|title = Hinduism, a Way of Life|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J_-rASTgw8wC|author = Sitansu S. Chakravarti|page = 84|year = 1991|isbn = 9788120808997}}</ref>

Different Hindu sects have a variety of beliefs about the nature and identity of god, believing variously in [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], [[pantheism]], and [[panentheism]]. According to the [[Upanishads]], the [[Mahabharata]], and some [[Puranas]], [[Narayana]] is the supreme deity.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Hinduism|author=Gavin Flood|pages=120–121}}</ref> The [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavite]] sect considers [[Vishnu]] or [[Krishna]] to be the supreme god,<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparative Religion|page=38|author=Kedar Nath Tiwari|publisher=Motilal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenknapp.info/gods_and_goddesses_of_vedic_culture.htm|title=Gods and Goddesses of Vedic Culture|website=Stephen Knapp|access-date=2020-04-28|quote=Lord Krishna is one of the most revered and honored of all the Dharmic Gods. As it is explained and concluded in a variety of Vedic texts, [[Krishna]] is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, as it is said in Sanskrit, ''krsnas tu bhagavan svayam'' (Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.3.28) Krishna is the source of all other incarnations and forms of God.}}, [https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/1/3/28/ SB 1.3.28]</ref> while [[Shaivism|Shaivites]] consider [[Shiva]] to be the supreme god.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/shaivism|title=Shaivism|website=ReligionFacts}}</ref>

In Judaism, God is an absolute one, indivisible and incomparable being who is the ultimate cause of all existence. In Hinduism, gods are considered to have a similar status to another when distinct,{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=14}} but may also be seen as "aspects or manifestations of a single, transcendent god",{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=14}} or an "impersonal absolute".{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=14}}

[[Bernard Jackson (professor)|Bernard Jackson]] points out the extent to which legal regulations, customs, and royal ordinances in ''[[Halakha]]'' in the Jewish tradition and ''[[Dharmaśāstra]]'' among Hindus are binding on members of their respective societies. Jackson adds that both Jewish and Hindu law evidence a great sensitivity to the interplay of local custom and authoritative law. He says that in both religions, the writing down of a collection of norms did not necessarily mean that all or even most norms were intended to be enforced, and that the laws connected with royal authority were not necessarily statutory. [[Wendy Doniger]] states that Hinduism and Judaism are alike in their tendency toward [[orthopraxy]] rather than [[orthodoxy]].<ref>{{cite book|title = Between Jerusalem and Benares: Comparative Studies in Judaism and Hinduism|author = Hananya Goodman|page = 16|isbn = 9780791417157|publisher = SUNY Press}}</ref>

==Relations==

===Historical===

Ancient trade and cultural communication between India and the Levant is documented in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' and the accounts surrounding the [[Queen of Sheba]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

[[Bhavishya Purana]] is regarded by a number of scholars to have predicted Judaism's prophet [[Moses]], and similar parallels are found in the Vedas.<ref>"God-fleshed: a chronicle of the comings of Christ", p. 66, by Roy Abraham Varghese, Rachel Varghese, Mary Varghese, url = [https://books.google.com/books?ei=-5WkUuaDEoaOrQeM94HIBA&id=1iMRAQAAIAAJ&dq=moses&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=moses]</ref>

The trade relations of both communities can be traced back to 1,000 BCE and earlier to the time of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] of the Indian subcontinent and the Babylonian culture of Middle East. A Buddhist story describes Indian merchants visiting ''Baveru'' (Babylonia)<ref>{{cite book|title = The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Inter-Religious Dialogue|author=Catherine Cornille|page=417|publisher=Wiley}}</ref> and selling peacocks for public display. Similar, earlier accounts describe monkeys exhibited to the public.<ref>{{cite book|title = Between Jerusalem and Benares: Comparative Studies in Judaism and Hinduism|author = Hananya Goodman|page = 25|isbn = 9780791417157|publisher = SUNY Press}}</ref>

The Torah has also been helpful for understanding relations between these two traditions.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Indian Encyclopaedia: Hinayana-India (Central India)|publisher=Genesis|author=Subodh Kapoor|year=2002|page=2939|isbn = 9788177552676}}</ref> Geographical analysis of Israel suggests that the authors of Torah were talking about India, where the selling of animals such as monkeys and peacocks existed.<ref>{{cite book|title = Between Jerusalem and Benares: Comparative Studies in Judaism and Hinduism|author = Hananya Goodman|page = 28|isbn = 9780791417157|publisher = SUNY Press}}</ref>
Trade connections between India and Palestine and Mediterranean Jewish communities continued, and later, the languages of these cultures started to share linguistic similarities.<ref>{{cite book|title = Between Jerusalem and Benares: Comparative Studies in Judaism and Hinduism|author = Hananya Goodman|pages = 25–30|isbn = 9780791417157|publisher = SUNY Press}}</ref>

===Modern===
[[Persecution of Jews|Jews never faced persecution]] by Hindus, neither are there any records of [[Persecution of Hindus|Hindus facing persecution]] at the hands of Jews. The creation of Israel as a [[Jewish state]] was supported by [[Hindu nationalist]]s, most notably [[M. S. Golwalkar]], who said:

<blockquote>The Jews had maintained their race, religion, culture and language; and all they wanted was their natural territory to complete their Nationality.<ref>{{cite book

The world's first Jewish-Hindu interfaith leadership summit, led by the World Council of Religious Leaders, Hindu organisations in India and Jewish organisations in Israel, as well as the [[American Jewish Committee]], was held in [[New Delhi]] on February 2007.<ref name="wfn">[http://www.wfn.org/2007/02/msg00073.html World's Jewish and Hindu Leaders Gather in New Delhi], wfn.org</ref> The summit included the then [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi]] of Israel [[Yona Metzger]], the [[American Jewish Committee]]'s International Director of Interreligious Affairs [[David Rosen (rabbi)|David Rosen]], a delegation of [[chief rabbi]]s from around the world, and Hindu leaders from India.<ref name="JPIR">{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jerusalem-Report/Arts-And-Culture/The-biggest-show-on-earth |title=The biggest show on earth |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=March 6, 2013 |first=Shulfa |last=Kopf |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name="NYIR">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/us/02hindu.html?_r=0 |title=In Jews, Indian-Americans See a Role Model in Activism |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 2, 2007 |first=Neela |last=Banerjee |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref name="YIR">{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3437865,00.html |title=Indian Muslims protest peace delegation to Israel |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=August 15, 2007 |access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref> During the summit, Rabbi Metzger stated:
{{quote|Jews have lived in India for over 2,000 years and have never been discriminated against. This is something unparalleled in human history.<ref name="JPIR" />}}

[[Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya)|Swami Dayananda]] recognized the similarities of both religions and pointed to the belief in One supreme being, non-conversion, oral recitation of the Veda and the Torah, and the special importance of peace and non-violence. Savarupananda Saraswatiji explained that "Both the Hindu and Jewish communities have a lot in common, we need to discover and nurture these areas for the benefit of millions of people."<ref>{{cite book|title = Between Mumbai and Manila: Judaism in Asia Since the Founding of the State of Israel (Proceedings of the International Conference, Held at the Department of Comparative Religion|author=Manfred Hutter|publisher = V&R unipress GmbH|page=215|year = 2013|isbn=9783847101581}}</ref> This meeting included Rabbis such as [[Daniel Sperber]], [[Yona Metzger]], and others.
