'''''Abie's Irish Rose''''' is a popular comedy by [[Anne Nichols]] familiar from stage productions, films and radio programs. The basic premise involves an [[Irish Catholic]] girl and a young [[Jew]]ish man who marry despite the objections of their families.

==Theater and films==
Although initially receiving poor reviews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] was a commercial hit, running for 2,327 performances between May 23, 1922, and October 1, 1927, at the time the [[List of Broadway shows that have held title of longest-running show|longest run in Broadway theater history]], surpassing the record 1,291 performances set by the [[Winchell Smith]] and [[Frank Bacon (actor)|Frank Bacon]] 1918 play, ''[[Lightnin' (play)|Lightnin']]''.<ref>W.

(musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' in the 1960s. The touring company's male lead was played by a young [[George Brent]], the future Hollywood actor's first major role, and the female lead was played by [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/153781 Peggy Parry].

''Abie's Irish Rose'' was revived on Broadway in 1937 and again in an updated version in 1954.

The play was twice the inspiration for films: in 1928 with [[Charles "Buddy" Rogers]] and [[Nancy Carroll]], directed by [[Victor Fleming]], and in 1946 with Richard Norris and [[Joanne Dru]], directed by A. Edward Sutherland. The 1946 version, produced by [[Bing Crosby]], met with considerable published controversy.<ref name=AFI1946>{{cite web |url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/24671 |work=AFI Catalog of Feature Films 1893 - 1993 |title=Abie's Irish Rose (1946) |accessdate=March 8, 2019}}</ref>

==Radio==
It inspired the weekly [[NBC]] radio series, '''''Abie's Irish Rose''''',  which replaced ''Knickerbocker Playhouse'' and ran from January 24, 1942, through September 2, 1944. Faced with listener protests about its stereotyped ethnic portrayals, the radio series was cancelled in 1945.<ref name=AFI1946 /> Nichols wrote the scripts.

The basic premise was extensively copied, and Anne Nichols sued one imitator, Universal Pictures, which produced ''[[The Cohens and Kellys]]'', a motion picture play about an Irish boy who marries a Jewish girl from feuding families. However, in ''[[Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.]]'',<ref name=Hand1930 /> the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] found for the defendant, holding that [[Copyright in the United States|copyright protection]] cannot be extended to the characteristics of [[stock character]]s in a story, whether it be a book, play or film.

==Plot==
Nichols' original Broadway play had the couple meeting in France during [[World War I]], with the young man having been a soldier and the girl a nurse who had tended to him. In Nichols’ version, the priest and the rabbi from the wedding are also veterans of the same war, and recognize one another from their time in the service.

The rest of the plot was summarized by Judge [[Learned Hand]], in his opinion in the copyright lawsuit filed by Nichols:
:''Abie's Irish Rose'' presents a Jewish family living in prosperous circumstances in New York. The father, a widower, is in business as a merchant, in which his son and only child helps him. The boy has philandered with young women, who to his father's great disgust have always been Gentiles, for he is obsessed with a passion that his daughter-in-law shall be an orthodox Jew. When the play opens the son, who has been courting a young Irish Catholic girl, has already married her secretly before a Protestant minister, and concerned about how to soften the blow for his father securing a favorable reception for his bride, while concealing her faith and race. To accomplish this he introduces her to his father as a Jewish girl in whom he is interested and conceals the fact they are married. The girl somewhat reluctantly agrees to the plan; the father takes the bait, becomes infatuated with the girl, insists that they must marry. He assumes they will because it's the father's idea. He calls in a rabbi, and prepares for the wedding according to the Jewish rite.

:Meanwhile the girl's father, also a widower who lives in California and is as intense in his own religious antagonism as the Jew, has been called to New York, supposing that his daughter is to marry an Irishman and a Catholic. Accompanied by a priest, he arrives at the house at the moment when the marriage is being celebrated, so too late to prevent it, and the two fathers, each infuriated by the proposed union of his child to a heretic, fall into unseemly and grotesque antics. The priest and the rabbi become friendly, exchange trite sentiments about religion, and agree that the match is good. Apparently out of abundant caution, the priest celebrates the marriage for a third time, while the girl's father is inveigled away. The second act closes with each father, still outraged, seeking to find some way by which the union, thus trebly insured, may be dissolved.

:The last act takes place about a year later, the young couple having meanwhile been abjured by each father, and left to their own resources.  They have had twins, a boy and a girl, but their fathers know no more than that a child has been born. At Christmas each, led by his craving to see his grandchild, goes separately to the young folks' home, where they encounter each other, each laden with gifts, one for a boy, the other for a girl. After some slapstick comedy, depending upon the insistence of each that he is right about the sex of the grandchild, they become reconciled when they learn the truth, and that each child is to bear the given name of a grandparent. The curtain falls as the fathers are exchanging amenities, and the Jew giving evidence of an abatement in the strictness of his orthodoxy.<ref name=Hand1930>{{cite web |url=http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm |title=Nichols vs. Universal, Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit |date=November 10, 1930 |location=New York |publisher=Cool Copyright |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717083655/http://www.coolcopyright.com/cases/fulltext/nicholsuniversaltext.htm |archive-date=July 17, 2012 }}</ref>

There have been some variations of the plot, as to setting, or how the characters meet, in later versions of the play or in adaptations for film.

==Critical response==
Although the play was a tremendous popular success, it was universally loathed by the critics. [[Robert Benchley]], then the theatre critic for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, nursed a particular hatred for it. Part of Benchley's job was to write capsule reviews each week. ''Abie's Irish Rose'' he described variously as "Something Awful", "Just about as low as good clean fun can get", "Showing that the Jews and the Irish crack equally old jokes", "The comic spirit of 1876", "People laugh at this every night, which explains why democracy can never be a success", "Will the Marines never come?" and finally "Hebrews 13:8," a Biblical passage that reads, “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and forever.”<ref>{{cite book |last=Herrmann |first=Dorothy |year=1982 |title=With Malice Toward All: The Quips, Lives and Loves of Some Celebrated 20th-Century American Wits |location=New York |publisher=G. P.

"No, Siree! A One-Night Stand with the Algonquin Round Table" <!-- where to find this, when was it written?  --></ref>

Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' of its 1937 revival, [[Wolcott Gibbs]] said that "it had, in fact, the rather eerie quality of a repeated nightmare; the one, perhaps, in which I always find myself in an old well, thick with bats, and can't get out."

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] protested the use of [[Stereotypes of Jews|Jewish stereotypes]] in the 1946 film version, claiming it "will reinforce, if it does not actually create, greater doubt and keener misconceptions, as well as outright prejudice."<ref>{{Cite book|title=In the Long Run: A Cultural History of Broadway's Hit Plays|last=Schildcrout|first=Jordan|publisher=Routledge|year=2019|isbn=978-0367210908|location=New York and London|pages=33}}</ref>

Reflecting on the play's message of social tolerance, [[Brooks Atkinson]] wrote about the 1954 revival, "What was a comic strip joke in 1922 is a serious problem today. Every now and then ''Abie's Irish Rose'' strikes a sensitive chord. For good will is in shorter supply now than it was thirty-two years ago."<ref>Schildcrout, p. 34.</ref>

Contemporary scholar Jordan Schildcrout reads ''Abie's Irish Rose'' in relation to rising anxieties about immigration during the 1920s, as well as to current events such as the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] (1921), the [[Mandate for Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] (1922), and the restrictive [[Immigration Act of 1924]].<ref>Schildcrout, pp. 31-32.</ref> He writes, "In an era when anti-Jewish and anti-Irish sentiments were prominent, the play's representation of ethnic pride might have empowered audiences, while also offering them a happy fantasy of belonging and becoming increasingly 'American,' and therefore not subject to the old prejudices and ethnic rivalries."

== Cultural references==
[[Lorenz Hart]] expressed the feeling of many in the theater world in these lines for [[Manhattan (song)|"Manhattan"]]: "Our future babies we'll take to ''Abie's Irish Rose'' -- I hope they'll live to see it close."

The play was popular enough for its title to be referenced in a pun in the Marx Brothers film ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'', in the lyrics of the [[Cole Porter]] song [[Ace in the Hole (Cole Porter song)|"Ace in the Hole"]], the [[Stephen Sondheim]] song [[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|"I'm Still Here"]], and the song "The Legacy" from the musical ''[[On the Twentieth Century]]''.

==Thematic legacy==

''Abie's Irish Rose'' prefigured the comedy of [[Stiller and Meara]], a husband-and-wife team ([[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]]), who often spiked their routines with references to their differing backgrounds (Stiller is Jewish; Meara was of an Irish Catholic background but converted to Judaism later during their marriage).

The play also provided the central premise for the 1972–73 television series ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'' ([[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]), which starred [[Meredith Baxter Birney|Meredith Baxter]] and [[David Birney]] (who later became husband and wife in real life) in a kind-of reversal of ''Abie's Irish Rose'' in that Birney played struggling young Jewish cab driver/aspiring playwright Bernie Steinberg, whose parents ran a modest family delicatessen, and Baxter played Irish Catholic daughter of wealthy parents, Bridget Fitzgerald, who falls in love with and elopes with Steinberg to the disappointment of both sets of parents. (Although both actors were Protestant, the casting partially inverted real life, Birney being of Irish descent.) The show was attacked by a broad range of Jewish groups for allegedly promoting inter-faith marriage,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/07/archives/bridget-loves-bernie-attacked-by-jewish-groups.html | title='Bridget Loves Bernie' Attacked by Jewish Groups | first=Albin | last=Krebs | date=February 7, 1973 | work=The New York Times}}</ref> and it was cancelled at the end of its first season, despite being the fifth-highest-rated serial of the 1972–1973 year on USA broadcast television.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.interfaithfamily.com/blog/iff/bridget-loves-bernie-during-interfaith-family-month-we-celebrate-their-love/ |title=Bridget Loves Bernie: During Interfaith Family Month We Celebrate Their Love |last=Frisch |first=Rabbi Robyn |date=October 14, 2015 |accessdate=March 8, 2019 |work=Interfaith Family}}</ref>

But two decades later, with social attitudes changing in the US, CBS would run another television series, ''[[Brooklyn Bridge (TV series)|Brooklyn Bridge]]'' (1991–1993), the quasi-autobiographical childhood memoir of its Jewish series creator, [[Gary David Goldberg]], which featured a continuing romance between two main (teenage) characters, a Jewish boy and an Irish Catholic girl. It ran two seasons, with the sixth (two-part) episode of the first season, titled ''War of the Worlds'', exploring the tensions of this inter-faith relationship in its mid-1950s Brooklyn fictional setting. (Goldberg had previously created another quasi-autobiographical television series, ''[[Family Ties]]'', inspired by his adult life, in which the female lead, the alter-ego of his real-life Irish Catholic partner, had been portrayed by Meredith Baxter, the same actress who had starred in the ill-fated ''Bridget Loves Bernie''.)
