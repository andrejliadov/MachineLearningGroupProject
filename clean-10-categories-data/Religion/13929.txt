{{History of religion}}

The '''history of religion''' refers to the written record of human [[religious]] feelings, thoughts, and ideas. This period of religious history begins with the [[invention of writing]] about 5,220 years ago (3200 BC).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wrtg/hd_wrtg.htm |title=The Origins of Writing &#124; Essay &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=2018-03-11}}</ref> The prehistory of [[religion]] involves the study of religious beliefs that existed prior to the advent of written records. One can also study comparative religious chronology through a [[timeline of religion]].  Writing played a major role in standardizing religious texts regardless of time or location, and making easier the memorization of prayers and divine rules. A small part of the Bible involves the collation of oral texts handed down over the centuries.<ref>{{cite book|author=Humayun Ansari|title=The Infidel Within: Muslims in Britain Since 1800|year=2004|publisher=C.

The word ''religion'' as used in the 21st century does not have an obvious pre-colonial translation into non-European languages. The anthropologist Daniel Dubuisson writes that "what the West and the history of religions in its wake have objectified under the name 'religion' is ... something quite unique, which could be appropriate only to itself and its own history".<ref>Daniel Dubuisson.

==History of study==
The school of religious history called the [[History of religions school|''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'']], a late 19th-century [[Germany|German]] school of thought, originated the systematic study of [[religion]] as a [[society|socio]]-[[culture|cultural]] phenomenon. It depicted religion as evolving with human culture, from primitive [[polytheism]] to [[ethical monotheism]].

The ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' emerged at a time when scholarly study of the [[Bible]] and of [[church history]] flourished in Germany and elsewhere (see [[higher criticism]], also called the ''historical-critical method''). The study of religion is important: religion and similar concepts have often shaped civilizations' law and moral codes, social structure, art and music.

==Overview==
The 19th century saw a dramatic increase in knowledge about a wide variety of [[cultures]] and religions, and also the establishment of economic and social histories of [[social progress|progress]]. The "history of religions" school sought to account for this religious diversity by connecting it with the social and economic situation of a particular group.

Typically, religions were divided into stages of progression from simple to complex societies, especially from [[polytheistic]] to [[monotheistic]] and from extempore to organized. One can also classify religions as circumcising and non-circumcising, proselytizing (attempting to convert people of other religion) and non-proselytizing. Many religions share common beliefs.

==Origin==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions|Timeline of religion}}
The earliest archeological evidence of religious ideas dates back several hundred thousand years to the [[Middle Paleolithic|Middle]] and [[Lower Paleolithic]] periods. Archaeologists take apparent intentional burials of [[Archaic humans|early ''Homo sapiens'']] from as early as 300,000 years ago as evidence of religious ideas. Other evidence of religious ideas includes symbolic artifacts from [[Middle Stone Age]] sites in Africa. However, the interpretation of early paleolithic artifacts, with regard to how they relate to religious ideas, remains controversial. Archeological evidence from more recent periods is less controversial. Scientists{{which|date=July 2017}} generally interpret a number of artifacts{{which|date=March 2020}} from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] (50,000-13,000 BCE) as representing religious ideas. Examples of Upper Paleolithic remains associated with religious beliefs include the [[löwenmensch figurine|lion man]], the [[Venus figurines]], cave paintings from [[Chauvet Cave]] and the elaborate ritual burial from [[Sungir]].

In the 19th century researchers proposed various theories regarding the origin of religion, challenging earlier claims of a Christianity-like [[urreligion]]. Early theorists [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (1832-1917) and [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820-1903) emphasised the concept of [[animism]], while archaeologist  [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]] (1834-1913) used the term "[[fetishism]]". Meanwhile, religious scholar [[Max Müller]] (1823-1900) theorized that religion began in [[hedonism]] and folklorist [[Wilhelm Mannhardt]] (1831-1880) suggested that religion began in "naturalism" – by which he meant mythological explanation of natural events.<ref>"Religion". ''Encyclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', 70 vols. Madrid. 1907-1930.</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2017}} All of these theories have since been widely criticized; there is no broad consensus regarding the origin of religion.

[[Pre-pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA) [[Göbekli Tepe]], the oldest religious site yet discovered anywhere<ref name="ArchMag">{{cite web | url= http://www.archaeology.org/0811/abstracts/turkey.html| title= The World's First Temple| work= Archaeology magazine |date= Nov–Dec 2008 | page= 23}}</ref> includes circles of erected massive T-shaped stone pillars, the world's oldest known [[megalith]]s<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qR5TCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA47|title= The Archaeology of Malta|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 9781107006690|page= 47|language= en|last1= Sagona|first1= Claudia|date= 25 August 2015|accessdate= 25 November 2016}}</ref> decorated with [[Abstract art|abstract]], enigmatic [[pictogram]]s and [[sculpture|carved]]-animal reliefs. The site, near the home place of original wild wheat, was built before the so-called [[Neolithic Revolution]], i.e., the beginning of [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] around 9000 BCE. But the construction of Göbekli Tepe implies organization of an advanced order not hitherto associated with [[Paleolithic]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]], or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] societies. The site, abandoned around the time the first agricultural societies started, is still being excavated and analyzed, and thus might shed light on the significance it had had for the religions of older, foraging communities, as well as for the general history of religions.

The [[Pyramid Texts]] from ancient Egypt, the oldest known [[religious texts]] in the world, date to between 2400-2300 BCE.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SieAmOiyGQMC&q=the+pyramid+texts+oldest+religious&pg=PA9|title=An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Literature|last= Budge|first= Wallis|date=January 1997|isbn=0-486-29502-8|page=9|author-link=E.

The earliest records of [[Indian religion]] are the [[Vedas]], composed ca. 1500-1200 [[Hinduism]] during the [[Vedic Period]].

Surviving early copies of religious texts include:

* The [[Upanishads]], some of which date to the mid-first millennium BCE.
* The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], representing fragmentary texts of the Hebrew [[Tanakh]];<ref>

==Axial age==
{{See also|Axial Age}}
Historians have labelled the period from 900 to 200 BCE as the "axial age", a term coined by [[Germany|German]]-Swiss [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] (1883-1969). According to Jaspers, in this era of history "the [[spirituality|spiritual]] foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently... And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today." Intellectual historian [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] has summarized this period as the foundation time of many of humanity's most influential philosophical traditions, including [[monotheism]] in [[Persia]] and [[Canaan]], [[Platonism]] in Greece, [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] in India, and [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] in China. These ideas would become institutionalized in time – note for example [[Ashoka]]'s role in the spread of Buddhism, or the role of [[Neoplatonism and Christianity|platonic philosophy in Christianity]] at its foundation.

The historical roots of Jainism in India date back to the 9th-century BCE with the rise of [[Parshvanatha]] and his non-violent philosophy.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=30}}{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p= 182-183}}{{qn|date=July 2017}}

==Middle Ages==
[[File:Medieval-World-Religions.png|thumb|Medieval world religions]]
[[World religion]]s of the present day established themselves throughout [[Eurasia]] during the [[Middle Ages]] by:

* [[Christianization]] of the [[Western world]]
* [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhist missions to East Asia]]
* the [[decline of Buddhism in India|decline of Buddhism]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]
* the [[spread of Islam]] throughout the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[North Africa]] and parts of [[Europe]] and India

During the Middle Ages, [[Muslim]]s came into conflict with [[Zoroastrian]]s during the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] (633-654); [[Christians]] fought against Muslims during the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]] (7th to 11th centuries), the [[Crusades]] (1095 onward), the [[Reconquista]] (718-1492), the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]] (13th century onwards) and the [[Inquisition]]; [[Shamanism]] was in conflict with [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Taoism|Taoists]], Muslims and Christians during the [[Mongol invasions]] (1206-1337); and Muslims clashed with [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s during the [[Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquest of the Indian subcontinent]] (8th to 16th centuries).

Many medieval religious movements emphasized [[mysticism]], such as the [[Cathars]] and related movements in the West, the Jews in Spain (see [[Zohar]]), the [[Bhakti movement]] in India and [[Sufism]] in Islam. [[Monotheism]] reached definite forms in Christian [[Christology]] and in Islamic [[Tawhid]]. [[Hindu views on monotheism|Hindu monotheist]] notions of [[Brahman]] likewise reached their classical form with the teaching of [[Adi Shankara]] (788-820).

==Modern Ages==
European [[colonisation]] during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and to the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and the [[Philippines]]. The invention of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century played a major role in the rapid spread of the [[Protestant Reformation]] under leaders such as [[Martin Luther]] (1483-1546) and [[John Calvin]] (1509-1564).  Wars of religion broke out, culminating in the [[Thirty Years War]] which ravaged central Europe between 1618 and 1648. The 18th century saw the beginning of [[secularisation]] in Europe, gaining momentum after the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and following. By the late 20th century religion had declined in most of Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|last=Norris|first=Pippa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011}}</ref>

By 2001 people began to use the internet to discover or adhere to their religious beliefs. In January 2000 the website [[beliefnet]] was established, and the following year, every month it had over 1.7 million visitors.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Zabriskie, Phil|url=http://www.time.com:80/time/interactive/religion/god_np.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010608152025/http://www.time.com/time/interactive/religion/god_np.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2001-06-08|title=I Once Was Lost, but Now I'm Wired|magazine=[[Time Asia]]|date=2001-06-04|volume=157|issue=22|access-date=2020-09-02}}</ref>
