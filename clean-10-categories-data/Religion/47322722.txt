The term '''Chinese American church''' refers to [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Local church|churches]] that have congregations in the [[United States]] made up of predominantly [[Chinese people|ethnic Chinese]] congregations.

==Cultural assimilation==
Many Chinese churches originate with the purpose to serve Chinese immigrants who recently arrived from [[China]]. The services are usually done in [[Cantonese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] or other dialects of the Chinese language with the purpose of spreading the gospel to those who cannot understand the English language.  Further purposes of Chinese churches are also to support missionaries to China by helping them with the Mandarin Chinese language and Chinese cultural challenges that he or she may face.

Such churches raise the debate over "assimilation" versus "identity" in a similar fashion with other ethnic churches. The debate mostly revolves around the preservation of the [[Chinese culture]] while keeping the religious purpose of worship.<ref name=assim>{{cite book|author=Fenggang Yang|title=Chinese Christians in America: Conversion, Assimilation, and Adhesive Identities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw1TV4VvY8IC&pg=PA139|date=2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04252-7|pages=139}}</ref>  Most ministries have the purpose of worshipping in the Chinese language.

However, while the older generations tend to be non-English speakers, many churches find themselves being "multi-congregational" by the fact that an English-speaking younger generation is typically served under the same roof.  The problem occurs when the Chinese speaking congregation shrinks and leaves behind the larger non-Chinese speaking members.  Failure to attract new members usually means the end of the church as churches function as businesses. The original purpose of worship is lost.<ref>{{cite thesis|title=Training American-born Chinese pastors to minister in a predominantly Chinese bicultural church|first=Fee Kee|last=Tow|institution=Asbury Theological Seminary|type=PhD Dissertation|year=2008|id={{ProQuest|304814962}}}}</ref>
