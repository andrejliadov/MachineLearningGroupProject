Interfaith, as a faith, does not seek to discover which religion or spiritual path is "right". Rather, it recognizes that everyone is brother and sister, and that at different times and different places we have encountered the [[sacred]] differently.<ref name=meetup/>

==General information==
===The religion===
Living Interfaith Church celebrates differing spiritual paths. They claim that what is the same  in every [[religion]] is the call to compassion, the call to think beyond ourselves, and to recognize that we are all connected.  Interfaith "calls upon us not to ignore our differences, but to rather to respect them, and to realize that each of our paths, in their own special and different way, call us to love and to be loving".<ref>{{cite news| url= http://livinginterfaith.org/?page_id=120|work=livinginterfaith.org|title=Living Interfaith Church FAQ’s | access-date=August 20, 2013}}</ref>

The church views Interfaith as a faith that celebrates humanity's differing spiritual paths. It believes that a person's actions in this world are what count and that humanity is called to engage the world, both with compassion and with love. A stated tenet of the church is to respect all faith traditions and not to ignore their importance or their differences. [[Christianity]] is acknowledged as different from [[Buddhism]]. [[Islam]] is acknowledged as different from [[Humanism]], and so forth. According to the movement, the claim of Interfaith as a faith is that what is the same within all of humanity’s spiritual paths is the call to compassion, to thinking beyond ourselves, and to recognizing that we are all connected.<ref name="Living Interfaith Church FAQ">{{cite web | title=Living Interfaith Church FAQ’s | website=Living Interfaith Church | date=July 13, 2013 | url=http://www.livinginterfaith.org/living-interfaith-church-faqs/ | access-date=March 29, 2018}}</ref>

Greenebaum stated that "interfaith, as a spiritual practice, can serve as a new model for how we deal with each other and a new vision for how we act on our religious beliefs to live compassionate lives and share the world in harmony."<ref name=journal>{{cite journal|last=Swift|first=Diana|title=Why Faith is Better Than Religion|journal=Anglican Journal|date=December 3, 2013}}</ref>
