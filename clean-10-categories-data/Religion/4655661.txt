The fetish shrine is a simple mud hut with some kind of enclosure or fence around it. The priest or priestess performs rituals to consult and seek the favor from his gods in the shrine.  The rituals are performed with money, liquor, animals, and in some places, human sex slaves called [[Ritual servitude|trokosi]], fiashidi, or woryokwe.  The priest is usually chosen through "spiritual nomination of the shrine" through divination.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_lVjByR6r4C&pg=PA330&dq=Fetish+priest#q=Fetish%20priest |title=Ghana: The Bradt Travel Guide - Philip Briggs - Google Books |isbn=9781841623252 |accessdate=2015-03-04|last1=Briggs |first1=Philip |year=2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DRc4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA207&dq=Fetish+priest#q=Fetish%20priest |title=A Historical Geography of Ghana - Kwamina B.

People fear them most often because fetish priests claim they can kill people spiritually.{{cn|date=February 2018}}
