'''Tama''' ({{lang-el|τάμα}}, pl. τάματα ''tamata'') are a form of [[votive offering]] or [[ex-voto]] used in the [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]], particularly the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. Tamata are usually small metal plaques, which may be of base or precious metal, usually with an embossed image symbolizing the subject of prayer for which the plaque is offered. 

== Ceremony and symbolism ==
Tamata may be offered to an [[icon]] or [[shrine]] of a saint as a reminder of a petitioner's particular need, or in gratitude for a prayer answered.

A wide variety of images may be found on tamata, with the images capable of multiple interpretations. A heart may symbolize a prayer for love or a heart problem. Eyes may indicate an eye affliction, hands or legs may indicate maladies of the limbs, a pair of wedding crowns may mean a prayer for a happy marriage, a torso for afflictions of the body, and so forth.

Tamata may be bought in shops selling Greek Orthodox religious items, and then hung with a ribbon on a pole or hooks near an icon or shrine of a saint, the act of which is usually accompanied with a prayer, and sometimes with the lighting of a [[votive candle]]. The destinations of [[pilgrimages]] often include shrines decorated with many tamata. 

One of the most famous [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] votive offerings is that by Saint [[John of Damascus]]. According to [[hagiography|tradition]], while he was serving as [[Vizier]] to the [[Caliph]], he was falsely accused of treachery and his hand was cut off. Upon praying in front of an [[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] his hand was [[miracle|miraculously]] restored. In thanksgiving, he had a silver replica of his hand fashioned and attached it to the icon (''see image at left''). This icon, now called "[[Trojeručica]]" (''The Three-handed'') is preserved at [[Hilandar]] Monastery on [[Mount Athos]].

Tamata may be compared to many forms of Roman Catholic votive offerings, such as the [[Milagro (votive)|Milagros]] traditionally used for healing purposes and as votive offerings in the [[Catholic Culture|Roman Catholic culture]]s of [[Mexico]], the southern [[United States]],  [[Latin America]], and parts of the [[Iberian peninsula]].
