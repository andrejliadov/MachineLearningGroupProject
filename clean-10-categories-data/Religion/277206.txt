'''Free thought''' (sometimes spelled '''freethought''')<ref name="merriam-webster2">{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/free%20thought|title=Free thought – Definition of free thought by Merriam-Webster|access-date=5 August 2020}}</ref><ref name="merriam-webster.com"/> is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[point of view (philosophy)|viewpoint]] which holds that [[belief]]s should not be formed on the basis of [[authority]], [[tradition]], [[revelation]], or [[dogma]], and that beliefs should instead be reached by other methods such as [[logic]], [[reason]], and [[empiricism|empirical observation]]. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', a '''freethinker''' is "a person who forms their own ideas and opinions rather than accepting those of other people, especially in religious teaching." In some contemporary thought in particular, free thought is strongly tied with rejection of traditional social or religious belief systems.<ref name="merriam-webster.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freethinker|title=Freethinker – Definition of freethinker by Merriam-Webster|access-date=12 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-02-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117115830/http://www.iheu.org/glossary/12#letterf |archive-date=2013-01-17}}</ref> The [[cognitive]] application of free thought is known as "freethinking", and practitioners of free thought are known as "freethinkers".<ref name="merriam-webster.com"/> Modern freethinkers consider free thought to be a natural freedom from all negative and illusive thoughts acquired from the society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |title=Nontracts |access-date=12 June 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804135530/http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php |archive-date=4 August 2012}}</ref>

The term first came into use in the 17th century in order to refer to people who inquired into the basis of traditional beliefs which were often accepted unquestioningly. Today, freethinking is most closely linked with [[secularism]], [[atheism]], [[agnosticism]], [[humanism]], [[anti-clericalism]], and [[criticism of religion|religious critique]]. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' defines freethinking as, "The free exercise of reason in matters of religious belief, unrestrained by deference to authority; the adoption of the principles of a free-thinker." Freethinkers hold that knowledge should be grounded in facts, [[scientific method|scientific inquiry]], and logic. The skeptical application of science implies freedom from the intellectually limiting effects of [[confirmation bias]], [[cognitive bias]], [[conventional wisdom]], [[popular culture]], [[urban myth]], [[prejudice]], or [[sectarianism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://freethinkers.com/who-are-the-freethinkers/|title=who are the Freethinkers?|work=Freethinkers.com|access-date=14 February 2018|date=2018-02-13}}</ref>

==Definition==
Atheist author Adam Lee defines free thought as thinking which is independent of revelation, tradition, established belief, and [[argument from authority|authority]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2010/02/what-is-freethought/|title=What Is Freethought?|work=Daylight Atheism|access-date=12 June 2015|date=2010-02-26}}</ref> and considers it as a "broader umbrella" than atheism "that embraces a rainbow of unorthodoxy, religious dissent, skepticism, and unconventional thinking."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/daylight-atheism/9-great-freethinkers-and-religious-dissenters-in-history|title=9 Great Freethinkers and Religious Dissenters in History|author=Adam Lee|work=Big Think|access-date=12 June 2015|date=October 2012}}</ref>

The basic summarizing statement of the essay ''The Ethics of Belief'' by the 19th-century British mathematician and philosopher [[William Kingdon Clifford]] is: "It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."<ref>William Kingdon Clifford, ''The Ethics of Belief'' (1879 [1877]).</ref> The essay became a rallying cry for freethinkers when published in the 1870s, and has been described as a point when freethinkers grabbed the moral high ground.<ref>{{cite book |last=Becker |first=Lawrence and Charlotte |date=2013 |title=Encyclopedia of Ethics (article on "agnosticism") |publisher=Routledge |page=44 |isbn=9781135350963 }}</ref> Clifford was himself an organizer of free thought gatherings, the driving force behind the Congress of Liberal Thinkers held in 1878.

Regarding [[religion]], freethinkers typically hold that there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of [[supernatural]] phenomena.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hastings|first=James|title=Encyclopedia of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAwwaxdKMNAC|isbn=9780766136830|date=2003-01-01}}</ref> According to the [[Freedom from Religion Foundation]], "No one can be a freethinker who demands conformity to a bible, [[creed]], or [[messiah]]. To the freethinker, revelation and faith are invalid, and orthodoxy is no guarantee of truth." and "Freethinkers are convinced that religious claims have not withstood the tests of reason. Not only is there nothing to be gained by believing an untruth, but there is everything to lose when we sacrifice the indispensable tool of reason on the altar of superstition. Most freethinkers consider religion to be not only untrue, but harmful."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.org/faq/feeds/item/18391-what-is-a-freethinker|title=What is a Freethinker? - Freedom From Religion Foundation|access-date=12 June 2015}}</ref>

However, philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote the following in his 1944 essay "The Value of Free Thought:"
{{Quote |text=What makes a freethinker is not his beliefs but the way in which he holds them. If he holds them because his elders told him they were true when he was young, or if he holds them because if he did not he would be unhappy, his thought is not free; but if he holds them because, after careful thought he finds a balance of evidence in their favour, then his thought is free, however odd his conclusions may seem. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}
The whole first paragraph of the essay makes it clear that a freethinker is not necessarily an atheist or an agnostic, as long as he or she satisfies this definition:
{{Quote |text=The person who is free in any respect is free ''from'' something; what is the free thinker free from? To be worthy of the name, he must be free of two things: the force of tradition, and the tyranny of his own passions. No one is ''completely'' free from either, but in the measure of a man's emancipation he deserves to be called a free thinker. |author=Bertrand Russell |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery |source=from the first paragraph}}

[[Fred Edwords]], former executive of the [[American Humanist Association]], suggests that by Russell's definition, [[liberal religion]]ists who have challenged established orthodoxies can be considered freethinkers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |title=Saga Of Freethought And Its Pioneers |work=American Humanist Association |access-date=12 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715023327/http://americanhumanist.org/humanism/Saga_of_Freethought_and_Its_Pioneers |archive-date=15 July 2015}}</ref>

On the other hand, according to [[Bertrand Russell]], atheists and/or agnostics are not necessarily freethinkers. As an example, he mentions [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], whom he compares to a "[[pope]]":
{{Quote |text=what I am concerned with is the doctrine of the modern Communistic Party, and of the Russian Government to which it owes allegiance. According to this doctrine, the world develops on the lines of a Plan called [[Dialectical Materialism]], first discovered by [[Karl Marx]], embodied in the practice of a great state by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and now expounded from day to day by a Church of which Stalin is the Pope. […] Free discussion is to be prevented wherever the power to do so exists; […] If this doctrine and this organization prevail, free inquiry will become as impossible as it was in the middle ages, and the world will relapse into bigotry and obscurantism. |author=[[Bertrand Russell]] |title=The Value of Free Thought. How to Become a Truth-Seeker and Break the Chains of Mental Slavery}}

In the 18th and 19th century, many thinkers regarded as freethinkers were [[deists]], arguing that [[Outline of Christian theology|the nature of God]] can only be known from a study of nature rather than from religious revelation. In the 18th century, "deism" was as much of a 'dirty word' as "atheism", and deists were often stigmatized as either atheists or at least as freethinkers by their Christian opponents.<ref>James E. Force, Introduction (1990) to An Account of the Growth of Deism in England (1696) by William Stephens</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04679b.htm |title=Deism |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |editor-first=Francis |editor-last=Aveling |year=1908 |quote=The deists were what nowadays would be called freethinkers, a name, indeed, by which they were not infrequently known; and they can only be classed together wholly in the main attitude that they adopted, viz. in agreeing to cast off the trammels of authoritative religious teaching in favour of a free and purely rationalistic speculation.... Deism, in its every manifestation was opposed to the current and traditional teaching of revealed religion. |access-date=2012-10-10}}</ref> Deists today regard themselves as freethinkers, but are now arguably less prominent in the free thought movement than atheists.

==Characteristics==
Among freethinkers, for a notion to be considered true it must be testable, [[Verifiability (science)|verifiable]], and logical. Many freethinkers tend to be [[humanism|humanists]], who base [[morality]] on human needs and would find [[meaning of life|meaning]] in human [[compassion]], [[social progress]], art, personal happiness, love, and the furtherance of [[knowledge]]. Generally, freethinkers like to think for themselves, tend to be skeptical, respect [[critical thinking]] and reason, remain open to new concepts, and are sometimes proud of their own [[individuality]]. They would determine truth for themselves – based upon knowledge they gain, answers they receive, experiences they have and the balance they thus acquire. Freethinkers reject [[conformity]] for the sake of conformity, whereby they create their own beliefs by considering the way the world around them works and would possess the intellectual integrity and courage to think outside of accepted [[Social norm|norms]], which may or may not lead them to believe in some [[deity|higher power]].<ref>[https://www.fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ACommonPlace.pdf A COMMON PLACE by Ruth Kelly and Liam Byrne]</ref>

==Symbol==
[[Image:Fiołek ogrodowy wisnia6522.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[pansy]], a symbol of freethought.]]
The [[pansy]] serves as the long-established and enduring symbol of free thought; literature of the [[American Secular Union]] inaugurated its usage in the late 1800s. The reasoning behind the pansy as the symbol of free thought lies both in the flower's name and in its appearance. The pansy derives its name from the [[French language|French]] word ''pensée'', which means "thought". It allegedly received this name because the flower is perceived by some to bear resemblance to a human face, and in mid-to-late summer it nods forward as if deep in thought.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120523184444/http://www.ffrf.org/fttoday/1997/june_july97/gaylor.html A Pansy For Your Thoughts, by Annie Laurie Gaylor, Freethought Today, June/July 1997<!-- Bot generated title -->]
</ref> ''Challenging Religious Dogma: A History of Free Thought'', a pamphlet dating from the 1880s had this statement under the title "The Pansy Badge":<ref>[http://www.leicestersecularsociety.org.uk/PHP_redirected/pansy.php The Pansy of Freethought - Rediscovering A Forgotten Symbol Of Freethought] by Annie Laurie Gaylor</ref> <blockquote>There is . . . need of a [[badge]] which shall express at first glance, without complexity of detail, that basic principle of [[freedom of thought]] for which Liberals of all isms are contending. This need seems to have been met by the Freethinkers of France, Belgium, Spain and Sweden, who have adopted the pansy as their badge. We join with them in recommending this flower as a simple and inexpensive badge of Freethought...Let every [[patriotism|patriot]] who is a Freethinker in this sense, adopt the pansy as his badge, to be worn at all times, as a silent and unobtrusive testimony of his principles. In this way we shall recognize our brethren in the cause, and the enthusiasm will spread; until, before long, the uplifted standard of the pansy, beneath the sheltering folds of the [[United States flag]], shall everywhere thrill men's hearts as the symbol of religious liberty and freedom of conscience."</blockquote>

==History==
[[File:Flor lapida.jpg|thumb|210x210px|Tombstone detail of a freethinker, late 19th century. (Cemetery of Cullera, Spain).]]

===Pre-modern movement===
Critical thought has flourished in the Hellenistic Mediterranean, in the repositories of knowledge and wisdom in [[Ireland]] and in the [[Iran]]ian civilizations (for example in the era of [[Omar Khayyám|Khayyam]] (1048–1131) and his unorthodox [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|''Rubaiyat'']] poems), and in other civilizations, such as the Chinese (note for example the seafaring renaissance of the [[Song dynasty|Southern Song]] dynasty of 1127–1279),<ref>[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Song/song.html Chinese History – Song Dynasty 宋 (www.chinaknowledge.de)]</ref> and on through [[Heresy|heretical]] thinkers on esoteric [[alchemy]] or [[astrology]], to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]].

French physician and writer [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] celebrated "rabelaisian" freedom as well as good feasting and drinking (an expression and a symbol of freedom of the mind) in defiance of the hypocrisies of [[conformist]] [[orthodoxy]] in his [[utopian]] [[Thelema#Fran.C3.A7ois Rabelais|Thelema]] Abbey (from θέλημα: free "will"), the device of which was ''Do What Thou Wilt'':

<blockquote>So had Gargantua established it. In all their rule and strictest tie of their order there was but this one clause to be observed, Do What Thou Wilt; because free people ... act virtuously and avoid vice. They call this honor.
</blockquote>

When Rabelais's hero [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]] journeys to the "Oracle of The Div(in)e Bottle", he learns the lesson of life in one simple word: ''"Trinch!"'', Drink! Enjoy the simple life, learn wisdom and knowledge, as a free human. Beyond puns, irony, and satire, Gargantua's prologue-[[metaphor]] instructs the reader to "break the bone and suck out the substance-full marrow" ("''la substantifique moëlle''"), the core of wisdom.

===Modern movements===
[[File:Freethought.JPG|170px|thumb|Freethought logo]]
The year 1600 is considered a landmark in the era of modern free thought. It was the year of the execution in Italy of [[Giordano Bruno]], a former [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar, by the [[Inquisition]].<ref name=gatti18>{{cite book|last=Gatti|first=Hilary|title=Giordano Bruno and Renaissance Science: Broken Lives and Organizational Power|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, New York|pages=18–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cYumhwTQP8C|access-date=21 March 2014|quote=For Bruno was claiming for the philosopher a principle of free thought and inquiry which implied an entirely new concept of authority: that of the individual intellect in its serious and continuing pursuit of an autonomous inquiry… It is impossible to understand the issue involved and to evaluate justly the stand made by Bruno with his life without appreciating the question of free thought and liberty of expression. His insistence on placing this issue at the center of both his work and of his defense is why Bruno remains so much a figure of the modern world. If there is, as many have argued, an intrinsic link between science and liberty of inquiry, then Bruno was among those who guaranteed the future of the newly emerging sciences, as well as claiming in wider terms a general principle of free thought and expression.|isbn=978-0801487859}}</ref><ref name=montano1>{{cite book|last=Montano|first=Aniello|title=Le deposizioni davanti al tribunale dell'Inquisizione|date=24 November 2007|publisher=La Città del Sole|location=Napoli|page=71|editor=Antonio Gargano|quote=In Rome, Bruno was imprisoned for seven years and subjected to a difficult trial that analyzed, minutely, all his philosophical ideas. Bruno, who in Venice had been willing to recant some theses, become increasingly resolute and declared on 21 December 1599 that he 'did not wish to repent of having too little to repent, and in fact did not know what to repent.' Declared an unrepentant heretic and excommunicated, he was burned alive in the Campo dei Fiori in Rome on 17 February 1600. On the stake, along with Bruno, burned the hopes of many, including philosophers and scientists of good faith like Galileo, who thought they could reconcile religious faith and scientific research, while belonging to an ecclesiastical organization declaring itself to be the custodian of absolute truth and maintaining a cultural militancy requiring continual commitment and suspicion.}}</ref><ref name=birx>{{cite news|last=Birx|first=James|title=Giordano Bruno|url=http://www.theharbinger.org/xvi/971111/birx.html|access-date=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mobile Alabama Harbinger|date=11 November 1997|quote=To me, Bruno is the supreme martyr for both free thought and critical inquiry… Bruno's critical writings, which pointed out the hypocrisy and bigotry within the Church, along with his tempestuous personality and undisciplined behavior, easily made him a victim of the religious and philosophical intolerance of the 16th century. Bruno was excommunicated by the Catholic, Lutheran and Calvinist Churches for his heretical beliefs. The Catholic hierarchy found him guilty of infidelity and many errors, as well as serious crimes of heresy… Bruno was burned to death at the stake for his pantheistic stance and cosmic perspective.}}</ref>

====England====
The term ''freethinker'' emerged towards the end of the 17th century in England to describe those who stood in opposition to the institution of the [[Church of England|Church]], and the literal belief in the [[Bible]]. The beliefs of these individuals were centered on the concept that people could understand the world through consideration of nature. Such positions were formally documented for the first time in 1697 by [[William Molyneux]] in a widely publicized letter to [[John Locke]], and more extensively in 1713, when [[Anthony Collins]] wrote his ''Discourse of Free-thinking,'' which gained substantial popularity. This essay attacks the clergy of all churches and it is a plea for [[deism]].

''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' magazine was first published in Britain in 1881.

====France====
In France, the concept first appeared in publication in 1765 when [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and [[Voltaire]] included an article on ''Liberté de penser'' in their [[Encyclopédie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.8:1431:4.encyclopedie0513.4781541|title=ARTFL Encyclopédie Search Results|volume=9|pages=472|access-date=12 June 2015|date=1751–1772}}</ref> The concept of free thought spread so widely that even places as remote as the [[Jotunheimen]], in [[Norway]], had well-known freethinkers such as [[Jo Gjende]] by the 19th century.<ref name="MEMIM">{{cite web|title=Gjendesheim|url=http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|website=MEMIM|access-date=8 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808194917/http://memim.com/gjendesheim.html|archive-date=8 August 2016|date=2016}}</ref>

[[François-Jean de la Barre|François-Jean Lefebvre de la Barre]] (1745–1766) was a young [[France|French]] nobleman, famous for having been [[torture]]d and [[Decapitated|beheaded]] before his body was burnt on a [[pyre]] along with Voltaire's ''[[Philosophical Dictionary]]''. La Barre is often said to have been executed for not saluting a [[Roman Catholic]] religious procession, but the elements of the case were far more complex.<ref name="Gregory2008">{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Mary Efrosini|title=Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433103735|page=192}}</ref>

In France, Lefebvre de la Barre is widely regarded a symbol of the victims of Christian [[religious intolerance]]; La Barre along with [[Jean Calas]] and [[Pierre-Paul Sirven]], was championed by Voltaire. A second replacement statue to de la Barre stands nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Paris]] at the summit of the butte [[Montmartre]] (itself named from the ''Temple of Mars''), the highest point in [[Paris]] and an [[18th arrondissement of Paris|18th arrondissement]] street nearby the [[Sacré-Cœur, Paris|Sacré-Cœur]] is also named after Lefebvre de la Barre.

The 19th century saw the emergence of a specific notion of ''Libre-Pensée'' ("free thought"), with writer [[Victor Hugo]] as one of its major early proponents. French Freethinkers (''Libre-Penseurs'') associate freedom of thought, political [[anti-clericalism]] and socialist leanings. The main organisation referring to this tradition to this day is the [[Fédération nationale de la libre pensée]], created in 1890.

====Germany====
In Germany, during the period 1815–1848 and before the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]], the resistance of citizens against the dogma of the church increased. In 1844, under the influence of [[Johannes Ronge]] and [[Robert Blum]], belief in the [[Rights of Man|rights of man]], tolerance among men, and [[humanism]] grew, and by 1859 they had established the ''Bund Freireligiöser Gemeinden Deutschlands'' (literally ''Union of Free Religious Communities of Germany''), an association of persons who consider themselves to be religious without adhering to any established and institutionalized church or sacerdotal cult. This union still exists today, and is included as a member in the umbrella organization of free humanists. In 1881 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Ludwig Büchner]] established the ''Deutscher Freidenkerbund'' ([[German Freethinkers League]]) as the first German organization for [[Atheism|atheists]] and agnostics. In 1892 the ''Freidenker-Gesellschaft'' and in 1906 the ''Deutscher Monistenbund'' were formed.<ref name="may">{{cite book |last= Bock| first= Heike | chapter= Secularization of the modern conduct of life?

====Belgium====
{{Main|Organized secularism}}
The [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], along with the two Circles of Free Inquiry (Dutch and French speaking), defend the freedom of critical thought, [[Laity|lay]] philosophy and [[ethics]], while rejecting the [[Appeal to authority|argument of authority]].

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, free thought has existed in organized form since the establishment of De Dageraad (now known as [[De Vrije Gedachte]]) in 1856. Among its most notable subscribing 19th century individuals were Johannes van Vloten, [[Multatuli]], Adriaan Gerhard and [[Domela Nieuwenhuis]].

In 2009, Frans van Dongen established the Atheist-Secular Party, which takes a considerably restrictive view of religion and public religious expressions.

Since the 19th century, free thought in the Netherlands has become more well known as a political phenomenon through at least three currents: liberal freethinking, conservative freethinking, and classical freethinking. In other words, parties which identify as freethinking tend to favor non-doctrinal, rational approaches to their preferred ideologies, and arose as secular alternatives to both clerically aligned parties as well as labor-aligned parties. Common themes among freethinking political parties are "freedom", "liberty", and "[[individualism]]".

==== Switzerland ====
{{Main|Freethinkers Association of Switzerland}}
With the introduction of cantonal [[church tax]]es in the 1870s, [[anti-clericalism|anti-clericals]] began to organise themselves. Around 1870, a "freethinkers club" was founded in [[Zürich]]. During the debate on the Zürich church law in 1883, professor Friedrich Salomon Vögelin and city council member Kunz proposed to [[separation of church and state|separate church and state]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.frei-denken.ch/de/2008/04/geschichte-der-freidenker/ |title=Geschichte der Freidenker |work=FAS website |access-date=10 May 2016 |language=de}}</ref>

====Turkey====
In the last years of the [[Ottoman Empire]], free thought made its voice heard by the works of distinguished people such as [[Ahmet Rıza]], [[Tevfik Fikret]], [[Abdullah Cevdet]], Kılıçzade Hakkı, and [[:tr:Celal Nuri İleri|Celal Nuri İleri]]. These intellectuals affected the [[One-party period of the Republic of Turkey|early period]] of the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]].

====United States====
The Free Thought movement first organized itself in the United States as the "Free Press Association" in 1827 in defense of George Houston, publisher of ''The Correspondent'', an early journal of [[Biblical criticism]] in an era when blasphemy convictions were still possible. Houston had helped found an [[Owenite]] community at Haverstraw, New York in 1826–27. The short-lived ''Correspondent'' was superseded by the ''Free Enquirer'', the official organ of [[Robert Owen]]'s [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] community in Indiana, edited by [[Robert Dale Owen]] and by [[Fanny Wright]] between 1828 and 1832 in New York. During this time Robert Dale Owen sought to introduce the philosophic skepticism of the Free Thought movement into the [[Working Men's Party (New York)|Workingmen's Party]] in New York City. The ''Free Enquirer'''s annual civic celebrations of Paine's birthday after 1825 finally coalesced in 1836 in the first national Free Thinkers organization, the "United States Moral and Philosophical Society for the General Diffusion of Useful Knowledge". It was founded on August 1, 1836, at a national convention at the Lyceum in Saratoga Springs with Isaac S. Smith of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, as president. Smith was also the 1836 [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]]'s candidate for Governor of New York and had also been the Workingmen's Party candidate for Lt. Governor of New York in 1830. The Moral and Philosophical Society published ''The Beacon'', edited by Gilbert Vale.<ref>{{cite book|last= Hugins|first= Walter|title= Jacksonian Democracy and the Working Class: A Study of the New York Workingmen's Movement 1829–1837|year= 1960|publisher= Stanford University Press|location= Stanford|pages= 36–48}}</ref>

Driven by the revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the 19th century saw an [[immigration]] of [[German people|German]] freethinkers and anti-clericalists to the United States (see [[Forty-Eighters]]). In the United States, they hoped to be able to live by their principles, without interference from government and church authorities.<ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin">

Many Freethinkers settled in German immigrant strongholds, including [[St. Louis]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Texas]], where they founded the town of [[Comfort, Texas|Comfort]], Texas, as well as others.<ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/>

These groups of German Freethinkers referred to their organizations as ''Freie Gemeinden'', or "free congregations".<ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/> The first Freie Gemeinde was established in St. Louis in 1850.<ref name="American Irreligion 1966">Demerath, N. J. III and Victor Thiessen, "On Spitting Against the Wind: Organizational Precariousness and American Irreligion," ''The American Journal of Sociology'', 71: 6 (May, 1966), 674–87.</ref> Others followed in Pennsylvania, California, Washington, D.C., New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, Texas, and other states.<ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/><ref name="American Irreligion 1966"/>

Freethinkers tended to be liberal, espousing ideals such as racial, social, and sexual equality, and the abolition of slavery.<ref name="Freethinkers in Wisconsin"/>

The "Golden Age of Freethought" in the US came in the late 1800s. The dominant organization was the [[National Liberal League (United States)|National Liberal League]] which formed in 1876 in Philadelphia. This group re-formed itself in 1885 as the American Secular Union under the leadership of the eminent agnostic orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll]]. Following Ingersoll's death in 1899 the organization declined, in part due to lack of effective [[leadership]].<ref name=ftt>{{cite web|title= National Liberal League|url= http://www.freethought-trail.org/profile.php?By=Person&Page=30|work= The Freethought Trail|publisher= freethought-trail.org|access-date= 9 March 2014}}</ref>

Free thought in the United States declined in the early twentieth century. By the early twentieth century, most free thought congregations had disbanded or joined other mainstream churches. The longest continuously operating free thought congregation in America is the Free Congregation of Sauk County, Wisconsin, which was founded in 1852 and is still active {{as of|2020|lc=on||df=}}. It affiliated with the [[American Unitarian Association]] (now the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]]) in 1955.<ref name="Sauk County Freethinkers">{{cite web | title = History of the Free Congregation of Sauk County: The "Freethinkers" Story | publisher = Free Congregation of Sauk County | date = April 2009 | url = http://www.freecongregation.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=52&Itemid=59 | access-date = 2012-02-05 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120326214734/http://www.freecongregation.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=52&Itemid=59 | archive-date = 2012-03-26 }}</ref> [[D.

====Canada====
In 1873 a handful of secularists founded the earliest known secular organization in [[English Canada]], the Toronto Freethought Association. Reorganized in 1877 and again in 1881, when it was renamed the Toronto Secular Society, the group formed the nucleus of the Canadian Secular Union, established in 1884 to bring together freethinkers from across the country.<ref>[[Ramsay Cook]], ''The Regenerators: Social Criticism in Late Victorian English Canada'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1985), pp. 46–64.</ref>

A significant number of the early members appear to have come from the educated labour "aristocracy", including Alfred F. Jury, J. Ick Evans and J. I. Livingstone, all of whom were leading labour activists and secularists. The second president of the Toronto association, [[T. Phillips Thompson]], became a central figure in the city's labour and social-reform movements during the 1880s and 1890s and arguably Canada's foremost late nineteenth-century labour intellectual. By the early 1880s scattered free thought organizations operated throughout southern [[Ontario]] and parts of [[Quebec]], eliciting both urban and rural support.

The principal organ of the free thought movement in Canada was ''[[Secular Thought]]'' (Toronto, 1887–1911). Founded and edited during its first several years by English freethinker [[Charles Watts (secularist)|Charles Watts]] (1835–1906), it came under the editorship of Toronto printer and publisher James Spencer Ellis in 1891 when Watts returned to England. In 1968 the [[Humanist Association of Canada]] (HAC) formed to serve as an umbrella group for humanists, atheists, and freethinkers, and to champion social justice issues and oppose religious influence on public policy—most notably in the fight to make access to abortion free and legal in Canada.

====Anarchism====
{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}
In the United States of America, <blockquote>"free thought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-Christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' were prominent figures in both free thought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker.'' E.C. Walker was co-editor of the freethought/free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''."<ref name="mises.org">{{cite web|url= https://mises.org/journals/jls/5_3/5_3_4.pdf|title= The Journal of Libertarian Studies|work= Mises Institute|access-date= 12 June 2015|date =2014-07-30}}</ref></blockquote> "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from free thought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''Liberty''...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself."<ref name="mises.org"/>

In Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles: <blockquote> "Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the French individualist [[André Lorulot]], will have its impacts in ''Estudios'' (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselytism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 143]</ref></blockquote> These tendencies would continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of [[Charles-Auguste Bontemps]] (1893-1981) and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazines ''Ética'' and ''[[Iniciales]]'' <blockquote>"there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and [[anti-theist]] obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith, and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin's theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324044614/http://www.viruseditorial.net/pdf/anarquismo%20individualista.pdf Xavier Diez. ''El anarquismo individualista en España (1923–1939)'' Virus Editorial. 2007. p. 152]</ref></blockquote>

In 1901 the Catalan anarchist and freethinker [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.<ref name="Fidler">{{Cite journal|author= Geoffrey C. Fidler |date= Spring–Summer 1985 |title= The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: "Por la Verdad y la Justicia" |journal= History of Education Quarterly |volume= 25 |issue= 1/2 |pages= 103–32 |doi= 10.2307/368893 |jstor= 368893 }}</ref> The schools had the stated goal to "[[Popular education|educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.<ref>

Ferrer's ideas, generally, formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]] in the United States,<ref name="Fidler"/> [[Cuba]], [[South America]] and [[London]]. The first of these started in [[New York City]] in 1911.
