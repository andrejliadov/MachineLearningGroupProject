The status of '''[[religious freedom]] in North America''' varies from country to country. [[State (polity)|States]] can differ based on whether or not they guarantee [[Equality under law|equal treatment under law]] for followers of different religions, whether they establish a [[state religion]] (and the legal implications that this has for both practitioners and non-practitioners), the extent to which religious organizations operating within the country are policed, and the extent to which [[religious law]] is used as a basis for the country's legal code.

There are further discrepancies between some countries' self-proclaimed stances of religious freedom in law and the actual practice of authority bodies within those countries: a country's establishment of religious equality in their [[constitution]] or [[law]]s does not necessarily translate into freedom of practice for residents of the country. Additionally, similar practices (such as having religious organizations register with the government) can have different consequences depending on other [[sociopolitical]] circumstances specific to the countries in question.

<onlyinclude>Every country in North America includes provisions for the freedom of religion or freedom of conscience in its constitution.

==Canada==
{{Main|Freedom of religion in Canada}}
Religious freedom in Canada is a constitutionally protected right as part of [[Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference.

There is no established church, however religious groups can qualify for tax-exemption. The amount of funding religious schools receive varies from province to province. In many provinces religious schools are government funded in the same way other independent schools are. In most parts of Canada there is a Catholic education system alongside the secular "public" education system. They all run on Catholic principles and include religious activities and instruction as a matter of course. They are not exclusively attended by practicing Catholics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which is entrenched in the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], states in the [[preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|preamble]] that Canada "is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law."<ref>{{cite web

Following the [[Cuban Revolution]], in the 1960s Cuba's government polemicized against the Catholic Church, which was accused of being [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] and [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], and priests were imprisoned and harassed by the government.  Additionally, the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] did not allow non-atheists to become party members.<ref name="Oliva, Enrique Lopez 1994" /> Since the 1980s, the government of Cuba has taken an increasingly permissive stance towards religious practice, first thawing relations with Protestant groups which were encouraged to practice their religion, and then later inviting the [[Pope John Paul II]] in the 90s to visit the country (all subsequent [[pope]]s have made official visits to Cuba since then).<ref name="Oliva, Enrique Lopez 1994" /><ref>Jim Yardley, "Praising Pope, Cuban President says he might return to Church."

However, representatives of Mayan groups have complained that their access is limited and subject to other obstacles, such as being required to pay fees.<ref name=":8" />

Public schools may choose to offer religious instruction, but there is no national framework for such classes. Private religious schools are allowed to operate as well.<ref name=":8" />

== Haiti ==
{{See also|Religion in Haiti}}
The [[Constitution of Haiti|constitution]] of [[Haiti]] establishes the freedom of religion. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Haiti)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] oversees and monitors religious groups and laws affecting them. While Catholicism has not been the state religion since 1987, a 19th century [[concordat]] with the [[Holy See]] continues to confer preferential treatment to the Catholic Church, in the form of stipends for clergy and financial support to churches and religious schools. The Catholic Church also retains the right to appoint certain amounts of clergy in Haiti without the government's consent.<ref name=":na9"/>

Religious groups are not required to register with the government, but may do so in order to receive special standing in legal proceedings, tax exemptions, and civil recognition for marriage and baptismal certificates. The government has continually failed to recognize marriages performed by [[Haitian Vodou]] practitioners, despite it being a registered religion. Government officials claim that they are working with the Vodou community to establish a certification process for their clergy in order to resolve this issue. Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has continually not approved a request from the Muslim community to register as a religious group, which has been outstanding since the 1980s. According to the government, this was due to not having received necessary financial documentation as part of the registration process.<ref name=":na9" />

According to the government, Muslims in jail do not reliably have access to halal food and Muslim clergy due to a lack of resources.<ref name=":na9" />

Protestant and Catholic clergy have reported good relations with the government. Representatives of the Vodou and Muslim communities have reported social stigma against their communities, and discrimination in employment.<ref name=":na9" />

== Honduras ==
{{See also|Religion in Honduras}}
The [[Constitution of Honduras|constitution]] of [[Honduras]] establishes the freedom of religion. The [[National Congress of Honduras]] has the power to legally recognize religious groups, which confers to them tax-exempt status and other privileges. The Catholic Church is the only organization legally recognized as a religious group, although other religious groups can register with the government as NGOs. Some religious groups have criticized this as constituting preferential treatment for the Catholic Church at the expense of other groups.<ref name=":10">''[https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/honduras International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Honduras],'' US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.</ref>

The constitution prohibits religious leaders from holding elected office or publicly making political statements. Despite this, some Protestant pastors have been elected to government positions and serve on government advisory bodies. The government also frequently includes Catholic or Protestant prayers as part of official events and ceremonies, which has been criticized by representatives of other religious groups.<ref name=":10" />

Clergy are provided exemptions from being required to testify in court about information acquired from [[Confession (religion)|religious confessions]]. Vicars, bishops, and archbishops of the Catholic Church, as well as similarly high ranking members of other religions, are not required to appear in court if subpoenaed.<ref name=":10" />

Public schools are required to teach secular curricula. Private religious schools also operate in Honduras.<ref name=":10" />

Foreign missionaries must register with the government. Some religious groups have reached agreements with the government to expedite this process.<ref name=":10" />

[[Conscientious objector|Conscientious objection]] to military service is protected by law, including objection on religious grounds.<ref name=":10" />

Some politicians, generally from opposition parties, have regularly used [[antisemitism]] rhetoric in their political statements.<ref name=":10" />

== Jamaica ==
{{See also|Religion in Jamaica}}
The [[Constitution of Jamaica|constitution]] of [[Jamaica]] establishes the freedom of religion and outlaws religious discrimination. A colonial-era law criminalizing [[Obeah]] and [[Myal]] continues to exist, but has rarely been enforced since Jamaica's independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1962.<ref name=":na11"/>

Registration with the government is not mandatory for religious groups, but provides groups with some privileges, such as being able to own land and enter legal disputes as an organization. Groups seeking tax-exempt status must register separately as charities.<ref name=":na11" />

The public school curriculum includes nondenominational religious education. Some public schools are run by religious institutions, but are required to hold to the same standard as other public schools. Religious private schools also operate in Jamaica.<ref name=":na11" />

While [[Rastafari]]ans were once persecuted by the government of Jamaica and routinely harassed by police looking for then-illegal [[cannabis]], the government has since taken steps to accommodate Rastafarians, including the decriminalization of the possession of small amounts of cannabis for religious purposes in 2015, and formal apologies coupled with financial reparations for past actions against the Rastafarian community, such as the [[Coral Gardens incident]]. Rastafarians still face some societal discrimination, particularly when seeking employment, but community representatives have stated that incidences of discrimination have sharply decreased since 2015.<ref name=":na11" />

Representatives of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities in Jamaica have described Jamaican society as being tolerant of religious diversity, and identified the high level of interfaith dialogue as evidence to support this claim.<ref name=":na11" />

==Mexico==
The [[Constitution of Mexico]] and other laws establish and protect the freedom of religion in [[Mexico]].<ref name=":16" />

A precedent of limiting the rights of the church – especially the [[Roman Catholic Church]]– was set by [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Valentín Gómez Farías]] in 1833. Later, President [[Benito Juárez]] enacted a set of laws that came to be known as the ''[[Reform laws|Leyes de Reforma]]'' (or Reform laws) between 1859 and 1863 in the backdrop of the ''[[Reform War]]''. These laws mandated, among other things, the separation of church and state, allowed for civil marriages and a [[civil registry]], and confiscated the church's property.

Tensions also existed between the Roman Catholic Church and the post-[[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]] Mexican government. Severe restrictions on the rights of the Church and members of the clergy were written into the country's [[1917 Constitution of Mexico|1917 constitution]] that led to the eruption of the [[Cristero War]] in 1926. In 1992 the government reestablished diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See]] and lifted almost all restrictions on the Catholic Church. This later action included granting all religious groups legal status, conceding them limited property rights, and lifting restrictions on the number of priests in the country. However, the law continues to mandate a strict separation of church and state. The constitution still bars members of the clergy from holding public office, advocating partisan political views, supporting political candidates, or opposing the laws or institutions of the state.

The constitution provides that [[Education in Mexico|education]] should avoid privileges of religion, and that one religion or its members may not be given preference in education over another. Religious instruction is prohibited in public schools; however, religious associations are free to maintain private schools, which receive no public funds.

Religious groups may not own or administer broadcast radio or television stations. Government permission is required for commercial broadcast radio or television to transmit religious programming.<ref name=":16">{{cite report|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2011/wha/192987.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2011 : Mexico |date=July 30, 2012 |publisher=U.S. Department of State}}</ref>

== Nicaragua ==
{{See also|Religion in Nicaragua}}
The [[Constitution of Nicaragua|constitution]] of [[Nicaragua]] prohibits religious discrimination and establishes the freedom of religion. It declares that Nicaragua has no state religion, but it also empowers government controlled, community-level organizations called [[Family Committees]] to promote "Christian values" at a community level.<ref name=":na12"/>

Religious groups may register with the government through a process similar to that which is used by NGOs. Registration allows organizations to enter legal contracts and provides some tax exemptions.<ref name=":na12" />

According to the United States [[International Religious Freedom Act of 1998|International Religious Freedom Report]], Nicaragua's government gives preferential treatment to religious organizations with pro-government political stances, and uses bureaucratic measures to impede the activities of religious groups that have been critical of the government. Some representatives of Christian groups have also made statements that are critical of the government's usage of Catholic rhetoric and its incorporation of Catholic traditions as government-backed celebrations.<ref name=":na12" />

Religious education is included as part of a civics curriculum in schools.<ref name=":na12" />

==Panama==
{{Main|Freedom of religion in Panama}}
The [[Constitution of Panama]] provides for freedom of [[religion]], with some qualifications, and other laws and policies contribute to the generally free practice of religion. The law at all levels protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private actors. The Government generally respects religious freedom in practice. In 2007, the US government received no reports of societal abuses or [[discrimination]] based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice. The Constitution dictates that Catholicism be taught in public schools; however, parents have the right to exempt their children from religious instruction. The numerical predominance of Catholicism and the consideration given to it in the Constitution generally have not prejudiced other religious groups.<ref name="us">United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

Religious organizations are not required to register with the government, but doing so adds them to a database through which the government sends up to date information about policies regarding religion, and allows them to operate as charities.<ref name=":13" />

Public schools include Christian religious instruction and daily prayers, which are optional for students who do not wish to attend them. Religious groups are allowed to establish their own private schools.<ref name=":13" />

According to the [[Organization for Rastafarians in Unity]], Rastafarians in Saint Kitts and Nevis face discrimination. [[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]], a Rastafarian religious sacrament, is illegal in Saint Kitts and Nevis. While [[dreadlocks]] are not illegal, many private businesses do not allow their employees to wear them, and prisoners in jail are forced to have their dreadlocks shaved off. The ORU has also reported police harassment of Rastafarians and limited access to public spaces for religious purposes, as well as stating that Rastafarians face employment discrimination in the private sector.<ref name=":13" />

== Saint Lucia ==

The constitution of [[Saint Lucia]] establishes the freedom of religion, and prohibits religious instruction without consent in schools, prisons, and the military. An anti-blasphemy law remains part of the legal code of Saint Lucia but is not enforced.<ref name=":14">''[https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/saint-lucia International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Saint Lucia],'' US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.</ref>

The government requires religious organizations with more than 250 members to register with the government. Upon registering, the groups can further apply for concessions such as tax breaks.<ref name=":14" />

Public schools include optional nondenominational religious education courses for students. Religious groups can run private schools where they are allowed to teach their religion; the government provides about 50% of the funding for these schools.<ref name=":14" />

There are no restrictions on foreign missionaries, although they are required to register with the government to receive a labor permit before entering the country.<ref name=":14" />

Rastafarians in Saint Lucia have criticized the government's prohibition of [[cannabis]], as this discourages them from engaging in certain religious rituals. Rastafarians are also subject to police harassment in connection with cannabis. The government only began recognizing Rastafarian marriages (and thus their children's inheritance rights) in 2017.<ref name=":14" />

Muslims in Saint Lucia have been subjected to harassment, especially when wearing religious attire.<ref name=":14" />

== Saint Vincent and the Grenadines ==
{{See also|Demographics of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines}}
The constitution of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] states that the country "is founded on the belief in the supremacy of God". It further establishes the freedom of conscience and the right to free religious practice in public or private. An anti-blasphemy law is part of the legal code but is not enforced.<ref name=":15">''[https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/saint-vincent-and-the-grenadines International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]'', US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.</ref>

Public schools include nondenominational religious curriculums based on Christianity, as well as optional Christian prayer in assemblies. Religious groups are allowed to set up their own schools.<ref name=":15" />

[[Cannabis]] is illegal, including for religious use. Rastafarians have criticized this law, as it impedes their ability to practice their religion.<ref name=":15" />

An anti-blasphemy law is part of the legal code but is not enforced.<ref name=":20">''[https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/trinidad-and-tobago International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Trinidad and Tobago]'', US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.</ref>

Religious groups may register with the government in order to be able to perform marriages, sponsor missionaries, or accept tax-exempt donations.<ref name=":20" />

Voluntary religious instruction is available as part of the public school curriculum. The government subsidizes religious private schools affiliated with Christian, Muslim, and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] groups.<ref name=":20" />

In 2017, Trinidad and Tobago set a uniform minimum marriage age of 18 years. Previously, different age limits were enforced for different religious groups. While many organizations (and particularly religiously affiliated women's organizations) welcomed this change, some religious organizations such as the orthodox Hindu organization [[Sanatan Dharma Maha Saba]] stated that they would oppose the law on the grounds that it infringes on religious freedom.<ref name=":20" />

The government of Trinidad and Tobago hosts the [[Inter-Religious Organization (Trinidad and Tobago)|Inter-Religious Organization]], an interfaith coordinating committee with representatives from 25 religious groups, including Christian, Muslim, Hindu, [[Orisha]] and [[Baháʼí Faith]] groups. Chaplains from the various religious denominations present in Trinidad Tobago are able to provide religious services to inmates in prisons.<ref name=":20" />

==United States==
{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States|Separation of church and state in the United States}}The principle of [[freedom of religion]] is officially protected by the [[US constitution]]. [[US Supreme Court]] rulings have re-stated and expanded upon the legal individual right of freedom of religion within the United States of America.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, many Europeans [[emigration|emigrated]] to what would later become the [[United States]]. For some this was driven at least partly by the desire to worship freely in their own fashion. These included a large number of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]]s such as the [[Puritan]]s and the [[Pilgrim]]s as well as English [[Catholic]]s.
