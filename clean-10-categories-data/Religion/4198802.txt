[[File:Censusdivisions-ethnic.png|thumb|300px|right|A map of the ethnic origins of Canadians, from the 2006 nation census.  The largest self-reported ancestry in each census division is highlighted by colour.  As a legacy of the block settlements, the three Prairie Provinces have several regions where ancestries other than British are the largest, unlike the norm in surrounding regions.  Areas where people self-identified as having German ancestors are the [[wikt:plurality|plurality]] are coloured in yellow on the map, French in dark blue, and Ukrainian in teal.

[[File:Land Ticket.jpg|thumb|CPR land sales advertisement]]
A '''block settlement''' (or '''bloc settlement''') is a particular type of land distribution which allows [[settlers]] with the same [[ethnicity]] to form small [[colonies]].

This settlement type was used throughout [[western Canada]] between the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Some were planned and others were spontaneously created by the settlers themselves.

The policy of planned blocks was pursued primarily by [[Clifford Sifton]] during his time as [[Minister of the Interior (Canada)|Interior Minister of Canada]].  It was essentially a compromise position.  Some politicians wanted all ethnic groups to be scattered evenly though the new lands to ensure they would quickly assimilate to Anglo-Canadian culture, while others did not want to live near "foreign" immigrants (as opposed to British immigrants who were not considered foreign) and demanded that they be segregated.  At the time Canada was receiving large amounts of non-British, non-French, immigrants for the first time, especially [[Italians]], [[Germans]], [[Scandinavia]]ns, and [[Ukrainians]].  The newcomers themselves wanted to settle as close as possible to people with a familiar language and similar customs.  The government did not want the west to be fragmented into a few large homogeneous ethnic blocks, however.  So several smaller colonies were set up where particular ethnic groups could settle, but these were spaced across the country.<ref>{{cite web
