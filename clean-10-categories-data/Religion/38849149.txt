There are many contradictions between the views of Non-Indians and Indians on [[Vegetarianism]]. According to [[D. N. Jha]]'s 2009 work ''The Myth of the Holy Cow'', for example, cattle including cows were neither inviolable nor revered in the ancient times as they were later but he had not given any proofs from the [[Vedas]], [[Upanishads]] or any other Hindu scriptures.

====Hinduism====
Maharishi [[Dayanand Saraswati]] had written a book named Gokarunanidhi in which he had shown the importance of cows not just from the spiritual point of view but from economical and environmental points of view. He strongly emphasized the importance of cow protection and had quoted various shlokas from Vedas which condemns the slaughtering of cows.

[[Yajurveda]]:

# Protect the cattles or animals. (Yajurveda 1.1)
# Kill not man nor any being with life. (Yaju 3.91)
# Kill not the subjects. (Yajurveda 12.32)
# Oh men! Protect or guard the cattle. (Yajurveda 6.11)
# Protect the bipeds and quadrupeds. (Yajurveda 14.8)
# Kill not the cows. (Yajurveda 13.43)
# O sagacious king! Don't harm this bull, the giver of thousands of comforts, the source of immense milk and worthy of protection. Harm not the God's creation, the cow, the giver of milk for mankind and of innocent nature. (Yajurveda 13.49)
# Beyond all measure is the cow (Griffith) i.e. there is no limit to the benefits she confer upon humanity.(Yajurveda 23.48)
# Kill not the animals, the bipeds (Griffith). (Yajurveda 13.47) Dayanand says in his commentry "Let no one kill animals that are useful to all but protect them and make use of them to make all happy. But the wild animals who injurious to the animals and to the cultivation of the villages and their inhabitants may be killed or driven away by the ruler."
# O ruler! You have received education, do not kill two footed beings like men, nor birds nor four footed beings like cows or other animals. In giving the object of the hymn Dayanand says 'O ruler! You should punish those wicked people who kill sheep, camels and other animals which are all useful to men." (Yajurveda 13.50)

According to Nanditha Krishna, the cow veneration in ancient India "probably originated from the pastoral Aryans" in the Vedic era, whose religious texts called for non-violence towards all bipeds and quadrupeds, and often equated killing of a cow with the killing of a human being especially a [[Brahmin]].<ref>{{citation |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |title=Sacred Animals of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF_af8_547EC |date=2014 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-81-8475-182-6 |pages=80, 101–108}}</ref> The hymn 10.87.16 of the Hindu scripture ''[[Rigveda]]'' (≈1200–1500 BCE), states Nanditha Krishna, condemns all killings of men, cattle and horses, and prays to god [[Agni]] to punish those who kill.<ref>{{citation |last=Krishna |first=Nanditha |title=Sacred Animals of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF_af8_547EC&pg=PT108 |date=2014 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-81-8475-182-6 |pages=15, 33}}</ref><ref>[https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.८७ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १०.८७], Wikisource, Quote: "यः पौरुषेयेण क्रविषा समङ्क्ते यो अश्व्येन पशुना यातुधानः। यो अघ्न्याया भरति क्षीरमग्ने तेषां शीर्षाणि हरसापि वृश्च॥१६॥"</ref>

[[File:3 Hindu deity Krishna on ceramic tile at Munnar Kerala India 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The iconography of popular Hindu deity [[Krishna]] often includes cows. He is revered in [[Vaishnavism]].]]
According to Harris, the literature relating to cow veneration became common in 1st millennium CE, and by about 1000 CE vegetarianism, along with a taboo against beef, became a well accepted mainstream Hindu tradition.<ref name=harris201/> This practice was inspired by the belief in Hinduism that a soul is present in all living beings, life in all its forms is interconnected, and non-violence towards all creatures is the highest ethical value.<ref name="Kemmerer2011p59"/><ref name=harris201/> Vegetarianism is a part of the Hindu culture. God [[Krishna]], one of the incarnations ([[Avatar]]) of Vishnu, is associated with cows, adding to its endearment.<ref name="Kemmerer2011p59"/><ref name=harris201/>

Many ancient and medieval Hindu texts debate the rationale for a voluntary stop to cow slaughter and the pursuit of vegetarianism as a part of a general abstention from violence against others and all killing of animals.<ref name="Alsdorf2010p32">{{cite book|author=Ludwig Alsdorf|title=The History of Vegetarianism and Cow-Veneration in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHKMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA32|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-16641-0|pages=32–44 with footnotes}}</ref><ref name=mclane271>{{cite book|author=John R.

The Mahabharata debate presents one meat-producing hunter who defends his profession as [[dharma|dharmic]].<ref name="Alsdorf2010p32"/> The hunter, in this ancient Sanskrit text, states that meat consumption should be okay because animal sacrifice was practiced in the Vedic age, that the flesh nourishes people, that man must eat to live and plants like animals are alive too, that the nature of life is such every life form eats the other, that no profession is totally non-violent because even agriculture destroys numerous living beings when the plough digs the land.<ref name="Alsdorf2010p32"/> The hunter's arguments are, states Alsdorf, followed by stanzas that present support for restricted meat-eating on specific occasions.<ref name="Alsdorf2010p32"/>

The pro-vegetarianism sections of these Hindu texts counter these views. One section acknowledges that the Vedas do mention sacrifice, but not killing the animal. The proponents of vegetarianism state that Vedic teachings explicitly teach against killing, its verses can be interpreted in many ways, that the correct interpretation is of the sacrifice as the interiorized spiritual sacrifice, one where it is an "offering of truth (''[[satya]]'') and self-restraint (''[[Temperance (virtue)#Hinduism|damah]]'')", with the proper sacrifice being one "with reverence as the sacrificial meal and Veda study as the herbal juices".<ref>{{cite book|author=Ludwig Alsdorf|title=The History of Vegetarianism and Cow-Veneration in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHKMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA32|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-16641-0|pages=39–42 with footnotes}}</ref><ref>[[Paul Deussen]] (1921), [https://archive.org/stream/vierphilosophisc00deusuoft#page/470/mode/2up Mahabharata XII], pages 471-473, 423-437, 764-765, 791-792 (in German)</ref> The sections that appeal for vegetarianism, including abstention from cow slaughter, state that life forms exist in different levels of development, some life forms have more developed sensory organs, that non-violence towards fellow man and animals who experience pain and suffering is an appropriate ethical value.

According to Ludwig Alsdorf, "Indian vegetarianism is unequivocally based on ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence)" as evidenced by ancient ''[[smriti]]s'' and other ancient texts of Hinduism. He adds that the endearment and respect for cattle in Hinduism is more than a commitment to vegetarianism, it has become integral to its theology.<ref name=alsdorf2/> According to Juli Gittinger, it is often argued that cow sacredness and protection is a fundamental quality of Hinduism, but she considers this to be a false claim.<ref name=gittinger17/> This, states Gittinger, could be understood more as an example of "sanskritization" or presentation of certain traditions followed by its upper castes as purer, informed form of Hinduism and possibly an influence of Jainism on Hinduism.<ref name=gittinger17>{{cite journal|last1=Gittinger|first1=Juli L.|title=The Rhetoric of Violence, Religion, and Purity in India's Cow Protection Movement|journal=Journal of Religion and Violence|date=2017|volume=5|issue=2|pages=131–149|doi=10.5840/jrv201751540}}</ref> The respect for cattle is widespread but not universal.

====Jainism====
[[Jainism]] is against violence to all living beings, including cattle. According to the Jaina sutras, humans must avoid all killing and slaughter because all living beings are fond of life, they suffer, they feel pain, they like to live, and long to live. All beings should help each other live and prosper, according to Jainism, not kill and slaughter each other.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Susan J. Armstrong|author2=Richard G.

Christianity is one of India's largest religions after Hinduism and Islam, with approximately 28 million followers, constituting 2.3 percent of India's population (2011 census).[2] According to Indian tradition, the Christian faith was introduced to India by Thomas the Apostle, who supposedly reached the Malabar Coast (Kerala) in 52 AD. Later Christianity also arrived on the Indian sea coast with Christian travelers and merchants. 
Christians are a significant minority and a major religious group in three states of India - Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland with a plural majority in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh and other states with significant Christian population include Coastal Andhra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Kanara, the south shore and North-east India. Christianity in India to a larger extent has been very traditional in its practices and has not witnessed any indigenous revival and local Church-planting movements in history like their counterparts in the other parts of the world. Moreover, a significant number of Indians profess personal Christian faith outside the domain of traditional and institutionalized Christianity and do not associate with any Church or its conventional code of belief. In Christianity, beef is allowed to be eaten and has been eaten across Christian followers in different parts of India for centuries.

===Mughal Empire===
Cattle slaughter, in accordance with the Islamic custom, was practiced in the Mughal Empire under its [[Sunni]] rulers with a few exceptions. The religiously liberal emperor [[Akbar]], out of respect for the demographic majority of Hindus, criminalized cow slaughtering. In one case, Akbar banished his high official for the offense of cow slaughter.<ref name="Rahman2017p83"/> Later, Aurangzeb lifted this prohibition with his ''[[Fatawa-i-Alamgiri]]''.

===Maratha Empire===
According to Ian Copland and other scholars, the [[Maratha Empire]], which led a Hindu rebellion against the Muslim Mughal Empire and created a Hindu state in the 17th and 18th centuries, respected mosques, mausoleums and Sufi ''pirs''.<ref name="Copland2013p154"/>{{vn|date=December 2020}} However, the Maratha polity sharply enforced the Hindu sentiments for cow protection. This may be linked to the [[Bhakti movement]] that developed before the rise of the Maratha Empire, states Copland, where legends and a theology based on the compassion and love stories of Hindu god [[Krishna]], himself a cowherd, became integral to regional religiosity.<ref name="Copland2013p154">{{cite book|author1=Ian Copland|author2=Ian Mabbett|author3=Asim Roy |display-authors=etal |title=A History of State and Religion in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWcZulI5tL0C |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-45950-4|pages=154–161}}</ref>

With the advent of [[British Raj|British rule in India]], eating beef along with drinking whiskey, in English-language colleges in [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]], became a method of fitting in into the British culture.

The reverence for the cow played a role in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] against the [[British East India Company]].

Cow protection sentiment reached its peak in 1893.  Large public meetings were held in [[Nagpur]], [[Haridwar]] and [[Benares]] to denounce beef-eaters. [[Melodramas]] were conducted to display the plight of cows, and pamphlets were distributed, to create awareness among those who sacrificed and ate them. Riots broke out between Hindus and Muslims in [[Mau]] in the [[Azamgarh]] district; it took 3 days for the government to regain control. The rioting was precipitated by contradictory interpretations of a British local magistrate's order.  He had apparently asked all the Muslims interested in cow slaughter to register, which undertaking was in fact performed to identify problem-prone areas. However, Muslims had interpreted this as a promise of protection for those who wanted to perform sacrifices.<ref>''Religious Nationalism, Hindus and Muslims in India'', Peter van der Veer, pp. 92-93, {{ISBN|0-520-08256-7}}.</ref>

[[Queen Victoria]] mentioned the cow protection movement in a letter, dated 8 December 1893, to then [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]] [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lansdowne]], writing, "The Queen greatly admired the Viceroy's speech on the Cow-killing agitation. While she quite agrees in the necessity of perfect fairness, she thinks the [[Mohammedan|Muhammadans]] do require more protection than Hindus, and they are decidedly by far the more loyal.

Cow slaughter was opposed by some prominent leaders of the [[Indian independence movement|independence movement]] such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], [[Madan Mohan Malviya]], [[Rajendra Prasad]] and [[Purushottam Das Tandon]].

On 25 July 1947, in a prayer meeting, Gandhi opposed laws that were derived from religion. He said, "In India no law can be made to ban cow-slaughter.

In 1940, one of the Special Committees of the Indian National Congress stated that slaughter of cow and its progeny must be totally prohibited. However, another Committee of the Congress opposed cow slaughter prohibition stating that the skin and leather of cow and its progeny, which is fresh by slaughter should be sold and exported to earn foreign exchange.<ref name = "ChapISec11" />

In 1944, the British placed restrictions on cattle slaughter in India, on the grounds that the shortage of cattle was causing anxiety to the Government. The shortage itself was attributed to the increased demand for cattle for cultivation, transport, milk and other purposes. It was decided that, in respect of slaughter by the army authorities, working cattle, as well as, cattle fit for bearing offspring, should not be slaughtered. Accordingly, the slaughter of all cattle below 3 years of age, male cattle between 3 and 10 years, female cattle between 3 and 10 years of age, which are capable of producing milk, as well as all cows which are pregnant or in milk, was prohibited.<ref name = "ChapISec11" />

There was a large increase in the number of cattle slaughtered in the years preceding Independence, according to statistics given by Pandit Thakur Dass, during the debate in the Constituent Assembly on 24 November 1948. The number of oxen killed in 1944 was 6,091,828, while in 1945, sixty five lakhs were slaughtered, an increase of more than 4 lakhs.

===Post-Independence===
The Central Government, in a letter dated 20 December 1950, directed the State Governments not to introduce total prohibition on slaughter, stating, "Hides from slaughtered cattle are much superior to hides from the fallen cattle and fetch a higher price. In the absence of slaughter the best type of hide, which fetches good price in the export market will no longer be available. A total ban on slaughter is thus detrimental to the export trade and work against the interest of the Tanning industry in the country."<ref name="item 13" />

In 1955, a senior Congress member of parliament [[Seth Govind Das]] drafted a bill for India's parliament for a nationwide ban on cow slaughter, stating that a "large majority of the party" was in favour.

In 1958, a lawsuit was instigated in the Supreme Court of India regarding the constitutionality of the slaughter ban laws in the state, where Qureshi petitioned that the laws infringed on Muslim rights to freely practice their religion such as sacrificing cows on Bakr-Id day.<ref name=smith487/> The Court determined that neither the Quran nor the ''Hidaya'' mandates cow slaughter, and the Islamic texts allow a goat or camel be sacrificed instead.

In 1966, Indian independence activist [[Jayaprakash Narayan]] wrote a letter to then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] calling for a ban on cow slaughter. Narayan wrote, "For myself, I cannot understand why, in a Hindu majority country like India, where rightly or wrongly, there is such a strong feeling about cow-slaughter, there cannot be a legal ban".<ref name="item 13" /> In the same year, the [[1966 anti-cow slaughter agitation|Hindu organisations started an agitation]] demanding a ban on the slaughter of cows.

According to the Bangladeshi newspaper ''The Daily Star'', some of cattle theft operations move the cattle stolen in India across the border into [[Bangladesh]], ahead of festivals such as [[Eid-ul-Azha]] when the demand for meat increases. The criminals dye the white or red cows into black, to make identifying the stolen cow difficult. The Border Guard Bangladesh in 2016 reported of confiscating stolen cattle, where some of cattle's original skin color had been "tampered with".<ref>[http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/novel-trick-lift-cattle-1277011 A novel trick to lift cattle], The Daily Star (29 August 2016)</ref> Hundreds of thousands of cows, states the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'', are illegally smuggled from India into Bangladesh every year to be slaughtered.<ref name=buncombe2012/> Gangs from both sides of the border are involved in this illegal smuggling involving an estimated 1.5 million (15 lakhs) cattle a year, and cattle theft is a source of the supply, states Andrew Buncombe.<ref name=buncombe2012>{{cite web | last=Buncombe | first=Andrew | title=Nothing's sacred: the illegal trade in India's holy cows | website=The Independent | date=1 June 2012 | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/nothings-sacred-the-illegal-trade-in-indias-holy-cows-7808483.html | accessdate=27 June 2017}}</ref> According to Zahoor Rather, trade in stolen cattle is one of the important crime-related border issues between India and Bangladesh.<ref>Zahoor A.

=== Dalits, castes and religions ===
Some scholars state that the Hindu views on cattle slaughter and beef eating is caste-based, while other scholars disagree. Dalit Hindus eat beef state the former, while the latter state that the position of Dalit Hindus on cattle slaughter is ambiguous.<ref name=lodwick61/><ref>{{citation |author=People's Union for Democratic Rights |chapter=Dalit Lynching at Dulina: Cow-Protection, Caste and Communalism |editor=Ujjwal Kumar Singh |title=Human Rights and Peace: Ideas, Laws, Institutions and Movements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yx00xCWCulEC |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-81-7829-884-9 |pages=155–57}}</ref>

Deryck Lodrick states, for example, "beef-eating is common among low caste Hindus", and vegetarianism is an upper caste phenomenon.<ref name=lodwick61>{{cite journal|title=Symbol and Sustenance: Cattle in South Asian Culture|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|author=Deryck O.

These have typically been considered the low-castes in Hinduism.<ref name="Bayly2001p83">{{cite book|author=Susan Bayly|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC |year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|pages=83–84, 192–194, 209–212}}</ref> According to Bayly, reverence for the cow is widely shared in India across castes. The traditional belief has also associated death or the dead with being unclean, polluting or defiling, such as those who handle corpse, carrion and animal remains.<ref name="Bayly2001p83"/> However, the tradition differentiates between natural or accidental death, and intentional slaughter. According to Frederick J. Simoons, many members of low castes and tribal groups in India reject "cow slaughter and beef eating, some of them quite strongly", while others support beef eating and cattle slaughter.<ref name=simoons110>{{cite book|author=Frederick J.

According to Simoons and Lodrick, the reverence for cattle among Hindus, and Indians in general, is more comprehensively understood by considering both the religious dimensions and the daily lives in rural India.<ref>Frederick I. Simoons and Deryck O. Lodrick (1981), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25841764 Background to Understanding the Cattle Situation of India: The Sacred Cow Concept in Hindu Religion and Folk Culture], Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, Bd. 106, H. 1/2, pp. 121-137</ref> The veneration of cow across various Hindu castes, states Lodrick, emerged with the "fifteenth century revival of Vaishnavism", when god [[Krishna]] along with his cows became a popular object of [[bhakti]] (devotional worship).<ref>{{cite book|author=Deryck O.

According to [[People's Union for Democratic Rights]] (PUDR), some Dalits work in leather which includes cow-skin and they rely on it for their livelihood. The position of Dalits to cow-protection is highly ambivalent, states PUDR, given their Hindu identity and the "endemic contradiction - between the 'Hindu' ethos of protecting the cow and a trade dependent fundamentally on the skin of cows".<ref>{{citation |author=People's Union for Democratic Rights |chapter=Dalit Lynching at Dulina: Cow-Protection, Caste and Communalism |editor=Ujjwal Kumar Singh |title=Human Rights and Peace: Ideas, Laws, Institutions and Movements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yx00xCWCulEC |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-81-7829-884-9 |page=155}}</ref> The selling of old cattle for skin, according to them, is supported by members of both "dominant and subordinate castes" for the leather-related economy.<ref>{{citation |author=People's Union for Democratic Rights |chapter=Dalit Lynching at Dulina: Cow-Protection, Caste and Communalism |editor=Ujjwal Kumar Singh |title=Human Rights and Peace: Ideas, Laws, Institutions and Movements |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Yx00xCWCulEC |year= 2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-81-7829-884-9 |page=155}}, Quote: "The practice of selling off ageing and sick and dry cows is something the dominant and subordinate castes have historically practiced".</ref> Dominant groups, officials and even some Dalits state that "Dalits are cow-protectors". The inclusion of Dalits in cow-protection ideology, according to PUDR, is accompanied by "avowal of loyalty to cow-protection" exposing the fragility of the cow-protection ideology across castes.<ref>{{citation |author=People's Union for Democratic Rights |chapter=Dalit Lynching at Dulina: Cow-Protection, Caste and Communalism |editor=Ujjwal Kumar Singh |title=Human Rights and Peace: Ideas, Laws, Institutions and Movements |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yx00xCWCulEC |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-81-7829-884-9 |pages=157}}</ref>

Some Dalit student associations in the [[Hyderabad]] region state that beef preparations, such as ''beef biryani'', is the traditional food of low-castes. Historical evidence does not support this claim, state Claude Levy-Straus and Brigitte Sebastia. Beef as the traditional food of impoverished Dalits is a reconstruction of history and Indian beef dishes are a Mughal era innovation and more recently invented tradition. It is the nineteenth century politics that has associated beef and cattle slaughter with Muslim and Dalit identity, states Sebastia.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brigitte Sebastia|title=Eating Traditional Food: Politics, Identity and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1TMlDwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-28594-6|pages=10–11, 116–122}}</ref>

=== Economic imperative ===
According to [[Marvin Harris]], the importance of cattle to Hindus and other religious groups is beyond religion, because the cattle has been and remains an important pillar of rural economy.<ref name=harris28/> In the traditional economy, states Harris, a team of oxen is "Indian peasant's tractor, thresher and family car combined", and the cow is the factory that produces those oxen.<ref name=harris28/>{{refn|group=note|In rice-growing regions, buffalo is important because buffalo pull better in water-filled muddy soils.<ref name=harris28/>}} The cattle produce nutritious milk, their dung when dried serves as a major cooking fuel, and for the poor the cattle is an essential partner in many stages of agriculture. When cattle fall sick, the family worries over them like Westerners do over their pets or family members. A natural loss of a cattle from untimely death can cripple a poor family, and thus slaughtering a creature so useful and essential is unthinkable. According to Harris, India's unpredictable monsoons and famines over its history meant even greater importance of cattle, because Indian breeds of cattle can survive with little food and water for extended periods of time.<ref name=harris28/>

According to Britha Mikkelsen and other scholars, cow dung produced by young and old cattle is the traditional cooking fuel as dung-cakes and fertilizer in India. The recycling substitutes over 25 million tons of fossil fuels or 60 million tons of wood every year, providing the majority of cooking fuel needs in rural India.<ref>{{cite book|author=Britha Mikkelsen|title=Methods for Development Work and Research: A New Guide for Practitioners|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SIVdugYuwOIC |year= 2005|publisher= SAGE Publications|isbn= 978-0-7619-3328-1|page= 328}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1= Bonnie Kime Scott|author2= Susan E.

The Indian religions adapted to the rural economic constraints, states Harris. Preserving cattle by opposing slaughter has been and remains an economic necessity and an insurance for the impoverished.<ref name=harris28>[[Marvin Harris]] (1978), India's sacred cow, ''Human Nature'', 1(2), 28–36</ref> The cow is sacred in India, states Harris, not because of superstitious, capricious and ignorant beliefs, but because of real economic imperatives and cattle's role in the Indian tradition of integrated living. Cattle became essential in India, just like dogs or cars became essential in other human cultures, states Harris.<ref name=harris28/>

=== Animal cruelty ===
The slaughterhouses in India have been accused of cruelty against animals by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] and other humane treatment of animals-groups.<ref name=cruelty2/> According to PETA and these groups, the slaughterhouse workers slit animals' throats with dull blades and let them bleed to death. Cattle are skinned and dismembered while they are still alive and in full view of other animals.<ref name=cruelty2/>

The Supreme Court of India, in February 2017, ordered a state governments to stop the illegal slaughterhouses and set up enforcement committees to monitor the treatment of animals used for meat and leather.<ref name=cruelty2/> The Court has also ruled that the Indian Constitution requires Indian citizens to show compassion to the animal kingdom, respect the fundamental rights of animals, and asked the states to prevent cruelty to animals.<ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com">[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/sc-stays-hc-judgment-on-cow-slaughter/articleshow/56742659.cms Supreme Court stays high court judgment on cow slaughter], The Times of India (24 January 2017)</ref>

[[File:India cow slaughter map.svg|thumb|Cow slaughter laws in various states in India]]
The "Preservation, protection and improvement of stock and prevention of animal diseases, veterinary training and practice" is Entry 15 of the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, meaning that State Legislatures have exclusive powers to legislate the prevention of slaughter and preservation of cattle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vakilbabu.com/Laws/SubList/SList.htm |title=The States Subjects List |publisher=Vakilbabu.com |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/shed07.htm |title=Seventh Schedule |publisher=Constitution.org |accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref>

In February 2017, the Court ordered a state governments to stop the illegal slaughterhouses and set up enforcement committees to monitor the treatment of animals used for meat and leather.<ref name=cruelty2>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/navi-mumbai/animals-on-way-to-slaughterhouse-treated-inhumaly/articleshow/59078137.cms Animals on way to slaughterhouse treated inhumanly], Vijay V Singh, The Times of India (10 June 2017);<br>[http://www.petaindia.com/media/peta-calls-states-stop-illegal-slaughter-animals-per-supreme-court-order/ PETA Calls on all States to Stop Illegal Slaughter of Animals as Per Supreme Court Order], Nikunj Sharma and Shambhavi Tiwari, PETA India (31 March 2017)</ref> The Court has also ruled, according to a Times of India report, that "it was evident from the combined reading of Articles 48 and 51- A(g) of the [Indian] Constitution that citizens must show compassion to the animal kingdom.

Article 48 specifically lays down that the state shall endeavour to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves, other milch and draught cattle".<ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com"/>

===Non-uniformity===
No state law explicitly bans the consumption of beef. There is a lack of uniformity among State laws governing cattle slaughter. The strictest laws are in [[Delhi]], [[Gujarat]], [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Uttarakhand]], where the slaughter of cow and its progeny, including bulls and bullocks of all ages, is completely banned  Most States prohibit the slaughter of cows of all ages. However, [[Assam]] and [[West Bengal]] permit the slaughter of cows of over the ages of 10 and 14 years, respectively. Most States prohibit the slaughter of calves, whether male or female. With the exception of Bihar and Rajasthan, where age of a calf is given as below 3 years, the other States have not defined the age of a calf. According to the [[National Commission on Cattle]], the definition of a calf being followed in Maharashtra, by some executive instructions, was "below the age of 1 year".<ref name="Chapter 2">{{cite web|url=http://dahd.nic.in/ch2/chap2.htm|title=Chapter II Executive Summary |accessdate=26 November 2014}} {{PD-notice}}</ref><ref name="Chapter 4">{{cite web|url=http://dahd.nic.in/ch4/chap4.htm|title=Chapter IV Legislation, Part I|accessdate=26 November 2014}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

In [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu]], Delhi, [[Goa]], Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, [[Puducherry]], Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand violation of State laws on cattle slaughter are both [[cognizable offence|cognizable]] and non-bailable offences. Most of other states specify that offences would be cognizable only. The maximum term of imprisonment varies from 6 months to 14 years(life-term) and the fine from {{INR}}1,000 to {{INR}}5,00,000. Delhi and Madhya Pradesh have fixed a [[mandatory minimum]] term of imprisonment at 6 months.

Cows are routinely shipped to states with lower or no requirement for slaughter, even though it is illegal in most states to ship animals across state borders to be slaughtered.<ref name="MP goes tough on cow slaughter">{{cite news|title=MP goes tough on cow slaughter|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-04/india/30588595_1_animal-preservation-act-jail-term-cow-slaughter-prohibition|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=4 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="TIME Asia">{{Cite news| first=Maseeh | last=Rahman | title=Is Nothing Sacred? | date=29 May 2000 | url =http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/2000/0529/india.cows.html | work =Time Asia | accessdate = 25 February 2008 }}</ref> Many illegal [[slaughterhouse]]s operate in large cities such as [[Chennai]] and [[Mumbai]].

===Legislative history===

====Constituent Assembly====
After India attained Independence, the members of the [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]], a body consisting of indirectly elected representatives set up for the purpose of drafting a constitution for India, debated the question of making a provision for the protection and preservation of the cow in the Constitution of India. An amendment for including a provision in the Directive Principles of State Policy as Article 38A was introduced by Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava. The amendment read, "The State shall endeavour to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall in particular take steps for preserving and improving the breeds of cattle and prohibit the slaughter of cow and other useful cattle, specially milch and draught cattle and their young stock".<ref name="section 11" />

Another amendment motion was moved by [[Seth Govind Das]], who sought to extend the scope of the provisions for prohibiting slaughter to cover cow and its progeny by adding the following words at the end of Bhargava's amendment, "'The word "cow' includes bulls, bullocks, young stock of genus cow". Bhargava's amendment was passed by the Constituent Assembly, but Das' was rejected.<ref name="section 11" />

Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava ([[East Punjab]]), Seth Govind Das ([[Central Provinces and Berar]]), Shibban Lal Saksena ([[United Provinces (1937–50)|United Provinces]]), Ram Sahai (United State of [[Gwalior State|Gwalior]]-[[Indore State|Indore]]-[[Malwa Agency|Malwa:]] [[Madhya Bharat]]), [[Raghu Vira]] (Central Provinces and Berar) and [[Raghunath Vinayak Dhulekar]] (United Provinces) strongly pleaded for the inclusion of a provision in the Constitution for prohibiting the slaughter of cows. Although some members were keen on including the provision in the chapter on [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental Rights]] but, later as a compromise and on the basis of an assurance given by [[B. R. Ambedkar]], the amendment was moved for inclusion as a Directive Principle of State Policy.<ref name="section 11" />

Bhargava stated that "While moving this amendment, I have no hesitation in stating that for people like me and those that do not agree with the point of view of Ambedkar and others, this entails, in a way, a sort of sacrifice. Seth Govind Das had sent one such amendment to be included in the Fundamental Rights and other members also had sent similar amendments. To my mind, it would have been much better if this could have been incorporated in the Fundamental Rights, but some of my Assembly friends differed and it is the desire of Ambedkar that this matter, instead of being included in Fundamental Rights should be incorporated in the Directive Principles. As a matter of fact, it is the agreed opinion of the Assembly that this problem should be solved in such a manner that the objective is gained without using any sort of coercion. I have purposely adopted this course, as to my mind, the amendment fulfills our object and is midway between the Directive Principles and the Fundamental Rights." Bhargava also observed that "I do not want that, due to its inclusion in the Fundamental Rights, non-[[Hindu]]s should complain that they have been forced to accept a certain thing against their will." The end result of the debate in the Constituent Assembly was that the Bhargava's amendment was carried and the Article in its present form exists as Article 48 of the Constitution, as one of the Directive Principles of State Policy.<ref name="section 11">{{cite web |url=http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary.aspx#it11 |title=Report of the National Commission on Cattle - Chapter II (11.

====Parliament====
A number of Private Member's Bills and Resolutions regarding the prevention of cow slaughter have been introduced in both Houses of Parliament, from time to time. However, none have been successful in obtaining a complete nationwide ban on cow slaughter. Attempts to address the issue through a central legislation or otherwise are described below.<ref name="Section 13">{{cite web|url=http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary.aspx#it13|title=Chapter II, Executive Summary, Section 13|publisher=Government of India|access-date=18 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109002416/http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary.aspx#it13|archive-date=9 November 2013|url-status=dead}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

[[Vinoba Bhave]] went on an indefinite fast from 22 April 1979 demanding that the Governments of West Bengal and Kerala agree to enact legislation banning cow slaughter. On 12 April 1979, a Private Members Resolution was passed in the Lok Sabha, by 42 votes to 8, with 12 absentees. It read, "This House directs the Government to ensure total ban on the slaughter of cows of all ages and calves in consonance with the Directive Principles laid down in Article 48 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court, as well as necessitated by strong economic considerations based on the recommendations of the Cattle Preservation and Development Committee and the reported fast by Acharya Vinoba Bhave from 21st April, 1979".<ref name="Section 12" />

Then Prime Minister [[Morarji Desai]] later announced in Parliament that the government would initiate action for amending the Constitution with a view to conferring legislative competence on the Union Parliament for legislating on the subject of cow protection. Accordingly, a Constitution Amendment Bill seeking to bring the subject of prevention of cow slaughter on to the [[Concurrent List]] was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 18 May 1979. The Bill, however, lapsed on account of dissolution of the Sixth Lok Sabha. Bhave reiterated his demand for a total ban on cow slaughter in July 1980, while addressing the All India Goseva Sammelan. He also requested that cows should not be taken from one State to another.<ref name="Section 12" />

In 1981, the question of amending the Constitution by introducing a Bill was again examined by the Government, but, in view of the sensitive nature of the issue and owing to political compulsions a "wait and watch" policy was adopted. A number of complaints were received from time to time that despite the ban on the slaughter of cow and its progeny, healthy bullocks were being slaughtered under one pretext or the other and calves were being maimed, so that they could be declared useless and ultimately slaughtered.<ref name="Section 12"/>

Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], in her letter dated 24 February 1982 wrote to the Chief Ministers of 14 States viz. Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir, in which she desired that the ban be enforced in letter and spirit, that the ban on cow slaughter is not allowed to be circumvented by devious methods, and that Committees to inspect cattle before they are admitted to slaughter houses be adopted.<ref name="Section 12"/>

Recognizing that the problem basically arose on account of inaction or obstruction on the part of a few States and large scale smuggling of cows and calves from a prohibition State to a non-prohibition State like Kerala was taking place, a suggestion was made that this problem be brought to the notice of the [[Sarkaria Commission]], which was making recommendations regarding Centre-State relations, but this idea was dropped as the Commission was then in the final stages of report-writing.<ref name="Section 12">{{cite web |url=http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary.aspx#it12 |title=Report of the National Commission on Cattle - Chapter II (12.

==Legislation by State or Union Territory==
The legal status of cattle slaughter in [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] and [[Lakshadweep]] is unknown.

===Andhra Pradesh===
''The Andhra Pradesh Prohibition of Cow Slaughter and Animal Preservation Act, 1977'' governs the slaughter of cattle (cows and buffaloes) in [[Andhra Pradesh]].

In the case of cows, the law makes a distinction between males and females. The slaughter of female cows and of heifers is totally forbidden. The slaughter of bulls and bullocks is permitted upon obtaining a "fit-for-slaughter" certificate, to be issued only if the animal is "not economical or is not likely to become economical for the purpose of breeding or draught/agricultural operations." The certificate can be issued by any veterinary doctor and is a source of much corruption and misuse. The law also prohibits the slaughter of calves, whether male or female. The age limit of "calf" is not defined.

In the case of buffaloes, the law firstly forbits in absolute terms the slaughter of calves, whether male or female. Again, the age limit of "calf" is not defined and therefore there is much misuse, resulting in the slaughter of many young male animals who are only a few months old. Secondly, the law forbids the slaughter of adult buffaloes unless a "fit-for-slaughter" certificate is issued by a veterinarian. The ceretificate can be issued if the animal is deemed "uneconomical for purposes of milking, breeding or draught/agricultural operations." Thus, the law permits the slaughter of all adult male buffaloes and of all old and "spent" female buffaloes whose milk yield is not economical. For this reason, the slaughter of buffaloes, both male and female, is rampant in Andhra Pradesh.

Anyone violating the law can be punished with imprisonment up to maximum of 6 months or fine of up to {{INR}} 1,000 or both. The crime is treated as a [[cognizable offence]].<ref name="ANNEX II (8)">{{cite web|url=http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary/annex-ii-8.aspx |title=Report of the National Commission on Cattle - ANNEX II (8) Gist of State Legislations on Cow Slaughter |publisher=[[Ministry of Agriculture (India)|DAHD]] |accessdate=8 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185034/http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-ii-executive-summary/annex-ii-8.aspx |archive-date=29 October 2013 }} {{PD-notice}}</ref>
