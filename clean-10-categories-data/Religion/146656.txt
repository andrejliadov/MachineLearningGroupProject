'''Ecumenism''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ˈ|k|juː|m|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}}), also spelled as '''oecumenism''' or '''œcumenism''', is the concept and principle in which [[Christians]] belonging to different [[Christian denomination]]s work together to develop closer relationships among their churches and promote Christian unity.<ref>{{cite web |title=What are Ecumenical Relations? |url=https://eia.archchicago.org/ecumenical-relations/what-are-ecumenical-relations |website=Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs |publisher=[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago]] |access-date=24 September 2020 |language=en |quote=Ecumenical relations, also known as ecumenism, are the effort to seek Christian unity by cultivating meaningful relationships and understanding by and between the many different Christian Churches and Christian Communities.}}</ref> The adjective ''ecumenical'' is thus applied to any '''interdenominational''' initiative that encourages greater cooperation between Christians and their [[Christian Church|churches]].

The fact that all Christians belonging to [[mainstream Christian]] denominations profess faith in [[Jesus]] and receive [[baptism]] according to the [[Trinitarian formula]] is seen as being a basis for ecumenism and its goal of Christian unity.<ref name="Pizzey2019">{{cite book |last1=Pizzey |first1=Antonia |title=Receptive Ecumenism and the Renewal of the Ecumenical Movement: The Path of Ecclesial Conversion |date=15 March 2019 |publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]] |isbn=978-90-04-39780-4 |page=131 |language=en |quote=Baptism into Christ unites all Christians, despite ther divisions. It is relationship with Christ through baptism, which enables relationship with other Christians. According to Congar, "on the basis of the baptism which incorporates us into Christ and the Word which is our Christian norm, [ecumenism's] aim is to carry out the will and the prayer of Christ, which is that his disciples should be united." The Christological foundation of Spiritual Ecumenism affirms that ecumenism is not our idea or goal, but rather Christ's will and prayer for us. Moreover, Christian unity already exists to some exent among all baptised Christians because of their relationship with Christ. Only through Christ is ecumenism possible. Kasper explains that Spiritual Ecumenism's fundamental Christological basis means that any ecumenical spirituality "will also be a sacramental spirituality." Baptism is "therefore a basic element of ecumenical spirituality."}}</ref><ref name="WCC1997">{{cite web |title=Becoming a Christian: The Ecumenical Implications of Our Common Baptism |url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/documents/commissions/faith-and-order/ii-worship-and-baptism/becoming-a-christian-the-ecumenical-implications-of-our-common-baptism |publisher=[[World Council of Churches]] |access-date=13 September 2020 |language=en |date=24 January 1997}}</ref> In 1920, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Germanus V of Constantinople]], wrote a letter "addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded [[League of Nations]]".<ref name="Ware1993"/> In 1937, Christian leaders from mainstream Christian Churches thus resolved to establish the [[World Council of Churches]] to work for the cause of Christian unity; it today includes most major traditions of Christianity as full members, including the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], the [[Old Catholic Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the [[Lutheran World Federation|Lutheran Churches]], the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Baptist World Alliance|Baptist Churches]], the [[Mennonites|Mennonite Church]]es, the [[World Methodist Council|Methodist Churches]], the [[Moravian Church]], the [[Pentecostal Church]]es and the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches|Reformed Churches]], as well as almost all jurisdictions of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]];<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/list |title=Member list — World Council of Churches |work=oikoumene.org |year=2014 |access-date=12 November 2014}}</ref> the [[Roman Catholic Church]] participates as an observer, sending delegates to official gatherings.<ref name="Harmon2010">{{cite book |last1=Harmon |first1=Steven R. |title=Ecumenism Means You, Too: Ordinary Christians and the Quest for Christian Unity |date=15 March 2010 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=978-1-62189-277-9 |page=97 |language=en|quote=Since its creation, it has also established a cordial cooperation with the World Council of Churches and regularly names Catholic observers at various ecumenical gatherings and invites observers of "fraternal delegates" of other churches or ecclesial communities to major events of the Catholic Church.

The terms ''ecumenism'' and ''ecumenical'' come from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|οἰκουμένη}} (''[[oikoumene]]''), which means "the whole inhabited world", and was historically used with specific reference to the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{Dictionary.com|ecumenical}}</ref> The ecumenical vision comprises both the search for the visible unity of the Church (Ephesians 4:3) and the "whole inhabited earth" (Matthew 24:14) as the concern of all Christians. In Christianity, the qualification ''ecumenical'' was originally and still is used in terms such as "[[Ecumenical council]]" and "[[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]]", in the meaning of pertaining to the totality of the larger Church (such as the [[Catholic Church]] or the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]) rather than being restricted to one of its constituent local churches or [[diocese]]s. Used in this sense, the term carries no connotation of re-uniting the historically separated Christian denominations but presumes a unity of local congregations in a worldwide [[Koinonia|communion]].

==Purpose and goal of ecumenism==
Historically, the term "ecumenism" was originally used in the context of the larger ecumenical councils organised with the support of the [[Roman Emperor]]. The aim of these councils was to clarify matters of [[Christian theology]] and doctrine, leading to the meaning of unity behind the term "ecumenical". The Ecumenical councils brought together bishops from across the Roman Empire, with a total of seven ecumenical councils accepted to have been held by both the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and Roman Catholic Churches before the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] dividing the two churches.

There are a variety of different expectations of what that Christian unity looks like, how it is brought about, what ecumenical methods ought to be engaged, and what both short- and long-term objectives of the ecumenical movement should be. Ecumenism and [[Nondenominational Christianity|non-denominational]] or post-denominational movements are not necessarily the same thing.

[[Baptism]] according to the [[Trinitarian formula]], which is done in most [[mainstream Christian]] denominations, is seen as being a basis for Christian ecumenism, the concept of unity amongst Christians.<ref name="Pizzey2019"/><ref name="WCC1997"/>

==Historic divisions in Christianity==
===Christian denominations today===
Christianity has not been a monolithic faith since the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]], also known as the "Apostolic Age", and in the present day, a number of widely varied Christian groups exist, both within and without mainstream Christianity. Despite the division between these groups, a number of commonalities exist throughout their traditions, understanding of [[theology]], [[Ecclesiology|governing church systems]], doctrine and language. As such, many of these groups are visibly divided into different [[Koinonia|communions]] or [[Christian denominations|denominations]], groupings of Christians and their churches in [[full communion]] with one another, but to some degree set apart from other Christians.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Christianity: A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World's Christian Population |publisher=Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life |access-date=February 21, 2019 |url=https://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Christianity-fullreport-web.pdf |date=December 2011 |via=International Center for Law and Religion Studies}}</ref>

The [[World Council of Churches]] counts 348 member churches, representing more than half a billion members of the major Christian traditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=WCC Member Churches |url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches|website=World Council of Churches}}</ref> This, with the [[Catholic Church]]'s 1.25 billion Christians,<ref>{{cite web|title=World Mission Day: Catholic Church Statistics 2015|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/vatican-world-mission-day-catholic-church-statis-5|publisher=Official Vatican News Network}}</ref> indicates that 349 churches/denominations already account for nearly 80% of the world's Christian population.

One problem with the larger numbers is that single denominations can be counted multiple times. For example, the Catholic Church is a single church, or communion, comprising 24 distinct [[Sui iuris|self-governing]] particular churches in full communion with the [[Pope|bishop of Rome]] (the largest being the [[Latin Church]], commonly called "Roman Catholic"). Further, the Catholic Church's presence in each country is counted as a different denomination—though this is in no way an ecclesiologically accurate definition. This can result in the one Catholic Church being counted as 242 distinct denominations, as in the ''World Christian Encyclopedia''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Facts and Stats on '33,000. Denominations'|url=http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/a106.htm#Catholics|website=Evangelical Catholic Apologetics}}</ref>

Additionally, single nondenominational congregations or megachurches without denominational affiliation are effectively counted each as its own denomination, resulting in cases where entire "denominations" may account for only a handful of people. Other denominations may be very small remnants of once larger churches. The United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing ([[Shakers]]) have only two full members, for example, yet are a distinct denomination.

Most current divisions are the result of historical [[schism|schisms]]—a break in the full communion between previously united Churches, bishops, or communities. Some historical schisms proved temporary and were eventually healed, others have hardened into the denominations of today. However individual denominations are counted, it is generally acknowledged that they fall into the following major "families" of churches:
* The [[Catholic Church]];
* [[Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] churches;
* [[Mainline Protestant]], [[Old Catholic]], and [[Anglican Communion]] churches; 
* The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]];
* Independent or marginally Christian groups and sects ([[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Unitarian Universalist]]s, [[Christadelphian]]s, etc.) (not generally regarded as Christian)

In the [[United States]], the historic racial/ethnic churches are sometimes counted as a distinct family of churches, though they may otherwise fit into any one of the previous categories.<ref>{{cite web |title=Organizational Plan |url= http://christianchurchestogether.org/organizational-plan/ |publisher=Christian Churches Together in the U.S.A.}}</ref>

Some of these families are in themselves a single communion, such as the [[Catholic Church]]. Other families are a very general movement with no universal governing authority. Protestantism, for example, includes such diverse groups as [[Adventism|Adventists]], [[Anabaptists]], [[Baptists]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]], [[Evangelical Christianity|Evangelicals]], [[Holiness movement|Holiness churches]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]], and [[Reformed churches]]. Many of these have, as a result of ecumenical dialogue, established full or partial communion agreements.

===Ancient apostolic churches===
{{Further information|Christology#Post-Apostolic controversies}}

The oldest lasting schism in Christianity resulted from fifth-century disagreements on [[Christology]], heightened by [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Culture|cultural]], and [[Politics|political]] differences.

The first significant, lasting split in historic Christianity, the so-called [[Nestorian Schism]], came from the [[Church of the East]], consisting largely of Eastern Syriac churches outside the [[Roman Empire]], who left full communion after 431 in response to misunderstandings and personality conflicts at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]]. After fifteen centuries of estrangement, the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] entered into an ecumenical dialogue in the 1980s, resulting in agreement on the very issue that split them asunder, in the [[Common Christological Declaration between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East|1994 Common Christological Declaration]], which identifies the origin of the schism as largely linguistic, due to problems of translating very delicate and precise terminology from Latin to [[Aramaic]] and vice versa.

As part of the then-ongoing Christological controversy, following the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451, the next large split came with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac]] and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] churches dividing themselves. The churches dissented from Chalcedon, becoming today's Oriental Orthodox Churches. These also include the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], and the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] in India. In modern times, there have also been moves towards healing this division, with common Christological statements being made between [[Pope John Paul II]] and Syriac patriarch [[Ignatius Zakka I Iwas]], as well as between representatives of both Oriental Orthodoxy and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].<ref>Chapman, J. (1911). [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10489b.htm "Monophysites and Monophysitism".] in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved June 4, 2009</ref>

===Great Schism===
{{Further information|East–West Schism}}

Although the Christian world as a whole did not experience any major church divisions for centuries afterward, the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern]], predominantly Greek-speaking and [[Western Christianity|Western]], predominantly Latin-speaking, cultural divisions drifted toward isolation, culminating in the mutual excommunication of [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Michael I Cerularius]] and the legate of then-deceased [[Pope of Rome]] [[Leo IX]] in 1054, in what is known as the [[Great Schism (Christianity)|Great Schism]]. The canonical separation was sealed by the Latin [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacking of Constantinople]] (1204) during the [[Fourth Crusade]] and through the poor reception of the [[Council of Florence]] (1449) among the Orthodox Eastern Churches.

The political and theological reasons for the schism are complex. Aside from the natural rivalry between the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] or Byzantine Empire and the [[Franks|Franco-Latin]] [[Holy Roman Empire]], one major controversy was the inclusion and acceptance in the West in general – and in the diocese of Rome in particular – of the [[Filioque clause]] ("and the Son") into the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]], which the East viewed as a violation of ecclesiastical procedure at best, an abuse of [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome|papal authority]] as only an [[Ecumenical Council]] could amend what had been defined by a previous council, and a heresy at worst, inasfar as the Filioque implies that the essential divinity of the Holy Spirit is derived not from the Father alone as ''arche'' (singular head and source), but from the [[Perichoresis|perichoretic]] union between the Father and the Son. That the hypostasis or persona of the Spirit either is or is produced by the mutual, pre-eternal love between God and His Word is an explanation which Eastern Christian detractors have alleged is rooted in the medieval [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] appropriation of [[Plotinus|Plotinian]] [[Neoplatonism]]. (See Augustine of Hippo, ''[[On the Trinity|De Trinitate]]''.)

Both West and East agreed that the patriarch of [[Rome]] was owed a "primacy of honour" by the other patriarchs (those of [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], [[Constantinople]] and [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]), but the West also contended that this primacy extended to jurisdiction, a position rejected by the Eastern patriarchs. Various attempts at dialogue between the two groups would occur, but it was only in the 1960s, under Pope [[Paul VI]] and [[Patriarch Athenagoras]], that significant steps began to be made to mend the relationship between the two. In 1965, the excommunications were "committed to oblivion".

The resulting division remains, however, providing the "[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]" and the "[[Orthodox Catholic Church|Orthodox Church]]", both of which are globally distributed bodies and no longer restricted geographically or culturally to the "West" or "East", respectively. (There exist both Eastern Rite Roman Catholicism and Western Rite Orthodoxy, for example.) There is an ongoing and fruitful [[Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches|Catholic-Orthodox dialogue]].

===Western schisms and reformations===
{{main article|Protestant Reformation|Catholic Reformation}}
In Western Christianity, there were a handful of geographically isolated movements that preceded in the spirit of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[Cathars]] were a very strong movement in medieval southwestern France, but did not survive into modern times, largely as a result of the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. In northern Italy and southeastern France, [[Peter Waldo]] founded the [[Waldensians]] in the 12th century, which remains the largest non-Catholic church in Italy and is in full communion with the Italian Methodist Church. In [[Bohemia]], a movement in the early 15th century by [[Jan Hus]] called the [[Hussite]]s called for reform of Catholic teaching and still exists to this day, known as the [[Moravian Church]]. Though generally counted among [[Protestant]] churches, groups such as the Waldensians and Moravians pre-exist Protestantism proper.

The Protestant Reformation began, symbolically, with the posting of [[Martin Luther]]'s "[[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]]" in [[Saxony]] on October 31, 1517, written as a set of grievances to reform the Western Church. [[Martin Luther (resources)|Luther's writings]], combined with the work of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] theologian [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and French theologian and politician [[John Calvin]], sought to reform existing problems in doctrine and practice. Due to the reactions of ecclesiastical office holders at the time of the reformers, the Roman Catholic Church separated from them, instigating a rift in [[Western Christianity]]. This schism created the [[Mainline Protestant]] Churches, including especially the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] traditions.

In [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England]] declared himself to be supreme head of the [[Church of England]] with the [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1531, repressing both Lutheran reformers and those loyal to the pope. [[Thomas Cranmer]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] introduced the [[English Reformation]] in a form compromising between the Calvinists and Lutherans.<ref name="AEH2003">{{cite book|title=Anglican and Episcopal History|year=2003|publisher=Historical Society of the Episcopal Church|language=en|page=15|quote=Others had made similar observations, Patrick McGrath commenting that the Church of England was not a middle way between Roman Catholic and Protestant, but "between different forms of Protestantism," and William Monter describing the Church of England as "a unique style of Protestantism, a via media between the Reformed and Lutheran traditions." MacCulloch has described Cranmer as seeking a middle way between Zurich and Wittenberg but elsewhere remarks that the Church of England was "nearer Zurich and Geneva than Wittenberg."}}</ref> This schism created today's [[Anglican Communion]].

The [[Radical Reformation]], also mid-sixteenth century, moved beyond both [[Anglican]] and [[Protestant]] reformations, emphasizing the invisible, spiritual reality of the Church, apart from any visible ecclesial manifestation. A significant group of Radical reformers were the [[Anabaptists]], people such as [[Menno Simons]] and [[Jakob Ammann]], whose movements resulted in today's communities of [[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], and Brethren churches, and to some extent, the [[Bruderhof Communities]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/|title=Bruderhof – Fellowship for Intentional Community|work=Fellowship for Intentional Community|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-US}}</ref>

Further reform movements within Anglicanism during the 16th through 18th centuries, with influence from the Radical Reformation, produced the [[Puritans]] and [[English Dissenters|Separatists]], creating today's [[Baptists]], [[Congregationalists]], [[Quakers]], and eventually [[Unitarian Universalism]].

The [[Methodist]] churches, which uphold [[Wesleyan-Arminian theology]], grew out of a revival within Anglicanism, especially in England and the [[thirteen colonies|American colonies]], under the leadership of the brothers [[John Wesley]] and [[Charles Wesley]], both priests in the Church of England. This movement also produced the [[Holiness movement]] churches.

The [[Old Catholic Church]] split from the Catholic Church in the 1870s because of the promulgation of the [[dogma]] of [[Papal Infallibility]] as promoted by the [[First Vatican Council]] of 1869–1870. The term "Old Catholic" was first used in 1853 to describe the members of the See of Utrecht who were not under Papal authority. The Old Catholic movement grew in America but has not maintained ties with Utrecht, although talks are under way between some independent Old Catholic bishops and Utrecht.

The [[Evangelical]] movement takes form as the result of spiritual renewal efforts in the anglophone world in the 18th century. According to religion scholar, social activist, and politician [[Randall Balmer]], Evangelicalism resulted "from the confluence of Pietism, Presbyterianism, and the vestiges of Puritanism. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain – warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans".{{Sfn | Balmer| 2004 |pp=vii–viii}} Historian [[Mark Noll]] adds to this list [[High Church]] Anglicanism, which contributed to Evangelicalism a legacy of "rigorous spirituality and innovative organization".{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | p=45}}

[[Pentecostalism]] is likewise born out of this context, and traditionally traces its origins to what it describes as an outpouring of the Holy Spirit on 1 January 1901 in [[Topeka, Kansas]], at the [[Bethel Bible College]]. Subsequent charismatic revivals in [[1904–1905 Welsh Revival|Wales in 1904]] and the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in 1906 are held as the beginnings of the Pentecostal movement. For a Spirit-believing Christian, it is not coincidence that these started just a few hours after [[Pope Leo XIII]] lead a prayer ''Veni Spiritus Sanctus'' during his ''[[urbi et orbi]]'' message, consecrating the 20th century to the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]] and through this prayer to the reunion of Christianity.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Quickness of the Spirit|url=http://www.ccr.org.uk/about-ccr/goodnews-articles/a-quickness-of-the-spirit/|website=Catholic Charismatic Renewal}}</ref>

==Modern ecumenical movement==
One understanding of the ecumenical movement is that it came from the Roman Catholic Church's attempts to reconcile with Christians who had become separated over theological issues.<ref name="Howard C. Kee 1998">Howard C. Kee et al., ''Christianity: a Social and Cultural History'', 2nd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ.: Prentice Hall, 1998), 379–81.</ref> Others see the [[1910 World Missionary Conference]] as the birthplace of the ecumenical movement.<ref>Latourette, Kenneth Scott. "Ecumenical Bearings of the Missionary Movement and the International Missionary Council." In "A History of the Ecumenical Movement 1517–1948", edited by Ruth Rouse and Stephen Charles Neill, 353–73, 401–02. Geneva: World Council of Churches, 1954.</ref> Others yet point to the 1920 encyclical of the Eastern Orthodox [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] [[Germanus V of Constantinople|Germanus V]] "To the Churches of Christ Everywhere" that suggested a "fellowship of churches" similar to the League of Nations.<ref>Grdzelidze, Tamara. "Ecumenism, Orthodoxy and" In "The Encyclopedia of Eastern Orthodox Christianity", edited by John Anthony McGuckin, 208–15. Wiley Blackwell, 2011.</ref>

Earlier, Nicolaus Ludwig, Count von [[Zinzendorf]], (1700–1760) the renewer of the [[Moravian Church]] in the 18th century, was the first person to use the word "ecumenical" in this sense. His pioneering efforts to unite all Christians, regardless of denominational labels, into a "Church of God in the Spirit"—notably among [[Germany|German]] immigrants in [[Pennsylvania]]—were misunderstood by his contemporaries.

[[Nathan Söderblom]], [[Archbishop of Uppsala]], the head of the [[Church of Sweden|Lutheran church in Sweden]], is known as the architect of the ecumenical movement of the twentieth century. During the First World War, he called on all Christian leaders to work for peace and justice. His leadership of the Christian "[[Life and Work (conference)|Life and Work]]" movement in the 1920s has led him to be recognised as one of the principal founders of the ecumenical movement. His was instrumental in chairing the [[World Conference of Life and Work]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] in 1925. At the Stockholm Conference in 1925, the culminating event in Söderblom's ecumenical work, the Anglican, Protestant, and Orthodox Christians were all present and participating, with the exception of the [[Catholic Church]], which was a much regretted absence. He was a close friend of the English ecumenist [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]]. In 1930 was one of the [[List of Nobel laureates|recipients]] of the [[Nobel Prize]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, for the:''Cooperation between Christian Church Communities Brings Peace'' and the first clergyman to receive this prize.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1930/soderblom-bio.html|title=Nathan Söderblom, Nobel Prize Winner |publisher=/www.nobelprize.org|access-date=1 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1930/soderblom-facts.html|title=nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1930/soderblom-facts|publisher=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=1 February 2015}}</ref>

The contemporary ecumenical movement gained speed through the 1910 [[Edinburgh Missionary Conference]]. However this conference would not have been possible without the pioneering ecumenical work of the Christian youth movements: the [[Young Men's Christian Association]] (founded 1844), the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (founded 1855), the [[World Student Christian Federation]] (founded 1895), and the Federal Council of Churches (founded 1908), predecessor to today's [[National Council of Churches USA]]. Led by [[Methodist]] layman [[John R. Mott]] (former YMCA staff and in 1910 the General Secretary of WSCF), the World Mission conference marked the largest Protestant gathering to that time, with the express purposes of working across denominational lines for the sake of [[Mission (Christian)|world missions]]. After the [[First World War]] further developments were the "[[Faith and Order Movement|Faith and Order]]" movement led by [[Charles Henry Brent]], and the "[[Life and Work (conference)|Life and Work]]" movement led by [[Nathan Soderblom]]. In the 1930s, the tradition of an annual [[World Communion Sunday]] to celebrate ecumenical ties was established in the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian Church]] and was subsequently adopted by several other denominations.

After [[World War I]], which had brought much devastation to many people, the church became a source of hope to those in need. In 1948, the first meeting of the [[World Council of Churches]] took place. Despite the fact that the meeting had been postponed due to World War II, the council took place in Amsterdam with the theme of "Man’s Disorder and God’s Design".<ref name="Howard C. Kee 1998" /> The focus of the church and the council following the gathering was on the damage created by the Second World War. The council and the movement went forward to continue the efforts of unifying the church globally around the idea of helping all those in need, whether it be a physical, emotional, or spiritual need. The movement led to an understanding amongst the churches that, despite difference, they could join together to be an element of great change in the world. To be an agent of hope and peace amongst the chaos and destruction that humans seem to create. More importantly the council and the movement lead to not only ecumenism but to the forming of councils amongst the denominations that connected churches across continental lines.<ref name="Howard C. Kee 1998" /> Today, the [[World Council of Churches]] sees its role as sharing "the legacy of the one ecumenical movement and the responsibility to keep it alive" and acting "as a trustee for the inner coherence of the movement".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/about-us/achievements|title=The WCC and the ecumenical movement|publisher=oikoumene.org|access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref>

==Three approaches to Christian unity==
For some [[Protestants]], spiritual unity, and often unity on the church's teachings on central issues, suffices. According to [[Lutheran]] theologian [[Edmund Schlink]], most important in Christian ecumenism is that people focus primarily on [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], not on separate church organizations. In Schlink's book ''Ökumenische Dogmatik'' (1983), he says Christians who see the risen Christ at work in the lives of various Christians or in diverse churches realize that the unity of Christ's church has never been lost,<ref>[[Edmund Schlink]], ''Ökumenische Dogmatik'' (1983), pp. 694–701; also his "Report," ''Dialog'' 1963, 2:4, 328.</ref> but has instead been distorted and obscured by different historical experiences and by spiritual myopia.

Both are overcome in renewed faith in Christ. Included in that is responding to his admonition (John 17; Philippians 2) to be one in him and love one another as a witness to the world. The result of mutual recognition would be a discernible worldwide fellowship, organized in a historically new way.<ref>[[Edmund Schlink]], ''Ökumenische Dogmatik'' (1983), pp. 707–08; also Skibbe, ''A Quiet Reformer'' 1999, 122–24; Schlink, ''The Vision of the Pope'' 2001.</ref>

For a significant part of the Christian world, one of the highest goals to be sought is the reconciliation of the various denominations by overcoming the historical divisions within Christianity. Even where there is broad agreement upon this goal, approaches to ecumenism vary. Generally, Protestants see fulfillment of the goal of ecumenism as consisting in general agreements on teachings about central issues of faith, with mutual pastoral accountability between the diverse churches regarding the teachings of salvation.

For Catholics and Orthodox on the other hand, the true unity of [[Christendom]] is treated in accordance with their more sacramental understanding of the [[Body of Christ]]; this ecclesiastical matter for them is closely linked to key theological issues (e.g. regarding the [[Eucharist]] and the [[historical Episcopate]]), and requires full dogmatic assent to the [[Holy Tradition|pastoral authority of the Church]] for [[full communion]] to be considered viable and valid. Thus, there are different answers even to the ''[[ecclesiology|question of the church]]'', which finally is the goal of the ecumenist movement itself. However, the desire of unity is expressed by many denominations, generally that all who profess faith in Christ in sincerity, would be more fully cooperative and supportive of one another.

For the Catholic and Orthodox churches, the process of approaching one another can be described as formally split in two successive stages: the "dialogue of love" and the "dialogue of truth".<ref>“A Church in Dialogue: Towards the Restoration of Unity Among Christians” (The Episcopal Commission for Christian Unity, Religious Relations with the Jews,
and Interfaith Dialogue of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2014), 9, 11. Online at http://www.cccb.ca/site/images/stories/pdf/A_Church_in_Dialogue_long_version_EN.PDF.</ref> Examples of acts belonging to the former include the mutual revocation in 1965 of the [[anathema]]s of 1054 (see below [[#Contemporary developments|Contemporary developments]]), returning the relics of [[Sabbas the Sanctified]] (a common saint) to [[Mar Saba]] in the same year, and the first visit of a Pope to an Orthodox country in a millennium ([[Pope]] [[John Paul II]] accepting the invitation of the [[Patriarch]] of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], [[Teoctist]], in 1999), among others. The later one, involving effective theological engagement on matters of dogma, is only just commencing.

Christian ecumenism can be described in terms of the three largest divisions of Christianity: Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant. While this underemphasizes the complexity of these divisions, it is a useful model.

===Catholicism===
{{Main article|Catholic Church and ecumenism}}
[[File:Te Deum Ecuménico 2009.jpg|thumb|''Te Deum Ecuménico 2009'' in the [[Santiago Metropolitan Cathedral]], Chile. An ecumenical gathering of clergy from different denominations.]]
The [[Catholic Church]] has always considered it a duty of the highest rank to seek full unity with estranged communions of fellow-Christians and, at the same time, to reject what it sees as a false union that would mean being unfaithful to or glossing over the teaching of sacred scripture and tradition.

Before the [[Second Vatican Council]], the main stress was laid on this second aspect, as exemplified in canon 1258 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law:
# It is illicit for the faithful to assist at or participate in any way in non-Catholic religious functions.
# For a serious reason requiring, in case of doubt, the Bishop's approval, passive or merely material presence at non-Catholic funerals, weddings and similar occasions because of holding a civil office or as a courtesy can be tolerated, provided there is no danger of perversion or scandal.

The 1983, [[Canon law (Catholic Church)#Codification|Code of Canon Law]] has no corresponding canon. It absolutely forbids Catholic priests to concelebrate the Eucharist with members of communities which are not in full communion (canon 908), but allows, in certain circumstances and under certain conditions, other sharing in the sacraments. The ''Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism'', 102<ref>[http://www.adoremus.org/EcumenismNorms.html Directory For The Application Of Principles And Norms On Ecumenism<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> states: "Christians may be encouraged to share in spiritual activities and resources, i.e., to share that spiritual heritage they have in common in a manner and to a degree appropriate to their present divided state."

[[Pope John XXIII]], who convoked the council that brought this change of emphasis about, said that the council's aim was to seek renewal of the church itself, which would serve, for those separated from the See of Rome, as a "gentle invitation to seek and find that unity for which Jesus Christ prayed so ardently to his heavenly Father".<ref>Encyclical [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_xxiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_29061959_ad-petri_en.html ''Ad Petri cathedram'']</ref>

Some elements of the Catholic perspective on ecumenism are illustrated in the following quotations from the council's decree on ecumenism, ''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]]'' of 21 November 1964, and [[Pope John Paul II]]'s encyclical, ''[[Ut Unum Sint]]'' of 25 May 1995.

{{quote|Every renewal of the Church is essentially grounded in an increase of fidelity to her own calling. Undoubtedly this is the basis of the movement toward unity … There can be no ecumenism worthy of the name without a change of heart. For it is from renewal of the inner life of our minds, from self-denial and an unstinted love that desires of unity take their rise and develop in a mature way. We should therefore pray to the Holy Spirit for the grace to be genuinely self-denying, humble. gentle in the service of others, and to have an attitude of brotherly generosity towards them. … The words of St. John hold good about sins against unity: "If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us". So we humbly beg pardon of God and of our separated brethren, just as we forgive them that trespass against us.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html ''Unitatis Redintegratio''] 6–7</ref>}}

{{quote|Christians cannot underestimate the burden of long-standing misgivings inherited from the past, and of mutual misunderstandings and prejudices. Complacency, indifference and insufficient knowledge of one another often make this situation worse. Consequently, the commitment to ecumenism must be based upon the conversion of hearts and upon prayer, which will also lead to the necessary purification of past memories. With the grace of the Holy Spirit, the Lord's disciples, inspired by love, by the power of the truth and by a sincere desire for mutual forgiveness and reconciliation, are called to re-examine together their painful past and the hurt which that past regrettably continues to provoke even today.<ref>Encyclical ''Ut unum sint'', 2[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum-sint_en.html]</ref>}}

{{quote|In ecumenical dialogue, Catholic theologians standing fast by the teaching of the Church and investigating the divine mysteries with the separated brethren must proceed with love for the truth, with charity, and with humility. When comparing doctrines with one another, they should remember that in Catholic doctrine there exists a "hierarchy" of truths, since they vary in their relation to the fundamental Christian faith. Thus the way will be opened by which through fraternal rivalry all will be stirred to a deeper understanding and a clearer presentation of the unfathomable riches of Christ.<ref>''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]]'', 11[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html]</ref>}}

{{quote|The unity willed by God can be attained only by the adherence of all to the content of revealed faith in its entirety. In matters of faith, compromise is in contradiction with God who is Truth. In the Body of Christ, "the way, and the truth, and the life" (Jn 14:6), who could consider legitimate a reconciliation brought about at the expense of the truth?...Even so, doctrine needs to be presented in a way that makes it understandable to those for whom God himself intends it.<ref>Encyclical ''Ut unum sint'', 18–19[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25051995_ut-unum-sint_en.html]</ref>}}

{{quote|When the obstacles to perfect ecclesiastical communion have been gradually overcome, all Christians will at last, in a common celebration of the Eucharist, be gathered into the one and only Church in that unity which Christ bestowed on his Church from the beginning. We believe that this unity subsists in the Catholic Church as something she can never lose, and we hope that it will continue to increase until the end of time.<ref>''[[Unitatis Redintegratio]]'', 4[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decree_19641121_unitatis-redintegratio_en.html]</ref>}}

While some Eastern Orthodox churches commonly baptize converts from the Catholic Church, thereby refusing to recognize the baptism that the converts have previously received, the Catholic Church has always accepted the validity of all the sacraments administered by the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches.

The Catholic Church likewise has very seldom applied the terms "[[heterodoxy|heterodox]]" or "[[heresy|heretic]]" to the Eastern Orthodox churches or its members, though there are clear differences in doctrine, notably about the authority of the Pope, Purgatory, and the [[filioque]] clause. More often, the term "separated" or "[[Schism|schismatic]]" has been applied to the state of the Eastern Orthodox churches.

===Orthodoxy===
[[File:Fond-du-lac-circus.preview.jpg|350px|thumb|The consecration of [[Reginald Heber Weller|The Rt. Rev Weller]] as an Anglican bishop at the [[St. Paul's Cathedral, Fond du Lac|Cathedral of St. Paul the Apostle]] in the [[Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac|Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac]], with the Rt. Rev. Anthony Kozlowski of the [[Polish National Catholic Church]] and the [[Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow]] (along with his chaplains [[John Kochurov|Fr. John Kochurov]], and Fr. Sebastian Dabovich) of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] present]]
The [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches are two distinct bodies of local churches. The churches within each body share [[full communion]], although there is not official communion between the two bodies. Both consider themselves to be the original church, from which the [[Western Christianity|West]] was divided in the 5th and 11th centuries, respectively (after the 3rd and 7th [[Ecumenical council]]s).

Many theologians of the Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxies engage in theological dialogue with each other and with some of the Western churches, though short of full communion. The Eastern Orthodox have participated in the ecumenical movement, with students active in the [[World Student Christian Federation]] since the late 19th century. Most Eastern Orthodox<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/church-families/orthodox-churches-eastern|title=Orthodox churches (Eastern)|publisher=oikoumene.org|access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref> and all Oriental Orthodox churches<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oikoumene.org/en/church-families/orthodox-churches-oriental|title=Orthodox churches (Oriental)|publisher=oikoumene.org|access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref> are members of the [[World Council of Churches]]. [[Kallistos of Diokleia]], a bishop of the Eastern Orthodox Church has stated that ecumenism "is important for Orthodoxy: it has helped to force the various Orthodox Churches out of their comparative isolation, making them meet one another and enter into a living contact with non-Orthodox Christians."<ref name="Diokleia_1993">{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Kallistos |title=The Orthodox Church|date=28 April 1993|publisher=Penguin Adult|isbn=978-0-14-014656-1|page=322}}<!--|accessdate=23 April 2015--></ref>

Historically, the relationship between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the [[Anglican Communion]] has been congenial, with the Patriarch of Constantinople in 1922 recognising Anglican [[Holy orders|orders]] as valid. He wrote: "That the orthodox theologians who have scientifically examined the question have almost unanimously come to the same conclusions and have declared themselves as accepting the validity of Anglican Orders."<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/patriarc.htm The Ecumenical Patriarch on Anglican Orders<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020125091106/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgbmxd/patriarc.htm |date=January 25, 2002 }}</ref> Moreover, some Eastern Orthodox bishops have assisted in the ordination of Anglican bishops; for example, in 1870, the Most Reverend Alexander Lycurgus, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Syra and Tinos, was one of the bishops who consecrated [[Henry Mackenzie (bishop)|Henry MacKenzie]] as the [[Anglican Bishop of Nottingham|Suffragan Bishop of Nottingham]].<ref name="Redmile2006">{{cite book|last=Redmile|first=Robert David|title=The Apostolic Succession and the Catholic Episcopate in the Christian Episcopal Church of Canada |date=1 September 2006|isbn=978-1-60034-517-3|page=239|quote=In 1870, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Syra and Tinos, the Most Reverend Alexander Lycurgus, paid a visit to the British Isles.

Archbishop Lycurgus agreed to assist, and on 2 February 1870, he joined in the laying on of hands with the Bishop of London at the consecration of Bishop MacKenzie. Thus the Apostolic Succession in the Greek Orthodox Church was passed on to the Bishops of the Anglican Communion, and through them to the Christian Episcopal Churches in the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada.}}<!--|accessdate=23 April 2015--></ref>{{self-published source|date=September 2017}} From 1910–1911, the era before [[World War I]], [[Raphael of Brooklyn]], an Eastern Orthodox bishop, "sanctioned an interchange of ministrations with the [[Anglicanism|Episcopalians]] in places where members of one or the other communion are without clergy of their own".<ref name="Herbermann1912">{{cite book|last=Herbermann|first=Charles|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church|year=1912|publisher=Robert Appleton|page=149|quote=This A.E.O.C.U. is particularly active in the United States, where the existence side by side of Westerns and Easterns offers special facilities for mutual intercourse.

Furthermore, when an Orthodox Layman is dying, if he confesses his sins, and professes that he is dying in the full communion of the Orthodox Faith, as expressed in the Orthodox version of the Nicene Creed, and the other requirements of the said Church, and desires the Blessed Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, at the hands of an Episcopal Clergyman, permission is hereby given to administer to him this Blessed Sacrament, and to be buried according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Episcopal Church.

===Protestantism===
Protestants are involved in a variety of ecumenical groups, working in some cases toward organic denominational unity and in other cases for cooperative purposes alone. Because of the wide spectrum of Protestant denominations and perspectives, full cooperation has been difficult at times. [[Edmund Schlink]]'s ''Ökumenische Dogmatik'' (1983, 1997) proposes a way through these problems to mutual recognition and renewed church unity.

The members of the [[Anglican Communion]] have generally embraced the Ecumenical Movement, actively participating in such organizations as the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA]]. Most provinces holding membership in the Anglican Communion have special departments devoted to ecumenical relations; however, the influence of [[Liberal Christianity]] has in recent years caused tension within the communion, causing some to question the direction ecumenism has taken them.

Each member church of the Anglican Communion makes its own decisions with regard to [[intercommunion]]. The 1958 [[Lambeth Conference]] recommended "that where between two Churches not of the same denominational or confessional family, there is unrestricted ''[[full communion|communio in sacris]]'', including mutual recognition and acceptance of ministries, the appropriate term to use is '[[full communion]]', and that where varying degrees of relation other than 'full communion' are established by agreement between two such churches the appropriate term is '[[intercommunion]]'."

Full communion has been established between Provinces of the Anglican Communion and these Churches:
*[[Old Catholic Church]]es of Europe
*[[Philippine Independent Church]]
*[[Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Malabar]]
*[[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]
*[[Moravian Church]] in America, Northern and Southern Provinces

Full communion has been established between the Anglican Churches of Europe ([[Church of England|England]], [[Church in Wales|Wales]], [[Episcopal Church of Scotland|Scotland]], [[Church of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Spanish Reformed Episcopal Church|Spain]], [[Lusitanian Catholic Apostolic Evangelical Church|Portugal]] and [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe|Gibraltar in Europe]]) and the Lutheran Churches of Northern Europe ([[Church of Norway|Norway]], [[Church of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Church of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Finland]], [[Church of Iceland|Iceland]], [[Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church|Estonia]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[Lutheran Church in Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the [[Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church Abroad]]) with the [[Porvoo Communion]]. 

The [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] is currently engaged in dialogue with the following religious bodies:
*[[Churches Uniting in Christ]] (CUIC)
*[[Eastern Orthodox Church]]
*[[Roman Catholic Church]]
*[[Presbyterian Church USA]]
*[[United Methodist Church]]
*[[Reformed Episcopal Church]] and the [[Anglican Province of America]]

Worldwide, an estimated forty million Anglicans belong to churches that do not participate in the Anglican Communion {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}, a particular organization limited to one province per country. In these Anglican churches, there is strong opposition to the ecumenical movement and to membership in such bodies as the World and National Councils of Churches. Most of these churches are associated with the [[Continuing Anglican movement]] or the movement for [[Anglican realignment]]. While ecumenicalism in general is opposed, certain Anglican church bodies that are not members of the Anglican Communion—the [[Free Church of England]] and the [[Church of England in South Africa]], for example—have fostered close and cooperative relations with other evangelical (if non-Anglican) churches, on an individual basis.

===Catholic–Orthodox dialogue===

The mutual [[anathema]]s (excommunications) of 1054, marking the Great Schism between Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) branches of Christianity, a process spanning several centuries, were revoked in 1965 by Pope Paul VI and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]. The Roman Catholic Church does not regard Orthodox Christians as excommunicated, since they personally have no responsibility for the separation of their churches. In fact, Catholic rules admit the Orthodox to communion and the other sacraments in situations where the individuals are in danger of death or no Orthodox churches exist to serve the needs of their faithful. However, Orthodox churches still generally regard Roman Catholics as excluded from the sacraments and some may even not regard Catholic sacraments such as baptism and ordination as valid.<ref>{{cite web|author=Metropolitan Philaret|title=A Protest to Patriarch Athenagoras: On the Lifting of the Anathemas of 1054|date=December 1965|publisher=Orthodox Christian Information Center|url=http://orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/philaret_lifting.aspx}}</ref>

In November 2006, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] traveled to Istanbul at the invitation of [[Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople]] and participated in the feast day services of St. Andrew the First Apostle, the patron saint of the Church of Constantinople. The Ecumenical Patriarch and Pope Benedict had another historic meeting in Ravenna, Italy in 2007. The [[Declaration of Ravenna]] marked a significant rapprochement between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox positions. The declaration recognized the bishop of Rome as the Protos, or first among equals of the Patriarchs. This acceptance and the entire agreement was hotly contested by the Russian Orthodox Church. The signing of the declaration highlighted the pre-existing tensions between the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Moscow Patriarchate. Besides their theological concerns, the Russian Orthodox have continuing concerns over the question of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] that operate in what they regard as Orthodox territory. This question has been exacerbated by disputes over churches and other property that the Communist authorities once assigned to the Orthodox Church but whose restoration these Churches have obtained from the present authorities.

A major obstacle to improved relations between the Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches has been the insertion of the Latin term [[filioque]] into the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]] in the 8th and 11th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P17.HTM#XTCatechism |title= Cathecism of the Catholic Church, 247 |publisher=Vatican.va |access-date=2013-04-25}}</ref> This obstacle has now been effectively resolved. The Roman Catholic Church now recognizes that the Creed, as confessed at the [[First Council of Constantinople]], did not add "and the Son", when it spoke of the Holy Spirit as proceeding from the Father. When quoting the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]], as in the 6 August 2000 document ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'', it does not include ''filioque''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_en.html |title=Dominus Iesus |publisher=Vatican.va |access-date=2013-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411015820/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_en.html |archive-date=2013-04-11 }}</ref> It views as complementary the Eastern-tradition expression "who proceeds from the Father" (profession of which it sees as affirming that he comes from the Father through the Son) and the Western-tradition expression "who proceeds from the Father and the Son", with the Eastern tradition expressing firstly the Father's character as first origin of the Spirit, and the Western tradition giving expression firstly to the consubstantial communion between Father and Son; and it believes that, provided this legitimate complementarity does not become rigid, it does not affect the identity of faith in the reality of the same mystery confessed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/TREATBR.HTM |title=Article 1 of the Treaty of Brest |publisher=Ewtn.com |access-date=2013-04-25}}</ref>

Continuing dialogues at both international and national level continues between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches. A particularly close relationship has grown up between Pope Francis and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. Both church leaders have in particular emphasized their common concern for refugees and persecuted Christians in the Middle East. The 2016 [[Pan-Orthodox Council]] that was held in Crete aroused great expectations for advances in Church unity. However, not all Orthodox churches participated and, as a result, the Russian Patriarch refused to recognize the council as a truly ecumenical gathering. A major milestone in the growing rapprochement between the Catholic and Orthodox churches was the 12 February 2016 meeting held in Havana, Cuba between Patriarch Kirill and Pope Francis. The two church leaders issued a [[Joint Declaration of Pope Francis and Patriarch Kirill]] at the conclusion of their discussions.

===Issues within Protestantism===
Contemporary developments in mainline Protestant churches have dealt a serious blow to ecumenism. The decision by the U.S. [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] to ordain [[Gene Robinson]], an openly gay, non-celibate priest who advocates same-sex blessings, as bishop led the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to suspend its cooperation with the Episcopal Church. Likewise, when the [[Church of Sweden]] decided to bless same-sex marriages, the Russian Patriarchate severed all relations with the Church, noting that "Approving the shameful practice of same-sex marriages is a serious blow to the entire system of European spiritual and moral values influenced by Christianity."<ref>[http://english.pravda.ru/%20main/18/90/359/16696_gay.html Russian Orthodox Church condemns Lutheran gay weddings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606075539/http://english.pravda.ru/%20main/18/90/359/16696_gay.html |date=2011-06-06 }} ''Pravda,'' 30 December 2005. Accessed 24 March 2009.</ref>

Bishop [[Hilarion Alfeyev]] commented that the inter-Christian community is "bursting at the seams". He sees the great dividing line—or "abyss"—not so much between old churches and church families as between "traditionalists" and "liberals", the latter now dominating Protestantism, and predicted that other Northern Protestant Churches will follow suit and this means that the "ecumenical ship" will sink, for with the liberalism that is materializing in European Protestant churches, there is no longer anything to talk about.<ref>[http://www.synod.com/synod/en/documents/enart_interviewrocor.html Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev: Will the Ecumenical Ship Sink?] The Official Website of the Synod of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. Accessed 24 March 2009.</ref>

Organizations such as the [[World Council of Churches]], the [[National Council of Churches USA]], [[Churches Uniting in Christ]], [[Pentecostal Charismatic Peace Fellowship]] and [[Christian Churches Together]] continue to encourage ecumenical cooperation among Protestants, Eastern Orthodox, and, at times, Roman Catholics. There are universities such as the [[University of Bonn]] in Germany that offer degree courses in "Ecumenical Studies" in which theologians of various denominations teach their respective traditions and, at the same time, seek for common ground between these traditions.

The Global Christian Forum (GCF) was founded in 1998 following the proposal of the then General Secretary of the WCC, Rev. Konrad Raiser, that a new, independent space should be created where participants could meet on an equal basis to foster mutual respect and to explore and address together common concerns through a [[postmodern Christianity|postmodern approach]].<ref>Domenic Marbaniang, "Unity in the Body", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'', Vol. 3, No. 1 {{ISSN|2231-5233}} (Bangalore: CFCC, August 2011), p. 36</ref>

Influenced by the ecumenical movement, the "scandal of separation" and local developments, a number of [[United and uniting churches]] have formed; there are also a range of mutual recognition strategies being practiced where formal union is not feasible. An increasing trend has been the sharing of church buildings by two or more denominations, either holding separate services or a single service with elements of all traditions.

==Opposition to ecumenism==
===Opposition from some Catholics===
Most [[Traditionalist Catholicism|Traditionalist Catholics]] (such as [[Society of Saint Pius X]], [[Society of Saint Pius V]], [[Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter]], [[Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen]], [[Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]] etc.) are almost universally opposed to ecumenism with other faith groups. Critics in the Catholic church are often critical of Vatican II documents that promote ecumenism, such as ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' and ''[[Unitatis redintegratio]]''. Catholic opponents to ecumenism often cite preceding papal documents such as ''Mortalium Animos'' (1928) by [[Pope Pius XI]], who considered the position that the Church of Christ can be divided into sections and that the Unity of the Church has not been achieved as a false opinion. Considering these notions, Pius XI continued "[T]he Apostolic See cannot on any terms take part in [non-Catholic] assemblies, nor is it anyway lawful for Catholics either to support or to work for such enterprises; for if they do so they will be giving countenance to a false Christianity, quite alien to the one Church of Christ. Shall We suffer, what would indeed be iniquitous, the truth, and a truth divinely revealed, to be made a subject for compromise? For here there is question of defending revealed truth."<ref>Mortalium Animos, Pius XI. http://www.papalencyclicals.net/pius11/p11morta.htm</ref> Many traditional-leaning Catholics often strictly interpret the teaching of ''[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]]'' ("outside the Church there is no salvation"), or that salvation can only be found in the church.<ref>[https://www.unionleader.com/news/religion/slaves-of-the-immaculate-heart-of-mary-sanctioned-by-catholic/article_ac1831fa-113f-5f55-a625-2649bd79cd5b.html?block_id=664688 Fisher, Damian.

In November 2015 Pope Francis stirred controversy among Catholics when he addressed a gathering of Lutherans in Rome regarding the issue of inter-communion. Addressing the issue of a whether a Lutheran woman married to a Catholic man and attended mass together could receive communion together, Francis said that while he could not give permission for her to receive communion, if she would pray about it and come forward he could not deny her communion. Cardinal [[Robert Sarah]] and Bishop [[Athanasius Schneider]] reacted to the pope's comments saying it would almost never be acceptable for a non-Catholic to receive communion.<ref name="Aleteia">{{cite web|title=Cardinal Sarah, Bishop Schneider Respond to Pope's Comment on Intercommunion|url=https://aleteia.org/2015/11/30/cardinal-sarah-and-bishop-schneider-respond-to-pope-francis-comments-on-intercommunion/|publisher=[[Aleteia]]|date=November 30, 2015|access-date=November 20, 2019|first=Diane|last=Montagna}}</ref> On the matter of inter-communion Sarah said "Inter-communion is not permitted between Catholics and non-Catholics. You must confess the Catholic Faith. A non-Catholic cannot receive Communion. That is very, very clear. It’s not a matter of following your conscience."<ref name="Aleteia"/>

In early 2019 [[Barry C. Knestout]], the 13th bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond]], gave permission to the [[Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia]] to ordain Susan B. Haynes as the new bishop at St. Bede Catholic Church in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]. The Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia does not have a cathedral and usually rotates where it hosts ordinations and other events.<ref>{{cite web|title='An act of charity': Virginia bishop defends parish hosting Episcopalian consecration|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/an-act-of-charity-virginia-bishop-defends-parish-hosting-episcopalian-consecration-92025|publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]]|first=Christine|last=Rousselle|date=January 15, 2020|access-date=January 17, 2020}}</ref> However the announcement was met with opposition by many Catholics who objected to holding a non-Catholic worship service and [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|women's bishop ordination]] in a Catholic church. Over 3,000 people signed an internet petition objecting to the event. On 17 January the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia announced it would no longer hold Haynes' ordination at St. Bede.<ref>{{cite web|title=Catholic parish will not host Episcopalian consecration|url=https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2020/01/17/catholic-parish-will-not-host-episcopalian-consecration/|publisher=[[Catholic World Report]]|date=January 17, 2020|access-date=January 17, 2020}}</ref>

===Opposition from some Methodists===
There are some members of the [[United Methodist Church]] who oppose ecumenical efforts which are "not grounded in the doctrines of the Church" due to concerns over theological compromise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.episcopalchurch.org/documents/abrahampaper.pdf|title=United Methodist Evangelicals and Ecumenism|year=2012|publisher=Southern Methodist University|access-date=11 November 2012|author=William J. Abraham|author-link=William J. Abraham}}</ref> For example, an article published in ''Catalyst Online: Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives for United Methodist Seminarians'' stated that false ecumenism might result in the "blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalystresources.org/issues/303balmer.html |publisher=Catalyst Online: Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives for United Methodist Seminarians |year=1998 |title=The Future of American Protestantism |access-date=11 November 2012 |author=Randall Balmer |author-link=Randall Balmer |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415002847/http://catalystresources.org/issues/303balmer.html |archive-date=April 15, 2012 }}</ref>

===Opposition from some Lutherans===
Most churches following the doctrine of [[Confessional Lutheranism]] are generally strongly opposed to ecumenical activities. Most notably the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) bars its clergy from worshiping with other faiths, contending "that church fellowship or merger between church bodies in doctrinal disagreement with one another is not in keeping with what the Bible teaches about church fellowship."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.episcopalchurch.org/documents/abrahampaper.pdf|title=A Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod|year=2009|publisher=Concordia Publishing House|access-date=7 February 2013}}</ref> In keeping with this position, a Connecticut LCMS pastor was asked to apologize by the president of the denomination, and did so, for participating in an interfaith prayer vigil for the 26 children and adults [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|killed at a Newtown elementary school]]; and a LCMS pastor in New York was suspended for praying at an interfaith vigil in 2001, twelve days after the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/pastor-apologizes-role-prayer-vigil-connecticut-massacre-021918940.html |title=Pastor apologizes for role in prayer vigil after Connecticut massacre |work=Reuters |year=2013 |access-date=7 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208120345/http://news.yahoo.com/pastor-apologizes-role-prayer-vigil-connecticut-massacre-021918940.html |archive-date=February 8, 2013 }}</ref> Another conservative Lutheran body, the [[American Association of Lutheran Churches]], is strongly opposed to ecumenical (more accurately, [[interfaith dialogue|interfaith]]) dialogue with non-Christian religions and with denominations it identifies as cults.

===Opposition from some Reformed Christians===
When the [[Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience|Manhattan Declaration]] was released, many prominent [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] figures – particularly of the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] Reformed tradition – opposed it, including [[John F. MacArthur]], [[D. James Kennedy]], [[Alistair Begg]], [[R. C. Sproul]], and [[Arminianism|Arminian]] Protestant teacher and televangelist [[John Ankerberg]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Document on Interfaith Cooperation Causes Rift : Dispute: Unofficial paper drawn up between evangelicals and Catholics draws criticism from Protestants who say it undermines basic tenets.|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-03-04-me-38744-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 4, 1995|access-date=July 5, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Irreconcilable Differences: Catholics, Evangelicals, and the New Quest for Unity, Parts 1-3|publisher=[[Grace to You]]}}</ref>

===Opposition from some Anglicans/Episcopalians===
[[William David Walker]], who was the first bishop of [[Episcopal Diocese of North Dakota|North Dakota]] (1883–1896), and [[Episcopal Diocese of Western New York|Western New York]] (1897–1917), was strongly opposed to dialogue with over other denominations.<ref>Review of G.

Clowes Chorley in the ''Historical Magazine of the Protestant Episcopal Church'' Vol. 5, No. 1 (March 1936), 71.</ref> In his address to the 1914 Convention of the Diocese of Western New York, Walker said that "in my opinion while divided Christendom remains, separated sects are better apart—each peaceably working out its own salvation."<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA54&dq=The+Diocese+of+Western+New+York&id=NxkRAAAAIAAJ#v=onepage&q=The%20Diocese%20of%20Western%20New%20York&f=false ''Journal of the Proceedings of the Annual Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Western New York, Volumes 77–79 '' (The Diocese, 1914), 63.]</ref>

At his accession in 1902, Patriarch Joachim III sent an encyclical letter to all the autocephalous Orthodox Churches, asking in particular for their opinion on relations with other Christian bodies. In January 1920 the Ecumenical Patriarchate followed this up with a bold and prophetic letter addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations. Many of the ideas in this letter anticipate subsequent developments in the WCC. Constantinople, along with several of the other Orthodox Churches, was represented at the Faith and Order Conferences at Lausanne in 1927 and at Edinburgh in 1937. The Ecumenical Patriarchate also participated in the first Assembly of the WCC at Amsterdam in 1948, and has been a consistent supporter of the work of the WCC ever since.}}<!--|accessdate=23 April 2015--></ref>

However, many Orthodox Christians are vehemently opposed to ecumenism with other Christian denominations. They view ecumenism, as well as interfaith dialogue, as being potentially pernicious to Orthodox Church Tradition; a "weakening" of Orthodoxy itself.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ecumenism Awareness Introduction|access-date=2008-12-30|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/|author=Patrick Barnes|publisher=Orthodox Christian Information Center}}</ref> In the Eastern Orthodox world, the monastic community of [[Mount Athos]], arguably the most important center of Orthodox spirituality, has voiced its concerns regarding the ecumenist movement and opposition to the participation of the Orthodox Church.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorandum on the Participation of the Orthodox Church in the World Council of Churches|date=2007-02-18|access-date=2008-11-01|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/memorandum-on-the-participation-of-the-orthodox-church-in-the-world-council-of-churches.aspx|author=The Theological Committee of the Sacred Community of Mount Athos|publisher=orthodoxinfo.com}}</ref> They regard modern ecumenism as compromising essential doctrinal stands in order to accommodate other Christians, and object to the emphasis on dialogue leading to intercommunion rather than conversion on the part of participants in ecumenical initiatives.

Protestant political activism emerged principally in England, the Lowlands, and Scandinavia under the inspiration of both social gospel movements and neo-Calvinism. Catholic political activism emerged principally in Italy, France, and Spain under the inspiration of both Rerum Novarum and its early progeny and of neo-Thomism. Both formed political parties, which now fall under the general aegis of the Christian Democratic Party movement. Both Protestant and Catholic parties inveighed against the reductionist extremes and social failures of liberal democracies and social democracies. Liberal democracies, they believed, had sacrificed the community for the individual; social democracies had sacrificed the individual for the community. Both parties returned to a traditional Christian teaching of "social pluralism" or "subsidiarity," which stressed the dependence and participation of the individual in family, church, school, business, and other associations. Both parties stressed the responsibility of the state to respect and protect the "individual in community."}}</ref> From its inception, Christian Democracy fosters an "ecumenical unity achieved on the religious level against the [[state atheism|atheism]] of the government in the Communist countries".<ref name="Dussel1981">{{cite book|last=Dussel|first=Enrique|title=A History of the Church in Latin America|year=1981|publisher=Wm.

==Ecumenical symbols==
===Ecumenical symbol===
The ecumenical symbol pre-dates the [[World Council of Churches]] (WCC), formed in 1948, but is incorporated into the official logo of the WCC and many other ecumenical organizations.

{{quotation|The church is portrayed as a boat afloat on the sea of the world with the mast in the form of a cross. These early Christian symbols of the church embody faith and unity and carry the message of the ecumenical movement.... The symbol of the boat has its origins in the gospel story of the calling of the disciples by Jesus and the stilling of the storm on Lake Galilee.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ecumenical Symbol|url=https://www.oikoumene.org/en/resources/logo|website=World Council of Churches}}</ref>}}

===Christian flag===
{{Main article|Christian Flag}}
[[File:Christian flag.svg|right|thumb|The Christian flag]]

Though originating in the Wesleyan tradition, and most popular among mainline and evangelical Protestant churches, the "Christian Flag" stands for no creed or denomination, but for Christianity. With regard to the [[Christian symbolism]] of the flag:

{{quotation|The ground is white, representing peace, purity and innocence. In the upper corner is a blue square, the color of the unclouded sky, emblematic of heaven, the home of the Christian; also a symbol of faith and trust. in the center of the blue is the cross, the ensign and chosen symbol of Christianity: the cross is red, typical of Christ's blood.<ref name=CA1909>{{cite journal|date=7 January 1909|title=Christian Flag|journal=[[The Christian Advocate]]|publisher=T. Carlton & J. Porter|location=New York|volume=84|quote=Within recent years (1897) a flag has been designed which shall stand as an emblem around which all Christian nations and various denominations may rally in allegiance and devotion. This banner is called the Christian flag. It was originated by Charles C. Overton of Brooklyn, N.Y., whose first thought of it came to him while addressing a Sunday school at a rally day service. The flag is most symbolic. The ground is white, representing peace, purity and innocence. In the upper corner is a blue square, the color of the unclouded sky, emblematic of heave, the home of the Christian; also a symbol of faith and trust. in the center of the blue is the cross, the ensign and chosen symbol of Christianity: the cross is red, typical of Christ's blood. The use of the national flag in Christian churches has become almost universal throughout the world.}}</ref>}}

An ecumenical Christian organization, the [[Federal Council of Churches]] (now succeeded by the [[National Council of Churches]] and [[Christian Churches Together]]), adopted the flag on 23 January 1942.<ref name=CA2014>{{cite journal|year=1942|title=Resolution|journal=Federal Council Bulletin|publisher=Religious Publicity Service of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America|volume=25-27}}</ref>
