  Please note:
    The consensus since April 2007 has been to include all three of the definitions of atheism presented in the first paragraph below. They are the result of extensive debate and searches through existing sources – see, for example, the archived talkpage threads [[Talk:Atheism/Archive 27#A survey of definitions for atheism]] and [[Talk:Atheism/Archive 29#List of definitions]] – and formed part of the article when it achieved "Featured Article" status.

    Please, therefore, do not change the contents of the first paragraph without prior discussion on the talk page ([[Talk:Atheism]]), preferably after consulting at least these two threads. If you do make changes to the paragraph without prior discussion, be prepared to see them reverted as an invitation to discussion on the talk page (see [[Wikipedia:BRD]]).

The [[etymology|etymological]] root for the word ''atheism'' originated before the 5th century BCE from the ancient Greek {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}} (''atheos''), meaning "without god(s)". In antiquity, it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society,<ref name="drachmann" /> those who were forsaken by the gods, or those who had no commitment to belief in the gods.<ref name="Battling Whitmarsh" /> The term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed.<ref name="Battling Whitmarsh">{{cite book |last1=Whitmarsh |first1=Tim |title=Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |isbn=978-0-307-94877-9 |chapter=8.

<br />
Explicit strong/positive/hard atheists (in {{Font color|purple|'''purple'''}} on the '''right''') assert that ''"at least one deity exists"'' is a false statement.
<br />
Explicit weak/negative/soft atheists (in {{Font color|blue|'''blue'''}} on the '''right''') reject or eschew belief that any deities exist without actually asserting that ''"at least one deity exists"'' is a false statement.
<br />
Implicit weak/negative atheists (in {{Font color|blue|'''blue'''}} on the '''left'''), according to authors such as George H. Smith, would include people (such as young children and some agnostics) who do not believe in a deity but have not explicitly rejected such belief.

Writers disagree on how best to define and classify ''atheism'',<ref name="eb1911-atheism" /> contesting what supernatural entities are considered gods, whether it is a philosophic position in its own right or merely the absence of one, and whether it requires a conscious, explicit rejection. Atheism has been regarded as compatible with [[agnosticism]],<ref name="agnosticism-compatible" /><ref name="flint-agnostic-atheism" /><ref name="encyc-unbelief-compatible" /><ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails" /><ref name="barker-agnostic-atheism" /><ref name="besant-open-to-new-truth" /><ref name="holyoake-question-of-probability" /> but has also been contrasted with it.<ref name="eb2011-atheism-critique" /><ref name="eb2011concise-atheism" /><ref name="eb1911-atheism-sceptical" /> A variety of categories have been used to distinguish the different forms of atheism.

=== Range ===
Some of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining ''atheism'' arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for the definitions of words like ''deity'' and ''god''. The variety of wildly different [[conceptions of God]] and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. The ancient Romans accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping the [[paganism|pagan]] deities. Gradually, this view fell into disfavor as ''theism'' came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity.{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity, to the existence of any [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[supernatural]], or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] concepts, such as those of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Taoism]].<ref name="eb2011-Rejection-of-all-religious-beliefs" />

=== Implicit vs. explicit ===
{{Main|Implicit and explicit atheism}}
Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist. This broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, [[Baron d'Holbach]] said that "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God."<ref>{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P.H.T. |author-link=Baron d'Holbach |title=Good Sense |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7319 |year=1772 |access-date=April 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131908/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7319 |archive-date=June 23, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>
Similarly, [[George H. Smith]] (1979) suggested that: "The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist."<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=14}}.</ref>  ''Implicit atheism'' is "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it" and ''explicit atheism'' is the conscious rejection of belief.
For the purposes of his paper on "philosophical atheism", [[Ernest Nagel]] contested including the mere absence of theistic belief as a type of atheism.<ref name= Nagel1959>{{cite book |title=Basic Beliefs: The Religious Philosophies of Mankind |chapter=Philosophical Concepts of Atheism |first=Ernest |last=Nagel |author-link=Ernest Nagel |year=1959 |publisher=Sheridan House |quote=I must begin by stating what sense I am attaching to the word "atheism," and how I am construing the theme of this paper. I shall understand by "atheism" a critique and a denial of the major claims of all varieties of theism. &nbsp;... atheism is not to be identified with sheer unbelief, or with disbelief in some particular creed of a religious group. Thus, a child who has received no religious instruction and has never heard about God is not an atheist – for he is not denying any theistic claims. Similarly in the case of an adult who, if he has withdrawn from the faith of his father without reflection or because of frank indifference to any theological issue, is also not an atheist – for such an adult is not challenging theism and not professing any views on the subject. &nbsp;... I propose to examine some ''philosophic'' concepts of atheism&nbsp;...}}
<br />reprinted in ''Critiques of God'', edited by Peter A. Angeles, Prometheus Books, 1997.</ref> [[Graham Oppy]] classifies as ''innocents'' those who never considered the question because they lack any understanding of what a god is. According to Oppy, these could be [[Infant cognitive development|one-month-old babies]], humans with severe traumatic [[Brain injury|brain injuries]], or patients with [[dementia|advanced dementia]].{{sfn|Oppy|2018|p=4|ps=: Agnostics are distinguished from innocents, who also neither believe that there are gods nor believe that there are no gods, by the fact that they have given consideration to the question of whether there are gods. Innocents are those who have never considered the question of whether there are gods. Typically, innocents have never considered the question of whether there are gods because they are not able to consider that question. How could that be? Well, in order to consider the question of whether there are gods, one must understand what it would mean for something to be a god. That is, one needs to have the concept of a god. Those who lack the concept of a god are not able to entertain the thought that there are gods. Consider, for example, one-month-old babies. It is very plausible that one-month-old babies lack the concept of a god. So it is very plausible that one-month-old babies are innocents. Other plausible cases of innocents include chimpanzees, human beings who have suffered severe traumatic brain injuries, and human beings with advanced dementia}}

{{Main|Negative and positive atheism}}
Philosophers such as [[Antony Flew]]<ref name="presumption">{{harvnb|Flew|1976|pp=14ff}}: "In this interpretation, an atheist becomes: not someone who positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist. Let us, for future-ready reference, introduce the labels 'positive atheist' for the former and 'negative atheist' for the latter."</ref>
and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]]{{sfn|Martin|2006}} have contrasted positive (strong/hard) atheism with negative (weak/soft) atheism. Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Negative atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist.
The terms ''weak'' and ''strong'' are relatively recent, while the terms ''negative'' and ''positive'' atheism are of older origin, having been used (in slightly different ways) in the philosophical literature<ref name="presumption" /> and in Catholic apologetics.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |title=On the Meaning of Contemporary Atheism |journal=The Review of Politics |first=Jacques |last=Maritain |date=July 1949 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=267–280 |doi=10.1017/S0034670500044168 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113062053/http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |archive-date=November 13, 2005}}</ref>
Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.

While Martin, for example, asserts that [[agnosticism]] [[logical consequence|entails]] negative atheism,<ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails" /> many agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism,<ref name=Kenny2006 /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/omar-baddar/why-im-not-an-atheist-the-case-for-agnosticism_b_3345544.html |title=Why I'm Not an Atheist: The Case for Agnosticism |date=May 28, 2013 |publisher=Huffington Post |access-date=November 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209105433/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/omar-baddar/why-im-not-an-atheist-the-case-for-agnosticism_b_3345544.html |archive-date=December 9, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The assertion of unattainability of knowledge for or against the existence of gods is sometimes seen as an indication that atheism requires a [[leap of faith]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Many atheists I know would be certain of a high place in heaven |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |last=O'Brien |first=Breda |author-link=Breda O'Brien |work=Irish Times |access-date=April 9, 2011 |date=July 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520132651/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |archive-date=May 20, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Warner |first=Matthew |url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/matthew-warner/more-faith-to-be-an-atheist-than-a-christian |title=More faith to be an atheist than a Christian |date=June 8, 2012 |access-date=November 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603062347/http://www.ncregister.com/blog/matthew-warner/more-faith-to-be-an-atheist-than-a-christian |archive-date=June 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>
Common atheist responses to this argument include that unproven ''[[faith#Faith in world religions|religious]]'' propositions deserve as much disbelief as all ''other'' unproven propositions,<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|pp=30–34}}. "Who seriously claims we should say 'I neither believe nor disbelieve that the Pope is a robot', or 'As to whether or not eating this piece of chocolate will turn me into an elephant I am completely agnostic'. In the absence of any good reasons to believe these outlandish claims, we rightly disbelieve them, we don't just suspend judgement."</ref>
and that the unprovability of a god's existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=22}}. "A lack of proof is no grounds for the suspension of belief. This is because when we have a lack of absolute proof we can still have overwhelming evidence or one explanation which is far superior to the alternatives."</ref>
Australian philosopher [[J.J.C. Smart]] even argues that "sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalized [[philosophical skepticism]] which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever, except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic."<ref name="stanford">{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/ |title=Atheism and Agnosticism |first=J.C.C. |last=Smart |date=March 9, 2004 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=April 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/654hYPmzk?url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/ |archive-date=January 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>
Consequently, some atheist authors such as [[Richard Dawkins]] prefer distinguishing theist, agnostic and atheist positions along a [[spectrum of theistic probability]]—the likelihood that each assigns to the statement "God exists".{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=50}}

Before the 18th century, the existence of God was so accepted in the Western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called ''theistic [[innatism]]''—the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cudworth |first=Ralph |author-link=Ralph Cudworth |title=The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the first part, wherein all the reason and philosophy of atheism is confuted and its impossibility demonstrated |year=1678}}</ref>

Some atheists have challenged the need for the term "atheism". In his book ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] wrote:
<blockquote>In fact, "atheism" is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a "non-[[Astrology|astrologer]]" or a "non-[[Alchemy|alchemist]]". We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=ypyMZlkgHGIC&pg=PA51&dq=%22No+one+ever+needs+to+identify+himself+as+a+%22non-astrologer%22%22or+a%22%22non-alchemist%22 51]}}</blockquote>

== Arguments ==
[[File:D'Holbach.jpg|thumb|[[Baron d'Holbach|Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach]], an 18th-century advocate of atheism.
<br />&nbsp;<br />
"The source of man's unhappiness is his ignorance of Nature. The pertinacity with which he clings to blind opinions imbibed in his infancy, which interweave themselves with his existence, the consequent prejudice that warps his mind, that prevents its expansion, that renders him the slave of fiction, appears to doom him to continual error."<ref>Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, ''System of Nature; or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World'' (London, 1797), Vol. 1, p. 25</ref>]]

=== Epistemological arguments ===
{{Further|Agnostic atheism|Theological noncognitivism}}
Atheists have also argued that people cannot know a God or prove the existence of a God. The latter is called agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. [[Skepticism]], based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists. Hume, however, held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as "sophistry and illusion".<ref name="hume-metaphysics" /> The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.<ref name="Zdybicka-p20">{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}.</ref>

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or [[ontology|ontological]], including  [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A.J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.<ref>[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998). "[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GW3XHMxP?url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html |date=10 May 2013 }}".

In a footnote, Ayer attributes this view to "Professor H.H. Price".</ref>

=== Metaphysical arguments ===
{{Further|Monism|Physicalism}}
Philosopher, [[Zofia Zdybicka]] writes:
{{quote|"Metaphysical atheism&nbsp;... includes all doctrines that hold to metaphysical monism (the homogeneity of reality). Metaphysical atheism may be either: a) absolute — an explicit denial of God's existence associated with materialistic monism (all materialistic trends, both in ancient and modern times); b) relative — the implicit denial of God in all philosophies that, while they accept the existence of an absolute, conceive of the absolute as not possessing any of the attributes proper to God: transcendence, a personal character or unity. Relative atheism is associated with idealistic monism (pantheism, panentheism, deism)."<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=19}}.</ref>}}

[[File:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|left|[[Epicurus]] is credited with first expounding the [[problem of evil]]. [[David Hume]] in his ''[[Dialogues concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) cited Epicurus in stating the argument as a series of questions:{{sfn|Hume|1779}}
"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"]]

Such atheists present [[existence of God#Deductive arguments|deductive arguments]] against the existence of God, which assert the incompatibility between certain traits, such as perfection, creator-status, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]], [[omniscience]], [[omnipresence]], [[omnipotence]], [[omnibenevolence]], [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], personhood (a personal being), non-physicality, [[justice]], and [[mercy]].<ref name=logical>{{cite web |author=Various authors |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/logical.html |title=Logical Arguments for Atheism |publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] |website=The Secular Web Library |access-date=October 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117012714/http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/logical.html |archive-date=November 17, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Theodicy|Theodicean]] atheists believe that the world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with the qualities commonly ascribed to God and gods by theologians.

{{Further|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Psychology of religion}}
Philosopher [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]<ref>Feuerbach, Ludwig (1841) ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]''</ref>
and psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] have argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs, or a projection mechanism from the 'Id' omnipotence; for [[Vladimir Lenin]], in 'Materialism and Empirio-criticism', against the [[Russian Machism]], the followers of [[Ernst Mach]], Feuerbach was the final argument against belief in a god. This is also a view of many [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].<ref>Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught.'' Grove Press, 1974. pp. 51–52.</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class. According to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], "the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory, and practice." He reversed [[Voltaire]]'s aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him, writing instead that "if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |title=God and the State |last=Bakunin |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Bakunin |year=1916 |publisher=New York: Mother Earth Publishing Association |access-date=April 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521195435/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |archive-date=May 21, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Atheistic philosophies ==
{{Further|Atheist existentialism|Secular humanism}}
[[Axiology|Axiological]], or constructive, atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a "higher absolute", such as [[Human nature|humanity]]. This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God. Marx and Freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation, full-development, and unfettered happiness.<ref name="Zdybicka-p20" /> One of the most common [[criticism of atheism|criticisms of atheism]] has been to the contrary: that denying the existence of a god either leads to [[moral relativism]] and leaves one with no moral or ethical foundation,<ref name="misconceptions">{{cite web |url=http://articles.exchristian.net/2006/12/common-misconceptions-about-atheists.html |title=Common Misconceptions About Atheists and Atheism |last=Gleeson |first=David |date=August 10, 2006 |access-date=November 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001241/http://articles.exchristian.net/2006/12/common-misconceptions-about-atheists.html |archive-date=December 31, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> or renders life [[meaning of life (religious)|meaningless]] and miserable.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}.

''[[Pensées]]'', II: "The Misery of Man Without God".</ref>

French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] identified himself as a representative of an "[[atheist existentialism]]"{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
concerned less with denying the existence of God than with establishing that "man needs&nbsp;... to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself, not even a valid proof of the existence of God."{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=45}}
Sartre said a corollary of his atheism was that "if God does not exist, there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence, a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept, and&nbsp;... this being is man."{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
The practical consequence of this atheism was described by Sartre as meaning that there are no ''a priori rules'' or absolute values that can be invoked to govern human conduct, and that humans are "condemned" to invent these for themselves, making "man" absolutely "responsible for everything he does".{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=32}}

The strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity; as such, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the [[moral universalism]] of [[humanism]], which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to [[moral nihilism]], which holds that morality is meaningless.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|pp=21–22}}</ref> Atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Chakravarti |first=Sitansu |title=Hinduism, a way of life |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1991 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_-rASTgw8wC&pg=PA71 |isbn=978-81-208-0899-7 |quote=According to Hinduism, the path of the atheist is very difficult to follow in matters of spirituality, though it is a valid one. |access-date=April 9, 2011}}</ref>

=== Divine command ===
According to Plato's [[Euthyphro dilemma]], the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary. [[Divine command theory|The argument that morality must be derived from God]], and cannot exist without a wise creator, has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Among the many myths associated with religion, none is more widespread {{sic}} – or more disastrous in its effects — than the myth that moral values cannot be divorced from the belief in a god."</ref><ref>In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (Book Eleven: ''Brother Ivan Fyodorovich'', Chapter 4) there is the famous argument that ''If there is no God, all things are permitted.'': "'But what will become of men then?' I asked him, 'without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?'"</ref><ref name="Kant CPR A811">For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was a practical concern, for "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams&nbsp;..." (''Critique of Pure Reason'', A811).</ref>
Moral precepts such as "murder is wrong" are seen as [[divine law]]s, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a [[false analogy]], and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=38}}</ref>

(among others) assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience. Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern, for example, that "thou shalt steal" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it—and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=43}}</ref>
The contemporary British political philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] has offered the more historically telling example of Biblical injunctions in favor of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs, rather than vice versa, but also noted that the same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers.<ref>101 Ethical Dilemmas, 2nd edition, by Cohen, M., Routledge 2007, pp&nbsp;184–185.

[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Marx]]]]

The 19th-century German political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx called religion "the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]". He goes on to say, "The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo."<ref>Marx, K. 1976.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Ephesians 2,12 - Greek atheos.jpg|thumb|left|The Greek word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}} (''atheoi''), as it appears in the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|2:12}}) on the early 3rd-century [[Papyrus 46]]. It is usually translated into English as "[those who are] without God".<ref>The word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}}—in any of its forms—appears nowhere else in the [[Septuagint]] or the [[New Testament]]. {{cite book |last=Robertson |first=A.T. |title=Word Pictures in the New Testament |orig-year=1932 |year=1960 |publisher=Broadman Press |chapter=Ephesians: Chapter 2 |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/r/robertson_at/wordpictures/htm/EPH2.RWP.html |quote=Old Greek word, not in LXX, only here in N.T.

In early [[ancient Greek]], the adjective ''{{Transl|grc|átheos}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}}, from the [[privative a|privative ἀ-]] + {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θεός|θεός]]}} "god") meant "godless". It was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning "ungodly" or "impious". In the 5th century BCE, the word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in the sense of "severing relations with the gods" or "denying the gods". The term [[:wikt:ἀσεβής|ἀσεβής]] (''{{Transl|grc|asebēs}}'') then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods, even if they believed in other gods. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ''{{Transl|grc|átheos}}'' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἀθεότης|ἀθεότης]]}} (''{{Transl|grc|atheotēs}}''), "atheism". [[Cicero]] transliterated the Greek word into the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:atheos#Latin|átheos]]}}''. The term found frequent use in the debate between [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and [[Ancient Greek religion|Hellenists]], with each side attributing it, in the pejorative sense, to the other.<ref name=drachmann>{{cite book |last=Drachmann |first=A.B. |title=Atheism in Pagan Antiquity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cguq-yNii_QC&q=Atheism+in+Pagan+Antiquity |publisher=Chicago: Ares Publishers |year=1977 |orig-year=1922 |isbn=978-0-89005-201-3 |quote=Atheism and atheist are words formed from Greek roots and with Greek derivative endings.

In exactly the same way as ungodly, ''{{Transl |grc |átheos}}'' was used as an expression of severe censure and moral condemnation; this use is an old one, and the oldest that can be traced.

Among the six [[Astika and Nastika|orthodox]] schools of Hindu philosophy, [[Samkhya]], the oldest philosophical school of thought, does not accept God, and the early [[Mimamsa]] also rejected the notion of God.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dasgupta |first=Surendranath |title=A history of Indian philosophy, Volume 1 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=1992 |page=258 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&pg=PA258 |isbn=978-81-208-0412-8}}</ref>
The thoroughly materialistic and anti-theistic philosophical [[Cārvāka]] (or ''Lokāyata'') school that originated in [[India]] around the 6th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India, similar to the Greek [[Cyrenaic school]]. This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as [[nastika|heterodox]] due to its rejection of the authority of [[Vedas]] and hence is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.<ref>Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore. ''A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy''. (Princeton University Press: 1957, Twelfth Princeton Paperback printing 1989) pp. 227–249. {{ISBN|0-691-01958-4}}.</ref>
Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Cārvāka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:<ref>Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta.

(University of Calcutta: 1984). p. 55.</ref>{{quote|Though [[materialism]] in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organized school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these.}}

Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include [[Samkhya|Classical Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa|Purva Mimamsa]].

=== Early Middle Ages to the Renaissance ===
During the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Islamic world]] experienced a [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]]. Along with advances in science and philosophy, Arab and Persian lands produced outspoken rationalists and atheists, including [[Muhammad al Warraq]] (fl. 9th century), [[Ibn al-Rawandi]] (827–911), [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Al-Razi]] (854–925), and [[Al-Maʿarri]] (973–1058). Al-Ma'arri wrote and taught that religion itself was a "fable invented by the ancients"<ref name="Nicholson318">Reynold Alleyne Nicholson, 1962, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', p. 318. Routledge</ref> and that humans were "of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains."<ref>[http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html Freethought Traditions in the Islamic World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214102422/http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html |date=February 14, 2012 }} by Fred Whitehead; also quoted in Cyril Glasse, (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 278. Rowman Altamira.</ref>  Despite their being relatively prolific writers, little of their work survives, mainly being preserved through quotations and excerpts in later works by Muslim [[Apologetics|apologists]] attempting to refute them.<ref>''Al-Zandaqa Wal Zanadiqa'', by Mohammad Abd-El Hamid Al-Hamad, first edition 1999, Dar Al-Taliaa Al-Jadida, Syria (Arabic)</ref> Other prominent Golden Age scholars have been associated with rationalist thought and atheism as well, although the current intellectual atmosphere in the Islamic world, and the scant evidence that survives from the era, make this point a contentious one today.

In Europe, the espousal of atheistic views was rare during the Early Middle Ages and [[Middle Ages]] (see [[Medieval Inquisition]]); [[metaphysics]] and theology were the dominant interests pertaining to religion.<ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4">{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=4}}</ref> There were, however, movements within this period that furthered heterodox conceptions of the Christian god, including differing views of the nature, transcendence, and knowability of God. Individuals and groups such as [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], [[David of Dinant]], [[Amalric of Bena]], and the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] maintained Christian viewpoints with [[pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies. [[Nicholas of Cusa]] held to a form of [[fideism]] he called ''[[De Docta Ignorantia|docta ignorantia]]'' ("learned ignorance"), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and thus our knowledge of him is limited to conjecture. [[William of Ockham]] inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his [[nominalism|nominalistic]] limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine [[essence]] could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as [[John of Mirecourt]] and [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] furthered this view. The resulting division between [[Faith and rationality|faith and reason]] influenced later radical and reformist theologians such as [[John Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus]], and [[Martin Luther]].<ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4" />

The [[Renaissance]] did much to expand the scope of free thought and skeptical inquiry. Individuals such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought experimentation as a means of explanation, and opposed [[Appeal to authority|arguments from religious authority]]. Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Bonaventure des Périers]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], and [[François Rabelais]].<ref name="gordonstein" />

=== Early modern period ===
Historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church, which in turn "quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches".<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p. 388</ref> [[Deism]] gained influence in France, Prussia, and England. The philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] was "probably the first well known 'semi-atheist' to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era", according to Blainey. Spinoza believed that natural laws explained the workings of the universe. In 1661 he published his ''Short Treatise on God''.<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p. 343</ref>

[[Criticism of Christianity]] became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious [[malaise]], according to contemporary sources. Some Protestant thinkers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences, while Spinoza rejected [[divine providence]] in favor of a [[panentheistic]] naturalism. By the late 17th century, deism came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as [[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]] who coined the term "pantheist".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pantheism |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=November 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223113/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pantheism |archive-date=December 2, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The philosopher [[David Hume]] developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in [[empiricism]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy has strongly questioned the very possibility of a metaphysical knowledge. Both philosophers undermined the metaphysical basis of natural theology and criticized classical [[arguments for the existence of God]].

[[File:Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) would greatly influence philosophers such as [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[David Strauss]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Max Stirner]]. He considered God to be a human invention and religious activities to be wish-fulfillment. For this he is considered the founding father of modern [[anthropology of religion]].]]
Blainey notes that, although [[Voltaire]] is widely considered to have strongly contributed to atheistic thinking during the Revolution, he also considered fear of God to have discouraged further disorder, having said "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.&nbsp;390–391</ref> In ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), the philosopher [[Edmund Burke]] denounced atheism, writing of a "literary cabal" who had "some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the Christian religion. This object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety&nbsp;... These atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own&nbsp;...". But, Burke asserted, "man is by his constitution a religious animal" and "atheism is against, not only our reason, but our instincts; and&nbsp;... it cannot prevail long".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/reflections-on-the-revolution-in-france/ |title=Reflections on the Revolution in France |website=adelaide.edu.au |access-date=November 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203033011/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/reflections-on-the-revolution-in-france/ |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Baron d'Holbach]] was a prominent figure in the [[French Enlightenment]] who is best known for his atheism and for his voluminous writings against religion, the most famous of them being ''[[The System of Nature]]'' (1770) but also ''[[Christianity Unveiled]]''. One goal of the [[French Revolution]] was a restructuring and subordination of the clergy with respect to the state through the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Attempts to enforce it led to [[anticlericalism|anti-clerical]] violence and the expulsion of many clergy from France, lasting until the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]. The radical [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] seized power in 1793, ushering in the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Jacobins were deists and introduced the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] as a new French state religion. Some atheists surrounding [[Jacques Hébert]] instead sought to establish a [[Cult of Reason]], a form of atheistic pseudo-religion with a goddess personifying reason. The [[Napoleonic era]] further institutionalized the secularization of French society.

In the latter half of the 19th century, atheism rose to prominence under the influence of [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] philosophers. Many prominent German philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion, including [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BKz2FcDrFy0C&pg=PA1 |title=Subjectivity and Irreligion: Atheism and Agnosticism in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |last=Ray |first=Matthew Alun |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7546-3456-0 |access-date=April 9, 2011}}</ref>

Atheism, particularly in the form of practical atheism, advanced in many societies in the 20th century.

[[File:Honourable Bertrand Russell.jpg|thumb|upright|The British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]]]
Logical positivism and [[scientism]] paved the way for [[neopositivism]], [[analytical philosophy]], [[structuralism]], and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[A.J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. Relatedly the [[Structural anthropology|applied structuralism]] of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J.N. Findlay]] and [[J.J.C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. Naturalists and materialistic monists such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.<ref name="stanford" /><ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=16}}</ref>

By contrast, in underdeveloped countries, there are virtually no atheists.<ref>Nigel Barber (2010).

The relationship between atheism and IQ, while statistically significant, is not a large one, and the reason for the relationship is not well understood.<ref name="VyseSI" />  One hypothesis is that the negative relationship between IQ and religiosity is mediated by individual differences in noncomformity; in many countries, religious belief is a conformist choice, and there is evidence that more intelligent people are less likely to conform.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rhodes |first1=Nancy |last2=Wood |first2=Wendy |title=Self-esteem and intelligence affect influenceability |journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=1992 |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=156–171 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.1.156}}</ref> Another theory is that people of higher IQ are more likely to engage in analytical reasoning, and that disbelief in religion results from the application of higher level analytical reasoning to the assessment of religious claims.<ref name="VyseSI" />

Evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber states that the reason atheists are more intelligent than religious people is better explained by social, environmental, and wealth factors which happen to correlate with loss of religious belief as well. He doubts that religion causes stupidity, noting that some highly intelligent people have also been religious, but he says it is plausible that higher intelligence correlates to rejection of improbable religious beliefs and that the situation between intelligence and rejection of religious beliefs is quite complex.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Barber |first1=Nigel |title=The Real Reason Atheists Have Higher IQs |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-human-beast/201005/the-real-reason-atheists-have-higher-iqs |website=Psychology Today |publisher=Sussex Publishers, LLC}}</ref> In a 2017 study, it was shown that compared to religious individuals, atheists have higher reasoning capacities and this difference seemed to be unrelated to sociodemographic factors such as age, education and country of origin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Daws |first1=Richard |last2=Hampshire |first2=Adam |title=The Negative Relationship between Reasoning and Religiosity Is Underpinned by a Bias for Intuitive Responses Specifically When Intuition and Logic Are in Conflict |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |date=19 December 2017 |volume=8 |issue=2191 |page=2191 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02191 |pmid=29312057 |pmc=5742220 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In a 2015 study, researchers found that atheists score higher on cognitive reflection tests than theists, the authors wrote that "The fact that atheists score higher agrees with the literature showing that belief is an automatic manifestation of the mind and its default mode.

The authors note that recently "it has been argued that analytic thinkers are not actually less religious; rather, the putative association may be a result of religiosity typically being measured after analytic thinking (an order effect)," however, they state "Our results indicate that the association between analytical thinking and religious disbelief is not caused by a simple order effect.

Statistically, atheists are held in poor regard across the globe. Non-atheists, and possibly even fellow atheists, seem to implicitly view atheists as prone to exhibit immoral behaviors ranging from mass murder to not paying at a restaurant.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Carey |first1=Benedict |title=The Serial Killer Test: Biases Against Atheists Emerge in Study |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/health/atheists-religion-study.html |access-date=January 23, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=August 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123190416/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/health/atheists-religion-study.html |archive-date=January 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Paris |first1=Agence France-Presse in |title=Atheists tend to be seen as immoral – even by other atheists: study |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/07/anti-atheist-prejudice-secularity |access-date=January 23, 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=August 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123190549/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/07/anti-atheist-prejudice-secularity |archive-date=January 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gervais |first1=Will M. |last2=Xygalatas |first2=Dimitris |last3=McKay |first3=Ryan T. |last4=van Elk |first4=Michiel |last5=Buchtel |first5=Emma E. |last6=Aveyard |first6=Mark |last7=Schiavone |first7=Sarah R. |last8=Dar-Nimrod |first8=Ilan |last9=Svedholm-Häkkinen |first9=Annika M. |last10=Riekki |first10=Tapani |last11=Klocová |first11=Eva Kundtová |last12=Ramsay |first12=Jonathan E. |last13=Bulbulia |first13=Joseph |title=Global evidence of extreme intuitive moral prejudice against atheists |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |date=August 7, 2017 |volume=1 |issue=8 |page=0151 |doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0151 |url=http://psyarxiv.com/csnp2/ |access-date=September 11, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118224040/https://psyarxiv.com/csnp2/ |archive-date=January 18, 2018 |url-status=live |hdl=10138/246517 |s2cid=45851307 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> In addition, according to a 2016 [[Pew Research Center]] publication, 15% of French people, 45% of Americans, and 99% of Indonesians explicitly believe that a person must believe in God to be moral.

<ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues">{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Van A. |title=Agnosticism and Atheism |postscript=,}} in {{harvnb|Flynn|2007|p=35}}: "The terms ''ATHEISM'' and ''AGNOSTICISM'' lend themselves to two different definitions. The first takes the privative ''a'' both before the Greek ''theos'' (divinity) and ''gnosis'' (to know) to mean that atheism is simply the absence of belief in the gods and agnosticism is simply lack of knowledge of some specified subject matter. The second definition takes atheism to mean the explicit denial of the existence of gods and agnosticism as the position of someone who, because the existence of gods is unknowable, suspends judgment regarding them&nbsp;... The first is the more inclusive and recognizes only two alternatives: Either one believes in the gods or one does not. Consequently, there is no third alternative, as those who call themselves agnostics sometimes claim. Insofar as they lack belief, they are really atheists. Moreover, since absence of belief is the cognitive position in which everyone is born, the burden of proof falls on those who advocate religious belief. The proponents of the second definition, by contrast, regard the first definition as too broad because it includes uninformed children along with aggressive and explicit atheists. Consequently, it is unlikely that the public will adopt it."</ref>
<ref name="eb2011-atheism">{{harvnb|Nielsen|2013}}: "Instead of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a God, a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for the following reasons&nbsp;... : for an anthropomorphic God, the atheist rejects belief in God because it is false or probably false that there is a God; for a nonanthropomorphic God&nbsp;... because the concept of such a God is either meaningless, unintelligible, contradictory, incomprehensible, or incoherent; for the God portrayed by some modern or contemporary theologians or philosophers&nbsp;... because the concept of God in question is such that it merely masks an atheistic substance—e.g., "God" is just another name for love, or&nbsp;... a symbolic term for moral ideals."</ref>

<ref name="eb1911-atheism">{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Atheism | quote = The term as generally used, however, is highly ambiguous. Its meaning varies (a) according to the various definitions of deity, and especially (b) according as it is (i.) deliberately adopted by a thinker as a description of his own theological standpoint, or (ii.) applied by one set of thinkers to their opponents. As to (a), it is obvious that atheism from the standpoint of the Christian is a very different conception as compared with atheism as understood by a Deist, a Positivist, a follower of Euhemerus or Herbert Spencer, or a Buddhist.}}</ref>
<ref name="eb1911-atheism-sceptical">{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Atheism | quote = But dogmatic atheism is rare compared with the sceptical type, which is identical with agnosticism in so far as it denies the capacity of the mind of man to form any conception of God, but is different from it in so far as the agnostic merely holds his judgment in suspense, though, in practice, agnosticism is apt to result in an attitude towards religion which is hardly distinguishable from a passive and unaggressive atheism.}}</ref>
<ref name="encyc-philosophy">{{harvnb|Edwards|2005}}: "On our definition, an 'atheist' is a person who rejects belief in God, regardless of whether or not his reason for the rejection is the claim that 'God exists' expresses a false proposition. People frequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for reasons other than that it is a false proposition. It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless. Sometimes, too, a theory is rejected on such grounds as that it is sterile or redundant or capricious, and there are many other considerations which in certain contexts are generally agreed to constitute good grounds for rejecting an assertion."</ref>

<ref name=RoweRoutledge>{{harvnb|Rowe|1998}}: "As commonly understood, atheism is the position that affirms the nonexistence of God. So an atheist is someone who disbelieves in God, whereas a theist is someone who believes in God. Another meaning of 'atheism' is simply nonbelief in the existence of God, rather than positive belief in the nonexistence of God.&nbsp;... an atheist, in the broader sense of the term, is someone who disbelieves in every form of deity, not just the God of traditional Western theology."</ref>
<!--ref name=extreme-secularism>{{harvnb|Zuckerman|2010}}: "A major source of these biases is the lack of clear definitions. Atheism and secularity are defined in opposition to religion, with atheism (the rejection of theism) often perceived as an extreme form of secularism (the decline of religious influence over society). But atheism is a narrow term referring to a specific belief (that there is no god), whereas secularism has various meanings, including a range of attitudes (such as religious indifference, doubt, agnosticism, and atheism) as as behaviors (such as lack of regular church attendance or disregard for traditional religious morality)."</ref-->
<ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails">{{harvnb|Martin|2006|p=2}}: "But agnosticism is compatible with negative atheism in that agnosticism ''entails'' negative atheism.

  Please note:
    The consensus since April 2007 has been to include all three of the definitions of atheism presented in the first paragraph below. They are the result of extensive debate and searches through existing sources – see, for example, the archived talkpage threads [[Talk:Atheism/Archive 27#A survey of definitions for atheism]] and [[Talk:Atheism/Archive 29#List of definitions]] – and formed part of the article when it achieved "Featured Article" status.

    Please, therefore, do not change the contents of the first paragraph without prior discussion on the talk page ([[Talk:Atheism]]), preferably after consulting at least these two threads. If you do make changes to the paragraph without prior discussion, be prepared to see them reverted as an invitation to discussion on the talk page (see [[Wikipedia:BRD]]).

The [[etymology|etymological]] root for the word ''atheism'' originated before the 5th century BCE from the ancient Greek {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}} (''atheos''), meaning "without god(s)".

<br />
Explicit strong/positive/hard atheists (in {{Font color|purple|'''purple'''}} on the '''right''') assert that ''"at least one deity exists"'' is a false statement.
<br />
Explicit weak/negative/soft atheists (in {{Font color|blue|'''blue'''}} on the '''right''') reject or eschew belief that any deities exist without actually asserting that ''"at least one deity exists"'' is a false statement.
<br />
Implicit weak/negative atheists (in {{Font color|blue|'''blue'''}} on the '''left'''), according to authors such as George H. Smith, would include people (such as young children and some agnostics) who do not believe in a deity but have not explicitly rejected such belief.

Writers disagree on how best to define and classify ''atheism'',<ref name="eb1911-atheism" /> contesting what supernatural entities are considered gods, whether it is a philosophic position in its own right or merely the absence of one, and whether it requires a conscious, explicit rejection. Atheism has been regarded as compatible with [[agnosticism]],<ref name="agnosticism-compatible" /><ref name="flint-agnostic-atheism" /><ref name="encyc-unbelief-compatible" /><ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails" /><ref name="barker-agnostic-atheism" /><ref name="besant-open-to-new-truth" /><ref name="holyoake-question-of-probability" /> but has also been contrasted with it.<ref name="eb2011-atheism-critique" /><ref name="eb2011concise-atheism" /><ref name="eb1911-atheism-sceptical" /> A variety of categories have been used to distinguish the different forms of atheism.

=== Range ===
Some of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining ''atheism'' arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for the definitions of words like ''deity'' and ''god''. The variety of wildly different [[conceptions of God]] and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. The ancient Romans accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping the [[paganism|pagan]] deities. Gradually, this view fell into disfavor as ''theism'' came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity.{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity, to the existence of any [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[supernatural]], or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] concepts, such as those of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Taoism]].<ref name="eb2011-Rejection-of-all-religious-beliefs" />

=== Implicit vs. explicit ===
{{Main|Implicit and explicit atheism}}
Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist. This broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, [[Baron d'Holbach]] said that "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God."<ref>{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P.H.T. |author-link=Baron d'Holbach |title=Good Sense |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7319 |year=1772 |access-date=April 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623131908/http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7319 |archive-date=June 23, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>
Similarly, [[George H. Smith]] (1979) suggested that: "The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist."<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=14}}.</ref>  ''Implicit atheism'' is "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it" and ''explicit atheism'' is the conscious rejection of belief.
For the purposes of his paper on "philosophical atheism", [[Ernest Nagel]] contested including the mere absence of theistic belief as a type of atheism.<ref name= Nagel1959>{{cite book |title=Basic Beliefs: The Religious Philosophies of Mankind |chapter=Philosophical Concepts of Atheism |first=Ernest |last=Nagel |author-link=Ernest Nagel |year=1959 |publisher=Sheridan House |quote=I must begin by stating what sense I am attaching to the word "atheism," and how I am construing the theme of this paper. I shall understand by "atheism" a critique and a denial of the major claims of all varieties of theism. &nbsp;... atheism is not to be identified with sheer unbelief, or with disbelief in some particular creed of a religious group. Thus, a child who has received no religious instruction and has never heard about God is not an atheist – for he is not denying any theistic claims. Similarly in the case of an adult who, if he has withdrawn from the faith of his father without reflection or because of frank indifference to any theological issue, is also not an atheist – for such an adult is not challenging theism and not professing any views on the subject. &nbsp;... I propose to examine some ''philosophic'' concepts of atheism&nbsp;...}}
<br />reprinted in ''Critiques of God'', edited by Peter A. Angeles, Prometheus Books, 1997.</ref> [[Graham Oppy]] classifies as ''innocents'' those who never considered the question because they lack any understanding of what a god is. According to Oppy, these could be [[Infant cognitive development|one-month-old babies]], humans with severe traumatic [[Brain injury|brain injuries]], or patients with [[dementia|advanced dementia]].{{sfn|Oppy|2018|p=4|ps=: Agnostics are distinguished from innocents, who also neither believe that there are gods nor believe that there are no gods, by the fact that they have given consideration to the question of whether there are gods. Innocents are those who have never considered the question of whether there are gods. Typically, innocents have never considered the question of whether there are gods because they are not able to consider that question. How could that be? Well, in order to consider the question of whether there are gods, one must understand what it would mean for something to be a god. That is, one needs to have the concept of a god. Those who lack the concept of a god are not able to entertain the thought that there are gods. Consider, for example, one-month-old babies. It is very plausible that one-month-old babies lack the concept of a god. So it is very plausible that one-month-old babies are innocents. Other plausible cases of innocents include chimpanzees, human beings who have suffered severe traumatic brain injuries, and human beings with advanced dementia}}

{{Main|Negative and positive atheism}}
Philosophers such as [[Antony Flew]]<ref name="presumption">{{harvnb|Flew|1976|pp=14ff}}: "In this interpretation, an atheist becomes: not someone who positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist. Let us, for future-ready reference, introduce the labels 'positive atheist' for the former and 'negative atheist' for the latter."</ref>
and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]]{{sfn|Martin|2006}} have contrasted positive (strong/hard) atheism with negative (weak/soft) atheism. Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Negative atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist.
The terms ''weak'' and ''strong'' are relatively recent, while the terms ''negative'' and ''positive'' atheism are of older origin, having been used (in slightly different ways) in the philosophical literature<ref name="presumption" /> and in Catholic apologetics.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |title=On the Meaning of Contemporary Atheism |journal=The Review of Politics |first=Jacques |last=Maritain |date=July 1949 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=267–280 |doi=10.1017/S0034670500044168 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113062053/http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |archive-date=November 13, 2005}}</ref>
Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.

While Martin, for example, asserts that [[agnosticism]] [[logical consequence|entails]] negative atheism,<ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails" /> many agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism,<ref name=Kenny2006 /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/omar-baddar/why-im-not-an-atheist-the-case-for-agnosticism_b_3345544.html |title=Why I'm Not an Atheist: The Case for Agnosticism |date=May 28, 2013 |publisher=Huffington Post |access-date=November 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209105433/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/omar-baddar/why-im-not-an-atheist-the-case-for-agnosticism_b_3345544.html |archive-date=December 9, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The assertion of unattainability of knowledge for or against the existence of gods is sometimes seen as an indication that atheism requires a [[leap of faith]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Many atheists I know would be certain of a high place in heaven |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |last=O'Brien |first=Breda |author-link=Breda O'Brien |work=Irish Times |access-date=April 9, 2011 |date=July 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520132651/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |archive-date=May 20, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Warner |first=Matthew |url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/matthew-warner/more-faith-to-be-an-atheist-than-a-christian |title=More faith to be an atheist than a Christian |date=June 8, 2012 |access-date=November 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603062347/http://www.ncregister.com/blog/matthew-warner/more-faith-to-be-an-atheist-than-a-christian |archive-date=June 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>
Common atheist responses to this argument include that unproven ''[[faith#Faith in world religions|religious]]'' propositions deserve as much disbelief as all ''other'' unproven propositions,<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|pp=30–34}}. "Who seriously claims we should say 'I neither believe nor disbelieve that the Pope is a robot', or 'As to whether or not eating this piece of chocolate will turn me into an elephant I am completely agnostic'. In the absence of any good reasons to believe these outlandish claims, we rightly disbelieve them, we don't just suspend judgement."</ref>
and that the unprovability of a god's existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=22}}. "A lack of proof is no grounds for the suspension of belief. This is because when we have a lack of absolute proof we can still have overwhelming evidence or one explanation which is far superior to the alternatives."</ref>
Australian philosopher [[J.J.C. Smart]] even argues that "sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalized [[philosophical skepticism]] which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever, except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic."<ref name="stanford">{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/ |title=Atheism and Agnosticism |first=J.C.C. |last=Smart |date=March 9, 2004 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=April 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/654hYPmzk?url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/ |archive-date=January 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>
Consequently, some atheist authors such as [[Richard Dawkins]] prefer distinguishing theist, agnostic and atheist positions along a [[spectrum of theistic probability]]—the likelihood that each assigns to the statement "God exists".{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=50}}

=== Definition as impossible or impermanent ===

Before the 18th century, the existence of God was so accepted in the Western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called ''theistic [[innatism]]''—the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cudworth |first=Ralph |author-link=Ralph Cudworth |title=The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the first part, wherein all the reason and philosophy of atheism is confuted and its impossibility demonstrated |year=1678}}</ref>

There is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis, that atheists make [[deathbed conversion]]s, or that "[[there are no atheists in foxholes]]".<ref>See, for example: {{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/ohair090896.htm |title=Atheist Group Moves Ahead Without O'Hair |first=Sue Anne |last=Pressley |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=September 8, 1996 |access-date=October 22, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008044601/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/ohair090896.htm |archive-date=October 8, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>
There have, however, been examples to the contrary, among them examples of literal "atheists in foxholes".<ref>{{cite web |last=Lowder |first=Jeffery Jay |year=1997 |title=Atheism and Society |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html |access-date=April 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522025011/http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html |archive-date=May 22, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Some atheists have challenged the need for the term "atheism". In his book ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] wrote:
<blockquote>In fact, "atheism" is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a "non-[[Astrology|astrologer]]" or a "non-[[Alchemy|alchemist]]". We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=ypyMZlkgHGIC&pg=PA51&dq=%22No+one+ever+needs+to+identify+himself+as+a+%22non-astrologer%22%22or+a%22%22non-alchemist%22 51]}}</blockquote>

Pragmatic atheism is the view one should reject a belief in a god or gods because it is unnecessary for a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] life.

== Arguments ==
[[File:D'Holbach.jpg|thumb|[[Baron d'Holbach|Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach]], an 18th-century advocate of atheism.
<br />&nbsp;<br />
"The source of man's unhappiness is his ignorance of Nature. The pertinacity with which he clings to blind opinions imbibed in his infancy, which interweave themselves with his existence, the consequent prejudice that warps his mind, that prevents its expansion, that renders him the slave of fiction, appears to doom him to continual error."<ref>Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, ''System of Nature; or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World'' (London, 1797), Vol. 1, p. 25</ref>]]

=== Epistemological arguments ===
{{Further|Agnostic atheism|Theological noncognitivism}}
Atheists have also argued that people cannot know a God or prove the existence of a God. The latter is called agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. [[Skepticism]], based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists. Hume, however, held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as "sophistry and illusion".<ref name="hume-metaphysics" /> The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.<ref name="Zdybicka-p20">{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}.</ref>

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or [[ontology|ontological]], including  [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A.J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.<ref>[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998). "[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GW3XHMxP?url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html |date=10 May 2013 }}".

In a footnote, Ayer attributes this view to "Professor H.H. Price".</ref>

=== Metaphysical arguments ===
{{Further|Monism|Physicalism}}
Philosopher, [[Zofia Zdybicka]] writes:
{{quote|"Metaphysical atheism&nbsp;... includes all doctrines that hold to metaphysical monism (the homogeneity of reality). Metaphysical atheism may be either: a) absolute — an explicit denial of God's existence associated with materialistic monism (all materialistic trends, both in ancient and modern times); b) relative — the implicit denial of God in all philosophies that, while they accept the existence of an absolute, conceive of the absolute as not possessing any of the attributes proper to God: transcendence, a personal character or unity. Relative atheism is associated with idealistic monism (pantheism, panentheism, deism)."<ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=19}}.</ref>}}

[[File:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|left|[[Epicurus]] is credited with first expounding the [[problem of evil]]. [[David Hume]] in his ''[[Dialogues concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) cited Epicurus in stating the argument as a series of questions:{{sfn|Hume|1779}}
"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"]]

=== Logical arguments ===

Philosopher [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]<ref>Feuerbach, Ludwig (1841) ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]''</ref>
and psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] have argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs, or a projection mechanism from the 'Id' omnipotence; for [[Vladimir Lenin]], in 'Materialism and Empirio-criticism', against the [[Russian Machism]], the followers of [[Ernst Mach]], Feuerbach was the final argument against belief in a god. This is also a view of many [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].<ref>Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught.'' Grove Press, 1974. pp. 51–52.</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class. According to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], "the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory, and practice." He reversed [[Voltaire]]'s aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him, writing instead that "if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |title=God and the State |last=Bakunin |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Bakunin |year=1916 |publisher=New York: Mother Earth Publishing Association |access-date=April 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521195435/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |archive-date=May 21, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Atheistic philosophies ==
{{Further|Atheist existentialism|Secular humanism}}
[[Axiology|Axiological]], or constructive, atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a "higher absolute", such as [[Human nature|humanity]]. This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God. Marx and Freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation, full-development, and unfettered happiness.<ref name="Zdybicka-p20" /> One of the most common [[criticism of atheism|criticisms of atheism]] has been to the contrary: that denying the existence of a god either leads to [[moral relativism]] and leaves one with no moral or ethical foundation,<ref name="misconceptions">{{cite web |url=http://articles.exchristian.net/2006/12/common-misconceptions-about-atheists.html |title=Common Misconceptions About Atheists and Atheism |last=Gleeson |first=David |date=August 10, 2006 |access-date=November 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001241/http://articles.exchristian.net/2006/12/common-misconceptions-about-atheists.html |archive-date=December 31, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> or renders life [[meaning of life (religious)|meaningless]] and miserable.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}.

''[[Pensées]]'', II: "The Misery of Man Without God".</ref>

French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] identified himself as a representative of an "[[atheist existentialism]]"{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
concerned less with denying the existence of God than with establishing that "man needs&nbsp;... to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself, not even a valid proof of the existence of God."{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=45}}
Sartre said a corollary of his atheism was that "if God does not exist, there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence, a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept, and&nbsp;... this being is man."{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
The practical consequence of this atheism was described by Sartre as meaning that there are no ''a priori rules'' or absolute values that can be invoked to govern human conduct, and that humans are "condemned" to invent these for themselves, making "man" absolutely "responsible for everything he does".{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=32}}

The strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity; as such, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the [[moral universalism]] of [[humanism]], which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to [[moral nihilism]], which holds that morality is meaningless.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|pp=21–22}}</ref> Atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Chakravarti |first=Sitansu |title=Hinduism, a way of life |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1991 |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_-rASTgw8wC&pg=PA71 |isbn=978-81-208-0899-7 |quote=According to Hinduism, the path of the atheist is very difficult to follow in matters of spirituality, though it is a valid one. |access-date=April 9, 2011}}</ref>

=== Divine command ===
According to Plato's [[Euthyphro dilemma]], the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary. [[Divine command theory|The argument that morality must be derived from God]], and cannot exist without a wise creator, has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Among the many myths associated with religion, none is more widespread {{sic}} – or more disastrous in its effects — than the myth that moral values cannot be divorced from the belief in a god."</ref><ref>In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (Book Eleven: ''Brother Ivan Fyodorovich'', Chapter 4) there is the famous argument that ''If there is no God, all things are permitted.'': "'But what will become of men then?' I asked him, 'without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?'"</ref><ref name="Kant CPR A811">For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was a practical concern, for "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams&nbsp;..." (''Critique of Pure Reason'', A811).</ref>
Moral precepts such as "murder is wrong" are seen as [[divine law]]s, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a [[false analogy]], and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=38}}</ref>

(among others) assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience. Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern, for example, that "thou shalt steal" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it—and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.<ref>{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=43}}</ref>

The 19th-century German political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx called religion "the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]". He goes on to say, "The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo."<ref>Marx, K. 1976.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Ephesians 2,12 - Greek atheos.jpg|thumb|left|The Greek word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}} (''atheoi''), as it appears in the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|2:12}}) on the early 3rd-century [[Papyrus 46]]. It is usually translated into English as "[those who are] without God".<ref>The word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}}—in any of its forms—appears nowhere else in the [[Septuagint]] or the [[New Testament]]. {{cite book |last=Robertson |first=A.T. |title=Word Pictures in the New Testament |orig-year=1932 |year=1960 |publisher=Broadman Press |chapter=Ephesians: Chapter 2 |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/r/robertson_at/wordpictures/htm/EPH2.RWP.html |quote=Old Greek word, not in LXX, only here in N.T.

In early [[ancient Greek]], the adjective ''{{Transl|grc|átheos}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}}, from the [[privative a|privative ἀ-]] + {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θεός|θεός]]}} "god") meant "godless". It was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning "ungodly" or "impious". In the 5th century BCE, the word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in the sense of "severing relations with the gods" or "denying the gods". The term [[:wikt:ἀσεβής|ἀσεβής]] (''{{Transl|grc|asebēs}}'') then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods, even if they believed in other gods. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ''{{Transl|grc|átheos}}'' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἀθεότης|ἀθεότης]]}} (''{{Transl|grc|atheotēs}}''), "atheism". [[Cicero]] transliterated the Greek word into the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:atheos#Latin|átheos]]}}''. The term found frequent use in the debate between [[early Christianity|early Christians]] and [[Ancient Greek religion|Hellenists]], with each side attributing it, in the pejorative sense, to the other.<ref name=drachmann>{{cite book |last=Drachmann |first=A.B. |title=Atheism in Pagan Antiquity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cguq-yNii_QC&q=Atheism+in+Pagan+Antiquity |publisher=Chicago: Ares Publishers |year=1977 |orig-year=1922 |isbn=978-0-89005-201-3 |quote=Atheism and atheist are words formed from Greek roots and with Greek derivative endings.

In exactly the same way as ungodly, ''{{Transl |grc |átheos}}'' was used as an expression of severe censure and moral condemnation; this use is an old one, and the oldest that can be traced.

''Atheism'' was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic god]].<ref name="adevism">In part because of its wide use in monotheistic Western society, ''atheism'' is usually described as "disbelief in God", rather than more generally as "disbelief in deities". A clear distinction is rarely drawn in modern writings between these two definitions, but some archaic uses of ''atheism'' encompassed only disbelief in the singular God, not in [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities. It is on this basis that the obsolete term ''[[adevism]]'' was coined in the late 19th century to describe an absence of belief in plural deities.</ref>
In the 20th century, [[globalization]] contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities, though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as simply "disbelief in God".{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

The thoroughly materialistic and anti-theistic philosophical [[Cārvāka]] (or ''Lokāyata'') school that originated in [[India]] around the 6th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India, similar to the Greek [[Cyrenaic school]]. This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as [[nastika|heterodox]] due to its rejection of the authority of [[Vedas]] and hence is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.<ref>Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A.

=== Early Middle Ages to the Renaissance ===
During the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Islamic world]] experienced a [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]]. Along with advances in science and philosophy, Arab and Persian lands produced outspoken rationalists and atheists, including [[Muhammad al Warraq]] (fl. 9th century), [[Ibn al-Rawandi]] (827–911), [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Al-Razi]] (854–925), and [[Al-Maʿarri]] (973–1058). Al-Ma'arri wrote and taught that religion itself was a "fable invented by the ancients"<ref name="Nicholson318">Reynold Alleyne Nicholson, 1962, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', p. 318. Routledge</ref> and that humans were "of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains."<ref>[http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html Freethought Traditions in the Islamic World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214102422/http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html |date=February 14, 2012 }} by Fred Whitehead; also quoted in Cyril Glasse, (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 278.

In Europe, the espousal of atheistic views was rare during the Early Middle Ages and [[Middle Ages]] (see [[Medieval Inquisition]]); [[metaphysics]] and theology were the dominant interests pertaining to religion.<ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4">{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=4}}</ref> There were, however, movements within this period that furthered heterodox conceptions of the Christian god, including differing views of the nature, transcendence, and knowability of God. Individuals and groups such as [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], [[David of Dinant]], [[Amalric of Bena]], and the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] maintained Christian viewpoints with [[pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies. [[Nicholas of Cusa]] held to a form of [[fideism]] he called ''[[De Docta Ignorantia|docta ignorantia]]'' ("learned ignorance"), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and thus our knowledge of him is limited to conjecture. [[William of Ockham]] inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his [[nominalism|nominalistic]] limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine [[essence]] could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as [[John of Mirecourt]] and [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] furthered this view. The resulting division between [[Faith and rationality|faith and reason]] influenced later radical and reformist theologians such as [[John Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus]], and [[Martin Luther]].<ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4" />

The [[Renaissance]] did much to expand the scope of free thought and skeptical inquiry. Individuals such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought experimentation as a means of explanation, and opposed [[Appeal to authority|arguments from religious authority]]. Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Bonaventure des Périers]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], and [[François Rabelais]].<ref name="gordonstein" />

=== Early modern period ===
Historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church, which in turn "quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches".<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p. 388</ref> [[Deism]] gained influence in France, Prussia, and England. The philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] was "probably the first well known 'semi-atheist' to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era", according to Blainey. Spinoza believed that natural laws explained the workings of the universe. In 1661 he published his ''Short Treatise on God''.<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p. 343</ref>

[[Criticism of Christianity]] became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious [[malaise]], according to contemporary sources. Some Protestant thinkers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences, while Spinoza rejected [[divine providence]] in favor of a [[panentheistic]] naturalism. By the late 17th century, deism came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as [[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]] who coined the term "pantheist".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pantheism |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=November 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223113/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pantheism |archive-date=December 2, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The philosopher [[David Hume]] developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in [[empiricism]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy has strongly questioned the very possibility of a metaphysical knowledge. Both philosophers undermined the metaphysical basis of natural theology and criticized classical [[arguments for the existence of God]].

[[File:Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) would greatly influence philosophers such as [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[David Strauss]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Max Stirner]]. He considered God to be a human invention and religious activities to be wish-fulfillment. For this he is considered the founding father of modern [[anthropology of religion]].]]
Blainey notes that, although [[Voltaire]] is widely considered to have strongly contributed to atheistic thinking during the Revolution, he also considered fear of God to have discouraged further disorder, having said "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.&nbsp;390–391</ref> In ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), the philosopher [[Edmund Burke]] denounced atheism, writing of a "literary cabal" who had "some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the Christian religion. This object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety&nbsp;... These atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own&nbsp;...". But, Burke asserted, "man is by his constitution a religious animal" and "atheism is against, not only our reason, but our instincts; and&nbsp;... it cannot prevail long".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/reflections-on-the-revolution-in-france/ |title=Reflections on the Revolution in France |website=adelaide.edu.au |access-date=November 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203033011/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/reflections-on-the-revolution-in-france/ |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Baron d'Holbach]] was a prominent figure in the [[French Enlightenment]] who is best known for his atheism and for his voluminous writings against religion, the most famous of them being ''[[The System of Nature]]'' (1770) but also ''[[Christianity Unveiled]]''. One goal of the [[French Revolution]] was a restructuring and subordination of the clergy with respect to the state through the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Attempts to enforce it led to [[anticlericalism|anti-clerical]] violence and the expulsion of many clergy from France, lasting until the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]. The radical [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] seized power in 1793, ushering in the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Jacobins were deists and introduced the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] as a new French state religion. Some atheists surrounding [[Jacques Hébert]] instead sought to establish a [[Cult of Reason]], a form of atheistic pseudo-religion with a goddess personifying reason. The [[Napoleonic era]] further institutionalized the secularization of French society.

In the latter half of the 19th century, atheism rose to prominence under the influence of [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] philosophers. Many prominent German philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion, including [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BKz2FcDrFy0C&pg=PA1 |title=Subjectivity and Irreligion: Atheism and Agnosticism in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |last=Ray |first=Matthew Alun |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7546-3456-0 |access-date=April 9, 2011}}</ref>

Atheism, particularly in the form of practical atheism, advanced in many societies in the 20th century.

[[File:Honourable Bertrand Russell.jpg|thumb|upright|The British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]]]
Logical positivism and [[scientism]] paved the way for [[neopositivism]], [[analytical philosophy]], [[structuralism]], and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[A.J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. Relatedly the [[Structural anthropology|applied structuralism]] of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J.N. Findlay]] and [[J.J.C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. Naturalists and materialistic monists such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.<ref name="stanford" /><ref>{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=16}}</ref>

By contrast, in underdeveloped countries, there are virtually no atheists.<ref>Nigel Barber (2010).

The relationship between atheism and IQ, while statistically significant, is not a large one, and the reason for the relationship is not well understood.<ref name="VyseSI" />  One hypothesis is that the negative relationship between IQ and religiosity is mediated by individual differences in noncomformity; in many countries, religious belief is a conformist choice, and there is evidence that more intelligent people are less likely to conform.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rhodes |first1=Nancy |last2=Wood |first2=Wendy |title=Self-esteem and intelligence affect influenceability |journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=1992 |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=156–171 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.1.156}}</ref> Another theory is that people of higher IQ are more likely to engage in analytical reasoning, and that disbelief in religion results from the application of higher level analytical reasoning to the assessment of religious claims.<ref name="VyseSI" />

Evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber states that the reason atheists are more intelligent than religious people is better explained by social, environmental, and wealth factors which happen to correlate with loss of religious belief as well. He doubts that religion causes stupidity, noting that some highly intelligent people have also been religious, but he says it is plausible that higher intelligence correlates to rejection of improbable religious beliefs and that the situation between intelligence and rejection of religious beliefs is quite complex.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Barber |first1=Nigel |title=The Real Reason Atheists Have Higher IQs |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-human-beast/201005/the-real-reason-atheists-have-higher-iqs |website=Psychology Today |publisher=Sussex Publishers, LLC}}</ref> In a 2017 study, it was shown that compared to religious individuals, atheists have higher reasoning capacities and this difference seemed to be unrelated to sociodemographic factors such as age, education and country of origin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Daws |first1=Richard |last2=Hampshire |first2=Adam |title=The Negative Relationship between Reasoning and Religiosity Is Underpinned by a Bias for Intuitive Responses Specifically When Intuition and Logic Are in Conflict |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |date=19 December 2017 |volume=8 |issue=2191 |page=2191 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02191 |pmid=29312057 |pmc=5742220 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In a 2015 study, researchers found that atheists score higher on cognitive reflection tests than theists, the authors wrote that "The fact that atheists score higher agrees with the literature showing that belief is an automatic manifestation of the mind and its default mode.

The authors note that recently "it has been argued that analytic thinkers are not actually less religious; rather, the putative association may be a result of religiosity typically being measured after analytic thinking (an order effect)," however, they state "Our results indicate that the association between analytical thinking and religious disbelief is not caused by a simple order effect.

<ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues">{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Van A. |title=Agnosticism and Atheism |postscript=,}} in {{harvnb|Flynn|2007|p=35}}: "The terms ''ATHEISM'' and ''AGNOSTICISM'' lend themselves to two different definitions. The first takes the privative ''a'' both before the Greek ''theos'' (divinity) and ''gnosis'' (to know) to mean that atheism is simply the absence of belief in the gods and agnosticism is simply lack of knowledge of some specified subject matter. The second definition takes atheism to mean the explicit denial of the existence of gods and agnosticism as the position of someone who, because the existence of gods is unknowable, suspends judgment regarding them&nbsp;... The first is the more inclusive and recognizes only two alternatives: Either one believes in the gods or one does not. Consequently, there is no third alternative, as those who call themselves agnostics sometimes claim. Insofar as they lack belief, they are really atheists. Moreover, since absence of belief is the cognitive position in which everyone is born, the burden of proof falls on those who advocate religious belief. The proponents of the second definition, by contrast, regard the first definition as too broad because it includes uninformed children along with aggressive and explicit atheists. Consequently, it is unlikely that the public will adopt it."</ref>
<ref name="eb2011-atheism">{{harvnb|Nielsen|2013}}: "Instead of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a God, a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for the following reasons&nbsp;... : for an anthropomorphic God, the atheist rejects belief in God because it is false or probably false that there is a God; for a nonanthropomorphic God&nbsp;... because the concept of such a God is either meaningless, unintelligible, contradictory, incomprehensible, or incoherent; for the God portrayed by some modern or contemporary theologians or philosophers&nbsp;... because the concept of God in question is such that it merely masks an atheistic substance—e.g., "God" is just another name for love, or&nbsp;... a symbolic term for moral ideals."</ref>

As to (a), it is obvious that atheism from the standpoint of the Christian is a very different conception as compared with atheism as understood by a Deist, a Positivist, a follower of Euhemerus or Herbert Spencer, or a Buddhist.}}</ref>

People frequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for reasons other than that it is a false proposition. It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless. Sometimes, too, a theory is rejected on such grounds as that it is sterile or redundant or capricious, and there are many other considerations which in certain contexts are generally agreed to constitute good grounds for rejecting an assertion."</ref>
