'''Blasphemy Day''', also known as '''International Blasphemy Day''' or '''International Blasphemy Rights Day''', educates individuals and groups about [[blasphemy law]]s and defends [[freedom of expression]], especially the open [[criticism of religion]] which is criminalized in many countries. Blasphemy Day was introduced as a worldwide celebration by the [[Center for Inquiry]] in 2009.<ref name="CFI"/>

Events worldwide on the first annual Blasphemy Day in 2009 included an art exhibit in [[Washington, D.C.]] and a [[free speech]] festival in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=USAT/>

== Origins ==
Blasphemy Day is celebrated on September 30 to coincide with the anniversary of the 2005 publication of satirical drawings of [[Muhammad]] in one of [[Denmark]]'s newspapers, resulting in the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy]]. Although the caricatures of Muhammad caused some controversy within Denmark, especially among Muslims, it became a widespread furor after Muslim [[imam]]s in several countries stirred up violent protests in which Danish embassies were firebombed and over 100 people killed (counting the deaths from police opening fire on protesters).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6247329/International-blasphemy-day-from-Danish-cartoons-to-Jerry-Springer-The-Opera.html |title= International blasphemy day: from Danish cartoons to Jerry Springer |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=London |first=Tom |last=Chivers |date=30 September 2009}}</ref> The idea to observe an International Blasphemy Rights Day originated in 2009.
