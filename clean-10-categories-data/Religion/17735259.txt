The '''Convent of the Holy Family''' in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] was the first [[convent]] in the United States for black women.<ref>Southern, pg. 132</ref> It was co-founded by three women: [[Henriette DeLille]], Juliette Gaudin, and Josephine Charles.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sisters of the Holy Family|url = http://www.sistersoftheholyfamily.com/|website = www.sistersoftheholyfamily.com|accessdate = 2015-10-05}}</ref> The Convent would go on to operate a home for elderly or infirm women, a home for orphans and other charitable work.<ref>King, pg. 336</ref>

Sisters at the convent renewed their vows every year for the first ten years, after which the vows became perpetual.<ref>King, pg. 334</ref>

The Convent's first facility was an unassuming structure on Bayou street, but the Sisters soon moved to a new site, originally the ballroom attached to the [[Théâtre d'Orléans|Orleans Theater]].<ref>[http://nutrias.org/exhibits/french/theatre.htm Que La Fete Commence]</ref>
