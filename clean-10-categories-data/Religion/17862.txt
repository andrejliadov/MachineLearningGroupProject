'''Lafayette Ronald Hubbard''' (March 13, 1911&nbsp;– January 24, 1986) was an American author of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] stories who founded the [[Church of Scientology]]. In 1950, Hubbard authored ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' and established a series of organizations to promote [[Dianetics]]. In 1952, Hubbard lost the rights to Dianetics in bankruptcy proceedings, and he subsequently founded Scientology. Thereafter Hubbard oversaw the growth of the Church of Scientology into a worldwide organization.

Born in [[Tilden, Nebraska]], in 1911, Hubbard spent much of his childhood in [[Helena, Montana]]. After his father was posted to the U.S. naval base on [[Guam]], Hubbard traveled to Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s. In 1930, Hubbard enrolled at [[George Washington University]] to study civil engineering but dropped out in his second year. He began his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories and married [[Margaret Grubb|Margaret "Polly" Grubb]], who shared his interest in aviation.

Hubbard was an officer in the Navy during [[World War II]], where he briefly commanded two ships but was removed from command both times. The last few months of his active service were spent in a hospital, being treated for a variety of complaints.

Scientology became increasingly controversial during the 1960s and came under intense media, government and legal pressure in a number of countries. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hubbard spent much of his time at sea on his personal fleet of ships as "[[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]]" of the [[Sea Organization]], an elite quasi-paramilitary group of Scientologists.

Hubbard returned to the United States in 1975 and went into seclusion in the [[California]] desert after an [[Project Normandy|unsuccessful attempt to take over the town]] of [[Clearwater, Florida]]. In 1978, Hubbard was convicted of fraud after he was tried [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] by France. In the same year, eleven high-ranking members of Scientology were indicted on 28 charges for their role in the Church's [[Snow White Program]], a systematic program of espionage against the United States government. One of the indicted was Hubbard's wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard]], who was in charge of the program; L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard was named an unindicted co-conspirator.

Hubbard spent the remaining years of his life in seclusion in a luxury motorhome on a ranch in California, attended to by a small group of Scientology officials. He died at age 74 in January 1986. Following Hubbard's death, Scientology leaders announced that his body had become an impediment to his work and that he had decided to "drop his body" to continue his research on another plane of existence. Though many of Hubbard's autobiographical statements have been found to be fictitious, the Church of Scientology describes Hubbard in [[hagiography|hagiographic]] terms and rejects any suggestion that its account of Hubbard's life is not historical fact.

In April 1927, Hubbard's father was posted to Guam, and that summer, Hubbard and his mother traveled to Guam with a brief stop-over in a couple of Chinese ports. He recorded his impressions of the places he visited and disdained the poverty of the inhabitants of Japan and China, whom he described as "[[gook]]s" and "lazy [and] ignorant".<ref name="Atack-54">Atack, p. 54</ref><ref name="Miller-31">Miller, p. 31</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Lewis |first=James R. |title=Scientology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0195331493 |location=New York, NY}}</ref>

In September 1929, Hubbard was enrolled at the Swavely Preparatory School in [[Manassas, Virginia]], to prepare him for a second attempt at the examination.<ref name="Miller-45">Miller, p. 45</ref> During his first semester at Swevely, Hubbard complained of eye strain and was diagnosed with [[myopia]]; this diagnosis precluded any enrollment in the Naval Academy.<ref name="ReferenceA" /><ref name="Miller-46">Miller, p. 46</ref> As an adult, Hubbard would write to himself: "Your eyes are getting progressively better.

He successfully graduated from the school in June 1930 and entered the University the following September.<ref name="Miller-47">Miller, p. 47</ref><ref name="ReferenceA" />

==University education and Caribbean trip==

During what would become Hubbard's final semester at GWU, he organized an ill-fated trip to the Caribbean for June 1932 to explore and film the pirate "strongholds and bivouacs of the [[Spanish Main]]" and to "collect whatever one collects for exhibits in museums".<ref name="Miller=52">Miller, p. 52</ref> Amid multiple misfortunes and running low on funds, the ship's owners ordered it to return to Baltimore.<ref name="Miller=55">Miller, p. 55</ref> Hubbard failed to return to University the following year.<ref name="Atack-63">Atack, p. 63</ref>

After his father volunteered him for a [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] relief effort, on October 23, 1932 Hubbard traveled to Puerto Rico.<ref name="Miller=56">Miller, p. 56</ref> En route, Hubbard apparently "decided to abandon the Red Cross", instead opting to accompany a mineral surveyor in a futile bid to find gold.<ref name="Atack-63" />

In the spring of 1936 they moved to [[Bremerton, Washington]]. They lived there for a time with Hubbard's aunts and grandmother before finding a place of their own at nearby [[South Colby, Washington|South Colby]].

===Dental procedure, near-death experience, and ''Excalibur''===
{{main|Excalibur (L. Ron Hubbard)}}

In April 1938, Hubbard reportedly underwent a dental procedure and reacted to the drug used in the procedure. According to his account, this triggered a revelatory [[near-death experience]]. Allegedly inspired by this experience, Hubbard composed a manuscript, which was never published, with working titles of ''The One Command'' or ''Excalibur''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=January 24, 2013 |title='Going Clear': A New Book Delves Into Scientology |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/24/170010096/going-clear-a-new-book-delves-into-scientology |website=NPR.org}}</ref><ref name="lermanet.com">{{Cite web |title=The History of Excalibur |url=http://www.lermanet.com/excalibur/ |website=lermanet.com}}</ref>

[[Arthur J. Burks]], who read the work in 1938, later recalled it discussed the "one command": to survive. This theme would be revisited in ''Dianetics''. Burks also recalled the work discussing the psychology of a lynch mob.<ref name="Burks">{{Cite web |last=Burks |first=Arthur J. |date=December 1961 |title=Yes, There Was A Book Called "Excalibur" By L. Ron Hubbard |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/burks.html |website=The Aberee}}</ref> Hubbard would later cite ''Excalibur'' as an early version of ''Dianetics''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ortega |first=Tony |date=October 23, 2014 |title=L. Ron Hubbard explains to a friend the real reason he wrote ''Dianetics'' |url=http://tonyortega.org/2014/10/23/l-ron-hubbard-explains-to-a-friend-the-real-reason-he-wrote-dianetics/}}</ref>

According to Burks, Hubbard believed that ''Excalibur'' would "revolutionize everything" and that "it was somewhat more important, and would have a greater impact upon people, than the [[Bible]]."<ref name="Burks" /> According to Burks, Hubbard "was so sure he had something 'away out and beyond' anything else that he had sent telegrams to several book publishers, telling them that he had written 'THE book' and that they were to meet him at [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], and he would discuss it with them and go with whomever [sic] gave him the best offer." However, nobody bought the manuscript.<ref name="Burks" />

Hubbard's failure to sell ''Excalibur'' depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: "Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name. So you see I've got to do something about it and at the same time strengthen the old financial position."<ref name="Letter-1938">Letter from L. Ron Hubbard, October 1938, quoted in Miller, p. 81</ref> He went on:

{{quote|Sooner or later ''Excalibur'' will be published and I may have a chance to get some name recognition out of it so as to pave the way to articles and comments which are my ideas of writing heaven&nbsp;... Foolishly perhaps, but determined none the less, I have high hopes of smashing my name into history so violently that it will take a legendary form even if all books are destroyed. That goal is the real goal as far as I am concerned.<ref name="Letter-1938" />}}

[[Forrest J Ackerman]]<!-- N.B. NO PERIOD AFTER THE J -->, later Hubbard's [[literary agent]], recalled that Hubbard told him "whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that the last time he had shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window."<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhl2bE-1LiA&t=8m29s Ackerman, Forrest J (November 19, 1997) ''Secret Lives: L. Ron Hubbard''], Channel 4 Television.</ref>
In 1948, Hubbard would tell a convention of science fiction fans that ''Excalibur''{{'s}} inspiration came during an operation in which he "died" for eight minutes.<ref>Gardner, p. 272</ref>

{{quote|Hubbard realized that, while he was dead, he had received a tremendous inspiration, a great Message which he must impart to others. He sat at his typewriter for six days and nights and nothing came out. Then, ''Excalibur'' emerged.<ref name="Malko=40">Malko, p. 40</ref>}}

The manuscript later became part of Scientology mythology.<ref name="Atack-66">Atack, p. 66</ref> An early 1950s Scientology publication offered signed "gold-bound and locked" copies for the sum of $1,500 apiece ({{Inflation|US|1500|1950|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}). It warned that "four of the first fifteen people who read it went insane" and that it would be "[r]eleased only on sworn statement not to permit other readers to read it. Contains data not to be released during Mr. Hubbard's stay on earth."<ref>Quoted in Malko, p. 39</ref>

===Alaska trip===
[[File:Ketchikan AK.jpg|thumb|alt=Buildings visible at a shoreline with forest above|Ketchikan, Alaska, where Hubbard and his wife were stranded during the "Alaskan Radio-Experimental Expedition"]]
Hubbard joined [[The Explorers Club]] in February 1940 on the strength of his claimed explorations in the Caribbean and survey flights in the United States.<ref name="Miller-85">Miller, p. 85</ref> He persuaded the club to let him carry its flag on an "Alaskan Radio-Experimental Expedition".<ref name="Miller-88">Miller, p. 88</ref> The crew consisted of Hubbard and his wife aboard his [[ketch]] ''Magician''.<ref name="Miller-89">Miller, p. 89</ref>

The trip was plagued by problems and did not get any further than [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]].<ref name="Atack-68">Atack, p. 68</ref> The ship's engine broke down only two days after setting off in July 1940. Having underestimated the cost of the trip, he did not have enough money to repair the broken engine. He raised money by writing stories and contributing to the local radio station<ref name="Miller-91">Miller, p. 91</ref> and eventually earned enough to fix the engine,<ref name="Miller-85" /> making it back to Puget Sound on December 27, 1940.<ref name="Miller-91" />

==Military career==
{{Main|Military career of L. Ron Hubbard}}
[[File:Hubbard and moulton.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Two men in naval uniform|Hubbard and Thomas&nbsp;S. Moulton in 1943]]
After returning from Alaska, Hubbard applied to join the [[United States Navy]]. His friend [[Robert MacDonald Ford]], by now a State Representative for Washington, sent a letter of recommendation describing Hubbard as "one of the most brilliant men I have ever known".{{uncited quote|date=June 2020}} Ford later said that Hubbard had written the letter himself: "I don't know why Ron wanted a letter. I just gave him a letter-head and said, 'Hell, you're the writer, you write it!'"<ref name="Miller-93">Miller, p.&nbsp;93.</ref>

Hubbard was commissioned as a [[lieutenant junior grade]] in the [[United States Naval Reserve]] on July&nbsp;19, 1941. By November, he was posted to New York for training as an intelligence officer.<ref name="Miller-97">Miller, p.&nbsp;97.</ref> On December&nbsp;18, he was posted to the Philippines and set out for the posting via Australia. While in Melbourne awaiting transport to Manilla, Hubbard was sent back to the United States. The U.S. naval attaché reported, "This officer is not satisfactory for independent duty assignment. He is garrulous and tries to give impressions of his importance. He also seems to think he has unusual ability in most lines. These characteristics indicate that he will require close supervision for satisfactory performance of any intelligence duty."<ref name="cmu.edu2">{{Cite web |title=Bare-Faced Messiah: Chapter 6 |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/miller/bfm06.htm |website=www.cs.cmu.edu}}</ref>

After a brief stint censoring cables, Hubbard's request for sea duty was approved and he reported to a [[Neponset, Massachusetts]], shipyard which was converting a trawler into a gunboat to be classified as {{USS|YP-422}}. On September&nbsp;25, 1942, the commandant of [[Boston Navy Yard]] informed Washington that, in his view, Hubbard was "not temperamentally fitted for independent command."<ref>{{cite book|last=Atack|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Atack|title=[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/pieceofblueskysc00atac/page/74 74]|publisher=Carol Publishing Group|year=1990|isbn=0-8184-0499-X}}</ref>   Days later, on October&nbsp;1, Hubbard was summarily relieved of his command.<ref name="cmu.edu2" /> 
 
Hubbard was sent to submarine chaser training, and in 1943 was posted to Portland, Oregon, to take command of a submarine chaser, the {{USS|PC-815}}, which was under construction.<ref name="SW-Creating" /> On May&nbsp;18, ''PC-815'' sailed on her shakedown cruise, bound for San Diego. Only five hours into the voyage, Hubbard believed he had detected an enemy submarine. Hubbard spent the next 68 hours engaged in combat, until finally receiving orders to return to Astoria. Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher]], commander of the [[Northwest Sea Frontier]], concluded: "An analysis of all reports convinces me that there was no submarine in the area."<ref>"Battle Report – Submission of.", A16-3(3)/PC815, Vice Adm. Frank Jack Fletcher, Commander NW Sea Frontier, 8 June 1943; [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Batconcl.gif Image of document]</ref> Fletcher suggested Hubbard had mistaken a "known magnetic deposit" for an enemy sub.<ref name="cmu.edu2" />

The following month, Hubbard unwittingly sailed ''PC-815'' into Mexican territorial waters and conducted gunnery practice off the [[Coronado Islands]], in the belief that they were uninhabited and belonged to the United States. The Mexican government complained and Hubbard was relieved of command. A report written after the incident rated Hubbard as unsuitable for independent duties and "lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation".{{uncited quote|date=June 2020}} The report recommended he be assigned "duty on a large vessel where he can be properly supervised".<ref name="Miller-107">Miller, p.&nbsp;107.</ref>

===Hospitalizations and "discovery" of sabotage attempt===
[[File:Uss pc-815 1.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Naval ship moving forward in water|{{USS|PC-815}}, Hubbard's second and final command]]
After being relieved of command of ''PC-815'', Hubbard began reporting sick, citing a variety of ailments, including ulcers, malaria, and back pains. Hubbard was admitted to the San Diego naval hospital for observation—he would remain there for nearly three months.<ref name="cmu.edu2" /> Years later, Hubbard would privately write to himself: "Your stomach trouble you used as an excuse to keep the Navy from punishing you. You are free of the Navy."<ref name="Wright53">Wright, p. 53</ref>

In 1944, Hubbard was posted to Portland where {{USS|Algol|AKA-54|6}} was under construction. The ship was commissioned in July and Hubbard served as the navigation and training officer. Hubbard requested, and was granted, a transfer to the School of Military Government in Princeton. The night before his departure, the ship's log reports that "The Navigating Officer [Hubbard] reported to the OOD [Officer On Duty] that an attempt at sabatage [sic] had been made sometime between 1530–1600. A coke bottle filled with gasoline with a cloth wick inserted had been concealed among cargo which was to be hoisted aboard and stored in No&nbsp;1 hold. It was discovered before being taken on board. ONI, FBI and NSD authorities reported on the scene and investigations were started."<ref>Atack, p. 81; Streeter, p. 208</ref><ref name="cmu.edu2" />

Hubbard attended school in Princeton until January&nbsp;1945, when he was assigned to [[Monterey, California]]. In April, he again reported sick and was re-admitted to [[Oak Knoll Naval Hospital]], Oakland.<ref name="cmu.edu2" /> His complaints included "headaches, rheumatism, conjunctivitis, pains in his side, stomach aches, pains in his shoulder, arthritis, hemorrhoids".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bare-Faced Messiah: Chapter 7 |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/miller/bfm07.htm |website=www.cs.cmu.edu}}</ref> An October 1945 naval board found that Hubbard was "considered physically qualified to perform duty ashore, preferably within the continental United States".<ref name="Atack-84">Atack, p. 84</ref> He was discharged from the hospital on December&nbsp;4, 1945, and transferred to inactive duty on February&nbsp;17, 1946.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Hubbard would ultimately resign his commission after the publication of ''Dianetics'', with effect from October&nbsp;30, 1950.<ref name="sppulitzer" />

==Occult involvement in Pasadena==

[[File:JackParsons3.jpg|right|thumb|Jack Parsons in 1938]]
Hubbard's life underwent a turbulent period immediately after the war. According to his own account, he "was abandoned by family and friends as a supposedly hopeless cripple and a probable burden upon them for the rest of my days".<ref name="My Philosophy">Hubbard, L. Ron. "[http://www.ronthephilosopher.org/phlspher/page84.htm My Philosophy]," Church of Scientology International, 1965, retrieved February 17, 2011.</ref> His daughter Katherine presented a rather different version: his wife had refused to uproot their children from their home in Bremerton, Washington, to join him in California. Their marriage was by now in terminal difficulties and he chose to stay in California.<ref name="Miller-116">Miller, p. 125</ref>

In August 1945 Hubbard moved into the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] mansion of [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)|John "Jack" Whiteside Parsons]]. A leading [[rocket propulsion]] researcher at the [[California Institute of Technology]] and a founder of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], Parsons led a double life as an avid [[occultism|occultist]] and [[Thelema|Thelemite]], follower of the English ceremonial magician [[Aleister Crowley]] and leader of a lodge of Crowley's [[magical order]], [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (OTO).<ref name="Wright" /><ref name="Miller-113">Miller, p. 113</ref> He let rooms in the house only to tenants who he specified should be "atheists and those of a Bohemian disposition".<ref name="Miller-114">Miller, p. 114</ref>

Hubbard befriended Parsons and soon became sexually involved with Parsons's 21-year-old girlfriend, [[Sara Northrup Hollister|Sara "Betty" Northrup]].<ref name="Miller-117">Miller, p. 117</ref> Despite this Parsons was very impressed with Hubbard and reported to Crowley:

{{quote|[Hubbard] is a gentleman; he has red hair, green eyes, is honest and intelligent, and we have become great friends. He moved in with me about two months ago, and although Betty and I are still friendly, she has transferred her sexual affection to Ron. Although he has no formal training in Magick, he has an extraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the field. From some of his experiences I deduced that he is in direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his [[Holy Guardian Angel|Guardian Angel]]. He describes his Angel as a beautiful winged woman with red hair whom he calls the Empress and who has guided him through his life and saved him many times. He is the most [[Thelema|Thelemic]] person I have ever met and is in complete accord with our own principles.<ref name="Symonds">Quoted in Symonds, John. ''The Great Beast: the life and magick of Aleister Crowley'', p. 392. London: Macdonald and Co., 1971. {{ISBN|0-356-03631-6}}</ref>}}

Hubbard, whom Parsons referred to in writing as "Frater H",<ref name="Martin1989">{{Cite book |last=Stoddard Martin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPcbAAAAMAAJ |title=Orthodox Heresy: The Rise of 'magic' As Religion and Its Relation to Literature |publisher=Macmillan Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-333-43540-3 |page=195}}</ref> became an enthusiastic collaborator in the Pasadena OTO. The two men collaborated on the "[[Babalon Working]]", a [[sex magic]] ritual intended to summon an incarnation of [[Babalon]], the supreme Thelemite Goddess. It was undertaken over several nights in February and March 1946 in order to summon an "elemental" who would participate in further sex magic.<ref name="Urban">Urban, Hugh B.

Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-520-24776-5}}</ref> As [[Richard Metzger]] describes it,

{{quote|Parsons used his "magical wand" to whip up a vortex of energy so the elemental would be summoned. Translated into plain English, Parsons [[masturbation|jerked off]] in the name of spiritual advancement whilst Hubbard (referred to as "The Scribe" in the diary of the event) scanned the astral plane for signs and visions.<ref>[[Richard Metzger|Metzger, Richard]]. ''Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult'', p. 200. New York: [[The Disinformation Company]], 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-9713942-7-8}}</ref>}}

The "elemental" arrived a few days later in the form of [[Marjorie Cameron]], who agreed to participate in Parsons's rites.<ref name="Urban" /> Soon afterwards, Parsons, Hubbard and Sara agreed to set up a business partnership, "Allied Enterprises", in which they invested nearly their entire savings—the vast majority contributed by Parsons. The plan was for Hubbard and Sara to buy yachts in [[Miami]] and sail them to the West Coast to sell for a profit. Hubbard had a different idea; he wrote to the U.S. Navy requesting permission to leave the country "to visit Central & South America & China" for the purposes of "collecting writing material"—in other words, undertaking a world cruise.<ref name="Pendle-268">Pendle, p. 268</ref> Aleister Crowley strongly criticized Parsons's actions, writing: "Suspect Ron playing confidence trick—Jack Parsons weak fool—obvious victim prowling swindlers." Parsons attempted to recover his money by obtaining an injunction to prevent Hubbard and Sara leaving the country or disposing of the remnants of his assets.<ref name="Pendle-269">Pendle, p. 269</ref> They attempted to sail anyway but were forced back to port by a storm. A week later, Allied Enterprises was dissolved. Parsons received only a $2,900 promissory note from Hubbard and returned home "shattered". He had to sell his mansion to developers soon afterwards to recoup his losses.<ref name="Pendle-270">Pendle, p. 270</ref>
[[File:L Ron and Sara Hubbard June 1946.jpg|right|thumb|Hubbard and second wife Sara]]
Hubbard's fellow writers were well aware of what had happened between him and Parsons. [[L. Sprague de Camp]] wrote to [[Isaac Asimov]] on August 27, 1946, to tell him:

{{quote|The more complete story of Hubbard is that he is now in Fla. living on his yacht with a man-eating tigress named Betty-alias-Sarah, another of the same kind&nbsp;... He will probably soon thereafter arrive in these parts with Betty-Sarah, broke, working the poor-wounded-veteran racket for all its worth, and looking for another easy mark. Don't say you haven't been warned. Bob <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Robert Heinlein]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> thinks Ron went to pieces morally as a result of the war. I think that's fertilizer, that he always was that way, but when he wanted to conciliate or get something from somebody he could put on a good charm act. What the war did was to wear him down to where he no longer bothers with the act.<ref name="Pendle-271">De Camp, L. Sprague, letter of August 26, 1946. Quoted by Pendle, p. 271</ref>}}

On August 10, 1946, Hubbard [[bigamy|bigamously]] married Sara, while still married to Polly. It was not until 1947 that his first wife learned that he had remarried. Hubbard agreed to divorce Polly in June that year and the marriage was dissolved shortly afterwards, with Polly given custody of the children.<ref name="Miller-134">Miller, p. 134</ref>

During this period, Hubbard authored a document which has called the "[[Affirmations (L. Ron Hubbard)|Affirmations]]" (also referred to as the "Admissions"). They consist of a series of statements by and addressed to Hubbard, relating to various physical, sexual, psychological and social issues that he was encountering in his life. The Affirmations appear to have been intended to be used as a form of self-hypnosis with the intention of resolving the author's psychological problems and instilling a positive mental attitude. In [[Inside Scientology: The Story of America's Most Secretive Religion|her book]], Reitman called the Affirmations "the most revealing psychological self-assessment, complete with exhortations to himself, that [Hubbard] had ever made."<ref name="Reitman20">Reitman, p. 20</ref> Among the Affirmations:
* "Your eyes are getting progressively better. They became bad when you used them as an excuse to escape the naval academy. You have no reason to keep them bad."
* "Your stomach trouble you used as an excuse to keep the Navy from punishing you. You are free of the Navy."
* "Your hip is a pose. You have a sound hip. It never hurts. Your shoulder never hurts."
* "Your foot was an alibi. The injury is no longer needed."<ref name="Wright53" />
* "You can tell all the romantic tales you wish. ... But you know which ones were lies ... You have enough real experience to make anecdotes forever. Stick to your true adventures."
* "Masturbation does not injure or make insane. Your parents were in error. Everyone masturbates."<ref name="Wright53-4">Wright, p. 53-4</ref>

==Request for psychiatric treatment==
{{see also|L. Ron Hubbard and psychiatry|Scientology and psychiatry}}
After Hubbard's wedding to Sara, the couple settled at [[Laguna Beach, California]], where Hubbard took a short-term job looking after a friend's yacht{{Hairspace}}<ref name="Miller-132">Miller, p. 132</ref> before resuming his fiction writing to supplement the small disability allowance that he was receiving as a war veteran.<ref name="Streeter-210">Streeter, p. 210</ref> Working from a trailer in a run-down area of [[North Hollywood]],<ref name="Miller-134" /> Hubbard sold a number of science fiction stories that included his ''[[Ole Doc Methuselah]]'' series and the serialized novels ''The End Is Not Yet'' and ''[[To the Stars (novel)|To the Stars]]''.<ref name="Stableford" /> However, he remained short of money and his son, L. Ron Hubbard Jr, testified later that Hubbard was dependent on his own father and Margaret's parents for money and his writings, which he was paid at a penny per word, never garnered him any more than $10,000 prior to the founding of Scientology.<ref>{{YouTube|elFdBCldOz4}}</ref> He repeatedly wrote to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]] (VA) asking for an increase in his war pension.<ref>Miller, pp. 125, 128, 131</ref>

In October 1947 he wrote to request psychiatric treatment:

{{quote|After trying and failing for two years to regain my equilibrium in civil life, I am utterly unable to approach anything like my own competence. My last physician informed me that it might be very helpful if I were to be examined and perhaps treated psychiatrically or even by a psychoanalyst. Toward the end of my service I avoided out of pride any mental examinations, hoping that time would balance a mind which I had every reason to suppose was seriously affected. I cannot account for nor rise above long periods of moroseness and suicidal inclinations, and have newly come to realize that I must first triumph above this before I can hope to rehabilitate myself at all.  ...  I cannot, myself, afford such treatment.  <br /> Would you please help me?<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron, letter to Veterans Administration, October 15, 1947; quoted in Miller, p. 137</ref>}}

The VA eventually did increase his pension,<ref name="Miller-139">Miller, p. 139</ref> but his money problems continued. On August 31, 1948, he was arrested in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], and subsequently pleaded guilty to a charge of petty theft, for which he was ordered to pay a $25 fine ({{Inflation|US|25|1948|fmt=eq}}).<ref name="Miller-142">Miller, p. 142</ref>

==Dianetics==
===Origin===
In 1948, Hubbard and his second wife Sara moved from California to Savannah, Georgia, where he would later claim to have worked as a volunteer lay practitioner in a local psychiatric clinic. In letters to friends, he began to make the first public mentions of what was to become Dianetics.<ref>Miller, p. 143</ref>

He wrote in January 1949 that he was working on a "book of psychology" about "the cause and cure of nervous tension", which he was going to call ''The Dark Sword'', ''Excalibur'' or ''Science of the Mind''.<ref>Miller, p. 144</ref> On March 8, 1949, Hubbard wrote to friend and fellow science-fiction author [[Robert Heinlein]] from Savannah, Georgia. Hubbard referenced Heinlein's earlier work [[Coventry (short story)|Coventry]], in which a utopian government has the ability to psychologically "cure" criminals of violent personality traits. He told Heinlein: 
{{quote|Well, you didn't specify in your book what actual reformation took place in the society to make supermen. Got to thinking about it other day. The system is [[Excalibur (L. Ron Hubbard)|Excalibur]]. It makes [[The World of Null-A|nul A's]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ortega |first=Tony |date=November 8, 2014 |title=The Heinlein Letters: What L.

His first published articles in Dianetics were "Terra Incognita: The Mind" in ''[[The Explorers Journal]]'' and another one that impacted people more heavily in ''Astounding Science Fiction''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Melton |first=J. Gordon |url=https://archive.org/details/churchofscientol00meltrich |title=The Church of Scientology |publisher=Signature Books |year=2000 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

In April 1949, Hubbard wrote to several professional organizations to offer his research.<ref>One such letter can be found on the Church of Scientology's official L. Ron Hubbard website. See "[http://dianetics.lronhubbard.org/page14.htm Letters from the Birth of Dianetics]," Church of Scientology International, 2004, retrieved February 8, 2011.</ref> None were interested, so he turned to his editor John W. Campbell, who was more receptive due to a long-standing fascination with fringe psychologies and psychic powers ("[[psionics]]") that "permeated both his fiction and non-fiction".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Luckhurst |first=Roger |title=Science Fiction |publisher=Polity |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7456-2893-6 |location=Malden, MA |page=74}}</ref>

Campbell invited Hubbard and Sara to move into a cottage at [[Bay Head, New Jersey]], not far from his own home at [[Plainfield, New Jersey|Plainfield]]. In July 1949, Campbell recruited an acquaintance, Dr. Joseph Winter, to help develop Hubbard's new therapy of "Dianetics". Campbell told Winter:

{{quote|With cooperation from some institutions, some psychiatrists, [Hubbard] has worked on all types of cases. Institutionalized schizophrenics, apathies, manics, depressives, perverts, stuttering, neuroses—in all, nearly 1000 cases. But just a brief sampling of each type; he doesn't have proper statistics in the usual sense. But he has one statistic. He has cured every patient he worked with. He has cured ulcers, arthritis, asthma.<ref name="Miller-149">Miller, p. 149</ref><!-- verbatim quote: do not alter -->}}

Hubbard collaborated with Campbell and Winter to refine his techniques,<ref name="Atack-106">Atack, p. 106</ref> testing them on science fiction fans recruited by Campbell.<ref name="Miller-150">Miller, p. 150</ref> The basic principle of Dianetics was that the brain recorded every experience and event in a person's life, even when unconscious. Bad or painful experiences were stored as what he called [[Engram (Dianetics)|"engrams"]] in a "[[reactive mind]]". These could be triggered later in life, causing emotional and physical problems. By carrying out a process he called [[Auditing (Scientology)|"auditing"]], a person could be regressed through his engrams to re-experiencing past experiences. This enabled engrams to be "cleared". The subject, who would now be in a state of [[Clear (Scientology)|"Clear"]], would have a perfectly functioning mind with an improved IQ and photographic memory.<ref>Streeter, pp. 210–211</ref> The "Clear" would be cured of physical ailments ranging from poor eyesight to the common cold,<ref name="Atack-108">Atack, p. 108</ref> which Hubbard asserted were purely [[psychosomatic]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Miller |first=Timothy |url=https://archive.org/details/americasalternat00mill |title=America's Alternative Religions |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-7914-2398-1 |location=Albany |pages=[https://archive.org/details/americasalternat00mill/page/385 385–386] |oclc=30476551 |url-access=registration}}</ref>

Winter submitted a paper on Dianetics to the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' and the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' but both journals rejected it.<ref name="Winter-18">Winter, p. 18</ref> Hubbard and his collaborators decided to announce Dianetics in Campbell's ''Astounding Science Fiction'' instead. In an editorial, Campbell said: "Its power is almost unbelievable; it proves the mind not only can but does rule the body completely; following the sharply defined basic laws set forth, physical ills such as ulcers, asthma and arthritis can be cured, as can all other psychosomatic ills."<ref name="Miller-145">Quoted in Miller, p. 145</ref> The birth of Hubbard's second daughter Alexis Valerie, delivered by Winter on March 8, 1950, came in the middle of the preparations to launch Dianetics. Shortly afterwards in April 1950, a "Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation" was established in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], with Hubbard, Sara, Winter and Campbell on the board of directors.<ref name="Miller-152">Miller, p. 152</ref>

Hubbard described Dianetics as "the hidden source of all psychosomatic ills and human aberration" when he introduced Dianetics to the world in the 1950s. He further claimed that "skills have been developed for their invariable cure."<ref>{{Cite news |title=The TIME Vault: December 22, 1952 |url=http://time.com/vault/issue/1952-12-22/page/36/ |access-date=July 25, 2016}}</ref> Dianetics was duly launched in ''Astounding's'' May 1950 issue and on May 9, Hubbard's companion book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' was published<ref name="Atack-107">Atack, p. 107</ref> by Hermitage House. Hubbard abandoned freelance writing in order to promote Dianetics, writing several books about it in the next decade and delivering an estimated 4,000 lectures while founding Dianetics research organizations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=L.

===Initial success===
{{Main|History of Dianetics}}
[[File:L. Ron Hubbard conducting Dianetics seminar in Los Angeles in 1950.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A mostly seated crowd watches as Hubbard, seated on a chair, speaks to a woman lying prone in front of him.|Hubbard conducting a Dianetics seminar in Los Angeles, 1950]]
Dianetics was an immediate commercial success and sparked what [[Martin Gardner]] calls "a nationwide cult of incredible proportions".<ref name="Gardner-265">Gardner, p. 265</ref> By August 1950, Hubbard's book had sold 55,000 copies, was selling at the rate of 4,000 a week and was being translated into French, German and Japanese. Five hundred Dianetic auditing groups had been set up across the United States.<ref name="Newsweek-Dianetics">Staff (August 21, 1950). "Dianetics book review; Best Seller." ''Newsweek''</ref>

Dianetics was poorly received by the press and the scientific and medical professions.<ref name="Newsweek-Dianetics" /> The [[American Psychological Association]] criticized Hubbard's claims as "not supported by empirical evidence".<ref name="Maisel">Maisel, Albert (December 5, 1950). "Dianetics&nbsp;— Science or Hoax?" ''Look'' magazine, p. 79</ref> ''[[Scientific American]]'' said that Hubbard's book contained "more promises and less evidence per page than any publication since the invention of printing",<ref>Rabi, Isaac Isador. "Book Review." ''Scientific American'', January 1951</ref> while ''[[The New Republic]]'' called it a "bold and immodest mixture of complete nonsense and perfectly reasonable common sense, taken from long acknowledged findings and disguised and distorted by a crazy, newly invented terminology".<ref>Gumpert, Martin. (August 14, 1950) "''Dianetics'': book review by Martin Gumpert." ''The New Republic''</ref> Some of Hubbard's fellow science fiction writers also criticized it; [[Isaac Asimov]] considered it "gibberish"<ref name="Asimov" /> while [[Jack Williamson]] called it "a lunatic revision of Freudian psychology".<ref name="Miller-153">Miller, p. 153</ref>

Several famous individuals became involved with Dianetics. [[Aldous Huxley]] received auditing from Hubbard;<ref name="Atack-115">Atack, p. 113</ref> the poet [[Jean Toomer]]<ref>Kerman, Cynthia Earl; Eldridge, Richard. ''The lives of Jean Toomer: a hunger for wholeness'', pp. 317–318. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-8071-1548-0}}</ref> and the science fiction writers [[Theodore Sturgeon]]<ref>Sturgeon, Theodore; Williams, Paul. ''Baby is three'', p. 414. Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic Books, 1999. {{ISBN|978-1-55643-319-1}}</ref> and [[A. E. van Vogt]] became trained Dianetics auditors. Van Vogt temporarily abandoned writing and became the head of the newly established Los Angeles branch of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation. Other branches were established in New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Honolulu.<ref name="Miller-166" /><ref>Melton, p. 190</ref>

Although Dianetics was not cheap, a great many people were nonetheless willing to pay; van Vogt later recalled "doing little but tear open envelopes and pull out $500 checks from people who wanted to take an auditor's course".<ref name="Miller-166">Miller, p. 166</ref> Financial controls were lax. Hubbard himself took large sums with no explanation of what he was doing with it. On one occasion, van Vogt saw Hubbard taking a lump sum of $56,000 ({{inflation|US|56000|1950|r=-4|fmt=eq}}) out of the Los Angeles Foundation's proceeds.<ref name="Miller-166" /> One of Hubbard's employees, Helen O'Brien, commented that at the Elizabeth, N.J. branch of the Foundation, the books showed that "a month's income of $90,000 is listed, with only $20,000 accounted for".<ref name="OBrien-27">O'Brien, p. 27</ref>

Hubbard played a very active role in the Dianetics boom, writing, lecturing and training auditors. Many of those who knew him spoke of being impressed by his personal [[charisma]]. Jack Horner, who became a Dianetics auditor in 1950, later said, "He was very impressive, dedicated and amusing. The man had tremendous charisma; you just wanted to hear every word he had to say and listen for any pearl of wisdom."<ref>Miller, pp. 159–160</ref> Isaac Asimov recalled in his autobiography how, at a dinner party, he, Robert Heinlein, L. Sprague de Camp and their wives "all sat as quietly as pussycats and listened to Hubbard. He told tales with perfect aplomb and in complete paragraphs."<ref name="Asimov" /> As Atack comments, he was "a charismatic figure who compelled the devotion of those around him".<ref>Atack, p. 377</ref> [[Christopher Evans (computer scientist)|Christopher Evans]] described the personal qualities that Hubbard brought to Dianetics and Scientology:

{{quote|He undoubtedly has charisma, a magnetic lure of an indefinable kind which makes him the centre of attraction in any kind of gathering. He is also a compulsive talker and pontificator&nbsp;... His restless energy keeps him on the go throughout a long day—he is a poor sleeper and rises very early—and provides part of the drive which has allowed him to found and propagate a major international organization.<ref>Evans, p. 26</ref>}}

===Collapse of Dianetics Foundation and subsequent kidnappings===

Dianetics lost public credibility in August 1950 when a presentation by Hubbard before an audience of 6,000 at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles failed disastrously.<ref name="Whitehead-67">Whitehead, p. 67</ref> He introduced a Clear named Sonya Bianca and told the audience that as a result of undergoing Dianetic therapy she now possessed perfect recall. However, Gardner writes, "in the demonstration that followed, she failed to remember a single formula in physics (the subject in which she was majoring) or the color of Hubbard's tie when his back was turned. At this point, a large part of the audience got up and left."<ref name="Gardner-270">Gardner, p. 270</ref>

Hubbard's supporters soon began to have doubts about Dianetics. Winter became disillusioned, and in 1951, he wrote that he had never seen a single convincing Clear: "I have seen some individuals who are supposed to have been 'clear,' but their behavior does not conform to the definition of the state. Moreover, an individual supposed to have been 'clear' has undergone a relapse into conduct which suggests an incipient psychosis."<ref name="Winter-34">Winter, p. 34</ref> He also deplored the Foundation's omission of any serious scientific research.<ref name="Miller-169">Miller, p. 169</ref>

Hubbard also faced other practitioners moving into leadership positions within the Dianetics community. It was structured as an open, public practice in which others were free to pursue their own lines of research and claim that their approaches to auditing produced better results than Hubbard's.<ref>Stark, Rodney; Bainbridge, William Sims. ''The future of religion: secularization, revival, and cult formation'', pp. 268–269. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986. {{ISBN|978-0-520-05731-9}}</ref> The community rapidly splintered and its members mingled Hubbard's ideas with a wide variety of [[Esotericism|esoteric]] and occult practices.<ref name="Marshall-186">Marshall, Gordon. ''In praise of sociology'', p. 186. London: Routledge, 1990. {{ISBN|978-0-04-445688-9}}</ref>

By late 1950, the Elizabeth, N.J. Foundation was in financial crisis and the Los Angeles Foundation was more than $200,000 in debt ({{Inflation|US|200000|1959|fmt=eq|cursign=$|r=−4}}).<ref name="Miller-173">Miller, p. 173</ref> Winter and Art Ceppos, the publisher of Hubbard's book, resigned under acrimonious circumstances.<ref name="Atack-115" /> Campbell also resigned, criticizing Hubbard for being impossible to work with, and blamed him for the disorganization and financial ruin of the Foundations.<ref name="Miller-181" /> By the summer of 1951, the Elizabeth, N.J. Foundation and all of its branches had closed.<ref name="OBrien-27" />

The collapse of Hubbard's marriage to Sara created yet more problems. He had begun an affair with his 20-year-old public relations assistant in late 1950, while Sara started a relationship with Dianetics auditor Miles Hollister.<ref name="Miller-199">Miller, p. 170</ref> Hubbard secretly denounced the couple to the [[FBI]] in March 1951, portraying them in a letter as [[communism|communist]] infiltrators. According to Hubbard, Sara was "currently intimate with [communists] but evidently under coercion. Drug addiction set in fall 1950. Nothing of this known to me until a few weeks ago." Hollister was described as having a "sharp chin, broad forehead, rather Slavic". He was said to be the "center of most turbulence in our organization" and "active and dangerous".<ref name="Miller-180">Miller, p. 180</ref> The FBI did not take Hubbard seriously: an agent annotated his correspondence with the comment, "Appears mental."<ref name="Methvin" />

Three weeks later, Hubbard and two Foundation staff seized Sara and his year-old daughter Alexis and forcibly took them to [[San Bernardino, California]], where he attempted unsuccessfully to find a doctor to examine Sara and declare her insane.<ref name="Atack-117">Atack, p. 117</ref> He let Sara go but took Alexis to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. Sara filed a divorce suit on April 23, 1951, that accused him of marrying her [[bigamy|bigamously]] and subjecting her to [[sleep deprivation]], beatings, [[strangulation]], kidnapping and exhortations to commit suicide.<ref>Martin, Walter Ralston; Zacharias, Ravi K.

Dianetics appeared to be on the edge of total collapse. However, it was saved by Don Purcell, a millionaire businessman and Dianeticist who agreed to support a new Foundation in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. Their collaboration ended after less than a year when they fell out over the future direction of Dianetics.<ref name="Streissguth-71">Streissguth, p. 71</ref> The Wichita Foundation became financially nonviable after a court ruled that it was liable for the unpaid debts of its defunct predecessor in Elizabeth, N.J. The ruling prompted Purcell and the other directors of the Wichita Foundation to file for voluntary bankruptcy in February 1952.<ref name="Miller-199" /> Hubbard resigned immediately and accused Purcell of having been bribed by the [[American Medical Association]] to destroy Dianetics.<ref name="Streissguth-71" /> Hubbard established a "Hubbard College" on the other side of town where he continued to promote Dianetics while fighting Purcell in the courts over the Foundation's intellectual property.<ref name="Miller-200">Miller, p. 200</ref>

Only six weeks after setting up the Hubbard College and marrying a staff member, 18-year-old [[Mary Sue Whipp]], Hubbard closed it down and moved with his new bride to [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. He established a [[Hubbard Association of Scientologists|Hubbard Association of Scientologists International]] to promote his new "Science of Certainty"—Scientology.<ref name="Atack-129">Atack, p. 129</ref> Scientology and Dianetics have been differentiated as follows: Dianetics is all about releasing the mind from the "distorting influence of engrams", and Scientology "is the study and handling of the spirit in relation to itself, universes and other life".<ref name="Mccall 2007 437–47">{{Cite journal |last=Mccall |first=W.

The Church of Scientology attributes its genesis to Hubbard's discovery of "a new line of research"—"that man is most fundamentally a spiritual being (a [[thetan]])".<ref>"[http://mediaresources.lronhubbard.org/chronicle/page04.htm L.

Hubbard expanded upon the basics of Dianetics to construct a spiritually oriented (though at this stage not religious) [[doctrine]] based on the concept that the true self of a person was a thetan—an immortal, omniscient and potentially omnipotent entity.<ref name="dechant">DeChant, Dell; Danny L.

Hubbard introduced a device called an [[E-meter]] that he presented as having, as Miller puts it, "an almost mystical power to reveal an individual's innermost thoughts".<ref name="Miller-204">Miller, p. 204</ref> He promulgated Scientology through a series of lectures, bulletins and books such as ''[[Scientology: A History of Man|A History of Man]]'' ("a cold-blooded and factual account of your last sixty trillion years")<ref name="Miller-204" /> and ''Scientology: 8-8008'' ("With this book, the ability to make one's body old or young at will, the ability to heal the ill without physical contact, the ability to cure the insane and the incapacitated, is set forth for the physician, the layman, the mathematician and the physicist.")<ref name="Miller-206">Miller, p. 206</ref>

Scientology was organized in a very different way from the decentralized Dianetics movement. The Hubbard Association of Scientologists (HAS) was the only official Scientology organization. Training procedures and doctrines were standardized and promoted through HAS publications, and administrators and auditors were not permitted to deviate from Hubbard's approach.<ref name="Marshall-186" /> Branches or "orgs" were organized as franchises, rather like a [[fast food restaurant]] chain. Each franchise holder was required to pay ten percent of income to Hubbard's central organization. They were expected to find new recruits, known as "raw meat", but were restricted to providing only basic services. Costlier higher-level auditing was only provided by Hubbard's central organization.<ref>Tucker, p. 304</ref>

Although this model would eventually be extremely successful, Scientology was a very small-scale movement at first. Hubbard started off with only a few dozen followers, generally dedicated Dianeticists; a seventy-hour series of lectures in [[Philadelphia]] in December 1952 was attended by just 38 people.<ref name="Miller-210">Miller, p. 210</ref> Hubbard was joined in Phoenix by his 18-year-old son Nibs, who had been unable to settle down in high school.<ref>Miller, p. 207</ref> Nibs had decided to become a Scientologist, moved into his father's home and went on to become a Scientology staff member and "professor".<ref>Miller, p. 232</ref> Hubbard also traveled to the United Kingdom to establish his control over a Dianetics group in [[London]]. It was very much a shoestring operation; as Helen O'Brien later recalled, "there was an atmosphere of extreme poverty and undertones of a grim conspiracy over all. At 163 [[Holland Park Avenue]] was an ill-lit lecture room and a bare-boarded and poky office some eight by ten feet—mainly infested by long haired men and short haired and tatty women."<ref>O'Brien, p. 49</ref> On September 24, 1952, only a few weeks after arriving in London, Hubbard's wife Mary Sue gave birth to her first child, a daughter whom they named Diana Meredith de Wolfe Hubbard.<ref name="Miller-208">Miller, p. 208</ref>

In February 1953, Hubbard acquired a doctorate from the [[educational accreditation|unaccredited]] [[degree mill]] called [[Sequoia University]].<ref name="Miller-212">Miller, p. 212</ref>

As membership declined and finances grew tighter, Hubbard had reversed the hostility to religion he voiced in ''Dianetics''.<ref name="creation">Kent, Stephen A. "The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology." ''Religious Studies and Theology'' '''18''':2, pp. 97–126. 1999. {{ISSN|1747-5414}}</ref> A few weeks after becoming "Dr." Hubbard, he authored a letter outlining plans for transforming Scientology into a religion. In that letter, Hubbard proposed setting up a chain of "Spiritual Guidance Centers" charging customers $500 for twenty-four hours of auditing proposing that Scientology should be transformed into a religion:<ref>Streeter, p. 215; Miller, p. 213</ref>

{{quote|We don't want a clinic. We want one in operation but not in name. Perhaps we could call it a Spiritual Guidance Center. Think up its name, will you. And we could put in nice desks and our boys in neat blue with diplomas on the walls and 1. knock psychotherapy into history and 2. make enough money to shine up my operating scope and 3. keep the HAS solvent. It is a problem of practical business.

I await your reaction on the religion angle. In my opinion, we couldn't get worse public opinion than we have had or have less customers with what we've got to sell.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Westbrook |first=Donald A. |title=Among the Scientologists: History, Theology, and Praxis |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2018 |location=Oxford |page=84}}</ref>}}

The letter's recipient, Helen O'Brien, resigned the following September.<ref name="Miller-214">Miller, p. 214</ref> She criticized Hubbard for creating "a temperate zone voodoo, in its inelasticity, unexplainable procedures, and mindless group euphoria".<ref name="OBrien-vii">O'Brien, p. vii</ref>

Despite objections, on December 18, 1953, Hubbard incorporated the Church of Scientology, Church of American Science and Church of Spiritual Engineering in [[Camden, New Jersey]].<ref name="Williams">Williams, Ian.

Scientology franchises became Churches of Scientology and some auditors began dressing as clergymen, complete with [[clerical collar]]s. If they were arrested in the course of their activities, Hubbard advised, they should sue for massive damages for molesting "a Man of God going about his business".<ref name="Williams" /> A few years later he told Scientologists: "If attacked on some vulnerable point by anyone or anything or any organization, always find or manufacture enough threat against them to cause them to sue for peace&nbsp;...

The 1950s saw Scientology growing steadily.

==Controversies and crises==
{{see also|Scientology controversies}}
[[File:Phoenix-L. Ron Hubbart House-1945.JPG|250px|thumb|The L. Ron Hubbard House at Camelback in Phoenix, Arizona. The house is listed in the National Register of Historic Places]] [[File:Phoenix-L. Ron Hubbart House-Buick Super 8.JPG|250px|thumb|L. Ron Hubbard's car, a 1947 Buick Super 8. The car is parked behind the house]]
By the start of the 1960s, Hubbard was the leader of a worldwide movement with thousands of followers. A decade later, however, he had left Saint Hill Manor and moved aboard his own private fleet of ships as the Church of Scientology faced worldwide controversy.

The Church of Scientology says that the problems of this period were due to "vicious, covert international attacks" by the United States government, "all of which were proven false and baseless, which were to last 27 years and finally culminated in the Government being sued for 750&nbsp;million dollars for conspiracy."<ref name="FIL67" /> Behind the attacks, stated Hubbard, lay a vast conspiracy of "psychiatric front groups" secretly controlling governments: "Every single lie, false charge and attack on Scientology has been traced directly to this group's members. They have sought at great expense for nineteen years to crush and eradicate any new development in the field of the mind. They are actively preventing any effectiveness in this field."<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron. "[http://freedom.lronhubbard.org/page020.htm Constitutional Destruction]." June 9, 1969, retrieved February 8, 2011.</ref>

Hubbard believed that Scientology was being infiltrated by saboteurs and spies and introduced "[[List of Scientology Security Checks|security checking]]"<ref name="Miller-239" /> to identify those he termed "potential trouble sources" and "[[suppressive person]]s". Members of the Church of Scientology were interrogated with the aid of E-meters and were asked questions such as "Have you ever practiced homosexuality?" and "Have you ever had unkind thoughts about L. Ron Hubbard?"<ref name="Atack-150">Atack, p. 150</ref> For a time, Scientologists were even interrogated about crimes committed in past lives: "Have you ever destroyed a culture?" "Did you come to Earth for evil purposes?" "Have you ever zapped anyone?"<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron. "Sec Check Whole Track," HCO Bulletin of June 19, 1961; quoted in Atack, p. 152</ref>

He also sought to exert political influence, advising Scientologists to vote against [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]] and establishing a Department of Government Affairs "to bring government and hostile philosophies or societies into a state of complete compliance with the goals of Scientology". This, he said, "is done by high-level ability to control and in its absence by a low-level ability to overwhelm. Introvert such agencies. Control such agencies."<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron. "Department of Government Affairs," HCO Policy Letter of August 15, 1960; quoted in Miller, p. 241</ref>

The U.S. Government was already well aware of Hubbard's activities. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] had a lengthy file on him, including a 1951 interview with an agent who considered him a "mental case".<ref name="Miller-181">Miller, p. 181</ref> Police forces in a number of jurisdictions began exchanging information about Scientology through the auspices of [[Interpol]], which eventually led to prosecutions.<ref>Fooner, Michael. ''Interpol: issues in world crime and international criminal justice'', p. 13. New York: Plenum Press, 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-306-43135-7}}</ref> In 1958, the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] withdrew the Washington, D.C. Church of Scientology's [[tax exemption]] after it found that Hubbard and his family were profiting unreasonably from Scientology's ostensibly non-profit income.<ref name="Atack-142" /> The [[Food and Drug Administration]] took action against Scientology's medical claims, seizing thousands of pills being marketed as "radiation cures"<ref name="Miller-228">Miller, p. 228</ref> as well as publications and E-meters. The Church of Scientology was required to label them as being "ineffective in the diagnosis or treatment of disease".<ref name="Atack-154">Atack, p. 154</ref>

Following the FDA's actions, Scientology attracted increasingly unfavorable publicity across the English-speaking world.<ref name="Wallis-192">Wallis, p. 192</ref> It faced particularly hostile scrutiny in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]], where it was accused of [[brainwashing]], blackmail, extortion and damaging the mental health of its members.<ref name="Wallis-215">Wallis, p. 215</ref> The Victorian state government established a Board of Inquiry into Scientology in November 1963.<ref name="Miller-250">Miller, p. 250</ref> [[Anderson Report|Its report]], published in October 1965, condemned every aspect of Scientology and Hubbard himself. He was described as being of doubtful sanity, having a [[persecution complex]] and displaying strong indications of [[paranoid schizophrenia]] with [[delusions of grandeur]]. His writings were characterized as nonsensical, abounding in "self-glorification and grandiosity, replete with histrionics and hysterical, incontinent outbursts".<ref>Miller, pp. 252–253</ref> Sociologist [[Roy Wallis]] comments that the report drastically changed public perceptions of Scientology:

{{quote|The former conception of the movement as a relatively harmless, if cranky, health and self-improvement cult, was transformed into one which portrayed it as evil, dangerous, a form of hypnosis (with all the overtones of [[Svengali]] in the layman's mind), and brainwashing.<ref name="Wallis-215" />}}

The report led to Scientology being banned in Victoria,<ref name="Wallis-193">Wallis, p. 193</ref> [[Western Australia]] and [[South Australia]],<ref name="Wallis-196">Wallis, p. 196</ref> and led to more negative publicity around the world. Newspapers and politicians in the UK pressed the British government for action against Scientology. In April 1966, hoping to form a remote "safe haven" for Scientology, Hubbard traveled to the southern African country [[Rhodesia]] (today Zimbabwe) and looked into setting up a base there at a hotel on [[Lake Kariba]]. Despite his attempts to curry favour with the local government—he personally delivered champagne to Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]]'s house, but Smith refused to see him—Rhodesia promptly refused to renew Hubbard's visa, compelling him to leave the country.<ref>Reitman (2011), pp. 80–81</ref> In July 1968, the British [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]], [[Kenneth Robinson]], announced that foreign Scientologists would no longer be permitted to enter the UK and Hubbard himself was excluded from the country as an "[[undesirable alien]]".<ref name="Atack-183">Atack, p. 183</ref> Further inquiries were launched in Canada, New Zealand and [[South Africa]].<ref name="Wallis-196" />

Hubbard took three major new initiatives in the face of these challenges. "Ethics Technology" was introduced to tighten internal discipline within Scientology. It required Scientologists to "[[Disconnection (Scientology)|disconnect]]" from any organization or individual—including family members—deemed to be disruptive or "suppressive".<ref name="Atack-155">Atack, p. 155</ref> According to church-operated websites, "A person who disconnects is simply exercising his right to communicate or not to communicate with a particular person." Hubbard stated: "Communication, however, is a two-way flow. If one has the right to communicate, then one must also have the right to not receive communication from another. It is this latter corollary of the right to communicate that gives us our right to privacy."<ref>{{Cite web |title=What is disconnection? |url=http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/Part12/Chp36/pg0649.html |access-date=December 17, 2015}}</ref> Scientologists were also required to write "Knowledge Reports" on each other, reporting transgressions or misapplications of Scientology methods. Hubbard promulgated a long list of punishable "Misdemeanors", "Crimes", and "High Crimes".<ref name="Atack-156">Atack, p. 156</ref> The "[[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]]" policy was introduced, which was applicable to anyone deemed an "enemy" of Scientology: "May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed."<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron. "Penalties for Lower Conditions." HCO Policy Letter of October 18, 1967, Issue IV. Quoted in Atack, pp. 175–176</ref><ref>Wallis, pp. 144–145</ref>

At the start of March 1966, Hubbard created the [[Guardian's Office]] (GO), a new agency within the Church of Scientology that was headed by his wife Mary Sue.<ref name="Atack-161">Atack, p. 161</ref> It dealt with Scientology's external affairs, including public relations, legal actions and the gathering of intelligence on perceived threats.<ref name="Atack-165">Atack, p. 165</ref> As Scientology faced increasingly negative media attention, the GO retaliated with hundreds of writs for libel and slander; it issued more than forty on a single day.<ref name="Atack-189">Atack, p. 189</ref> Hubbard ordered his staff to find "lurid, blood sex crime actual evidence {{sic}} on [Scientology's] attackers".<ref name="Atack-160">Atack, p. 160</ref>

Finally, at the end of 1966, Hubbard acquired his own fleet of ships.<ref name="Wright" /> He established the "Hubbard Explorational Company Ltd" which purchased three ships—the ''Enchanter'', a forty-ton schooner,<ref name="Miller-264">Miller, p. 264</ref> the ''Avon River'', an old trawler,<ref name="Miller-265">Miller, p. 265</ref> and the ''Royal Scotman'' {{sic}}, a former [[Irish Sea]] cattle ferry that he made his home and flagship.<ref name="Miller-269">Miller, p. 269</ref> The ships were crewed by the Sea Organization or [[Sea Org]], a group of Scientologist volunteers, with the support of a couple of professional seamen.<ref name="Wright" /><ref name="Miller-272">Miller, p. 272</ref>

==Commodore of the Sea Org==
{{Main|Sea Org}}
[[File:CityofCorfu.jpg|right|thumb|alt=View of a coastal town with a bay visible behind foreground buildings|Corfu town, where the Sea Org moored in 1968–1969]]
After Hubbard created the Sea Org "fleet" in early 1967 it began an eight-year voyage, sailing from port to port in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern [[North Atlantic]]. The fleet traveled as far as [[Corfu]] in the eastern Mediterranean and [[Dakar]] and the [[Azores]] in the Atlantic, but rarely stayed anywhere for longer than six weeks. Ken Urquhart, Hubbard's personal assistant at the time, later recalled:

{{quote|[Hubbard] said we had to keep moving because there were so many people after him. If they caught up with him they would cause him so much trouble that he would be unable to continue his work, Scientology would not get into the world and there would be social and economic chaos, if not a [[nuclear holocaust]].<ref name="Miller-297">Quoted in Miller, p. 297</ref>}}

When Hubbard established the Sea Org he publicly declared that he had relinquished his management responsibilities. According to Miller, this was not true. He received daily [[telex]] messages from Scientology organizations around the world reporting their statistics and income. The Church of Scientology sent him $15,000 ({{Inflation|US|15000|1967|fmt=eq}}) a week and millions of dollars were transferred to his bank accounts in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]].<ref name="Miller-299">Miller, p. 299</ref> Couriers arrived regularly, conveying luxury food for Hubbard and his family<ref name="Miller-300">Miller, p. 300</ref> or cash that had been smuggled from England to avoid currency export restrictions.<ref name="Miller-290">Miller, p. 290</ref>

Along the way, Hubbard sought to establish a safe haven in "a friendly little country where Scientology would be allowed to prosper", as Miller puts it.<ref name="Miller-310">Miller, p. 310</ref> The fleet stayed at Corfu for several months in 1968–1969. Hubbard renamed the ships after Greek gods—the ''Royal Scotman'' was rechristened ''Apollo''—and he praised the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|recently established military dictatorship]].<ref name="Miller-290" /> The Sea Org was represented as "Professor Hubbard's Philosophy School" in a telegram to the Greek government.<ref name="Miller-295">Miller, p. 295</ref> In March 1969, however, Hubbard and his ships were ordered to leave.<ref name="Miller-2965">Miller, p. 296</ref> In mid-1972, Hubbard tried again in [[Morocco]], establishing contacts with the country's [[secret police]] and training senior policemen and intelligence agents in techniques for detecting subversives.<ref name="Miller-311">Miller, p. 311</ref> The program ended in failure when it became caught up in internal Moroccan politics, and Hubbard left the country hastily in December 1972.<ref name="Miller-312">Miller, p. 312</ref>

At the same time, Hubbard was still developing Scientology's doctrines. A Scientology biography states that "free of organizational duties and aided by the first Sea Org members, L. Ron Hubbard now had the time and facilities to confirm in the [[physical universe]] some of the events and places he had encountered in his journeys down the track of time."<ref name="Mission">Hubbard, L. Ron. ''Mission into Time'', p. 7. Copenhagen: AOSH DK Publications Department A/S, 1973. {{ISBN|87-87347-56-3}}</ref> In 1965, he designated several existing Scientology courses as confidential, repackaging them as the first of the esoteric "[[Operating Thetan|OT levels]]".<ref name="Atack-159">Atack, p. 159</ref> Two years later he announced the release of OT3, the "Wall of Fire", revealing the secrets of an immense disaster that had occurred "on this planet, and on the other seventy-five planets which form this Confederacy, seventy-five million years ago".<ref>Hubbard, L. Ron. "Ron's Journal '67," quoted in Atack, p. 173.</ref> Scientologists were required to undertake the first two OT levels before learning how [[Xenu]], the leader of the Galactic Confederacy, had shipped billions of people to Earth and blown them up with [[hydrogen bomb]]s, following which their traumatized spirits were stuck together at "implant stations", brainwashed with false memories and eventually became contained within human beings.<ref name="Atack-32">Atack, p. 32</ref> The discovery of OT3 was said to have taken a major physical toll on Hubbard, who announced that he had broken a knee, an arm, and his back during the course of his research.<ref name="Atack-173">Atack, p. 173</ref> A year later, in 1968, he unveiled OT levels 4 to 6 and began delivering OT training courses to Scientologists aboard the ''Royal Scotman''.<ref name="Atack-177">Atack, p. 177</ref>

Scientologists around the world were presented with a glamorous picture of life in the Sea Org and many applied to join Hubbard aboard the fleet.<ref name="Atack-177" /> What they found was rather different from the image. Most of those joining had no nautical experience at all.<ref name="Atack-177" /> Mechanical difficulties and blunders by the crews led to a series of embarrassing incidents and near-disasters. Following one incident in which the rudder of the ''Royal Scotman'' was damaged during a storm, Hubbard ordered the ship's entire crew to be reduced to a "condition of liability" and wear gray rags tied to their arms.<ref name="Miller-285">Miller, p. 285</ref> The ship itself was treated the same way, with dirty tarpaulins tied around its funnel to symbolize its lower status. According to those aboard, conditions were appalling; the crew was worked to the point of exhaustion, given meagre rations and forbidden to wash or change their clothes for several weeks.<ref name="Miller-286">Miller, p. 286</ref> Hubbard maintained a harsh disciplinary regime aboard the fleet, punishing mistakes by confining people in the ''Royal Scotman''{{'s}} bilge tanks without toilet facilities and with food provided in buckets.<ref name="Atack-180">Atack, p. 180</ref> At other times erring crew members were thrown overboard with Hubbard looking on and, occasionally, filming.<ref name="Atack-186">Atack, p. 186</ref> [[David Mayo (Scientology)|David Mayo]], a Sea Org member at the time, later recalled:

{{quote|We tried not to think too hard about his behavior. It was not rational much of the time, but to even consider such a thing was a discreditable thought and you couldn't allow yourself to have a discreditable thought. One of the questions in a sec[urity] check was, "Have you ever had any unkind thoughts about LRH?" and you could get into very serious trouble if you had. So you tried hard not to.<ref>Miller, p. 289</ref>}}

From about 1970, Hubbard was attended aboard ship by the children of Sea Org members, organized as the [[Commodore's Messenger Organization]] (CMO). They were mainly young girls dressed in [[hot pants]] and [[halter top]]s, who were responsible for running errands for Hubbard such as lighting his cigarettes, dressing him or relaying his verbal commands to other members of the crew.<ref>Miller, p. 301</ref><ref name="sw-life">Sappell, Joel; Welkos, Robert (June 24, 1990).

==Life in hiding==

During the 1970s, Hubbard faced an increasing number of legal threats. French prosecutors charged him and the French Church of Scientology with fraud and customs violations in 1972. He was advised that he was at risk of being extradited to France.<ref name="Corydon-94">Corydon, Bent. ''L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?'', p. 94.

Hubbard's health deteriorated significantly during this period. A [[chain smoking|chain-smoker]], he also suffered from [[bursitis]] and excessive weight, and had a prominent growth on his forehead.<ref name="Miller-316">Miller, p. 316</ref> He suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in 1973 and had a heart attack in 1975 that required him to take [[anticoagulant]] drugs for the next year.<ref name="Atack-255">Atack, p. 255</ref> In September 1978, Hubbard had a [[pulmonary embolism]], falling into a coma, but recovered.<ref name="Atack-256">Atack, p. 256</ref>

He remained active in managing and developing Scientology, establishing the controversial [[Rehabilitation Project Force]] in 1974<ref name="Atack-206">Atack, p. 206</ref> and issuing policy and doctrinal bulletins.<ref name="Atack-204">Atack, p. 204</ref> However, the Sea Org's voyages were coming to an end. The ''Apollo'' was banned from several Spanish ports<ref name="Atack-204" /> and was expelled from [[Curaçao]] in October 1975.<ref name="Atack-209">Atack, p. 209</ref> The Sea Org came to be suspected of being a [[CIA]] operation, leading to a riot in [[Funchal]], [[Madeira]], when the ''Apollo'' docked there. At the time, ''The Apollo Stars'', a musical group founded by Hubbard and made up entirely of ship-bound members of the Sea Org, was offering free on-pier concerts in an attempt to promote Scientology, and the riot occurred at one of these events. Hubbard decided to relocate back to the United States to establish a "land base" for the Sea Org in [[Florida]].<ref name="Miller-334">Miller, p. 334</ref> The Church of Scientology attributes this decision to the activities on the ''Apollo'' having "outgrow[n] the ship's capacity".<ref name="Chronicle1970-1979" />

In October 1975, Hubbard moved into a hotel suite in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]]. The [[Fort Harrison Hotel]] in [[Clearwater, Florida]], was secretly acquired as the location for the "land base".<ref name="Miller-334" /> On December 5, 1975, Hubbard and his wife Mary Sue moved into a condominium complex in nearby [[Dunedin, Florida|Dunedin]].<ref name="Miller-336">Miller, p. 336</ref> Their presence was meant to be a closely guarded secret but was accidentally compromised the following month.<ref name="Miller-338">Miller, p. 338</ref> Hubbard immediately left Dunedin and moved to Georgetown, Washington, D.C., accompanied by a handful of aides and messengers, but not his wife.<ref name="Miller-340">Miller, p. 340</ref> Six months later, following another security alert in July 1976, Hubbard moved to another safe house in [[Culver City, California]].

Throughout this period, Hubbard was heavily involved in directing the activities of the Guardian's Office (GO), the legal bureau/intelligence agency that he had established in 1966. He believed that Scientology was being attacked by an international [[Nazi]] conspiracy, which he termed the "Tenyaka Memorial", through a network of drug companies, banks and psychiatrists in a bid to take over the world.<ref>Beresford, David (February 7, 1980). "Snow White's dirty tricks." London: ''The Guardian''</ref> In 1973, he instigated the "[[Operation Snow White|Snow White Program]]" and directed the GO to remove negative reports about Scientology from government files and track down their sources.<ref>Miller, pp. 317–318</ref> The GO was ordered to "get all false and secret files on Scientology, LRH &nbsp;... that cannot be obtained legally, by all possible lines of approach&nbsp;... i.e., job penetration, janitor penetration, suitable guises utilizing covers." His involvement in the GO's operations was concealed through the use of codenames. The GO carried out covert campaigns on his behalf such as [[List of Guardian's Office operations#Operation Bulldozer Leak|Operation Bulldozer Leak]], intended "to effectively spread the rumor that will lead Government, media, and individual <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Suppressive Person]]s<nowiki>]</nowiki> to conclude that LRH has no control of the C of S and no legal liability for Church activity". He was kept informed of GO operations, such as the theft of medical records from a hospital, harassment of psychiatrists and infiltrations of organizations that had been critical of Scientology at various times, such as the [[Better Business Bureau]], the [[American Medical Association]], and [[American Psychiatric Association]].<ref>Marshall, John (January 24, 1980). "The Scientology Papers: Hubbard still gave orders, records show." Toronto: ''Globe and Mail''</ref>

Members of the GO infiltrated and burglarized numerous government organizations, including the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] and the Internal Revenue Service.<ref>Streissguth, p. 75</ref> After two GO agents were caught in the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the IRS, the FBI carried out simultaneous raids on GO offices in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. on July 7, 1977. They retrieved [[wiretap]] equipment, burglary tools and some 90,000 pages of incriminating documents. Hubbard was not prosecuted, though he was labeled an "[[unindicted co-conspirator]]" by government prosecutors. His wife Mary Sue was indicted and subsequently convicted of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]. She was sent to a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]] along with ten other Scientologists.<ref name="Reitman">Reitman (2007), p. 323</ref>

Hubbard's troubles increased in February 1978 when a French court convicted him in absentia for obtaining money under false pretenses. He was sentenced to four years in prison and a 35,000[[French franc|FF]] ($7,000) fine, {{Inflation|US|7000|1978|fmt=eq}}.<ref>Marshall, John (January 26, 1980). "The Scientology Papers: The hidden Hubbard." Toronto: ''Globe and Mail''</ref> He went into hiding in April 1979, moving to an apartment in [[Hemet, California]], where his only contact with the outside world was via ten trusted messengers. He cut contact with everyone else, even his wife, whom he saw for the last time in August 1979.<ref name="Atack-258">Atack, p. 258</ref> Hubbard faced a possible indictment for his role in [[Operation Freakout]], the GO's campaign against New York journalist [[Paulette Cooper]], and in February 1980 he disappeared into deep cover in the company of two trusted messengers, Pat and Annie Broeker.<ref name="Atack-259">Atack, p. 259</ref><ref name="Miller-364">Miller, p. 364</ref>

For the first few years of the 1980s, Hubbard and the Broekers lived on the move, touring the Pacific Northwest in a [[recreational vehicle]] and living for a while in apartments in [[Newport Beach]] and Los Angeles.<ref name="SW-Deep">Sappell, Joel; Welkos, Robert W.

In Hubbard's absence, members of the Sea Org staged a takeover of the Church of Scientology and purged many veteran Scientologists. A young messenger, [[David Miscavige]], became Scientology's ''de facto'' leader.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Church of Spiritual Technology ranch Creston.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Aerial photograph of an estate with a racetrack visible in the background|The ranch in San Luis Obispo County, California where Hubbard spent his final years]]
For the last two years of his life, Hubbard lived in a luxury [[Blue Bird Corporation|Blue Bird]] motorhome on Whispering Winds, a 160-acre ranch near [[Creston, California]]. He remained in deep hiding while controversy raged in the outside world about whether he was still alive and, if so, where. He spent his time "writing and researching", according to a spokesperson, and pursued photography and music, overseeing construction work and checking on his animals.<ref>Brown, Mark (January 30, 1986). "Creston provided quiet retreat for controversial church leader." ''The County Telegram-Tribune'', San Luis Obispo, pp. 1A/5A.</ref> He repeatedly redesigned the property, spending millions of dollars remodeling the ranch house—which went virtually uninhabited—and building a quarter-mile [[horse-racing track]] with an [[observation tower]], which reportedly was never used.<ref name="SW-Deep" />

He was still closely involved in managing the Church of Scientology via secretly delivered orders<ref name="SW-Deep" /> and continued to receive large amounts of money, of which ''Forbes'' magazine estimated "at least $200 million [was] gathered in Hubbard's name through 1982." In September 1985, the IRS notified the Church that it was considering indicting Hubbard for tax fraud.<ref name="Behar">Behar, Richard (October 27, 1986). "The prophet and profits of Scientology."

In 2004, eighteen years after Hubbard's death, the Church claimed eight million followers worldwide. According to religious scholar [[J.

Kliever]] notes that Hubbard was "the only source of the religion, and he has no successor". Hubbard is referred to simply as "Source" within Scientology and the theological acceptability of any Scientology-related activity is determined by how closely it adheres to Hubbard's doctrines.<ref name="Rothstein-24">Rothstein, p. 24</ref> Hubbard's name and signature are official trademarks of the [[Religious Technology Center]], established in 1982 to control and oversee the use of Hubbard's works and Scientology's trademarks and copyrights.

The Danish historian of religions [[Mikael Rothstein]] describes Scientology as "a movement focused on the figure of Hubbard". He comments: "The fact that [Hubbard's] life is mythologized is as obvious as in the cases of [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]] or [[Gautama Buddha|Siddartha Gotama]]. This is how religion works. Scientology, however, rejects this analysis altogether, and goes to great lengths to defend every detail of Hubbard's amazing and fantastic life as plain historical fact." Hubbard is presented as "the master of a multitude of disciplines" who performed extraordinary feats as a photographer, composer, scientist, therapist, explorer, navigator, philosopher, poet, artist, humanitarian, adventurer, soldier, scout, musician and many other fields of endeavor.<ref name="Rothstein-21">Rothstein, p. 21.</ref> The Church of Scientology portrays Hubbard's life and work as having proceeded seamlessly, "as if they were a continuous set of predetermined events and discoveries that unfolded through his lifelong research" even up to and beyond his death.<ref name="Bromley">Bromley, p. 89</ref>

According to Rothstein's assessment of Hubbard's legacy, Scientology consciously aims to transfer the [[charismatic authority]] of Hubbard to institutionalize his authority over the organization, even after his death. Hubbard is presented as a virtually superhuman religious ideal just as Scientology itself is presented as the most important development in human history.<ref name="Rothstein-20">Rothstein, p. 20</ref> As Rothstein puts it, "reverence for Scientology's scripture is reverence for Hubbard, the man who in the Scientological perspective single-handedly brought salvation to all human beings."<ref name="Rothstein-21" /> [[David G. Bromley]] of the [[University of Virginia]] comments that the real Hubbard has been transformed into a "prophetic persona", "LRH", which acts as the basis for his prophetic authority within Scientology and transcends his biographical history.<ref name="Bromley" /> According to Dorthe Refslund Christensen, Hubbard's [[hagiography]] directly compares him with Buddha. Hubbard is viewed as having made Eastern traditions more accessible by approaching them with a scientific attitude. "Hubbard is seen as the ultimate-cross-cultural savior; he is thought to be able to release man from his miserable condition because he had the necessary background, and especially the right attitude."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Christensen |first=Dorthe Refslund |title=Controversial New Religions |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |edition=1st |editor-last2=Petersen |editor-first2=Jasper Aagaard}}</ref>

Hubbard, although increasingly deified after his death, is the model [[Operating Thetan]] to Scientologists and their founder, and not God. Hubbard then is the "Source", "inviting others to follow his path in ways comparable to a Bodhisattva figure" according to religious scholar Donald A. Westbrook. Scientologists refer to L. Ron Hubbard as "Ron", referring to him as a personal friend.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Westbrook |first=Donald A. |title=Handbook of Scientology |publisher=Brill |year=2017 |isbn=9789004330542 |editor-last=Lewis |editor-first=James R. |series=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |chapter=Researching Scientology and Scientologists in the United States: Methods and Conclusions |editor-last2=Hellesoy |editor-first2=Kjersti}}</ref>

In the late 1970s, two men began to assemble a picture of Hubbard's life. Michael Linn Shannon, a resident of Portland, Oregon, became interested in Hubbard's life story after an encounter with a Scientology recruiter. Over the next four years he collected previously undisclosed records and documents. He intended to write an exposé of Hubbard and sent a copy of his findings and key records to a number of contacts but was unable to find a publisher.<ref name="Atack-46">Atack, p. 46</ref>

Shannon's findings were acquired by [[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]], a Scientologist who had been appointed Hubbard's official archivist.<ref name="Atack-46" /> He had been given the job of assembling documents relating to Hubbard's life for the purpose of helping Omar V. Garrison, a non-Scientologist who had written two books sympathetic to Scientology, to write an official biography. However, the documents that he uncovered convinced both Armstrong and Garrison that Hubbard had systematically misrepresented his life. Garrison refused to write a "puff piece" and declared that he would not "repeat all the falsehoods they [the Church of Scientology] had perpetuated over the years". He wrote a "warts and all" biography while Armstrong quit Scientology, taking five boxes of papers with him. The Church of Scientology and Mary Sue Hubbard sued for the return of the documents while settling out of court with Garrison, requiring him to turn over the nearly completed manuscript of the biography.<ref>Shelor, George-Wayne. "Writer tells of Hubbard's 'faked past'." ''Clearwater Sun'', May 10, 1984</ref> In October 1984 Judge Paul G. Breckenridge ruled in Armstrong's favor, saying:

{{quote|The evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a [[pathological liar]] when it comes to his history, background and achievements. The writings and documents in evidence additionally reflect his egoism, greed, avarice, lust for power, and vindictiveness and aggressiveness against persons perceived by him to be disloyal or hostile. At the same time it appears that he is charismatic and highly capable of motivating, organizing, controlling, manipulating and inspiring his adherents. He has been referred to during the trial as a "genius", a "revered person", a man who was "viewed by his followers in awe". Obviously, he is and has been a very complex person and that complexity is further reflected in his alter ego, the Church of Scientology.<ref>Breckenridge Jr., Paul G. (October 24, 1984). ''Memorandum of Intended Decision'', Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong. Quoted by Miller, pp. 370–71</ref>}}

In November 1987, the British journalist and writer Russell Miller published ''[[Bare-faced Messiah]]'', the first full-length biography of L. Ron Hubbard. He drew on Armstrong's papers, official records and interviews with those who had known Hubbard including ex-Scientologists and family members. The book was well-received by reviewers but the Church of Scientology sought unsuccessfully to prohibit its publication on the grounds of copyright infringement.<ref>Murtagh, Peter (October 10, 1987).

According to Scientology biographies, during a journey to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1923 Hubbard learned of [[Freudian psychology]] from [[Joseph Thompson (psychiatrist)|Commander Joseph "Snake" Thompson]], a U.S. Navy psychoanalyst and medic.<ref name="Miller-23" /><ref name="Whitehead-46">Whitehead, p. 46</ref> Scientology biographies describe this encounter as giving Hubbard training in a particular scientific approach to the mind, which he found unsatisfying.<ref name="Christensen238">Christensen, p. 238</ref> In his diary, Hubbard claimed he was the youngest Eagle Scout in the U.S.<ref name="Miller-25">Miller, p. 25</ref>

Scientology accounts say that Hubbard "made his way deep into Manchuria's Western Hills and beyond&nbsp;— to break bread with Mongolian bandits, share campfires with Siberian shamans and befriend the last in the line of magicians from the court of [[Kublai Khan]]".<ref>"[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/early-years/asia-and-the-south-pacific.html L.

He characterized the sights of Beijing as "rubberneck stations" for tourists and described the palaces of the [[Forbidden City]] as "very trashy-looking" and "not worth mentioning". He was impressed by the [[Great Wall of China]] near Beijing,<ref name="Miller-42">Miller, p. 42</ref> but concluded of the Chinese: "They smell of all the baths they didn't take. The trouble with China is, there are too many [[chink]]s here."<ref name="Miller-43">Miller, p. 43</ref>

Despite not graduating from George Washington, Hubbard claimed "to be not only a graduate engineer, but 'a member of the first United States course in formal education in what is called today nuclear physics.'"<ref name="Malko-31" /> However, a Church of Scientology biography describes him as "never noted for being in class" and says that he "thoroughly detest[ed] his subjects".<ref name="Brief Biography">"A Brief Biography of L.

Los Angeles: Bridge Publications, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-4031-4420-1}}</ref> and Hubbard himself stated that he "set out to find out from nuclear physics a knowledge of the physical universe, something entirely lacking in [[Asian philosophy]]".<ref name="Brief Biography" /> His university records indicate that his exposure to "nuclear physics" consisted of one class in "atomic and molecular phenomena" for which he earned an "F" grade.<ref name="Streeter-206">Streeter, p. 206</ref>

Scientologists claim he was more interested in extracurricular activities, particularly writing and flying. According to church materials, "he earned his wings as a pioneering [[barnstorming|barnstormer]] at the dawn of American aviation"<ref name="Great Secret" /> and was "recognized as one of the country's most outstanding pilots.

[[File:Luquillo, Puerto Rico.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Aerial view of a coastal city from inland|Luquillo, Puerto Rico, near where Scientologists say Hubbard carried out the "West Indies Mineralogical Survey" in 1932]]
After leaving university Hubbard traveled to Puerto Rico on what the Church of Scientology calls the "Puerto Rican Mineralogical Expedition".<ref name="LRH Biog Puerto Rican">"[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/adventures-explorations/puerto-rican-mineralogical-expedition.html L.

According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard was "called to Hollywood" to work on film scripts in the mid-1930s, although Scientology accounts differ as to exactly when this was (whether 1935,<ref name="Dianetics Today">"About the Author" in Hubbard, L.

Scientology accounts of the expedition to Alaska describe "Hubbard's re-charting of an especially treacherous [[Inside Passage]], and his ethnological study of indigenous [[Aleut]]s and [[Haida people|Haidas]]" and tell of how "along the way, he not only roped a [[Kodiak Bear]], but braved seventy-mile-an-hour winds and commensurate seas off the [[Aleutian Islands]]."<ref name="Alaskan">"[http://www.lronhubbard.org/biography/adventures-explorations/alaskan-radio-experimental-expedition.html L.

The Church disputes the official record of Hubbard's naval career. It asserts that the records are incomplete and perhaps falsified "to conceal Hubbard's secret activities as an intelligence officer".<ref name="SW-Creating" /> In 1990 the Church provided the ''Los Angeles Times'' with a document that was said to be a copy of Hubbard's official record of service. The U.S. Navy told the ''Times'' that "its contents are not supported by Hubbard's personnel record."<ref name="SW-Creating" /> ''[[The New Yorker]]'' reported in February 2011 that the Scientology document was considered by federal archivists to be a forgery.<ref name="Wright" />

The Church of Scientology presents him as a "much-decorated war hero who commanded a [[corvette]] and during hostilities was crippled and wounded".<ref name="Lamont-19">Lamont, pp. 19–20</ref> Scientology publications say he served as a "[[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] of Corvette squadrons" in "[[List of theaters and campaigns of World War II|all five theaters of World War II]]" and was awarded "twenty-one medals and palms" for his service.<ref name="Rolph-16">Rolph, p. 16</ref> He was "severely wounded and was taken crippled and blinded" to a military hospital, where he "worked his way back to fitness, strength and full perception in less than two years, using only what he knew and could determine about Man and his relationship to the universe".<ref name="Dianetics Today" /> He said that he had seen combat repeatedly, telling [[A. E. van Vogt]] that he had once sailed his ship "right into the harbor of a Japanese occupied island in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. His attitude was that if you took your flag down the Japanese would not know one boat from another, so he tied up at the dock, went ashore and wandered around by himself for three days."<ref name="Miller-141">Miller, p. 141</ref>{{specify|Who is being quoted here?|date=May 2020}}

Hubbard's war service has great significance in the history and mythology of the Church of Scientology, as he is said to have cured himself through techniques that would later underpin Scientology and Dianetics. According to Moulton, Hubbard told him that he had been machine-gunned in the back near the Dutch East Indies. Hubbard asserted that his eyes had been damaged as well, either "by the flash of a large-caliber gun" or when he had "a bomb go off in my face".<ref name="SW-Creating" /> Scientology texts say that he returned from the war "[b]linded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back" and was twice pronounced dead.<ref name="Wright" /> Hubbard's official Navy service records indicate that "his military performance was, at times, substandard" and he received only four campaign medals rather than the claimed twenty-one. He was never recorded as being injured or wounded in combat and never received a [[Purple Heart]].<ref name="SW-Creating" />

The Church of Scientology says that Hubbard's key breakthrough in the development of Dianetics was made at [[Oak Knoll Naval Hospital]] in [[Oakland, California]]. According to the Church,

{{quote|In early 1945, while recovering from war injuries at [[Oak Knoll Naval Hospital]], Mr. Hubbard conducts a series of tests and experiments dealing with the endocrine system.

The Church of Scientology says Hubbard was "sent in" by his fellow science fiction author [[Robert Heinlein]], "who was running off-book intelligence operations for naval intelligence at the time". However, Heinlein's authorized biographer has said that he looked into the matter at the suggestion of Scientologists but found nothing to corroborate claims that Heinlein had been involved, and his biography of Heinlein makes no mention of the matter.<ref name="Wright">Wright, Lawrence (February 14, 2011)."[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_wright?currentPage=all The Apostate: Paul Haggis vs. the Church of Scientology]."

The Church of Scientology says Hubbard quit the Navy because it "attempted to monopolize all his researches and force him to work on a project 'to make man more suggestible' and when he was unwilling, tried to blackmail him by ordering him back to active duty to perform this function. Having many friends he was able to instantly resign from the Navy and escape this trap."<ref name="FIL67" /> The Navy said in a statement in 1980: "There is no evidence on record of an attempt to recall him to active duty."<ref name="sppulitzer">{{Cite news |last1=Stafford |first1=Charles L. |last2=Orsini |first2=Bette |date=January 9, 1980 |title=Church moves to defend itself against 'attackers |work=St. Petersburg Times}}</ref>

In late 2012, Bridge published a comprehensive official biography of Hubbard, titled ''The L.
