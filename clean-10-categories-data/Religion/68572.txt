'''Achziv''' ({{lang-he|אכזיב|}}; {{lang-ar|الزيب|'''Az-Zīb'''}}) is an ancient site on the Mediterranean coast of northern [[Israel]], between the border with [[Lebanon]] and the city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].  It is located {{convert|13.5|km|mi}} north of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] on the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], within the municipal area of [[Nahariya]].  Today it is an [[National parks and nature reserves of Israel|Israeli national park]].

Excavations have unearthed a fortified Canaanite city of the second millennium BCE.  The Phoenician town of the first millennium BCE is known both from the [[Hebrew Bible]] and Assyrian sources.  Phoenician Achzib went through ups and downs during the Persian and Hellenistic periods.  In early Roman times the town, known as ''Acdippa'', was a road station.  The [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Bordeaux Pilgrim]] mentions it in 333-334 CE still as a road station; Jewish sources of the Byzantine period call it ''Kheziv'' and ''Gesiv''.  There is no information about settlement at the site for the early Muslim period.  The Crusaders built a new village with a castle there.  During the Mamluk and Ottoman periods a modest village occupied the old [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] (archaeological mound).  This village was depopulated during the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]].  The only permanent resident of Achziv is an Israeli [[micronationalist]] who has been welcoming visitors to  legally disputed [[micronation]] of "[[Akhzivland]]", a small stretch of beach where he has lived since 1975.

==Etymology==
Mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible]] by its ancient name ''Achzib'', evidence of human settlement at the site dates back to the 18th century BCE. During the Roman period (and in classical literature) the imperial authorities called it ''Ecdippa''<ref name=Lipinskip302/> ''Ecdeppa'', or ''Ecdippon''.  By the [[early Middle Ages]], the [[Arabs|Arab]] name for the village "Az-Zeeb", or "al-Zib" ({{lang-ar|الزيب}} meaning 'trickster') was locally in common usage.  Az-Zeeb is a shortened form of the site's original ancient [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]]/[[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] name, ''Achzib''.<ref name=Lipinskip302/>

==History==

Human settlement at the site dates to as early as the 18th century BCE; and by the 10th century BCE it was a walled town.<ref name="Khalidi">Khalidi, 1992, p.35.</ref>  A tell excavated between 1941–44 and 1959-1964 found evidence of settlement from the [[Bronze Age|Middle Bronze Age II]], through the [[Roman empire|Roman period]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]].<ref name="Lipinskip302">Lipinski, 2004, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&pg=PA302 302]-3</ref> Achziv was the first fortified settlement found at the site by archaeologists.

===Middle Bronze Age===
====Middle Bronze Age IIA====
In the Middle Bronze IIA (MBIIA), remains are found at Phase N5 with features including child burials in storage jars below floors.

====Middle Bronze Age IIA-B====
At the transition from MBIIA to MBIIB, the settlement was subject to a violent destruction.<ref name="ReferenceA">Tell Achziv - Preliminary Report 2017</ref>

====Middle Bronze Age IIB====
In the Middle Bronze IIB (MBIIB), Phase N4 was part of a large Canaanite port city.<ref name="Prausnitz75">{{Cite journal |last=M. W.

To the north and south the city extended to the two nearby rivers, which the Canaanite engineers connected by a [[Moat|fosse]], thus transforming Achzib into an island.<ref name=Prausnitz75/>  A substantial destruction level from the beginning of the Late Bronze Age proves that even these fortifications were eventually not sufficient.<ref name=Negev/> A fierce conflgration ended Phase N4 and led to the transition to the MBIIC/LBI in Phase N3.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Iron Age===
By the 1000 BCE, Achziv was a prosperous and fortified [[Phoenicia]]n town. Conquered by the [[Assyrian empire]] in the 8th century BCE, however, it was subsequently ruled by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] during the rule of the [[Roman Empire]].
 
Achzib is mentioned in the [[Book of Joshua]] (19:29) and [[Book of Judges]] (1:31) as a town assigned to the tribe of [[Asher]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], but the Asherites did not manage to conquer it from the Phoenicians:<ref name="Perseus">[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0064%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DE%3Aentry+group%3D1%3Aentry%3Decdippa-geo]</ref>
::And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher ... and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib. ({{Bibleref2|Joshua 19:24-29}})
::Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, ... or of Achzib ... ({{Bibleref2|Judges 1:31}})

[[Image:Akhziv03.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|The mosque of al-Zib, restored at Achziv National Park]]
[[King David]] added the city into his Kingdom, but [[King Solomon]] returned it to [[Hiram I]] as part of the famous pact. [[Syro-Palestinian archaeology|archaeological]] evidence indicates that it remained Phoenician.<ref name=Lipinskip302/>

Positioned on a passage between the plain of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and the city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], Achzib was an important road station.<ref name=Lipinskip302/> Between the 10th and 6th centuries BCE, it was a prosperous town, with public buildings and tombs with [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] [[inscription]]s, attesting to the identity of its inhabitants at the time.<ref name=Lipinskip302/> Conquered by the [[Assyria]]ns in 701 BCE and listed in [[Sennacherib]]'s annals as ''Ak-zi-bi'', the continuation of Phoenician settlement through this period and during the decline endured during the [[Persian Empire|Persian period]], is evidenced in 5th and 4th century BCE Phoenician inscriptions that were found at the site.<ref name=Lipinskip302/>

During the invasions of [[Sennacherib]] the Assyrians conquered the city.<ref name="Gutenberg">[https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/gutenberg.org/1/7/3/2/17328/17328-h/17328-h.htm Project Gutenberg, 2016]</ref>

====Hellenistic period====
During the reign of the Seleucids the border was established at [[Rosh HaNikra grottoes|Rosh HaNikra]], just north to Achziv, making it a border city which they called ''Ekdippa'' (Έκδιππα in [[Ancient Greek]]) and put it under the control of [[Akko|Acre]].  Mentioned in the writings of [[Pseudo-Scylax]], the site likely regained some importance in [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] times.

====Roman and Byzantine periods====
A maritime city named Cziv, nine miles (14&nbsp;km) north of Acre, is mentioned by [[Josephus Flavius]] and later by [[Eusebius]].
Achziv (Cheziv) is mentioned in Jewish [[rabbinic writings]], for example Midrash [[Vayikra Rabba]] 37:4. Additionally, Achziv is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, and by the relating Middle Age commentators, concerning the location of Achziv in regards to historical borders of Israel.  At the end of the Roman era, a pottery workshop was located there.<ref>Avshalom-Gorni, 2006, [http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=392&mag_id=111 Akhziv]</ref>

====Crusader period====
With the arrival of the [[First Crusade|Crusader]]s and after the fall of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in 1104,  "Casal Imbertia" or "Lambertie" was established there.<ref name=Pringle1998/><ref>[[Eilat Mazar|Mazar, Eilat]].

====Mamluk period====
[[Image:Akhziv01.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Ancient grinding stones at Achziv National Park]]

The Arab village of Az-Zeeb was established during the later Mamluk period with the houses erected using the stones of the destroyed Crusader castle; and thrived throughout the Ottoman rule.  There are descriptions of the castle and village by Arab chroniclers in the 12th and 13th centuries, just prior to and during the rule of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] in the region.

===Ottoman era===
In the early 16th century, az-Zeeb was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its inhabitants cultivated various crops and raised livestock on which they paid taxes to the Ottoman authorities.  According to the 1596 [[Defter|tax records]], it was a village in the ''[[nahiya]]'' (subdistrict) of Akka, part of  [[Sanjak Safad]] with a population of 132 households and 27 bachelors and an estimated total of 875 persons.  All were [[Muslim]].  The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on several agricultural items including, wheat, barley, "summer crops", fruits, cotton, beehives, goats, and water buffalo; a total of 23,669 [[akçe]].  All of the revenue went to a [[waqf]].<ref>Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 192; quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 35</ref><ref>Note that Rhode, 1979, p.

====Political unrest====
In 1946, [[The Jewish Resistance Movement]] attempted to blow up the railroad bridge over the creek at Achziv in an operation known as [[Night of the Bridges]].  A monument to the 14 soldiers killed there was erected on the site.

===1948 War===
[[File:Az-Zib.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Az-Zeeb 1948]]

Just before the official end to Mandate rule on May 14, 1948 and the start of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], az-Zeeb was captured by the [[Haganah]]'s [[Carmeli Brigade]], being one of the main places targeted in [[Operation Ben-Ami]].  According to Haganah accounts, the residents immediately "fled upon the appearance of [[Jew]]ish forces, and the Haganah command decided to hold on to [it]."  However, [[Israel]]i historian [[Benny Morris]] states that the Haganah had a "long account" with az-Zeeb because it was a center of Arab resistance and that most of the inhabitants fled after the village was hit with a mortar barrage by the Haganah.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C&pg=PR17 xvii], ''Village #79''; Morris, 2004, p. Also gives the cause for depopulation</ref><ref name="Khalidi2" />  Morris writes that two Haganah companies reported in mid-May 1948 that they were "attacking al Zib with the aim of blowing up the village".<ref>Morris, 2004, p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C&pg=PA347 347]</ref>  Eyewitness accounts from among the villagers indicate that they mistook the incoming Israeli forces for Arab reinforcements because they had donned red and white ''[[keffiyeh]]s'', and that these forces quickly overwhelmed the local militia of 35-40 men.  Many of the inhabitants fled to [[Lebanon]] or nearby villages, but many also remained in az-Zeeb until they were relocated by the Israeli authorities to the Arab coastal town of [[Mazra'a]].  Carmeli Brigade Commander [[Moshe Carmel]] ordered az-Zeeb to be razed to the ground to "punish" the villagers and ensure they could not return.<ref>Nazzal, 1978, pp. 55-57, quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.36.</ref>  Villagers later complained that the Haganah had (as in [[al-Sumayriyya]] and [[al-Bassa]]) "molested or violated" a number of women.<ref>Morris, 2004, p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C&pg=PA253 253]</ref><ref>Benvenisti, 2000, p. [https://archive.org/details/sacredlandscapeb00benvrich/page/139 139]</ref>

The [[Israel]]i localities of [[Sa'ar]] and [[Gesher HaZiv]] were established on the village lands in 1948 and 1949.  A domed [[mosque]] from the village has since been restored and serves as a tourist site, and the house of the last [[mukhtar]] (village headman) is now a museum.

Achziv became an [[National parks and nature reserves of Israel|Israeli national park]].  According to [[Walid Khalidi]] in 1992: <blockquote>
All that remains of the village is the mosque, which has been restored for tourism, and the house of the ''mukhtar'' Mahmoud Husayn Ataya, which is now a museum.  The house is relatively large and made of masonry.  The stone mosque has a dome and a large decorative arch on the front facade.<ref name="Khalidi2" />
</blockquote>

==Archaeology==
Remnants of ancient Achziv, now known as Tel Achziv, are located on a sandstone mound between two streams, Kziv on the north and Shaal on the south, close to the border with Lebanon. An ancient port was located on the coast, and another secondary port is located 700 m to the south. [[Archaeology of Israel|Archeological excavations]] have revealed that a walled city existed at the location from the Middle Bronze period.
