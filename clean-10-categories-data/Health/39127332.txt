'''High-altitude adaptation in humans''' is an instance of [[evolutionary adaptation|evolutionary modification]] in certain human populations, including those of [[Tibetan people|Tibet]] in Asia, the [[Andes]] of the Americas, and [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] in Africa, who have acquired the ability to survive at extremely high [[altitudes]]. This adaptation means irreversible, [[adaptive evolution|long-term physiological responses]] to high-altitude environments, associated with heritable [[ethology|behavioural]] and [[mutation|genetic changes]]. While the rest of the human population would suffer serious health consequences, the indigenous inhabitants of these regions thrive well in the highest parts of the world. These people have undergone extensive physiological and genetic changes, particularly in the regulatory systems of oxygen [[respiratory system|respiration]] and blood [[circulatory system|circulation]], when compared to the general lowland population.<ref name=fris>{{cite book|author=Frisancho AR|title=Human Adaptation and Accommodation|year=1993|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-K_SYHBo42MC|pages=175–301 |isbn =978-0472095117|publisher=University of Michigan Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author=Hillary Mayell |title=Three High-Altitude Peoples, Three Adaptations to Thin Air|date=24 February 2004 | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.in/news/2004/02/0224_040225_evolution.html |work=National Geographic News |publisher=National Geographic Society |access-date=1 September 2013}}</ref>

Instead, the Tibetans inhale more air with each breath and breathe more rapidly than either sea-level populations or Andeans. Tibetans have better [[oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] at birth, enlarged lung volumes throughout life, and a higher capacity for [[physical exercise|exercise]]. They show a sustained increase in [[brain|cerebral]] blood flow, lower haemoglobin concentration, and less susceptibility to [[chronic mountain sickness]] than other populations, due to their longer history of high-altitude habitation.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Moore LG, Niermeyer S, Zamudio S|year=1998

===Andeans===

In contrast to the Tibetans, the Andean highlanders, who have been living at high altitudes for no more than 11,000 years, show different pattern of haemoglobin adaptation. Their haemoglobin concentration is higher compared to those of lowlander population, which also happens to lowlanders moving to high altitude. When they spend some weeks in the lowland their haemoglobin drops to average of other people. This shows only temporary and reversible acclimatisation. However, in contrast to lowland people, they do have increased oxygen level in their haemoglobin, that is, more oxygen per blood volume than other people. This confers an ability to carry more oxygen in each red blood cell, making a more effective transport of oxygen in their body, while their breathing is essentially at the same rate.<ref name=beall07 /> This enables them to overcome hypoxia and normally reproduce without risk of death for the mother or baby. The Andean highlanders are known from the 16th-century missionaries that their reproduction had always been normal, without any effect in the [[fecundity|giving birth]] or the risk for early pregnancy loss, which are common to hypoxic stress.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vitzthum |first1=Virginia J. |title=Fifty fertile years: anthropologists' studies of reproduction in high altitude natives |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=179–189 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22357 |pmid=23382088|s2cid=41726341 }}</ref> They have developmentally acquired enlarged residual lung volume and its associated increase in [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] area, which are supplemented with increased tissue thickness and moderate increase in [[red blood cells]].

===Ethiopians===

The peoples of the [[Ethiopian highlands]] also live at extremely high altitudes, around {{convert|3000|m|ft}} to {{convert|3500|m|ft}}. Highland Ethiopians exhibit elevated haemoglobin levels, like Andeans and lowlander peoples at high altitudes, but do not exhibit the Andeans’ increase in oxygen content of haemoglobin.<ref>{{cite journal| author =Beall CM |year=2006|title=Andean, Tibetan, and Ethiopian patterns of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia |journal=Integr Comp Biol |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=18–24 |pmid=21672719 |doi=10.1093/icb/icj004|citeseerx=10.1.1.595.7464}}</ref> Among healthy individuals, the average haemoglobin concentrations are 15.9 and 15.0 g/dl for males and females respectively (which is lower than normal, almost similar to the Tibetans), and an average oxygen saturation of haemoglobin is 95.3% (which is higher than average, like the Andeans).<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Beall CM, Decker MJ, Brittenham GM, Kushner I, Gebremedhin A, Strohl KP|year=2002 |title=An Ethiopian pattern of human adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=99 |issue=26 |pages=17215–17218 |pmid=12471159 |pmc=139295 |doi=10.1073/pnas.252649199 |bibcode=2002PNAS...9917215B}}</ref>  Additionally, Ethiopian highlanders do not exhibit any significant change in blood circulation of the brain, which has been observed among the Peruvian highlanders (and attributed to their frequent altitude-related illnesses).<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Claydon VE, Gulli G, Slessarev M, Appenzeller O, Zenebe G, Gebremedhin A, Hainsworth R|year=2008|title=Cerebrovascular responses to hypoxia and hypocapnia in Ethiopian high altitude dwellers  |journal=Stroke |volume=39 |issue=2|pages=336–342 |pmid=18096845  |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.491498|doi-access=free}}</ref> Yet, similar to the Andeans and Tibetans, the Ethiopian highlanders are immune to the extreme dangers posed by high-altitude environment, and their pattern of adaptation is definitely unique from that of other highland peoples.<ref name=hor />

==Genetic basis==

The underlying [[molecular evolution]] of high-altitude adaptation has been explored and understood fairly recently.<ref name=mue /> Depending on the geographical and environmental pressures, high-altitude adaptation involves different genetic patterns, some of which
have evolved quite recently. For example, Tibetan adaptations became prevalent in the past 3,000 years, a rapid example of [[recent human evolution]]. At the turn of the 21st century, it was reported that the genetic make-up of the respiratory components of the Tibetan and the Ethiopian populations are significantly different.<ref name=bea00 />

=== Tibetans ===

Substantial evidence in Tibetan highlanders suggests that variation in haemoglobin and [[oxygen saturation|blood-oxygen]] levels are adaptive as [[Fitness (biology)|Darwinian fitness]]. It has been documented that Tibetan women with a high likelihood of possessing one to two [[allele]]s for high blood-oxygen content (which is odd for normal women) had more surviving children; the higher the oxygen capacity, the lower the infant mortality.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Beall CM, Song K, Elston RC, Goldstein MC|year=2004 |title=Higher offspring survival among Tibetan women with high oxygen saturation genotypes residing at {{convert|4000|m|ft}}|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=101|issue=39 |pages=14300–14304 |pmid=15353580|pmc=521103 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0405949101 |bibcode=2004PNAS..10114300B }}</ref> In 2010, for the first time, the genes responsible for the unique adaptive traits were identified following genome sequencing of 50 Tibetans and 40 [[Han Chinese]] from [[Beijing]]. Initially, the strongest signal of natural selection detected was a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia, called endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (''[[EPAS1]]''). It was found that one [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) at ''EPAS1'' shows a 78% frequency difference between Tibetan and mainland Chinese samples, representing the fastest genetic change observed in any human gene to date. Hence, Tibetan adaptation to high altitude becomes the fastest process of [[phenotype|phenotypically observable]] evolution in humans,<ref>{{cite web|author1=Native Village Youth |author2=Education news |title=Tibetans evolved at fastest pace ever measured |url=http://www.nativevillage.org/Archives/2011%20Archives/MAY%202011%20News/Tibetans%20Evolved%20at%20Fastest%20Pace%20Ever%20Measured.htm | date=May 2011|access-date=2013-04-15}}</ref> which is estimated to occur a few thousand years ago, when the Tibetans split up from the mainland Chinese population.

[[Mutations]] in ''EPAS1'', at higher frequency in Tibetans than their Han neighbours, correlate with decreased haemoglobin concentrations among the Tibetans, which is the hallmark of their adaptation to hypoxia. Simultaneously, two genes, egl nine homolog 1 (''[[EGLN1]]'') (which inhibits haemoglobin production under high oxygen concentration) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (''[[PPARA]]''), were also identified to be positively selected in relation to decreased haemoglobin nature in the Tibetans.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Simonson TS, Yang Y, Huff CD, Yun H, Qin G, Witherspoon DJ, Bai Z, Lorenzo FR, Xing J, Jorde LB, Prchal JT, Ge R|year=2010 |title=Genetic evidence for high-altitude adaptation in Tibet |journal=Science |volume=329 |issue=5987|pages=72–75 |pmid=20466884 |doi=10.1126/science.1189406 |bibcode=2010Sci...329...72S |s2cid=45471238 }}</ref>

===Andeans===

The patterns of genetic adaptation among the Andeans are largely distinct from those of the Tibetan, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions.

===Ethiopians===

The adaptive mechanism of Ethiopian highlanders is quite different. This is probably because their migration to the highland was relatively early; for example, the [[amhara people|Amhara]] have inhabited altitudes above {{convert|2500|m|ft}} for at least 5,000 years and altitudes around {{convert|2000|m|ft}} to {{convert|2400|m|ft}} for more than 70,000 years.<ref>{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Human technical behavior in the African Middle Stone Age: The lithic assemblange of Porc-Epic Cave (Dire Dawa, Ethiopia)|journal=African Archaeological Review|volume=22|issue=4|pages=177–197|doi=10.1007/s10437-006-9000-7|author=Pleurdeau D|s2cid=162259548}}</ref> Genomic analysis of two ethnic groups, Amhara and [[oromo people|Oromo]], revealed that gene variations associated with haemoglobin difference among Tibetans or other variants at the same [[locus (genetics)|gene location]] do not influence the adaptation in Ethiopians.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Alkorta-Aranburu G, Beall CM, Witonsky DB, Gebremedhin A, Pritchard JK, Di Rienzo A|year=2012 |title=The genetic architecture of adaptations to high altitude in Ethiopia |journal=PLOS Genetics |volume=8|issue=12|pages=e1003110|pmid=23236293| pmc=3516565 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003110|arxiv=1211.3053 }}</ref> Identification of specific genes further reveals that several candidate genes are involved in Ethiopians, including ''[[CBARA1]]'', ''[[VAV3]]'', ''[[ARNT2]]'' and ''[[THRB]]''.
