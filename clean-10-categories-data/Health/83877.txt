In other contexts, enemas are used by some alternative health therapies, used for enjoyment, chiefly as part of sexual activities, but also in sadomasochism, as well as simply for pleasure, used to intoxicate with alcohol, used to administer drugs for both recreational and religious reasons, and used for punishment.

== Medical usage ==
{{Columns-list}}

The principal medical usages of enemas are:

=== Bowel cleansing ===
==== Acute treatments ====
As [[bowel]] stimulants, enemas are employed for the same purposes as orally administered [[laxative]]s: To relieve [[constipation]]; To treat [[fecal impaction]]; To empty the colon prior to a medical procedure such as a [[colonoscopy]]. A large volume of enema<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/high%20enema|title=high enema |website=Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref> can be given to cleanse as much of the colon as possible of feces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://intranet.tdmu.edu.ua/data/kafedra/internal/meds/prac_skills_alg/Care%20of%20patients/Administering%20an%20Enema.htm |title=Administering an Enema |website=Care of patients |date=14 July 2015 |publisher=Ternopil State Medical University |access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peoi.org/Courses/Coursesen/nursepractice/ch/ch12e1.html |title=Types of Enemas |website=Fundamentals of Nursing Practice |publisher=Professional Education, Testing and Certification Organization International |author= Rhodora Cruz |access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref> However, a low enema is generally useful only for stool in the rectum, not in the intestinal tract.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/low%20enema|title=low enema |website=Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref>

Such enemas' mechanism consists of the volume of the liquid causing rapid expansion of the intestinal tract in conjunction with, in the case of certain solutions, irritation of the intestinal [[mucosa]] which stimulates peristalsis and lubricates the stool to encourage a bowel movement.<ref name=Nursing_and_Allied_Health/> In order for the enema to be effective the patient should retain the solution for five to ten minutes, as tolerated.<ref name=Biology_Online_Dictionary/><ref name=Nursing_and_Allied_Health/> or, as some nursing textbooks recommend, for five to fifteen minutes or as long as possible.<ref name=Safety_and_effectiveness/>

===== Large volume enemas =====
[[File:Soapsuds Enemas.jpg|thumb|Soapsuds enemas, in a can with a nozzle typical for a cleansing enema, and in a contrast enema bag with a barium nozzle.]]

The colon dilates and expands when a large volume of liquid is injected into it, and the colon reacts to that sudden expansion with general contractions, [[Peristalsis#Large intestine|peristalsis]], propelling its contents toward the rectum.<ref name= Biology_Online_Dictionary />

For relieving occasional constipation, a large volume enema may be used in a home setting, although for recurring or severe cases of constipation medical care may be required.<ref name= Biology_Online_Dictionary />

====== Water-based solutions ======

Plain water can be used, simply functioning mechanically to expand the colon, thus prompting evacuation.

[[Castile soap]] is commonly added because its irritation of the colon's lining increases the urgency to defecate.<ref name=Safety_and_effectiveness>{{cite journal|title=Safety and effectiveness of large-volume enema solutions |author= MarileeSchmelzer, Lawrence R.Schiller, Richard Meyer, Susan M.Rugari, PattiCase|date=November 2004 |journal=Applied Nursing Research |doi=10.1016/j.apnr.2004.09.010 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=265–274|pmid= 15573335}}</ref> However, liquid handsoaps and detergents should not be used.<ref name=Biology_Online_Dictionary/>

[[Glycerol]] is a specific bowel mucosa irritant serving to induce peristalsis via a [[Osmotic laxative|hyperosmotic effect]].<ref name= Glycerol>{{cite web |url= https://www.drugs.com/cdi/glycerin-enema.html |title= Glycerin Enema |publisher= Drugs.com | access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> It is used in a dilute solution, e.g., 5%.<ref>{{Citation | author = E.

[[saline (medicine)#Normal|Normal saline]] is least irritating to the colon, at the opposite end of the spectrum. Like plain water, it simply functions mechanically to expand the colon, but having a neutral concentration gradient, it neither draws [[electrolyte]]s from the body, as happens with plain water, nor draws water into the colon, as occurs with phosphates. Thus, a salt water solution can be used when a longer period of retention is desired, such as to soften an impaction.

The term ''retrograde irrigation'' distinguishes this procedure from the [[Malone antegrade continence enema]], where irrigation fluid is introduced into the colon proximal to the anus via a surgically created irrigation port.

===== Bowel management =====
{{Main|Bowel management}}
Patients who have a bowel disability, a medical condition which impairs control of [[defecation]], e.g., fecal incontinence or constipation,<ref name="Bowel management definition">{{cite web|title=Bowel Management After Spinal Cord Injury|url=http://www.sci-info-pages.com/bowel.html|website=sci-info-pages.com|language=en}}</ref> can use bowel management techniques to choose a predictable time and place to evacuate.<ref name="Bowel management definition"/> Without bowel management, such persons might either suffer from the feeling of not getting relief, or they might soil themselves.<ref name="Bowel management definition"/>

While simple techniques might include a controlled [[Healthy diet|diet]] and establishing a toilet routine,<ref name="Bowel management definition"/> a daily enema can be taken to empty the colon, thus preventing unwanted and uncontrolled bowel movements that day.<ref name="ReferenceA">Peña A, Guardino K, Tovilla JM, Levitt MA, Rodriguez G, Torres R Bowel management for fecal incontinence in patients with anorectal malformations Pediatr.

=== Contrast (X-ray) ===

[[File:Barium Contrast Enema.jpg|thumb|A barium enema in a disposable bag manufactured for that purpose]]

In a [[lower gastrointestinal series]] an enema that may contain [[Barium sulphate#Radiocontrast agent|barium sulfate]] powder or a water-soluble contrast agent is used in the [[Röntgen ray|radiological]] imaging of the bowel. Called a ''barium enema'', such enemas are sometimes the only practical way to ''view'' the colon in a relatively safe manner.<ref name=NIH_barium />

Failure to expel all of the barium may cause constipation or possible impaction<ref name=Hopkins_Barium>{{cite web |url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/test_procedures/gastroenterology/barium_enema_92,P07687 |title=aGastroenterology Tests and Procedures &ndash; Barium Enema |work=Health Library |publisher=Johns Hopkins School of Medicine |access-date=2019-04-01 }}</ref> and a patient who has no bowel movement for more than two days or is unable to pass gas rectally should promptly inform a physician and may require an enema or laxative.<ref name=SW_Med_Center>{{cite web |url=http://www.swmedcenter.com/index.php/services-2/diagnostic-imaging/bariumgastroview-enema/ |title=Barium/Gastroview Enema |work=Our Services |publisher=Southwest Medical Center in Liberal, Kansas, USA |access-date=2019-04-01 }}</ref>

=== Medication administration ===

The administration of substances into the bloodstream. This may be done in situations where it is undesirable or impossible to deliver a medication by mouth, such as [[antiemetic]]s given to reduce [[nausea]] (though not many antiemetics are delivered by enema). Additionally, several anti-angiogenic agents, which work better without digestion, can be safely administered via a gentle enema.

The topical administration of medications into the rectum, such as [[corticosteroids]] and [[mesalazine]] used in the treatment of [[inflammatory bowel disease]]. Administration by enema avoids having the medication pass through the entire [[gastrointestinal tract]], therefore simplifying the delivery of the medication to the affected area and limiting the amount that is absorbed into the bloodstream.

Rectal corticosteroid enemas are sometimes used to treat mild or moderate ulcerative colitis. They also may be used along with systemic (oral or injection) corticosteroids or other medicines to treat severe disease or mild to moderate disease that has spread too far to be treated effectively by medicine inserted into the rectum alone.

=== Inhibiting pathological defecation ===

* [[Traveller's diarrhea]]’s symptoms treated with an enema of [[sodium butyrate]], [[organic acid]]s, and A-300 [[silicon dioxide]] can be successfully decreased with lack of observed side effects.<ref name= Travellers_Diarrhea/>
* [[Shigellosis]] treatment benefits from adjunct therapy with butyrate enemas, promoting healing of the rectal mucosa and inflammation, but not helping in clinical recovery from shigellosis. Use of an 80 ml of a sodium butyrate isotonic enema administered every 12 hours has been studied and found effective.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Efficacy of sodium butyrate adjunct therapy in shigellosis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial |journal = BMC Infectious Diseases|volume = 12|pages = 111|date = 10 May 2012 |publisher = U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH) |pmc = 3447723|last1 = Raqib|first1 = R.|last2 = Sarker|first2 = P.|last3 = Mily|first3 = A.|last4 = Alam|first4 = N.

== Adverse effects ==

Improper administration of an enema can cause electrolyte imbalance (with repeated enemas) or ruptures to the bowel or rectal tissues resulting in internal [[bleeding]]. However, these occurrences are rare in healthy, [[sobriety|sober]] adults. Internal bleeding or rupture may leave the individual exposed to infections from intestinal bacteria. Blood resulting from tears in the colon may not always be visible, but can be distinguished if the feces are unusually dark or have a red hue. If intestinal rupture is suspected, medical assistance should be obtained immediately.<ref name=Nursing_and_Allied_Health>{{Cite journal |title = Encyclopedia of Nursing and Allied Health |first = ME |last = Martelli |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gGENH/is_/ai_2699003276.htm |access-date = 11 January 2008 |format =– <sup>[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&lr=&q=author%3AMartelli+intitle%3AEncyclopedia+of+Nursing+and+Allied Health&as_publication=&as_ylo=&as_yhi=&btnG=Search Scholar search]</sup> |publisher = [[FindArticles]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080123073414/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gGENH/is_/ai_2699003276.htm |archive-date = 23 January 2008 |url-status = dead }}</ref> Frequent use of enemas can cause laxative dependency.<ref>https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-14831/fleet-enema-rectal/details</ref><ref>https://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/enemas-for-constipation/</ref>

The enema tube and solution may stimulate the [[vagus nerve]], which may trigger an [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] such as [[bradycardia]].

Enemas should not be used if there is an undiagnosed [[abdominal pain]] since the peristalsis of the bowel can cause an inflamed [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] to [[Appendicitis|rupture]].

== History ==

=== Etymology ===

''Enema'' entered the English language c. 1675 from Latin in which, in the 15th century,<ref name=Free_Dictionary_Enema/> it was first used in the sense of a rectal injection,<ref name=Merriam-Webster_Enema/> from Greek ἔνεμα (énema), “injection”, itself from ἐνίηναι (enienai) "to send in, inject", from ἐν (en), "in" + ἱέναι (hienai), "to send, throw".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=enema |title=enema (n.) |work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |publisher=Douglas Harper of the [[LNP Media Group]] |access-date=2019-04-15 }}</ref>

''Clyster'' entered the English language in the late 14th century from Old French or Latin, from Greek κλυστήρ (klyster), "syringe", itself from κλύζειν (klyzein), "to wash out".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=clyster |title=clyster (n.) |work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |publisher=Douglas Harper of the [[LNP Media Group]] |access-date=2019-12-29 }}</ref> Also spelled ''glister'' in the 17th century, rarely ''cloiste''" or ''clister'',{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} it is a generally archaic word for enema, more particularly for enemas administered using a ''clyster syringe''.

=== Ancient and medieval ===
==== Africa ====

The first mention of the enema in medical literature is in the Ancient Egyptian [[Ebers Papyrus]] ({{circa|1550}} BCE). One of the many types of medical specialists was an Iri, the Shepherd of the Anus. Many medications were administered by enemas.<ref>Magner, ''A History of Medicine'':31</ref> There was a Keeper of the Royal Rectum who may have primarily been the pharaoh's enema maker. The god [[Thoth]], according to Egyptian mythology, invented the enema.<ref>Magner, ''A History of Medicine'':26</ref>

[[File:Afrikanische Holzplastik.jpg|thumb|Pressure enema from an animal bladder (African wooden sculpture, 19th century)]]

In parts of Africa the [[calabash]] gourd is used traditionally to administer enemas. On the Ivory Coast the narrow neck of the gourd filled with water is inserted the patient's rectum and the contents are then injected by means of an attendant's forcible oral inflation, or, alternatively, a patient may self-administer the enema by using suction to create a negative pressure in the gourd, placing a finger at the opening, and then upon anal insertion, removing the finger to allow atmospheric pressure to effect the flow. Along the upper Congo River an enema apparatus is made by making a hole in one end of the gourd for filling it, and using a resin to attach a hollow cane to the gourd's neck. The cane is inserted into the anus of the patient who is in a posture that allows gravity to effect infusion of the fluid.<ref>Friedenwald & Morrison, 'Part I:75-76</ref>

==== Americas ====

The [[Olmec]] from their middle preclassic period (10th through 7th centuries BCE) through the Spanish Conquest used trance-inducing substances ceremonially, and these were ingested via, among other routes, enemas administered using jars.

As further described below in [[Enema#Religious rituals|religious rituals]], the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] in their late classic age (7th through 10th centuries CE) used enemas for, at least, ritual purposes, Mayan sculpture and ceramics from that period depicting scenes in which, injected by syringes made of gourd and clay, ritual hallucinogenic enemas were taken.<ref name=Hallucinogenic_pre-Columbian>{{cite journal |title=Hallucinogenic drugs in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=42–49 |author=F.J.Carod-Artal |date=2011-07-01 |journal=Neurología |publisher=Science Direct |doi=10.1016/j.nrleng.2011.07.010 |pmid=21893367 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In the Xibalban court of the God D, whose worship included ritual cult paraphernal, the Maya illustrated the use of a characteristic enema bulb syringe by female attendants administering clysters ritually.<ref>Parsons and Carlson:92</ref><ref name="pmid3528674">{{cite journal |vauthors = de Smet PA, Hellmuth NM |title = A multidisciplinary approach to ritual enema scenes on ancient Maya pottery |journal = J Ethnopharmacol |volume = 16 |issue = 2–3 |pages = 213–62 |year = 1986 |pmid = 3528674 |doi = 10.1016/0378-8741(86)90091-7 }}</ref>

For combating illness and discomfort of the digestive tract, the Mayan also employed enemas, as documented during the colonial period, e.g., in the [[Florentine Codex]].<ref name=Hallucinogenic_pre-Columbian/>

The [[indigenous peoples of the Americas#North America|indigenous peoples of North America]] employed [[tobacco smoke enema]]s to stimulate respiration, injecting the smoke using a rectal tube.<ref>{{Citation |last1 = Hurt |first1 = Raymond |last2 = Barry |first2 = J.

A rubber bag connected with a conical nozzle, at an early period, was in use among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous peoples of South America]]  as an enema syringe,<ref>Friedenwald & Morrison, Part II:261</ref> and the rubber enema bag with a connecting tube and ivory tip remained in use by them while in Europe a syringe was still the usual means for conducting an enema.<ref>Friedenwald & Morrison, Part II:240</ref>

==== Asia ====

In Babylonia, by 600 BCE, enemas were in use, although it appears that initially they were in use because of a belief that the demon of disease would, by means of an enema, be driven out of the body.<ref name=History_Asia_Misc>Friedenwald & Morrison, Part I:77</ref> Babylonian and Assyrian tablets c. 600 BCE bear cuneiform inscriptions referring to enemas.<ref name=Comparative_Clinical_Study>{{cite web|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/300071|title=A Comparative Clinical Study of Several Enemas|author1=Sidney G.

In China, c. 200 CE, [[Zhang Zhongjing]]<!--->Redirected from Chang Chung-ching, the name used in the reference---> was the first to employ enemas. "Secure a large pig's bile and mix with a small quantity of vinegar. Insert a bamboo tube three or four inches long into the rectum and inject the mixture" are his directions, according to [[Wu Lien-teh]].<ref>Friedenwald & Morrison, 'Part I:77-80</ref>

In India, in the fifth century CE, [[Sushruta]] enumerates the enema syringe among 121 surgical instruments described. Early Indian physicians' enema apparatus consisted of a tube of bamboo, ivory, or horn attached to the scrotum of a deer, goat, or ox.<ref name=History_Asia_Misc/>

In Persia, [[Avicenna]] (980-1037 A. D.) is credited with the introduction of the "clyster-purse" or collapsible portion of an enema outfit made from ox skin or silk cloth and emptied by squeezing with the hands.<ref name=Comparative_Clinical_Study/>

==== Europe ====

[[Hippocrates]] (460-370 BCE) frequently mentions enemas, e.g., "if the previous food which the patient has recently eaten should not have gone down, give an enema if the patient be strong and in the prime of life, but if he be weak, a suppository should be administered, should the bowels be not well moved on their own accord."<ref>Friedenwald & Morrison, 'Part I:71</ref>

In the first century BCE the [[Ancient Greek medicine|Greek physician]] [[Asclepiades of Bithynia]] wrote "Treatment consists merely of three elements: drink, food, and the enema".<ref>Scarborough, ''The Drug Lore of ASCLEPIADES of Bithynia'':44</ref> Also, he contended that indigestion is caused by particles of food that are too big and his prescribed treatment was proper amounts of food and wine followed by an enema which would remove the improper food doing the damage.<ref>Scarborough, ''The Drug Lore of ASCLEPIADES of Bithynia'':46</ref>

In the second century CE the Greek physician [[Soranus (Greek physician)|Soranus]] prescribed, among other techniques, enemas as a safe [[abortion]] method,<ref>{{cite book|author=Soranus|others=Translated by Owsei Temkin |title=Soranus' Gynecology|date=1956|publisher=JHU Press|pages=62–67|isbn=9780801843204}}</ref> and the Greek philosopher [[Celsus]] recommended an enema of pearl barley in milk or rose oil with butter as a nutrient for those suffering from dysentery and unable to eat,<ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/21-enemas.pdf |title = Information Sheet:21 Enemas |website = Information Sheets |publisher = Museum of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, London |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306155528/https://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/21-enemas.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-06 |access-date=2020-01-03 }}</ref> and also Galen mentions enemas in several contexts.<ref name=Galen>{{Citation |last = Mattern |first = Susan P. |year = 2008 |title = Galen and the Rhetoric of Healing |publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |location = Johns Hopkins University Press, Maryland, USA |isbn=978-0-8018-8835-9 |pages = 31, 145, 149 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5IXlOC1_liEC }}</ref>

In medieval times appear the first illustrations of enema equipment in the [[Western world]], a clyster syringe consisting of a tube attached to a pump action bulb made of a pig bladder.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}
A simple piston [[syringe]] clyster was in use from the 15th through 19th centuries. This device had its rectal nozzle connected to a syringe with a plunger rather than to a bulb.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

[[File:Clyster syringes.jpg|thumb|A normal clyster syringe ''(front)'' and the nozzle for a syringe designed for self-administration ''(rear)''. The latter avoided the need for a second party to attend an embarrassing procedure.]]

Beginning in the 17th century enema apparatus was chiefly designed for self-administration at home and many were French as enemas enjoyed wide usage in France.<ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical />

In 1694 [[François Mauriceau]] in his early-modern treatise, ''The Diseases of Women with Child,'' records that both midwives and man-midwives commonly administered clysters to labouring mothers just prior to their delivery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Francois Mauriceau (1637-1709) and maternal posture for parturition.

When clyster syringes were in use in Europe, the patient was placed in an appropriate position (kneeling, with the buttocks raised, or lying on the side); a servant or [[apothecary]] would then insert the nozzle into the anus and press the plunger, resulting in the liquid remedy (generally, [[water]], but also some other preparations) being injected into the colon.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Because of the embarrassment a woman might feel when showing her buttocks (and possibly her genitals, depending on the position) to a male apothecary, some contraptions were invented that blocked all from the apothecary's view except for the anal area. Another invention was syringes equipped with a special bent nozzle, which enabled self-administration, thereby eliminating the embarrassment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Clysters were administered for symptoms of constipation and, with more questionable effectiveness, stomach aches and other illnesses.{{when|date=July 2020}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In the 17th century, satirists made physicians a favorite target, resembling [[Molière]]'s caricature whose prescription for anything was "clyster, bleed, purge," or "purge, bleed, clyster.",<ref>Magner, ''A History of Medicine'':218</ref>

More generally, clysters were a theme in the [[burlesque]] comedies of n the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In 1753 an enema bag prepared from a pig's or beef's bladder attached to a tube was described by Johann Jacob Woyts as an alternative to a syringe.<ref>Friedenwald & Morrison, Part II:245</ref>

In the 18th century Europeans began emulating the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas#North America|indigenous peoples of North America's]] use of tobacco smoke enemas to resuscitate drowned people.<ref name=BCMJ>{{cite web |url=https://www.bcmj.org/special-feature/special-feature-tobacco-smoke-enemas |title=Special feature: Tobacco smoke enemas |author=Sterling Haynes, MD |date=December 2012 |work=British Columbia Medical Journal |publisher=Doctors of BC |access-date=2019-03-29 }}</ref> Tobacco resuscitation kits consisting of a pair of bellows and a tube were provided by the Royal Humane Society of London and placed at various points along the Thames.<ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical /> Furthermore, these enemas came to be employed for headaches, respiratory failure, colds, hernias, abdominal cramps, typhoid fever, and cholera outbreaks.<ref name=BCMJ/>

Clysters were a favourite medical treatment in the [[bourgeoisie]] and [[nobility]] of the Western world up to the 19th century. As medical knowledge was fairly limited at the time, purgative clysters were used for a wide variety of [[ailment]]s, the foremost of which were [[stomach ache]]s and constipation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

According to [[Claude de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon]], clysters were so popular at the court of King [[Louis XIV of France]] that the duchess of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] had her servant give her a clyster in front of the King (her [[modesty]] being preserved by an adequate posture) before going to the [[comedy]]. However, he also mentions the astonishment of the King and Mme de Maintenon that she should take it before them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In the 19th century many new types of enema administration equipment were devised, including the bulb enema.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Devices allowing gravity to infuse the solution, like those mentioned above used by South American indigenous people and like the enema bag described by Johann Jacob Woyts, came into common use. These consist of a nozzle at the end of a hose which connects a reservoir, either a bucket or a rubber bag, which is filled with liquid and held or hung above the recipient.<ref name=Royal_Pharmaceutical />

=====Kellogg's enemas=====

In the late 19th century Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]] made sure that the bowel of each and every patient was plied with water, from above and below. His favorite device was an enema machine ("just like one I saw in Germany") that could run fifteen gallons of water through a person's bowel in a matter of seconds. Every water enema was followed by a pint of yogurt—half was eaten, the other half was administered by enema "thus planting the protective germs where they are most needed and may render most effective service." The yogurt served to replace "the intestinal flora" of the bowel, creating what Kellogg claimed was a completely clean intestine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofquackery.com/amquacks/kellogg.htm |title=Dr. John Harvey Kellogg |website=Great American Quacks |publisher=Museum of Quackery |access-date=12 February 2018}}</ref>

==== Pleasure ====
{{Main|Klismaphilia}}
Enjoyment of enemas is known as [[klismaphilia]], which medically is classified as a [[paraphilia]].<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20080224093721/http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/paraphilias.html Paraphilias] from [http://www.psychologytoday.com Psychology Today]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|date=April 1973|title=Klismaphilia: enema as a sexual preference.

Klismaphiles can gain satisfaction of enemas through fantasies, by actually receiving or giving one, or through the process of eliminating steps to being administered one (e.g., under the pretence of being constipated).<ref name="Denko"/> An enema can be an auxiliary to, or even a substitute for, genital [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].<ref>Agnew, 1982</ref><ref name="Denko">{{cite journal|last=Denko|first=JD.|date=April 1976|title=Amplification of the erotic enema deviance|journal=Am J Psychother|volume=30|pages=236–55 | issue=2|pmid=937588|doi=10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.1976.30.2.236}}</ref>

That some women use enemas while masturbating was documented by [[Alfred Kinsey]] in "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female."

==== Rectal douching ====

Another sexual use for enemas is to empty the rectum as a prelude to other anal sexual activities such as [[anal sex]], [[anilingus]], and [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]],<ref name="Agnew, 2000:76">Agnew, 2000:76</ref> possibly reducing risk of infection.

This is different from klismaphilia, in which the enema is enjoyed for itself and as a part of sexual arousal and gratification.<ref name="Agnew, 2000:76"/>

However, great care must be taken as to the amount of alcohol used. Only a small amount is needed as the intestine absorbs the alcohol far more quickly than the stomach.
