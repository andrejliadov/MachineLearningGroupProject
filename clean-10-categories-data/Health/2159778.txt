Within the framework of the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) definition of [[health]] as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, '''reproductive health''', or '''sexual health'''/'''hygiene''', addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/topics/reproductive_health/en/|title=WHO: Reproductive health|access-date=2008-08-19}}</ref>  UN agencies claim sexual and reproductive health includes physical, as well as psychological well-being vis-a-vis sexuality.<ref>{{cite book | url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf | title = International technical guidance on sexuality education: an evidence-informed approach | publisher = UNESCO | year = 2018 | isbn = 978-92-3-100259-5 | location = Paris | pages = 22 }}</ref>

Reproductive health implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying, healthy reproductive system and [[Safer sex|safer sex life]] and that they have the capability to reproduce and the [[Family planning|freedom to decide]] if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women should be [[sex education|informed]] of and have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of [[birth control]]; also access to appropriate [[reproductive medicine|health care services]] of [[sexual medicine|sexual]], [[reproductive medicine]] and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of [[maternal health|women to go safely]] through [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant.

Individuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services. Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, ethnicity, religion, and resources available in their environment. It is possible for example, that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall KS, Moreau C, Trussell J | title = Determinants of and disparities in reproductive health service use among adolescent and young adult women in the United States, 2002-2008 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–67 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22390451 | pmc = 3483992 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2011.300380 }}</ref>

The WHO assessed in 2008 that "Reproductive and sexual ill-health accounts for 20% of the global burden of ill-health for women, and 14% for men."<ref name="WHOstrat2">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/reproductive-health/strategy.htm|title=Reproductive Health Strategy|publisher=World Health Organization | access-date=2008-07-24}}</ref> Reproductive health is a part of [[sexual and reproductive health and rights]]. According to the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA), unmet needs for sexual and reproductive health deprive women of the right to make "crucial choices about their own bodies and futures", affecting family welfare. Women bear and usually nurture children, so their reproductive health is inseparable from gender equality. Denial of such rights also worsens poverty.<ref name="SRH2">{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sexual-reproductive-health|title=Sexual reproductive health|publisher=UN Population Fund}}</ref>

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, fertility starts to drop considerably around the age of 32, and around 37, it has a particularly deep nose dive.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/parenting/pregnancy/baby-after-40.html The Truth About Pregnancy Over 40]</ref> By age 44, chances of spontaneous pregnancy approach zero. As such, women are often told to have children before the age of 35, and pregnancy after 40 is considered a high risk. If pregnancy occurs after the age of 40 (geriatric pregnancy), the woman and baby will be monitored closely for:<ref>[https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/having-a-baby-at-40#fertility-at-40 What You Should Know About Having a Baby at 40]</ref>

[[Adolescent health]] creates a major global burden and has a great deal of additional and diverse complications compared to adult reproductive health such as early pregnancy and parenting issues, difficulties accessing contraception and safe abortions, lack of healthcare access, and high rates of HIV, sexually transmitted infections and mental health issues.

The causes for teenage pregnancy are vast and diverse. In developing countries, young women are pressured to marry for different reasons. One reason is to bear children to help with work, another on a [[dowry system]] to increase the families income, another is due to prearranged marriages. These reasons tie back to financial needs of girls' family, cultural norms, religious beliefs and external conflicts.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Girl Child Marriage: A Persistent Global Women’s Health and Human Rights Violation | title = Global Perspectives on Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Across the Lifecourse | last = Raj | first  = A nita | last2 = Jackson | first2 = Emma | last3 = Dunham | first3 = Serena | name-list-style = vanc | date = 2018| publisher = Springer, Cham | isbn = 9783319604169 | pages = 3–19 | doi=10.1007/978-3-319-60417-6_1 }}</ref>

There is a significant relationship between the quality of maternal services made
available and the greater financial standings of a country.<ref name="Borghi 2002">Borghi, Jo. “Mobilising Domestic Financial Resources for Development.” 2002, doi:10.14217/9781848597655-4-en.</ref> Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia

== Contraception ==
[[File:Pilule_contraceptive.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Combined oral contraceptive pill]]]]
[[File:De_Morbo_Gallico.jpg|thumb|200px|A page from ''De Morbo Gallico'' (On the French Disease), Gabriele Falloppio's treatise on syphilis. Published in 1564, it describes an early use of [[condom]]s.]]

Contraception has been and still remains in some cultures a controversial issue.]]

Access to reproductive health services is very poor in many countries. Women are often unable to access [[maternal health]] services due to lack of knowledge about the existence of such services or lack of [[freedom of movement]]. Some women are subjected to [[forced pregnancy]] and banned from leaving the home. In many countries, women are not allowed to leave home without a male relative or husband, and therefore their ability to access medical services is limited. Therefore, increasing women's autonomy is needed in order to improve reproductive health, however doing may require a cultural shift. According to the WHO, "All women need access to antenatal care in pregnancy, skilled care during childbirth, and care and support in the weeks after childbirth".

The fact that the law allows certain reproductive health services, it does not necessary ensure that such services are actually in use by the people. The availability of contraception, sterilization and abortion is dependent on laws, as well as social, cultural and religious norms. Some countries have liberal laws regarding these issues, but in practice it is very difficult to access such services due to doctors, pharmacists and other social and medical workers being [[conscientious objector]]s.

In developing regions of the world, there are about 214 million women who want to avoid pregnancy but are unable to use safe and effective [[family planning]] methods.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.unfpa.org/family-planning | title=Family planning}}</ref> When taken correctly, the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. However, it does not protect from [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs). Some methods, such as using [[condom]]s, achieve both protection from STIs and unwanted pregnancies. There are also [[natural family planning]] methods, which may be preferred by religious people, but some very conservative religious groups, such as the [[Quiverfull]] movement, oppose these methods too, because they advocate the maximization of procreation.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=https://www.thenation.com/article/arrows-war/ | title=Arrows for the War| journal=The Nation| date=2006-11-09}}</ref> One of the oldest ways to reduce unwanted  pregnancy  is [[coitus interruptus]] - still widely used in the developing world.

There are many types of contraceptives. One type of contraceptive includes barrier methods.<ref name = "NICHD">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/contraception/conditioninfo/types|title=What are the different types of contraception? | work = National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) | access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> One barrier method includes condoms for males and females.<ref name = "NICHD" /> Both types stop sperm from entering the woman's uterus, thereby preventing pregnancy from occurring.<ref name = "NICHD" /> Another type of contraception is the birth control pill, which stops ovulation from occurring by combining the chemicals progestin and estrogen.<ref name = "NICHD" /> Many women use this method of contraception, however they discontinue using it equally as much as they use it.<ref name = "Stevens_2018">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stevens LM | title = "We have to be mythbusters": Clinician attitudes about the legitimacy of patient concerns and dissatisfaction with contraception | journal = Social Science & Medicine | volume = 212 | pages = 145–152 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30031980 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.07.020 }}</ref> One reason for this is because of the side effects that may occur from using the pill, and because some health care providers do not take women's concerns about negative side effects seriously.<ref name = "Stevens_2018" /> The use of the birth control pill is common in western countries, and
two forms of combined oral contraceptives are on the [[World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines]], the most important medications needed in a basic [[health system]].<ref>http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/93142/EML_18_eng.pdf;jsessionid=C5CB19A852D621A6715FF150E2291B8E?sequence=1</ref>

There are many objections to the use of birth control, both historically and in the present day. One argument against birth control usage states that there is no need for birth control to begin with.<ref name = "McAndrews_2015">{{cite journal|last=McAndrews|first=Lawrence|date=Winter 2015|title=Before Roe: Catholics, Nixon, and the Changing Politics of Birth Control.|journal=Fides et Historia|volume=47|pages=24–43|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> This argument was levied in 1968 when Richard Nixon was elected president, and the argument stated that since birth rates were at their lowest point since World War II ended, birth control was not necessary.<ref name = "McAndrews_2015" /> Demographic planning arguments were also the basis of the population policy of  [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] in [[communist Romania]], who adopted a very aggressive [[natalist]] policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people. Such policies consider that coercion is an acceptable means of reaching demographic targets. Religious objections are based on the view that [[premarital sex]] should not happen, while married couples should have as many children as possible. As such, the Catholic Church encourages premarital abstinence from sex.<ref name = "McAndrews_2015" /> This argument was written out in ''Humanae Vitae'', a papal encyclical released in 1968.<ref name = "McAndrews_2015" /> The Catholic Church bases its argument against birth control pills on the basis that birth control pills undermine the natural law of God.<ref name = "Reiterman_1965">{{Cite journal|last=Reiterman|first=Carl|date=1965|title=Birth Control and Catholics.|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=4|issue=2|pages=213–233|jstor=1384139|doi=10.2307/1384139}}</ref> The Catholic Church also argues against birth control on the basis of family size, with Cardinal Mercier of Belgium arguing, &nbsp;"...the duties of conscience are above worldly considerations, and besides, it is the large families who are the best" (Reiterman, 216).<ref name = "Reiterman_1965" /> Another argument states that women should use natural methods of contraception in place of artificial ones, such as having sexual intercourse when one is infertile.<ref name = "McAndrews_2015" />

Support for contraception is based on views such as [[reproductive rights]], [[women's rights]], and the necessity to prevent [[child abandonment]] and [[child poverty]].<ref name="ReferenceA">https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/family-planning-contraception</ref><ref>https://www.unfpa.org/resources/rights-contraceptive-information-and-services-women-and-adolescents</ref> The World Health Organization  states that "By preventing unintended pregnancy, family planning /contraception prevents deaths of mothers and children".<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

A [[Sexually transmitted infection]] (STI) --previously known as a ''sexually transmitted disease (STD)'' or ''venereal disease (VD)--'' is an infection that has a significant likelihood of transmission between humans by means of [[sexual activity]]. The CDC analyses the eight most common STI's: [[Chlamydia trachomatis|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], [[hepatitis B virus]] (HBV), [[herpes simplex virus]] type 2 ([[Hsv 2|HSV-2]]), human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV/AIDS|HIV]]), [[Human papillomavirus HPV|human papillomavirus (HPV)]], [[syphilis]], and [[trichomoniasis]].<ref name="CDC_2013">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/sti-estimates-fact-sheet-Feb-2013.pdf | title= Incidence, Prevalence, and Cost of Sexually Transmitted Infections in the United States | date = February 2013 | work = CDC STI Fact Sheet | publisher = United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) }}</ref>

However, the study concluded that the United States has led to an excess in infections, treatment costs, and deaths, even when interventions do not improve over all survival rates.<ref name="Shah_2016" />

There is a profound reduction on STI rates once those who are sexually active are educated about transmissions, condom promotion, interventions targeted at key and vulnerable populations through a comprehensive [[Sex education]] courses or programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sexually-transmitted-infections-(stis)|title=Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)|website=World Health Organization |access-date=2018-04-30}}</ref> South Africa's policy addresses the needs of women at risk for HIV and who are HIV positive as well as their partners and children.

Articles from the World Health Organization call legal [[abortion]] a [[Fundamental rights|fundamental right]] of women regardless of where they live, and argue that [[unsafe abortion]] is a silent [[pandemic]].

The [[Maputo Protocol]], which was adopted by the [[African Union]] in the form of a protocol to the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], states at  Article 14 (Health and Reproductive Rights) that: "(2).

When negotiating the Cairo Programme of Action at the 1994 [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD), the issue was so contentious that delegates eventually decided to omit any recommendation to legalize abortion, instead advising governments to provide proper post-abortion care and to invest in programs that will decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud/page/6 6] |url=https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud |url-access=registration |quote=reproductive rights. }}</ref>

The [[Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women]] considers the criminalization of abortion a "violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights" and a form of "gender based violence"; paragraph 18 of its ''General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19'' states that: "Violations of women’s sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of  safe  abortion  and  post abortion  care,  forced  continuation  of pregnancy,  abuse  and mistreatment  of  women  and  girls  seeking  sexual  and  reproductive  health  information, goods and services, are forms of [[violence against women|gender based violence]] that, depending on   the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, [[inhuman or degrading treatment]]."<ref name="tbinternet.ohchr.org">{{cite web | title = General recommendation No. 35 on gender-based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19 | url = http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/1_Global/CEDAW_C_GC_35_8267_E.pdf | date = 30 October 2018 | work = Human Rights Committee | publisher = United Nations }}</ref> The same ''General Recommendation'' also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal:

In 2008, the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], a group comprising members from 47 European countries, has adopted a resolution calling for the decriminalization of abortion within reasonable gestational limits and guaranteed access to safe abortion procedures. The nonbinding resolution was passed on April 16 by a vote of 102 to 69.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2008/04/council-europe-urges-member-states-decriminalize-abortion | title=Council of Europe Urges Member States to Decriminalize Abortion| date=2008-04-21}}</ref>

Accesses to abortion is not only a question of legality, but also an issue of overcoming de ''facto barriers'', such as [[conscientious objection]]s from medical stuff, high prices, lack of knowledge about the law, lack of access to medical care (especially in [[rural areas]]). The ''de facto'' inability of women to access abortion even in countries where it is legal is highly controversial because it results in a situation where women have rights only on paper not in practice; the UN in its 2017 resolution on ''Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence'' urged states to guarantee access to "safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/170 | title=United Nations Official Document}}</ref>

There are two primary arguments for maintaining legalized abortion today in the U.S. The first is recognizing the full citizenship of women.<ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?">{{cite book |last1=Rose |first1=Melody |title=Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?: Abortion Politics in the United States |date=2007 |publisher=CQ Press}}</ref><ref name="Reproductive Politics">{{cite book |last1=Solinger |first1=Rickie |title=Reproductive Politics: What Everyone Needs to Know |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> The Roe v. Wade court case on abortion compared the citizenship of women and fetuses <ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /> Because the Constitution defines born people as citizens, Justice Harry Blackmun ruled that fetuses were not citizens.<ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /> The citizenship of women is emphasized because fetuses are not individual entities that can exist without the woman.<ref name="Reproductive Politics" /> Another reason why the full citizenship of women is defined by advocates for abortion is that it recognizes the right of women to manage their own bodies.<ref name="Reproductive Politics" /> Fertility affects women's bodies. The argument for abortion prevents others from making decisions that alter a woman's body.<ref name="Reproductive Politics"/> Pro-choice advocates also attempt to confirm that state-mandated education or other outside biases don't attempt to influence these decisions.<ref name="Reproductive Politics" /> Feminists argue that women throughout history have had to justify their citizenship politically and socially.<ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /> The right to manage one's own body is a matter of health, safety, and respect.<ref name="Reproductive Politics" /> The citizenship of women and the right to manage their own bodies is a societal confirmation that feminists highlight as a pro-choice justification.<ref name="Reproductive Politics" />

The second primary argument to uphold legalized abortion and creating better access to it is the necessity of abortion and the health and safety of pregnant women.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McBride |first1=Dorothy |last2=Keys |first2=Jennifer  | name-list-style = vanc |title=Abortion in the United States: a Reference Handbook |date=2018 |publisher=ABC-CLIO, LLC}}</ref><ref name = "Krannich_1980">{{cite journal |last1=Krannich |first1=Richard |title=Abortion in the United States: Past, Present, and Future Trends |journal=Family Relations |date=1980 |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=365–374 |jstor=583858|doi=10.2307/583858 }}</ref> There are two events that largely changed the course of public opinion about abortion in the U.S.<ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /><ref name="Reproductive Politics"/> The first is Sherry Finkbine, who was denied access to an abortion by the board of obstetrician-gynecologists at her local hospital.<ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /> Although she was privileged enough to afford the trip, Finkbine was forced to travel to Sweden for an abortion to avoid caring for a damaged fetus in addition to four children.<ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?"/> The other event that changed public opinion was the outbreak of rubella in the 1950s and 60s.<ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /><ref name="Reproductive Politics"/> Because rubella disrupted the growth of fetuses and caused deformities during pregnancy, the California Therapeutic Abortion Act was signed in 1967.<ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /> This Act allowed doctors to perform abortions when the pregnancy risked the physical or mental health of the pregnant person.<ref name="Safe, Legal, and Unavailable?" /> These two events are commonly used to show how the health and safety of pregnant women are contingent upon abortions as well as the ability to give birth to and adequately take care of a child.

[[File:FGM road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005.jpg|thumb|250 px|left|Anti-FGM road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005]]

Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital circumcision or cutting, is the traditional, non-medical practice of altering or injuring the female reproductive organs, often by removing all or parts of the  external genitalia.<ref name=":1" /> It is mostly practiced in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, and affects over 200 million women and girls worldwide. More severe forms of FGM are highly concentrated in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/|title=WHO &#124; Female genital mutilation (FGM)}}</ref>

The WHO categorizes FGM into four types:

* '''Type I''' ([[Clitoridectomy|Cliteridectomy]]) is the removal of all or part of the [[clitoris]]. This may or may not include removing the prepuce along with the clitoral glans.
* '''Type II''' (Excision) is the removal of the clitoris along with all or part of the [[labia minora]]. This may or may not include removing all or part of the [[labia majora]].
* '''Type III''' (Infibulation) is the act of removing the inner or outer labia and sealing the wound, leaving only a narrow opening.
* '''Type IV''' refers to "all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes (piercing, scraping, cauterizing of the genital area)."<ref name=":1" />

FGM often takes the form of a traditional celebration conducted by an elder or community leader. The age that women undergo the procedure varies depending on the culture, although it is most commonly performed on prepubescent girls. Certain cultures value FGM as coming of age ritual for girls, and use it to preserve a woman's virginity and faithfulness to the husband after marriage. It is also closely connected with some traditional ideals of female beauty and hygiene.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Klein E, Helzner E, Shayowitz M, Kohlhoff S, Smith-Norowitz TA | title = Female Genital Mutilation: Health Consequences and Complications-A Short Literature Review | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology International | volume = 2018 | pages = 7365715 | date = 2018-07-10 | pmid = 30116269 | pmc = 6079349 | doi = 10.1155/2018/7365715 }}</ref> FGM may or may not have religious connotations depending on the circumstances.<ref name=":1" />

There are no health benefits of FGM, as it interferes with the natural functions of a woman's and girls' bodies, such as causing severe pain, shock, hemorrhage, tetanus or sepsis (bacterial infection), urine retention, open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital tissue, recurrent bladder and urinary tract infections, cysts, increased risk of infertility, childbirth complications and newborn deaths. Sexual problems are 1.5 more likely to occur in women who have undergone FGM, they may experience painful intercourse, have less sexual satisfaction, and be two times more likely to report lack of sexual desire. In addition, the maternal and fetal death rate is significantly higher due to childbirth complications.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Caroline | name-list-style = vanc | title = The psychological impact of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) on girls/women's mental health: a narrative literature review | journal = Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology | date = 19 September 2014 | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 469–485 | doi = 10.1080/02646838.2014.949641 |url=http://researchrepository.napier.ac.uk/id/eprint/8928 }}</ref>

FGM can have severe negative psychological effects on women, both during and after the procedure. These can include long-term symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and low self-esteem.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/female-genital-mutilation|title=Female genital mutilation|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref> Some women report that the procedure was carried out without their consent and knowledge, and describe feelings of fear and helplessness while it was taking place. A 2018 study found that larger quantities of the hormone [[cortisol]] were secreted in women who had undergone FGM, especially those who had experienced more severe forms of the procedure and at an early age. This marks the body's chemical response to trauma and stress, and can indicate a greater risk for developing symptoms of PTSD and other trauma disorders, although there are limited studies showing a direct correlation.<ref name=":02">{{cite journal | vauthors = Köbach A, Ruf-Leuschner M, Elbert T | title = Psychopathological sequelae of female genital mutilation and their neuroendocrinological associations | language = En | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 187 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29895282 | pmc = 5998450 | doi = 10.1186/s12888-018-1757-0 }}</ref>

Legislation has been introduced in certain countries to prevent FGM. A 2016 survey of 30 countries showed 24 had policies to manage and prevent FGM, although the process to provide funding, education, and resources were often inconsistent and lacking. Some countries have seen a slight decline in FGM rates, while others show little to no change.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Johansen RE, Ziyada MM, Shell-Duncan B, Kaplan AM, Leye E | title = Health sector involvement in the management of female genital mutilation/cutting in 30 countries | language = En | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 240 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29615033 | pmc = 5883890 | doi = 10.1186/s12913-018-3033-x }}</ref>

==Child and forced marriage==
{{Main|Child marriage|Forced marriage}}
[[File:Girl_Summit_-_22nd_July_in_London_(14498368279).jpg|thumb|250px|Poster against child and forced marriage]]
The practice of forcing young girls into early marriage, common in many parts of the world, is threatening their reproductive health. According to the World Health Organization:<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Life-stages/sexual-and-reproductive-health/news/news/2012/12/child-marriage-a-threat-to-health | title=Child marriage – a threat to health| date=2012-12-20}}</ref>

<blockquote>"The sexual and reproductive health of the female in a child marriage is likely to be jeopardized, as these young girls are often forced into sexual intercourse with an older male spouse with more sexual experience. The female spouse often lacks the status and the knowledge to negotiate for safe sex and contraceptive practices, increasing the risk of acquiring HIV or other sexually transmitted infections, as well as the probability of pregnancy at an early age." </blockquote>

[[Niger]] has the highest prevalence of child marriage under 18 in the world, while [[Bangladesh]]  has the highest rate of marriage of girls under age 15.<ref>https://www.unicef.org/media/files/Child_Marriage_Report_7_17_LR..pdf</ref> Practices such as [[bride price]] and [[dowry]] can contribute to child and forced marriages.

== International Conference on Population and Development, 1994 ==
The [[International Conference on Population and Development]] (ICPD) was held in [[Cairo]], Egypt, from 5 to 13 September 1994. Delegations from 179 States took part in negotiations to finalize a Programme of Action on population and development for the next 20 years. Some 20,000 delegates from various governments, [[UN]] agencies, [[NGOs]], and the [[Mass media|media]] gathered for a discussion of a variety of population issues, including [[immigration]], [[infant mortality]], [[birth control]], [[family planning]], and the education of women.

In the ICPD Program of Action,<ref>[https://www.unfpa.org/publications/international-conference-population-and-development-programme-action ICPD Program of Action]</ref> 'reproductive health' is defined as:

<blockquote>a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and...not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the reproductive system and its functions and processes. Reproductive health therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this last condition are the right of men and women to be informed [about] and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods of birth control which are not against the law, and the right of access to appropriate health-care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant.<ref>ICPD Programme of Action, paragraph 7.2.</ref></blockquote>

This definition of the term is also echoed in the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women,<ref>[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/health.htm United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women]</ref> or the so-called Beijing Declaration of 1995.<ref>The United Nations
Fourth World Conference on Women</ref> However, the ICPD Program of Action, even though it received the support of a large majority of UN Member States, does not enjoy the status of an international legal instrument; it is therefore not legally binding.

The Program of Action endorses a new strategy which emphasizes the numerous linkages between population and development and focuses on meeting the needs of individual women and men rather than on achieving [[demographic targets]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/populatin/icpd.htm#intro |author=ICPD| title=ICPD Program of Action | access-date=2009-02-04| author-link=International Conference on Population and Development}}</ref> The [[International Conference on Population and Development|ICPD]]  achieved consensus on four qualitative and quantitative goals for the international community, the final two of which have particular relevance for reproductive health:

* '''Reduction of maternal mortality''': A reduction of [[maternal mortality]] rates and a narrowing of disparities in maternal mortality within countries and between geographical regions, socio-economic and ethnic groups.
* '''Access to reproductive and sexual health services including family planning''': [[Family planning]] counseling, pre-natal care, safe delivery and post-natal care, prevention and appropriate treatment of [[infertility]], prevention of [[abortion]] and the management of the consequences of abortion, treatment of reproductive tract infections, [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and other reproductive health conditions; and education, counseling, as appropriate, on human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenthood. Services regarding [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], [[breast cancer]], infertility, delivery, [[hormone therapy]], [[sex reassignment therapy]], and abortion should be made available. Active discouragement of [[female genital cutting|female genital mutilation (FGM)]].

The keys to this new approach are empowering women, providing them with more choices through expanded access to education and health services, and promoting skill development and employment. The programme advocates making family planning universally available by 2015 or sooner, as part of a broadened approach to reproductive health and rights, provides estimates of the levels of national resources and international assistance that will be required, and calls on governments to make these resources available.

== Sustainable Development Goals ==
Half of the development goals put on by the United Nations started in 2000 to 2015 with the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). Reproductive health was Goal 5 out of 8. To monitor the progress, the UN agreed to four indicators:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/The%20Millennium%20Development%20Goals%20Report%202008.pdf|title=2008 MDG Progress Report|author=UN|pages=28–29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203222613/http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/The%20Millennium%20Development%20Goals%20Report%202008.pdf|archive-date=2009-02-03|url-status=dead|access-date=2009-02-04}}</ref>

*Contraceptive prevalence rates
*Adolescent birth rate
*Antenatal care coverage
*Unmet need for family planning

Progress was slow, and according to the [[WHO]] in 2005, about 55% of women did not have sufficient antenatal care and 24% had no access to family planning services.<ref name="progressMDG52">{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/making_pregnancy_safer/topics/mdg/en/index.html|title=What progress has been made on MDG 5?|author=WHO|access-date=2009-02-04}}</ref> The MDGs expired in 2015 and were replaced with a more comprehensive set of goals to cover a span of 2016–2030 with a total of 17 goals, called the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. All 17 goals are comprehensive in nature and build off one another, but goal 3 is "To ensure health lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages". Specific goals are to reduce global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births, end preventable deaths of newborns and children, reduce the number by 50% of accidental deaths globally, strengthen the treatment and prevention programs of substance abuse and alcohol.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/topics/sustainable-development-goals/targets/en/|title=Sustainable Development Goal 3: Health|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref> In addition, one of the targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 5]] is to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender equality|url=https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/women-and-the-sdgs/sdg-5-gender-equality|access-date=2020-09-23|website=UN Women|language=en}}</ref>

HIV/AIDS in Africa is a major public health problem. Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected world region for prevalence of HIV, especially among young women. 90% of the children in the world living with HIV are in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>{{cite web | title = HIV/AIDS | url = http://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids | publisher = World Health Organization Africa }}</ref>

In most African countries, the total fertility rate is very high,<ref>{{cite book | chapter-url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html | chapter = Country Comparison: Total Fertility Rate | title = The World Factbook | publisher = United States Central Intelligence Agency | year = 2017 | title-link = The World Factbook }}</ref> often due to lack of access to contraception and family planning, and practices such as forced and child marriage. Niger, Angola, Mali, Burundi, Somalia and Uganda have very high fertility rates. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Africa has the lowest rate of contraceptive use (33%) and highest rate of unmet need for contraceptives (22%).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Family Planning - United Nations Population Division|url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/family-planning/index.asp|access-date=2020-10-05|website=www.un.org|language=EN}}</ref>

The updated contraceptive guidelines in [[South Africa]] attempt to improve access by providing special service delivery and access considerations for sex workers, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals, migrants, men, adolescents, women who are perimenopausal, have a disability, or chronic condition. They also aim to increase access to long acting contraceptive methods, particularly the copper IUD, and the introductions of single rod progestogen implant and combined oestrogen and progestogen injectables. The copper IUD has been provided significantly less frequently than other contraceptive methods but signs of an increase in most provinces were reported. The most frequently provided method was injectable progesterone, which the article acknowledged was not ideal and emphasised condom use with this method because it can increase the risk of HIV: The product made up 49% of South Africa's contraceptive use and up to 90% in some provinces.<ref name="RSA_2014" />

[[Tanzania]]n provider perspectives address the obstacles to consistent contraceptive use in their communities. It was found that the capability of dispensaries to service patients was determined by inconsistent reproductive goals, low educational attainment, misconceptions about the side effects of contraceptives, and social factors such as gender dynamics, spousal dynamics, economic conditions, religious norms, cultural norms, and constraints in supply chains. A provider referenced and example of propaganda spread about the side effects of contraception: "There are influential people, for example elders and religious leaders. They normally convince people that condoms contain some microorganisms and contraceptive pills cause cancer". Another said that women often had pressure from their spouse or family that caused them to use birth control secretly or to discontinue use, and that women frequently preferred undetectable methods for this reason. Access was also hindered as a result of a lack in properly trained medical personnel: "Shortage of the medical attendant...is a challenge, we are not able to attend to a big number of clients, also we do not have enough education which makes us unable to provide women with the methods they want". The majority of medical centers were staffed by people without medical training and few doctors and nurses, despite federal regulations, due to lack of resources. One center had only one person who was able to insert and remove implants, and without her they were unable to service people who wanted an implant inserted or removed. Another dispensary that carried two methods of birth control shared that they sometimes run out of both materials at the same time. Constraints in supply chains sometimes cause dispensaries to run out of contraceptive materials. Providers also claimed that more male involvement and education would be helpful.<ref name="pmid27337850">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baraka J, Rusibamayila A, Kalolella A, Baynes C | title = Challenges Addressing Unmet Need for Contraception: Voices of Family Planning Service Providers in Rural Tanzania | journal = African Journal of Reproductive Health | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 23–30 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 27337850 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7e2f/02d167efbda5c739175dc076ee82d56692a3.pdf | jstor = 24877606 }}</ref> Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to family planning, by tracking specific, standardized family planning and reproductive health indicators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.measureevaluation.org/prh/rh_indicators|title=Family Planning and Reproductive Health Indicators Database — MEASURE Evaluation|website=www.measureevaluation.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-23}}</ref>
