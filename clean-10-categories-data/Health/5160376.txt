The [[death]] of a [[pet]] or an [[animal]] to which one has become emotionally bonded oftentimes results in [[grief]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl_kiyRKYDcC&pg=PR9 Pet loss and human emotion: a guide to recovery by Cheri Barton Ross, p.17]</ref> which can be comparable with the death of a human loved one, or even greater depending on the individual. The death can be felt more intensely when the owner has made a decision to end the pet's life through [[Animal euthanasia|euthanasia]].<ref>[http://petsinpeace.com.au/staff-profiles/martin-hopp#a-pet-owners-anguish "A pet owners anguish"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824084237/http://petsinpeace.com.au/staff-profiles/martin-hopp#a-pet-owners-anguish |date=August 24, 2011 }}, Pets in Peace, accessed April 25, 2011;</ref> While there is strong evidence that animals can [[emotion in animals|feel]] such loss for other animals,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/emotionallivesof0000beko <!-- quote=grief. --> The emotional lives of animals by Marc Bekoff, p. 63]</ref> this article focuses on [[human being|human]] [[emotion|feelings]], when an animal is lost, dies or otherwise is departed.

==Effect of animal loss on humans==
There is no set amount of time for the grieving process to occur. However, mourning is much more intense for a pet upon whom the owner was emotionally dependent. Additionally, some pet owners may feel unable to express their grieving due to social customs and norms surrounding pets. If the pet owner internalizes the grief, the suffering increases.<ref>The Loss of a Pet By Wallace Sife p. 37</ref>

The [[Kübler-Ross model|stages of grief]] proposed by [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross|Elizabeth Kübler-Ross]] were designed in relation to human death, but can be adapted to describe the grief process for the death of a pet.<ref>The Loss of a Pet By Wallace Sife p. 45</ref> Indeed, pet death includes several lessons: 1) the relationship rather than the object (the animal) is central to understand the loss; 2) the manner of death/loss will affect the grieving process; 3) the age and living situation of the bereaved will affect the grieving process.<ref>Death and Dying, Life and Living By Charles A. Corr, Clyde Nabe, Donna M. Corr p. 261</ref>

University of Michigan did a study of grief involving 174 adults who had deceased pets.      Participants were administered a modified CENSHARE Pet Attachment Survey. Results indicate that initially 85.7% of owners experienced at least one symptom of grief, but the occurrence decreased to 35.1% at six months and to 22.4% at one year. Males and females reported different rates on six of 12 symptoms surveyed. The severity and length of symptoms was significantly correlated with the degree of attachment to the deceased pet. These findings indicate that pet loss can be a potential area of clinical concern, especially if the person's attachment to the pet was strong.<ref>Grieving Pet Death: Normative, Gender, and Attachment Issues. Wrobel, T. A., & Dye, A. L. (2015, October 25)</ref>

===Coping with death===
Though well-meaning phrases like "time heals all wounds" can simply upset the grieving pet owner, it is true that the one factor required for all coping strategies is time.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kw6AOmp7pi8C&pg=PA106&dq=animal+loss+coping&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=animal%20loss%20coping&f=false Coping with Sorrow on the Loss of Your Pet By Moira Anderson Allen, p. 32]</ref> Coping also involves understanding the emotions surrounding the loss of a pet, and then accepting the emotions to focus towards positive solutions.

Coping strategies may include:<ref>Coping with Sorrow on the Loss of Your Pet By Moira Anderson Allen</ref>
* Going through the grieving process
* Strengthening positive memories
* Seeking support from resources, organizations and individuals
* Seeking solace from one's own spiritual beliefs
* Preparing for a pet's death in advance

===Types of loss===
[[File:Gabe, missing dog.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Typical posting for a lost pet]]There are several special types of loss:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jjjct0jqpw0C&pg=PA63 Pet Loss and Children: Establishing a Healthy Foundation By Cheri Barton Ross, p. 64]</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjWs4PwnkWwC&pg=PA54 |title=Pet Loss And Human Emotion: Guiding Clients Through Grief - Cheri Ross - Google Books |accessdate=2012-10-13|isbn=9781560326526 |last1=Ross |first1=Cheri Barton |last2=Baron-Sorensen |first2=Jane |year=1998 }}</ref>
* Pet is missing (considered an unresolved loss)
* Pet is lost through divorce/separation
* Pet is accidentally injured or killed
* Pet is willfully injured or killed
* Pet is [[theft|stolen]]
* Pet dies naturally
* Pet is [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]]
* Pet becomes very ill

===Getting a new animal===
Before bringing a new pet into the home following the death of a previous pet, carefully consider the timing.<ref>Coping with Sorrow on the Loss of Your Pet By Moira Anderson Allen, p. 48</ref> Additionally, it is recommended to consider where the bereaved is in the grieving process.<ref>Starting Out Right with Your New Dog: A Complete Guide, by Susan McCullough, p. 16</ref> Choose the new pet for its own unique qualities rather than trying to replace the former pet.<ref>[https://cloud9vets.co.uk/how-to-cope-with-the-loss-of-a-pet/ "How To Cope With The Loss Of A Pet?"], Cloud 9 Vets, accessed April 4, 2011;</ref>

===Workplace issues===
Pet illness and death is gradually becoming recognized as similar to other forms of sickness and death in the family. In the UK, a variety of companies provide paid leave for such eventualities,<ref>"A number of large businesses have begun to allow their employees 'peternity' leave, in order to look after sick pets or take them to the vets. London delivery company [[The Courier Service]] introduced a "peternity" policy last July that lets workers claim two days' paid annual leave. Denise Fresco, human resources manager, said: 'It is awarded in the same way people might need time off for a baby or to look after a child.' Meanwhile, the [[Bank of Scotland]] allow workers to take time off work for sick pets, so long as they organise cover. [[Royal Mail]] has also said that it will consider allowing 'compassionate leave' if a pet dies." [http://www.workplacelaw.net/display.php?resource_id=8203&a_id=1943 workplacelaw.com Jan 2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209004142/http://www.workplacelaw.net/display.php?resource_id=8203&a_id=1943 |date=2007-02-09 }}</ref> with employment tribunals backing this in some instances where employment terms did not specifically mention pet loss.<ref>"In September 2006, Royal Mail had to pay employee David Portman an undisclosed amount for firing him after he took a week off work following the death of his dog. The week's absence, the last in a series of absences, happened in 2004 and Portman was dismissed from his job as a result. Portman’s lawyer argued that many of the previous absences were a result of workplace injuries and that Royal Mail's own procedures say that time off following bereavement is not counted against an employee's sickness record. The [[employment tribunal|tribunal]] ruled Portman had been off for legitimate reasons and that Royal Mail had failed to understand and apply its own policy." [http://www.workplacelaw.net/display.php?resource_id=8203&a_id=1943 workplacelaw.com Jan 2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209004142/http://www.workplacelaw.net/display.php?resource_id=8203&a_id=1943 |date=2007-02-09 }}</ref>

Recent studies by insurers suggest that up to one in four pet owners are sufficiently affected by pet loss or illness to take time off, but that many feel this will be treated lightly and hence simply state they were sick. According to [[Petplan UK|Petplan]], 35% of people admitted to taking time off work to either settle new pets into the home or care for sick pets, and half of those admitted taking a whole week off,<ref name="workpplacelaw">{{Cite web |url=http://www.workplacelaw.net/display.php?resource_id=8203&a_id=1943 |title=workplacelaw.com Jan 2007 |access-date=2007-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209004142/http://www.workplacelaw.net/display.php?resource_id=8203&a_id=1943 |archive-date=2007-02-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and according to [[Direct Line]] one in four pet owners "said they have been too upset to go into the workplace when their four legged friend died" and "many of those who did go into work after the death of their pet said they were unproductive." <ref>The London Paper (''thelondonpaper.com'') and The Scotsman, 9 Feb: survey of 1100 dog owners by Direct Line.</ref> The latter survey also noted that pet owners in the UK take "around 8 days off" due to grief at the death of a pet, and that "seventy-nine percent of people responding to the survey admitted they did not think their boss would be sympathetic, and the only way they could get time off work was by... pretending to be ill." <ref name="workpplacelaw" />

==Beliefs about non-human death==
[[File:Louvre egyptologie 21.jpg|right|thumb|A [[mummy|mummified]] cat]]
Some world religions have held that beloved pets will join their families in an [[afterlife]]. [[Animal worship]] was common in the ancient world, influencing the burial practices of animals. [[Animal mummy|Animal mummification]] was practiced in ancient Egypt, and  gave [[Cats in ancient Egypt|special significance to cats]] in some areas. Egyptians believed that mummification was imperative in order to gain admittance to the afterlife, ensuring the animals’ immortality.<ref name=Dunand>[[Dunand, Francoise]], Roger Lichtenberg, and Jean Yoyotte. Mummies and Death in Egypt. New York: Cornell University Press, 2007.</ref>

Some ancient Egyptian families believed that mummified pets would keep the deceased company in the afterlife.<ref name=Lawrence>Lawrence, Susan V. "Unraveling the Mysteries of the Mummies." Science News, Society for Science and the Public 118 (1980): 362-64.</ref> The most common Egyptian pets included cats, dogs, mongooses, monkeys, gazelles, and birds. Many Egyptians loved their pets, and the customary process of mourning the loss of a loved pet included crying and shaving one's eyebrows. Ancient Egyptian pets were given names like we name our pets today, evidenced by over 70 names deciphered in inscriptions identifying pet dog mummy remains.<ref name=Arnold>Arnold, Dorothea. "An Egyptian Bestiary." The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin new 52 (1995): 1-64.</ref>

Modern [[religion]]s are divided as to whether or not non-human animals are believed to have [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s, the ability to [[reincarnation|reincarnate]], and whether animals will exist in the afterlife.

In the absence of a common religious belief, many pet owners have embraced the concept of the [[Rainbow Bridge (pets)|Rainbow Bridge]].  The concept, the origin of which is not clearly known, speaks of a [[metaphor]]ical or [[mythology|mythical]] place of reunion where pets that die live in a [[paradise|paradisical]] version of [[limbo]], [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenated]] and free of pain and suffering, until their companion humans arrive upon their deaths.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=shAHJQwXslYC&pg=PA389 Planet Cat: A CAT-alog by Sandra Choron, Harry Choron, Arden Moore, p. 389]</ref><ref>[http://www.petsinpeace.com.au/online_memorials "Online Memorials"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407092947/http://www.petsinpeace.com.au/online_memorials |date=April 7, 2011 }}, An analysis of Pets in Peace online memorials reveals 30% express a desire or belief that they will be re-united in an afterlife, this includes 2% that explicitly mention the Rainbow Bridge, breakdown calculated April 9, 2011;</ref> At this point, the pet(s) run to their companion humans, and they enter [[heaven]] together, never to be parted again.

In [[Mormonism]], all [[organism]]s (as well as the entire planet [[Earth]]) are believed to have a [[spirit]], but that beings without the gift of [[free agency (Mormonism)|free agency]] (the ability to know and choose between right and wrong) are innocent and unblemished spirits who go straight to [[Heaven]] when they die.<ref>[[Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith]], p. 291</ref>  Animals will be resurrected.<ref>Sacred Truths of the Doctrine and Covenants Vol. II, p.38</ref>

[[Animal chaplains]] are becoming increasingly popular for helping the bereaved family members deal with the loss of their pet to provide memorial services, spiritual reassurance, and grief counseling.
