== Signs and symptoms ==

=== Skin ===
[[Image:Skin reaction to anthrax.jpg|thumb|Skin lesion from anthrax]]
[[File:Cutaneous anthrax lesion on the neck. PHIL 1934 lores.jpg|thumb|Skin anthrax lesion on the neck]]
Cutaneous anthrax, also known as hide-porter's disease, is when anthrax occurs on the skin. It is the most common form (>90% of anthrax cases). It is also the least dangerous form (low mortality with treatment, 20% mortality without).<ref>{{cite web|title=Cutaneous Anthrax|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/types/cutaneous.html|website=CDC|accessdate=16 February 2018|language=en-us|date=21 July 2014}}</ref> Cutaneous anthrax presents as a [[boil]]-like [[skin lesion]] that eventually forms an [[ulcer]] with a black center ([[eschar]]). The black eschar often shows up as a large, painless, [[necrotic]] ulcer (beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot, somewhat resembling bread mold) at the site of infection. In general, cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure. Unlike [[bruise]]s or most other lesions, cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain. Nearby lymph nodes may become infected, reddened, swollen, and painful. A scab forms over the lesion soon, and falls off in a few weeks. Complete recovery may take longer.<ref name="CDC-Anthrax">{{cite web|title=Anthrax Q & A: Signs and Symptoms |work=Emergency Preparedness and Response |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |year=2003 |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/signs.asp |accessdate=19 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405150014/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/signs.asp |archivedate=5 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when ''B. anthracis'' spores enter through cuts on the skin. This form is found most commonly when humans handle infected animals and/or animal products.

=== Injection ===
In December 2009, an outbreak of anthrax occurred among injecting heroin users in the [[Glasgow]] and [[Stirling]] areas of Scotland, resulting in 14&nbsp;deaths.<ref name=":2" /> The source of the anthrax is believed to be dilution of the heroin with [[bone meal]] in Afghanistan.<ref name=":3" /> It may have symptoms similar to cutaneous anthrax, but it may also have infection deep into the muscle and spread faster.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-01-28|title=Injection Anthrax {{!}} Anthrax {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/types/injection.html|access-date=2020-09-16|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}}</ref>

=== Lungs ===
Inhalation anthrax usually develops within a week after exposure, but may take up to 2 months.<!-- <ref name=Yellow2020/> --> During the first few days of illness, most people have fever, chills, and fatigue.<!-- <ref name=Yellow2020/> --> These symptoms may be accompanied by cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea or vomiting, making inhalation anthrax difficult to distinguish from [[influenza]] and [[community-acquired pneumonia]].<!-- <ref name=Yellow2020/> --> This is often described as the prodromal period.<ref name="Yellow2020">{{cite book|url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/anthrax|title=Anthrax - Chapter 4 - 2020 Yellow Book {{!}} Travelers' Health {{!}} CDC|publisher=CDC|accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>

Over the next day or so, shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain become more common, and complaints not involving the chest such as nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, sweats, and headache develop in one-third or more of people.<!-- <ref name=Yellow2020/> --> Upper respiratory tract symptoms occur in only a quarter of people, and muscle pains are rare.<!-- <ref name=Yellow2020/> --> Altered mental status or shortness of breath generally brings people to healthcare and marks the fulminant phase of illness.<!-- <ref name=Yellow2020/> -->

It infects the lymph nodes in the chest first, rather than the lungs themselves, a condition called hemorrhagic [[mediastinitis]], causing bloody fluid to accumulate in the chest cavity, therefore causing shortness of breath. The second (pneumonia) stage occurs when the infection spreads from the lymph nodes to the lungs. Symptoms of the second stage develop suddenly after hours or days after the first stage. Symptoms include high fever, extreme shortness of breath, shock, and rapid death within 48 hours in fatal cases.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url = http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%207th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202011.pdf|title = USAMRIID's Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook|last = [[USAMRIID]]|date = 2011|isbn = 9780160900150|edition = 7th|publisher = [[US Government Printing Office]]|quote = For the attacks of 2001, CFR was only 45%, while before this time CFRs for IA were >85% (Page 37)|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209044622/http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%207th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202011.pdf|archivedate = 9 February 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Gastrointestinal ===
[[Human gastrointestinal tract|Gastrointestinal]] (GI) infection is most often caused by consuming anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by diarrhea, potentially with blood, abdominal pains, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/types/gastrointestinal.html | title=Gastrointestinal Anthrax | work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date=23 August 2013 | accessdate=10 February 2015 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211034003/http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/types/gastrointestinal.html | archivedate=11 February 2015 }}</ref> Occasional [[hematemesis|vomiting of blood]] can occur.  Lesions have been found in the intestines and in the mouth and throat. After the bacterium invades the gastrointestinal system, it spreads to the bloodstream and throughout the body, while continuing to make toxins.

=== Bacteria ===
[[Image:Bacillus anthracis Gram.jpg|thumb|[[Photomicrograph]] of a [[Gram stain]] of the bacterium ''Bacillus anthracis'', the cause of the anthrax disease]]
{{Main|Bacillus anthracis}}
''Bacillus anthracis'' is a rod-shaped, [[Gram-positive]], facultative anaerobic bacterium about 1 by 9&nbsp;μm in size.<ref name=CDC2015Bas /> It was shown to cause disease by [[Robert Koch]] in 1876 when he took a blood sample from an infected cow, isolated the bacteria, and put them into a mouse.<ref name="pages 277-310">{{cite journal |last=Koch |first=R |title=Untersuchungen über Bakterien: V.

The etiology of anthrax, based on the ontogenesis of ''Bacillus anthracis''], Cohns</ref> The bacterium normally rests in spore form in the soil, and can survive for decades in this state. Herbivores are often infected while grazing, especially when eating rough, irritant, or spiky vegetation; the vegetation has been hypothesized to cause wounds within the GI tract, permitting entry of the bacterial spores into the tissues, though this has not been proven. Once ingested or placed in an open wound, the bacteria begin multiplying inside the animal or human and typically kill the host within a few days or weeks. The spores germinate at the site of entry into the tissues and then spread by the circulation to the lymphatics, where the bacteria multiply.

The production of two powerful exotoxins and lethal toxin by the bacteria causes death. Veterinarians can often tell a possible anthrax-induced death by its sudden occurrence, and by the dark, nonclotting blood that oozes from the body orifices. Most anthrax bacteria inside the body after death are outcompeted and destroyed by anaerobic bacteria within minutes to hours ''post mortem''. However, anthrax vegetative bacteria that escape the body via oozing blood or through the opening of the carcass may form hardy spores. These vegetative bacteria are not contagious.<ref name=Liu>{{cite journal |title=Formation and Composition of the ''Bacillus anthracis'' Endospore |author1=Hongbin Liu |author2=Nicholas H.

The triggers for spore formation are not yet known, though oxygen tension and lack of nutrients may play roles. Once formed, these spores are very hard to eradicate.

The infection of herbivores (and occasionally humans) by the inhalational route normally begins with inhaled spores being transported through the air passages into the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The spores are then picked up by scavenger cells ([[macrophage]]s) in the lungs and are transported through small vessels ([[lymphatic system|lymphatics]]) to the [[lymph nodes]] in the central chest cavity ([[mediastinum]]). Damage caused by the anthrax spores and bacilli to the central chest cavity can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing. Once in the lymph nodes, the spores germinate into active bacilli that multiply and eventually burst the macrophages, releasing many more bacilli into the bloodstream to be transferred to the entire body. Once in the blood stream, these bacilli release three proteins named [[Anthrax lethal factor endopeptidase|lethal factor]], edema factor, and protective antigen. The three are not toxic by themselves, but their combination is incredibly lethal to humans.<ref name=Pimental04>{{cite journal |last1=Pimental |first1=RA |last2=Christensen |first2=KA |last3=Krantz |first3=BA |last4=Collier |first4=RJ |title=Anthrax toxin complexes: heptameric protective antigen can bind lethal factor and edema factor simultaneously |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=322 |issue=1 |pages=258–62 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15313199 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.105}}</ref> Protective antigen combines with these other two factors to form lethal toxin and edema toxin, respectively. These toxins are the primary agents of tissue destruction, bleeding, and death of the host. If antibiotics are administered too late, even if the antibiotics eradicate the bacteria, some hosts still die of toxemia because the toxins produced by the bacilli remain in their systems at lethal dose levels.

Historically, inhalational anthrax was called woolsorters' disease because it was an occupational hazard for [[wool classing|people who sorted wool]]. Today, this form of infection is extremely rare in advanced nations, as almost no infected animals remain.

Occupational exposure to infected animals or their products (such as skin, wool, and meat) is the usual pathway of exposure for humans. Workers who are exposed to dead animals and animal products are at the highest risk, especially in countries where anthrax is more common. Anthrax in [[livestock]] grazing on open range where they mix with wild animals still occasionally occurs in the United States and elsewhere.

Many workers who deal with wool and animal hides are routinely exposed to low levels of anthrax spores, but most exposure levels are not sufficient to develop anthrax infections. A lethal infection is reported to result from inhalation of about 10,000–20,000 spores, though this dose varies among host species.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18812&page=2 |title=Anthrax, Then and Now |publisher=MedicineNet.com |accessdate=13 August 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520040609/http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18812&page=2 |archivedate=20 May 2008 }}</ref> Little documented evidence is available to verify the exact or average number of spores needed for infection.

=== Mode of infection ===
[[File:Anthrax - inhalational.jpg|thumb|Inhalational anthrax, [[mediastinum|mediastinal]] widening]]
Anthrax can enter the human body through the intestines (ingestion), lungs (inhalation), or skin (cutaneous) and causes distinct clinical symptoms based on its site of entry. In general, an infected human is quarantined.

== Mechanism ==
The lethality of the anthrax disease is due to the bacterium's two principal virulence factors: the [[polyglutamic acid|poly-D-glutamic acid capsule]], which protects the bacterium from phagocytosis by host neutrophils, and the tripartite protein toxin, called [[anthrax toxin]]. Anthrax toxin is a mixture of three [[proteins|protein]] components: protective [[antigen]] (PA), [[edema]] factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF).<ref name=toxin>{{cite web |url=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/anthrax/ |title=Molecular Basis for Anthrax Intoxication |author=Mu Gao |date=27 April 2006 |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226202812/http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/anthrax/ |archivedate=26 December 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> PA plus LF produces lethal toxin, and PA plus EF produces edema toxin. These toxins cause death and tissue swelling ([[edema]]), respectively.

To enter the cells, the edema and lethal factors use another protein produced by ''B. anthracis'' called protective antigen, which binds to two surface receptors on the host cell. A cell [[protease]] then cleaves PA into two fragments: PA<sub>20</sub> and PA<sub>63</sub>. PA<sub>20</sub> dissociates into the extracellular medium, playing no further role in the toxic cycle. PA<sub>63</sub> then oligomerizes with six other PA<sub>63</sub> fragments forming a heptameric ring-shaped structure named a prepore. Once in this shape, the complex can competitively bind up to three EFs or LFs, forming a resistant complex.<ref name="Pimental04"/> Receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs next, providing the newly formed toxic complex access to the interior of the host cell. The acidified environment within the endosome triggers the heptamer to release the LF and/or EF into the cytosol.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chvyrkova |first1=I |last2=Zhang |first2=XC |last3=Terzyan |first3=S |title=Lethal Factor of Anthrax Toxin Binds Monomeric Form of Protective Antigen |journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications |volume=360 |issue=3 |pages=690–5 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17617379 |pmc=1986636 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.06.124}}</ref> It is unknown how exactly the complex results in the death of the cell.

Edema factor is a [[calmodulin]]-dependent [[adenylate cyclase]]. Adenylate cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP into [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) and [[pyrophosphate]]. The complexation of adenylate cyclase with [[calmodulin]] removes calmodulin from stimulating calcium-triggered signaling, thus inhibiting the immune response.<ref name="Pimental04"/> To be specific, LF inactivates [[neutrophil]]s (a type of phagocytic cell) by the process just described so they cannot phagocytose bacteria. Throughout history, lethal factor was presumed to cause macrophages to make [[TNF-alpha]] and [[IL1B|interleukin 1, beta]] (IL1B). TNF-alpha is a [[cytokine]] whose primary role is to regulate immune cells, as well as to induce inflammation and [[apoptosis]] or programmed cell death. Interleukin 1, beta is another cytokine that also regulates inflammation and apoptosis. The overproduction of TNF-alpha and IL1B ultimately leads to [[septic shock]] and death. However, recent evidence indicates anthrax also targets endothelial cells that line serous cavities such as the [[pericardial cavity]], [[pleural cavity]], and [[peritoneal cavity]], lymph vessels, and blood vessels, causing vascular leakage of fluid and cells, and ultimately [[hypovolemic shock]] and septic shock.

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Septicaemic anthrax in a drug user.png|left|thumb|218x218px|Possible edema and necrosis in a case of injection anthrax.]]
Various techniques may be used for the direct identification of ''B. anthracis'' in clinical material. Firstly, specimens may be [[Gram stain]]ed. ''Bacillus'' spp. are quite large in size (3 to 4&nbsp;μm long), they may grow in long chains, and they stain Gram-positive. To confirm the organism is ''B. anthracis'', rapid diagnostic techniques such as [[polymerase chain reaction]]-based assays and [[Immunofluorescence|immunofluorescence microscopy]] may be used.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levinson |first=W. |title=Review of Medical Microbiology and Immunology |year=2010 |edition=11th}}</ref>

All ''Bacillus'' species grow well on 5% sheep blood agar and other routine culture media. Polymyxin-lysozyme-EDTA-thallous acetate can be used to isolate ''B. anthracis'' from contaminated specimens, and bicarbonate agar is used as an identification method to induce capsule formation. ''Bacillus'' spp. usually grow within 24 hours of incubation at 35&nbsp;°C, in ambient air (room temperature) or in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. If bicarbonate agar is used for identification, then the medium must be incubated in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. ''B. anthracis'' colonies are medium-large, gray, flat, and irregular with swirling projections, often referred to as having a "[[Medusa|medusa head]]" appearance, and are not hemolytic on 5% sheep blood agar. The bacteria are not motile, susceptible to penicillin, and produce a wide zone of lecithinase on egg yolk agar. Confirmatory testing to identify ''B. anthracis'' includes gamma bacteriophage testing, indirect hemagglutination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Forbes |first=B. A. |title=Bailey & Scott's Diagnostic Microbiology |year=2002 |edition=11th}}</ref> The best confirmatory precipitation test for anthrax is the [[Alberto Ascoli|Ascoli]] test.

== Prevention ==
Precautions are taken to avoid contact with the skin and any fluids exuded through natural body openings of a deceased body that is suspected of harboring anthrax.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/emergencypreparedness/anthrax/controlandprevention.html|title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Anthrax – Control and Prevention {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=22 December 2019}}</ref> The body should be put in strict quarantine. A blood sample is collected and sealed in a container and analyzed in an approved laboratory to ascertain if anthrax is the cause of death. The body should be sealed in an airtight body bag and incinerated to prevent transmission of anthrax spores. Microscopic visualization of the encapsulated bacilli, usually in very large numbers, in a blood smear stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFadyean stain) is fully diagnostic, though culture of the organism is still the gold standard for diagnosis. Full isolation of the body is important to prevent possible contamination of others.<ref name=":1" />

Protective, impermeable clothing and equipment such as [[rubber glove]]s, rubber apron, and rubber boots with no perforations are used when handling the body. No skin, especially if it has any wounds or scratches, should be exposed. Disposable personal protective equipment is preferable, but if not available, decontamination can be achieved by autoclaving. Used disposable equipment is burned and/or buried after use. All contaminated bedding or clothing is isolated in double plastic bags and treated as biohazard waste.<ref name=":1" /> Respiratory equipment capable of filtering small particles, such the US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]- and [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]]-approved high-efficiency respirator, is worn.<ref>National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/default.html Respirators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731101026/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/default.html |date=31 July 2017 }}.

=== Antibiotics ===
Preventive antibiotics are recommended in those who have been exposed.<ref name=Hend2014/> Early detection of sources of anthrax infection can allow preventive measures to be taken. In response to the anthrax attacks of October 2001, the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) installed biodetection systems (BDSs) in their large-scale mail processing facilities. BDS response plans were formulated by the USPS in conjunction with local responders including fire, police, hospitals, and public health. Employees of these facilities have been educated about anthrax, response actions, and [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] medication. Because of the time delay inherent in getting final verification that anthrax has been used, prophylactic antibiotic treatment of possibly exposed personnel must be started as soon as possible.

== Treatment ==
[[File:Anthrax and Antibiotics - Anthrax is Deadly, Antibiotics Could Save Your Life.webm|thumb|Anthrax and antibiotics]]
Anthrax cannot be spread from person to person, except in the rare case of skin exudates from cutaneous anthrax.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-01-09|title=How People Are Infected {{!}} Anthrax {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/how-people-are-infected.html|access-date=2020-09-16|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}}</ref> However, a person's clothing and body may be contaminated with anthrax spores. Effective decontamination of people can be accomplished by a thorough wash-down with [[antimicrobial]] soap and water. Waste water is treated with bleach or another antimicrobial agent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/anthrax/decon.html |title=How should I decontaminate during response actions? |publisher=Occupational Safety & Health Administration |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226204204/https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/anthrax/decon.html |archivedate=26 December 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Effective decontamination of articles can be accomplished by boiling them in water for 30 minutes or longer. Chlorine bleach is ineffective in destroying spores and vegetative cells on surfaces, though [[formaldehyde]] is effective. Burning clothing is very effective in destroying spores. After decontamination, there is no need to immunize, treat, or isolate contacts of persons ill with anthrax unless they were also exposed to the same source of infection.

=== Antibiotics ===
Early antibiotic treatment of anthrax is essential; delay significantly lessens chances for survival. Treatment for anthrax infection and other bacterial infections includes large doses of intravenous and oral antibiotics, such as [[fluoroquinolone]]s ([[ciprofloxacin]]), [[doxycycline]], [[erythromycin]], [[vancomycin]], or [[penicillin]]. FDA-approved agents include ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and penicillin.<ref name="urlCDC Anthrax Q & A: Treatment">{{cite web|url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/treatment.asp|title=CDC Anthrax Q & A: Treatment|accessdate=4 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505191339/http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/treatment.asp|archivedate=5 May 2011}}</ref> In possible cases of pulmonary anthrax, early [[prophylaxis|antibiotic prophylaxis]] treatment is crucial to prevent possible death. Many attempts have been made to develop new drugs against anthrax, but existing drugs are effective if treatment is started soon enough.

== History ==
{{See also|List of anthrax outbreaks}}

=== Etymology ===
The English name comes from ''anthrax'' ({{lang|grc|ἄνθραξ}}), the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for coal,<ref>{{LSJ|a)/nqrac|ἄνθραξ|ref}}.</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|anthrax}}</ref> possibly having [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] etymology,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV3dCQAAQBAJ|title=Wool Economy in the Ancient Near East|first1=Catherine|last1=Breniquet|first2=Cécile|last2=Michel|date=31 July 2014|publisher=Oxbow Books|via=Google Books|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827170707/https://books.google.com/books?id=fV3dCQAAQBAJ|archivedate=27 August 2016|isbn=9781782976349}}</ref> because of the characteristic black skin [[lesion]]s developed by victims with a cutaneous anthrax infection. The central, black [[eschar]], surrounded by vivid red skin has long been recognised as typical of the disease. The first recorded use of the word "anthrax" in English is in a 1398 translation of [[Bartholomaeus Anglicus]]' work ''{{lang|la|De proprietatibus rerum}}'' (''On the Properties of Things'', 1240).<ref name="de Trevisa 1398">{{cite book|last1=de Trevisa|first1=John|title=Bartholomaeus Anglicus' De Proprietatibus Rerum|date=1398}}</ref>

Anthrax has been known by a wide variety of names, indicating its symptoms, location and groups considered most vulnerable to infection. These include Siberian plague, [[Cumberland County, New South Wales|Cumberland disease]], charbon, splenic fever, malignant edema, woolsorter's disease, and even ''{{lang|fr|[[Bradford|la maladie de Bradford]]}}''.<ref name="Stark 2013">{{cite book|last1=Stark|first1=James|title=The Making of Modern Anthrax, 1875–1920: Uniting Local, National and Global Histories of Disease|date=2013|publisher=Pickering & Chatto|location=London}}</ref>

=== Discovery ===
[[Robert Koch]], a German physician and scientist, first identified the bacterium that caused the anthrax disease in 1875 in [[Wolsztyn|Wollstein]] (now part of Poland).<ref name="pages 277-310"/><ref name="Brock">{{Cite book |editor-last=Madigan |editor-first=M. |editor-last2=Martinko |editor-first2=J. |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms |edition=11th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-13-144329-7}}</ref> His pioneering work in the late 19th century was one of the first demonstrations that [[Germ theory of disease|diseases could be caused by microbes]]. In a groundbreaking series of experiments, he uncovered the lifecycle and means of transmission of anthrax. His experiments not only helped create an understanding of anthrax, but also helped elucidate the role of microbes in causing illness at a time when debates still took place over [[spontaneous generation#Spontaneous generation|spontaneous generation]] versus [[cell theory]]. Koch went on to study the mechanisms of other diseases and won the 1905 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his discovery of the bacterium causing tuberculosis.

Although Koch arguably made the greatest theoretical contribution to understanding anthrax, other researchers were more concerned with the practical questions of how to prevent the disease. In Britain, where anthrax affected workers in the wool, [[worsted]], [[hide (skin)|hide]]s, and [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] industries, it was viewed with fear. [[John Henry Bell]], a doctor born & based in [[Bradford]], first made the link between the mysterious and deadly "woolsorter's disease" and anthrax, showing in 1878 that they were one and the same.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=M|first1=J|title=John Henry Bell, M.D., M.R.C.S|journal=British Medical Journal|date=22 September 1906|pages=735–6|pmc=2382239|volume=2|issue=2386|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.2386.735}}</ref> In the early 20th century, [[Friederich Wilhelm Eurich]], the [[Germans|German]] [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]] who settled in Bradford with his family as a child, carried out important research for the local Anthrax Investigation Board. Eurich also made valuable contributions to a [[Home Office]] Departmental Committee of Inquiry, established in 1913 to address the continuing problem of industrial anthrax.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Industrial Infection by Anthrax|journal=British Medical Journal|date=15 November 1913|page=1338|pmc=2346352|volume=2|issue=2759}}</ref> His work in this capacity, much of it collaboration with the factory inspector [[G. Elmhirst Duckering]], led directly to the [[Anthrax Prevention Act]] (1919).

=== First vaccination ===
{{Further|Anthrax vaccines}}
[[File:Pasteur inoculating sheep against anthrax. Wellcome L0003758.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis Pasteur inoculating sheep against anthrax]]

Anthrax posed a major economic challenge in [[France]] and elsewhere during the 19th century. Horses, cattle, and sheep were particularly vulnerable, and national funds were set aside to investigate the production of a [[vaccine]]. Noted French scientist [[Louis Pasteur]] was charged with the production of a vaccine, following his successful work in developing methods which helped to protect the important wine and silk industries.<ref name="Jones 2010">{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Susan|title=Death in a Small Package: A Short History of Anthrax|date=2010|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore}}</ref>

In May 1881, Pasteur – in collaboration with his assistants [[Jean Joseph Henri Toussaint|Jean-Joseph Henri Toussaint]], [[Pierre Paul Émile Roux|Émile Roux]] and others – performed a public experiment at [[Pouilly-le-Fort]] to demonstrate his concept of vaccination. He prepared two groups of 25 [[sheep]], one [[goat]], and several [[cow|cattle]]. The animals of one group were injected with an anthrax vaccine prepared by Pasteur twice, at an interval of 15 days; the control group was left unvaccinated. Thirty days after the first injection, both groups were injected with a culture of live anthrax bacteria. All the animals in the unvaccinated group died, while all of the animals in the vaccinated group survived.<ref>{{cite book |last=Decker |first=Janet |title=Deadly Diseases and Epidemics, Anthrax |publisher=Chelesa House Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7910-7302-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/anthraxdeadlydis00jane/page/27 27–28] |url=https://archive.org/details/anthraxdeadlydis00jane/page/27 }}</ref>

After this apparent triumph, which was widely reported in the local, national, and international press, Pasteur made strenuous efforts to export the vaccine beyond France. He used his celebrity status to establish Pasteur Institutes across Europe and Asia, and his nephew, [[Adrien Loir]], travelled to [[Australia]] in 1888 to try to introduce the vaccine to combat anthrax in [[New South Wales]].<ref name="Geison 2014">{{cite book |last1=Geison|first1=Gerald|title=The Private Science of Louis Pasteur|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref> Ultimately, the vaccine was unsuccessful in the challenging climate of rural Australia, and it was soon superseded by a more robust version developed by local researchers [[John Gunn (researcher)|John Gunn]] and [[John McGarvie Smith]].<ref name="Stark 2012">{{cite journal|last1=Stark|first1=James|title=Anthrax and Australia in a Global Context: The International Exchange of Theories and Practices with Britain and France, c.1850–1920|journal=Health and History|date=2012|volume=14|issue=2|pages=1–25 |doi=10.5401/healthhist.14.2.0001}}</ref>

The [[Anthrax vaccine adsorbed|human vaccine for anthrax]] became available in 1954. This was a cell-free vaccine instead of the live-cell Pasteur-style vaccine used for veterinary purposes.

*[[Strain 836]], created by the Soviet bio-weapons program in the 1980s, was later called by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' "the most virulent and vicious strain of anthrax known to man".<ref>[[David Willman|Willman, David]] (2007), [https://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/01/nation/na-alibek1 "Selling the Threat of Bioterrorism"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 1 July 2007.</ref><ref>[[Annie Jacobsen|Jacobsen, Annie]] (2015), ''The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top Secret Military Research Agency''; New York: [[Little, Brown and Company]], pg 293.</ref>
*The virulent [[Ames strain]], which was used in the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the United States, has received the most news coverage of any anthrax outbreak. The Ames strain contains two virulence [[plasmids]], which separately encode for a three-protein toxin, called [[anthrax toxin]], and a polyglutamic acid [[bacterial capsule|capsule]].
*Nonetheless, the [[Vollum strain]], developed but never used as a [[biological weapon]] during the [[Second World War]], is much more dangerous. The Vollum (also incorrectly referred to as Vellum) strain was isolated in 1935 from a cow in [[Oxfordshire]]. This same strain was used during the [[Gruinard Island|Gruinard]] bioweapons trials.

Carcasses may also be buried, though the burying of large animals deeply enough to prevent resurfacing of spores requires much manpower and expensive tools. Carcasses have been soaked in formaldehyde to kill spores, though this has environmental contamination issues. Block burning of vegetation in large areas enclosing an anthrax outbreak has been tried; this, while environmentally destructive, causes healthy animals to move away from an area with carcasses in search of fresh grass. Some wildlife workers have experimented with covering fresh anthrax carcasses with shadecloth and heavy objects. This prevents some scavengers from opening the carcasses, thus allowing the putrefactive bacteria within the carcass to kill the vegetative ''B. anthracis'' cells and preventing sporulation. This method also has drawbacks, as scavengers such as hyenas are capable of infiltrating almost any exclosure.

[[File:Powell-anthrax-vial.jpg|thumb|[[Colin Powell]] giving a presentation to the [[United Nations Security Council]], holding a model vial of anthrax]]
Anthrax spores have been used as a [[biological warfare]] weapon. Its first modern incidence occurred when Nordic rebels, supplied by the [[German General Staff]], used anthrax with unknown results against the [[Imperial Russian Army]] in Finland in 1916.<ref>Bisher, Jamie, "During World War I, Terrorists Schemed to Use Anthrax in the Cause of Finnish Independence", ''Military History'', August 2003, pp. 17–22.

Anthrax, designated at the time as Agent N, was also investigated by the Allies in the 1940s.

A long history of practical [[bioweapons]] research exists in this area. For example, in 1942, British bioweapons trials severely contaminated [[Gruinard Island]] in Scotland with anthrax spores of the [[vollum strain|Vollum-14578 strain]], making it a no-go area until it was decontaminated in 1990.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cole|first=Leonard A.|title=Clouds of Secrecy: The Army's Germ Warfare Tests Over Populated Areas|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=1990|isbn=978-0-8226-3001-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780822630012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Saddam's germ war plot is traced back to one Oxford cow |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1726745,00.html |first=David |last=Robertson |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225102048/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1726745,00.html |archivedate=25 December 2005 }}</ref> The Gruinard trials involved testing the effectiveness of a [[submunition]] of an "N-bomb"{{snd}} a biological weapon containing dried anthrax spores.

{{Main|Sverdlovsk anthrax leak}}
Despite signing the 1972 agreement to end bioweapon production, the government of the Soviet Union had an active bioweapons program that included the production of hundreds of tons of anthrax after this period. On 2 April 1979, some of the over one million people living in Sverdlovsk (now called [[Ekaterinburg, Russia]]), about {{convert|850|mi|km|order=flip}} east of Moscow, were exposed to an [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak|accidental release of anthrax]] from a biological weapons complex located near there. At least 94 people were infected, of whom at least 68 died. One victim died four days after the release, 10 over an eight-day period at the peak of the deaths, and the last six weeks later. Extensive cleanup, vaccinations, and medical interventions managed to save about 30 of the victims.<ref name=Guillemin_1999_275>{{cite book |last=Guillemin |first=Jeanne |title=ANTHRAX, the investigation of a Deadly Outbreak |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=343 |issue=16 |url=https://archive.org/details/anthraxinvestiga0000guil/page/275 |url-access=registration |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-520-22917-4 |pp=[https://archive.org/details/anthraxinvestiga0000guil/page/275 275–7] |pmid=11041763 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200010193431615 }}</ref> Extensive cover-ups and destruction of records by the [[KGB]] continued from 1979 until Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] admitted this anthrax accident in 1992.

Nearly all of the night-shift workers of a ceramics plant directly across the street from the biological facility (compound 19) became infected, and most died. Since most were men, some [[NATO]] governments suspected the Soviet Union had developed a sex-specific weapon.<ref name="Alibek">{{Cite book |last=Alibek |first=K. |title=Biohazard |location=New York |publisher=Delta Publishing |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-385-33496-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/biohazardchillin00alib_0 }}</ref> The government blamed the outbreak on the consumption of anthrax-tainted meat, and ordered the confiscation of all uninspected meat that entered the city.

To support the [[cover-up]] story, Soviet medical and legal journals published articles about an outbreak in livestock that caused GI anthrax in people having consumed infected meat, and cutaneous anthrax in people having come into contact with the animals. All medical and public health records were confiscated by the KGB.<ref name="Meselson" /> In addition to the medical problems the outbreak caused, it also prompted Western countries to be more suspicious of a covert Soviet bioweapons program and to increase their surveillance of suspected sites. In 1986, the US government was allowed to investigate the incident, and concluded the exposure was from aerosol anthrax from a military weapons facility.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sternbach |first=G. |year=2002 |title=The History of Anthrax |journal=Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=463–467 |doi=10.1016/S0736-4679(03)00079-9 |pmid=12745053}}</ref> In 1992, President Yeltsin admitted he was "absolutely certain" that "rumors" about the Soviet Union violating the 1972 Bioweapons Treaty were true. The Soviet Union, like the US and UK, had agreed to submit information to the UN about their bioweapons programs, but omitted known facilities and never acknowledged their weapons program.<ref name="Alibek" />

Concentrated anthrax spores were used for bioterrorism in the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] in the United States, delivered by mailing postal letters containing the spores.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cole|first=Leonard A.|title=The Anthrax Letters: A Bioterrorism Expert Investigates the Attacks That Shocked America—Case Closed?|publisher=SkyhorsePublishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60239-715-6|url=https://archive.org/details/anthraxlettersbi0000cole|url-status=live|url-access=registration}}</ref> The letters were sent to several news media offices and two Democratic senators: [[Tom Daschle]] of South Dakota and [[Patrick Leahy]] of Vermont. As a result, 22 were infected and five died.<ref name="Pimental04"/> Only a few grams of material were used in these attacks and in August 2008, the US Department of Justice announced they believed that [[Bruce Edwards Ivins|Bruce Ivins]], a senior biodefense researcher employed by the United States government, was responsible.<ref>{{cite news | last = Bohn | first = Kevin | title = U.S. officials declare researcher is anthrax killer | publisher=CNN | date = 6 August 2008 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/08/06/anthrax.case/index.html | accessdate =7 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080808213014/http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/08/06/anthrax.case/index.html| archivedate= 8 August 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> These events also spawned many [[anthrax hoaxes]].

Due to these events, the US Postal Service installed [[Autonomous Detection System|biohazard detection systems]] at its major distribution centers to actively scan for anthrax being transported through the mail.<ref>{{cite web |title       = Cepheid, Northrop Grumman Enter into Agreement for the Purchase of Anthrax Test Cartridges |publisher   = Security Products |date        = 16 August 2007 |url         = http://secprodonline.com/articles/2007/08/16/cepheid-northrop-grumman.aspx |accessdate  = 26 March 2009 |url-status     = live |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716031354/http://secprodonline.com/articles/2007/08/16/cepheid-northrop-grumman.aspx |archivedate = 16 July 2011 |df          = dmy-all}}</ref> As of 2020, no positive alerts by these systems have occurred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/news/state-releases/sc/2013/FAQ-BDS.pdf|title=USPS BDS FAQ}}</ref>

A scientific experiment performed by a high school student, later published in the ''Journal of Medical Toxicology'', suggested a domestic [[ironing|electric iron]] at its hottest setting (at least {{convert|400|°F|°C}}) used for at least 5 minutes should destroy all anthrax spores in a common postal envelope.<ref>{{cite news |title=Seventeen-year-old devises anthrax deactivator |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11522143/ns/msnbc-the_ed_show/t/seventeen-year-old-devises-anthrax-deactivator |publisher=[[NBC News]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007082027/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11522143/ns/msnbc-the_ed_show/t/seventeen-year-old-devises-anthrax-deactivator/ |archivedate=7 October 2014 }}</ref>

=== Popular culture ===
In [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1932 dystopian novel ''[[Brave New World]]'', anthrax bombs are mentioned as the primary weapon by means of which original modern society is terrorised and in large part eradicated, to be replaced by a dystopian society.

The episode "Diagnosis: Danger" from the series [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]] concerns Health Department officials working to contain an anthrax outbreak.

Anthrax attacks have featured in the storylines of various television episodes and films. A ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' episode follows the attempt to identify an attacker who released anthrax spores in a public park.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Amplification |series=[[Criminal Minds]] |date=13 May 2009 |url=https://www.cbs.com/shows/criminal_minds/episodes/25226/ |network=[[CBS]] |season=4 |number=24 }}</ref>

In the American 2001 [[Live-action animated film|live-action/animated]] action comedy film ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'', anthrax (referred to as 'Thrax') serves as the main [[antagonist]]; he is voiced by [[Laurence Fishburne]].

The American thrash metal band ''[[Anthrax]]'' gets its name from the disease.
