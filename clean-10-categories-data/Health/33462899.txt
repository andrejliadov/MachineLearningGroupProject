== Theoretical development ==
=== Emergence ===
Over the past three decades, social scientists have found that minority individuals suffer from mental and physical [[health disparities]] compared to their peers in majority groups.  This research has focused primarily on racial and sexual minorities.  For example, African Americans have been found to suffer elevated rates of [[hypertension]] compared to Whites.<ref name="McNeilly">McNeilly, M., Anderson, N. B., Robinson, E. F., McManus, C.

Washington, DC: APA.</ref> These health disparities impact day-to-day well-being as well as overall life expectancy, leading social scientists to ask: How can we reduce minority health disparities?  In order to answer this question, it was first important to explore the underlying causes of the disparities.

==== Social selection hypothesis ====
One causal explanation for minority health disparities is the social selection hypothesis, which holds that there is something inherent to being in a minority group (e.g., [[genetics]]) that makes individuals susceptible to health problems.<ref name="Bailey">Bailey, J. M.  (1999).  [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/205342 Homosexuality and mental illness].

''American Sociological Review, 31,'' 14-34.</ref> In general, this view has not been supported by [[empirical]] research.  If minority individuals were genetically predisposed to poor health outcomes, the vast majority of them should face health disparities.  However, large-scale empirical studies have shown that most of LGB individuals do not suffer [[psychopathology]] and that many African Americans do not have heart disease.<ref name="McNeilly"/><ref name="Cochran & Mays, 2009">Cochran, S. D., & Mays, V. M. (2009).

''American Journal of Public Health, 90,'' 1699–702.</ref> While the social selection hypothesis is still debated, it is clear that genetic and dispositional factors do not fully explain the health disparities observed in minority groups.

==== Social causation hypothesis ====
A second hypothesis regarding the causes of minority health disparities suggests that minority group members face difficult social situations that lead to poor health.<ref name="Dohrenwend, 1966"/>  This hypothesis has received broad empirical support.<ref name="Dohrenwend, 2000"/>  Indeed, social psychologists have long  recognized that minority individuals have different social experiences compared to majority individuals, including prejudice and discrimination, unequal socioeconomic status, and limited access to health care.<ref name="Allport">Allport, G. W.  (1954).  ''The nature of prejudice.''  New York: Anchor.</ref><ref name="Garnets">Garnets, L. D., Herek, G. M., & Levy. B.  (1990).

== Overview of minority stress theory ==
Minority stress theory extends the social causation hypothesis by suggesting that social situations do not lead directly to poor health for minority individuals, but that difficult social situations cause stress for minority individuals, which accrues over time, resulting in long-term health deficits.<ref>{{Citation

Meyer and [[Mary Northridge|M. E. Northridge]] (Eds.), ''The Health of Sexual Minorities.'' Washington, DC: APA.</ref>  Furthermore, minority stress theory distinguishes between distal and proximal stress processes.<ref name="Dohrenwend, 2000"/>  Distal stress processes are external to the minority individual, including experiences with rejection, prejudice, and discrimination.  Proximal stress processes are internal, and are often the byproduct of distal stressors; they include concealment of one's minority identity, vigilance and anxiety about prejudice, and negative feelings about one's own minority group.  Together, distal and proximal stressors accrue over time, leading to chronically high levels of stress that cause poor health outcomes. Thus, minority stress theory has three primary tenets: 

# Minority status leads to increased exposure to distal stressors.
# Minority status leads to increased exposure to proximal stressors, due to distal stressors.
# Minority individuals suffer adverse health outcomes, which are caused by exposure to proximal and distal stressors.

These three tenets of the minority stress theory have been tested in over 134 empirical studies, most of which examined racial and sexual minority populations.<ref name="Pascoe, 2009"/> Generally, the studies have confirmed that difficult social situations are associated with stress among minority individuals, and that minority stress helps to explain health disparities.

== Evidence of key concepts ==
=== Minority status and distal stressors ===

The first tenet of minority stress theory holds that being in a minority group is associated with increased exposure to distal stressors, such as prejudice and discrimination.  Indeed, despite significant improvement over the past several decades, numerous studies have confirmed that minority individuals continue to face high rates of distal stressors.<ref name="Williams">Williams, D.

Rates of exposure to distal stressors are much higher among racial and sexual minorities than among majority individuals.  For example, LGB adults are twice as likely to recall experiencing prejudice throughout their lives compared to heterosexuals, and LGBT youth report significantly higher rates of prejudice and discrimination compared to their heterosexual and cisgender peers.<ref name="GLSEN"/><ref name="Mays & Cochran 2001">Mays, V.M., & Cochran, S.D.

=== Minority status and proximal stressors ===
Proximal stressors are internal processes that are presumed to occur following exposure to distal stressors.<ref name="Dohrenwend, 2000"/>  Examples of proximal stressors include fear of rejection, [[rumination (psychology)]] on previous experiences with prejudice, and distaste for one's own minority group following a prejudice event.<ref name="Meyer, 2003"/><ref name="Meyer, 2007"/> Most research on this topic focuses on either sexual minorities or African Americans, and it is unclear whether the proximal stress processes are conceptually similar between these two groups.  Thus, it is necessary to review proximal stress processes separately for sexual minority and African American populations.

==== Proximal stressors among sexual minorities ====
A growing body of research indicates that exposure to distal stressors leads to proximal stressors in sexual minority populations. While sexual minority stress and gender minority stress both use Meyer's Minority Stress Model as a framework, and share some characteristics with gender minority stress, some researchers have suggested that sexual minority stress is distinct from the minority stress experienced by transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary-gender individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hendricks|first=Michael|date=2012|title=A conceptual framework for clinical work with transgender and gender nonconforming clients|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|volume=43|issue=5|pages=460–467|doi=10.1037/a0029597}}</ref>  For example, LGB youth and adults who have experienced prejudice about their sexual orientation sometimes choose to conceal their sexual identity from others.<ref name="Croteau">Croteau, J.

==== Proximal stressors among Gender Minorities ====
In comparison to cis (non-transgender) individuals, [[Gender variance|gender variant]] minorities face a higher rate of distal stressors, including exclusion, verbal [[trans bashing]], as well as physical and sexual violence.<ref name="Stotzer 2009 170–179">{{Cite journal|last=Stotzer|first=Rebecca L.|date=2009|title=Violence against transgender people: A review of United States data|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume=14|issue=3|pages=170–179|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2009.01.006|issn=1359-1789}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Weir|first1=Cassandra|last2=Piquette|first2=Noëlla|date=2018|title=Counselling transgender individuals: Issues and considerations.|journal=Canadian Psychology|volume=59|issue=3|pages=252–261|doi=10.1037/cap0000129|issn=1878-7304}}</ref><ref name="McKay 2017 665–678">{{Cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=Tasseli|last2=Lindquist|first2=Christine H.|last3=Misra|first3=Shilpi|date=2017|title=Understanding (and Acting On) 20 Years of Research on Violence and LGBTQ + Communities|journal=Trauma, Violence, & Abuse|volume=20|issue=5|pages=665–678|doi=10.1177/1524838017728708|pmid=29334007|issn=1524-8380}}</ref> The more distal stressors are sourced in family, friends, partners, neighbors, co-workers, acquaintances, strangers, and even the police, the more likely it is for gender variant people to experience proximal stress, including [[internalized transphobia]].<ref name="Stotzer 2009 170–179"/><ref name="McKay 2017 665–678"/><ref name="Stitt">{{Cite book|title=ACT For Gender Identity: The Comprehensive Guide |last=Stitt|first=Alex|date=2020|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1785927997|location=London|oclc=1089850112}}</ref> Internalized transphobia may initially appear as anxiety and depression, marked by a severe decrease in self-tolerance or self-empathy, yet needs to be understood diagnostically within the context of minority stress.<ref name="Stitt"/>

==== Proximal stressors among African Americans ====
Among African Americans, proximal stressors were described by early social psychological theorists. For example, [[Erving Goffman]] observed that racial minorities approach social interactions with a high degree of anxiety, because they have been discriminated against in the past.<ref name="Goffman">Goffman E. (1963). ''Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity.'' Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.</ref> Similarly, [[Gordon Allport]] asserted that African American individuals display vigilance after exposure to prejudice, actively scanning the social environment for potential threats.<ref name="Allport"/>  Such vigilance is presumed to be taxing, sapping emotional and cognitive energy from minority individuals and thus becoming stressful.  Proximal stressors also have been demonstrated among African Americans in terms of [[stereotype threat]].<ref name="Steele">Steele, C. M.  (1997).  [http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/1997-04591-001.html A threat in the air: how stereotypes shape intellectual identity and performance].

==== General proximal stressors among minority individuals ====
The proximal stress processes reviewed above are unique to specific minority groups; for example, internalized homophobia is a proximal stressor unique to LGBT individuals who experience prejudice about their sexual and or/gender orientation/expression, and vigilance against racism is unique to racial minorities who fear future experiences with race-based discrimination.  It is also possible that more general psychological processes act as proximal stressors for minority individuals.<ref name="Hatz">Hatzenbuehler, M. L.  (2009).  How does sexual minority stigma "get under the skin"? A psychological mediation framework.

=== Health outcomes ===

The bulk of minority stress research has examined the third tenet of the theory – namely, that distal and proximal stressors are associated with adverse health outcomes for minority individuals.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Paz GM, Ramirez JL | title = Multiple minority stress: The role of proximal and distal stress on mental health outcomes among lesbian, gay, and bisexual people of color | publisher = Journal of Gay & Lesbian Mental Health | date=March 2019 | url = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19359705.2019.1568946?journalCode=wglm20 | doi=10.1080/19359705.2019.1568946 | access-date = 10 May 2020 | hdl = 11603/11195 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> These outcomes include both mental and physical health disparities, which differ across minority groups.  Again, studies have yet to systematically determine whether minority stress is associated with different health outcomes among different minority groups.  Thus, it is necessary to review associations between minority stress and health separately for LGBT, African Americans, and immigrant groups, as social scientists do not know whether stress causes similar outcomes across groups. The [[immigrant paradox]] outlines health outcomes among immigrant populations.

==== Health outcomes among sexual minorities ====
LGBT individuals face higher rates of psychopathology compared to their non-LGBT peers.  For example, population-based studies have shown that LGBT people are at risk for increased rates of substance abuse, suicide attempts, depression, and anxiety across the lifespan.<ref name="Cochran & Mays, 2000"/><ref name="Burgard"/><ref name="Cochran et al">Cochran, S.

Several studies have linked these negative health outcomes to distal stressors.  For example, in a national survey, LGBT adults displayed higher rates of psychiatric morbidity and also reported significantly higher rates of prejudice and discrimination compared to their heterosexual peers; prejudice and discrimination fully explained the link between sexual orientation and psychiatric symptoms for LGBT respondents.<ref name="Mays & Cochran 2001"/> In another study, level of peer victimization partially explained associations between sexual orientation and suicide risk.<ref name="Russell">Russell, S.

Proximal stressors have also been linked to negative health outcomes for sexual minorities.

==== Health outcomes among African Americans ====
[[Race and health in the United States#African-Americans|African Americans have been shown to suffer notable health disparities]] compared to their White peers.  For example, they suffer higher rates of morbidity due to [[stroke]], perinatal disease, and [[diabetes mellitus]] compared to Whites.<ref name="CDC-1">U.S. Center for Disease Control.  (2004).

Distal stressors have been linked to these health disparities among African Americans.  For example, one study showed that perceived prejudice was associated with irregular [[blood pressure]] throughout the day, which has been linked to long-term [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref name="Brondolo">Brondolo, E., Libby, D.

Other studies have linked proximal stressors and health outcomes for African Americans.  For example, researchers have found that African Americans have a sense of inferiority and low self-worth due to experiences with prejudice, which are associated with emotional distress.<ref name="McCarthy">McCarthy, J.

Non-Hispanic Whites are more than twice as likely to receive antidepressant prescription treatments as are Non-Hispanic Blacks. The death rate from suicide for African American men was almost four times that for African American women, in 2009. However, the suicide rate for African Americans is 60% lower than that of the Non-Hispanic White population. A report from the U.S. Surgeon General found that from 1980 - 1995, the suicide rate among African Americans ages 10 to 14 increased 233%, as compared to 120% of Non-Hispanic Whites.

== Criticism and limitations ==

Despite multiple studies indicating that minority individuals face a high degree of stress related to their minority identity, and that minority stress is associated with poor health outcomes, there are several methodological limitations and ongoing debates on this topic.

First, the minority stress concept has been criticized as focusing too narrowly on the negative experiences of minority individuals and ignoring the unique [[coping (psychology)|coping]] strategies and [[social support]] structures available to them.<ref name="Diamond">Diamond, L. M.  (2003).  Integrating research on sexual-minority and heterosexual development: Theoretical and clinical implications. ''Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 32,'' 490-498.</ref><ref name="Savin-Williams">Savin-Williams, R. C.  (2008).  Then and now: recruitment, definition, diversity, and positive attributes of same-sex populations.  ''Developmental Psychology, 44,'' 135-138.</ref> While theoretical writings about minority stress do note the importance of coping mechanisms for minority individuals,<ref name="Meyer, 2003"/> individual studies that use minority stress theory tend to focus on negative health outcomes rather than on coping mechanisms.  In the future, it will be important for researchers to consider both positive and negative aspects of minority group membership, examining whether and why one of those aspects outweighs the other in determining minority health outcomes.

Also, few studies have been able to test minority stress theory in full.  Most studies have examined one of the three links described above, demonstrating that minority individuals face heightened rates of prejudice, that minority individuals face health disparities, or that prejudice is related to health disparities.  Together, findings from these three areas corroborate minority stress theory, but a stronger test would examine all three parts in the same study.  While there have been a few such studies,<ref name="Mays & Cochran 2001"/> further replication is necessary to support the presumed pathways underlying minority stress.

Most studies of minority stress are correlational.<ref name="Pascoe, 2009"/> While these studies have the advantage of using large, national datasets to establish links between minority status, stressors, and health, they cannot demonstrate [[causality]].  That is, most of the existing research cannot prove that prejudice ''causes'' stress, which ''causes'' poor health outcomes among minority individuals, because [[correlation does not imply causation]]. One way to remedy this limitation is to employ experimental and longitudinal research designs to test the impact of social stressors on health. Indeed, several recent studies have begun to use these more stringent tests of minority stress.<ref name="Merritt">Merritt, M. M., Bennett, G. G., Jr., Williams, R. B., Edwards, C. L., & Sollers, J. J., 3rd. (2006).  Perceived racism and cardiovascular reactivity and recovery to personally relevant stress. ''Health Psychology, 25,'' 364-369.</ref><ref name="Pavalko">Pavalko, E. K., Mossakowski, K. N., & Hamilton, V. J.  (2003).  [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Krysia_Mossakowski/publication/10756618_Does_Perceived_Discrimination_Affect_Health_Longitudinal_Relationships_between_Work_Discrimination_and_Women%27s_Physical_and_Emotional_Health/links/5446d5380cf2f14fb811cbd7/Does-Perceived-Discrimination-Affect-Health-Longitudinal-Relationships-between-Work-Discrimination-and-Womens-Physical-and-Emotional-Health.pdf Does perceived discrimination affect health? Longitudinal relationships between work discrimination and women’s physical and emotional health]. ''Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 44,'' 18-33.</ref> Additional studies are needed to confidently state that prejudice causes poor health for minority individuals.

It is unclear whether different minority groups face different types of minority stress and different health outcomes following prejudice.  Minority stress theory was originally developed to explain associations between social situations, stress, and health for LGB individuals.<ref name="Meyer, 2003"/> Still, researchers have used the same general theory to examine stress processes among African Americans, and findings have generally converged with those from LGB populations. Thus, it is possible that minority stress applies broadly to members of diverse minority groups. However, studies have yet to directly compare experiences, stress responses, and health outcomes among individuals from diverse minority groups.<ref name="Pascoe, 2009"/> Systematic comparisons are necessary to clarify whether minority stress applies to all minority individuals broadly, or whether different models are required for different groups.

[[J. Michael Bailey]], best known for his research on sexual orientation, argues that the minority stress model deserves reconsideration since it fails to take temperament and genetics into account. Bailey argues that there is a biological component to increased stress among non-heterosexual populations, and says that "it would be a shame—most of all for gay men and lesbians whose mental health is at stake—if sociopolitical concerns prevented researchers from conscientious consideration of any reasonable hypothesis".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Michael Bailey|first=J.|date=2020-10-01|title=The Minority Stress Model Deserves Reconsideration, Not Just Extension|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338032279_The_Minority_Stress_Model_Deserves_Reconsideration_Not_Just_Extension|format=PDF|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=49|issue=7|pages=2265–2268|doi=10.1007/s10508-019-01606-9|issn=1573-2800|via=ResearchGate}}</ref>

== Practical applications ==

Minority stress research has demonstrated that several specific processes are associated with minority health disparities.  For example, existing studies highlight the differences between distal and proximal stressors, drawing attention both to socio-cultural factors (e.g., high rates of prejudice against minority individuals) and internal processes (e.g., rumination) that affect minority well-being.  By separating the socio-cultural and individual aspects of minority stress, the theory suggests that practical interventions must occur at both the individual and social levels.<ref name="Meyer, 2007"/>

=== Social applications ===
On the societal level, minority stress research shows that prejudice and discrimination are common occurrences for minority individuals, and that they have damaging effects for individual well-being.  This information has been used by law enforcement, policymakers, and social organizations to target and minimize the occurrence of distal stressors and, thus, to improve minority health on a large scale.<ref name="Meyer, 2007"/> For example, evidence that prejudice is associated with minority stress has been used in several [[amicus curiae]] briefs to settle important court cases regarding prejudice and discrimination against minority groups.<ref name="AC 1">Brief for the NLF as Amicus Curiae, Perry v. Schwarzenegger and Hollingsworth, No. 10-16696 (2010).</ref><ref name="AC 2">Brief for the USCA as Amicus Curiae, Log Cabin Republicans v. United States and Gates, No. 10-56634 (2010).</ref> Evidence that prejudice and discrimination are associated with minority stress that harms well-being for LGB individuals has also been invoked in the congressional debate about anti-harassment protection for LGB youth at the federal level.<ref name="Meyer, 2007"/> In the future, the minority stress concept can be used to advocate for federal funding for nationwide campaigns and interventions that aim to reduce intergroup prejudice.  If successful, these programs may reduce the rate of distal stressors, significantly improving the mental and physical health of minority individuals.

=== Individual applications ===
On the individual level, minority stress research has uncovered differences in how minorities react to prejudice.  For example, studies have shown that some individuals ruminate on experiences with prejudice, which is associated with anxiety and depression.<ref name="Hatz et al"/> Similarly, minority stress research has revealed that internalized stigma (i.e., distaste for one's own minority group) is associated with negative psychological outcomes.  From these findings, clinicians have developed some interventions to decrease internalized stigma and improve well-being for minority individuals.<ref name="Meyer, 2007"/><ref name="Crocker">Crocker, J., & Major, B.  (1989).  [https://wesfiles.wesleyan.edu/courses/PSYC-309-clwilkins/week6/Crocker.Major1989.pdf Social stigma and self-esteem: The self-protective properties of stigma].  ''Psychological Review, 96,'' 608-630.</ref>  When paired with structural interventions, these clinical applications for reducing minority stress may help to improve the pervasive health disparities observed in minority communities.<ref name="Meyer, 2007"/>
