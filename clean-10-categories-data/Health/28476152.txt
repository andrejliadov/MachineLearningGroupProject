'''Coital incontinence''' ('''CI''') is [[urinary leakage]] that occurs during either [[coitus|penetration]] or [[orgasm]] and can occur with a sexual partner or with [[masturbation]]. It has been reported to occur in 10% to 27% of sexually active women with urinary continence problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Serati|first=Maurizio|last2=Salvatore|first2=Stefano|last3=Uccella|first3=Stefano|last4=Nappi|first4=Rossella E.|last5=Bolis|first5=Pierfrancesco|date=January 2009|title=Female Urinary Incontinence During Intercourse: A Review on an Understudied Problem for Women's Sexuality|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=6|issue=1|pages=40–48|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.01055.x|pmid=19170835}}</ref> There is evidence to suggest links between urinary leakage at penetration and [[urodynamic stress incontinence]], and between urinary leakage at orgasm and [[detrusor overactivity]].<ref name=Pastor2013/>

Coital incontinence is physiologically distinct from [[female ejaculation]], with which it is sometimes confused.<ref name=Pastor2013>{{Cite journal|last=Pastor|first=Zlatko|date=July 2013|title=Female ejaculation orgasm vs. coital incontinence: a systematic review|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=10|issue=7|pages=1682–1691|doi=10.1111/jsm.12166|issn=1743-6109|pmid=23634659}}</ref><ref name=Constantini2018>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ics.org/committees/standardisation/terminologydiscussions/coitalurinaryincontinence|title=Coital Urinary Incontinence|website= International Continence Society|access-date=2019-06-06|date=April 2018| first=Elisabetta| last= Constantini}}</ref>
