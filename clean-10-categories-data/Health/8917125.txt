The relationship between '''religion and divorce''' is complicated and varied. Different religions have different perceptions of divorce. Some religions accept divorce as a fact of life, while others only believe it is right under certain circumstances like adultery. Also, some religions allow remarriage after divorce, and others believe it is inherently wrong. This article attempts to summarize these viewpoints of major world religions and some important traditions regarding divorce in each faith.

|Description   = Cartoon parodying the 1906 divorce proceedings of [[Anna Gould]] (an American [[Inheritance|heiress]] and [[socialite]]) and [[Boni de Castellane]] (a French [[nobleman]]) in [[Paris]], France. Boni de Castellane then sought an annulment from the [[Holy See|Vatican]] so that he could be free to remarry in the Church. The annulment case was not finally settled until 1924, when the highest Vatican tribunal upheld the validity of the marriage and denied the annulment.

The great majority of [[Christian denominations]] affirm that marriage is intended as a lifelong covenant, but vary in their response to its dissolubility through divorce. The [[Catholic Church]] treats all [[consummate]]d [[Sacraments|sacramental]] marriages as permanent during the life of the spouses, and therefore does not allow remarriage after a divorce if the other spouse still lives and the marriage has not been [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulled]]. However, divorced Catholics are still welcome to participate fully in the life of the church so long as they have not remarried against church law, and the Catholic Church generally requires civil divorce or annulment procedures to have been completed before it will consider annulment cases. Annulment is not the same as divorce - it is a declaration that the marriage was never valid to begin with.<ref name=BBC>''Divorce in Christianity'' at [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ritesrituals/divorce_1.shtml www.bbc.co.uk] retrieved 17 Aug 2015.</ref> Other Christian denominations, including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and many [[Protestant]] churches, will allow both divorce and remarriage even with a surviving former spouse, at least under certain conditions. For example, the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]], in its 2014 Discipline, teaches:<ref name="AWMC2014"/>
{{quotation|We believe that the only legitimate marriage is the joining of one man and one woman (Gen. 2:24; Rom. 7:2; 1 Cor. 7:10; Eph. 5:22, 23). We deplore the evils of divorce and remarriage. We regard adultery as the only scripturally justifiable grounds for divorce; and the party guilty of adultery has by his or her act forfeited membership in the church. In the case of divorce for other cause, neither party shall be permitted to marry again during the lifetime of the other; and violation of this law shall be punished by expulsion from the church (Matt. 5:32; Mark 10:11, 12). In the carrying out of these principles, guilt shall be established in accordance with judicial procedures set forth in ''The Discipline''.<ref name="AWMC2014">{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=English|page=21}}</ref>}}
In societies that practised [[Puritan]]ism, divorce was allowed if one partner in the marriage was not completely satisfied with the other, and remarriage was also allowed. The [[Church of England]] also took an indissolublist line until 2002, when it agreed to allow a divorced person to remarry in church under exceptional circumstances.<ref name=BBC/> 

Bible commentary on divorce comes primarily from the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and the epistles of Paul. [[Expounding of the Law#Divorce|Jesus taught on the subject of divorce]] in three of the [[Gospels]], and Paul gives a rather extensive treatment of the subject in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] chapter 7: "Let not the wife depart from her husband...let not the husband put away his wife" (1 Corinthians 7:10-11), but he also includes the [[Pauline privilege]]. He again alludes to his position on divorce in his [[Epistle to the Romans]], albeit an allegory, when he states "For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth. . . . So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress" (Romans 7:2-3).

In {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:31-32|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1-10|KJV}} and {{bibleverse||Mark|10:1-5|KJV}}, Jesus came into conflict with the [[Pharisees]] over divorce concerning their well-known controversy between [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and [[Shammai]] about {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|24:1-4|KJV}}—as evidenced in [[Nashim]] Gittin 9:10 of the [[Mishnah]]. Do Jesus’ answers to the Pharisees also pertain to Christians? Are Christians who adopt these teachings [[Judaizers]]? The differences in opinions about these questions usually arise over whether Jesus [[Antinomianism|opposed the Law of Moses]] or just some of the viewpoints of the Pharisees, and whether Jesus just addressed a [[Jewish Christians|Jewish audience]] or expanded his audience to include Christians, for example "all nations" as in the [[Great Commission]].

Since Deuteronomy 24:1-4 did not give Jewish women the right to directly initiate a divorce (See ''[[Agunah]]''), did Jesus' answers "in the house" to his disciples expand the rights of women or did they merely acknowledge that some Jewish women, such as [[Herodias]] who divorced Herod Boethus, were wrongfully taking rights because Jewish women were being assimilated by other cultures? (See {{bibleverse||Matthew|14:3-4|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|10:10-12|KJV}}.) In other words, did Jesus confine his remarks to the Pharisaical questions, and did he appeal to his own authority by refuting the oral authority of the Pharisees with the formula [[Expounding of the Law|"You have heard...But I say to you"]] in {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:20-48|KJV}}? Expressions used by Jesus such as "you have heard", "it hath been said", "it is written", "have you never read", "keep the commandments", "why do you break the commandments with your traditions?" and "what did Moses Command you?" seem to indicate that Jesus generally respected the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and sometimes opposed [[Oral law|Pharisaical Opinions]]. He was [[Woes of the Pharisees|critical of the Pharisees]].

==Buddhism==
Buddhism has no religious concept of marriage (see [[Buddhist view of marriage]]). In Buddhism, marriage is a secular affair, subject to local customs.

==Islam==
{{main|Divorce in Islam}}
{{See also|Sharia}}

According to the Quran, marriage is intended to be unbounded in time, but when marital harmony cannot be attained, the Quran allows the spouses to bring the marriage to an end (2:231).<ref name=EoQ-279>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Harald Motzki | year= 2006 | title=Marriage and divorce|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|editor=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|volume=3|page=279|publisher=Brill}}</ref> Divorce in Islam can take a variety of forms, some initiated by the husband and some initiated by the wife. The main traditional legal categories are ''talaq'' (repudiation), ''khulʿ'' (mutual divorce), judicial divorce and oaths. The theory and practice of divorce in the Islamic world have varied according to time and place.<ref name=OEIW-modern>{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Modern Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Historically, the rules of divorce were governed by [[sharia]], as interpreted by [[Fiqh|traditional Islamic jurisprudence]], and they differed depending on the [[Madhhab|legal school]].<ref name=OEIW-hist>{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce.

==Judaism==
[[Judaism]] has always accepted divorce as a fact of life, though an unfortunate one.<ref>[[Deuteronomy]] chapters 22 and 24.</ref> Judaism generally maintains that it is better for a couple to divorce than to remain together in a state of bitterness and strife. It is said that ''[[shalom bayit]]'' (domestic harmony) is a desirable state.<ref>[http://www.jewfaq.org/divorce.htm Judaism 101/divorce]</ref>

===Legal procedures===
In general, it is accepted that for a Jewish divorce to be effective the husband must hand to the wife, and not vice versa, a bill of divorce called a ''[[get (divorce document)|get]]'', while witnesses observe. Although the ''get'' is mainly used as proof of the divorce, sometimes the wife will tear the ''get'' to signal the end of the marriage and to ensure it is not reused.<ref name=":0" /> However, from ancient times, the ''get'' was considered to be very important to show all those who needed to have proof that the woman was in fact free from the previous marriage and free to remarry. In Jewish law, besides other things, the consequences of a woman remarrying and having a child while still legally married to another is profound: the child would be a ''[[mamzer]]'', an "estranged person" to be avoided. Also, the woman would be committing [[adultery]] should she remarry while still legally married to another. An enactment called ''[[Gershom ben Judah#Synod and bans|Herem de-Rabbenu Gershom]]'' (the proscription of [[Gershom ben Judah]], accepted universally throughout European Jewish communities), prohibited a husband from divorcing his wife against her will.<ref>Malinowitz, Chaim; [http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html "The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications"], ''Jewish Law Articles''</ref>

In ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law), divorce is an act of the parties to the marriage, which is different from the approach adopted by many other legal systems. That is, a Jewish divorce does not require a decree from a court. The function of the court, in the absence of agreement between the parties, is to decide whether the husband should be compelled to give the ''get'' or for the wife to accept the ''get''. But, notwithstanding any such ruling, the parties remain married until such time as the husband actually delivers the ''get''.

Jewish law, in effect, does not require proof or even an allegation of moral or other fault by either party. If both parties agree to a divorce and follow the prescribed procedure, then the court would not need to establish responsibility for the marriage break-down. In this sense it is a "no-fault" approach to divorce.

A woman who has been refused a ''get'' is typically referred to as an "[[agunah]]". Where pre-nuptial agreements are enforceable in civil courts, [[Legal responses to agunah|appropriate provisions]] may be made to compel the giving of the ''get'' by the husband in the event of a civil divorce being obtained. However, this approach has not been accepted universally, particularly by the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].<ref>Lavin, Talia (November 27, 2013) [https://www.jta.org/2013/11/27/united-states/for-man-agunot-halachic-prenup-wnt-break-their-chains "For Many Agunot, Halachic Prenups Won’t Break Their Chains], ''Jewish Telegraphic Agency''. Retrieved December 26, 2019.</ref>

A wife can initiate a divorce process on several grounds (including lack of satisfaction in her sexual life). However, this right extends only so far as petitioning a court to force her husband to divorce her.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.jewfaq.org/divorce.htm| title = Jewish Attitude Toward Divorce| accessdate = 2006-09-10| last = Rich| first = Tracey R.| authorlink =|date= | year = | publisher = JewFAQ.Org| pages = | language = }}</ref>

One part of the complex process of divorce in Judaism, is the creation of the ''get'' itself. The ''get'' is crafted with great care and responsibility in order to ensure that no mistakes create consequences in the future. For example, exactly twelve lines are written in permanent ink telling the names of both parties, place, and time of the divorce.<ref name=":0">Hoffman, Lawrence A. “The Jewish Wedding Ceremony.” Life Cycles in Jewish and Christian Worship, University of Notre Dame Press, 1996, pp. 129–153.</ref> Because of the danger of the birth of ''mamzerim'' if the process is not performed properly, and because divorce law is extraordinarily complex, the process is generally supervised by experts.

===Philosophical approaches===

From the philosophical and mystical point of view, divorce is a unique procedure of tremendous importance and complexity, because it nullifies the holiest of connections that can exist in the Universe (similar to a connection between a person and God). 

In some Jewish mythologies, Adam had a wife before Eve named [[Lilith]] who left him. The earliest historically documentation of this legend appears in the 8th-10th centuries ''[[Alphabet of Ben Sira]]''. Whether this particular tradition is older is not known.

==Others==
===Wicca===
The [[Wicca]]n equivalent of a divorce is described as a ''handparting''. Wiccans traditionally see either a high priest or high priestess to discuss things out before a divorce.<ref>A Handbook for Wiccan Clergy - Page 60, Kevin M. Gardner - 2007</ref> However a handfasting (marriage) that falls apart peacefully does not necessarily need a handparting.<ref>All One Wicca: A Study in the Universal Eclectic Tradition of Wicca - Page 110, Kaatryn MacMorgan - 2001</ref>

===Unitarian Universalism===
In [[Unitarian Universalism]], because they affirm the "right of conscience", divorce is allowed and should be a decision by the individual person and is seen as ending a rite of passage. Such divorces have sometimes taken the form of divorce rituals as far back as the 1960s. Divorces are largely seen as a life choice.<ref>Searching for Spiritual Unity...Can There Be Common Ground? Robyn E Lebron - 2012 Page 571</ref><ref>https://www.uua.org/sites/live-new.uua.org/files/documents/mcdonaldcolleen/divorce.pdf</ref>

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism Divorce and Remarriage is allowed. [[Arthashastra]] which is one of the sastras in Hinduism says:

A woman, hating
her husband, can not dissolve her marriage with him against his
will. Nor can a man dissolve his marriage with his wife against her
will. But from mutual enmity, divorce may be obtained
(parasparam dveshánmokshah). If a man, apprehending danger
from his wife desires divorce (mokshamichhet), he shall return to
her whatever she was given (on the occasion of her marriage). If a
woman, under the apprehension of danger from her husband,
desires divorce, she shall forfeit her claim to her property<ref>Page 224 https://csboa.com/eBooks/Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_-_English.pdf</ref>
