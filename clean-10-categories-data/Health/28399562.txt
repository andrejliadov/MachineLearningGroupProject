Between 2010 and 2013, Diabetes Hands Foundation partnered with [[Children's Hospital Boston]] to develop TuAnalyze (in English) and EsTuAnalisis (in Spanish), two diabetes data collection, mapping, and surveying applications.<ref name="boston1">{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2010/05/_children_hospi.html|title=Children's project uses social network to map diabetes|publisher=}}</ref> Members of the online communities could submit their [[hemoglobin A1C]] data to be aggregated and displayed on maps.<ref>[http://www.diabetesmine.com/2010/05/introducing-“tuanalyze”-why-mapping-diabetes-data-matters.html Introducing “TuAnalyze”: Why Mapping Diabetes Data Matters]</ref>  The project's goal was to rapidly survey and better understand populations of people with diabetes through data donations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iftf.org/node/3598|title=What if Self-Tracking Goes Mainstream?|access-date=2010-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005012103/http://www.iftf.org/node/3598#|archive-date=2010-10-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> A research paper detailing the first lessons learned in connection with TuAnalyze<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sharing Data for Public Health Research by Members of an International Online Diabetes Social Network|first1=Elissa R.|last1=Weitzman|first2=Ben|last2=Adida|first3=Skyler|last3=Kelemen|first4=Kenneth D.|last4=Mandl|date=27 April 2011|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=6|issue=4|pages=e19256|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0019256|pmid=21556358|pmc=3083415}}</ref> was published in the [[Public Library of Science]] in 2011, and many other survey results have been published by the Boston research team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tudiabetes.org/profiles/blog/list?q=tuanalyze|title=TuAnalyze blog entries on TuDiabetes|access-date=2012-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111031056/http://www.tudiabetes.org/profiles/blog/list?q=tuanalyze#|archive-date=2013-11-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Big Blue Test ===
[[File:The Big Blue Test Logo.jpg|frameless|right]]
The Big Blue Test was a program started by Diabetes Hands Foundation to raise awareness of the importance of exercise for people with diabetes. The program took place leading up to [[World Diabetes Day]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forecast.diabetes.org/magazine/only-online/big-blue-test-worldwide-diabetes-test|title=The Big Blue Test: Worldwide Diabetes Test-In|access-date=2010-08-17|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713193154/http://forecast.diabetes.org/magazine/only-online/big-blue-test-worldwide-diabetes-test#|archive-date=2012-07-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> (November 14). It reinforced the importance of exercise in managing diabetes by having participants test their blood sugar, get active, test again, and share the results online.  The results typically showed how exercise reduces blood sugar levels for both people with diabetes and people without diabetes. For each Big Blue Test submitted, a donation to a diabetes charity was made to help people with diabetes in need of supplies and/or education. 


In 2012, [[American Idol|''American Idol'']]'s [[Elliott Yamin]] and [[The Amazing Race 17|''The Amazing Race'']]'s Nat Strand were integral to the Big Blue Test campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/riva-greenberg/diabetes-big-blue-test_b_2000499.html|title=Elliott Yamin Is Jammin' for Diabetes and the Big Blue Test|first=Riva|last=Greenberg|date=23 October 2012|publisher=}}</ref> 
=== Diabetes Advocates ===
Diabetes Advocates is a program that serves as a platform for connecting individuals and organizations that have taken a leadership role in assisting people with diabetes and offered assistance in accurate reporting about diabetes in the media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reportingonhealth.org/blogs/2012/03/27/diabetes-advocates-offer-assistance-accurate-reporting-media|title=Diabetes Advocates Offer Assistance in Accurate Reporting in the Media|publisher=}}</ref> Many of the program's members have been featured on Health.com<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.com/health/gallery/thumbnails/0,,20404524,00.html|title=11 Great Blogs and Websites for Insulin Users|publisher=}}</ref> and other publications.
