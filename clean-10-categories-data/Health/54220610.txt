The '''immigrant paradox''' is that recent [[Immigrant generations|immigrants]] often outperform more established immigrants and non-immigrants on a number of health-, education-, and conduct- or crime-related outcomes, despite the numerous barriers they face to successful social integration.<ref>

According to the UN, the number of first-generation [[Immigration|immigrants worldwide]] is 244&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates15.shtml|title=United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref> 
These large-scale population changes worldwide have led many scholars, across fields, to study the [[acculturation]] and adjustment of immigrants to their new homes. Specifically, researchers have examined immigrant experiences as they pertain to [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]], [[Mental health|mental]] and [[Health|physical]] health, and conduct/crime.

Researchers have tried to understand why later generations seem to perform less well than their forebears. They have found that it can be explained by non-optimal [[methodology]] and differences in the way generations are modified by the host culture.

== Challenges facing immigrants ==
Immigrants face many challenges as a result of migration, stemming from the fact that the nations and communities they settle in are culturally unfamiliar. As a result, they find themselves in an unwelcoming environment lacking in the infrastructure necessary to ensure a simple transition. Additionally, because general attitudes of the host society are often hostile and xenophobic,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schneider|first=S.

To compound all of these issues, the burden of acculturation is an added stressor. Navigating the divide between the heritage culture and the culture of the new society is difficult, as the traditions, beliefs, and norms of these two cultures are often in direct conflict.

In light of these obstacles, it is expected that recent immigrants would have outcomes inferior to those of their native-born or non-immigrant peers.

== Paradoxical findings ==
Despite the numerous challenges facing early generation immigrants, research on the mental and physical health, educational, and conduct-related outcomes of these populations has demonstrated a [[paradoxical]] pattern.

=== Mental health outcomes ===
Research with Filipino Americans has demonstrated that first-generation immigrants had lower levels of depressive symptoms than subsequent, US-born generations.<ref name=":7"/> First-generation Mexican immigrants to the United States were found to have lower incidences of mood disorders and substance use than their bicultural or subsequent generation counterparts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Burnam|first1=M.

=== Conduct-related outcomes ===
There is also evidence that the immigrant paradox extends to differential outcomes in conduct and/or crime.

== A special case: the immigrant paradox in refugees? ==
There is a general consensus that [[refugee]]s are at a particular disadvantage when it comes to successful [[Third country resettlement|resettlement]] in the host society, as the same [[Immigrant paradox#Challenges facing immigrants|challenges]] voluntary immigrants face are generally aggravated for refugees. However, some research has found evidence of a paradox, with refugees at least three times less likely to engage in substance use than non-immigrants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Salas-Wright|first1=Christopher P.|last2=Vaughn|first2=Michael G.|title=A "refugee paradox" for substance use disorders?|journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence|volume=142|pages=345–349|doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2014.06.008|pmid=24999058|pmc=4127091|year=2014}}</ref> Other research has found refugees to Denmark to have a lower likelihood of stroke and breast cancer compared to Danish natives, but higher likelihood of lung cancer, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Norredam|first1=Marie|last2=Agyemang|first2=Charles|last3=Hoejbjerg Hansen|first3=Oluf K.|last4=Petersen|first4=Jørgen H.|last5=Byberg|first5=Stine|last6=Krasnik|first6=Allan|last7=Kunst|first7=Anton E.|date=2014-08-01|title=Duration of residence and disease occurrence among refugees and family reunited immigrants: test of the 'healthy migrant effect' hypothesis|journal=Tropical Medicine & International Health|volume=19|issue=8|pages=958–967|doi=10.1111/tmi.12340|pmid=24889930|issn=1365-3156}}</ref> Notably, levels of all of these diseases among refugee populations eventually converged to the same levels as Danish natives with increased length of residency.

There may also be an immigrant paradox for the perinatal outcomes of refugees, with the majority of refugee women studied having a lower [[Birth rate|crude birth rate]], infant mortality rate, maternal mortality rate, and percentage of low birth weight than women in both their host country and their country of origin.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hynes|first=Michelle|date=2002-08-07|title=Reproductive Health Indicators and Outcomes Among Refugee and Internally Displaced Persons in Postemergency Phase Camps|journal=JAMA|volume=288|issue=5|pages=595–603|doi=10.1001/jama.288.5.595|pmid=12150671|issn=0098-7484|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Conflicting evidence ==
There is some doubt among scholars as to whether or not the phenomenon actually exists, with some findings conflicting with the body of research on immigrant outcomes. For example, among Asian Americans, [[limited English proficiency]] was consistently associated with worse physical and mental health outcomes.<ref name=":22"/> In addition to language proficiency, age at time of immigration is also an important factor, with older first-generation Mexican American youth more likely to drop out of school than their US-born and younger, first-generation counterparts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Landale|first1=Nancy S.|last2=Oropesa|first2=R.S.|last3=Llanes|first3=Daniel|title=Schooling, Work, and Idleness among Mexican and Non-Latino White Adolescents|journal=Social Science Research|volume=27|issue=4|pages=457–480|doi=10.1006/ssre.1998.0631|year=1998}}</ref> In further support of this conclusion, data from the [[Current Population Survey|CPS]] shows that immigrating as a teenager is associated with completing less schooling than immigrating before or after adolescence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Chiswick|first1=Barry R.|last2=DebBurman|first2=Noyna|date=2004-08-01|title=Educational attainment: analysis by immigrant generation|journal=Economics of Education Review|series=Special Issue In Honor of Lewis C.

In international research on the phenomenon, Europe's [[Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe|SHARE]] data demonstrated no evidence of a paradox, with immigrants having poorer health outcomes than native Europeans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Solé-Auró|first1=Aïda|last2=Crimmins|first2=Eileen M.|date=2008-12-01|title=Health of Immigrants in European Countries1|journal=International Migration Review|volume=42|issue=4|pages=861–876|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7379.2008.00150.x|pmid=21048888|pmc=2967040|issn=1747-7379}}</ref> A study in Canada found that recent and non-European immigrant women were more predisposed to developing [[postpartum depression]] than non-immigrant Canadians.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Urquia|first1=Marcelo L.|last2=O'Campo|first2=Patricia J.|last3=Heaman|first3=Maureen I.|date=2012-05-01|title=Revisiting the immigrant paradox in reproductive health: The roles of duration of residence and ethnicity|journal=Social Science & Medicine|volume=74|issue=10|pages=1610–1621|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.02.013|pmid=22464222}}</ref>

== Explanations ==

=== Acculturation and the erosion of protective factors ===
The most common hypothesis for the immigrant paradox considers recent and first-generation immigrants' comparative access to cultural and social protective factors. Despite being confronted with the many challenges arising from immigration and acculturation, first-generation immigrants have greater social and cultural capital than subsequent generations. These include stronger social networks and highly adaptive cultural practices concerning religion, diet, substance use, and parenting style.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Latinas/os in the United States: Changing the Face of América|last1=Acevedo-Garcia|first1=Dolores|last2=Bates|first2=Lisa M.|date=2008|publisher=Springer, Boston, MA|isbn=9780387719412|pages=101–113|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-71943-6_7}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Harker|first=Kathryn|date=2000–2001|title=Immigrant Generation, Assimilation, and Adolescent Psychological Well-Being|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/josf79&div=42&g_sent=1&casa_token=uMlrSOoLQo4AAAAA:BVv50TMN4gEYETcl44cdzUNOydpsNfMnlkLWcDcA-hsH2xnZm4f79JrvKr_-F0vj4jzxycA&collection=journals|journal=Social Forces|volume=79|issue=3|pages=969–1004|doi=10.1353/sof.2001.0010}}</ref> Researchers also posit that first-generation immigrants are more likely to place high importance upon academic success due to fear of limited employment opportunities in the host society.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Angel L.|last2=Jamison|first2=Kenneth M.|last3=Trujillo|first3=Monica H.|title=Disparities in the Educational Success of Immigrants: An Assessment of the Immigrant Effect for Asians and Latinos|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=620|issue=1|pages=90–114|doi=10.1177/0002716208322765|year=2008}}</ref> These protective factors result in superior lifetime health, educational, financial, and conduct-related outcomes.<ref name=":6" /> Additionally, by having access to multiple cultural frameworks, recent immigrants are able to [[Code-switching|code-switch]] between frameworks or engage in downward [[Social comparison theory|social comparison]] as methods of self-protection.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last1=Suárez-Orozco|first1=Carola|last2=Carhill|first2=Avary|date=2008-09-01|title=Afterword: New directions in research with immigrant families and their children|journal=New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development|volume=2008|issue=121|pages=87–104|doi=10.1002/cd.224|pmid=18792953|issn=1534-8687}}</ref>

In comparison, subsequent generations may not have access to such social and cultural capital, having been socialized into the norms and expectations of the host society (i.e., consuming more processed and unhealthy foods, having a smaller network of same-ethnicity peers, increased substance use). Further, intergenerational conflict is more likely between first-generation immigrants and their second-generation children due to differing cultural practices, with parents being accustomed to the norms of their culture of origin and children having been socialized into the norms of the host society.<ref name=":4" /> This type of conflict has been linked to poorer outcomes for children.

A third cost of acculturation is linked to immigrant children's cultural [[Socialization#Racial socialization|socialization]]. A strong sense of ethnic identity and pride in one's cultural heritage is generally understood to be protective from negative mental health outcomes.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last=Mossakowski|first=Krysia N.|date=2003|title=Coping with Perceived Discrimination: Does Ethnic Identity Protect Mental Health?|jstor=1519782|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=44|issue=3|pages=318–331|doi=10.2307/1519782|pmid=14582311}}</ref> However, with increased length of stay in the host society, subsequent generations are likely to report decreasing levels of involvement in culturally important traditions and practices. With this comes decreasing strength of ethnic identity. Second-generation immigrants are also less likely to endorse meritocratic views, which is similarly correlated with decreasing strength of ethnic identity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wiley|first1=Shaun|last2=Deaux|first2=Kay|last3=Hagelskamp|first3=Carolin|title=Born in the USA: How immigrant generation shapes meritocracy and its relation to ethnic identity and collective action.|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=171–180|doi=10.1037/a0027661|pmid=22506820|year=2012}}</ref> These attributes are all associated with poorer mental health.<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Duffey|first1=Thelma|last2=Somody|first2=Catherine|date=2011-07-05|title=The Role of Relational-Cultural Theory in Mental Health Counseling|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|volume=33|issue=3|pages=223–242|doi=10.17744/mehc.33.3.c10410226u275647}}</ref>

==== Possible benefits of ethnic enclaves ====
:See: [[Hispanic paradox#Barrio advantage|Barrio advantage]]
First-generation immigrants often settle in ethnic enclaves, which carry a host of advantages. Residents of these neighborhoods have access to a strong and supportive network of same-ethnicity peers and potential access to culturally sensitive healthcare providers that may allow for increased financial gain and better physical and mental health outcomes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mazumdar|first1=Sanjoy|last2=Mazumdar|first2=Shampa|last3=Docuyanan|first3=Faye|last4=McLaughlin|first4=Colette Marie|title=Creating a sense of place: the Vietnamese-Americans and Little Saigon|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=20|issue=4|pages=319–333|doi=10.1006/jevp.2000.0170|year=2000|url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt3km8x13g/qt3km8x13g.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Joshua S.|last2=Kagawa-Singer|first2=Marjorie|date=2007-07-30|title=Increasing Access to Care for Cultural and Linguistic Minorities: Ethnicity-Specific Health Care Organizations and Infrastructure|journal=Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved|volume=18|issue=3|pages=532–549|doi=10.1353/hpu.2007.0073|pmid=17675712|issn=1548-6869}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Barry R.|first1=Chiswick|last2=Miller|first2=Paul W.|date=2005-03-01|title=Do Enclaves Matter in Immigrant Adjustment?|journal=City & Community|volume=4|issue=1|pages=5–35|doi=10.1111/j.1535-6841.2005.00101.x|issn=1540-6040|hdl=10419/21507|hdl-access=free}}</ref> Ethnic enclaves also eliminate the challenges associated with language barriers, with residents often sharing linguistic similarity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bauer|first1=Thomas|last2=Epstein|first2=Gil S.|last3=Gang|first3=Ira N.|date=2005-11-01|title=Enclaves, language, and the location choice of migrants|journal=Journal of Population Economics|volume=18|issue=4|pages=649–662|doi=10.1007/s00148-005-0009-z|issn=0933-1433|hdl=10419/21370|url=http://www.sas.rutgers.edu/virtual/snde/wp/2002-17.pdf}}<!--http://www.sas.rutgers.edu/virtual/snde/wp/2002-17.pdf--></ref>

=== Healthy immigrant selection ===
Another common explanation for the immigrant paradox is that the vast majority of superior outcomes among early generations of immigrants can be accounted for by a selection effect. Proponents of this hypothesis argue that only the most psychologically and physically healthy individuals migrate from their country of origin, and therefore have superior outcomes to begin with.<ref name=":3" />

=== Methodological concerns ===
Much of the literature on the immigrant paradox in mental health relies on self-report data. This may be problematic in that certain populations may differentially interpret questions in ways that are meaningful and result in significant disparities between groups.<ref name=":1" /> Similarly, many measures view mental health solely through a Western lens, accounting only for the types of symptoms commonly expressed in Western societies.<ref name=":22"/> This may result in the underreporting of poor mental health among non-Western populations.

Another issue in research on immigrants is the grouping of highly diverse ethnic groups together in monolithic racial categories,<ref name=":5" /> namely the pan-ethnic "Asian" and "Latino" categories. Much of the research on Latinos and the immigrant paradox has been conducted with Mexican American populations, ignoring the fact that there are 32 other countries that fall under the Latin American label. Similarly, much research on Asian Americans has been conducted with [[East Asia]]n populations, ignoring the differential treatment and experiences of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]ns, and the different refugee status of individuals across Asia (examples include [[Bhutanese refugees|Lhotshampa]] refugees, who are of South Asian heritage, and Cambodian refugees, who are of Southeast Asian heritage). Such groupings are problematic in that they erase the large diversity in [[socioeconomic status]], educational background, and historical trauma of each of these ethnic groups – factors which all contribute to the consequent positive or negative outcomes of immigrants.

== Future directions in immigrant research ==
Carola Suárez-Orozco, Ph.D. calls for increased research on the psychology of immigrants paying attention to differences in refugee status, documentation status, gender, and ethnic group (in lieu of using pan-ethnic groupings).<ref name=":5" /> Research must also consider seasonal migrants, the differential [[racialization]] of ethnic groups, and the role of English proficiency on educational and health outcomes.
