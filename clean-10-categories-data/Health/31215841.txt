'''Abnormal behavior of birds in captivity''' has been found to occur among both domesticated and wild birds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=van Hoek|first1=Caroline S.|last2=Ten Cate|first2=Carel|date=January 1998|title=Abnormal Behavior in Caged Birds Kept as Pets|journal=Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science|volume=1|issue=1|pages=51–64|doi=10.1207/s15327604jaws0101_5|pmid=16363987|issn=1088-8705}}</ref> 
[[Abnormality (behavior)|Abnormal behavior]] can be defined in several ways. Statistically, 'abnormal' is when the occurrence, frequency or intensity of a behaviour varies [[statistically significant]]ly, either more or less, from the normal value.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/abnormal-psychology.html|title=Abnormal Psychology {{!}} Simply Psychology|last=McLeod|first=S.|date=2018|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref>  This means that theoretically, almost any behaviour could become 'abnormal' in an individual.  Less formally, 'abnormal' includes any activity judged to be outside the normal behaviour pattern for captive [[birds]] of that particular class or age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/abnormal+behavior|title=abnormal behaviour|access-date=April 6, 2013}}</ref> For example, running rather than flying may be a normal behaviour and regularly observed in one species, however, in another species it might be normal but becomes 'abnormal' if it reaches a high frequency, or in another species it is rarely observed and any incidence is considered 'abnormal'.  This article does not include 'one-off' behaviours performed by individual birds that might be considered abnormal for that individual, unless these are performed repeatedly by other individuals in the species and are recognised as part of the [[ethogram]] of that species.

Most abnormal behaviours can be categorised collectively (e.g., eliminative, ingestive, stereotypies), however, many abnormal behaviours fall debatebly into several of these categories and categorisation is therefore not attempted in this article.  Abnormal behaviours here are considered to be related to captive housing but may also be due to medical conditions.  The article does not include behaviours in birds that are genetically modified to express abnormal behaviour.

==Behaviors== 
When housed under captive or commercial conditions, birds often show a range of abnormal behaviours. These are often self-injurious or harmful to other individuals, and can include feather and toe pecking, cannibalism, stereotypy, vent pecking, as well as abnormal sexual behaviours such as chronic egg laying.

===Feather and toe pecking===
{{main|toe pecking}}

Feather pecking is an abnormal behaviour observed in birds in captivity (primarily in laying hens)<ref name=":2"/> whereby one bird repeatedly pecks the feathers of another. Toe pecking is a similar occurrence in commercialized hens which includes repeatedly pecking the toes of another. Each of these behaviours have been tied to physiological stress (i.e., extremely enlarged adrenal glands) likely caused by housing conditions in captivity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Buitenhuis|first1=A.

===Cannibalism===
{{see also|Cannibalism in poultry}}
Cannibalism in birds of captivity is a behaviour often linked to feather pecking. With increasing frequency and intensity of feather pecking, the risk and prevalence of cannibalism increases.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Huber-Eicher|first1=B|last2=Sebö|first2=F|date=November 2001|title=The prevalence of feather pecking and development in commercial flocks of laying hens|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=74|issue=3|pages=223–231|doi=10.1016/s0168-1591(01)00173-3|issn=0168-1591}}</ref> Since feather pecking leads to increased food consumption due to heat loss through the skin of the bird, and feather pecking is an already aggressive behaviour that consists of cannibalistic qualities, cannibalism is a common consequential effect. Cannibalism is defined as the act of consuming all or part of another individual of the same species as food.<ref name=":2" /><ref name="Savory, (2010)">Savory, J., (2010).

===Stereotypy===
{{see also|Stereotypy (non-human)}}
Stereotypies are invariant, repetitive behaviour patterns with no blatant function or objective, and seem to be restricted to captive and/or mentally-impaired animals.<ref name="Mason 1015–1037">{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Georgia J.|date=June 1991|title=Stereotypies: a critical review|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=41|issue=6|pages=1015–1037|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80640-2|issn=0003-3472|hdl=10214/4622|s2cid=53187334|hdl-access=free}}</ref> Stereotypies are the result of inability of an animal to perform a normal behaviour due to external environmental conditions or circumstance. A common stereotypy in laying hens is pacing which involves the animal constantly walking back and forth in a seemingly ritualistic manner due to no access to a suitable nest site.<ref name="Mason 1015–1037"/> The pacing stereotypy is also hypothesized to arise from intentional movements of escape, specifically in captive animals such as birds. The overabundance as well as lack of stimulation associated with the sub-optimal environment of captivity are the common factors amongst development of stereotypy behaviours in birds.<ref name="Mason 1015–1037"/>

===Vent pecking===
{{main|Vent pecking}}
Vent pecking is an abnormal behaviour observed in birds in captivity that involves pecking and causing damage to the cloaca, its surrounding skin, and underlying tissue of another bird. Occurrence of vent pecking is primarily immediately after a bird has oviposited when the cloaca is red and enlarged.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sherwin|first=Chris M.|chapter=The Welfare and Ethical Assessment of Housing for Egg Production|date=2009-12-21|pages=237–258|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789048136490|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3650-6_10|title=The Welfare of Domestic Fowl and Other Captive Birds|volume=9|series=Animal Welfare}}</ref> Vent pecking, like feather pecking, is a gateway behaviour to cannibalism due to its cannibalistic features of hostility towards another individual that involves the aggressive tearing and damaging of the skin and tissue. Vent cannibalism was found to be the most common type of cannibalism causing death in autopsy results of laying hens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Weitzenbürger|first1=D.|last2=Vits|first2=A.|last3=Hamann|first3=H.|last4=Distl|first4=O.|date=October 2005|title=Effect of furnished small group housing systems and furnished cages on mortality and causes of death in two layer strains|journal=British Poultry Science|volume=46|issue=5|pages=553–559|doi=10.1080/00071660500303206|pmid=16359107|s2cid=10933379|issn=0007-1668}}</ref><ref name="Sherwin, 2010">Sherwin, C.M., (2010).

==Causes== 
When analyzing the behaviour of birds in captivity, what is considered normal or abnormal behaviour is dependent on the form and frequency that the particular behaviour is expressed in the natural environment.<ref>Wiepkema, P.R. (1985). Abnormal behavior in farm animals: ethological implications. Netherlands Journal of Zoology, 35, 279-299.</ref> Birds raised in pet stores tend to be raised with other birds, however, after being sold and taken to the owner's home, birds in captivity are often housed in isolation and in environments lacking abundant resources or complex stimuli. In the United States, it is estimated that forty million birds are kept caged and improperly cared for.<ref>“There is no such thing as a cage bird”. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. <http://www.peta.org/issues/companion-animals/caging-birds.aspx></ref> Because of these inappropriate housing conditions, abnormal behaviour patterns may appear in [[birdcage|caged birds]] kept as pets. Once established, these abnormal behaviours in birds are often not alterable.<ref>Ten Cate, C. (1995). Behavioral development in birds and the implications of imprinting and song learning for captive propagation. Research and Captive Propagation, 187-197.</ref>

When social interactions amongst birds are absent or inadequate, abnormal social behaviour may develop. For example, a study regarding [[parrot]]s that had been isolated in cages demonstrated that most birds showing this [[social deprivation]] had significant behavioural disturbances, such as aggressive behaviour, [[feather-plucking|feather picking]], [[self-harm|self-mutilation]], restlessness, screaming, apathetic behavior, and [[stereotypy|stereotypies]].<ref name="Lantermann, W. 1993">Lantermann, W. (1993). Social deprivation in Amazon parrots. Animal Behaviour, 38, 511-520.</ref>  Cannibalism often occurs in large [[animal husbandry]] systems, which are usually impoverished environments with a lack of opportunities.<ref>Hughes, B.O. & Duncan, I.J.H. (1998). The notion of ethological “need,” models of motivation and animal welfare. Animal Behaviour, 36, 1696-1707.</ref> In addition, studies of caged canaries have revealed two common stereotypies.<ref name="Sargent" /> These include spot picking, where birds repeatedly touch a particular spot in the environment with the tip of their beak, and route tracing, a pacing behaviour associated with physical restrictions in movement imposed by the cage. The absence of [[bird vocalization|song learning]] in [[zebra finch]]es has also been implicated as a behavioural abnormality.<ref>Slater, P.J, B., Jones, A. & Ten Cate, C. (1993). Can lack of experience delay the end of the  sensitive phase for song learning? Netherlands Journal of Zoology, 43, 80-90.</ref> In these birds, the social interaction of a young male with his song tutor is important for normal song development. Without the stimulus, the song, which is necessary for mating behavior, will not be learned. 

Researchers have analyzed ways to alleviate some abnormal behaviours in caged birds. Presenting these birds with novel stimuli e.g. a mirror or plastic birds, and social stimuli, such as a brief view of a bird in another cage, significantly reduced stereotypies.<ref>Keiper, R.R. (1970). Studies of stereotypy function in the canary (Serinus canarius). Animal Behaviour, 18, 353-357.</ref> In addition, it has been suggested that keeping caged birds in pairs or small groups may reduce the development of abnormal behaviours, however, little quantitative evidence has thus far been collected to support this claim.<ref name="Lantermann, W. 1993"/>

In addition to the abnormal behaviours exhibited as a result of commercialized captivity such as for poultry, there also exist problematic behaviours that occur as a function of the social deprivation associated with domestication. [[Social deprivation]] is the prevention or reduction of normal interaction between an individual and others in their species.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Bassuk|first1=Ellen L.|chapter=Social Deprivation|pages=33–55|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9780306477232|last2=Donelan|first2=Brigid|last3=Selema|first3=Bukelwa|last4=Ali|first4=Salma|last5=Aguiar|first5=Adriana Cavalcanti|last6=Eisenstein|first6=Evelyn|last7=Vostanis|first7=Panos|last8=Varavikova|first8=Elena|last9=Tashjian|first9=Madeleine|doi=10.1007/978-0-306-47968-7_3|title=Trauma Interventions in War and Peace|series=International and Cultural Psychology Series|year=2003}}</ref> Currently the dominant method for rearing domesticated birds is "hand-rearing" which requires chicks be separated from their parents for periods of time up to several months.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Rebecca|date=January 2008|title=Hand-Rearing: Behavioural Impacts and Implications for Captive Parrot Welfare|url=http://biology-web.nmsu.edu/~houde/Seibert_2006_parrot_social_behavior.pdf#page=87|journal=Manual of Parrot Behaviour|pages=83–91}}</ref> The social deprivation associated with this technique of upbringing is one of the most detrimental forms of social deprivation since even short-term disruptions in parental care can cause extreme abnormal behaviour in the affected young.<ref name=":0" /> For example, normal sexual and habitat imprinting is altered in both male and female birds as a result of maternal separation, as well as individual ability to adapt to stressors within the environment.<ref name=":0" /> [[Neophobia]] is the avoidance of novel objects in the environment and is diminished with social deprivation and maternal separation.<ref name=":0" /> A lack of neophobia can decrease probability of survival due to the affected animal's lack of hesitation to approach potentially dangerous stimuli. Moreover, many juveniles require a song tutor to accomplish the song learning necessary for successful mating practices.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Ten Cate|first=C|date=1995|title=Behavioural development in birds and the implications of imprinting and song learning for captive propagation.|journal=Research and Captive Propagation|pages=187–197}}</ref> Therefore, socially deprived juveniles may exhibit abnormal vocal and consequent mating behaviours which may be detrimental to their survival.

It is important to note that once established, these abnormal behaviours are often not transformable.<ref name=":1" /> There is presently little research regarding a solution to the abnormality caused by captivity in birds; however, it has been suggested that keeping domesticated caged birds in small groups or pairs may reduce the likelihood of developing abnormal behaviours.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lantermann|first=W|date=1993|title=Social Deprivation in Amazon Parrots|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=38|pages=511–520}}</ref>
