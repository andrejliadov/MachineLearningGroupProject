The '''Mexican paradox''' is the observation that Mexican people exhibit a surprisingly low incidence of [[low birth weight]] (especially foreign-born Mexican mothers<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=El-Sayed|first=Abdulrahman M.|last2=Paczkowski|first2=Magdalena M.|last3=March|first3=Dana|last4=Galea|first4=Sandro|date=2014-11-01|title=Trends in the Mexican infant mortality paradox over the past two decades|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|volume=24|issue=11|pages=831–836|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2014.09.005|pmid=25282323|issn=1047-2797}}</ref>), contrary to what would be expected from their [[socioeconomic status]] (SES). This appears as an [[outlier]] in graphs correlating SES with low-birth-weight rates. The medical causes of lower rates of low birth weights among birthing Mexican mothers has been called into question.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Buekens P, Notzon F, Kotelchuck M, Wilcox A|date=August 2000|title=Why do Mexican Americans give birth to few low-birth-weight infants?|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/152/4/347|journal=Am.

The [[hispanic paradox]] refers to the same phenomenon observed across the populations of South and Central America, where Mexicans remain the healthier.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/why-mexican-immigrants-are-healthier-than-their-us-born-peers-75028|title=Why Mexican immigrants are healthier than their US-born peers|last=Waldstein|first=Anna|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref>

== Description ==
The results of a study showed that the mean birth weight of Mexican-American babies was 3.34&nbsp;kg (7.37&nbsp;lbs), while that of [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|non-Hispanic White]] babies was 3.39&nbsp;kg (7.48&nbsp;lbs.). This finding re-emphasized the independence of mean birth weight and LBW. This however did not refute the discrepancies in LBW for Mexicans. The study also showed that the overall [[preterm birth]] rate was higher among Mexican Americans (10.6%) than non-Hispanic Whites (9.3%). In North Carolina, from 1996 to 2000, the infant death rate was 6.1 for Mexican-born infants, in comparison to 6.6 for White infants, and 15 for Black infants.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://indyweek.com/api/content/0c520735-4a00-5a42-9720-0f9beea5bcb3/|title=The "Mexican Paradox"|last=Solow|first=Barbara|date=2003-01-22|website=INDY Week|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref> The overall hypothesis of the authors was that this finding reflected an error in recorded [[gestational age]], described in a strongly [[bimodal]] birth-weight distribution at young gestational ages for Mexican-Americans.

Other external factors have been identified, such as protein-rich diets, extended family ties, and strong religious beliefs. A 1995 study suggested that the Virgin of Guadeloupe encouraged healthy births thanks to its iconic pregnancy symbolism.<ref name=":0" /> Another study suggested that resistance to changes in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] is responsible for the positive birth weight association for Mexican-American mothers.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=McGlade MS, Saha S, Dahlstrom ME |title=The Latina Paradox: An Opportunity for Restructuring Prenatal Care Delivery |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=94 |issue=12 |pages=2062–5 |date=December 2004 |pmid=15569952 |pmc=1448590 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.94.12.2062}}</ref> Yet another study showed that Mexicans blend traditional and modern medicine, a potential explanation for the paradox.<ref name=":2" />

It was also observed that, the longer Mexican women live in the United States, the more their infant mortality risks increased.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horevitz|first=Elizabeth|last2=Organista|first2=Kurt C.|date=2013-02-01|title=The Mexican Health Paradox: Expanding the Explanatory Power of the Acculturation Construct|journal=Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=3–34|doi=10.1177/0739986312460370|issn=0739-9863}}</ref> Lower occurrences of [[periodontal disease]] with Mexican-American women was also suggested as an explanation for the Mexican paradox.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Xiong|first=X.|last2=Buekens|first2=P.|last3=Vastardis|first3=S.|last4=Wu|first4=T.|date=2006|title=Periodontal disease as one possible explanation for the Mexican paradox|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=67|issue=6|pages=1348–1354|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2006.05.059|issn=0306-9877|pmid=16935435}}</ref> Another study revealed that, beyond healthy births, Mexican infants also have lower developmental outcomes in their development years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Padilla|first=Yolanda C.|last2=Boardman|first2=Jason D.|last3=Hummer|first3=Robert A.|last4=Espitia|first4=Marilyn|date=2002|title=Is the Mexican American "Epidemiologic Paradox" Advantage at Birth Maintained through Early Childhood?|journal=Social Forces|volume=80|issue=3|pages=1101–1123|issn=0037-7732|jstor=3086467|doi=10.1353/sof.2002.0014}}</ref>

A 2014 study concluded that the Mexican paradox is disappearing slowly, most of the comparison data between Mexican-born infants and White infants being fairly similar in recent years.<ref name=":1" /> Another 2016 study showed that the Mexican paradox erodes in the third generation of the immigrated family.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Giuntella|first=Osea|date=2016-12-01|title=The Hispanic health paradox: New evidence from longitudinal data on second and third-generation birth outcomes|journal=SSM - Population Health|volume=2|pages=84–89|doi=10.1016/j.ssmph.2016.02.013|pmid=29349130|issn=2352-8273|doi-access=free}}</ref>

It was also verified that Mexicans have less high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases and most cancers than the US population in general.<ref name=":2" />
