Some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as ''C. difficile''.[16]

Antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. This can lead to an overgrowth of ''C. difficile'', which flourishes under these conditions. Pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of "pseudomembrane", a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] [[Clindamycin]]-resistant ''C. difficile'' was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in New York, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts between 1989 and 1992.<ref name="Johnson1999">{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson S, Samore MH, Farrow KA, Killgore GE, Tenover FC, Lyras D, Rood JI, DeGirolami P, Baltch AL, Rafferty ME, Pear SM, Gerding DN|year=1999|title=Epidemics of diarrhea caused by a clindamycin-resistant strain of ''Clostridium difficile'' in four hospitals|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=341|issue=23|pages=1645–1651|doi=10.1056/NEJM199911253412203|pmid=10572152}}</ref> Geographically dispersed outbreaks of ''C. difficile'' strains resistant to [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in North America in 2005.<ref name="Loo_2005">{{cite journal|vauthors=Loo VG, Poirier L, Miller MA, Oughton M, Libman MD, Michaud S, Bourgault AM, Nguyen T, Frenette C, Kelly M, Vibien A, Brassard P, Fenn S, Dewar K, Hudson TJ, Horn R, René P, Monczak Y, Dascal A|year=2005|title=A predominantly clonal multi-institutional outbreak of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality|journal=N Engl J Med|volume=353|issue=23|pages=2442–9|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051639|pmid=16322602}}</ref>

Tuberculosis better known as TB has one of the highest mortality rates among pathogens in the world. Mortality rates have not seen a significant decrease due to its growing resistance to certain antibiotics.<ref name="innovations.ahrq.gov"/> Although there is years worth of research and many work hours that have been devoted to the creation of a vaccine, one still does not exist. TB has a very high level of virulence which is mainly due in part to the fact it is extremely transmissible. TB was considered one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of [[streptomycin]] by [[Selman Waksman]] in 1943.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Herzog H|year=1998|title=History of Tuberculosis|journal=Respiration|volume=65|issue=1|pages=5–15|doi=10.1159/000029220|pmid=9523361}}</ref> However, the bacteria soon developed resistance. Since then, drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] have been used. ''M. tuberculosis'' develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. These types of mutations can lead to genotype and phenotype changes that can contribute to reproductive success therefore they can be passed on and evolve into resistant bacteria. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug.

===''Mycoplasma genitalium''===
''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' is a small pathogenic bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. It is still controversial whether or not this bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. Infection with ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' sometimes produces clinical symptoms, or a combination of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the [[urethra]] ([[urethritis]]) both in men and women, which is associated with [[mucopurulent discharge]] in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating.

Treatment of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly developing multi-drug resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that ''M. genitalium'' infections are not routinely detected.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Suneta|first1=Soni|last2=Parkhouse|first2=Andy|last3=Gillian|first3=Dean|date=24 April 2017|title=Macrolide and quinolone-resistant ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' in a man with persistent urethritis: the tip of the British iceberg?|url=http://sti.bmj.com/content/early/2017/04/24/sextrans-2016-053077|journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections|volume=93|issue=8|pages=556–557<!-- Citation Bot-->|doi=10.1136/sextrans-2016-053077|pmid=28438948|s2cid=9178150|access-date=6 October 2017}}</ref> [[Azithromycin]] is the most common first-line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yew|first1=H.

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
{{Main|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membrane]]s and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] because of significant kidney toxicity. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now "quite common" in hospitals{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

=== ''Streptococcus'' ===
''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A ''Streptococcus'': GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Strains of ''S. pyogenes'' resistant to [[macrolide]] antibiotics have emerged; however, all strains remain uniformly susceptible to [[penicillin]].<ref name="pmid15109426">{{cite journal|vauthors=Albrich WC, Monnet DL, Harbarth S|year=2004|title=Antibiotic selection pressure and resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes|journal=Emerg.

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization. ''S. pneumoniae'' is responsible for [[pneumonia]], [[bacteremia]], [[otitis media]], [[meningitis]], [[sinusitis]], [[peritonitis]] and [[arthritis]].<ref name="pmid15109426" />

===''Campylobacter''===
''[[Campylobacter]]'' causes diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and abdominal cramps. Serious complications such as temporary paralysis can also occur. Physicians rely on [[ciprofloxacin]] and [[azithromycin]] for treating patients with severe disease although ''Campylobacter'' is showing resistance to these antibiotics.<ref name="CDC2013" />

===''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''===
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea}}
''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes [[gonorrhea]], a sexually transmitted disease that can result in discharge and inflammation at the urethra, cervix, pharynx, or rectum.<ref name="CDC2013" /> It can cause pelvic pain, pain on urination, penile and vaginal discharge, as well as systemic symptoms. It can also cause severe reproductive complications.<ref name="CDC2013" />

CRE are resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. Almost half of hospital patients who get bloodstream CRE infections die from the infection.<ref name="CDC2013" />

=====''Klebsiella pneumoniae''=====
Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase ([[Beta-lactamase#KPC (K. pneumoniae carbapenemase) (Class A)|KPC]])-producing bacteria are a group of emerging highly drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli causing infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality whose incidence is rapidly increasing in a variety of clinical settings around the world.

The researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in ''E. coli'' developed because of epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene. This was further supported by data showing that reversion to antibiotic sensitivity was relatively common as well. This could only be explained by epigenetics.<ref name="Adam2008" /> [[Epigenetics]] is a type of inheritance in which gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. There are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur, including [[DNA methylation|methylation of DNA]] and [[histone]] modification; however, the important point is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.<ref name="Adam2008" />

=====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''=====
''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is a highly prevalent [[opportunistic pathogen]]. One of the most worrisome characteristics of ''P. aeruginosa'' is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of [[efflux (microbiology)|multidrug efflux pumps]] with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., ''mexAB-oprM'', ''mexXY'') and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes.<ref name="Poole2004">{{cite journal |author=Poole K |title=Efflux-mediated multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=12–26 |year=2004 |pmid=14706082 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.00763.x }}</ref> ''P. aeruginosa'' has the ability to produce 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics. The study experimented with the ''P. aeruginosa'' [[biofilms]] and found that a disruption of relA and spoT genes produced an inactivation of the Stringent response (SR) in cells with nutrient limitation, which provides cells be more susceptible to antibiotics.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nguyen D, Joshi-Datar A, Lepine F, Bauerle E, Olakanmi O, Beer K, McKay G, Siehnel R, Schafhauser J, Wang Y, Britigan BE, Singh PK |title=Active Starvation Responses Mediate Antibiotic Tolerance in Biofilms and Nutrient-Limited Bacteria |journal=Science |volume=334 |issue=6058 |pages=982–6 |year=2011 |pmid=22096200 |doi=10.1126/science.1211037 |bibcode=2011Sci...334..982N |pmc=4046891}}</ref>
