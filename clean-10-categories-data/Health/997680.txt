'''Endurance''' (also related to [[wikt:sufferance|sufferance]], [[Resilience (materials science)|resilience]], [[wikt:constitution|constitution]], [[wikt:fortitude|fortitude]], and [[Hardiness (psychological)|hardiness]]) is the ability of an [[organism]] to exert itself and remain active for a long period of time, as well as its ability to resist, withstand, recover from, and have immunity to [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], wounds, or [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. It is usually used in [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic exercise]]. The definition of 'long' varies according to the type of exertion – minutes for high intensity anaerobic exercise, hours or days for low intensity aerobic exercise. Training for endurance can reduce the ability to exert endurance [[physical strength|strength]]<ref>{{cite journal |last = Hickson |first =  RC | year = 1980 |title = Interference of strength development by simultaneously training for strength and endurance over a long period |journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology |publisher = Springer Verlag |volume = 45 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 255–63 |doi = 10.1007/BF00421333 |pmid = 7193134}}<!--|accessdate = 2007-05-07 --></ref> unless an individual also undertakes [[Strength training|resistance training]] to counteract this effect.

When a person is able to accomplish or withstand a higher amount of effort than their original capabilities their endurance is increasing which to many personnel indicates progress. In looking to improve one's endurance they may slowly increase the amount of [[Strength training#Terminology|repetitions]] or time spent, if higher repetitions are taken rapidly muscle strength improves while less endurance is gained.<ref>{{cite web|title=Physical Activity Line: BC's Primary Physical Activity Counseling Service & Your FREE Resource! - Physical Activity Line: BC's Primary Physical Activity Counseling Service & Your FREE Resource!|url=http://physicalactivityline.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=74:muscular-strength-and-endurance&Itemid=69|website=physicalactivityline.com}}</ref> Increasing endurance has been proven to release endorphins resulting in a positive mind.

The term '''stamina''' is sometimes used synonymously and interchangeably with endurance.
In military settings, endurance is considered the ability of a force to sustain high levels of combat potential relative to its opponent over the duration of a campaign.<ref>Headquarter, Department of the Army (1994). Leader’s Manual for Combat Stress Control, FM 22-51, Washington DC.</ref>

Endurance may also refer to an ability to keep going through a tough situation involving hardship, stress, etc. (see [[patience]])

=== Training ===
Different types of endurance performance can be trained in specified ways. Adaptation of exercise plans should follow individual goals.

Calculating the Intensity of exercise the individual capabilies should be considered. Effective training starts within half the individual performance capability. Performance capability is expressed by [[maximum heart rate]]. Best results can be achieved within 55 up to 65% of maximum heart rate. Aerobic, anaerobic and further thresholds are not to be mentioned within extensive endurance exercises. In general surveillance of training intensity is achieved through measuring the heart rate.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tomasits |first=Josef |last2=Haber |first2=Paul |title=Leistungsphysiologie – Grundlagen für Trainer, Physiotherapeuten und Masseure |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2008 |isbn=9783211720196 }}</ref>
