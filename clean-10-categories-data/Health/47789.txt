</ref> It consists of the expectations of an individual or society for a good life. These expectations are guided by the values, goals and socio-cultural context in which an individual lives.

== Engaged Theory ==
One approach, called [[engaged theory]], outlined in the journal of ''Applied Research in the Quality of Life'', posits four domains in assessing quality of life: ecology, economics, politics and culture.<ref>{{Cite journal | date=2012 | last1= Magee | first1= Liam | last2= James | first2= Paul | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy| title= Measuring Social Sustainability: A Community-Centred Approach | url= https://www.academia.edu/5178539 | journal= Applied Research in the Quality of Life | volume= 7 | issue= 3 | pages= 239–61 | doi=10.1007/s11482-012-9166-x}}</ref> In the domain of culture, for example, it includes the following subdomains of quality of life:

* Belief and ideas
* Creativity and recreation
* Enquiry and learning
* Gender and generations
* Identity and engagement
* Memory and projection
* Well-being and health

Also frequently related are concepts such as freedom, [[human rights]], and [[happiness]]. However, since happiness is subjective and difficult to measure, other measures are generally given priority. It has also been shown that happiness, as much as it can be measured, does not necessarily increase correspondingly with the comfort that results from increasing income. As a result, standard of living should not be taken to be a measure of happiness.<ref name="DHG" /><ref>{{cite book |first1= Richard |last1= Layard |author1-link= Richard Layard, Baron Layard |title=Happiness: Lessons from a New Science |date = 6 April 2006 |publisher= Penguin |location= London |isbn= 978-0-14-101690-0}}</ref> Also sometimes considered related is the concept of [[human security]], though the latter may be considered at a more basic level and for all people.

==Quantitative measurement==
Unlike [[Gross domestic product|''per capita'' GDP]] or [[standard of living]], both of which can be measured in financial terms, it is harder to make objective or long-term measurements of the quality of life experienced by nations or other groups of people. Researchers have begun in recent times to distinguish two aspects of personal well-being: ''[[Emotional well-being]]'', in which respondents are asked about the quality of their everyday emotional experiences—the frequency and intensity of their experiences of, for example, joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection— and ''life evaluation'', in which respondents are asked to think about their life in general and evaluate it against a scale.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1011492107|title=High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being|date=2010|last1=Kahneman|first1=D.|last2=Deaton|first2=A.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=107|issue=38|pages=16489–16493|pmid=20823223|pmc=2944762|bibcode=2010PNAS..10716489K}}</ref> Such and other systems and scales of measurement have been in use for some time. Research has attempted to examine the relationship between quality of life and productivity.<ref>[http://www.kansascityfed.org/Publicat/RESWKPAP/PDF/RWP07-02v4.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, ''The Increasing Importance of Quality of Life'', October 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019030621/http://www.kansascityfed.org/Publicat/RESWKPAP/PDF/RWP07-02v4.pdf |date=19 October 2012 }}</ref> There are many different methods of measuring quality of life in terms of health care, wealth and materialistic goods. However, it is much more difficult to measure [[Meaning of life|meaningful]] expression of one's desires. One way to do so is to evaluate the scope of how individuals have fulfilled their own ideals. Quality of life can simply mean [[happiness]], the subjective state of mind. By using that mentality, citizens of a developing country appreciate more since they are content with the basic necessities of health care, education and child protection.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Singer|first=Peter|date=2011|title=THE BIG QUESTION: Quality of Life: WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

According to ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]]:{{quote|While Quality of Life (QOL) has long been an explicit or implicit policy goal, adequate definition and measurement have been elusive. Diverse "objective" and "subjective" indicators across a range of disciplines and scales, and recent work on [[subjective well-being]] (SWB) surveys and the psychology of happiness have spurred renewed interest.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index169.html|author=Costanza, R.|display-authors=etal|year=2008|title=An Integrative Approach to Quality of Life Measurement, Research, and Policy|journal=S.A.P.I.EN.S|volume=1|issue=1}}</ref>}}

===Human Development Index===
{{Main | Human Development Index}}
Perhaps the most commonly used international measure of development is the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), which combines measures of life expectancy, education, and standard of living, in an attempt to quantify the options available to individuals within a given society.  The HDI is used by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] in their [[Human Development Report]].

===World Happiness Report===
{{Main | World Happiness Report}}
[[File:Happiness score of countries according to the World Happiness Report (2018).png|thumb|250px|Map showing happiness of countries by their score according to the [http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/ 2018 World Happiness Report].]]
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey on the state of global happiness. It ranks 156 countries by their happiness levels, reflecting growing global interest in using happiness and substantial well-being as an indicator of the quality of human development. Its growing purpose has allowed governments, communities and organizations to use appropriate data to record happiness in order to enable policies to provide better lives. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldhappiness.report/|title=World Happiness Report|date=2016|website=Overview|publisher=Helliwell, J., Layard, R., & Sachs, J. (2016). World Happiness Report 2016, Update (Vol. I). New York: Sustainable Development Solutions Network|access-date=12 May 2016}}</ref> Also developed by the [[United Nations]] and published recently along with the HDI, this report combines both objective and subjective measures to rank countries by happiness, which is deemed as the ultimate outcome of a high quality of life. It uses surveys from [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]], real GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, perceived freedom to make life choices, freedom from corruption, and generosity to derive the final score. Happiness is already recognised as an important concept in global public policy. The World Happiness Report indicates that some regions have in recent years been experiencing progressive inequality of happiness.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=26 March 2016|title=Health and Happiness|journal=The Lancet|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30062-9|pmid=27025416|volume=387|issue=10025|pages=1251|last1=The Lancet}}</ref>

===Other measures===
The [[Physical Quality of Life Index]] (PQLI) is a measure developed by sociologist Morris David Morris in the 1970s, based on basic literacy, infant mortality, and life expectancy.  Although not as complex as other measures, and now essentially replaced by the Human Development Index, the PQLI is notable for Morris's attempt to show a "less fatalistic pessimistic picture" by focusing on three areas where global quality of life was generally improving at the time and ignoring [[gross national product]] and other possible indicators that were not improving.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Morris | first = Morris David | title = The Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) | journal = Development Digest | volume = 1 | pages = 95–109 | date = January 1980  | pmid = 12261723 }}</ref>

The [[Happy Planet Index]], introduced in 2006, is unique among quality of life measures in that, in addition to standard determinants of well-being, it uses each country's [[ecological footprint]] as an indicator.  As a result, European and North American nations do not dominate this measure.  The 2012 list is instead topped by [[Costa Rica]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Colombia]].<ref>{{cite web | title = The Happy Planet Index 2.0 | publisher = New Economics Foundation | date = 2012 | url = http://www.happyplanetindex.org/  | accessdate = 2 September 2012}}</ref>

A 2010 study by two [[Princeton University]] professors looked at 1,000 randomly selected U.S. residents over an extended period. It concludes that their ''life evaluations'' – that is, their considered evaluations of their life against a stated scale of one to ten – rise steadily with income. On the other hand, their reported quality of ''emotional daily experiences'' (their reported experiences of [[joy]], [[affection]], [[Stress (biology)|stress]], [[sadness]], or [[anger]]) levels off after a certain income level (approximately $75,000 per year); income above $75,000 does not lead to more experiences of happiness nor to further relief of unhappiness or stress. Below this income level, respondents reported decreasing happiness and increasing sadness and stress, implying the pain of life's misfortunes, including [[disease]], [[divorce]], and [[solitude|being alone]], is exacerbated by [[poverty]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Higher income improves life rating but not emotional well-being|url=http://www.physorg.com/news203060471.html|publisher=PhysOrg.com|accessdate=20 September 2010|date=7 September 2010}}</ref>

The [[Social Progress Index]] measures the extent to which countries provide for the social and environmental needs of their citizens. Fifty-two indicators in the areas of basic human needs, foundations of wellbeing, and opportunity show the relative performance of nations. The index uses outcome measures when there is sufficient data available or the closest possible proxies.

Day-Reconstruction Method was another way of measuring happiness, in which researchers asked their subjects to recall various things they did on the previous day and describe their mood during each activity. Being simple and approachable, this method required memory and the experiments have confirmed that the answers that people give are similar to those who repeatedly recalled each subject. The method eventually declined as it called for more effort and thoughtful responses, which often included interpretations and outcomes that do not occur to people who are asked to record every action in their daily lives.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Happiness : What Government Can Learn from the New Research on Well-Being|last=Derek|first=Boc|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=February 2010|isbn=9781400832194|location=United States|pages=32}}</ref>

===Livability===
The term ''quality of life'' is also used by politicians and economists to measure the livability of a given city or nation.  Two widely known measures of livability are the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Where-to-be-born Index]] and [[world's most livable cities|Mercer's Quality of Living Reports]].  These two measures calculate the livability of countries and cities around the world, respectively, through a combination of [[Subjectivity|subjective]] life-satisfaction surveys and objective determinants of quality of life such as divorce rates, safety, and infrastructure. Such measures relate more broadly to the population of a city, state, or country, not to individual quality of life. Livability has a long history and tradition in [[urban design]], and neighborhoods design standards such as [[LEED-ND]] are often used in an attempt to influence livability.

====Crimes====
Some crimes against property (e.g., graffiti and [[vandalism]]) and some "[[victimless crimes]]" have been referred to as "quality-of-life crimes." American [[sociologist]] [[James Q. Wilson]] encapsulated this argument as the [[broken windows theory]], which asserts that relatively minor problems left unattended (such as litter, [[graffiti]], or public urination by [[homeless]] individuals) send a [[subliminal message]] that disorder in general is being tolerated, and as a result, more serious crimes will end up being committed (the analogy being that a broken window left broken shows an image of general dilapidation).

Wilson's theories have been used to justify the implementation of [[zero tolerance]] policies by many prominent American [[mayor]]s, most notably [[Oscar Goodman]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Richard Riordan]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Rudolph Giuliani]] in [[New York City]] and [[Gavin Newsom]] in [[San Francisco]]. Such policies refuse to tolerate even minor crimes; proponents argue that this will improve the quality of life of local residents. However, critics of zero tolerance policies believe that such policies neglect investigation on a case-by-case basis and may lead to unreasonably harsh penalties for crimes.

==In healthcare==
{{main | Quality of life (healthcare)}}
Within the field of healthcare, quality of life is often regarded in terms of how a certain ailment affects a patient on an individual level.  This may be a debilitating weakness that is not life-threatening; life-threatening illness that is not terminal; terminal illness; the predictable, natural decline in the health of an elder; an unforeseen mental/physical decline of a loved one; or chronic, end-stage disease processes. Researchers at the University of Toronto's Quality of Life Research Unit define quality of life as "The degree to which a person enjoys the important possibilities of his or her life" (UofT).  Their Quality of Life Model is based on the categories "being", "belonging", and "becoming"; respectively who one is, how one is not connected to one's environment, and whether one achieves one's personal goals, hopes, and aspirations.<ref>{{cite web | title = Quality of Life: How Good is Life for You? | publisher = University of Toronto Quality of Life Research Unit | url = https://www.utoronto.ca/qol/   | accessdate = 14 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualityoflifecare.com/|title=Begin Your Journey!|website=Quality of Life Care}}</ref>

Experience sampling studies show substantial between-person variability in within-person associations between somatic symptoms and quality of life.<ref name= "Kr2016">{{cite journal |author= van der Krieke|display-authors=etal|title = Temporal Dynamics of Health and Well-Being: A Crowdsourcing Approach to Momentary Assessments and Automated Generation of Personalized Feedback (2016) | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine |volume=79|issue=2| doi= 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000378 |pmid=27551988 |year=2016 |pages=213–223}}</ref> Hecht and Shiel measure quality of life as “the patient’s ability to enjoy normal life activities” since life quality is strongly related to wellbeing without suffering from sickness and treatment.<ref name="Macmillan Reference"/> There are multiple assessments available that measure Health-Related Quality of Life, e.g., [http://www.aqol.com.au AQoL-8D], [https://euroqol.org/ EQ5D - Euroqol], [http://www.15d-instrument.net/15d/ 15D], [https://www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-short-form.html SF-36], [https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/sections/heds/mvh/sf-6d SF-6D], [http://www.healthutilities.com/hui3.htm HUI].

==In international development==
{{POV section|date=November 2012}}
Quality of life is an important concept in the field of [[international development]] since it allows development to be analyzed on a measure broader than standard of living. Within [[development theory]], however, there are varying ideas concerning what constitutes desirable change for a particular society, and the different ways that quality of life is defined by institutions, therefore, shapes how these organizations work for its improvement as a whole.

Organisations such as the [[World Bank]], for example, declare a goal of "working for a world free of poverty",<ref>{{cite web | title = The World Bank | publisher = The World Bank | date = 2009 | url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTABOUTUS/Resources/wbgroupbrochure-en.pdf | accessdate = 2 November 2010}}</ref> with poverty defined as a lack of basic human needs, such as food, water, shelter, freedom, access to education, healthcare, or employment.<ref>{{cite web | title = Poverty - Overview | publisher = The World Bank | date = 2009 | url = http://go.worldbank.org/RQBDCTUXW0 | accessdate = 20 October 2009}}</ref>  In other words, poverty is defined as a low quality of life. Using this definition, the World Bank works towards improving quality of life through the stated goal of lowering poverty and helping people afford a better quality of life.

Other organizations, however, may also work towards improved global quality of life using a slightly different definition and substantially different methods. Many [[NGO]]s do not focus at all on reducing poverty on a national or international scale, but rather attempt to improve quality of life for individuals or communities. One example would be sponsorship programs that provide material aid for specific individuals. Although many organizations of this type may still talk about fighting poverty, the methods are significantly different.

Improving quality of life involves action not only by NGOs but also by [[government]]s. Global health has the potential to achieve greater political presence if governments were to incorporate aspects of human security into [[foreign policy]]. Stressing individuals’ basic rights to health, food, shelter, and freedom addresses prominent inter-sectoral problems negatively impacting today's society and may lead to greater action and resources. Integration of global health concerns into foreign policy may be hampered by approaches that are shaped by the overarching roles of defense and diplomacy.<ref>Spiegel and Huish.
