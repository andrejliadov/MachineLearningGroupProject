The '''Academy of Gondishapur''' ({{lang-fa|فرهنگستان گندی‌شاپور}}, Farhangestân-e Gondišâpur), also known as the '''Gondishapur University''' (دانشگاه گندی‌شاپور Dânešgâh-e Jondišapur), was one of the three Sasanian centers of education ([[Ctesiphon]], [[Resaina]], [[Gundeshapur]])<ref>Spangler, decline of the west, pp200</ref> and [[Ancient center of higher learning|academy of learning]] in the city of [[Gundeshapur]], [[Iran]] during [[late antiquity]], the intellectual center of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. It offered education and training in [[medicine]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]] and [[science]]. The faculty were versed in [[Persian culture|Persian tradition]]s. According to ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', it was the most important medical center of the ancient world during the 6th and 7th centuries.<ref>Vol 4, p396. {{ISBN|0-521-20093-8}}</ref>

Under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], the heritage of Gondeshapur was memorialized by the founding of the ''Jondishapur University'' and its twin institution ''Jondishapur University of Medical Sciences'', near the city of [[Ahvaz]] in 1955. After the [[1979 revolution]] Jondishapur University was renamed to [[Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz]] in 1981 in honor of [[Mostafa Chamran]]. It has been renamed again as [[Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences]] recently.

==History==
In {{sm|a.d.}} 489, the [[Church of the East|Nestorian]] Christian theological and scientific center in [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] was ordered closed by the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], and was transferred and absorbed into the [[School of Nisibis]] in [[Asia Minor]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ut.ac.ir/en/main-links/historical.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203013254/http://www.ut.ac.ir/en/main-links/historical.htm|url-status=dead|title=University of Tehran Overview/Historical Events|archivedate=February 3, 2011}}</ref> also known as ''[[School of Nisibis|Nisibīn]]'', then under [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] rule. Here, Nestorian scholars, together with [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophers]] banished from [[Athens]] by [[Justinian]] in 529, carried out important research in medicine, astronomy, and mathematics.<ref>Hill, Donald. ''Islamic Science and Engineering''. 1993. Edinburgh Univ. Press. {{ISBN|0-7486-0455-3}}, p.4</ref>

However, it was under the rule of the Sassanid emperor [[Khosrau I]] ({{sm|a.d.}} 531-579), known to the Greeks and Romans as ''Chosroes'', that Gondeshapur became known for medicine and learning. [[Khosrau I]] gave refuge to various Greek [[philosopher]]s and [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-speaking Nestorian Christians fleeing religious persecution by the [[Byzantine empire]]. The Sassanids [[Roman–Persian Wars|had long battled]] the Romans and Byzantines for control of present-day [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]] and were naturally disposed to welcome the refugees.

Emperor Khosrau I commissioned the refugees to translate Greek and Syriac texts into [[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]]. They translated various works on medicine, astronomy, philosophy, and useful crafts.

Khosrau I also turned towards the east, and sent the physician [[Burzoe|Borzouye]] to invite Indian and Chinese scholars to Gondeshapur. These visitors translated Indian texts on astronomy, astrology, mathematics and medicine and Chinese texts on herbal medicine and religion. Borzouye is said to have himself translated the ''[[Panchatantra|Pañcatantra]]'' from Sanskrit into Persian as ''Kalila u Dimana.''

A [[Church of the East]] monastery was established in the city of Gondishapur sometime before 376/7. By the 6th century the city became famed for its theological school where [[Rabban Hormizd]] once studied.
According to a letter from the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Catholicos of the East]] [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]], the [[Beth Huzaye (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Metropolitanate of Beth Huzaye]] took charge of both the theological and medical institutions.<ref name=Winkler64>{{Harvnb|Winkler|Baum|2010|p=64}}</ref>

Although almost all the physicians of the medical academy were [[Persian people|Persians]], yet they wrote their treatises in [[Classical Syriac|Syriac]], because medicine had a literary tradition in Syriac.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/syriac-language-i|title=SYRIAC LANGUAGE i. IRANIAN LOANWORDS IN SYRIAC – Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}</ref>

== Significance of Gondeshapur ==
{{quote|[T]o a very large extent, the credit for the whole hospital system must be given to Persia.<ref>Elgood, Cyril. ''A medical history of Persia'', Cambridge University Press, 1951, p. 173</ref>|[[Cyril Elgood]]|''A Medical History of Persia''}}

In addition to systemizing medical treatment and knowledge, the scholars of the academy also transformed medical education; rather than apprenticing with just one physician, medical students were required to work in the hospital under the supervision of the whole medical faculty. There is even evidence that graduates had to pass exams in order to practice as accredited Gondeshapur physicians (as recorded in an Arabic text, the ''[[Tārīkh al-ḥukamā]]''). Gondeshapur also had a pivotal role in the history of mathematics.<ref name="GGJ">{{cite book | title=The crest of the peacock : non-European roots of mathematics | publisher=I. B.

== Gondeshapur under Muslim rule ==
In 832 AD, [[Caliph]] [[Al-Ma'mun|al-Ma'mūn]] bolstered the famous [[House of Wisdom]]. There the methods of Gondeshapur were emulated; indeed, the House of Wisdom was staffed with graduates of the older Academy of Gondeshapur. It is believed that the House of Wisdom was disbanded under [[Al-Mutawakkil]], al-Ma'mūn's successor.

However, by that time the intellectual center of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] had definitively shifted to [[Baghdad]], as henceforth there are few references in contemporary literature to universities or hospitals at Gondeshapur. The significance of the center gradually declined. [[Al-Muqaddasi]]'s ''Best Divisions for Knowledge of the Regions'' (c. 1000 AD) described Gondeshapur as falling into ruins.<ref name="Lestrange">{{Lands of the Eastern Caliphate | page=238}}</ref>

The last known head of Gundeshapur's hospital died in 869.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gondesapur|title=GONDĒŠĀPUR|work=Encyclopaedia Iranica|author1= Alireza Shapour Shahbazi|author-link= Alireza Shapour Shahbazi|author2=Lutz Richter-Bernburg}}</ref>

==Modern Gondeshapur==
[[Image:Talat basari.jpg|thumb|right|Soon after the founding of the modern school of Jondishapur, Dr. [[Tal'at Basari]] was appointed vice chancellor of the university, the first woman to reach such a post in any university in Iran.]]
Under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], the heritage of Gondeshapur was memorialized by the founding of the ''Jondishapur University'' and its twin institution ''Jondishapur University of Medical Sciences'', near the city of [[Ahvaz]] in 1955.

The latter-day Jondishapur University of Medical Sciences was founded and named after its Sassanid predecessor, by its founder and first Chancellor, Dr. [[Mohammad Kar]], Father of Cambys Kar and [[Cyrus Kar]], in Ahvaz in 1959.

Jondishapur University was renamed to [[Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz]] in 1981 in honor of [[Mostafa Chamran]].
It has been renamed again as [[Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences]] recently.

The first woman to be appointed as vice-chancellor in a university in Iran, Dr. [[Tal'at Basari]], was appointed at this university in the mid-1960s, and starting 1968, plans for the modern campus were designed by famed architect [[Kamran Diba]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/investor-relations/products|title=artnet AG Products - Investor Relations|website=www.artnet.com}}</ref>

Ancient Gondeshapur is also slated for an archaeological investigation. Experts from the Archaeological Research Center of [[Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization]] and the Oriental Institute of the [[University of Chicago]] plan to start excavations in early 2006.
