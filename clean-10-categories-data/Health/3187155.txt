[[Alcohol (drug)|Alcohol]] (also known as [[ethanol]]) has a number of effects on [[health]]. [[Short-term effects of alcohol consumption]] include [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]] and [[dehydration]]. [[Long-term effects of alcohol consumption]] include changes in the metabolism of the liver and brain and [[alcoholism]]. Alcohol intoxication affects the brain, causing slurred speech, clumsiness, and delayed reflexes. Alcohol stimulates [[insulin]] production, which speeds up [[glucose]] [[metabolism]] and can result in low [[blood sugar]], causing [[irritability]] and possibly death for [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/expert-blog/alcohol-and-diabetes/BGP-20056464|title=Alcohol and diabetes: Drinking safely – Mayo Clinic}}</ref>{{mcn|date=November 2015}} There is an increased risk of developing an alcohol use disorder for teenagers while their brain is still developing.<ref name="Risks of Adolescent Alcohol Use">{{Cite web|date=2018-01-19|title=Risks of Adolescent Alcohol Use|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/adolescent-development/substance-use/alcohol/risks/index.html|access-date=2020-06-03|website=HHS.gov|language=en}}</ref> Adolescents  who drink have a higher probability of injury including death.<ref name="Risks of Adolescent Alcohol Use"/>

The [[median lethal dose]] of alcohol in test animals is a [[blood alcohol content]] of 0.45%. This is about six times the level of ordinary intoxication (0.08%), but [[vomiting]] or unconsciousness may occur much sooner in people who have a low tolerance for alcohol.<ref name="psychopharm">Meyer, Jerold S. and Linda F. Quenzer. Psychopharmacology: Drugs, the Brain, and Behavior. Sinauer Associates, Inc.: Sunderland, Massachusetts. 2005. Page 228.</ref> The high tolerance of chronic heavy drinkers may allow some of them to remain conscious at levels above 0.40%, although serious health hazards are incurred at this level.

Alcohol also limits the production of [[vasopressin]] (ADH) from the [[hypothalamus]] and the secretion of this [[hormone]] from the [[posterior pituitary]] gland. This is what causes severe [[dehydration]] when alcohol is consumed in large amounts. It also causes a high concentration of water in the [[urine]] and vomit and the intense thirst that goes along with a [[hangover]].

[[Stress (psychological)|Stress]], [[hangover]]s, and [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the oral contraceptive pill]] may increase the desire<!--crave?--> for alcohol because these things will lower the level of testosterone and alcohol will acutely elevate it.<ref>[http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/julkaisut/laa/kliin/vk/sarkola/effectof.pdf helsinki.fi – Effect of alcohol on hormones in women] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811172135/http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/julkaisut/laa/kliin/vk/sarkola/effectof.pdf |date=11 August 2017 }}, Helsinki 2001</ref> [[Tobacco]] has the same effect of increasing the craving for alcohol.<ref>[http://research.med.helsinki.fi/esbra2009/ESBRA2009_posters6.pdf helsinki.fi – Clinical studies on dependence and drug effects] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221181921/http://research.med.helsinki.fi/esbra2009/ESBRA2009_posters6.pdf |date=21 February 2013 }}, ESBRA 2009</ref>

==Short-term effects==
{{Main|Short-term effects of alcohol consumption}}
The [[short-term effects of alcohol consumption]] range from a decrease in anxiety and motor skills at lower doses to unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, and central nervous system depression at higher doses. [[Cell membrane]]s are highly permeable to alcohol, so once alcohol is in the bloodstream it can diffuse into nearly every cell in the body.

The [[concentration]] of alcohol in [[blood]] is measured via [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC). The amount and circumstances of consumption play a large part in determining the extent of [[alcohol intoxication|intoxication]]; for example, eating a heavy meal before alcohol consumption causes alcohol to absorb more slowly.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Horowitz M, Maddox A, Bochner M |display-authors=etal |title=Relationships between gastric emptying of solid and caloric liquid meals and alcohol absorption |journal=Am. J. Physiol. |volume=257 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=G291–6298 |date=1989 |pmid=2764113 |doi=10.1152/ajpgi.1989.257.2.G291 }}</ref> [[Dehydration|Hydration]] also plays a role, especially in determining the extent of [[hangover]]s. After [[binge drinking|excessive drinking]], [[unconsciousness]] can occur and extreme levels of consumption can lead to [[alcohol poisoning]] and death (a concentration in the blood stream of 0.40% will [[median lethal dose|kill half of those affected]]<ref name="BAC">{{Cite web |url=http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/wellness/info/alcohol/bac/ |title=Carleton College: Wellness Center: Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) |access-date=29 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914152127/http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/wellness/info/alcohol/bac/ |archive-date=14 September 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>{{mcn|date=November 2015}}). Alcohol may also cause death indirectly, by [[asphyxiation]] from [[vomiting|vomit]].

Alcohol can greatly exacerbate sleep problems. During [[abstinence]], residual disruptions in sleep regularity and sleep patterns{{Clarify|date=March 2010|reason=Sleep maintenance and architecture are meaningless phrases to 99.9% of our readers, who are not doctors.}} are the greatest predictors of [[relapse]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal |vauthors=Feige B, Scaal S, Hornyak M, Gann H, Riemann D |title=Sleep electroencephalographic spectral power after withdrawal from alcohol in alcohol-dependent patients |journal=Alcohol.

According to the World Health Organization's 2018 Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health, there are more than 3 million people who die from the harmful effects of alcohol each year, which amounts to more than 5% of the burden of disease world-wide.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/en/ | title=WHO &#124; Global status report on alcohol and health 2018}}</ref> The US National Institutes of Health similarly estimates that 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) were believed to be due to alcohol each year.<ref name=NIH2015Stats>{{cite web|title=Alcohol Facts and Statistics|url=http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref>

A systematic analysis of data from the [[Global Burden of Disease Study]], which was an [[observational study]], found that long-term consumption of any amount of alcohol is associated with an increased risk of death in all people, and that even moderate consumption appears to be risky.  Similar to prior analyses, it found an apparent benefit for older women in [[Alcohol and cardiovascular disease|reducing the risks of death from ischemic heart disease]] and from diabetes, but unlike prior studies it found those risks cancelled by an apparent increased risk of death from breast cancer and other causes.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Alcohol use and burden for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 |journal=Lancet |volume= 392|issue= 10152|pages= 1015–1035|date=August 2018 |pmid=30146330 |pmc=6148333 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31310-2 |author1=GBD 2016 Alcohol Collaborators }}</ref> A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that moderate ethanol consumption brought no mortality benefit compared with lifetime abstention from ethanol consumption.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Stockwell T, Zhao J, Panwar S, Roemer A, Naimi T, Chikritzhs T |title=Do "Moderate" Drinkers Have Reduced Mortality Risk?

==Alcohol expectations==
Alcohol expectations are [[belief]]s and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] that people have about the effects they will experience when drinking alcoholic beverages. They are just largely beliefs about alcohol's effects on a person's behaviors, abilities, and emotions. Some people believe that if alcohol expectations can be changed, then [[Alcoholism|alcohol abuse]] might be reduced. Men tend to become more aggressive in laboratory studies in which they are drinking only [[tonic water]] but believe that it contains alcohol. They also become less aggressive when they believe they are drinking only tonic water, but are actually drinking tonic water that contains alcohol.<ref name=Grattan>{{cite journal |last1=Grattan |first1=Karen E. |last2=Vogel-Sprott |first2=M. |title=Maintaining Intentional Control of Behavior Under Alcohol |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=192–7 |year=2001 |doi=10.1111/j.1530-0277.2001.tb02198.x |pmid=11236832}}</ref>

The phenomenon of alcohol expectations recognizes that intoxication has real physiological consequences that alter a drinker's perception of space and time, reduce psychomotor skills, and disrupt [[Equilibrioception|equilibrium]].<ref name=MacAndrew/> The manner and degree to which alcohol expectations interact with the physiological short-term effects of alcohol, resulting in specific behaviors, is unclear.

A single study found that if a society believes that intoxication leads to [[Alcohol and sex|sexual behavior]], rowdy behavior, or aggression, then people tend to act that way when intoxicated. But if a society believes that intoxication leads to relaxation and tranquil behavior, then it usually leads to those outcomes. Alcohol expectations vary within a society, so these outcomes are not certain.<ref name="The think-drink effect">{{cite journal | last1 = Marlatt | first1 = G. A. | last2 = Rosenow | name-list-style=vanc | year = 1981 | title = The think-drink effect | journal = Psychology Today | volume = 15 | pages = 60–93 }}</ref>

People tend to conform to social expectations, and some societies expect that drinking alcohol will cause disinhibition. However, in societies in which the people do not expect that alcohol will disinhibit, intoxication seldom leads to disinhibition and bad behavior.<ref name=MacAndrew>MacAndrew, C. and Edgerton. ''Drunken Comportment: A Social Explanation''. Chicago: Aldine, 1969.</ref>

Alcohol expectations can operate in the absence of actual consumption of alcohol. Research in the United States over a period of decades has shown that men tend to become more sexually aroused when they think they have been drinking alcohol—even when they have not been drinking it.

Binge drinking is becoming a major problem in the UK.

Since 1995 the UK government has advised that regular consumption of three to four units (one unit equates to 10 mL of pure ethanol) a day for men and or two to three units for women, would not pose significant health risks. However, consistently drinking more than four units a day (for men) and three units (women), is not advisable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthimprovement/Alcoholmisuse/index.htm |title=Alcohol misuse : Department of Health |publisher=Dh.gov.uk |accessdate=5 February 2013}}</ref>

Previously (from 1992 until 1995), the advice was that men should drink no more than 21 units per week, and women no more than 14.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/alcohol-facts/health-effects-of-alcohol/lifestyle/alcohol-and-your-health/ |title=Alcohol and health: how alcohol can affect your long and short term health |publisher=Drinkaware.co.uk |accessdate=5 February 2013}}</ref> (The difference between the sexes was due to the typically lower weight and water-to-body-mass ratio of women.) This was changed because a government study showed that many people were in effect "saving up" their units and using them at the end of the week, a phenomenon referred to as [[binge drinking]].{{Citation needed|date= October 2007}} ''[[The Times]]'' reported in October 2007 that these limits had been "plucked out of the air" and had no scientific basis.<ref>[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/food/article1778774.ece Drink limits 'useless’], The Times, 20 October 2007</ref>

===Sobriety===
{{see also|Sobriety}}

[[File:Breathalyzer test 0013.png|right|thumb|A [[midshipman]] is subjected to a random [[breathalyzer]] test to determine sobriety.]]
Sobriety is the condition of not having any measurable levels, or effects from [[mood-altering drug]]s. According to WHO "Lexicon of alcohol and drug terms..." sobriety is continued abstinence from psychoactive drug use.<ref>{{cite web
 |url=https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/terminology/who_lexicon/en/ |title=Lexicon and drug terms |publisher=Who.int |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2013 }}</ref> Sobriety is also considered to be the natural state of a human being given at a birth. In a treatment setting, sobriety is the achieved goal of independence from consuming or craving mind-altering substances. As such, sustained abstinence is a prerequisite for sobriety. Early in abstinence, residual effects of mind-altering substances can preclude sobriety. These effects are labeled "PAWS", or "post acute withdrawal syndrome". Someone who abstains, but has a latent desire to resume use, is not considered truly sober. An abstainer may be subconsciously motivated to resume drug use, but for a variety of reasons, abstains (e.g. such as a medical or legal concern precluding use).<ref name=basharin>{{cite web

== Injury and deaths ==
[[Injury]] is defined as physical damage or harm that is done or sustained. The potential of injuring oneself or others can be increased after consuming alcohol due to the certain short term effects related to the substance such as lack of coordination, blurred vision, and slower reflexes to name a few.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.drinkwise.org.au/drinking-and-you/how-is-drinking-affecting-you/|title = Drinkwise Australia|website = DrinkWise Australia}}</ref> Due to these effects the most common injuries include head, fall, and vehicle-related injuries. A study was conducted of patients admitted to the [[Ulster Hospital]] in Northern Ireland with fall related injuries.

===Alcohol flush and respiratory reactions===
{{see also|Alcohol flush reaction|Alcohol-induced respiratory reactions|Short-term effects of alcohol consumption}}
Alcohol flush reaction is a condition in which an individual's face or body experiences flushes or blotches as a result of an accumulation of [[acetaldehyde]], a metabolic byproduct of the catabolic metabolism of alcohol. It is best known as a condition that is experienced by people of Asian descent. According to the analysis by [[HapMap Project]], the rs671 allele of the ALDH2 gene responsible for the flush reaction is rare among Europeans and Africans, and it is very rare among Mexican-Americans. 30% to 50% of people of Chinese and Japanese ancestry have at least one ALDH*2 allele.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs671 |title=Rs671 |website=SNPmedia }}</ref> The rs671 form of ALDH2, which accounts for most incidents of alcohol flush reaction worldwide, is native to East Asia and most common in southeastern China.

=== Genetics and amount of consumption ===
Having a particular genetic variant (A-allele of ADH1B rs1229984) is associated with non-drinking and lower alcohol consumption.

==Gender differences==

===Alcoholism===
Based on combined data from SAMHSA's 2004-2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, the rate of past year [[alcohol dependence]] or abuse among people aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% of those who did not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).<ref>"Gender differences in alcohol use and alcohol dependence or abuse: 2004 or 2005." The NSDUH Report. Accessed 22 June 2012.</ref>
Over time the difference between males and females has narrowed. According to a 2016 systematic review, for those born at the end of the 20th century men were 1.2 times as likely to drink to problematic levels, and 1.3 times as likely to develop health problems from drinking.<ref name=Slade2016 />

===Sensitivity===
Several biological factors make women more vulnerable to the effects of alcohol than men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helpguide.org/harvard/women_alcohol.htm |title=Women & Alcohol: The Hidden Risks of Drinking |publisher=Helpguide.org |accessdate=5 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103092219/http://www.helpguide.org/harvard/women_alcohol.htm |archive-date=3 January 2013 }}</ref>

* Body fat. Women tend to weigh less than men, and—pound for pound—a woman's body contains less water and more fatty tissue than a man's. Because fat retains alcohol while water dilutes it, alcohol remains at higher concentrations for longer periods of time in a woman's body, exposing her brain and other organs to more alcohol.
* Enzymes. Women have lower levels of two enzymes—alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase—that metabolize (break down) alcohol in the stomach and liver. As a result, women absorb more alcohol into their bloodstreams than men.
* Hormones. Changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle may also affect how a woman metabolizes alcohol.

===Metabolism===
Females demonstrated a higher average rate of elimination (mean, 0.017; range, 0.014–0.021 g/210 L) than males (mean, 0.015; range, 0.013–0.017 g/210 L). Female subjects on average had a higher percentage of body fat (mean, 26.0; range, 16.7–36.8%) than males (mean, 18.0; range, 10.2–25.3%).<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 8872236 | volume=20 | issue=5 | title=Determination of volume of distribution for ethanol in male and female subjects. | date=Sep 1996 | pages=287–90 | journal=J Anal Toxicol | doi=10.1093/jat/20.5.287 | last1 = Cowan | first1 = JM Jr | last2 = Weathermon | first2 = A | last3 = McCutcheon | first3 = JR | last4 = Oliver | first4 = RD}}</ref>

===Depression===
The link between alcohol consumption, depression, and gender was examined by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Canada). The study found that women taking antidepressants consumed more alcohol than women who did not experience depression as well as men taking antidepressants. The researchers, Dr. Kathryn Graham and a PhD Student Agnes Massak analyzed the responses to a survey by 14,063 Canadian residents aged 18–76 years. The survey included measures of quantity, frequency of drinking, depression and antidepressants use, over the period of a year. The researchers used data from the GENACIS Canada survey, part of an international collaboration to investigate the influence of cultural variation on gender differences in alcohol use and related problems. The purpose of the study was to examine whether, like in other studies already conducted on male depression and alcohol consumption, depressed women also consumed less alcohol when taking anti-depressants. According to the study, both men and women experiencing depression (but not on anti-depressants) drank more than non-depressed counterparts. Men taking antidepressants consumed significantly less alcohol than depressed men who did not use antidepressants. Non-depressed men consumed 436 drinks per year, compared to 579 drinks for depressed men not using antidepressants, and 414 drinks for depressed men who used antidepressants. Alcohol consumption remained higher whether the depressed women were taking anti-depressants or not. 179 drinks per year for non-depressed women, 235 drinks for depressed women not using antidepressants, and 264 drinks for depressed women who used antidepressants. The lead researcher argued that the study "suggests that the use of antidepressants is associated with lower alcohol consumption among men suffering from depression. But this does not appear to be true for women."<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.060446 | pmid=17325328 | pmc=1800314 | volume=176 | title=Alcohol consumption and the use of antidepressants | journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal | pages=633–637  | last1 = Graham | first1 = K. | last2 = Massak | first2 = A.| issue=5 | year=2007 }}</ref>
