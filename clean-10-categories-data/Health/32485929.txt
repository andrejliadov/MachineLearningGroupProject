Major medical and psychiatric expert groups have consistently found that abortion does not cause mental-health problems. In 2008, the [[American Psychological Association]] reviewed the literature on abortion and mental health and concluded that the risk of mental health problems following a single, first-trimester [[abortion|induced abortion]] of an adult women is no greater than carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term. While observing that abortion may both relieve stress and "engender additional stress," they explicitly rejected the idea that abortion is "inherently traumatic."<ref name=APA2008/> Among those women who do experience mental health issues following an abortion, the APA concluded that these issues are most likely related to pre-existing risk factors.<ref name=APA2008/>  Since these and other risk factors may also predispose some women to more negative reactions following a birth, the higher rates of mental illness observed among women with a prior history of abortion are more likely to be caused by these other factors than by abortion itself.<ref name=APA2008/> The panel noted severe inconsistency between the outcomes reported by studies on the effect of multiple abortions.

Under the [[Abortion Act 1967|1967 Abortion Act]], abortion in the [[Abortion in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] was legalized only when two doctors agreed that carrying the pregnancy to term would be detrimental to a woman's physical or mental health.  Consideration of mental health also played a role in the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' which ruled that state governments may not prohibit [[Late termination of pregnancy|late terminations of pregnancy]] when "necessary to preserve the [woman's] life or health".<ref name=Roe_V_Wade>{{cite journal|last1=US Supreme Court|title=Roe V.

Subsequently, a Congressional committee charged that Koop refused to publish the results of his review because he failed to find evidence that abortion was harmful, and that Koop watered down his findings in his letter to Reagan by claiming that the studies were inconclusive. Congressman [[Theodore S. Weiss]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[New York (state)|NY]]), who oversaw the investigation, argued that when Koop found no evidence that abortion was harmful, he "decided not to issue a report, but instead to write a letter to the president which would be sufficiently vague as to avoid supporting the pro-choice position that abortion is safe for women."<ref name="newscientist"/>

Later in 1989, responding to the political debate over the question, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) undertook a review of the scientific literature. Their review, published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', concluding that "the weight of the evidence from scientific studies indicates that legal abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in the first trimester does not pose a psychological hazard for most women." The APA task force also concluded that "severe negative reactions after abortions are rare and can best be understood in the framework of coping with normal life stress."<ref name="APA89" /><ref name=":0">{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/06/us/study-finds-little-lasting-distress-from-abortion.html | title= Study Finds Little Lasting Distress From Abortion | work=[[The New York Times]] | date = 1990-04-06| accessdate = 2008-11-18| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081205231237/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEEDE133FF935A35757C0A966958260| archive-date= 5 December 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In 1994, the U.K.'s House of Lord's Commission of Inquiry into the Operation and Consequences of The Abortion Act published a report (commonly referred to as the Rawlinson Report) which concluded that there was no scientific evidence that abortion provided any mental health benefits but instead may put women at risk for psychiatric illness greater than if woman carried to term.<ref name="auto">{{Cite book|title=The Physical and Psycho-Social Effects of Abortoin on Women|last=Great Britain Commission of Inquiry into the Operation and Consequences of The Abortion Act|publisher=HSMO|year=1994|location=London}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=How claims spread : cross-national diffusion of social problems|date=2001|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|others=Best, Joel.|isbn=978-0202306537|location=New York|pages=59–61|oclc=45023173}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Scientific Developments Relating to the Abortion Act 1967.

In a press release, the Rawlinson commission stated that the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) had provided written testimony stating that there are "no psychiatric indications for abortion," noting that this "raises serious questions given that 91% of abortion are carried out on the grounds of the mental health of the mother."<ref name=":2" />  In response, the RCP issued a statement that the Rawlinson commissions summary of their written statement was "an inaccurate portrayal of the College's views on abortion," adding that "There is no evidence of increase risk of major psychiatric disorder or of long lasting psychological distress [following abortion].<ref name=":2" />

In 2006, the U.K.'s House of Commons Science and Technology Committee undertook another inquiry into scientific developments and included a request for the RCP to update their 1994 statement on abortion in light of more recent studies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Scientific Developments Relating to the Abortion Act 1967.
