{{short description|Medical branch dealing with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer in adolescent and young adults}}
'''Adolescent and young adult oncology''' is a branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer in [[Adolescence|adolescent]] and [[Youth|young adult]] (AYA) patients aged 13–30. Studies have continuously shown that while pediatric cancer survival rates have gone up, the survival rate for adolescents and young adults has remained stagnant. While many clinical trials exist for adults with cancer and children with cancer, AYAs underutilize [[clinical trial]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Tai|first1=Eric|last2=Buchanan|first2=Natasha|last3=Eliman|first3=Dena|last4=Westervelt|first4=Lauren|last5=Beaupin|first5=Lynda|last6=Lawvere|first6=Silvana|last7=Bleyer|first7=Archie|date=June 2014|title=Understanding and Addressing the Lack of Clinical Trial Enrollment Among Adolescents With Cancer|journal=Pediatrics|volume=133|issue=Suppl 3|pages=S98–S103|doi=10.1542/peds.2014-0122D|issn=0031-4005|pmc=6074033|pmid=24918214}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bleyer|first1=Archie|last2=Tai|first2=Eric|last3=Siegel|first3=Stuart|date=August 2018|title=Role of clinical trials in survival progress of American adolescents and young adults with cancer—and lack thereof|journal=Pediatric Blood & Cancer|volume=65|issue=8|pages=e27074|doi=10.1002/pbc.27074|issn=1545-5009|pmc=6077840|pmid=29667766}}</ref> Most pediatric clinical trials serve patients up to age 21.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Chisholm|first1=Julia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWBODwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=aya+environments#v=onepage|title=A Practical Approach to the Care of Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer|last2=Hough|first2=Rachael|last3=Soanes|first3=Louise|date=2018-02-27|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-66173-5|language=en|access-date=2020-06-02|archive-date=2020-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200709225337/https://books.google.com/books?id=kWBODwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=aya+environments#v=onepage|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, AYAs face problems that adults and children rarely see including college concerns, [[fertility]], and sense of aloneness.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Forum|first1=National Cancer Policy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179872/|title=PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS OF AYA CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT|last2=Services|first2=Board on Health Care|last3=Workshop|first3=A.

In countries like the US and the UK, specialized AYA units have started to be built in children's and adult hospitals to cater to the need of these age groups. AYA wards are designed to be bright and welcoming with many games and televisions to keep patients busy.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-19|title=How A Space For Young People Can provide Relief During Cancer Treatment|url=https://teencanceramerica.org/community-stories/teen-young-adults/how-a-space-for-young-people-can-provide-relief-during-cancer-treatment/|access-date=2020-06-02|website=Teen Cancer America|language=en-US|archive-date=2020-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926052803/https://teencanceramerica.org/community-stories/teen-young-adults/how-a-space-for-young-people-can-provide-relief-during-cancer-treatment/|url-status=live}}</ref> The need for these spaces come from the findings that AYAs tend to prefer pediatric wards over adult wards, but do not like to be treated like children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sadeghi|first1=Narges|last2=Abdeyazdan|first2=Zahra|last3=Motaghi|first3=Minoo|last4=Rad|first4=Marzieh Ziaei|last5=Torkan|first5=Behnaz|date=2012|title=Satisfaction levels about hospital wards' environment among adolescents hospitalized in adult wards vs. pediatric ones|journal=Iranian Journal of Nursing and Midwifery Research|volume=17|issue=6|pages=430–433|issn=1735-9066|pmc=3733288|pmid=23922584}}</ref>

AYA teams are usually made up of specialists that specialize in both [[Pediatrics|pediatric]] and [[Oncology|adult medicine]] due to the fact that people under 21 tend to do better under pediatric care.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Teens Do Better Here|url=https://www.seattlechildrens.org/about/stories/teens-do-better-here/|access-date=2020-11-25|website=Seattle Children’s Hospital|language=en}}</ref>

== United States ==
Internationally, different countries tend to treat the AYA age group in different environments. Most AYA treatment centers in the US are within larger [[children's hospital]]s. The organization, Teen Cancer America was created to establish more AYA wards in hospitals across the US, and currently there are about 21 hospitals affiliated with Teen Cancer America,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Teen Cancer America – Our Work|url=https://teencanceramerica.org/our-work/|access-date=2020-06-02|website=Teen Cancer America|language=en-US|archive-date=2020-05-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200513101434/https://teencanceramerica.org/our-work/|url-status=live}}</ref> and many more with AYA programs. The [[American Academy of Pediatrics|American Academy of Pediatrics']] opinion is that children should be under the care of a pediatrician until they deem not necessary, and children's hospitals in the US are increasingly treating older patients well into their twenties as a part of AYA and other adult programs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hardin|first1=Amy Peykoff|last2=Hackell|first2=Jesse M.|last3=Medicine|first3=Committee on Practice and Ambulatory|s2cid=31354886|date=2017-09-01|title=Age Limit of Pediatrics|url=https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/140/3/e20172151|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=140|issue=3|pages=e20172151|doi=10.1542/peds.2017-2151|issn=0031-4005|pmid=28827380|doi-access=free|access-date=2020-06-03|archive-date=2020-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200213043903/https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/140/3/e20172151|url-status=live}}</ref>

{{Main|Teenage Cancer Trust}}
The UK is seen to be one of the pioneers of AYA cancer care at its hospitals. Teenage Cancer Trust is a cancer care and support charity in the UK that exists to improve the cancer experience of young people aged 13–24.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Bleyer|first1=Archie W.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXgDooG8SEsC&pg=PA509&lpg=PA509&dq=age+21+mexico+pediatrics#v=onepage|title=Cancer in Adolescents and Young Adults|last2=Barr|first2=Ronald Duncan|date=2007-09-23|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-68152-6|language=en|access-date=2020-06-06|archive-date=2020-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804173854/https://books.google.com/books?id=pXgDooG8SEsC&pg=PA509&lpg=PA509&dq=age+21+mexico+pediatrics#v=onepage|url-status=live}}</ref> Founded in 1990, the charity's key service is providing specialist teenage units in [[National Health Service|NHS hospitals]].
