'''Aplu''' was a [[Hurrian]] deity of the plague — bringing it, or, if propitiated, protecting from it — and resembles  [[Apollo Smintheus]], "mouse-Apollo".<ref>"smintheus" (Perseus.tufts) [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=sminqeus&la#lexicon σμινθεύς]</ref><ref>Homer. ''Iliad'', i. 37-39.</ref> Aplu, it is suggested, comes from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''Aplu Enlil'', meaning "the son of [[Enlil]]", a title that was given to the god [[Nergal]], who was linked to [[Shamash]], Babylonian god of the sun.<ref>De Grummond, Nancy Thomson (2006) ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend''.
