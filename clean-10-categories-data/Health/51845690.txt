'''Alcohol intolerance'''  is due to a [[Gene polymorphism|genetic polymorphism]] of the [[enzyme]] [[alcohol dehydrogenase]], the enzyme that metabolises ingested alcohol.  This polymorphism is most often reported in Asian patients.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/12634/acute-alcohol-sensitivity|title=Acute alcohol sensitivity {{!}} Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref>  It can also be an effect or [[side effect]] associated with certain drugs such as [[disulfiram]], [[metronidazole]], or [[nilutamide]]. Stuffy nose and skin flushing are the most common symptoms when ingesting [[drinking alcohol|alcohol]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/12634/acute-alcohol-sensitivity|title=Acute alcohol sensitivity {{!}} Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref>  It may also be characterized as [[drug intolerance|intolerance]] causing [[Hangover#Acetaldehyde|hangover]] symptoms similar to the "disulfiram-like reaction" of [[Aldehyde dehydrogenase#Pathology (aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency)|aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency]] or [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]. Severe pain after drinking alcohol may indicate a more serious condition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-intolerance/symptoms-causes/syc-20369211|title=Alcohol intolerance - Symptoms and causes|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>   

If people are intolerant, some nearly [[non-alcoholic beverage]]s may be a problem, similar to alcohol-containing medications, [[vinegar]], [[Alcohol inhalation|inhalation of alcohol]] or the vapour of alcohol-containing [[cleaning agent]]s.

Drinking alcohol first or afterwards together with [[calcium cyanamide]], an inorganic compound used as a fertilizer, can cause permanent or long lasting intolerance (nitrolime disease),<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/environmental_risks/docs/scher_o_169.pdf ''Potential risks to human health and the environment from the  use of calcium cyanamide as fertiliser''], page 29, [[Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks]], Retrieved 14 November 2016</ref> contributing  together with other substances to the accumulation of harmful [[acetaldehyde]] by inhibiting the enzyme [[Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase#Role in metabolism of alcohol|acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]].
