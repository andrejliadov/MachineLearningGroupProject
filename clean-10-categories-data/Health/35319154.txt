'''Occupational safety and health''' ('''OSH'''), also commonly referred to as '''occupational health and safety''' ('''OHS'''), '''occupational health''',<ref>It can be confusing that British English also uses ''[[industrial medicine]]'' to refer to occupational health and safety and uses ''occupational health'' to refer to [[occupational medicine]]. See the Collins Dictionary entries for [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/industrial-medicine ''industrial medicine''] and [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/occupational-medicine ''occupational medicine''] and [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/occupational-health ''occupational health''].</ref> or '''occupational safety''', is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the [[safety]], [[health]], and [[quality of life|welfare]] of people at [[Work (human activity)|occupation]]. These terms also refer to the goals of this field,<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/occupational+health Mosby's Medical Dictionary]</ref> so their use in the sense of this article was originally an abbreviation of ''occupational safety and health program/department'' etc.

The goal of an occupational safety and health program is to foster a safe and healthy occupational environment.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Oak Ridge National Laboratory {{!}} ORNL|url = http://www.ornl.gov|website = www.ornl.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}</ref> OSH also protects all the general public who may be affected by the occupational environment.<ref name= Fanning>Fanning, Fred E.

In common-law jurisdictions, employers have a [[common law]] duty to take reasonable care of the safety of their employees.<ref name=WAgdoc>{{cite web|title=Guidance note: General duty of care in Western Australian workplaces 2005|url=http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/atoms/files/general_duty_of_care.pdf|publisher=Government of Western Australia|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> [[Statute law]] may, in addition, impose other general duties, introduce specific duties, and create government bodies with powers to regulate occupational safety issues: details of this vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

==Definition==
As defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) "occupational health deals with all aspects of health and safety in the workplace and has a strong focus on primary prevention of hazards."<ref>{{Cite web|title = WPRO {{!}} Occupational health|url = http://www.wpro.who.int/topics/occupational_health/en/|website = www.wpro.who.int|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}</ref> [[Health]] has been defined as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."<ref>{{Cite web|url =https://www.who.int/about/definition/en/print.html|title = WHO Definition of Health|website = World Health Organization|publisher = World Health Organization|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160707120526/http://www.who.int/about/definition/en/print.html|archive-date = 2016-07-07}}</ref> Occupational health is a multidisciplinary field of [[healthcare]] concerned with enabling an individual to undertake their [[Job|occupation]], in the way that causes least harm to their health. It aligns with the promotion of health and safety at work, which is concerned with preventing harm from hazards in the workplace.

Since 1950, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) have shared a common definition of occupational health. It was adopted by the Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health at its first session in 1950 and revised at its twelfth session in 1995. The definition reads:

{{quote|"The main focus in occupational health is on three different objectives: (i) the maintenance and promotion of workers’ health and working capacity; (ii) the improvement of working environment and work to become conducive to safety and health and (iii) development of work organizations and working cultures in a direction which supports health and safety at work and in doing so also promotes a positive social climate and smooth operation and may enhance productivity of the undertakings. The concept of working culture is intended in this context to mean a reflection of the essential value systems adopted by the undertaking concerned. Such a culture is reflected in practice in the managerial systems, personnel policy, principles for participation, training policies and quality management of the undertaking."|Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/safework_bookshelf/english?content&nd=857170174 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120904021458/http://www.ilo.org/safework_bookshelf/english?content&nd=857170174 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-04 |title=Occupational Health Services And Practice |publisher=Ilo.org |accessdate=2013-02-15 }}</ref>}}

Those in the field of occupational health come from a wide range of [[discipline (academia)|disciplines]] and professions including [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[epidemiology]], [[physiotherapy]] and rehabilitation, [[occupational therapy]], [[occupational medicine]], [[human factors and ergonomics]], and many others. Professionals advise on a broad range of occupational health matters. These include how to avoid particular pre-existing conditions causing a problem in the occupation, correct posture for the work, frequency of rest breaks, preventive action that can be undertaken, and so forth.

"Occupational health should aim at: the promotion and maintenance of the highest degree of physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations; the prevention amongst workers of departures from health caused by their working conditions; the protection of workers in their employment from risks resulting from factors adverse to health; the placing and maintenance of the worker in an occupational environment adapted to his physiological and psychological capabilities; and, to summarize, the adaptation of work to man and of each man to his job.

==History==
[[File:Lewis Wickes Hines - Harry McShane 1908.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Harry McShane, age 16, 1908. Pulled into machinery in a factory in [[Cincinnati]] and had his arm ripped off at the shoulder and his leg broken without any compensation.]]
The research and [[regulation]] of occupational safety and health are a relatively recent phenomenon. As [[labor movements]] arose in response to worker concerns in the wake of the industrial revolution, worker's health entered consideration as a labor-related issue.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Factory Acts]] of the early nineteenth century (from 1802 onwards) arose out of concerns about the poor health of children working in cotton mills: the Act of 1833 created a dedicated professional [[Factory inspector|Factory Inspectorate]].<ref name=Hutchins_Harrison_1911>{{cite book|last1=Hutchins|first1=B L|last2=Harrison|first2=A|title=A history of factory legislation by; Published 1911|date=1911|publisher=P S King & Son|location=Westminster|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/factoryofhistory00hutcrich|accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref> {{rp|41}}  The initial remit of the Inspectorate was to police restrictions on the working hours in the textile industry of children and young persons (introduced to prevent chronic overwork, identified as leading directly to ill-health and deformation, and indirectly to a high accident rate).  However, on the urging of the Factory Inspectorate, a further Act in 1844 giving similar restrictions on working hours for women in the textile industry introduced a requirement for machinery guarding (but only in the textile industry, and only in areas that might be accessed by women or children).<ref name=Hutchins_Harrison_1911/> {{rp|85}}

In 1840 a [[Royal Commission]] published its findings on the state of conditions for the workers of the mining industry that documented the appallingly dangerous environment that they had to work in and the high frequency of accidents. The commission sparked public outrage which resulted in the Mines Act of 1842. The act set up an inspectorate for mines and collieries which resulted in many prosecutions and safety improvements, and by 1850, inspectors were able to enter and inspect premises at their discretion.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = An Account of the Founding of H.M.

[[Otto von Bismarck]] inaugurated the first social insurance legislation in 1883 and the first [[worker's compensation]] law in 1884 – the first of their kind in the Western world. Similar acts followed in other countries, partly in response to labor unrest.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Abrams|first=Herbert K.|title=A Short History of Occupational Health|journal=Journal of Public Health Policy|volume=22|issue=1|pages=34–80|url=http://cavcominc.com/uploads/files/History_OccHealth_Abrams.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2012 |doi=10.2307/3343553 |pmid=11382089 |year=2001|jstor=3343553|s2cid=13398392}}</ref>

{{main|Occupational hazard}}
Although work provides many economic and other benefits, a wide array of workplace hazards (also known as unsafe working conditions) also present risks to the health and safety of people at work. These include but are not limited to, "chemicals, biological agents, physical factors, adverse ergonomic conditions, allergens, a complex network of safety risks," and a broad range of psychosocial risk factors.<ref>Concha-Barrientos, M., Imel, N.D., Driscoll, T., Steenland, N.K., Punnett, L., Fingerhut, M.A., Prüss-Üstün, A., Leigh, J., Tak, S.W., Corvalàn, C.

== By industry ==
Specific occupational safety and health risk factors vary depending on the specific sector and industry. [[Construction]] workers might be particularly at risk of falls, for instance, whereas fishermen might be particularly at risk of [[drowning]]. The United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] identifies the [[commercial fishing|fishing]], [[aviation]], [[lumber]], [[metalworking]], [[agriculture]], [[mining]] and [[transportation]] industries as among some of the more dangerous for workers.<ref name=bls-iif>{{cite web |title=Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities 2010|url=http://www.bls.gov/iif/|work=Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> Similarly psychosocial risks such as [[workplace violence]] are more pronounced for certain occupational groups such as health care employees, police, correctional officers and teachers.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Violence in the Workplace : OSH Answers|url = http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/psychosocial/violence.html|website = www.ccohs.ca|accessdate = 2015-10-30|first = Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|last = Safety|date = 2018-11-29}}</ref>

The 2010 [[National Health Interview Survey#Research topics|National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement]] (NHIS-OHS) identified work organization factors and occupational psychosocial and chemical/physical exposures which may increase some health risks. Among all U.S. workers in the construction sector, 44% had non-standard work arrangements (were not regular permanent employees) compared to 19% of all U.S. workers, 15% had temporary employment compared to 7% of all U.S. workers, and 55% experienced job insecurity compared to 32% of all U.S. workers. Prevalence rates for exposure to physical/chemical hazards were especially high for the construction sector. Among nonsmoking workers, 24% of construction workers were exposed to secondhand smoke while only 10% of all U.S. workers were exposed. Other physical/chemical hazards with high prevalence rates in the construction industry were frequently working outdoors (73%) and frequent exposure to vapors, gas, dust, or fumes (51%).<ref name=nhis_construction>{{cite web | title = CDC – NHIS – Construction Sector Profile Page – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = June 28, 2013|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/construction.html | accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref>

The 2010 NHIS-OHS found elevated prevalence rates of several occupational exposures in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector which may negatively impact health.

===Service sector===
{{see also|Service sector}}
As the number of [[service sector]] jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]], presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with [[manufacturing]] and the [[primary sector]]. Contemporary problems such as the growing rate of [[obesity]] and issues relating to [[occupational stress]], [[workplace bullying]], and [[overwork]] in many countries have further complicated the interaction between work and health.

According to data from the 2010 NHIS-OHS, hazardous physical/chemical exposures in the service sector were lower than national averages. On the other hand, potentially harmful work organization characteristics and psychosocial workplace exposures were relatively common in this sector. Among all workers in the service industry, 30% experienced job insecurity in 2010, 27% worked non-standard shifts (not a regular day shift), 21% had non-standard work arrangements (were not regular permanent employees).<ref name=nhis_service>{{cite web | title = CDC – NHIS – Services Sector Profile Page – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = June 28, 2013 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/service.html | accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref>

According to data from the 2010 NHIS-OHS, workers employed in mining and oil and gas extraction industries had high prevalence rates of exposure to potentially harmful work organization characteristics and hazardous chemicals. Many of these workers worked long hours: 50% worked more than 48 hours a week and 25% worked more than 60 hours a week in 2010. Additionally, 42% worked non-standard shifts (not a regular day shift). These workers also had high prevalence of exposure to physical/chemical hazards. In 2010, 39% had frequent skin contact with chemicals. Among nonsmoking workers, 28% of those in mining and oil and gas extraction industries had frequent exposure to [[passive smoking|secondhand smoke]] at work. About two-thirds were frequently exposed to vapors, gas, dust, or fumes at work.<ref name="nhis_mining">{{cite web | title = CDC – NHIS – Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Sectors Profile Page | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = June 28, 2013 | url =https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/mining.html | accessdate = July 16, 2013}}</ref>

The Occupational Safety and Health Statistics (OSHS) program in the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] of the [[United States Department of Labor]] compiles information about workplace [[occupational fatality|fatalities]] and non-fatal injuries in the [[United States]]. The OSHS program produces three annual reports:

# Counts and rates of nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses by detailed industry and case type (SOII summary data)
# Case circumstances and worker demographic data for nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses resulting in days away from work (SOII case and demographic data)

After the destruction of the USSR, the enterprises became owned by [[Russian oligarch|new owners]] who were not interested in preserving the life and health of workers.

Their findings show that new "methods" do not provide a real picture of working conditions. This is most clearly shown by the results obtained at enterprises producing aluminum. For example, the share of jobs with very harmful working conditions (“labor class” ''(health hazard class)'' = 3.4) decreased by an order of magnitude (from 11.6% to 1.2%).

OHSAS 18000 comprised two parts, OHSAS 18001 and 18002 and was developed by a selection of leading trade bodies, international standards and certification bodies to address a gap where no third-party certifiable international standard existed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} It was intended to integrate with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en/Assessment-and-certification-services/management-systems/Standards-and-Schemes/BSOHSAS-18001/ |title=BS OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety |publisher=BSI Group |accessdate=2013-02-15}}</ref>

Occupational safety and health practice vary among nations with different approaches to legislation, regulation, enforcement, and incentives for compliance. In the EU, for example, some member states promote OSH by providing public monies as subsidies, grants or financing, while others have created tax system incentives for OSH investments. A third group of EU member states has experimented with using workplace accident insurance premium discounts for companies or organisations with strong OSH records.<ref>European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (2004): “Effectiveness of economic incentives to improve occupational safety and health”, Forum # 14, Bilbao, Spain: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, {{ISBN|92-9191-119-4}}, http://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/forum/14/view</ref><ref>Elsler, D.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the Commonwealth, four of the six states and both territories have enacted and administer harmonised Work Health and Safety Legislation in accordance with the ''Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coag.gov.au/node/276|title=Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety {{!}} Council of Australian Governments (COAG)|website=www.coag.gov.au|access-date=2016-04-06}}</ref> Each of these jurisdictions has enacted Work Health & Safety legislation and regulations based on the Commonwealth Work Health and Safety Act 2011 and common Codes of Practice developed by [[Safe Work Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/model-whs-laws/pages/model-whs-laws|title=Model work health and safety laws - Safe Work Australia|website=www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au|access-date=2016-04-06}}</ref> Some jurisdictions have also included mine safety under the model approach, however, most have retained separate legislation for the time being.

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], workers are covered by provincial or federal labour codes depending on the sector in which they work. Workers covered by federal legislation (including those in mining, transportation, and federal employment) are covered by the Canada Labour Code; all other workers are covered by the health and safety legislation of the province in which they work. The [[Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety]] (CCOHS), an agency of the Government of Canada, was created in 1966 by an Act of Parliament. The act was based on the belief that all Canadians had "...a fundamental right to a healthy and safe working environment." CCOHS is mandated to promote safe and healthy workplaces to help prevent work-related injuries and illnesses.  The CCOHS maintains a useful (partial) list of OSH regulations for Canada and its provinces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/legislation/fulllist.html|title=CCOHS: Web Information Service: Canadian enviroOSH Legislation plus Standards|website=www.ccohs.ca|access-date=2016-04-06|date=2009-05-12}}</ref>

In the [[European Union]], [[member state]]s have enforcing authorities to ensure that the basic legal requirements relating to occupational health and safety are met. In many EU countries, there is strong cooperation between employer and worker organisations (e.g. unions) to ensure good OSH performance as it is recognized this has benefits for both the worker (through maintenance of health) and the enterprise (through improved [[productivity]] and [[Quality (business)|quality]]). In 1996, the [[European Agency for Safety and Health at Work]] was founded.

Member states of the [[European Union]] have all transposed into their national legislation a series of directives that establish minimum standards on occupational health and safety. These directives (of which there are about 20 on a variety of topics) follow a similar structure requiring the employer to assess the workplace risks and put in place preventive measures based on a [[Hierarchy of hazard control|hierarchy of control]]. This hierarchy starts with elimination of the hazard and ends with [[personal protective equipment]].

However, certain EU member states admit to having lacking quality control in occupational safety services, to situations in which risk analysis takes place without any on-site workplace visits and to insufficient implementation of certain EU OSH directives. Based on this, it is hardly surprising that the total societal costs of work-related health problems and accidents vary from 2.6% to 3.8% of GNP between the EU member states.<ref>See p. 2-4 of European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (2001): "Quality of Work ‘A future Community strategy for safety and health at work’, FORUM # 1, downloadable from: http://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/forum/1/view.</ref>

====Denmark====
In [[Denmark]], occupational safety and health is regulated by the Danish Act on Working Environment and cooperation at the workplace.<ref>{{Cite web|title = How a good working environment is secured in Denmark|url = http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/Integration/online_danish/working_in_denmark/occupational_safety_and_health_at_the_workplace/how_a_good_working_environment_is_secured_in_denmark.htm|website = www.nyidanmark.dk|accessdate = 2015-10-30|archive-url=https://archive.today/20091219205156/http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/Integration/online_danish/working_in_denmark/occupational_safety_and_health_at_the_workplace/how_a_good_working_environment_is_secured_in_denmark.htm|archive-date=December 19, 2009}}</ref> The Danish Working Environment Authority (''Arbejdstilsynet'') carries out inspections of companies, draws up more detailed rules on health and safety at work and provides information on health and safety at work.<ref>Arbejdstilsynet, [https://at.dk/en/ English web pages of the Danish Working Environment Authority], accessed 11 April 2020</ref> The result of each inspection is made public on the web pages of the Danish Working Environment Authority so that the general public, current and prospective employees, customers and other stakeholders can inform themselves about whether a given organization has passed the inspection.<ref>The inspection results can be found from the main page of the Danish Working Environment Authority at: http://arbejdstilsynet.dk/da/ under the heading "Smiley Status". See also http://arbejdstilsynet.dk/en/engelsk/inspection/smiley-26-6-07.aspx.</ref>

====Netherlands====

In [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] the rules for safety and health at work are registered in the Working Conditions Act. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour ([[Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment|SZW]]) monitors adherence to the rules through their inspection service. This inspection service investigates industrial accidents and the service can suspend work when the Working Conditions Act has been violated and impose fines. Companies can raise their security levels by certifying the company with a [VCA-certificate (Safety, Health and Environment). All employees have to obtain a VCA-certificate too, with which they can prove that they know how to work according to the current and applicable safety and environmental regulations.

====Ireland====
The main health and safety [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|law in Ireland]] is the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005,<ref name=Ire>Citizens Information, [https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment_rights_and_conditions/health_and_safety/health_safety_work.html Health and safety at work], accessed 11 April 2020</ref> which replaced earlier 1989 legislation. The [[Health and Safety Authority]], based in [[Dublin]], is responsible for enforcing health and safety at work legislation.<ref name=Ire />

====Spain====
In [[Spain]], occupational safety and health is regulated by the Spanish Act on Prevention of Labour Risks. The [[Ministry of Labour (Spain)|Ministry of Labour]] is the authority responsible for issues relating to labour environment.<ref name="Ministry of Employment">{{cite web|title=Ministry of Employment and Social Security: Home page|url=http://www.empleo.gob.es/en/index.htm|website=www.empleo.gob.es|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref> The National Institute for Labour Safety and Hygiene is the technical public Organization specialized in occupational safety and health.<ref>{{cite web|title=Instituto Nacional de Seguridad e Higiene en el Trabajo (INSHT)|url=http://www.insht.es/portal/site/Insht/|website=www.insht.es|accessdate=16 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326130022/http://www.insht.es/portal/site/Insht/|archive-date=26 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In [[Sweden]], occupational safety and health is regulated by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140813011618/http://www.av.se/inenglish/lawandjustice/workact/ Work Environment Act]. The [[Swedish Work Environment Authority]] is the [[government agency]] responsible for issues relating to the working environment. The agency should work to disseminate information and furnish advice on OSH, has a mandate to carry out inspections, and a right to issue stipulations and injunctions to any non-compliant employer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to Swedish Work Environment Authority|url=http://www.av.se/inenglish/|publisher=[[Swedish Work Environment Authority]]|accessdate=12 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127075953/http://www.av.se/inenglish/|archive-date=27 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===India===
In [[India]], the Labour Ministry formulates national policies on occupational safety and health in factories and docks with advice and assistance from Directorate General of Factory Advice Service and Labour Institutes (DGFASLI), and enforces its Policies through inspectorates of factories and inspectorates of dock safety.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dgfasli.nic.in/about1.htm|title=About DGFASLI- Directorate General, Factory Advice service and Labour Institutes|website=www.dgfasli.nic.in|access-date=2016-04-06}}</ref> DGFASLI is the technical arm of the Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government of India and advises the factories on various problems concerning safety, health, efficiency and well - being of the persons at work places.<ref name=":4" /> The DGFASLI provides technical support in formulating rules, conducting occupational safety surveys and also for conducting occupational safety training programs.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GL3_1JyReisC|title=Challenges of Occupational Safety and Health: Thrust : Safety in Transportation|last=Chaturvedi|first=Pradeep|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=9788180692840|language=en}}</ref>

=== Indonesia ===
In [[Indonesia]], the [[Cabinet of Indonesia|Ministry of Manpower]] is responsible to ensure the safety, health and welfare of workers while working, in a factory, or even the area surrounding the factory where labourers work. There are a few rules that control the safety of workers, for example Occupational Safety Act 1970 or Occupational Health Act 1992.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gajimu.com/pekerjaan-yanglayak/keselamatan-dan-kesehatan-kerja/pertanyaan-mengenai-keselamatan-dan-kesehatan-kerja-di-indonesia-1|title=Pertanyaan mengenai Keselamatan dan Kesehatan Kerja di Indonesia}}</ref> The sanctions, however, are still low and the violations of these laws are still at a high rate - with a maximum of 15 million rupiahs fine and/or a maximum of 1 year in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xperthr.co.uk/international-manual/indonesia-health-and-safety/155684/|title=Indonesia Health and Safety}}</ref>

=== Malaysia ===
In [[Malaysia]], the Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) under the Ministry of Human Resource is responsible to ensure that the safety, health and welfare of workers in both the public and private sector is upheld. DOSH is responsible to enforce the Factories and Machinery Act 1967 and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994]]. Malaysia has a statutory mechanism for worker involvement through elected health and safety representatives and health and safety committees. This followed a similar approach originally adopted in Scandinavia.

=== People's Republic of China ===
[[File:Hardware stores in China specializing in safety equipment, etc - 02.jpg|thumb|Hardware stores in China specializing in safety equipment]]
In the [[People's Republic of China]], the Ministry of Health is responsible for occupational disease prevention and the State Administration of Work Safety for safety issues at work. On the provincial and municipal level, there are Health Supervisions for occupational health and local bureaus of Work Safety for safety. The "Occupational Disease Control Act of PRC" came into force on May 1, 2002.<ref>"Occupational Disease Control Act of the People's Republic of China"  http://www.gov.cn/banshi/2005-08/01/content_19003.htm</ref> and Work safety Act of PRC on November 1, 2002.<ref>"The Work Safety Act of the People's Republic of China"  http://www.gov.cn/ztzl/2006-05/27/content_292725.htm</ref> The Occupational Disease Control Act is under revision. The prevention of occupational disease is still in its initial stage compared with industrialised countries such as the US or UK.

=== Singapore ===
In [[Singapore]], the [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Ministry of Manpower]] operates various checks and campaigns against unsafe work practices, such as when working at height, operating cranes and in traffic management. Examples include Operation Cormorant and the Falls Prevention Campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/more-workers-die-in-falls-from-height|title=More workers die in falls from height|last=hermes|website=The Straits Times|access-date=2016-04-06|date=2015-11-26}}</ref>

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]] the [[Department of Employment and Labour]] is responsible for occupational health and safety inspection and enforcement in commerce and industry apart from mining and energy production, where the [[Department of Mineral Resources]] is responsible.

The main statutory legislation on Health and Safety in the jurisdiction of the Department of Labour is ''Act No. 85 of 1993: Occupational Health and Safety Act as amended by Occupational Health and Safety Amendment Act, No. 181 Of 1993.''

Regulations to the OHS Act include:

In [[Taiwan]], the {{ill|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Taiwan)|zh|勞動部職業安全衛生署|lt=Occupational Safety and Health Administration}} of the [[Ministry of Labor (Taiwan)|Ministry of Labor]] is in charge of occupational safety and health.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Introduction|url = http://www.osha.gov.tw/eng/index.php?code=list&ids=329|website = Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Ministry of Labour|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}</ref> The matter is governed under the {{ill|Occupational Safety and Health Act (Taiwan)|lt=Occupational Safety and Health Act|zh|職業安全衛生法}}.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Occupational Safety and Health Act|url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=N0060001|website = Laws & Regulations Database of the Republic of China|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}</ref>

In 2007, the [[Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System]] (TOSHMS), which defined the basic regulations about occupational safety standard, was released.<ref>[http://www.toshms.org.tw/ TOSHMS台灣職業安全衛生管理系統資訊網] Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System website</ref>

===United Arab Emirates===
[[OSHAD]] was introduced in February 2010 to regulate the implementation of occupational health and safety in the emirates of Abu Dhabi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oshad.ae/en/Pages/Aboutcenter.aspx|title=Pages - About Center}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
Health and safety legislation in the UK is drawn up and enforced by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] and local authorities (the local council) under the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (1974.c37)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref><ref>Health and Safety Executive (2009): A Guide to Safety and Health Regulation in Great Britain. 4th edition. {{ISBN|978-0-7176-6319-4}}, http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web42.pdf.</ref> (HASAWA). HASAWA introduced (section 2) a general duty on an employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees; with the intention of giving a legal framework supporting 'codes of practice' not in themselves having legal force but establishing a strong presumption as to what was reasonably practicable (deviations from them could be justified by appropriate risk assessment). The previous reliance on detailed prescriptive rule-setting was seen as having failed to respond rapidly enough to technological change, leaving new technologies potentially un-regulated or inappropriately regulated.<ref>see Second Reading debate - {{cite journal|title=HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ETC.

Recent major changes to the laws governing asbestos and fire safety management embrace the concept of risk assessment. The other key aspect of the UK legislation is a statutory mechanism for worker involvement through elected health and safety representatives and health and safety committees. This followed a similar approach in Scandinavia, and that approach has since been adopted in countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Malaysia.

For the UK, the government organisation dealing with occupational health has been the [[Employment Medical Advisory Service]] but in 2014 a new occupational health organisation – the [[Health and Work Service]] – was created to provide advice and assistance to employers in order to get back to work employees on long-term [[Sick leave|sick-leave]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26105246|title=New Health and Work Service to get long-term sick back to work|website=BBC News|access-date=2016-04-06|date=2014-02-09}}</ref> The service, funded by government, will offer medical assessments and treatment plans, on a voluntary basis, to people on long-term absence from their employer; in return, the government will no longer foot the bill for [[Statutory Sick Pay]] provided by the employer to the individual.

The UK has now [[Brexit|left the European Union]]. A transition period is in place while the EU and UK negotiate new arrangements for a trade deal, which will end on 31 December 2020. An employer's responsibility to protect the health and safety of people affected by their work activities remains unchanged during the transition period.<ref>Health and Safety Executive, [https://www.hse.gov.uk/brexit/index.htm Brexit: Transition period], accessed 11 April 2020</ref>

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], President [[Richard Nixon]] signed the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Occupational Safety and Health Act]] into law on December 29, 1970. The act created the three agencies which administer OSH, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], and the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.<ref>Della-Giustina, Daniel E. (2000). Developing a Safety and Health Program, New York: Lewis Publishers.</ref> The act authorized the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to regulate private employers in the 50 states, the [[District of Columbia]], and [[US Territories|territories]].<ref>U. S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Retrieved on November 28, 2003, from http://www.osha.gov</ref> The Act establishing it includes a [[general duty clause]] (29 U.S.C. § 654, 5(a)) requiring an employer to comply with the Act and regulations derived from it, and to provide employees with "employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause [them] death or serious physical harm".

OSHA was established in 1971 under the Department of Labor. It has headquarters in Washington, DC and ten regional offices, further broken down into districts, each organized into three sections; compliance, training, and assistance. Its stated mission is ''to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education and assistance.''<ref>{{cite web|title=About OSHA|url=https://www.osha.gov/about.html|website=OSHA|publisher=US Department of Labor|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> The original plan was for OSHA to oversee 50 state plans with OSHA funding 50% of each plan, although it has not worked out that way: there are currently 26 approved state plans (4 cover only public employees),<ref name=AAO /> and no other states want to participate. OSHA manages the plan in the states not participating.<ref name=AAO />

OSHA develops safety standards in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] and enforces those safety standards through compliance inspections conducted by Compliance Officers; enforcement resources are focussed on high-hazard industries. Worksites may apply to enter OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP); a successful application leads to an on-site inspection; if this is passed the site gains VPP status and OSHA no longer inspect it annually nor (normally) visit it unless there is a fatal accident or an employee complaint until VPP revalidation (after 3–5 years).<ref name=AAO /> VPP sites generally have injury and illness rates less than half the average for their industry.

It has 73 specialists in local offices to provide tailored information and training to employers and employees at little or no cost.<ref name=Fanning/> Similarly OSHA produces a range of publications, provides advice to employers and funds consultation services available for small businesses.

OSHA's Alliance Program enables groups committed to worker safety and health to work with it to develop compliance assistance tools and resources, share information with workers and employers, and educate them about their rights and responsibilities. OSHA also has a Strategic Partnership Program that zeros in on specific hazards or specific geographic areas.<ref name=AAO /> OSHA manages Susan B. Harwood grants to [[non-profit organisations]] to train workers and employers to recognize, avoid, and prevent safety and health hazards in the workplace. Grants focus on small business, hard-to-reach workers and high-hazard industries.

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], created under the same act, works closely with OSHA and provides the research behind many of OSHA's regulations and standards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/about/|title=CDC - NIOSH - About NIOSH|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-06-16}}</ref>

==Professional roles and responsibilities==
The roles and responsibilities of OSH professionals vary regionally but may include evaluating working environments, developing, endorsing and encouraging measures that might prevent injuries and illnesses, providing OSH information to employers, employees, and the public, providing medical examinations, and assessing the success of worker health programs.

===Europe===
In Norway, the main required tasks of an occupational health and safety practitioner include the following:
* Systematic evaluations of the working environment
* Endorsing preventive measures which eliminate causes of illnesses in the workplace
* Providing information on the subject of employees’ health
* Providing information on occupational hygiene, ergonomics, and environmental and safety risks in the workplace<ref>Hale A, Ytehus I, 2004, ‘Changing requirements for the safety profession: roles and tasks’, Journal of Occupational Health & Safety – Australia and New Zealand</ref>

In the Netherlands, the required tasks for health and safety staff are only summarily defined and include the following:
* Providing voluntary medical examinations
* Providing a consulting room on the work environment to the workers
* Providing health assessments (if needed for the job concerned).<ref name="Hale, A et alia. 2004">Hale, A. et alia, 2004</ref>

‘The main influence of the Dutch law on the job of the safety professional is through the requirement on each employer to use the services of a certified working conditions service to advise them on health and safety’.<ref name="Hale, A et alia. 2004"/> A ‘certified service’ must employ sufficient numbers of four types of certified experts to cover the risks in the organisations which use the service:
* A safety professional
* An occupational hygienist
* An occupational physician
* A work and organisation specialist.<ref name="Hale, A et alia. 2004"/>

In 2004, 37% of health and safety practitioners in Norway and 14% in the Netherlands had an MSc; 44% had a BSc in Norway and 63% in the Netherlands; and 19% had training as an OSH technician in Norway and 23% in the Netherlands.<ref name="Hale, A et alia. 2004"/>

===US===
[[File:Occupational Safety Equipment.jpg|thumbnail|right|Leather craftsman gloves, safety goggles, and a properly fitted hardhat are crucial for proper safety in a construction environment.]]
The main tasks undertaken by the OHS practitioner in the US include:
* Develop processes, procedures, criteria, requirements, and methods to attain the best possible management of the hazards and exposures that can cause injury to people, and damage property, or the environment;
* Apply good business practices and economic principles for efficient use of resources to add to the importance of the safety processes;

==Differences between countries and regions==
Because different countries take different approaches to ensuring occupational safety and health, areas of OSH need and focus also vary between countries and regions. Similar to the findings of the ENHSPO survey conducted in Australia, the Institute of Occupational Medicine in the UK found that there is a need to put greater emphasis on work-related illness in the UK.<ref>Anonymous (2008), ‘Occupational Health’, Health and Safety News: In Brief, Vol 60, Iss. 3; UK. pg. 6</ref> In contrast, in Australia and the US, a major responsibility of the OHS professional is to keep company directors and managers aware of the issues that they face in regards to occupational health and safety principles and legislation. However, in some other areas of Europe, it is precisely this which has been lacking: “Nearly half of senior managers and company directors do not have an up-to-date understanding of their health and safety-related duties and responsibilities.”<ref>Paton, Nic. 2008, ‘Senior Managers Fail to Show Competence in Health and Safety’ Occupational Health, Vol. 60, Iss. 3; p. 6</ref>

==Identifying safety and health hazards==
===Hazards, risks, outcomes===
[[File:Occupational Safety Equipment.jpg|thumb|Occupational Safety Equipment]]
The terminology used in OSH varies between countries, but generally speaking:
* A [[hazard]] is something that can cause harm if not controlled.
* The outcome is the harm that results from an uncontrolled hazard.
* A [[risk]] is a combination of the probability that a particular outcome will occur and the severity of the harm involved.<ref name="Risk basic definition">{{cite web|title=www.riskmanagementinsight.com|url=http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118061526/http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf|archive-date=18 November 2014}}</ref>

“Hazard”, “risk”, and “outcome” are used in other fields to describe e.g. environmental damage, or damage to equipment. However, in the context of OSH, “harm” generally describes the direct or indirect degradation, temporary or permanent, of the physical, mental, or social well-being of workers. For example, repetitively carrying out [[manual handling]] of heavy objects is a hazard. The outcome could be a [[Musculoskeletal disorders|musculoskeletal disorder]] (MSD) or an acute back or joint injury. The risk can be expressed numerically (e.g. a 0.5 or 50/50 chance of the outcome occurring during a year), in relative terms (e.g. "high/medium/low"), or with a multi-dimensional classification scheme (e.g. situation-specific risks).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Hazard identification===
Hazard identification or assessment is an important step in the overall risk assessment and risk management process. It is where individual work hazards are identified, assessed and controlled/eliminated as close to source (location of the hazard) as reasonably as possible. As technology, resources, social expectation or regulatory requirements change, hazard analysis focuses controls more closely toward the source of the hazard. Thus hazard control is a dynamic program of prevention. Hazard based programs also have the advantage of not assigning or implying there are "acceptable risks" in the workplace.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Öztaş|first1=Dilek|last2=Kurt|first2=Burak|last3=Koç|first3=Ayşegül|last4=Akbaba|first4=Muhsin|date=2018-07-03|title=Living Conditions, Access to Healthcare Services, and Occupational Health and Safety Conditions of Migrant Seasonal Agricultural Workers in the Çukurova Region|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=262–269|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1470048|pmid=30047859|s2cid=51719113|issn=1059-924X}}</ref> A hazard-based program may not be able to eliminate all risks, but neither does it accept "satisfactory" – but still risky – outcomes. And as those who calculate and manage the risk are usually managers while those exposed to the risks are a different group, workers, a hazard-based approach can by-pass conflict inherent in a risk-based approach. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The information that needs to be gathered from sources should apply to the specific type of work from which the hazards can come from. As mentioned previously, examples of these sources include interviews with people who have worked in the field of the hazard, history and analysis of past incidents, and official reports of work and the hazards encountered. Of these, the personnel interviews may be the most critical in identifying undocumented practices, events, releases, hazards and other relevant information. Once the information is gathered from a collection of sources, it is recommended for these to be digitally archived (to allow for quick searching) and to have a physical set of the same information in order for it to be more accessible. One innovative way to display the complex historical hazard information is with a historical hazards identification map, which distills the hazard information into an easy to use graphical format.

===Risk assessment===
{{Main|Occupational risk assessment}}
Modern occupational safety and health legislation usually demands that a [[risk assessment]] be carried out prior to making an intervention. It should be kept in mind that risk management requires risk to be managed to a level which is as low as is reasonably practical.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

This assessment should:
* Identify the hazards
* Identify all affected by the hazard and how
* Evaluate the risk
* Identify and prioritize appropriate control measures.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The calculation of risk is based on the likelihood or [[probability]] of the harm being realized and the severity of the consequences. This can be expressed mathematically as a [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] assessment (by assigning low, medium and high likelihood and severity with integers and multiplying them to obtain a [[risk factor]]), or qualitatively as a description of the circumstances by which the harm could arise.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The assessment should be recorded and reviewed periodically and whenever there is a significant change to work practices. The assessment should include practical recommendations to control the risk. Once recommended controls are implemented, the risk should be re-calculated to determine if it has been lowered to an acceptable level. Generally speaking, newly introduced controls should lower risk by one level, i.e., from high to medium or from medium to low.<ref>Stephan, Constantin (2012), Industrial Health, Safety and Environmental Management, epubli, Berlin, 3rd edition 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-7418-7478-9}}, pp. 70-71</ref>

==Contemporary developments==
On an international scale, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have begun focusing on labour environments in developing nations with projects such as [[Healthy city|Healthy Cities]].<ref>Swuste, P., Eijkemans, G. "Occupational safety, health, and hygiene in the urban informal sector of Sub-Saharan Africa: An application of the prevention and control exchange (PACE) program to the..." International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health. Abel Publications Services Inc. 2002.</ref> Many of these developing countries are stuck in a situation in which their relative lack of resources to invest in OSH leads to increased costs due to work-related illnesses and accidents. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work states indicates that nations having less developed OSH systems spend a higher fraction of their gross national product on job-related injuries and illness<ref>[Occupational safety and health is good for you; it's good for business. European Agency for Safety & Health. https://osha.europa.eu/en]</ref> – taking resources away from more productive activities. The ILO estimates that work-related illness and accidents cost up to 10% of GDP in Latin America, compared with just 2.6% to 3.8% in the EU."<ref>European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (2007): Facts 76/EN National economics and occupational safety and health. Bilbao, Spain: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, {{ISSN|1681-2123}}.</ref> There is continued use of asbestos, a notorious hazard, in some developing countries. So asbestos-related disease is, sadly, expected to continue to be a significant problem well into the future.

=== Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence ===
The impact of technologies on health and safety is an emerging field of research and practice. The opportunities for improving health and safety through use of [[augmented reality]] (AR) are now endless.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.safetysure.com.au/safety-advice/augmented-reality-will-transform-workplace-health-and-safety/|title=Augmented reality will transform workplace health and safety|last=admin|date=2018-09-17|website=Safetysure|language=en|access-date=2019-09-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.safetysure.com.au/safety-advice/workplace-health-safety-programs-ai/|title=Workplace health & safety programs to benefit from AI|last=John|first=Ninness|date=20 September 2019|website=Safetysure Health and Safety Consultants|accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> There are emerging technologies for which the range of health and safety implications are not well understood and the impacts of [[machine learning]] and its impact on worker health and safety and the health and safety profession is still emerging.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amsj.com.au/ethics-and-artificial-intelligence-who-lives-who-dies/|title=Ethics and artificial Intelligence {{!}} Who lives?

===Nanotechnology===
{{See also|Health and safety hazards of nanomaterials}}

[[File:Nano containment hood.PNG|thumb|right|A nanomaterial containment hood, an example of an engineering control used to protect workers handling them on a regular basis.]]
[[Nanotechnology]] is an example of a new, relatively unstudied technology. A Swiss survey of one hundred thirty eight companies using or producing nanoparticulate matter in 2006 resulted in forty completed questionnaires. Sixty five per cent of respondent companies stated they did not have a formal risk assessment process for dealing with nanoparticulate matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationsgesellschaft.ch/images/fremde_publikationen/Nature_Public_concern.pdf|title=Risks and nanotechnology: the public is more concerned than experts and industry|year=2007|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref> Nanotechnology already presents new issues for OSH professionals that will only become more difficult as nanostructures become more complex. The size of the particles renders most containment and personal protective equipment ineffective. The toxicology values for macro sized industrial substances are rendered inaccurate due to the unique nature of nanoparticulate matter. As nanoparticulate matter decreases in size its relative surface area increases dramatically, increasing any catalytic effect or chemical reactivity substantially versus the known value for the macro substance. This presents a new set of challenges in the near future to rethink contemporary measures to safeguard the health and welfare of employees against a nanoparticulate substance that most conventional controls have not been designed to manage.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=1781.php |title=Nanotechnology risks – the real issues |journal=Technology in Society |volume=27 |pages=23–38 |doi=10.1016/j.techsoc.2004.10.005 |accessdate=2013-02-15|year=2005 |last1=Arnall |first1=Alexander |last2=Parr |first2=Douglass }}</ref>

===Coronavirus===
{{Main|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}
Many countries' health and safety at work arrangements are currently focused on protection against the spread of [[COVID-19]].<ref>E.g. Health and Safety Executive, [https://www.hse.gov.uk/news/coronavirus.htm Coronavirus (COVID-19): latest information and advice], accessed 11 April 2020</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Collegium Ramazzini|first=Bologna|date=2020-06-16|title=24th Collegium Ramazzini statement. Prevention of work-related infection in the COVID-19 pandemic|url=http://ijomeh.eu/24th-COLLEGIUM-RAMAZZINI-STATEMENT-PREVENTION-OF-WORK-RELATED-INFECTIONIN-THE-COVID,122172,0,2.html|journal=International Journal of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health|language=en|volume=33|issue=4|pages=535–557|doi=10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01657|pmid=32430493|issn=1232-1087|doi-access=free}}</ref> Both broad and industry-specific [[workplace hazard controls for COVID-19]] have been proposed to minimize risks of disease transmission in the workplace. 

The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) [[National Occupational Research Agenda]] [https://www.cdc.gov/nora/councils/manuf/default.html Manufacturing Council] established an externally-lead Covid-19 workgroup to provide exposure control information specific to working in manufacturing environments. The workgroup identified disseminating information most relevant to manufacturing workplaces as a priority, and that would include providing content in Wikipedia. This includes evidence-based practices for infection control plans,<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-17|title=Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) {{!}} NIOSH {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/emres/2019_ncov.html|access-date=2020-06-26|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}}</ref> and communication tools. 

===Occupational health disparities===
Occupational [[Health equity|health disparities]] refer to differences in occupational injuries and illnesses that are closely linked with demographic, social, cultural, economic, and/or political factors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/programs/ohd/risks.html|title=CDC - NIOSH Program Portfolio : Occupational Health Disparities : Risks|date=2018-10-19}}</ref>

==Education==
There are multiple levels of training applicable to the field of occupational safety and health (OSH). Programs range from individual non-credit certificates, focusing on specific areas of concern, to full doctoral programs. The [[University of Southern California]] was one of the first schools in the US to offer a Ph.D. program focusing on the field. Further, multiple master's degree programs exist, such as that of the [[Indiana State University]] who offer a master of science (MS) and a master of arts (MA) in OSH. Graduate programs are designed to train educators, as well as, high-level practitioners. Many OSH generalists focus on undergraduate studies; programs within schools, such as that of the [[University of North Carolina]]'s online Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health and Safety, fill a large majority of hygienist needs. However, smaller companies often do not have full-time safety specialists on staff, thus, they appoint a current employee to the responsibility. Individuals finding themselves in positions such as these, or for those enhancing marketability in the job-search and promotion arena, may seek out a credit certificate program. For example, the [[University of Connecticut]]'s online OSH Certificate,<ref name="UConn Credit Online OSH Certificate">{{cite web |title=University of Connecticut Online OSH Certificate|url=http://osh.uconn.edu|accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> provides students familiarity with overarching concepts through a 15-credit (5-course) program. Programs such as these are often adequate tools in building a strong educational platform for new safety managers with a minimal outlay of time and money. Further, most hygienists seek certification by organizations that train in specific areas of concentration, focusing on isolated workplace hazards. The American Society for Safety Engineers (ASSE), American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH), and [[American Industrial Hygiene Association]] (AIHA) offer individual certificates on many different subjects from forklift operation to waste disposal and are the chief facilitators of continuing education in the OSH sector. In the U.S. the training of safety professionals is supported by [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] through their [[NIOSH Education and Research Centers]].

In Australia, training in OSH is available at the vocational education and training level, and at university undergraduate and postgraduate level. Such university courses may be accredited by an Accreditation Board of the [[Safety Institute of Australia]]. The Institute has produced a Body of Knowledge which it considers is required by a generalist safety and health professional, and offers a professional qualification based on a four-step assessment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohsbok.org.au/|title=The OHS Body of Knowledge|last=Knowledge|first=The OHS Body of|website=www.ohsbok.org.au|access-date=2016-04-06}}</ref>

One form of training delivered in the workplace is known as a ''"toolbox talk"''. According to the UK's Health and Safety Executive, a toolbox talk is a short presentation to the workforce on a single aspect of health and safety.<ref>Health and Safety Executive, [http://www.hse.gov.uk/construction/resources/toolboxtalks.htm Toolbox talks], accessed 14 November 2019</ref> Such talks are often used, especially in the [[construction industry]], by site supervisors, front line managers and owners of small construction firms to prepare and deliver advice on matters of health, safety and the environment and to obtain feedback from the workforce.<ref>CITB, Toolbox Talks (GT700/19), accessed 14 November 2019</ref>
