The '''Carte Vitale''' is the [[health insurance]] [[smartcard|card]] of the [[health care in France|national health care system in France]]. It was introduced in 1998 to allow a direct settlement with the medical arm of the [[social insurance]] system.

Since 2008, a second generation of [[smart card]]s is being introducedâ€”the "Carte Vitale 2" carries a picture for identification and the smart card has additional functions of an electronic health insurance card to carry electronic documents of the treatment process.<ref>[http://www.french-property.com/guides/france/public-services/health/health-card/ Carte Vitale]. Accessed May 23, 2012.</ref> The first generation had been a family card carrying the names of all family members, thereby simply declaring they are covered by the French social security health care, while non-residents would need to use the [[European Health Insurance Card]] to prove their health insurance status.<ref>[http://www.gemalto.com/public_sector/healthcare/france.html Government - Healthcare in France] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128184840/http://www.gemalto.com/public_sector/healthcare/france.html |date=January 28, 2012 }} Gemalto.
