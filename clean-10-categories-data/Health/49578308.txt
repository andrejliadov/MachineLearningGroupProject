'''African-American women''' have been practicing medicine informally in the contexts of [[midwifery]] and [[herbalism]] for centuries. Those skilled as midwives, like [[Biddy Mason]], worked both as [[Slavery|slaves]] and as free women in their trades. Others, like [[Susie Taylor|Susie King Taylor]] and [[Ann Bradford Stokes]], served as [[Nursing|nurses]] in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Formal training and recognition of [[African Americans|African-American women]] began in 1858 when [[Sarah Mapps Douglass]] was the first black woman to graduate from a medical course of study at an American university. Later, in 1864 [[Rebecca Crumpler]] became the first African-American woman to earn a [[medical degree]]. The first nursing graduate was [[Mary Eliza Mahoney|Mary Mahoney]] in 1879. The first [[dentist]], [[Ida Gray]], graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1890. It wasn't until 1916 that [[Ella P. Stewart]] became the first African-American woman to become a licensed [[pharmacist]]. [[Inez Beverly Prosser|Inez Prosser]] in 1933 became the first African-American woman to earn a doctorate in [[psychology]]. Two women, [[Jane Hinton]] and [[Alfreda Johnson Webb]], in 1949, were the first to earn a [[Veterinarian|doctor of veterinary medicine]] degree. [[Joyce Nichols]], in 1970, became the first woman to become a [[Physician assistant|physician's assistant]].

This is an [[Alphabet|alphabetical]] list of African-American women who have made significant firsts and contributions to the field of medicine in their own centuries.
