Please note that in these tables, "age" refers to the woman’s age when the pregnancy ended. Consequently, actual numbers of pregnancies that occurred among teenagers are higher than those reported here, because most of the women who conceived at age 19 had their births or abortions after they turned 20 and, thus, were not counted as teenagers.}}</ref> Consequently, the statistics do not include pregnancies that began at age 19, but that ended on or after the woman's 20th birthday.<ref name=Kost /> Similarly, statistics on the mother's marital status are determined by whether she is married at the end of the pregnancy, not at the time of conception.

==History==
Teenage pregnancy (with conceptions normally involving girls between age 16 and 19), was far more normal in previous centuries, and common in developed countries in the 20th century. Among Norwegian women born in the early 1950s, nearly a quarter became teenage mothers by the early 1970s.  However, the rates have steadily declined throughout the developed world since that 20th century peak.  Among those born in Norway in the late 1970s, less than 10% became teenage mothers, and rates have fallen since then.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lappegård |first1=Trude |title=New fertility trends in Norway |journal=Demographic Research |date=15 March 2000 |volume=2 |doi=10.4054/DemRes.2000.2.3 |jstor=26348001 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/23/broadband-falling-teenage-pregnancy-rates-research-internet|title=Is broadband responsible for falling teenage pregnancy rates?|author=Alex Hern|journal=The Guardian|date=2015-06-23}}</ref>

In United States, the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996 included the objective of reducing the number of young Black and Latina single mothers on welfare, which became the foundation for teenage pregnancy prevention in the United States and the founding of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, now known as Power to Decide.<ref name="BusinessInsider">{{Cite web|url=https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/WH/New/other/sotu.html|title=PRESIDENT WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS|website=clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov}}</ref>

==Effects==
According to the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA), "Pregnancies among girls less than 18 years of age have irreparable consequences. It violates the rights of girls, with life-threatening consequences in terms of sexual and reproductive health, and poses high development costs for communities, particularly in perpetuating the cycle of poverty."<ref name="Adolescent Pregnancy">{{cite web |url=http://www.unfpa.org/publications/adolescent-pregnancy |title=Adolescent Pregnancy |year=2013 |publisher= UNFPA}}</ref> Health consequences include not yet being physically ready for pregnancy and childbirth leading to complications and malnutrition as the majority of adolescents tend to come from lower-income households. The risk of maternal death for girls under age 15 in low and middle income countries is higher than for women in their twenties.<ref name="Adolescent Pregnancy"/> Teenage pregnancy also affects girls' education and income potential as many are forced to drop out of school which ultimately threatens future opportunities and economic prospects.<ref name="unfpa.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/adolescent-pregnancy|title=Adolescent pregnancy - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund}}</ref>

Several studies have examined the [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]], [[medicine|medical]], and [[psychology|psychological]] impact of pregnancy and parenthood in teens. Life outcomes for teenage mothers and their children vary; other factors, such as [[poverty]] or [[social support]], may be more important than the age of the mother at the birth. Many solutions to counteract the more negative findings have been proposed. Teenage parents who can rely on family and community support, social services and child-care support are more likely to continue their education and get higher paying jobs as they progress with their education.<ref>Stepp, G. (2009) [http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/family-relationships/teen-pregnancy/15432.aspx Teen Pregnancy: The Tangled Web]. vision.org</ref>

A holistic approach is required in order to address teenage pregnancy. This means not focusing on changing the behaviour of girls but addressing the underlying reasons of adolescent pregnancy such as poverty, gender inequality, social pressures and coercion. This approach should include "providing age-appropriate comprehensive sexuality education for all young people, investing in girls' education, preventing child marriage, sexual violence and coercion, building gender-equitable societies by empowering girls and engaging men and boys and ensuring adolescents' access to sexual and reproductive health information as well as services that welcome them and facilitate their choices".<ref name="unfpa.org"/>

In the United States one third of high school students reported being sexually active. In 2011–2013, 79% of females reported using birth control. Teenage pregnancy puts young women at risk for health issues, economic, social and financial issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0407-teen-pregnancy.html|title=Few teens use the most effective types of birth control{{!}} CDC Online Newsroom {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-07-26|date=2015-04-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/american-teens-sexual-and-reproductive-health?gclid=CjwKCAjw2NvLBRAjEiwAF98GMQqf1xcR9rVqYsvgDK2DXSX3yx-zgoVEevTqbMfRFLVGJBxlD-FuJRoCUL0QAvD_BwE#26|title=American Teens' Sexual and Reproductive Health|date=2016-06-01|work=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en}}</ref>

==Risk factors==

===Culture===
Rates of teenage pregnancies are higher in societies where it is traditional for girls to marry young and where they are encouraged to bear children as soon as they are able. For example, in some sub-Saharan African countries, early pregnancy is often seen as a blessing because it is proof of the young woman's [[fertility]].<ref name=subsahara/> Countries where [[teenage marriage]]s are common experience higher levels of teenage pregnancies. In the [[Indian subcontinent]], early marriage and pregnancy is more common in traditional rural communities than in cities.<ref name=escap/> Many teenagers are not taught about methods of birth control and how to deal with peers who pressure them into having sex before they are ready. Many pregnant teenagers do not have any cognition of the central facts of sexuality.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = MacLeod | first1 = C. | title = The 'Causes' of Teenage Pregnancy: Review of South African Research – Part 2 | journal = South African Journal of Psychology | volume = 29 | pages = 8–16 | year = 1999 | doi = 10.1177/008124639902900102 | s2cid = 144455158 }}</ref>

[[Economic incentive]]s also influence the decision to have children. In societies where children are set to work at an early age, it is economically attractive to have many children.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi1PmIdkVA8C&q=having+children+to+avoid+poverty+in+old+age&pg=PA254|title=Cultural Selection|isbn=9780792355793|last1=Fog|first1=A.|date=1999-02-28}}</ref>

In societies where adolescent marriage is less common, such as many developed countries, young age at first [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] and lack of use of [[contraceptive]] methods (or their inconsistent and/or incorrect use; the use of a method with a high failure rate is also a problem) may be factors in teen pregnancy.<ref name=oecd/><ref name=toosoon>[http://aspe.hhs.gov/HSP/cyp/xsteesex.htm Beginning Too Soon: Adolescent Sexual Behavior, Pregnancy And Parenthood], US Department of Health and Human Services.

===Other family members===
Teen pregnancy and motherhood can influence younger siblings. One study found that the younger sisters of teen mothers were less likely to emphasize the importance of [[education]] and [[employment]] and more likely to accept [[human sexual behavior]], [[parenting]], and [[marriage]] at younger ages.

===Role of drug and alcohol use===
Inhibition-reducing [[Drug abuse|drugs]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] may possibly encourage unintended sexual activity. If so, it is unknown if the drugs themselves directly influence teenagers to engage in riskier behavior, or whether teenagers who engage in drug use are more likely to engage in sex. [[Correlation does not imply causation]]. The drugs with the strongest evidence linking them to teenage pregnancy are [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[MDMA|"ecstasy"]] and other [[substituted amphetamine]]s. The drugs with the least evidence to support a link to early pregnancy are [[opioids]], such as [[heroin]], [[morphine]], and [[oxycodone]], of which a well-known effect is the significant reduction of [[libido]] – it appears that teenage [[opioid dependence|opioid]] [[recreational drug use|users]] have significantly reduced rates of conception compared to their non-using, and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[MDMA|"ecstasy"]], cannabis, and [[amphetamine]] using peers.<ref name=oecd/><ref name="kaiser"/><ref name=Besharov/><ref>Sax, Leonard (2005) [http://www.whygendermatters.com/ ''Why Gender Matters''].

===Early puberty===
{{main|Precocious puberty}}

Girls who mature early (precocious puberty) are more likely to engage in sexual intercourse at a younger age, which in turn puts them at greater risk of teenage pregnancy.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16322170 | doi=10.1542/peds.2005-0542 | volume=116 | issue=6 | title=Early puberty and adolescent pregnancy: the influence of alcohol use | year=2005 | journal=Pediatrics | pages=1451–6 | last1=Deardorff |first1=J |last2=Gonzales |first2=NA |last3=Christopher |first3=FS |last4=Roosa |first4=MW |last5=Millsap |first5=RE| citeseerx=10.1.1.558.9628 | s2cid=36296702 }}</ref>

===Lack of contraception===

Adolescents may lack knowledge of, or access to, conventional methods of preventing pregnancy, as they may be too embarrassed or frightened to seek such information.<ref name="pollingdata"/><ref name="britsexed">Slater, Jon.

''The UNESCO Courier'' Retrieved July 7, 2006.</ref> Contraception for teenagers presents a huge challenge for the clinician. In 1998, the government of the UK set a target to halve the under-18 pregnancy rate by 2010. The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy (TPS) was established to achieve this. The pregnancy rate in this group, although falling, rose slightly in 2007, to 41.7 per 1,000 women. Young women often think of contraception either as 'the pill' or condoms and have little knowledge about other methods. They are heavily influenced by negative, second-hand stories about methods of contraception from their friends and the media. [[Prejudice]]s are extremely difficult to overcome. Over concern about side-effects, for example [[weight gain]] and [[acne]], often affect choice. Missing up to three pills a month is common, and in this age group the figure is likely to be higher. Restarting after the pill-free week, having to hide pills, drug interactions and difficulty getting repeat prescriptions can all lead to method failure.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Adams, A.  |author2=D'Souza, R.|year=2009|title= Teenage contraception|journal= General Practice Update|volume= 2|issue=6|pages= 36–39}}</ref>

In the US, according to the 2002 [[National Survey of Family Growth]], sexually active adolescent women wishing to avoid pregnancy were less likely than older women to use contraceptives (18% of 15–19-year-olds used no contraceptives, versus 10.7% for women aged 15–44).<ref name=trusell&Wynn>National Surveys of Family Growth{{cite journal |vauthors=Trussell J, Wynn LL | title = Reducing unintended pregnancy in the United States | journal = Contraception | volume = 77 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18082659 | doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2007.09.001 | url = http://www.arhp.org/publications-and-resources/contraception-journal/january-2008 }}</ref> More than 80% of teen pregnancies are unintended.<ref name=speidel>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.contraception.2008.06.001| title = The potential of long-acting reversible contraception to decrease unintended pregnancy| journal = Contraception| volume = 78| issue = 3| pages = 197–200| year = 2008| last1 = Speidel | first1 = J.

The [[National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health]] surveyed 1027 students in the US in grades 7–12 in 1995 to compare the use of contraceptives among Whites, Blacks, and [[Hispanic]]s. The results were that 36.2% of Hispanics said they never used contraception during intercourse which is a high rate compared to 23.3% of Black teens and 17.0% of White teens who also did not use contraceptives during intercourse<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sterling|first=Sandra P.|date=2009|title=Contraceptive Use Among Adolescent Latinas Living in the United States: The Impact of Culture and Acculturation|journal=Journal of Pediatric Health Care|volume=23|issue=1|pages=19–28|doi=10.1016/j.pedhc.2008.02.004|pmid=19103403}}</ref>

In a 2012 study, over 1,000 females were surveyed to find out factors contributing to not using contraception.  Of those surveyed, almost half had been involved in unprotected sex within the previous three months.  These women gave three main reasons for not using contraceptives: trouble obtaining birth control (the most frequent reason), lack of intention to have sex, and the misconception that they "could not get pregnant".<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 22555219| year = 2012| last1 = Biggs| first1 = M.

In a study for the [[Guttmacher Institute]], researchers found that from a comparative perspective, however, teenage pregnancy rates in the US are less nuanced than one might initially assume.  "Since timing and levels of sexual activity are quite similar across [Sweden, France, Canada, Great Britain, and the US], the high U.S. rates arise primarily because of less, and possibly less-effective, contraceptive use by sexually active teenagers."<ref name="DJE">{{cite web|last=Darroch|first=Jacqueline E.|title=Teenage Sexual and Reproductive Behavior in Developed Countries: Can More Progress Be Made?|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/eurosynth_rpt.pdf|publisher=The Alan Guttmacher Institute|access-date=14 February 2011|author2=Jennifer J. Frost |author3=Susheela Singh }}</ref>  Thus, the cause for the discrepancy between rich nations can be traced largely to contraceptive-based issues.

Among teens in the UK seeking an abortion, a study found that the rate of contraceptive use was roughly the same for teens as for older women.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6279601.stm | work=BBC News | title=Teenage pregnancy myth dismissed | date=January 22, 2007 | access-date=May 25, 2010}}</ref>

In other cases, contraception is used, but proves to be inadequate. Inexperienced adolescents may use [[condom]]s incorrectly, forget to take [[combined oral contraceptive pill|oral contraceptives]], or fail to use the contraceptives they had previously chosen. [[Pearl index|Contraceptive failure rates]] are higher for teenagers, particularly poor ones, than for older users.<ref name=Besharov>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0190-7409(97)00022-4| pmid = 12295352| title = Trends in Teen Sexual Behavior| journal = Children and Youth Services Review| volume = 19| issue = 5–6| pages = 341–367| year = 1997| last1 = Besharov | first1 = D.

Studies from South Africa have found that 11–20% of pregnancies in teenagers are a direct result of rape, while about 60% of teenage mothers had unwanted sexual experiences preceding their pregnancy. Before age 15, a majority of first-intercourse experiences among females are reported to be non-voluntary; the Guttmacher Institute found that 60% of girls who had sex before age 15 were coerced by males who on average were six years their senior.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 19372525| pmc = 3515795| year = 2009| last1 = Speizer| first1 = I.

In some countries, sexual intercourse between a minor and an adult is not considered consensual under the law because a minor is believed to lack the maturity and competence to make an informed decision to engage in fully consensual sex with an adult. In those countries, sex with a minor is therefore considered [[statutory rape]]. In most European countries, by contrast, once an adolescent has reached the age of consent, he or she can legally have sexual relations with adults because it is held that in general (although certain limitations may still apply), reaching the age of consent enables a juvenile to consent to sex with any partner who has also reached that age. Therefore, the definition of statutory rape is limited to sex with a person under the minimum age of consent. What constitutes statutory rape ultimately differs by jurisdiction (see [[age of consent]]).

Girls exposed to abuse, [[domestic violence]], and family strife in childhood are more likely to become pregnant as teenagers, and the risk of becoming pregnant as a teenager increases with the number of adverse childhood experiences.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/swr/20.3.131| url=http://swr.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/3/131.abstract|title=The link between childhood maltreatment and teenage pregnancy|journal= Social Work Research |year=1996|volume= 20 |issue=3|pages= 131–141|author=Smith, Carolyn }}</ref> According to a 2004 study, one-third of teenage pregnancies could be prevented by eliminating exposure to abuse, violence, and family strife. The researchers note that "family dysfunction has enduring and unfavorable health consequences for women during the adolescent years, the childbearing years, and beyond." When the family environment does not include adverse childhood experiences, becoming pregnant as an adolescent does not appear to raise the likelihood of long-term, negative psychosocial consequences.<ref>Tamkins, T.

Studies have also found that girls whose fathers left the family early in their lives had the highest rates of early sexual activity and adolescent pregnancy. Girls whose fathers left them at a later age had a lower rate of early sexual activity, and the lowest rates are found in girls whose fathers were present throughout their childhood. Even when the researchers took into account other factors that could have contributed to early sexual activity and pregnancy, such as behavioral problems and life adversity, early father-absent girls were still about five times more likely in the US and three times more likely in New Zealand to become pregnant as adolescents than were father-present girls.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ellis BJ, Bates JE, Dodge KA, Fergusson DM, Horwood LJ, Pettit GS, Woodward L | title = Does father absence place daughters at special risk for early sexual activity and teenage pregnancy? | journal = Child Development | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 801–821 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12795391 | pmc = 2764264 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00569 }}</ref><ref>Quigley, Ann (2003) [http://mentalhealth.about.com/cs/familyresources/a/teensex503_2.htm Father's Absence Increases Daughter's Risk of Teen Pregnancy] Health Behavior News Service, May 27, 2003</ref>

[[Foster care]] youth are more likely than their peers to become pregnant as teenagers. The National Casey Alumni Study, which surveyed foster care alumni from 23 communities across the US, found the birth rate for girls in foster care was more than double the rate of their peers outside the foster care system. A University of Chicago study of youth transitioning out of foster care in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin found that nearly half of the females had been pregnant by age 19. The Utah Department of Human Services found that girls who had left the foster care system between 1999 and 2004 had a birth rate nearly three times the rate for girls in the general population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teenpregnancy.org/fostercare/Foster_Care_Project_FactSheet2.pdf |title=Fostering Hope: Preventing Teen Pregnancy Among Youth in Foster Care |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011130/http://www.teenpregnancy.org/fostercare/Foster_Care_Project_FactSheet2.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-28 }}&nbsp;{{small|(42.1&nbsp;KB)}} A Joint Project of The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy and UCAN (Uhlich Children’s Advantage Network) 16 Feb 2006</ref>

===Education===
The Dutch approach to preventing teenage pregnancy has often been seen as a model by other countries. The curriculum focuses on values, attitudes, communication and negotiation skills, as well as biological aspects of reproduction. The media has encouraged open dialogue and the health-care system guarantees confidentiality and a non-judgmental approach.<ref name=dutchmodel>{{cite journal|author=Valk, Guus|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf|title= The Dutch Model|journal=The UNESCO Courier|volume=53|issue=7|page=19|date=July 2000|access-date= July 3, 2011}}</ref>

In the United States, only 39 states and the District of Columbia out of the 50 states require some form of sex education of HIV education. <ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-03-14|title=Sex and HIV Education|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Guttmacher Institute|language=en}}</ref> Out of these 39 states and the District of Columbia, only 17 states require that the sexual education provided be medically accurate, and only 3 states prohibit a program from promoting sexual education in a religious way. These three states include California, Colorado, and Louisiana. Additionally, 19 of those 39 states stress the importance of only having sex when in a committed marriage. <ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-03-14|title=Sex and HIV Education|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/sex-and-hiv-education|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Guttmacher Institute|language=en}}</ref> From this data, 11 states currently have no requirement for sexual education for any years of schooling, meaning these 11 states may have no sexual education at all. This could also mean these states are allowed to teach sexual education in anyway they would like, including in medically inaccurate ways. This point is also valid for those 22 states that do not require sexual education to be medically accurate. Comprehensive sexual education has been proven to work to reduce the risk of teen pregnancies. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Sexuality Education|url=https://advocatesforyouth.org/resources/fact-sheets/sexuality-education-2/|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Advocates for Youth|language=en}}</ref> Without a nation wide mandate for medically accurate programs, teenagers in the United States are at risk for missing out on valuable information that can protect them. It is unfair to expect teenagers to make educated decisions about sex that can lead to teen pregnancy when they have never been properly educated about the issue. A program developed by experts in public health and sexual education titled ''National Sexuality Education Standards,'' is a valuable resource that describes what the minimum requirements of sexual education should be across the nation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sexuality Education|url=https://advocatesforyouth.org/resources/fact-sheets/sexuality-education-2/|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Advocates for Youth|language=en}}</ref> Giving teenagers the tools that are outlined in that roadmap would have positive effects, as it gives teenagers the resources to make educated decisions. Currently, there is not a national implementation of this program in the United States.

===Public policy===
====Canada====
In 2018, [[Quebec|Québec]]'s Institut national de santé publique (INSPQ) began implementing adjustments to the Protocole de contraception du Québec (Québec Contraception Protocol). The new protocol allows [[Registered nurse|registered nurses]] to prescribe hormonal birth control, an IUD or emergency birth control to women, as long as they comply with prescribed standards in the Prescription infirmière : Guide explicatif conjoint, and are properly trained in providing contraceptives. In 2020, Québec will offer online training to registered nurses, provided by the Ordre des infirmières et infirmiers du Québec (OIIQ). Nurses that do not have training in the areas of sexually transmitted and blood borne infections may have to take additional online courses provided by the INSPQ.<ref>Institut national de santé publique du Québec. 2018.

==== United States ====
[[File:CDC_Teenager_Sex_Stats_2015.png|thumb|upright=1.5|US statistics in April 2015]]
In the US, one policy initiative that has been used to increase rates of contraceptive use is [[Title X]]. Title X of the [[Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970]] ({{USPL|91|572}}) provides family planning services for those who do not qualify for [[Medicaid]] by distributing "funding to a network of public, private, and nonprofit entities [to provide] services on a sliding scale based on income."<ref>{{cite web|last=The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy|title=Policy Brief: Title X Plays a Critical Role in Preventing Unplanned Pregnancy|url=http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/resources/pdf/Briefly_PolicyBrief_TitleX.pdf|access-date=15 February 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807191610/http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/resources/pdf/Briefly_PolicyBrief_TitleX.pdf|archive-date=7 August 2011}}</ref> Studies indicate that, internationally, success in reducing teen pregnancy rates is directly correlated with the kind of access that Title X provides: “What appears crucial to success is that adolescents know where they can go to obtain information and services, can get there easily and are assured of receiving confidential, nonjudgmental care, and that these services and contraceptive supplies are free or cost very little.”<ref name="DJE" /> In addressing high rates of unplanned teen pregnancies, scholars agree that the problem must be confronted from both the biological and cultural contexts.

On September 30, 2010, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]] approved $155 million in new funding for comprehensive sex education programs designed to prevent teenage pregnancy.  The money is being awarded "to states, non-profit organizations, school districts, universities and others. These grants will support the replication of teen pregnancy prevention programs that have been shown to be effective through rigorous research as well as the testing of new, innovative approaches to combating teen pregnancy."<ref>{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services|title=HHS Awards Evidence-based Teen Pregnancy Prevention Grants|url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/09/20100930a.html|access-date=15 February 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110070257/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2010pres/09/20100930a.html|archive-date=10 January 2011}}</ref> Of the total of $150 million, $55 million is funded by [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] through the Personal Responsibility Education Program, which requires states receiving funding to incorporate lessons about both abstinence and contraception.

==== Developing countries ====
In the developing world, programs of reproductive health aimed at teenagers are often small scale and not centrally coordinated, although some countries such as [[Sri Lanka]] have a systematic policy framework for teaching about sex within schools.<ref name="escap" /> Non-governmental agencies such as the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] and [[Marie Stopes International]] provide contraceptive advice for young women worldwide. Laws against [[child marriage]] have reduced but not eliminated the practice. Improved female [[literacy]] and educational prospects have led to an increase in the age at first birth in areas such as [[Iran]], [[Indonesia]], and the [[India]]n state of [[Kerala]].

===Other===
A team of researchers and educators in California have published a list of "best practices" in the prevention of teen pregnancy, which includes, in addition to the previously mentioned concepts, working to "instill a belief in a successful future", male involvement in the prevention process, and designing interventions that are culturally relevant.<ref name=joe>{{cite journal|author1=Fe Moncloa |author2=Marilyn Johns |author3=Elizabeth J.

The overall trend in [[Europe]] since 1970 has been a decreasing [[total fertility rate]], an increase in the age at which women experience their first birth, and a decrease in the number of births among teenagers.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-26338540 | work=BBC News | title=Teen pregnancy rate 'lower still' | date=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Most continental [[Western European]] countries have very low teenage birth rates. This is varyingly attributed to good [[sex education]] and high levels of [[contraceptive]] use (in the case of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Scandinavia]]), [[traditional values]] and [[social stigma]]tization (in the case of [[Spain]] and [[Italy]]) or both (in the case of [[Switzerland]]).<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

On the other hand, the teen birth rate is very high in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. As of 2015, Bulgaria had a birth rate of 37/1.000 women aged 15–19, and Romania of 34.<ref name="data.worldbank.org">{{cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.ADO.TFRT|title=Adolescent fertility rate (births per 1,000 women ages 15–19) – Data|website=data.worldbank.org}}</ref> The teen birth rate of these two countries is even higher than that of underdeveloped countries like [[Burundi]] and [[Rwanda]].<ref name="data.worldbank.org"/>
Many of the teen births occur in [[Romani people|Roma]] populations, who have an occurrence of teenage pregnancies well above the local average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/21599-silence-makes-babies.html|title=Silence Makes Babies – Transitions Online|last=http://www.tol.org|website=www.tol.org}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Teenage pregnancy and sexual health in the United Kingdom}}
The teen pregnancy rate in England and Wales was 23.3 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 17. There were 5,740 pregnancies in girls aged under 18 in the three months to June 2014, data from the [[Office for National Statistics]] shows. This compares with 6,279 in the same period in 2013 and 7,083 for the June quarter the year before that. Historically, the UK has had one of the highest teenage pregnancy and abortion rates in Western Europe.

There are no comparable rates for conceptions across Europe, but the under-18 birth rate suggests England is closing the gap. The under-18 birth rate in 2012 in [[England and Wales]] was 9.2, compared with an [[EU]] average of 6.9. However, the UK birth rate has fallen by almost a third (32.3%) since 2004 compared with a fall of 15.6% in the EU. In 2004, the UK rate was 13.6 births per 1,000 women aged 15–17 compared with an EU average rate of 7.7.

A spokeswoman for the [[British Pregnancy Advisory Service]] said: "Contrary to popular perception, this data shows that the teenage pregnancy rate is falling dramatically in England and Wales. While the UK has historically had a high teenage conception rate, it is now at its lowest level on record and not significantly out of step with other European countries.

"We have seen a huge decline in the number of babies born to teenage mothers over the last decade, in part due to the improvements we've seen in contraception advice and services for younger women, with straightforward access to abortion services when their chosen method lets them down. But it also reflects broader societal shifts, with younger women quite rightly expecting and able to pursue educational and professional ambitions."<ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34050975|title=Teen pregnancy rate continues to fall|journal=BBC News|date=2015-08-25}}</ref>

==Teenage fatherhood==
In some cases, the father of the child is the husband of the teenage girl. The conception may occur within wedlock, or the pregnancy itself may precipitate the marriage (the so-called [[shotgun wedding]]). In countries such as [[India]], the majority of teenage births occur within marriage.<ref name=escap/><ref name=oecd/>

In other countries, such as the US and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the majority of teenage mothers are not married to the father of their children.<ref name=oecd/><ref>National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy. (2007).
