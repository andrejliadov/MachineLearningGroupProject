The Association of Directors of Public Health in the United Kingdom, joined by over one hundred signatory organizations including [[Sustrans]] and the Royal College of Physicians on a position paper on active travel, set out a number of clear policy measures recommended for local planning and highway authorities, including: 
* A 20&nbsp;mph (32&nbsp;km/h) speed limit for residential areas.
* Cycling road infrastructure that provides for convenient and practical transportation.
* Education of drivers and revamped law enforcement to improve road safety.
* Publishing clear goals for the expansion of active transportation.<ref>[http://www.adph.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Take_action_on_active_travel_20104.pdf "Take action on active travel" (PDF)]. Association of Directors of Public Health. January 2010. Retrieved 24 July 2020.</ref>
