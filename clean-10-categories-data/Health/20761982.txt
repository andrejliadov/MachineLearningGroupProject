'''''BodyLove''''' is a radio [[soap opera]] in which the characters face common [[health]] problems and attempt to deal with them using practical solutions and [[healthy diet|healthier eating]]. Billed as "the soap opera that's good for you", ''BodyLove'' uses fictional drama to reach [[African American]] listeners with messages that promote healthy lifestyles.<ref name="mmc7">{{cite web |title=In the Spotlight: BodyLove |publisher=Media/Materials Clearinghouse |url=http://www.m-mc.org/spotlight/bodylove/ |accessdate=December 18, 2008}}</ref><ref name="anna">{{cite news |work=The Anniston Star |title=Radio show looks to help listeners live healthy lives |date=December 6, 2004 |first=Jessica |last=Centers}}</ref><ref name="doth">{{cite news |first=Peggy |last=Ussery |work=Dothan Eagle |title=Dothan radio soap opera puts focus on health issues |url=http://www.dothaneagle.com/dea/lifestyles/local/article/dothan_radio_soap_opera_puts_focus_on_health_issues/25559/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110710145822/http://www.dothaneagle.com/dea/lifestyles/local/article/dothan_radio_soap_opera_puts_focus_on_health_issues/25559/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 10, 2011 |date=July 1, 2008 }}</ref> The program is based upon the principles of "entertainment-education" that have been recommended for reaching audiences not reached by traditional [[health education]] and health promotion messages.<ref name="mmc7"/>

==Summary==
In each weekly 15-minute episode, characters deal with a variety of health problems while trying to navigate personal relationships and deal with strains both financial and emotional.<ref name="lat1"/> The drama revolves around characters who work and spend their time at a fictitious [[Birmingham, Alabama]], [[beauty salon]] called "BodyLove".<ref name="anna"/> ''BodyLove'' focuses on the family of Vanessa Love, an [[African American]] woman in early middle-age who owns the salon and struggles with issues of diet, [[high blood pressure]], weight gain, [[substance abuse]], stress, and death.<ref name="nb1">{{cite news |first=John |last=Archibald |url=http://blog.al.com/archiblog/2008/04/bodylove_takes_health_serially.html |work=The Birmingham News |title=BodyLove takes health serially |date=April 15, 2008}}</ref> Vanessa is also raising three children with little help from her husband, a [[recovering alcoholic]].<ref name="lat1"/> The characters make progress through modest lifestyle changes.<ref name="lat1"/>

==History==
''BodyLove'' was created by Dr. Connie Kohler, a public-health professor at the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]].<ref name="lat1"/> The show began in 2002 as a single 10-episode series on [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] station [[WJLD]] (1400 AM).<ref name="mmc7"/> It quickly expanded in scope and affiliate coverage to a multi-year saga heard in all of [[Alabama]]'s population centers.<ref name="abt9">{{cite web |publisher=BodyLove official website |title=About the Project |url=http://www.soph.uab.edu:80/bodylove/RadioStation/About%20the%20project.htm |accessdate=December 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707092824/http://www.soph.uab.edu/bodylove/RadioStation/About%20the%20project.htm |archivedate=July 7, 2008 }}</ref>

The first 80 episodes of ''BodyLove'' aired across the state of [[Alabama]] in four 20-episode seasons between 2003 and 2007. After a fundraising break, Kohler and her partners resumed writing and producing new episodes, which began airing in late 2008 after local stations cycled through reruns of the earlier seasons.<ref name="lat1"/> The show's episodes were written by UAB faculty and UAB students in screen-writing classes taught by Lee Shackleford.<ref name="nb1"/>

''BodyLove'' is currently a project of Media for Health and the UAB School of Public Health. Media for Health is a private [[non-profit organization]] formed in September 2006 to produce, promote, and distribute ''BodyLove''.<ref name="mmc7"/> Funding for ''BodyLove'' is provided by local and national charitable foundations, in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Local Initiative Funding Partners Program.<ref name="mmc7"/><ref name="abt9"/>

==Presentation==
On most affiliate stations, each episode is followed by a 45-minute talk period where listeners may speak to local health experts and get information about local health resources.<ref name="mmc7"/> For example, on [[WJUS]] in [[Marion, Alabama]], the program is hosted locally by registered nurse Frances Ford who bookends the show with a listener call-in show offering advice, support, and "practical steps to better health".<ref name="lat1"/> Since nearly one-third of [[Perry County, Alabama|Perry County]] residents live in poverty, Ford tailors her on-air nutrition tips to suit local budgets.<ref name="lat1"/> On [[WJJN (FM)|WJJN]] in [[Dothan, Alabama]], the call-in program following each episode is hosted by Dr. Harriett Searcy, medical director at the Alfred Saliba Family Services Center's Family Health Clinic.<ref name="doth"/> On [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] station [[WJLD]] (1400 AM), hosts included Dr. Pamela Plummer, Jann Robinson and Benita Wrenn. Wrenn was also a part of the Bodylove Writer's Group.
