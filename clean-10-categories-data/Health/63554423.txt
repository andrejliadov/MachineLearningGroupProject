The [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], was detected on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}} in March 2020 while she was at sea. Affected crew members were evacuated and the ship was ordered to [[Guam]]. The captain, [[Brett Crozier]], wanted most of the crew to be removed from the ship to prevent the spread of the disease, but his superiors were reluctant. After several days Crozier e-mailed three of his superior officers and seven other Navy Captains, outlining a plan for the ship to be largely evacuated because the virus could not be contained on board. The letter leaked to the press, and the next day the Navy ordered most of the crew to be taken ashore, but the captain was relieved of command by Acting Secretary of the Navy [[Thomas Modly]]. Modly's order was controversial, and his later speech to the crew aboard ''Theodore Roosevelt'' was criticized. Modly resigned a few days later. By mid-April hundreds of crew members including Crozier had tested positive for the virus, and one had died.

On 5 March, the ship made a four-day-long port call at [[Da Nang]], Vietnam. On the last night some sailors stayed at a hotel where two people had tested positive for [[COVID-19]].

The memo outlined the coronavirus outbreak aboard the ship and recommended that he be given permission to evacuate all non-essential sailors, quarantine known COVID-19 cases, and sanitize the ship.

==Crozier's letter==
[[File:Brett E. Crozier (2).jpg|thumb|Ship's commanding officer, Captain [[Brett Crozier]]]]
When the ship arrived in Guam on 26 March the ship's commanding officer, Captain [[Brett Crozier]], wanted to have most of the crew immediately taken ashore, saying it was impossible to prevent the spread of the virus in the close quarters of the ship. Rear Adm. [[Stuart P. Baker]], who was the commanding officer of [[Carrier Strike Group 9]] and thus Crozier's immediate superior, disagreed, feeling such an action was impractical and too drastic.<ref name = losses>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/coronavirus-roosevelt-carrier-crozier.html?campaign_id=60&emc=edit_na_20200413&instance_id=0&nl=breaking-news&ref=cta&regi_id=16153474&segment_id=24971&user_id=e9848bda5d7546386411f6e2fbdaf95e |title='There Will Be Losses': How a Captain's Plea Exposed a Rift in the Military|date=13 April 2020|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>

On 30 March, Crozier sent an email to communicate the status of his ship and her crew, saying it was not possible to observe [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]/Navy<ref>{{cite web |title=Restriction of Movement (ROM) guidance.

==Relieving Crozier of command and aftermath==
On 2 April, acting [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy Secretary]] [[Thomas Modly]] relieved Crozier of his command for sending the request for assistance over non-secure email to a "broad array of people" rather than up the chain of command, adding that Crozier "allowed the complexity of the challenge of the COVID breakout on the ship to overwhelm his ability to act professionally". Crozier will remain in the Navy and retain his rank.<ref name="NBC Crozier Relieved"/> As Crozier disembarked, sailors were seen chanting "Cap-tain Cro-zier" in a video posted to [[Twitter]] captioned "Wrongfully relieved of command but did right by the sailors."<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[NBC News]] |title=Videos show sailors cheering Navy captain relieved of command after raising alarm on coronavirus |date=3 April 2020 |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/videos-show-sailors-cheering-navy-captain-relieved-command-after-raising-n1175946 |first=Janelle |last=Griffith}}</ref>

Reaction to Crozier's dismissal was mixed.
