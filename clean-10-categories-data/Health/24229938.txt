'''Leonid Ivanovich Rogozov''' ({{lang-ru|Леони́д Ива́нович Ро́гозов}}; 14 March 1934 – 21 September 2000) was a [[Russian people|Soviet]] [[general practitioner]] who took part in the sixth [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]], 1960–1961. He was the only medical staffer stationed at the [[Novolazarevskaya Station]]. While there, he developed [[appendicitis]], which meant he had to perform an [[appendectomy]] on himself in a prototypical case of [[self-surgery]].<ref name="ExpedBulletin">{{Cite journal|author=L.

==Early years==
Leonid Rogozov was born in [[Borzinsky District|Dauriya]] Station, [[Chita Oblast]], a remote village in eastern Siberia, just {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Soviet border with Mongolia and China, near [[Manzhouli]]. His father was killed in [[World War II]] in 1943. In 1953, Rogozov completed his studies at a secondary school in [[Minusinsk]], [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], and was admitted to the [[Saint Petersburg State Pediatric Medical Academy|Leningrad Pediatric Medical Institute]] (now Saint Petersburg). After graduating in 1959 as a general practitioner, he started clinical training to specialise in surgery. In September 1960, at the age of 26, he interrupted his training and joined the sixth [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] as a medical doctor.

==Antarctic service==
From September 1960 until October 1962, Rogozov worked in Antarctica, in his role as the sole doctor for a team of thirteen researchers at the [[Novolazarevskaya Station]], established in January 1961.

On the morning of 29 April 1961, Rogozov experienced general weakness, nausea, and moderate fever, and later pain in the lower right portion of his abdomen. None of the possible conservative treatments helped. By 30 April signs of localised [[peritonitis]] became apparent, and his condition worsened considerably by the evening. [[Mirny Station|Mirny]], the nearest Soviet research station, was more than 1,600&nbsp;km (1,000&nbsp;mi) from Novolazarevskaya. Antarctic research stations of other countries did not have an aircraft available. Severe blizzard conditions prevented aircraft landing in any case. Rogozov had no option but to [[self-surgery|perform an operation on himself]].

The operation started at 02:00 local time on 1 May with the help of a driver and meteorologist, who provided instruments and held a mirror so Rogozov could observe areas not directly visible. Rogozov lay in a semi-reclining position, half-turned to his left side. A solution of 0.5% [[novocaine]] was used for local anesthesia of the abdominal wall. Rogozov made a 10–12&nbsp;cm incision of the [[abdominal wall]], but while opening the [[peritoneum]] he accidentally cut the [[cecum]] and had to [[Surgical suture|suture]] it. Then he exposed the appendix. According to his report, the appendix was found to have a dark stain at its base, and Rogozov estimated it would have burst within a day. The appendix was resected and antibiotics were applied directly into the peritoneal cavity. General weakness and nausea developed about 30–40 minutes after the start of the operation so that short pauses for rest were repeatedly needed after that. By about 04:00 the operation was complete.

After the operation gradual improvement occurred in the signs of peritonitis and in the general condition of Rogozov. Body temperature returned to normal after five days, and the stitches were removed seven days after the operation. He resumed his regular duties in about two weeks.<ref name="ExpedBulletin" /> The [[self-surgery]] captured the imagination of the Soviet public at the time. In 1961 he was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lentati|first1=Sara|title=The man who cut out his own appendix| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32481442|date=5 May 2015|website=BBC News}}</ref> The incident resulted in a change of policy, and thereafter, extensive health checks were mandatory for personnel to be deployed on such expeditions.

==Later years==
In October 1962, Rogozov returned to [[Leningrad]] and started working on an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] at his alma mater. In September 1966 he published an MD thesis entitled ''Resection of the [[esophagus]] for treating [[esophageal cancer]]''. He later worked as a doctor in various hospitals in Leningrad. From 1986 to 2000 he served as the head of the surgery department of Saint Petersburg Research Institute for Tubercular Pulmonology.

Rogozov died in 2000, aged 66, in Saint Petersburg, Russia, from [[lung cancer]].
