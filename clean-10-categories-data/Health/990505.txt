== Distinguishing mental health from mental illness==
{{See also| Mental illness}}
According to the U.K. Surgeon Journal (1999), mental health is the successful performance of the mental function resulting in productive activities, fulfilling relationships with other people, and providing the ability to adapt to change and cope with adversity. The term mental illness refers collectively to all diagnosable [[mental disorder]]s—health conditions characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior associated with distress or impaired functioning.<ref>National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, 2011{{Full citation needed|date=September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/mentaldisorders.html|title=Mental Disorders|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> Mental health has long been defined as the absence of psychopathologies, such as depression and anxiety.

These include a positive attitude towards the self, personal growth, integration, autonomy, a true perception of reality, and environmental mastery, which include adaptability and healthy interpersonal relationships.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Jahoda|first1=Marie|title=Current concepts of positive mental health|date=1958|doi=10.1037/11258-000|hdl=2027/mdp.39015004395078|magazine=New York}}</ref>

=== Early history ===
In the mid-19th century, William Sweetser was the first to coin the term ''mental hygiene'', which can be seen as the precursor to contemporary approaches to work on promoting positive mental health.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Shook |editor-first=John R. |date=April 2012 |chapter=Sweetser, William |pages=1016–1020 |title=Dictionary of Early American Philosophers |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |isbn=978-1-4411-7140-5 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOqoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1017 }}</ref><ref name=Mandell1995>{{cite web |first=Wallace |last=Mandell |date=1995 |title=Origins of Mental Health, The Realization of an Idea |website=Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |location=Baltimore, MD |access-date=9 June 2015 |url=http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/mental-health/about-us/origins-of-mental-health.html }}</ref> [[Isaac Ray]], the fourth president<ref>{{cite web|title=Isaac Ray Award|url=https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/awards-leadership-opportunities/awards/isaac-ray-award|website=www.psychiatry.org|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|access-date=27 October 2017}}</ref> of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and one of its founders, further defined mental hygiene as "the art of preserving the mind against all incidents and influences calculated to deteriorate its qualities, impair its energies, or derange its movements".<ref name=Mandell1995/>

In American history, mentally ill patients were thought to be religiously punished. This response persisted through the 1700s, along with inhumane confinement and stigmatization of such individuals.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=A Brief History of Mental Illness and the U.S. Mental Health Care System|url=http://www.uniteforsight.org/mental-health/module2|website=www.uniteforsight.org|access-date=2020-05-11}}</ref> [[Dorothea Dix]] (1802–1887) was an important figure in the development of the "mental hygiene" movement.

[[Emil Kraepelin]] in 1896 developed the [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of mental disorders which has dominated the field for nearly 80 years. Later, the proposed disease model of abnormality was subjected to analysis and considered normality to be relative to the physical, geographical and cultural aspects of the defining group.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ebert |first1=Andreas |last2=Bär |first2=Karl-Jürgen |title=Emil Kraepelin: A pioneer of scientific understanding of psychiatry and psychopharmacology |journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry |date=2010 |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=191–192 |doi=10.4103/0019-5545.64591 |pmid=20838510 |pmc=2927892 }}</ref>

The mental hygiene movement, similar to the [[social hygiene movement]], had at times been associated with advocating [[eugenics]] and [[sterilisation (medicine)|sterilisation]] of those considered too mentally deficient to be assisted into productive work and contented family life.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=C9IOAAAAQAAJ&dq=%27moral+hygiene%27+%27social+hygiene%27+%27mental+hygiene%27+movement&source=gbs_navlinks_s Social Hygiene in 20th Century Britain] Taylor & Francis, Page 80 to 83</ref><ref>[http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Gr-Im/Hygiene.html Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society: Hygiene] Jacqueline S.

==== Deinstitutionalization and transinstitutionalization ====
When state hospitals were accused of violating human rights, advocates pushed for [[deinstitutionalization]]: the replacement of federal mental hospitals for [[community mental health service]]s. The closure of state-provisioned psychiatric hospitals was enforced by the Community Mental Health Centers Act in 1963 that laid out terms in which only patients who posed an imminent danger to others or themselves could be admitted into state facilities.<ref>{{Cite document|title=New York Times New York State Poll, June 2008|date=2009-12-03|doi=10.3886/icpsr26164.v1}}</ref> This was seen as an improvement from previous conditions, however, there remains a debate on the conditions of these community resources.

It has been proven that this transition was beneficial for many patients: there was an increase in overall satisfaction, a better quality of life, more friendships between patients, and not too costly. This proved to be true only in the circumstance that treatment facilities that had enough funding for staff and equipment as well as proper management.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Knapp |first1=Martin |last2=Beecham |first2=Jennifer |last3=McDaid |first3=David |last4=Matosevic |first4=Tihana |last5=Smith |first5=Monique |title=The economic consequences of deinstitutionalisation of mental health services: lessons from a systematic review of European experience: Economic consequences of deinstitutionalisation of mental health services |journal=Health & Social Care in the Community |date=December 2010 |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=113–125 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2524.2010.00969.x |pmid=21143545 }}</ref> However, this idea is a polarizing issue. Critics of deinstitutionalization argue that poor living conditions prevailed, patients were lonely, and they did not acquire proper medical care in these treatment homes.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal |last1=Novella |first1=Enric J. |title=Mental health care and the politics of inclusion: A social systems account of psychiatric deinstitutionalization |journal=Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics |date=December 2010 |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=411–427 |doi=10.1007/s11017-010-9155-8 |pmid=20711755 |s2cid=23328647 }}</ref> Additionally, patients that were moved from state psychiatric care to nursing and residential homes had deficits in crucial aspects of their treatment. Some cases result in the shift of care from health workers to patients’ families, where they do not have the proper funding or medical expertise to give proper care.<ref name=":4" /> On the other hand, patients that are treated in community mental health centers lack sufficient cancer testing, [[vaccination]]s, or otherwise regular medical check-ups.<ref name=":4" />

Other critics of state deinstitutionalization argue that this was simply a transition to “[[transinstitutionalization]]”, or the idea that prisons and state-provisioned hospitals are interdependent. In other words, patients become inmates. This draws on the Penrose Hypothesis of 1939, which theorized that there was an inverse relationship between prisons’ population size and the number of psychiatric hospital beds.<ref name=":5">{{cite journal |last1=Schildbach |first1=Sebastian |last2=Schildbach |first2=Carola |title=Criminalization Through Transinstitutionalization: A Critical Review of the Penrose Hypothesis in the Context of Compensation Imprisonment |journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry |date=25 October 2018 |volume=9 |pages=534 |doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00534 |pmid=30410452 |pmc=6209624 }}</ref> This means that populations that require psychiatric mental care will transition between institutions, which in this case, includes state psychiatric hospitals and criminal justice systems. Thus, a decrease in available psychiatric hospital beds occurred at the same time as an increase in inmates.<ref name=":5" /> Although some are skeptical that this is due to other external factors, others will reason this conclusion to a lack of empathy for the mentally ill. There is no argument in the social stigmatization of those with mental illnesses, they have been widely marginalized and discriminated against in society.<ref name=":3" /> In this source, researchers analyze how most compensation prisoners (detainees who are unable or unwilling to pay a fine for petty crimes) are unemployed, homeless, and with an extraordinarily high degree of mental illnesses and [[substance abuse]].<ref name=":5" /> Compensation prisoners then lose prospective job opportunities, face social marginalization, and lack access to resocialization programs which ultimately facilitate reoffending.<ref name=":5" /> The research sheds light on how the mentally ill — and in this case, the poor— are further punished for certain circumstances that are beyond their control, and that this is a vicious cycle that repeats itself. Thus, prisons embody another state-provisioned mental hospital.

Families of patients, advocates, and mental health professionals still call for the increase in more well-structured community facilities and treatment programs with a higher quality of long-term inpatient resources and care. With this more structured environment, the United States will continue with more access to mental health care and an increase in the overall treatment of the mentally ill.

Mental health and stability is a very important factor in a person's everyday life. The human brain develops many skills at an early age including [[social skills]], behavioral skills, and one's way of thinking. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn at a young age. This starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are people in society who have difficulties with these skills and behave differently. A mental illness consists of a wide range of conditions that affects a person's mood, thinking, and behavior.<ref>proof missing</ref> About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though many develop one, even as early as age three.

The most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to [[anxiety disorder]], as well as [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]] in older children and teens. Having a mental illness at a younger age is different from having one in adulthood. Children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five.<ref name="Lee, Francis S. 2014">{{cite journal |last1=Lee|first1=Francis S. |last2=Heimer|first2=Hakon |last3=Giedd|first3=Jay N. |last4=Lein|first4=Edward S. |last5=Šestan|first5=Nenad |last6=Weinberger|first6=Daniel R. |last7=Casey|first7=B.J. |title=Adolescent Mental Health—Opportunity and Obligation |journal=Science |volume=346 |issue=6209 |pages=547–549 |date=31 October 2014 |pmid=25359951 |doi=10.1126/science.1260497 |pmc=5069680|bibcode=2014Sci...346..547L }}</ref>  When a mental illness is thrown into the mix, it becomes significantly harder for a child to acquire the necessary skills and habits that people use throughout the day. For example, behavioral skills don't develop as fast as motor or sensory skills do.<ref name="Lee, Francis S. 2014"/> So when a child has an anxiety disorder, they begin to lack proper social interaction and associate many ordinary things with intense fear.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Staikova|first1=Ekaterina |last2=Gomes|first2=Hilary |last3=Tartter|first3=Vivien |last4=McCabe|first4=Allyssa |last5=Halperin|first5=Jeffrey M. |date=December 2013 |title=Pragmatic Deficits and Social Impairment in Children with ADHD |journal=[[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] |volume=54 |issue=12 |pages=1275–283 |pmid=23682627 |pmc=3648855 |doi=10.1111/jcpp.12082 }}</ref> This can be scary for the child because they don't necessarily understand why they act and think the way that they do.

Mental illness affects not only the person themselves but the people around them. Friends and family also play an important role in the child's mental health stability and treatment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/child-and-adolescent-mental-health/index.shtml|title=NIMH » Child and Adolescent Mental Health|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> If the child is young, parents are the ones who evaluate their child and decide whether or not they need some form of help.<ref name="Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005">{{cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=Stephen P. |date=July 2005 |title=The Stigmatization of Mental Illness in Children and Parents: Developmental Issues, Family Concerns, and Research Needs. |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=714–34 |pmid=15972067 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01456.x }}</ref> Friends are a support system for the child and family as a whole. Living with a mental disorder is never easy, so it's always important to have people around to make the days a little easier. However, there are negative factors that come with the social aspect of mental illness as well. Parents are sometimes held responsible for their child's illness.<ref name="Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005"/> People also say that the parents raised their children in a certain way or they acquired their behavior from them. Family and friends are sometimes so ashamed of the idea of being close to someone with a disorder that the child feels isolated and thinks that they have to hide their illness from others.<ref name="Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005"/> When in reality, hiding it from people prevents the child from getting the right amount of social interaction and treatment to thrive in today's society.

[[Social stigma|Stigmas]] are also a well-known factor in mental illness.  A stigma is defined as “a mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality, or person.” Stigmas are used especially when it comes to mentally disabled people. People have this assumption that everyone with a mental problem, no matter how mild or severe, is automatically considered destructive or a criminal person. Thanks to the media, this idea has been planted in our brains from a young age.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wahl|first1=Otto F. |title=Depictions of Mental Illnesses in Children's Media |journal=[[Journal of Mental Health]] |volume=12 |issue=3 |date=June 2003 |pages=249–58 |doi=10.1080/0963823031000118230 |s2cid=145537429 }}</ref> Watching movies about teens with depression or children with Autism makes us think that all of the people that have a mental illness are like the ones on TV. In reality, the media displays an exaggerated version of most illnesses. Unfortunately, not many people know that, so they continue to belittle those with disorders. In a recent study, a majority of young people associate mental illness with extreme sadness or violent tendencies  .<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fox|first1=C. |last2=Buchanan‐Barrow|first2=E. |last3=Barrett|first3=M. |date=January 2008 |title=Children's Understanding of Mental Illness: An Exploratory Study |journal=Child: Care, Health and Development |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=10–18 |pmid=18171438 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2214.2007.00783.x }}</ref> Now that children are becoming more and more open to technology and the media itself, future generations will then continue to pair mental illness with negative thoughts. The media should be explaining that many people with psychiatric disorders like [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and [[Anxiety]], can live an ordinary life with the correct treatment and should not be punished for something they cannot help. Along with social stigmas, individuals with a mental illness can develop a self-stigma. A self-stigma is when the affected individual does not come forward about their feelings in fear of being judged. These self-stigmas can deter the individual from seeking help and treatment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Feldman |first1=David |title=The Tragedy of Mental Illness Stigma |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/supersurvivors/201808/the-tragedy-mental-illness-stigma |website=Psychology Today |publisher=Psychology Today |access-date=16 November 2020}}</ref>

''Sueki'', (2013) carried out a study titled “''The effect of suicide-related internet use on users’ mental health: A longitudinal Study”''. This study investigated the effects of [[Suicide and the Internet|suicide-related internet use]] on user's suicidal thoughts, predisposition to depression and anxiety, and loneliness. The study consisted of 850 internet users; the data was obtained by carrying out a questionnaire amongst the participants. This study found that browsing websites related to suicide, and methods used to commit suicide, harmed suicidal thoughts and increased depression and anxiety tendencies. The study concluded that as suicide-related internet use adversely affected the mental health of certain age groups it may be prudent to reduce or control their exposure to these websites. These findings certainly suggest that the internet can indeed have a profoundly negative impact on our mental health.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sueki|title=The Effect of Suicide-Related Internet Use on Users' Mental Health.|journal=Crisis|volume=34|issue=5|date=2013|pages= 348–353|pmid=23685338|doi=10.1027/0227-5910/a000201}}</ref>

Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] compared that 50 years ago children were either categorized as good or bad, and today "all children are good, but some are mentally healthy and others are mentally ill". Social control and forced identity creation is the cause of many mental health problems among today's children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.szasz.com/latimes3152001.html|title=from The Los Angeles Times, March 15, 2001 |website=www.szasz.com}}</ref> A behavior or misbehavior might not be an illness but exercise of their [[free will]] and today's immediacy in drug administration for every problem along with the [[law|legal]] over-guarding and regard of a [[Minor (law)|child]]'s status as a [[Child#Age of responsibility|dependent]] shakes their personal self and invades their internal growth.

====The homeless====
{{Further| Homelessness and mental health}}

Mental illness is not only prevalent among children and young adults but also the homeless. Mental illness is thought to be extremely prevalent among homeless populations, though access to proper diagnoses is limited. In an article written by Lisa Godman and her colleagues, they reference Smith’s research on the prevalence of PTSD among homeless people. His research stated, "Homelessness itself is a risk factor for emotional disorder."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Goodman|first1=L.|last2=Saxe|first2=L.|last3=Harvey|first3=M.|year=1991|title=Homelessness as psychological trauma. Broadening perspectives|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1772159/|journal=The American Psychologist|volume=46|issue=11|pages=1219–1225|doi=10.1037//0003-066x.46.11.1219|issn=0003-066X|pmid=1772159}}</ref> What this quote is saying is that being homeless itself can cause the emotional disorder. Without looking for other reasons for emotional disorder and really looking at the simple fact that an individual is homeless can cause the emotional disorder. Godman’s article stated "Recently, Smith ( 1991) investigated the prevalence of PTSD among a sample of 300 randomly selected homeless single women and mothers in St. Louis, Missouri. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, 1981; Robins & Helzer, 1984), she found that 53% of the respondents could be diagnosed as exhibiting full-blown cases of PTSD."{{cite quote|date=October 2020}} As the source explains, the conclusion that was drawn from Smith’s investigation after studying 300 homeless individuals is that 53% of those people were eligible to be diagnosed with PTSD. She continues and states: "Besides, data from clinical observations, self-reports, and empirical studies suggest that at least two commonly reported symptoms of psychological trauma, social disaffiliation and learned helplessness are highly prevalent among homeless individuals and families."{{cite quote|date=October 2020}} Other data were able to prove that PTSD and learned helplessness were two symptoms that were very much present among homeless individuals and families. The question would be how are these people being helped. This is evident that mental health among the homeless is an issue existing but barely touched.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Lisa |last2=Saxe |first2=Leonard |last3=Harvey |first3=Mary |title=Homelessness as psychological trauma.

Hwang and Rochelle E Garner, they talk about the ways that the homeless are getting actually getting help. It states "For homeless people with mental illness, case management linked to other services was effective in improving psychiatric symptoms, and assertive case management was effective in decreasing psychiatric hospitalizations and increasing outpatient contacts. For homeless people with substance abuse problems, case management resulted in greater decreases in substance use than did usual care."{{cite quote|date=October 2020}} The question would be how are these people being helped. As the source explained, case management provided by services helped improve psychiatric symptoms. It also caused a decrease in substance use than usual media care.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hwang |first1=Stephen W. |last2=Tolomiczenko |first2=George |last3=Kouyoumdjian |first3=Fiona G. |last4=Garner |first4=Rochelle E. |title=Interventions to Improve the Health of the Homeless: A Systematic Review |journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine |date=1 November 2005 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=311–311.e75 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2005.06.017 |pmid=16242595 }}</ref>

The Rohingya from Myanmar are a large group of stateless people who experienced war, deprivation of social rights, and other cultural and political instability and they are currently residing in the southeastern part of Bangladesh as refugees.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 148 Rohingya adults in the refugee camp in Bangladesh and the result indicated that people are suffering from post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD), Depression, somatic impairment, and other associated functional impairment as well. this study revealed that all these MHCs developed due to the high level of daily environmental stressors in the camp, also due to lack of food, lack of freedom of movement.<ref name="Riley et al 2017"/>

====Cultural and religious considerations====
Mental health is a socially constructed and socially defined concept; that is, different societies, groups, [[culture]]s, institutions, and professions have very different ways of conceptualizing its nature and causes, determining what is mentally healthy, and deciding what interventions, if any, are appropriate.<ref name=Weare2000_p12>{{cite book |last=Weare |first=Katherine |title=Promoting Mental, Emotional and Social Health: A Whole School Approach |publisher=RoutledgeFalmer |year=2000 |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-16875-5 |page=12}}</ref> Thus, different professionals will have different cultural, class, political and religious backgrounds, which will impact the [[methodology]] applied during treatment. In the context of [[deaf mental health care]], it is necessary for professionals to have cultural competency of deaf and hard of hearing people and to understand how to properly rely on trained, qualified, and certified interpreters when working with [[Deaf culture|culturally Deaf]] clients.

Addressing and eliminating the social stigma and [[Treatment of mental disorders|perceived stigma]] attached to mental illness has been recognized as crucial to education and awareness surrounding mental health issues. In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] organized the campaign ''Changing Minds'' (1998–2003) to help reduce stigma,<ref>Royal College of Psychiatrists: [http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/campaigns/previouscampaigns/changingminds.aspx Changing Minds].</ref> while in the [[United States]], efforts by entities such as the [[Born This Way Foundation]] and ''[[The Manic Monologues]]'' specifically focus on removing the stigma surrounding mental illness.<ref name=WaPo-stigma>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/a-play-that-hopes-to-smash-the-stigma-surrounding-mental-illness/2019/04/26/dcd13a46-65ee-11e9-a1b6-b29b90efa879_story.html|title=A play that hopes to smash the stigma surrounding mental illness.|author=Erin Blakemore|date=29 April 2019|work=The Washington Post|access-date=23 June 2020}}</ref><ref name=KQED-stigma>{{cite web|url=https://www.kqed.org/arts/13856397/manic-monologues-seeks-to-disrupt-the-stigma-around-mental-illness|title='Manic Monologues' Seeks to Disrupt the Stigma Around Mental Illness.|author=Rachael Myrow|date=2 May 2019|work=KQED|access-date=23 June 2020}}</ref> The [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] is a U.S. institution founded in 1979 to represent and advocate for those struggling with mental health issues.

Many [[mental health professional]]s are beginning to, or already understand, the importance of competency in religious diversity and [[spirituality]]. They are also partaking in cultural training to better understand which interventions work best for these different groups of people.

{{Further| Social work}}
[[Social work]] in mental health, also called psychiatric social work, is a process where an individual in a setting is helped to attain freedom from overlapping internal and external problems (social and economic situations, family and other relationships, the physical and organizational environment, psychiatric symptoms, etc.). It aims for harmony, [[quality of life]], self-actualization and personal adaptation across all systems. Psychiatric social workers are [[mental health professional]]s that can assist patients and their family members in coping with both mental health issues and various economic or social problems caused by mental illness or psychiatric dysfunctions and to attain improved mental health and well-being. They are vital members of the treatment teams in Departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences in hospitals. They are employed in both outpatient and inpatient settings of a hospital, nursing homes, state and local governments, substance abuse clinics, correctional facilities, health care services...etc.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Francis |first1=Abraham P. |title=Social Work in Mental Health: Contexts and Theories for Practice |date=2014 |publisher=SAGE Publications India |isbn=978-93-5150-116-9 }}{{page needed|date=November 2019}}</ref>

In the United States, social workers provide most of the mental health services.

==Factors affecting mental health==
=== Economic factors ===
Unemployment has been shown to hurt an individual's emotional well-being, [[self-esteem]], and more broadly their mental health.

[[File:The prevalence of mental illness is higher in more unequal rich countries.jpg|thumb|The prevalence of mental illness is higher in more [[economic inequality|unequal]] rich countries|alt=|left]]Emotional mental disorders are a leading cause of disabilities worldwide. Investigating the degree and severity of untreated emotional mental disorders throughout the world is a top priority of the [[World Mental Health survey initiative|World Mental Health]] (WMH) survey initiative,<ref>{{cite web |title=The World Mental Health Survey Initiative |url=http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmh/ |publisher=Harvard Medical School |access-date=23 January 2016 }}</ref> which was created in 1998 by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thornicroft|first=G|journal=The Lancet|year=2007|volume=370|issue=9590|pages=841–850|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61414-7|title=Use of mental health services for anxiety, mood, and substance disorders in 17 countries in the WHO world mental health surveys|pmid=17826169|pmc=2847360}}</ref> "[[Neuropsychiatric]] disorders are the leading causes of disability worldwide, accounting for 37% of all healthy life years lost through disease.These disorders are most destructive to low and middle-income countries due to their inability to provide their citizens with proper aid. Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, "even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints".

The World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. 
"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet treatment needs. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care."{{cite quote|date=October 2020}}

Knowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near-constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa ([[Nigeria]], South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific ([[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with [[World Bank]] criteria as [[Low income|low-income]] ([[Nigeria]]), lower-middle-income ([[China]], [[Colombia]], [[South Africa]], [[Ukraine]]), higher middle-income ([[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]]), and high-income.

The coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that "the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of [[gross domestic product]] spent on health care".
"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since [[WHO]] Project [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in [[low-income]] and [[middle-income]] countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually <1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill-equipped for it".

=== Stress ===
The [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] discuss how a certain amount of stress is a normal part of daily life. Small doses of stress help people meet deadlines, be prepared for presentations, be productive and arrive on time for important events. However, long-term stress can become harmful. When stress becomes overwhelming and prolonged, the risks for mental health problems and medical problems increase."<ref>{{Cite web|title=20131 Stress|url=https://www.camh.ca/en/health-info/mental-illness-and-addiction-index/stress|access-date=2020-11-13|website=CAMH|language=en-CA}}</ref>

Promotion is defined as intervening to ''optimize'' positive mental health by addressing determinants of positive mental health (i.e. [[protective factor]]s) before a specific mental health problem has been identified, with the ultimate goal of improving the positive mental health of the population. Mental health prevention is defined as intervening to ''minimize'' mental health problems (i.e. [[risk factors]]) by addressing determinants of mental health problems before a specific mental health problem has been identified in the individual, group, or population of focus with the ultimate goal of reducing the number of future mental health problems in the population."<ref name= "MHPPYouth">{{Cite web|title=Promotion & Prevention {{!}} Youth.gov|url=https://youth.gov/youth-topics/youth-mental-health/mental-health-promotion-prevention|access-date=2020-11-17|website=youth.gov}} {{PD-notice}}</ref><ref>Miles, J., Espiritu, R.

In order to improve your emotional mental health, the root of the issue has to be resolved. "Prevention emphasizes the avoidance of risk factors; promotion aims to enhance an individual's ability to achieve a positive sense of [[self-esteem]], mastery, well-being, and social inclusion."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Power|first=A|title=Transforming the Nation's Health: Next Steps in Mental Health Promotion|journal=American Journal of Public Health|year=2010|volume=100|issue=12|pages=2343–6|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2010.192138|pmid=20966366|pmc=2978180}}</ref> Mental health promotion attempts to increase protective factors and healthy behaviors that can help prevent the onset of a diagnosable mental disorder and reduce risk factors that can lead to the development of a mental disorder.<ref name = "MHPPYouth" /> It is very important to improve your emotional mental health by surrounding yourself with positive relationships. We as humans feed off companionships and interactions with other people. Another way to improve your emotional mental health is by participating in activities that can allow you to relax and take time for yourself. [[Yoga]] is a great example of an activity that calms your entire body and nerves. According to a study on well-being by Richards, Campania, and Muse-Burke, "[[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] is considered to be a purposeful state, it may be that those who practice it belief in its importance and value being mindful, so that valuing of self-care activities may influence the intentional component of mindfulness."<ref name="Richards 2010 247"/>

Mental health is conventionally defined as a hybrid of absence of a [[Mental disorders|mental disorder]] and the presence of well-being. Focus is increasing on [[Mental disorders#Prevention|preventing mental disorders]].
Prevention is beginning to appear in mental health strategies, including the 2004 WHO report "''Prevention of Mental Disorders''", the 2008 EU "Pact for Mental Health" and the 2011 US National Prevention Strategy.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite book |author1=National Research Council |author2=Institute of Medicine |editor1-last=England|editor1-first=Mary Jane |editor2-last=Sim|editor2-first=Leslie J. |date=2009 |title=Depression in parents, parenting, and children: Opportunities to improve identification, treatment, and prevention |location=Washington, DC |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=978-0-309-12178-1 |doi=10.17226/12565 |pmid=25009931 }}</ref>{{page needed |date=January 2016}} Some commentators have argued that a pragmatic and practical approach to mental disorder prevention at work would be to treat it the same way as physical injury prevention.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.humanengineers.com/hr_library/staffs-mental-health-workplace-safety-issue/|title=Your Staff's Mental Health Is a Workplace Safety Issue - Humanengineers|date=2017-06-20|work=Humanengineers|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}</ref>

Additionally, social media is becoming a resource for prevention.

===Care navigation===
{{main|Mental health care navigator}} 
Mental health care navigation helps to guide patients and families through the fragmented, often confusing mental health industries. Care navigators work closely with patients and families through discussion and collaboration to provide information on best therapies as well as referrals to practitioners and facilities specializing in particular forms of emotional improvement. The difference between therapy and care navigation is that the care navigation process provides information and directs patients to therapy rather than providing therapy. Still, care navigators may offer diagnosis and treatment planning. Though many care navigators are also trained therapists and doctors. Care navigation is the link between the patient and the below therapies. A clear recognition that mental health requires medical intervention was demonstrated in a study by Kessler et al. of the prevalence and treatment of mental disorders from 1990 to 2003 in the United States. Despite the prevalence of mental health disorders remaining unchanged during this period, the number of patients seeking treatment for mental disorders increased threefold.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kessler|first1=Ronald C. |last2=Demler|first2=Olga |last3=Frank|first3=Richard G. |last4=Olfson|first4=Mark |last5=Pincus|first5=Harold Alan |last6=Walters|first6=Ellen E. |last7=Wang|first7=Philip |last8=Wells|first8=Kenneth B. |last9=Zaslavsky|first9=Alan M. |title=Prevalence and Treatment of Mental Disorders, 1990 to 2003 |date=16 June 2005 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |issue=24 |pages=2515–2523 |doi= 10.1056/nejmsa043266|pmid=15958807 |pmc=2847367 }}</ref>

===Promoting and improving mental health===

==== Pharmacotherapy ====

Pharmacotherapy is a therapy that uses pharmaceutical drugs. Pharmacotherapy is used in the treatment of mental illness through the use of antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and the use of elements such as lithium.

==== Physical activity ====

For some people, physical exercise can improve mental as well as physical health. Playing sports, walking, cycling, or doing any form of physical activity trigger the production of various hormones, sometimes including [[endorphins]], which can elevate a person's mood.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The effects of transport mode use on self-perceived health, mental health, and social contact measures: A cross-sectional and longitudinal study |author1=Ione Avila-Palencia |journal=Environment International|volume=120 |pages=199–206 |date=2018|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2018.08.002 |pmid=30098553 |hdl=10044/1/62973 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

Studies have shown that in some cases, physical activity can have the same impact as antidepressants when treating depression and anxiety.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rebar |first1=Amanda L. |last2=Stanton |first2=Robert |last3=Geard |first3=David |last4=Short |first4=Camille |last5=Duncan |first5=Mitch J. |last6=Vandelanotte |first6=Corneel |title=A meta-meta-analysis of the effect of physical activity on depression and anxiety in non-clinical adult populations |journal=Health Psychology Review |date=3 July 2015 |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=366–378 |doi=10.1080/17437199.2015.1022901 |pmid=25739893 |s2cid=24320503 }}</ref>

Moreover, cessation of physical exercise may have adverse effects on some mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. This could lead to many different negative outcomes such as obesity, skewed body image, lower levels of certain hormones, and many more health risks associated with mental illnesses.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Weinstein |first1=Ali A. |last2=Koehmstedt |first2=Christine |last3=Kop |first3=Willem J. |title=Mental health consequences of exercise withdrawal: A systematic review |journal=General Hospital Psychiatry |date=November 2017 |volume=49 |pages=11–18 |doi=10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2017.06.001 |pmid=28625704 }}</ref>

====Activity therapies====

Activity therapies also called recreation therapy and occupational therapy, promote healing through active engagement.  Making crafts can be a part of occupational therapy.  Walks can be a part of recreation therapy.
In recent years colouring has been recognised as an activity that has been proven to significantly lower the levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety in many studies.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Flett J.A.M., Lie C., Riordan B.C., Thompson L.M., Conner T.S., Hayne H. | year = 2017 | title = Sharpen Your Pencils: Preliminary Evidence that Adult Coloring Reduces Depressive Symptoms and Anxiety | journal = Creativity Research Journal | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 409–416 | doi=10.1080/10400419.2017.1376505| s2cid = 149346431 }}</ref>

====Psychotherapy====

{{main|Psychotherapy}} 
[[Psychotherapy]] is the general term for the scientific based treatment of mental health issues based on modern medicine.  It includes a number of schools, such as [[gestalt therapy]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], [[psychedelic therapy]], [[transpersonal psychology]]/psychotherapy, and [[Dialectical behavior therapy|dialectical behavioral therapy]]. 
[[Group therapy]] involves any type of therapy that takes place in a setting involving multiple people.  It can include [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]] groups, [[expressive therapy]] groups, [[support groups]] (including the [[Twelve-step program]]), problem-solving and [[psychoeducation]] groups.

==== Mental fitness ====

Mental fitness is a mental health movement that encourages people to intentionally regulate and maintain their emotional wellbeing through friendship, regular human contact, and activities that include meditation, calming exercises, aerobic exercise, mindfulness, having a routine and maintaining adequate sleep. Mental fitness is intended to build resilience against every-day mental health challenges to prevent an escalation of anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, and help them cope with the escalation of those feelings if they occur.<ref>{{cite web |last=Walkadean |first=Chad |date=22 June 2020 |title=Mental fitness - a gamechanger |url=https://www.gotcha4life.org/blog/2020/5/14/mental-fitness-gamechanger |website=Gotcha4Life mental health and suicide prevention }}</ref>

==Mental health laws and public health policies==
{{See also| Mental health law|Public Health}}
There are many factors that influence mental health including:
*[[Mental illness]], [[disability]], and [[suicide]] are ultimately the result of a combination of biology, environment, and access to and utilization of mental health treatment.
*Public health policies can influence access and utilization, which subsequently may improve mental health and help to progress the negative consequences of depression and its associated disability.

The mental health policies in the United States have experienced four major reforms: the American asylum movement led by [[Dorothea Dix]] in 1843; the "mental hygiene" movement inspired by [[Clifford Whittingham Beers|Clifford Beers]] in 1908; the [[deinstitutionalization]] started by Action for Mental Health in 1961; and the community support movement called for by The CMCH Act Amendments of 1975.<ref name="U.S. Public Health Service">{{cite book |author=U.S. Public Health Service |date=1999 |title=Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General |chapter=Overview of Mental Health Services |access-date=19 February 2012 |chapter-url=http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter2/sec7.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211145002/http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/mentalhealth/chapter2/sec7.html |archive-date=11 February 2012 }}</ref>

In 1843, [[Dorothea Dix]] submitted a Memorial to the Legislature of Massachusetts, describing the abusive treatment and horrible conditions received by the mentally ill patients in jails, cages, and almshouses. She revealed in her Memorial: "I proceed, gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of insane persons confined within this Commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! Chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience...."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dix |first=D | date=April 2006 | title='I Tell What I Have Seen'—The Reports of Asylum Reformer Dorothea Dix. 1843 |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=622–624 |doi=10.2105/ajph.96.4.622 |pmid=16551962 |pmc=1470564 }}</ref> Many asylums were built in that period, with high fences or walls separating the patients from other community members and strict rules regarding the entrance and exit. In those asylums, traditional treatments were well implemented: drugs were not used as a cure for a disease, but a way to reset equilibrium in a person's body, along with other essential elements such as healthy diets, fresh air, middle class culture, and the visits by their neighboring residents.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In 1866, a recommendation came to the New York State Legislature to establish a separate asylum for chronic mentally ill patients. Some hospitals placed the chronic patients into separate wings or wards, or different buildings.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Luchins |first=AS |date=November 1989 |title=Moral Treatment in Asylums and General Hospitals in 19th-Century America |journal=The Journal of Psychology |volume=123 |issue=6 |pages=585–607 |pmid=2691669 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1989.10543013}}</ref>

In ''A Mind That Found Itself'' (1908) [[Clifford Whittingham Beers]] described the humiliating treatment he received and the deplorable conditions in the mental hospital.<ref>{{cite book |last=Beers |first=Clifford Whittingham |author-link=Clifford Whittingham Beers |date=8 April 2004 |orig-year=1908 |title=A Mind That Found Itself: An Autobiography |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11962/11962-h/11962-h.htm |publisher=Project Gutenberg }}</ref> One year later, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene (NCMH) was founded by a small group of reform-minded scholars and scientists – including Beers himself – which marked the beginning of the "mental hygiene" movement. The movement emphasized the importance of childhood prevention. [[World War I]] catalyzed this idea with an additional emphasis on the impact of maladjustment, which convinced the hygienists that prevention was the only practical approach to handle mental health issues.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cohen |first1=Sol |date=1983 |title=The Mental Hygiene Movement, the Development of Personality and the School: The Medicalization of American Education |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=123–149 |jstor=368156 |doi=10.2307/368156 |pmid=11614585 }}</ref> However, prevention was not successful, especially for chronic illness; the condemnable conditions in the hospitals were even more prevalent, especially under the pressure of the increasing number of chronically ill and the influence of the depression.<ref name="U.S. Public Health Service"/>

In 1961, the Joint Commission on Mental Health published a report called Action for Mental Health, whose goal was for community clinic care to take on the burden of prevention and early intervention of the mental illness, therefore to leave space in the hospitals for severe and chronic patients. The court started to rule in favor of the patients' will on whether they should be forced to treatment. By 1977, 650 community mental health centers were built to cover 43 percent of the population and serve 1.9 million individuals a year, and the lengths of treatment decreased from 6 months to only 23 days.<ref name="Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905">{{cite journal |last1=Koyanagi |first1=C |last2=Goldman |first2=H |date=September 1991 |title=The quiet success of the national plan for the chronically mentally ill |journal=Hospital & Community Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=9 |pages=899–905 |pmid=1743659 |doi=10.1176/ps.42.9.899}}</ref> However, issues still existed. Due to inflation, especially in the 1970s, the community nursing homes received less money to support the care and treatment provided. Fewer than half of the planned centers were created, and new methods did not fully replace the old approaches to carry out its full capacity of treating power.<ref name="Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905"/> Besides, the community helping system was not fully established to support the patients' housing, vocational opportunities, income supports, and other benefits.<ref name="U.S. Public Health Service"/> Many patients returned to [[welfare]] and criminal justice institutions, and more became [[homeless]].

After realizing that simply changing the location of mental health care from the state hospitals to nursing houses was insufficient to implement the idea of [[deinstitutionalization]], the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] in 1975 created the Community Support Program (CSP) to provide funds for communities to set up a comprehensive mental health service and supports to help the mentally ill patients integrate successfully in the society. The program stressed the importance of other supports in addition to medical care, including housing, living expenses, employment, transportation, and education; and set up new national priority for people with serious mental disorders. In addition, the Congress enacted the [[Mental Health Systems Act of 1980]] to prioritize the service to the mentally ill and emphasize the expansion of services beyond just clinical care alone.<ref name="Koyanagi, C. 2007">{{citation |last1=Koyanagi |first1=Chris |date=August 2007 |title=Learning From History: Deinstitutionalization of People with Mental Illness As Precursor to Long-Term Care Reform |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] |location=Menlo Park, CA |pages=1–22 |url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7684.pdf }}</ref> Later in the 1980s, under the influence from the Congress and the Supreme Court, many programs started to help the patients regain their benefits. A new Medicaid service was also established to serve people who were diagnosed with a "chronic mental illness." People who were temporally hospitalized were also provided aid and care and a pre-release program was created to enable people to apply for reinstatement prior to discharge.<ref name="Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905"/> Not until 1990, around 35 years after the start of the deinstitutionalization, did the first state hospital begin to close. The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.<ref name="Koyanagi, C. 2007"/>

However, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care. This failure is attributed to a number of reasons over which there is some degree of contention, although there is general agreement that community support programs have been ineffective at best, due to a lack of funding.<ref name=Torrey_Book/>

The 2011 National Prevention Strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including better parenting and early intervention programs, which increase the likelihood of prevention programs being included in future US mental health policies.<ref name=":0">{{citation |author=National Prevention Council |date=16 June 2011 |title=National Prevention Strategy |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General |location=Washington, DC |url=http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004043040/http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 }}</ref>{{page needed |date=January 2016}} The [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] is researching only suicide and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention, but the National Prevention Strategy could lead to it focusing more broadly on longitudinal prevention studies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prevention of Mental Disorders|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|access-date=7 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705041918/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml |archive-date=5 July 2015 }}{{Failed verification |reason=Source contains a list of publications.

In 2013, United States Representative [[Timothy F. Murphy|Tim Murphy]] introduced the [[National Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Day|Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, HR2646]]. The bipartisan bill went through substantial revision and was reintroduced in 2015 by Murphy and Congresswoman [[Eddie Bernice Johnson]]. In November 2015, it passed the Health Subcommittee by an 18–12 vote.{{citation needed |date=January 2016}}
