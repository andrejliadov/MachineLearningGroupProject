'''AllTrials''' (sometimes called '''All Trials''' or '''AllTrials.net''') is a project advocating that [[clinical research]] adopt the principles of [[open research]]. The project summarizes itself as "All trials registered, all results reported": that is, all [[clinical trials]] should be listed in a [[clinical trials registry]], and their results should always be shared as [[open data]].

At the center of the organisation is a petition signed by over 85,000 individuals and
599 organisations (as of August 2015):

{{quotation | 
Thousands of clinical trials have not reported their results; some have not even been registered.

Information on what was done and what was found in these trials could be lost forever to doctors and researchers, leading to bad treatment decisions, missed opportunities for good medicine, and trials being repeated.

All trials past and present should be registered, and the full methods and the results reported.

We call on governments, regulators and research bodies to implement measures to achieve this.

[[Ben Goldacre]], author of ''[[Bad Science (Goldacre book)|Bad Science]]'' and ''[[Bad Pharma]]'', is a founder of the campaign and its most public spokesperson.

Much medical research is done by the pharmaceutical industry, which have a conflict of interest reporting results which may hurt sales of their products.<ref name=pmid11556304>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMed010093 |pmid=11556304 |title=Sponsorship, Authorship, and Accountability |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=345 |issue=11 |pages=825–6; discussion 826–7 |year=2001 |last1=Davidoff |first1=F |last2=Deangelis |first2=C.

Industry-funded trials are also less likely to be published.<ref name=pmid24169943/><ref name=washpost>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/as-drug-industrys-influence-over-research-grows-so-does-the-potential-for-bias/2012/11/24/bb64d596-1264-11e2-be82-c3411b7680a9_story.html|title=As drug industry's influence over research grows, so does the potential for bias|first=Peter|last=Whoriskey|date=24 November 2012|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref>

If the statistical methods used to analyse the trial are not chosen before the study it started, there is a danger that researchers will intentionally or unintentionally pick the method that gives the results they expect, or which gives the most significant results. This makes the analysis [[Analytical bias|statistically invalid]]<!---Some material from [[Experimenter's bias]] could be used--->.

Not publishing trials which fail to find a clear effect exposes trial volunteers to pointless risk<ref name=pmid12876095>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.290.4.516 |pmid=12876095 |title=Registering Clinical Trials |journal=JAMA |volume=290 |issue=4 |pages=516–23 |year=2003 |last1=Dickersin |first1=Kay |last2=Rennie |first2=D }}</ref> and wastes research effort (as the same trial is repeated over and over). It also biases the medical literature, making it report effects where none exist (since, given enough trials, eventually one will find a difference by pure chance).<ref name=Sterling>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01621459.1959.10501497 |jstor=2282137 |title=Publication Decisions and their Possible Effects on Inferences Drawn from Tests of Significance—or Vice Versa |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=54 |issue=285 |pages=30–4 |year=1959 |last1=Sterling |first1=Theodore D }}</ref>

[[Clinical trials registry|Pre-trial registration]] makes non-publication and changes in analysis methods obvious to medical reviewers. It also enables authors of meta-studies to track down and analyse missing data. Finally, it lets doctors and patients know when a trial is looking for volunteers.<ref name=pmid12876095/>

There are other sources of bias, such as the conditions sometimes attached to funding by funding agencies with a financial interest in the trial's outcome. Medical researchers may be asked to agree to allow the funding agency to censor results. Some funding agencies may also refuse to give the medical researcher access to the raw data, giving them only the finished analysis, or even a draft paper, and asking them to put their name to it. This is not acceptable academic practice, and some academic journals require that authors sign a statement that they have not entered into such agreements.<ref name=pmid11556304/><ref name=washpost/>

==Coverage==

The campaign has been widely covered, and supported, in the academic press. The [[British Medical Journal]] and [[PLOS]] are founding members. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''<ref name=pmid24409508>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/505131a |pmid=24409508 |title=Data sharing will pay dividends |journal=Nature |volume=505 |issue=7482 |pages=131 |year=2014 |doi-access=free }}</ref> and [[The Lancet]]<ref name=pmid24411647>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62228-X |pmid=24411647 |title=Reducing waste from incomplete or unusable reports of biomedical research |journal=The Lancet |volume=383 |issue=9913 |pages=267–76 |year=2014 |last1=Glasziou |first1=Paul |last2=Altman |first2=Douglas G |last3=Bossuyt |first3=Patrick |last4=Boutron |first4=Isabelle |last5=Clarke |first5=Mike |last6=Julious |first6=Steven |last7=Michie |first7=Susan |last8=Moher |first8=David |last9=Wager |first9=Elizabeth |s2cid=28924552 }}</ref> both published supportive articles in January 2014.

There has also been mainstream media coverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/opinion/full-disclosure-needed-for-clinical-drug-data.html|title=Opinion - Full Disclosure Needed for Clinical Drug Data|first=The Editorial|last=Board|date=4 July 2013|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

==Controversy==

There has been criticism from the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] (PhRMA), with senior vice-president Matt Bennett saying that trial data disclosure measures which AllTrials has recommended to the [[European Medicines Agency]]  "could risk patient privacy, lead to fewer clinical trials, and result in fewer new medicines to meet patient needs and improve health.".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/21/big-pharma-secret-drugs-trials|title=Big pharma mobilising patients in battle over drugs trials data|first=Ian|last=Sample|date=21 July 2013|website=the Guardian}}</ref>

AllTrials have published a detailed statement<ref name=ATstatement>{{cite web|url=http://www.alltrials.net/2013/all-trials-registered-and-results-reported/|title=All trials registered and results reported}}</ref> of exactly what they want to see published, which states "The AllTrials campaign is not calling for individual patient data to be made publicly available".

A 2012 editorial published by senior regulators from the European Medicines agency<ref name=pmid22505851/> largely agreed with AllTrials, saying "We consider it neither desirable nor realistic to maintain the status quo of limited availability of regulatory trials data". They were also of the opinion that adequate standards for protection of personal data could be written. However, they warned that third party reanalysis was neither a guarantee of quality nor of lack of conflict of interest, which, in the worst case, could lead to negative public health consequences.

They suggested that reanalyses should therefore be subject to the same regulations as sponsor analyses, such as registering analysis plans. They argued against completely unrestricted access to data, but in favor of broader access.<ref name=pmid22505851>{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001202 |pmid=22505851 |pmc=3323505 |title=Open Clinical Trial Data for All?

The original policy of the [[Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations]] required that funded parties pre-register any trials in a [[clinical trials registry]], publish results within a year of study completion (except with compelling reason and permission of CEPI), publish results in [[open-access]] articles, and have mechanisms for securely sharing underlying data and results, including negative results, in a way that preserves trial volunteer privacy.
