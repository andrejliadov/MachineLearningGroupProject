{{Further|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}
For schools and childcare facilities, the [[United States|U.S]]. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community spread.  When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, [[social distancing]] strategies can be implemented such as postponing or cancelling [[field trip]]s, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as [[physical education]] or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, staggering arrival and dismissal times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.  When there is substantial transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals may be considered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/guidance-for-schools.html|title=Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) - Interim Guidance for Administrators of US Childcare Programs and K-12 Schools | date=2020-03-12|website=U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-21}} {{PD-inline}}</ref>

|As of 16 March, Brazil has more confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other Latin American country, however President [[Jair Bolsonaro]] has issued few country-wide measures to slow the spread of the virus.<ref name=":17" /><ref name=":18" /> Because the president and federal government failed to act regarding the pandemic and had, as of 18 March, not decided to cancel classes in the whole country, lower instances of government acted autonomously.

==== Unequal access to technology ====
Lack of access to technology or fast, reliable internet access can prevent students in rural areas and from disadvantaged families. Lack of access to technology or good internet connectivity is an obstacle to continued learning, especially for students from disadvantaged families.<ref name="UNESCO-consequences" /> Teachers have reported that students are more likely to complete assignments if they have access to internet at home [https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA134-3.html].

=== Childcare ===
{{Main|Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children}}
School closures puts a strain on parents and guardians to provide childcare and manage distance learning while children are out of school.<ref name=":3" /> In the absence of alternative options, working parents often leave children alone when schools close and this can lead to risky behaviours, including increased influence of peer pressure and substance abuse.<ref name="UNESCO-consequences"/>

In the United States, as of early April, more than half of existing childcare programmes had shut down at least temporarily and were not serving any children.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nationwide Survey: Child Care in the Time of Coronavirus {{!}} Bipartisan Policy Center|url=https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/nationwide-survey-child-care-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/|date=10 April 2020|website=bipartisanpolicy.org|language=en|access-date=2020-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Child Care Industry Is About To Collapse.

This is especially true for parents with limited education and resources.<ref name="UNESCO-consequences" />

Students gain literacy slower during school closures than in a business-as-usual academic year. It has been estimated that the rate of reading ability gain in kindergarten children in the U.S slows down by 66% during school closures compared to active schooling.<ref name="Bao 2020"/>

Student drop-out rates tend to increase as an effect of school closures due to the challenge of ensuring all students return to school once school closures ends. This is especially true of protracted closures.<ref name=":3" /><ref name="UNESCO-consequences"/> Disadvantaged, at-risk, or homeless children are more likely not to return to school after the closures are ended, and the effect will often be a life-long disadvantage from lost opportunities.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Baker|first=Jordan| name-list-style = vanc |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/the-kids-who-will-never-return-to-school-after-covid-19-20200411-p54j0e.html#comments|title=The kids who will never return to school after COVID-19|date=12 April 2020|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>

=== Primary ===
Primary or elementary education typically consists of the first four to seven years of formal education. Kindergarten is the first time children participate in formal education. Based on a comparison of longitudinal literacy data in kindergarten-aged students during a spring semester of schooling versus during summer vacation, one study predicted that [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] school closures would slow the rate of literacy ability gain by 66% in kindergarten children in the absence of mitigating alternative educational strategies.<ref name="Bao 2020" />  The study estimates that over an 8-month period from January 1 to September 1, 2020, assuming school closures from March 16 to September 1, 2020 (and taking into account the summer vacation that would have still normally taken place during that time), that these kindergarten children would have gained 31% less literacy ability on average than if school closures had not occurred.<ref name="Bao 2020" />

Instead, students struggle with self-sufficiency and are at risk of falling behind due to distractors in their home and online. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.childandadolescent.org/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-high-school-students/ |title=The Impact of Covid-19 on High School Students |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=<!--Not stated--> |website=www.childandadolescent.org |publisher=Child & Adolescent Behavioral Health |access-date=19 November 2020}}</ref> The social-emotional wellbeing of secondary students is also of concern with a recent survey citing that 80% of students have experienced some negative impact to their mental health due to the pandemic. 20% say their mental health has significantly worsened. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Ellis |first1=Sarah | name-list-style = vanc |title=The Growing Mental Health Effects of COVID-19 for Young Adults |url=https://www.healthcentral.com/article/mental-health-effects-of-covid-19-on-students |access-date=19 November 2020 |work=healthcentral |date=30 September 2020 |location=Web}}</ref> The Center for Disease Control (CDC) suggests that students should get plenty of rest, exercise regularly, and eat well-balanced meals in order to assist in coping with the mental stressors of the pandemic. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/managing-stress-anxiety.html |title=Coronavirus Disease 2019: Coping with Stress |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1 July 2020 |website=www.cdc.gov |publisher=Center for Disease Control |access-date=19 November 2020}}</ref>

=== Grade deflation ===
However, the IBO came under heavy criticism worldwide for their methods in calculating the students' final grades and their "Enquiry upon results" (EUR) strategy after results were released on the 6th of July 2020. Consequently, many students not only received much lower grades than what they were predicted to by their teachers but also missed the entrance requirements to every university they applied to, affecting approximately 170,000 students in 153 countries. As a result, petitions that garnered dozens of thousands of signatures were created online with the hashtag "IBSCANDAL" becoming viral, schools and people have lost confidence with the education company and are considering other alternatives for secondary education, and educational reforms are being suggested where students will deviate away from taking significant examinations in the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tes.com/news/coronavirus-ib-results-scandal-pupils-demand-new-grades|title=IB results 'scandal': Students demand new grades|website=Tes}}</ref>

=== Tertiary (higher) ===
Tertiary education, also known as higher education, refers to the non-compulsory educational levels that follow completion of secondary school or high school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], as well as [[Vocational education|vocational education and training]].  Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.<ref name=":22">{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/education/information/nfsunesco/doc/isced_1997.htm|title=International Standard Classification of EducationI S C E D 1997|date=2017-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319192113/http://www.unesco.org/education/information/nfsunesco/doc/isced_1997.htm|access-date=2020-03-22|archive-date=2017-03-19}}</ref>

==== Undergraduate education ====
Undergraduate education is education conducted after [[secondary education]] and prior to [[post-graduate education]], for which the learner is typically awarded a [[bachelor's degree]].<ref name=":22" />  Students enrolled in higher education programs at [[college]]s, [[University|universities]], and [[community college]]s are often referred to as "college students" in countries such as United States. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

The closure of colleges and universities has widespread individual, organizational, and learning and teaching implications for students, faculty, administrators, and the institutions themselves.<ref name="Aristovnik et al. 2020">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aristovnik A, Keržič D, Ravšelj D, Tomaževič N, Umek L|title = Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Life of Higher Education Students: A Global Perspective| journal = Sustainability | volume = 12 | issue = 20 | pages = 8438 | date = October 2020 | doi=10.3390/su12208438| doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="Crawford et al. 2020b">{{cite journal |last1=Crawford |first1=Joseph |last2=Percy |first2=Alisa |date=2020 |title=JUTLP Editorial 17.3: Connection, digital education, and student-centric teaching practice before COVID-19 |url=https://ro.uow.edu.au/jutlp/vol17/iss3/1/ |journal=Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice |volume=17 |issue=3 |access-date=24 August 2020}}</ref> The initial period of rapid adaption during 2020 contained three primary responses to COVID-19: minimal legal response, delayed commencement of study periods, and rapid digitalization of curriculum.<ref name="Crawford et al. 2020a">{{cite journal |last1=Crawford |first1=Joseph |last2=Butler-Henderson |first2=Kerryn |date=2020 |title=COVID-19: 20 countries' higher education intra-period digital pedagogy responses |url=https://journals.sfu.ca/jalt/index.php/jalt/article/view/191 |journal=Journal of Applied Learning and Teaching |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=9–28 |doi=10.37074/jalt.2020.3.1.7 |access-date=24 August 2020|doi-access=free }}</ref> Thoughts about what to make of this situation resulted in optional learning online or in person depending on what the university declared as being mandatory.<ref>{{Cite web|title=6 Ways Universities Are Responding To Coronavirus|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/06/812462913/6-ways-universities-are-responding-to-coronavirus|access-date=2020-12-08|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref>

Millions of students are expected to defer the start of their studies for their undergraduate degree to a later year due to the pandemic. This not only will negatively affect the future university intake process due to [[Shortage|shortages in places available]] but universities worldwide are expected to lose billions of USD in equivalent due to the number of students expected to study at university in the 2020/2021 academic year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/20/uk-universities-facing-760m-hit-one-in-five-students-plan-defer|title=UK universities facing £760m hit as one in five students plan to defer|date=May 20, 2020|website=the Guardian}}</ref>

Colleges and universities across the United States have been called upon to issue refunds to students for the cost of [[Tuition payments|tuition]] and [[room and board]].<ref name=":23">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/03/21/coronavirus-college-students-online-closing-private-liberal-arts/2889546001/|title=Small colleges were already on the brink.

While $6 billion in emergency relief is to be made available to students during the pandemic, Education Secretary [[Betsy DeVos]] decided on April 21, 2020 that it will only be made available to those students who are also already eligible for federal financial aid. This rule will exclude tens of thousands of undocumented students who participate in the government's [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA, or "Dreamers") program from being able to receive emergency relief funds.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Green|first=Erica L.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/politics/coronavirus-funds-colleges-dreamers.html|title=DeVos Excludes 'Dreamers' From Coronavirus College Relief|date=2020-04-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Apart from colleges losing vast amounts of income<ref>{{Cite web|last=News|first=A. B.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, college students would have in-person classes, in-person office hours, and in-person extracurricular activities. However, the pandemic has created an atmosphere where students who have an idea about their future occupation, are learning essential information behind a screen. These changes have made focusing on classes built around a students selected major very difficult, as they are not experiencing what they are passionate about to the fullest extent.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Is online learning shrinking your attention span?|url=https://www.upbeacon.com/article/2020/09/tips-for-studing-at-home|access-date=2020-12-08|website=The Beacon}}</ref> The result of this is lost passion for specific subjects, the inability to focus on crucial information, and tainted academic integrity all over.

===== Impact on local economies =====
In the United States of America, colleges and universities operate as "mini-cities" which generate significant revenue for cities, states, and regions.<ref name=":24">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-10/college-towns-to-clear-out-with-virus-upending-local-businesses|title=College Towns to Clear Out as Virus Upends Local Businesses|date=2020-03-10|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2020-03-22|language=en}}</ref> For example, [[Princeton University]] estimated in 2017 that it contributed $1.58 billion [[United States dollar|USD]] per year to the [[New Jersey]] economy, and that students spent about $60 million in off-campus spending.<ref name=":24" /> College and university closures have a [[domino effect]] on economies with far-reaching implications.<ref name="fastcompany-economic-impacts" />

In March, [[Linda Bilmes]] of the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Harvard Kennedy School]] noted that "local hotels, restaurants, cafes, shops, car rental agencies and other local businesses obtain a significant share of annual revenue from graduation week and college reunions... these communities will suffer a lot of economic damage if the colleges remain closed at that time."<ref name=":24" />

Small towns which rely on college students to support the local economy and provide labour to local businesses are especially impacted by school closures and the exodus of students from campus.<ref name=":23" /> In [[Ithaca, New York]], [[Cornell University]] students spent at least $4 million a week in [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]]. In the wake of Cornell's decision to keep students home following spring break and transition to virtual instruction, the Mayor of Ithaca called for "immediate and forceful federal action — we will see a horrific economic impact as a result of Cornell University closing."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ithacajournal.com/story/news/local/2020/03/11/economic-impact-ithaca-cornells-closing-coronavirus/5022867002/|title=Loss of Cornell students during coronavirus pandemic could cost Ithaca, Tompkins $4M a week |last=Platsky |first=Jeff | name-list-style = vanc |website=Ithaca Journal|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>

=== UNESCO recommendations ===
UNESCO made ten recommendations for engaging in online learning:

# '''Examine the readiness and choose the most relevant tools:''' Decide on the use high-technology and low-technology solutions based on the reliability of local power supplies, internet connectivity, and digital skills of teachers and students. This could range through integrated digital learning platforms, video lessons, MOOCs, to broadcasting through radios and TVs.
# '''Ensure inclusion of the distance learning programmes:''' Implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes, if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices. Consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity.
# '''Protect data privacy and data security:''' Assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces, as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals. Ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students’ data privacy.
# '''Prioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching:''' Mobilize available tools to connect schools, parents, teachers, and students with each other. Create communities to ensure regular human interactions, enable social caring measures, and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated.
# '''Plan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes:''' Organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students’ knowledge of prior lessons. Plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones, level of studies, needs of students needs, and availability of parents. Choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based quarantines. Avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication.
# '''Provide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools:''' Organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well, if monitoring and facilitation are needed. Help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons.
# '''Blend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms:''' Blend tools or media that are available for most students, both for synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning. Avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms.
# '''Develop distance learning rules and monitor students’ learning process:''' Define the rules with parents and students on distance learning. Design formative questions, tests, or exercises to monitor closely students’ learning process. Try to use tools to support submission of students’ feedback and avoid overloading parents by requesting them to scan and send students’ feedback
# '''Define the duration of distance learning units based on students’ self-regulation skills:''' Keep a coherent timing according to the level of the students’ self-regulation and metacognitive abilities especially for livestreaming classes. Preferably, the unit for primary school students should not be more than 20 minutes, and no longer than 40 minutes for secondary school students. 
# '''Create communities and enhance connection:''' Create communities of teachers, parents, and school managers to address sense of loneliness or helplessness, facilitate sharing of experience and discussion on coping strategies when facing learning difficulties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures|title=How to plan distance learning solutions during temporary schools closures|date=2020-03-06|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>

=== Open Education Community response ===
Open Education community members have shared [[Open educational resources|open educational resources (OER)]] in response to COVID-19, including:

* Commonwealth of Learning created the resource "Keeping the doors of learning open".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Keeping the doors of learning open COVID-19 {{!}} COL|url=https://www.col.org/resources/keeping-doors-learning-open-covid-19|website=www.col.org|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref> The project brings together a curated list of resources for policymakers, school and college administrators, teachers, parents and learners that will assist with student learning during the closure of educational institutions. Most of these are available as OER.
*Community Contributed Open Educational Resources for Teaching and Learning in the COVID-19 Era is a co-created spreadsheet of resources. There are multiple tabs on the spreadsheet providing links to: K-12 (primary / secondary) resources, OER repositories, OER toolkits, student support, online teaching, and more.<ref>{{Cite web|title=COVID-19 Open Education Community Contributed Resources|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iQtZoDphA5XYKHR32zUYJ9imjCh4c1DOfg14MRB7G_I/edit?usp=embed_facebook|website=Google Docs|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref>
