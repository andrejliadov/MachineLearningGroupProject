A '''sneeze guard''', '''sneezeguard''', or '''cough shield''' is an [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] or glass screen designed to protect [[food]] or [[people]] from the exposure to [[respiratory droplet]]s, which are dispensed when [[cough]]ing, [[Sneeze|sneezing]] or even talking. Sneeze guards have been in use in [[restaurant]]s for decades.
