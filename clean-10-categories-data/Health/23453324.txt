==Formation of health policy as stakeholders==
{{See also|Health advocacy|Patient advocacy}}
Patient participation, as it pertains to the formation of health policy, is a process that involves patients as [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]], advisors and shared decision makers. The practice of engaging patients in health  policy originated from the [[consumer advocacy]] movement, which prioritized consumer safety, access to information and public participation in public health programs.<ref name="Souliotis2017">{{Cite journal|last1=Souliotis|first1=Kyriakos|last2=Agapidaki|first2=Eirini|last3=Peppou|first3=Lily Evangelia|date=September 2017|title=Assessing Patient Organization Participation in Health Policy: A Comparative Study in France and Italy|url=http://ijhpm.com/article_3351_82d9af675fe60fb81f41a8bd9d62027a.pdf|journal=International Journal of Health Policy Management|volume=6(x)|issue=1|pages=48–58|doi=10.15171/ijhpm.2017.44|pmid=29325402|pmc=5745867}}</ref> Depending on the context, patient participation in health policy can refer to informed decision making, health advocacy, program development, policy implementation, and evaluation of services.<ref name="Souliotis2017" />&nbsp;Patient participation in health policy can affect many different levels of the health care system. Hospitalized individuals may participate in their own medical care in an effort to make shared decisions. In other areas, patients act as advocates by serving as members of organizational and governmental policy committees.

By providing feedback in the form of survey responses, patients give community health officials and hospital leaders helpful feedback on the perceived quality and accessibility of health care services. Furthermore, patient satisfaction scores from these surveys have become an important metric by which hospitals are evaluated and compared to one another.

Patient participation has driven the development of a variety of health policies, ranging from the expansion of hospital visitation hours to the implementation of patient-centered bedside rounding by hospital medical teams. Patient participation has contributed to improvements in the nurse-to-nurse handoff process by engaging with staff to discuss change-of-shift information at the patient's bedside. Patient participation in care coordination has also lead to the utilization of electronic medical records that patients can access and edit.<ref name=":2" />&nbsp;By engaging with patients and patient advocacy groups, policymakers can support patients to shape public policy. Examples include facilitation of public participation in research, town hall meetings, public information sessions, internet and mobile-based surveys and open comment periods on proposed legislation. Hospitals promote patient participation by empowering patients to serve as advisers and decision makers, including on quality improvement teams, patient safety committees, and family-centered care councils.&nbsp;Similarly, foundations, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies can create funding mechanisms requiring and supporting patient participation in societal decisions and priority setting.

Some aspects of PPI have been seen critically; in addition to those under HTA below, examples of general critical voices include a group of U.S. researchers presenting a framework in 2013 and a young Canadian speaker in 2018.

==In health technology assessment==

Patient participation in [[health technology assessment]] (HTA) is an approach to HTA which aims to include patients in the process of HTA. It is sometimes called consumer or patient engagement or consumer or patient involvement, although in HTA the latter term has been defined to include research into patients' needs, preferences and experiences as well as participation per se.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Patients' perspectives in HTA: A route to robust evidence and fair deliberation | journal= International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | pages=334–340 |date=  2010 |doi=10.1017/S0266462310000395  | pmid= 20584364 |first1=Karen    |last1= Facey |first2= Antoine   |last2= Boivin  |first3= Javier  |last3=Gracia  |first4=Helle P    |last4= Hansen   |first5= Alessandra. |last5=  Los Scalzo  |first6= Jean |last6=  Mossman | first7= Ann |last7= Single | volume=26| issue= 3 }}</ref> In HTA, patient participation is also often used to include the participation of patient groups, patient advocates, and patients' families and carers in the process.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Involvement of consumers in health technology assessment activities by INAHTA agencies| journal= International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | pages=79–83 |date=  2013 |doi=10.1017/S026646231200075X  | pmid= 23217279 | url=  http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2285&context=eispapers |first1=David    |last1= Hailey |first2= Sophie   |last2= Werkö  |first3= Rugayah  |last3=Bakri  |first4=Alun    |last4= Cameron   |first5=Britta |last5=  Göhlen|first6= Susan |last6=  Myles |first7= Jasmine |last7= Pwu | first8= Jomkwan |last8= Yothasamut| volume=29| issue= 1 }}</ref>

As HTA aims to help healthcare funders, such as governments, make decisions about [[health policy]], it often involves the question as to whether to use broadly defined health "technologies", and if so, how and when; then patients comprise a key stakeholder in the HTA process. Additionally, because HTA seeks to assess if a heath technology produces useful outcomes for patients in real world settings (clinical effectiveness) that are good value for money (cost effectiveness), understanding patients' needs, preferences and experiences is essential.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Patients' perspectives in HTA: A route to robust evidence and fair deliberation | journal= International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | pages=334–340 |date=  2010 |doi= 10.1017/S0266462310000395  | pmid= 20584364 |first1=Karen    |last1= Facey |first2= Antoine   |last2= Boivin  |first3= Javier  |last3=Gracia  |first4=Helle P    |last4= Hansen   |first5= Alessandra. |last5=  Los Scalzo |first6= Jean |last6=  Mossman |first7= Ann |last7= Single | volume=26| issue= 3 }}</ref>

When patients take part in HTA, their knowledge gained from living with a condition and using treatments and services can add value to an HTA.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Patients' perspectives can be integrated in health technology assessments: an exploratory analysis of CADTH Common Drug Review|date=  2016 | url=  https://researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.118/s40900-016-0036-9?site=researchinvolvement.biomedcentral.com |first1=Sarah    |last1= Berglas |first2= Lauren   |last2= Jutai  |first3= Gail  |last3=MacKean  |first4=Laura    |last4= Weeks   |journal= Research Involvement and Engagement |volume= 2 |pages= 21 |doi= 10.1186/s40900-016-0036-9 |pmid= 29062521 |pmc= 5611639 }} (Open Access)</ref> Sometimes they are called experience-based experts or lay experts.<ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com">{{cite journal |title=Involving patients in health technology funding decisions: stakeholder perspectives on processes used in Australia |journal=Health Expectations  |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=331–344 |date=2015 |first1= Edilene |last1= Lopes |first2= Jackie |last2= Street |first3= Drew |last3= Carter |first4= Tracy |last4= Merlin |doi=10.1111/hex.12356|pmid=25703958 |pmc=5055264 }} (Open Access)</ref>

===Approaches===

In 2017, a book was published on patient involvement in HTA (Eds Facey KM, Hansen HP, Single ANV) bringing together research, approaches, methods and case studies prepared by 80 authors.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811040672|title=Patient Involvement in Health Technology Assessment|editor1=Facey, Karen|editor2=Ploug Hansen, Helle|editor3=Single, Ann|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789811040672|year=2017}}</ref> It demonstrates that practices vary between HTA bodies, and patients can potentially contribute at every stage of an HTA from scoping the questions asked about the health technology, providing input, interpreting the evidence, and drafting and communicating recommendations. It suggests that patient participation in HTA depends on two-way communication and is a dialogue for shared learning and problem solving. The approach taken should be driven by the goal of participation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Supporting quality public and patient engagement in health system organizations: Development and usability testing of the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation Tool | journal= Health Expectations | date=  2015 |doi= 10.1111/hex.12378  | first1=Julia    |last1= Abelson |first2= Sarah E   |last2= Boesveld   |first3= Kathy K  |last3=Li | pmc=5152717 | pmid=26113295 | volume=19 | issue= 4 | pages=817–27}} {{Open Access}}</ref>
The most common way that patients take part in HTA is by providing written submissions and participating in expert meetings (for example as an equal member of an expert group or by attending an expert meeting to present information and answer questions).<ref>{{cite journal |title= Good Practice Examples of Patient and Public Involvement in Health Technology Assessment (a living document)| year=2015|last1= Health Technology Assessment international (HTAi)| url= https://www.htai.org/fileadmin/HTAi_Files/ISG/PatientInvolvement/EffectiveInvolvement/Good_Practice_Examples_Feb_2015.pdf  }}</ref>

===Limitations and criticism ===

Although patient participation has been adopted and developed by a variety of HTA bodies around the world, there are limitations and criticisms of its use. These include concern about how and when to involve patients,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Patient involvement in health technology assessment in Europe – results of the EPF survey| journal= European Patients Forum |date=  2013 | url=  http://www.eu-patient.eu/globalassets/projects/hta/hta-epf-final-report2013.pdf }} (Open Access)</ref> the burden of participation for patients, representativeness of patients, the potential for conflict of interest (in relation to patient groups receiving funding from manufacturers), and lack of evaluation of patient participation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Involvement of consumers in health technology assessment activities by INAHTA agencies| journal= International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care | pages=79–83 |date=  2013 |doi=10.1017/S026646231200075X  | pmid= 23217279 | url=  http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2285&context=eispapers |first1=David    |last1= Hailey |first2= Sophie   |last2= Werkö   |first3= Rugayah  |last3=Bakri   |first4=Alun    |last4= Cameron   |first5=Britta |last5=  Göhlen| first6= Susan |last6=  Myles  |first7= Jasmine |last7= Pwu | first8= Jomkwan |last8= Yothasamut| volume=29| issue= 1 }}</ref> Facey et al. (2017) published the book on patient involvement in HTA to establish consistent terminology in the field and demonstrate a range of recognised approaches and methods found in published literature. Authors also highlighted the challenges of evaluation, rapid (short HTAs) and the problem of HTA bodies confusing patient input (information provided by patients and patient groups taking part in HTA) with patient-based evidence (robust research into patients' needs, preferences and experiences). The book itself is not open access, but the lead editor also published a paper on the topic six years before the larger collection.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Patient involvement in HTA: What added value?|journal=Pharmaceuticals, Policy and Law |volume=13 |issue=3,4 |pages=245–251 |date=2011 |first1= Karen |last1= Facey|doi=10.3233/PPL-2011-0329}} (Open Access)</ref> 
One of the issues for patient participation in HTA is that HTA has often been constructed as a scientific process which must remain free from the subjective input of patients. 
Likewise, Gauvin et al. report that their "analysis reveals that HTA agencies' role as bridges or boundary organizations situated at the frontier of research and policymaking causes the agencies to struggle with the idea of public involvement" (page 1518).<ref>{{cite journal |title=  'It all depends': Conceptualizing public involvement in the context of health technology assessment agencies | journal= Social Science & Medicine | pages=1518–1526 |date=  2010 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.01.036  | pmid= 20207061 |first1=Francois-Pierre    |last1= Gauvin |first2= Julia   |last2= Abelson   |first3= Mita |last3=Giacomini  |first4=John    |last4= Eyles   |first5= John N. |last5=  Lavis | volume=70| issue= 10 }}</ref>

However, HTA would be better understood as a policy tool which critically reviews scientific evidence for a local context and this review is shaped by those involved in the process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Facey|first1=Karen|last2=Boivin|first2=Antoine|last3=Gracia|first3=Javier|last4=Hansen|first4=Helle Ploug|last5=Scalzo|first5=Alessandra Lo|last6=Mossman|first6=Jean|last7=Single|first7=Ann|date=2010|title=Patients' perspectives in health technology assessment: A route to robust evidence and fair deliberation|journal=International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care|volume=26|issue=3|pages=334–340|doi=10.1017/s0266462310000395|pmid=20584364|issn=1471-6348}}</ref> There are many ways that public participation in HTA, including patients, can be implemented. In fact, an entire "typology of issues" has been developed by Gauvin et al., in which each type is "related to the most appropriate public involvement methods". Facey (2017) built on this work in Chapter 5 to describe it in detail for patient participation in HTA.

Sociologist Andrew Webster sees the problem as "a failure to recognise that evaluation is a contested terrain involving different sorts of evidence related to different sorts of context (such as the ''experimental'' derived from clinical trials, ''evidential'', derived from existing clinical practice, and ''experiential'', based on patients' experiences of an intervention".<ref>Webster, Andrew: Evaluation, governance and moves to a socially robust assessment of health technology, Working Paper 34, York, 2006, page 8,</ref>

A further issue for patient participation in HTA is that of the individual versus the group. The HTAi's list available for endorsement on values for patient involvement express this issue as 'involvement ... contributes to equity by seeking to understand the diverse needs of patients with a particular health issue, balanced against the requirements of a health system that seeks to distribute resources fairly amongst all users'.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Values and Standards for Patient Involvement in HTA  | url= https://www.htai.org/interest-groups/patient-and-citizen-involvement/pcig-home/values-and-standards }}</ref>

Kelly et al. explain (with their original citations shown here in brackets): "From the moment Archie Cochrane linked questions of clinical effectiveness to cost effectiveness [17] and cost utility analysis was chosen as the basis for assessing value for money, [Evidence-Based Medicine] EBM and HTA have been framed within the utilitarian philosophical tradition. Utilitarianism is premised on the view that actions are good insofar as they maximize benefit for the greatest number [51]. This is not necessarily congruent with what is in the best interest of an individual patient [34]."<ref>{{cite journal |title=The importance of values in evidence-based medicine |journal=BMC Medical Ethics |pages=16:69 |date=2015 |first1= Michael P. |last1= Kelly| first2=Kelly Iona| last2=Heath | first3 =Jeremy |last3=Howick| first4=Trisha | last4=Greenhalgh| doi=10.1186/s12910-015-0063-3 |pmid=26459219 |pmc=4603687 | volume=16|issue=1 }} (Open Access)</ref>

In the United States there are several trends emerging with potential international implications: [[Health 2.0]],  [[artificial intelligence in healthcare]] (AI), the role of entrepreneurs, the value of patient participation in precision medicine and mobile health or [[MHealth]], which will be dealt with in greater detail below.

In Israel, a multicenter study at eight fertility units located in hospitals across the country found that unit directors are familiar with the patient-centered care approach and in general support it.   Nonetheless, interviews with the unit directors revealed that, despite the importance of involving a mental health professional in the care of fertility patients, only some of the units have a social worker or psychologist on their permanent staff.   The study also included a survey of 524 patients.  These patients were asked to rate the units where they were treated on a scale of 0-3.  Scores ranged from 1.85 to 2.49, with an average of 2.0, compared with the average score of 2.2 given by staff members.  The difference was statistically significant.  There were also statistically significant differences in the scores across the various dimensions of patient-centered care, according to the patients’ socioeconomic background.  In particular, the patients gave their lowest ratings to the emotional support dimension, while the staff members believed that the emotional support they provided stood out as a positive aspect of their work.<ref>Tamar Medina Artom, Bat-Sheva Hass, and Lev Zhivaev.

{{See also|Shared decision-making|Artificial intelligence in healthcare}}

Prior to the recent advances in technology, patient participation was limited to&nbsp;[[Shared decision-making in medicine|shared decision making]]&nbsp;(SDM), a form of participation that occurred specifically between a patient and their physician in clinical practice, but can be regarded as a step forward.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S2213-2600(18)30075-4 | pmid= 29508703| title= Regressing or progressing: What next for the doctor–patient relationship?| journal= The Lancet Respiratory Medicine| volume= 6| issue= 3| pages= 178–180| year= 2018| last1= Harrison| first1= Natalie| doi-access= free}}</ref>  Changes in modern technology now allow computers to play an increasingly important role in healthcare decision making. Examples of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that is being used in healthcare include IBM's Watson Health, which is intended to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of difficult illnesses or disease.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ibm-and-mit-partner-on-240m-ai-lab/504725/|title=IBM and MIT partner on $240M AI lab|work=Healthcare Dive|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en-US}}</ref>&nbsp;One of the Watson's objectives is to highlighting findings developed by Watson's computing skills and access to everyday information and give concrete suggestions that are tailored to the expertise of the physician, type of ailment, and needed level of care.&nbsp;Physicians can use ailment specific programs such as the Watson for Oncology app, which is aimed at the detection and treatment of tumors. Artificial intelligence is being used more frequently in patient participatory healthcare.

== Role of entrepreneurship ==
Entrepreneurs have led the challenge to conventional health thinking since Craig Venter took on the NIH with the&nbsp;[[1000 Genomes Project]]&nbsp;in 2008. Mike Milken, another entrepreneur and stock trader, founded the Santa Monica, California based Milken Institute. Following the institute's inception, Milken launched the Fastercures program, which "brings together patient advocates, researchers, investors and policymakers from every sector of the medical research and development system to eliminate the roadblocks that get in the way of a faster cure".&nbsp;The Fastercures program proposes patient-center improvements and advancements in the modern healthcare arena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2011/06/16/lessons-from-aidshiv-advocacy-efforts/|title=Lessons From AIDS/HIV Advocacy Efforts|last=Marcus|first=Amy Dockser|date=2011-06-16|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-30}}</ref>

In 2010, the U.S. Government boosted patient participation by launching its own&nbsp;[[Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute]]. PCORI is striving to systematize its evaluation metrics to prove where results show improvement.&nbsp;PCORI was created by provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The 501(c) organization has faced a great deal of scrutiny over funding, specifically when it was revealed PCORI was funded by a new tax originating from the Affordable Care Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/patient-centered-outcomes-research-institute-fee|title=Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute Fee {{!}} Internal Revenue Service|website=www.irs.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}</ref>

== Precision medicine ==
Four years after the spectacular [[1000 Genomes Project]] hoped to call in a new era of [[precision medicine]] (PM), some opinion leaders have spoken up for reassessing the value of patient participation to be seen as a driver of PM. The Chancellor of the University of California, San Francisco, for instance, wrote an editorial in ''[[Science Translational Medicine]]'' calling for  an amendment to the social contract to boost patient participation, citing a historical precedent: "We need only look back to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS epidemic during the 1980s to experience the power of patient advocacy combined with the dogged pursuit of scientific discovery and translation; clearly, motivated patients and scientists as well as their advocates can influence political, scientific, and regulatory agendas to drive advances in health."<ref name=Desmond-Hellmann-2012>{{cite journal |last1=Desmond-Hellmann |first1=Susan  |title=Toward precision medicine: A new social contract? |journal=Science Translational Medicine |volume=4 |issue=129 |page=129ed3 |department=Editorial |date=11 April 2012 |doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3003473 |pmid=22496543  |s2cid=41137820 }}</ref>

In 2011 a seminal{{peacock term|date=September 2017}} paper on the topic came out written by Hood and Friend.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hood |first1=Leroy |last2=Friend |first2=Stephen H. |title=Predictive, personalized, preventive, participatory (P4) cancer medicine |journal=Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=184–187 |date=March 2011 |doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2010.227 |pmid=21364692 |s2cid=9074524 }}</ref>

A second success story is that of the patient John W. Walsh, who founded Alphanet, which has funnelled tens of millions of dollars into research on [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] or COPD.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Roberts |first1=Sam |title=John W.

=== Clinical trials ===

In the US, trends in patient participation have been influenced by a variety of sources and previous political movements. One such source for patient participation in clinical research was the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s. During the epidemic, the AIDS activists argued not only for new clinical trial models, but for the importance of additional social service groups to support a wider range of potential human subjects.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/1881|title=The Social Impact of AIDS in the United States|last=Council|first=National Research|date=1969-12-31|isbn=9780309046282|doi=10.17226/1881|pmid=25121219}}</ref> Since then, the FDA has taken several steps to include patients earlier in the drug development process.

In the US, the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) was created in 2003 which includes a registry for patients afflicted with a rare-disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/|title=Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN)|website=www.rarediseasesnetwork.org|access-date=2017-09-17}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=Orphan drugs : understanding the rare disease market and its dynamics|last=Elizabeth.|first=Hernberg-Ståhl|date=2013|publisher=WP, Woodhead Publishing|others=Reljanović, Miroslav.|isbn=9781908818393|location=Oxford|oclc=867555228}}</ref> This registry provides information to the patients and allows physicians to contact potential patients for enrollment in clinical trials.<ref name=":4" /> "Patient registry" is a developing term, and this 2013 open-access book provides a comprehensive description of the trend toward registries and their networks, i.e. the "broader research collaboratives that connect individual registries".<ref>{{cite book |author=TA Workman |date=2013 |chapter=Defining Patient Registries and Research Networks |title=Engaging Patients in Information Sharing and Data Collection: The Role of Patient-Powered Registries and Research Networks |location=Rockville MD |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK164514/#top |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK164514/}}</ref> Organizations such as the [https://www.npcqic.org National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative] have generated significant improvements in clinical outcomes through a commitment to co-creation of research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Jeffrey B.|last2=Beekman|first2=Robert H.|last3=Kugler|first3=John D.|last4=Rosenthal|first4=Geoffrey L.|last5=Jenkins|first5=Kathy J.|last6=Klitzner|first6=Thomas S.|last7=Martin|first7=Gerard R.|last8=Neish|first8=Steven R.|last9=Brown|first9=David W.|date=2015|title=Improvement in Interstage Survival in a National Pediatric Cardiology Learning Network|journal=Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=428–436|doi=10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.115.001956|pmid=26058717|issn=1941-7713|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Patients have a new resource to help them navigate the clinical trials landscape and find understandable summaries of medical research in the OpenTrials database launched by the [[AllTrials]] campaign in 2016 as part of [[open data]] in medicine.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goldacre |first1=Ben |last2=Gray |first2=Jonathan |title=OpenTrials: towards a collaborative open database of all available information on all clinical trials |date=8 April 2016 |journal=Trials |volume=17 |page=164 |doi=10.1186/s13063-016-1290-8 |pmid=27056367 |pmc=4825083 |doi-access=free }} {{Open access}}</ref>

Precision medicine will change the conduct of clinical trials, and thus the role of patients as subjects. "Key to making precision medicine mainstream is the ongoing shift in the relationship between patients and physicians" comments N.J. Schork from the Venter Institute in ''Nature''. He cites as reasons for this development a growing interest in 'omics' assays and cheap and efficient devices that collect health data.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schork |first1=Nicholas J.  |title=Personalized medicine: Time for one-person trials |journal=Nature |volume=520 |issue=7549 |date=29 April 2015 |pages=609–611 |doi=10.1038/520609a |pmid=25925459  |doi-access=free |bibcode=2015Natur.520..609S }}</ref> Newer articles in ''Nature'' outline the conditions with which patent participation can be optimized.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wagner |first1=Jennifer K. |last2=Peltz-Rauchman |first2=Cathryn |last3=Rahm |first3=Alanna K. |last4=Johnson |first4=Christine C. |title=Precision engagement: the PMI's success will depend on more than genomes and big data |journal=Genetics in Medicine |volume=19 |issue=6 |year=2017 |pages=620–624 |doi=10.1038/gim.2016.165 |pmid=27787499 |pmc=5555824 }}</ref>
