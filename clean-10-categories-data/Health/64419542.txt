== Career ==
Cassadore has been a food educator for the past 25 years, launching a project called the Western Apache Diet Project to interview tribal elders and popularize traditional foods such as acorn and grass seeds.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Food Sovereignty Stories|url=https://gather.film/|access-date=2020-06-29|website=Gather Film|language=English}}</ref> She interviewed over 100 tribal elders, ultimately helping to identify more than 200 traditional Apache edible plants and nearly as many traditional Apache recipes for a database funded with a 2013 grant of $37,500 by the First Nations’ Native Agriculture and Food Systems Initiative.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Hernandez|first=Sarah|date=2014-11-17|title=Western Apache {{!}} indiangiver|url=http://indiangiver.firstnations.org/tag/western-apache/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-30|website=|language=en-US}}</ref> 

Limited access to foods with high nutritional content and sedentary lifestyles are linked to health problems in the Western Apache population, including high levels of obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease; substance abuse, domestic violence, and suicide are also prevalent.<ref name=":2" /> Cassadore has spoken about struggling with addiction and mental health crises in her own life, including suicide attempts, prior to beginning her career as a food educator.<ref name=":0" /> She notes that many of the tribal youth she works with have similarly experienced trauma, saying, "I was sexually assaulted before I even attended kindergarten. This is something we never will talk about. Many on the rez have gone through this.”<ref name=":0" /> Cassadore has stated that foraging helped her heal.<ref name=":0" /> In a seminar on the Western Apache Diet Project, she said, "I have been drug-free since 2002. And reconnecting with myself and my identity was done through harvesting. And harvesting some of these food in the locations that were my ancestors are from, the clan maps of where some of these places we’ve gone to and reconnecting with who I am and it rooted me back to where I came from. It gave me a sense of purpose."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Indian Health Service Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention|first=|date=|title=Advancements in Diabetes Seminar|url=https://www.ihs.gov/sites/diabetes/themes/responsive2017/display_objects/documents/training_seminars/Transcript_ApacheDiet.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

One component of Cassadore's foraging includes leading hunts for the ''gloscho'' ([[desert woodrat]]), hunts that were in the past led only by men.<ref name=":0" /> The San Carlos Apache Culture Center Museum, the Natural Resources Apache Foods Program, and the Apache Tradition and Culture group sponsored a hunt in March 2020 open to the public.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jan 22|first=Posted|last2=2019|title=Traditional Apache pack rat hunting and cooking|url=https://silverbelt.com/article/traditional-apache-pack-rat-hunting-and-cooking|access-date=2020-06-30|website=Silver Belt}}</ref>
