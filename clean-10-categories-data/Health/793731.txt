Dr. '''Jerri Lin Nielsen''' (née Cahill; March 1, 1952 – June 23, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] with extensive [[emergency room]] experience, who self-treated her breast cancer while stationed at [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] in [[Antarctica]] until she could be evacuated safely.

In 1998, during the southern [[winter]], at a time when the station is physically cut off from the rest of the world, she developed [[breast cancer]]. Nielsen teleconferenced with medical personnel in the United States and had to [[self-surgery|operate on herself]] in order to extract tissue samples for analysis. A military plane was later dispatched to the pole to airdrop equipment and medications. Her condition remained life-threatening, and the first plane to land at the station in the spring was sent several weeks earlier than planned, despite adverse weather conditions, to take her to the U.S. as soon as possible. Her ordeal attracted a great amount of attention from the media, and Nielsen later wrote an autobiographical book recounting her story.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/us/25nielsen.html "Jerri FitzGerald, Who Treated Herself at South Pole, Dies at 57"] [[New York Times]], June 24, 2009</ref>
 
The cancer went into remission, but recurred seven years later, eventually causing her death in 2009 from brain metastatic disease, eleven years after initial diagnosis.

==Early life and education==
Born as Jerri Lin Cahill in [[Salem, Ohio]] on March 1, 1952, a suburb of [[Youngstown|Youngstown, Ohio]], Nielsen was the oldest child and only daughter of Philip and Lorine Cahill, who raised their family in a rural area just outside Salem. She graduated pre-med from [[Ohio University]] in Athens before entering the [[University of Toledo College of Medicine and Life Sciences|Medical College of Ohio]] in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and graduating with a medical degree.

While at Ohio University she also met Jay Nielsen, who she subsequently married. They had three children before divorcing acrimoniously in 1998. She continued to work as a physician in various medical fields, mostly as an ER surgeon.

==Antarctic stay==

In 1998, Nielsen was hired for a one-year contract to serve as the medical doctor at the Amundsen-Scott [[South Pole]] Station on Antarctica. This isolated region experiences [[Polar night|almost total darkness]] for the six months of winter, during which the temperature remains around &minus;60&nbsp;°C (&minus;76&nbsp;°F).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/weather/climate/antarctica-south-pole.htm |title=South Pole, Antarctica |date=May 20, 2005|access-date=November 22, 2008 |publisher=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> During this period, the station is completely cut off from the world, as no planes fly there between mid-February and late October. The "winterover" crew is thus stranded and entirely autonomous.

In the course of her work at the research station, Nielsen discovered a lump in her breast. After consulting US physicians via e-mail and video conference, she performed a [[biopsy]] upon herself. The results were, however, inconclusive, because the material used on site was too outdated to allow for a precise diagnosis.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The [[National Science Foundation]] decided to send a military plane to airdrop supplies and medication for her treatment. Such airdrops had been a yearly event several years earlier, when the station was run by the [[US Navy]], but had later been stopped. The plane did not attempt a landing because its skis would risk sticking to the ice and its fuel and hydraulic lines would rapidly freeze, dooming the craft. South Pole workers lit fires in barrels in the Antarctic night to mark out a drop zone. An Air Force [[C-141]] cargo plane, staged out of [[Christchurch]], overflew the Pole in the darkness of mid-July and sent six bundles of supplies and medical equipment parachuting toward the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/pastIssues/1999-2000/1999_10_24.pdf|title=The Antarctic Sun, October 24, 1999 |publisher=[[The Antarctic Sun]]}}</ref>

Using the parachuted supplies, Nielsen began her treatment, following the advice of her doctors over the satellite link. She first began a hormone treatment. She trained her South Pole colleagues to form a small team that could assist her in the procedures. A new biopsy performed with the airdropped equipment allowed better scans to be sent to the US, where it was confirmed that the cells were indeed cancerous.<ref name="nsb">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationwidespeakers.com/speaker/164/dr-jerri-nielsen/incredible-story-of-survival-at-the-south-pole |title=Dr. Jerri Nielsen - Incredible Story of Survival at The South Pole |publisher=Nationwide Speakers Bureau |access-date=November 22, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120090023/http://nationwidespeakers.com/speaker/164/dr-jerri-nielsen/incredible-story-of-survival-at-the-south-pole |archive-date=January 20, 2009 }}</ref> With the help of her makeshift medical team, Nielsen then began self-administering [[chemotherapy]].<ref name="nsb" />

In October, a [[LC-130]] Hercules was sent several weeks ahead of schedule, despite the risks inherent to flying in such cold weather, to bring Nielsen back home as soon as possible; the plane took off from the base on October 15. Another crew member, who had suffered a hip injury during the winter, was also evacuated.

==After returning to the United States==
Once back in the United States, after multiple surgeries, complications and a [[mastectomy]],<ref>[https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200603/the-explorer-jerri-nielsen "The Explorer: Jerri Nielsen"], ''[[Psychology Today]]'', March 1, 2006</ref> Nielsen went into remission. She became a motivational speaker<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox17.com/newsroom/special_reports/vid_15.shtml |title=Dr Jerri Nielsen |access-date=November 22, 2008 |publisher=[[WZTV]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616231126/http://www.fox17.com/newsroom/special_reports/vid_15.shtml |archive-date=June 16, 2008 }}</ref> and a scholarship was created in her honor;<ref name="blade" /> she also remarried, to Tom Fitzgerald. In 2001, Nielsen was named [[Irish Americans|Irish American]] of the Year by [[Irish America magazine|''Irish America'' magazine]].

==Metastasis==
After being in remission, the cancer returned in 2005 and [[metastasis|metastasized]] to Nielsen's brain, liver and bones, but she continued to give speeches and traveled extensively including to Hong Kong, Vietnam, Australia, Ireland, Alaska, Poland, and she returned to Antarctica several times. In October 2008, Dr. Nielsen announced that her cancer had returned in the form of a [[brain tumor]].<ref name="blade">{{cite web |url=http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081018/NEWS32/810180342 |title=South Pole doctor says cancer spread |date=October 18, 2008 |access-date=November 22, 2008 |publisher=[[The Blade (Toledo)|The Blade]] |author=Julie M.

==Media depictions==
With [[ghostwriter]] [[Maryanne Vollers]], Nielsen's story was told in the autobiographical ''[[Ice Bound|Ice Bound: A Doctor's Incredible Story of Survival at the South Pole]]'', which became a ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller. The book was later adapted into ''[[Ice Bound: A Woman's Survival at the South Pole]]'', a 2003 [[CBS]]-TV movie starring [[Susan Sarandon]],<ref>{{imdb title|id=0352426|title=Ice Bound}}</ref> and in 2008 became the inspiration for an episode of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] show ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', "[[Frozen (House episode)|Frozen]]", in which the team must somehow, via teleconference, diagnose and treat a stricken psychiatrist at the South Pole. The story of her rescue would be featured on [[The Weather Channel]]'s ''[[When Weather Changed History]]'' in the "Rescue from the South Pole" in January 2008.

Nielsen's case shares some similarities with that of Dr. [[Leonid Rogozov]], who had to remove his own [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] while spending the winter at [[Novolazarevskaya Station|Novolazarevskaya research station]] in 1961. Since this incident, that station has always been staffed with two doctors.
