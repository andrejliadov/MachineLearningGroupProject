{{Abortion in the Catholic Church}}

In 2009, a 9-year-old girl was forcibly impregnated by her Stepfather; the girl's mother helped her procure an abortion. The twin pregnancy was terminated. Archbishop [[José Cardoso Sobrinho|José Sobrinho]] affirmed that the girl's mother and the doctors who performed the abortion had been automatically excommunicated under Canon Law. This prompted an array of national and international criticism for the Archbishop's actions. In response, the [[National Conference of Bishops of Brazil]] declared that no one was excommunicated in the case, and in an article published on ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' a Vatican bioethicist rebuked the archbishop for the girls dad public statement.

;Canon law
The [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Code of Canon Law]] says that automatic excommunication is imposed on "a person who procures a completed abortion" ([[Canon 1398]]), but not if, for instance, the act was done "by a person who was coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience unless the act is intrinsically evil or tends to the harm of souls".<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4W.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1323 §4]</ref>

==The abortion==
Doctors in [[Recife]] performed an abortion on the nine-year-old girl on 4 March 2009. They judged her life to be at risk because of her age and because she was pregnant with twins and weighed 80 pounds. According to Fatima Maia, the director of the hospital CISAM, if the pregnancy continued, the child could suffer a [[uterine rupture|ruptured uterus]] and [[gynecologic hemorrhage|hemorrhage]], and she also ran the risk of [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[eclampsia]] and [[infertility|lifelong sterility]].<ref>[http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,equipe-medica-excomungada-diz-que-nao-esta-arrependida,334543,0.htm “Equipe médica excomungada diz que não está arrependida”Estadão, 06 March 2009]</ref> She had allegedly been raped by her stepfather.<ref>[http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1883598,00.html Nine-Year-Old's Abortion Outrages Brazil's Catholic Church], ''Time'', 6 Mar. 2009</ref>

== Sobrinho's view and actions ==
As well as expressly denying that he had excommunicated anyone, but had only said that excommunication had been automatically incurred,<ref>[https://expresso.sapo.pt/menina-violada-abortou-e-a-mae-foi-excomungada-toda-a-polemica=f502990 ''Expresso'',"Menina violada abortou e a mãe foi excomungada: Toda a polémica", 14 March 2009]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://noticias.cancaonova.com/bispo-esclarece-que-aborto-e-causa-de-excomunhao-automatica/ |title="Bispo esclarece que aborto é causa de excomunhão automática" (interview granted to ''Canção Nova''", 5 March 2009 |access-date=16 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221212946/http://noticias.cancaonova.com/bispo-esclarece-que-aborto-e-causa-de-excomunhao-automatica/ |archive-date=21 February 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rainhamaria.com.br/Pagina/6529/Arcebispo-nao-dei-excomunhao-a-lei-da-Igreja-pune-quem-faz-aborto/imprimir=true "Arcebispo: não dei excomunhão; a lei da Igreja pune quem faz aborto" (interview granted to ''Terra Magazine'')]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.quadrante.com.br/artigos_detalhes.asp?id=289&cat=4&pagina=1 |title=Francisco Faus, "A menina, o aborto e a excomunhão" |access-date=16 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222141248/http://www.quadrante.com.br/artigos_detalhes.asp?id=289&cat=4&pagina=1 |archive-date=22 February 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Sobrinho said that "the law of God is higher than any human laws.

== Government reaction ==
President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], a Catholic, criticized what he called the "conservative attitude" of the Archbishop in a case where the doctors were trying to save the girl's life, adding: "In this case, the medical profession was more right than the Church."<ref name=Brazil2/><ref name="cnn"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Lula 'rues' Church abortion move|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7929712.stm|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=6 March 2009}}</ref>

== Church hierarchy's view ==
===National Conference of Bishops of Brazil===
The National Conference of Bishops of Brazil repudiated Sobrinho's initiative.<ref name=ESP>{{Cite news|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,cnbb-desautoriza-iniciativa-de-bispo,338133,0.htm |title=CNBB desautoriza iniciativa de bispo |first=Luciana |last=Nunes Leal |date=13 March 2009 |work=O Estadão de S.Paulo |accessdate=13 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223153757/http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso%2Ccnbb-desautoriza-iniciativa-de-bispo%2C338133%2C0.htm |archivedate=23 February 2014 }}</ref> At a press conference, Bishop [[Dimas Lara Barbosa]], Secretary General of the Conference, said that the girl's mother was not excommunicated, since she had acted under pressure to save her daughter's life, and that there were no grounds to declare the doctors excommunicated, because (automatic) excommunication depended on each one's degree of awareness and only those who were "aware and contumacious" were excommunicated.<ref name=ESP/><ref name=Globo/> At the press conference, a document on excommunication written by canonist Enrique Pérez Pujol, who stressed that the penalty should not be applied amid a polemic, was distributed to journalists.<ref name=ESP/>

[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mariana|Archbishop Geraldo Lyrio Rocha]], President of the Conference, avoided answering a question whether Sobrinho had acted hastily in saying that automatic excommunication had occurred. He said that "at no time did he want to hurt someone who was already hurting, but only wished to draw attention to the gravity of the deed of abortion in the face of a certain permissiveness regarding the life of the unborn". He said that Sobrinho had excommunicated no one, but had pointed out that abortion entails the possibility of excommunication, which is a measure intended to make not only an individual but the whole Church community take note of the gravity of the deed. As for the rapist, he said that a rapist "is outside of communion" and "in grave [[mortal sin]]", even though rape is not listed among the crimes that give rise to automatic excommunication. He said: "Rape is something so repugnant that the Church does not need to call attention to it. It is punished by the state justice system, which does not punish abortion so much." He said that talk of excommunication seemed to have made people forget the crime of the rapist, who needed to be punished.<ref name=ESP/><ref name=Globo>{{cite news |last= Bresciani|first=Eduardo|title=Para CNBB, ninguém foi excomungado em caso de aborto de menina de 9 anos |url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Brasil/0,,MUL1040654-5598,00-PARA+CNBB+NINGUEM+FOI+EXCOMUNGADO+EM+CASO+DE+ABORTO+DE+MENINA+DE+ANOS.html |accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=O Globo |date=12 March 2009}}</ref>

===Rino Fisichella===
The Holy See's non-official newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', published a front-page article on 15 March by Archbishop [[Rino Fisichella]], President of the [[Pontifical Academy for Life]], that was highly critical of Sobrinho's action.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Top Vatican ethicist says abortion saved life of nine-year-old rape victim |date=21 April 2009|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2009-04/top-vatican-ethicist-says-abortion-saved-life-nine-year-old-rape-victim|work=The Christian Century |accessdate=13 February 2014}}</ref> Fisichella said that excommunication was automatic, so that focusing on it rather than on helping and supporting the child victim showed a lack of compassion that detracted from the credibility of the Church's anti-abortion teaching.<ref name="obrien">{{Cite book |title=The Church and Abortion: A Catholic Dissent |first=George Dennis |last=O'Brien |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYBUE1ZZNA4C&pg=PA86 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=2010}}</ref><ref name="mines">{{Cite news |work=L'Espresso |url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1337637?eng=y |date=23 March 2009|title=Drifting Mines.

The [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] responded to press coverage of Fisichella's article calling it manipulation and exploitation. It issued a clarification that the article did not signal a change of doctrine and said that "the Church's teaching on procured abortion has not changed, nor can it change".<ref name="obrien"/><ref name=CDF>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20090711_aborto-procurato_en.html Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, "Clarification on procured abortion"]</ref><ref>[http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1339277?eng=y The Holy Office Teaches Archbishop Fisichella a Lesson]</ref> The clergy of the Archdiocese of Olinda and Recife took issue with Fisichella, stating that the local Church had been supportive of the girl and her mother.<ref name="mines"/> The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ruled that Sobrinho had acted "with all pastoral solicitude".<ref name="obrien"/><ref name=CDF/> The members of the Academy gave Fisichella a vote of no confidence because of his article, and he was reassigned in the next year to the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://ncronline.org/news/vatican/vatican-academy-mulls-how-pro-life-pro-life-enough |first=John L. |last=Allen Jr. |title=Vatican academy mulls how pro-life is pro-life enough |date=30 May 2012|work=National Catholic Reporter}}</ref>

===Others===
Cardinal [[Giovanni Battista Re]], Prefect of the [[Congregation for Bishops]] and President of the [[Pontifical Commission for Latin America]], deplored what he called an attack on the Church in Brazil: "It is a sad case, but the real problem is that the twins conceived were two innocent persons, who had the right to live and could not be eliminated. Life must always be protected. The attack on the Brazilian church is unjustified." He added that excommunication of those who performed the abortion was just.<ref name=Brazil2/>

[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Gap|Bishop Jean-Michel di Falco]] of [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap, France]], criticized what he saw as the un-Christlike nature of Sobrinho's statement. He said that bishops should act as pastors rather than executioners. As had the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil, he denied the applicability of Canon 1398 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] to the girl's mother, because such an automatic excommunication does not apply to someone who acts out of grave fear.<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-20441?l=french Mgr di FALCO, évêque de Gap, sur l'excommunication au Brésil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316160505/http://www.zenit.org/article-20441?l=french |date=16 March 2012 }}</ref>

== Other reactions ==
On 9 March 2009, Health Minister [[José Gomes Temporão|Temporão]] interrupted the opening ceremony of a national medical convention on women's health in Brasília in order to compliment Dr. Olímpio Moraes, one of the doctors who carried out the abortion and who was in attendance. Participants gave Moraes a standing ovation.<ref name="cnn"/><ref name=DP/>

Moraes expressed gratitude to Sobrinho for the excommunication, which, he said, had drawn attention to Brazil's restrictive abortion laws. Another of the doctors involved said that he will continue attending [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]], "praying, conversing with God, and asking him to illuminate me and my colleagues in our medical team to help us take care of people in similar cases."<ref name="cnn"/>

The United Nations [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]], in its January 2014 assessment of the [[Concluding observations on the second periodic report of the Holy See|Holy See's compliance]] with the U.N. [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], cited this Brazil case. It "urge[d] the Holy See to review its position on abortion which places obvious risks on the life and health of pregnant girls and to amend Canon 1398 relating to abortion with a view to identifying circumstances under which access to abortion services can be permitted."<ref>Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights: [http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/_layouts/treatybodyexternal/Download.aspx?symbolno=CRC%2FC%2FVAT%2FCO%2F2&Lang=en Concluding observations on the second periodic report of the Holy See, 31 January 2014], retrieved 8 February 2014</ref>
