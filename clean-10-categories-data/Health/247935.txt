'''Aircraft [[noise pollution]]''' refers to noise produced by aircraft in flight that has been associated with several negative stress-mediated health effects, from sleep disorders to cardiovascular ones.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nassur|first=Ali-Mohamed|last2=Léger|first2=Damien|last3=Lefèvre|first3=Marie|last4=Elbaz|first4=Maxime|last5=Mietlicki|first5=Fanny|last6=Nguyen|first6=Philippe|last7=Ribeiro|first7=Carlos|last8=Sineau|first8=Matthieu|last9=Laumon|first9=Bernard|last10=Evrard|first10=Anne-Sophie|date=2019|title=Effects of Aircraft Noise Exposure on Heart Rate during Sleep in the Population Living Near Airports|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30669300|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=16|issue=2|doi=10.3390/ijerph16020269|issn=1660-4601|pmc=6352139|pmid=30669300}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Basner|first=Mathias|last2=McGuire|first2=Sarah|date=2018|title=WHO Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European Region: A Systematic Review on Environmental Noise and Effects on Sleep|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29538344|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=15|issue=3|doi=10.3390/ijerph15030519|issn=1660-4601|pmc=5877064|pmid=29538344}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baudin|first=Clémence|last2=Lefèvre|first2=Marie|last3=Champelovier|first3=Patricia|last4=Lambert|first4=Jacques|last5=Laumon|first5=Bernard|last6=Evrard|first6=Anne-Sophie|date=2018|title=Aircraft Noise and Psychological Ill-Health: The Results of a Cross-Sectional Study in France|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30081458|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=15|issue=8|doi=10.3390/ijerph15081642|issn=1660-4601|pmc=6121613|pmid=30081458}}</ref> Governments have enacted extensive controls that apply to aircraft designers, manufacturers, and operators, resulting in improved procedures and cuts in pollution.

Sound production is divided into three categories:

* Mechanical noise—rotation of the engine parts, most noticeable when fan blades reach supersonic speeds.
* Aerodynamic noise—from the airflow around the surfaces of the aircraft, especially when flying low at high speeds.
* Noise from aircraft systems—cockpit and cabin pressurization and conditioning systems, and Auxiliary Power units.

==Mechanisms of sound production==
[[File:Propeller of QantasLink (VH-QOP) Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 at the Canberra Airport open day.jpg|thumb|upright|Noise-generating [[aircraft propeller]]]]

Aircraft noise is [[noise pollution]] produced by an aircraft or its components, whether on the ground while parked such as auxiliary power units, while taxiing, on run-up from propeller and jet exhaust, during take off, underneath and lateral to departure and arrival paths, over-flying while en route, or during landing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} A moving aircraft including the [[jet engine]] or [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] causes compression and rarefaction of the air, producing motion of air molecules. This movement propagates through the air as pressure waves. If these pressure waves are strong enough and within the audible [[frequency]] spectrum, a sensation of hearing is produced. Different aircraft types have different noise levels and frequencies. The noise originates from three main sources:

* Engine and other mechanical noise
* Aerodynamic noise
* Noise from aircraft systems

===Engine and other mechanical noise===
[[Image:Noise Research Program on Hangar Apron - GPN-2000-001457.jpg|thumb|upright|[[NASA]] researchers at [[Glenn Research Center]] conducting tests on [[jet engine]] noise in 1967]]
Much of the noise in propeller aircraft comes equally from the propellers and aerodynamics. Helicopter noise is aerodynamically induced noise from the main and tail rotors and mechanically induced noise from the main gearbox and various transmission chains. The mechanical sources produce narrow band high intensity peaks relating to the rotational speed and movement of the moving parts. In [[computer model]]ling terms noise from a moving aircraft can be treated as a [[line source]].

Aircraft gas turbine engines ([[jet engine]]s) are responsible for much of the aircraft noise during takeoff and climb, such as the ''buzzsaw noise'' generated when the tips of the fan blades reach supersonic speeds. However, with advances in noise reduction technologies—the airframe is typically more noisy during landing.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The majority of engine noise is due to jet noise—although high bypass-ratio [[turbofan]]s do have considerable fan noise. The high velocity jet leaving the back of the engine has an inherent shear layer instability (if not thick enough) and rolls up into ring vortices. This later breaks down into turbulence. The SPL associated with engine noise is proportional to the jet speed (to a high power). Therefore, even modest reductions in exhaust velocity will produce a large reduction in jet noise.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Engines are the main source of aircraft noise.<!--<ref name=AvWeek18dec2017>--> The geared [[Pratt & Whitney PW1000G]] helped reduce the noise levels of the [[Bombardier CSeries]], [[Mitsubishi MRJ]] and [[Embraer E-Jet E2]] crossover [[narrowbody aircraft]]: the gearbox allows the fan to spin at an optimal speed, which is one third the speed of the LP turbine, for slower fan tip speeds. It has a 75% smaller noise footprint than current equivalents.<!--<ref name=AvWeek18dec2017>--> The [[PowerJet SaM146]] in the [[Sukhoi Superjet 100]] features 3D [[aerodynamic]] fan blades and a [[nacelle]] with a long [[Exhaust mixer|mixed duct flow]] nozzle to reduce noise.<ref name=AvWeek18dec2017>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/crossover-narrowbody-jets/how-crossover-jets-are-meeting-noise-challenge |title= How Crossover Jets Are Meeting The Noise Challenge |date= Dec 18, 2017 |author= Bernie Baldwin |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>

===Aerodynamic noise===
[[File:Boeing 747 main landing gear.jpg|thumb|Deployed [[landing gear]] and [[wing flap]]s of a 747]]

Aerodynamic noise arises from the airflow around the aircraft [[fuselage]] and control surfaces. This type of noise increases with aircraft speed and also at low altitudes due to the density of the air. Jet-powered aircraft create intense noise from [[aerodynamic]]s. Low-flying, high-speed military aircraft produce especially loud aerodynamic noise.

The shape of the nose, windshield or [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] of an aircraft affects the sound produced. Much of the noise of a propeller aircraft is of aerodynamic origin due to the flow of air around the blades. The [[helicopter]] main and tail rotors also give rise to aerodynamic noise. This type of aerodynamic noise is mostly low frequency determined by the rotor speed.

Typically noise is generated when flow passes an object on the aircraft, for example, the wings or landing gear. There are broadly two main types of airframe noise:

* Bluff Body Noise – the alternating vortex shedding from either side of a [[bluff body]], creates low-pressure regions (at the core of the shed vortices) which manifest themselves as pressure waves (or sound). The separated flow around the bluff body is quite unstable, and the flow "rolls up" into ring vortices—which later break down into turbulence.<ref name="bluff">{{cite web|url=http://www2.eng.cam.ac.uk/~acf40/research_ov.htm |title=Aircraft Airframe Noise—Research Overview |accessdate=2008-07-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517104120/http://www2.eng.cam.ac.uk/~acf40/research_ov.htm |archive-date=2008-05-17 }}</ref>
* Edge Noise – when turbulent flow passes the end of an object or gaps in a structure (high lift device clearance gaps) the associated fluctuations in pressure are heard as the sound propagates from the edge of the object (radially downwards).<ref name="bluff"/>

===Noise from aircraft systems===
[[File:787 - Flickr - Beige Alert (4).jpg|thumb|The [[Auxiliary Power Unit|APU]] exhaust on a [[Boeing 787]] tail, with intake panel open]]

[[Cockpit]] and cabin [[pressurization]] and conditioning systems are often a major contributor within cabins of both civilian and military aircraft. However, one of the most significant sources of cabin noise from commercial jet aircraft, other than the engines, is the [[Auxiliary Power Unit]] (APU), an on‑board [[Electric generator|generator]] used in aircraft to start the main engines, usually with [[compressed air]], and to provide electrical power while the aircraft is on the ground. Other internal aircraft systems can also contribute, such as specialized electronic equipment in some military aircraft.

==Health effects==
[[File:Joint Readiness Training Center 140116-F-XL333-018.jpg|thumb|Aircraft [[marshaller]]s wearing [[hearing protection]]]]

{{Further|Health effects from noise}}
Aircraft engines are the major source of [[Environmental noise|noise]] and can exceed 140 decibels (dB) during takeoff. While airborne, the main sources of noise are the engines and the high speed turbulence over the fuselage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aircrew/noise.html|title=AIRCREW SAFETY & HEALTH|last=NIOSH|date=May 9, 2017|access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref>

There are [[health]] consequences of elevated [[Sound exposure level|sound level]]s.  Elevated workplace or other [[noise]] can cause [[hearing impairment]], [[hypertension]], [[ischemic heart disease]], [[annoyance]], [[sleep disturbance]], and decreased school performance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Peters|first1=Junenette L.|last2=Zevitas|first2=Christopher D.|last3=Redline|first3=Susan|last4=Hastings|first4=Aaron|last5=Sizov|first5=Natalia|last6=Hart|first6=Jaime E.|last7=Levy|first7=Jonathan I.|last8=Roof|first8=Christopher J.|last9=Wellenius|first9=Gregory A.|date=2018-04-26|title=Aviation Noise and Cardiovascular Health in the United States: a Review of the Evidence and Recommendations for Research Direction|journal=Current Epidemiology Reports|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=140–152|doi=10.1007/s40471-018-0151-2|pmid=30505645|pmc=6261366|issn=2196-2995}}</ref> Although some hearing loss occurs naturally with age,<ref name="Rosenhall1990">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosenhall U, Pedersen K, Svanborg A |title=Presbycusis and noise-induced hearing loss |journal=Ear Hear |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=257–63 |year=1990 |pmid=2210099 |doi=10.1097/00003446-199008000-00002}}</ref> in many developed nations the impact of noise is sufficient to impair hearing over the course of a lifetime.<ref name="Schmid">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/18/ap/health/mainD8NC00AO0.shtml |last=Schmid |first=RE |title=Aging nation faces growing hearing loss |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2007-02-18 |accessdate=2007-02-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115131020/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/18/ap/health/mainD8NC00AO0.shtml |archive-date=November 15, 2007 }}</ref><ref>Senate Public Works Committee, ''[[Noise Pollution and Abatement Act]] of 1972'', S.

===German environmental study===
A large-scale statistical analysis of the health effects of aircraft noise was undertaken in the late 2000s by Bernhard Greiser for the [[Umweltbundesamt]], Germany's central environmental office. The health data of over one million residents around the Cologne airport were analysed for health effects correlating with aircraft noise. The results were then corrected for other noise influences in the residential areas, and for socioeconomic factors, to reduce possible skewing of the data.<ref name="Tödlicher Lärm' 2009, Page 45">''Tödlicher Lärm''—[[Spiegel (magazine)|Spiegel]]'', Nr. 51, 14 Dezember 2009, Page 45 {{in lang|de}}</ref>

The German study concluded that aircraft noise clearly and significantly impairs health.<ref name="Tödlicher Lärm' 2009, Page 45"/> For example, a day-time average sound pressure level of 60 [[decibels]] increasing coronary heart disease by 61% in men and 80% in women. As another indicator, a night-time average sound pressure level of 55 [[decibels]] increased the risk of heart attacks by 66% in men and 139% in women. Statistically significant health effects did however start as early as from an average sound pressure level of 40 [[decibels]].<ref name="Tödlicher Lärm' 2009, Page 45"/>

===FAA advice===
The Federal Aviation Administration ([[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]) regulates the maximum noise level that individual civil aircraft can emit through requiring aircraft to meet certain noise certification standards. These standards designate changes in maximum noise level requirements by "stage" designation. The U.S. noise standards are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 36 – Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification (14 CFR Part 36). The FAA says that a maximum day-night average sound level of 65&nbsp;dB is incompatible with residential communities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Noise Monitoring|url=http://www.massport.com/environment/environmental-reporting/noise-abatement/noise-monitoring/|publisher=Massport|accessdate=31 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232122/http://www.massport.com/environment/environmental-reporting/noise-abatement/noise-monitoring/|archive-date=2014-02-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> Communities in affected areas may be eligible for mitigation such as soundproofing.

===Cabin noise===
[[File:A220 Main Cabin (43799968340).jpg|thumb|Typical passenger [[aircraft cabin]]]]

Aircraft noise also affects people within the aircraft: crew and passengers. Cabin noise can be studied to address the [[occupational exposure]] and the health and safety of pilots and flight attendants. In 1998, 64 commercial airline pilots were surveyed regarding [[hearing loss]] and [[tinnitus]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Begault|first1=Durand R.|last2=Wenzel|first2=Elizabeth M.|last3=Tran|first3=Laura L.|last4=Anderson|first4=Mark R.|date=February 1998|title=Survey of Commercial Airline Pilots' Hearing Loss|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|language=en|volume=86|issue=1|pages=258|doi=10.2466/pms.1998.86.1.258|pmid=9530744|s2cid=24928181|issn=0031-5125}}</ref> In 1999, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] conducted several noise surveys and health hazard evaluations, and found [[Ambient noise level|noise levels]] exceeding its recommended [[noise exposure|exposure]] limit of 85 [[A-weighted]] decibels as an 8-hr [[Time-weighted average (PEL)|TWA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/reports/pdfs/1999-0060-2766.pdf|title=Health Hazard Evaluation report: Continental Express Airlines, Newark, New Jersey|last=NIOSH|date=1999|access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref> In 2006, the noise levels inside an Airbus A321 during cruise have been reported as approximately 78&nbsp;dB(A) and during taxi when the aircraft engines are producing minimal thrust, noise levels in the cabin have been recorded at 65&nbsp;dB(A).<ref>{{cite journal |author1= Ozcan HK |author2=Nemlioglu S |url= https://jcaa.caa-aca.ca/index.php/jcaa/article/download/1854/1601 |title= In-cabin noise levels during commercial aircraft flights |journal= Canadian Acoustics |volume= 34 |number= 4 |date= 2006}}</ref> In 2008, a study of Swedish airlines cabin crews found average sound levels between 78–84&nbsp;dB(A) with maximum A-weighted exposure of 114&nbsp;dB but found no major hearing threshold shifts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lindgren|first1=Torsten|last2=Wieslander|first2=Gunilla|last3=Nordquist|first3=Tobias|last4=Dammström|first4=Bo-Göran|last5=Norbäck|first5=Dan|date=2008-10-30|title=Hearing status among cabin crew in a Swedish commercial airline company|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|language=en|volume=82|issue=7|pages=887–892|doi=10.1007/s00420-008-0372-7|pmid=18972126|s2cid=29612085|issn=0340-0131}}</ref> In 2018, a study of sound levels measured on 200 flights representing six aircraft groups found media noise level of 83.5 db(A) with levels reaching 110&nbsp;dB(A) on certain flights, but only 4.5% exceeded the NIOSH recommended 8-hr TWA of 85&nbsp;dB(A).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zevitas|first1=Christopher D.|last2=Spengler|first2=John D.|last3=Jones|first3=Byron|last4=McNeely|first4=Eileen|last5=Coull|first5=Brent|last6=Cao|first6=Xiaodong|last7=Loo|first7=Sin Ming|last8=Hard|first8=Anna-Kate|last9=Allen|first9=Joseph G.|date=2018-03-15|title=Assessment of noise in the airplane cabin environment|journal=Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology|volume=28|issue=6|pages=568–578|language=En|doi=10.1038/s41370-018-0027-z|pmid=29545611|s2cid=3917183|issn=1559-0631}}</ref>

===Cognitive effects===

Simulated aircraft noise at 65&nbsp;dB(A) has been shown to negatively affect individuals’ memory and recall of auditory information.<ref>Molesworth BR, Burgess M. (2013). Improving intelligibility at a safety critical point: In flight cabin safety. Safety Science, 51, 11–16.</ref> In one study comparing the effect of aircraft noise to the effect of alcohol on cognitive performance, it was found that simulated aircraft noise at 65&nbsp;dB(A) had the same effect on individuals’ ability to recall auditory information as being intoxicated with a Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) level of at 0.10.<ref>Molesworth BR, Burgess M, Gunnell B. (2013). Using the effect of alcohol as a comparison to illustrate the detrimental effects of noise on performance. Noise & Health, 15, 367–373.</ref> A BAC of 0.10 is double the legal limit required to operate a motor vehicle in many developed countries such as Australia.

==Mitigation programs==
{{see also|Noise mitigation}}
[[File:Amtek 2block2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Insulated glazing]] provides [[noise mitigation]]]]

In the United States, since aviation noise became a public issue in the late 1960s, governments have enacted legislative controls. Aircraft designers, manufacturers, and operators have developed quieter aircraft and better operating procedures. Modern high-bypass [[turbofan]] engines, for example, are quieter than the [[turbojet]]s and low-bypass turbofans of the 1960s. First, FAA Aircraft Certification achieved noise reductions classified as "Stage&nbsp;3" aircraft; which has been upgraded to "Stage&nbsp;4" noise certification resulting in quieter aircraft. This has resulted in lower noise exposures in spite of increased traffic growth and popularity.<ref name="Stage 4 Aircraft Noise Standards">{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFinalRule.nsf/0/767f48f6311bfa348625703700522b0b!OpenDocument |title=Stage 4 Aircraft Noise Standards |publisher=Rgl.faa.gov |accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref>

In the 1980s the [[U.S. Congress]] authorized the [[FAA]] to devise programs to insulate homes near airports. While this does not address the external noise, the program has been effective for residential interiors. Some of the first airports at which the technology was applied were [[San Francisco International Airport]] and [[San Jose International Airport]] in California. A computer model is used which simulates the effects of aircraft noise upon building structures. Variations of aircraft type, flight patterns and local [[meteorology]] can be studied. Then the benefits of building retrofit strategies such as roof upgrading, window [[insulated glazing|glazing]] improvement, fireplace baffling, [[caulking]] construction seams can be evaluated.<ref name="Hogan">Hogan, C.

===Night flying restrictions===
At [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[Stansted Airport|Stansted]] airports in [[London]], UK and [[Frankfurt Airport]] in Germany, [[night flying restrictions]] apply to reduce noise exposure at night.<ref name="DFT">{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/press/speechesstatements/statements/nightflyingrestrictionsathea5940 |title=Night flying restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Airports |accessdate=2008-07-12 |last=Dept for Transport |date=June 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717055137/http://www.dft.gov.uk/press/speechesstatements/statements/nightflyingrestrictionsathea5940 |archive-date=July 17, 2007 }}</ref><ref name="DFT2">{{cite web|url = http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/archive/2005/nrheahtgatst/nightrestrictionsatheathrowg1775?page=19|title =Night restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted (second stage consultation)|accessdate = 2008-07-12|last = Dept for Transport|year = n.d.}}</ref>

=== Satellite-based navigation systems ===
A series of trials were undertaken at London's Heathrow Airport, between December 2013 and November 2014, as part of the UK's "Future Airspace Strategy", and the Europe-wide "[[Single European Sky]]" modernisation project. The trials demonstrated that using satellite-based navigation systems it was possible to offer noise relief to more surrounding communities, although this led to a significant unexpected rise in noise complaints (61,650 <ref>Anderson Acoustics, [https://www.heathrow.com/file_source/HeathrowNoise/Static/Noise_impacts_Community_Response_easterly_and_westerly_trials_2014.pdf Westerly And Easterly Departure Trials 2014 - Noise Analysis & Community Response], retrieved 29 November 2017</ref>) due to the concentrated flight paths. The study found that steeper angles for take-off and landing led to fewer people experiencing aircraft noise and that noise relief could be shared by using more precise flight paths, allowing control of the noise footprint of departing aircraft. Noise relief could be enhanced by switching flight paths, for example by using one flight path in the morning and another in the afternoon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrow.com/noise/future-plans/modernising-uk-airspace|title=Modernising UK airspace|work=heathrow.com|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref>

The ability to reduce noise may be limited if engines remain below aircraft's wings. NASA expects a cumulative 20–30&nbsp;dB below Stage 4 limits by 2026–2031, but keeping aircraft noise within [[airport]] boundaries requires at least a 40–50&nbsp;dB reduction.<!--<ref name=AvWeek6may2016/>--> [[Landing gear]], [[wing slat]]s and [[wing flap]]s also produce noise and may have to be shielded from the ground with new configurations.<!--<ref name=AvWeek6may2016/>--> NASA found over-wing and mid-fuselage nacelles could reduce noise by 30–40&nbsp;dB, even 40–50&nbsp;dB for [[hybrid wing body]] which may be essential for open rotors.<ref name="AvWeek6may2016" />

By 2020, [[helicopter]] technologies now in development, plus new procedures could reduce noise levels by 10&nbsp;dB and noise footprints by 50%, but more advances are needed to preserve or expand [[heliport]]s.<!--<ref name=AvWeek6may2016/>--> Package delivery [[Unmanned aircraft system|UAS]] will need to characterize their noise, establish limits and reduce their impact.<ref name=AvWeek6may2016>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/technology-milestones/problems-aerospace-still-has-solve |title= Problems Aerospace Still Has To Solve |date= May 6, 2016 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>
