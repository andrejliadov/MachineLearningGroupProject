One author describes the syndromes of chronic testicular pain thus:<blockquote>"The complaint is of a squeezing deep ache in the testis like the day after you got kicked there, often bilateral or alternating from one side to the other, intermittent, and, most commonly, associated with lower back pain.  Sometimes it feels like the testicle is pinched in the crotch of the underwear but trouser readjustment does not help.  There may also be pain in the [[Inguinal canal|inguinal]] area but no nausea or other symptoms.  Back pain may be concurrent or absent and some patients have a long history of low back pain.  Onset of pain is commonly related to activity that would stress the low back such as lifting heavy objects.  Other stresses that might cause low back pain are imaginative coital positions, jogging, sitting hunched over a computer, long car driving, or other such positions of unsupported seating posture that flattens the normal lumbar [[lordosis]] curve."<ref name=baran>{{Cite book|title=Urogenital pain in clinical practice|last=Granitisioti|first=P.|editor1-last=Baranowski|editor1-first=Andrew Paul |editor2-last=Abrams|editor2-first=Paul|editor3-last=Fall|editor3-first=Magnus|chapter=Scrotal pain conditions|year=2008|publisher=Informa Healthcare USA|place=New York|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGA5vzK3V4cC&pg=PA238&dq=%22chronic+epididymitis%22#q=%22chronic%20epididymitis%22|isbn=978-0849399329}}</ref>{{rp|p.237}}</blockquote>

==Differential diagnosis==
* [[Post-vasectomy pain syndrome]]

==Diagnosis==
Testing for [[gonorrhea]] and [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] should be routinely performed.<ref name=PC2010/>

==Treatment==
Treatment is often with [[NSAIDs]] and [[antibiotics]] however, this  is not always effective.<ref name=PC2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wampler SM, Llanes M |title=Common scrotal and testicular problems |journal=Prim.
