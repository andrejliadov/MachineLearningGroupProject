'''Aceso''' ({{lang-el|Ἀκεσώ}}) was the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] goddess of the healing process.<ref>[http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/AsklepiasAkeso.html Aceso], on Theoi</ref> 

== Family ==
Aceso was the daughter of [[Asclepius]] and [[Epione]], sister of [[Iaso]], [[Hygieia]], [[Panacea (Greek mythology)|Panacea]], and [[Aegle (mythology)|Aegle]].<ref>''Suidas s.v. Epione (trans. Suda On Line) (Byzantine Greek Lexicon C10th A.D.)''</ref>

== Mythology ==
Unlike her sister Panacea (Cure-All) she represented the process of a curing rather than the cure itself. Her male counterpart was Acesis (Akesis).<ref>Nigel Guy Wilson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-aFtPdh6-2QC&pg=PA335&dq=Aceso+%22Aegle%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uKgCT8e8BJDUsgaPlITWDw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Aceso%20%22Aegle%22&f=false ''Encyclopedia of ancient Greece''], Routledge, 2005, p.335</ref> In Greek sculptural reliefs, Aceso appears alongside her father Asclepius and sisters Hygeia, Panacea and Iaso.
