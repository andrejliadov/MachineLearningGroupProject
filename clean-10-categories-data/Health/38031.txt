'''Hazardous waste''' is [[waste]] that has substantial or potential threats to [[public health]] or the [[natural environment|environment]].<ref name=RCRA>{{cite web|title=Resources Conservation and Recovery Act|url=http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/lrca.html#Solid%20Wastes|publisher=US EPA}}</ref>  

*Characteristic hazardous wastes are materials that are known or tested to exhibit one or more of the following hazardous traits:
**[[Flammability|Ignitability]]
**[[Reagent|Reactivity]]
**[[Corrosive substance|Corrosivity]]
**[[Poison|Toxicity]]<!-- Explosive, carcinogenic, and radioactive characteristics contained in previous definitions are subsets of these four primary characteristics -->
*Listed hazardous wastes are materials specifically listed by regulatory authorities as hazardous wastes which are from non-specific sources, specific sources, or [[discarded chemical products]].<ref>[[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations|40 CFR]], 261.31 through .33</ref>

Hazardous wastes may be found in different physical states such as gaseous, liquids, or solids. A hazardous waste is a special type of waste because it cannot be disposed of by common means like other by-products of our everyday lives. Depending on the physical state of the waste, treatment and solidification processes might be required.

The international community has defined the responsible management of hazardous waste and chemicals as an important part of developing a sustainable economy with [[Sustainable Development Goal 12]]. Target 12.4 measures two indicators to "achieve the environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle".<ref>United Nations (2017) Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017, [[:File:A RES 71 313 E.pdf|Work of the Statistical Commission pertaining to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] ([https://undocs.org/A/RES/71/313 A/RES/71/313])</ref>

==Worldwide==
Worldwide, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) estimated that more than 400 million tons of hazardous wastes are produced universally each year, mostly by industrialized countries (Schmit, 1999). About 1 percent of this is shipped across international boundaries, with the majority of the transfers occurring between countries in the Organization for the Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (Krueger, 1999).<ref name="Orloff, Kenneth 2003">{{cite journal |doi=10.1078/1438-4639-00225 |pmid=12971684 |title=An international perspective on hazardous waste practices |year=2003 |last1=Orloff |first1=Kenneth |last2=Falk |first2=Henry |journal=International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health |volume=206 |issue=4–5 |pages=291–302 }}</ref> One of the reasons for industrialized countries to ship the hazardous waste to industrializing countries for disposal is the rising cost of disposing of hazardous waste in the home country.<ref name="Orloff, Kenneth 2003"/>

=== In the United States ===

====Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)====
Hazardous wastes are wastes with properties that make them dangerous or potentially harmful to human health or the environment. Hazardous wastes can be liquids, solids, contained gases, or sludges. They can be by-products of manufacturing processes or simply discarded commercial products, like cleaning fluids or pesticides. In regulatory terms, RCRA hazardous wastes are  wastes that appear on one of the four hazardous wastes lists (F-list, K-list, P-list, or U-list), or exhibit at least one of the following four characteristics; ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity. in the US, Hazardous wastes are regulated under the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act|Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)]], Subtitle C.<ref>Horinko, Marianne, Cathryn Courtin. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/rcra.pdf “Waste Management: A Half Century of Progress.”] EPA Alumni Association. March 2016.</ref>

By definition, EPA determined that some specific wastes are hazardous. These wastes are incorporated into lists published by the Agency. These lists are organized into three categories: F-list (non-specific source wastes) found in the regulations at 40 CFR 261.31, K-list (source-specific wastes) found in the regulations at 40 CFR 261.32, and P-list and the U-list (discarded commercial chemical products) found in the regulations at 40 CFR 261.33.

RCRA's record keeping system helps to track the life cycle of hazardous waste and reduces the amount of hazardous waste illegally disposed.

==== Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ====

The [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act]] (CERCLA), was enacted in 1980.  The primary contribution of CERCLA was to create a "[[Superfund]]" and provide for the clean-up and remediation of closed and abandoned hazardous waste sites. CERCLA addresses historic releases of hazardous materials, but does not specifically manage hazardous wastes.

== Hazardous waste in the U.S.==
{{main article | Hazardous waste in the United States}}

In the United States, the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste are regulated under the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]]  (RCRA).  Hazardous wastes are defined under RCRA in 40 CFR 261 where they are divided into two major categories: characteristic wastes and listed wastes.<ref>40 CFR 261</ref>

The requirements of the RCRA apply to all the companies that generate hazardous waste as well as those companies that store or dispose  hazardous waste in the United States. Many types of businesses generate hazardous waste. [[Dry cleaning|dry cleaners]], [[automobile]] repair shops, hospitals, [[pest (organism)|exterminators]], and [[photo processing]] centers may all generate hazardous waste. Some hazardous waste generators are larger companies such as chemical [[manufacturer]]s, [[electroplating]] companies, and [[oil refinery|oil refineries]].

A U.S. facility that treats, stores, or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a permit for doing so under the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]]. Generators and transporters of hazardous waste must meet specific requirements for handling, managing, and tracking waste. Through the RCRA, Congress directed the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create regulations to manage hazardous waste. Under this mandate, the EPA developed strict requirements for all aspects of hazardous waste management including the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste. In addition to these federal requirements, states may develop more stringent requirements that are broader in scope than the federal regulations.  Furthermore, RCRA allows states to develop regulatory programs that are at least as stringent as RCRA and, after review by EPA, the states may take over responsibility for the implementation of the requirements under RCRA.  Most states take advantage of this authority, implementing their own hazardous waste programs that are at least as stringent, and in some cases are more stringent than the federal program.

===Hazardous Waste Mapping Systems===
The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] provides several tools for mapping hazardous wastes to particular locations. These tools also allow the user to view additional information.

*[[TOXMAP]] was a [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) service from the [http://sis.nlm.nih.gov Division of Specialized Information Services] of the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) that used maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Research Program|Superfund Basic Research Program]]. This resource was funded by the US Federal Government. TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information was taken from NLM's [http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET)], [[PubMed]], and other authoritative sources.
*The [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) "Where You Live" [http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/where.htm] allows users to select a region from a map to find information about [[Superfund]] sites in that region.

== Universal wastes ==

[[Universal waste]]s are a special category of hazardous wastes that (in the U.S.):

* generally pose a lower threat relative to other hazardous wastes are ubiquitous and produced in very large quantities by a large number of generators.

Some of the most common "universal wastes" are: [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent light bulbs]], some specialty [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] (e.g. lithium or lead containing batteries), [[cathode ray tube]]s, and mercury-containing devices.

Universal wastes are subject to somewhat less stringent regulatory requirements. Small quantity generators of universal wastes may be classified as "conditionally exempt small quantity generators" (CESQGs) which release them from some of the regulatory requirements for the handling and storage hazardous wastes.

Universal wastes must still be disposed of properly.  (For more information, see [http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/generation/sqg/handbook/cesqg.pdf Overview of Requirements for Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators])

== Household hazardous waste ==

Household Hazardous Waste (HHW), also referred to as domestic hazardous waste or home generated special materials, is a waste that is generated from residential households. HHW only applies to waste coming from the use of materials that are labeled for and sold for "home use".  Waste generated by a company or at an industrial setting is not HHW.

The following list includes categories often applied to HHW.  It is important to note that many of these categories overlap and that many household wastes can fall into multiple categories:

* [[Paint]]s and [[solvent]]s
* Automotive wastes (used [[motor oil]], [[antifreeze]], etc.)
* Pesticides ([[insecticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, etc.)
* [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]-containing wastes ([[thermometer]]s, [[switch]]es, [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]], etc.)
* Electronics ([[computer]]s, [[television]]s, [[cell phone]]s)
* Aerosols / Propane cylinders
* Caustics / Cleaning agents
* [[Refrigerant]]-containing appliances
* Some specialty [[battery (electricity)|batteries]]  (e.g. lithium, nickel cadmium, or button cell batteries)
* Ammunition
* [[Asbestos]]
* Car batteries
* [[Radioactive wastes]] (some home [[smoke detector]]s are classified as radioactive waste because they contain very small amounts of radioactive [[isotope]] [[americium]] - see: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070414142357/http://www.mcmua.com/HazardousWaste/FAQ_Smoke_Detectors.htm Disposing of Smoke Detectors]).

==Disposal of hazardous waste==
Historically, some hazardous wastes were disposed of in regular [[landfills]]. This resulted in unfavorable amounts of hazardous materials seeping into the ground. These chemicals eventually entered to natural [[hydrologic]] systems. Many landfills now require countermeasures against groundwater contamination. For example, a barrier has to be installed along the foundation of the landfill to contain the hazardous substances that may remain in the disposed waste.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2006.01.065 |pmid=16530943 |title=Factors affecting hazardous waste solidification/Stabilization: A review |year=2006 |last1=Malviya |first1=Rachana |last2=Chaudhary |first2=Rubina |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |volume=137 |pages=267–276 }}</ref> Currently, hazardous wastes must often be stabilized and solidified in order to enter a landfill and must undergo different treatments in order to stabilize and dispose of them. Most flammable materials can be recycled into industrial fuel. Some materials with hazardous constituents can be recycled, such as lead acid batteries.

===Recycling===
[[File:Recycling Video.webm|thumb|right|Recycling Video]]
Some hazardous wastes can be recycled into new products.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VitdgXrB7JcC&pg=PA131 |title=GCSE Applied Business for Edexcel: Double Award|last=Carysforth|first=Carol|last2=Neild|first2=Mike|date=2002|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=9780435447205|language=en}}</ref> Examples may include [[lead-acid batteries]] or [[electronic circuit board]]s. When [[heavy metals]] in these types of ashes go through the proper treatment, they could bind to other pollutants and convert them into easier-to-dispose solids, or they could be used as pavement filling. Such treatments reduce the level of threat of harmful chemicals, like fly and [[bottom ash]],{{Citation needed|reason=No description for fly ash or bottom ash|date=August 2011}} while also recycling the safe product. There is a recycling center facility in [[Oxnard, CA]]. The city does not charge for any hazardous materials being disposed of, but there is a limit to how much you can bring per month. Other than hazardous waste, the city also allows you to dispose of electronic waste, light-bulbs, and batteries.<ref>“Government.” City Of Oxnard, www.oxnard.org/household-hazardous-waste/.</ref>

===Portland cement===
[[File:Portland Cement Bags.jpg|thumb|right|Portland Cement Bags]]
Another commonly used treatment is cement-based [[Remediation of contaminated sites with cement|solidification and stabilization]]. [[Cement]] is used because it can treat a range of hazardous wastes by improving physical characteristics and decreasing the toxicity and transmission of contaminants. The cement produced is categorized into 5 different divisions, depending on its strength and  components. This process of converting sludge into cement might include the addition of pH adjustment agents, phosphates, or sulfur reagents to reduce the settling or curing time, increase the compressive strength, or reduce the leach ability of contaminants.

=== Incineration, destruction and waste-to-energy ===
Hazardous waste may be "destroyed". For example, by [[incinerating]] them at a high temperature, flammable wastes can sometimes be burned as energy sources. For example, many [[cement kiln]]s burn hazardous wastes like used oils or solvents. Today, incineration treatments not only reduce the amount of hazardous waste, but also generate energy from the gases released in the process. It is known that this particular waste treatment releases toxic gases produced by the combustion of byproduct or other materials which can affect the environment. However, current technology has developed more efficient incinerator units that control these emissions to a point where this treatment is considered a more beneficial option.  There are different types of incinerators which vary depending on the characteristics of the waste. Starved air incineration is another method used to treat hazardous wastes. Just like in common incineration, burning occurs, however controlling the amount of oxygen allowed proves to be significant to reduce the amount of harmful byproducts produced. Starved air incineration is an improvement of the traditional incinerators in terms of air pollution. Using this technology, it is possible to control the combustion rate of the waste and therefore reduce the air pollutants produced in the process.

===Hazardous waste landfill (sequestering, isolation, etc.)===
Hazardous waste may be sequestered in an hazardous waste landfill  or permanent disposal facility. "In terms of hazardous waste, a landfill is defined as a disposal facility or part of a facility where hazardous waste is placed or on land and which is not a pile, a land treatment facility, a surface impoundment, an underground injection well, a salt dome formation, a salt bed formation, an underground mine, a cave, or a corrective action management unit (40 CFR 260.10)."<ref>[http://www.fedcenter.gov/assistance/facilitytour/landfills/hazwaste/ Hazardous Waste Landfills]</ref><ref>[https://www.epa.gov/hw/land-disposal-restrictions-hazardous-waste Land Disposal Restrictions for Hazardous Waste]</ref>

=== Pyrolysis ===
[[File:Fire 1873.JPG|thumb|right|Burning pieces of wood, showing various stages of pyrolysis followed by oxidative combustion.]]
Some hazardous waste types may be eliminated using [[pyrolysis]] in a high temperature not necessarily through electrical arc but starved of oxygen to avoid combustion.  However, when electrical arc is used to generate the required ultra heat (in excess of 3000 degree C temperature) all materials (waste) introduced into the process will melt into a molten slag and this technology is termed Plasma not pyrolysis. Plasma technology produces inert materials and when cooled solidifies into rock like material. These treatment methods are very expensive but may be preferable to high temperature incineration in some circumstances such as in the destruction of concentrated organic waste types, including PCBs, pesticides and other persistent organic pollutants.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/publications/chemicals/scheduled-waste/swtt/plasma.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005153933/http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/publications/chemicals/scheduled-waste/swtt/plasma.html#plascon |archive-date=2009-10-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/docs/Waste_Stockpiles/ESM%20of%20pesticide%20POPs%20part%203.pdf |title=Microsoft PowerPoint - ESM of pesticide POPs part 3 |access-date=2017-11-19}}</ref>
