'''Autoerotic fatalities''' are accidental [[death]]s that occur during [[Autoeroticism|sexual self-stimulation]] when an apparatus, device or prop that is being employed to enhance pleasure causes the death.<ref name="sauvageau2014" /> Researchers only apply the term to unintentional deaths resulting from solitary sexual activity, not [[suicide]] or acts with a partner.<ref name="sauvageau2014" /> The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of autoerotic fatalities in Western countries is around 0.5 per million inhabitants each year.<ref name="sauvageau2014">{{cite journal | author = Sauvageau, A. | year = 2014 | title = Current Reports on Autoerotic Deaths—Five Persistent Myths | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-013-0430-z| pmid = 24293152 }}</ref>

[[Autoerotic asphyxia]] is the leading cause. 70 to 80% of autoerotic deaths are caused by hanging, while 10 to 30% are attributed to plastic bags or chemical use. Both of these lead to autoerotic asphyxia. 5 to 10% are related to [[electrocution]], foreign body insertion, overdressing/body wrapping, or another atypical method.<ref name="sauvageau2014" /> Specific causes include the use of chemicals such as [[amyl nitrite]], [[Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]], or [[nitrous oxide]], and props and tools such as knives, oversized dildos, ligatures or bags for asphyxiation, duct tape, electrical apparatus for shocks, water for self-immersion, fire-making equipment for self-immolation, or sharp, unhygienic or large fetishized objects. Male victims are much more likely to use a variety of devices during autoerotic behaviour than female victims.

The subject has been treated in two books, ''Autoerotic Fatalities'' by Hazelwood et al. (1983) and ''Autoerotic Asphyxiation: Forensic, Medical, and Social Aspects'' by Sheleg et al. (2006).
