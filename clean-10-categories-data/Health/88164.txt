BPH can be a progressive disease, especially if left untreated. Incomplete voiding results in residual urine or urinary stasis, which can lead to an increased risk of [[urinary tract infection]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Carlos |first1 = J |last2 = Almeida |first2 = Flavio |date = July 2008 |title = Residual Urinary Volume and Urinary Tract Infection- when are they linked? |journal = The Journal of Urology |volume = 180 |issue = 1 |pages = 182–185 |doi = 10.1016/j.juro.2008.03.044 |pmid = 18499191 }}</ref>

== Causes ==
=== Hormones ===
Most experts consider [[androgen]]s ([[testosterone]] and related [[hormone]]s) to play a permissive role in the development of BPH. This means that androgens must be present for BPH to occur, but do not necessarily directly cause the condition. This is supported by evidence suggesting that [[castration|castrated]] boys do not develop BPH when they age. In an unusual study of 26 eunuchs from the palace of the [[Qing dynasty]] still living in [[Beijing]] in 1960, the prostate could not be felt in 81% of the studied eunuchs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Wu |first1 = CP |last2 = Gu |first2 = FL |title = The prostate in eunuchs |journal = Prog Clin Biol Res |date = 1991 |volume = 370 |pages = 249–55 |pmid = 1924456 }}</ref> The average time since castration was 54 years (range, 41–65 years). On the other hand, some studies suggest that administering exogenous testosterone is not associated with a significant increase in the risk of BPH symptoms, so the role of testosterone in prostate cancer and BPH is still unclear. Further randomized controlled trials with more participants are needed to quantify any risk of giving exogenous testosterone.<ref>{{cite web |title = Testosterone and Aging: Clinical Research Directions. |url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK216175/ |publisher = NCBI Bookshelf |accessdate = 2 February 2015 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171105194336/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK216175/ |archive-date = 5 November 2017 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

[[Dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT), a [[metabolite]] of testosterone, is a critical mediator of prostatic growth. DHT is synthesized in the prostate from circulating testosterone by the action of the [[enzyme]] [[5α-reductase]], type 2. DHT can act in an [[autocrine]] fashion on the stromal cells or in [[paracrine]] fashion by diffusing into nearby [[epithelium|epithelial cells]]. In both of these cell types, DHT binds to nuclear [[androgen receptor]]s and signals the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[growth factor]]s that are mitogenic to the epithelial and stromal cells. DHT is ten times more potent than testosterone because it dissociates from the androgen receptor more slowly. The importance of DHT in causing [[nodule (medicine)|nodular]] hyperplasia is supported by clinical observations in which an [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of 5α-reductase such as [[finasteride]] is given to men with this condition. Therapy with a 5α-reductase inhibitor markedly reduces the DHT content of the prostate and, in turn, reduces prostate volume and BPH symptoms.<ref>{{cite web |title = Proscar (finisteride) Prescribing Information |url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/020180s037lbl.pdf |website = FDA – Drug Documents |publisher = Merck and Company |accessdate = 2 March 2015 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231752/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2010/020180s037lbl.pdf |archive-date = 3 March 2016 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Bartsch |first1 = G |last2 = Rittmaster |first2 = RS |last3 = Klocker |first3 = H |title = Dihydrotestosterone and the concept of 5alpha-reductase inhibition in human benign prostatic hyperplasia |journal = World J Urol |date = 2002 |volume = 19 |issue = 6 |pages = 413–25 |pmid = 12022710 |doi = 10.1007/s00345-002-0248-5 |s2cid = 3257666 }}</ref>

However, repeated contractions and dilations of myofibers will unavoidably cause injuries and broken myofibers. Myofibers have a low potential for regeneration; therefore, collagen fibers need to be used to replace the broken myofibers. Such misrepairs make the muscular tissue weak in functioning, and the fluid secreted by glands cannot be excreted completely. Then, the accumulation of fluid in glands increases the resistance of muscular tissue during the movements of contractions and dilations, and more and more myofibers will be broken and replaced by collagen fibers.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Benign prostate hyperplasia.jpg|thumb|right|Benign prostate hyperplasia]]
As men age, the enzymes [[aromatase]] and [[5-alpha reductase]] increase in activity. These enzymes are responsible for converting androgen hormones into [[estrogen]] and [[dihydrotestosterone]], respectively. This metabolism of androgen hormones leads to a decrease in testosterone but increased levels of DHT and estrogen.

Both the glandular epithelial cells and the stromal cells (including muscular fibers) undergo hyperplasia in BPH.<ref name="Kim2016" /> Most sources agree that of the two tissues, stromal hyperplasia predominates, but the exact ratio of the two is unclear.<ref name=Wasserman>{{cite journal |last = Wasserman |first = Neil F. |title = Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: A Review and Ultrasound Classification |journal = Radiologic Clinics of North America |date = 1 September 2006 |volume = 44 |issue = 5 |pages = 689–710 |doi = 10.1016/j.rcl.2006.07.005 |pmid = 17030221 }}</ref><sup>:694</sup>

Anatomically the median and lateral lobes are usually enlarged, due to their highly glandular composition. The anterior lobe has little in the way of glandular tissue and is seldom enlarged. (Carcinoma of the prostate typically occurs in the posterior lobe – hence the ability to discern an irregular outline per rectal examination).

== Diagnosis ==
The clinical diagnosis of BPH is based on a history of LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms), a digital rectal exam, and exclusion of other causes of similar signs and symptoms. The degree of LUTS does not necessarily correspond to the size of the prostate. An enlarged prostate gland on [[rectal examination]] that is symmetric and smooth supports a diagnosis of BPH.<ref name="Kim2016" /> However, if the prostate gland feels asymmetrical, firm, or nodular, this raises concern for prostate cancer.<ref name="Kim2016" />

[[Urinalysis]] is typically performed when LUTS are present and BPH is suspected to evaluate for signs of a urinary tract infection, [[glycosuria|glucose in the urine]] (suggestive of diabetes), or [[proteinuria|protein in the urine]] (suggestive of kidney disease).<ref name="Kim2016" /> Bloodwork including [[Renal function|kidney function tests]] and [[prostate specific antigen]] (PSA) are often ordered to evaluate for kidney damage and prostate cancer, respectively.<ref name="Kim2016" /> However, checking blood PSA levels for [[prostate cancer screening]] is controversial and not necessarily indicated in every evaluation for BPH.<ref name="Kim2016" /> Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are both capable of increasing blood PSA levels and PSA elevation is unable to differentiate these two conditions well.<ref name="Kim2016" /> If PSA levels are checked and are high, then further investigation is warranted. Measures including PSA density, free PSA, rectal examination, and transrectal [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]] may be helpful in determining whether a PSA increase is due to BPH or prostate cancer.<ref name="Kim2016" /> Ultrasound examination of the [[testes]], prostate, and [[kidney]]s is often performed, again to rule out [[cancer]] and [[hydronephrosis]].

Validated questionnaires such as the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI), the [[International Prostate Symptom Score]] (I-PSS), and more recently the UWIN score (urgency, weak stream, incomplete emptying, and nocturia) are useful aids to making the diagnosis of BPH and quantifying the severity of symptoms.<ref name="Kim2016" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Parsons |first1 = JK |title = Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: Epidemiology and Risk Factors. |journal = Current Bladder Dysfunction Reports |date = December 2010 |volume = 5 |issue = 4 |pages = 212–218 |pmid = 21475707 |doi = 10.1007/s11884-010-0067-2 |pmc = 3061630 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Eid |first1 = K |last2 = Krughoff |first2 = K |last3 = Stoimenova |first3 = D |last4 = Smith |first4 = D |last5 = Phillips |first5 = J |last6 = O'Donnell |first6 = C |last7 = Barqawi |first7 = A |title = Validation of the Urgency, Weak stream, Incomplete emptying, and Nocturia (UWIN) score compared with the American Urological Association Symptoms Score in assessing lower urinary tract symptoms in the clinical setting. |journal = Urology |date = January 2014 |volume = 83 |issue = 1 |pages = 181–5 |pmid = 24139351 |doi = 10.1016/j.urology.2013.08.039 }}</ref>

=== Differential diagnosis ===
==== Medical conditions ====
The differential diagnosis for LUTS is broad and includes various medical conditions, neurologic disorders, and other diseases of the bladder, urethra, and prostate such as [[bladder cancer]], urinary tract infection, [[urethral stricture]], [[Ureterolithiasis|urethral calculi (stones)]], [[chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome|chronic prostatitis]], and prostate cancer.<ref name="Kim2016" /> [[Neurogenic bladder]] can cause urinary retention and cause symptoms similar to those of BPH. This may occur as a result of uncoordinated contraction of the bladder muscle or impairment in the timing of bladder muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation.<ref name="Kim2016" /> Notable causes of neurogenic bladder include disorders of the [[central nervous system]] such as [[Parkinson's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[spinal cord injury|spinal cord injuries]] as well as disorders of the peripheral nervous system such as [[diabetes mellitus]], [[vitamin B12 deficiency]], and [[alcoholic neuropathy|alcohol-induced nerve damage]].<ref name="Kim2016" /> Individuals affected by [[heart failure]] often experience nighttime awakenings to urinate due to redistribution of fluid accumulated in swollen legs.<ref name="Kim2016" />

==== Medications ====
Certain medications can increase urination difficulties by increasing bladder outlet resistance due to increased [[smooth muscle]] tone at the prostate or bladder neck and contribute to LUTS.<ref name="Kim2016" /> [[Alpha-adrenergic agonist]] medications, such as [[decongestant]]s with [[pseudoephedrine]] can increase bladder outlet resistance.<ref name="Kim2016" /> In contrast, [[calcium channel blocker]]s and [[anticholinergic]] medications can worsen urinary retention by promoting bladder muscle relaxation.<ref name="Kim2016" /> Diuretic medications such as [[loop diuretic]]s (e.g., [[furosemide]]) or [[thiazide]]s (e.g., [[chlorthalidone]]) can cause or worsen urinary frequency and nighttime awakenings to urinate.<ref name="Kim2016" />

== Management ==
When treating and managing benign prostatic hyperplasia, the aim is to prevent complications related to the disease and improve or relieve symptoms.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Hwang|first1=Eu Chang|last2=Gandhi|first2=Shreyas|last3=Jung|first3=Jae Hung|last4=Imamura|first4=Mari|last5=Kim|first5=Myung Ha|last6=Pang|first6=Ran|last7=Dahm|first7=Philipp|date=2018|title=Naftopidil for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms compatible with benign prostatic hyperplasia|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=10|pages=CD007360|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007360.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmc=6516835|pmid=30306544}}</ref> Approaches used include lifestyle modifications, medications, and surgery.

Less-selective α1 receptor blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may lower blood pressure. The older, less selective α1-adrenergic blocker prazosin is not a first line choice for either [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] or prostatic hyperplasia; it is a choice for patients who present with both problems at the same time.

=== Surgery ===
{{Main|Surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia}}

[[File:Rtu.jpg|thumb|right|Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)]]

If medical treatment is not effective, surgery may be performed. Surgical techniques used include the following:

*[[Transurethral resection of the prostate]] (TURP): the gold standard.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Richard M.|last2=Monga|first2=Manoj|last3=Elliott|first3=Sean P.|last4=Macdonald|first4=Roderick|last5=Langsjoen|first5=Jens|last6=Tacklind|first6=James|last7=Wilt|first7=Timothy J.|date=2012-09-12|title=Microwave thermotherapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=9|pages=CD004135|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004135.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=22972068}}</ref> TURP is thought to be the most effective approach for improving urinary symptoms and urinary flow, however, this surgical procedure may be associated with complications in up to 20% of men.<ref name=":0" /> Surgery carries some risk of complications, such as [[retrograde ejaculation]] (most commonly), [[erectile dysfunction]], [[urinary incontinence]], [[urethral stricture]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/transurethral-resection-of-the-prostate-turp/risks/|title=Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) - Risks|date=2017-10-24|website=nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>
* Open [[prostatectomy]]: not usually performed nowadays, even if results are very good.
*[[Transurethral incision of the prostate]] (TUIP): rarely performed; the technique is similar to TURP but less definitive.
* Photoselective (laser) vaporization of the prostate (PVP): common treatment.
* [[Prostate steam treatment|Water vapor thermal therapy]] (marketed as Rezum): a newer office procedure for removing prostate tissue using steam, while preserving sexual function.
* Prostatic urethral lift (marketed as UroLift), a minimally invasive device to open the urethra. May preserve sexual function. <ref>{{Cite book|last1=Helo|first1=Sevann|title=Campbell-Walsh-Wein urology|last2=Welliver|first2=Charles|last3=McVary|first3=Keviv|publisher=Elsevier|others=Partin, Alan W.,, Dmochowski, Roger R.,, Kavoussi, Louis R.,, Peters, Craig (Craig Andrew)|year=2020|isbn=978-0-323-54642-3|edition=Twelfth|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=3403–3488|chapter=Minimally Invasive and Endoscopic Management of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia|oclc=1130700336}}</ref>

=== Endovascular ===
{{Main|Prostatic artery embolization}}

As of 2017, the latest alternative to surgical treatment was arterial [[embolization]], an endovascular procedure performed in [[interventional radiology]].<ref name="pmid28032133">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuang M, Vu A, Athreya S |title=A systematic review of prostatic artery embolization in the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. |journal=Cardiovasc Intervent Radiol |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=655–663 |year=2017 |pmid=28032133 |doi=10.1007/s00270-016-1539-3 |s2cid=12154537 }}</ref> Through [[catheter]]s, embolic agents are released in the main branches of the prostatic artery, in order to induce a decrease in the size of the prostate gland, thus reducing the urinary symptoms.<ref name="pmid27019980">{{cite journal|vauthors=Pisco J, Bilhim T, Pinheiro LC, Fernandes L, Pereira J, Costa NV, Duarte M, Oliveira AG |title=Prostate embolization as an alternative to open surgery in patients with large prostate and moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms. |journal=J Vasc Interv Radiol |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=700–8 |year=2016 |pmid=27019980 |doi=10.1016/j.jvir.2016.01.138 }}</ref>

=== Transurethral microwave thermotherapy ===
[[Transurethral microwave thermotherapy]] (TUMT) is an outpatient procedure that is less invasive compared to surgery and involves using microwaves (heat) to shrink prostate tissue that is enlarged.<ref name=":0" /> TUMT may be effective at safely improving symptoms, however, TUMT does not appear to be as effective as a surgical approaches such as TURP.<ref name=":0" />
