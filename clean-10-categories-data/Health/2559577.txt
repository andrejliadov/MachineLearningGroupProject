==History==
[[File:Charité vom Futurium aus.jpg|thumbnail|Historic and modern buildings at Campus Charité Mitte (CCM)]]
[[File:Charité Standorte.svg|left|thumbnail|Locations of the four campuses of Charité in Berlin]]

Complying with an order of King [[Frederick I of Prussia]] from 14 November 1709, the hospital was established north of the Berlin city walls in 1710 in anticipation of an outbreak of the [[bubonic plague]] that had already depopulated [[East Prussia]]. After the plague spared the city, it came to be used as a charity hospital for the poor. On 9 January 1727, [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] gave it the name Charité, French 'charity'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charite.de/en/charite/organization/history/ |title=History|publisher=Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin |language=en |access-date=27 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210203314/http://www.charite.de/en/charite/organization/history/# |archive-date=2012-12-10 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The construction of an [[anatomical theatre]] in 1713 marks the beginning of the medical school, then supervised by the ''collegium medico-chirurgicum'' of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].<ref name="Einhäup-Ganten2010">{{cite book |last1=Einhäupl |first1=Karl Max |last2=Ganten |first2=Detlev |last3=Hein |first3=Jakob |title=300 Jahre Charité – im Spiegel ihrer Institute |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6K1IrW5FS8UC&pg=PA21 |access-date=27 October 2015 |date=2010 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |language=de |isbn=9783110202564 |pages=22–23 |chapter=2 Krankenpflege}}</ref>

In the [[19th century]], after the University of Berlin (today [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]]) was founded in 1810, the dean of the medical college [[Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland]] integrated the Charité as a teaching hospital in 1828. During this time it became home to such notable medical pioneers as [[Rudolf Virchow]], known as "the father of modern [[pathology]]"<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Virchow "Virchow"]. ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]''.</ref> and whose name is given to the eponymous "Virchow's Method" of autopsy;<ref name="RG">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_best_autopsy_method_of_Dissection_and_why_The_goal_of_the_question_is_to_gain_a_better_understanding_of_the_logic_for_methods_used|title=What is the best autopsy method of Dissection and why?

In the [[20th century]], at the end of the [[Second World War]] the Charité had endured the [[Battle of Berlin]], with Berlin having been taken by the [[Red Army]] on 2 May 1945. Though the majority of its original and pre-War structure was damaged or destroyed during the War, it nevertheless was used as a Red Army hospital. Subsequent to [[Victory in Europe]], in the period of [[denazification]] and the [[Nuremberg trials]], the Charité remained in the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet Sector]] of [[East Berlin|Berlin]] until the formation of the [[German Democratic Republic]], the GDR—''([[German Language|German]]: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR)''—in 1949, more commonly called [[East Germany]]. Under the [[Marxism–Leninism|Communists]], standards were largely maintained, and it became a showpiece for [[Eastern Bloc|East Bloc]] propaganda during the [[Cold War]]. Finally, in 1990 with the [[Reunification of Germany]], and in the years following, it once again became one of the world's leading research- and teaching-hospitals.

[[File:B-Lichterfelde Hindenburgdamm Klinikum.jpg|thumb|Campus Benjamin Franklin (CBF)]]
The Charité has four different campuses across the city of Berlin with a total of 3,001 beds:<ref>Coordinates from Google Maps</ref><ref name=report/>
* Campus in [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte, Berlin]] {{coord|52.525397|13.378467|type:landmrk|display=inline}}

In 2001, the Helios Clinics Group acquired the hospitals in Buch with their 1,200 beds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.helios-health.com/fileadmin/HeH_Unternehmen/PRAES_HeliosHealth_200101.pdf|title=Praes Helios Health|website=Helios-Health|accessdate=September 11, 2020}}</ref> Still, the Charité continues to use the campus for teaching and research and has more than 300 staff members located there.
The Charité encompasses more than 100 [[clinic]]s and scientific [[institute]]s, organized in 17 different departments, referred to as ''Charité Centers'' (CC):

* CC 1: Health and Human Sciences
* CC 2: Basic Sciences (First Year)
* CC 3: Dental, Oral and Maxillary Medicine
* CC 4: Charité-BIH Center for Therapy Research
* CC 5: Diagnostic Laboratory and Preventative Medicine
* CC 6: Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and Nuclear Medicine
* CC 7: Anesthesiology, Operating-Room Management and Intensive Care Medicine
* CC 8: Surgery
* CC 9: Traumatology and Reconstructive Medicine

* CC 15: Neurology, Neurosurgery, Psychiatry
* CC 16: Audiology/Phoniatrics, Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology
* CC 17: Gynecology, Perinatal, Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine with Perinatal Center & Human Genetics
Overall, 13 of those centers focus on patient care, while the rest focuses on research and teaching.
The ''Medical History Museum Berlin'' has a history dating back to 1899. The museum in its current form opened in 1998 and is famous for its pathological and anatomical collection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmm-charite.de/en/museum/history-of-the-museum.html |title=History of the Museum |publisher=Berliner Medizinhistorisches Museum |language=en |access-date=27 October 2015}}</ref>

In 2019, it was announced that the Berlin Institute of Health will become part of the Charité, marking a change in the German university system by making the Charité the first university clinic which will receive direct and annual financial support by the federal state of [[Germany]]. Together with private charity donors like the Johanna Quandt's private excellence initiative ([[BMW]]) or the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], as well as financing by the [[State of Berlin]], the new direct federal investments will become the third financial fundament for research at the Charité.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/berliner-institut-fuer-gesundheitsforschung-das-big-wird-in-die-charite-integriert/24186080.html |title=Das BIG wird in die Charité integriert |website=www.tagesspiegel.de |language=de |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> In addition, it is part of the [[Berlin University Alliance]], receiving funding from the [[German Universities Excellence Initiative]] in 2019.
