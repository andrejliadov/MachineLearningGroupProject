'''Scar free healing''' is the process by which significant injuries can heal without permanent damage to the tissue the injury has affected. In most healing, scars form due to the fibrosis and wound contraction, however in scar free healing tissue is completely regenerated. Scar improvement, and scar-free healing are an important and relevant area of medicine. During the 1990s, published research on the subject increased; it's a relatively recent term in the literature. Scar free healing is something which takes place in foetal life but the capacity is lost during progression to adulthood. In amphibians, tissue regeneration occurs, for example, as in skin regeneration in the adult [[axolotl]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seifert|first=Ashley W.|last2=Monaghan|first2=James R.|last3=Voss|first3=S.

Scarring during healing can create both physical and psychological problems, and is a significant clinical burden which is why the scar free healing concept is of interest. Some of the problems in scar healing lie in the physical outcome of the process: for example when collagen is abnormally organised in scar tissue. In scars the [[collagen]] is arranged in parallel bundles of the collagen fibres whilst healthy scar free tissue has a "basket weave" structure (Figure 1).<ref name="Occleston et al 2010" /> The difference in collagen arrangement along with a lack of difference in the dermal tissue when healing has taken place with or without scarring is indicative of regenerative failure of normal skin.<ref name="Occleston et al 2010" /> Severe scarring resulting from these collagen deposits is known as hypertrophic scarring and is of great concern worldwide with an incidence ranging from 32–72%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gangemi|first=Ezio Nicola|last2=Gregori|first2=Dario|last3=Berchialla|first3=Paola|last4=Zingarelli|first4=Enrico|last5=Cairo|first5=Monica|last6=Bollero|first6=Daniele|last7=Ganem|first7=Jamal|last8=Capocelli|first8=Roberto|last9=Cuccuru|first9=Franca|date=2008-04-01|title=Epidemiology and risk factors for pathologic scarring after burn wounds|journal=Archives of Facial Plastic Surgery|volume=10|issue=2|pages=93–102|doi=10.1001/archfaci.10.2.93|issn=1521-2491|pmid=18347236|doi-access=free}}</ref>

== Fetal vs adult healing in humans ==
Reparation of tissue in the mammalian fetus is radically different than the healing mechanisms observed in a healthy adult. During early gestation fetal skin wounds have the remarkable ability to heal rapidly and without scar formation. Wound healing itself is a particularly complex process and the mechanisms by which scarring occurs involves inflammation, [[Scar|fibroplasia]], the formation of granulation tissue and finally scar maturation. Since the observation of scar free healing was first reported in the early fetus more than three decades ago, research has focused intently on the underlying mechanisms which separate scarless fetal wound repair from normal adult wound healing.

Scar free healing has been documented in fetuses across the animal kingdom, including mice, rats, monkeys, pigs and humans. It is important to note that the ability of fetuses to heal without scarring is wound size dependent and also age-dependent, whereby after a specific gestational age, usually 24 weeks in humans, typical scar formation will occur. While the exact mechanisms of scar free healing in the fetus remain unknown, research has shown that it is thought to be due to the complex interaction of the components of the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM), the inflammatory response, [[cellular mediators]] and the expression of specific [[growth factors]].<ref name="Larson 1172–1180">{{Cite journal|last=Larson|first=Barrett J.|last2=Longaker|first2=Michael T.|last3=Lorenz|first3=H. Peter|title=Scarless Fetal Wound Healing: A Basic Science Review|journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|volume=126|issue=4|pages=1172–1180|doi=10.1097/prs.0b013e3181eae781|pmid=20885241|pmc=4229131|year=2010}}</ref>

===Intrauterine environment===

Originally, it was thought that the intrauterine environment, the sterile [[amniotic fluid]] surrounding the embryo, was responsible for fetal scar free healing. Reasoning that embryonic wounds healed scarlessly because they were not exposed to the same contaminating agents which normal adult wounds were exposed to such as bacteria and viruses. However this theory was discredited by investigating fetal wound healing in the pouch of a young marsupial. These pouches can often be exposed to maternal faeces and urine, a highly different environment to the sterile intrauterine environment seen in [[eutheria]]n embryos. Despite these differences skin wounds on the marsupial healed without the formation of a scar, proving the irrelevance of the embryonic environment in scar free healing.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Immune system cells and inflammatory response===

One of the major differences between embryonic scar-free healing wounds and adult scar-forming wounds is the role played by the cells of the immune system and the inflammatory response.

The fetal immune system can be described as 'immunologically immature' due to the marked reduction in [[neutrophil]]s, [[macrophage]]s, [[monocyte]]s, [[lymphocyte]]s and also [[inflammatory mediators]], compared with adult wounds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Mark W. J.|last2=O'Kane|first2=Sharon|date=2004-05-29|title=Scar–free healing: from embryonic mechanisms to adult therapeutic intervention|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=359|issue=1445|pages=839–850|doi=10.1098/rstb.2004.1475|issn=0962-8436|pmc=1693363|pmid=15293811}}</ref> Physiologically, adult and fetal neutrophils differ, due to the fact that the concentration of neutrophils is higher in the adult than the fetus, this results in [[phagocytosis]] of the wound and the recruitment and release of [[inflammatory cytokines]]. Leading to the promotion of a more aggressive inflammatory response in adult wound healing. It is also thought that the time in which this inflammatory response occurs, is much shorter in the fetus thus limiting any damage.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Lo|first=David D.|last2=Zimmermann|first2=Andrew S.|last3=Nauta|first3=Allison|last4=Longaker|first4=Michael T.|last5=Lorenz|first5=H.

===Role of the extracellular matrix and its components===

Another difference between the healing of embryonic and adult wounds is due to the role of [[fibroblast]] cells. Fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis of the ECM and collagen. In the fetus, fibroblasts are able to migrate at a faster rate than those found in the adult wound. Fetal fibroblasts can also proliferate and synthesize collagen simultaneously, in comparison to adult fibroblasts where collagen synthesis is delayed. It is this delay in both collagen deposition and migration, which is likely to contribute to formation of a scar in the adult.

Proteins and cell surface receptors found in the ECM differ in fetal and adult wound healing. This is due to the early up regulation of cell adhesion proteins such as [[fibronectin]] and tenascin in the fetus. During early gestation in the fetal wounds of rabbits, the production of fibronectin occurs around 4 hours after wounding, much faster than in adult wounds where expression of fibronectin does not occur until 12 hours post wounding. The same pattern can be seen in the deposition of [[tenascin]]. It is this ability of the fetal fibroblast to quickly express and deposit fibronectin and tenascin, which ultimately allows cell migration and attachment to occur, resulting in an organised matrix with less scarring.<ref name=":2" />

Another major component of the ECM is [[hyaluronic acid]] (HA), a glycosaminoglycan. It is known that fetal skin contains more HA than adult skin due to the expression of more HA receptors. The expression of HA is known to down-regulate the recruitment of inflammatory cytokines [[Interleukin-1 family|interleukin-1]] (IL-1) and [[Tumor necrosis factor superfamily|tumour necrosis factor]]-alpha (TNF-α); since fetal wounds contain a reduced number of pro-inflammatory mediators than adult wounds it is thought that the higher levels of HA in the fetal skin aid in scar free healing.

Analysis using [[microarray]]s has also shown that gene expression profiles greatly differ between scar free fetal wounds and postnatal wounds with scar formation. In scarlesss wound healing there is a significant up-regulation in genes associated with cell growth and proliferation, thought to be a major contributing factor to the rapid wound closure seen in the foetus.<ref name="Larson 1172–1180"/> Whilst wound healing in the fetus has been shown to be completely scarless in an age-dependent manner, adult mammals do not have complete scar free healing but have retained some regenerative properties. Adult regeneration is limited to a number of organs, most notably, the liver.

== Continued regeneration in adult humans ==
There are few examples of regeneration in humans continuing after fetal life in to adulthood. Generally, adult wound healing involves fibrotic processes causing wound contraction which may lead to the formation of scar tissue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gurtner|first=Geoffrey C.|last2=Werner|first2=Sabine|last3=Barrandon|first3=Yann|last4=Longaker|first4=Michael T.|date=2008-05-15|title=Wound repair and regeneration|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=453|issue=7193|pages=314–321|doi=10.1038/nature07039|issn=0028-0836|pmid=18480812}}</ref> In regeneration, however, completely new tissue is synthesized. This can lead to scar free healing where the function and structure of the organ is reinstated.<ref name="Yannas2015">{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493918645|title=Tissue and Organ Regeneration in Adults - Extension of the {{!}} Ioannis V. Yannas {{!}} Springer|isbn=9781493918645|publisher=Springer|year=2015}}</ref> However organ regeneration is not yet fully understood.

Two types of regeneration in human adults are currently recognised; spontaneous and induced.<ref name="Occleston et al 2010" />

Spontaneous regeneration occurs in the human body naturally. The most recognised example of this is the regeneration of the liver,<ref name="Liver"/> which can regenerate up to two thirds of its mass when injured by surgical removal, ischaemia or after exposure to harmful toxins.<ref name="Liver">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780124201286|title=Liver Regeneration - ScienceDirect|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2016-09-28}}</ref>  (Figure 2) 
[[File:Liver regeneration.png|thumb|upright=3|Figure 2: Mechanism of liver regeneration in adult humans]]
Through this mechanism the liver can be restored to its original state, scar-free. However, despite nearly 80 years of research on liver regeneration much debate still surrounds the exact mechanisms by which the process occurs.<ref name="Liver"/>

Another example of spontaneous regeneration  endometrial lining of the uterus after menses during reproductive years.  Endometrial glands from a basal layer of the uterine wall can regenerate the functional layer without fibrosis or scarring.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gargett|first=Caroline E.|last2=Nguyen|first2=Hong P.

Most recently, the kidney has been found to have the ability to regenerate. Following removal or incapacitation of one kidney the other may double in size in order to counteract the loss of the other kidney. This is known a compensatory growth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fong|first=Debra|last2=Denton|first2=Kate M.|last3=Moritz|first3=Karen M.|last4=Evans|first4=Roger|last5=Singh|first5=Reetu R.|date=2014-03-01|title=Compensatory responses to nephron deficiency: adaptive or maladaptive?|journal=Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)|volume=19|issue=3|pages=119–128|doi=10.1111/nep.12198|issn=1440-1797|pmid=24533732}}</ref>

Induced regeneration stimulated by an outside source of a "non-regenerative" organ.<ref name="Occleston et al 2010" /> In humans is for therapeutic use. Induced regeneration iscurrently being trialled  to replace organ transplants as issues such as rejection, lack of donors and scarring would be eliminated.<ref name="pmid16849201">{{Cite journal|last=Yannas|first=Ioannis V.|date=2005-12-22|title=Similarities and differences between induced organ regeneration in adults and early foetal regeneration|journal=Journal of the Royal Society, Interface|volume=2|issue=5|pages=403–417|doi=10.1098/rsif.2005.0062|issn=1742-5689|pmc=1618502|pmid=16849201}}</ref>

== Clinical burden and implications of scarring ==
Following injury or surgery, a doctor's key aim is to restore full function in a patient and help ensure they return to as close to their original state before their skin trauma or surgery.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Auger|first=F. A.|last2=Lacroix|first2=D.|last3=Germain|first3=L.|date=2009-01-01|title=Skin substitutes and wound healing|journal=Skin Pharmacology and Physiology|volume=22|issue=2|pages=94–102|doi=10.1159/000178868|issn=1660-5535|pmid=19188757}}</ref>  Ensuring patients return as closely to their original appearance and original function is challenging in the context of scarring.  Scar-free healing is yet to be observed in healthy post gestational humans, despite being seen in human [[embryo]]s.  Currently, it is only possible to reduce scar visibility, and the NHS suggests a number of different methods of doing this including corticosteroid injections, skin creams, silicone gels, pressure dressings, dermal fillers, radiotherapy and laser therapy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/scars/pages/treatment.aspx|title=Scars - Treatment|date=4 September 2014|website=NHS Choices|access-date=25 September 2016}}</ref>  Although these methods do reduce a scars visible appearance, they do not result in a scar free appearance.  Billions of pounds is spent on wound maintenance and healing on the NHS every year. Between 2014 and 2015 in England and Wales, 19,239 people sustained a burn injury which required hospital care.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scarfree.org.uk/uploads/documents/Scar-Free-Foundation-Research-Strategy.pdf|title=Imagine A World Without Scars|date=19 July 2016|website=The Scar Free Foundation|access-date=25 September 2016}}</ref>  In addition to the significant financial cost, the cost of scars is immense to the patients too.  One study into the quality of life of patients with scars found that over half of the participants felt stigmatised by their scars and felt their personal relationships deteriorated.  In addition to this, 68% tried to hide their scars, whilst reporting their work life, self-confidence and ability to communicate with others had been negatively affected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=B.
