Only two [[essential fatty acids]] are known to be essential for humans: [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]) and [[linoleic acid]] (an [[omega-6 fatty acid]]).<ref>{{cite book |author1=Whitney Ellie |author2=Rolfes SR | title = Understanding Nutrition | edition = 11th | location = California | publisher = Thomson Wadsworth | year = 2008 | pages = 154}}</ref> The biological effects of the ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are mediated by their mutual interactions. Closely related, these fatty acids act as competing substrates for the same enzymes. The biological effects of the ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are largely mediated by [[essential fatty acid interactions]]. '''The proportion of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids in a diet''' may have metabolic consequences.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1 = Bibus|first1 = Doug|last2 = Lands|first2 = Bill|title = Balancing proportions of competing omega-3 and omega-6 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) in tissue lipids|doi = 10.1016/j.plefa.2015.04.005|date = April 18, 2015|pmid = 26002802|volume=99|journal=Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids|pages=19–23|doi-access = free}}</ref> Unlike omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids, [[omega-9 fatty acid]]s are not classed as essential fatty acids because they can be created by the human body from monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids, and are therefore not essential in the diet.

==Types of omega-3 fats==
{{uncited section|date=June 2020}}
Of the omega-3s, only [[α-linolenic acid]] (ALA) is described as "essential". Indeed, other omega-3 fatty acids can be synthesized by the body from ALA. It is particularly present in linseed (flaxseed) and hemp seeds.

[[Eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) can be synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid, although the conversion rate is very low. It is therefore important to consume foods rich in EPA, especially some oily fish. Populations that consume large amounts of fish (for example, the Inuit of Greenland and the Japanese) are significantly less affected by cardiovascular disease. In addition, EPA is transformed into eicosanoids of series 3, substances that contribute to the protection of the arteries and the heart and have recognized anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects.

[[Docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) is also present in marine products, especially in some oily fish. It plays a fundamental role in the development of the brain and retina as well as in the formation and motility of spermatozoa.

==Omega-3 intake recommendations==
The World Health Organization has made recommendations regarding omega-3 intake:
* ALA: 0.8 g to 1.1 g / day
* EPA + DHA: 0.3 g to 0.5 g / day

==Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats in the diets of hunter-gatherers==
It has been claimed that among hunter-gatherer populations, omega-6 fats and omega-3 fats are typically consumed in roughly a 1:1 ratio.<ref>Andrew Stoll, ''The Omega-3 Connection''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001, p. 43. "Populations maintaining historic omega-6 to omega-3 ratios (approximately 1 to 1) are protected from many of the scourges of the modern age."</ref>{{Better source needed|date=December 2020}} At one extreme of the spectrum of hunter-gatherer diets, the [[Greenland Inuit]], prior to the late Twentieth Century, consumed a diet in which omega-6s and omega-3s were consumed in a 1:2 ratio, thanks to a diet rich in cold-water fish (which are a rich source of omega-3s) and completely devoid of omega-6-rich seed oils.<ref>William Lands, ''Fish, Omega-3 and Human Health.'' Urbana, Illinois: APCS Press, 2005, p. 10.</ref>

==Optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats==
To date, "no one knows what the optimal ratio in the diet is for these two families of fats."<ref name="Susan Allport 2007, p. 115">Susan Allport, ''The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3 Fats Were Removed From the Western Diet and What We Can Do to Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007, p. 115.</ref> Susan Allport{{who|date=June 2020}} writes that the current ratio in Japan is associated with a very low incidence of heart and other diseases. A dietary ratio of 4:1 produces almost a 1:1 ratio of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) in cell membranes."<ref name="Susan Allport 2007, p. 115"/>{{Clarify | date = February 2019 | reason = Although this is a direct quote from the book, but it's unclear that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 at 4:1 produces the ratio of 1:1 of what specific 'highly unsatuated fatty acids' in the membrane, making the sentence rather unhelpful. }}

Andrew Stoll,{{who|date=June 2020}} who advocates the consumption of the two fats in a 1:1 ratio, states, "Once in the body, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids follow parallel pathways, continually competing with each other for chemical conversion to various structures and molecules inside and outside the cells. Given this mechanism, it makes sense that the two fats might be required in approximately equal amounts."<ref name="Andrew Stoll 2001, p. 40">Andrew Stoll, ''The Omega-3 Connection''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001, p. 40.</ref>

Both Stoll and Allport assert that present-day diets in the developed world have departed dramatically from this ratio. It has been estimated that in developed countries, the ratio of Omega-6s to Omega-3s is closer to 15:1<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12442909 | year = 2002 | last1 = Simopoulos | first1 = AP | title = The importance of the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 essential fatty acids | volume = 56 | issue = 8 | pages = 365–79 | journal = Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy | doi=10.1016/S0753-3322(02)00253-6}}</ref> Another estimate is that "[t]he [[Standard American Diet#Standard American Diet|diet consumed by the typical American]] tends to contain 14 - 25 times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3 fatty acids."<ref>http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/omega6-fatty-acids</ref>{{Dead link | date = February 2019 | fix-attempted=yes}}<!-- use this link insstead? http://pennstatehershey.adam.com/content.aspx?productId=107&pid=33&gid=000317 -->

According to an 2009 review by the [[American Health Association]], instead of avoiding ω-6 fats, the ω-6:ω-3 ratio should be decreased by consuming more ω-3 fats. The conversion rate of linolenic acid into arachidonic acid is very low with a diet high in linolenic acid.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harris |first1=WS |last2=Mozaffarian |first2=D |last3=Rimm |first3=E |last4=Kris-Etherton |first4=P |last5=Rudel |first5=LL |last6=Appel |first6=LJ |last7=Engler |first7=MM |last8=Engler |first8=MB |last9=Sacks |first9=F |title=Omega-6 fatty acids and risk for cardiovascular disease: a science advisory from the American Heart Association Nutrition Subcommittee of the Council on Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Metabolism; Council on Cardiovascular Nursing; and Council on Epidemiology and Prevention. |journal=Circulation |date=17 February 2009 |volume=119 |issue=6 |pages=902-7 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.191627 |pmid=19171857 |lay-url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/no-need-to-avoid-healthy-omega-6-fats}}</ref>

The maximum ω-6:ω-3 ratio allowed in dog food by the [[Association of American Feed Control Officials|AAFCO]] is 30∶1.<ref name="aafco2014">{{cite web|date=2013|title=AAFCO methods for substantiating nutritional adequacy of dog and cat foods (proposed for 2014 publication)|url=https://www.aafco.org/Portals/0/SiteContent/Regulatory/Committees/Pet-Food/Reports/Pet_Food_Report_2013_Midyear-Proposed_Revisions_to_AAFCO_Nutrient_Profiles.pdf|publisher=AAFCO}}</ref>
