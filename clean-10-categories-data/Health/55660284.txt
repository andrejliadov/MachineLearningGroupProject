There are several different types of [[skin conditions]] that may result from [[flooding]].

In the case of a flood emergency, many residents are forced to wade through flood waters to escape, rescuers are exposed to flood waters in the effort to help, and citizens choose to walk in water for recreation. These waters contain [[pathogen]]s and chemicals which are thus exposed to individuals that come into contact with the waters. Some of the potential contaminants in the flood water include [[raw sewage]], oil, gasoline, and [[household chemicals]] such as paints (sometimes lead based) and [[insecticide]]s. A major concern is large scale, unintentional release of contaminants from industrial, [[Superfund Site|superfund]], or agricultural sites.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Stacy|last2=Balluz|first2=Lina|last3=Malilay|first3=Josephine|title=Natural and technologic hazardous material releases during and after natural disasters: a review|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=322|issue=1–3|pages=3–20|doi=10.1016/s0048-9697(03)00446-7|pmid=15081734|year=2004|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1089&context=publichealthresources}}</ref>

== Dermatological manifestations ==

=== Communicable diseases ===
Bacterial and fungal [[skin infection]]s have both been reported after exposure to floodwaters. The risk of infection is increased with traumatic injury to the skin and also in people with certain underlying conditions such as [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[chronic venous insufficiency]] and [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Diaz, MD, MPH&TM, DrPH, FCCM|first=James H.|last2=Diaz|first2=James H.|last3=MD|last4=MPH&TM|last5=DrPH|last6=FCCM|title=Superficial and invasive infections following flooding disasters|journal=American Journal of Disaster Medicine|volume=9|issue=3|pages=171–181|doi=10.5055/ajdm.2014.0169|pmid=25348388|year=2014}}</ref> [[Staphylococcus|Staphylococcal]] and [[Streptococcus|Streptococcal]] organisms remain the most common causes of superficial infection after a flooding event.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5438a6.htm|title=Infectious Disease and Dermatologic Conditions in Evacuees and Rescue Workers After Hurricane Katrina ---Multiple States, August--September, 2005|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref> Exposure to floodwaters is associated with increased risk of infection from atypical bacteria such as [[vibrio vulnificus]] and [[mycobacterium marinum]] when exposed to saltwater and [[aeromonas]] when exposed to contaminated freshwater.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Bandino|first=Justin P.|last2=Hang|first2=Anna|last3=Norton|first3=Scott A.|date=2015-10-01|title=The Infectious and Noninfectious Dermatological Consequences of Flooding: A Field Manual for the Responding Provider|journal=American Journal of Clinical Dermatology|language=en|volume=16|issue=5|pages=399–424|doi=10.1007/s40257-015-0138-4|pmid=26159354|issn=1175-0561}}</ref> People with [[Liver Cirrhosis|liver cirrhosis]] or immunosuppression are at an increased risk of developing severe disease with vibrio and aeromonas infections.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Fungal infections such as [[tinea corporis]] have also been reported especially in warm humid climates.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tempark|first=Therdpong|last2=Lueangarun|first2=Saoraya|last3=Chatproedprai|first3=Susheera|last4=Wananukul|first4=Siriwan|date=2013-10-01|title=Flood-related skin diseases: a literature review|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|language=en|volume=52|issue=10|pages=1168–1176|doi=10.1111/ijd.12064|pmid=24073902|issn=1365-4632}}</ref>

=== Contact dermatitis ===
[[Contact dermatitis]] occurs when the skin comes into contact with chemicals that cause a reaction, often redness, swelling or itchiness. Flood water often contains chemicals such as pesticides, bleach, and detergents from industries or households that can cause such a reaction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/contact-dermatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352742|title=Contact dermatitis - Symptoms and causes - Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref>

=== Traumatic injuries ===
Flood water consumes land that previously did not contain water. This raises the difficulty for residents and rescuers to see clearly where they are going, which can hide potential risks for traumatic injuries. This includes the covering of sharp objects (metals, glass, sticks), rocks and ditches, electrical hazards (down power lines) and animals that can be displaced from the flood waters.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Shultz|first=James M.|last2=Galea|first2=Sandro|date=2017-10-17|title=Mitigating the Mental and Physical Health Consequences of Hurricane Harvey|journal=JAMA|language=en|volume=318|issue=15|pages=1437|doi=10.1001/jama.2017.14618|issn=0098-7484}}</ref> 

=== Other manifestations ===
Additionally, psychological stress associated with a flooding event can lead to psycho-emotional aggravated primary skin disease, which exacerbates pre existing skin diseases such as: [[atopic dermatitis]], [[alopecia areata]], and [[psoriasis]].<ref name=":2" />

== Prevention ==
In systems already stressed by the natural disaster, the potential morbidity associated with skin infections or reactions can be life-threatening and is preventable if exposure is limited and post-exposure safety measures are taken. Skin should be thoroughly cleaned and people with exposures should ensure their tetanus vaccinations are up to date.

[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommendations:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/floods/sanitation.html|title=Personal Hygiene After a Disaster or Emergency{{!}}Floods|date=2017-10-12|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref>

* Avoiding contact with flood waters if one has an open wound.
* Covering clean, open wounds with a waterproof bandage to reduce the chance of infection.
* Keeping open wounds as clean as possible by washing well with soap and clean water.
* If a wound develops redness, swelling, or oozing, one should seek immediate medical care.
