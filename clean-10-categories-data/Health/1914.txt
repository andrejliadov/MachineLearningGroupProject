'''Antimicrobial resistance''' ('''AMR''' or '''AR''') occurs when [[microbe]]s evolve mechanisms that protect them from the effects of [[antimicrobials]].<ref name=WHO2014>{{cite web|title=Antimicrobial resistance Fact sheet N°194|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs194/en/|website=who.int|access-date=7 March 2015|date=April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310081111/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs194/en/|archive-date=10 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The term '''antibiotic resistance''' ('''AR''' or '''ABR''') is a subset of AMR, as it applies to [[bacteria]] that become resistant to [[antibiotic]]s.<ref name="WHO2014"/> Resistant microbes are more difficult to treat, requiring higher doses, or alternative medications which may prove [[adverse effect|more toxic]]. These approaches may also be more expensive. Microbes resistant to multiple antimicrobials are called [[multiple drug resistance|multidrug resistant]] (MDR).

All classes of microbes can evolve resistance. [[Fungi]] evolve [[antifungal]] resistance. [[Virus]]es evolve [[antiviral]] resistance. [[Protozoa]] evolve [[antiprotozoal]] resistance, and [[bacteria]] evolve [[antibiotic]] resistance. Those bacteria that are considered extensively drug resistant (XDR) or totally drug-resistant (TDR) are sometimes called "superbugs".<ref name="Magiorakos">A.-P. Magiorakos, A. Srinivasan, R. B.

The WHO defines antimicrobial resistance as a microorganism's [[drug resistance|resistance to an antimicrobial drug]] that was once able to treat an infection by that microorganism.<ref name=WHO2014/> A person cannot become resistant to antibiotics.

Antibiotic resistance is a subset of antimicrobial resistance.&nbsp;This more specified resistance is linked to pathogenic bacteria and thus broken down into two further subsets, microbiological and clinical. Resistance linked microbiologically is the most common and occurs from genes, mutated or inherited, that allow the bacteria to resist the mechanism associated with certain antibiotics.&nbsp;Clinical resistance is shown through the failure of many therapeutic techniques where the bacteria that are normally susceptible to a treatment become resistant after surviving the outcome of the treatment. In both cases of acquired resistance, the bacteria can pass the genetic catalyst for resistance through conjugation, transduction, or transformation.&nbsp;This allows the resistance to spread across the same pathogen or even similar bacterial pathogens.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = MacGowan A, Macnaughton E |date=1 October 2017|title=Antibiotic resistance |journal=Medicine |volume=45 |issue=10 |pages=622–628 |doi=10.1016/j.mpmed.2017.07.006 }}</ref>

== Causes ==
Antimicrobial resistance is mainly caused by the overuse of antimicrobials. This leads to microbes either evolving a defense against drugs used to treat them, or certain strains of microbes that have a natural resistance to antimicrobials becoming much more prevalent than the ones that are easily defeated with medication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cambridgemedicine.org/files/10-7244/cmj-2017-03-001/,%20http://cambridgemedicine.org/78-2/|title=Antimicrobial Resistance " Cambridge Medicine Journal|language=en|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>&nbsp; While antimicrobial resistance does occur naturally over time, the use of antimicrobial agents in a variety of settings both within the healthcare industry and outside of has led to antimicrobial resistance becoming increasingly more prevalent.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Holmes AH, Moore LS, Sundsfjord A, Steinbakk M, Regmi S, Karkey A, Guerin PJ, Piddock LJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Understanding the mechanisms and drivers of antimicrobial resistance | journal = Lancet | volume = 387 | issue = 10014 | pages = 176–87 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26603922 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00473-0 | hdl-access = free | hdl = 10044/1/32225 | s2cid = 1944665 }}</ref>

=== Natural occurrence ===
[[File:Antibiotic Resistance Spread.jpg|thumb|A CDC infographic on how antibiotic resistance (a major type of antimicrobial resistance) happens and spreads.]]
Antimicrobial resistance can evolve naturally due to continued exposure to antimicrobials. [[Natural selection]] means that organisms that are able to adapt to their environment survive and continue to produce offspring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_25|title=Natural selection|website=evolution.berkeley.edu|access-date=2020-03-10}}</ref> As a result, the types of microorganisms that are able to survive over time with continued attack by certain antimicrobial agents will naturally become more prevalent in the environment, and those without this resistance will become obsolete.<ref name=":0" /> Over time most of the strains of bacteria and infections present will be the type resistant to the antimicrobial agent being used to treat them, making this agent now ineffective to defeat most microbes. With the increased use of antimicrobial agents, there is a speeding up of this natural process.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferri M, Ranucci E, Romagnoli P, Giaccone V | title = Antimicrobial resistance: A global emerging threat to public health systems | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 57 | issue = 13 | pages = 2857–2876 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 26464037 | doi = 10.1080/10408398.2015.1077192 | s2cid = 24549694 }}</ref>

=== Self medication ===
Self medication by consumers is defined as "the taking of medicines on one's own initiative or on another person's suggestion, who is not a certified medical professional", and it has been identified as one of the primary reasons for the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rather IA, Kim BC, Bajpai VK, Park YH | title = Self-medication and antibiotic resistance: Crisis, current challenges, and prevention | journal = Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 808–812 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28490950 | pmc = 5415144 | doi = 10.1016/j.sjbs.2017.01.004 }}</ref> In an effort to manage their own illness, patients take the advice of false media sources, friends, and family causing them to take antimicrobials unnecessarily or in excess. Many people resort to this out of necessity, when they have a limited amount of money to see a doctor, or in many developing countries a poorly developed economy and lack of doctors are the cause of self-medication. In these developing countries, governments resort to allowing the sale of antimicrobials as over the counter medications so people could have access to them without having to find or pay to see a medical professional.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ayukekbong JA, Ntemgwa M, Atabe AN | title = The threat of antimicrobial resistance in developing countries: causes and control strategies | journal = Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 47 | date = 2017-05-15 | pmid = 28515903 | pmc = 5433038 | doi = 10.1186/s13756-017-0208-x }}</ref> This increased access makes it extremely easy to obtain antimicrobials without the advice of a physician, and as a result many antimicrobials are taken incorrectly leading to resistant microbial strains. One major example of a place that faces these challenges is India, where in the state of Punjab 73% of the population resorted to treating their minor health issues and chronic illnesses through self-medication.<ref name=":2" />

The major issue with self-medication is the lack of knowledge of the public on the dangerous effects of antimicrobial resistance, and how they can contribute to it through mistreating or misdiagnosing themselves.&nbsp; In order to determine the public's knowledge and preconceived notions on antibiotic resistance, a major type of antimicrobial resistance, a screening of 3537 articles published in Europe, Asia, and North America was done.&nbsp; Of the 55,225 total people surveyed, 70% had heard of antibiotic resistance previously, but 88% of those people thought it referred to some type of physical change in the body.<ref name=":2" />&nbsp; With so many people around the world with the ability to self-medicate using antibiotics, and a vast majority unaware of what antimicrobial resistance is, it makes the increase of antimicrobial resistance much more likely.

=== Clinical misuse ===
Clinical misuse by healthcare professionals is another cause leading to increased antimicrobial resistance. Studies done by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] show that the indication for treatment of antibiotics, choice of the agent used, and the duration of therapy was incorrect in up to 50% of the cases studied.&nbsp; In another study done in an intensive care unit in a major hospital in France, it was shown that 30% to 60% of prescribed antibiotics were unnecessary.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ventola CL | title = The antibiotic resistance crisis: part 1: causes and threats | journal = P & T | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 277–83 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25859123 | pmc = 4378521 }}</ref> These inappropriate uses of antimicrobial agents promote the evolution of antimicrobial resistance by supporting the bacteria in developing genetic alterations that lead to resistance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Strachan|first1=Cameron R.|last2=Davies|first2=Julian|date=2017-02-01|title=The Whys and Wherefores of Antibiotic Resistance|url=http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/content/7/2/a025171|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=a025171|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a025171|issn=2157-1422|pmid=27793964|pmc=5287056}}</ref> In a study done by the American Journal of Infection Control aimed to evaluate physicians’ attitudes and knowledge on antimicrobial resistance in ambulatory settings, only 63% of those surveyed reported antibiotic resistance as a problem in their local practices, while 23% reported the aggressive prescription of antibiotics as necessary to avoid failing to provide adequate care.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris A, Chandramohan S, Awali RA, Grewal M, Tillotson G, Chopra T | title = Physicians' attitude and knowledge regarding antibiotic use and resistance in ambulatory settings | journal = American Journal of Infection Control | volume = 47 | issue = 8 | pages = 864–868 | date = August 2019 | pmid = 30926215 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajic.2019.02.009 }}</ref>&nbsp; This demonstrates how a majority of doctors underestimate the impact that their own prescribing habits have on antimicrobial resistance as a whole. It also confirms that some physicians may be overly cautious when it comes to prescribing antibiotics for both medical or legal reasons, even when indication for use for these medications is not always confirmed. This can lead to unnecessary antimicrobial use.

=== Environmental pollution ===
Untreated effluents from pharmaceutical manufacturing industries,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ahmad |first1=Akram |title=Pharmaceutical waste and antimicrobial resistance |journal=Lancet |date=June 2017 |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=578–579 |doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30268-2 |pmid=28555576 |url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(17)30268-2/fulltext |access-date=7 October 2020}}</ref> hospitals and clinics, and inappropriate disposal of unused or expired medication can expose microbes in the environment to antibiotics and trigger the evolution of resistance.

=== Food production ===

==== Livestock ====
[[File:Ar-infographic-950px.jpg|thumb|A CDC infographic on how antibiotic resistance spreads through farm animals.]]
The antimicrobial resistance crisis also extends to the food industry, specifically with food producing animals.&nbsp; Antibiotics are fed to livestock to act as growth supplements, and a preventative measure to decrease the likelihood of infections.&nbsp; This results in the transfer of resistant bacterial strains into the food that humans eat, causing potentially fatal transfer of disease.&nbsp; While this practice does result in better yields and meat products, it is a major issue in terms of preventing antimicrobial resistance.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang KL, Caffrey NP, Nóbrega DB, Cork SC, Ronksley PE, Barkema HW, Polachek AJ, Ganshorn H, Sharma N, Kellner JD, Ghali WA | display-authors = 6 | title = Restricting the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals and its associations with antibiotic resistance in food-producing animals and human beings: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = The Lancet.

Additionally, the Advisory Group stated that such antimicrobials should be expressly prohibited for both growth promotion and disease prevention.<ref name="Innes"/>

In a study published by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] mapping antimicrobial consumption in livestock globally, it was predicted that in the 228 countries studied, there would be a total 67% increase in consumption of antibiotics by livestock by 2030. In some countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa it is predicted that a 99% increase will occur.<ref name=":1" /> Several countries have restricted the use of antibiotics in livestock, including Canada, China, Japan, and the US. These restrictions are sometimes associated with a reduction of the [[prevalence]] of antimicrobial resistance in humans.<ref name="Innes">{{cite journal | vauthors = Innes GK, Randad PR, Korinek A, Davis MF, Price LB, So AD, Heaney CD | title = External Societal Costs of Antimicrobial Resistance in Humans Attributable to Antimicrobial Use in Livestock | journal = Annual Review of Public Health | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 141–157 | date = April 2020 | pmid = 31910712 | pmc = 7199423 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040218-043954 }}</ref>

==== Pesticides ====
Most pesticides protect crops against insects and plants, but in some cases antimicrobial pesticides are used to protect against various microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, algae, and protozoa. The overuse of many pesticides in an effort to have a higher yield of crops has resulted in many of these microbes evolving a tolerance against these antimicrobial agents. Currently there are over 4000 antimicrobial pesticides registered with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] and sold to market, showing the widespread use of these agents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/what-are-antimicrobial-pesticides|title=What are Antimicrobial Pesticides?|last=US EPA|first=OCSPP|date=2013-03-15|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> It is estimated that for every single meal a person consumes, 0.3  g of pesticides is used, as 90% of all pesticide use is used on agriculture. A majority of these products are used to help defend against the spread of infectious diseases, and hopefully protect public health. But out of the large amount of pesticides used, it is also estimated that less than 0.1% of those antimicrobial agents, actually reach their targets. That leaves over 99% of all pesticides used available to contaminate other resources.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramakrishnan B, Venkateswarlu K, Sethunathan N, Megharaj M | title = Local applications but global implications: Can pesticides drive microorganisms to develop antimicrobial resistance? | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 654 | pages = 177–189 | date = March 2019 | pmid = 30445319 | doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.041 | bibcode = 2019ScTEn.654..177R }}</ref> In soil, air, and water these antimicrobial agents are able to spread, coming in contact with more microorganisms and leading to these microbes evolving mechanisms to tolerate and further resist pesticides.

==Prevention==
[[File:Antibioticresistance diagram.png|thumb|350px|Mission Critical: Preventing Antibiotic Resistance (CDC report, 2014)|alt=Infographic from CDC report on preventing antibiotic resistance]]

There have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat, including a proposal for international treaty on antimicrobial resistance. Further detail and attention is still needed in order to recognize and measure trends in resistance on the international level; the idea of a global tracking system has been suggested but implementation has yet to occur. A system of this nature would provide insight to areas of high resistance as well as information necessary for evaluating programs and other changes made to fight or reverse antibiotic resistance.

===Duration of antibiotics===
Antibiotic treatment duration should be based on the infection and other health problems a person may have.<ref name=NPS2013/><!-- "When optimising therapy for an infection consider the person's immune status, the infecting agent and the focus of infection." --> For many infections once a person has improved there is little evidence that stopping treatment causes more resistance.<ref name=NPS2013/><!-- "There does not appear to be strong evidence to support the notion that stopping antibiotics before the end of the recommended treatment contributes to increasing resistance" --> Some therefore feel that stopping early may be reasonable in some cases.<ref name=NPS2013/><!-- "Therefore, in selected cases, it may be appropriate to stop antibiotic therapy early." --> Other infections, however, do require long courses regardless of whether a person feels better.<ref name=NPS2013/><!-- "For some infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, enterococcal endocarditis or tuberculosis, clear evidence favours prolonged treatment to prevent relapse" -->

===Monitoring and mapping===
There are multiple national and international monitoring programs for drug-resistant threats, including [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), [[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'']] (VRSA), [[Beta-lactamase|extended spectrum beta-lactamase]] (ESBL), [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'']] (VRE), [[Acinetobacter baumannii|multidrug-resistant ''Acinetobacter baumannii'']] (MRAB).<ref name="CDC2013">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html|title=Biggest Threats – Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance – CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=5 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912115220/https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html|archive-date=12 September 2017|url-status=live|date=10 September 2018}}</ref>

Excessive antibiotic use has become one of the top contributors to the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Since the beginning of the antibiotic era, antibiotics have been used to treat a wide range of disease.<ref name=Andersson2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersson DI, Hughes D | title = Persistence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 901–11 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21707669 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00289.x | doi-access = free }}</ref> Overuse of antibiotics has become the primary cause of rising levels of antibiotic resistance. The main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antibiotics to ill-informed individuals who believe that antibiotics can cure nearly all illnesses, including viral infections like the common cold. In an analysis of drug prescriptions, 36% of individuals with a cold or an upper respiratory infection (both viral in origin) were given prescriptions for antibiotics.<ref name=Gilberg2003>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilberg K, Laouri M, Wade S, Isonaka S | title = Analysis of medication use patterns:apparent overuse of antibiotics and underuse of prescription drugs for asthma, depression, and CHF | journal = Journal of Managed Care Pharmacy | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 232–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14613466 | doi = 10.18553/jmcp.2003.9.3.232 | s2cid = 25457069 }}</ref> These prescriptions accomplished nothing other than increasing the risk of further evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Llor C, Bjerrum L | title = Antimicrobial resistance: risk associated with antibiotic overuse and initiatives to reduce the problem | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Drug Safety | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 229–41 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25436105 | pmc = 4232501 | doi = 10.1177/2042098614554919 }}</ref>

==== At the hospital level ====
[[Antimicrobial stewardship]] teams in hospitals are encouraging optimal use of antimicrobials.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doron S, Davidson LE | title = Antimicrobial stewardship | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 86 | issue = 11 | pages = 1113–23 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22033257 | pmc = 3203003 | doi = 10.4065/mcp.2011.0358 }}</ref> The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to help practitioners pick the right drug at the right dose and duration of therapy while preventing misuse and minimizing the development of resistance.

==== At the farming level ====
It is established that the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry can give rise to AMR resistances in bacteria found in food animals to the antibiotics being administered (through injections or medicated feeds).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Agga GE, Schmidt JW, Arthur TM | title = Effects of In-Feed Chlortetracycline Prophylaxis in Beef Cattle on Animal Health and Antimicrobial-Resistant Escherichia coli | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 82 | issue = 24 | pages = 7197–7204 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27736789 | pmc = 5118930 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.01928-16 }}</ref> For this reason only antimicrobials that are deemed "not-clinically relevant" are used in these practices.

==== At the level of GP ====
Given the volume of care provided in primary care (General Practice), recent strategies have focused on reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in this setting. Simple interventions, such as written information explaining the futility of antibiotics for common infections such as upper respiratory tract infections, have been shown to reduce antibiotic prescribing.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Sullivan JW, Harvey RT, Glasziou PP, McCullough A | title = Written information for patients (or parents of child patients) to reduce the use of antibiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections in primary care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD011360 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27886368 | pmc = 6464519 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011360.pub2 }}</ref>

The prescriber should closely adhere to the five rights of drug administration: the right patient, the right drug, the right dose, the right route, and the right time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihi.org/resources/pages/improvementstories/fiverightsofmedicationadministration.aspx|title=The Five Rights of Medication Administration|website=www.ihi.org|access-date=30 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024101457/http://www.ihi.org/resources/pages/improvementstories/fiverightsofmedicationadministration.aspx|archive-date=24 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Health workers and pharmacists can help tackle resistance by: enhancing infection prevention and control; only prescribing and dispensing antibiotics when they are truly needed; prescribing and dispensing the right antibiotic(s) to treat the illness.<ref name="who.int" />

==== At the individual level ====
People can help tackle resistance by using antibiotics only when prescribed by a doctor; completing the full prescription, even if they feel better; never sharing antibiotics with others or using leftover prescriptions.<ref name="who.int" />

=== Water, sanitation, hygiene ===
Infectious disease control through improved [[WASH|water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)]] infrastructure needs to be included in the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) agenda.

* improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training.
* strengthen the knowledge and evidence base through surveillance and research.
* reduce the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures.
* optimize the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health.
* develop the economic case for sustainable investment that takes account of the needs of all countries and to increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions.

==== Antibiotic Awareness Week ====
The World Health Organization has promoted the first World Antibiotic Awareness Week running from 16–22 November 2015. The aim of the week is to increase global awareness of antibiotic resistance. It also wants to promote the correct usage of antibiotics across all fields in order to prevent further instances of antibiotic resistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2015/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/event/en/|title=World Antibiotic Awareness Week|website=World Health Organization|access-date=20 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120222039/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2015/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/event/en/|archive-date=20 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

World Antibiotic Awareness Week has been held every November since 2015. For 2017, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the [[World Organisation for Animal Health]] (OIE) are together calling for responsible use of antibiotics in humans and animals to reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/2017/launch-event/en/|title=World Antibiotic Awareness Week|website=WHO|access-date=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113074006/http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/2017/launch-event/en/|archive-date=13 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

'''United Nations'''

In 2016 the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] convened the Interagency Coordination Group (IACG) on Antimicrobial Resistance.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/interagency-coordination-group/en/|title=WHO {{!}} UN Interagency Coordination Group (IACG) on Antimicrobial Resistance|website=WHO|access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref> The IACG worked with international organizations and experts in human, animal, and plant health to create a plan to fight antimicrobial resistance.<ref name=":5" /> Their report released in April 2019 highlights the seriousness of antimicrobial resistance and the threat it poses to world health. It suggests five recommendations for member states to follow in order to tackle this increasing threat. The IACG recommendations are as follows:

* Accelerate progress in countries
* Innovate to secure the future
* Collaborate for more effective action
* Invest for a sustainable response
* Strengthen accountability and global governance

==Mechanisms and organisms==

===Bacteria===
{{Further|List of antibiotic resistant bacteria}}[[File:mecA Resistance.svg|thumb|Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site, modeled after MRSA's resistance to penicillin. Beta-lactam antibiotics permanently inactivate [[Penicillin-binding protein|PBP enzymes]], which are essential for bacterial life, by permanently binding to their active sites. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], however, expresses a PBP that does not allow the antibiotic into its active site.|alt=Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site]]

The four main mechanisms by which bacteria exhibit resistance to antibiotics are:
# Drug inactivation or modification: for example, enzymatic deactivation of [[Penicillin|penicillin G]] in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of [[Beta-lactamases|β-lactamases]]. Most commonly, the protective enzymes produced by the bacterial cell will add an acetyl or phosphate group to a specific site on the antibiotic, which will reduce its ability to bind to the bacterial ribosomes and disrupt protein synthesis.<ref name="Criswell, Daniel 2004">[Criswell, Daniel. "The "Evolution" of Antibiotic Resistance." Institute for Creation Research. N.p., 2004. Web. 28 October 2014.]</ref>
# Alteration of target- or binding site: for example, alteration of [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP]]—the binding target site of penicillins—in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and other penicillin-resistant bacteria. Another protective mechanism found among bacterial species is ribosomal protection proteins. These proteins protect the bacterial cell from antibiotics that target the cell's ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis. The mechanism involves the binding of the ribosomal protection proteins to the ribosomes of the bacterial cell, which in turn changes its conformational shape. This allows the ribosomes to continue synthesizing proteins essential to the cell while preventing antibiotics from binding to the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Connell SR, Tracz DM, Nierhaus KH, Taylor DE | title = Ribosomal protection proteins and their mechanism of tetracycline resistance | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 47 | issue = 12 | pages = 3675–81 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14638464 | pmc = 296194 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.47.12.3675-3681.2003 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>
# Alteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some [[sulfa drugs|sulfonamide]]-resistant bacteria do not require [[para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of [[folic acid]] and [[nucleic acid]]s in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides, instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to using preformed folic acid.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Henry RJ | title = The Mode of Action of Sulfonamides | journal = Bacteriological Reviews | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 175–262 | date = December 1943 | pmid = 16350088 | pmc = 440870 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.7.4.175-262.1943 }}</ref>
# Reduced drug accumulation: by decreasing drug [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] or increasing active [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Li XZ, Nikaido H | title = Efflux-mediated drug resistance in bacteria: an update | journal = Drugs | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 1555–623 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19678712 | pmc = 2847397 | doi = 10.2165/11317030-000000000-00000 }}</ref> These pumps within the cellular membrane of certain bacterial species are used to pump antibiotics out of the cell before they are able to do any damage.

[[File:Antibiotic resistance mechanisms.jpg|thumb|300x300px|A number of mechanisms used by common antibiotics to deal with bacteria and ways by which bacteria become resistant to them.|alt=Infographic showing mechanisms for antibiotic resistance]]

There are several different types of germs that have developed a resistance over time. For example, Penicillinase-producing ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' developed a resistance to penicillin in 1976. Another example is Azithromycin-resistant ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'', which developed a resistance to azithromycin in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About Antibiotic Resistance|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html|website=CDC}}</ref> 

In gram-negative bacteria, plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to [[DNA gyrase]], protecting it from the action of quinolones. Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or [[topoisomerase IV]] can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones, decreasing the drug's effectiveness.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robicsek A, Jacoby GA, Hooper DC | title = The worldwide emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 629–40 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17008172 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70599-0 }}</ref>

Some bacteria are naturally resistant to certain antibiotics; for example, gram-negative bacteria are resistant to most [[β-lactam antibiotic]]s due to the presence of [[Beta-lactamases|β-lactamase]]. Antibiotic resistance can also be acquired as a result of either genetic mutation or [[horizontal gene transfer]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Ochiai K, Yamanaka T, Kimura K, Sawada O, O|year=1959|title=Inheritance of drug resistance (and its transfer) between Shigella strains and Between Shigella and E.coli strains|journal=Hihon Iji Shimpor|language=ja|volume=34|page=1861}}</ref> Although mutations are rare, with spontaneous mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] occurring at a rate of about 1 in 10<sup>5</sup> to 1 in 10<sup>8</sup> per chromosomal replication,<ref>{{Citation|last1=Watford|first1=Shelby|last2=Warrington|first2=Steven J. | name-list-style=vanc |title=Bacterial DNA Mutations|date=2018 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459274/ |work=StatPearls |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=29083710 |access-date=21 January 2019 }}</ref> the fact that bacteria reproduce at a high rate allows for the effect to be significant. Given that lifespans and production of new generations can be on a timescale of mere hours, a new (de novo) mutation in a parent cell can quickly become an [[heredity|inherited]] mutation of widespread prevalence, resulting in the [[microevolution]] of a fully resistant colony. However, chromosomal mutations also confer a cost of fitness. For example, a ribosomal mutation may protect a bacterial cell by changing the binding site of an antibiotic but will also slow protein synthesis.<ref name="Criswell, Daniel 2004" /> manifesting, in slower growth rate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levin BR, Perrot V, Walker N | title = Compensatory mutations, antibiotic resistance and the population genetics of adaptive evolution in bacteria | journal = Genetics | volume = 154 | issue = 3 | pages = 985–97 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10757748 | pmc = 1460977 | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=10757748 }}</ref> Moreover, some adaptive mutations can propagate not only through inheritance but also through [[horizontal gene transfer]]. The most common mechanism of horizontal gene transfer is the transferring of [[Plasmid-mediated resistance|plasmids]] carrying antibiotic resistance genes between bacteria of the same or different species via [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]]. However, bacteria can also acquire resistance through [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]], as in ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' uptaking of naked fragments of extracellular DNA that contain antibiotic resistance genes to streptomycin,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hotchkiss RD | title = Transfer of penicillin resistance in pneumococci by the desoxyribonucleate derived from resistant cultures | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology | volume = 16 | pages = 457–61 | date = 1951 | pmid = 14942755 | doi = 10.1101/SQB.1951.016.01.032 }}</ref> through [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], as in the bacteriophage-mediated transfer of tetracycline resistance genes between strains of ''S. pyogenes'',<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ubukata K, Konno M, Fujii R | title = Transduction of drug resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, macrolides, lincomycin and clindamycin with phages induced from Streptococcus pyogenes | journal = The Journal of Antibiotics | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 681–8 | date = September 1975 | pmid = 1102514 | doi = 10.7164/antibiotics.28.681 | doi-access = free }}</ref> or through [[gene transfer agent]]s, which are particles produced by the host cell that resemble bacteriophage structures and are capable of transferring DNA.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = von Wintersdorff CJ, Penders J, van Niekerk JM, Mills ND, Majumder S, van Alphen LB, Savelkoul PH, Wolffs PF | display-authors = 6 | title = Dissemination of Antimicrobial Resistance in Microbial Ecosystems through Horizontal Gene Transfer | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 7 | pages = 173 | date = 19 February 2016 | pmid = 26925045 | pmc = 4759269 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2016.00173 }}</ref>

Antibiotic resistance can be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes used as a [[selectable marker]] to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan CX, Beiko RG, Ragan MA | title = Lateral transfer of genes and gene fragments in Staphylococcus extends beyond mobile elements | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 193 | issue = 15 | pages = 3964–77 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21622749 | pmc = 3147504 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01524-10 }}</ref>

Recent findings show no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance. Small populations of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant. Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations. Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance evolution is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of ''E. coli'' produced by the gradient of antibiotic.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Johansen TB, Scheffer L, Jensen VK, Bohlin J, Feruglio SL | title = Whole-genome sequencing and antimicrobial resistance in Brucella melitensis from a Norwegian perspective | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 8538 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29867163 | pmc = 5986768 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-018-26906-3 | bibcode = 2018NatSR...8.8538J }}</ref> 

In one study, which has implications for space microbiology, a non-pathogenic strain ''E. coli'' MG1655 was exposed to trace levels of the broad spectrum antibiotic [[chloramphenicol]], under simulated microgravity (LSMMG, or, Low Shear Modeled Microgravity) over 1000 generations.

===Viruses===
Specific [[antiviral drug]]s are used to treat some viral infections. These drugs prevent viruses from reproducing by inhibiting essential stages of the virus's replication cycle in infected cells. Antivirals are used to treat [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[influenza]], [[herpesviridae|herpes viruses]] including [[varicella zoster virus]], [[cytomegalovirus]] and [[Epstein-Barr virus]]. With each virus, some strains have become resistant to the administered drugs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lou Z, Sun Y, Rao Z | title = Current progress in antiviral strategies | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 86–102 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24439476 | pmc = 7112804 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2013.11.006 }}</ref>

Antiviral drugs typically target key components of viral reproduction; for example, [[oseltamivir]] targets influenza [[neuraminidase]], while guanosine analogs inhibit viral DNA polymerase. Resistance to antivirals is thus acquired through mutations in the genes that encode the protein targets of the drugs.

Resistance to HIV antivirals is problematic, and even multi-drug resistant strains have evolved.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pennings PS | title = HIV Drug Resistance: Problems and Perspectives | journal = Infectious Disease Reports | volume = 5 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = e5 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 24470969 | pmc = 3892620 | doi = 10.4081/idr.2013.s1.e5 }}</ref> One source of resistance is that many current HIV drugs, including NRTIs and NNRTIs, target [[reverse transcriptase]]; however, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is highly error prone and thus mutations conferring resistance arise rapidly.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Das K, Arnold E | title = HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and antiviral drug resistance.

Of particular note, [[Fluconazole]]-resistant Candida species have been highlighted as a growing problem by the CDC.<ref name="CDC2013" /> More than 20 species of Candida can cause [[Candidiasis]] infection, the most common of which is ''[[Candida albicans]]''. Candida yeasts normally inhabit the skin and mucous membranes without causing infection. However, overgrowth of Candida can lead to Candidiasis.

The phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance caused by overuse of antibiotics was predicted as early as 1945 by [[Alexander Fleming]] who said "The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily under-dose himself and by exposing his microbes to nonlethal quantities of the drug make them resistant."<ref>Amábile-Cuevas CF, editor.

==Society and culture==
Since the mid-1980s pharmaceutical companies have invested in medications for cancer or chronic disease that have greater potential to make money and have "de-emphasized or dropped development of antibiotics".<ref name="NYT_jan_21_2016" /> On 20 January 2016 at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], more than "80 pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies" from around the world called for "transformational commercial models" at a global level to spur research and development on antibiotics and on the "enhanced use of diagnostic tests that can rapidly identify the infecting organism".<ref name="NYT_jan_21_2016">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/business/to-fight-superbugs-drug-makers-call-for-incentives-to-develop-antibiotics.html?smid=tw-share | title=To Fight 'Superbugs,' Drug Makers Call for Incentives to Develop Antibiotics | newspaper=New York Times |date=20 January 2016 | access-date=24 January 2016 |last=Pollack |first=Andrew | name-list-style=vanc | series=Davos 2016 Special Report | location=Davos, Switzerland | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424142407/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/business/to-fight-superbugs-drug-makers-call-for-incentives-to-develop-antibiotics.html?smid=tw-share | archive-date=24 April 2018 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==== United States ====
For the [[2016 United States federal budget|United States 2016 budget]], [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Barack Obama]] proposed to nearly double the amount of federal funding to "combat and prevent" antibiotic resistance to more than $1.2&nbsp;billion.<ref>[https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/27/fact-sheet-president-s-2016-budget-proposes-historic-investment-combat-a President’s 2016 Budget Proposes Historic Investment to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria to Protect Public Health] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311113659/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/27/fact-sheet-president-s-2016-budget-proposes-historic-investment-combat-a |date=11 March 2015 }} The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, 27 January 2015</ref> Many international funding agencies like USAID, DFID, [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|SIDA]] and [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] have pledged money for developing strategies to counter antimicrobial resistance.

On 27 March 2015, the [[White House]] released a comprehensive plan to address the increasing need for agencies to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Task Force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria developed ''The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria'' with the intent of providing a roadmap to guide the US in the antibiotic resistance challenge and with hopes of saving many lives. This plan outlines steps taken by the Federal government over the next five years needed in order to prevent and contain outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant infections; maintain the efficacy of antibiotics already on the market; and to help to develop future diagnostics, antibiotics, and vaccines.<ref name="whitehouse.gov">{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/27/fact-sheet-obama-administration-releases-national-action-plan-combat-ant|title=FACT SHEET: Obama Administration Releases National Action Plan to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria|website=whitehouse.gov|access-date=30 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122075741/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/27/fact-sheet-obama-administration-releases-national-action-plan-combat-ant|archive-date=22 November 2015|url-status=live|date=27 March 2015}}</ref>

The Action Plan was developed around five goals with focuses on strengthening health care, public health veterinary medicine, agriculture, food safety and research, and manufacturing. These goals, as listed by the White House, are as follows:
* Slow the Emergence of Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant Infections
* Strengthen National One-Health Surveillance Efforts to Combat Resistance
* Advance Development and use of Rapid and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Identification and Characterization of Resistant Bacteria
* Accelerate Basic and Applied Research and Development for New Antibiotics, Other Therapeutics, and Vaccines
* Improve International Collaboration and Capacities for Antibiotic Resistance Prevention, Surveillance, Control and Antibiotic Research and Development
The following are goals set to meet by 2020:<ref name="whitehouse.gov"/>
* Establishment of antimicrobial programs within acute care hospital settings
* Reduction of inappropriate antibiotic prescription and use by at least 50% in outpatient settings and 20% inpatient settings
* Establishment of State Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Prevention Programs in all 50 states
* Elimination of the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in food-producing animals.

==== United Kingdom ====
[[Public Health England]] reported that the total number of antibiotic resistant infections in England rose by 9% from 55,812 in 2017 to 60,788 in 2018, but antibiotic consumption had fallen by 9% from 20.0 to 18.2 defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day between 2014 and 2018.<ref>{{cite news |title=Patients contracted 165 antibiotic resistant infections each day in 2018, says PHE |url=https://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20207273.article |access-date=11 December 2019 |publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal |date=31 October 2019}}</ref>

=== Policies ===
According to [[World Health Organization]], policymakers can help tackle resistance by strengthening resistance-tracking and laboratory capacity and by regulating and promoting the appropriate use of medicines.<ref name="who.int" /> Policymakers and industry can help tackle resistance by: fostering innovation and research and development of new tools; and promoting cooperation and information sharing among all stakeholders.<ref name="who.int" />

== Further research ==
It is unclear if rapid viral testing affects antibiotic use in children.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Doan Q, Enarson P, Kissoon N, Klassen TP, Johnson DW | title = Rapid viral diagnosis for acute febrile respiratory illness in children in the Emergency Department | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = CD006452 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25222468 | pmc = 6718218 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006452.pub4 }}</ref>

===Vaccines===
Microorganisms do not develop resistance to [[vaccine]]s because a vaccine enhances the body's immune system, whereas an antibiotic operates separately from the body's normal defenses. Furthermore, if the use of vaccines increases, there is evidence that antibiotic resistant strains of pathogens will decrease; the need for antibiotics will naturally decrease as vaccines prevent infection before it occurs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mishra RP, Oviedo-Orta E, Prachi P, Rappuoli R, Bagnoli F | title = Vaccines and antibiotic resistance | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 596–602 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22981392 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2012.08.002 }}</ref> However, new strains that escape immunity induced by vaccines may [[Evolution|evolve]]; for example, an updated [[influenza vaccine]] is needed each year.

While theoretically promising, antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy, because of immunological variation between ''Staphylococcus'' species, and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced. Development and testing of more effective vaccines is underway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homesteadschools.com/nursing/courses/Immunity/Chapter05.html|title=Immunity, Infectious Diseases, and Pandemics—What You Can Do|publisher=HomesteadSchools.com|access-date=12 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005320/http://www.homesteadschools.com/nursing/courses/Immunity/Chapter05.html|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Alternating therapy===
Alternating therapy is a proposed method in which two or three antibiotics are taken in a rotation versus taking just one antibiotic such that bacteria resistant to one antibiotic are killed when the next antibiotic is taken. Studies have found that this method reduces the rate at which antibiotic resistant bacteria emerge in vitro relative to a single drug for the entire duration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim S, Lieberman TD, Kishony R | title = Alternating antibiotic treatments constrain evolutionary paths to multidrug resistance | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 40 | pages = 14494–9 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25246554 | pmc = 4210010 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1409800111 | bibcode = 2014PNAS..11114494K }}</ref>

===Development of new drugs===

Among the proposals:
* Create a 'robust, standing national clinical trials network for antibiotic testing' which will promptly enroll patients once identified to be suffering from dangerous bacterial infections. The network will allow testing multiple new agents from different companies simultaneously for their safety and efficacy.
* Establish a 'Special Medical Use (SMU)' pathway for FDA to approve new antimicrobial agents for use in limited patient populations, shorten the approval timeline for new drug so patients with severe infections could benefit as quickly as possible.
* Provide economic incentives, especially for development of new classes of antibiotics, to offset the steep R&D costs which drive away the industry to develop antibiotics.

Distinguishing infections requiring antibiotics from self-limiting ones is clinically challenging. In order to guide appropriate use of antibiotics and prevent the evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance, diagnostic tests that provide clinicians with timely, actionable results are needed.

Acute febrile illness is a common reason for seeking medical care worldwide and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In areas with decreasing malaria incidence, many febrile patients are inappropriately treated for malaria, and in the absence of a simple diagnostic test to identify alternative causes of fever, clinicians presume that a non-malarial febrile illness is most likely a bacterial infection, leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics. Multiple studies have shown that the use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests without reliable tools to distinguish other fever causes has resulted in increased antibiotic use.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hopkins H, Bruxvoort KJ, Cairns ME, Chandler CI, Leurent B, Ansah EK, Baiden F, Baltzell KA, Björkman A, Burchett HE, Clarke SE, DiLiberto DD, Elfving K, Goodman C, Hansen KS, Kachur SP, Lal S, Lalloo DG, Leslie T, Magnussen P, Jefferies LM, Mårtensson A, Mayan I, Mbonye AK, Msellem MI, Onwujekwe OE, Owusu-Agyei S, Reyburn H, Rowland MW, Shakely D, Vestergaard LS, Webster J, Wiseman VL, Yeung S, Schellenberg D, Staedke SG, Whitty CJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Impact of introduction of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria on antibiotic prescribing: analysis of observational and randomised studies in public and private healthcare settings | journal = BMJ | volume = 356 | pages = j1054 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28356302 | pmc = 5370398 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.j1054 }}</ref>

[[Phage therapy]] is the [[therapeutic]] use of [[bacteriophage]]s to treat [[pathogenic]] [[bacterial infection]]s.<ref name="Kohn">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/19/48hours/main522596.shtml|title=Silent Killers: Fantastic Phages?|access-date=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210183045/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/19/48hours/main522596.shtml|archive-date=10 February 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Phage therapy has many potential applications in human medicine as well as dentistry, veterinary science, and agriculture.<ref name="McAuliffe">{{cite book | chapter-url=http://www.highveld.com/pages2/phage.html | author=McAuliffe|display-authors=et al | chapter=The New Phage Biology: From Genomics to Applications" (introduction) | veditors=McGrath S, van Sinderen D | title=Bacteriophage: Genetics and Molecular Biology | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn=978-1-904455-14-1 | year=2007 }}</ref>

Phage therapy relies on the use of naturally-occurring bacteriophages to infect and lyse bacteria at the site of infection in a host.
