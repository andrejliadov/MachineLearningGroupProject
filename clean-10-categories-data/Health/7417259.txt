'''Dr Steevens' Hospital''' (also called '''Dr Steevens's Hospital''') ({{lang-ga|Ospidéal an Dr Steevens}}), one of Ireland's most distinguished eighteenth-century medical establishments, was located at [[Kilmainham]] in [[Dublin]] Ireland. It was founded under the terms of the will of Dr Richard Steevens, an eminent physician in Dublin. The seal of the hospital consisted of 'The Good Samaritan healing the wounds of the fallen traveller' with the motto beneath "Do Thou Likewise".<ref>D.A. Chart, The Story of Dublin (London, 1932), pp273</ref>

==History==
Madame [[Grizell Steevens]], who never married,<ref>D.A. Chart, The Story of Dublin (London, 1932), p.275</ref> was left an income by her brother Dr Richard Steevens (1653-1710), an eminent physician in Dublin. The income was from an estate in [[County Westmeath]] and [[County Offaly|King's County]] which gave her £600 per annum for her life. Dr Steevens' will had stated that the money was to be used to found a hospital after her death. She, however, decided to accelerate the process such that it happened during her life, and founded Dr Steevens' Hospital in 1720. One condition that she attached to her donation was that she should be allowed to live there, which she did for the rest of her life.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A short history of Steevens' Hospital|last=King|first=S. C.|year=1785}}</ref> The hospital was designed by Thomas Burgh<ref name="craig">{{cite book|title=Dublin 1660-1860|last=Craig|first=Maurice|isbn=1-905483-11-2|orig-year=1952|year=2006|pages=122–124}}</ref> and was built around a quaint old courtyard, with its arches forming a sort of cloister all around, and with peculiar attic windows that cut across the intersection of the roofs at each corner.<ref>D.A. Chart, The Story of Dublin (London, 1932), p.274</ref>

She was often to be seen walking the grounds closely veiled, which led to speculation among the local Dublin populace, that she had a face like the snout of a pig, and that for shame she would not let it be seen. This unpleasant appearance was said to be the result of a curse consequent to a petulant and unfeeling remark made by her mother when pestered by the importunities of a beggar woman, with a baby at her breast, and a tribe of children at her heels. Grizell said "Get away, you are like an old sow, with a litter of bonhams." The beggar retorted with the wish that the lady's next child might be like the animal to which she had been compared.<ref>D.A. Chart, The Story of Dublin (London, 1932), pp263-4</ref> The hospital was for long known as "Madame Steevens' Hospital".<ref name="craig"/>

In 1732, [[Edward Worth]], one of the most eminent Dublin physicians of his day, died and bequeathed to Steevens' Hospital £1,000 and his library, then valued at £5,000, together with £100 for fitting it up. The hospital built a specially designed room to house the Edward Worth Library, where it remains to this day under updated protective conditions.<ref name=edworthlib>{{cite web |url=http://edwardworthlibrary.ie/ |title=The Edward Worth Library |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2015 |website=Edwardworthlibrary.ie |access-date=2015-12-20 |quote=...[T]he website of the Edward Worth Library (1733).}}</ref>

In 1803, in the run-up to [[Robert Emmet|Robert Emmet's rebellion]], the victims of a powerful explosion at his ammunition depot in Patrick Street were brought to the hospital. They included Darby Byrne and one of the Keenans, who were blown up at the time of the explosion and died in the hospital afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/18th-19th-century-history/the-rising-of-1803-in-dublin/|title=The Rising of 1803 in Dublin|publisher=History Ireland|year=2003|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>

In 1857 the Dublin School of Medicine was transferred to Dr. Steevens' Hospital and renamed Steevens' Hospital Medical College.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jUqetmogGxEC&q=Steevens%27+Hospital+Medical+College+1857&pg=PA135|title=Charitable Words: Women, Philanthropy, and the Language of Charity in Nineteenth-Century Dublin|page=135|first=Margaret|last=Preston|year=2004|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0275979300}}</ref> The hospital closed in 1987<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dr-steevens-hospital-a-history.edwardworthlibrary.ie/|title=Dr Steevens' Hospital: 1733-1987|publisher=Dr Steevens' Hospital|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref> and subsequently became the administrative headquarters of the [[Health Service Executive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/news/media/pressrel/hse-s-dr-steevens-hospital-to-open-its-doors-for-culture-night.html|title=HSE's Dr Steevens' Hospital to open its doors for Culture Night|date=14 September 2018|publisher=Health Service Executive|access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>

==Records==
The hospital records are preserved and contain many curious entries, among others one as to the daily diet of a patient. The patient received around two quarts of small beer with his meals, because before tea and coffee came into general use, beer was almost the only alternative to water (which was often unclean).<ref>D.A. Chart, The Story of Dublin (London, 1932), pp274-5</ref> In recognition of this tradition, in the last days of the hospital operating as a hospital, Messrs. Arthur Guinness (a neighbour) provided Guinness beer in 1/3 pint bottles for all the patients and staff.<ref>personal recollections</ref>
