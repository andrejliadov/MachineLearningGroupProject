This is the '''list of 599 additives in [[cigarettes]]''' submitted to the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] in April 1994.<ref name=list/><ref name=599list>[https://www.verywell.com/big-tobaccos-list-of-599-cigarette-additives-2824422 599 Ingredients That Can Be Found in Cigarettes]. By Terry Martin. November 15, 2016.</ref><ref name=additives>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2040350 Pharmacological and Chemical Effects of Cigarette Additives]. ''[[American Journal of Public Health]].'' 2007 November; 97(11): 1981–1991. [[doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2005.078014]]. {{PMC|2040350}}. By Michael Rabinoff, DO, PhD, Nicholas Caskey, PhD, Anthony Rissling, MA, and Candice Park, BS. "the industry has acknowledged using 599 different cigarette additives."</ref><ref>[http://www.lung.org/stop-smoking/smoking-facts/whats-in-a-cigarette.html What's In a Cigarette?] [[American Lung Association]].</ref> It applies, as documented, only to American manufactured cigarettes intended for distribution within the United States by the listed companies. The five major [[tobacco company|tobacco companies]] that reported the information were:
* [[American Tobacco Company]]
* [[Brown and Williamson]]
* [[Liggett Group, Inc.]]
* [[Altria Group|Philip Morris Inc.]]
* [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]]

One significant issue is that while all these [[chemical compound]]s have been approved as [[food additive|additives to food]], they were not tested by [[combustion|burning]]. Burning changes the properties of chemicals. According to the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]]: "Of the more than 7,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, at least 250 are known to be harmful, including hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, and ammonia. Among the 250 known harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke, at least 69 can cause cancer."<ref name=69cancer>[https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/tobacco/cessation-fact-sheet Harms of Cigarette Smoking and Health Benefits of Quitting].
