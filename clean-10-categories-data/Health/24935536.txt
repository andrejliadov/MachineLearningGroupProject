'''Community health agent''' (''agente comunitário de saúde'' or ACS, in [[Portuguese language]]) is the title of a specific lay [[health care]] worker developed in [[Brazil]] by way of PACS (Program of Community Health Workers) in 1991 as part of the construction of the [[Sistema Único de Saúde|Brazilian Unified Health System]] established by [[Constitution]]al rule in 1988. 

The agent, which was said to be inspired on the [[barefoot doctor]]s program in [[China]], is not certified to practice [[medicine]] or [[nursing]], but has the primary task of gathering information on the health status of a small community by means of a close relationship with it. In the initial design, the agent should be one of the residents of a street, neighborhood or surrounding region, and was to be selected on the basis of a good relationship with his neighbors, in addition to the ability to devote eight hours a day to the work. Every agent is supervised by a [[physician|doctor]] or [[nurse]] of the health clinic, and home visits are conducted in the coverage area of a basic health unit, thus producing information that can assess the main health problems of his community.

With the proposition of the [[Brazilian Ministry of Health]] in 1994, when it created the a nationwide [[family health]] program, called PSF -- [[Programa de Saúde da Família]]—health community workers can be found in two different situations in relation to the health care system:

* Linked to a basic health unit not yet attached to the Family Health Program;
* Connected to a basic family health as a member of the [[multidisciplinary]] team.

Currently (October 2009), there are more than 260,000 community health agents present both in rural and peri-urban areas of small municipalities as well as in highly urbanized and industrialized cities.<ref>[http://www.datasus.gov.br DATASUS Statistical Data of Health in Brazil]</ref>
