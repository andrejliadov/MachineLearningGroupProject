The '''health risks of dead bodies''' are dangers related to the improper preparation and disposal of [[cadavers]].  While normal circumstances allow cadavers to be quickly [[Embalming|embalmed]], [[Cremation|cremated]], or [[Burial|buried]], [[List of disasters|natural and man-made disasters]] can quickly overwhelm and/or interrupt the established protocols for dealing with the dead.  Under such circumstances, the [[decomposition]] and [[putrefaction]] of cadavers goes unchecked, and raises a series of health, logistical, and psychological issues. After [[disaster]]s with extensive loss of life due to [[Physical trauma|trauma]] rather than disease&mdash;earthquakes, storms, human conflict, etc.&mdash;many resources are often expended on burying the dead quickly, and applying [[disinfectant]] to bodies for the specific purpose of preventing [[disease]]. Specialists say that spraying is a waste of disinfectant and manpower, that "resources that should be going into establishment of water supply, sanitation, shelter, warmth and hygienic food for the survivors are being applied to digging [[mass grave]]s", and that "Time and time again, eminent and authoritative experts have pointed out that dead bodies do not constitute a health hazard".<ref name=reliefweb/>

==False risks==
According to health professionals, the fear of spread of disease by bodies killed by trauma rather than disease is not justified. Among others, Steven Rottman, director of the [[UCLA]] [[UCLA School of Public Health|Center for Public Health and Disasters]], said that no scientific evidence exists that bodies of disaster victims increase the risk of [[epidemics]], adding that [[cadaver]]s posed less risk of [[Infectious disease|contagion]] than living people. In disasters involving trauma where there is competition for resources, efforts should be focused on establishment of water supply, [[sanitation]], shelter, warmth and hygienic food for the survivors, not digging [[mass grave]]s. Spraying is a waste of disinfectant and manpower. Indiscriminate burial of corpses demoralises survivors and the lack of death certificates can cause practical problems to survivors.<ref name=reliefweb>{{cite web |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/iran-islamic-republic/mass-burials-do-more-harm-good-experts |title=Mass burials do more harm than good-experts - Iran (Islamic Republic of) |website=reliefweb|date=30 Dec 2003|author= |accessdate= 30 July 2018}}</ref>
Other considerations which are very important, but not directly relevant to the topic of health risks, include religious and cultural practices, the stench, and the effect on morale.

===Roots of incorrect notion===
The incorrect notion that ''all'' dead bodies inherently cause [[disease]]s is consistent with:
#The incorrect historical [[miasma theory of disease]], which held that diseases are spread by [[Joseph Bazalgette|foul air]]&mdash;in this case fouled by the stench of decomposing corpses.
#Confusion between normal decay processes and signs of disease; and the incorrect idea that [[microorganisms]] responsible for decomposition are dangerous to living people. "Microorganisms involved in the decay process (putrefaction) are not pathogenic".<ref name=PAHO04/>
#After a major disaster disease among survivors is indeed a problem, but is actually due to living in harsh conditions with poor sanitation. "Survivors present a much more important reservoir for disease [than cadavers]".<ref name=PAHO04/>
#Noting that corpses of those who died from certain '''[[contagious disease]]s''' (for example, in epidemics) do, indeed, spread disease, such as is the case with [[ebola]], [[smallpox]], and the [[1918 flu]], and incorrectly generalising this to all corpses.

According to the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO) "concern that dead bodies are infectious can be considered a 'natural' reaction by persons wanting to protect themselves from disease"  although "the risk that bodies [of those killed in a natural disaster] pose for the public is extremely small".<ref name=PAHO04/>

==Real risks==
Contamination of water supplies by unburied bodies, burial sites, or temporary storage sites may result in the spread of [[gastroenteritis]] from normal intestinal contents.<ref>[https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/hygiene/emergencies/deadbodies.pdf Disposal of dead bodies in emergency conditions. WHO Technical Note 8]</ref>
According to a PAHO article on the Infectious Disease Risks From Dead Bodies Following Natural Disasters:<ref name=PAHO04>[http://publications.paho.org/english/dead_bodies.pdf Infectious Disease Risks From Dead Bodies Following Natural Disasters]</ref> {{cquote|There is little evidence of microbiological contamination of [[groundwater]] from burial. Where dead bodies have contaminated water supplies, gastroenteritis has been the most notable problem, although communities will rarely use a water supply where they know it to be contaminated by dead bodies. Microorganisms involved in the decay process (putrefaction) are not pathogenic.}}

To those in close contact with the dead, such as rescue workers, there is a health risk from chronic infectious diseases which those killed may have been suffering from and which spread by direct contact, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, HIV, enteric intestinal pathogens, tuberculosis, cholera and others.<ref name=PAHO04/>

The substances [[cadaverine]] and [[putrescine]] are produced during the [[decomposition]] of animal (including human) bodies, and both give off a foul odor.<ref>{{cite book | last =Lewis | first =Robert Alan | title =Lewis' Dictionary of Toxicology | publisher =CRC Press | year =1998 | isbn =1-56670-223-2 | page =[https://archive.org/details/lewisdictionaryo0000lewi/page/212 212] | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/lewisdictionaryo0000lewi/page/212 }}</ref><!--***Have commented out this reference as it seems irrelevant; there are 2 relevant refs not related to alternative medicine, ornithine, or weight loss. <ref>{{cite book | last =Kamhi | first =Ellen, [[Ph.D.]], [[Registered Nurse|RN]], HNC | title =Alternative Medicine Magazine's Definitive Guide to Weight Loss | publisher =Celestial Arts | date =2007 | isbn = 1-58761-259-3|quote=Ornithine is converted by bowel bacteria into a toxic substance called putrescine, which in turn degrades into polyamines, such as spermadine, spermine, and cadaverine (literally meaning "the essence of dead cadavers"). | page =14}}</ref>***--> They are toxic if massive doses are ingested ([[acute oral toxicity]] of 2&nbsp;g per kg of body weight of pure putrescine in rats, a larger dose for cadaverine); there are no effects at all for a tenth of that dose.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Til|first1=H.P.|last2=Falke|first2=H.E.|last3=Prinsen|first3=M.K.|last4=Willems|first4=M.I.|title=Acute and subacute toxicity of tyramine, spermidine, spermine, putrescine and cadaverine in rats|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology |volume=35|issue=3–4|year=1997|pages=337–348|issn=0278-6915|doi=10.1016/S0278-6915(97)00121-X|pmid=9207896}}</ref>  While figures for humans are not available, [[Allometry#Drug dose scaling|allometric scaling]], which takes into account body surface area, is often used to compare doses in different animals, with useful results.<ref name=allometric>{{cite web |url=http://clymer.altervista.org/minor/allometry.html |title=Allometric Scaling Calculator |newspaper=Clymer.altervista.org |date= 13 May 2012 |author= |accessdate= 15 December 2015}} Online allometric scaling calculator, with explanation and source.</ref> Scaling 2g/kg from rats suggests that a 60&nbsp;kg (132&nbsp;lb) person would be significantly affected by {{Convert|27|g}}<ref>Using allometric calculator cited, with rat weight=0.15kg, usual exponent of 0.75</ref>  of pure putrescine.
