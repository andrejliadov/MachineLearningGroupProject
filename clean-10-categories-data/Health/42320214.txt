{{short description|Nonprofit organization aimed at evaluating effects of social interventions}}
The '''Campbell Collaboration''' is a nonprofit organization that promotes evidence-based decisions and policy through the production of [[systematic review]]s and other types of evidence synthesis.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Vision and Mission |url=https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/about-campbell/vision-mission-and-principle.html |website=Campbell Collaboration |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> Campbell is composed of coordinating groups that coordinate the production of systematic reviews and evidence gap maps in the following areas: Business & Management, Climate Solutions, Crime & Justice, Disability, Education, International Development, Knowledge Translation & Implementation, Methods, and Social Welfare.<ref>{{cite web |title=Research Evidence |url=https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/better-evidence.html |website=Campbell Collaboration |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> It is a sister initiative of [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]], with secretariat staff in [[Oslo]] and [[New Delhi]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Contact Us |url=https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/contact/contact-us.html |website=Campbell Collaboration |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> 

Campbell reviews are published in ''Campbell Systematic Reviews'', an open access journal committed to publishing systematic reviews as well as methods research papers, and evidence and gap maps.<ref>{{cite web |title=Campbell Systematic Reviews |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/18911803 |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref> The Editor-In-Chief is [[Vivian Welch]] from the [[University of Ottawa]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Vivian Welch Appointed Campbell Collaboration Editor |url=https://www.bruyere.org/en/newsroom?newsid=1458 |accessdate=November 8, 2020 |agency=bruyere.org |date=February 8, 2017}}</ref>

==History==

The Campbell Collaboration was created as a result of a perceived need for an organization that would produce reviews of the evidence on the effectiveness of social interventions.<ref name="history">{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.campbellcollaboration.org/about-campbell/history.html |website=Campbell Collaboration |accessdate=21 October 2019 |ref=history}}</ref> An exploratory meeting in London in 1999 led to the establishment of the Campbell Collaboration in 2000 and an inaugural meeting at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, United States, on 24â€“25 February 2000.<ref name="history" />

The collaboration was named after the American psychologist [[Donald T. Campbell]] (1916-1996), a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in the United States.<ref name="history" />

In December 2004, the [[American Psychological Association]] published an article on the work of the Campbell Collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec04/null.aspx|title = The significance of null: A group of social scientists hunts down unpublished studies and aims to inform policy through thorough meta-analysis.|last = Dingfelder|first = Sadie|date = December 2004|accessdate = March 26, 2014|publisher = [[American Psychological Association]]}}</ref>

In May 2005, a special issue of the [[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] was devoted to describing what the evidence-based approach of the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] and Campbell Collaboration had uncovered.<ref>{{cite book|title = Place Randomized Trials: Experimental Tests of Public Policy (The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science Series) [Hardcover]|publisher = [[SAGE publications]]|date = May 1, 2005|isbn = 978-1412925815}}<!--|accessdate = March 26, 2014--></ref>

The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) and the [[University of Ottawa]] established the International Development Coordinating Group (IDCG) in May 2011.

There are two Campbell regional centres: Campbell UK & Ireland, established in 2016 and hosted at The Centre for Evidence and Social Innovation at [[Queen's University Belfast]] in the UK, and Campbell South Asia, established in New Delhi, India in 2019.

==Use by other organizations and policy influence==

Campbell reviews are used by organizations and policy-makers to inform decision-making based on research evidence. Charity evaluator and [[effective altruism]] advocate [[GiveWell]] had listed the Campbell Collaboration as one of its sources of information when trying to assess the state of evidence for various social policies and interventions in the United States and notes their value in determining susceptibility to publication bias of social programs.<ref name=holden-comment>{{cite web|url=http://www.givewell.org/united-states/process/sources-of-evidence|title = Criteria for evaluating U.S. programs|publisher = [[GiveWell]]|date = 2010|accessdate = March 26, 2014}}</ref> Campbell reviews have been used to inform policy implementation and guideline development in various countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=New publication: Campbell systematic reviews' policy impact cases |url=https://campbellcollaboration.org/news-and-events/news/campbell-reviews-policy-impact.html |website=Campbell Collaboration |accessdate=7 May 2020 |language=en-gb}}</ref>
