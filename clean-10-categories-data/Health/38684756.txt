== Life and career ==

Howard Clinebell was born in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], [[Illinois]] on June 3, 1922 to Howard J. and Clem (Whittenberg) Clinebell. He "graduated from [[DePauw University]] in [[Indiana]] and [[Garrett Theological Seminary]] in Illinois. He earned a doctorate at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]."<ref>{{cite web | last = Rourke | first = Mary | title = Howard Clinebell Jr., 83; Minister Advocated Combining Religion, Psychotherapy to Treat Addiction | year = 2005 | work = Los Angeles Times | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/14/local/me-clinebell14 | accessdate = 2 March 2013}}</ref> In addition he studied psychotherapy at the [[William Alanson White Institute]] in New York City.

In the mid-1950s Clinebell joined the staff at the First United Methodist Church in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. He went on to become counselor at Methodist Hospital in [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]]. In 1959 he joined the [[Claremont School of Theology|Claremont faculty]] as a professor of pastoral psychology. Clinebell retired in 1988.

Clinebell is author or co-author of more than 20 books of which the most influential are "Understanding and Counseling the Alcoholic Through Religion and Psychology" (1956) and "Basic Types of Pastoral Counseling" (1966, revised edition "Basic Types of Pastoral Care and Counseling" 1984). With his book on counseling of alcoholics Clinebell introduced the concept to view alcoholism as a disease rather than a character deficiency in religious circles. As one of the fathers of the  pastoral counseling movement Clinebell was an early advocate of training in psychotherapy for seminarians aiming to work as counselors. He was a founding member of the [[American Association of Pastoral Counselors]].

Besides pastoral counseling Clinebell addressed topics like personal problems in the context of relationships, the effects of social systems on individual lives, and the relationship of human beings to the environment.

Clinebell died April 13, 2005 of complications from Parkinson's disease at Vista del Monte Retirement Community in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].
