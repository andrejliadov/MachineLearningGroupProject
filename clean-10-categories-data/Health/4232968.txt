The '''Hôtel-Dieu''' ({{IPA-fr|otɛldjø}}) is a hospital located on the [[Île de la Cité]] in the [[4th arrondissement of Paris|4th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]], on the parvise of [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]]. It was supposedly founded by [[Landry of Paris|Saint Landry]] in 651 AD,<ref name="New Catholic Encyclopedia p. 127">{{cite book|title= New Catholic encyclopedia|year = 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OYpAQAAMAAJ|volume=7|page=127|isbn = 9780787640040}}</ref> making it the oldest hospital in the city and the oldest worldwide still operating. The Hôtel-Dieu was the only hospital in the city until the [[Renaissance]]. While the old Hôtel-Dieu stood by the [[Seine]] on the opposite side of the parvise, it was ravaged by fire several times, and was rebuilt for the last time at its present location between 1867 and 1878, as part of [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]].

Nowadays operated by [[Assistance publique – Hôpitaux de Paris]] (AP-HP), the Hôtel-Dieu is also a [[teaching hospital]] associated with the [[Paris Descartes University|Faculté de Médecine Paris-Descartes]].

==History==
===The old Hôtel-Dieu===

The Hôtel-Dieu was supposedly founded by [[Landry of Paris|Saint Landry]] in 651 AD, but its first recorded mention only dates back to 829.<ref name="New Catholic Encyclopedia p. 127"/> It is nonetheless considered to be the oldest hospital in the city<ref name="Pioneers">{{cite book|title=Milestones in Midwifery and the Secret Instrument|author=Radcliff, Walter|year=1989|publisher=Norman Publishing|isbn=9780930405205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73AEtDaG2RsC&q=%22h%C3%B4tel-dieu%22%20%2Bparis%20-wiki%20-hospitel&pg=PA19}}</ref> and the oldest worldwide still operating.

The history of Parisian hospitals dates from the [[Middle Ages]]. Poverty was widespread during that period, and the Hôtel-Dieu became an opportunity for many of the [[bourgeois]] and [[nobility]] to come to its aid. Their efforts allowed the construction of the [[Hôpital de la Charité]], which linked piety and medical care. Like many hospitals of that era, it started as a general institution catering for the poor and sick, offering food and shelter in addition to medical care.<ref name="London Science Museum">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/hoteldieu.aspx|publisher=London Science Museum|access-date=2009-09-14|title=Hotel Dieu}}</ref><ref name="17th-18th Century">{{cite web|title=L'Hôtel-Dieu de Paris au XVII et au XVIIIe siècle|language=fr|author=Fosseyeux, Marcel|publisher=Berger-Levrault|url=https://archive.org/stream/lhoteldieudepari00fossuoft#page/2/mode/2up}}</ref> The creation of the Hôtel-Dieu continued this tradition of charity up until the 19th century, despite being called into question during the centuries which followed.

[[File:Plan de Paris vers 1550 hotel-Dieu.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Old Hôtel-Dieu on the map of Truschet and Hoyau]]
In the 16th century the Hôtel-Dieu faced a financial crisis, as it was financed only by help, subsidies or privileges. This brought about the creation in 1505 of a council of laymen governors:<ref name="Pioneers"/> the Presidents of Parliament, the [[Court of Finances|Chambre des Comptes]], the [[Cour des aides|Cour des Aides]] and the [[Provost (civil)#France|Prévôt des Marchands]]. during the same century, Henry IV built [[Hôpital Saint-Louis]] to unclog the Hotel Dieu.

The 17th century elite created establishments to house the poor. Hospitals thus took the name of "''Hôpital Général''" (General hospital) or "''Hôpital d'enfermement''" ([[Insane asylum|Asylum]]), of which the Hôtel-Dieu was one. The centralized approach to extreme poverty in France was based on the premise that medical care was a right for those without family or income, and formalized the admission process in hospitals to prevent overcrowding and unsanitary conditions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mending bodies, Saving Souls: A History of Hospitals|last=Risse|first=Guenter B.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-19-505523-3|location=New York City|pages=301–302|quote="However, the Committee also realized that there were other good poor persons without family support for whom the hospital remained a necessary destination during illness. For such individuals, hospital care was to be a right"; "By restricting assistance to the truly needy, deinstitutionalization would also save money and curtail waste in the hospitals themselves. Equally important, this plan would prevent overcrowding and thus improve institutional hygiene."}}</ref> The [[Lieutenant général de police#List of lieutenant generals and prefects of police|Lieutenant Général de Police]] became a member of the ''Bureau de l’Hôtel-Dieu de Paris'' (Bureau for the Hôtel-Dieu in Paris) in 1690. The hospital extended across the river with building of the Rosary House surmounting the [[Pont au Double]].<ref>{{cite book|title=New Catholic encyclopedia|volume=7|page=139}}</ref>

In the 18th century, Paris hospitals in general were characterized with poor sanitation and treatment followed by high mortality rate. As [[Jacques-René Tenon|Jacques Tenon]] would note in his ''Mémoires sur les hôpitaux de Paris'' (1788), the sanitary conditions were horrendous, facilities were overcrowded and there was a high mortality rate in these hospitals. The Hôtel-Dieu was "the most unhealthy and uncomfortable of all hospitals", with a mortality rate of almost 25 percent. Even though it was the largest of Paris' hospitals with 1,200 beds, many beds held three or more patients—women gave birth in shared beds and there was no separation amongst patients with contagious diseases.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Science and the Practice of Medicine in the Nineteenth Century|last=Bynum|first=W.F.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780521272056|location=New York|pages=26–27}}</ref> The 1,200 beds in the hospital were completely inadequate for housing its over 3,500 patients.<ref name=":0" />

In 1772 a fire destroyed a large part of the Hôtel-Dieu.<ref name="London Science Museum"/> This event sparked discussions over the conditions and possible reforms that would be made to the hospital system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ares.library.jhu.edu/aresCMS/ares.dll?Action=10&Type=10&Value=295964|title=Mending Bodies, Saving Souls|last=Risse|first=Guenter B|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=295}}</ref>{{efn|The ideas advocated by the [[Age of Enlightenment]] also allowed reflection on hospitals.}} [[Louis XV]] ordered the demolition of the Hôtel-Dieu in 1773 after hearing of its poor patient conditions. The execution of the order was however delayed due to the King's death, and [[Louis XVI]], who succeeded him, was persuaded of an alternate plan to reconstruct the damaged parts of the hospital. This scheme was submitted to the Academy of Sciences for review, and debate regarding Hôtel-Dieu extended until 1785 as it transformed into discussions about the reformation of Paris's hospital system.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mending Bodies, Saving Souls|last=Risse|first=Guenter|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-19-505523-3|location=New York|pages=295}}</ref> Conditions enhanced in 1787, when the Hôtel-Dieu implemented a code of medical services that shifted the hospital from a curing machine run by nuns to a medical and surgical establishment run by doctors.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Mending Bodies, Saving Souls: A History of Hospitals|last=Risse|first=Guenter|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-19-505523-3|location=New York|pages=298}}</ref> [[Jacques Necker]] created the positions of ''Inspecteur général des hôpitaux civils et des maisons de force'' (General Inspector for civil hospitals and jails) and ''Commissaire du roi pour tout ce qui a trait aux hôpitaux'' (Royal Commissioner for all that relates to hospitals).

[[File:Desault and Bichat.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Pierre-Joseph Desault and Xavier Bichat]]
In the meantime, the Hôtel-Dieu had received a high status as a surgical training institution with the appointment of [[Pierre-Joseph Desault]] as ''chef de service'' in 1785. Desault established an elaborate educational program for surgical interns when previously they had only informal training.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Risse|first1=Guenter|title=Mending Bodies, Saving Souls: A History of Hospitals|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-505523-3|page=325}}</ref> By the 19th century hospitals had become places of teaching and medical research in addition to practicing medicine. [[Xavier Bichat]], a pupil of Desault, expounded on his new "membrane theory" during a course taught in 1801–1802 at the Hôtel-Dieu.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mending Bodies, Saving Souls: A History of Hospitals|year=1999|page=312|isbn=9780195055238|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22VnDAAAQBAJ|last1=Risse|first1=Guenter B.}}</ref>

In 1801, the Parisian hospitals adopted a new administrative framework: the ''Conseil général des hôpitaux et hospices civils de Paris'' (General Council for Parisian hospitals and civil [[hospice]]s). This willingness to improve management brought about the creation of new services: the ''Bureau d'admission '' (Admissions office) and the ''Pharmacie centrale ''(Central Pharmacy). [[Napoleon I]] finally rebuilt the portions of the Hôtel-Dieu which had burnt in 1772.<ref name="London Science Museum"/> Also during this period, the Hôtel-Dieu advocated the practice of [[vaccination]], of which [[François Alexandre Frédéric, duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt|Duc de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt]] was a fervent supporter. Similarly, the discoveries of [[René Laennec|René-Théophile-Hyacinthe Laennec]] permitted the refinement of methods of [[diagnosis]], [[auscultation]], and [[etiology (medicine)|aetiology]] of illnesses. The Pont au Double was demolished in 1847 and rebuilt without covering.

===Present Hôtel-Dieu===

The Hôtel-Dieu was rebuilt between 1867 and 1878 on the opposite side of the parvise of Notre Dame, as part of [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]] commissioned by [[Napoleon III]]. The reconstruction followed plans by architects Gilbert and Diet.

It was not until 1908 that the [[Augustinian nuns]] left the Hôtel-Dieu for good.

The Hôtel-Dieu is the top casualty centre to deal with emergency cases, being the only emergency centre for the first nine [[arrondissement]]s and being the local centre for the first four.<ref name="London Science Museum"/><ref name="AP-HP Hôtel-Dieu">{{cite web|title=AP-HP Hôtel-Dieu official site|language=fr|url=http://www.aphp.fr/index.php?module=hopital&action=hopitaux_detail&vue=hopital_detail&obj=20&H_ETAB=041}}</ref>

For the last 50 years it has been home to the [[diabetes]] and [[endocrine]] illnesses clinical department. It deals almost exclusively with the screening, treatment and prevention of the complications associated with [[diabetes mellitus]]. It is also a referral service for [[hypoglycemia]]. Oriented towards informing the patient (therapeutic education) and technological innovation, it offers a large choice of care facilities for all levels of complications. It is also at the forefront of research in diabetes in areas such as new [[insulin]]s and new drugs, effects of nutrition, external and implanted pumps, [[glucose]] sensors and [[artificial pancreas]].

More recently, a major department for [[ophthalmology]] (emergencies, surgery and research) has been developed at the Hôtel-Dieu, under the supervision of [[Yves Pouliquen]].
