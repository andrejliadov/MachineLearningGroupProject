[[File:Apple for Health - Apple with Stethoscope (16348686815).jpg|thumb|There is no validity to the proverb that apple consumption reduces illnesses]]
'''"An apple a day keeps the doctor away"''' is a common English-language [[proverb]]. There is no [[evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]] that eating an [[apple]] a day has any significant health effect.

==Origin==
A variant of the proverb, "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread" was recorded as a [[Pembrokeshire]] saying in 1866.<ref name="Davis2015">{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Matthew A.|last2=Bynum|first2=Julie P.

==Scientific evaluation==
A 2015 study found no evidence that the proverb was true: adult consumers of one small apple per day had the same number of physician visits as those who did not eat apples. The study also found that people who ate an apple a day used fewer [[prescription medication]]s.<ref name=Davis2015/> Other than for a moderate amount of [[carbohydrate]]s as [[fructose]] and [[dietary fiber]], a medium-size apple (182 g with skin) supplies 95 [[calorie]]s and 14% of the [[Daily Value]] for [[vitamin C]], but otherwise has a [[Apple#Nutrition|low content of micronutrients]].<ref name="nd">{{cite web |title=Apples, raw, with skin [Includes USDA commodity food A343]; medium apple, 182 g |url=https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1809/2 |publisher=Nutritiondata.com, Conde Nast; using data from version SR-21 of the USDA National Nutrient Database |accessdate=1 March 2020 |date=2018}}</ref>
