== Ablution in the Bible ==
[[Image:Lavabo2.jpg|thumb|A 14th-century [[lavabo]] as a [[niche (architecture)|niche]] recessed into the side wall of a sanctuary in [[Amblie]], [[Normandy]].]]
The [[Bible]] has many rituals of purification relating to [[menstruation]], [[childbirth]], [[religion and sexuality|sexual relations]], [[keri|nocturnal emission]], [[Zav|unusual bodily fluids]], [[Tzaraath|skin disease]], [[death]], and [[korban|animal sacrifice]]s. In the [[Old Testament]], ablution was considered a prerequisite to approaching God, whether by means of sacrifice, prayer, or entering a holy place.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|19:10}}, {{Bibleref2|Exodus|30:19–21}}, {{Bibleref2|Leviticus|8:6}},{{Bibleref2|Numbers|8:21}}, etc.</ref> 

The [[Bible]] includes various regulations about [[bathing]]:
:And whoever he that hath issue (a ''[[zav]]'', ejaculant with an unusual discharge) touches without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.({{bibleverse||Leviticus|15:11|}})
A subsequent seven clean days are then required, culminating in a ritual and temple offering before the ''zav'' is clean of his malady:
:Now in case the one having a running discharge would become clean from his running discharge, he must then count for himself seven days for his purification, and he must wash his garments and bathe his flesh in running water; and he must be clean. And on the eighth day he should take for himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and he must come to the entrance of the tent of meeting and give them to the priest.({{bibleverse||Leviticus|15:13–14|}})

And also references to hand-washing:
:I will wash my hands in innocence; so will I compass Thine altar, O LORD ({{bibleverse||Psalms|26:6|}})
[[Image:Fuente de Poblet 2.jpg|thumb|[[Lavabo]] in the [[Poblet Monastery]] in [[Spain]].]]
The [[Mikveh]] in the [[Bible]] is a [[bathing|bath]] used for the purpose of ritual immersion. The word is employed in its broader sense but generally means a collection of water.<ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia">{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia|title=MIḲWEH|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10827-mikweh|first1=Cyrus|last1=Adler|authorlink1=Cyrus Adler|first2=Julius H.|last2=Greenstone|authorlink2=|volume=8|page=588|accessdate=Feb 23, 2016}}</ref> Several biblical regulations specify that full immersion in water is required to regain [[ritual impurity|ritual purity]] after ritually impure incidents have occurred.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.religiousrules.com/Judaismpurity02general.htm |title=Concerning Ritual Purity and Cleanliness}}</ref> A person was required to be ritually pure in order to enter the Temple. In this context, "purity" and "impurity" are imperfect translations of the Hebrew [[Tumah and taharah|"tahara" and "tumah"]], respectively, in that the negative connotation of the word impurity is not intended; rather being "impure" is indicative of being in a state in which certain things are prohibited until one has become "pure" again by immersion in a mikveh.

After the [[destruction of the Temple]], the mikveh's main uses remained as follows:
* by women to achieve [[Niddah|ritual purity after menstruation or childbirth]] before she and her husband may resume marital relations;
* by men to achieve ritual purity;
* to immerse newly acquired utensils used in serving and eating food.

== Ablution in the Christian traditions ==
[[Image:Gondar Fasiladas Bath Timket.jpg|thumb|Crowds gather at the Fasiladas' bath in Ethiopia, to celebrate [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].]]
Traditionally, Christianity adhered to the biblical regulation requiring the purification of women after childbirth; this practice, was adapted into a special ritual known as the [[churching of women]], for which there exists liturgy in the [[Church of England]]'s [[Book of Common Prayer]], but its use is now rare in [[Western Christianity]]. The churching of women is still performed in a number of [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] churches ([[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches).

The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] prescribes several kinds of [[hand washing]] for example after leaving the latrine, lavatory or bathhouse, or before prayer, or after eating a meal.<ref>[http://pwtw.pl/wp-content/uploads/wst/12-2/Pedersen.pdf IS THE CHURCH OF ETHIOPIA A JUDAIC CHURCH ?]</ref> The women in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] are prohibited from entering the church temple during [[menses]]; and the men do not enter a church the day after they have had intercourse with their wives.<ref>[http://www.eotc.faithweb.com/liturgy.htm The Liturgy of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]</ref>

[[Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Lutheran]]s and [[High church]] [[Anglican]]s are also traditionally required to regularly attend [[Confession (religion)|confession]], as a form of ritual purification from [[sin]], especially as [[Eucharistic discipline|preparation before]] receiving the [[Eucharist]]. For Catholics, this is required at least once a year and required for those who are guilty of unconfessed [[mortal sin]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 989 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3H.HTM |access-date=1 May 2017 |publisher=Vatican.va}}</ref>

In [[Reformed]], [[ritual purity]] is achieved through the Confession of Sins, and Assurance of Forgiveness, and [[Sanctification]]. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, believers offer their whole being and labor as a 'living sacrifice'; and cleanliness becomes a way of life (See Romans 12:1, and John 13:5–10 (the Washing of the Feet).

In the [[Roman Rite]], the celebrant washes his hands before vesting for [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], but with another prayer (''[[Vesting Prayers|Da, Domine, virtutem]]''). This is said privately in the [[vestry]]. He will then wash his hands again after the [[offertory]]—this is the ceremony that is known as the ''lavabo'' proper. This washing appears in both the [[Tridentine Mass]], the 1962 edition of which is still an authorized [[Summorum Pontificum|extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]]), and in the post-Vatican II Mass. The reason for this "second" washing of hands probably developed from the long ceremony of receiving the loaves and vessels of wine from the people at the offertory that was used in Rome.<ref>[[Louis Duchesne|Duchesne, Louis]], ''Origines du Culte chretien'' (Paris, 1898), 167, 443.</ref> In the [[Gallican Rite]] the offerings were prepared before Mass began, as in the Eastern [[Liturgy of Preparation]], so there was no long version of the offertory nor place for a lavabo before the Eucharistic Prayer. In the [[Middle Ages]], the Roman Rite actually had two washing of hands, one before and one after the offertory. This first one has since disappeared, and the one which remains is the second.<ref>{{Citation

In the [[Tridentine Mass]] and in the similar [[Anglo-Catholic]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], the term "ablutions" refers to when the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] rinses his hands first in wine and then in water following the Communion. It is to be distinguished from the [[lavabo]], when the celebrant washes his hands with water only, reciting the words of {{bibleref2|Psalm|26:6–12|KJV}} (KJV—in the [[Septuagint]] it is Psalm 25) at the [[offertory]].

In the [[Mass of Paul VI]] and the [[Anglican]] [[Eucharist]] the priest does not normally use wine to wash his hands at the ablution, although this is permitted, but only water.

''[[Agpeya]]'', ''[[Shehimo]]'').<ref name="Smith1909">{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Bertha H. |title=The Bath as a Religious Rite among Mohammedans |journal=Modern Sanitation |date=1909 |volume=7 |issue=1 |publisher=Standard Sanitary Mfg.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek-Catholic]] Churches, the term "ablution" refers to consuming the remainder of the Gifts (the Body and Blood of Christ) at the end of the [[Divine Liturgy]]. [[Holy Communion]] is always received in both Species (the Body and the Blood of Christ) not only by the clergy but also by the faithful. This is accomplished by placing the particles of the consecrated [[Lamb (Liturgy)|Lamb]] (bread) into the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]], and distributing Communion to the faithful with a spoon. The portion which remains in the chalice afterwards must be consumed.

The ablutions will normally be performed by the [[deacon]], but if no deacon is serving the priest will do them. After the [[Ektenia|Litany]] of Thanksgiving that follows Communion, the deacon will come into the [[Altar|sanctuary]] and kneel, placing his forehead on the [[Holy Table]] (Altar) and the priest will bless him to consume the Gifts, which is done at the [[Prothesis (altar)|Prothesis]] (Table of Oblation). First, using the [[Spoon (liturgy)|liturgical spoon]] he will consume all of the Body and Blood of Christ which remain in the chalice. Then he will pour hot water on the [[diskos]] (paten), which is then poured into the chalice and consumed (this is to consume any particles that may remain on the diskos). Next the [[Spear (liturgy)|liturgical spear]], spoon and chalice will be rinsed first with wine and then with hot water, which are then consumed. All of the sacred vessels are then wiped dry with a towel, wrapped in their cloth coverings and put away.

Because the ablutions necessarily require consuming the [[Holy Mysteries]] (the [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ]]), a priest or deacon may only perform them after having fully prepared himself through [[fasting]] and the lengthy [[Eucharistic discipline#Eastern Orthodox practice|Preparation for Holy Communion]].

When a priest must take Holy Communion to the sick or homebound, if he has not prepared himself to receive the Holy Mysteries, he may ablute the chalice by pouring water into it and asking the one to whom he brought the Sacrament (or a Baptized child who because of their youth is not obliged to prepare for Communion) to consume the ablution.

If the [[Reserved Mysteries]] should become moldy, they must still be consumed in the same manner as the ablutions after Liturgy (normally, a fair amount of wine would be poured over them before consuming them, in order to soften and disinfect them). They should not be burned or buried. To prevent this, when the Mysteries are to be reserved for the sick, they should be thoroughly dried before being placed in the [[Church tabernacle|Tabernacle]].

==Baptismal ablutions==
{{main|Baptism}}

In [[Orthodox Christianity]], there is also an ablution performed on the eighth day after [[Baptism]]. Immediately after being Baptized, every person, including an infant, is [[Confirmation|confirmed]] using the Mystery (Sacrament) of [[Chrismation]]. In the [[early church]], the places where the person was anointed with [[Chrism]] were carefully bandaged, and were kept covered for eight days. During this period, the newly illumined (newly baptized person) would also wear his baptismal robe every day. At the end of the eight days, the priest would remove the bandages and [[baptismal garment]] and perform ablutions over him. While the bandaging no longer takes place, the ritual ablutions are still performed.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pomazansky |first=[[Protopresbyter]] Michael |year=1948 |title=Orthodox Dogmatic Theology |page=270 |place=Platina, CA |publisher=Saint Herman of Alaska Brotherhood |id=LOC # 84-051294}}
</ref>

The newly illumined (newly baptized person) is brought back to the church by his [[Godparents]] for the ablutions. The priest stands him in the center of the church, in front of the [[Royal Doors|Holy Doors]], facing east. He loosens the belt of the baptismal robe and prays for him, that God may preserve the newly illumined in purity and illumine him by grace. He then dips a sponge in water and sprinkles him in the sign of the cross saying: "Thou art justified. Thou art illumined. Thou art sanctified. Thou art washed: in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen." Then, as he says the next prayer, he washes each of the places where he had been anointed with [[Chrism]]. Next he performs the [[Tonsure#Eastern Christianity|Tonsure]], symbolic of the life of self-sacrifice a Christian must lead.

==Washing of feet==
{{main|Maundy (foot washing)}}
[[File:Bishop Sebouh - Washing of Feet.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] [[Maundy (foot washing)|washing the feet]] of children.]]
Many Christian churches practice a ceremony of the Washing of Feet,<ref name="common">{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dyWqm3hCMC0C&q=Triduum+Maundy&pg=PA113|title = The Companion to the Book of Common Worship|author=Peter C. Bower|date = January 2003|publisher = [[Geneva Press]]|isbn = 9780664502324|quote=Maundy Thursday (or ''le mandé''; Thursday of the ''Mandatum'', Latin, commandment). The name is taken from the first few words sung at the ceremony of the washing of the feet, "I give you a new commandment" (John 13:34); also from the commandment of Christ that we should imitate His loving humility in the washing of the feet (John 13:14–17). The term ''mandatum'' (maundy), therefore, was applied to the rite of foot-washing on this day.|accessdate = 2009-04-11}}</ref> following the example of Jesus in the Gospel.{{bibleref2c|John|13:1–17}} Some interpret this as an [[Ordinance (Christian)|ordinance]] which the church is obliged to keep as a commandment, see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].<ref name="common" /> Others interpret it as an example that all should follow. Most denominations that practice the rite will perform it on [[Maundy Thursday]]. Often in these services, the [[bishop]] will wash the feet of the clergy, and in [[monastery|monasteries]] the [[Abbot]] will wash the feet of the brethren.

St. [[Benedict of Nursia]] lays out in his [[Rule of St. Benedict|Rule]] that the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140924055251/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/benedict/rule2/files/rule2.html#ch53#ch53 feet of visitors] to the monastery should be washed, and also that those who are assigned to serve in the kitchen that week should [https://web.archive.org/web/20140924055251/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/benedict/rule2/files/rule2.html#ch35#ch35 wash the feet] of all the brethren. At one time, most of the European monarchs also performed the Washing of Feet in their royal courts on [[Maundy Thursday]], a practice continued by the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian Emperor]] and the [[King of Spain]] up to the beginning of the 20th century (see [[Royal Maundy]]).<ref name="Washing of Hands and Feet">{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Washing of Feet and Hands}}</ref>

Foot washing is also observed by numerous [[Protestant]] and proto-Protestant groups, including [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Pentecostal]], and [[Pietism|Pietistic]] groups, some [[Anabaptist]]s, and several types of [[Southern Baptists]]. 
Foot washing rites are also practiced by many [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]] and [[Methodist]] churches, whereby foot washing is most often experienced in connection with [[Maundy Thursday]] services and, sometimes, at ordination services where the [[Bishop]] may wash the feet of those who are to be ordained. Though history shows that foot washing has at times been practiced in connection with baptism, and at times as a separate occasion, by far its most common practice has been in connection with the [[The Lord's Supper|Lord's supper]] service.  The [[Moravian Church]] practiced [[Foot Washing]] until 1818. There has been some revival of the practice as other liturgical churches have also rediscovered the practice.<ref name="Ritter1857">{{cite book |last1=Ritter |first1=Abraham |title=History of the Moravian Church in Philadelphia: from its foundation in 1742 to the present time : comprising notices, defensive of its founder and patron, Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorff, together with an appendix |url=https://archive.org/details/historymoravian01rittgoog |date=1857 |publisher=Hayes & Zell |language=en}}</ref>

==Ablutions for the dead==
When an [[Orthodox Christian]] dies, his body is washed and dressed before burial. Although this custom is not considered to impose any sort of ritual purity, it is an important aspect of charitable care for the departed. Ideally, this should not be deferred to an undertaker, but should be performed by family members or friends of the deceased.

When an Orthodox priest or bishop dies, these ablutions and vesting are performed by the clergy, saying the same prayers for each [[Vestments|vestment]] that are said when the departed bishop or priest vested for the [[Divine Liturgy]]. After the body of a Bishop is washed and vested, he is seated in a chair and the [[Dikirion|Dikirion and Trikirion]] are placed in his hands for the final time.<ref>{{Citation

When an Orthodox [[monk]] dies, his body is washed and clothed in his monastic habit by brethren of his monastery. Two significant differences are that when his [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]] is placed on him, its hem is torn to form bands, with which his body is bound (like [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] in the tomb), and his [[klobuk]] is placed on his head backwards, so that the [[Epanokamelavkion|monastic veil]] covers his face (to show that he had already died to the world, even before his physical death). When an Orthodox [[nun]] dies, the sisterhood of her convent performs the same ministrations for her as are done for monks.

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Absoute]] (or ''absolution of the dead'') is a symbolic ablution of the deceased's body following the [[Requiem Mass]]. While specific prayers are said, the coffin is [[incense]]d and sprinkled with [[holy water]]. The absolution of the dead is only performed in context of the [[Tridentine Mass]]. Following the [[Second Vatican Council]], the absolution of the dead was removed from the funeral liturgy of the [[Mass of Paul VI]].

== Washing and anointing ==
{{see also|Washing and anointing}}
[[File:Washing and anointing tub in the Salt Lake Temple, June 1911.png|thumb|One of ten washing and anointing rooms of the [[Salt Lake Temple]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] circa 1911.]]
[[Washing and anointing]] (also called the ''initiatory'') is a [[Temple (LDS Church)#Temple ordinances|temple ordinance]] practiced by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[LDS Church]]) and [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalists]] as part of the faith's [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] ceremony. It is a [[purification ritual]] for adults, usually performed at least a year after [[baptism]]. The ordinance is performed by the authority of the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] by an officiator of the same sex as the participant.<ref name = buerger35>{{Harvtxt|Buerger|1987|p=35}}.</ref> 

In the ritual, a person is sprinkled with water to symbolically wash away the "blood and sins of this generation." After the washing, the person is then anointed to become a "king and priest" or a "queen and priestess" in the afterlife.

Once washed and anointed, the participant is dressed in the [[temple garment]], a religious undergarment which the participant is instructed to wear throughout his or her life. (Since 2005, participants in the LDS Church version of the ritual already come clothed in this garment prior to the washing and anointing.) Finally, the participant is given a "new name" which he or she is instructed never to reveal except under certain conditions in the temple.

Mormons link the ritual to biblical washings and anointings. The temple garment symbolizes the skins of clothing given to [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], and the "new name" is linked to Revelation 2:17, which states that God will give those who overcome "a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it."
