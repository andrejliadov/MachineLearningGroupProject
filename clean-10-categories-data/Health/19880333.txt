The '''American Society for Nutrition''' (ASN) is an American society for professional researchers and practitioners in the field of [[nutrition]]. ASN publishes four journals in the field of nutrition.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nutrition.org/publications/}}</ref> It has been criticized for its financial ties to the food and beverage industry.<ref name="EatDrink Politics"/><ref name=eng>{{Cite web| last = Eng| first = Monica| title = Should Coke sponsor nutrition research?| work = WBEZ| accessdate = 2018-08-23| url = https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/do-big-food-companies-have-too-much-sway-over-nutrition-research/43df1b4d-259b-4d15-a85f-59b77232068d}}</ref>

== History ==

In 1928 a group of United States biochemists and physiologists grouped together to form the first scientific society focused on nutrition, the American Institute for Nutrition. The Society held its first meeting at the [[Cornell Medical School]] in 1934.   The society was renamed the American Society for Nutritional Sciences in 1996.<ref name="Vanderbilt University Medical Center">{{cite web | url=http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/diglib/sc_diglib/americansociety/index.html | title=The Nutrition Society Celebrates Its 75th Anniversary | publisher=Vanderbilt University Medical Center | accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref>

In 2005, the American Society for Nutritional Sciences, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition (established 1961);  and the Society for International Nutrition (established 1996) merged to form The American Society for Nutrition (ASN).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

ASN currently (2015) has a membership of about 5,000.  It is one of the constituent societies comprising the  [[Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology]], a non-profit organization that is the principal umbrella organization of U.S. societies in the field of biological and medical research.<ref name="Vanderbilt University Medical Center"/>

In October 2010, the [[American College of Nutrition]] and American Society for Nutrition proposed to merge.<sup>[[American College of Nutrition#cite note-2|[2]]]</sup>{{Update inline|date=August 2018}}

== Publications ==
ASN owns four academic journals, and occasionally uses them to self-publish content independent of the journal's editorial review process.<ref name=about_CDN /> Some of the journals' editorial staff accept funding from food industry organizations.<ref name="EatDrink Politics"/><ref name=eng/> As of 2018, the ASN-run journals are printed by the [[Oxford University Press]].<ref>{{cite web |title=American Society for Nutrition Journals {{!}} Oxford Academic |url=https://academic.oup.com/asn |website=OUP Academic |language=en}}</ref>
