'''Bellelay Abbey''' is a former [[Premonstratensian]] monastery in the [[Bernese Jura]] in [[Switzerland]], now a psychiatric clinic.  It is a [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage site of national significance]] and the entire former Abbey complex is part of the [[Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.html |title=Kantonsliste A-Objekte |year=2009 |work=KGS Inventar |publisher=Federal Office of Civil Protection |language=German |accessdate=25 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628110559/http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.html |archivedate=28 June 2010 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Bellelay.jpg|thumb|left|Bellelay Abbey complex]]
[[File:bellelay for wiki 2.gif|thumb|left|Arms of Bellelay]]
[[File:ETH-BIB-Bellelay-LBS H1-014833.tif|thumb|Aerial view (1953)]]
According to the legend, the monastery was founded in 1136 by Siginand, prior of the abbey of [[Moutier|Moutier-Grandval]], who got lost in the deep forest of the High Jura while hunting a wild boar and was unable to find his way out.<ref name=HDS>{{HDS|8492|Bellelay Abbey}}</ref> He vowed to found a monastery if he managed to return safely to Moutier, which he did four days later. To the monastery he founded in accordance with his vow he gave the name of "belle laie" ("laie" is a female wild boar).

According to other sources, the monastery was probably founded as a result of the influence of the [[Bishop of Basel]] on the south-west border of the diocese of Basel with the territory of the Abbot of Moutier-Grandval.<ref name=HDS/>

The foundation was confirmed by [[Pope Innocent II]] in 1142.<ref name=Abbey>[http://www.abbatialebellelay.ch/index.php?id=14&lang=de Fondation de l'abbatiale de Bellelay] {{in lang|fr|de}}</ref> There are numerous spelling variations from the early years of the monastery: Balelaia, Belelagia, Belelai, Belilaia, Bellale, Bella Lagia, Bellelagia and Bellilagia. The name comes from the [[Vulgar Latin]] ''bella lagia'' ("beautiful forest").

The abbey possessed various estates widely scattered. It was the mother-house of several other foundations, including Grandgourt Priory, [[Gottstatt Abbey]] and Himmelspforte Abbey at [[Grenzach-Wyhlen]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]].<ref name=HDS/>

Bellelay was under the authority of the diocese of Basel, but operated as an independent lordship under the terms of a protection contract agreed with [[Bern]] and [[Solothurn]] (by 1414 at the latest) and also with [[Biel/Bienne|Biel]] in 1516.

Although the abbot had the right of the [[High, middle and low justice|low justice]] in the abbey's immediate territory, and was awarded the right to the use of the ring, the mitre and the cross at the [[Council of Constance]] in 1414, it does not seem that Bellelay was ever an [[Imperial abbey]].

The buildings were ransacked during the [[Swabian War]] in 1499. During the [[Protestant Reformation]] some of the residents converted to the new faith.  However, thanks to the treaty with Solothurn the monastery was spared the effects of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The abbey reached its golden age in the 18th century as a renowned place of education for the sons of European nobility.  During the 18th century the monastery buildings were rebuilt and a new church building was dedicated in 1714.  The monastery university opened in 1772 and by 1779 it had 62 pupils from throughout Europe.  A new dormitory wing was added in 1782 to accommodate the growing student population and by 1797 there were about 100 students at Bellelay.<ref name=HDS/>

==Dissolution==
In 1797 the buildings were occupied by [[France|French troops]] and secularised. The precious furnishings were sold at this time – an altar from Bellelay, for example, is now to be found in the parish church of Our Lady of the Assumption in [[Saignelégier]].

In the 19th century the monastery premises were used as a watch factory, then as a brewery and finally as a glass factory. In 1890 the [[Canton of Bern]] acquired the site, from which time the monastery buildings have been used as a psychiatric clinic.

Since the end of the 1960s the premises have also been used for concerts and exhibitions by the ''Fondation de l'Abbatiale de Bellelay''.

== Architecture ==
[[File:Bellelay for wiki 1.png|thumb|250px|Painting on stucco]]
The present structure of the abbey church of the Assumption was built by [[Franz Beer]] on the [[Vorarlberg]] [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] model between 1708 and 1714. The church has two towers on the west front which formerly had [[onion domes]]. The interior is decorated with painted stucco by the [[Wessobrunner School|Wessobrunn School]], created in 1713. The other monastery buildings in the [[Baroque]] style are also from the 18th century.

==Tête de Moine==
Bellelay Abbey is the home of the cheese [[Tête de Moine]], first made by the monks in the 12th century.<ref>[http://www.tetedemoine.ch/en/history/historical-notes Tête de Moine website]</ref>
