A '''dentist''', also known as a '''dental surgeon''', is a [[surgeon]] who specializes in [[dentistry]], the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases and conditions of the [[mouth|oral cavity]]. The dentist's [[Dental auxiliary|supporting team]] aids in providing oral health services. The dental team includes [[dental assistant]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s, [[dental technician]]s, and sometimes [[dental therapist]]s.

==History==

===Middle Ages===
In China as well as France, the first people to perform [[dentistry]] were barbers. They have been categorized into 2 distinct groups: guild of barbers and lay barbers. The first group, the Guild of Barbers, was created to distinguish more educated and qualified dental surgeons from lay barbers. Guild barbers were trained to do complex surgeries. The second group, the lay barbers, were qualified to perform regular hygienic services such as shaving and tooth extraction as well as basic surgery. However, in 1400, France made decrees prohibiting lay barbers from practicing all types of surgery. In Germany as well as France from 1530 to 1575 publications completely devoted to dentistry were being published. [[Ambroise Paré]], often known as the Father of Surgery, published his own work about the proper maintenance and treatment of teeth. Ambroise Paré was a French barber surgeon who performed dental care for multiple French monarchs. He is often credited with having raised the status of barber surgeons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ambroise Pare|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/ambroisepare.aspx|website=Science Museum Brought to Life|access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of Dentistry Timeline|url=http://www.ada.org/en/about-the-ada/ada-history-and-presidents-of-the-ada/ada-history-of-dentistry-timeline|website=American Dental Association|access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref>

[[Pierre Fauchard]] of France is often referred to as the "father of modern dentistry" for being the first to publish a scientific textbook (1728) on the techniques and practices of dentistry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pierre Fauchard: the 'Father of Modern Dentistry'|url=http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v201/n12/full/4814350a.html|website=British Dental Journal}}</ref> Over time, trained dentists immigrated from Europe to the Americas to practice dentistry, and by 1760, America had its own native born practicing dentists. Newspapers were used at the time to advertise and promote dental services. In America from 1768 to 1770 the first application of dentistry to verify forensic cases was being pioneered; this was called [[forensic dentistry]]. With the rise of dentists there was also the rise of new methods to improve the quality of dentistry. These new methods included the spinning wheel to rotate a drill and chairs made specifically for dental patients.<ref name="History of Dentistry Timeline">{{cite web|title=History of Dentistry Timeline|url=http://www.ada.org/en/about-the-ada/ada-history-and-presidents-of-the-ada/ada-history-of-dentistry-timeline|website=American Dental Association}}</ref>

In the 1840s the world's first dental school and national dental organization were established. Along with the first dental school came the establishment of the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree, often referred to as a DDS degree. In response to the rise in new dentists as well as dentistry techniques, the first dental practice act was established to regulate dentistry. In the United States, the First Dental Practice Act required dentists to pass each specific states medical board exam in order to practice dentistry in that particular state. However, because the dental act was rarely enforced, some dentists did not obey the act. From 1846 to 1855 new dental techniques were being invented such as the use of ester anesthesia for surgery, and the cohesive gold foil method which enabled gold to be applied to a cavity. The [[American Dental Association]] was established in 1859 after a meeting with 26 dentists. Around 1867, the first university associated dental school was established, Harvard Dental School. [[Lucy Hobbs Taylor]] was the first woman to earn a dental degree. 

In the 1880s, tube toothpaste was created which replaced the original forms of powder or liquid toothpaste. New dental boards, such as the National Association of Dental Examiners, were created to establish standards and uniformity among dentists.<ref name="History of Dentistry Timeline"/> In 1887 the first dental laboratory was established; dental laboratories are used to create dentures and crowns that are specific to each patient.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dental Laboratory Technology|url=http://www.ada.org/en/education-careers/careers-in-dentistry/dental-team-careers/dental-laboratory-technology|website=American Dental Association}}</ref> In 1895 the dental X-ray was discovered by a German physicist, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen – Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1901/rontgen-bio.html|website=Nobelprize.org}}</ref>
[[File:Mary Crutchfield Thompson (13270319163).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mary Crutchfield Thompson]] was one of the first Black women to graduate from Tufts University Dental School, and the first to practice dentistry in the Boston area. ]]
In the 20th century new dental techniques and technology were invented such as: the porcelain crowns (1903), Novocain (a local anesthetic) 1905, precision cast fillings (1907), nylon toothbrushes (1938), [[water fluoridation]] (1945), fluoride [[toothpaste]] (1950), air driven dental tools (1957), lasers (1960), electric toothbrushes (1960), and home tooth bleaching kits (1989) were invented. Inventions such as the air driven dental tools ushered in a new high-speed dentistry.<ref name="History of Dentistry Timeline"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Dental Technology Over 150 Years: Evolution and Revolution|url=http://mydigimag.rrd.com/article/Dental+Technology+Over+150+Years%3A+Evolution+and+Revolution+/1614009/0/article.html|website=Journal of the Massachusetts Dental Society}}</ref>

==Responsibilities==
[[File:dentistpatient.jpg|thumb|300px|A dentist in Finland treating a child]]
[[File:DENTISTREATINGOLDMAN.jpg|thumb|Dentist treating old man, Argentina]]
By nature of their general training, a licensed dentist can carry out most dental treatments such as restorative ([[dental restorations]], [[crown (dentistry)|crowns]], [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]]), orthodontics ([[Dental braces|braces]]), prosthodontic ([[dentures]], [[Crown (dentistry)|crown]]/bridge), endodontic ([[root canal]]) therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and [[oral surgery]] (extraction of teeth), as well as performing examinations, taking radiographs (x-rays) and diagnosis. Additionally, dentists can further engage in oral surgery procedures such as [[dental implant]] placement. Dentists can also prescribe medications such as [[antibiotic]]s, [[fluoride]]s, [[pain killer]]s, [[local anesthetic]]s, [[sedative]]s/[[hypnotic]]s and any other medications that serve in the treatment of the various conditions that arise in the head and neck.

All DDS and DMD degree holders are legally qualified to perform a number of more complex procedures such as [[gingival graft]]s, [[bone grafting]], [[sinus lift]]s, and [[dental implant|implants]], as well as a range of more invasive [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]] procedures, though many choose to pursue residencies or other post-doctoral education to augment their abilities. A few select procedures, such as the administration of [[General anesthesia]], legally require postdoctoral training in the US. While many oral diseases are unique and self-limiting, poor conditions in the oral cavity can lead to poor general health and vice versa; notably, there is a significant link between periodontal and cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.perio.org/consumer/gum-disease-and-heart-disease|title=Gum Disease and Heart Disease - Perio.org|website=www.perio.org}}</ref> Conditions in the oral cavity may also be indicative of other systemic diseases such as osteoporosis, diabetes, AIDS, and various blood diseases, including malignancies and lymphoma.

Several studies have suggested that dentists and dental students are at high risk of burnout. During burnout, dentists experience exhaustion, alienate from work and perform less efficiently.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=pmhdev|date=2017-01-12|title=Depression: What is burnout?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072470/|journal=PubMed Health}}</ref> A systemic study identified risk factors associated with this condition such as practitioner's young age, personality type, gender, status of education, high job strain and / or working hours, and the burden of clinical degrees requisites. The authors of this study concluded that intervention programs at an early stage during the undergraduate level may provide practitioners with a good strategy to prepare for / cope with this condition.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1093/occmed/kqv119|pmid=26443193|title=Systematic review: Factors contributing to burnout in dentistry|journal=Occupational Medicine|volume=66|issue=1|pages=27–31|year=2016|last1=Singh|first1=P|last2=Aulak|first2=D.

== Regulations ==
Depending on the country, all dentists are required to register with their national or local health board, regulators and a professional indemnity insurance, in order to practice dentistry. In the UK, dentists are required to register with the General Dental Council. In Australia, it is the Dental Board of Australia, while in the United States, dentists are registered according to the individual state board. The main role of a dental regulator is to protect the public by ensuring only qualified dental practitioners are registered, handle any complaints or misconduct and develop national guidelines and standard for dental practitioners to follow. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dentalboard.gov.au/About-the-Board.aspx|title=Dental Board of Australia – About|website=www.dentalboard.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref>
