The '''male-female health-survival paradox''', also known as the '''morbidity-mortality paradox''' or '''gender paradox''', is the phenomenon in which women experience more [[medical conditions]] and [[disability]] during their lives, but they unexpectedly [[Live longer|live longer]] than men.  It is considered a [[paradox]] because of the normal assumption that sicker people will die sooner than people who experience less disease and disability.  In this case, however, the group of people that experiences the most disease and disability is the one that lives the longest.

Records of the female survival advantage can be traced back to the 18th century, but gained popularity and caught the eyes of researchers in the 19th century.

== Female survival advantage ==

A female survival advantage is found in some, but not all species.

== Influential factors ==

=== Risky behaviors ===
Despite men having more fatal conditions, women have more non-fatal [[acute (medicine)|acute]] and [[chronic condition]]s.<ref> Chloe E. Bird, Patricia P. Rieker. [https://books.google.bs/books?id=3pNpyBMyO_MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=mortality+morbidity+paradox&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwioh4-I4LTgAhXst1kKHbV6CToQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=mortality%20morbidity%20paradox&f=false "Gender and Health: The Effects of Constrained Choices and Social Policies"]. page 1.</ref> 

Different rates of [[alcohol]] and [[tobacco]] usage by men and women contribute to the paradox in [[developed countries]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00038-012-0361-1 |pmid=22618297 |pmc=3557379 |title=Gender differences in healthy life years within the EU: An exploration of the "health–survival" paradox |journal=International Journal of Public Health |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=143–155 |year=2013 |last1=Van Oyen |first1=Herman |last2=Nusselder |first2=Wilma |last3=Jagger |first3=Carol |last4=Kolip |first4=Petra |last5=Cambois |first5=Emmanuelle |last6=Robine |first6=Jean-Marie }}</ref>   It has also been stated that men experience [[smoking]]-related conditions more than women.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Case|first1=Anne|last2=Paxson|first2=Christina H.|year=2005|title=Sex Differences in Morbidity and Mortality|journal=Demography|volume=42|issue=2|pages=189–214|doi=10.1353/dem.2005.0011|jstor=4147343|pmid=15986983|s2cid=1112587|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w10653.pdf}}</ref> 

Behavioral factors, like men smoking more than women and engaging in more [[coronary]]-prone behavior, as well as biological factors, like female [[hormone]]s, contribute to the female survival advantage.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waldron|first1=Ingrid|authorlink1=Ingrid Waldron |last2=Johnston|first2=Susan|year=1976|title=Why do Women Live Longer than Men?|journal=Journal of Human Stress|volume=2|issue=2|pages=19–30|doi=10.1080/0097840X.1976.9936063|pmid=1018115}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=S.|year=1989|title=Longevity in women|journal=Cardiovascular Clinics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=3–16|pmid=2644037}}</ref>

=== Diseases ===
It has been summarized by many studies that men die more than women, in each age group. Women experience more illnesses than men from [[adolescence]] to adulthood. This can likely be attributed to the fact that women have a higher chance of experiencing chronic conditions than men. 

The majority of the female survival advantage is accounted for by differences in mortality rates between men and women ages 50–70 due to differing rates of [[cardiovascular disease]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beltrán-Sánchez|first1=Hiram|last2=Finch|first2=Caleb E.|last3=Crimmins|first3=Eileen M.|year=2015|title=Twentieth century surge of excess adult male mortality|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=112|issue=29|pages=8993–8998|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.8993B|doi=10.1073/pnas.1421942112|pmc=4517277|pmid=26150507}}</ref>  

This paradox is difficult to detect, especially depending upon the indicators used to identify the phenomenon as well as the phase of the life cycle that each of the participants are in.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0277-9536(95)00335-5 |title=Gender differences in health: Are things really as simple as they seem? |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=617–624 |year=1996 |last1=MacIntyre |first1=Sally |last2=Hunt |first2=Kate |last3=Sweeting |first3=Helen |pmid=8643986 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2008.09.007 |pmid=18835429 |pmc=2703431 |title=Sex-specific health deterioration and mortality: The morbidity–mortality paradox over age and time |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=43 |issue=12 |pages=1052–1057 |year=2008 |last1=Kulminski |first1=Alexander M. |last2=Culminskaya |first2=Irina V. |last3=Ukraintseva |first3=Svetlana V. |last4=Arbeev |first4=Konstantin G. |last5=Land |first5=Kenneth C. |last6=Yashin |first6=Anatoli I. }}</ref> For example, men have higher rates of cardiovascular diseases, after adjusting the data for the gap in [[life expectancy]]. When viewing this statistic, it is important to consider that women have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, in general, because of their longer life expectancy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Möller-Leimkühler|first=Anne Maria|date=2007|title=Gender differences in cardiovascular disease and comorbid depression|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=9|issue=1|pages=71–83|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3181845|pmid=17506227}}</ref> Women also have higher rates of [[autoimmune disorder]]s than men.  

Overall, men and women are affected by mental disorders at similar rates, but men and women are diagnosed with different kinds of disorders at different rates. For example, men are more prone to experience [[substance abuse]], whereas women are more prone to be diagnosed with [[major depression|depression]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

=== Social factors ===
It has been concluded that sociological and biological factors both contribute to the paradox.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geronb/60.Special_Issue_2.S40 |title=Rethinking Gender Differences in Health: Why We Need to Integrate Social and Biological Perspectives |journal=The Journals of Gerontology: Series B |volume=60 |pages=S40–S47 |year=2005 |last1=Rieker |first1=Patricia P. |last2=Bird |first2=Chloe E. |pmid=16251589 }}</ref>

Proposed explanations for the paradox range from genetic, e.g. two [[X chromosome]]s protecting against [[recessive gene]]s; hormonal, e.g. [[estrogen]] protecting against cardiovascular diseases; and behavioral, e.g. the expectations around the female [[sex role]] making women more willing to seek medical help sooner. There are doubts about the role of hormones due to mixed results in [[hormone replacement therapy]] studies on elderly women.

There is also mixed evidence on the role of help-seeking behavior, with some studies reporting that women are more likely to seek medical treatment for all symptoms, and some reporting that women only seek more treatment on [[malaise]]-type symptoms.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Oksuzyan|first1=Anna|last2=Juel|first2=Knud|last3=Vaupel|first3=James W.|last4=Christensen|first4=Kaare|year=2008|title=Men: Good health and high mortality.

=== Genetic and physiological factors ===
Women's superior ability to store excess [[calorie]]s also contributes to their survival advantage.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Seely|first1=Stephen|year=1990|title=The gender gap: Why do women live longer than men?|journal=International Journal of Cardiology|volume=29|issue=2|pages=113–119|doi=10.1016/0167-5273(90)90213-O|pmid=2269531}}</ref> Women have lower mortality rates in high-mortality conditions like [[famine]] and [[epidemic]]s. In such conditions, most of the advantage comes from differences in [[infant mortality]] rates.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zarulli|first1=Virginia|last2=Barthold Jones|first2=Julia A.|last3=Oksuzyan|first3=Anna|last4=Lindahl-Jacobsen|first4=Rune|last5=Christensen|first5=Kaare|last6=Vaupel|first6=James W.|year=2018|title=Women live longer than men even during severe famines and epidemics|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=115|issue=4|pages=E832–E840|doi=10.1073/pnas.1701535115|pmc=5789901|pmid=29311321}}</ref>

A research study conducted on flies indicated that the [[allele]]s that contribute to male [[inclusive fitness]] also harm female health, and thus contribute to the paradox.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/s41467-018-07541-y |pmid=30487539 |pmc=6261961 |title=Intralocus sexual conflict can resolve the male-female health-survival paradox |journal=Nature Communications |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=5048 |year=2018 |last1=Archer |first1=C.

== Potential bias ==
Data collected from a research study in Denmark indicated that the paradox is likely due, in part, to [[selection bias]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2009.03.014 |pmid=19457685 |pmc=2696561 |title=The Male–Female Health–Survival Paradox: A Survey and Register Study of the Impact of Sex-Specific Selection and Information Bias |journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=504–511 |year=2009 |last1=Oksuzyan |first1=Anna |last2=Petersen |first2=Inge |last3=Stovring |first3=Henrik |last4=Bingley |first4=Paul |last5=Vaupel |first5=James W. |last6=Christensen |first6=Kaare }}</ref> Women have higher preferences for [[absenteeism]].
