The '''African Nutrition Leadership Programme (ANLP)''' is a 10 days training course that started in 2002 to assist the development of future leaders in the field of human nutrition in Africa. The emphasis of the programme is on understanding and developing the qualities and skills of leaders, team building, communication and understanding nutrition information in a broader context.
