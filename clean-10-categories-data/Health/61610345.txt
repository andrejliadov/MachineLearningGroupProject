'''The Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research''' (the Alliance) is an international partnership hosted at [[World Health Organization]] Headquarters that works to improve the health of those in low- and middle-income countries by supporting the generation and use of evidence that strengthens health systems.

== History ==
Following on from recommendations of the 1996 WHO Ad Hoc Committee on Health Research,<ref>{{cite web |title=Investing in health research and development: report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Health Research Relating to Future Intervention Options |url=https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/63024 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref> which recognised the role of research in strengthening health policies and the overall development of health systems, a group of global health leaders — including senior scientists, policy makers and representatives of various agencies and programs with a stake in health policy and systems research — met at Lejondal, Sweden.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research: aims, achievements and ambitions |url=http://www.phrp.com.au/issues/february-2017-volume-27-issue-1-2/alliance-for-health-policy-and-systems-research-aims-achievements-and-ambitions/ |website=Public Health Research and Practise |publisher=Sax Institute |accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref> At that meeting, the experts agreed on the need to create a body that would address areas of health policy and systems research.<ref>{{cite web |title=A 20-year journey |url=https://www.who.int/alliance-hpsr/20th-anniversary/alliancehpsr_a20yearjourney.pdf |website=World Health Organization |publisher=Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research |accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref> Although it took almost two years after that meeting, the Alliance was officially founded in 1999. Since then its main objective has not shifted significantly.

== Organization and governance ==
The Alliance has a small secretariat hosted at the [[World Health Organization]] Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The Secretariat manages the day-to-day implementation of the Alliance workplan. The work of the Secretariat is overseen by both the Alliance Board, which is the governing body of the Alliance, and the Alliance Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), which is responsible for providing scientific and technical advice to the Board and Secretariat.<ref>{{cite web |title=About us |url=https://www.who.int/alliance-hpsr/about/en/ |website=World Health Organization |publisher=Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research |accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref>

The Alliance mainly works through issuing and managing grants that achieve its four core objectives:
* Providing a unique forum for the health policy and systems research community;
* Supporting institutional capacity for the conduct and uptake of health policy and systems research;
* Stimulating the generation of knowledge and innovations to nurture learning and resilience in health systems; and
* Increasing the demand for and use of knowledge for strengthening health systems.

For example, it is a core sponsor of the biennial Health Systems Research Symposium organized by [[Health Systems Global]]. It also has been involved in developing or commissioning a wide range of reports, guidelines, and journal articles<ref>{{cite web |title=Publications and other resources |url=https://www.who.int/alliance-hpsr/resources/en/ |website=World Health Organization |publisher=Alliance for Health Policy and Systems Research |accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref> that advance the field of [[HPSR]].
