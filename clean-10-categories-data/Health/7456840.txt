== Signs and Symptoms ==
The appearance of a protrusive growth will be present at their mandible or maxilla.<ref name=pmid26587384/> The expansive nature of this cyst may destruct the quality of symmetry at the facial region and would be a clear physical sign of abnormality.<ref name=pmid26587384/><ref name="Shear & Speight 2007"/> The area of impact may likely be at the anterior region of mandible as described in a significant amount of reported cases.<ref name=pmid21180452/> At this region, GOC would eventually mediate expansion at the [[Molar (tooth)|molars]].<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007" /> A painful and swollen sensation at the jaw region caused by GOC may be reported.<ref name=Neville2016/> Detailing of a painless feeling or facial [[Paresthesia|paraesthesia]] can be experienced.<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007" /><ref name=Neville2016/> Alongside GOC, "[[root resorption]], cortical bone thinning and perforation, and tooth displacement may occur".<ref name=pmid25971944/> Experience of swelling at the [[Buccal space|buccal]] and [[Lingual artery|lingual]] zones can occur.<ref name=pmid15789313/> Usually, the smaller sized GOCs present no classical signs or symptoms to the case (i.e "asymptomatic").<ref name=pmid24959044>{{cite journal |last1=Patel |first1=Govind |last2=Shah |first2=Monali |last3=Kale |first3=Hemant |last4=Ranginwala |first4=Amena |title=Glandular odontogenic cyst: A rare entity |journal=Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology |date=2014 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=89–92 |doi=10.4103/0973-029X.131922 |pmid=24959044 |pmc=4065455 }}</ref> GOC is filled with cystic a fluid that differs in viscosity and may appear as transparent, brownish-red, or creamy in colour.<ref name=pmid25971944/>

== Causes ==
[[File:PDB 1ysw EBI.jpg|thumb|The molecular arrangement of BCL-2 protein, a potential cause to the development of the GOC. The protein can inhibit the process of apoptosis when at a high abundance.]]
The GOC can arise through a number of causes:<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007" />

The origin of the GOC can be understood through its biological and histochemistry foundations.<ref name="pmid24959044" /> It has been suggested that GOC can be a result of a traumatic event.<ref name="pmid27829208" /> The occurrence of GOC may be from a mutated cell from "the oral mucosa and the dental follicle" origin.<ref name="pmid27391558" /> Another probable cause is from pre-existing cysts or cancerous constituents.<ref name="pmid27829208" /> A potential biological origin of GOC is a cyst developed at a salivary gland or simple epithelium, which undergoes maturation at the glandular.<ref name="pmid24959044" /> Another origin is a primordial cyst that infiltrates the glandular epithelial tissue through a highly organised [[cellular differentiation]].<ref name="pmid24959044" /> Pathologists discovered a [[Bcl-2|BCL-2 protein]], commonly present in neoplasms, to exist in the tissue layers of the GOC.<ref name="pmid24959044" /><ref name="pmid27391558" /> The protein is capable of disrupting normal cell death function at the odontogenic region.<ref name="pmid24959044" /><ref name="pmid27391558" /> The analysis of [[PTCH1|PTCH]], a gene that specialises in neoplasm inhibition, was carried out to determine if any existing mutations played a role in the initiation of the GOC.<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007" /> It is confirmed that the gene had no assistance in triggering cystic advancement.<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007" />

== Diagnosis ==

=== Radiology ===
The performance of [[Radiography|radiographic]] imaging i.e. [[CT scan|computed tomography]], at the affected area is considered essential.<ref name=pmid25848155/> Radiographic imaging of the GOC can display a defined [[Locule|unilocular]] or multilocular appearance that may be "rounded or oval" shaped upon clinical observation.<ref name="pmid21865053" /><ref name=pmid24959044/> Scans may present a distribution of the GOC at the upper jaw as it presents a 71.8% prevalence in cases.<ref name=pmid26587384/> The margin surrounding the GOC is usually occupied with a scalloped definition.<ref name=pmid26587384/> A bilateral presentation of the GOC is possible but is not common at either the maxilla or mandible sites.<ref name=pmid25848155/> The GOC has an average size of 4.9&nbsp;cm that can develop over the midline when positioned at the mandible or maxilla region.<ref name="pmid25971944" /><ref name="Neville2016" /> Analysis of scans allow for the differentiation of GOC from other parallel lesions, i.e. "[[ameloblastoma]], [[odontogenic myxoma]], or [[dentigerous cyst]]" in order to minimise the chance of a misdiagnosis.<ref name="pmid21865053" /> These scans can display the severity of cortical plate, root, and tooth complications, which is observed to determine the necessary action for reconstruction.<ref name="pmid21865053" /> 

=== Histology ===
Histological features related to the GOC differ in each scenario; however, there is a general criterion to identify the cyst.<ref name=Neville2016/> The GOC usually features a "[[stratified squamous epithelium]]" attached to [[connective tissue]] that is filled with active [[White blood cell|immune cells]].<ref name=pmid26587384/><ref name="Shear & Speight 2007" /> The lining of the epithelium features a very small diameter that is usually non-keratinised.<ref name=pmid21180452/><ref name=pmid25848155/> In contrast, the lining of the GOC has rather an inconsistent diameter.<ref name=pmid26587384/> The [[Stratum basale|basal cells]] of the GOC usually has no association to a cancerous origin.<ref name=pmid27829208/> Tissue cells can be faced with an abnormal increase in the concentration of calcium, which can cause the region to [[Calcification|calcify]].<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007"/> The transformation of the epithelium is associated with a focal luminal development.<ref name=pmid26587384/> [[Eosinophilic]] organelles such as columnar and cuboidal cells can be observed during [[microscopy]].<ref name=pmid29131467/> Intra-epithelial crypts may be identified in the internal framework of the epithelium or at the external space where it presents itself as papillae protrusions.<ref name=pmid21180452/><ref name=pmid25848155/> [[Mucin]] is observable after the application of "[[Alcian blue stain|alcian blue dye]]" on the tissue specimen.<ref name=pmid21180452/> The histological observation of [[Goblet cell|goblet cells]] is a common feature with the "odontogenic [[dentigerous cyst|dentigerous cyst"]].<ref name=pmid29131467/> In some circumstances, the epithelium can have variable plaque structures that appear as swirls in the tissue layers.<ref name=pmid21180452/> Interestingly, histologists were able to identify hyaline bodies within the tissue framework of the GOC.<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007"/> It is encouraged that the histological identification of at least seven of these biological characteristics is required to accurately distinguish the presence of the GOC.<ref name=pmid29131467/>

==== Intraepithelial Hemosiderin ====
Pathologists have identified [[hemosiderin]] pigments that are considered unique to the GOC.<ref name=pmid27829208/> The discovery of this pigment can be pivotal to the differentiation of the GOC from other lesions.<ref name=pmid27829208/> The staining at the epithelium is due to the haemorrhaging of the lining.<ref name=pmid27829208/> The cause of the haemorrhaging can be triggered by the type of treatment, cellular degradation, or structural deformation inflicted during GOC expansion.<ref name=pmid27829208/> Examination of the GOC tissue section indicated that red blood cells from the intraluminal space had combined with the [[Extracellular fluid|extracellular]] constituents.<ref name=pmid27829208/> This process is carried out through transepithelial elimination.<ref name=pmid27829208/> This clinical procedure is beneficial to confirm the [[Benign tumor|benign]] or [[Malignant Tumour|malignant]] nature of the GOC.<ref name=pmid27829208/>

=== Immunocytochemistry ===
The examination of [[Cytokeratin|cytokeratin profiles]] is deemed useful when observing the differences between the GOC and the central MEC.<ref name=Neville2016/> These two lesions show individualised expression for [[Keratin 18|cytokeratin 18]] and [[Keratin 19|19]].<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007"/>  Past studies observed [[Ki-67 (protein)|Ki-67]], [[p53]], and [[Proliferating cell nuclear antigen|PCNA]] expression in common jaw cysts that shared similar characteristics.<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007"/> There was a lack of p53 expression found in [[Periapical cyst|radicular cysts]].<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007"/> Similarly, Ki-67 was seen less in the central MEC compared to the other lesions, though this discovery is not essential to the process of differential diagnosis.<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007"/><ref name=Neville2016/> Proliferating cell nuclear antigen readings were established to have no role in the differentiation process.<ref name=Neville2016/> The [[TGF beta signaling pathway|TGF-beta marker]] is present in the GOC and can explain the limited concentration of normal functioning cells.<ref name=pmid27391558>{{cite journal |last1=Alaeddini |first1=Mojgan |last2=Eshghyar |first2=Nosratollah |last3=Etemad‐Moghadam |first3=Shahroo |title=Expression of podoplanin and TGF-beta in glandular odontogenic cyst and its comparison with developmental and inflammatory odontogenic cystic lesions |journal=Journal of Oral Pathology & Medicine |date=2017 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=76–80 |doi=10.1111/jop.12475 |pmid=27391558 |s2cid=40879254 }}</ref>

==== MAML2 rearrangement ====
The observation of a [[MAML2]] rearrangement is described as a procedure useful in the differential diagnosis of the GOC and its closely related lesion, the central MEC.<ref name=pmid29131467/> A second cystic development displayed the presence of CRTC3-MAML2 fusion after an in-vitro application.<ref name=pmid29131467/> The MAML2 rearrangement represents the developmental growth of the central MEC from the GOC.<ref name=pmid29131467/> The use of fusion-gene transcript may be helpful towards the differentiation of the GOC from the central MEC of the jaw and salivary glands.<ref name=pmid29131467/>

== Treatment ==

=== Pre-treatment protocols ===
[[File:Panoramic Xray.jpg|thumb|Panoramic radiography used to provide visualisations of the maxilla and mandible. X-rays will display the degree of impact on case, caused by the GOC.]]
A computed tomography and [[Panoramic radiograph|panoramic x-ray]] must be undertaken in order to observe the severity of internal complications.<ref name=pmid21865053/> These scans allow for the observation of the GOC size, radiolucency, cortical bone, [[dentition]], root, and [[Vestibular lamina|vestibular]] zone.<ref name=pmid21865053/> In some cases, the dentition may be embedded into the cavity walls of the lesion, depending on the position of expansion at the odontogenic tissue.<ref name=pmid25848155/> The diagnosis of a smaller sized GOC is related to the attachment of only two teeth.<ref name=pmid15789313/> While, a greater sized GOC develops over two teeth.<ref name=pmid15789313/> Presentation of a greater sized lesion usually requires a [[biopsy]] for a differential diagnosis and a precise treatment plan.<ref name=pmid15789313/>

=== Treatment process ===
The unilocular and multilocular nature is imperative to the determination of treatment style.<ref name=pmid15789313/> [[Local anesthesia]] is regularly provided as the GOC is embedded within the tissue structure of the jaw and requires an invasive procedure for a safe and accurate extraction.<ref name=pmid26587384/> For unilocular GOCs with minimal tissue deterioration, "[[Enucleation (surgery)|enucleation]], [[curettage]], and [[marsupialization]]" is a suitable treatment plan.<ref name=pmid15789313/> Notably, the performance of enucleation or curettage as the primary action is linked to an incomplete extraction of the GOC and is only recommended to the less invasive lesions.<ref name=pmid15789313/> Multilocular GOCs require a more invasive procedure such as "peripheral [[ostectomy]], marginal resection, or partial jaw resection".<ref name=pmid15789313/> GOCs associated with a more severe structural damage are encouraged to undergo marsupialization as either an initial or supplementary surgery.<ref name=pmid15789313/> The frequency of reappearance is likely due to the lingering cystic tissue structures that remain after the performance of curettage.<ref name=pmid25848155/> The incorporation of a "dredging method i.e. repetition of enucleation and curettage" is also suggested until the remnants of the GOC diminishes for certain.<ref name=pmid24374982/> The treatment ensures scar tissue is removed to promote the successful reconstruction of osseous material for jaw preservation.<ref name=pmid24374982/> Alongside the main treatments, bone allograft application, [[cryosurgery]], and [[apicoectomy]] are available but have not been consistently recommended.<ref name="pmid24374982" /><ref name=pmid25848155/><ref name=pmid21865053/> Though [[Carnoy's solution]], the [[Chloroform|chloroform-]]<nowiki/>free version, is recommended with the treatment as it degenerates the majority of the damaged [[dental lamina]].<ref name=pmid25848155/> The most effective type of treatment remains unknown due to the lack of detailed data from reported cases.<ref name=pmid25971944/>

=== Post-treatment protocols ===
Follow-up appointments are necessary after the removal of the GOC as there is a high chance of remission, which may be exacerbated in cases dealing with "cortical plate perforation".<ref name="pmid25848155" /><ref name=pmid21865053/> The GOC has a significant remission rate of 21 to 55% that can potentially develop during the period of 0.5 to 7 years post-surgery.<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007"/><ref name=pmid15789313/> Cases occupied with a lower risk lesion are expected to continue appointments with physicians for up to 3 years post-surgery.<ref name=pmid15789313/> A higher risk lesion is encouraged to consistently consult with physicians during a 7 year period after treatment.<ref name=pmid25848155/> Remission events require immediate attention and appropriate procedures such as enucleation or curettage.<ref name=pmid15789313/> In more damaging cases of remission, tissue resection, and marsupialization may have to be performed.<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007"/>

== Epidemiology ==
The clinical presentation of the GOC is very low in the population as noted by the 0.12 to 0.13% occurrence rate, extrapolated from a sample size of the 181 individuals.<ref name=pmid26587384/> The GOC mainly affects older individuals in the population, especially those that are in their 40 to 60s.<ref name=pmid21180452/> However, the GOC can affect younger individuals i.e. 11, and more older individuals i.e. 82 in the population.<ref name=pmid26587384/> The age distribution starts at a much lower number for people living in Asia and Africa.<ref name=pmid26587384/> Those in their first 10 years of life have not been diagnosed with the GOC.<ref name=Neville2016/> The GOC does present a tendency to proliferate in more males than females.<ref name=pmid25971944/> There is no definitive conclusion towards the relevance of gender and its influence on the rate of incidence.<ref name="Shear & Speight 2007"/>
