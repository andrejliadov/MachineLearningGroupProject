'''Craniofacial regeneration''' refers to the biological process by which the [[skull]] and [[face]] regrow to heal an injury. This page covers [[birth defect]]s and injuries related to the [[Craniofacial|craniofacial region]], the mechanisms behind the [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], the medical application of these processes, and the scientific research conducted on this specific regeneration. This regeneration is not to be confused with [[tooth regeneration]]. Craniofacial regrowth is broadly related to the mechanisms of general [[bone healing]].

== Function ==
Craniofacial regeneration is necessary following injury to the facial tissue. This can occur during surgery, where doctors fracture the face of a patient in order to correct [[craniofacial abnormalities]] such as [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft lip]], [[Apert syndrome]], [[Treacher Collins Syndrome|Treacher Collins syndrome]], [[Hypodontia|Oligodontia]], [[Cherubism]], [[Crouzon syndrome]], [[Pfeiffer syndrome|Pfeiffer Syndrome]], [[Craniosynostosis]], or [[Goldenhar syndrome|Goldenhar Syndrome]]. Other applications include corrections to [[birth defect]]s (such as [[hypertelorism]]), [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|maxillofacial surgery]], [[craniosynostosis]], rare [[Facial cleft|craniofacial clefts]], or removal of [[tumor]]s. This regeneration can also be necessary following trauma to the face, most often due to automotive accidents.

Craniofacial defects are most common [[Birth defect|congenitally]] (present at birth), with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 700 live births (270,000 children per year).<ref>{{cite book |chapter = Addressing Global and Social Challenges through Innovation | title = The OECD Innovation Strategy |date=2010-05-28 |doi = 10.1787/9789264083479-8-en }}</ref> Common corrective procedures include [[intracranial]] surgeries (making room for brain growth through skull expansion), [[Cleft palate]] surgeries (repairing a gap in the roof of the mouth), and [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|Cleft lip]] surgeries (closing a gap in the lips).<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.seattlechildrens.org/clinics/craniofacial/statistics-outcomes/ |title=Statistics and Outcomes: Craniofacial Center |website=Seattle Children’s Hospital |access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>

Most patients who suffer from [[craniofacial abnormalities]] have a normal life expectancy, but symptoms are often present throughout the patient's life. Common symptoms and features of a craniofacial defect include abnormal cranial [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], difficulty in cranio-related functions such as breathing, hearing, swallowing, or speech, or [[Facial nerve paralysis|facial paralysis]].

== Research and historical context ==
In the 1970s, [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s (MSCs) were discovered by A.J. Friedenstein. [[Mesenchymal stem cell]] research has yielded the most promising results for craniofacial regeneration, as MSCs can be found in many types of [[postnatal]] tissues, including [[Orofacial pain#Definition|orofacial tissues]]. [[Alginate]] [[hydrogel]], which contains [[nerve growth factor]], has been used to deliver [[stem cell]]s to tissues during regeneration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ansari S, Seagroves JT, Chen C, Shah K, Aghaloo T, Wu BM, Bencharit S, Moshaverinia A | display-authors = 6 | title = Dental and orofacial mesenchymal stem cells in craniofacial regeneration: The prosthodontist's point of view | journal = The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry | volume = 118 | issue = 4 | pages = 455–461 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28385446 | pmc = 5623090 | doi = 10.1016/j.prosdent.2016.11.021 }}</ref>

=== Stem cells ===
While there is a lack of craniofacial-specific [[clinical trial]]s regarding [[Stem-cell therapy|stem cell therapies]], there has been great effort in identifying craniofacial-specific [[stem cell]] populations, [[precursor cell]]s that can give rise to many specific structures of the skull. Such stem cells include [[Mesenchymal stem cell#Bone marrow|bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells]] (BMMSC),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Horwitz EM, Prockop DJ, Fitzpatrick LA, Koo WW, Gordon PL, Neel M, Sussman M, Orchard P, Marx JC, Pyeritz RE, Brenner MK | display-authors = 6 | title = Transplantability and therapeutic effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells in children with osteogenesis imperfecta | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–13 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10086387 | doi = 10.1038/6529 | s2cid = 38011739 }}</ref> [[Mesenchymal stem cell#Adipose tissue|adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells]] (AMCs),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Asatrian G, Pham D, Hardy WR, James AW, Peault B | title = Stem cell technology for bone regeneration: current status and potential applications | journal =  Stem Cells and Cloning: Advances and Applications| volume = 8 | pages = 39–48 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25709479 | pmc = 4334288 | doi = 10.2147/SCCAA.S48423 }}</ref> [[Myosatellite cell|muscle satellite cells]] (MuSCs),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jin YZ, Lee JH | title = Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy for Bone Regeneration | journal = Clinics in Orthopedic Surgery | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–278 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30174801 | pmc = 6107811 | doi = 10.4055/cios.2018.10.3.271 }}</ref> [[periodontal ligament stem cells]] (PDLSCs),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gronthos S, Mankani M, Brahim J, Robey PG, Shi S | title = Postnatal human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in vitro and in vivo | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 25 | pages = 13625–30 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11087820 | pmc = 17626 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.240309797 | bibcode = 2000PNAS...9713625G }}</ref> and [[Dental pulp stem cells#Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth|stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous]] (SHED teeth).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Miura M, Gronthos S, Zhao M, Lu B, Fisher LW, Robey PG, Shi S | title = SHED: stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 10 | pages = 5807–12 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12716973 | pmc = 156282 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0937635100 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.5807M }}</ref> The following section will outline the two most promising stem cell populations in craniofacial bone regeneration.

[[Mesenchymal stem cell#Bone marrow|BMMSCs]] have been reported to repair craniofacial defects. In 1994, it was demonstrated that when BMMSCs were grown in culture with [[dexamethasone]], [[Vitamin C|ascorbic acid 2-phosphate]], and [[inorganic phosphate]], they [[Cellular differentiation|differentiated]] into functional [[Osteoblast|osteoblast-like cells]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gronthos S, Graves SE, Ohta S, Simmons PJ | title = The STRO-1+ fraction of adult human bone marrow contains the osteogenic precursors | journal = Blood | volume = 84 | issue = 12 | pages = 4164–73 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7994030 | doi = 10.1182/blood.v84.12.4164.bloodjournal84124164 | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, when challenged [[in vivo]], it was reported that only “a little over half” of the mice with the differentiated BMMSCs showed potential to develop bone structure.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gronthos S, Zannettino AC, Hay SJ, Shi S, Graves SE, Kortesidis A, Simmons PJ | title = Molecular and cellular characterisation of highly purified stromal stem cells derived from human bone marrow | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 116 | issue = Pt 9 | pages = 1827–35 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12665563 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.00369 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Developments in BMMSCs application to bone repair have nonetheless been proven successful in many animal models including [[canidae|canines]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bruder SP, Kraus KH, Goldberg VM, Kadiyala S | title = The effect of implants loaded with autologous mesenchymal stem cells on the healing of canine segmental bone defects | journal = The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

==== Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMCs) ====
[[Mesenchymal stem cell#Adipose tissue|AMCs]] have also showed promise in craniofacial bone regeneration. In 2014, George K. Sándor performed a small size clinical trial (n = 13) on patients with [[craniomaxillofacial]] defects where AMCs were transplanted with [[Tissue engineering#Scaffolds|scaffolds]] of either [[bioactive glass]] or [[Tricalcium phosphate|β-tricalcium phosphate]] in an attempt to reconstruct the defect. β-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds are characterized by their [[Porosity|porous]] [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] synthetic scaffold structures that stimulate [[Cell growth|growth]], [[Cell migration|migration]], and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] in human cells leading to bone reparation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Deschamps IS, Magrin GL, Magini RS, Fredel MC, Benfatti CA, Souza JC | title = On the synthesis and characterization of β-tricalcium phosphate scaffolds coated with collagen or poly (D, L-lactic acid) for alveolar bone augmentation | journal = European Journal of Dentistry | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 496–502 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29279677 | pmc = 5727736 | doi = 10.4103/ejd.ejd_4_17 }}</ref> This study saw 10 out of the 13 patients successfully integrate the AMCs and scaffolds.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sándor GK, Numminen J, Wolff J, Thesleff T, Miettinen A, Tuovinen VJ, Mannerström B, Patrikoski M, Seppänen R, Miettinen S, Rautiainen M, Öhman J | display-authors = 6 | title = Adipose stem cells used to reconstruct 13 cases with cranio-maxillofacial hard-tissue defects | journal = Stem Cells Translational Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 530–40 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24558162 | pmc = 3973720 | doi = 10.5966/sctm.2013-0173 }}</ref> In 2017, the [[National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research]] (NIDCR) awarded $24 million to two centers focused on craniofacial disease and injury research.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2017-archive/march/nidcr-devotes-24-million-to-tissue-regeneration-research|title=NIDCR devotes $24 million to tissue regeneration research|website=www.ada.org|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>

== Mechanism & Important Factors ==
Following facial tissue injury, craniofacial regeneration occurs in a sequence of steps. The process of regeneration is initiated by an [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]] to injury, followed by [[angiogenesis]], leading to [[Mesenchymal stem cell|mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)]] [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]]. Additional related steps include the healing process and [[nerve regeneration]], which is briefly covered.

=== Inflammation ===
During [[Inflammation Research|inflammation]], there is a disturbance of connective tissue ([[collagen]]) for release necessary healing proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Merloz P | title = Bone regeneration and limb lengthening | journal = Osteoporosis International | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 2033–6 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21523394 | doi = 10.1007/s00198-011-1617-y | s2cid = 9186603 }}</ref> Inflammation is a normal indication of injury and activates [[macrophage]]s, which recruit [[lymphocyte]]s to the site of injury. These lymphocytes secrete [[cytokine]]s. Cytokines are [[protein]]s that are assist in mediating the [[immune response]] to inflammation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Floege J, Gröne HJ | title = Progression of renal failure: what is the role of cytokines? | journal = Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 1575–86 | date = September 1995 | pmid = 8559473 | doi = 10.1093/ndt/10.9.1575 }}</ref> The presence of cytokines stimulates [[angiogenesis]] and [[Mesenchymal stem cell|MSCs]] differentiation into [[osteoblast]]s, which eventually constitute new bone.

=== Angiogenesis and VEGF ===
[[Angiogenesis]] occurs after inflammation and it is the formation of [[blood vessel]]s from previously existing ones. This process takes place in the form of fast outgrowth and organization of blood vessels. Angiogenesis occurs in [[Regeneration in humans|organ regeneration]], [[tissue healing]], and [[Neoplasm|neoplasia processes]]. It has been shown that angiogenesis is highly dependent upon [[extracellular]] and inflammatory signals such as [[cytokine]]s, [[protease]]s, and [[growth factor]]s. [[Integrin]]s, a type of [[Transmembrane protein|transmembrane receptor protein]], have been shown to be important for angiogenesis. When they are inhibited, specifically integrin [[Alpha-5 beta-1|α5β1]], angiogenesis does not occur.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim S, Bell K, Mousa SA, Varner JA | title = Regulation of angiogenesis in vivo by ligation of integrin alpha5beta1 with the central cell-binding domain of fibronectin | journal = The American Journal of Pathology | volume = 156 | issue = 4 | pages = 1345–62 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10751360 | pmc = 1876892 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65005-5 }}</ref> Targeting integrin αvβ5 was shown to have a negative effect on [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF)-dependent angiogenesis. This was not shown directly in conjunction with craniofacial regeneration.

Angiogenesis allows for [[oxygen]], [[nutrient]]s, [[inflammatory cell]]s, [[cartilage]], and [[Mesenchymal stem cell|bone progenitor]] (precursors) to reach the site of regeneration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hankenson KD, Dishowitz M, Gray C, Schenker M | title = Angiogenesis in bone regeneration | journal = Injury | volume = 42 | issue = 6 | pages = 556–61 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21489534 | pmc = 3105195 | doi = 10.1016/j.injury.2011.03.035 }}</ref> [[Animal models]] that enhanced angiogenesis also showed enhanced regenerative abilities. Angiogenesis is also temporally significant for bone regeneration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brownlow HC, Reed A, Simpson AH | title = The vascularity of atrophic non-unions | journal = Injury | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–50 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11890916 | doi = 10.1016/S0020-1383(01)00153-X }}</ref>
It has been shown that [[osteoblast]]s that originate from [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) signaling play a crucial role for the development of new bone during regeneration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu K, Olsen BR | title = Osteoblast-derived VEGF regulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation during bone repair | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 126 | issue = 2 | pages = 509–26 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26731472 | pmc = 4731163 | doi = 10.1172/JCI82585 }}</ref> VEGF is also a key regulator of [[angiogenesis]].

VEGF has two known roles in bone regeneration: promotion of [[Endothelium|endothelial]] [[cell proliferation]] and [[Cell migration|migration]], and the activation of [[osteogenesis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schipani E, Maes C, Carmeliet G, Semenza GL | title = Regulation of osteogenesis-angiogenesis coupling by HIFs and VEGF | journal = Journal of Bone and Mineral Research | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1347–53 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19558314 | pmc = 3276346 | doi = 10.1359/jbmr.090602 }}</ref> Despite this knowledge, the mechanism by which VEGF controls bone homeostasis is poorly understood.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grosso A, Burger MG, Lunger A, Schaefer DJ, Banfi A, Di Maggio N | title = It Takes Two to Tango: Coupling of Angiogenesis and Osteogenesis for Bone Regeneration | journal = Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | volume = 5 | pages = 68 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29164110 | pmc = 5675838 | doi = 10.3389/fbioe.2017.00068 }}</ref>

In addition, VEGF is necessary for a specific bone regeneration pathway called [[intramembranous ossification]], where [[Mesenchyme|mesenchymal tissue]] is directed towards bone formation. This involves the direct differentiation of [[Mesenchymal stem cell|bone progenitors]] to [[osteoblast]]s (contrary to a [[cartilage]] intermediate in [[endochondral ossification]]). Many primary literature papers have demonstrated that a [[Genetic engineering#Research|loss-of-function experiment]] against VEGF in the osteoblast precursors significantly reduces [[ossification]] in craniofacial bone structures,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Y, Wan C, Deng L, Liu X, Cao X, Gilbert SR, Bouxsein ML, Faugere MC, Guldberg RE, Gerstenfeld LC, Haase VH, Johnson RS, Schipani E, Clemens TL | display-authors = 6 | title = The hypoxia-inducible factor alpha pathway couples angiogenesis to osteogenesis during skeletal development | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 117 | issue = 6 | pages = 1616–26 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17549257 | pmc = 1878533 | doi = 10.1172/JCI31581 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill C, Jacobs B, Kennedy L, Rohde S, Zhou B, Baldwin S, Goudy S | title = Cranial neural crest deletion of VEGFa causes cleft palate with aberrant vascular and bone development | journal = Cell and Tissue Research | volume = 361 | issue = 3 | pages = 711–22 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25759071 | doi = 10.1007/s00441-015-2150-7 | s2cid = 13737041 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Duan X, Bradbury SR, Olsen BR, Berendsen AD | title = VEGF stimulates intramembranous bone formation during craniofacial skeletal development | journal = Matrix Biology | volume = 52 | pages = 127–140 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26899202 | pmc = 4875795 | doi = 10.1016/j.matbio.2016.02.005 }}</ref> highlighting the essential role of VEGF in craniofacial regeneration.

=== Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) ===
Osteogenic tissue is [[fibrous tissue]] that can become bone tissue ([[Bone marrow|marrow]], [[endosteum]], [[nutrient artery]], and [[periosteum]]). Bone regeneration takes place during fracture healing and bone remodeling that takes place throughout life. [[Bone healing]] also tends to occur without [[Scarring|scar formation]] and with full functional capacities being restored. [[Growth factor]]s, such as [[Bone morphogenetic protein|bone morphogenic proteins]] (BMPs), are important in inducing the differentiation of MSCs during bone regeneration.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dimitriou R, Jones E, McGonagle D, Giannoudis PV | title = Bone regeneration: current concepts and future directions | journal = BMC Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 66 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21627784 | pmc = 3123714 | doi = 10.1186/1741-7015-9-66 }}</ref> Bone regeneration in adults appears to mimic bone development during [[Embryonic development|embryogenesis]], except for the requirement of inflammation to initiate the regenerative process.<ref name=":0"/> Another difference between bone development and regeneration is the decreased number of [[Osteochondroprogenitor cell|osteoprogenitor cells]] during regeneration. During embryogenesis, MSCs aggregate and condense, creating cartilage. Some of these cells differentiate, creating [[Intramembranous ossification|membranous ossification]] (bone tissue formation) while some committed [[Osteochondroprogenitor cell|osteoprogenitor cells]] from the [[periosteum]] (type of osteogenic tissue) and undifferentiated [[multipotent]] MSC from the bone marrow lead to [[Callus (cell biology)|callus formation]], which aids in fracture healing.

Undifferentiated MSCs are limited in adults, but these cells along with committed osteoprogenitor cells are both involved in callus formation. Along with MSCs and osteoprogenitors, [[mechanobiology]] also influences bone regeneration. Simply put, compression can enhance [[Bone fracture#Subgroup|bone apposition]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Isaksson |first=Hanna | name-list-style = vanc |date=June 2012 |title=Recent advances in mechanobiological modeling of bone regeneration | journal = Mechanics Research Communications |volume=42 |pages=22–31 |doi=10.1016/j.mechrescom.2011.11.006 }}</ref> This is known as [[Wolff's law]], which essentially states that bone remodeling occurs to counter and adapt to loads placed upon it.<ref name=":0"/>

[[Osteoblast|Mature osteoblasts]] are differentiated precursor cells found in the bone marrow. MSCs are typically found in the [[bone marrow stroma]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Benayahu D, Akavia UD, Shur I | title = Differentiation of bone marrow stroma-derived mesenchymal cells | journal = Current Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–9 | date = 2006-12-31 | pmid = 17266576 | doi = 10.2174/092986707779313363 }}</ref> MSC differentiation is induced by a cocktail of [[morphogen]]s and other factors. Human MSCs have been shown to differentiate with a cocktail of [[dexamethasone]], [[IBMX|isobutyl methyl xanthine]], [[insulin]] and [[rosiglitazone]] (a [[peroxisome]] [[Cell proliferation|proliferator]]-activated receptor γ2 ([[PPAR agonist|PPAR-γ2]]) [[agonist]]) [[in vitro]].<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Arvidson K, Abdallah BM, Applegate LA, Baldini N, Cenni E, Gomez-Barrena E, Granchi D, Kassem M, Konttinen YT, Mustafa K, Pioletti DP, Sillat T, Finne-Wistrand A | display-authors = 6 | title = Bone regeneration and stem cells | journal = Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 718–46 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21129153 | pmc = 3922662 | doi = 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01224.x }}</ref>

Scientific understanding of bone regeneration in vitro is limited. Thus, [[in vivo]] assays have been explored. One such assay is the “gold standard” assay, created by A.J. Friedenstein. His test utilizes [[diffusion]] chambers (open system) in which he implanted MSCs into [[Immunodeficiency|immunodeficient]] mice. When this was done, he observed that MSCs formed bone and bone marrow. His test has also been used to demonstrate [[Stem cell#Self-renewal|self-renewal]] and maintenance of “[[Stem cell#Potency meaning|stemness]]” in serial implantations.<ref name=":0" />

=== Healing Process ===
One week following injury there are two [[Ossification of frontal|ossification fronts]] lying at the end of each bony fragment. In between these two fragments is an intermediate zone consisting largely of [[fibroblast]]s and poorly differentiated osteoblasts. Fibroblasts proliferate in this area, arising from marrow cells with fibroblastic potential.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ho-Shui-Ling A, Bolander J, Rustom LE, Johnson AW, Luyten FP, Picart C | title = Bone regeneration strategies: Engineered scaffolds, bioactive molecules and stem cells current stage and future perspectives | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 180 | pages = 143–162 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30036727 | pmc = 6710094 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.07.017 }}</ref> From the 1st to the 3rd week following injury, regenerated bone begins to fill in the gap between the two bony fragments. The first [[osteon]]s begin to appear within the depths of the growth zone and there are numerous [[Hypertrophy|hypertrophied]] vessels. The [[Medullary cavity|medullary canal]] appears by means of [[Bone resorption|osteoclastic resorption]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Graney PL, Roohani-Esfahani SI, Zreiqat H, Spiller KL | title = In vitro response of macrophages to ceramic scaffolds used for bone regeneration | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 13 | issue = 120 | pages = 20160346 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27466438 | pmc = 4971223 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2016.0346 }}</ref>

=== Nerve Regeneration ===
Following facial injury it is also critical to restore [[Nerve|nerve function]] to avoid [[facial paralysis]]. Often, patients who received surgery following injury or tumor resection suffer extensive [[Nerve injury|nerve damage.]] This is a serious problem given the importance of facial expressions and speech for communicating in human society. For many who endure such nerve damage, they recover after 12 months; however, others may never fully recover.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Samii M, Matthies C | title = Management of 1000 vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas): the facial nerve--preservation and restitution of function | journal = Neurosurgery | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 684–94; discussion 694–5 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9092841 | doi = 10.1097/00006123-199704000-00006 }}</ref> While there is not currently much modern medicine can do for these patients, the cutting edge of care is now [[Nerve allograft|nerve grafting]]. These grafts are taken from the [[masseter muscle]], which controls mouth movement, or the [[hypoglossal nerve]] which controls the tongue. To avoid [[denervation]] caused by lack of stimulus, surgery should be done as soon as possible; however, it is often difficult to determine if a patient will recover naturally or whether nerve grafting is required. Generally this distinction can be made by 6 months post injury and grafting occurs soon after. Nerve grafting works through lessening the degenerative effects of denervation and by accelerating the regeneration of [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name="Structural and functional changes i">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lieber RL, Steinman S, Barash IA, Chambers H | title = Structural and functional changes in spastic skeletal muscle | journal = Muscle & Nerve | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 615–27 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15116365 | doi = 10.1002/mus.20059 }}</ref> This works through providing nerve signaling [[Anatomical terms of location|distal]] to the site of injury, helping the regenerating nerve to find the correct path.

== Experimental Models ==
Current approaches to craniofacial research are spearheaded by a branch of the [[National Institutes of Health|U.S. National Institutes of Health]], named the [[National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research|National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)]]. With regards to [[regenerative medicine]], the NIDCR invested $52 million in “basic, translational, and clinical” regenerative research in 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/grants-funding/funded-research/research-investments-advances/regenerative-medicine | title = Regenerative Medicine {{!}} Research Investments Advances {{!}} | work = National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research  |access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> These experiments include but are not limited to:

* '''Microengineering blood vessels:''' enhancing current engineering of nutrient-rich blood vessels to promote transplanted tissues and bone precursor cells (cells that will give rise to bone structure). Proper engineering of these circulating blood vessels would alleviate pressure on newly implanted cells or craniofacial structures.
* '''Designing stronger cartilage:''' challenging cartilage cells [[in vitro]] (in the laboratory) with harsh conditions to mimic the environment of a craniofacial defect. It is vital that laboratory-generated cartilage be comparable in strength to natural cartilage.
* '''Isolating bone stem cells:''' purifying stem cells from a collection of [[Adipose tissue|human fat tissue]] that can generate bone [[in vivo]] (animal models).

Researchers are also implementing many genetic tools to further understand craniofacial regeneration. Developmental biologists have been reported to use [[laser capture microdissection]] and [[Flow cytometry#Cell sorting by flow cytometry|fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)]] to create an [[Gene regulatory network|array of genes]] involved in craniofacial development.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |url= https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/research/divisions/d/dev-biology/labs/potter/projects/global-gene-expression-atlas-craniofacial|title=Global Gene-Expression Atlas of Craniofacial Development | work = Potter Lab| publisher = Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center |access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref>

Identification of specific genes necessary in craniofacial development can lead to striking [[Transgene|transgenic]] experiments. These types of procedures involve [[Genetic editing|genetically editing]] organisms to understand the function of their genes. For example, using [[Cre recombinase|Cre-recombinase]], an enzyme which makes specific cuts in the genome, researchers were able to knockout the expression of [[Sp8 transcription factor|Sp8]], a gene hypothesized to be essential for face development. In the resulting mouse model, it was observed that facial development was significantly impaired, yet a tongue and a mandible were present (see image).<ref name=":1" /> Transgenic animal models is just one way in which researchers are attempting to understand craniofacial abnormalities.

== Causes of craniofacial injury ==

=== Physical injury ===
[[File:Craniofacial_injury_.png|thumb|X-ray of a human face following a fracture to the zygomatic arch]]
These injuries happen predominantly in young males, often as a result of traffic accidents which result in 22% of all craniofacial trauma. Craniofacial injuries can result in death due to [[brain damage]] and [[Airway obstruction|airway blockage]]. Following serious injury resulting in airway blockage, the standard of care is to [[Tracheal intubation|intubate]], which involves inserting a flexible tube into the [[trachea]] to maintain airflow, followed by immediate surgical intervention (41% of injuries). [[Mechanical ventilation]] (65% of injuries), [[blood transfusion]] (28% of injuries) and [[Tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] (22% of injuries) are also common following trauma. [[Head injury|Head injuries]] often coincide with craniofacial trauma, [[extradural hematoma]] (bleeding in between the skull and the [[dura mater]]), and [[subdural hematoma]]s (bleeding between the [[dura mater]] and the brain). Injury to the skull included fractures of [[frontal bone]] (20.15% of injuries), [[sphenoid bone]] (11.63% of injuries), [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbital roof]] (13.18% of injuries), and fracture of [[Cribriform plate|cribriform]] and [[Ethmoid bone|ethmoid bone complex]] (13.18%) with associated [[cerebrospinal fluid]] [[rhinorrhea]].

The usual surgery used to treat severe craniofacial injury occurs in three stages. [[Craniotomy]] is performed immediately, followed by [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbitofacial]] repair 7–10 days later and finally [[cranioplasty]] after 6–12 months.<ref name="Structural and functional changes i"/>

=== Genetic disorders ===
[[Treacher Collins Syndrome|Treacher Collins syndrome]], [[cherubism]] and [[Stickler syndrome]] are all examples of [[Genetic disorder|rare genetic conditions]] that cause facial deformities. These diseases manifest symptoms in the head, face, mouth, or neck region, and they influence both appearance and function. These disabilities can lead to [[sleep apnea]], [[Oral hygiene|poor oral health]], and [[speech impediments]].

==== Treacher Collins syndrome ====
[[File:Face_post_injury.png|thumb|Same patient as above. Follow up image 6 months post reconstructive surgery. Titanium screws and plates were inserted to help hold bones in place.]]
[[Treacher Collins syndrome]] is a rare [[autosomal dominant]] condition. Symptoms usually include downward-slanting [[palpebral fissure]]s and [[hypoplasia]] of the [[zygomatic arch]]es. Patients can also suffer from [[hypoplasia]] of the [[mandible]], [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|cleft palate]], lower eyelid [[coloboma]], [[microtia]], [[atresia]] of the ear canal, and hearing loss.<ref name="Early Nerve Grafting for Facial Par"/> Treatments can include reconstructive surgeries of the eye, ear and [[zygomatic arch]], orthodontics and hearing aids.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bajwa SJ, Kaur J, Singh A, Kapoor V, Bindra GS, Ghai GS | title = Clinical and critical care concerns of cranio-facial trauma: A retrospective study in a tertiary care institute | journal = National Journal of Maxillofacial Surgery | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–8 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 23833486 | pmc = 3700145 | doi = 10.4103/0975-5950.111343 }}</ref>

=== Surgery ===

{{cleanup section|reason=limited coverage of surgeries for CF regeneration, poorly referenced|date=December 2019}}

Facial surgery is often voluntary to make features more aesthetically pleasing. [[Rhinoplasty]] is exceedingly common, with 220,000 procedures occurring each year.<ref name=":2" /> They are used for improving the outward appearance of the nose and for improving nasal airway flow. The first step is an incision into the [[columella]], the skin connecting the nostrils. Surgeons can then remove cartilage and bone to correct a [[Aquiline nose|dorsal hump]], wide tip, or [[Nasal septum deviation|crooked nose]]. They are also able to correct [[Nasal septum deviation|deviated septums]], which are a common airway blockage. Once this is completed, the incisions are closed and splits are placed to maintain stability during the healing process.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee KH, Hayward P | title = Retrospective review of Stickler syndrome patients with cleft palate 1997-2004 | journal = ANZ Journal of Surgery | volume = 78 | issue = 9 | pages = 764–6 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18844904 | doi = 10.1111/j.1445-2197.2008.04645.x | s2cid = 205498927 }}</ref> [[Plastic surgery|Aesthetic surgery]] is also common following tumor resections, where plastic surgeons correct soft tissue or bone misalignments that occurred due to the removal of a tumor. These procedures can involve bone grafts from the [[pelvis]] or [[Rib cage|ribs]] to replace removed bone and implantation of [[Internal fixation|titanium plates]] and screws to hold pieces of bone together.
