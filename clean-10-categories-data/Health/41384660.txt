'''Health information on the Internet''' refers to all health-related information communicated through or available on the [[Internet]].

==Description==
The [[Internet]] is widely used by the general public as a tool for finding health information. In the late 1990s, researchers noted an increase in Internet users' access to health-related content despite the variation in the quality of information, level of accessibility, and overall health literacy.<ref name="Health information on the internet">{{cite journal | vauthors = Risk A, Petersen C | title = Health information on the internet: quality issues and international initiatives | journal = JAMA | volume = 287 | issue = 20 | pages = 2713–5 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12020308 | doi = 10.1001/jama.287.20.2713 }}</ref> Access to health information does not guarantee understanding, as '''health literacy''' of individuals vary.

It is believed patients who know their medical history may learn and interpret this information in a way that benefits them.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beaudin JS, Intille SS, Morris ME | title = To track or not to track: user reactions to concepts in longitudinal health monitoring | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = e29 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17236264 | pmc = 1794006 | doi = 10.2196/jmir.8.4.e29 }}</ref> This, however, is not always the case because online health information is not always [[peer review]]ed.<ref name="Health information on the internet"/> [[Physician]]s worry that patients who conduct Internet research on their medical history are at a risk of being misinformed.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robeznieks A | title = Getting personal.

== Importance of the physician-patient relationship ==
In cases in which a physician has difficulty explaining complicated medical concepts to a patient, that patient may be inclined to seek information on the internet.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Castro CM, Wilson C, Wang F, Schillinger D | title = Babel babble: physicians' use of unclarified medical jargon with patients | journal = American Journal of Health Behavior | volume = 31 Suppl 1 | pages = S85-95 | date = Sep–Oct 2007 | pmid = 17931142 | doi = 10.5993/ajhb.31.s1.11 }}</ref> A consensus exists that patients should have [[shared decision making]], meaning that patients should be able to make informed decisions about the direction of their medical treatment in collaboration with their physician.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Braddock CH, Edwards KA, Hasenberg NM, Laidley TL, Levinson W | title = Informed decision making in outpatient practice: time to get back to basics | journal = JAMA | volume = 282 | issue = 24 | pages = 2313–20 | date = 22 December 1999 | pmid = 10612318 | doi = 10.1001/jama.282.24.2313 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Rich, educated, and socially advantaged patients may enjoy the benefits of the [[Shared decision-making in medicine|shared decision-making]] approach more than those with a lower [[Social class|socioeconomic class]] or [[Minority group|minority]] status.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fiscella K, Epstein RM | title = So much to do, so little time: care for the socially disadvantaged and the 15-minute visit | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 168 | issue = 17 | pages = 1843–52 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18809810 | pmc = 2606692 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.168.17.1843 }}</ref>

== Social media ==
Social forums in which anyone can have conversations about health with their peers exist; these are especially popular among patients who want to talk about shared medical concerns with others.<ref name="Eysenbach 2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Eysenbach G, Powell J, Englesakis M, Rizo C, Stern A | title = Health related virtual communities and electronic support groups: systematic review of the effects of online peer to peer interactions | journal = BMJ | volume = 328 | issue = 7449 | pages = 1166 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15142921 | pmc = 411092 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.328.7449.1166 }}</ref> Those who participate in online communities that discuss health issues report feeling relieved about their health worries, perceiving they have more control over their health and medical condition, gaining more medical knowledge, and having more personal agency overall.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Barak A, Boniel-Nissim M, Suler J |title=Fostering empowerment in online support groups|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=September 2008|volume=24|issue=5|pages=1867–1883|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2008.02.004}}</ref>

==Academic medical literature==
The written record of peer-reviewed medical consensus is stored in [[scientific journal]]s. There has been an [[academic journal publishing reform]] since the advent of [[electronic publishing]]. Although some journals have adopted an open access template for online users, <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://qims.amegroups.com/|title=Home - Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery|website=qims.amegroups.com|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jmirpublications.com/|title=JMIR Publications|website=www.jmirpublications.com|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> other journals are opposed to a widening of open access publishing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://journals.lww.com/nuclearmedicinecomm/Pages/aboutthejournal.aspx|title=About the Journal : Nuclear Medicine Communications|website=journals.lww.com|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> The open-access policy has significantly increased the accessibility of professional health information to researchers, physicians, and the public through the Internet.

==Personal health information==
For many applications, people wish to use health information on the Internet to gain further insight about a personal health concern. Because of this, the goal is often to use the Internet to find information as it is described in a person's medical record.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In 2013, 72% of US adults used the internet to search for health information.<ref name="Swire">{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040119-094127|doi-access=free|title=Public Health and Online Misinformation: Challenges and Recommendations|year=2020|last1=Swire-Thompson|first1=Briony|last2=Lazer|first2=David|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=41|pages=433–451|pmid=31874069}}</ref> Since the advent of electronic media, medical records have been increasingly kept as [[electronic medical records]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} More healthcare professionals rely on electronic medical records because it is a favorable means for patients to access their personal health information.

===Electronic medical records===
{{main|Electronic medical record}}
An electronic medical record is a [[medical record]] stored on [[electronic media]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tang PC, Ash JS, Bates DW, Overhage JM, Sands DZ | title = Personal health records: definitions, benefits, and strategies for overcoming barriers to adoption | journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–6 | date = 1 March 2006 | pmid = 16357345 | pmc = 1447551 | doi = 10.1197/jamia.M2025 }}</ref> for example, computer servers or hard-drives.

===De-identification===
{{main|De-identification}}
De-identification is an attempt to remove patients' identifiable information from their medical records with the intent of making the information transferable without compromising patients' identities {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. The closer the data is to [[anonymization]], the lesser its value to those who want it {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Research companies and digital advertising companies are among the third parties that use such information in a variety of ways, which include using these patient datasets to reach their target audiences, formulate new medications or collect genetic data for government surveillance. Patients' data is rarely fully anonymized {{need citation|date=April 2020}}. Many controversies regarding the de-identification of patient's data exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html|title=Methods for De-identification of PHI|author=Office for CivilRights (OCR)|date=2012-09-07|website=HHS.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>

==Major sources of information==
===Mobile apps===
[[Mobile app]]s are highly variable in the quality of health information they offer. 95% of cancer information mobile apps targeted at health care workers had scientifically valid information. In contrast, only 32% of cancer information apps aimed at the general public had valid information. Health apps have not been subject to much regulation or oversight. For example, an app by wellness blogger [[Belle Gibson]] promoting alternative, unproven cancer therapies was downloaded over 200,000 times in its first month after its 2013 debut. It reached a rank of #1 in the [[App Store (iOS)|Apple App Store]] and was voted Apple's Best Food and Drink App of 2013. Gibson later admitted that she had never had cancer, as she had claimed when marketing the app.<ref name="Swire"/>

===PubMed===
{{main|PubMed}}
PubMed is a free search engine that primarily lists the [[MEDLINE]] database of peer-reviewed references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics maintained by the  [[United States National Library of Medicine]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]]. When readers search and try to access a manuscript of interest, they are directed to the website of the respective journal where the document was originally published.{{cn|date=May 2020}}
