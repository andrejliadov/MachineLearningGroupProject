The Jewish and Islamic traditions both see circumcision as a way to distinguish a group from its neighbours.<ref>See the story of [[Dinah|Dina & Shechem]] in Genesis.  Also the mass circumcision during the [[exodus from Egypt]].</ref> The [[Bible]] records "uncircumcised" being used as a derogatory reference for opponents{{bibleref2c|1Sam|17:26}} and Jewish victory in battle that culminated in mass post-mortem circumcision, to provide an account of the number of enemy casualties{{bibleref2c|1Sam|18:27}}. Jews were also required to circumcise all household members, including slaves{{bibleref2c|Gen|17:12-14}}&nbsp;– a practice that would later put them into collision with Roman and Christian law (see below).

In the mid-2nd century [[Tannaim|Rabbinical Jewish leaders]] introduced a radical method of circumcision, the ''periah'', that left the glans totally uncovered, making it almost impossible to restore the foreskin.<ref name="restore"/>

Under the first Christian emperor, [[Constantine I|Constantine]], the two rescripts of Antoninus on circumcision were re-enacted and again in the 6th century under [[Justinian]].

There was debate in the early Church on whether [[Gentiles]] needed to be circumcised in order to join the communities; some [[Jewish Christians]] insisted that it was necessary. The [[Council of Jerusalem]] (50 CE) decreed that [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcision]] was not a requirement for Gentiles, which became known as the "[[Council of Jerusalem#Issues and outcome|Apostolic Decree]]".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bechtel |first1=Florentine |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1910 |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm |chapter=Judaizers}}</ref> This was one of the first acts [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|differentiating Early Christianity from Judaism]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kohler |first1=Kaufmann |last2=Krauss |first2=Samuel |title=Jewish Encyclopedia |date=1906 |publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Co |location=New York |chapter-url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2456-baptism |chapter=Baptism}}</ref> Around 140 CE, the [[Tannaim]] made [[Brit milah|circumcision requirements]] stricter, in order to make the procedure irreversible.<ref name=gollaher_2001_ch1>{{cite book |last=Gollaher|first=David|author-link=David Gollaher|title=Circumcision: A History Of The World's Most Controversial Surgery |chapter=1, ''The Jewish Tradition'' |pages=1–30 |date=February 2001 |publisher=Basic Books|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-465-02653-1 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usEzSffvPBMC}}</ref>

In the early 7th century, Muhammad welded together many Semitic tribes of the Arabian peninsula into the kernel of a rapidly expanding Muslim movement. The one thing that can be said with some certainty is that male and female circumcision was already well established among these tribes, and probably had been for more than a thousand years, most likely as a fertility rite. Herodotus had noticed the practice among various Semite nations in the 5th century BCE, and [[Josephus]] had specifically mentioned circumcision as a tradition among Arabs in the 1st century CE.<ref name="Barton">{{cite book |author=George Barton |title=A sketch of Semitic origins, social and religious |year=1902 |publisher=Macmillan |oclc=1850150 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cu31924029872938/page/n117 98]–100 |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924029872938 |isbn=978-1-4286-1575-5}}</ref> There are some narrations attributed to Muhammad in which he approves of female circumcision; many scholars believe that these narrations are weak and lack authenticity.<ref>[http://www.islamicemirate.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=310:female-circumcision-in-islam&catid=69:misconceptions-articles&Itemid=223 Female Circumcision and Islam; Sheikh (Dr.) `Abd al-Rahmân b.

The practice of circumcision is sometimes characterized as a part of ''[[fitrah]]'' as mentioned in the ''[[hadith]]'' (Prophetic narrations).<ref>{{Cite thesis|title=Male circumcision in the United States: The History, an analysis of the discourse, and a philosophical interpretation|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=June 2011|publisher=College of Liberal Arts & Social Sciences Theses and Dissertations|page=29|quote=Unlike the Bible, there is not a lot of mention of circumcision in the Qur'an, but male circumcision is also deeply rooted in the Muslim tradition. Gollaher explains how "Muhammad is reported to have prescribed cutting the foreskin as a fitrah, a measure of personal cleanliness" (Gollaher, p. 45). Also, just as within the Jewish tradition, modern Muslims see this religious practice as not only morally but medically beneficial. A conference of Islamic scholars in 1987 stated that pro-circumcision medical studies "[reflect] the wisdom of the Islamic statements" (Gollaher, p. 47).|citeseerx = 10.1.1.854.2776}}</ref><ref>{{hadith-usc|bukhari|7|72|777}}</ref>

{{POV|date=December 2018}}
During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries many [[Haskalah|Jewish reformers]], doctors, and [[physician]]s in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] proposed to replace circumcision with a symbolic ceremony, while others sought to ban or abolish circumcision entirely,<ref name="Yivo">{{Cquote|In the first half of the nineteenth century, various European governments considered regulating, if not banning, ''berit milah'' on the grounds that it posed potential medical dangers. In the 1840s, radical Jewish reformers in [[Frankfurt]] asserted that circumcision should no longer be compulsory. This controversy reached [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the 1880s. Russian Jewish physicians expressed concern over two central issues: the competence of those carrying out the procedure and the method used for ''metsitsah''. Many Jewish physicians supported the idea of procedural and hygienic reforms in the practice, and they debated the question of physician supervision during the ceremony. Most significantly, many advocated carrying out ''metsitsah'' by pipette, not by mouth. In 1889, a committee on circumcision convened by the Russian Society for the Protection of Health, which included leading Jewish figures, recommended educating the Jewish public about the concerns connected with circumcision, in particular, the possible transmission of diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] and [[syphilis]] through the custom of ''metsitsah'' by mouth.

Veniamin Portugalov, who—alone among Jewish physicians in Russia—called for the abolition of circumcision, set off these discussions. Portugalov not only denied all medical claims regarding the sanitary advantages of circumcision but disparaged the practice as barbaric, likening it to pagan ritual mutilation. Ritual circumcision, he claimed, stood as a self-imposed obstacle to the Jews’ [[Jewish emancipation|attainment of true equality with the other peoples of Europe]].|author=Epstein, Lisa|source=[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Circumcision "Circumcision"], ''[[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]'', [[Yale University Press]].}}</ref> as it was perceived as a dangerous, barbaric and pagan ritual of [[genital mutilation]]<ref name="Yivo" /> that could [[Infectious disease#Transmission|transmit infectious diseases]] to newborns.<ref name="Yivo" /> The [[Religious male circumcision#Criticism and opposition to circumcision|first formal objection to circumcision within Judaism]] occurred in 1843 in [[Frankfurt]].<ref name="Yivo" /><ref name="gollaher_2001_ch1"/> The Society for the Friends of Reform, a group that criticized traditional Jewish practices, said that [[brit milah]] was not a [[mitzvah]] but an outworn legacy from [[Israelites|Israel]]'s earlier phases, an obsolete throwback to primitive religion.<ref name="gollaher_2001_ch1"/> With the expanding role of medicine came further opposition; certain aspects of Jewish circumcision such as ''periah'' and ''metzitzah'' (drawing the blood from the circumcision wound through sucking or a cloth) were deemed unhygienic and dangerous for the newborns.<ref name="Yivo" /><ref name="gollaher_2001_ch1"/> Later evidence that [[syphilis]] and [[tuberculosis]]&nbsp;&ndash; two of the most feared infectious diseases in the 19th century&nbsp;&ndash; were spread by mohels,<ref name="Yivo" /> caused various [[rabbis]] to advocate ''metzitzah'' to be done using a sponge or a tube.<ref name="gollaher_2001_ch1"/> Among the secular, non-observant Jews that chose to not circumcise their sons and keep them intact there was also [[Theodor Herzl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jewishcircumcision.org/spectator.htm|title=Circumcision: A Source of Jewish Pain|access-date=2018-07-28|last=Goldman|first=Ronald|date=1997|website=Jewish Circumcision Resource Center|publisher=Jewish Spectator}}</ref>

[[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' questioned why, if under Jewish doctrine circumcision removed [[original sin]], [[Jesus]] was circumcised&nbsp;&ndash; as Jesus had no original sin. Steve Jones suggests there is a theological tradition that Jesus regained his foreskin at the Ascension.

The Jews were expelled from England by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1290, ostensibly over social tensions concerning [[usury]]. But the public imagination had been gripped by [[blood libel]] since at least the 12th century: "So pervasive was the belief that Jews circumcised their victims ... that Menasseh ben Israil, the Dutch Rabbi who sought from Cromwell the readmission of the Jews in 1656, had to dwell at considerable length in his ''Vindiciae Judaeorum'' at refuting the claim."<ref>{{cite book |author=James Shapiro |title= Shakespeare and the Jews |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BR4BxGfBqrIC&q=england%20expulsion%20jews%20circumcision&pg=PR5 |isbn=978-0-312-21689-4 |year=1998}}</ref>

[[Diego Durán]], a Dominican friar, was convinced that the Aztecs were one of the [[lost tribes of Israel]], with a crucial piece of supporting evidence being that they had practised circumcision.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=193tKPdM-ykC&pg=PR29&lpg=PR29&dq=%22diego+duran%22&source=bl&ots=5sUnkVzJaC&sig=O9N2_izOs4W0Hg39molb6-eyIUY&hl=en&ei=AzFHS6SiIsyHkQXxsdyDAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ6AEwADgy#v=onepage&q=%22diego%20duran%22&f=false  ''The History of the Indies of New Spain''], Chapter 1 concerns the Jewish origins of the Aztecs, a very common idea at the time.

The key being "a certain form", since Bancroft makes clear in a footnote that the majority of his sources, including [[Clavigero]], Ternaux-Compans, Carbajal Espinosa, Oviedo y Herrera, and especially [[José de Acosta|Acosta]], believed Durán and others "confounded the custom of drawing blood from the secret organs with circumcision", and "the incision on the prepuce and ear to have been mistaken for circumcision", adding that this [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|blood-letting rite]]<ref>It is now thought this ubiquitous Mesoamerican ritual dates back to the Olmecs. See [http://www.mesoweb.com/pari/publications/RT08/Bloodletting.pdf Olmec Bloodletting: An Iconographic Study]</ref> was "chiefly performed upon sons of great men" (p279). The case was not helped by the fact no reports of seeing a circumcised adult Aztec existed in the literature. Remondino says it is "a matter of controversy" whether the foreskin had actually been removed (p46).<ref name= "Remondino1891"/>

Countries that do not circumcise have often held antipathy for those that do. Being circumcised was often seen as a sign of disgrace.<ref name="Remondino1891"/> According to Darby, it was also seen as a serious loss of erogenous tissue: "During the Renaissance and 18th century the centrality of the foreskin to male sexual function and the pleasure of both partners was recognised by anatomists Berengario da Carpi, Gabriello Fallopio and William Harvey, in popular sex manuals like Aristotle's ''master-piece'', and by physicians like John Hunter, who also appreciated the importance of the foreskin in providing the slack tissue needed to accommodate an erection."<ref name="darbymja">{{cite journal |last=Darby |first=Robert |date=August 2003 |title=Medical history and medical practice: persistent myths about the foreskin |journal=[[Medical Journal of Australia]] |volume=178 |issue=4 |pages=178–9 |publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]] |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/178_04_170203/dar10676_fm.html |doi=10.5694/j.1326-5377.2003.tb05137.x |pmid=12580747 |s2cid=31875702 |access-date=4 January 2020}}</ref>

In 1650, English physician [[John Bulwer]] in his study of body modification, ''Anthropometamorphosis: Man Transform'd, or the Artificial Changeling'', wrote of the loss in sexual pleasure resulting from circumcision: "the part which hangeth over the end of the foreskin, is moved up and down in coition, that in this attrition it might gather more heat, and increase the pleasure of the other sexe; a contentation of which they [the circumcised] are defrauded by this injurious invention. For, the shortnesse of the prepuce is reckoned among the organical defects of the yard, … yet circumcision detracts somewhat from the delight of women, by lessening their titillation."  The English historian [[Edward Gibbon]], author of ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', referred to the practice as "a painful and often dangerous rite", and a "singular mutilation" practiced only by Jews and [[Turkish people|Turks]].

===History===
Circumcision spread in several English-speaking nations from the late 19th century, with the introduction of anesthesia and antisepsis rapidly expanding surgical practice.{{Cn|date=December 2020}} Doctors such as Sir [[Jonathan Hutchinson]] in England wrote articles in favour of the procedure.<ref name="Hutchinson">{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=38&Itemid=0 |title=Mr Hutchinson on circumcision |access-date=2010-01-03 |publisher=historyofcircumcision.net |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723144701/http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=38&Itemid=0 |archive-date=2011-07-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Peter Charles Remondino]], a San Diego physician, wrote a  ''History of Circumcision from the Earliest Times to the Present: Moral and Physical Reasons for Its Performance'' (1891), to promote circumcision.{{Cn|date=December 2020}} Lewis Sayre, a prominent orthopedic surgeon at the time, was another early American advocate.<ref name="gollaher">{{cite journal |last=Gollaher |first=David |title=From Ritual to Science: The Medical Transformation of Circumcision in America |url=http://www.cirp.org/library/history/gollaher/ |journal=Journal of Social History |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=Fall 1994 |pages=5–36 |publisher=[[George Mason University|George Mason University Press]] |doi=10.1353/jsh/28.1.5 |access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> However, the theories on which many early claims were made, such as the reflex theory of disease and the alleged harmful effects of masturbation, have long since been abandoned by the medical profession.<ref name="gollaher"/>

Dr. [[John Harvey Kellogg]] recommended circumcision of boys caught masturbating, writing: "A remedy for masturbation which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of [[phimosis]]. The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering anaesthetic, as the pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment." But he was opposed to routine circumcision of infants: "It is doubtful, however, whether as much harm as good does not result from circumcision, since it has been shown by extensive observation among the Jews that very great contraction of the meatus, or external orifice of the urethra, is exceedingly common among them, being undoubtedly the result of the prolonged irritation and subsequent cicatricial contraction resulting from circumcision in infancy."<ref>{{cite book |author=John Harvey Kellogg |title=Plain Facts for Young and Old |publisher=F.

This period also saw the formation of anti-circumcision organizations in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and South Africa. Activists began creating websites in the mid-1990s, and this process has continued. One such organization distributed questionnaires to circumcised men. The complaints included prominent [[Circumcision scar|scarring]] (33%), insufficient penile skin for comfortable erection (27%), erectile curvature from uneven skin loss (16%), and pain and bleeding upon erection/manipulation (17%). Psychological complaints included feelings of mutilation (60%), low self-esteem/inferiority to intact men (50%), genital dysmorphia (55%), rage (52%), resentment/depression (59%), violation (46%), or parental betrayal (30%).

=== Medical controversies===

In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP), and the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] (ACOG), which collaborated to produce the 2012 statements issued by the AAP, position paper as of 2012 stated ""In cases such as the decision to perform a circumcision in the newborn period (where there is reasonable disagreement about the balance between medical benefits and harms, where there are nonmedical benefits and harms that can result from a decision on whether to perform the procedure, and where the procedure is not essential to the child’s immediate well-being), the parents should determine what is in the best interest of the child.

====HIV in southern and eastern Africa====
Starting in 2008 and following a framework established in 2007, the WHO and UNAIDS recommended voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) as a means of reducing the rate of HIV infection in eastern and southern Africa, and between 2008 and 2016 11 million adolescent boys and men in the region were circumcised, and the 2016 goal was to reach 90% of males aged 10–29-years by 2021.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voluntary medical male circumcision: a core campaign to reach the Fast-Track Targets|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2016/october/20161017_VMMC|publisher=UNAIDS|date=17 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A framework for voluntary medical male circumcision: effective HIV prevention and a gateway to improved adolescent boys' & men's health in Eastern and Southern Africa by 2021|date=2016|location=World Health Organization|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/246234/1/WHO-HIV-2016.17-eng.pdf}}</ref>

Hammond (1999) asserts that every person has a right to a whole and intact body and that, where minors are concerned, "the unnecessary removal of a functioning body organ in the name of tradition, custom or any other non-disease related cause should never be acceptable to the health profession." He says that such interventions are violations of individual bodily rights and "a breach of fundamental medical ethics principles".<ref name="hammond1999">{{cite journal

Current laws in many countries, and both United States federal law as well as laws in several U.S. states, prohibit the genital modification and mutilation of female minors, with some exceptions based on medical need. Opponents of male circumcision assert that laws against genital modification and mutilation of minors should apply equally to males and females.

However, linking [[male circumcision]] to [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) is itself highly controversial. Organizations actually involved in combating FGM have been at considerable pains to distinguish the two, as this [[UNICEF]] document explains: "When the practice first came to be known beyond the societies in which it was traditionally carried out, it was generally referred to as 'female circumcision'. This term, however, draws a direct parallel with male circumcision and, as a result, creates confusion between these two distinct practices."<ref>[http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/fgm_eng.pdf Changing a harmful social convention, UNICEF]</ref> This stance has been largely echoed by Western medical and political authorities.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} A [[Royal Dutch Medical Association]] viewpoint says that the form of female genital mutilation that resembles non-therapeutic circumcision the most is rejected unanimously throughout literature. The viewpoint also says "FGM takes many forms. There is the most severe form, infibulation, in which the inner and outer labia are stitched together and the clitoris is removed. However, there are also much milder forms of FGM, in which only the foreskin of the clitoris is removed."<ref name="The KNMG Viewpoint of Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors">{{cite web|last1=Kruseman|first1=Arie Nieuwenhuijzen|title=Prof. Dr. Chairman of KNMG|url=http://www.knmg.nl/Publicaties/KNMGpublicatie/77942/Nontherapeutic-circumcision-of-male-minors-2010.htm|website=knmg|access-date=25 December 2015}}</ref>

According to the Nordic Association of Clinical Sexology (2013), "the decision to alter the appearance, sensitivity, and functionality of the penis should be left to its owner, thus upholding his fundamental rights to protection and bodily integrity. Every person's right to bodily integrity goes hand in hand with his or her [[Outline of sexual ethics|sexual autonomy]]."<ref>{{cite web | website=Nordic Association of Clinical Sexology | title= Statement on non-therapeutic circumcision of boys | url= http://nacs.eu/data/press_release001.pdf | date=10 October 2013 | accessdate=22 August 2017}}</ref>

===In U.S. Politics===

{{See also|Circumcision and law}}

Though the issue of infant circumcision is generally not discussed by U.S. politicians,<ref name="Trotter">{{cite web |last1=Trotter |first1=J.K. |title=Anti-circumcision activists are angry with Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang over his stance on the procedure |url=https://www.insider.com/andrew-yang-infant-circumcision-2019-3 |website=Insider |publisher=Insider Inc. |access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref> circumcision controversies have occasionally arisen in the U.S. political system.

In 2011, anti-circumcision activists in [[San Francisco]] gathered over 12,000 signatures to put a measure on the city's ballot in November that would ban circumcisions of males under 18.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Park |first1=Madison |title='Intactivists' to San Francisco: Ban circumcision |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/11/19/male.circumcision.sf/index.html |website=CNN |publisher=Cable News Network |access-date=July 6, 2020}}</ref> Proponents of the ban argued that circumcision is not medically necessary and that the choice should be left up to the child rather than the parents, while opponents of the ban, such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[American Jewish Committee]], argued that circumcision is a recognized medical procedure with clear health benefits and that the measure would violate religious freedoms and cause unnecessary religious strife.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Conley |first1=Mikaela |title=Proposed Circumcision Ban Struck From San Francisco Ballot |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/san-francisco-circumcision-ban-striken/story?id=14179024 |website=ABC News |publisher=ABC News Network |access-date=July 6, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ACLU Urges Court to Invalidate SF Circumcision Initiative |url=https://www.aclunc.org/news/aclu-urges-court-invalidate-sf-circumcision-initiative |website=ACLU Northern California |publisher=The ACLU of Northern California |access-date=July 7, 2020}}</ref> The measure was ultimately removed from the ballot, as a court ruled that it would violate a state law leaving the regulation of medical procedures up to the state rather than cities. Following this incident, California governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed a law specifically preventing localities in California from banning circumcision.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gov. Brown Signs Bill To Prevent Male Circumcision Bans In California |url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/10/02/governor-brown-signs-bill-to-prevent-male-circumcision-bans-in-california/ |website=CBS Local |publisher=CBS Broadcasting Inc. |access-date=July 7, 2020}}</ref>

In 2019, then-candidate for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2020 Democratic presidential nomination]] [[Andrew Yang]] declared himself "[a]gainst the practice" of routine infant circumcision.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sommer |first1=Will |title=Andrew Yang, Upstart Democratic Presidential Candidate, Comes Out Against Circumcision |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/andrew-yang-the-upstart-democratic-presidential-candidate-comes-out-against-circumcision |website=Daily Beast |publisher=The Daily Beast Company |access-date=June 3, 2020}}</ref> This received coverage from several outlets, as major politicians discussing circumcision has been rare, with Yang being the only candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination to talk about it. Though Yang said he would push for giving parents more information about this decision if elected, he also stated that he supported the parents' choice to have their child circumcised for religious or cultural reasons and would not support a ban on the practice. [[Intact America|Intact America's]] Georganne Chapin speculated that Yang's support of parental choice was likely a result of political pressure.<ref name="Trotter" />

===Other contemporary controversies===
====Controversy in India====
While circumcision debates are often dominated by the concerns of Anglophone countries, very different controversies over the procedure regularly erupt in other cultural contexts. In South Asia, [[Pakistan]] has long used circumcision status as a definitive marker of Indian covert involvement in its internal affairs. But this assumption was thrown into confusion when it was discovered that large segments of its own [[Muslim]] male population, specifically from western tribal areas, were themselves uncircumcised.<ref>{{cite news | author=Omer Farooq Khan | title=Circumcision no longer acid test to identify Indian spies | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Pakistan/Circumcision-no-longer-acid-test-to-identify-Indian-spies/articleshow/4387116.cms  | work=The Times of India | date=11 April 2009 }}</ref>

====Controversy in Israel====
Opposition to circumcision<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKRFiC5grxw |title=Explanation of opposing circumcision in Israel}}</ref> exists among [[Jews]] in [[Israel]]. Protests for children's rights have occurred there.<ref>{{Citation|last=Comedy Central|title=The Anti-Circumcision Movement in Israel - The Jim Jefferies Show|date=2018-08-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQkKJBKGAwA|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref> Even though there is often pressure from family on parents to circumcise their sons, "more and more families" are preferring to abstain from circumcision.ref>{{cite news | last =Kasher | first =Rani | title =It's 2017.

====Controversy in South Africa====
In the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] areas of [[South Africa]], the large death toll from traditional circumcision provides a constant source of friction between traditional leaders, who oppose medicalised procedures, and health authorities. In 2009 in the [[Eastern Cape Province]] alone, 80 boys died and hundreds were hospitalized after attending initiation schools.<ref>[http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=368362 Summer circumcision season deaths reach 23]</ref> The controversy looks set to spread to the [[Zulu people|Zulu]], whose present-day [[king Goodwill Zwelithini]] has called for the reintroduction of customary circumcision after it was banned by Zulu king [[Shaka]] in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite news | author=Alex Duval Smith | title=Thousands face agony or death after Zulu king's circumcision decree | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/17/circumcision-zulu-south-africa-hiv | work=The Guardian | date=16 January 2010 }}</ref> Similar issues, though on a smaller scale, have arisen with traditional circumcision of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] in remote areas of central [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite news | vauthors=Statham L | title=Ceremonial circumcisions botched in NT | url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/ceremonial-circumcisions-botched-in-nt-20100111-m2kf.html | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=11 January 2010}}</ref>

====Controversy in Germany====
On June 26, 2012, a court in [[Cologne, Germany]] ruled that circumcision was "inflicting bodily harm on boys too young to consent", deciding that the practice contravenes the "interests of the child to decide later in life on his religious beliefs".<ref name="BBC">{{cite news | title=German court rules circumcision is 'bodily harm' | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18604664 | work=BBC News | date=26 June 2012 | accessdate= 16 September 2017}}</ref> The decision was based on the article "Criminal Relevance of Circumcising Boys. A Contribution to the Limitation of Consent in Cases of Care for the Person of the Child"<ref>Holm Putzke: [http://www.holmputzke.de/images/stories/pdf/2008_fs_herzberg_beschneidung.pdf ''Die strafrechtliche Relevanz der Beschneidung von Knaben.

The ruling was condemned by Jewish and Muslim groups in Europe.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18807040 | work=BBC News | title=Muslim and Jewish groups denounce German circumcision ruling | date=2012-07-12}}</ref> A broad majority of German lawmakers passed a resolution asking [[Angela Merkel]]'s government to clarify the ruling so as to allow Jews and Muslims to continue to practice their religion. On 12 December 2012, following a series of hearings and consultations, the [[Bundestag]] adopted a law explicitly permitting non-therapeutic circumcision to be performed under certain conditions by a vote of 434-100, with 46 abstentions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beschneidung von Jungen jetzt gesetzlich geregelt |url=http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2012/42042381_kw50_de_beschneidung/index.html |language=de}}</ref>
