==Background==
White House deputy chief of staff for implementation [[Kristie Canegallo]] told [[NPR]] that the idea for Obama to write the article originated when he requested a "comprehensive review" of the Affordable Care Act from his staff in late 2015. Canegallo also said that after he received this review, he decided he wanted to share its findings publicly, and that the purpose of Obama's article was to inform future policy makers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/07/11/485228991/obama-renews-call-for-a-public-option-in-federal-health-law|date=2016-07-11|author=Rovner, Julie|title=Obama Renews Call For A 'Public Option' In Federal Health Law|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/new-economy/2016/0712/In-medical-journal-president-defends-Obamacare-suggests-further-reforms|title=In medical journal, president defends 'Obamacare,' suggests further reforms|date=2016-07-12|work=Christian Science Monitor|author=Shekhtman, Lonnie|access-date=2017-11-05|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>

==Peer review==
According to [[Bloomberg News]], the article was not peer-reviewed, but did undergo multiple rounds of editing and fact-checking.<ref name=sciam/> A spokesman for ''JAMA'' said that "The article by President Obama was treated in the same fashion as other Special Communication articles, including undergoing rigorous internal review, two revisions of the manuscript, and subsequent modifications during the editing process as the revised manuscript was reviewed again by the Editor-in-Chief and Executive Editor".<ref name=wapo/> The [[editor-in-chief]] of ''JAMA'', [[Howard Bauchner]], said that the article underwent two months of fact-checking and revisions before being published.<ref name=ever/>
==Accompanying editorials==
Four editorials were also published alongside the article critiquing its conclusions.<ref name=che/> One editorial was written by [[Peter Orszag]], the former director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]] earlier in the Obama administration, and a major architect of the ACA. Orszag argued that the ACA had generally succeeded in its objectives, in line with what Obama argued in his article, while the other three editorials (one by [[Stuart Butler]], one by [[Jonathan Skinner (economist)|Jonathan Skinner]] and Amitabh Chandra, and one by Howard Bauchner) were more critical of Obama's conclusions. For example, the editorial by Skinner and Chandra criticized Obama's claim that the ACA was limiting the growth of health care spending, and Butler's editorial argued that the savings produced by the ACA may not have benefited consumers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/07/13/president-obama-publishes-journal-article|title=President Obama publishes journal article|date=2016-07-13|author=Joselow, Maxine|website=Inside Higher Education|access-date=2017-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2016/07/president_obama_publishes_a_special_communication_in_the_journal_of_the.html|title=Barack Obama, M.D.?|last=Miller|first=Matt|date=2016-07-13|work=Slate|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>

==Conclusions regarding the Affordable Care Act==
In the article, Obama reviews the effects of his signature health care reform law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, widely known as "Obamacare". He concludes that since the law took effect, 20 million more Americans have gained health insurance under it, and the uninsurance rate has dropped to 9.1% (as of 2015).<ref name=wapo/> He also acknowledges that more work remains to be done to improve America's health care system, noting that many Americans still cannot afford many of their medical treatments and visits, or have no health insurance at all.<ref name=sciam/>
==Recommendations==
In the article, Obama recommends that after he leaves office, the next president should introduce a "[[public option]]" for health insurance in parts of the United States where there are few insurers in the marketplace.<ref name=wapo>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/11/the-latest-medical-journal-study-of-obamacare-is-by-president-obama/|title=The latest medical journal study of Obamacare is by â€¦ President Obama|last=Johnson|first=Carolyn Y.|date=2016-07-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> He also calls on his successor to try to reduce prices of [[prescription drug]]s.<ref name=ever>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/07/11/obama-jama/|title=Obama Just Did Something No President Has Ever Done|work=Fortune|date=2016-07-11|author=Roberts, Jeff John|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en}}</ref><ref name=sciam>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/paper-in-a-top-medical-journal-has-an-unexpected-author-barack-obama/|title=Paper in a Top Medical Journal Has an Unexpected Author: Barack Obama|last=Rettner,LiveScience|first=Rachael|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-11-04|language=en}}</ref>
