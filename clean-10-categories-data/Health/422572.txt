==Effects==
===On males===
When used on males, these drugs can reduce sex drive, compulsive sexual fantasies, and capacity for [[sexual arousal]]. Life-threatening side effects are rare, but some users show increases in body fat and reduced bone density, which increase long-term risk of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[osteoporosis]]. They may also experience [[gynecomastia]] (development of larger-than-normal mammary glands in males); full development is less common unless chemical castration is combined with feminizing oestrogen therapy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kanhai |first1=Robert C.J. |last2=Hage |first2=J.

===On females===
{{further|Oophorectomy}}
When used on females, the effects are similar, though there is little research about chemically lowering female's sex drive or female-specific anaphrodisiacs, since most research focuses on the opposite, but anti-androgenic hormone regimens would lower testosterone in females which can impact sex drive or sexual response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/oophorectomy/basics/risks/prc-20012991|title=Oophorectomy (ovary removal surgery) - Risks|website=Mayoclinic.org|accessdate=16 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/Oophorectomy-Risks.aspx|title=Oophorectomy Risks|date=16 August 2010|website=News-medical.net|accessdate=16 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Castelo-Branco |first1=C. |last2=Palacios |first2=S. |last3=Combalia |first3=J. |last4=Ferrer |first4=M. |last5=Traveria |first5=G. |title=Risk of hypoactive sexual desire disorder and associated factors in a cohort of oophorectomized women |journal=Climacteric |date=11 November 2009 |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=525–532 |doi=10.3109/13697130903075345 |pmid=19905904 |s2cid=24700993 }}</ref> These drugs also deflate the breast glands and expand the size of the nipple.

==Treatment for sex offenders==
The first use of chemical castration occurred in 1944, when [[diethylstilbestrol]] was used with the purpose of lowering men's testosterone.<ref name=JAAPL />
The [[antipsychotic]] agent [[benperidol]] was sometimes used to diminish sexual urges in people who displayed as then thought inappropriate sexual behavior, and were likewise given by [[depot injection]]. But benperidol does not affect testosterone and is therefore not a castration agent.
Chemical castration was often seen as an easier alternative to [[life imprisonment]] or the [[death penalty]] because it allowed the release of the convicted.<ref>{{cite news|work=Ocala Star-Banner|date=21 February 1997|title=Bill would impose castration for convicted rapists|page=4B}}</ref>

In 1981, in an experiment by P. Gagne, 48 males with long-standing histories of sexually deviant behaviour were given [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] for as long as 12 months. Forty of those subjects were recorded as having diminished desires for deviant sexual behaviour, less frequent sexual fantasies, and greater control over sexual urges. The research recorded a continuation of this more positive behaviour after the administration of the drug had ended with no evidence of adverse side effects and recommended medroxyprogesterone acetate along with counselling as a successful method of treatment for serial sex offenders.<ref name="apa">{{cite journal |last1=Gagné |first1=P |title=Treatment of sex offenders with medroxyprogesterone acetate |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |date=May 1981 |volume=138 |issue=5 |pages=644–646 |doi=10.1176/ajp.138.5.644 |pmid=6453536 }}</ref>

===Scientific critique===
[[Spaying]] is observed to cause female animals to stop mating in the same way as castration causes male animals to stop mating. However, in animal species where females continue their mating behaviour after being spayed, the males also continue to mate after being castrated. So there are scientists who argue that it makes no biological sense to assume that any treatment that emulates castration would remove sex drive in men but not in women. These scientists argue that these observations, along with the fact that humans are animals are subject to [[evolution]], show that it is flawed to think that male sexuality would be treatable by medication if female sexuality is not.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aunger |first1=Robert |last2=Curtis |first2=Valerie |title=Gaining Control: How human behavior evolved |date=2015 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-100284-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YISBwAAQBAJ }}{{pn|date=December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ruper |first1=Stefani |date=November 12, 2015 |title=The Myth of Female Sexual Complexity |website=Health to Empower |url=https://www.healthtoempower.com/the-myth-of-female-sexual-complexity/ }}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2019}}</ref>

Some criminologists argue that the appearance of a lower recidivism rate in male sex offenders who take chemical castration treatment than in those who do not can be explained by factors other than biological effects of the medication. One hypothesis is that men who accept the negative effects of hormonal treatment in exchange for shorter prison sentence are distinct in that they value freedom from incarceration higher than men who rather stay in prison for a longer time than face the side effects of chemical castration. These criminologists explain apparently lower recidivism as an artifact of men who accept chemical castration being more engaged in hiding the evidence for reoffending, and that paroling such offenders constitute a risk of releasing criminals who commit as many new crimes as others but are better at hiding it. These criminologists also argue that police investigators treating castrated men as less likely to reoffend than non-castrated men may cause an investigation bias and [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], and that men who sell some of their prescribed medicines on the black market for drugs get a hidden income that improve their ability to afford measures to hide recidivism that is not available to men without such prescriptions.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horne |first1=Christine |last2=Lovaglia |first2=Michael J. |title=Experiments in criminology and law: a research revolution |date=2008 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-6027-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieDSAAAAIAAJ }}{{pn|date=December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sismondo |first1=Sergio |last2=Greene |first2=Jeremy A. |title=The Pharmaceutical Studies Reader |date=2015 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-118-89654-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jP-CAAAQBAJ }}{{pn|date=December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Fridell |first1=Lorie A. |title=Producing Bias-Free Policing: A Science-Based Approach |date=2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-33175-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR3KDAAAQBAJ }}{{pn|date=December 2019}}</ref>

Some neurologists acknowledge that testosterone plays a role in sexual arousal but consider that reducing sex drive will likely not reduce inappropriate sex behaviour. These researchers argue that since a weaker internal signal in the brain means a higher requirement for external stimulation to create a feedback loop that tires the brain circuits out as in orgasm and lead to satisfaction, a reduction of the internal stimulation from hormones would make the required external stimulation stronger and also more specific, as weaker signals involve narrower ranges of other brain functions in their loops. These scientists therefore argue that the biological (as opposed to sociological) effect of reduced testosterone is to make it more difficult and not easier to use masturbation without pornography or other socially acceptable substitutes to manage remaining sex drive in a former offender, and that many community persons (both male and female) find that a lower initial arousal makes it more difficult to orgasm by masturbation without pornography or with non-preferred stimulation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Berridge |first1=Kent C. |last2=Kringelbach |first2=Morten L. |title=Pleasure Systems in the Brain |journal=Neuron |date=May 2015 |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=646–664 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018 |pmid=25950633 |pmc=4425246 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Barrett |first1=Lisa Feldman |title=How Emotions Are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain |date=2017 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=978-0-544-12996-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hN8MBgAAQBAJ }}{{pn|date=December 2019}}</ref>

On May 23, 2012, a serial sex offender legally called Park in the court case was ordered by the committee to undergo this treatment after his most recent attempted offense. On January 3, 2013, a South Korean court sentenced a 31-year-old man to 15 years in jail and chemical castration, the country's first-ever chemical castration sentence.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Hindu| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-korean-court-orders-first-chemical-castration/article4269112.ece |title=South Korean court orders first chemical castration|date=3 January 2013|location=Chennai, India}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://nwww.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130103000795 | work=Korea Herald| title=Court issues 1st chemical castration sentence | date=3 January 2013}}</ref> In 2017, the sentencing was extended to include all forms of rapes and sexual assault cases against women, including attempted rape.

===United States===
In 1966, [[John Money]] became the first American to employ chemical castration by prescribing [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] (MPA, the base ingredient now used in [[Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate|DMPA]]) as a treatment for a patient dealing with pedophilic urges.  The drug has thereafter become a mainstay of chemical castration in America. Despite its long history and established use, the drug has never been approved by the FDA for use as a treatment for sexual offenders.<ref name=JAAPL />

California was the first U.S. state to specify the use of chemical castration for repeat [[child molestation|child molesters]] as a condition of their parole, following the passage of a modification to Section 645 of the [[California]] [[penal code]] in 1996.<ref name="califsenate">{{cite web|url=http://www.sen.ca.gov/ftp/SEN/COMMITTEE/STANDING/PUBLICSAFETY/bills/_6bill12.htm |title=XII.

The passage of this law led to similar laws in other states such as Florida's Statute Section 794.0235 which was passed into law in 1997.<ref name="floridalawreview">{{cite journal |title=Florida's 1997 Chemical Castration Law: A Return to the Dark Ages |first=Larry Helm |last=Spalding |journal=[[Florida State University Law Review]] |year=1998 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=117–139 |url=http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/&#91;Spalding&#93;FloridasChemicalCastrationLaw.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613193448/http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/%5BSpalding%5DFloridasChemicalCastrationLaw.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-06-13 }}</ref> As in California, treatment is mandatory after a second offense.

At least seven other states, including [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Iowa]], [[Louisiana]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], [[Texas]] and [[Wisconsin]], have experimented with chemical castration.<ref name=JAAPL /> In Iowa, as in California and Florida, offenders may be sentenced to chemical castration in all cases involving serious sex offenses.

====Objections====

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of [[Florida]] opposes the administration of any drug that is dangerous or has significant irreversible effect as an alternative to incarceration; however, they do not oppose the use of antiandrogen drugs for sex offenders under carefully controlled circumstances as an alternative to incarceration.<ref name="aclufl">{{cite journal | publisher=Florida State University Law Review | title=Florida's 1997 Chemical Castration Law: A Return to the Dark Ages | author=Larry Helm Spalding | volume=25:117 | pages=124 | url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&doctype=cite&docid=25+Fla.+St.+U.L.+Rev.+117&key=764569c9c4bb55ecfefa69a00154ff9d | quote=Furthermore, the ACLU of Florida opposes any attempt to offer a defendant the opportunity to avoid incarceration by taking a drug that is dangerous or that has a significant irreversible effect on an individual’s cognitive capacity or an important physical function, such as the ability to conceive children. The ACLU of Florida does not oppose the use of antiandrogen drugs under certain controlled circumstances as an alternative to incarceration for convicted sex offenders. Because the ACLU of Florida respects individual autonomy and supports the principle that punishment should be no more restrictive of liberty than necessary, an individual’s choice of whether to accept an antiandrogen drug is entitled to considerable respect. In addition, because this choice arises in the inherently coercive context of sentencing, and because of the capacity for abuse of this sentencing option, such treatment should be available only under the most carefully controlled circumstances. | date=1998 | access-date=March 15, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917032737/https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&doctype=cite&docid=25+Fla.+St.+U.L.+Rev.+117&key=764569c9c4bb55ecfefa69a00154ff9d | archive-date=September 17, 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref>  Law professor John Stinneford has argued that chemical castration is a [[cruel and unusual punishment]] because it exerts control over the mind of sex offenders to render them incapable of sexual desire and subjects them to the physical changes caused by the female hormones used.<ref>{{cite document|title=Incapacitation through Maiming: Chemical Castration, the Eighth Amendment, and the Denial of Human Dignity|first=John F.|last=Stinneford|date=20 July 2006|ssrn = 918271}}</ref>

Some people have argued that, based on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], the procedure fails to guarantee equal protection: although the laws mandating the treatment do so without respect to gender, the actual effect of the procedure disproportionately falls upon men.<ref name=JAAPL>[http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/31/4/502.pdf "Castration of Sex Offenders: Prisoners’ Rights Versus Public Safety"] Charles L. Scott, MD, and Trent Holmberg, MD</ref> In the case of voluntary statutes, the ability to give [[informed consent]] is also an issue; in 1984, the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]'s court of appeals held that mandating chemical castration as a condition of probation was unlawful on the grounds that the drug [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] had not yet gained acceptance as being safe and reliable and also due to the difficulty of obtaining informed consent under these circumstances.<ref name="JAAPL" />

==Treatment of cancer==
A major medical use of chemical castration is in the treatment of hormone-dependent cancers, such as some [[prostate cancer]], where it has largely replaced the practice of surgical castration.<ref name="cruk">{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/type/prostate-cancer/treatment/hormone/about-hormone-therapy-for-prostate-cancer|title=About hormone therapy for prostate cancer|work=cancerresearchuk.org|date=2017-08-30}}</ref><ref name="LIFEonADT">{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeonadt.com/the-adt-book/|title=The ADT Book|work=Life on ADT}}</ref>

Chemical castration involves the administration of [[antiandrogen]] drugs, such as [[cyproterone acetate]], [[flutamide]], or [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist]]s.
