The Peruvian jungle experienced 14 oil spills from the beginning of the pandemic through early October 2020. Of these, eight spills were in a single sector operated by [[Frontera Energy|Frontera Energy del Perú S.A.]] which ceased operations during the pandemic and is not maintaining its wells and pipes.

=== Fossil fuel industry ===
A report by the London-based think tank [[Carbon Tracker]] concludes that the COVID-19 pandemic may have pushed the fossil fuel industry into "terminal decline" as demand for oil and gas decreases while governments aim to accelerate the clean energy transition. It predicts that an annual 2% decline in demand for fossil fuels could cause the future profits of oil, gas and coal companies to collapse from an estimated $39tn to $14tn.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pandemic is triggering 'terminal decline' of fossil fuel industry, says report |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/world/coronavirus-climate-change-fossil-fuel-oil-gas-a9547301.html |access-date=6 June 2020 |work=The Independent |date=3 June 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="guardian-fossilfuels">{{cite news |last1=Ambrose |first1=Jillian |title=Coronavirus crisis could cause $25tn fossil fuel industry collapse |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/04/coronavirus-crisis-collapse-fossil-fuels-demand |access-date=6 June 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=3 June 2020}}</ref> However, according to [[Bloomberg New Energy Finance]] more than half a trillion dollars worldwide are currently intended to be poured into high-carbon industries.<ref name="guardian-recovery">{{cite news |title=Covid-19 relief for fossil fuel industries risks green recovery plans |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/06/covid-19-relief-for-fossil-fuel-industries-risks-green-recovery-plans |access-date=6 June 2020 |work=the Guardian |date=6 June 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Preliminary disclosures from the [[Bank of England]]'s Covid Corporate Financing Facility indicate that billions of pounds of taxpayer support are intended to be funneled to fossil fuel companies.<ref name="guardian-recovery"/> According to [[Reclaim Finance]] the [[European Central Bank]] intends to allocate as much as €220bn (£193bn) to fossil fuel industries.<ref name="guardian-recovery"/> An assessment by [[Ernst & Young]] finds that a stimulus program that focuses on renewable energy and climate-friendly projects could create more than 100,000 direct jobs across Australia and estimates that every $1m spent on renewable energy and exports creates 4.8 full-time jobs in renewable infrastructure while $1m on fossil fuel projects would only create 1.7 full-time jobs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Renewable energy stimulus can create three times as many Australian jobs as fossil fuels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/07/renewable-energy-stimulus-three-times-as-many-australia-jobs-fossil-fuels-coronavirus-economic-recovery |access-date=7 June 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=7 June 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

In addition, also due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic [[Financial market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|on the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry]], natural gas prices have dropped so low that gas producers were [[Flaring|burning if off on-site]] (not being worth the cost to transport it to [[Ethane#Uses|cracking facilities]]). Bans on single-use consumer plastic (in China, the European Union, Canada, and many countries in Africa), and bans on plastic bags (in several states in the USA) have also reduced demand for plastics considerably. Many cracking facilities in the USA have been suspended. The petrochemical industry has been trying to save itself by attempting to rapidly expand demand for plastic products worldwide (i.e. through pushbacks on plastic bans and by increasing the number of products wrapped in plastic in countries where plastic use is not already as widespread (i.e. developing nations)).<ref>[https://time.com/5831005/coronavirus-plastic-industry/ Will coronavirus be the death or salvation of Big Plastic ?]</ref>

With the 2020 [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] outbreak spreading rapidly within the European Union, the focus on the [[European Green Deal]] diminished.

According to a report commissioned by the [[High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy]] and published in July 2020, investment in four key ocean intervention areas could help aid economic recovery and yield high returns on investment in terms of economic, environmental and health benefits. According to Jackie Savitz, chief policy officer for America ocean conservation nonprofit [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]], strategies such as "setting science-based limits on fishing so that stocks can recover, practicing selective fishing to protect endangered species and ensuring that fishing gear doesn't destroy ocean habitats are all effective, cost-efficient ways to manage [[sustainable seafood|sustainable fisheries]]".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pfeifer |first1=Hazel |title=Ocean investment could aid post-Covid-19 economic recovery |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/13/world/ocean-investment-world-resources-institute-cte/index.html |access-date=30 September 2020 |work=CNN}}</ref>

The pandemic has also impacted [[environmental policy]] and [[climate policy|climate diplomacy]], as the [[2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] was postponed to 2021 in response to the pandemic after its venue was converted to a field hospital. This conference was crucial as nations were scheduled to submit enhanced [[Intended nationally determined contributions|nationally determined contributions]] to the [[Paris Agreement]]. The pandemic also limits the ability of nations, particularly developing nations with low state capacity, to submit nationally determined contributions, as they are focusing on the pandemic.<ref name="UN"/>

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' highlighted three possible risks: that preparations for the November 2020 Glasgow conference planned to follow the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] were disrupted; that the public would see global warming as a lower priority issue than the pandemic, weakening the pressure on politicians; and that a desire to "restart" the global economy would cause an excess in extra [[greenhouse gas]] production. However the drop in oil prices during the [[COVID-19 recession]] could be a good opportunity to get rid of [[fossil fuel]] subsidies, according to the Executive Director of the [[International Energy Agency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/commentaries/put-clean-energy-at-the-heart-of-stimulus-plans-to-counter-the-coronavirus-crisis|title=Put clean energy at the heart of stimulus plans to counter the coronavirus crisis – Analysis|website=[[International Energy Agency]]|access-date=9 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200402134500/https://www.iea.org/commentaries/put-clean-energy-at-the-heart-of-stimulus-plans-to-counter-the-coronavirus-crisis|archive-date=2 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

The restarting of [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] producing industries and transport following the COVID-19 lockdowns was hypothesized as an event that would contribute to increasing greenhouse gas production rather than reducing it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2020/03/26/the-epidemic-provides-a-chance-to-do-good-by-the-climate|title=The epidemic provides a chance to do good by the climate|work=The Economist|access-date=21 April 2020|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>  In the transport sector, the pandemic could trigger several effects, including behavioral changes – such as more [[Telecommuting|teleworking]] and [[Teleconference|teleconferencing]] and changes in business models – which could, in turn, translate in reductions of emissions from transport.

Chaos and the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have made a catastrophic future seem less remote and action to prevent it more necessary and reasonable.
