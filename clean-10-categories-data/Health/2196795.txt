'''Apparent death''', colloquially known as '''playing dead''', '''feigning death''', or '''playing possum''', is a behavior in which animals take on the appearance of being [[death|dead]].  This form of [[Deception in animals|animal deception]] is an [[adaptive behavior (ecology) |adaptive behavior]] also known as '''tonic immobility''' or '''thanatosis'''.  Apparent death can be used as a [[Antipredator adaptation|defense mechanism]] or as a form of [[aggressive mimicry]], and occurs in a wide range of animals.

When induced by humans, the state is sometimes colloquially known as '''animal hypnosis'''.  According to Gilman et al.,<ref name="Gilman et al., 1950">{{cite journal | last1 = Gilman | first1 = T.T. | last2 = Marcuse | first2 = F.L. | last3 = Moore | first3 = A.U. | year = 1960 | title = Animal hypnosis: a study of the induction of tonic immobility in chickens | journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology and Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 99–111 | doi = 10.1037/h0053659 | pmid = 15415476 }}</ref> the investigation of "animal hypnosis" dates back to the year 1646 in a report by [[Athanasius Kircher]].

Tonic immobility (TI) is a behaviour in which some animals become apparently temporarily [[paralysed]] and unresponsive to external stimuli.  In most cases this occurs in response to an extreme threat such as being captured by a (perceived) predator. However, in [[shark]]s exhibiting the behaviour, some scientists relate it to mating, arguing that biting by the male immobilizes the female and thus facilitates mating.<ref name="Henningsen">{{cite journal | last1 = Henningsen | first1 = A.D. | year = 1994 | title = Tonic immobility in 12 elasmobranchs - use as an aid in captive husbandry | journal = Zoo Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 325–332 | doi = 10.1002/zoo.1430130406 }}</ref>

Despite appearances, the animal remains conscious throughout tonic immobility.<ref name="Jones 1986">{{cite journal|author=Jones, R.B|title=The tonic immobility reaction of the domestic fowl: a review|journal=World's Poultry Science Journal|volume=42|issue=1|year=1986|pages=82–96|doi=10.1079/WPS19860008}}</ref> Evidence for this includes the occasional responsive movement, scanning of the environment and animals in TI often taking advantage of escape opportunities.

===In sharks===
Some sharks can be induced into tonic immobility by inverting them and restraining them by hand, e.g. [[dogfish sharks]], [[lemon shark]]s, [[whitetip reef shark]]s.<ref name="Henningsen"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Whitman | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Marshall | first2 = J.A. | last3 = Keller | first3 = E.C.Jr | year = 1986 | title = Tonic immobility in the smooth dogfish shark, ''Mustelus canis'' (Pisces, Carcharhinidae) | journal = Copeia | volume = 1986 | issue = 3| pages = 829–832 | doi = 10.2307/1444973 | jstor = 1444973 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Watsky | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Gruber | first2 = S.H. | year = 1990 | title = Induction and duration of tonic immobility in the lemon shark, ''Negaprion brevirostris'' | journal = Fish Physiology and Biochemistry | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 207–210 | doi = 10.1007/bf00004459 | pmid = 24221983 | s2cid = 6763380 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Davie | first1 = P.S. | last2 = Franklin | first2 = C.E. | last3 = Grigg | first3 = G.C. | year = 1993 | title = Blood pressure and heart rate during tonic immobility in the black tipped reef shark, ''Carcharhinus melanoptera'' | journal = Fish Physiology and Biochemistry | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 95–100 | doi = 10.1007/bf00004374 | pmid = 24202688 | s2cid = 19258658 }}</ref>  For [[tiger shark]]s (measuring 3–4 metres in length), tonic immobility can be induced by humans placing their hands lightly on the sides of the animal's snout in the area surrounding the eyes. During tonic immobility in sharks, the dorsal fins straighten, and both breathing{{Disputed inline|Sharks breathing|date=May 2020}} and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed. This state persists for an average of 15 minutes before recovery and the resumption of active behaviour.  Scientists have exploited this response to study shark behaviour; chemical [[shark repellent]] has been studied to test its effectiveness and to more accurately estimate dose sizes, concentrations and time to recovery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tonic immobility|website=Shark defense: Chemical repellents|url=http://www.sharkdefense.com/Repellents/Tonic_Immobility/tonic_immobility.html|accessdate=January 28, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614111606/http://www.sharkdefense.com/Repellents/Tonic_Immobility/tonic_immobility.html|archive-date=June 14, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> Tonic immobility can also be used as a form of mild anesthesia during experimental manipulations of sharks.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heithaus | first1 = M.R. | last2 = Dill | first2 = L.M. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = G.J. | last4 = Buhleier | first4 = B. | year = 2002 | title = Habitat use and foraging behavior of tiger sharks (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') in a seagrass ecosystem | journal = Marine Biology | volume = 140 | issue = 2| pages = 237–248 | doi = 10.1007/s00227-001-0711-7 | s2cid = 83545503 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Holland | first1 = K.N. | last2 = Wetherbee | first2 = B.M. | last3 = Lowe | first3 = C.G. | last4 = Meyer | first4 = C.G. | year = 1999 | title = Movements of tiger sharks (''Galeocerdo cuvier'') in coastal Hawaiian waters | journal = Marine Biology | volume = 134 | issue = 4| pages = 665–673 | doi = 10.1007/s002270050582 | s2cid = 7687775 }}</ref>

Scientists also believe that tonic immobility can be a stressful experience for sharks. By measuring blood chemistry samples when the shark is immobile, it has been suggested that tonic immobility can actually put stress on the shark, and reduce breathing efficiency. However, it has also been proposed that sharks have a series of compensatory mechanisms that work to increase respiration rates and lower stress.<ref>Brooks, E. J., et al. "The Stress Physiology of Extended Duration Tonic Immobility in the Juvenile Lemon Shark, Negaprion Brevirostris (Poey 1868)." ''Journal of experimental marine biology and ecology'' 409.1-2 (2011): 351-60.</ref>

It has been observed that orcas can exploit sharks' tonic immobility to prey on large sharks. Some orcas ram sharks from the side to stun them, then flip the sharks to induce tonic immobility and keep them in such state for sustained time. For some sharks, this prevents water from flowing through their gills and the result can be fatal.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Lauren Smith|title=Orcas vs great white sharks: in a battle of the apex predators who wins?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/nov/16/orca-whales-vs-great-white-sharks-in-a-battle-of-the-apex-predators-who-wins|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=2017-11-18|date=2017-11-16}}</ref>

===In teleost fishes===
[[Goldfish]], [[trout]], [[rudd]], [[tench]], [[brown bullhead]], [[medaka]], [[paradise fish]], and [[topminnow]] have been reported to go limp when they are restrained on their backs.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Table | last2 = Whitman | first2 = P.A. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = J.A. | last4 = Keller | first4 = E.C.Jr | year = 1986 | title = Tonic immobility in the smooth dogfish shark, ''Mustelus canis'' (Pisces, Carcharhinidae) | journal = Copeia | volume = 1986 | issue = 3| pages = 829–832 | doi = 10.2307/1444973| jstor = 1444973}}</ref> [[oscar (fish)|Oscars]] seem to go into shock when they are stressed (when their aquarium is being cleaned, for example): they lie on their side, stop moving their fins, start to breathe more slowly and deeply, and lose colour.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Crawford | first1 = F.T. | year = 1977 | title = Induction and duration of tonic immobility | journal = The Psychological Record | volume = 27 | pages = 89–107 | doi = 10.1007/bf03394435 | s2cid = 149316109 }}</ref>  A similar behavior has been reported for [[convict tang]]s in the field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Howe | first1 = J.C. | year = 1991 | title = Field observations of death feigning in the convict tang, ''Acanthurus triostegus'' (Linnaeus), with comments on the nocturnal color pattern in juvenile specimens | journal = Journal of Aquariculture and Aquatic Sciences | volume = 6 | pages = 13–15 }}</ref>

===In reptiles===
Tonic immobility can be reliably induced in [[iguana]]s by a combination of inversion, restraint and moderate pressure. During TI, there are obvious changes in respiration including a decline in respiration rate, the rhythm becomes sporadic, and the magnitude irregular.  The prolonged period of TI does not seem to be consistent with the fear hypothesis, but could be the result of a period of cortical depression due to increased brain stem activity.<ref name="Prestrude">{{cite journal|author1=Prestrude, A.M.  |author2=Crawford, F.T.|title=Tonic immobility in the lizard, iguana iguana|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=18|issue=2|year=1970|pages=391–395|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(70)80052-5}}</ref>

Tonic immobility can also be induced in the [[Carolina anole]].  The characteristics of this TI vary as a function of the duration and condition of captivity.<ref name="Hennig">{{cite journal|title=Tonic immobility in Anolis carolinensis: Effects of time and conditions of captivity|year=1978|journal=Behavioral Biology|author1=Hennig, C.W  |author2=Dunlap, W.P.|volume=23|issue=1|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/s0091-6773(78)91180-x}}</ref>

===In rabbits===
{{POV-section|date=June 2020}}
In 2006, a single study in [[rabbit]]s tried to find a link between a fear-motivated stress state and some of the physiological responses induced by tonic immobility. Researchers observed an increase in heart rate and breathing immediately following periods of tonic immobility, and while these comprise an expected physiologic reaction to sudden position change,<ref name="Cotsamire et al.">{{cite journal |last1=Cotsamire |first1=DL |year=1987 |title=Position as a Variable for Cardiovascular responses during exercise |journal=Clinical Cardiology |volume= 10|issue= 3|pages=137–142 |doi= 10.1002/clc.4960100302|pmid=3829483 |s2cid=19484779 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> the data were nonetheless used to advance a conclusion that despite the appearance of deep relaxation, the rabbits are actually in fear for their lives.<ref name="McBride et al.">{{cite journal |last1=McBride |first1=Anne |year=2006 |title=Trancing rabbits: Relaxed hypnosis or a state of fear? |journal=Proceedings of the VDWE International Congress on Companion Animal Behaviour and Welfare |pages=135–137 |url=http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/54860 |accessdate=September 2, 2013 |display-authors=etal }} (downloadable .doc file). • Click [http://www.hopperhome.com/Trancing%20Rabbits-Tonic%20Immobility%20.pdf here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124225101/http://hopperhome.com/Trancing%20Rabbits-Tonic%20Immobility%20.pdf |date=2010-11-24 }} for PDF copy from hopperhome.com.</ref> While the study failed to explore why rabbits seem to enjoy self-induction of tonic immobility and are sometimes found sleeping on their backs, it is now routinely cited to support a notion that rabbits actually hate what they appear to enjoy. The researchers did allow for induction of tonic immobility in rabbits as appropriate for certain veterinary procedures, as it holds less risk than anesthesia.<ref name="McBride et al." />

===As a scientific tool===
Tonic immobility is considered to be a fear-potentiated response induced by physical restraint and characterised by reduced responsiveness to external stimulation.  It has been used as a measure in the assessment of animal welfare, particularly hens, since 1970.<ref name="Gallup et al., 1970">{{cite journal | last1 = Gallup | first1 = G.G.

The precept is that the prey animal 'pretends' to be dead to be able to escape when/if the predator relaxes its concentration.

To induce tonic immobility, the animal is gently restrained on its side or back for a period of time, e.g. 15 seconds.  This is done either on a firm, flat surface or sometimes in a purpose-built ‘V’- or ‘U’-shaped restraining cradle. In rodents, the response is sometimes induced by additionally pinching or attaching a clamp to the skin at the nape of the neck.<ref name="Zamudio et al., 2009">{{cite journal | last1 = Zamudio | first1 = S.R. | last2 = Quevedo-Corona | first2 = L. | last3 = Garcés | first3 = L. | last4 = De La Cruz | first4 = F. | year = 2009 | title = The effects of acute stress and acute corticosterone administration on the immobility response in rats | journal = Brain Research Bulletin | volume = 80 | issue = 6| pages = 331–336 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.09.005 | pmid = 19772903 | s2cid = 24347387 }}</ref>  Scientists record behaviours such as the number of inductions (15-second restraining periods) required for the animal to remain still, the latency to the first major movements (often cycling motions of the legs), latency to first head or eye movements and the duration of immobility, sometimes called the ‘righting time’.

In [[ethology|animal behaviour]], thanatosis (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|θανάτωσις}}, meaning "putting to death"; ''[[cf. ]]'': [[Thanatos]]) is the process by which an animal feigns death in order to evade unwelcome attention. It can be for various reasons, such as that of a [[prey]] evading a [[predator]], a male trying to [[mating|mate]] with a female, or a predator trying to lure potential prey closer. The [[French people|French]] biologist [[Georges Pasteur]] classifies it as a form of ''self-mimesis'', a form of [[camouflage]] or [[mimicry]] in which the "mimic" imitates itself in a dead state.<ref name=Pasteur />

For defensive purposes, thanatosis hinges on the pursuer's becoming unresponsive to its victim, as most predators only catch live prey.<ref name=Pasteur>{{cite journal | last1 = Pasteur | first1 = G | year = 1982 | title = A classificatory review of mimicry systems | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 13 | pages = 169–199 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 }}</ref>

In beetles, artificial selection experiments have shown that there is heritable variation for length of death-feigning. Those selected for longer death-feigning durations are at a selective advantage to those at shorter durations when a predator is introduced,<ref name="beetle">{{Cite journal|last1=Miyatake|first1 = T|last2 = Katayama|first2 = K.|last3 = Takeda|first3 = Y.|last4 = Nakashima|first4 = A.|last5 = Mizumoto|first5 = M.|year = 2004|title = Is death-feigning adaptive?

In the [[Hognose|hog-nosed snake]], a threatened individual rolls onto its back and appears to be dead when threatened by a predator, while a foul-smelling, volatile fluid oozes from its body. Predators, such as [[cat]]s, then lose interest in the snake, which both looks and smells dead. One reason for their loss of interest is that rotten-smelling animals are avoided as a precaution against infectious disease, so the snake is, in this case, exploiting that reaction. Newly hatched young also instinctively show this behaviour when [[rat]]s try to eat them.<ref>''Triumph of Life'' (2006). Alexandria, VA: PBS Home Video.</ref>

In mammals, the [[Virginia opossum]] is perhaps the best known example of defensive thanatosis. "[[wikt:play possum|Playing possum]]" is an idiomatic phrase which means "pretending to be dead".<ref name="dict">{{cite book|title =The Chambers Dictionary|publisher =Allied Publishers|year =1998|page=1279|isbn =978-81-86062-25-8|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=pz2ORay2HWoC}}</ref> It comes from a characteristic of the Virginia opossum, which is famous for pretending to be dead when threatened.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Francq|first = E.|year = 1969|title = Behavioural aspects of feigned death in the opossum ''Didelphis marsupialis''|journal = American Midland Naturalist|volume = 81|pages = 556–568|doi = 10.2307/2423988|issue = 2|jstor = 2423988}}</ref><ref name="wwa">{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderfulwv.com/archives/july00/fea2.cfm |title=Playing Possum |publisher=Wonderful West Virginia |author=Ann Bailey Dunn |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001110406/http://www.wonderfulwv.com/archives/july00/fea2.cfm |archive-date=October 1, 2011 }}</ref> This [[instinct]] does not always pay off in the modern world; for example, opossums scavenging [[roadkill]] may use it in response to the threat posed by oncoming traffic, and subsequently end up as roadkill themselves.<ref name="ma">{{cite web|url=http://www.massaudubon.org/Nature_Connection/wildlife/index.php?subject=Mammals&id=71|title=Virginia Opossum|publisher=Mass Audubon|accessdate=May 11, 2011|quote=Opossums are frequently encountered as corpses along highways.

The usual advice for humans attempting to survive an attack by a [[brown bear]] is to lie face down, cover the face with one’s hands/arms/elbows, and 'play dead'; hopefully the bear will get bored and wander away after a while.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/stories/how-to-survive-a-bear-attack | title=How to survive a bear attack}}</ref>

"Playing possum" can also mean simply pretending to be injured, [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]], [[asleep]], or otherwise vulnerable, often to lure an opponent into a vulnerable position him or herself.<ref name="dict"/>

Thanatosis has also been observed in some invertebrates such as the wasp ''[[Nasonia vitripennis]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last = King|first = B.|author2=H.

===For reproduction===
In the spider species ''[[Pisaura mirabilis]]'', male spiders often stage elaborate rituals of [[Nuptial gift (animal behavior)|gift-giving]] and thanatosis to avoid getting eaten by female spiders during mating. Studies have shown higher chances of success in mating with females for males who exhibit death-feigning more frequently than for males who do it less.<ref name="spider">{{cite journal|author1=Line Spinner Hansen |author2=Sofia Fernandez Gonzales |author3=Søren Toft |author4=Trine Bilde |year=2008|title=Thanatosis as an adaptive male mating strategy in the nuptial gift–giving spider ''Pisaura mirabilis''|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=19 |issue=3|pages=546–551|doi=10.1093/beheco/arm165|url=http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/3/546.full|accessdate=May 11, 2011 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

===For predation===
''[[Nimbochromis]]'' (sleeper cichlids), [[endemic]] to [[Lake Malawi]] in [[East Africa]], are large predatory fish for whom thanatosis is a form of aggressive mimicry. This fish will lie down on its side on the bottom sediments and assume a blotchy coloration. Scavengers, attracted to what seems like a dead fish, will approach the predator to investigate. ''N. livingstoni'' then abandons the pretense, righting itself again and quickly eating any scavenger unfortunate enough to come too close.<ref name="fish">{{cite book|author1=Gene S.
