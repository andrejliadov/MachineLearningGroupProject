'''Alcohol dehydrogenases''' ('''ADH''') ({{EC number|1.1.1.1}}) are a group of [[dehydrogenase]] [[enzyme]]s that occur in many organisms and facilitate the interconversion between [[alcohol]]s and [[aldehyde]]s or [[ketone]]s with the reduction of [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD<sup>+</sup>) to NADH. In [[human]]s and many other [[animal]]s, they serve to break down alcohols that otherwise are toxic, and they also participate in generation of useful aldehyde, ketone, or alcohol groups during biosynthesis of various [[metabolites]]. In [[yeast]], plants, and many [[bacteria]], some alcohol dehydrogenases [[catalysis|catalyze]] the opposite reaction as part of [[fermentation]] to ensure a constant supply of NAD<sup>+</sup>.

== Evolution ==
Genetic evidence from comparisons of multiple organisms showed that a [[glutathione]]-dependent [[formaldehyde dehydrogenase]], identical to a [[ADH5|class III alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH-3/ADH5), is presumed to be the ancestral enzyme for the entire ADH family.<ref name="pmid1731906">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gutheil WG, Holmquist B, Vallee BL | title = Purification, characterization, and partial sequence of the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli: a class III alcohol dehydrogenase | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 475–81 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1731906 | doi = 10.1021/bi00117a025 }}</ref><ref name="pmid1409630">{{cite journal | vauthors = Danielsson O, Jörnvall H | title = "Enzymogenesis": classical liver alcohol dehydrogenase origin from the glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase line | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 89 | issue = 19 | pages = 9247–51 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 1409630 | pmc = 50103 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.19.9247 | bibcode = 1992PNAS...89.9247D }}</ref><ref name="pmid19011751">{{cite journal | vauthors = Persson B, Hedlund J, Jörnvall H | title = Medium- and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase gene and protein families : the MDR superfamily | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 65 | issue = 24 | pages = 3879–94 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19011751 | pmc = 2792335 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-008-8587-z }}</ref> Early on in evolution, an effective method for eliminating both endogenous and exogenous formaldehyde was important and this capacity has conserved the ancestral ADH-3 through time.

The ability to produce [[ethanol]] from sugar (which is the basis of how alcoholic beverages are made) is believed to have initially evolved in [[yeast]]. Though this feature is not adaptive from an energy point of view, by making alcohol in such high concentrations so that they would be toxic to other organisms, yeast cells could effectively eliminate their competition. Since rotting fruit can contain more than 4% of ethanol, animals eating the fruit needed a system to metabolize exogenous ethanol. This was thought to explain the conservation of ethanol active ADH in species other than yeast, though ADH-3 is now known to also have a major role in [[Signal transduction#Nitric oxide|nitric oxide signaling]].<ref name="pmid19011746">{{cite journal | vauthors = Staab CA, Hellgren M, Höög JO | title = Medium- and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase gene and protein families : Dual functions of alcohol dehydrogenase 3: implications with focus on formaldehyde dehydrogenase and S-nitrosoglutathione reductase activities | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 65 | issue = 24 | pages = 3950–60 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19011746 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-008-8592-2 | s2cid = 8574022 }}</ref><ref name="pmid16763671">{{cite journal | vauthors = Godoy L, Gonzàlez-Duarte R, Albalat R | title = S-Nitrosogluthathione reductase activity of amphioxus ADH3: insights into the nitric oxide metabolism | journal = International Journal of Biological Sciences | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 117–24 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16763671 | pmc = 1458435 | doi = 10.7150/ijbs.2.117 }}</ref>

In humans, sequencing of the [[ADH1B]] gene (responsible for production of an alcohol dehydrogenase [[polypeptide]]) shows several functional variants. In one, there is a [[single nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] (single nucleotide polymorphism) that leads to either a Histidine or an Arginine residue at position 47 in the mature polypeptide.

Classical [[Darwinian evolution]] would act to select against the detrimental form of the enzyme (Arg variant) because of the lowered reproductive success of individuals carrying the allele. The result would be a higher frequency of the allele responsible for the His-variant enzyme in regions that had been under selective pressure the longest. The distribution and frequency of the His variant follows the spread of rice cultivation to inland regions of Asia, with higher frequencies of the His variant in regions that have cultivated rice the longest.<ref name="whitfield" /> The geographic distribution of the alleles seems to therefore be a result of natural selection against individuals with lower reproductive success, namely, those who carried the Arg variant allele and were more susceptible to alcoholism.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eng|first1=Mimi Y | name-list-style = vanc |title=Alcohol Research and Health|journal=Alcohol Health & Research World |date=2007-01-01|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|issn=1535-7414}}</ref> However, the persistence of the Arg variant in other populations argues that the effect could not be strong.

== Properties ==
The alcohol dehydrogenases comprise a group of several [[isozyme]]s that catalyse the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively, and also can catalyse the reverse reaction.<ref name="Sofer" /> In mammals this is a [[redox]] (reduction/oxidation) reaction involving the [[coenzyme]] [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD<sup>+</sup>).

== Oxidation of alcohol ==

=== Mechanism of action in humans ===

==== Steps ====
# Binding of the coenzyme NAD<sup>+</sup>
# Binding of the alcohol substrate by coordination to zinc
# Deprotonation of His-51
# Deprotonation of nicotinamide ribose
# Deprotonation of Thr-48
# Deprotonation of the alcohol
# Hydride transfer from the [[alkoxide]] ion to NAD<sup>+</sup>, leading to NADH and a zinc bound aldehyde or ketone
# Release of the product aldehyde.

The mechanism in yeast and bacteria is the reverse of this reaction. These steps are supported through kinetic studies.<ref name="Hammes">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hammes-Schiffer S, Benkovic SJ | title = Relating protein motion to catalysis | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 75 | pages = 519–41 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16756501 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.103004.142800 }}</ref>

==== Involved subunits ====
The substrate is coordinated to the zinc and this enzyme has two zinc atoms per subunit. One is the active site, which is involved in catalysis. In the active site, the ligands are Cys-46, Cys-174, His-67, and one water molecule. The other subunit is involved with structure. In this mechanism, the hydride from the alcohol goes to NAD<sup>+</sup>. Crystal structures indicate that the His-51 deprotonates the nicotinamide ribose, which deprotonates Ser-48. Finally, Ser-48 deprotonates the alcohol, making it an aldehyde.<ref name="Hammes" /> From a mechanistic perspective, if the enzyme adds hydride to the [[re face]] of NAD<sup>+</sup>, the resulting hydrogen is incorporated into the pro-R position. Enzymes that add hydride to the re face are deemed Class A dehydrogenases.

== Active site ==
[[Image:active site3.jpg|thumb|The active site of alcohol dehydrogenase]]
The active site of human ADH1 (PDB:1HSO) consists of a zinc atom, His-67, Cys-174, Cys-46, Thr-48, His-51, Ile-269, Val-292, Ala-317, and Phe-319. In the commonly studied horse liver isoform, Thr-48 is a Ser, and Leu-319 is a Phe. The zinc coordinates the substrate (alcohol). The zinc is coordinated by Cys-46, Cys-174, and His-67. Leu-319, Ala-317, His-51, Ile-269 and Val-292 stabilize NAD<sup>+</sup> by forming [[hydrogen bonds]]. His-51 and Ile-269 form hydrogen bonds with the alcohols on nicotinamide ribose. Phe-319, Ala-317 and Val-292 form hydrogen bonds with the amide on NAD<sup>+</sup>.<ref name="Hammes" />

The structures of the catalytic and structural zinc sites in horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) as revealed in crystallographic structures, which has been studied computationally with quantum chemical as well as with classical molecular dynamics methods. The structural zinc site is composed of four closely spaced cysteine ligands (Cys97, Cys100, Cys103, and Cys111 in the amino acid sequence) positioned in an almost symmetric tetrahedron around the Zn ion. A recent study showed that the interaction between zinc and cysteine is governed by primarily an electrostatic contribution with an additional covalent contribution to the binding.<ref name="pmid19177216">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brandt EG, Hellgren M, Brinck T, Bergman T, Edholm O | title = Molecular dynamics study of zinc binding to cysteines in a peptide mimic of the alcohol dehydrogenase structural zinc site | journal = Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 975–83 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19177216 | doi = 10.1039/b815482a | url = https://zenodo.org/record/996012 | bibcode = 2009PCCP...11..975B }}</ref>

== Types ==

=== Human ===
In humans, ADH exists in multiple forms as a dimer and is encoded by at least seven different genes. There are five classes (I-V) of alcohol dehydrogenase, but the [[hepatic]] forms that are used primarily in humans are class 1.

Alcohol dehydrogenase activity varies between men and women, between young and old, and among populations from different areas of the world.

The purpose of this latter step is the regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup>, so that the energy-generating glycolysis can continue. Humans exploit this process to produce alcoholic beverages, by letting yeast ferment various fruits or grains. Yeast can produce and consume their own alcohol.

The main alcohol dehydrogenase in yeast is larger than the human one, consisting of four rather than just two subunits. It also contains zinc at its catalytic site. Together with the zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases of animals and humans, these enzymes from yeasts and many bacteria form the family of "long-chain"-alcohol dehydrogenases.

[[Brewer's yeast]] also has another alcohol dehydrogenase, [[ADH2]], which evolved out of a duplicate version of the chromosome containing the [https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/adh1 ADH1] gene. [https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/adh2 ADH2] is used by the yeast to convert ethanol back into acetaldehyde, and it is expressed only when sugar concentration is low. Having these two enzymes allows yeast to produce alcohol when sugar is plentiful (and this alcohol then kills off competing microbes), and then continue with the oxidation of the alcohol once the sugar, and competition, is gone.<ref name="urlFestive special: The brewers tale - life - 23 December 2006 - New Scientist">{{cite magazine | url = https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/mg19225831.100-festive-special-the-brewers-tale.html | title = Festive special: The brewer's tale - life | vauthors = Coghlan A | date = 23 December 2006 | magazine = New Scientist | access-date = 2009-04-27| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915051831/http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/mg19225831.100-festive-special-the-brewers-tale.html| archive-date=15 September 2008| url-status= live}}</ref>

===Plants===
In plants, ADH catalyses the same reaction as in yeast and bacteria to ensure that there is a constant supply of NAD<sup>+</sup>. [[Maize]] has two versions of ADH - ADH1 and ADH2, ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' contains only one ADH gene. The structure of ''Arabidopsis'' ADH is 47%-conserved, relative to ADH from horse liver.  Structurally and functionally important residues, such as the seven residues that provide ligands for the catalytic and noncatalytic zinc atoms, however, are conserved, suggesting that the enzymes have a similar structure.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang C, Meyerowitz EM | title = Molecular cloning and DNA sequence of the Arabidopsis thaliana alcohol dehydrogenase gene | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 1408–12 | date = March 1986 | pmid = 2937058 | pmc = 323085 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.83.5.1408 | bibcode = 1986PNAS...83.1408C }}</ref> ADH is constitutively expressed at low levels in the roots of young plants grown on agar.

=== Other types ===
A further class of alcohol dehydrogenases belongs to quinoenzymes and requires quinoid cofactors (e.g., pyrroloquinoline quinone, PQQ) as enzyme-bound electron acceptors. A typical example for this type of enzyme is methanol dehydrogenase of methylotrophic bacteria.

== Applications ==

In biotransformation, alcohol dehydrogenases are often used for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure stereoisomers of chiral alcohols. Often, high chemo- and enantioselectivity can be achieved. One example is the alcohol dehydrogenase from ''[[Lactobacillus brevis]]'' (''Lb''ADH), which is described to be a versatile biocatalyst.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Leuchs S, Greiner L |title=Alcohol dehydrogenase from ''Lactobacillus brevis'': A versatile catalyst for enenatioselective reduction |journal=CABEQ |pages=267–281 |year=2011 |url=http://www.hdki.hr/cabeq/pdf/25_2_2011/Cabeq_2011_02_13.pdf }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The high chemospecificity has been confirmed also in the case of substrates presenting two potential redox sites. For instance [[cinnamaldehyde]] presents both aliphatic double bond and aldehyde function. Unlike conventional catalysts, alcohol dehydrogenases are able to selectively act only on the latter, yielding exclusively [[cinnamyl alcohol]].<ref name="pmid19420690">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zucca P, Littarru M, Rescigno A, Sanjust E | title = Cofactor recycling for selective enzymatic biotransformation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol | journal = Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry | volume = 73 | issue = 5 | pages = 1224–6 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19420690 | doi = 10.1271/bbb.90025 | s2cid = 28741979 }}</ref>

In fuel cells, alcohol dehydrogenases can be used to catalyze the breakdown of fuel for an ethanol [[fuel cell]]. Scientists at [[Saint Louis University]] have used carbon-supported alcohol dehydrogenase with poly([[methylene green]]) as an anode, with a [[nafion]] membrane, to achieve about 50&nbsp;μ[[ampere|A]]/cm<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="pmid15672138">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore CM, Minteer SD, Martin RS | title = Microchip-based ethanol/oxygen biofuel cell | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 218–25 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15672138 | doi = 10.1039/b412719f }}</ref>

In 1949, [[Efraim Racker|E. Racker]] defined one unit of alcohol dehydrogenase activity as the amount that causes a change in [[optical density]] of 0.001 per minute under the standard conditions of [[assay]].<ref name="pmid15443900">{{cite journal | vauthors = Racker E | title = Crystalline alcohol dehydrogenase from baker's yeast | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 184 | issue = 1 | pages = 313–9 | date = May 1950 | pmid = 15443900 }}</ref> Recently, the international definition of enzymatic unit (E.U.) has been more common: one unit of Alcohol Dehydrogenase will convert 1.0 μmole of [[ethanol]] to [[acetaldehyde]] per minute at pH 8.8 at 25&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite web | title = Enzymatic Assay of Alcohol Dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) | url = http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/protocols/biology/enzymatic-assay-of-alcohol-dehydrogenase.html | publisher = Sigma Aldrich | access-date = 13 July 2015 }}</ref>

== Clinical significance ==

=== Alcoholism ===

There have been studies showing that variations in ADH that influence [[ethanol metabolism]] have an impact on the risk of alcohol dependence.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sanchez-Roige|first1=Sandra|last2=Palmer|first2=Abraham A.|last3=Fontanillas|first3=Pierre|last4=Elson|first4=Sarah L.|last5=Adams|first5=Mark J.|last6=Howard|first6=David M.|last7=Edenberg|first7=Howard J.|last8=Davies|first8=Gail|last9=Crist|first9=Richard C.|last10=Deary|first10=Ian J.|last11=McIntosh|first11=Andrew M.|date=2019-02-01|title=Genome-wide association study meta-analysis of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) in two population-based cohorts|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=176|issue=2|pages=107–118|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18040369|issn=0002-953X|pmc=6365681|pmid=30336701}}</ref> The strongest effect is due to variations in ADH1B that increase the rate at which alcohol is converted to acetaldehyde. One such variant is most common in individuals from East Asia and the Middle East, another is most common in individuals from Africa.<ref name=":1" /> Both variants reduce the risk for alcoholism, but individuals can become alcoholic despite that. Researchers have tentatively detected a few other genes to be associated with [[alcoholism]], and know that there must be many more remaining to be found.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kranzler|first1=Henry R.|last2=Zhou|first2=Hang|last3=Kember|first3=Rachel L.|last4=Vickers Smith|first4=Rachel|last5=Justice|first5=Amy C.|last6=Damrauer|first6=Scott|last7=Tsao|first7=Philip S.|last8=Klarin|first8=Derek|last9=Baras|first9=Aris|last10=Reid|first10=Jeffrey|last11=Overton|first11=John|date=2019-04-02|title=Genome-wide association study of alcohol consumption and use disorder in 274,424 individuals from multiple populations|journal=Nature Communications|volume=10|issue=1|pages=1499|doi=10.1038/s41467-019-09480-8|issn=2041-1723|pmc=6445072|pmid=30940813|bibcode=2019NatCo..10.1499K}}</ref> Research continues in order to identify the genes and their influence on alcoholism.

=== Drug dependence ===

Drug dependence is another problem associated with ADH, which researchers think might be linked to alcoholism. One particular study suggests that drug dependence has seven ADH genes associated with it, however, more research is necessary.<ref name="pmid17185388">{{cite journal | vauthors = Luo X, Kranzler HR, Zuo L, Wang S, Schork NJ, Gelernter J | title = Multiple ADH genes modulate risk for drug dependence in both African- and European-Americans | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 380–90 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17185388 | pmc = 1853246 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl460 }}</ref> Alcohol dependence and other drug dependence may share some risk factors, but because alcohol dependence is often comorbid with other drug dependences, the association of ADH with the other drug dependencies may not be causal.

=== Poisoning ===

[[Fomepizole]], a drug that [[competitive inhibition|competitively inhibits]] alcohol dehydrogenase, can be used in the setting of acute [[methanol]]<ref>International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS): Methanol (PIM 335), [http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/chemical/pim335.htm#10.%20MANAGEMENT], retrieved on 1 March 2008</ref> or [[ethylene glycol]]<ref name="pmid18072148">{{cite journal | vauthors = Velez LI, Shepherd G, Lee YC, Keyes DC | title = Ethylene glycol ingestion treated only with fomepizole | journal = Journal of Medical Toxicology | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–8 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 18072148 | pmc = 3550067 | doi = 10.1007/BF03160922 }}</ref> toxicity. This prevents the conversion of the methanol or ethylene glycol to its toxic metabolites (such as [[formic acid]], [[formaldehyde]], or [[glycolic acid|glycolate]]). The same effect is also sometimes achieved with [[ethanol]], again by competitive inhibition of ADH.

=== Drug metabolism ===
The drug [[hydroxyzine]] is broken into it's active metabolite [[Cetirizine|certizine]] by alcohol dehydrogenase. Other drugs with alcohol groups may be metabolized in a similar way as long as steric hinderance does not prevent the alcohol from reaching the active site.<ref>{{cite book| vauthors = Nelson W | chapter = Chapter 36: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs | veditors = Foye WO, Lemke TL, Williams DA |title=Foye's Principles of Medicinal Chemistry | edition = 7th |year= 2013 |isbn=978-1-60913-345-0 | location = Philadelphia | publisher = Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins }}</ref>
