==Definition==
A health risk assessment (HRA) is a health questionnaire, used to provide individuals with an evaluation of their health risks and quality of life.<ref name=" Using online health risk">Baker K, DeJoy D, and Wilson M. Using online health risk assessments, The Journal of Employee Assistance. April 2007.</ref> Commonly a HRA incorporates three key elements{{spaced ndash}}an extended questionnaire, a risk calculation or score, and some form of feedback i.e. face-to-face with a health advisor or an automatic online report.<ref name="Health Risk Appraisal" /><ref name="Using online health risk"/>

[[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] define a HRA as: "a systematic approach to collecting information from individuals that identifies risk factors, provides individualised feedback, and links the person with at least one intervention to promote health, sustain function and/or prevent disease".<ref name="CDC Health risk appraisals">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/hwi/program_design/health_risk_appraisals.htm|title=Redirect Page|website=www.cdc.gov}}</ref>

There is a range of different HRAs available for adults and children. Some target specific populations. For example, in the US, Medicare HRAs ask seniors about their ability to perform daily activities. Medicaid assessments ask questions about health-care access, availability of food, and living conditions. Most HRAs capture information relating to:<ref name="Health Risk Appraisal" /><ref name="CDC Health risk appraisals"/><ref name="Chapter 15">Warshaw, L.

In the US, HRAs used as part of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit help identify issues important to a senior's health and well-being. HRAs used as part of Medicaid enrollment help identify individuals with health problems that need immediate attention.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services|title=Preventive visit & yearly wellness exams.|url=http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services|title=Core Set of Children's Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid and CHIP (Child Core Set)|url=http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Quality-of-Care/Downloads/Medicaid-and-CHIP-Child-Core-Set-Manual.pdf|access-date=13 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208032330/http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Quality-of-Care/Downloads/Medicaid-and-CHIP-Child-Core-Set-Manual.pdf|archive-date=8 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) recommends the use of HRAs in workplace settings when used in combination with health education,<ref name=":0" /> having found there is strong or satisfactory evidence that they help improve the following behaviors among employees:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Soler|first=Robin|last2=et al; the Task Force on Community Preventive Services|date=2010|title=A Systematic Review of Selected Interventions for Worksite Health Promotion: The Assessment of Health Risks with Feedback|url=https://www.thecommunityguide.org/sites/default/files/publications/worksite-ajpm-evrev-ahrf.pdf|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=38(2S)|pages=S237–S262|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}</ref>

==History==
The original concept of the HRA can be traced back to the decision by the assistant Surgeon General of the United States to conduct a study to determine probable 10-year lifespan of individuals based on lifestyles and predisposed conditions.  The project, led by Lewis C. Robbins, MD,<ref name="Appraising health risk appraisals">{{Cite journal|author=Schoenbach VJ |title=Appraising health risk appraisal |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=409–11 |date=April 1987 |pmid=3826457 |pmc=1646957 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.77.4.409}}</ref> of the Public Health Service, was the Framingham study.  The study was based on in-depth longitudinal studies of 5,000 families in Framingham, Massachusetts, that continues to this day under funding from the National Institutes of Health.
Dr. Robbins left the Public Health Service and joined Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis where, working with Jack Hall, MD, he developed the first set of health hazard tables. This culminated in the publication of How to Practice Prospective Medicine in 1970 – a guide for practising physicians, which outlined the health risk assessment questionnaire, risk computations and patient feedback strategies.<ref name="Chapter 15"/><ref name="Appraising health risk appraisals"/> During the 1960s, some researchers in California formed the [https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/109718 Human Population Laboratory] (HPL) to investigate factors contributing to quality of life.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Housman|first=Jeff|last2=Dorman|first2=Steve|date=2005|title=The Alameda County Study: a Systematic, Chronological Review|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ792845.pdf|journal=The American Journal of Health Education|volume=36|issue=5|pages=302–308|via=ERIC|doi=10.1080/19325037.2005.10608200}}</ref> Inspired by a research article<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Belloc|first=Nedra|last2=Breslow|first2=Lester|date=August 1972|title=Relationship of physical health status and health practices|journal=Preventive Medicine|volume=1|issue=3|pages=409–421|doi=10.1016/0091-7435(72)90014-X|pmid=5085007}}</ref> reporting on the HPL's [[Alameda County Study]] on the best lifestyle practices for good health, [https://www.wellsource.com/don-hall/ Don R.

Within a year, he had programmed 12 health assessments on single topics such as nutrition, fitness, weight, and stress.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wellsource.com/don-hall/|title=Don-Hall|website=Wellsource}}</ref> In 1979, when personal desktop computers became readily available, he packaged all 12 assessments together on a floppy disk and marketed it as a comprehensive health risk assessment. It wasn't until 1980, when the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] released a publicly available version, that the HRA became widely used, particularly in workplace settings.<ref name="Using online health risk"/>
Health & Welfare Canada reviewed How to Practice Prospective Medicine and created a mainframe version of the book.  The Centers for Disease Control became aware of this product and adapted it to the newly available personal computer.  When Prudential Life Insurance also took an interest and asked to fund an update of the program, the CDC, which could not accept private project funding at the time, transferred ownership to the Carter Center at Emory University where it was updated from 1986–7.  The transfer and subsequent program were managed by Dr. Ed Hutchins who had worked on the HRA in positions at the University of Pennsylvania and Charlotte-Mecklenberg Hospital.  At Charlotte Mecklenberg, he secured a contract with the World Health Organization to create a mainframe product that could be used on an international basis.
The HRA was managed as a not-for-profit product.  Copies were distributed to every state health department and liaisons were assigned to each to work with their staffs to evaluate related data.  Over 2,000 copies of the software were distributed to users who requested it and approximately 70 copies of the code were provided to for-profit companies that were interested in developing proprietary products.  This proliferation coincided with the rapid growth in interest in corporate health promotion programs as awareness developed on health risks and for-profit vendors monetized the programs.
The Carter Center's interest shifted to Africa and Dr. Hutchins founded the Healthier People Network (HPN) which in 1991 to continue the work.  HPN raised funds to support the HRA but additional funding was not forthcoming from government sources.  As a result, the Carter Center and HPN could not underwrite basic supporting activities such as annual conferences and, over time, the State-based liaison network and associated intellectual capital atrophied as programs lost funding and liaisons moved on.
The use of HRAs and corporate wellness programs has been most prevalent in the United States, with comparatively slower growth elsewhere.<ref name="Chapter 15"/><ref name="The development">{{Cite journal|author=Mills PR |title=The development of a new corporate specific health risk measurement instrument, and its use in investigating the relationship between health and well-being and employee productivity |journal=Environmental Health |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1 |year=2005 |pmid=15679885 |pmc=548523 |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-4-1}}</ref> However, there has been recent strong growth in corporate wellness outside the US, particularly in Europe and Asia.<ref name="Working well">{{Cite book |date=October 2008 |url=http://www.buckconsultants.co.uk/BuckConsultantsUK/Portals/0/Documents/Publications/SURVEYS/Global%20Wellness%202008%20Survey%20Report%20UK.pdf |publisher=Buck Consultants |title=Working well: A global survey of health promotion and workplace wellness strategies |access-date=28 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816055348/http://www.buckconsultants.co.uk/BuckConsultantsUK/Portals/0/Documents/Publications/SURVEYS/Global%20Wellness%202008%20Survey%20Report%20UK.pdf |archive-date=16 August 2009 |url-status=dead  }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

==Usage==
Once an individual completes a HRA, they usually receive a report, detailing their health rating or score, often broken down into specific sub scores and areas such as stress, nutrition and fitness.<ref name="Health Risk Appraisal" /> The report can also provide recommendations on how individuals can reduce their health risks by changing their lifestyle.<ref name="Appraising health risk appraisals"/>

In addition to individual feedback, HRAs are also used to provide aggregated [[data reporting]] for employers and organizations.<ref name="Chapter 15"/><ref name="The development"/> These reports include demographic data of participants, highlight health risk areas and often include cost projections and savings in terms of increased healthcare, absence and productivity.<ref name="Chapter 15"/> Organization-level reports can then be used to provide a first step by which organizations can target and monitor appropriate health interventions within their workforce.<ref name="The development"/>

==HRA delivery==
The delivery of HRAs has changed over the years in conjunction with advances in technology. Initially distributed as paper-based, self-scoring questionnaires through on-site workplace health promotion sessions, HRAs are now most commonly implemented online.<ref name="Using online health risk"/> Other delivery methods include telephone, mail and face-to-face.<ref name="Using online health risk"/><ref name="CDC Health risk appraisals"/>

The advantages of online HRAs include:<ref name="Using online health risk"/>
* Tailoring – online HRAs can adapt content based on an individual's answers to the HRA questionnaire to provide a personalised, relevant and interactive user experience.
* Improved data management
* Reduced administrative costs
* Instant feedback

==Efficacy==
Extensive research has shown that HRAs can be used effectively to:

However, it is generally accepted that HRAs are most effective at promoting behavior change when they form part of an integrated, multi-component health promotion program.<ref name="Health Risk Appraisal" /><ref name="Chapter 15"/><ref name="The impact of worksite-based health risk appraisal">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Anderson DR, Staufacker MJ |title=The impact of worksite-based health risk appraisal on health-related outcomes: a review of the literature |journal=American Journal of Health Promotion |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=499–508 |year=1996 |pmid=10163313 |doi=10.4278/0890-1171-10.6.499}}</ref> Applied in this way, the HRA is used primarily as a tool to identify health risks within a population and then target health interventions and behavior change programs to address these areas.<ref name="Using online health risk"/>

==Limitations==
The limitations of a HRA are largely related to its usage and it is important to recognise that a HRA highlights health risks but does not diagnose disease and should not replace consultation with a medical or health practitioner.<ref name="Health Risk Appraisal" />

==Providers==
There are reportedly over 50 different HRA providers in the market, offering a variety of versions and formats.<ref name="Health Risk Appraisal" /> Major vendors generally have National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Wellness and Health Promotion (WHP) Certification<ref>{{cite web|last1=National Committee for Quality Assurance|title=Wellness & Health Promotion Report Card|url=http://reportcard.ncqa.org/WHP/External/WHPRatings.aspx?OrgName=pdhi}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> or Health Information Products (HIP) Certification.
