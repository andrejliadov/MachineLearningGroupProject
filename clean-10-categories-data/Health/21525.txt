'''Nutrition''' is the [[science]] that interprets the [[nutrients]] and other substances in [[food]] in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, [[health]] and disease of an organism. It includes ingestion, [[Absorption (biology)|absorption]], [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilation]], [[biosynthesis]], [[catabolism]] and [[excretion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/cd_hum.nut.html#2|title=Joint Collection Development Policy: Human Nutrition and Food|publisher=US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health|date=14 October 2014|accessdate=13 December 2014}}</ref>

The [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] of an organism is what it eats, which is largely determined by the availability and [[palatability]] of foods. For humans, a [[healthy diet]] includes [[Food preparation|preparation of food]] and storage methods that preserve nutrients from oxidation, heat or leaching, and that reduces risk of [[foodborne illness]]es. The seven major classes of human nutrients are [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s, [[dietary fiber|fiber]], [[dietary minerals|minerals]], [[protein]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[water]]. Nutrients can be grouped as either [[macronutrients]] or [[micronutrients]] (needed in small quantities).

In humans, an unhealthy diet can cause deficiency-related diseases such as [[blindness]], [[anemia]], [[scurvy]], [[preterm birth]], [[stillbirth]] and [[cretinism]],<ref name=Whitney-Rolfes-lead>{{cite book|title=Understanding Nutrition|author1=Whitney, Ellie  |author2=Rolfes, Sharon Rady|isbn=978-1-133-58752-1|year=2013|edition=13|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|pages=667, 670}}</ref> or nutrient excess health-threatening conditions such as [[obesity]]<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes/prostate/weightgain0307 Obesity, Weight Linked to Prostate Cancer Deaths – National Cancer Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607220946/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes/prostate/weightgain0307 |date=7 June 2011 }}.

==Animal nutrition==
{{main|Animal nutrition|Human nutrition}}

[[Carnivore]] and [[herbivore]] diets are contrasting, with basic [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]] proportions vary for their particular foods. Many herbivores rely on bacterial fermentation to create digestible nutrients from indigestible plant cellulose, while obligate carnivores must eat animal meats to obtain certain vitamins or nutrients their bodies cannot otherwise synthesize. Animals generally have a higher requirement of energy in comparison to plants.<ref>{{cite web|last1=National Geographic Society|title=Herbivore|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/herbivore/|website=National Geographic Society|accessdate=1 May 2017|language=en|date=21 January 2011}}</ref>

==Plant nutrition==

{{Main|Plant nutrition}}
Plant nutrition is the study of the [[chemical element]]s that are necessary for plant growth.<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Plant Nutrition|author1=Allen V. Barker |author2=David J. Pilbeam | page=Preface| publisher=CRC Press, 2010}}</ref> There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition. Some elements are directly involved in plant [[metabolism]]. However, this principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.

A nutrient that is able to limit plant growth according to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]] is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it. There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients, besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in air, and [[hydrogen]], which is obtained from water.

Plants uptake essential elements from the [[soil]] through their [[root]]s and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their [[Leaf|leaves]]. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by [[cation exchange]], wherein [[root hair]]s pump [[hydrogen ion]]s (H<sup>+</sup>) into the soil through [[proton pump]]s. These hydrogen ions displace [[cation]]s attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, [[stomata]] open to take in carbon dioxide and expel [[oxygen]]. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.

Although [[nitrogen]] is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, very few plants can use this directly. Most plants, therefore, require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow. This is made possible by the fact that largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a [[nitrogen fixation]] process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria.<ref>Lindemann, W.C. and Glover C.R. (2003) [http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_a/A129/welcome.html Nitrogen Fixation by Legumes]. New Mexico State University/</ref>

[[Plant nutrition]] is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given [[cloning|clone]]. Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element, and vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}
