'''Public health''' has been defined as "the science and art of [[Preventive healthcare|preventing disease]]”, prolonging life and improving [[quality of life]] through organized efforts and informed choices of [[society]], [[Organization|organizations]] (public and private), [[Community|communities]] and [[Individual|individuals]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory|title=The Untilled Field of Public Health |journal=Modern Medicine |date=1920 |volume=2 |issue=1306 |pages=183–191 |author-link=Charles-Edward Amory Winslow |bibcode=1920Sci....51...23W |doi=10.1126/science.51.1306.23 |pmid=17838891 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448241 }}</ref> Analyzing the determinants of [[health]] of a [[population]] and the threats it faces is the basis for public health.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdcfoundation.org/content/what-public-health|title=What is Public Health|website=Centers for Disease Control Foundation|publisher=Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control|access-date=27 January 2017}}</ref> The ''public'' can be as small as a handful of people or as large as a village or an entire city; in the case of a [[pandemic]] it may encompass several continents. The concept of ''health'' takes into account physical, [[psychological]], and [[Well-being|social well-being]]. As such, according to the [[World Health Organization]], it is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity and more recently, a resource for everyday living.<ref>[https://www.who.int/suggestions/faq/en/ Frequently asked questions] from the "Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization" as adopted by the [[International Health Conference]], 1946</ref>

Public health is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field. For example, [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]], [[Social science|social sciences]] and [[management]] of [[health services]] are all relevant. Other important sub-fields include [[environmental health]], [[community health]], [[behavioral health]], [[health economics]], [[public policy]], [[mental health]], [[health education]], [[health politics]], [[occupational safety and health|occupational safety]], [[disability]], [[gender issues]] in health, and [[sexual and reproductive health]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=PERDIGUERO|first=E.|date=2001-07-01|title=Anthropology in public health.

Public health aims to improve the quality of life through prevention and treatment of [[disease]], including mental health. This is done through the [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] of cases and [[health indicators]], and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promotion of [[hand washing|hand-washing]] and [[breastfeeding]], delivery of [[vaccination]]s, [[suicide prevention]], [[smoking cessation]], [[Obesity|obesity education]], increasing [[Health care|healthcare]] accessibility and distribution of [[condom]]s to control the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.

Modern public health practice requires [[Interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] teams of public health workers and professionals. Teams might include [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]], [[biostatistics|biostatisticians]], [[physician assistant]]s, [[public health nursing|public health nurses]], [[midwives]], [[microbiologist|medical microbiologists]], [[pharmacist]]s, [[economists]], [[sociologists]], [[geneticists]], [[data management|data managers]], [[environmental health officer]]s ([[public health inspector]]s), [[Bioethics|bioethicists]], gender experts, sexual and reproductive health specialists, [[physicians]], and even [[veterinarian]]s.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Joint Task Group on Public Health Human Resources |author2=Advisory Committee on Health Delivery & Human Resources |author3=Advisory Committee on Population Health & Health Security |publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada |title=Building the public health workforce for the 21st century |location=Ottawa |year=2005 |oclc=144167975}}</ref>

Like in other nations, access to [[health care]] and public health initiatives are difficult challenges in [[developing nations|developing countries]]. Public health infrastructures are still forming in those countries.

==Background==
[[File:Community Health Workers (5762479865).jpg|thumb|Community health workers]]

The focus of a [[public health intervention]] is to prevent and [[Mitigation|mitigate]] diseases, [[Injury|injuries]] and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the [[health promotion|promotion of healthy behaviors]], [[healthy community design|communities]] and [[environmental protection|environments]]. Many diseases are [[Preventable causes of death|preventable]] through simple, nonmedical methods. For example, research has shown that the simple act of [[hand washing|handwashing]] with soap can prevent the spread of many [[Infection|contagious diseases]].<ref>Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. [http://www.globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources ''Handwashing research''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216125536/http://globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources |date=16 December 2010 }}, accessed 19 April 2011.</ref> In other cases, treating a disease or controlling a [[pathogen]] can be vital to preventing its spread to others, either during an outbreak of [[infectious disease]] or through [[food contamination|contamination of food]] or [[water contamination|water]] supplies. [[Behavior change (public health)|Public health communications programs]], [[vaccination]] programs and distribution of [[condom]]s are examples of common preventive public health measures. Measures such as these have contributed greatly to the health of populations and increases in [[life expectancy]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Sanjiv|last2=Preetha|first2=Gs|date=2012|title=Health promotion: An effective tool for global health|journal=Indian Journal of Community Medicine|language=en|volume=37|issue=1|pages=5–12|doi=10.4103/0970-0218.94009|issn=0970-0218|pmc=3326808|pmid=22529532}}</ref>

Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in both the developing world and in developed countries through local health systems and [[non-governmental organization]]s. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is the international agency that coordinates and acts on [[global health|global public health]] issues. Most countries have their own governmental public health agency, often called the ministry of health, with responsibility for domestic health issues.

In the [[United States]], state and local [[health department]]s are on the front line of public health initiatives. In addition to their national duties, the [[United States Public Health Service]] (PHS), led by the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], headquartered in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], are also involved with international health activities.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Alkhuli|first=Dr Muhammad Ali|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYZPDwAAQBAJ&q=In+the+United+States,+state+and+local+health+departments+are+on+the+front+line+of+public+health+initiatives.+In+addition+to+their+national+duties,+the+United+States+Public+Health+Service+(PHS),+led+by+the+Surgeon+General+of+the+United+States,+and+the+Centers+for+Disease+Control+and+Prevention,+headquartered+in+Atlanta,+are+also+involved+with+international+health+activities.&pg=PA242|title=English for Nursing and Medicine|publisher=دار الفلاح للنشر والتوزيع‎|isbn=978-9957-552-36-7|language=en}}</ref>

In Canada, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] is the national agency responsible for public health, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and [[chronic disease]] control and prevention. The [[Public health system in India]] is managed by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of the government of India with state-owned health care facilities.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Canada : International Health Care System Profiles|url=https://international.commonwealthfund.org/countries/canada/|website=international.commonwealthfund.org|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref>

Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of [[aging]] and other physical and mental health conditions. However, public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine.<ref>{{cite report|publisher =World Health Organization |chapter = Public health principles and neurological disorders|title =Neurological Disorders: Public Health Challenges |location = Geneva|date= 2006 |chapter-url =https://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/neurodiso/en/index.html}}</ref> Although the collaboration of local health and government agencies is considered best practice to improve public health, the pieces of evidence available to support this is limited.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Hayes SL, Mann MK, Morgan FM, Kelly MJ, Weightman AL. |title=Collaboration between local health and local government agencies for health improvement |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=17 October 2012 |volume=10 |issue=10 |pages=CD007825 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007825.pub6 |pmid=23076937}}</ref> Public health programs providing [[vaccination]]s have made progress in promoting health, including the eradication of [[smallpox]], a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years.

The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies core functions of public [[health]] programs including:<ref>World Health Organization. [https://www.who.int/about/role/en/ ''The role of WHO in public health''], accessed 19 April 2011.</ref>
* providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed;
* shaping a [[research]] agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and [[dissemination]] of valuable knowledge;
* setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and [[evidence-based policy]] options;
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.

In particular, public health surveillance programs can:<ref>World Health Organization. [https://www.who.int/topics/public_health_surveillance/en/ ''Public health surveillance''], accessed 19 April 2011.</ref>
* serve as an [[early warning system]] for impending public health emergencies;
* document the impact of an intervention, or track progress towards specified goals; and
* monitor and clarify the epidemiology of health problems, allow priorities to be set, and inform [[public health policy|health policy]] and strategies.
* diagnose, investigate, and monitor health problems and health hazards of the community

Public health surveillance has led to the identification and prioritization of many public health issues facing the world today, including [[HIV/AIDS]], [[diabetes]], [[waterborne diseases]], [[zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]], and [[antibiotic resistance]] leading to the reemergence of [[infectious diseases]] such as [[tuberculosis]]. [[Antibiotic resistance]], also known as drug resistance, was the theme of [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2011]]. Although the prioritization of pressing public health issues is important, Laurie Garrett argues that there are following consequences.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Garrett Laurie | year = 2007 | title = The Challenge of Global Health | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 86 | issue = 1| pages = 14–38 }}</ref> When foreign aid is funneled into disease-specific programs, the importance of public health in general is disregarded. This public health problem of [[stovepiping|stove piping]] is thought to create a lack of funds to combat other existing diseases in a given country.

For example, the WHO reports that at least 220 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is projected that the number of diabetes deaths will double by the year 2030.<ref>World Health Organization. [https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/ ''Diabetes Fact Sheet N°312'', January 2011]. Accessed 19 April 2011.</ref> In a June 2010 editorial in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', the authors opined that "The fact that [[type 2 diabetes]], a largely preventable disorder, has reached epidemic proportion is a public health humiliation."<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = The Lancet| title = Type 2 diabetes—time to change our approach | journal = The Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9733 | pages = 2193 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20609952 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61011-2 | s2cid = 31166680 }}</ref> The risk of type 2 diabetes is closely linked with the growing problem of [[obesity]]. The WHO's latest estimates as of June 2016 highlighted that globally approximately 1.9 billion adults were [[overweight]] in 2014, and 41 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2014.<ref>World Health Organization. [https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/ ''Obesity and overweight Fact sheet N°311'', Updated June 2016.] Accessed 19 April 2011.</ref> The United States is the leading country with 30.6% of its population being obese. Mexico follows behind with 24.2% and the United Kingdom with 23%. Once considered a problem in high-income countries, it is now on the rise in low-income countries, especially in urban settings. Many public health programs are increasingly dedicating attention and resources to the issue of obesity, with objectives to address the underlying causes including [[healthy diet]] and [[physical exercise]].

Some programs and policies associated with public [[health promotion]] and prevention can be controversial. One such example is programs focusing on the prevention of [[HIV]] transmission through [[safe sex]] campaigns and [[needle-exchange programme|needle-exchange program]]s. Another is the control of [[tobacco smoking]]. Changing smoking behavior requires long-term strategies, unlike the fight against [[communicable diseases]], which usually takes a shorter period for effects to be observed. Many nations have implemented [[tobacco smoking#Public policy|major initiatives]] to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places. Supporters argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers, and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate, both through limiting [[Passive smoking|passive (second-hand) smoking]] and by providing fewer opportunities for people to smoke. Opponents say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility, and worry that the state may be encouraged to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall.

Simultaneously, while communicable diseases have historically ranged uppermost as a [[global health]] priority, [[non-communicable disease]]s and the underlying behavior-related risk factors have been at the bottom. This is changing, however, as illustrated by the [[United Nations]] hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases in September 2011.<ref>United Nations. [https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs//2010/100513_Diseases.doc.htm ''Press Conference on General Assembly Decision to Convene Summit in September 2011 on Non-Communicable Diseases''.] New York, 13 May 2010.</ref>

Many health problems are due to maladaptive personal behaviors. From an [[evolutionary psychology]] perspective, over consumption of novel substances that are harmful is due to the activation of an evolved [[reward system]] for substances such as drugs, tobacco, [[alcohol]], [[Salt|refined salt]], [[fat]], and [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]]. New technologies such as modern transportation also cause reduced [[physical activity]]. Research has found that behavior is more effectively changed by taking evolutionary motivations into consideration instead of only presenting information about health effects. The marketing industry has long known the importance of associating products with high status and attractiveness to others. Films are increasingly being recognized as a public health tool.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In fact, [[Public Health Film Festival|film festivals]] and [[International Public Health Film Competition|competitions]] have been established to specifically promote films about health.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1757913915619120|pmid=26702114|title=Reflections on the United Kingdom's first public health film festival|journal=Perspectives in Public Health|volume=136|issue=1|pages=23–24|year=2016|last1=Botchway|first1=Stella|last2=Hoang|first2=Uy|s2cid=21969020}}</ref> Conversely, it has been argued that emphasizing the harmful and undesirable effects of tobacco smoking on other persons and imposing smoking bans in public places have been particularly effective in reducing tobacco smoking.<ref>Valerie Curtis and Robert Aunger.

===Applications in health care===
As well as seeking to improve population health through the implementation of specific population-level interventions, public health contributes to medical care by identifying and assessing population needs for health care services, including:<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gillam Stephen|author2=Yates, Jan|author3=Badrinath, Padmanabhan |title=Essential Public Health : theory and practice |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |oclc=144228591}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor=Pencheon, David |author1=Pencheon, David |author2=Guest, Charles |author3=Melzer, David |author4=Gray, JA Muir |title=Oxford Handbook of Public Health Practice |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |oclc=663666786}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Smith, Sarah |author2=Sinclair, Don |author3=Raine, Rosalind |author4=Reeves, Barnarby |title=Health Care Evaluation |series=Understanding Public Health |publisher=Open University Press |year=2005|oclc=228171855}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Sanderson, Colin J. |author2=Gruen, Reinhold |title=Analytical Models for Decision Making |series=Understanding Public Health |publisher=Open University Press |year=2006 |oclc=182531015 }}</ref>
* Assessing current services and evaluating whether they are meeting the objectives of the [[health care system]]
* Ascertaining requirements as expressed by [[health care provider|health professionals]], the public and other stakeholders
* Identifying the most appropriate interventions
* Considering the effect on resources for proposed interventions and assessing their cost-effectiveness
* Supporting decision making in health care and planning health services including any necessary changes.
* Informing, educating, and empowering people about health issues

===Implementing effective improvement strategies===
To improve public health, one important strategy is to promote modern medicine and scientific neutrality to drive the public health policy and campaign, which is recommended by Armanda Solórzano, through a case study of the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s. Soloranza argues that public health policy can't concern only politics or economics. Political concerns can lead government officials to hide the real numbers of people affected by disease in their regions, such as upcoming elections. Therefore, scientific neutrality in making public health policy is critical; it can ensure treatment needs are met regardless of political and economic conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Birn | first1 = A. E. | last2 = Solórzano | first2 = A. | title = Public health policy paradoxes: Science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s | journal = Social Science & Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 9 | pages = 1197–1213 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10501641| doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00160-4 }}</ref>

The history of public health care shows the global effort to improve [[Health For All|health care for all]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} However, in modern-day medicine, real, measurable change has not been clearly seen, and critics argue that this lack of improvement is due to ineffective methods that are being implemented. As argued by Paul E. Farmer, structural interventions could possibly have a large impact, and yet there are numerous problems as to why this strategy has yet to be incorporated into the health system. One of the main reasons that he suggests could be the fact that physicians are not properly trained to carry out structural interventions, meaning that the ground level health care professionals cannot implement these improvements. While structural interventions can not be the only area for improvement, the lack of coordination between socioeconomic factors and health care for the poor could be counterproductive, and end up causing greater inequity between the health care services received by the rich and by the poor. Unless health care is no longer treated as a commodity, global public health will ultimately not be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} This being the case, without changing the way in which health care is delivered to those who have less access to it, the universal goal of public health care cannot be achieved.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Farmer | first1 = P. E. | last2 = Nizeye | first2 = B. | last3 = Stulac | first3 = S. | last4 = Keshavjee | first4 = S. | title = Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine | journal = PLOS Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = e449 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17076568 | pmc = 1621099 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 }}</ref>

Another reason why measurable changes may not be noticed in public health is because agencies themselves may not be measuring their programs' efficacy. Perrault et al.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Perrault|first1=Evan K.|last2=Inderstrodt-Stephens|first2=Jill|last3=Hintz|first3=Elizabeth A.|date=7 December 2017|title=Tracking Success: Outputs Versus Outcomes—A Comparison of Accredited and Non-Accredited Public Health Agencies' Community Health Improvement Plan objectives|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=43|issue=3|pages=570–577|doi=10.1007/s10900-017-0454-0|pmid=29218542|s2cid=1136828|issn=0094-5145}}</ref> analyzed over 4,000 published objectives from Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs) of 280 local accredited and non-accredited public health agencies in the U.S., and found that the majority of objectives – around two-thirds – were focused on achieving agency outputs (e.g., developing communication plans, installing sidewalks, disseminating data to the community). Approximately one-third focused on seeking measurable changes in the populations they serve (i.e., changing people's [[knowledge]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[Behavior|behaviors]]). What this research showcases is that if agencies are only focused on accomplishing tasks (i.e., outputs) and do not have a focus on measuring actual changes in their populations with the activities they perform, it should not be surprising when measurable changes are not reported. Perrault et al.<ref name=":0" /> advocate for public health agencies to work with those in the discipline of [[Health communication|Health Communication]] to craft objectives that are measurable outcomes, and to assist agencies in developing tools and methods to be able to track more proximal changes in their target populations (e.g., knowledge and attitude shifts) that may be influenced by the activities the agencies are performing.

''Public Health 2.0'' is a movement within public health that aims to make the field more accessible to the general public and more user-driven. The term is used in three senses. In the first sense, "Public Health 2.0" is similar to "[[Health 2.0]]" and describes the ways in which traditional public health practitioners and institutions are reaching out (or could reach out) to the public through [[social media]] and [[health blog]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Wilson, Kumanan |author2=Keelan, Jennifer  |date=May 2009 | title = Coping with public health 2.0 | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 180 | issue = 10 | pages = 1080 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.090696 | pmid = 19433834 | pmc = 2679846}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | author = Vance, K. |author2=Howe, W. |author3=Dellavalle, R.P. |date=April 2009 | title = Social internet sites as a source of public health information | journal = Dermatologic Clinics | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–136 | doi = 10.1016/j.det.2008.11.010 | pmid = 19254656}}</ref>

There is a significant disparity in access to health care and public health initiatives between [[Developed country|developed countries]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]], as well as within developing countries.

However, expenditures on health care should not be confused with spending on public health. Public health measures may not generally be considered "health care" in the strictest sense. For example, mandating the use of seat belts in cars can save countless lives and contribute to the health of a population, but typically money spent enforcing this rule would not count as money spent on health care.

Large parts of the world remained plagued by largely preventable or treatable infectious diseases. In addition to this however, many developing countries are also experiencing an [[Epidemiological transition|epidemiological shift]] and [[Social polarization|polarization]] in which populations are now experiencing more of the effects of chronic diseases as life expectancy increases, the poorer communities being heavily affected by both chronic and infectious diseases.<ref name="Jamison 15–22"/> Another major public health concern in the developing world is poor [[Maternal health|maternal]] and child health, exacerbated by [[malnutrition]] and poverty. The [[WHO]] reports that a lack of [[Breastfeeding#Exclusive breastfeeding|exclusive breastfeeding]] during the first six months of life contributes to over a million avoidable child deaths each year.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=World Health Organization |url=https://www.who.int/features/factfiles/breastfeeding/en/index.html |title=10 facts on breastfeeding |access-date=20 April 2011}}</ref> [[Intermittent preventive therapy]] aimed at treating and preventing [[malaria]] episodes among pregnant women and young children is one public health measure in [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] countries.

Since the 1980s, the growing field of [[population health]] has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and [[risk factor]]s to population-level issues such as [[health equity|inequality]], poverty, and education. Modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population. There is a recognition that health is affected by many factors including region of residence, [[genetics]], income, educational status and [[Social relation|social relationships]]; these are known as "[[social determinants of health]]". The upstream drivers such as environment, education, employment, income, food security, housing, [[Social exclusion|social inclusion]] and many others effect the distribution of health between and within populations and are often shaped by policy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7JxutqCmctUC&q=health+policy+interventions+-+the+United+Nations&pg=PP2|title=Equity, Social Determinants and Public Health Programmes|last=Organization|first=World Health|date=2010|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241563970}}</ref> A social gradient in health runs through society.

=== Health aid in developing countries ===
{{Main|Aid}}[[Aid|Health aid]] to developing countries is an important source of public health funding for many developing countries.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Bendavid|first1=Eran|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Jay|year=2014|title=The Relationship of Health Aid to Population Health Improvements |journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=174|issue=6|pages=881–887|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.292 |pmc=4777302|pmid=24756557}}</ref> Health aid to developing countries has shown a significant increase after World War II as concerns over the spread of disease as a result of [[globalization]] increased and the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa surfaced.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Twumasi|first=Patrick|date=1 April 1981|title=Colonialism and international health: A study in social change in Ghana|journal=Social Science & Medicine.

To promote better strategic cooperation and coordination between partners, particularly among bilateral development agencies and funding organizations, the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)]] spearheaded the establishment of ESSENCE,<ref>https://www.who.int/tdr/partnerships/essence/en/</ref> an initiative to facilitate dialogue between donors/funders, allowing them to identify synergies. ESSENCE brings together a wide range of funding agencies to coordinate funding efforts.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how global health security is reliant on all countries around the world, including low- and middle-income countries, having strong health systems and at least a minimum of health research capacities. In an article 2020 in Annals of Global Health,<ref>Kilmarx PH, Maitin T, Adam T, Akuffo H, Aslanyan G, Cheetham M, Corrêa-Oliveira R, Kay S, Khelef N, Kunaratnam Y, Kupfer L, Olesen OF. A Mechanism for Reviewing Investments in Health Research Capacity Strengthening in Low- and Middle-Income Countries. Annals of Global Health. 2020; 86(1): 92, 1–4. DOI: https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.2941</ref> the ESSENCE group outlined a mechanism for review of investment in health research capacity building in low- and middle-income countries. The review mechanism will give funders of research for health the information to identify the gaps in capacity that exist in low- and middle-income countries and the opportunity to work together to address those disparities. The overall goal is increased, coordinated support of research on national health priorities as well as improved pandemic preparedness in LMICs, and, eventually, fewer countries with very limited health research capacity.

In 2009 health aid from the [[OECD]] amounted to $12.47 billion which amounted to 11.4% of its total bilateral aid.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wess/wess_bg_papers/bp_wess2012_schwank.pdf|title=Global Health Initiatives and Aid Effectiveness in the Health Sector|last=Shwank|first=Oliver}}</ref> In 2009, Multilateral donors were found to spend 15.3% of their total aid on bettering public healthcare.<ref name=":1" />

==== International health aid debates ====
Debates exist questioning the efficacy of international health aid. Supporters of aid claim that health aid from wealthy countries is necessary in order for developing countries to escape the [[poverty trap]]. Opponents of health aid claim that international health aid actually disrupts developing countries' course of development, causes dependence on aid, and in many cases the aid fails to reach its recipients.<ref name=":7" /> For example, recently, health aid was funneled towards initiatives such as financing new technologies like [[antiretroviral medication]], [[Insecticide-treated mosquito net|insecticide-treated mosquito nets]], and new vaccines. The positive impacts of these initiatives can be seen in the eradication of smallpox and [[polio]]; however, critics claim that misuse or misplacement of funds may cause many of these efforts to never come into achievement.<ref name=":7" />

Economic modeling based on the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] and the [[World Health Organization]] has shown a link between international health aid in developing countries and a reduction in adult mortality rates.<ref name=":6" /> However, a 2014–2016 study suggests that a potential confounding variable for this outcome is the possibility that aid was directed at countries once they were already on track for improvement.<ref name=":7" /> That same study, however, also suggests that 1 billion dollars in health aid was associated with 364,000 fewer deaths occurring between ages 0 and 5 in 2011.<ref name=":7" />

=== Sustainable development goals for 2030 ===
{{Further|Sustainable Development Goals}}
To address current and future challenges in addressing health issues in the world, the [[United Nations]] have developed the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] building off the [[Millennium Development Goals]] of 2000 to be completed by 2030.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 2015 – United Nations sustainable development agenda|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/#|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date = 25 November 2015}}</ref> These goals in their entirety encompass the entire spectrum of development across nations, however Goals 1–6 directly address [[health disparities]], primarily in developing countries.<ref name=UN2015>{{Cite web|title = Sustainable development goals – United Nations|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date = 25 November 2015}}</ref> These six goals address key issues in [[Global health|Global Public Health]], [[Poverty]], Hunger and [[Food security]], Health, Education, [[Gender equality]] and [[women's empowerment]], and [[Drinking water|water]] and [[sanitation]].<ref name=UN2015/> Public health officials can use these goals to set their own agenda and plan for smaller scale initiatives for their organizations. These goals hope to lessen the burden of disease and inequality faced by developing countries and lead to a healthier future.

The links between the various sustainable development goals and public health are numerous and well established:
* Living below the poverty line is attributed to poorer health outcomes and can be even worse for persons living in developing countries where [[extreme poverty]] is more common.<ref>{{Cite web|title = NCCP {{!}} Child Poverty|url = http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html|website = www.nccp.org|access-date = 25 November 2015}}</ref> A child born into poverty is twice as likely to die before the age of five compared to a child from a wealthier family.<ref name=UNhealth2015>{{Cite web|title = Health – United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date = 25 November 2015}}</ref> 
* The detrimental effects of hunger and [[malnutrition]] that can arise from systemic challenges with food security are enormous. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 12.9 percent of the population in developing countries is undernourished.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hunger and food security – United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date = 25 November 2015}}</ref> 
* Health challenges in the developing world are enormous, with "only half of the women in developing nations receiving the recommended amount of healthcare they need.<ref name=UNhealth2015/> 
* [[Educational equity]] has yet to be reached in the world. Public health efforts are impeded by this, as a lack of education can lead to poorer health outcomes. This is shown by children of mothers who have no education having a lower survival rate compared to children born to mothers with primary or greater levels of education.<ref name=UNhealth2015/> Cultural differences in the role of women vary by country, many [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]] are found in developing nations. Combating these inequalities has shown to also lead to a better public health outcome.
* In studies done by the [[World Bank]] on populations in developing countries, it was found that when women had more control over household resources, the children benefit through better access to food, healthcare, and education.<ref>{{Cite web|title = World Development Report|url = https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/2124|website = openknowledge.worldbank.org|access-date = 25 November 2015}}</ref> 
* Basic [[sanitation]] resources and access to clean sources of water are a basic [[Right to water|human right]]. However, 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is contaminated by [[feces]], and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation facilities like [[toilet]]s or [[pit latrine]]s.<ref name=UNwater2015>{{Cite web|title = Water and Sanitation – United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date = 25 November 2015}}</ref> A lack of these resources is what causes approximately 1000 children a day to die from [[Diarrhea|diarrheal diseases]] that could have been prevented from better water and [[sanitation]] infrastructure.<ref name=UNwater2015/>

=== U.S. initiatives ===
{{Main|Global Health Initiatives}}The [[Global Health Initiatives|U.S. Global Health Initiative]] was created in 2009 by President Obama in an attempt to have a more holistic, comprehensive approach to improving global health as opposed to previous, disease-specific interventions.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8116.pdf|title=The U.S. Global Health Initiative|date=February 2011|website=Kaiser Family Foundation}}</ref> The Global Health Initiative is a six-year plan, "to develop a comprehensive U.S. government strategy for global health, building on the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) to combat HIV as well as U.S. efforts to address tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, and augmenting the focus on other global health priorities, including [[neglected tropical diseases]] (NTDs), maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH), [[family planning]] and reproductive health (FP/RH), [[nutrition]], and [[health systems strengthening]] (HSS)".<ref name=":8" /> The GHI programs are being implemented in more than 80 countries around the world and works closely with the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]].<ref name=":8" />

There are seven core principles:

#Women, girls, and gender equality
#Strategic coordination and integration
#Strengthen and leverage key multilaterals and other partners
#Country-ownership
#Sustainability through Health Systems
#Improve metrics, monitoring, and evaluation
#Promote research and innovation<ref name=":8" />

The aid effectiveness agenda is a useful tool for measuring the impact of these large scale programs such as [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] and the [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation|Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]] (GAVI) which have been successful in achieving rapid and visible results.<ref name=":1" /> The Global Fund claims that its efforts have provided antiretroviral treatment for over three million people worldwide.<ref name=":1" /> GAVI claims that its vaccination programs have prevented over 5 million deaths since it began in 2000.<ref name=":1" />

==Education and training==
Education and training of public health professionals is available throughout the world in Schools of Public Health, Medical Schools, Veterinary Schools, Schools of Nursing, and Schools of Public Affairs. The training typically requires a [[university degree]] with a focus on core disciplines of [[biostatistics]], [[epidemiology]], [[Health administration|health services administration]], [[health policy]], [[health education]], [[behavioral science]], gender issues, sexual and reproductive health, public health nutrition, and environmental and [[occupational health]].<ref name=mmwr4850>{{cite magazine|publisher =U.S. Department of Health & Human Services|date = 24 December 1999|title = Achievements in Public Health, 1900–1999  |url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4850.pdf|magazine = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume = 48 |number = 50}}</ref><ref>Public Health Agency of Canada.

In the global context, the field of public health education has evolved enormously in recent decades, supported by institutions such as the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]], among others. Operational structures are formulated by strategic principles, with educational and career pathways guided by competency frameworks, all requiring modulation according to local, national and global realities. It is critically important for the health of populations that nations assess their public health human resource needs and develop their ability to deliver this capacity, and not depend on other countries to supply it.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1159/000354198| pmid=23969636| pmc=5586806|title = The Imperative of Public Health Education: A Global Perspective| journal=Medical Principles and Practice| volume=22| issue=6| pages=515–529|year = 2013|last1 = White|first1 = Franklin}}</ref>

Even though schools of public health had already been established in [[Canada]], [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]], the United States had still maintained the traditional system of housing faculties of public health within their medical institutions.  A $25,000 donation from businessman [[Samuel Zemurray]] instituted the [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine|School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University]] in 1912 conferring its first doctor of public health degree in 1914.<ref>{{cite book|last=Darnell|first=Regna|title=Histories of anthropology annual|year=2008|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8032-6664-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=John Percy|title=Tulane: the biography of a university, 1834-1965|year=1966|publisher=Harper & Row|pages=136}}</ref>  The [[Yale School of Public Health]] was founded by [[Charles-Edward Avory Winslow]] in 1915.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of Yale's School of Medicine : passing torches to others|last=1933–2013|first=Burrow, Gerard N.|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300132885|location=New Haven|oclc=182530966}}</ref> The [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]] became an independent, degree-granting institution for research and training in public health, and the largest public health training facility in the United States,<ref>The World Book Encyclopedia, 1994, p. 135.</ref><ref>Education of the Physician: International Dimensions.

By 1922, schools of public health were established at [[Columbia university|Columbia]] and [[Harvard]] on the Hopkins model. By 1999 there were twenty nine schools of public health in the US, enrolling around fifteen thousand students.<ref name=mmwr4850/><ref name=PHP/>

Over the years, the types of students and training provided have also changed. In the beginning, students who enrolled in public health schools typically had already obtained a medical degree; public health school training was largely a second degree for [[physician|medical professionals]]. However, in 1978, 69% of American students enrolled in public health schools had only a [[bachelor's degree]].<ref name=mmwr4850/>

===Degrees in public health===
{{Main|Professional degrees of public health}}

Schools of public health offer a variety of degrees which generally fall into two categories: professional or academic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceph.org/pdf/Master_List.pdf|title=Schools of Public Health and Public Health Programs|date=11 March 2011|publisher=[[Council on Education for Public Health]]|access-date=30 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611212645/http://www.ceph.org/pdf/Master_List.pdf|archive-date=11 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The two major postgraduate degrees are the [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH) or the [[Master of Science]] in Public Health (MSPH). Doctoral studies in this field include [[Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in a subspecialty of greater Public Health disciplines. DrPH is regarded as a professional degree and PhD as more of an academic degree.

Professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings. The [[Master of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc/DHS) and the [[Master of Health Administration|Master of Health Care Administration]] are examples of degrees which are geared towards people who want careers as practitioners of public health in health departments, managed care and community-based organizations, hospitals and consulting firms, among others. [[Master of Public Health]] degrees broadly fall into two categories, those that put more emphasis on an understanding of epidemiology and statistics as the scientific basis of public health practice and those that include a more wide range of methodologies.  A Master of Science of Public Health is similar to an MPH but is considered an academic degree (as opposed to a professional degree) and places more emphasis on scientific methods and research.  The same distinction can be made between the DrPH and the DHSc. The DrPH is considered a professional degree and the DHSc is an academic degree.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Academic degrees are more oriented towards those with interests in the scientific basis of public health and [[preventive medicine]] who wish to pursue careers in research, university teaching in graduate programs, policy analysis and development, and other high-level public health positions. Examples of academic degrees are the [[Master of Science]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]], [[Doctor of Science]] (ScD), and [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc). The doctoral programs are distinct from the MPH and other professional programs by the addition of advanced coursework and the nature and scope of a [[dissertation]] research project.

Public health was born neither in [[Europe]] nor as a response to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Preventive health interventions are attested almost anywhere historical communities have left their mark.

[[File:The cow pock.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|1802 caricature of [[Edward Jenner]] vaccinating patients who feared it would make them sprout cowlike appendages]]

The practice of [[vaccination]] became prevalent in the 1800s, following the pioneering work of [[Edward Jenner]] in treating [[smallpox]]. [[James Lind]]'s discovery of the causes of [[scurvy]] amongst sailors and its mitigation via the introduction of [[fruit]] on lengthy voyages was published in 1754 and led to the adoption of this idea by the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Vale, Brian.

With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], living standards amongst the working population began to worsen, with cramped and unsanitary urban conditions. In the first four decades of the 19th century alone, [[London]]'s population doubled and even greater growth rates were recorded in the new industrial towns, such as [[Leeds]] and [[Manchester]]. This rapid [[urbanisation]] exacerbated the spread of disease in the large [[conurbation]]s that built up around the [[workhouse]]s and [[factory|factories]]. These settlements were cramped and primitive with no organized [[sanitation]]. Disease was inevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants. Unavailable housing led to the rapid growth of [[slum]]s and the [[per capita]] [[death rate]] began to rise alarmingly, almost doubling in [[Birmingham]] and [[Liverpool]]. [[Thomas Malthus]] warned of the dangers of overpopulation in 1798. His ideas, as well as those of [[Jeremy Bentham]], became very influential in government circles in the early years of the 19th century.<ref name=Britannica/>

====Public health legislation====
[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]] was a pivotal influence on the early public health campaign.]]

The first attempts at sanitary reform and the establishment of public health institutions were made in the 1840s. [[Thomas Southwood Smith]], physician at the [[London Fever Hospital]], began to write papers on the importance of public health, and was one of the first physicians brought in to give evidence before the [[Poor Law Commission]] in the 1830s, along with [[Neil Arnott]] and [[James Phillips Kay]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Amanda J.

The [[Poor Law Commission]] reported in 1838 that "the expenditures necessary to the adoption and maintenance of measures of prevention would ultimately amount to less than the cost of the disease now constantly engendered". It recommended the implementation of large scale government [[engineering]] projects to alleviate the conditions that allowed for the propagation of disease.<ref name=Britannica/> The [[Health of Towns Association]] was formed at [[Exeter Hall London]] on 11 December 1844, and vigorously campaigned for the development of public health in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=Ashton>{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|access-date=8 July 2013|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|pmid=11622856|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archive-date=24 December 2013}}</ref> Its formation followed the 1843 establishment of the Health of Towns Commission, chaired by Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]], which produced a series of reports on poor and insanitary conditions in British cities.<ref name=Ashton/>

These national and local movements led to the [[Public Health Act 1848|Public Health Act]], finally passed in 1848. It aimed to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in England and Wales by placing the supply of water, sewerage, drainage, cleansing and paving under a single local body with the General Board of Health as a central authority. The Act was passed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[First Russell ministry|government]] of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], in response to the urging of [[Edwin Chadwick]]. Chadwick's seminal report on ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was published in 1842<ref>{{cite book | title=excerpt from ''Report...from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'' (pp. 369–372) (online source)|chapter-url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html|last=Chadwick|first=Edwin|chapter=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions | year=1842| publisher=to The Victorian Web|location=added by Laura Del Col|access-date=8 November 2009}}</ref> and was followed up with a supplementary report a year later.<ref>{{cite book | title=Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain.

[[Vaccination]] for various diseases was made compulsory in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851, and by 1871 legislation required a comprehensive system of registration run by appointed vaccination officers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue?sn=4127 |title=Decline of Infant Mortality in England and Wales, 1871–1948 : a Medical Conundrum|access-date=17 December 2012}}</ref>

Further interventions were made by a series of subsequent [[Public Health Acts]], notably the [[Public Health Act 1875|1875 Act]]. Reforms included latrinization, the building of [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, the regular [[waste disposal|collection of garbage]] followed by [[incineration]] or disposal in a [[landfill]], the [[History of water supply|provision of clean water]] and the draining of standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.

The [[Infectious Disease (Notification) Act 1889]] mandated the reporting of infectious diseases to the local sanitary authority, which could then pursue measures such as the removal of the patient to hospital and the disinfection of homes and properties.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Intrusive Interventions: Public Health, Domestic Space, and Infectious Disease Surveillance in England, 1840–1914|last = Mooney|first = Graham|publisher = University of Rochester Press|year = 2015|isbn = 9781580465274|location = Rochester, NY}}</ref>

In the United States, the first public health organization based on a state health department and local boards of health was founded in [[New York City]] in 1866.<ref>United States Public Health Service, ''Municipal Health Department Practice for the Year 1923'' (Public Health Bulletin # 164, July 1926), pp.  348, 357, 364</ref>

[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s dot map, showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854]]

The science of [[epidemiology]] was founded by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 [[cholera]] outbreak in London. Dr. Snow believed in the [[germ theory]] of disease as opposed to the prevailing [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. He first publicized his theory in an essay, ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'', in 1849, followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the [[Soho]] epidemic of 1854.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSHXLkgFBBQC&pg=PA290|title=L'histoire des vaccinations|first=Hervé|last=Bazin|date=18 May 2008|publisher=John Libbey Eurotext|access-date=18 May 2020|via=Google Books}}</ref>

By talking to local residents (with the help of [[Reverend Henry Whitehead]]), he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]).  Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle.<ref>Vinten-Johansen, Peter, ''et al''. (2003). ''Cholera, Chloroform, and the Science of Medicine: A Life of John Snow''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-513544-X}}</ref>

Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump.  He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases.  He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography.  It is regarded as the founding event of the science of [[epidemiology]].<ref>[[Steven Berlin Johnson|Johnson, Steven]] (2006).

====Disease control====

With the pioneering work in [[bacteriology]] of French chemist [[Louis Pasteur]] and German scientist [[Robert Koch]], methods for isolating the [[bacteria]] responsible for a given disease and vaccines for remedy were developed at the turn of the 20th century. British physician [[Ronald Ross]] identified the [[mosquito]] as the carrier of [[malaria]] and laid the foundations for combating the disease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1123&Itemid=10|title=:: Laboc Hospital – A Noble Prize Winner's Workplace|publisher=easternpanorama.in|access-date=11 July 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105175214/http://easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1123&Itemid=10|archive-date=5 November 2013}}</ref> [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] revolutionized [[surgery]] by the introduction of [[antiseptic]] [[surgery]] to eliminate [[infection]].

With onset of the [[epidemiological transition]] and as the prevalence of [[Infectious disease in the 20th century|infectious diseases decreased through the 20th century]], public health began to put more focus on [[chronic diseases]] such as [[cancer]] and [[heart disease]]. Previous efforts in many developed countries had already led to dramatic reductions in the [[infant mortality rate]] using preventive methods. In Britain, the infant mortality rate fell from over 15% in 1870 to 7% by 1930.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=wps-48-2012.pdf&site=24|title=The declines in infant mortality and fertility: Evidence from British cities in demographic transition |access-date=17 December 2012}}</ref> The development of public health services and sanitation, and education in improving women and child health in the poorest [[Slum|slums]] of [[Glasgow]], led by Dr. [[Nora Wattie]] from 1939 to1964, was recognised in the [[United Kingdom]] by the award of an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for services to public health.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mackie|first=Elizabeth M|last2=Scott Wilson|first2=T.|date=12 November 1994|title=Obituary N.I.Wattie|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=309|pages=1297}}</ref>

=== Country examples ===
====France====
{{Main|Health in France}}
[[French Third Republic|France 1871–1914]] followed well behind Bismarckian Germany, as well as Great Britain, in developing the welfare state including public health.  Tuberculosis was the most dreaded disease of the day, especially striking young people in their 20s.  Germany set up vigorous measures of public hygiene and public sanatoria, but France let private physicians handle the problem, which left it with a much higher death rate.<ref>Allan Mitchell, ''The Divided Path: The German Influence on Social Reform in France After 1870'' (1991) pp 252–75 [https://www.amazon.com/Divided-Path-German-Influence-Social/dp/0807857432 excerpt]</ref> The French medical profession jealously guarded its prerogatives, and public health activists were not as well organized or as influential as in Germany, Britain or the United States.<ref>Martha L. Hildreth, ''Doctors, Bureaucrats & Public Health in France, 1888–1902'' (1987)</ref><ref>Alisa Klaus, ''Every Child a Lion: The Origins of Maternal & Infant Health Policy in the United States & France, 1890–1920'' (1993).</ref> For example, there was a long battle over a [[public health law]] which began in the 1880s as a campaign to reorganize the nation's health services, to require the registration of infectious diseases, to mandate quarantines, and to improve the deficient health and housing legislation of 1850. However the reformers met opposition from bureaucrats, politicians, and physicians. Because it was so threatening to so many interests, the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902. Success finally came when the government realized that contagious diseases had a national security impact in weakening military recruits, and keeping the population growth rate well below Germany's.<ref>Ann-Louise Shapiro, "Private Rights, Public Interest, and Professional Jurisdiction: The French Public Health Law of 1902." ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' 54.1 (1980): 4+</ref>

====United States====

Modern public health began developing in the 19th century, as a response to advances in science that led to the understanding of, the source and spread of disease. As the knowledge of contagious diseases increased, means to control them and prevent infection were soon developed. Once it became understood that these strategies would require community-wide participation, disease control began being viewed as a public responsibility. Various organizations and agencies were then created to implement these disease preventing strategies.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218224/|title=A History of the Public Health System|last=Health|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for the Study of the Future of Public|date=1988|publisher=National Academies Press (US)}}</ref>

Most of the Public health activity in the United States took place at the municipal level before the mid-20th century. There was some activity at the national and state level as well.<ref>John Duffy, ''The sanitarians: a history of American public health'' (1992).</ref>

In the administration of the second president of the United States [[John Adams]], the Congress authorized the creation of hospitals for mariners.  As the U.S. expanded, the scope of the governmental health agency expanded.

In the United States, public health worker [[Sara Josephine Baker]], M.D. established many programs to help the poor in New York City keep their infants healthy, leading teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] and teaching mothers how to dress, feed, and bathe their babies.

Another key pioneer of public health in the U.S. was [[Lillian Wald]], who founded the [[Henry Street Settlement]] house in New York.  The [[Visiting Nurse Service of New York]] was a significant organization for bringing health care to the urban poor.

Dramatic increases in average life span in the late 19th century and 20th century, is widely credited to public health achievements, such as [[vaccination]] programs and control of many infectious diseases including [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], [[diphtheria]], [[yellow fever]] and [[smallpox]]; effective health and safety policies such as [[road traffic safety]] and [[Occupational safety and health|occupational safety]]; improved [[family planning]]; [[tobacco control]] measures; and programs designed to decrease [[non-communicable disease]]s by acting on known risk factors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment.

Another major public health improvement was the decline in the "urban penalty" brought about by improvements in [[sanitation]]. These improvements included [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of drinking water, filtration and [[sewage treatment]] which led to the decline in deaths caused by infectious [[waterborne diseases]] such as [[cholera]] and intestinal diseases.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cutler|first=David|author2=Grant Miller |title=The Role of Public Health Improvements in Health Advances: The Twentieth Century United States |journal=[[Demography (journal)|Demography]] |date=February 2004 |volume=42 |issue=1 |oclc=703811616 |doi=10.1353/dem.2005.0002|pages=1–22|pmid=15782893 |s2cid=35536095}}</ref>
The federal Office of Indian Affairs (OIA) operated a large-scale field nursing program. Field nurses targeted native women for health education, emphasizing personal hygiene and infant care and nutrition.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hancock Christin L | year = 2001 | title = Healthy Vocatoons: Field Nursing and the Religious Overtones of Public Health | journal = [[Journal of Women's History]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 113–137 | doi = 10.1353/jowh.2011.0035 | pmid = 22145184 | s2cid = 13226474 }}</ref>

Public health issues were important for the [[Spanish Empire]] during the colonial era.  Epidemic disease was the main factor in the decline of indigenous populations in the era immediately following the sixteenth-century conquest era and was a problem during the colonial era. The Spanish crown took steps in eighteenth-century Mexico to bring in regulations to make populations healthier.<ref>Donald Cooper, ''Epidemic Disease in Mexico City, 1761–1813: An Administrative, Social, and Medical History''.

The [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] was established in 1943, during the administration of President [[Manuel Avila Camacho]] to deal with public health, pensions, and social security.

====Cuba====
{{see also|Timeline of healthcare in Cuba}}
Since the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] the [[Cuban government]] has devoted extensive resources to the improvement of [[Healthcare in Cuba|health conditions]] for its entire population via universal access to health care. Infant mortality has plummeted.<ref>Pineo, "Public Health", p. 483.</ref> [[Cuban medical internationalism]] as a policy has seen the Cuban government sent doctors as a form of aid and export to countries in need in Latin America, especially [[Mission Barrio Adentro|Venezuela]], as well as Oceania and Africa countries.

====Colombia and Bolivia====
Public health was important elsewhere in Latin America in consolidating state power and integrating marginalized populations into the nation-state.  In Colombia, public health was a means for creating and implementing ideas of citizenship.<ref>Hanni Jalil, "Curing a Sick Nation: Public Health and Citizenship in Colombia, 1930–1940."
