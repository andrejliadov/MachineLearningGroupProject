'''Isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine''' is a fixed dose combination drug treatment specifically approved by the US FDA to be used to treat self-identified [[black people]] with [[congestive heart failure]].  It is a combination of [[hydralazine]] (an [[antihypertensive]]) and [[isosorbide dinitrate]] (a [[vasodilator]]).<ref name=Ferdinand2014rev>{{cite journal|last1=Ferdinand|first1=KC|last2=Elkayam|first2=U|last3=Mancini|first3=D|last4=Ofili|first4=E|last5=Piña|first5=I|last6=Anand|first6=I|last7=Feldman|first7=AM|last8=McNamara|first8=D|last9=Leggett|first9=C|title=Use of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in African-Americans with heart failure 9 years after the African-American Heart Failure Trial.|journal=The American Journal of Cardiology|date=1 July 2014|volume=114|issue=1|pages=151–9|pmid=24846808|url=http://www.ajconline.org/article/S0002-9149(14)00975-8/pdf|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.04.018|doi-access=free}}</ref>  It is the first [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]-based [[prescription drug]] in the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=What's the Use of Race?: Modern Governance and the Biology of Difference |editor1-last=Whitmarsh |editor1-first=Ian |editor2-last=Jones |editor2-first=David S. |year=2010 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge (MA) |isbn=978-0-262-51424-8 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262514248_sch_0001.pdf |lay-url=http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_111448.asp |lay-date=28 April 2013 |access-date=8 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305134201/http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262514248_sch_0001.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{rp|7}}

The combination preparation is marketed in the United States under the trade name '''BiDil''' by [[Arbor Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]] which purchased the rights to market the drug in December 2011 from NitroMed.

==Background==

From 1980 to 1985 Dr. Jay Cohn of the University of Minnesota led a clinical trial in collaboration with the US [[Veterans Administration]] called the Vasodilator-Heart Failure Trial (V-HeFT I) that tested whether the combination of  Isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine increased survival in patients with heart failure; the results were promising and the study was followed by V-HeFT II, which tested the combination against [[enalapril]].<ref name=Kahn>Jonathan Kahn.  BiDil and Racialized Medicine.  Chapter 7 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=OVg4AAAAQBAJ Race and the Genetic Revolution: Science, Myth, and Culture], Eds Sheldon Krimsky and Kathleen Sloan. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-231-52769-9}}</ref>  In the meantime, Cohn applied for a patent on the combination treatment, which issued in 1989 as US Patent 4868179.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents/US4868179 US4868179]</ref>  Cohn licensed the patent to a company called Medco, and Medco spent the early 1990s preparing a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) to get the FDA to approve BiDil on the basis of the V-HeFT trials. However, the trials were not designed to support an NDA, and in 1997 the FDA rejected the application because it did not have enough [[statistical power]] to show whether the combination really worked.<ref name=Kahn/>

Cohn re-analyzed the data and found a signal that the drug combination appeared to work better in self-identified African-Americans in the V-HeFT trial, and published a paper on that work, and filed a new patent on the use of BiDil in black patients.<ref name=Kahn/><ref>Carson P, et al.

The new patent and the old patent were licensed to a company called NitroMed, which ran a clinical called the African-American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT), the results of which were published in 2004 in the New England Journal of Medicine.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal |vauthors=Taylor AL, Ziesche S, Yancy C, Carson P, ((D'Agostino R Jr)), Ferdinand K, Taylor M, Adams K, Sabolinski M, Worcel M, Cohn JN | title = Combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine in blacks with heart failure | journal = N Engl J Med | year = 2004 | volume = 351 | pages = 2049–57 | pmid = 15533851 | issue = 20 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa042934}}</ref>  The clinical trial was stopped early because the drug worked so well; it reduced mortality by 43%, reduced hospitalizations by 39%, and improved quality of life markers in African-American patients with CHF.<ref name=Taylor/>

On the basis of A-HeFT, the FDA approved BiDil in June 2005.<ref name=Kahn/><ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Overview&DrugName=BIDIL FDA approval process page]</ref><ref>[https://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2005/NEW01190.html FDA approval press release]</ref>  In 2006, the [[Heart Failure Society of America]] included the use of the fixed dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine as the standard of care in the treatment of heart failure in blacks.<ref>Heart Failure Society of America.

J Card Fail. 2006 Feb;12(1):e1-e122.</ref>{{rp|e44}}

Though BiDil must still be taken three times daily, as must the component pills in separate ISDN-H treatment, the reduction in pill burden has been suggested to improve compliance, and thus a better medical outcome.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.theheart.org/article/759547/print.do|title=BiDil, regulatory milestone but a tough sell for insurers and patients, charts uncertain course|author=Steve Stiles|date=13 December 2006}}</ref>

==Controversy==

The new drug application claiming treatment of a single, self-identified racial group raised a storm of controversy. Some hailed the development of BiDil as a breakthrough for African Americans (such groups included the Black congressional Caucus, the Association of Black Cardiologists, the National Medical Association, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and a step to addressing the unique health care needs and [[Race and health in the United States#African-Americans|health disparities of the African American community]].<ref name=Roberts>Dorothy Roberts.  The Color Coded Pill.  Chapter 8 in [https://archive.org/details/fatalin_rob_2011_00_4041 Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Re-create Race in the Twenty-first Century]. The New Press. {{ISBN|978-1-595-58834-0}}</ref>

Others who criticized the preliminary studies argued that the original study did not have a significant number of African-American subjects to make the BiDil's race specific claims,<ref>Roberts 2011, p. 171</ref> and that the results of only one clinical trial where African-Americans were tested does not provide a full and comprehensive study.<ref>Roberts 2011, p. 174</ref> Furthermore, critics argued that self-identified racial identifications from patients as an indicator for race during the trials were not a sufficient categorization method because these self-identifications were socially constructed and have no biological connection to genomic data.<ref>Roberts 2011, p. 175</ref>

They argued that the trials represented a new form of scientific racism where race, a socially constructed category, would continue to be present in research as a placeholder for genomic identification.<ref name=Kahn/><ref>[http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2008/11/28/segments/113776 WNYC ''Radiolab'' audio story about racial issues surrounding Bidil]</ref><ref>Editors, Scientific American.

Additionally, some disagreed with the design of the A-HeFT trial because the trial failed to include any non-African American test subjects.<ref name="Puckrein2006">Puckrein, G. (2006). BiDil: From Another Vantage Point. Health Affairs . Retrieved October 1, 2013, from http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/25/5/w368.long</ref> The trial was designed to include only African American test subjects, therefore failing to show that BiDil has a greater effectiveness in African Americans than those in other races.<ref>Margaret Kimberly, AlterNet.
