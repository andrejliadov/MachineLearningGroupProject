The presence of '''women in medicine''', particularly in the practicing fields of [[surgery]] and as [[physician]]s, has been traced to earliest human history. Women have historically had lower participation levels in medical fields compared to men with occupancy rates varying by race, socioeconomic status, and geography.

Women's informal practice of medicine in roles such as caregivers, or as [[allied health professions|allied health professionals]], has been widespread. Since the start of the 20th century, most countries of the world provide women with equal access to [[medical education]]. Not all countries ensure equal employment opportunities,<ref>{{cite web|title=Discrimination|work=Women's Human Rights|date=1999|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|url=https://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/women/women3.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114195509/http://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/women/women3.html|archive-date=14 November 2008}}</ref> and gender equality has yet to be achieved within medical [[Specialty (medicine)|specialties]] and around the world,<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Reichenbach L, Brown H|date=September 2004|title=Gender and academic medicine: impacts on the health workforce|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=329|issue=7469|pages=792–795|pmid=15459056|doi=10.1136/bmj.329.7469.792|pmc=521007}}</ref> studies suggesting that female doctors may be providing higher-quality care than male doctors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Tsugawa|first1=Yusuke|last2=Jena|first2=Anupam B.|last3=Figueroa|first3=Jose F.|last4=Orav|first4=E.

==History==

===Ancient medicine===
The involvement of women in the field of [[medicine]] has been recorded in several early civilizations. An [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] of the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] or [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], [[Merit-Ptah]], described in an inscription as "chief physician", is the earliest woman named in the [[history of science]].<ref name="auto12">{{Cite book|author=Michael E.

===Medieval Europe===
[[File:Hildegard von Bingen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Hildegard of Bingen]], a Medieval German abbess who wrote ''Causae et Curae'', 1175.]]
During the [[Middle Ages]], [[convent]]s were a centralized place of education for women, and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly [[research]]. An example is the [[Germans|German]] [[abbess]] [[Hildegard of Bingen]], whose prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects, including [[medicine]], [[botany]] and [[natural history]] (c. 1151–58).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html |title=Hildegard von Bingen (1098–1179) |author=Sabina Flanagan |publisher=University of Adelaide |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050406172530/http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/horst/hildegard/documents/flanagan.html |archive-date=2005-04-06 |url-status=dead |accessdate=11 October 2015}}</ref> She is considered Germany's first female [[physician]].<ref name="hildegard">{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Hildegard von Bingen | encyclopedia = Key Figures in Medieval Europe – An Encyclopedia | editor = Richard K.

Women in the Middle Ages participated in healing techniques and capacities.

Women also engaged in midwifery and healing arts without having their activities recorded in written records, and practiced in rural areas or where there was little access to medical care. Society in the Middle Ages limited women's role as physician. Once universities established faculties of medicine during the thirteenth century, women were excluded from advanced medical education.<ref name="jstor.org" /> Licensure began to require clerical vows for which women were ineligible, and healing as a profession became male-dominated.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

In many occasions, women had to fight against accusation of illegal practice done by males, putting into question their motives. If they were not accused of [[malpractice]], then women were considered "witches" by both clerical and civil authorities.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=WL|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history|date=1992|journal=Am J Public Health|pmc=1694293|pmid=1739168|volume=82|issue=2|pages=288–95|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288}}</ref> Surgeons and barber-surgeons were often organized into guilds, they could hold out longer against the pressures of licensure. Like other guilds, a number of the barber-surgeon guilds allowed the daughters and wives of their members to take up membership in the guild, generally after the man's death. Katherine la surgiene of London, daughter of Thomas the surgeon and sister of William the Surgeon belonged to a guild in 1286.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rawcliffe|first1=Carole|title=Medicine and Society in Later Medieval England|date=1997|publisher=Sutton|location=Stroud, Gloucestershire|isbn=978-0-7509-1497-0}}</ref> Documentation of female members in the guilds of Lincoln, Norwich, Dublin and York continue until late in the period.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Midwives, those who assisted pregnant women through childbirth and some aftercare, included only women. Midwives constituted roughly one third of female medical practitioners.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Men did not involve themselves in women's medical care; women did not involve themselves in men's health care.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Monica|title=Women's Medical Practice and Health Care in Medieval Europe|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|jstor=3174557|volume=14|issue=2|pages=434–473|doi=10.1086/494516|pmid=11618104|year=1989|s2cid=38651601}}</ref> The southern [[Italy|Italian]] coastal town of Salerno was a center of medical education and practice in the 12th century. In Salerno the physician [[Trota of Salerno]] compiled a number of her medical practices in several written collections. One work on women's medicine that was associated with her, the ''De curis mulierum'' ("On Treatments for Women") formed the core of what came to be known as the ''[[Trotula]]'' ensemble, a compendium of three texts that circulated throughout medieval Europe.  Trota herself gained a reputation that spread as far as France and England. There are also references in the writings of other Salernitan physicians to the ''mulieres Salernitane'' ("Salernitan women"), which give some idea of local empirical practices.<ref>Monica H.

===Medieval Islamic world===
For the medieval Islamic world, little information is known about female medical practitioners although it is likely that women were regularly involved in medical practice in some capacity.<ref name=":3" /> Male medical writers refer to the presence of female practitioners (a ''ṭabība'') in describing certain procedures or situations.<ref name=":3" /> The late-10th to early-11th century Andalusi physician and surgeon [[al-Zahrawi]] wrote that certain medical procedures were difficult for male doctors practicing on female patients because of the need to touch the genitalia.<ref name=":3" /> The male practitioner was required to either find a female doctor who could perform the procedure, or a eunuch physician, or a midwife who took instruction from the male surgeon.<ref name=":3" /> The existence of female practitioners can be inferred, albeit not explicitly, through direct evidence.<ref name=":3">Monica H.

===Western medicine in China===
Traditional [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medicine]] based on the use of [[Chinese herbology|herbal medicine]], [[acupuncture]], [[Traditional Chinese massage|massage]] and other forms of therapy has been practiced in China for thousands of years. Western medicine was introduced to China in the 19th Century, mainly by medical missionaries sent from various Christian mission organizations, such as the [[London Missionary Society]] (Britain), the [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church (Britain) and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian Church]] (US). [[Benjamin Hobson]] (1816–1873), a medical missionary sent by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1839, set up the Wai Ai Clinic (惠愛醫館)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.ifeng.com/article/46027.html |title=回眸：当年传教士进羊城_MW悦读室之岭南话廊_凤凰博报- 博采众家之言 报闻公民心声-凤凰网 |publisher=Blog.ifeng.com |accessdate=2012-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313042953/http://blog.ifeng.com/article/46027.html |archive-date=13 March 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/GDSI199901009.htm |title=合信的《全体新论》与广东士林-《广东史志》1999年01期-中国知网 |publisher=Mall.cnki.net |date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-07-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007074316/http://mall.cnki.net/magazine/Article/GDSI199901009.htm |archive-date=7 October 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> in Guangzhou, China. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] (香港華人西醫書院) was founded in 1887 by the [[London Missionary Society]], with its first graduate (in 1892) being [[Sun Yat-sen]] (孫中山).

Due to the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, Chinese women were reluctant to be treated by Western male doctors. This resulted in a need for female doctors. One of these was [[Sigourney Trask]] of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who set-up a hospital in [[Fuzhou]] during the mid-19th century. Trask also arranged for a local girl, [[Hü King Eng]], to study medicine at [[Ohio Wesleyan Female College]], with the intention that Hü would return to practise western medicine in Fuzhou. After graduation, Hü became the resident physician at Fuzhou's [[Woolston Memorial Hospital]] in 1899 and trained several female physicians.<ref name="Burton">{{cite book|title=Notable Women of Modern China|last1=Burton|first1=Margaret E.|author-link=Margaret E.

==Women's health movement, 1970s==
The 1970s marked an increase of women entering and graduating from [[medical school]] in the United States.<ref name=":4" /> From 1930 to 1970, a period of 40 years, around 14,000 women graduated from medical school.<ref name=":4" /> From 1970 to 1980, a period of 10 years, over 20,000 women graduated from medical school.<ref name=":4">Paludi, Michele A. and Gertrude A. Streuernage, ed., Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines (New York: Harrington Park Press, 1990), p. 236.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> This increase of women in the medical field was due to both political and cultural changes. Two laws in the U.S. lifted restrictions for women in the medical field – [[Title IX]] of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1972 and the [[Public Health Service Act]] of 1975, banning discrimination on grounds of gender.<ref name=":5" /> In November 1970, the Assembly of the Association of American Medical Colleges rallied for equal rights in the medical field.<ref name=":5">Paludi and Streuernage, ''Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines'', pf. 236.</ref>

Throughout the decade women's ideas about themselves and their relation to the medical field were shifting due to the [[Feminist movement|women's feminist movement]].<ref name=":6" /> A sharp increase of women in the medical field led to developments in doctor-patient relationships, changes in terminology and theory.<ref name=":6" /> One area of medical practice that was challenged and changed was [[gynecology]].<ref name=":6">Kline, Wendy. ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women's Health in the Second Wave'' (University of Chicago Press, 2010).</ref> Author Wendy Kline noted that "to ensure that young brides were ready for the wedding night, [doctors] used the [[pelvic exam]] as a form of sex instruction."<ref>Kline, ''Bodies of Knowledge: Sexuality, Reproduction, and Women's Health in the Second Wave,'' p 4.</ref>

With higher numbers of women enrolled in medical school, medical practices like gynecology were challenged and subsequently altered.<ref name=":7" /> In 1972, the University of Iowa Medical School instituted a new training program for pelvic and breast examinations.<ref name=":7" /> Students would act both as the doctor and the patient, allowing each student to understand the procedure and create a more gentle, respectful examination.<ref name=":7" /> With changes in ideologies and practices throughout the 70s, by 1980 over 75 schools had adopted this new method.<ref name=":7">Paludi and Streuernage, ''Foundations for a Feminist Restructuring of the Academic Disciplines'', p. 241.</ref>

Along with women entering the medical field and feminist rights movement, came along the women's health movement which sought alternative methods of health care for women. This came through the creation of self-help books, most notably ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]: A Book by and for Women''.<ref name=":8">Boston Women's Health Book Collective Staff, ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women'' (Boston: Simon and Schuster Trade, 1976).</ref> This book gave women a "manual" to help understand their body. It challenged hospital treatment, and doctors' practices.<ref name=":8" /> Aside from self-help books, many help centres were opened: birth centres run by [[midwives]], safe [[abortion]] centres, and classes for educating women on their bodies, all with the aim of providing non-judgmental care for women.<ref name=":9">Schulman, Bruce J. The Seventies: The Great Shift in American Culture, Society, and politics. (Da Capo Press, 2002), p. 174.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> The women's health movement, along with women involved in the medical field, opened the doors for research and awareness for female illness like [[breast cancer]] and [[cervical cancer]].<ref name=":9" />

Scholars in the history of medicine had developed some study of women in the field—biographies of pioneering women physicians were common prior to the 1960s—and study of women in medicine took particular root with the advent of the women's movement in the 1960s, and in conjunction with the [[women's health movement]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}

At the beginning of the 21st-century in industrialized nations, women have made significant gains, but have yet to achieve parity throughout the medical profession.

In many developing nations, neither medical school nor practice approach gender parity.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Moreover, there are skews within the medical profession: some medical specialties, such as surgery, are significantly male-dominated,<ref>Dixie Mills, "Women in Surgery – Past, Present, and Future" (2003 presentation), [[Association of Women Surgeons]]; available at [http://www.womensurgeons.org/about/items/womeninsurgery2003c.ppt AWS website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109233732/http://womensurgeons.org/about/items/womeninsurgery2003c.ppt|date=9 January 2007}}.</ref> while other specialties are significantly female-dominated, or are becoming so.

Biomedical research and academic medical professions—i.e., faculty at medical schools—are also disproportionately male. Research on this issue, called the "leaky pipeline" by the [[National Institutes of Health]] and other researchers, shows that while women have achieved parity with men in entering graduate school, a variety of discrimination causes them to drop out at each stage in the academic pipeline: graduate school, [[postdoc]], faculty positions, achieving tenure; and, ultimately, in receiving recognition for groundbreaking work.<ref>The term was coined by S.E.

===Glass ceiling===
The "[[glass ceiling]]" is a metaphor to convey the undefined obstacles that women and minorities face in the workplace. Female physicians of the late 19th-century faced discrimination in many forms due to the prevailing [[Victorian era|Victorian Era]] attitude that the ideal woman be demure, display a gentle demeanor, act submissively, and enjoy a perceived form of power that should be exercised over and from within the home.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}} Medical degrees were difficult for women to earn, and once practicing, discrimination from landlords for medical offices, left female physicians to set up their practices on "Scab Row" or "bachelor's apartments."<ref>{{Cite book|last=F.|first=Cott, Nancy|title=History of women in the United States: historical articles on women's lives and activities|date=1992–1994|publisher=K.G.

The ''[[Journal of Women's Health]]'' surveyed physician mothers and their physician daughters in order to analyze the effect that discrimination and harassment have on the individual and their career.<ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127" /> This study included 84% of physician mothers that graduated medical school prior to 1970, with the majority of these physicians graduating in the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127" /> The authors of this study stated that discrimination in the medical field persisted after the title VII discrimination legislation was passed in 1965.<ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127">{{cite journal|author=Shrier Diane K., Zucker Alyssa N., Mercurio Andrea E., Landry Laura J., Rich Michael, Shrier Lydia A.|year=2007|title=Generation to Generation: Discrimination and Harassment Experiences of Physician Mothers and Their Physician Daughters|journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1–13|doi=10.1089/jwh.2006.0127|pmid=17678459}}</ref> This was the case until 1970, when the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) filed a class action lawsuit against all medical schools in the United States. By 1975,  the number of women in medicine had nearly tripled, and has continued to grow. By 2005, more than 25% of physicians and around 50% of medical school students were women. The increase of women in medicine also came with an increase of women identifying as a racial/ethnic minority, yet this population is still largely underrepresented in comparison to the general population of the medical field.<ref name="10.1089/jwh.2006.0127" />

Within this specific study, 22% of physician mothers and 24% of physician daughters identified themselves as being an ethnic minority. These women reported experiencing instances of exclusion from career opportunities as a result of their race and gender. According to this article, females tend to have lessened confidence in their abilities as a doctor, yet their performance is equivalent to that of their male counterparts.
