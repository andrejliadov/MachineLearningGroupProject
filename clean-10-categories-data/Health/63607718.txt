== Survey report ==
Professor Hiroshi Nishiura of [[Hokkaido University]], a member of Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting, analyzed the days when they were infected based on the data of the onset date and incubation period of passengers and crews. It was speculated that passengers were infected during the three days from February 2 to 4.
However, the crew, who continued to support the lives of passengers as "essential workers", became infected a week after the cruise ship anchored.
Although strict rules were laid out and medical equipment such as [[N95 masks]] were distributed to them, it was difficult for those who were not medical workers to act as instructed.
The living environment of their communal living also increased the risk.
There was no bias or regularity in the distribution of infected sites on the cruise ship.
After searching for traces of the virus's genes, the most common place was modular bathroom floors.<ref name="survey report Cruise ship"/>

According to the [[Self-Defense Forces]] Central Hospital, which accepted some of the patients of the cruise ship, the average age of the patients was 68 years, and the number of men and women was about half. Cruise ship crews were mainly in their 30s and 50s, and passengers were mainly in their 70s.
48% of the patients had underlying disease. Cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension are the most common, followed by endocrine disorder such as thyroid diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases, and cancer in that order.
The condition of patients during hospitalization was mild (41.3%) and severe (26.9%), but 31.7% had no clinical findings during the entire period.<ref name="Self-Defense Force Central Hospital">{{cite web|url=https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2020/04300801/?all=1|title=クルーズ船112人治療で「院内感染」ゼロ!「自衛隊中央病院」はなぜ奇跡を起こせたのか
|date= 30 April 2020|website=週刊新潮|language=ja|access-date= 24 May 2020}}</ref>

Those infected got [[CT scans]] even asymptomatic and mild symptoms at the SDF Central Hospital, and half of them were found to be abnormalities.
Their CT images showed a [[frosted glass]]-like shadow, a feature of the new coronavirus pneumonia.
About one-third of patients with abnormal shadows in the lungs subsequently had worsening symptoms.
They often started to get worse on the 7th to 10th day of their first symptoms, which progressed relatively slowly.
Captain Tamura, a medical officer  at The SDF Central Hospital, believes that the progression of inflammation in the patient's lungs in the absence of subjective symptoms is one of the reasons why the infections, which were thought to be mild, seemed to worsen rapidly.
They called it "Silent Pneumonia"  in the sense of pneumonia that develops without any symptoms.
It was found that the deterioration of the patient's condition can be sensed by detecting decreased [[SpO2]] (blood oxygen saturation) in the elderly and [[tachypnea]] in the young.
The risk factors for mortality were mainly age (elderly people) and basic diseases, but there were a few cases in which the disease became severe even though they were neither. However, the cause was not able to be grasped.<ref name="survey report Cruise ship"/><ref name="Self-Defense Force Central Hospital"/>

[[PCR test]] on board was widely carried out.
However, there were several cases in which PCR tests showed that they were negative despite having close contact with infected patients who got CT scans and had "frosted glass-like shadows" in their lungs.
The patients were supposed to have two PCR tests at intervals to leave the hospital, but in many cases the second was positive, even though the first was negative.
Tamura said that he felt the [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of PCR test was about 70%.
The percentage of "about 70%" was also stated by the doctor at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine who treated coronavirus infections.
Sensitivity is an index to measure the proportion of positives, in the case of 70%, 30% of actual positives may be judged as false negatives and released.<ref name="Self-Defense Force Central Hospital"/>
In fact, there were a series of people in Japan and abroad who tested positive after disembarking, even though they tested negative on board.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASN2Q7HF0N2QUTIL01L.html|title=クルーズ船下船の乗客に陽性反応 船内検査では陰性|date= 22 February 2020|website=朝日新聞|language=ja|access-date= 28 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASN375RLFN37UBUB00B.html|title=クルーズ船の60代乗客が感染 陽性→2度の陰性→陽性|date= 7 March 2020|website=朝日新聞|language=ja|access-date= 28 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO55906320R20C20A2AM1000/|title=豪乗客2人が帰国後陽性 陰性のクルーズ客、下船終了へ|date= 21 February 2020|website=日本経済新聞|language=ja|access-date= 28 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://bungeishunju.com/n/n49b0c5bedd39|title=ルポ 豪華客船「船内隔離」14日間の真実|date= 10 March 2020|website=文藝春秋digital|language=ja|access-date= 28 May 2020}}</ref>
