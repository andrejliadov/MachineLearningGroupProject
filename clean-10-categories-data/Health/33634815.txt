The '''winter-over syndrome''' is a condition that occurs in individuals who "winter-over" throughout the [[Polar night|Antarctic (or Arctic) winter]], which can last seven to eight months.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Oliver|first=Donna|date=1979|title=Some Psychological Effects Of Isolation and Confinement In An Antarctic Winter-over Group|journal=Dissertation|id={{ProQuest|302983797}}}}</ref> It has been observed in inhabitants of [[research stations in Antarctica]], as well as in [[polar base]]s such as [[Thule Research Station|Thule]], [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]] and [[Eureka, Nunavut|Eureka]]. It consists of a variety of behavioral and medical disturbances, including [[irritability]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[insomnia]], [[absentmindedness]], aggressive behavior, and [[irritable bowel syndrome]].<ref name="onthice">{{cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/bec/papers/Palinkas_On_The_Ice.pdf |title=On the ice: Individual and group adaptation in Antarctica |author=Palinkas LA |access-date=2011-11-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623024832/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/bec/papers/Palinkas_On_The_Ice.pdf |archive-date=2012-06-23 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=PALINKAS|first1=LAWRENCE A|title=Association between the Polar T3 Syndrome and the Winter-Over Syndrome in Antarctica|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1999/nsf98106/98106htm/nsf98106h2.html|website=NSF.org|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref>

== Contributing factors ==
The Antarctic winter is a period of no physical contact with other continents or Antarctic stations, including no airplanes, ships, or mail. The area has the driest desert climate on Earth, and a low air pressure and oxygen-poor atmosphere. It is completely cut off during winter, the mean temperature is {{cvt|-51|C}}, and the lowest recorded temperature is {{cvt|-85|C}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.niwa.co.nz/education-and-training/schools/resources/climate/antarctic|title=How cold is the Antarctic?|date=2007-02-28|website=NIWA|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref> For these reasons, the immobility, monotony, harsh physical environment, sexual deprivation, and the general isolation, are believed to contribute to increased anxiety and depression among the residents of the station.<ref name=":0" />

Several studies have been done over the years to determine the contributing causes, or stresses, of "winter-over" syndrome. These include [[Stress (biology)|stress]], [[social isolation]], [[subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder]] and [[polar T3 syndrome|polar T<sub>3</sub> syndrome]].<ref name="palinkas1997">{{cite web|title=Association between the Polar T<sub>3</sub> Syndrome and the Winter-Over Syndrome in Antarctica|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1999/nsf98106/98106htm/nsf98106h2.html|vauthors=Palinkas LA, Reed HL, Do NV |publisher=Antarctic Journal of the United States Review 1997|year=1997|access-date=2011-11-04}}</ref><ref name="onthice" /> It would appear that the cold, danger, and hardships are not major stresses. The most important psychological stresses appear to be: the problem of individual adjustment to the group, the relative monotony of the environment, and the absence of certain accustomed sources of emotional satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mullin|first=Captain Charles|date=October 1960|title=Some Psychological Aspects of Isolated Antarctic Living|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=117|issue=4|pages=323–325|doi=10.1176/ajp.117.4.323|pmid=13726749}}</ref> In addition to isolation from the outside world, there is confinement or lack of isolation within the research stations themselves. During fieldwork conducted at [[McMurdo Station|McMurdo]] and [[South pole base|South Pole]] stations in 1988 and 1989, informants complained that the lack of privacy and constant gossip that existed within the community, had a negative influence on social relationships, especially between men and women. As a result, 60% of one's leisure time is spent alone in a [[Dormitory|dorm room]], whereas others are forced to work and live in confined spaces, due to the nature of their work.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palinkas|first=Lawrence|date=1992|title=Going to Extremes: The Cultural Context of Stress, Illness, and Coping In Antarctica|journal=Social Science and Medicine|volume=35|issue=5|pages=651–664|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(92)90004-A|pmid=1439916}}</ref>

==Symptoms==
While research around the winter-over syndrome dates back to the 1950s, there is no set of exclusive indicators that can typically reveal a diagnosis of the same. "Our analyses of the human experience in Antarctica suggest that there are few, if any, traits that serve as useful predictors of performance during the austral winter," Palinkas wrote in a paper called "The Psychology of Antarctic Research." Some of the symptoms included [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[insomnia]], anger or irritability, feelings of [[hostility]] towards those around you, diminished cognitive performance including difficulty in concentration and memory, absentmindedness, and the occurrence of mild [[hypnotic state]]s known as 'long-eye' or the 'Antarctic stare'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cravalho|first=Mark Andrew|date=December 1996|title=Toast on Ice: The Ethnopsychology of the Winter-over Experience in Antarctica|journal=Ethos|volume=24|issue=4|pages=628–656|doi=10.1525/eth.1996.24.4.02a00030|issn=0091-2131}}</ref>

Bill Spindler, documenting his extensive research on the [[Antarctic]], attributes the effects of sensory deprivation, isolation, and maybe even the effect of [[extreme cold]] on the [[Thyroid|thyroid gland]] which can cause [[Amnesia|memory loss]], sleepiness or sluggishness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.southpolestation.com/|title=Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station (Bill Spindler's Antarctica)|website=www.southpolestation.com|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref>
