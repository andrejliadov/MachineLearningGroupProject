'''Administrative controls''' are training, procedure, policy, or shift designs that lessen the threat of a hazard to an individual.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2009-125/pdfs/2009-125.pdf|title=Approaches to Safe Nanotechnology|date=March 2009|website=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|access-date=15 March 2017}}</ref> Administrative controls typically change the behavior of people (e.g., factory workers) rather than removing the actual hazard or providing [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE).

Administrative controls are fourth in larger [[hierarchy of hazard controls]], which ranks the effectiveness and efficiency of hazard controls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/|title=Hierarchy of Controls|date=July 2016|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=CDC|language=en-us|access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref> Administrative controls are more effective than PPE because they involve some manner of prior planning and avoidance, whereas PPE only serves only as a final barrier between the hazard and worker. Administrative controls are second lowest because they require workers or employers to actively think or comply with regulations and do not offer permanent solutions to problems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dte/grant_materials/fy10/sh-20839-10/hierarchy_of_controls.pdf|title=Hierarchy of Controls|website=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|access-date=16 March 2017}}</ref> Generally, administrative controls are cheaper to begin, but they may become more expensive over time as higher failure rates and the need for constant training or re-certification eclipse the initial investments of the three more desirable hazard controls in the hierarchy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-102/|title=Nanomaterial Production and Downstream Handling Processes|date=November 2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref> The U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] recommends administrative controls when hazards cannot be [[Hazard elimination|removed]] or [[Hazard substitution|changed]], and [[engineering controls]] are not practical.<ref name=":0" />

Some common examples of administrative controls include work practice controls such as prohibiting mouth [[pipette|pipetting]] and recapping of needles, as well as rotating [[Shift work|worker shifts]] in coal mines to prevent hearing loss.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2017-100/pdf/2017-100.pdf|title=NIOSH Chemical Carcinogen Policy|date=December 2016|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dllr.state.md.us/labor/bbp/bbpwpcon.shtml|title=Guidelines and Instructions for Developing a Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan|date=March 2010|website=[[Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation]]|access-date=15 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/s&hinfo/noisetoolboxes/Administrative%20Controls.ppt|title=Administrative Controls|website=U.S. [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]]|access-date=14 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2a.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/BuildQyr.asp?s1=20030605&PageNo=1&RecNo=1&View=f&|title=Administrative controls for reducing worker noise exposures|last=Bauer|first=ER|last2=Babich}}</ref> Other examples include [[hours of service]] regulations for commercial vehicle operators,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/administrativecontrols.html|title=Administrative Controls|date=25 July 2016|website=Interactive Learning Paradigms Incorporated|access-date=15 March 2017}}</ref> [[Safety sign|Safety signage]] for hazards,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ehs.iu.edu/docs/LCSP-Part-06---2.0-Control-Measures.pdf|title=Control Measures|website=Environmental Health and Safety â€“ Bloomington [[Indiana University]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215075131/http://ehs.iu.edu/docs/LCSP-Part-06---2.0-Control-Measures.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-15|url-status=dead|access-date=16 March 2017}}</ref> and regular maintenance of equipment. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/hsprograms/hazard_control.html|title=Hazard Control|date=17 March 2017|website=[[Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety]]|access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref>
