It was released on [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices in June 2018 and on [[Microsoft Windows]] in November 2018, featuring [[cross-platform play]] between these platforms.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About|url=http://www.innersloth.com/About.php|access-date=2020-11-26|website=www.innersloth.com}}</ref> 

The game takes place in a [[Science fiction|space-themed]] setting, in which players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors.{{Efn|Although the term used by the game is "Impostor", "Imposter" is also a correct term.}} The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostors' goal is to covertly sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks. Players suspected to be Impostors may be eliminated via a [[plurality vote]], which any player may initiate by calling an emergency meeting (except during a crisis) or reporting a dead body. Crewmates win if all Impostors are eliminated or all tasks are completed whereas Impostors win if there is an equal number of Impostors and Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage goes unresolved.

While initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received an influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] [[Video game live streaming|streamers]] and [[YouTuber|YouTubers]] playing it. In response to the game's popularity, ''Among Us 2'' was announced in August 2020. However, the planned sequel was canceled a month later and the team shifted their focus to improving the original game, with a release on the [[Nintendo Switch]] in December 2020 and planned releases for the [[Xbox One]] and [[Xbox Series X and Series S]] in 2021. ''Among Us'' has inspired [[internet meme]]s and achieved a large following online.

''Among Us'' is a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer game]] for four to ten players. One to three players (depending on what the host selected) are chosen to be the impostor(s) each round. A game can take place on one of three [[Level (video games)|maps]]: a spaceship called "The Skeld"'','' a headquarters building called "MIRA HQ"'','' or a planet base called "Polus".<ref name=":3"/><ref name=":6"/>

At the start of the game, Crewmates are given "tasks" to complete around the map in the form of [[Minigame|minigames]], consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as electrical rewiring and engine refueling. Impostors are given a fake list of tasks to blend in with Crewmates, although they are unable to actually complete any task. Impostors can sabotage vital systems, covertly travel through air vents, and work with other Impostors to kill Crewmates. If a player dies, they become a ghost. Ghosts can pass through walls, are invisible to everyone except other ghosts, and are limited in their capacity to interact with the world; however, dead Crewmates must still complete their tasks. If an Impostor dies from being voted off, they can still sabotage to help the other Impostor(s).<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> All players except ghosts<ref>{{Cite web|last=Paez|first=Danny|title=3 'Among Us' ghost tips to help your team win from beyond the grave|url=https://www.inverse.com/gaming/among-us-ghost-tips-how-to-win-crewmate-imposter-ejection|access-date=2020-09-16|website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|language=en|archive-date=September 21, 2020|date=September 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921123215/https://www.inverse.com/gaming/among-us-ghost-tips-how-to-win-crewmate-imposter-ejection|url-status=live}}</ref> have a [[Fog of war#In video games|limited cone of vision]], only allowing them to see other players within a certain unblocked distance around them.<ref name=":5" />

The Crewmates win by completing all tasks, or by identifying and eliminating all Impostors. The Impostors win when the number of Impostors is equal to the number of Crewmates, or when a sabotage [[countdown]] reaches zero. Ghosts help their living teammates by completing tasks (as a Crewmate) or performing sabotages (as an Impostor). When an Impostor performs a sabotage, either there is an immediate consequence (such as all the lights being turned off) or a countdown begins. In the latter case, if the sabotage is not resolved before the countdown finishes, the Impostors win. Sabotages can be resolved by living players in varying ways depending on which sabotage is performed.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Games can also end by players quitting the match if doing so fulfills any win condition; a player quitting is equivalent to them being eliminated, and a Crewmate quitting leads to their tasks being considered completed for the total.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Duckworth|first=Joshua|date=2020-10-08|title=Among Us: 5 Quality of Life Improvements The Game Needs|url=https://gamerant.com/among-us-5-imposter-ghosts-penalties-cheating-quality-life-improvements/|access-date=2020-10-18|website=Game Rant|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Mc|first=Chris|date=2020-10-02|title=How to Find the Impostor in Among Us|url=https://www.gamespew.com/2020/10/eighteen-tips-for-beating-the-impostor-in-among-us/|access-date=2020-10-18|website=GameSpew|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Development and release==
===Early development===
''Among Us'' was inspired by the live party game [[Mafia (party game)|Mafia]],<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":16"/> and was initially intended to be a mobile-only [[local multiplayer]] game with a single map.<ref name="improb" /> Originally, the game had no audio to avoid revealing hidden information in a local setting.{{Efn|For example, the sound of an Impostor killing a Crewmate could reveal to other Crewmates who the Impostor was.|name=|group=}}<ref name="newgroundspod" /> Designer Marcus Bromander paused development on Innersloth's other game, ''The Henry Stickmin Collection'', in order to build ''Among Us''<nowiki/>' first map, The Skeld.<ref name="newgroundspod" /> The game was released in June 2018 to [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] under the AppID of "spacemafia".<ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Among Us - Apps on Google Play|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innersloth.spacemafia&hl=en_US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921123231/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.innersloth.spacemafia&hl=en_US|archive-date=September 21, 2020|access-date=2020-09-13|website=[[Google Play]]|language=en}}</ref> Shortly after release, ''Among Us'' had an average player count of 30 to 50 concurrent players.<ref name=":4"/> Bromander blamed the game's poor release on Innersloth being "really bad at marketing".<ref name="improb" /> The team nearly abandoned the project multiple times, but continued work on it due to a "small but vocal player base",<ref name=":14"/> adding in online multiplayer, new tasks, and customization options.<ref name=":14" /> The game was released on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] on November 16, 2018.<ref name="improb" /><ref name="outofbeta"/> [[Cross-platform play]] was supported upon release of the Steam version.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Power|first=Tom|date=2020-09-16|title=Is there crossplay in Among Us?|url=https://www.gamepur.com/guides/is-there-crossplay-in-among-us|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200924153020/https://www.gamepur.com/guides/is-there-crossplay-in-among-us|archive-date=September 24, 2020|access-date=2020-09-21|website=Gamepur|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Matthews|first=Emma|date=2020-09-10|title=How crossplay works in Among Us|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/among-us-crossplay-pc-and-mobile/|access-date=2020-09-15|website=[[PC Gamer]]|language=en-US|archive-date=September 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921123342/https://www.pcgamer.com/among-us-crossplay-pc-and-mobile/|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to programmer Forest Willard, the team "stuck with [the game] a lot longer than we probably should have from a pure business standpoint", putting out regular updates to the game as often as once per week. This led to a steady increase in players, [[Snowball effect|snowballing]] the game's player base. Bromander attributed this to the studio having enough savings to keep working on the game even while it was not selling particularly well.<ref name="improb" />

===October 2020 hacks===
In mid-October 2020, a hacker known as "Eris Loris" began targeting mainly North American servers. Several players on the ''Among Us'' [[Reddit#Subreddits|subreddit]] and [[Twitter]] reported this player hacking their lobbies and [[spamming]] in-game chat with promotions for his YouTube channel, links to his Discord server, and controversial political messages.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mukherjee|first=Arnab|date=2020-10-24|title=Among Us Hacker: Who is Eris Loris & how to respond to his Among Us hack /spam attack - guide|url=https://thesportsrush.com/among-us-hacker-who-is-eris-loris-how-to-respond-to-his-among-us-hack-spam-attack-guide/|access-date=2020-10-25|website=The SportsRush|language=en-US}}</ref> Eris Loris also threatened to personally hack players that refused to subscribe to his YouTube channel. The Discord server has been found to contain large amounts of [[NSFW]] content such as racist language, gore, pornography and images depicting animal abuse.<ref name=":22">{{Cite web|last=Emma|first=Kent|date=October 23, 2020|title=Among Us is dealing with a huge spam attack|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-23-among-us-is-dealing-with-a-huge-spam-attack|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201024215004/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-10-23-among-us-is-dealing-with-a-huge-spam-attack|archive-date=October 24, 2020|access-date=October 24, 2020|website=[[Eurogamer]]|language=en-Us}}</ref>

A ''Eurogamer'' report form October 23, 2020 features an interview with the person claiming to be Eris Loris, conducted via the Discord server from one of the links provided in the hacked games. In the interview, Loris claims he created the bot responsible for the hacks "in only six hours", and had enlisted up to 50 volunteers to form a [[botnet]] which boosted the strength of their attacks. Loris claimed that the hack impacted 4.9 million players in 1.5 million games. He also added that the hacks were part of a publicity stunt to influence players to vote for [[Donald Trump]] in the presidential election.<ref name=":22" />

Then their fans started playing too.|first=Taylor|last= Lorenz|quote=When an indie game company created ''Among Us'' in 2018, it was greeted with little fanfare. The multiplayer game remained under the radar as many games do — until the summer of the pandemic. Eager to keep viewers entertained during quarantine, Chance Morris, known online as Sodapoppin, began streaming the game, created by InnerSloth, to his 2.8 million followers on Twitch in July. By mid-September, ''Among Us'' caught on like wildfire. Suddenly major YouTube stars, TikTok influencers, and streamers were playing it. PewDiePie, James Charles, and Dr. Lupo have all played the game for millions.}}
