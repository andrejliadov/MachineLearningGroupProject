'''[[Frédéric Chopin]]'s disease''' and the reason for his premature death at age 39 were frequently debated for over 150 years.  Although he was diagnosed with and treated for [[tuberculosis]] throughout his lifetime, a number of alternative diagnoses have been suggested since his death in 1849. A comprehensive review of the possible causes of Chopin's illness was published in 2011.<ref>Lagerberg, Steven.

From childhood, Frédéric Chopin was sickly and under medical care. He showed intolerance to fatty foods, especially pork &ndash; these caused [[stomach ache]]s, [[diarrhea]] and weight loss. Later he endeavored to avoid such symptoms with diet; he obtained substantial improvement with ingredients such as [[honey]] and [[oat bran]]. Chopin attained a height of {{convert|170|cm|ftin}} — the 25th [[percentile]]; and as an adult weighed under {{convert|45|kg|lb}} — below the 3rd percentile.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Shea JG |title=Was Frédéric Chopin's illness actually cystic fibrosis? |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=147 |issue=11-12 |pages=586–9 |year=1987 |pmid=3320707 }}</ref>

Chopin is known to have had no [[facial hair]] at the age of 22; as he wrote in the winter of 1832, he grew [[sideburns]] on only one side of his face.<ref name="a">{{Cite journal|last1=Kuzemko |first1=JA |title=Chopin's illnesses |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=87 |issue=12 |pages=769–72 |year=1994 |pmid=7853308 |pmc=1294992}}</ref> In 1826 he was sick for six months, suffering from enlarged [[cervical lymph nodes]] and severe [[headache]]s. In 1830, a chronic cold caused nasal [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] which prompted him to cancel planned concerts in Vienna.

In 1831, while in Paris, the 21-year-old Chopin had his first episode of [[hemoptysis]] (coughing up of blood). In 1835, he suffered a severe two-month bout of [[laryngitis]] and [[bronchitis]], and the resulting interruption in his correspondence with Warsaw gave rise to gossip that he had died.<ref>John O'Shea: Music & Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers. London: Dent, 1990, p. 144. {{ISBN|0-460-86106-9}}</ref>

In his early youth, he treated himself with [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]. In the final decade of his life, he treated the coughing fits from which he had suffered his entire life with a blend of sugar and [[opium]]. Chopin coughed up an abundant amount of [[mucus]], particularly around 10 a.m.<ref>John O'Shea: Music & Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers. London: Dent, 1990, p. 143. {{ISBN|0-460-86106-9}}</ref> He occasionally drank alcohol, sometimes smoked and &ndash; as some authors noted &ndash; suffered the consequences of inhaling others' smoke while enjoying the company of his Parisian friends.<ref name="a" /> In the last year of his life, he endured diarrheas, caused either by [[cor pulmonale]] or by [[exocrine pancreatic insufficiency]] (see below).

On 17 October 1849, at 2 a.m., after a sudden coughing fit, Chopin died at the age of 39. His physician, [[Jean Cruveilhier]], confirmed his death by holding a mirror to Chopin's mouth and by illuminating his pupils with light from a candle. Pursuant to Chopin's will, Dr. Cruveilhier, a renowned professor of [[pathology]], carried out an [[autopsy]]. The postmortem findings were also communicated to Chopin's sister [[Ludwika Jędrzejewicz|Ludwika]], [[Adolphe Gutmann]] and [[Jane Stirling]]. The postmortem report was destroyed either in the Paris fire of 1871 or during World War II. The [[death certificate]] stated the cause of Chopin's death as tuberculosis of the lungs and larynx. However, [[Wojciech Grzymała]], in a letter to [[:de:Auguste_Léo|Auguste Leo]] dated October 1849, wrote that the autopsy had not confirmed tubercular pulmonary changes and that his actual disease was unknown to contemporary medicine.<ref>John O'Shea: Music & Medicine: Medical Profiles of Great Composers. London: Dent, 1990, p. 149. {{ISBN|0-460-86106-9}}</ref>

==Physicians==
It is uncertain how many physicians Chopin had; various authors have given the number as 14,<ref>K. Barry, "Chopin and His Fourteen Doctors", Sydney Austral. Med. Publish. Co., 1934, cited from Sielużycki, 1976.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> 31<ref name="sieluzycki">{{cite journal | author = Sielużycki C | year = 1976 | title = Lekarze Chopina | journal = Archiwum Historii Medycyny | volume = 39 | issue = 3| pages = 305–32 }}</ref> or "nearly 50".<ref>E. Stocki (1956), ''"Zapomniani lekarze-przyjaciele Fryderyka Chopina"'', ''Polski Tygodnik Lekarski'', 24, pp. 1102-4 (1956). Cited from Sielużycki, 1976.</ref> In addition, the composer had friendly relations with other physicians, who may also have occasionally provided him with assistance.<ref name="sieluzycki" />

In [[Warsaw]], Chopin's physicians were Jan Fryderyk Wilhelm Malcz, Franciszek Girardot and Fryderyk Adolf Roemer. In [[Vienna]], Chopin was provided medical care by Johann Malfatti. Chopin's physicians in [[Paris]] included Aleksander Hofman, Jean-Jacques Molin, André François Cauviere, [[Jan Matuszyński]], Adam Raciborski, Pierre Gaubert, Gustave Papet and Coste. During his 1848 stay in [[London]] &ndash; Mallan and James Clark. In Paris, in 1848–49, he was treated by Léon Simon, Fraenkel, David Koreff, Louis and Roth.<ref name="a" /> Chopin's last physician was [[Jean Cruveilhier]].

==Family history==
Little is known about the health of Frédéric's father, [[Nicolas Chopin]], who lived to the age of 73 and suffered several times from [[respiratory infection]]s. The composer's mother had no chronic illness and reached the age of 79.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Of Frédéric's three sisters, Izabela died at age 70 and had no illnesses; [[Ludwika Jędrzejewicz|Ludwika]] suffered from recurrent respiratory infections and died at 47; the youngest, [[Emilia Chopin|Emilia]], was of frail health from earliest childhood. Emilia suffered from recurrent coughs and [[dyspnea]]; at 11 she began having [[hemorrhage]]s from the [[upper gastrointestinal tract]], and she died of a massive hemorrhage at 14.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Tuberculosis==
Chopin was diagnosed with tuberculosis and treated for it in accordance with contemporary practice, including [[bloodletting]] and [[Colon cleansing|purging]]. Tuberculosis was listed on his death certificate, despite the alleged absence of typical organ changes. Critics of  alternative hypotheses about Chopin's disease point out the abundant evidence for tuberculosis.<ref name=pmid9726766>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cheng TO |title=Chopin's illness |journal=Chest |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=654–5 |year=1998 |pmid=9726766 |doi=10.1378/chest.114.2.654-a }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1378/chest.114.2.655 |last1=Margolis |first1=ML |title=The long suffering of Frederic Chopin, revisited |journal=Chest |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=655 |year=1998 |pmid=9726767}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carter ER |title=Chopin's malady |journal=Chest |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=655–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9726768 |doi=10.1378/chest.114.2.655-a }}</ref> Chronic coughs and hemoptysis are common symptoms of tuberculosis; complications may include both [[pericarditis]], causing right-heart insufficiency, and [[bronchiectasis]], manifesting in productive cough and respiratory failure.

A 20-year history of [[hemoptysis]] is rare in tuberculosis but not impossible.  Similarly, cavernous tuberculosis is rare in childhood, but it cannot be excluded in the case of Emilia Chopin. Frédéric could have contracted tuberculosis from his younger sister.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=John M. |last1=O'Shea |title=Music & medicine: medical profiles of great composers |publisher=Dent |location=London |year=1990 |pages=142–3 |isbn=0-460-86106-9}}</ref>

A monograph on historic methods of treating tuberculosis has discussed individual treatments on the example of Chopin, since his history well illustrates views on treating tuberculosis in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{Cite book|first1=Esmond R. |last1=Long |year=1956 |title=A History of the Therapy of Tuberculosis and the Case of Frederic Chopin |publisher=[[University Press of Kansas]] |location=[[Lawrence, Kansas]] |oclc=14617261}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>

==Autopsy and results==
Attempts were made to gain permission to extract a small amount of tissue from Chopin's heart in order to test it for a range of specific conditions.  Dr. Michael Witt of Warsaw's Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology made such a request in 2008, but permission was denied by the Polish government.<ref>Robin McKie, "Row over plan to DNA test Chopin's heart". [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/27/classicalmusicandopera.genetics ''The Guardian'', 27 July 2008]. Retrieved 3 November 2014</ref> In 2017, a visual inspection was at last performed on Chopin's alcohol-preserved heart, under the direction of Professor Witt of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]. The heart remained in alcohol, and the container was not opened, so it could not be touched or sampled. Closer inspection suggested that a rare case of [[pericarditis]], caused by complications from chronic [[tuberculosis]], was the likely cause of Chopin's death.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McKie|first1=Robin|title=Examination of Chopin’s pickled heart solves riddle of his early death|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/05/frederic-chopin-pickled-heart-solves-riddle-of-early-death|website=The Guardian|access-date=5 November 2017|date=4 November 2017}}</ref>

== Other hypotheses==
[[File:Cast of Chopin's hand.JPG|thumb|upright|Cast of Chopin's left hand]]

A number of alternative hypotheses about the cause of Chopin's death flourished over the years.

The hypothesis that Chopin suffered from [[cystic fibrosis]] was first presented by O’Shea in 1987.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=O'Shea |first1=JG |title=Was Frédéric Chopin's illness actually cystic fibrosis? |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |volume=147 |issue=11-12 |pages=586–9 |year=1987 |pmid=3320707}}</ref> Chopin possibly was sexually active from early adulthood, but left no descendants. Some authors considered this evidence for [[infertility]], which favoured the [[cystic fibrosis]] hypothesis.<ref name="majka">{{Cite journal|last1=Majka |first1=L |last2=Goździk |first2=J |last3=Witt |first3=M |title=Cystic fibrosis--a probable cause of Frédéric Chopin's suffering and death |journal=Journal of applied genetics |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=77–84 |year=2003 |pmid=12590184}}</ref>

A hypothesis of [[alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]] was proposed by Kuzemko in 1994.<ref name="a" />

[[Mitral stenosis]] was a possible, if unlikely, cause for the artist's complaints and was discussed by Kubba and Young in 1998.<ref name="kubba">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1378/chest.113.1.210 |last1=Kubba |first1=AK |last2=Young |first2=M |title=The long suffering of Frederic Chopin |journal=Chest |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=210–6 |year=1998 |pmid=9440592}}</ref> The most important argument against this hypothesis is the absence of evidence that Chopin suffered from [[rheumatic fever]] in childhood, which is the most common cause of [[mitral valve stenosis]].

Kubba and Young pointed out a number of other conceivable, if unlikely, diagnoses, besides cystic fibrosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency: [[eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]], [[hypogammaglobulinemia]], [[idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis]], [[lung abscess]]es, and [[pulmonary]] [[arteriovenous malformation]]s.<ref name="kubba" />

==Mental health==
Chopin's biographers have often touched on the subject of depression, but the topic has rarely been broached by psychiatrists. One of the few studies of Chopin's mental condition is a 1920 work by [[Bronislaw Onuf-Onufrowicz]]. The author cited biographers concerning Chopin's character and psyche and pointed out some symptoms that might indicate a [[manic-depressive disorder]] or [[dementia praecox]] (now termed [[schizophrenia]]), but he emphasized the absence of evidence for severe [[psychosis]] and the fact that single symptoms may only suggest a predisposition to such mental illnesses.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1=Bronislaw |last1=Onuf-Onufrowicz |author-link1=Bronislaw Onuf-Onufrowicz |year=1920 |title=Frederick Chopin’s Mental Makeup |journal=Dementia Praecox Studies |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=199–204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4tXAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA199}}</ref>
