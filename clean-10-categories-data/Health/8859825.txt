'''Blue Zones''' are regions of the world where, it is claimed, a higher than usual number people live much longer than average. The term first appeared in his November 2005 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine cover story, "The Secrets of a Long Life".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0511/feature1/|title=Longevity, The Secrets of Long Life|date=November 2005|work=National Geographic Magazine|access-date=2017-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530005432/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0511/feature1/|archive-date=2017-05-30|url-status=live}}</ref> Five "Blue Zones" have been posited: [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] ([[Japan]]); [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]); [[Nicoya Peninsula|Nicoya]] ([[Costa Rica]]); [[Icaria]] ([[Greece]]); and among the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] in [[Loma Linda, California]], based on evidence showing why these populations live healthier and longer lives than others.<ref>{{cite news |title=This Adventurer Discovered The Secrets To Long Life — And It Could Save Iowa $16 Billion By 2016 |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/dan-buettner-blue-zone-iowa-2012-8 |accessdate=5 November 2018 |work=Business Insider |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327085909/https://www.businessinsider.com/dan-buettner-blue-zone-iowa-2012-8 |archive-date=27 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

As the two men zeroed in on the cluster of villages with the highest longevity, they drew concentric blue circles on the map and began referring to the area inside the circle as the "Blue Zone". Together with demographers Pes and [[Michel Poulain|Poulain]], Buettner broadened the term, applying it to validated longevity areas of Okinawa, Japan and among the Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda, California.  Buettner and [[Michel Poulain|Poulain]], under the aegis of National Geographic, then identified and validated longevity hotspots in Nicoya, Costa Rica and Icaria, Greece. Buettner mentions in his book that people are doing the right things for long enough, and avoiding the wrong things," there are four main things that people in those zones do in order to live healthier and longer lives, and they consist of moving regularly, which does not consist of exercise alone, but doing daily energy burst habits throughout the day. The second aspect is living with purpose, having a reason to get up every day, and living with perspective. The third aspect of blue zone populations is the social support they receive from friends and family allowing them to move through life outcomes more smoothly. Fourth but not least is the concept that most still do not understand, which is making the "healthy choice the easy choice", and not just an option. Living by these four concepts brings longevity and mental and physical problems to one's life and society.

==Characteristics==
[[File:3 blue zones venn diagram.svg|thumb|450px|A [[Venn diagram]] of longevity clues from Okinawa, Sardinia, and Loma Linda.]]

The people inhabiting Blue Zones share common lifestyle characteristics that contribute to their longevity. The [[Venn diagram]] highlights the following six shared characteristics among the people of Okinawa, Sardinia, and Loma Linda Blue Zones:<ref name="Longevity Secrets">[http://www.bluezones.com/live-longer/power-9 Power 9™ » Blue Zones – Live Longer, Better] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229071522/http://www.bluezones.com/live-longer/power-9/|date=2011-12-29}}: "Blue Zones – Live Longer, Better", Quest Network, 2006.</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2019}}

In his book, Buettner provides a list of nine lessons, covering the lifestyle of people who reside in blue zones:<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Blue Zones, Second Edition: 9 Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fhJAn7fPkqAC|publisher = National Geographic Books|date = 2012-11-06|isbn = 9781426209499|first = Dan|last = Buettner|access-date = 2015-09-22|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160328194802/https://books.google.com/books?id=fhJAn7fPkqAC|archive-date = 2016-03-28|url-status = live}}</ref>

;Moderate, regular physical activity.
The health benefits of regular exercise and physical activity are countless, according to numerous researches regulating exercise and keeping a healthy diet is the number one thing to do in order to prevent most diseases such as cardiovascular problems, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes depression, anxiety, arthritis, obesity, and accidents. When people exercise their bodies release chemicals, known as neurotransmitters, that auxiliary and prevent pain and depression emotions, among the neurotransmitters released are endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine chemicals. Studies withing people of the Blue zones have shown that being physically active does not mean going to the gym everyday, what it means is being constantly moving and trying to exercise your body while doing daily tasks. 
;Life purpose.
Learning your sense of purpose, requires life-long learnings. People in the Blue Zones live meaningfully trying to be open to life success and failures as outcomes need to be met for the greater good and enriching life, Okinawans for example utilize the concept known as Ikigai  Japanese word for "a reason for being". <ref>{{cite web |last1=Gordon |first1=Mara |title=What's Your Purpose? Finding A Sense Of Meaning In Life Is Linked To Health |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/25/726695968/whats-your-purpose-finding-a-sense-of-meaning-in-life-is-linked-to-health#:~:text=Mitchell%2FGetty%20Images-,Having%20a%20purpose%20in%20life%2C%20whether%20building%20guitars%20or%20swimming,of%20death%20than%20exercising%20regularly.&text=Having%20a%20purpose%20in%20life%20may%20decrease%20your%20risk%20of,to%20a%20study%20published%20Friday. |website=NPR}}</ref>
;Stress reduction.
Stress affects everyone, the rule of thumb for those living in the blue zones is to learn on how to cope with stress, plus not all stress is bad, because the feeling itself can be good to prepare the body for threats and to be alert. Although it if stressful situations are overpowering your day to day basis this can disturb the bodies homeostatic system and cause serious health problems, such as high blood pressure, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and even in extreme cases irregulate the normal functioning of areas of the brain causing mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. <ref>{{cite web |title=5 Things You Should Know About Stress |url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/stress/index.shtml |website=National Institute of Mental Health}}</ref>
	Some ways to cope with stress is having social support groups in which you can confide and have regular visits to your health care providers, getting regular exercise, setting goals, and trying to relax and cope with difficult situations. <ref>{{cite web |title=Stress Management Stress symptoms: Effects on your body and behavior |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-symptoms/art-20050987 |website=Mayo Clinic}}</ref>
;Moderate caloric intake.
In order to maintain a strong and healthy body, one’s does not need to deprive themselves to a limited number of calories a day. According to the United States Government project called “My Plate,” the average caloric intake varies according to gender and physical fitness between 1,500-2,200 calories. <ref>{{cite web |title=Appendix 2. Estimated Calorie Needs per Day, by Age, Sex, and Physical Activity Level |url=https://health.gov/our-work/food-nutrition/2015-2020-dietary-guidelines/guidelines/appendix-2/#:~:text=Estimates%20range%20from%201%2C600%20to,range%20is%20for%20active%20individuals. |website=Government Dietary Guidelines}}</ref>
;Plant-based diet.
The countries located in the blue zones are mostly ingesting foods contained in the Mediterranean diet which consists mostly of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, seeds, and spices, and having meats sporadically and in their vast majority fishes and lean meat. <ref>{{cite web |title=What is the Mediterranean Diet? |url=https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/mediterranean-diet |website=American Heart Association}}</ref>
;Moderate alcohol intake, especially wine.
	According to researchers light to moderate consumption of alcohol-related products such as wine, champagne, beer and other alcoholic beverages, may provide a couple of benefits to the overall health, such as cardiovascular problems reductions, but being physically active and maintaining a healthy diet are shown to have greater health benefits in the long run. 
<ref>{{cite web |title=Alcohol use: Weighing risks and benefits |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/alcohol/art-20044551#:~:text=Moderate%20alcohol%20consumption%20may%20provide,reducing%20your%20risk%20of%20diabetes |website=Mayo CLinic}}</ref>
;Engagement in spirituality or religion.
Religiosity involvement spirituality is associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life. In other words, people that use their religion to cope learn that serving and thinking about others is what matters the most, which may be influenced by the next to topics<ref>{{cite web |title=The Role of Religious Coping Strategies in Predicting Depression among a Sample of Women with Fertility Problems in Shiraz |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842233/#:~:text=Religious%20coping%20refers%20to%20the,depression%20(12%E2%80%9314). |website=U.S National Library of Medicine}}</ref>
;Engagement in family life.
The areas that represent the Blue Zones, engage in social support and family-oriented practices since childhood, they learn that their choices and outcomes will have an impact not only on them but also on their families, therefore they want to grow together and share their lives successful and failures within their families.<ref>{{cite web |title=Blue Zones Power 9: Lifestyle Habits of the World’s Healthiest, Longest-Lived People |url=https://www.bluezones.com/2016/11/power-9/ |website=Blue Zones}}</ref>
;Engagement in social life.
Just like family, social ties affect our health according to studies human beings need different social relationship groups, in order to decrease stress, cardiovascular diseases, and disorders. Physical contact from simple actions such as holding hands to higher forms of contact such as sex can assist the body in releasing important chemicals such as hormones, that bring biological benefits on top of mental, emotional, and physical ones. 
	Tying the knot for example, although difficult can become the primary relationship in a subjects life. And the evidence is very strong that marriage is generally good for health,” says Dr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, an expert on health and relationships at Ohio State University. “But if a relationship isn’t going well, it could have significant health-related consequences.” 
Studies have found that those who are married are more likely to have greater cardiovascular health than single individuals, and research has also shown that when one of the partners engages in improving their health the other is likely to follow as well. <ref>{{cite web |title=The Role of Religious Coping Strategies in Predicting Depression among a Sample of Women with Fertility Problems in Shiraz |url=https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2017/02/do-social-ties-affect-our-health |website=New In Health}}</ref>
