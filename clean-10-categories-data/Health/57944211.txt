The '''Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre''' (abbreviated to '''KCE''') is an independent federal [[research institute]] in [[Belgium]] that provides multidisciplinary [[Science advice|scientific advice]] to relevant persons and authorities on topics related to [[Healthcare in Belgium|health care]]. More specifically, the KCE carries out research on the organisation and financing of the [[health system]] ([[health services research]]), assesses [[health technology|health technologies]] and [[Medication|drugs]] ([[health technology assessment]]), establishes [[Medical guideline|guidelines for clinical practice]] and updates them according to the latest [[scientific evidence]] ([[good clinical practice]]s), and establishes validated [[Research method|methods for research]] in the field of health care and [[public health]]. Aside from producing [[report|scientific reports]] on these topics, the KCE also maintains a [[clinical research]] programme in which it selects and funds [[non-commercial]] [[clinical trial]]s. Lastly, the KCE critically reviews, analyses and summarizes publications from foreign research institutes and [[Academic journal|peer reviewed journals]] that could be of interest to Belgian [[clinician]]s and authorities.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://annualreport.kce.be/2017/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/KCE-annual-report-2017.pdf|title=Annual report 2017|date=March 2018|website=annualreport.kce.be|publisher=Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre|format=pdf|issn=2565-6945|access-date=20 July 2018}}</ref>

== Organisation ==
The KCE is a so-called 'organism of public interest' ([[Public body|parastatal body]]) type B according to Belgian [[public law]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kce.fgov.be/en/missions-and-values|title=Missions and values|date=3 August 2017|website=kce.fgov.be|publisher=Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre|access-date=20 July 2018}}</ref> It was founded in 2003 and operates under the administrative authority of the federal [[Health minister|minister of Public Health]] of Belgium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kce.fgov.be/en/content/the-origin|title=Why a Belgian Healthcare Knowledge Centre?|date=14 September 2017|website=kce.fgov.be|publisher=Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre|access-date=20 July 2018}}</ref> Its annual budget is approximately 10,000,000 euros and originates for about 75% from the [[National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance]] (NIHDI) and for about 25% from the [[Federal Public Service Health (Belgium)|Federal Public Service Health]] and the [[Federal Public Service Social Security]]. Additionally, the KCE disposes over a budget of approximately 10,000,000 euros for its clinical trials programme which originates fully from the NIHDI. It also receives European [[Subsidy|subsidies]] for its participation in certain international projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kce.fgov.be/en/funding|title=Funding|date=13 February 2018|website=kce.fgov.be|publisher=Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre|access-date=20 July 2018}}</ref> As of 2017, it has an in-house research staff of about 45 researchers, including clinicians, [[Health economics|health economists]], [[Human science|human scientists]], [[Data analysis|data analysts]] and [[statistician]]s. The KCE can also rely on a network of external experts and institutions, such as [[List of universities in Belgium|universities]], to carry out studies and research through [[Government procurement|public tenders]] and provide external validation of its reports.<ref name=":0" />
