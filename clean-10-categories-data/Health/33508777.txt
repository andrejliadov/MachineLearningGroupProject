'''AIDS fatigue''' is a phenomenon wherein individuals or societies who had been concerned about the impact of [[HIV]] or [[AIDS]] become [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitized]] to having a strong emotional response to HIV issues after receiving continual messages about the danger over a long period of time.

==Causes==
[[Anthony Fauci]], director of the United States' [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) said that one of the causes of AIDS fatigue are huge successes in treatment which subsequently have made some people perceive the disease as less concerning.  Fauci noted that whereas in the 1980s in America "we had 30-40 percent of the hospital wards in inner-city hospitals occupied by people with advanced HIV disease, now because of the success of the therapies - which is great news - we don't have that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-11-30/health/aids.day.fauci_1_hiv-and-aids-new-infections-world-aids-day?_s=PM:HEALTH |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707200846/http://articles.cnn.com/2007-11-30/health/aids.day.fauci_1_hiv-and-aids-new-infections-world-aids-day?_s=PM:HEALTH |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 July 2012 |title=Fauci: Despite 'AIDS fatigue,' Americans should care |author=[[Anthony Fauci]] |work=cnn.com |date=30 November 2007 |access-date=23 October 2011 }}</ref>

The increase may also be because of new treatments.<ref name=HIVrising />
