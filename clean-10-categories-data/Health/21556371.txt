''Qigong'' practice typically involves moving meditation, coordinating slow-flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, and a calm meditative state of mind. People practice ''qigong'' throughout China and worldwide for recreation, exercise, relaxation, preventive medicine, self-healing, [[alternative medicine]], meditation, self-cultivation, and training for martial arts.<ref name=nccih16/>

==Etymology==
{{main|Qi|Chinese martial arts}}
''Qigong'' ([[Pinyin]]), ''ch'i kung'' ([[Wade-Giles]]), and ''chi gung'' ([[Yale romanization of Mandarin|Yale]]) are [[Romanization of Chinese|Romanized]] words for two Chinese characters: '''''qì''''' ('''{{linktext|lang=zh|气}}'''／'''{{linktext|lang=zh|氣}}''') and '''''gōng''''' ('''{{linktext|lang=zh|功}}''').

''[[Qi]]'' (or ''chi'') primarily means air, gas or breath but is often translated as a metaphysical concept of 'vital energy',<ref name=Cohen /> referring to a supposed energy circulating through the body; though a more general definition is universal energy, including heat, light, and electromagnetic energy;<ref name=YJM1>{{cite book|last= Yang |first= Jwing-Ming|year=1987|title= Chi Kung: health & martial arts |publisher= Yang's Martial Arts Association |isbn=978-0-940871-00-7}}</ref> and definitions often involve breath, air, gas, or the relationship between matter, energy, and spirit.<ref>{{cite book|last= Ho |first= Peng Yoke|date=Oct 2000 |title= Li, Qi, and Shu: An Introduction to Science and Civilization in China |publisher= Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-41445-4}}</ref> ''Qi'' is the central underlying principle in traditional Chinese [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]] and [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]]. ''Gong'' (or ''kung'') is often translated as cultivation or work, and definitions include practice, skill, mastery, merit, achievement, service, result, or accomplishment, and is often used to mean [[Kung fu (term)|gongfu]] (kung fu) in the traditional sense of achievement through great effort.<ref>[http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?wdqr=%E5%8A%9F MDBG dictionary entry for Gong]</ref> The two words are combined to describe systems to cultivate and balance life energy, especially for health and wellbeing.<ref name="Cohen"/>

The term ''qigong'' as currently used was promoted in the late 1940s through the 1950s to refer to a broad range of Chinese self-cultivation exercises, and to emphasize [[Traditional Chinese medicine|health]] and [[History of science and technology in China|scientific]] approaches, while de-emphasizing [[Chinese alchemy|spiritual practices]], [[mysticism]], and elite lineages.<ref name = Palmer>{{cite book | last= Palmer |first= David A. | year=2007|title= Qigong fever: body, science, and utopia in China | url= https://archive.org/details/qigongfeverbodys0000palm | url-access= registration | publisher= Columbia University Press | isbn=978-0-231-14066-9 }}</ref><ref name = yeyoung_qigong_origin /><ref name = Ownby>{{cite book | last1 = Ownby | first1 = David | title = Falun Gong and the future of China | url = https://archive.org/details/falungongfutureo2008ownb | url-access = registration | year = 2008 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-532905-6 }}</ref>

Starting in the late 1940s and the 1950s, the mainland Chinese government tried to integrate disparate ''qigong'' approaches into one coherent system, with the intention of establishing a firm scientific basis for ''qigong'' practice. In 1949, Liu Guizhen established the name "Qigong" to refer to the system of life preserving practices that he and his associates developed based on Dao yin and other philosophical traditions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Voigt|first=John|title=The Man Who Invented "Qigong"|journal=Qi: The Journal of Traditional Eastern Health & Fitness|date=Autumn 2013|volume=23|issue=3|pages=28–33 |url=http://www.qigonginstitute.org/html/papers/The%20Man%20Who%20Invented%20Qigong-1.pdf }}</ref> This attempt is considered by some [[Sinology|sinologists]] as the start of the modern or scientific interpretation of ''qigong''.<ref name=Otehode>{{Cite book |last =Otehode | first =Utiraruto  | chapter= The Creation and Reemergence of Qigong in China |editor-last = Ashiwa | editor-first = Yoshiko | editor2-last = Wank | editor2-first= David L. | title = Making religion, making the state: the politics of religion in modern China |url =https://archive.org/details/makingreligionma00ashi |url-access =limited | year = 2009 | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford, Calif.  | isbn = 978-0-8047-5842-0 | pages =[https://archive.org/details/makingreligionma00ashi/page/n251 241]–265 }}</ref><ref name = Despeux >{{cite book|last= Despeux |first=C. | year=1997|chapter= Le qigong, une expression de la modernité Chinoise |editor=J.

After the Cultural Revolution, ''qigong'', along with [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]], was popularized as daily morning exercise practiced en masse throughout China.

Popularity of ''qigong'' grew rapidly during the [[Deng Xiaoping|Deng]] and [[Jiang Zemin|Jiang]] eras after [[Mao Zedong|Mao Zedong's]] death in 1976 through the 1990s, with estimates of between 60 and 200 million practitioners throughout China.

Since the 1999 crackdown, ''qigong'' research and practice have only been officially supported in the context of health and traditional Chinese medicine. The Chinese Health Qigong Association, established in 2000, strictly regulates public ''qigong'' practice, with limitation of public gatherings, requirement of state approved training and certification of instructors, and restriction of practice to state-approved forms.<ref name= Karchmer >{{Cite book |last = Karchmer | first = Eric | chapter= Magic, Science and Qigong in Contemporary China |editor-last = Blum | editor-first = Susan Debra | editor2-last = Jensen | editor2-first= Lionel M | title = China off center: mapping the margins of the middle kingdom |url = https://archive.org/details/chinaoffcenterma00blum |url-access = limited | year = 2002 | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | isbn = 978-0-8248-2577-5 | pages =[https://archive.org/details/chinaoffcenterma00blum/page/n334 311]–22 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Scheid | first1 = Volker | title = Chinese medicine in contemporary China: plurality and synthesis | year = 2002 | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham, NC | isbn = 978-0-8223-2872-8 }}</ref>

Through the forces of migration of the [[Chinese diaspora]], [[tourism in China]], and [[globalization]], the practice of ''qigong'' spread from the Chinese community to the world. Today, millions of people around the world practice ''qigong'' and believe in the benefits of ''qigong'' to varying degrees. Similar to its historical origin, those interested in qigong come from diverse backgrounds and practice it for different reasons, including for [[recreation]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]], [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[preventive medicine]], [[self-healing]], [[alternative medicine]], [[Higher self|self-cultivation]], [[meditation]], [[spirituality]], and [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts training]].

==Overview==
===Practices===
''Qigong'' comprises a diverse set of practices that coordinate body ({{lang|zh|調身}}), breath ({{lang|zh|調息}}), and mind ({{lang|zh|調心}}) based on Chinese philosophy.<ref name="A Standard Guide on Qigong 气功标准教程">{{Cite book  | last1 = Yang | first1 = Bai Long {{lang|zh|杨柏龙}} | trans-title = A Standard Guide on Qigong |script-title=zh:气功标准教程 | year =2006 | publisher = Beijing Sport University Press {{lang|zh|北京体育大学出版社}} | isbn = 9787811005400 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Lam Kam-Chuen | first1 = Master | last2 = Lam | first2 = Kam Chuen | title = The way of energy: mastering the Chinese art of internal strength with chi kung exercise | year = 1991 | publisher = Simon Schuster | location = New York  | isbn = 978-0-671-73645-3 }}</ref> Practices include moving and still meditation, massage, chanting, sound meditation, and non-contact treatments, performed in a broad array of body postures. ''Qigong'' is commonly classified into two foundational categories: 1) dynamic or active ''qigong'' (''dong gong''), with slow flowing movement; and 2) meditative or passive ''qigong'' (''jing gong''), with still positions and inner movement of the breath.<ref name=Micozzi2010/>{{rp|21770–21772}} From a therapeutic perspective, ''qigong'' can be classified into two systems:
1) internal ''qigong'', which focuses on self-care and self-cultivation, and;
2) external ''qigong'', which involves treatment by a therapist who directs or transmits ''qi''.<ref name=Micozzi2010/>{{rp|21777–21781}}

As moving meditation, ''qigong'' practice typically coordinates slow stylized movement, deep diaphragmatic breathing, and calm mental focus, with visualization of guiding ''qi'' through the body. While implementation details vary, generally ''qigong'' forms can be characterized as a mix of four types of practice: dynamic, static, meditative, and activities requiring external aids.

* Dynamic practice
: involves fluid movement, usually carefully choreographed, coordinated with breath and awareness. Examples include the slow stylized movements of [[T'ai chi ch'uan]], [[Baguazhang]], and [[Xing Yi Quan]].<ref name = yang_taiji>{{Cite book  | last1 = Yang | first1 = Jwing-Ming | title = The Essence of Taiji Qigong, Second Edition : The Internal Foundation of Taijiquan (Martial Arts-Qigong) | year =1998  | publisher = YMAA Publication Center | isbn = 978-1-886969-63-6 }}</ref> Other examples include graceful movement that mimics the motion of animals in Five Animals ([[Wu Qin Xi|Wu Qin Xi qigong]]),<ref name=five_animals1>{{Cite book  | last1 = Fick | first1 = Franklin | title = Five Animal Frolics Qi Gong: Crane and Bear Exercises | year =2005 | publisher = Lulu.com | isbn = 978-1-4116-2776-5 }}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} White Crane,<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Clark | first1 = Angus | title = Secrets of Qigong (Secrets of) | year = 2003 | publisher = Evergreen | isbn = 978-3-8228-0967-9 }}</ref> and Wild Goose (Dayan) Qigong.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Zhang | first1 = Hong-Chao | title = Wild Goose Qigong: Natural Movement for Healthy Living | year =2000  | publisher = YMAA Publication Center | isbn = 978-1-886969-78-0 }}</ref><ref>

* Static practice
: involves holding postures for sustained periods of time.<ref>{{cite book|last= Diepersloot|first=Jan| year=2000|title= The Tao of Yiquan: The Method of Awareness in the Martial Arts|publisher= Center For Healing & The Arts|isbn=978-0-9649976-1-5}}</ref>  In some cases this bears resemblance to the practice of [[Yoga]] and its continuation in the Buddhist tradition.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Dumoulin | first1 = Heinrich | last2 = Heisig | first2 = James W. | last3 = McRae | first3 = John M. | last4 = Knitter | first4 = Paul F. | title = Zen Buddhism: a history | year = 2005 | publisher = World Wisdom | location = Bloomington, Ind.  | isbn = 978-0-941532-89-1 }}</ref> For example [[Yiquan]], a Chinese martial art derived from [[xingyiquan]], emphasizes static stance training.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Dong | first1 = Paul | last2 = Raffill | first2 = Thomas | title = Empty Force: The Power of Chi for Self-Defense and Energy Healing | publisher = Blue Snake Books/Frog, Ltd. | isbn = 978-1-58394-134-8 | date = 2005-12-10 }}</ref> In another example, the healing form Eight Pieces of Brocade ([[Baduanjin qigong]]) is based on a series of static postures.<ref name="Yang-Eight">{{Cite book  | last1 = Yang | first1 = Jwing-Ming | last2 = Jwing-Ming | first2 = Yang | title = Eight Simple Qigong Exercises for Health: The Eight Pieces of Brocade | publisher = YMAA Publication Center  | isbn = 978-1-886969-52-0 | year = 1997 }}</ref>

* Meditative practice
: utilizes breath awareness, visualization, [[mantra]], chanting, sound, and focus on philosophical concepts such as ''qi'' circulation, aesthetics, or moral values.<ref>{{cite book|last= Lu|first=Kuan Yü| year=1969|title= The secrets of Chinese meditation: self-cultivation by mind control as taught in the Ch'an, Mahāyāna and Taoist schools in China|publisher= S. Weiser}}</ref> In traditional Chinese medicine and Daoist practice, the meditative focus is commonly on cultivating ''qi'' in [[dantian]] energy centers and balancing ''qi'' flow in [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridian]] and other pathways.  In various Buddhist traditions, the aim is to still the mind, either through outward focus, for example on a place, or through inward focus on the breath, a mantra, a [[koan]], emptiness, or the idea of the eternal. In the Confucius scholar tradition, meditation is focused on humanity and virtue, with the aim of self-enlightenment.<ref name=YJM2 />

* Use of external agents
: Many systems of ''qigong'' practice include the use of external agents such as ingestion of herbs, massage, physical manipulation, or interaction with other living organisms.<ref name=LWW/>  For example, specialized food and drinks are used in some medical and Daoist forms, whereas massage and body manipulation are sometimes used in martial arts forms. In some medical systems a ''qigong'' master uses non-contact treatment, purportedly guiding qi through his or her own body into the body of another person.<ref name=Xu>{{Cite book  | last1 = Xu | first1 = Xiangcai |  title = Qigong for Treating Common Ailments | year = 2000 | publisher = YMAA Publication Center | isbn = 978-1-886969-70-4 }}</ref>

===Forms===
There are numerous ''qigong'' forms. 75 ancient forms that can be found in ancient literature and also 56 common or contemporary forms have been described in a ''qigong'' compendium.<ref name="MaJiRen1992">{{Cite book  | last1 = Ma Ji Ren {{lang|zh|馬濟人}}| trans-title = Practical Qigong for Traditional Chinese Medicine |script-title=zh:實用中醫氣功學 | year = 1992 | publisher = Shanghai Scientific and Technical Publishers {{lang|zh|上海科学枝术出版社}}| isbn = 978-7532327201| pages = 466}}</ref>{{rp|203–433}} The list is by no means exhaustive. Many contemporary forms were developed by people who had recovered from their illness after ''qigong'' practice.

Most of the ''qigong'' forms come under the following categories:{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}

# Martial ''qigong''
# Spiritual ''qigong''
# Intellectual ''qigong''
# Life nourishing ''qigong''

==== Development of "health ''qigong''" ====
In 1995, there was Qigong Talent Bank, an organization of Science Research of Chinese Qigong, functioning as network system of the senior Chinese qigong talents in China. In order to promote ''qigong'' exercises in a standardised and effective way with a scientific approach, The Chinese Health Qigong Association (CHQA) appointed panels of Qigong experts, Chinese medicine doctors and sport science professors from different hospitals, universities and ''qigong ''lineage across China to research and develop new sets of ''qigong'' exercises. In 2003 the CHQA officially promoted a new system called "health ''qigong''", which consisted of four newly developed health ''qigong'' forms:

* [[Yì Jīn Jīng|Health Qigong Muscle-Tendon Change Classic]] (Health Qigong Yì Jīn Jīng {{lang|zh|易筋經}}).
* [[Wu Qin Xi|Health Qigong Five Animals Frolics]] (Health qigong Wu Qin Xi {{lang|zh|五禽戲}}).
* [[Liu Zi Jue|Health Qigong Six Healing Sounds]] (Health Qigong Liu Zi Jue {{lang|zh|六字訣}}).
* [[Baduanjin qigong|Health Qigong Eight Pieces of Brocade]] (Health Qigong Ba Duan Jin {{lang|zh|八段錦}}).

In 2010, the Chinese Health Qigong Association officially introduced five additional health ''qigong'' forms:<ref name=CHQA2 >{{cite web | url=http://jsqg.sport.org.cn/en/bulletin/2010-07-01/310819.html | title = Health Qigong Management Center introduced five sets of new exercises of Health Qigong | author = Chinese Health Qigong Association | location  = Beijing| access-date  =2012-03-12}}</ref>

===Techniques===
Whether viewed from the perspective of exercise, health, philosophy, or martial arts training, several main principles emerge concerning the practice of qigong:<ref name=Cohen /><ref name=Frantzis /><ref name=Garripoli>{{Cite book  | last1 = Garripoli | first1 = Garri | title = Qigong: Essence of the Healing Dance | year =1999 | publisher = HCI | isbn = 978-1-55874-674-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Use of Sound in Qigong|url=http://portlandtaichiacademy.com/the-use-of-sound-in-qigong/|work=portlandtaichiacademy.com|publisher=Portland Tai Chi Academy|access-date=12 March 2014|date=2014-03-12}}</ref>

* '''Intentional movement''': careful, flowing balanced style
* '''Rhythmic breathing''': slow, deep, coordinated with fluid movement
* '''Awareness''': calm, focused meditative state
* '''Visualization''': of ''qi'' flow, philosophical tenets, aesthetics
* '''Chanting/Sound''': use of sound as a focal point

Additional principles:

* '''Softness''': soft gaze, expressionless face
* '''Solid Stance''': firm footing, erect spine
* '''Relaxation''': relaxed muscles, slightly bent joints
* '''Balance and Counterbalance''': motion over the center of gravity

Advanced goals:

* '''Equanimity''': more fluid, more relaxed
* '''Tranquility''': empty mind, high awareness
* '''Stillness''': smaller and smaller movements, eventually to complete stillness

The most advanced practice is generally considered to be with little or no motion.

==Traditional and classical theory==

[[File:BRASILRIO4.jpg|thumb|right|''Qigong'' practitioners in [[Brazil]]]]
Over time, five distinct traditions or schools of ''qigong'' developed in China, each with its own theories and characteristics: Chinese [[Medical Qigong]], Daoist Qigong, Buddhist Qigong, Confucian Qigong, and Martial Qigong.<ref name=Liu2013CMQ/>{{rp|30–80}} All of these ''qigong'' traditions include practices intended to cultivate and balance [[qi]].<ref name=YJM2 /><ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Frantzis | first1 = Bruce Kumar | title = Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body (The Tao of Energy Enhancement) | year = 1995 | publisher = North Atlantic Books | isbn = 978-1-55643-164-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/openingenergygat00fran }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Liu | first1 = JeeLoo | title = An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy: From Ancient Philosophy to Chinese Buddhism | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | isbn = 978-1-4051-2949-7 | date = 2006-05-05 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Li | first1 = Chenyang | title = The Tao encounters the West: explorations in comparative philosophy | url = https://archive.org/details/taoencounterswes0000lich | url-access = registration | year = 1999 | publisher = State University of New York Press | location = Albany  | isbn = 978-0-7914-4135-0 }}</ref>

===Traditional Chinese medicine===
{{main|Traditional Chinese medicine}}
The theories of ancient Chinese ''qigong'' include the [[Yin-Yang]] and [[Wuxing (Chinese philosophy)|Five Phases]] Theory, [[Jing (Chinese medicine)|Essence]]-[[Qi]]-[[Shen (Chinese religion)|Spirit]] Theory, Zang-Xiang Theory, and Meridians and Qi-Blood Theory, which have been synthesized as part of [[traditional Chinese medicine|Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)]].<ref name=Liu2013CMQ/>{{rp|45–57}} TCM focuses on tracing and correcting underlying disharmony, in terms of deficiency and excess, using the complementary and opposing forces of [[yin and yang]]  ({{lang|zh|陰陽}}), to create a balanced flow of ''qi''. ''Qi'' is believed to be cultivated and stored in three main [[dantian]] energy centers and to travel through the body along twelve main [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]] (Jīng Luò {{lang|zh|經絡}}), with numerous smaller branches and tributaries.  The main meridians correspond to [[Zang Fu|twelve main organs )]] (Zàng fǔ {{lang|zh|臟腑}}). ''Qi'' is balanced in terms of [[yin and yang]] in the context of the traditional system of Five Phases (Wu xing {{lang|zh|五行}}).<ref name=YJM2 /><ref name=Holland /> A person is believed to become ill or die when ''qi'' becomes diminished or unbalanced.  Health is believed to be returned by rebuilding ''qi'', eliminating ''qi'' blockages, and correcting ''qi'' imbalances. These TCM concepts do not translate readily to modern science and medicine.

===Daoism===
In [[Taoism|Daoism]], various practices now known as Daoist ''qigong'' are claimed to provide a way to achieve [[longevity]] and spiritual [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]],<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Luk | first1 = C. | last2 = Chen Chao | first2 = Pi | last3 = Lu | first3 = Kʻuan Yü | title = Taoist yoga: alchemy and immortality: a translation, with introduction and notes, of The secrets of cultivating nature and eternal life (Hsin ming fa chueh ming chih) | year = 1984 | publisher = Samuel Weiser | location = York Beach, Me. | isbn = 978-0-87728-067-5 | url = https://archive.org/details/taoistyogaalchem00chaorich }}</ref> as well as a closer connection with the natural world.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Réquéna | first1 = Yves | title = Chi Kung: The Chinese Art of Mastering Energy | year = 1996 | publisher = Healing Arts Press | isbn = 978-0892816392 | page = 4 }}</ref>

===Confucianism===
In [[Confusianism|Confucianism]] practices now known as Confucian ''qigong'' provide a means to become a [[Junzi]] ({{lang|zh|君子}}) through awareness of [[morality]].<ref>

==Contemporary qigong==
In contemporary China, the emphasis of ''qigong'' practice has shifted away from traditional philosophy, spiritual attainment, and folklore, and increasingly to health benefits, traditional medicine and martial arts applications, and a scientific perspective.<ref name = Palmer /><ref name = Ownby /> ''Qigong'' is now practiced by millions worldwide, primarily for its health benefits, though many practitioners have also adopted traditional [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medical]], or [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]] perspectives, and even use the long [[Qigong history|history of ''qigong'']] as evidence of its effectiveness.<ref name="YJM2" /><ref name=Garripoli />

===Contemporary Chinese medical qigong===
''Qigong'' has been recognized as a "standard medical technique" in China since 1989, and is sometimes included in the medical curriculum of major universities in China.<ref name=Wengell2008>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/educationaloppor0000weng |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/educationaloppor0000weng/page/34 34] |title=Educational Opportunities in Integrative Medicine |author1=Douglas Wengell |author2=Nathen Gabriel |publisher=The Hunter Press |isbn=978-0-9776552-4-3 |year=2008}}</ref>{{rp|34}} The 2013 English translation of the official Chinese Medical Qigong textbook used in China<ref name=Liu2013CMQ/>{{rp|iv,385}} defines CMQ as "the skill of body-mind exercise that integrates body, breath, and mind adjustments into one" and emphasizes that ''qigong'' is based on "adjustment" (tiao {{lang|zh|調}}, also translated as "regulation", "tuning", or "alignment") of body, breath, and mind.<ref name=Liu2013CMQ>{{cite book|editor-last= Liu |editor-first=Tian Jun|editor-last2= Qiang |editor-first2=Xiao Mei | year=2013|title= Chinese Medical Qigong, Third Edition|publisher= Singing Dragon |isbn=978-1848190962}}</ref>{{rp|16–18}}  As such, ''qigong'' is viewed by practitioners as being more than common physical exercise, because ''qigong'' combines postural, breathing, and mental training in one to produce a particular psychophysiological state of being.<ref name=Liu2013CMQ/>{{rp|15}}  While CMQ is still based on traditional and classical theory, modern practitioners also emphasize the importance of a strong scientific basis.<ref name=Liu2013CMQ/>{{rp|81–89}}  According to the 2013 CMQ textbook, physiological effects of ''qigong'' are numerous, and include improvement of respiratory and cardiovascular function, and possibly neurophysiological function.<ref name=Liu2013CMQ/>{{rp|89–102}}

===Conventional medicine===
Especially since the 1990s, conventional or mainstream Western medicine often strives to heed the model of [[evidence-based medicine]], EBM, which demotes medical theory, clinical experience, and physiological data to prioritize the results of controlled, and especially randomized, clinical trials of the treatment itself.<ref name=Sackett96>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sackett DL, Rosenberg WM, Gray JA, Haynes RB, Richardson WS |title=Evidence based medicine: what it is and what it isn't |journal=BMJ |volume=312 |issue=7023 |pages=71–2 |date=January 1996 |pmid=8555924 |pmc=2349778  |doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7023.71}}</ref><ref>

===Integrative, complementary, and alternative medicine===
Integrative medicine (IM) refers to "the blending of conventional and complementary medicines and therapies with the aim of using the most appropriate of either or both modalities to care for the patient as a whole",<ref name=Kotsirilos2011>{{cite book|author1=Kotsirilos, Vicki |author2=Luis Vitetta |author3=Avni Sali| year=2011|title=A Guide to Evidence-based Integrative and Complementary Medicine |publisher= Elsevier Health Sciences APAC.

===Scientific basis===
Scientists interested in ''qigong'' have sought to describe or verify the effects of ''qigong'', to explore mechanisms of effects, to form scientific theory with respect to ''qigong'', and to identify appropriate research methodology for further study.<ref name=Liu2013CMQ/>{{rp|81–89}} In terms of traditional theory, the existence of ''qi'' has not been independently verified in an experimental setting.<ref name=NCCAM>{{cite web|title=Energy Medicine: An Overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115162836/http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/energymed.htm|publisher=National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|archive-date=15 November 2008|access-date=17 March 2014|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/energymed.htm|date=2011-11-11}}</ref> In any case, some researches have reported effects on pathophysiological parameters of biomedical interest.<ref name=":0">Kevin Chen, Elizabeth R.

== Practitioners, uses and cautions ==

=== Recreation and popular use ===
People practice ''qigong'' for many different reasons, including for [[recreation]], [[Physical exercise|exercise]] and [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[preventive medicine]] and [[self-healing]], [[meditation]] and [[Higher self|self-cultivation]], and [[Chinese martial arts|training for martial arts]]. Practitioners range from athletes to the physically challenged. Because it is low impact and can be done lying, sitting, or standing, ''qigong'' is accessible for disabled persons, seniors, and people recovering from injuries.<ref name="Cohen"/>

=== Therapeutic use ===
Therapeutic use of ''qigong'' is directed by TCM, CAM, integrative medicine, and other health practitioners. In China, where it is considered a "standard medical technique",<ref name=Wengell2008/>{{rp|34}} ''qigong'' is commonly prescribed to treat a wide variety of conditions, and clinical applications include [[hypertension]], [[coronary artery disease]], [[peptic ulcers]], [[liver diseases|chronic liver diseases]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[obesity]], [[menopause|menopause syndrome]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[insomnia]], [[Cancer|tumors and cancer]], [[lower back pain|lower back and leg pain]], [[cervical spondylosis]], and [[myopia]].<ref name=Liu2013CMQ/>{{rp|261–391}}  Outside China ''qigong'' is used in [[integrative medicine]] to complement or supplement accepted medical treatments, including for [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], [[Physical exercise|fitness]], [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]], and treatment of specific conditions.<ref name=Kotsirilos2011/><ref name= Kuntsler2010>{{cite book|last1= Kuntsler |first1= R.A. |author2=F.S. Daly  |year=2010 |title= Therapeutic Recreation Leadership and Programming |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=978-0736068550 }}</ref> However, there is no high-quality evidence that ''qigong'' is actually effective for these conditions.<ref name=hartley/> Based on [[systematic review]]s of [[clinical research]], there is insufficient [[evidence-based medicine|evidence]] for the effectiveness of using ''qigong'' as a therapy for any medical condition.<ref name=nccih16/><ref name=Lee2011/>

=== Safety and cost ===
''Qigong'' is generally viewed as safe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tai Chi and Qi Gong for Health and Well-Being|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/video/taichiDVD|publisher=National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|access-date=5 March 2014|date=2012-01-06}}</ref> No adverse effects have been observed in clinical trials, such that ''qigong'' is considered safe for use across diverse populations. Cost for self-care is minimal, and cost efficiencies are high for group delivered care.<ref name=Jahnke_et_al_2010/> Typically the cautions associated with ''qigong'' are the same as those associated with any physical activity, including risk of muscle strains or sprains, advisability of stretching to prevent injury, general safety for use alongside conventional medical treatments, and consulting with a physician when combining with conventional treatment.<ref name=nccih16/><ref>{{cite web|title=Web MD: Are tai chi and qi gong safe?|url=http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/tc/tai-chi-and-qi-gong-topic-overview|access-date=14 March 2014}}</ref>

==Clinical research==

=== Overview ===
Although there is ongoing [[clinical research]] examining the potential health effects of ''qigong'', there is little financial or medical incentive to support high-quality research, and still only a limited number of studies meet accepted medical and scientific standards of [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized controlled trials (RCTs)]].<ref name=nccih16/><ref name=Jahnke_et_al_2010>{{Cite journal | last1 = Jahnke | first1 = R. | last2 = Larkey | first2 = L. | last3 = Rogers | first3 = C. |  last4 = Etnier | first4 = J |  last5 = Lin | first5 =  F. | title = A comprehensive review of health benefits of qigong and tai chi | year =2010 | journal = American Journal of Health Promotion | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = e1–e25 | pmid=20594090 | doi=10.4278/ajhp.081013-LIT-248 | pmc=3085832}}</ref> Clinical research concerning ''qigong'' has been conducted for a wide range of medical conditions, including [[bone density]], [[Cardiopulmonary|cardiopulmonary effects]], [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|physical function]], [[Balance (ability)|falls and related risk factors]], [[Quality of life (healthcare)|quality of life]], [[Immune system|immune function]], [[inflammation]],<ref name=Jahnke_et_al_2010/> [[hypertension]],<ref name=hartley/> [[pain]],<ref name=LeeIntPain2009/> and [[cancer]] treatment.<ref name=nccih16/><ref name=LeeCancer2010/>

=== Systematic reviews ===
A 2009 systematic review on the effect of ''qigong'' exercises on reducing pain concluded that "the existing trial evidence is not convincing enough to suggest that internal qigong is an effective modality for pain management."<ref name=LeeIntPain2009>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee MS, Pittler MH, Ernst E |title=Internal qigong for pain conditions: a systematic review |journal=J Pain |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=1121–1127.e14 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19559656 |doi=10.1016/j.jpain.2009.03.009 }}</ref>

A 2010 systematic review of the effect of ''qigong'' exercises on [[cancer]] treatment concluded "the effectiveness of qigong in cancer care is not yet supported by the evidence from rigorous clinical trials."<ref name=LeeCancer2010>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee MS, Chen KW, Sancier KM, Ernst E |title=Qigong for cancer treatment: a systematic review of controlled clinical trials |journal=Acta Oncol |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=717–22 |year=2007 |pmid=17653892 |doi=10.1080/02841860701261584 |doi-access=free }}</ref> A separate systematic review that looked at the effects of qigong exercises on various physiological or psychological outcomes found that the available studies were poorly designed, with a high risk of bias in the results. Therefore, the authors concluded, "Due to limited number of RCTs in the field and methodological problems and high risk of bias in the included studies, it is still too early to reach a conclusion about the efficacy and the effectiveness of qigong exercise as a form of health practice adopted by the cancer patients during their curative, palliative, and rehabilitative phases of the cancer journey."<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Chan CL, Wang CW, Ho RT, etal |title=A systematic review of the effectiveness of qigong exercise in supportive cancer care |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=1121–33 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22258414 |pmc=3342492 |doi=10.1007/s00520-011-1378-3 }}</ref>

A 2011 overview of [[systematic reviews]] of controlled clinical trials, Lee et al. concluded that "the effectiveness of qigong is based mostly on poor quality research" and "therefore, it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions at this stage."<ref name=Lee2011>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee MS, Oh B, Ernst E |title=Qigong for healthcare: an overview of systematic reviews |journal=JRSM Short Rep |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=1–5 |year=2011 |pmid=21369525 |pmc=3046559 |doi=10.1258/shorts.2010.010091 }}</ref>  Although a 2010 [[literature review|comprehensive literature review]] found 77 peer-reviewed [[Randomized controlled trial|RCTs]],<ref name=Jahnke_et_al_2010/> Lee et al.'s overview of systematic reviews as to particular health conditions found problems like sample size, lack of proper control groups, with lack of [[Blind study|blinding]] associated with high risk of bias.<ref name=Lee2011/>

A 2015 systematic review of the effect of ''qigong'' exercises on [[cardiovascular diseases]] and [[hypertension]] found no conclusive evidence for effect.<ref name="hartley">{{cite journal|pmid=26068956|title=Qigong for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease|authors=Hartley L, Lee MS, Kwong JS, Flowers N, Todkill D, Ernst E, Rees K|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|year=2015|issue=6|page=CD010390|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010390.pub2|pmc=6956616}}</ref> Also in 2015, a systemic review into the effects on hypertension suggested that it may be effective, but that the evidence was not conclusive because of the poor quality of the trials it included, and advised more rigorous research in the future.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=4602820|year=2015|author1=Xiong|first1=X|title=Qigong for Hypertension: A Systematic Review|journal=Medicine|volume=94|issue=1|pages=e352|last2=Wang|first2=P|last3=Li|first3=X|last4=Zhang|first4=Y|doi=10.1097/MD.0000000000000352|pmid=25569652}}</ref> Another 2015 systematic review of ''qigong'' on [[biomarker]]s of cardiovascular disease concluded that some trials showed favorable effects, but concludes, "Most of the trials included in this review are likely to be at high risk of bias, so we have very low confidence in the validity of the results.<ref name=hartley/>

=== Mental health ===
Many claims have been made that ''qigong'' can benefit or ameliorate mental health conditions,<ref name=Jahnke_et_al_2010 /> including improved [[mood (psychology)|mood]], decreased stress reaction, and decreased anxiety and depression. Most medical studies have only examined psychological factors as secondary goals, although various studies have shown decreases in [[cortisol]] levels, a chemical hormone produced by the body in response to stress.<ref name=Jahnke_et_al_2010 />

===China===
Basic and clinical research in China during the 1980s was mostly descriptive, and few results were reported in [[peer-review]]ed English-language journals.<ref name=Micozzi2010/>{{rp|,22060–22063}} ''Qigong'' became known outside China in the 1990s, and clinical randomized controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of ''qigong'' on health and mental conditions began to be published worldwide, along with systematic reviews.<ref name=Micozzi2010/>{{rp|21792–21798}}

=== Challenges===
Most existing clinical trials have small sample sizes and many have inadequate controls. Of particular concern is the impracticality of [[Blinded experiment|double blinding]] using appropriate sham treatments, and the difficulty of placebo control, such that benefits often cannot be distinguished from the [[placebo effect]].<ref name=Micozzi2010/>{{rp|22278–22306}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Clinical trials and CAM |url=https://nccih.nih.gov/sites/nccam.nih.gov/files/clinicaltrials.pdf |publisher=National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, US National Institutes of Health |access-date=27 October 2018 |date=August 2010}}</ref> Also of concern is the choice of which ''qigong'' form to use and how to standardize the treatment or amount with respect to the skill of the practitioner leading or administering treatment, the tradition of individualization of treatments, and the treatment length, intensity, and frequency.<ref name=Micozzi2010/>{{rp|6869–6920,22361–22370}}

==Meditation and self-cultivation applications==
{{main|Meditation}}
''Qigong'' is practiced for [[meditation]] and self-cultivation as part of various philosophical and spiritual traditions. As meditation, ''qigong'' is a means to still the mind and enter a state of consciousness that brings serenity, clarity, and bliss.<ref name=LWW /> Many practitioners find ''qigong'', with its gentle focused movement, to be more accessible than seated meditation.<ref name="Garripoli"/>

''Qigong'' for self-cultivation can be classified in terms of traditional Chinese philosophy: Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian.

==Martial Arts applications==
The practice of ''qigong'' is an important component in both [[Neijia|internal]] and external style [[Chinese martial arts]].<ref name =LWW /> Focus on ''qi'' is considered to be a source of power as well as the foundation of the [[Neijia|internal style]] of martial arts (Neijia). [[T'ai Chi Ch'uan]], [[Xing Yi Quan]], and [[Baguazhang]] are representative of the types of Chinese martial arts that rely on the concept of ''qi'' as the foundation.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Li | first1 = Lu | last2 = Yun | first2 = Zhang | title = The Combat Techniques of Tai Ji, Xing Yi, and Ba Gua : Principles and Practices of Internal Martial Arts | year =2006  | publisher = Frog, Ltd./Blue Snake Books | isbn = 978-1-58394-145-4 }}</ref> Extraordinary feats of martial arts prowess, such as the ability to withstand heavy strikes ([[Iron Shirt]], {{lang|zh|鐵衫}})<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Chia | first1 = Mantak | title = Iron Shirt Chi Kung | year =2006  | publisher = Destiny Books | isbn = 978-1-59477-104-0 }}</ref> and the ability to break hard objects ([[Iron Palm]], {{lang|zh|鐵掌}})<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = Lee | first1 = Ying-Arng. | title = Iron Palm in 100 days | year =1973  | publisher = Wehman Bros.

''[[Tai chi|T'ai Chi Ch'uan]]'' (Taijiquan) is a widely practiced Chinese [[Neijia|internal]] [[Chinese martial arts|martial style]] based on the theory of [[Taiji (philosophy)|taiji]], closely associated with ''qigong'', and typically involving more complex choreographed movement coordinated with breath, done slowly for health and training, or quickly for self-defense. Many scholars consider t'ai chi ch'uan to be a type of ''qigong'', traced back to an origin in the seventeenth century. In modern practice, ''qigong'' typically focuses more on health and meditation rather than martial applications, and plays an important role in training for t'ai chi ch'uan, in particular used to build strength, develop breath control, and increase vitality ("life energy").<ref name = yang_taiji/><ref name = yeyoung_taichi_qigong>{{cite web
