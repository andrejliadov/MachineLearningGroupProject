==Russia-Saudi Arabia relations==
In response to dramatic drop in oil consumption due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Saudi Arabia attempted to orchestrate a worldwide decrease in oil production to keep prices at a moderate level. However, when Russia refused to reduce oil production, Saudi Arabia triggered an oil price war in March 2020. This economic conflict resulted in a sheer drop of oil price over the spring of 2020, with the price becoming negative on April 20. Since oil production is [[inelastic]] and cannot be stopped completely, but even the lowest possible production level generates much greater supply than demand, the oil industry has nowhere to store oil and is ready to pay for it being taken away.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5824263/coronavirus-negative-oil-prices-consolidation/|title=Oil Prices Won't Be Negative Forever.

On 14 May 2020, fifty-two of the fifty-seven deputies of the [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica]] signed a letter addressed to the director of the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO), [[Carissa F.

The deputies questioned the Nicaraguan government's figures of 25 coronavirus infections with eight deaths, in contrast to data from the independent Citizen Observatory, which has calculated 1,033 cases and at least 188 deaths in Nicaragua.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Costa Rica advierte de efectos regionales por manejo de COVID-19 en Nicaragua|url=https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2020/05/16/alerta-costa-rica-advierte-de-efectos-regionales-por-manejo-de-covid-19-en-nicaragua/|date=16 May 2020|website=CNN|language=es|access-date=16 May 2020}}</ref>

In the midst of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], international actors provided several relief packages and support actions to help countries deal with the outbreak. In the early phases of the epidemic, several countries donated masks, medical equipment and money to China. Once the crisis in China stabilised, the country began sending aid to other nations. In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with its coronavirus outbreak.

This was the case as rebel groups tried to exploit weaknesses of the state apparatus during the pandemic while international attention shifted away from armed groups.
