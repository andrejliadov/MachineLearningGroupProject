==History==
The 2018 book 'Pharming animals: a global history of antibiotics in food production (1935–2017)'<ref name="Kirchhelle C">{{cite journal| last1=Kirchelle |first1=Claas|title= Pharming animals: a global history of antibiotics in food production (1935–2017) |journal= Palgrave Communications |date= 7 August 2018|volume=4|doi= 10.1057/s41599-018-0152-2|s2cid=51934013}}</ref> summarises the central role antibiotics have played in agriculture: "Since their advent during the 1930s, antibiotics have not only had a dramatic impact on human medicine, but also on food production. On farms, whaling and fishing fleets as well as in processing plants and aquaculture operations, antibiotics were used to treat and prevent disease, increase feed conversion, and preserve food. Their rapid diffusion into nearly all areas of food production and processing was initially viewed as a story of progress on both sides of the Iron Curtain."

To retrace, while natural antibiotics or antibacterials were known to ancient man, [[antibiotic]]s as we know them came to the fore during World War II to help treat war time casualties. It is recorded that antibiotics were first used in farming towards the end of the war, in the form of intra-mammary penicillin preparations to treat bovine mastitis.<ref name=":8">{{Cite journal|last1=Gustafson|first1=R.

The use of antibiotics to treat and prevent disease has followed a similar path to that used in human medicine in terms of [https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=18811 therapeutic] and metaphylactic<ref name=":4" /> applications to treat and manage disease and improve population health, and the application of case-by-case strategic preventative treatments when animals are deemed at particular risk. However, in the late 1940s, studies examining the supplementation of B12 in chicks' diets found that B12 produced from the fermentation of ''Streptomyces aureofaciens'', an antibiotic for use in human medicine, produced a better weight gain for chicks than B12 supplied from other sources, and a reduced amount of feed to bring the birds to market weight.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Stokstad|first1=ELR|last2=Jukes|first2=TH|last3=Pierce|first3=J|last4=Page|first4=AC Jnr|last5=Franklin|first5=AL|date=1949|title=The multiple nature of the animal protein factor|url=https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19491403454|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=180|issue=2|pages=647–654|pmid=18135798|via=CAB Direct}}</ref> Further studies on other livestock species showed a similar improved growth and feed efficiency effect with the result that as the cost of antibiotics came down, they were increasingly included at low ('[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/subtherapeutic sub-therapeutic')] levels in livestock feed as a means of increasing production of affordable animal protein to meet the needs of a rapidly-expanding post-war population.<ref name=":8" /> This development coincided with an increase in the scale of individual farms and the level of confinement of the animals on them, and so routine preventative antibiotic treatments became the most cost-effective means of treating the anticipated disease that could sometimes arise as a result.<ref name=":8" /> Veterinary medicine increasingly embraced the therapeutic, metaphylactic and strategic preventative use of antibiotics to treat disease. The routine use of antibiotics for growth stimulation and disease prevention also grew.

==Antibiotic resistance==

=== Mechanisms for the development of resistance ===
Antibiotic resistance - often referred to as [[antimicrobial resistance]] (AMR) although this term covers anti-virals, anti-fungals and other products - can occur when antibiotics are present in concentrations too low to inhibit bacterial growth, triggering cellular responses in the bacteria that allow them to survive. These bacteria can then reproduce and spread their antibiotic-resistant genes to other generations, increasing their prevalence and leading to infections that cannot be healed by antibiotics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ben|first1=Yujie|last2=Fu|first2=Caixia|last3=Hu|first3=Min|last4=Liu|first4=Lei|last5=Wong|first5=Ming Hung|last6=Zheng|first6=Chunmiao|s2cid=56488563|date=February 2019|title=Human health risk assessment of antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic residues in the environment: A review|journal=Environmental Research|volume=169|pages=483–493|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2018.11.040|issn=1096-0953|pmid=30530088|bibcode=2019ER....169..483B}}</ref> This is a growing matter of concern as antibiotic resistance is considered to be a serious future threat to human welfare.<ref name=pmid22048738/> Infectious diseases are the third leading cause of death in Europe and a future without effective antibiotics would fundamentally change the way modern medicine is practised.<ref name=pmid22048738/><ref name=pmid25918440>{{cite journal |last1=Shallcross |first1=Laura J. |last2=Howard |first2=Simon J. |last3=Fowler |first3=Tom |last4=Davies |first4=Sally C. |s2cid=39361030 |title=Tackling the threat of antimicrobial resistance: from policy to sustainable action |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=5 June 2015 |volume=370 |issue=1670 |pages=20140082 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0082 |pmid=25918440 |pmc=4424432 }}</ref> 
[[File:Hartsock Genetic Engineering Bacteria Cell Division.png|thumb|Bacterial conjugation|333x333px]]
Bacteria can alter their genetic inheritance through two main ways, either by mutating their genetic material or acquiring a new one from other bacteria. The latter being the most important for causing antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains in animals and humans. One of the methods bacteria can obtain new genes is through a process called conjugation which deals with transferring genes using plasmids. These conjugative plasmids carry a number of genes that can be assembled and rearranged, which could then enable bacteria to exchange beneficial genes among themselves ensuring their survival against antibiotics and rendering them ineffective to treat dangerous diseases in humans, resulting into multi-drug resistant organisms.<ref>Bennett P. M. (2008). Plasmid encoded antibiotic resistance: acquisition and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria. British journal of pharmacology, 153 Suppl 1(Suppl 1), S347-57.</ref>

However, it is important to note that antibiotic resistance also occurs naturally, as it is a bacterium's response to any threat.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) published a revised list in 2019 of 'Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine, 6th revision'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/312266/9789241515528-eng.pdf?ua=1|title=Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine, 6th Revision|last=World Health Organization|date=2018|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref> with the intent that it be used "as a reference to help formulate and prioritise risk assessment and risk management strategies for containing antimicrobial resistance due to human and non-human antimicrobial use to help preserve the effectiveness of currently available antimicrobials. It lists its Highest Priority Critically Important Antimicrobials as: 3rd, 4th and 5th generation cephalosporins, glycopeptides, macrolides and ketolides, polymyxins including colistin, and quinolones including fluoroqinolones.

The [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) Antimicrobial Advice Ad-Hoc Expert Group (AMEG) also published an updated categorisation<ref name=":11">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/veterinary-regulatory/overview/antimicrobial-resistance/advice-impacts-using-antimicrobials-animals|title=Advice on impacts of using antimicrobials in animals|last=European Medicines Agency|date=January 2020|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref> of different antibiotics in veterinary medicine by the antibiotic resistance risk to humans of using them alongside the need to treat disease in animals for health and welfare reasons. The categorisation specifically focuses on the situation in Europe. Category A (‘Avoid’) antibiotics are designated as ‘not appropriate for use in food producing animals’. Category B (‘Restrict’) products, also known as Highest Priority Critically Important Antibiotics, are only to be used as a last resort. These include quinolones (such as fluoroquinolones), 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, and polymyxins, including colistin. A new intermediate Category C (‘Caution’) has been created for antibiotics which should be used when there is no available product in Category D (‘Prudence’) that would be clinically effective. Category C includes macrolides and aminoglycosides, with the exception of spectinomycin, which remains in Category D.

As Chang ''et al'' (2014)<ref name=":10" /> state: "The topic of agricultural antibiotic use is complex. As we noted ...many believe that agricultural antibiotics have become a critical threat to human health. While the concern is not unwarranted, the extent of the problem may be exaggerated. There is no evidence that agriculture is ‘largely to blame’ for the increase in resistant strains and we should not be distracted from finding adequate ways to ensure appropriate antibiotic use in all settings, the most important of which being clinical medicine."

==== Direct contact with animals ====
In terms of direct infection with resistant bacteria from an animals source, studies have shown that direct contact with livestock can lead to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The risk appears greatest in those handling or managing livestock, for example in a study where resistant bacteria were monitored in farm labourers and neighbours after chickens receiving an antibiotic in their feed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Levy |first1=SB |last2=FitxGerald |first2=GB |last3=Macone |first3=AB |title=Changes in intestinal flora of farm personnel after introduction of a tetracycline-supplemented feed on a farm |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=September 1976 |volume=295 |issue=11 |pages=583–8 |doi=10.1056/NEJM197609092951103 |pmid=950974}}</ref> Manure may also be contain antibiotic-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' bacteria which can infect humans.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Sarah|year=2013|title=Pig-manure fertilizer linked to human MRSA infections|journal=Nature News|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13752|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Casey|first1=Joan A.|last2=Curriero|first2=Frank C.|last3=Cosgrove|first3=Sara E.|last4=Nachman|first4=Keeve E.|last5=Schwartz|first5=Brian S.|date=25 November 2013|title=High-Density Livestock Operations, Crop Field Application of Manure, and Risk of Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infection in Pennsylvania|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=173|issue=21|pages=1980–90|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.10408|pmc=4372690|pmid=24043228}}</ref> In 2017, the [[WHO]] included methicillin-resistant ''S. aureus'' (MRSA) in its priority list of 12 antibiotic-resistant bacteria, urging the need to search for new and more effective antibiotics against it. There also has been an increase in the number of bacterial pathogens resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, including MRSA, which have recently emerged into different lineages. Some of them are associated with livestock and companion animals that are then able to be transmitted to humans, also called livestock-associated methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (LA-MRSA). These new lineages can be found on soft tissues of livestock workers, for example in their noses. A study looked at the association between exposure to livestock and the occurrence of LA-MRSA infection and observed that LA-MRSA infection was 9.64 times as likely to be found among livestock workers and veterinarians compared to their unexposed families and community members, showing that exposure to livestock significantly increases the risk of developing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.<ref>Chen, C., & Wu, F.

The use of antibiotics in livestock also has the potential to introduce antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans via environmental exposure or inhalation of airborne bacteria. Antibiotics given to livestock in sub-therapeutic concentrations to stimulate growth when there is no diagnosis of disease - a practice still permitted in some countries - may kill some, but not all, of the bacterial organisms in the animal, possibly leaving those that are naturally antibiotic-resistant in the environment. Hence the practice of using antibiotics for growth stimulation could result in selection for resistance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wegener|first=Henrik C.|title=Antibiotic Resistance — Linking Human And Animal Health: Improving Food Safety Through a One Health Approach Workshop Summary|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-309-25937-8|editor=Choffnes, E.R.|location=Washington DC|chapter=A15 Antibiotic Resistance—Linking Human and Animal Health|doi=10.17226/13423|pmid=23230579|id=NBK114485|editor2=Relman, D.A.|editor3=Olsen, L.|editor4=Hutton, R.|editor5=Mack, A.|chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK114485/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Wegener H|year=2003|title=Antibiotics in animal feed and their role in resistance development|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|volume=6|issue=5|pages=439–445|doi=10.1016/j.mib.2003.09.009|pmid=14572534}}</ref> Antibiotics are not fully digested and processed in the animal or human gut, therefore, an estimated 40 to 90% of the antibiotics ingested are excreted in urine and/or faeces.<ref name="Prevalence">{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=X |s2cid=4154235 |title=Prevalence of veterinary antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli in the surface water of a livestock production region in northern China |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=e111026 |pmid=25372873 |pmc=4220964 |year=2014 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0111026 |bibcode=2014PLoSO...9k1026Z }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Storteboom|first1=Heather|last2=Arabi|first2=Mazdak|last3=Davis|first3=Jessica G.|last4=Crimi|first4=Barbara|last5=Pruden|first5=Amy|date=October 2010|title=Tracking Antibiotic Resistance Genes in the South Platte River Basin Using Molecular Signatures of Urban, Agricultural, And Pristine Sources|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|language=en|volume=44|issue=19|pages=7397–7404|doi=10.1021/es101657s|pmid=20809616|bibcode=2010EnST...44.7397S|issn=0013-936X}}</ref> This means that as well as finding antibiotics in human sewage and animal manure, both can also contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria which have developed ''in vivo'' or in the environment.

== Global positions on antibiotic use in farm animals ==
In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended reducing antibiotic use in animals used in the food industry. Due to the increasing risk of antibiotic resistant bacteria, the WHO strongly suggested restrictions on antibiotics being used for growth promotion and antibiotics used on healthy animals. Animals that require antibiotics should be treated with antibiotics that pose the smallest risk to human health.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> [[HSBC]] also produced a report in October 2018 warning that the use of antibiotics in meat production could have “devastating” consequences for humans. It noted that many dairy and meat producers in Asia and the Americas had an economic incentive to continue high usage of antibiotics, particularly in crowded or unsanitary living conditions.<ref>{{cite news |title=One of the world's largest banks has issued an alarming warning about antibiotic resistance — with big consequences for humanity |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/hsbc-says-meat-production-creates-devastating-antibiotic-resistance-2018-10 |access-date=13 November 2018 |publisher=Business Insider UK |date=10 October 2018}}</ref>

However, the [[World Organisation for Animal Health]] has acknowledged the need to protect antibiotics but argued against a total ban on antibiotic use in animal production.<ref>{{cite news |title=Antibiotics for livestock vital to feed world: OIE |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-antibiotics-livestock/antibiotics-for-livestock-vital-to-feed-world-oie-idUSTRE80A1JF20120111 |work=Reuters |date=11 January 2012}}</ref> A total ban on antibiotics might drastically reduce protein supply in some parts of the world,<ref name=":1">Stop using antibiotics in healthy animals to preserve their effectiveness.

Since it is difficult to estimate the value of potential health benefits, the study concluded that the complete economic impact of restricting antibiotic use has not yet been determined.<ref name="NRC" />

Although quantifying health benefits may be difficult, the economic impact of antibiotic restriction in animals can also be evaluated through the economic impact of antibiotic resistance in humans, which is a significant outcome of antibiotic use in animals. The World Health Organization identifies antibiotic resistance as a contributor to longer hospital stays and higher medical costs.<ref name="WHO AR">{{cite web |title=Antibiotic Resistance|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance |website=WHO |publisher=World Health Organization |access-date=28 March 2019}}</ref> When infections can no longer be treated by typical first-line antibiotics, more expensive medications are required for treatment. When illness duration is extended by antibiotics resistance, the increased health care costs create a larger economic burden for families and societies.<ref name="WHO AR"/> The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy estimates approximately $2.2 billion in antibiotic resistance- related healthcare costs each year.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dall |first1=Chris |title=Price to Pay: Antibiotic-Resistant Infections Cost $2 billion a year |journal=The Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy |date=22 March 2018}}</ref> So while restricting antibiotics in animals causes a significant economic burden, the outcome of antibiotic resistance in humans that is perpetuated by antibiotic use in animals carries comparable economic burdens.

In 1999 the New Zealand government issued a statement that they would not then ban the use of antibiotics in livestock production.<ref>{{cite news|last=staff|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=1071|title=NZ holds off ban on animal antibiotics – National – NZ Herald News|date=7 January 1999|work=nzherald.co.nz|access-date=29 August 2013}}</ref> In 2007 [[ABC Online]] reported on antibiotic use in chicken production in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/antibiotics-and-intensive-chicken-farming-in-new/3222458#transcript|title=Antibiotics and intensive chicken farming in New Zealand – The Science Show|last1=Williams|first1=Robyn|last2=Cook|first2=Greg|date=11 August 2007|work=abc.net.au|access-date=29 August 2013}}</ref>
In 2017, New Zealand published a new action plan to address the ongoing concern of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The action plan outlined five objectives with each objective looking both at AMR in humans and AMR in agriculture.<ref>Ministry of Health and Ministry for Primary Industries. 2017.

Compared to other countries, New Zealand has a very low prevalence of AMR in animals and plants. This is due to their low use of antibiotics in animal treatment.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Hillerton J.|author2=Irvine C.|author3=Bryan M.|author4=Scott D.|author5=Merchant S.|year=2016|title=Use of antimicrobials for animals in New Zealand, and in comparison with other countries|journal=New Zealand Veterinary Journal|volume=65|issue=2|pages=71–77|doi=10.1080/00480169.2016.1171736|pmid=27030313|s2cid=33661460}}</ref>

While sales data give an overview of levels of use, products are often licensed for use in many species and therefore it is not possible to determine levels of use in different species without more specific usage data from each sector. In 2011, British Poultry Council members, representing 90% of the UK poultry meat industry, formed a stewardship programme that started recording antibiotics used to treat birds in the poultry meat sector in 2012. The first report was published in 2016 and reported a 44% reduction in antibiotic use between 2012 and 2015.<ref name=":16">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishpoultry.org.uk/british-poultry-sector-reduces-antibiotic-use-by-44/|title=British Poultry Sector reduces antibiotic use by 44%|last=British Poultry Council|date=27 July 2016|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref> Since then, the organisation has produced three further reports, with the 2019 report confirming that the sector is maintaining reductions of over 80% in total use since it started its stewardship group, as well as reducing use of [https://www.ruma.org.uk/high-risk-antibiotics/ Highest Priority Critically Important Antibiotics] by over 80% by stopping use of 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins in 2012 and colistin in 2016, and only using macrolides and fluoroquinolones as a last resort. Preventative use of antibiotics has also stopped.

As many products are licensed for use in poultry and pigs, the increasing transparency around use in the UK poultry meat sector motivated the UK pig sector to set up a stewardship programme in 2016<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.farmantibiotics.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Pig-stewardship-scheme.pdf|title=NPA Pig IndustryAntibiotic Stewardship Programme|last=National Pig Association|date=2016|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref> through the [http://www.npa-uk.org.uk/ National Pig Association].

In 1970 the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] first recommended that antibiotic use in livestock be limited but set no actual regulations governing this recommendation.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> By 2001, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] estimated that more than 70% of the antibiotics consumed in the US were given to food animals (for example, chickens, pigs, and cattle), in the absence of disease.<ref name="TheRealNews-2014-05-18">{{cite web|url=http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=11872|title=Why Are Antibiotics Becoming Useless All Over the World?|author=Martin Khor|author-link=Martin Khor|date=18 May 2014|publisher=[[The Real News]]|access-date=18 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_agriculture/our-failing-food-system/industrial-agriculture/hogging-it-estimates-of.html#.Wycey1MvzEY|title=Executive summary from the UCS report "Hogging It: Estimates of Antimicrobial Abuse in Livestock"|date=January 2001|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists}}</ref>

In 2004 the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) heavily critiqued the FDA for not collecting enough information and data on antibiotic use in factory farms. From this, the GAO concluded the FDA did not have enough information to create effective policy changes regarding antibiotic use. In response, the FDA said more research was being conducted and voluntary efforts within the industry would solve the problem of antibiotic resistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-801|title=Antibiotic Resistance: Agencies Have Made Limited Progress Addressing Antibiotic Use in Animals|date=14 September 2011|publisher=U.

In 2015, the FDA approved a new Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD), an updated guideline giving instructions to pharmaceutical companies, veterinarians and producers about how to administer necessary drugs through the animal's feed and water.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/ucm216939.htm|title=FDA's Strategy on Antimicrobial Resistance - Questions and Answers|last=Center for Veterinary Medicine, FDA|date=December 2013|website=Guidance for Industry|access-date=14 March 2017|ref=FDAQA}}</ref> Around the same time, the FDA published a report of antibiotics sold or distributed for food-producing animals which found that between 2009 and 2013, just over 60% were 'medically-important' drugs also used in humans;<ref name="FDA2013" /> the rest were from drug classes like [[ionophores]], which are not used in human medicine.<ref name="Guidance for Industry: Evaluating the Safety of Antimicrobial New Animal Drugs with Regard to Their Microbiological Effects on Bacteria of Human Health Concern">{{Cite journal|date=2003|title=Evaluating the Safety of Antimicrobial New Animal Drugs with Regard to Their Microbiological Effects on Bacteria of Human Health Concern|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/ucm052519.pdf|journal=Guidance for Industry|issue=#152}}</ref> Following this, the FDA asked drug companies to voluntarily edit its labels to exclude growth promotion as an indication for antibiotic usage. It subsequently reports that “Under Guidance for Industry (GFI) #213, which went into effect Jan 1, 2017, antibiotics that are important for human medicine can no longer be used for growth promotion or feed efficiency in cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and other food animals.”<ref>Summary Report On Antimicrobials Sold or Distributed for Use in Food-Producing Animals.

Retrieved from https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/UserFees/AnimalDrugUserFeeActADUFA/UCM628538.pdf</ref> These new 2017 guidelines for instance prohibited using a drug off-label for non-therapeutic purposes, which would make using the re-labeled drug for growth enhancement illegal. In addition, some drugs were reclassified from 'Over the Counter' (OTC) to 'Veterinary Feed Directive' (VFD); VFD drugs require a veterinarian's authorization before they can be delivered in feed.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":2" /><ref name=":14">{{Cite web|url=https://ahdc.vet.cornell.edu/programs/NYSCHAP/nysvfrp/vfd.cfm#AffectedVFD|title=VFD – Veterinary Feed Directive|last=Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine|access-date=14 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=":3" /> As a result, the FDA reported a 33% decrease from 2016 to 2017 in domestic sales of medically important antibiotics for use in livestock. Despite this progress, the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) remains concerned that sales of antibiotics to the beef and pork industries remain elevated in 2017 compared with the poultry industries, and their use could still primarily be for preventing diseases in healthy animals, which further increases the threat on antibiotic resistance.<ref>Dall C.

Once manufacturers voluntarily make these changes, products can no longer be used for production purposes and therapeutic use of these products would require veterinary oversight.|sign=|source=|title=}}

Because of concerns about antibiotics residues getting into the milk or meat of cattle, in the United States, the government requires a withdraw period for any animal treated with antibiotics before it can be slaughtered, to allow residue to exit the animal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/beef_from_farm_to_table/index.asp|title=Beef...from Farm to Table|author=USDA|work=Fact Sheets|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224010018/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/Beef_from_Farm_to_Table/index.asp|archive-date=24 February 2013}}</ref>

== Research into alternatives ==
[[File:Global antibiotic use in livestock under reduction scenarios, OWID.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Global antibiotic use in livestock under reduction scenarios]]
Increasing concern due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has led researchers to look for alternatives to using antibiotics in livestock.<ref name=Allen>{{cite journal | author = Allen H. K. | author2=Trachsel J. | author3= Looft T. | author4= Casey T. A. | year = 2014 | title = Finding alternatives to antibiotics | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1323 | issue = 1| pages = 91–100 | pmid = 24953233 | doi=10.1111/nyas.12468| bibcode=2014NYASA1323...91A| s2cid=38772673 }}</ref>

[[Probiotics]], cultures of a single bacteria strain or mixture of different strains, are being studied in livestock as a production enhancer.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Hume M. E. | year = 2011 | title = Historic perspective: Prebiotics, probiotics, and other alternatives to antibiotics | url = http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/57525/PDF | journal = Poultry Science | volume = 90 | issue = 11| pages = 2663–9 | pmid = 22010256 | doi=10.3382/ps.2010-01030}}</ref>

[[Prebiotics]] are non-digestible carbohydrates. The carbohydrates are mainly made up of oligosaccharides which are short chains of monosaccharides. The two most commonly studied prebiotics are fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and mannanoligosaccharides (MOS). FOS has been studied for use in chicken feed. MOS works as a competitive binding site, as bacteria bind to it rather than the intestine and are carried out.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Griggs |first1=J.P. |last2=Jacob |first2=J.P. |title=Alternatives to Antibiotics for Organic Poultry Production |journal=Journal of Applied Poultry Research |date=December 2005 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=750–756 |doi=10.1093/japr/14.4.750}}</ref>

[[Bacteriophages]] are able to infect most bacteria and are easily found in most environments colonized by bacteria, and have been studied as well.<ref name=Allen/>

In another study it was found that using probiotics, competitive exclusion, enzymes, immunomodulators and organic acids prevents the spread of bacteria and can all be used in place of antibiotics.<ref>Doyle, M.E. 2001: Alternatives to Antibiotic Use for Growth Promotion in Animal Husbandry. Food Research Institute, University of Wisconsin-Madison.</ref> Another research team was able to use bacteriocins, antimicrobial peptides and bacteriophages in the control of bacterial infections.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Joerger R.D. | year = 2003 | title = Alternatives to antibiotics: bacteriocins, antimicrobial peptides and bacteriophages | journal = Poultry Science | volume = 82 | issue = 4| pages = 640–647 | doi=10.1093/ps/82.4.640| pmid = 12710486}}</ref> While further research is needed in this field, alternative methods have been identified in effectively controlling bacterial infections in animals. All of the alternative methods listed pose no known threat to human health and all can lead the elimination of antibiotics in factory farms. With further research it is highly likely that a cost-effective and health-effective alternative could and will be found.

Other alternatives include preventative approaches to keep the animals healthier and so reduce the need for antibiotics. These include improving the living conditions for animals, stimulating natural immunity through better nutrition, increasing biosecurity, implementing better management and hygiene practices, and ensuring better use of vaccination.<ref name=":1" />
