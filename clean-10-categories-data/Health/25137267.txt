{{short description|Autosomal recessive conditions that affect ethnic Jews more frequently}}
There are several [[autosomal recessive]] [[genetic disorders]] that are more common in ethnically [[Jewish]] populations, particularly [[Ashkenazi Jews]], than the population as a whole. This is due to [[population bottlenecks]] that occurred relatively recently in the past as well as a practice of [[consanguineous marriage]].<ref name=":0" /> These two phenomena lead to a decrease in genetic diversity and a higher likelihood that two parents will carry a mutation in the same gene and pass on both mutations to a child.

The genetics of Ashkenazi Jews have been particularly well-studied, as the phenomenon affects them the most. This has resulted in the discovery of many genetic disorders associated with this [[ethnic group]].<ref name="Rosner" /> In contrast, the medical genetics of [[Sephardic Jews]] and [[Mizrahi Jews]] are more complicated, since they are more genetically diverse, and consequently no genetic disorders are more common in these groups as a whole; instead, they tend to have the genetic diseases common in their various countries of origin.<ref name=Rosner/><ref name=Bloch>{{Cite news | first = Talia | last = Bloch | name-list-style = vanc  |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1109222.html |title=Sephardi Jews lack screening programs for their genetic diseases |work=Haaretz |date=August 21, 2009}}</ref>

==Genetics of Jewish populations==
{{further|Genetic studies on Jews}}
Different ethnic groups tend to suffer from different rates of hereditary diseases, with some being more common, and some less common. Hereditary diseases, particularly [[hemophilia]], were recognized early in [[Jewish history]], even being described in the [[Talmud]].<ref name=Levin/> However, the scientific study of hereditary disease in Jewish populations was initially hindered by [[scientific racism]], which was based on [[racial supremacism]].<ref name="Abel 2001 7">{{harvnb|Abel|2001|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bachrach S | title = In the name of public health--Nazi racial hygiene | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 351 | issue = 5 | pages = 417–20 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15282346 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp048136 }}</ref>

However, modern studies on the genetics of particular ethnic groups have the tightly defined purpose of avoiding the birth of children with genetic diseases, or identifying people at particular risk of developing a disease in the future.<ref name="Abel 2001 7"/> Consequently, some members of the Jewish community {{who|date=December 2018}} have been very supportive of modern genetic testing programs; this high level of cooperation has raised concerns that conclusions may lead to stigmatization of the Jewish community.<ref name=Levin>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levin M | title = Screening Jews and genes: a consideration of the ethics of genetic screening within the Jewish community: challenges and responses | journal = Genetic Testing | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 207–13 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10464669 | doi = 10.1089/gte.1999.3.207 }}</ref>

However, most populations contain hundreds of [[allele]]s that could potentially cause disease and most people are [[heterozygote]]s for one or two [[recessive]] alleles that would be lethal in a [[homozygote]].<ref name=Modell>{{cite journal | vauthors = Modell B, Darr A | title = Science and society: genetic counselling and customary consanguineous marriage | journal = Nature Reviews.

According to Daphna Birenbaum Carmeli at the [[University of Haifa]], Jewish populations have been studied thoroughly because:<ref name=Carmeli/>

* Jewish populations, and particularly the large Ashkenazi Jewish population, are ideal for such research studies, because they exhibit a high degree of [[endogamy]], and at the same time are a large group.
* Jewish populations are overwhelmingly urban and are concentrated near biomedical centers where such research has been carried out.

The result is a form of [[ascertainment bias]]. This has sometimes created an impression that Jews are more susceptible to genetic disease than other populations. Carmeli writes, "Jews are over-represented in human genetic literature, particularly in mutation-related contexts."<ref name=Carmeli>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carmeli DB | title = Prevalence of Jews as subjects in genetic research: figures, explanation, and potential implications | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics.

This set of advantages have led to Ashkenazi Jews in particular being used in many genetic studies, not just in the study of genetic diseases.

Ashkenazi Jews are also highly affected by other [[lysosomal storage disease]]s, particularly in the form of [[lipid storage disorder]]s. Compared to other ethnic groups, they more frequently act as carriers of [[mucolipidosis]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mssm.edu/jewish_genetics/diseases/mucolipidosis.shtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070217005259/http://www.mssm.edu/jewish_genetics/diseases/mucolipidosis.shtml | url-status = dead | archive-date = 17 February 2007 |title = Diseases: Mucolipidosis | work = Mount Sinai – Center for Jewish Genetic Diseases – Department of Human Genetics  }}</ref> and [[Niemann–Pick disease]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jewishgeneticscenter.org/what/ashkenazi/niemann.asp | title = Ashkenazi Disorders: Mendelian – Niemann–Pick disease | work = The Chicago Center for Jewish Genetic Disorders }}</ref> the latter of which can prove fatal.

===Familial dysautonomia===

[[Familial dysautonomia]] (Riley–Day syndrome), which causes [[vomiting]], speech problems, an inability to [[cry]], and false [[sensory perception]], is almost exclusive to Ashkenazi Jews;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jewishgeneticscenter.org/what/ashkenazi/familial.asp | title = Ashkenazi Disorders: Mendelian – Familial dysautonomia | work = The Chicago Center for Jewish Genetic Disorders }}</ref> Ashkenazi Jews are almost 100 times more likely to carry the disease than anyone else.<ref>about one in 30 Ashkenazi Jews carry the disease, compared to 1 in 3000 of the general population</ref>

The present-day frequency of the mutation in control populations (0.05% in Europeans, 0.5% in North-African Arabs and 1% in Ashkenazi Jews) may support this scenario".)<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lesage S, Patin E, Condroyer C, Leutenegger AL, Lohmann E, Giladi N, Bar-Shira A, Belarbi S, Hecham N, Pollak P, Ouvrard-Hernandez AM, Bardien S, Carr J, Benhassine T, Tomiyama H, Pirkevi C, Hamadouche T, Cazeneuve C, Basak AN, Hattori N, Dürr A, Tazir M, Orr-Urtreger A, Quintana-Murci L, Brice A | display-authors = 6 | title = Parkinson's disease-related LRRK2 G2019S mutation results from independent mutational events in humans | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = 10 | pages = 1998–2004 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20197411 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddq081 | author26 = French Parkinson's Disease Genetics Study Group | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimprich A, Biskup S, Leitner P, Lichtner P, Farrer M, Lincoln S, Kachergus J, Hulihan M, Uitti RJ, Calne DB, Stoessl AJ, Pfeiffer RF, Patenge N, Carbajal IC, Vieregge P, Asmus F, Müller-Myhsok B, Dickson DW, Meitinger T, Strom TM, Wszolek ZK, Gasser T | display-authors = 6 | title = Mutations in LRRK2 cause autosomal-dominant parkinsonism with pleomorphic pathology | journal = Neuron | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 601–7 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15541309 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2004.11.005 | quote = We have previously linked families with autosomal-dominant, late-onset parkinsonism to chromosome 12p11.2-q13.1 (PARK8)... }}</ref>

==Non-Ashkenazi disorders==
In contrast to the Ashkenazi population, [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Mizrahi Jews]] are much more divergent groups, with ancestors from Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Italy, Libya, the Balkans, Iran, Iraq, India, and Yemen, with specific genetic disorders found in each regional group, or even in specific subpopulations in these regions.<ref name=Rosner>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosner G, Rosner S, Orr-Urtreger A | title = Genetic testing in Israel: an overview | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 10 | pages = 175–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19453249 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.030308.111406 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/26ed6960f072f01e7281041f143fee9064e30798 }}</ref>

==Genetic testing in Jewish populations==

One of the first [[genetic testing]] programs to identify [[heterozygote]] carriers of a genetic disorder was a program aimed at eliminating Tay–Sachs disease. This program began in 1970, and over one million people have now been screened for the mutation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaback MM | title = Population-based genetic screening for reproductive counseling: the Tay-Sachs disease model | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 159 Suppl 3 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = S192-5 | date = December 2000 | pmid = 11216898 | doi = 10.1007/PL00014401 }}</ref> Identifying carriers and counseling couples on reproductive options have had a large impact on the incidence of the disease, with a decrease from 40–50 per year worldwide to only four or five per year.<ref name=Ostrer/> Screening programs now test for several genetic disorders in Jews, although these focus on the Ashkenazi Jews, since other Jewish groups cannot be given a single set of tests for a common set of disorders.<ref name=Bloch/> In the US, these screening programs have been widely accepted by the Ashkenazi community, and have greatly reduced the frequency of the disorders.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kronn D, Jansen V, Ostrer H | title = Carrier screening for cystic fibrosis, Gaucher disease, and Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population: the first 1000 cases at New York University Medical Center, New York, NY | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 158 | issue = 7 | pages = 777–81 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9554684 | doi = 10.1001/archinte.158.7.777 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Prenatal testing for several genetic diseases is offered as commercial panels for Ashkenazi couples by both [[CIGNA]] and [[Quest Diagnostics]].  The CIGNA panel is available for testing for parental/preconception screening or following chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis and tests for Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, familial dysautonomia, Fanconi anemia, Gaucher disease, mucolipidosis IV, Neimann-Pick disease type A, Tay-Sachs disease, and torsion dystonia.  The Quest panel is for parental/preconception testing and tests for Bloom syndrome, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, familial dysautonomia, Fanconi anemia group C, Gaucher disease, Neimann-Pick disease types A and B, and Tay-Sachs disease.

The official recommendations of the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] is that Ashkenazi individuals be offered screening for Tay-Sachs disease, Canavan disease, cystic fibrosis, and familial dysautonomia as part of routine obstetrical care.<ref>{{cite journal | author = ACOG committee on genetics | title = ACOG Committee Opinion No. 442: Preconception and prenatal carrier screening for genetic diseases in individuals of Eastern European Jewish descent | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 114 | issue = 4 | pages = 950–3 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19888064 | doi = 10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181bd12f4 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c09469d17dba778bcad4e7239d7947c36139de78 }}</ref>

In the [[Orthodox Judaism|orthodox community]], an organization called [[Dor Yeshorim]] carries out anonymous genetic screening of couples before marriage to reduce the risk of children with genetic diseases being born.<ref name=Ekstein>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ekstein J, Katzenstein H | title = The Dor Yeshorim story: community-based carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease | volume = 44 | pages = 297–310 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11596991 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2660(01)44087-9 | isbn = 978-0-12-017644-1 | series = Advances in Genetics }}</ref> The program educates young people on medical genetics and screens school-aged children for any disease genes. These results are then entered into an anonymous database, identified only by a unique ID number given to the person who was tested. If two people are considering getting married, they call the organization and tell them their ID numbers. The organization then tells them if they are genetically compatible.  It is not divulged if one member is a carrier, so as to protect the carrier and his or her family from stigmatization.<ref name=Ekstein/> However, this program has been criticized for exerting social pressure on people to be tested, and for screening for a broad range of recessive genes, including disorders such as Gaucher disease.<ref name=Kolata/>
