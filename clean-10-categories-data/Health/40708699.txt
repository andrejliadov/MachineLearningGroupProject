'''All-payer rate setting''' is a price setting mechanism in which all third parties pay the same price for services at a given hospital.<ref name=mhc/> It can be used to increase the [[market power]] of payers (such as private and/or public insurance companies) versus providers, such as [[hospital system]]s, in order to control costs. All-payer characteristics are found in most developed economies with [[multi-payer healthcare]] systems, including [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], and the [[Netherlands]].<ref name="White">{{cite web |url=http://policy.case.edu/White_Payer.pdf|title=Cost Control and Health Care Reform â€” The Case for All-Payer Regulation |author=Joseph White |date=May 12, 2009}}</ref> The [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]] also uses such a model.<ref name=mhc>{{cite web|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140110/INFO/301109986 |title=Maryland receives OK for healthcare overhaul that caps hospital spending |publisher=Modern Healthcare |date=2012-02-06 |accessdate=2014-01-10}}</ref>

All-payer rate setting have been proposed in the United States as a [[Healthcare reform in the United States|healthcare reform]] measure. The proposal for a [[public option]] (a voluntary, publicly sponsored insurance plan similar to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]) has been cited as indirectly sharing some of the same goals as all-payer rate-setting systems.<ref name="White"/>

{{Main article|Maryland hospital payment system}}

Since the late 1970s, Maryland has operated an all-payer system for hospital services. An independent commission establishes the rate structure for each hospital. That eliminated hospital cost shifting across payers and spread more equitably the costs of uncompensated care and medical education and limited cost growth, but [[per capita]] Medicare hospital costs are among the country's highest.<ref name=nejm1401>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1314868| title = Maryland's All-Payer Approach to Delivery-System Reform| year = 2014| last1 = Rajkumar | first1 = R. | last2 = Patel | first2 = A. | last3 = Murphy | first3 = K. | last4 = Colmers | first4 = J.

[[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]'s participation in the system is authorized by the [[Social Security Act]], is tied to a growth limit in payment per admission, and entitles the state's hospitals to $2 billion per year in additional revenues from the federal government.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pope|first=Chris|date=2019-06-07|title=When Government Sets Hospital Prices: Maryland's Experience|url=https://www.manhattan-institute.org/medicare-for-all-maryland-hospital-healthcare-price-regulation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-18|website=Manhattan Institute|language=en}}</ref> The Medicare waiver created incentives to increase the volume of services.

On January 10, 2014, the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) and the State announced a new model that will focus on overall per capita expenditures for hospital services as well as on improvements in the quality of care and population health outcomes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Equalizing Health Provider Rates: All-Payer Rate Setting|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|url=https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/equalizing-health-provider-rates-all-payer-rate.aspx}}</ref> For 5 years beginning in 2014, Maryland will limit the growth of per capita hospital costs to the lesser of 3.58% or 0.5% less than the actual national growth rate for 2015 through 2018. The change is forecast to save Medicare at least $330 million. 3.58% is Maryland's historical 10-year growth rate of per capita gross state product.<ref name=nejm1401/>
