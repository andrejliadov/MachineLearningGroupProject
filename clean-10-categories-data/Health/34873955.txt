'''Drunk walking''' describes people intoxicated by [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] walking in public spaces. Whereas there are long standing social stigmas and laws against drunk driving, only more recently have the personal and social dangers of drunk walking become apparent. Pedestrians under the influence of alcohol may be less likely to use crosswalks and more likely to cross against the traffic lights. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} Alcohol use is connected to more serious injuries with longer hospital stays if a pedestrian is hit by a vehicle.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Josh|title=When drunk walking is outlawed, only outlaws will walk drunk|journal=The Works|date=February 9, 2015|url=http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/drunk-walking-illegal-pedestrian-safety|access-date=3 April 2015}}</ref>
