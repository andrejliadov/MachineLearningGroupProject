The '''Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics''' is the [[United States]]' largest organization of [[food]] and [[nutrition]] professionals, and represents over 100,000 credentialed practitioners — registered dietitian nutritionists, dietetic technicians, registered, and other dietetics professionals holding undergraduate and advanced degrees in nutrition and dietetics. After nearly 100 years as the '''American Dietetic Association''', the organization officially changed its name to the '''Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics''' in 2012.<ref name="eatright">[http://www.eatright.org/ Eat Right].

==Origins==
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics was founded in 1917 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], by a group of women led by [[Lenna F. Cooper]] and the Academy's first president, [[Lulu G. Graves]], who were dedicated to helping the government conserve food and improve [[public health]] during [[World War I]].<ref name=historyofadabook>Barber, Mary I. ''[https://archive.org/details/historyofamerica0000barb History of the American Dietetic Association, 1917-1959]''.

February 27, 1978.</ref>

The original mission of the Academy was in part to help make maximal use of America's food resources during wartime.<ref name=cnnfoodindustry>Foer, Jonathan Safran.

''Eat Right''. April 7, 2009.</ref> It remained a small organization, remaining under the 1,000 member mark until the 1930s.<ref name=adamilestone/> As the group's scope expanded, so did its membership numbers. Between the 1930s and 1960s, membership skyrocketed to more than 60,000.<ref name=adamilestone/> Growth trajectory has since stabilized, and the Academy marked its 70,000th member when a female dietitian in Texas rejoined the Academy in May 2009.<ref name=adamilestone/> Since its founding in 1917, the Academy has gained members in every decade.<ref name=adamilestone/>

[[File:Academy-of-Nutrition-and-Dietetics-Seal.jpg|thumb|right|Current Seal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]]
An authorized seal for the organization was adopted by the Executive Board and presented to members on October 24, 1940.<ref name=seal>{{cite web|title=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Timeline|url=http://www.eatrightpro.org/history-timeline|website=eatrightPRO.org|accessdate=17 January 2017}}</ref> At its center are symbols of the three main characteristics of the profession: a balance scale, representing science as the foundation and symbolizing equality; a caduceus, representing the close relationship between dietetics and medicine; and a cooking vessel, representing cookery and food preparation. Around the main design is a shaft of wheat, representing bread, the staff of life, and stylized acanthus leaves, representing growth and life. Over the design is a cornucopia, representing an abundant food supply. Beneath the design is the motto, Quam Plurimis Prodesse ("To benefit as many as possible"). Around the edge is the name of the organization and the date of its founding written in Roman numerals.

The seal is still in use on Registration Status Certificates for both registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, as well as on the gold Member Pin.

According to current Academy president Sylvia Escott Stump, the group changed their name to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics in 2012 to reflect the scientific and academic expertise of its members.<ref>Stein, Jeannine.

===Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Foundation===
In 1966, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics established its Foundation as a [[501(c)(3)]] public charity devoted exclusively to nutrition and dietetics. The Foundation is the world's largest provider of dietetic scholarships at all levels of study with other programs including awards, research grants, fellowships, public education programs and disaster relief efforts.

The Foundation shares a vision with the Academy: A world where all people thrive through the transformative power of food and nutrition. The Foundation's mission is: "Through philanthropy, empower current and future food and nutrition practitioners to optimize global health".<ref>{{cite web |title=FAND |url=http://www.eatrightFoundation.org |website=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Foundation}}</ref>

Funding for various programs, funds, scholarships, initiatives and grants of the Foundation are raised by Academy members; giving societies; legacy, matching and tribute donations; program fees and offerings; and gifts, sponsorships and grants from for-profit and nonprofit organizations. The Foundation was given a four-star overall rating by [[Charity Navigator|CharityNavigator.org]] in 2018 based on data from fiscal year 2017.<ref name=charitynav>[http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=8467 American Dietetic Association Foundation].

===Research and Publications===
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics publishes position papers on public health regarding [[pediatric]] ([[children]]'s) health, [[food technology]], [[food safety]], [[geriatrics]] ([[elderly]]) health, [[Health care politics|health-care reform]], [[obesity]] and food and nutrition topics through the ''[[Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]]'' (''ANDJ'').<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Journal|url=http://www.andjrnl.org/aims|accessdate=31 May 2012}}</ref>

In the 1980s, the Academy published the magazine Food/2 which had originally been created by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]. In response pressure from meat, egg, and dairy industries, the Department of Agriculture decided not publish it, after which the Academy negotiated with the government to publish it itself, omitting the controversial chapters on [[fat]] and [[cholesterol]].<ref name=nytimesmagazine>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/19/garden/magazine-withheld-by-us-may-revive.html MAGAZINE WITHHELD BY U.S. MAY REVIVE].

==Certification==
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics certification process offers two career options: Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) and Nutrition and Dietetics Technician, Registered (NDTR). Both are educated nutrition professionals qualified to work in hospitals, academia and private practice, and differ mostly in the hours of training and level of college degree required. A Registered Dietitian Nutritionist must complete a bachelor's degree or higher and more than 900 hours of training, while a Dietetic Technician is required to complete and associate level degree and 450 hours of training.<ref name=llu>[http://www.llu.edu/allied-health/nutrition/faqs.page Frequently Asked Questions]. “What is the difference between a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) and a Nutrition Dietetic Technician, Registered (NDTR) and what career opportunities are available for each?” (Information is provided by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics FAQs web page)</ref> About 72% of the Academy's members are Registered Dietitian Nutritionists, and 2% are Nutrition Dietetic Technicians, Registered.<ref name="about"/> Members are granted these accredited titles by fulfilling the Academy's strenuous certification requirements in addition to any state or local regulations. Through its ADAF foundation, the Academy issued nearly $500,000 in certification scholarships in 2011, $100,000 of which went to doctoral students.<ref name="2015report"/>

The terms “Registered Dietitian Nutritionist” and “Nutrition Dietetic Technician, Registered” are “legally protected titles” and can be used only by someone who has completed coursework approved by the Academy.<ref>[http://www.eatright.org/ACEND/content.aspx?id=146#Mike_1 What is the difference between a registered dietitian or dietetic technician, registered, and a nutritionist?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213061523/http://www.eatright.org/ACEND/content.aspx?id=146#Mike_1 |date=2012-12-13 }} ''EatRight.org''. “Registered dietitian or RD and dietetic technician, registered or DTR can only be used by dietetics practitioners who are currently authorized to use the credential by the Commission on Dietetic Registration of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Approximately 50% of RDs hold advanced degrees. Some RDNs also hold additional certifications in specialized areas of practice, such as pediatric or renal nutrition, nutrition support and diabetes education.<ref name=about/> In addition to any Academy requirements (and often with some overlap), many states have laws for dietitians and nutrition practitioners.<ref name=eatrightmedia>[http://www.eatright.org/Media/content.aspx?id=6442467510 What Is the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511125045/http://www.eatright.org/Media/content.aspx?id=6442467510 |date=2012-05-11 }}.

===Nutrition Dietetic Technician, Registered (NDTR)===
According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, NDTRs are "a food and nutrition practitioner" who has fulfilled the minimum requirements for the title NDTR.<ref name=llu/>

These requirements, while similar to an RD, differ in that they require:
* A minimum of an [[Associate of Science|Associate's]] degree.
* At least 450 hours of supervised practice accredited by ACEND.
* Successful pass a national DTR examination administered by CDR.
* Complete continuing professional educational requirements to maintain registration.

NDTR's typically work closely with RD in numerous employment settings such as hospitals, health care facilities, private practice, day care centers, correctional facilities and weight loss centers.<ref name=llu/> The Academy application fee to become an NDTR is $120.<ref>[http://www.nutritionist-world.com/ADA_registered_dietitian_regs.html National Requirements to Become a Registered Dietitian from the American Dietetic Association's (ADA) Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR)].

==Awards==
The Academy gives several awards, of which the highest is the '''Marjorie Hulsizer Copher Award''', named for American dietitian [[Marjorie Hulsizer Copher]] (1892-1935) and given annually since 1945 to a member who "has contributed to the profession through extensive, active participation and service to the profession of nutrition and dietetics, both within and outside of the Academy". As of 2020, the award, which is the "highest honor the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics bestows on one of its members," has still never been given to a Black nutrition professional.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.eatrightpro.org/leadership/honors-and-awards/national-honors-and-awards/marjorie-hulsizer-copher-award | title=Marjorie Hulsizer Copher Award| publisher= Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics| access-date=18 January 2019}}</ref> Other awards include the '''Lenna Frances Cooper Memorial Lecture Award''', named for American dietitian [[Lenna Frances Cooper]] and given to " a notable and inspiring speaker" who presents the memorial lecture.<ref name="cooper">{{cite web |title=Lenna Frances Cooper Memorial Lecture Award |url=https://www.eatrightpro.org/leadership/honors-and-awards/national-honors-and-awards/lenna-frances-cooper-memorial-lecture-award |publisher=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics |accessdate=18 January 2019}}</ref> In 2019, the Academy introduced the Excellence in Diversity and Inclusion Promotion Award in an effort to "recognizes a member who has demonstrated excellence in innovation, creativity, and leadership in the promotion of diversity and inclusion."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: National Honors and Awards|url=https://www.eatrightpro.org/leadership/honors-and-awards/national-honors-and-awards|website=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics}}</ref> In 2020, the Excellence in Diversity and Inclusion Promotion Award was given to Dr. Bruce D.

Of the 22 awardees, two were RDNs of color and zero recipients were Black.<ref name=":0" />

==Lobbying efforts and competitive protections==
To help better communications with the US government, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has offices in [[Washington, DC]]. They also operate their own [[political action committee]], the Academy's Political Action Committee.<ref name="2015report"/> The Academy spent $5.8 million lobbying at the state and national level from 2000–2010.<ref name=opensecrets>[http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000023948&year=2010 American Dietetic Assn]. ''Open Secrets''.</ref>

A 1985 report noted the Academy has supported licensing for dispensing nutritional advice.<ref name=washingtonpostlicensing>Sugarman, Carole. "Licensing Nutrition Advisers." ''[[The Washington Post]]'' via [http://www.lexisnexis.com LexisNexis]. May 5, 1985. "And they want to make it illegal for individuals to offer nutrition advice without proper credentials [...] According to Catherine Babington, director of government affairs of the American Dietetic Association, dietitians in 36 states are pursuing mandatory licensure, although details of the proposed laws vary from state to state. A bill awaits the governor's signature in Maryland, while dietetic associations in Virginia and the District of Columbia are in the beginning stages of drafting such bills. [...] Opponents such as the National Health Federation, chaired by Donsbach, and the National Nutritional Foods Association, which represents more than 3,500 health food stores, contend that highly restrictive bills could create a monopoly for one school of traditional nutrition thought, limiting the free market and consumer choice, and that their primary intent is not to protect the public, but to give clout and recognition to a single segment of dietitians, increasing their chances of obtaining reimbursement from insurance companies."</ref> In addition to supporting legislation regulating the professional nutrition field in states like [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Hawaii]], [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], the Academy has also applied for patents for its certification titles such as: "Certified Nutrition Coach," "Certified Nutrition Professional," "Registered Nutrition Professional," and "Certified Nutrition Educator."<ref name=forbesellsberg/><ref name=wyomingdetective>[http://www.wyomingdieteticassociation.com/rd_licensure.asp RD Licensure]. ''Wyoming Dietetic Association''.</ref> The Academy states that by regulating who can provide nutritional counseling, they can protect their registered members and the public from unregulated advice or possibly inaccurate advice from less qualified dietary practitioners such as [[chiropractors]], [[yoga|yoga instructors]], [[homeopaths]], and [[personal trainers]].<ref name=forbesellsberg/> The Academy's support of this legislation has generated strong opposition from [[alternative medicine|alternative health practitioners]] and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] groups, who state that "highly restrictive bills could create a monopoly for one school of traditional nutrition thought" and that the primary intent of the bill is "not to protect the public, but to give clout and recognition to a single segment of dietitians, increasing their chances of obtaining reimbursement from insurance companies."<ref name=forbesellsberg/><ref name=washingtonpostlicensing/>

==Kids Eat Right==
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the ADA Foundation launched their first joint initiative, Kids Eat Right, in November 2010. This member-driven campaign is dedicated to supporting the efforts of the White House to end the childhood obesity epidemic within a generation.<ref name="eatrightobama"/> Kids Eat Right is a two-tiered campaign aimed to mobilize Academy members to participate in community and school childhood obesity prevention efforts, and also to educate families, communities, and policy makers about the importance of quality nutrition.

Kids Eat Right has a website that gives families healthy eating tips, articles, videos, and recipes from registered dietitians.<ref>[http://www.newswise.com/articles/school-s-out-help-your-kids-eat-right-all-summer-long School's Out! Help Your Kids Eat Right All Summer Long]. ''NewsWire''. May 24, 2011.</ref> Kids Eat Right also has scientifically-based health information centered around the theme "Shop-Cook-Eat" which has information about how to shop for healthy foods, how to cook foods with the most nutrient value, and gives the benefits of eating together at home and away from home.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eatright.org/kids/content.aspx?id=6442459728 |title=Kids Eat Right - About Kids Eat Right<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2012-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902230526/http://www.eatright.org/kids/content.aspx?id=6442459728 |archive-date=2012-09-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Controversies==
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has been criticized for its connections to the [[pharmaceutical industry]], including an inquiry from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Chuck Grassley]].<ref>[http://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/Article.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1502=34350  Grassley renews call for voluntary disclosure by influential disease and medical advocacy groups] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721043801/http://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/Article.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1502=34350 |date=2012-07-21}}.

December 18, 2009.</ref>

In 1982, the organization faced mass resignations from members over a decision to support President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s cuts in [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] and [[school lunch program]]s.<ref name="nytimesmagazine"/> The decision was largely a political trade-off; the Reagan administration agreed to drop its proposal to deregulate nursing homes in exchange for the Academy's support of the school lunch and food stamp cuts.<ref name=nytimesmagazine/>

===Criticism of partnerships with food companies===
A 1995 report, noted the Academy received funding from companies like [[McDonald's]], [[PepsiCo]], [[The Coca-Cola Company]], [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], [[Abbott Nutrition]], [[General Mills]], [[Kellogg's]], [[Mars Inc.|Mars]], [[McNeil Nutritionals]], [[Pharmavite|SOYJOY]], [[Truvia]], [[Unilever]], and The [[Sugar Association]] as corporate sponsorship.<ref name=milwaukeejournal/><ref name=NYT_spending>{{Cite web|url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/28/coke-spends-lavishly-on-pediatricians-and-dietitians/|title=Coke Spends Lavishly on Pediatricians and Dietitians|first=Anahad|last=O'Connor|date=September 28, 2015}}</ref> The Academy also partners with [[ConAgra Foods]], which produces [[Orville Redenbacker]], [[Slim Jim (snack food)|Slim Jims]], [[Hunt's|Hunt's Ketchup]], [[Hunt's Snack Pack|SnackPacks]], and [[Hebrew National|Hebrew National hot dogs]], to maintain the American Dietetic Association/ConAgra Foods Home Food Safety...It's in Your Hands program.<ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20051110005755/en/Timely-Turkey-Tips-Buying-Baking-American-Dietetic Timely Turkey Tips from Buying to Baking; American Dietetic Association/ConAgra Foods offer Home Food Safety Help for Thanksgiving Cooks]. ''Business Wire''.

March 18, 2008.</ref>

In April 2013, a dietitian working on a panel charged with setting policy on [[genetically modified foods]] for the academy contended she was removed for pointing out that two of its members had ties to [[Monsanto]], one of the biggest makers of [[genetically modified seeds]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/business/a-dismissal-raises-questions-about-objectivity-on-food-policy.html|title=A Dismissal Raises Questions About Objectivity on Food Policy|first=Stephanie|last=Strom|date=April 10, 2013|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>  The resulting controversy highlighted the fact that Ms. Smith Edge, chairwoman of the committee charged with developing the GMO policy, is a senior vice president at the [[International Food Information Council]], which is largely financed by food, beverage and agriculture businesses, including companies like [[DuPont]], [[Bayer CropScience]] and [[Cargill]], companies that were among the biggest financial opponents of a [[State of California GMO labeling initiative]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/food/2013/04/gmo-dieticians-monsanto-california/|title=Will Monsanto Ties Influence Nutritionists' Stance on GMOs?}}</ref>

The Academy maintains that being at the "same table" with food companies is important in order to exert a positive influence over their products and message, although critics describe this as an “unhealthy alliance” between the Academy and [[junk food]] companies.<ref name="thedailygreen"/><ref name="fooducate">{{cite web|url=http://www.fooducate.com/blog/2010/08/01/ada-response-to-accusations-on-partnership-with-hershey/ |title=ADA Response to Accusations on Partnership with Hershey |publisher=Fooducate |date=2010-08-01 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}</ref> The accusation is that despite what good may come of such programs, it ultimately [[whitewash]]es (similar to the [[greenwashing]] efforts of environmentally irresponsible companies) the brand's role in the country's food ecosystem. Watchdogs note that the Academy rarely criticizes food companies, believing it to be out of fear of "biting the hand that feeds them."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rampton |first1=Sheldon | author1-link = Sheldon Rampton|last2=Stauber|first2=John | author2-link =John Stauber|year=2001 |title=Trust Us, We're Experts!: How Industry Manipulates Science and Gambles With Your Future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_OEPBt16JscC&q=%22never+criticize+the+food+industry%22++Joan+Gussow&pg=PT143|isbn=9781101144060 }}</ref><ref name="PR Watch">[http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/2000Q4/dairy.html Who Is the Dairy Coalition?

In March 2015, Academy had endorsed Kraft Singles cheese product with the 'Kids Eat Right' label.

The organization also publishes nutrition facts sheets for the general public, which food companies pay $20,000 to take part in writing the documents.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Perils of Ignoring History: Big Tobacco Played Dirty and Millions Died.

This industry funding also gives food companies the ability to offer official educational seminars to teach dietitians how to advise their clients in a way that advances the interests of the food company. For instance, in a [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] sponsored seminar for dietitians, the speaker promoted free sugars consumption for children as a healthy choice.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.eatdrinkpolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/AND_Corporate_Sponsorship_Report.pdf|title = And Now a Word From Our Sponsors: Are America's Nutrition Professionals in the Pocket of Big Food?|date = January 2013|accessdate = 11 November 2015|website = Eat Drink Politics|publisher = Eat Drink Politics|last = Simon|first = Michele}}</ref>

=== Criticism of racism and lack of diversity ===
The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has been criticized for its lack of racial/ethnic diversity and lack of response to address the concerns of Academy members of color. According to the Commission on Dietetic Registration’s demographic data as of October 2020, 78% of RDNs identified as White, while 2.6% identified as Black or African American, 3.3% as Hispanic or Latinx, 3.9% as Asian, 1.1% as Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander, 0.3% as American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 0.6% as Two or more races.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Registry Statistics - Commission on Dietetic Registration|url=https://www.cdrnet.org/registry-statistics?id=2579&actionxm=ByDemographics|access-date=2020-10-25|website=www.cdrnet.org}}</ref> These demographics reflect an underrepresentation of all minority racial/ethnic groups and an overrepresentation of white dietitians in the profession when compared to the racial/ethnic demographics obtained from the US Census. Black, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, Native American, Pacific Islanders, and mixed race people make up 40% of the United States population,<ref>{{Cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: United States|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219|access-date=2020-10-25|website=www.census.gov|language=en}}</ref> yet these communities make up only 11.8% of registered dietitians in the US.<ref name=":1" />

The Academy has been made aware of this issue for many years. In 1984, the Academy (then called the ADA) commissioned a study on the health care of minorities and released the findings in its report, ''A New Look at the Profession of Dietetics.'' In 1987, the Academy developed its first Minority Recruitment and Retention Plan and in 1992 appointed a House of Delegates Affirmative Action Committee, later renamed the Diversity Committee. In 1996 the Diversity Committee drafted a diversity philosophy statement and included ‘diversity’ as a component in its 1996-1999 Strategic Framework plan. Despite the Academy's awareness of the problem and statements of support, little progress has been made in diversifying the profession in the past 35 years, as evidenced by the continued underrepresentation of all racial/ethnic minority groups in demographic data.<ref name=":1" />
