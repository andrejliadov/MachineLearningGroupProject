'''Micropore particle technology''' consists of fine, highly porous particles that remove fluid by a combination of [[capillary action]] and [[evaporation]].<ref>{{Cite journal |title=The use of a micropore particle technology in the treatment of acute wounds |journal = Journal of Wound Care|volume = 26|issue = 7|last=Ryan |first=E. |date=2017-07-02 |location=US |pages=404–413 |language=en-US |doi=10.12968/jowc.2017.26.7.404 |pmid=28704154 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318416898 |title=The use of a micropore particle technology in the treatment of acute wounds |journal=Journal of Wound Care |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=404–413 |language=en |access-date=2019-02-08|doi=10.12968/jowc.2017.26.7.404 |pmid=28704154 |year=2017 |last1=Ryan |first1=E. }}</ref> Currently, they are mainly used in wound healing, where they absorb wound exudate into their [[micropore]] structure. Here capillary flow transports the exudate away from the wound surface towards the upper surface of the MPPT layer, where a highly expanded surface area facilitates effective evaporation. The MPPT essentially acts as small micro-pumps, which, due to their small size, are able to access all crevices in the wound surface.<ref name=SamsDodd>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sams-Dodd J, Sams-Dodd F |title=Time to Abandon Antimicrobial Approaches in Wound Healing: A Paradigm Shift |journal=Wounds |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=345–352 |date=November 2018 |pmid=30418163 |doi= |url=}}</ref>

The micro-pumping action of the particles appears to disrupt the weaponry used by bacteria and fungi against the [[immune system]]. First, the [[Toxin|toxins]] and [[enzymes]] released by [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]] against the [[White blood cell|immune cells]] are removed, whereby the immune cells regain their function. Second, the micropumping action creates holes in the surface of biofilm. Biofilm acts as a shield that bacteria and fungi secrete to protect themselves against the immune cells. By creating holes in this shield, the immune cells become able to enter the biofilm layer and selectively remove bacteria and fungi that they do not want to be present. The result is that the immune system is able to remove an infection in a wound or on the skin. MPPT, therefore, functions as passive [[immunotherapy]]. It has no antibacterial effects, but it can remove antibiotic-resistant infections and it will not contribute to the creation of new antimicrobial resistance.<ref name=SamsDodd />

== Effects of MPPT on wound healing ==
MPPT has been evaluated in a preclincial wound healing model <ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bilyayeva|first1=O|last2=Neshta|first2=VV|last3=Golub|first3=A|last4=Sams-Dodd|first4=F |date=2014 |title=Effects of SertaSil on wound healing in the rat|journal=Journal of Wound Care|volume=23|issue=8|pages=410, 412–414, 415–416|pmid=25139599|doi=10.12968/jowc.2014.23.8.410}}</ref> and in a 266 patient comparative clinical study, which included a wide range of wound types.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bilyayeva|first1=OO |last2=Neshta|first2=VV|last3=Golub|first3=AA|last4=Sams-Dodd|first4=F|date=2017|title=Comparative Clinical Study of the Wound Healing Effects of a Novel Micropore Particle Technology: Effects on Wounds, Venous Leg Ulcers, and Diabetic Foot Ulcers|journal=Wounds: A Compendium of Clinical Research and Practice|volume=29|issue=8|pages=1–9|issn=1943-2704|pmid=28570251}}</ref> The study found that MPPT reduced the time to achieving an infection-free and healing wound by 60% compared to a topical [[antibiotic]] (genamicin) and to the [[antiseptic]] iodine. MPPT also reduced the number of hospitalisation days by 31% compared to the antibiotic. 

At Bristol University Hospital, MPPT was evaluated for use on wounds. The study included nine [[Wound dehiscence|dehisced surgical wound]]s and one category 4 [[pressure ulcer]]. Standard-of-care for these types of wounds are one week with UrgoClean followed by 2 or more weeks with [[Negative-pressure wound therapy|Negative Pressure Wound Therapy]] (NPWT). Wounds receiving MPPT were able to achieve the same stage of wound healing in 4-5 days as would have required 3 or more weeks with standard-of-care, thus offering savings of 67%. All wounds receiving MPPT closed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=E|date=2017|title=The use of a micropore particle technology in the treatment of acute wounds |journal=Journal of Wound Care|volume=26|issue=7|pages=404–413|doi=10.12968/jowc.2017.26.7.404|issn=0969-0700|pmid=28704154}}</ref>

MPPT has also been used on [[Diabetic foot ulcer|diabetic foot ulcers]] and [[Venous ulcer|venous leg ulcers]], including ulcers that were chronic and non-healing and in all cases it has been able to promote healing. MPPT has also been used on pressure ulcers, including chronic non-healing ulcers and was in a similar manner able to promote healing.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Time to Abandon Antimicrobial Approaches in Wound Healing: A Paradigm Shift|first1=Jeanette|last1=Sams-Dodd|first2=Frank|last2=Sams-Dodd|journal=Wounds|date=2018|volume=30|issue=11|pages=345–352|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/904991|pmid=30418163}}</ref>

A poster was recently presented by the Birmingham University Hospitals at the British Association of Dermatologists, which showed that MPPT was able to assist the healing of 3 chronic, stable [[pyoderma gangrenosum]] ulcers.<ref>British Association of Dermatology, Annual meeting, Edinburgh July 3-5, 2018., Abstract BI22.</ref> In one patient, it was possible to reduce the dose of [[Immunosuppressive drug|immunosuppressant]]. These findings extend the use of MPPT into dermatology and positive effects have been observed in [[hidradenitis suppurativa]].

The MPPT technology has been approved in the EU as a "treatment for wounds" and is currently the only wound product with this approval. Other medical devices for wounds are approved to have a certain effect on the wound, e.g. add moisture or remove wound exudate, but they are not recognised as treatments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://willingsford.com/about/news/|title=News – Willingsford Healthcare|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref>
