== Risk factors ==
[[Heat illness|Heat-related illnesses]] from occupational heat stress is impacted by multiple factors. Workers exposed to high temperatures, [[humidity]], and limited air movement, especially outside workers, are vulnerable to heat illness.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":02">{{Cite web|last=CDC|date=2020-08-31|title=NIOSH Heat Stress Topic Page|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/default.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us}}</ref> [[Physiology|Physiologic]] factors can also impact a worker's vulnerability, specifically if their job requires physical exertion, which produces [[Metabolism|metabolic heat]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Heat Stress in the Workplace {{!}} Environmental Health and Safety {{!}} Iowa State University|url=https://www.ehs.iastate.edu/services/occupational/heat-stress/workplace|access-date=2020-11-10|website=www.ehs.iastate.edu}}</ref> Workers can also be more vulnerable to heat illness if they are [[Dehydration|dehydrated]] from [[Perspiration|sweating]] and not drinking enough water or have a low level of [[physical fitness]].<ref name=":02" /> Certain medications can also make it more difficult for someone to adapt to high temperatures, such as some common [[Antibiotic|antibiotics]], as well as some diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and [[Psychiatric medication|psychiatric]] medications.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Publishing|first=Harvard Health|title=10 types of medications that should keep you in the shade this summer|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/skin-and-hair/10-types-of-medications|access-date=2020-11-11|website=Harvard Health}}</ref> Workers who have [[Cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular diseases]], [[Respiratory disease|respiratory illnesses]], [[diabetes]], [[hypertension]], or [[obesity]], or who are currently [[Pregnancy|pregnant]], are also at higher risk for heat illness.<ref name=":02" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kenny|first1=Glen P.|last2=Yardley|first2=Jane|last3=Brown|first3=Candice|last4=Sigal|first4=Ronald J.|last5=Jay|first5=Ollie|date=2010-07-13|title=Heat stress in older individuals and patients with common chronic diseases|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=182|issue=10|pages=1053–1060|doi=10.1503/cmaj.081050|issn=0820-3946|pmc=2900329|pmid=19703915}}</ref> Additionally, wearing heavy or thick [[personal protective equipment]] and clothing can prevent workers from [[sweating]] properly, which prevents the body from effectively cooling.<ref name=":22">{{Cite web|date=2020-02-20|title=Heat Stress Recommendations {{!}} NIOSH {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/recommendations.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}}</ref> Workers can also adjust to working in high temperatures so their bodies can become better at cooling over time, though this adjustment requires a multi-week [[acclimatization]] process. 

=== Acclimatization ===
According to the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), [[acclimatization]] is a biological process that an individual will go through to adjust to a stimulus following continued exposure.<ref name=":03">{{Cite web|date=2020-02-20|title=Heat Stress Acclimatization {{!}} NIOSH {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/acclima.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}}</ref> Physiologically, acclimatization to heat will allow a worker’s body to more efficiently cool itself when exposed to high temperatures. When a worker has adjusted to working in a hotter environment, they will have a lower [[heart rate]], earlier onset of [[Perspiration|sweating]], and increased blood flow to blood [[Blood vessel|vessels]] near the skin, allowing their body to more efficiently cool itself than a worker who is not acclimatized.<ref name=":03" /><ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|date=2016-02-01|title=Criteria for a recommended standard: occupational exposure to heat and hot environments - revised criteria 2016.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2016-106/|language=en|doi=10.26616/nioshpub2016106}}</ref> See below section on [[#Acclimatization Schedules|acclimatization schedules]] for specific processes.[[File:Residential construction worker (9256407214).jpg|thumb|Construction workers are at high risk for heat illnesses as their jobs are normally outside and require physical exertion.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Heat Stress in Construction {{!}} {{!}} Blogs {{!}} CDC|url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2020/05/21/heat-stress-construction/|access-date=2020-11-11|language=en-us}}</ref>]]

== Examples of high risk occupations ==
Workers in many occupations are at high risk for exposure to heat stress. Especially vulnerable are outdoor workers who have highly physical tasks to complete, such as [[firefighter|firefighters]], [[Miner|miners]], [[military personnel]],<ref name=":1" /> [[construction worker|construction workers]], [[Landscaping|landscapers]], [[Athlete|athletes]], [[Deliveryperson|delivery persons]], and [[Farmer|agricultural workers]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=XIANG|first1=Jianjun|last2=BI|first2=Peng|last3=PISANIELLO|first3=Dino|last4=HANSEN|first4=Alana|date=March 2014|title=Health Impacts of Workplace Heat Exposure: An Epidemiological Review|journal=Industrial Health|volume=52|issue=2|pages=91–101|doi=10.2486/indhealth.2012-0145|issn=0019-8366|pmc=4202759|pmid=24366537}}</ref> Additionally, many indoor jobs also require high-exertion work in very hot conditions, for example [[factory workers]], boiler room workers, [[Welder|welders]], and [[Brigade de cuisine|kitchen staff]].<ref name="dir.ca.gov">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dir.ca.gov/Title8/3395.html|title=California Code of Regulations, Title 8, section 3395 Heat Illness Prevention.|website=www.dir.ca.gov|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref><ref name=":5" /> In unusually hot conditions, all workers should be aware of their risk for heat illness and should ensure they drink plenty of water and take breaks in cool places to avoid any severe impacts.<ref name=":4" /> 

== Symptoms of heat stress ==
When someone is exposed to hot conditions, they will begin to [[Perspiration|sweat]] and have an [[Tachycardia|increased heart rate]].<ref name=":14">{{Cite book|last1=Research|first1=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Military Nutrition|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236240/|title=Physiological Responses to Exercise in the Heat|last2=Marriott|first2=Bernadette M.|date=1993|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}</ref> If they do not drink enough water to replenish the fluid they are sweating out, a worker can become [[Dehydration|dehydrated]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aastrand|first=Irma|date=1975|title=Heat Stress in Occupational Work|journal=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and Springer}}</ref> This is why drinking extra water while working in hot environments is critical.<ref name=":14" /> If workers continually exert themselves in hot environments, they may develop muscle [[Cramp|cramps]] from sweating too much, which can be helped by taking a break and drinking extra water and [[Electrolyte-replacement drinks|electrolytes]].<ref name=":25">{{Cite web|title=Heat Illness Prevention - Title 8 Section 3395|url=https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/etools/08-006/whatis.htm|access-date=2020-11-11|website=www.dir.ca.gov}}</ref> Additionally, workers can develop [[heat rash]], which should be treated in a cool place and soothed with powder.<ref name=":04">{{Cite web|date=2020-04-15|title=Warning Signs and Symptoms of Heat-Related Illness {{!}} Natural Disasters and Severe Weather {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/extremeheat/warning.html|access-date=2020-11-11|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}}</ref> For more severe heat illnesses, it is important for workers to be able to identify the differences between [[heat exhaustion]] and [[heat stroke]] in order to protect themselves and their colleagues.

=== Heat exhaustion<ref name=":04" /> ===
When a person is experiencing [[heat exhaustion]], they will be actively and heavily sweating, though their skin may feel cool and appear pale.<ref name=":04" /> If you take their temperature, it could be normal or slightly high, and their pulse will be fast, but it may be difficult to detect or feel through the skin.<ref name=":25" /> Additionally, the person may exhibit a number of different symptoms such as [[Headache|headaches]], [[Cramp|muscle cramps]], and [[fatigue]], as well as nausea, vomiting, and in extreme cases, fainting.<ref name=":25" /><ref name=":04" />

If a worker is exhibiting these symptoms, it is important that they take a break from work to sit in a cool place, use cool, damp towels on their head and neck to further cooling, and sip water slowly as they recover.<ref name=":04" /> If a worker does not recover within an hour or continues to vomit, it is important to seek medical attention for them quickly.<ref name=":04" />

=== Heat stroke<ref name=":04" /> ===
If a worker begins to feel the signs of [[heat stroke]] from over [[exertion]] in a high temperature environment, they will normally have a very high temperature, which can be measured with a [[thermometer]].<ref name=":04" /> Their skin could be hot to the touch and damp with sweat, though they will not be actively [[Perspiration|sweating]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Publishing|first=Harvard Health|title=Heat Stroke (Hyperthermia)|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/heat-stroke-hyperthermia-a-to-z|access-date=2020-11-11|website=Harvard Health}}</ref> If you take their [[pulse]], it will be fast and easy to detect.<ref name=":25" /> Outwardly, the worker could show signs of [[dizziness]] and confusion, and they may have digestive discomfort and nausea. In severe cases, workers can pass out.<ref name=":04" />

If a worker is displaying these symptoms, it is important to call 911 to get them immediate medical attention.<ref name=":04" /> Additionally, helping the person move to a cooler place and covering their head and neck in cool, damp cloths can help while you wait for emergency services to arrive. It is important to wait for a medical professional to see them before asking them to drink a lot of water.<ref name=":04" />

== Measurement and monitoring ==

=== Measurements ===
NIOSH has set Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT)-based Recommended Alert Limits (RALs) for unacclimatized workers and [[Recommended exposure limit|Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs)]] for acclimatized workers to use in determining, monitoring, and responding to the risk of heat exposure and related impacts.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal|date=2016-02-01|title=Criteria for a recommended standard: occupational exposure to heat and hot environments - revised criteria 2016.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2016-106/|language=en|doi=10.26616/nioshpub2016106}}</ref> While different ranges of temperatures are used to determine what types of protective action should be implemented, there is no universal safe limit applied across all occupational settings. This is because safety will depend on factors specific to the environments and tasks of a specific job, as well as the workers’ physical health and fitness.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Heat Stress Monitoring|url=https://www.ohsa.com.au/services/heat-stress-monitoring/|access-date=2020-11-03|website=OHSA Occupational Health Services Australia|language=en}}</ref>

There are many different ways to measure temperature. Typically, a [[thermometer]] can be used to measure environmental [[temperature]]. However, high [[humidity]], or the amount of water that has evaporated into the air in the form of [[water vapor]], can often make the temperature outside feel hotter than the measured temperature.<ref name=":32">{{Cite web|last=US Department of Commerce|first=NOAA|title=Heat Index|url=https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-index|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.weather.gov|language=EN-US}}</ref> To address this, a [[heat index]] measure includes the air’s [[relative humidity]], or a measure of how much moisture is in the air compared to if the air were saturated with water vapor. This measure of humidity along with temperature provides more information on what workers should expect to feel in terms of heat if working outside.<ref name=":32" />

Additionally, some sources also report [[wet-bulb temperature]], which is considered an informative measure for individuals who will be working in direct sunlight.<ref name=":42">{{Cite web|last=US Department of Commerce|first=NOAA|title=WetBulb Globe Temperature|url=https://www.weather.gov/tsa/wbgt|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.weather.gov|language=EN-US}}</ref> This measure takes into account both temperature and humidity, but also includes measures of [[wind speed]], [[cloud cover]], and angle of the sun at different times of the day.<ref name=":42" />

OSHA uses a measure called the Adjusted Air Temperature to determine how often workers should be monitored, which involves the equation:<ref name=":52">{{Cite web|title=OSHA's Campaign to Prevent Heat Illness in Outdoor Workers {{!}} Using the Heat Index - Monitoring Workers at Risk of Heat-related Illness {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/heat_index/monitoring_workers.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.osha.gov}}</ref>

<math>T_a = T+ (13\times %Sunshine)</math>

Where T is temperature measured in degrees [[Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit (°F)]] and percent sunshine is measured on a spectrum from 100% (no clouds, noticeable shadows) to 0% (total cloud cover, no shadows).<ref name=":52" />

=== Monitoring ===
OSHA recommends monitoring worker's [[heart rate]], [[Body temp|temperature]], and [[body water]] loss throughout shifts in hot conditions.<ref name=":52" /> When the adjusted temperature is 90°F or above, it is recommended that even healthy, acclimatized workers have these measures monitored every 45 minutes. Workers who are not acclimatized or who are wearing impermeable equipment or clothing should be monitored every 15 minutes.<ref name=":52" />

NIOSH and OSHA have also created a Heat Index App for mobile devices that provides information on temperature, humidity, risk of heat illness, as well as hourly forecasts of temperature and information on how to prevent and treat heat illnesses.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-02-20|title=OSHA-NIOSH Heat Safety Tool App {{!}} NIOSH {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/heatapp.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}}</ref>

== Prevention ==
[[File:Extreme heat 130702-F-HZ730-020.jpg|thumb|Working in hot conditions can make the body lose fluids through sweating, so workers must drink extra water in these conditions to replenish those fluids and prevent [[dehydration]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Heat Illness Prevention - Title 8 Section 3395|url=https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/etools/08-006/whatis.htm|access-date=2020-11-11|website=www.dir.ca.gov}}</ref>]]
Employers can establish prevention programs, which focus on having protocols to gradually increases workloads and concede on allowing on more breaks for new hired workers. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/index.html|title=OSHA's Campaign to Prevent Heat Illness in Outdoor Workers|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-05-10}}</ref> Employers can control heat stress through engineering controls, work practices, providing training, implementing an acclimatization schedule, providing water and encouraging workers to drink often, and ensuring workers take appropriate rest breaks to cool down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/recommendations.html|title=CDC - Heat Stress - Recommendations - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-01}}</ref>

=== Engineering controls ===
Employers can provide [[Air conditioning|air conditioners]] for indoor work spaces and for indoor break areas. Fans can also be used together with air conditioners, and misting fans can be used outside for added cooling. Additionally, increasing building ventilation and improving the insulation of hot surfaces will reduce indoor temperatures.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Heat - Prevention - Engineering Controls, Work Practices, and Personal Protective Equipment {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatstress/controls.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.osha.gov}}</ref> If all work is completed outdoors, a shaded area should be provided with ample water for workers to take breaks often.<ref>{{Cite web|title=OSHA's Campaign to Prevent Heat Illness in Outdoor Workers {{!}} Using the Heat Index {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/heat_index/#:~:text=Outdoor%20workers%20who%20are%20exposed,gets%20hotter%20and%20more%20humid.&text=For%20people%20working%20outdoors%20in,affect%20how%20hot%20they%20feel|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.osha.gov}}</ref>

=== Work practices ===
Ample breaks with space provided in shaded or cooled areas are important for preventing heat stress related illnesses. Employers should also supply water for workers throughout the day, as workers need to drink more water when working in hot environments than they would otherwise.<ref>{{Cite web|last=CDC|date=2020-08-31|title=NIOSH Heat Stress Topic Page|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/default.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us}}</ref> Additionally, on particularly hot days, limiting high-exertion tasks as much as possible is important for keeping a worker’s metabolic temperature down.<ref name=":24">{{Cite web|date=2020-02-20|title=Heat Stress Recommendations {{!}} NIOSH {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/recommendations.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}}</ref> 

=== Training ===
All employees should be trained to recognize the symptoms of [[Hyperthermia|heat stress]].<ref name=":5" /> Supervisors should monitor their employees throughout the day for these symptoms and, for larger teams, a buddy system can be used to group workers to monitor each other for signs of heat illness.<ref name=":24" /> Additionally, informing workers about their working conditions and risk of heat illness is important, specifically in making sure that everyone understands what the heat index means and what extra precautions to take during higher risk periods.<ref>{{Cite web|title=OSHA's Campaign to Prevent Heat Illness in Outdoor Workers {{!}} Using the Heat Index {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/heat_index/|access-date=2020-11-10|website=www.osha.gov}}</ref>

=== Acclimatization schedules ===
Acclimatization can occur over different time periods for different people, but NIOSH recommends allowing workers to be exposed to gradually higher levels of heat over 7-14 days for acclimatization. New workers without recent exposure to heat may require additional time to adjust.<ref name=":03" /> On the first day of an acclimatization process, workers without previous heat exposure should be asked to complete, at most, 20% of their typical workday. After this, their workload can increase by 20% for each day of the process.<ref name=":03" /> For workers with previous exposure working in high temperature settings, acclimatization can occur as fast as four days, starting with workers completing 50% of their typical work duration on the first day.<ref name=":03" /> NIOSH strongly suggests that workers who are currently adjusting to new conditions should be supervised closely for signs of [[Hyperthermia|heat stress]], especially those who may adjust slower due to age, pre-existing health conditions, or lower levels of [[physical fitness]].<ref name=":23">{{Cite web|date=2020-02-20|title=Heat Stress Recommendations {{!}} NIOSH {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/recommendations.html|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}}</ref> A worker’s level of acclimatization must also be maintained, and if workers are absent from the working conditions for more than a week, they will need to begin the acclimatization process again.<ref name=":03" /><ref name=":23" />

== Occupational standards ==

=== International ===
[[International Organization for Standardization]] helps set standards for monitoring environments, analyzing data, and interpreting results.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Ken|date=2013-01-01|title=Occupational Health Impacts of Climate Change: Current and Future ISO Standards for the Assessment of Heat Stress|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/indhealth/51/1/51_2012-0165/_article|journal=Industrial Health|volume=51|issue=1|pages=86–100|doi=10.2486/indhealth.2012-0165|pmid=23411759|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== United States ===
Section 5(a)(1) of the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Occupational Safety and Health Act]] of 1970 declares that "Each employer shall furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees."<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=OSHACT&p_id=2743|title=OSHA Content Document|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>

The [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] provides guidelines and recommendations to employers for preventing heat stress among workers. There guidelines and recommendations are not enforced regulations, but instead completely voluntary.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arlweb.msha.gov/s&hinfo/heatstress/manual/heatmanual.htm|title=Heat Stress - Safety Manual Number 6|website=arlweb.msha.gov|access-date=2016-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307184553/http://arlweb.msha.gov/s%26hinfo/heatstress/manual/heatmanual.htm|archive-date=2016-03-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] conducts research on occupational hazards such as heat stress in order to provide better intervention methods and protect workers.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/|title=CDC - Heat Stress - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-15}}</ref>

Only three of the fifty states have created worker regulations regarding heat: California, Washington, and Minnesota.<ref name=":0" /> California Code of Regulations states that employers of  high risk outdoor workers are entitled to protection against heat. The employer must provide access to water and shade, practice high heat procedures, practice emergency response procedures, and practice acclimatization methods.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="dir.ca.gov"/> Washington State Legislature states that employers of high risk outdoor workers follow regulations to prevent heat stress.<ref name=":0" /> Minnesota Administrative Rules state that indoor ventilation and temperature are regulated to prevent heat stress.<ref name=":0" />

==== NIOSH recommended standard ====
[[File:Protect Your Workers From Heat Stress (14584030356).jpg|thumb|"Protect Your Workers From Heat Stress", CDC]]Beginning in 1972, NIOSH published a recommended standard for hot work environments, and has periodically revised to take new scientific findings into account.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2016-106/default.html|title=CDC - Occupational Exposure to Heat and Hot Environments - NIOSH Publications & Products|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-04-21|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2016106|year=2016|doi-access=free}}</ref> The intent of the NIOSH Recommended Standard for Occupational Exposure to Heat and Hot Environments is to prevent injury, disease, death, and reduced productivity.<ref name=":3" /> The recommendations include workplace limits and surveillance, medical monitoring, surveillance of heat-related sentinel health events, posting of hazardous areas, protective clothing and equipment, worker information and training, control of heat stress, and record keeping.<ref name=":3" />

===== Control of heat stress =====
Control of heat stress has recommended general requirements, engineering controls, work and hygienic practices, and a heat alert program.<ref name=":3" />

====== General Requirements ======
[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]] recommends that every employer should create and implement a written program aimed at reducing heat exposures. Engineering and work practice controls should be used to reduce exposures, and a heat alert program should be implemented.<ref name=":3" />

====== Engineering Controls ======
Air temperatures should be reduced so it does not exceed skin temperatures. [[Radiant heat]] should be reduced by creating barriers around the source. Evaporative heat loss can be increased by increasing air movement around the worker.<ref name=":3" />

====== Work and Hygienic Practices ======
The time workers spend in hot environments should be limited, with an increase of recovery time spent in cool environments. Use of more efficient procedures and tools is beneficial to reducing metabolic demands of the job. Heat tolerance may be increased by implementing a heat tolerance plan and increasing physical fitness. Employees should be trained to recognize and treat the early signs and symptoms of heat illnesses, and employers should provide cool water for employees.<ref name=":3" />

====== Heat Alert Program ======
Heat alert programs should be developed for implementation when hotter than normal temperatures, or a [[heat wave]] occurs.<ref name=":3" />
