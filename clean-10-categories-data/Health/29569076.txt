==Specific incidents by date==

===Meningitis testing in Nigeria: 1990s===

{{Main article|Abdullahi v. Pfizer, Inc.}}

The Pfizer drug [[Trovan]] was used in a clinical trial in [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]]. The trial compared the new antibiotic (Trovan) against the best treatment available at the time (intravenous ceftriaxone). Eleven children died in the trial: five after taking Trovan and six after taking an older antibiotic used for comparison in the clinical trial. Others suffered blindness, deafness and brain damage, the cause of which is difficult to determine because these disabilities are relatively common outcomes of the disease itself. A panel of medical experts later implicated Pfizer in the incident, concluding the drug had been administered as part of an illegal clinical trial without authorization from the Nigerian government or consent from the children's parents. This led to a lawsuit from the Nigerian government over informed consent.<ref name="Washington p392-393">Washington, Harriet A. ''[[Medical Apartheid]]'', Anchor Books 2006 p392-393</ref><ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6719141.stm |title=Africa &#124; Nigeria sues drugs giant Pfizer |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> Pfizer countered that it met all the necessary regulations.<ref name="Washington p392-393"/> The drug was approved for general use in the US, and  eventually withdrawn due to [[hepatotoxicity]].

===HIV/AIDS testing in Zimbabwe: 1990s===
{{main|HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe}}
[[Zidovudine|AZT]] trials conducted on HIV-positive African subjects by U.S. physicians and the [[University of Zimbabwe]] were not performed with proper [[informed consent]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The United States began testing AZT treatments in Africa in 1994, through projects funded by the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC), the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). It included testing of over 17,000 women for a medication that prevents mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS. The subjects did not fully understand the testing methods, the effectiveness, the possible dangers, or the nature of a [[placebo]] in testing situations.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>  They were also told about the trials [[under duress]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Half of these women received a placebo that has no effect, making transmission likely. As a result, an estimated 1000 babies contracted HIV/AIDS although a proven life-saving regimen already existed.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The CDC ended the short course testing in 1998 after they announced they had enough information from [[Thailand]] trials.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Forced sexual reassignment in South Africa: 1970s–1980s===
In a project headed by Dr. [[Aubrey Levin]] during the 1970s to 1980s, the [[South African Defence Force]] forced lesbian and gay military personnel to undergo "sex-change" operations. This was part of a secret program to purge homosexuality in the army.<ref name="mindpowernews.com">{{Cite web | url=http://www.mindpowernews.com/UnethicalExperiments.htm |title = Top 10 Unethical Psychological Experiments}}</ref> It included psychological coercion, chemical castration, electric shock, and other unethical medical experiments. An estimated 900 forced sexual reassignment operations may have been performed between 1971 and 1989 at military hospitals.<ref name="mindpowernews.com"/> Most of the victims were males, young 16 to 24-year-old white men who were drafted into the army during the [[South African Border War]]. Women were also subject to the experimentation.<ref name="mindpowernews.com"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mrc.ac.za/healthsystems/aversion.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201172631/http://www.mrc.ac.za/healthsystems/aversion.pdf |archive-date=2012-12-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Forced contraception in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe): 1970s===
[[Depo-Provera]] was clinically tested on black Rhodesian (now Zimbabwean) women in the 1970s.<ref name="Washington p390"/> Once approved, the drug was used as a birth control measure. Women on white-run commercial farms were coerced into accepting Depo-Provera.<ref name="Kaler, Amy 1998. p 347">Kaler, Amy. 1998. "A Threat to the Nation and a Threat to the Men: the Banning of Depo-Provera in Zimbabwe, 1981". ''[[Journal of Southern African Studies]]'' 24(2):p 347</ref> In 1981, the drug was banned in what was by then [[Zimbabwe]].<ref name="Kaler, Amy 1998. p 347"/>

===Sterilisation experiments in German South-West Africa (now part of Namibia): Late 1800s–1910s===
Dr. [[Eugen Fischer]] conducted sterilisation experiments on [[Herero people|Herero]] women in [[German South-West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]], less [[Walvis Bay]] etc.) in the early 1900s.<ref name="Washington p390"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ezakwantu.com/Gallery%20Herero%20and%20Namaqua%20Genocide.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209033514/http://www.ezakwantu.com/Gallery%20Herero%20and%20Namaqua%20Genocide.htm |archivedate=2011-12-09 }}</ref> His experimentation was largely done on mixed-race offspring in order to provide justification to ban [[mixed-race marriage]]s.<ref>[[Eugen Fischer]]</ref> He joined the [[Nazi]] party thereafter where he did similar experiments in the Jewish concentration camps. Late stage studies were later continued by Doctor {{ill|Hans Harmsen|de}}, founder of the German branch of [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] (IPPF) who is also associated with the [[compulsory sterilisation in Nazi Germany]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Effects on legitimate medicine==
Unethical medical experimentation that has occurred for over a century may be the cause of the documented fear and mistrust of doctors and medicine in Africa.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/opinion/31washington.html | work=The New York Times | first=Harriet A. | last=Washington | title=Why Africa Fears Western Medicine | date=2007-07-31}}</ref> For example, polio has been on the rise in [[Nigeria]], [[Chad]], and [[Burkina Faso]] because many people there avoid vaccinations because they believe that the vaccines are contaminated with HIV or sterilization agents.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> Due to the meningitis testing incident in Kano, many Nigerians now refuse to participate in clinical trials.<ref name="Washington p392-393"/>

==The role of poverty==
Many African nations cannot afford to offer medicine for their citizens without subsidies from multinational pharmaceutical corporations.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> To court these pharmaceutical corporations, some African nations minimize legal regulations on the conduct of medical research, which prevents potential legal battles from arising.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> This forces some Africans to make a [[Hobson's choice]]: "experimental medicine or no medicine at all".<ref>Washington, Harriet A. ''[[Medical Apartheid]]'', Anchor Books 2006 p394</ref>  People living in the rural or slum area are also more vulnerable to experimentation because they are more likely to be illiterate and to misunderstand the effects of the experimentation.<ref name="ctj.sagepub.com">{{cite journal|url=http://ctj.sagepub.com/content/3/3/306.abstract |title=Problems in comprehension of informed consent in rural and peri-urban Mali, West Africa — Clinical Trials |journal=Clinical Trials |publisher=Ctj.sagepub.com |date=2006-06-01 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=306–313 |doi=10.1191/1740774506cn150oa |accessdate=2010-11-12|last1=Krosin |first1=Michael T. |last2=Klitzman |first2=Robert |last3=Levin |first3=Bruce |last4=Cheng |first4=Jianfeng |last5=Ranney |first5=Megan L. |pmid=16895047 |s2cid=24491268 }}</ref>

==Codes of ethics==
Several national and international bodies have devised codes of ethics for conducting experiments and clinical trials.  These include the [[Nuremberg Code]] and [[Helsinki Declaration]]<ref name="ReferenceA">Meier, Benjamin Mason: International Protection of Persons Undergoing Medical Experimentation: Protecting the Right of Informed Consent, ''[[Berkeley Journal of International Law]]'' [1085-5718] Meier yr:2002 vol:20 iss:3 pg:513 -554</ref> and the [[Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa]], which seeks to prohibit all medical and scientific experiments on women without their prior informed consent.<ref name="allafrica.com">http://allafrica.com/stories/200805290720.html</ref>

==Popular culture references==
The book and movie ''[[The Constant Gardener]]'' highlighted the dynamics of conduct in clinical trials in Africa in the slum areas. This was based on the real-life meningitis incident in Kano, Nigeria. [[New York Times best seller]] book ''[[Medical Apartheid]]'' by [[Harriet A. Washington]], provides a historical account of experimentation on [[African Americans]], but also includes the links to African experimentation.<ref name="Washington p392-393"/>
