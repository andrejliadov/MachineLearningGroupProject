The '''effects of high altitude on humans''' are considerable. The [[Oxygen saturation (medicine)|oxygen saturation]] of [[hemoglobin]] determines the content of [[oxygen]] in blood. After the [[human body]] reaches around {{convert|2,100|m|ft}} above sea level, the saturation of oxyhemoglobin begins to decrease rapidly.<ref name=BordenHuman>{{cite book |last1=Young|first1=Andrew J|last2=Reeves|first2=John T. |chapter=Human Adaptation to High Terrestrial Altitude|title=Medical Aspects of Harsh Environments |volume=2 |location=Borden Institute, Washington, DC |year=2002 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.175.3270|chapter-url=http://www.usariem.army.mil/Pages/download/harshenvironmentsvol2.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916195023/http://www.usariem.army.mil/Pages/download/harshenvironmentsvol2.pdf |accessdate=2009-01-05|archive-date=2012-09-16}}</ref> However, the human body has both short-term and [[high-altitude adaptation in humans|long-term adaptations]] to altitude that allow it to partially compensate for the lack of oxygen.

==Effects as a function of altitude==
The human body can perform best at [[sea level]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=Maximal and submaximal exercise performance at altitude|first1=CS|last1=Fulco|first2=A|last2=Cymerman|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|volume=69|number=8|year=1998|pages=793–801|pmid=9715971}}</ref> where the [[atmospheric pressure]] is 101,325 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] or 1013.25 [[bar (unit)|millibars]] (or 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]], by definition). The [[Atmospheric chemistry|concentration of oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) in sea-level air is 20.9%, so the [[partial pressure]] of O<sub>2</sub> (pO<sub>2</sub>) is 21.136 kPa. In healthy individuals, this saturates [[hemoglobin]], the oxygen-binding red pigment in [[red blood cells]].<ref>{{cite web

Atmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with [[altitude]] while the O<sub>2</sub> fraction remains constant to about {{cvt|100.|km}}, so pO<sub>2</sub> decreases exponentially with altitude as well.

===Death zone===
{{main|Death zone}}
[[File:Everest kalapatthar crop.jpg|thumb|The summit of [[Mount Everest]] is in the death zone.]]
The [[death zone]] in [[mountaineering]], (originally the ''lethal zone'') was first conceived in 1953 by [[Edouard Wyss-Dunant]], a Swiss physician and alpinist.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= The Mountain World |year=1953 |pages=110–117|title= Acclimatisation |last=Wyss-Dunant|first=Edouard |url=https://archive.org/details/mountainworld195029881mbp |format=PDF |accessdate=March 10, 2013 }}</ref> It refers to altitudes above a certain point where the amount of [[oxygen]] is insufficient to sustain [[human]] life for an extended time span. This point is generally tagged as {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x| (}}, less than 356 millibars of atmospheric pressure).<ref name="PBS">{{cite web

Many deaths in high-altitude mountaineering have been caused by the effects of the death zone, either directly by loss of vital functions or indirectly wrong decisions made under stress, physical weakening leading to accidents. In the death zone, the human body cannot acclimatize. An extended stay in the death zone without [[Bottled oxygen (climbing)|supplementary oxygen]] will result in deterioration of bodily functions, loss of consciousness, and, ultimately, death.<ref name=Darack>{{cite book|first=Ed|last=Darack|title=Wild winds: adventures in the highest Andes|page=153|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2WPzJHpfLEC&q=%22death+zone%22&pg=RA1-PA153|isbn=978-1-884980-81-7}}</ref><ref name=Huey>{{Cite journal|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/18/3115.abstract|title=Limits to human performance: elevated risks on high mountains|first1=Raymond B.|last1=Huey|first2=Xavier|last2=Eguskitza|date=2 July 2001|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=204|pages=3115–9|pmid=11581324|issue=18}}</ref><ref name=Grocott>{{cite journal|journal=N Engl J Med|year=2009|volume=360|pages=140–9|title=Arterial Blood Gases and Oxygen Content in Climbers on Mount Everest|first1=Michael P.W.|last1=Grocott|first2=Daniel S.|last2=Martin |first3=Denny Z.H.|last3=Levett |first4=Roger|last4=McMorrow |first5=Jeremy|last5=Windsor |first6=Hugh E. |last6=Montgomery |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0801581|pmid=19129527|issue=2|url=http://eprints.brighton.ac.uk/14342/1/NEJM%20CXE%20ABG%202009.pdf}}</ref>

===Long-term effects===
{{Main|High-altitude adaptation in humans}}
[[File:K2 2006b.jpg|thumb|The summit of [[K2]] is in the death zone.]]
As of 1998, studies have shown that the about 140&nbsp;million people who live at elevations above {{convert|2500|m|ft}} have adapted to the lower oxygen levels. These adaptations are especially pronounced in people living in the [[Andes]] and the [[Himalaya]]s. Compared with acclimatized newcomers, native Andean and Himalayan populations have better oxygenation at birth, enlarged lung volumes throughout life, and a higher capacity for exercise. Tibetans demonstrate a sustained increase in cerebral blood flow, lower hemoglobin concentration, and less susceptibility to [[chronic mountain sickness]] (CMS). These adaptations may reflect the longer history of high altitude habitation in these regions.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Moore|first1=LG|last2=Niermeyer|first2=S|last3=Zamudio|first3=S|year=1998|title=Human adaptation to high altitude: Regional and life-cycle perspectives|journal=Am.

The cause for the increased suicide risk is as yet unknown.<ref name=Brenner/>

==Acclimatization==
The human body can adapt to high altitude through both immediate and long-term acclimatization. At high altitude, in the short term, the lack of oxygen is sensed by the [[carotid bodies]], which causes an increase in the breathing depth and rate ([[hyperpnea]]). However, hyperpnea also causes the adverse effect of [[respiratory alkalosis]], inhibiting the [[respiratory center]] from enhancing the respiratory rate as much as would be required. Inability to increase the breathing rate can be caused by inadequate carotid body response or pulmonary or renal disease.<ref name=BordenHuman/><ref name=harris/>

In addition, at high altitude, the [[Tachycardia|heart beats faster]]; the [[stroke volume]] is slightly decreased;<ref>{{cite journal|title=Effect of Altitude on the Heart and the Lungs|first1=P|last1=Bärtsch |first2=JSR |last2=Gibbs |journal=Circulation |year=2007|volume=116|issue=19|pages=2191–2202 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.650796|pmid=17984389|doi-access=free}}</ref> and non-essential bodily functions are suppressed, resulting in a decline in food digestion efficiency (as the body suppresses the [[digestive system]] in favor of increasing its cardiopulmonary reserves).<ref>{{cite journal | last =Westerterp | first =Klaas | title =Energy and Water Balance at High Altitude | journal =News in Physiological Sciences | volume =16 | issue =3 | pages =134–7 | pmid =11443234 | date = June 1, 2001 | doi =10.1152/physiologyonline.2001.16.3.134 }}</ref>

Full acclimatization requires days or even weeks. Gradually, the body compensates for the respiratory alkalosis by renal excretion of bicarbonate, allowing adequate respiration to provide oxygen without risking alkalosis. It takes about four days at any given altitude and can be enhanced by drugs such as [[acetazolamide]].<ref name=harris>{{cite journal|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/768478-overview |journal=EMedicine Specialties > Emergency Medicine > Environmental|title=Altitude Illness – Cerebral Syndromes|first1=N Stuart|last1=Harris |first2=Sara W|last2=Nelson|date=16 Apr 2008}}</ref> Eventually, the body undergoes physiological changes such as lower [[lactic acid|lactate]] production (because reduced glucose breakdown decreases the amount of lactate formed), decreased [[Blood plasma|plasma]] volume, increased [[hematocrit]] ([[polycythemia]]), increased [[Red blood cell|RBC]] mass, a higher concentration of [[capillaries]] in [[skeletal muscle]] tissue, increased [[myoglobin]], increased [[mitochondria]], increased [[Aerobic respiration|aerobic]] enzyme concentration, increase in [[2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-BPG]], [[hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction]], and [[right ventricular hypertrophy]].<ref name=BordenHuman/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=D |last2=Windsor |first2=J |title=From mountain to bedside: understanding the clinical relevance of human acclimatisation to high-altitude hypoxia |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |date=1 December 2008 |volume=84 |issue=998 |pages=622–627 |doi=10.1136/pgmj.2008.068296|pmid=19201935 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Pulmonary artery pressure increases in an effort to oxygenate more blood.

Full hematological adaptation to high altitude is achieved when the increase of red blood cells reaches a plateau and stops. The length of full hematological adaptation can be approximated by multiplying the altitude in kilometres by 11.4 days. For example, to adapt to {{convert|4000|m|ft}} of altitude would require 45.6 days.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zubieta-Calleja|first1=G.

==Athletic performance==
{{Main|Altitude training}}
[[File:Swiss Olympic training base.jpg|thumb|right|Athletes training at high altitude in [[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]] (elevation 1,856 m or 6,089 ft).]]
For athletes, high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance. For explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres, long jump, triple jump) the reduction in atmospheric pressure means there is less resistance from the atmosphere and the athlete's performance will generally be better at high altitude.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ward-Smith|year=1983|title=The influence of aerodynamic and biomechanical factors on long jump performance|journal=Journal of Biomechanics| volume=16| pages=655–8| doi=10.1016/0021-9290(83)90116-1|pmid=6643537|first1=AJ|issue=8}}</ref> For endurance events (races of 800 metres or more), the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen, which generally reduces the athlete's performance at high altitude. Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance: for example, the governing body for the [[sport of athletics]], [[World Athletics]], has ruled that performances achieved at an altitude greater than 1,000 metres will be approved for record purposes, but carry the notation of "A" to denote they were set at altitude. [[1968 in athletics#Altitude|The 1968 Summer Olympics]] were held at altitude in [[Mexico City]].  Most short sprint and jump records were set there at altitude. Other records were also set at altitude in anticipation of those Olympics. [[Bob Beamon]]'s record in the [[long jump]] held for almost 23 years and has only been beaten once without altitude or [[wind assistance#Long jump|wind assistance]]. Many of the other records set at Mexico City were later surpassed by marks set at altitude.

Athletes can also take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance.<ref name=Acclimatization/> The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level. However, this may not always be the case. Any positive acclimatization effects may be negated by a de-training effect as the athletes are usually not able to exercise with as much intensity at high altitudes compared to sea level.<ref name="pmid9216951"/>

This conundrum led to the development of the altitude training modality known as "Live-High, Train-Low", whereby the athlete spends many hours a day resting and sleeping at one (high) altitude, but performs a significant portion of their training, possibly all of it, at another (lower) altitude.
