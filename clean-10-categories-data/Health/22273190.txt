'''Cuban medical internationalism''' is the [[Cuba]]n [[medical diplomacy]] programme, started after the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]], of sending medical personnel overseas, particularly to [[Latin America]], [[Africa]] and [[Cuban-Pacific relations#Cuban medical aid|Oceania]], and of bringing medical students and patients to Cuba. In 2007, Cuba had 42,000 workers in international collaborations in 103 different countries, of whom more than 30,000 were health personnel, including at least 19,000 physicians.<ref name="HuishKirk07">Robert Huish and John M.

In 2007, one academic study on Cuban internationalism surveyed the history of the programme, noting its broad sweep: "Since the early 1960s, 28,422 Cuban health workers have worked in 37 Latin American countries, 31,181 in 33 African countries, and 7,986 in 24 Asian countries. Throughout a period of four decades, Cuba sent 67,000 health workers to structural cooperation programs, usually for at least two years, in 94 countries ... an average of 3,350 health workers working abroad every year between 1960 and 2000".<ref name=devos07/> In 2020, Cuban doctors were active in over 60 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/11/trump-puts-cuban-doctors-in-firing-line-as-heat-turned-up-on-island-economy|title=Trump puts Cuban doctors in firing line as heat turned up on island economy|date=11 February 2020|website=The Guardian|access-date=11 February 2020}}</ref> In November 2019, the United Nations estimated that there were around 30,000 Cuban doctors active in 67 countries.<ref name=":0" />

===Anti-colonialism===

The programme was initiated in 1963 as part of Cuba's foreign policy of supporting [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] struggles. It began when Cuba sent a small medical brigade to [[Algeria]], which suffered from the mass withdrawal of French medical personnel during the [[Algerian War|Algerian War of Independence]] Some wounded soldiers and war orphans were also transported back to Cuba for treatment.<ref name="brouwer09">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/090112brouwer.php | title=The Cuban Revolutionary Doctor: The Ultimate Weapon of Solidarity | first=Steve | last=Brouwer | date=January 2009 | work=[[Monthly Review]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= Gleijeses |first= Piero |author-link= Piero Gleijeses |year= 1996 |title= Cuba's First Venture in Africa: Algeria, 1961-1965 |journal= [[Journal of Latin American Studies]] |volume= 28 |issue= 1 |pages= 159–195 |jstor= 157991 |quote= The Minister of Public Health, Jose Ramón Machado Ventura, led the group, which included 29 doctors, three dentists, 15 nurses and eight medical technicians.

===Humanitarianism===
In addition to the internationalism which was driven by foreign policy objectives, humanitarian objectives also played a role in Cuba's overseas medical programme, with medical teams despatched to countries governed by ideological foes. For example, in 1960, 1972 and 1990 Cuba dispatched emergency assistance teams to Chile, Nicaragua, and Iran following earthquakes.<ref name=HuishKirk07/> Similarly, Venezuela's [[Mission Barrio Adentro]] programme grew out of the emergency assistance provided by Cuban doctors in the wake of the December 1999 mudslides in Vargas state, which killed 20,000 people.<ref name=briggsAJPH09>Briggs, Charles, and Mantini-Briggs, Clara (2009), ''American Journal of Public Health'', "Confronting Health Disparities: Latin American Social Medicine in Venezuela", I(3)</ref>

Cuban medical missions were sent to [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Haiti]] following 1998's [[Hurricane Mitch]] and [[Hurricane Georges]], and remained there semi-permanently.<ref name=brouwer09/> From 1998 onwards, Cuba expanded its international cooperation in health dramatically.<ref name=devos08>De Vos et al (2008), "Cuba's health system: Challenges ahead", ''Health Policy and Planning'', 23(4), pg:288-290</ref> The number of Cuban doctors working abroad jumped from about 5000 in 2003 to more than 25,000 in 2005.<ref name=devos08/>

In Honduras the medical personnel had a substantial impact: "In the areas they served, infant mortality rates were reduced from 30.8 to 10.1 per 1,000 live births and maternal mortality rates from 48.1 to 22.4 per 1,000 live births between 1998 and 2003."<ref name=HuishKirk07/> However, as one academic paper noted, "The idea of a nation saving lives and improving the human condition is alien to traditional statecraft and is therefore discounted as a rationale for the Cuban approach."<ref name=HuishKirk07/> In 2004 the 1700 medical personnel in [[Guatemala]] received the [[Order of the Quetzal]], the country's highest state honour.<ref name=HuishKirk07/> A 2005 attempt by Honduras to expel the Cuban mission on the basis that it was threatening Honduran jobs was successfully resisted by trade unions and community organisations.<ref name=brouwer09/>

Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Asian tsunami]], Cuba sent medical assistance to [[Banda Aceh]] and [[Sri Lanka]].<ref name=devos07>De Vos et al (2007), "Cuba's International Cooperation in Health: an Overview", ''International Journal of Health Services'', Volume 37, Number 4, Pages 761–776</ref> In response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], Cuba prepared to send 1500 doctors to [[New Orleans]], however, the offer was refused. Several months later a mission was dispatched to [[Pakistan]] following the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]]. Ultimately, Cuba sent "more than 2,500 disaster response experts, surgeons, family doctors, and other health personnel", who stayed through the winter for more than 6 months.<ref name=devos07/><ref>Akhtar, A.S.

===Venezuela===
{{main|Mission Barrio Adentro}}
Cuba's largest and most extensive medical aid effort is with [[Venezuela]]. The [[Mission Barrio Adentro|program]] grew out of the emergency assistance provided by Cuban doctors in the wake of the December 1999 mudslides in Vargas state, which killed 20,000 people. Under this bilateral effort, also known as the "oil for doctors" program, Cuba provided Venezuela with 31,000 Cuban doctors and dentists and provided training for 40,000 Venezuelan medical personnel.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Andrea|date=26 December 2016|title=Cuban President Raul Castro faces deep problems in 2017|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a66f93b0a0df447dbbc5c7bb143d5b42/cuban-president-raul-castro-faces-deep-problems-2017|website=bigstory.ap.org|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=26 December 2016|quote=Venezuela was the prime destination alongside Brazil for Cuban doctors and other professionals whose salaries go directly to the Cuban government, providing another vital source of hard currency believed to be slackening in recent years.}}</ref> In exchange, Venezuela provided Cuba with 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Based on February 2010 prices, the oil was worth $7.5 million per day, or nearly $3 billion per year.<ref name=":1" />

In response to [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998, Cuba set up the "Escuela Latinoamericana de Medicina" ("[[Latin American School of Medicine (Cuba)|Latin American School of Medicine]]"; ELAM) outside Havana, converted from a former naval base. It accepts around 1500 students per year.<ref name="HuishKirk07" /> ELAM forms part of a range of medical education and training initiatives; "Cubans, with the help of Venezuela, are currently educating more doctors, about 70,000 in all, than all the medical schools in the United States, which typically have somewhere between 64,000 to 68,000 students enrolled in their programs".<ref name="brouwer09" />

Following the development of cooperation with Venezuela through Mission Barrio Adentro, Mission Milagro/Operación Milagro was set up to provide [[ophthalmology]] services to Cuban, Venezuelan and Latin American patients, both in Cuba and in other countries. "As of August 2007, Cuba had performed over 750,000 eye surgeries, at no cost, including 113,000 surgeries for its own citizens".<ref name="HuishKirk07" />

===Other countries===
Since 1990, Cuba has provided long-term care for 18,000 victims of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], "offering treatment for hair loss, skin disorders, cancer, leukemia, and other illnesses attributed to radioactivity".<ref name="HuishKirk07" />

Cuba has also sent notable missions to Bolivia (particularly after the 2005 election of [[Evo Morales]]) and [[South Africa]], the latter in particular after a post-[[apartheid]] [[brain drain]] of white doctors.<ref name=feinsilver08>Julie M. Feinsilver (2008), [http://www.nuso.org/upload/articulos/3537_2.pdf "Oil-for-Doctors: Cuban Medical Diplomacy Gets a Little Help From a Venezuelan Friend"], ''Nueva Sociedad'' 216 July–August 2008</ref> Since 1995, a co-operation agreement with South Africa has seen hundreds of Cuban doctors practice in South Africa, while South Africa sends medical students to Cuba to study.<ref name="bday">[http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=172709 "Cuba, SA health deal is in good shape"].

====Oceania====
In the 2000s, Cuba began establishing or strengthening relations with [[Pacific Island]] countries, and providing medical aid to those countries. Cuba's medical aid to Pacific countries has involved sending its doctors to Oceania, and providing scholarships for Pacific students to study medicine in Cuba at Cuba's expense.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In 2007, there were sixteen Cuban doctors providing specialised medical care in [[Kiribati]], and an additional sixteen scheduled to join them.<ref>[http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/10/01/six-more-cuban-physicians-to-serve-in-kiribati Pacific Magazine: Six More Cuban Physicians To Serve In Kiribati<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Cuba also offered training to Kiribati doctors.<ref>[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=26617 Kiribati discusses medical training with Cuba<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Cuban doctors have reportedly provided a dramatic improvement to the field of medical care in Kiribati, reducing the child mortality rate in that country by 80%,<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=33793 Cuban doctors reduce Kiribati infant mortality rate by 80 percent<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and winning the proverbial hearts and minds in the Pacific. In response, the [[Solomon Islands]] began recruiting Cuban doctors in July 2007, while [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Fiji]] considered following suit.<ref name="autogenerated2" />

In 2008, Cuba was due to send doctors to the Solomon Islands, [[Vanuatu]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Nauru]] and Papua New Guinea,<ref name="plenglish.com">[http://www.plenglish.com:80/article.asp?ID=%7B771AA7E5-B9F3-4129-AFF7-208C0DC1D65D%7D)&language=EN "Cuban Physicians to Aid 81 Nations"]{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, [[Prensa Latina]], March 29, 2008</ref> while seventeen medical students from Vanuatu would study in Cuba.<ref>[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=41373 "Vanuatu to get six doctors from Cuba"], Radio New Zealand International, August 10, 2008</ref> It was reported that it might also provide training for Fiji doctors.<ref>[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&id=38964 "Fiji says Cuban help sought as neighbours turn away"], Radio New Zealand International, April 4, 2008</ref>

As of September 2008, fifteen Cuban doctors were serving in Kiribati, sixty-four Pacific students were studying medicine in Cuba, and Cuban authorities were offering "up to 400 scholarships to young people of that region".<ref>[http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/2008/0916amistadislaspacifico.htm "Cuban Foreign Minister Opens Cuba-Pacific Islands Meeting"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20090614213049/http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/2008/0916amistadislaspacifico.htm |date=2009-06-14 }}, Cuban News Agency, September 16, 2008</ref> Among the sixty-four students were twenty-five Solomon Islanders, twenty I-Kiribati, two Nauruans and seventeen ni-Vanuatu.<ref>[http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/2008/0929especialnusa.htm "Small Island States and Global Challenges"], Cuban News Agency, September 30, 2008</ref> Pacific Islanders have been studying in Cuba since 2006.<ref>[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200809/s2366887.htm?tab=latest "Cuba-Pacific ministerial meeting underway in Havana"], ABC Radio Australia, September 17, 2008</ref>

In June 2009, [[Prensa Latina]] reported that Cuban doctors had "inaugurated a series of new health services in Tuvalu". One Cuban doctor had been serving in Tuvalu since October 2008, and two more since February 2009. They had reportedly "attended 3,496 patients, and saved 53 lives", having "opened ultrasound and abortion services, as well as specialized consultations on hypertension, diabetes, and chronic diseases in children". They had visited all the country's islands, and were training local staff in "primary health care, and how to deal with seriously ill patients, among other subjects".<ref>[http://www.cubaheadlines.com/2009/06/14/17664/cuban_doctors_have_inaugurated_a_series_new_health_services_tuvalu_a_small_island_nation_pacific.html "Cuban doctors have inaugurated a series of new health services in Tuvalu a small island nation in the Pacific"], Prensa Latina, June 14, 2009</ref>

===Salaries and disaster tourism===
Cuba's overseas medical missions are intended to provide services at low cost to the host country. "Patients are not charged for services, and the recipient countries are expected to cover only the cost of collective housing, air fare, and limited food and supplies not exceeding $200 a month. While Cuban doctors are abroad, they continue to receive their salaries as well as a stipend in the foreign currency".<ref name=HuishKirk07/> In 2008, the pay for Cuban doctors abroad was $183 per month, whereas the pay for doctors working domestically was $23 per month.<ref name=feinsilver08/> A new term - "disaster tourism" - arose in response to a growing number of large-scale natural disasters. The phrase refers to individuals, governments and organisations who travel to a disaster area with the primary goal of having an "experience" rather than providing meaningful aid. Such aid is often short-lived, and may even get in the way of more serious rescue efforts. Cuban medical internationalism represents a polar opposite to this disaster tourism mentality, with a focus on large-scale, sustained aid targeting the most marginalised and under-served populations across the globe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kirk|first1=John|title=Healthcare Without Borders: Understanding Cuban Medical Internationalism|date=2015|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, FL|isbn=9780813061054|page=118}}</ref>

==Effects on Cuba==

===Benefits===
Both humanitarian and ideological factors were prominent in Cuba's "doctor diplomacy", particularly during the [[Cold War]]. Subsequently, its continuation has been seen as a vital means to promote Cuba's image abroad and prevent international isolation. Cuba's health missions in Honduras were "undoubtedly a deciding factor" in the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 2002, ;<ref name=HuishKirk07/> Guatemala re-established diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1998.<ref name=devos07/>

At the 2009 [[5th Summit of the Americas]], U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] commented that at the summit he had heard much about the impact of Cuban "soft diplomacy" in the form of its medical internationalism. He said this might be a reminder to the [[United States]] that limiting its interactions with Latin American countries to military and drug interdiction might be limiting its influence.<ref>[http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/news/4376 "Chavez-Obama Meeting at Summit Relaunches U.S.-Venezuela Relations"] (20 April 2009). venezuelanalysis.com.</ref>

It has also been suggested that Cuban medical internationalism promotes exports of Cuban medical technology, and may be a source of hard currency. However, the targeting of poor countries reduces the hard currency potential of missions abroad.<ref name=HuishKirk07/> In 2006, Cuba's earnings from medical services, including the export of doctors, amounted to US$2,312M – 28% of total export receipts and net capital payments. This exceeded earnings from both nickel and cobalt exports and from tourism.<ref name=feinsilver08/> These earnings were achieved despite the fact that a substantial part of Cuba's medical internationalism since 1998 has been organised within the framework of the "Integrated Health Program" (Programa Integral de Salud, PIS); this cooperation program is free for the receiving country.<ref name=devos07/> Cuba's co-operation with Venezuela provides Cuba with cheap oil in exchange for its medical support to Mission Barrio Adentro.<ref name=devos07/> Bloomberg reported in March 2014 that Cuban state-controlled media forecasted revenue of $8.2 billion that year from the program.<ref>Eric Sabo, Bloomberg.com, Mar 2014.</ref>

It has also been argued that the programme has, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, "perform[ed] a critical function in consolidating socialist consciousness" within Cuba.<ref>Saney, I. 2009, "Homeland of humanity: Internationalism within the Cuban revolution", ''Latin American Perspectives'' 36 (1), pp. 111-123</ref>

===Costs===
Although Cuba's large-scale medical training programmes and high doctor-patient ratios give it much latitude, the expansion of doctor diplomacy since 2004, particularly with the Barrio Adentro programme, has been dramatic: the number of Cuban doctors working abroad jumped from about 5000 in 2003 to more than 25,000 in 2005.<ref name=devos08/> This has had some impact on the domestic health system, for example there have been increased waiting times, particularly with regard to family doctors.<ref name=feinsilver08/> The number of patients per doctor rose from 139 to 179.<ref name=huishspiegel08/> In March 2008 Cuba announced a reorganisation of its domestic family doctor programme for greater efficiency.<ref name=feinsilver08/>

===Possible effects of lifting the U.S. embargo===
A 2010 article by [[Laurie Garrett]] in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' warned that lifting the [[United States embargo against Cuba|United States trade and travel restrictions on Cuba]] could have dire consequences for Cuba's healthcare system, leading to [[Human capital flight|an exodus]] of thousands of well-trained Cuban healthcare professionals. U.S. companies could also transform the remaining healthcare system into a destination for [[medical tourism]]. Garrett concluded that, if politicians do not take great care, lifting of the restrictions would rob Cuba of its greatest triumph.<ref name=":1" />

== Reports of slavery and political coercion ==
The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], in an official public communication by the Mandates of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences; and the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, have indicated that the working conditions of the Cuban medical workers in these missions "could rise to forced labor, according to the forced labor indicators established by the [[International Labour Organization|International Labor Organization]]. Forced labor constitutes a contemporary form of slavery". In particular, related to defection the communication indicated that "''If a professional decides to retire from work abroad, it is classified as «abandonment of the mission of civilian workers» under the Cuban Penal Code, which in its article 135.1 stipulates that «the official or employee in charge of fulfilling a mission in a foreign country that abandons it, or, once it has been completed, or required at any time to return, refuses, expressly or tacitly, to do so, incurs a punishment of deprivation of freedom for three to eight years.»''”<ref name=":0" />

According to Luis Zuñiga, director of human rights for the [[Cuban American National Foundation]], Cuban doctors are "slave workers" who labor for meager wages while bolstering Cuba's image as a donor nation and "the Cuban government exports these doctors as merchandise".<ref name="vanish" /> According ''ADN Cuba'', the Cuban government keeps between 70 and 90% of their salary and those who break the mission are punished for 8 years, without allowing them to return to Cuba.<ref>{{cite web|date=13 January 2020|title=Trata de Médicos Cubanos|url=https://adncuba.com/tags/medicos-cubanos|access-date=20 March 2020|publisher=[[ADN Cuba]]|language=es}}</ref>

According to a 2019 ''[[The New York Times]]'' article, 16 Cuban doctors from ''[[Mission Barrio Adentro]]'' in Venezuela acknowledged to have denied medicine and other treatments in order to secure votes for the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (PSUV) during elections through coercion. Especially during [[2018 Venezuelan presidential election]] in which [[Nicolás Maduro]] assured his reelection. Cuban doctors would have been instructed to go door to door warning residents that medical treatments would be cut off if they did not vote for Maduro. They also were asked to register people into the Venezuelan government homeland card, to secure medical services, and refuse treatment to those who did not apply for it. Some doctors report to have provided counterfeit ID cards to patients to be able to vote. Maduro administration has used social benefits before as coercion. According to 4 doctors, Maduro administration has established electoral command centers next to clinics leaded by members of the PSUV to dispatch doctors to pressure residents.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Casey|first=Nicholas|date=2019-03-17|title=‘It Is Unspeakable’: How Maduro Used Cuban Doctors to Coerce Venezuela Voters|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/world/americas/venezuela-cuban-doctors.html|access-date=2020-06-13|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>
