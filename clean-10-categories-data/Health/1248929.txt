==Types==
FASDs encompass a range of [[birth defect|physical]] and [[neurodevelopmental disorder|neurodevelopmental]] problems that can result from prenatal alcohol exposure.<ref name=CDC2015Fact/> The most severe condition is called fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS),<ref name=CDC2015Fact/> which refers to individuals who have a specific set of birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders characteristic of the diagnosis.<ref name=kingdon>{{citation|last=Kingdon|title=Research Review: Executive function deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder – a meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume=57|issue=2|pages=116–131|year=2016|doi=10.1111/jcpp.12451|pmid=26251262|display-authors=etal|pmc=5760222}}</ref>

Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types.<ref name=SBU2017/> Partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS) refers to individuals with a known, or highly suspected, history of prenatal alcohol exposure who have alcohol-related physical and neurodevelopmental deficits that do not meet the full criteria for FAS.<ref name="kingdon" /> The subtypes of pFAS are alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD).<ref name="kingdon" /> In addition to FAS, pFAS, ARND, and ARBD, any other conditions believed to be related to prenatal alcohol exposure, such as [[spontaneous abortion]] and [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS), are also considered to be on the spectrum of related disorders.<ref name="kingdon" /> It is unclear {{as of|2017|lc=y}} if identifying a FASD-related condition benefits the individual.<ref name=SBU2017/>

In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association introduced, neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE) into the DSM-V as a "condition for further study" and as a specified condition under, "other specified neurodevelopmental disorders" as a way to better study the behavioral aspects of all FASD disorders. Though similar sounding ND-PAE is the spectrum-wide term for the psychiatric, behavioral, and neurological symptoms of all FASD's, where as ARND, is the specific diagnosis of the non-dysmorphic type of FASD where a majority of the symptoms are witnessed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zubler, MD, FAAP |first1=Jennifer |last2=Weitzman, MD, FAAP |first2=Carol |last3=Sloane, DO |first3=Mark |last4=Singh, MPA |first4=Natasha |last5=Senturias, MD, FAAP |first5=Yasmin N. |last6=Kosofsky, MD, PhD |first6=Barry |last7=Kable, PhD |first7=Julie |last8=Fernandez-Baca, MA |first8=Daniel |last9=Dang, MPH |first9=Elizabeth |last10=Chasnoff, MD, FAAP |first10=Ira |last11=Bertrand PhD |first11=Jacquelyn |last12=Balachova PhD |first12=Tatiana |last13=Hagan Jr. MD, FAAP |first13=Joseph F. |title=Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated With Prenatal Alcohol Exposure |url=https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/138/4/e20151553.full.pdf |website=American Association of Pediatrics Publications |publisher=American Journal of Pediatrics |pmid=27677572 |access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>

==Signs and symptoms==
[[Image:FASkid.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|Facial characteristics of a child with FAS]]
The key of FASD can vary between individuals exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. While consensus exists for the definition and diagnosis of FAS, minor variations among the systems lead to differences in definitions and diagnostic cut-off criteria for other diagnoses across the FASD continuum.

The [[central nervous system]] damage criteria particularly lacks clear consensus. A working knowledge of the key features is helpful in understanding FASD diagnoses and conditions, and each is reviewed with attention to similarities and differences across the four diagnostic systems. More than 400 problems, however, can occur with FASD.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/about_camh/newsroom/news_releases_media_advisories_and_backgrounders/current_year/Pages/More-than-400-conditions-co-occur-with-Fetal-Alcohol-Spectrum-Disorders-(FASD),-CAMH-study-finds.aspx|title=CAMH: More than 400 conditions co-occur with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), CAMH study finds|website=www.camh.ca|access-date=2016-11-20|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121041944/http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/about_camh/newsroom/news_releases_media_advisories_and_backgrounders/current_year/Pages/More-than-400-conditions-co-occur-with-Fetal-Alcohol-Spectrum-Disorders-(FASD),-CAMH-study-finds.aspx|archive-date=21 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Growth===
In terms of FASD, [[Human development (biology)|growth]] deficiency is defined as significantly below average [[Human height|height]], [[Human weight|weight]] or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure, and can be assessed at any point in the [[Maximum life span|lifespan]]. Growth measurements must be adjusted for parental height, [[gestational age]] (for a [[premature birth|premature infant]]), and other [[postnatal]] insults (e.g., [[poor nutrition]]), although birth height and weight are the preferred measurements.<ref name =4digitcode/> Deficiencies are documented when height or weight falls at or below the 10th percentile of standardized growth charts appropriate to the population.<ref name=growthchart>[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm#Clin%202 Clinical growth charts.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203192127/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm |date=3 December 2010 }} National Center for Growth Statistics.  Retrieved on 2007-04-10</ref> Prenatal or postnatal presentation of growth deficits can occur, but are most often postnatal.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=del Campo|first1=Miguel|last2=Jones|first2=Kenneth Lyons|date=2017-01-01|title=A review of the physical features of the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders|journal=European Journal of Medical Genetics|series=Special issue on Environmental Teratogens|volume=60|issue=1|pages=55–64|doi=10.1016/j.ejmg.2016.10.004|pmid=27729236|issn=1769-7212}}</ref>

Criteria for FASD are least specific in the IOM{{what|date=June 2020}} diagnostic system ("low birth weight..., decelerating weight not due to nutrition..., [or] disproportional low weight to height" p.&nbsp;4 of executive summary),<ref name=IOM/> while the CDC and Canadian guidelines use the 10th percentile as a cut-off to determine growth deficiency.<ref name=Canadian/><ref name=CDC/> The "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" allows for mid-range gradations in growth deficiency (between the 3rd and 10th percentiles) and severe growth deficiency at or below the 3rd percentile.<ref name=4digitcode/> Growth deficiency (at severe, moderate, or mild levels) contributes to diagnoses of FAS and pFAS, but not ARND or static encephalopathy.

Growth deficiency is ranked as follows by the "4-Digit Diagnostic Code":<ref name=4digitcode>Astley, S.J. (2004). ''Diagnostic Guide for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code''. Seattle: University of Washington. PDF available at [http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/htmls/4-digit-code.htm FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216110134/http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/htmls/4-digit-code.htm |date=16 December 2006 }}.  Retrieved on 2007-04-11.</ref>

* Severe: Height and weight at or below the 3rd percentile.
* Moderate: Either height or weight at or below the 3rd percentile, but not both.
* Mild: Either height or weight or both between the 3rd and 10th percentiles.
* None: Height and weight both above the 10th percentile.

In the initial studies that discovered FAS, growth deficiency was a requirement for inclusion in the studies; thus, all the original people with FAS had growth deficiency as an [[Artifact (observational)|artifact]] of [[Chorionic villus sampling|sampling]] characteristics used to establish criteria for the syndrome.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} That is, growth deficiency is a key feature of FASD because growth deficiency was a criterion for inclusion in the study that defined FAS. This suggests growth deficiency may be less critical for understanding the disabilities of FASD than the neurobehavioral sequelae to the brain damage.<ref name =IOM/>

===Facial features===
Several characteristic [[craniofacial]] abnormalities are often visible in individuals with FAS.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones K, Smith D |title=The fetal alcohol syndrome |journal=Teratology |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=1975 |pmid=1162620 |doi=10.1002/tera.1420120102}}</ref> The presence of FAS facial features indicates [[brain damage]], although brain damage may also exist in their absence. FAS facial features (and most other visible, but non-diagnostic, deformities) are believed to be caused mainly during the 10th to 20th week of gestation.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Renwick J, Asker R |title=Ethanol-sensitive times for the human conceptus |journal=Early Hum Dev |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=99–111 |year=1983 |pmid=6884260 |doi=10.1016/0378-3782(83)90065-8}}</ref>

Refinements in diagnostic criteria since 1975 have yielded three distinctive and diagnostically significant facial features known to result from prenatal alcohol exposure and distinguishes FAS from other disorders with partially overlapping characteristics.<ref name =photo>{{cite journal |vauthors=Astley SJ, Clarren SK | year = 1996 | title = Most FAS children have a smaller brain then other children "A case definition and photographic screening tool for the facial phenotype of fetal alcohol syndrome" | journal = Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 129 | issue = 1| pages = 33–41 | pmid = 8757560 | doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(96)70187-7}}</ref><ref name =photoapp>{{cite journal |vauthors=Astley SJ, Stachowiak J, Clarren SK, Clausen C | year = 2002 | title = Application of the fetal alcohol syndrome facial photographic screening tool in a foster care population | journal = Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 141 | issue = 5| pages = 712–717 | pmid = 12410204 | doi=10.1067/mpd.2002.129030}}</ref> The three FAS facial features are:

* A smooth [[philtrum]]: The divot or groove between the nose and upper lip flattens with increased prenatal alcohol exposure.
* Thin vermilion: The [[upper lip]] thins with increased prenatal alcohol exposure.
* Small [[palpebral fissure]]s: [[human eyeball|Eye]] width decreases with increased prenatal alcohol exposure.

Measurement of FAS facial features uses criteria developed by the University of Washington. The lip and philtrum are measured by a trained physician with the Lip-Philtrum Guide,<ref name=lipphiltrum>[http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/htmls/lip-philtrum-guides.htm Lip-philtrum guides] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208212724/http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/htmls/lip-philtrum-guides.htm |date=8 February 2007 }}. FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network, University of Washington. Retrieved on 2007-04-10.</ref> a five-point Likert Scale with representative photographs of lip and philtrum combinations ranging from normal (ranked 1) to severe (ranked 5). Palpebral fissure length (PFL) is measured in millimeters with either calipers or a clear ruler and then compared to a PFL growth chart, also developed by the University of Washington.<ref name=facial>[http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/htmls/fas-face.htm FAS facial features] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027175622/http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/htmls/fas-face.htm |date=27 October 2007 }}. FAS Diagnostic and Prevention Network, University of Washington. Retrieved on 2007-04-10</ref>

Ranking FAS facial features is complicated because the three separate facial features can be affected independently by prenatal alcohol. A summary of the criteria follows:<ref name=4digitcode/><ref>Astley, Susan.

University of Washington, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network. Retrieved on 2007-04-11</ref>

* Severe: All three facial features ranked independently as severe (lip ranked at 4 or 5, philtrum ranked at 4 or 5, and PFL two or more standard deviations below average).
* Moderate: Two facial features ranked as severe and one feature ranked as moderate (lip ''or'' philtrum ranked at 3, ''or'' PFL between one and two standard deviations below average).
* Mild: A mild ranking of FAS facial features covers a broad range of facial feature combinations:
** Two facial features ranked severe and one ranked within normal limits,
** One facial feature ranked severe and two ranked moderate, or
**One facial feature ranked severe, one ranked moderate and one ranked within normal limits.
* None: All three facial features ranked within normal limits.

=== Central nervous system ===
[[Central nervous system]] (CNS) damage is the primary feature of any FASD diagnosis. Prenatal alcohol exposure, which is classified as a [[teratogen]], can damage the brain across a continuum of gross to subtle impairments, depending on the amount, timing, and frequency of the exposure as well as genetic predispositions of the fetus and mother.<ref name=IOM/><ref>West, J.R. (Ed.) (1986).  ''Alcohol and Brain Development''. New York: Oxford University Press.{{page needed|date=October 2014}}</ref> While functional abnormalities are the behavioral and cognitive expressions of the FASD disability, CNS damage can be assessed in three areas: structural, neurological, and functional impairments.

All four diagnostic systems allow for assessment of CNS damage in these areas, but criteria vary. The IOM system requires structural or neurological impairment for a diagnosis of FAS, but also allows a "complex pattern" of functional anomalies for diagnosing PFAS and ARND.<ref name=IOM/> The "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" and CDC guidelines allow for a positive CNS finding in any of the three areas for any FASD diagnosis, but functional anomalies must measure at two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains for a diagnosis of FAS, PFAS, and ARND.<ref name=4digitcode/><ref name=CDC/> The "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" also allows for an FASD diagnosis when only two functional domains are measured at two standard deviations or worse.<ref name=4digitcode/> The "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" further elaborates the degree of CNS damage according to four ranks:

* Definite: Structural impairments or neurological impairments for FAS or static encephalopathy.
* Probable: Significant dysfunction of two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains.
* Possible: Mild to moderate dysfunction of two standard deviations or worse in one or two functional domains ''or'' by judgment of the clinical evaluation team that CNS damage cannot be dismissed.
* Unlikely: No evidence of CNS damage.

====Structural====
Structural abnormalities of the brain are observable, physical damage to the brain or brain structures caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Structural impairments may include [[microcephaly]] (small head size) of two or more standard deviations below the average, or other abnormalities in brain structure (e.g., [[agenesis of the corpus callosum]], [[cerebellar hypoplasia]]).<ref name=IOM/>

Microcephaly is determined by comparing head circumference (often called [[Orbitofrontal cortex|occipitofrontal]] circumference, or OFC) to appropriate OFC growth charts.<ref name=growthchart/> Other structural impairments must be observed through [[medical imaging]] techniques by a trained physician. Because imaging procedures are expensive and relatively inaccessible to most people, diagnosis of FAS is not frequently made via structural impairments, except for microcephaly.

Evidence of a CNS structural impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS, and neurological and functional impairments are highly likely.<ref name=Canadian/><ref name=IOM/><ref name=4digitcode/><ref name=CDC/>

During the first trimester of pregnancy, alcohol interferes with the migration and organization of [[brain cell]]s, which can create structural deformities or deficits within the brain.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarren S, Alvord E, Sumi S, Streissguth A, Smith D |title=Brain malformations related to prenatal exposure to ethanol |journal=J Pediatr |volume=92 |issue=1 |pages=64–7 |year=1978 |pmid=619080 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(78)80072-9}}</ref> During the third trimester, damage can be caused to the [[hippocampus]], which plays a role in memory, learning, emotion, and encoding visual and auditory information, all of which can create neurological and functional CNS impairments as well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Coles C, Brown R, Smith I, Platzman K, Erickson S, Falek A |title=Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure at school age. I. Physical and cognitive development |journal=Neurotoxicol Teratol |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=357–67 |year=1991 |pmid=1921915 |doi=10.1016/0892-0362(91)90084-A}}</ref>

As of 2002, there were 25 reports of [[Autopsy|autopsies]] on infants known to have FAS. The first was in 1973, on an infant who died shortly after birth.<ref name=Jones1973/> The examination revealed extensive brain damage, including microcephaly, migration anomalies, callosal dysgenesis, and a massive [[neuroglial]], [[leptomeningeal]] [[Heterotopia (medicine)|heterotopia]] covering the left hemisphere.<ref name=Mattson10>Mattson, S.N., & Riley, E.P. (2002). "Neurobehavioral and Neuroanatomical Effects of Heavy Prenatal Exposure to Alcohol," in Streissguth and Kantor. (2002). p. 10.</ref>

In 1977, Dr. Clarren described a second infant whose mother was a binge drinker. The infant died ten days after birth. The autopsy showed severe [[hydrocephalus]], abnormal neuronal migration, and a small [[corpus callosum]] (which connects the two [[Cerebral hemisphere|brain hemispheres]]) and [[cerebellum]].<ref name=Mattson10/> FAS has also been linked to [[brainstem]] and cerebellar changes, [[agenesis of the corpus callosum]] and [[anterior commissure]], neuronal migration errors, absent [[olfactory bulb]]s, [[meningomyelocele]], and [[porencephaly]].<ref name=Mattson10/>

====Neurological====
When structural impairments are not observable or do not exist, neurological impairments are assessed. In the context of FASD, [[Neurology|neurological impairments]] are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure which causes general neurological damage to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), the [[peripheral nervous system]], or the [[autonomic nervous system]]. A determination of a neurological problem must be made by a trained physician, and must not be due to a postnatal insult, such as [[meningitis]], [[concussion]], [[traumatic brain injury]], etc.

All four diagnostic systems show virtual agreement on their criteria for CNS damage at the neurological level, and evidence of a CNS neurological impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS or pFAS, and functional impairments are highly likely.<ref name=Canadian/><ref name=IOM/><ref name=4digitcode/><ref name=CDC/>

Neurological problems are expressed as either hard signs, or diagnosable disorders, such as [[epilepsy]] or other [[seizure disorder]]s, or soft signs. Soft signs are broader, nonspecific neurological impairments, or symptoms, such as impaired [[fine motor skills]], [[sensory processing disorder|neurosensory]] [[hearing loss]], poor [[Gait (human)|gait]], [[developmental coordination disorder|clumsiness]], and poor [[Hand-eye coordination|hand - eye coordination]]. Many soft signs have [[Norm-referenced test|norm-referenced criteria]], while others are determined through clinical judgment. "Clinical judgment" is only as good as the clinician, and soft signs should be assessed by either a pediatric neurologist, a pediatric neuropsychologist, or both.

====Functional====
When structural or neurological impairments are not observed, all four diagnostic systems allow CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure to be assessed in terms of functional impairments.<ref name=Canadian/><ref name=IOM/><ref name=4digitcode/><ref name=CDC/> Functional impairments are deficits, problems, delays, or abnormalities due to prenatal alcohol exposure (rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults) in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning, often referred to as [[developmental disabilities]]. There is no consensus on a specific pattern of functional impairments due to prenatal alcohol exposure<ref name=IOM/> and only CDC guidelines label developmental delays as such,<ref name=CDC/> so criteria (and FASD diagnoses) vary somewhat across diagnostic systems.

The four diagnostic systems list various CNS domains that can qualify for functional impairment that can determine an FASD diagnosis:

* Evidence of a complex pattern of behavior or cognitive abnormalities inconsistent with developmental level in the following CNS domains – Sufficient for a pFAS or ARND diagnosis using IOM guidelines<ref name=IOM/>
** [[Learning disability|Learning disabilities]], academic achievement, [[Deferred gratification|impulse control]], [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social perception]], [[communication]], [[abstraction]], math skills, [[memory]], [[attention]], judgment
* Performance at two or more [[standard deviation]]s on [[standardized testing]] in three or more of the following CNS domains – Sufficient for an FAS, pFAS or static encephalopathy diagnosis using 4-Digit Diagnostic Code<ref name=4digitcode/>
** [[Executive functioning]], [[memory]], [[cognition]], [[Adaptive behavior|social/adaptive skills]], academic achievement, [[communication|language]], [[motor skill]]s, [[attention]], activity level
* General [[cognitive]] deficits (e.g., [[IQ]]) at or below the 3rd percentile on [[standardized testing]] – Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using CDC guidelines<ref name=CDC/>
* Performance at or below the 16th percentile on [[standardized testing]] in three or more of the following CNS domains – Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using CDC guidelines<ref name=CDC/>
** [[Cognition]], [[executive functioning]], [[motor skill|motor functioning]], [[ADHD|attention and hyperactive problems]], [[social skills]], [[sensory processing disorder]], social [[communication]], [[memory]], difficulties responding to common [[parenting]] practices
* Performance at two or more [[standard deviation]]s on [[standardized testing]] in three or more of the following CNS domains – Sufficient for an FAS diagnosis using Canadian guidelines
** Cognition, [[communication]], academic achievement, [[memory]], [[executive functioning]], [[adaptive behavior]], [[motor skills]], [[social skills]], social [[communication]]

Other conditions may commonly co-occur with FAS, stemming from prenatal alcohol exposure. However, these conditions are considered [[Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder#Alcohol-Related Birth Defects|alcohol-related birth defects]]<ref name=IOM/> and not diagnostic criteria for FAS.

==Mechanism==
Despite intense research efforts, the exact mechanism for the development of FAS or FASD is unknown. On the contrary, clinical and animal studies have identified a broad spectrum of pathways through which maternal alcohol can negatively affect the outcome of a pregnancy. Clear conclusions with universal validity are difficult to draw, since different ethnic groups show considerable [[genetic polymorphism]] for the hepatic enzymes responsible for ethanol detoxification.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Warren K. |author2=Li T-K | year = 2005 | title =  Genetic polymorphisms: Impact on the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1000669| journal = Birth Defects Research Part A: Clinical and Molecular Teratology | volume = 73 | issue = 4| pages = 195–203 | doi=10.1002/bdra.20125|pmid=15786496 }}</ref>

A human fetus appears to be at triple risk from maternal alcohol consumption:<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brien J. | year = 1983 | title =Disposition of ethanol in human maternal venous blood and amniotic fluid| pmid =6846436| journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 146 | issue = 2| pages = 181–186 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1016/0002-9378(83)91050-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Nava-Ocampo A. | year = 2004 | title =Elimination kinetics of ethanol in pregnant women| pmid =15135856 | journal = Reproduct Toxicol | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 613–617 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1016/j.reprotox.2004.02.012}}</ref>
# The placenta allows free entry of ethanol and toxic metabolites like acetaldehyde into the fetal compartment. The so-called placental barrier is practically absent with respect to ethanol.
# The developing fetal nervous system appears particularly sensitive to ethanol toxicity. The latter interferes with proliferation, differentiation, neuronal migration, axonic outgrowth, integration, and fine-tuning of the synaptic network. In short, all major processes in the developing central nervous system appear compromised.
# Fetal tissues are quite different from adult tissues in function and purpose. For example, the main detoxicating organ in adults is the [[Human liver|liver]], whereas the fetal liver is incapable of detoxifying ethanol, as the ADH and ALDH enzymes have not yet been brought to expression at this early stage. Up to term, fetal tissues do not have significant capacity for the detoxification of ethanol, and the [[fetus]] remains exposed to ethanol in the amniotic fluid for periods far longer than the decay time of ethanol in the maternal circulation. The lack of significant quantities of ADH and ALDH means that fetal tissues have much lower quantities of antioxidant enzymes, like [[Superoxide dismutase|SOD]], glutathione transferases, and [[Glutathione peroxidase|glutathion peroxidases]], resulting in antioxidant protection being much less effective.

==Diagnosis==
Because admission of alcohol use during pregnancy can stigmatize birth mothers, many are reluctant to admit drinking or to provide an accurate report of the quantity they drank. This complicates diagnosis and treatment of the syndrome.<ref name=CDC/> As a result, diagnosis of the severity of FASD relies on protocols of observation of the child's physiology and behavior rather than maternal self-reporting. 
Presently, four FASD diagnostic systems that diagnose FAS and other FASD conditions have been developed in North America:
* The [[Institute of Medicine]]'s guidelines for FAS, the first system to standardize diagnoses of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure;<ref name =IOM/>
* The [[University of Washington]]'s "The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code", which ranks the four key features of FASD on a [[Likert scale]] of one to four and yields 256 descriptive codes that can be categorized into 22 distinct clinical categories, ranging from FAS to no findings;<ref name=4digitcode/>
* The [[Centers for Disease Control]]'s "Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis", which established consensus on the diagnosis FAS in the U.S. but deferred addressing other FASD conditions;<ref name=CDC>[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/documents/FAS_guidelines_accessible.pdf Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis (PDF).] CDC (July 2004).  Retrieved on 2019-10-19</ref> and
* Canadian guidelines for FASD diagnoses, which established criteria for diagnosing FASD in Canada and harmonized most differences between the IOM and University of Washington's systems.<ref name=Canadian>{{Cite journal|last=Chudley|title=Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: Canadian guidelines for diagnosis|journal=CMAJ|volume=172|issue=5 Suppl|pages=S1–S21|year=2005|pmid=15738468|doi=10.1503/cmaj.1040302|pmc=557121|display-authors=etal|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Each diagnostic system requires that a complete FASD evaluation includes an assessment of the four key features of FASD, described below. A positive finding on all four features is required for a diagnosis of FAS. However, prenatal alcohol exposure and central nervous system damage are the critical elements of the spectrum of FASD, and a positive finding in these two features is sufficient for an FASD diagnosis that is not "full-blown FAS".

While the four diagnostic systems essentially agree on criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), there are still differences when full criteria for FAS are not met. This has resulted in differing and evolving nomenclature for other conditions across the spectrum of FASD, which may account for such a wide variety of terminology. Most individuals with deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure do not express all features of FAS and fall into other FASD conditions.<ref name =IOM/> The Canadian guidelines recommend the assessment and descriptive approach of the "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" for each key feature of FASD and the terminology of the IOM in diagnostic categories, excepting ARBD.<ref name=Canadian/>

Thus, other FASD conditions are partial expressions of FAS. However, these other FASD conditions may create disabilities similar to FAS if the key area of central nervous system damage shows clinical deficits in two or more of [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder#Ten brain domains|ten domains of brain functioning]]. Essentially, even though growth deficiency and/or FAS facial features may be mild or nonexistent in other FASD conditions, yet clinically significant brain damage of the central nervous system is present. In these other FASD conditions, an individual may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes because brain damage is present without associated visual cues of poor growth or the "FAS face" that might ordinarily trigger an FASD evaluation. Such individuals may be misdiagnosed with primary [[DSM-IV Codes|mental health disorders]] such as [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] or [[oppositional defiance disorder]] without appreciation that brain damage is the underlying cause of these disorders, which requires a different treatment paradigm than typical mental health disorders. While other FASD conditions may not yet be included as an [[ICD]] or [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] diagnosis, they nonetheless pose significant impairment in [[Adaptive behavior|functional behavior]] because of underlying brain damage.

===Fetal alcohol syndrome===
The following criteria must be fully met for an FAS diagnosis:<ref name =Canadian/><ref name =IOM/><ref name =4digitcode/><ref name =CDC/>

# Growth deficiency: Prenatal or postnatal height or weight (or both) at or below the 10th percentile<ref name="growthchart"/>
# FAS facial features: All three FAS facial features present<ref name =facial/>
# Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural neurological, ''or'' functional impairment
# Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed or Unknown prenatal alcohol exposure

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the first diagnosable condition of FASD that was discovered. FAS is the only expression of FASD that has garnered consensus among experts to become an official [[ICD-9]] and [[ICD-10]] diagnosis. To make this diagnosis or determine any FASD condition, a [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary]] evaluation is necessary to assess each of the four key features for assessment. Generally, a trained [[physician]] will determine growth deficiency and FAS facial features. While a qualified physician may also assess central nervous system structural abnormalities and/or neurological problems, usually central nervous system damage is determined through [[Psychological testing|psychological]], [[Speech pathology|speech-language]], and [[occupational therapy]] assessments to ascertain clinically significant impairments in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains.<ref name =Lang/> Prenatal alcohol exposure risk may be assessed by a qualified physician, [[psychologist]], [[social work]]er, or chemical health counselor. These professionals work together as a team to assess and interpret data of each key feature for assessment and develop an integrative, multi-disciplinary report to diagnose FAS (or other FASD conditions) in an individual.

===Partial FAS===
Partial FAS (pFAS) was previously known as atypical FAS in the 1997 edition of the "4-Digit Diagnostic Code". People with pFAS have a confirmed history of prenatal alcohol exposure, but may lack growth deficiency or the complete facial stigmata. Central nervous system damage is present at the same level as FAS. These individuals have the same functional disabilities but "look" less like FAS.

The following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of Partial FAS:<ref name =Canadian/><ref name =IOM/><ref name =4digitcode/>

# Growth deficiency: Growth or height may range from normal to deficient<ref name =growthchart/>
# FAS facial features: Two or three FAS facial features present<ref name =facial/>
# Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural, neurological, ''or'' functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains<ref name =Lang/>
# Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure

===Fetal alcohol effects===
Fetal alcohol effects (FAE) is a previous term for alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects.<ref name=CDC2015Fact/> It was initially used in research studies to describe humans and animals in whom teratogenic effects were seen after confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (or unknown exposure for humans), but without obvious physical anomalies.<ref name =FAE/> Smith (1981) described FAE as an "extremely important concept" to highlight the debilitating effects of brain damage, regardless of the growth or facial features.<ref name =FAESmith>{{cite journal | author = Smith D.W. | year = 1981 | title = Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects | journal = Neurobehavioral Toxicology and Teratology | volume = 3 | page = 127 | pmid = 7254460 }}</ref> This term has fallen out of favor with clinicians because it was often regarded by the public as a less severe disability than FAS, when in fact its effects can be just as detrimental.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Aase J.M. |author2=Jones K.L. |author3=Clarren S.K. | year = 1995 | title = Do we need the term FAE? | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 428–430 | pmid = 7862486 }}</ref>

====Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder====
Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) was initially suggested by the Institute of Medicine to replace the term FAE and focus on central nervous system damage, rather than growth deficiency or FAS facial features. The Canadian guidelines also use this diagnosis and the same criteria. While the "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" includes these criteria for three of its diagnostic categories, it refers to this condition as [[encephalopathy|static encephalopathy]]. The behavioral effects of ARND are not necessarily unique to alcohol however, so use of the term must be within the context of confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure.<ref name =FASGuide/> ARND may be gaining acceptance over the terms FAE and ARBD to describe FASD conditions with central nervous system abnormalities or behavioral or cognitive abnormalities or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure without regard to growth deficiency or FAS facial features.<ref name =FASGuide/><ref name =MalbinTry>Malbin, D. (2002). ''Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: Trying Differently Rather Than Harder''. Portland, Oregon: FASCETS, Inc. {{ISBN|0-9729532-0-5}}.</ref>

The following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of ARND or static encephalopathy:<ref name =Canadian/><ref name =IOM/><ref name =4digitcode/>

# Growth deficiency: Growth or height may range from normal to minimally deficient<ref name =growthchart/>
# FAS facial features: Minimal or no FAS facial features present<ref name =facial/>
# Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural, neurological, ''or'' functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains<ref name =Lang/>
# Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure;0

====Alcohol-related birth defects====
Alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), formerly known as possible fetal alcohol effect (PFAE),<ref name=FAE/> was a term proposed as an alternative to FAE and PFAE<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.1989.tb00384.x |last1=Sokol |first=R. J. |last2=Clarren |first2=S. K. | year = 1989 | title = Guidelines for use of terminology describing the impact of prenatal alcohol on the offspring | journal = Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 597–598 |pmid=2679217 }}</ref> The IOM presents ARBD as a list of congenital anomalies that are linked to maternal alcohol use but have no key features of FASD.<ref name=IOM/> PFAE and ARBD have fallen out of favor because these anomalies are not necessarily specific to maternal alcohol consumption and are not criteria for diagnosis of FASD.<ref name=FASGuide>Streissguth, A. (1997). ''Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: A Guide for Families and Communities''. Baltimore: Brookes Publishing. {{ISBN|1-55766-283-5}}.</ref> The Canadian guidelines recommend that ARBD should not be used as an umbrella term or diagnostic category for FASD.

===Exposure===
Prenatal alcohol exposure is determined by interview of the biological mother or other family members knowledgeable of the mother's alcohol use during the pregnancy (if available), prenatal health records (if available), and review of available birth records, court records (if applicable), [[drug rehabilitation|chemical dependency treatment]] records (if applicable), chemical biomarkers,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bager|first1=Heidi|last2=Christensen|first2=Lars Porskjaer|last3=Husby|first3=Steffen|last4=Bjerregaard|first4=Lene|date=February 2017|title=Biomarkers for the Detection of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure: A Review|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|volume=41|issue=2|pages=251–261|doi=10.1111/acer.13309|pmid=28098942|s2cid=2595225}}</ref> or other reliable sources.

Exposure level is assessed as ''confirmed exposure'', ''unknown exposure'', and ''confirmed absence of exposure'' by the IOM, CDC and Canadian diagnostic systems. The "4-Digit Diagnostic Code" further distinguishes confirmed exposure as ''High Risk'' and ''Some Risk'':

* High Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy known to be at high [[blood alcohol content|blood alcohol levels]] (100&nbsp;mg/dL or greater) delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy.
* Some Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy with use less than High Risk or unknown usage patterns.
* Unknown Risk: Unknown use of alcohol during pregnancy.
* No Risk: Confirmed absence of prenatal alcohol exposure.

====Confirmed exposure====
Amount, frequency, and timing of prenatal alcohol use can dramatically impact the other three key features of FASD. While consensus exists that alcohol is a teratogen, there is no clear consensus as to what level of exposure is toxic.<ref name=IOM/> The CDC guidelines are silent on these elements diagnostically. The IOM and Canadian guidelines explore this further, acknowledging the importance of significant alcohol exposure from regular or heavy episodic alcohol consumption in determining, but offer no standard for diagnosis. Canadian guidelines discuss this lack of clarity and parenthetically point out that "heavy alcohol use" is defined by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] as five or more drinks per episode on five or more days during a 30-day period.<ref>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. (2000). National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. ''Tenth special report to the U.S Congress on alcohol and health: Highlights frfom current research''. Washington, DC: The Institute.</ref>

"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code" ranking system distinguishes between levels of prenatal alcohol exposure as ''high risk'' and ''some risk''. It operationalizes high risk exposure as a [[blood alcohol content|blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) greater than 100&nbsp;mg/dL delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy. This BAC level is typically reached by a 55&nbsp;kg female drinking six to eight beers in one sitting.<ref name =4digitcode/>

====Unknown exposure====
For many adopted or adults and children in foster care, records or other reliable sources may not be available for review. Reporting alcohol use during pregnancy can also be stigmatizing to birth mothers, especially if alcohol use is ongoing.<ref name=CDC/> In these cases, all diagnostic systems use an unknown prenatal alcohol exposure designation. A diagnosis of FAS is still possible with an unknown exposure level if other key features of FASD are present at clinical levels.

====Confirmed absence of exposure====
Confirmed absence of exposure would apply to planned pregnancies in which no alcohol was used or pregnancies of women who do not use alcohol or report no use during the pregnancy. This designation is relatively rare, as most people presenting for an FASD evaluation are at least ''suspected'' to have had a prenatal alcohol exposure due to presence of other key features of FASD.<ref name =4digitcode/><ref name =CDC/>

==== Biomarkers ====
Evidence is insufficient for the use of chemical biomarkers to detect prenatal alcohol exposure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McQuire|first1=C.|last2=Paranjothy|first2=S.|last3=Hurt|first3=L.|last4=Mann|first4=M.|last5=Farewell|first5=D.|last6=Kemp|first6=A.|date=2016-09-01|title=Objective Measures of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure: A Systematic Review|journal=Pediatrics|volume=138|issue=3|pages=e20160517|doi=10.1542/peds.2016-0517|issn=0031-4005|pmid=27577579|s2cid=420106}}</ref> Biomarkers being studied include fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) detected in the meconium (first feces of an infant) and hair. FAEE may be present if chronic alcohol exposure occurs during the 2nd and 3rd trimester since this is when the meconium begins to form. Concentrations of FAEE can be influence by medication use, diet, and individual genetic variations in FAEE metabolism however.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bager|first1=Heidi|last2=Christensen|first2=Lars Porskjær|last3=Husby|first3=Steffen|last4=Bjerregaard|first4=Lene|date=2017|title=Biomarkers for the Detection of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure: A Review|journal=Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research|volume=41|issue=2|pages=251–261|doi=10.1111/acer.13309|pmid=28098942|s2cid=2595225|issn=1530-0277}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Dejong|first1=Katherine|last2=Olyaei|first2=Amy|last3=Lo|first3=Jamie O.|date=March 2019|title=Alcohol Use in Pregnancy|journal=Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=62|issue=1|pages=142–155|doi=10.1097/GRF.0000000000000414|pmid=30575614|pmc=7061927|issn=0009-9201}}</ref>

===Ten brain domains===
A recent effort to standardize assessment of functional CNS damage has been suggested by an experienced FASD diagnostic team in Minnesota. The proposed framework attempts to harmonize IOM, 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, CDC, and Canadian guidelines for measuring CNS damage vis-à-vis FASD evaluations and diagnosis. The standardized approach is referred to as the Ten Brain Domains and encompasses aspects of all four diagnostic systems' recommendations for assessing CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure. The framework provides clear definitions of brain dysfunction, specifies empirical data needed for accurate diagnosis, and defines intervention considerations that address the complex nature of FASD with the intention to avoid common secondary disabilities.<ref name=Lang/>

The proposed Ten Brain Domains include:<ref name=Lang/>
*[[Outcome-based education|Achievement]], [[adaptive behavior]], [[attention]], [[cognition]], [[executive functioning]], [[language]], [[memory]], [[motor skills]], [[multisensory integration]] or soft [[Neurology|neurological]] problems, social [[communication]]<ref name=Lang>{{cite journal |last1=Lang |first1=Jeannette |year=2006 |title=Ten Brain Domains: A Proposal for Functional Central Nervous System Parameters for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis and Follow-up |journal=Journal of the FAS Institute |volume=4 |pages=1–11 |url=http://www.motherisk.org/JFAS_documents/JFAS_5012_Final_e12_6.28.6.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926012830/http://www.motherisk.org/JFAS_documents/JFAS_5012_Final_e12_6.28.6.pdf |archive-date=26 September 2006 |df=dmy-all |access-date=4 February 2007 }}</ref>

The Fetal Alcohol Diagnostic Program (FADP) uses unpublished Minnesota state criteria of performance at 1.5 or more [[standard deviation]]s on [[standardized testing]] in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains to determine CNS damage. However, the Ten Brain Domains are easily incorporated into any of the four diagnostic systems' CNS damage criteria, as the framework only proposes the domains, rather than the cut-off criteria for FASD.<ref name=fadp>[http://www.fadpmn.org FADP – Fetal Alcohol Diagnostic Program<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223032007/http://www.fadpmn.org/ |date=23 February 2007 }}</ref>

===Differential diagnosis===
The CDC reviewed nine [[syndromes]] that have overlapping features with FAS; however, none of these syndromes include all three FAS facial features, and none are the result of prenatal alcohol exposure:<ref name=CDC/>
*[[Aarskog syndrome]]
*[[Williams syndrome]]
*[[Noonan syndrome]]
*[[Dubowitz syndrome]]
*[[Cornelia de Lange syndrome|Brachman-DeLange syndrome]]
*[[Toluene (toxicology)|Toluene syndrome]]
*[[Fetal hydantoin syndrome]]
*[[Neural tube defects|Fetal valproate syndrome]]
*Maternal [[Phenylketonuria|PKU]] fetal effects

Other disorders that have similar symptoms may include:<ref name="Overlapping Behavioral Characteristics of FASD's & Related Mental Health Diagnosis">{{cite web |title=Overlapping Behavioral Characteristics of FASD's & Related Mental Health Diagnosis |url=http://i1.wp.com/www.fasdfamilies.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/overlapping-characteristics-sources1.jpg?resize=791%2C1024 |website=www.fasdfamilies.com |publisher=Cathy Bruer-Thompson |access-date=28 July 2019}}</ref>

==Prevention==
{{See also|Alcohol and pregnancy}}
The only certain way to prevent FAS is to avoid drinking alcohol during pregnancy.<ref name=FASGuide/><ref>{{cite web|title=Alcohol and Pregnancy Questions and Answers {{!}} FASD {{!}} NCBDDD {{!}} CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/faqs.html|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=25 September 2017|date=4 August 2017}}</ref> In the United States, the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] recommended in 1981, and again in 2005, that women abstain from alcohol use while pregnant or while planning a pregnancy, the latter to avoid damage even in the earliest stages (even weeks) of a pregnancy, as the woman may not be aware that she has [[Fertilisation|conceived]].<ref name=SG/> The Centers for Disease Control and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommend no alcohol during pregnancy.<ref name=":0" /> In the United States, federal legislation has required that warning labels be placed on all alcoholic beverage containers since 1988 under the [[Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act]].

There is some controversy surrounding the "zero-tolerance" approach taken by many countries when it comes to alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The assertion that moderate drinking causes FAS is said to lack strong evidence and, in fact, the practice of equating a responsible level of drinking with potential harm to the fetus may have negative social, legal, and health impacts.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fetal alcohol syndrome: the origins of a moral panic |journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |doi=10.1093/alcalc/35.3.276 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=276–282 |date=1 May 2000 |df=dmy-all |last1=Armstrong |first1=E. M. |pmid=10869248 }}</ref> In addition, special care should be taken when considering statistics on this disease, as prevalence and causation is often linked with FASD, which is more common and causes less harm, as opposed to FAS.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/data.html |title=Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) |website=Center for Disease Control |access-date=2017-09-09 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728021804/https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/data.html |archive-date=28 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Treatment==
There is no cure for FASD, but treatment is possible. Early intervention from birth to age 3 has been shown to improve the development of a child born with FASD.<ref name=":0" /> Because CNS damage, symptoms, secondary disabilities, and needs vary widely by individual, there is no one treatment type that works for everyone.

===Medication===
[[Psychoactive drug]]s are frequently tried on those with FASD as many FASD symptoms are mistaken for or overlap with other disorders, most notably [[ADHD]].<ref name=Buxton/>

===Behavioral interventions===
[[Behaviorism|Behavioral]] interventions are based on the [[Learning theory (education)|learning theory]], which is the basis for many parenting and [[Psychology|professional]] strategies and interventions.<ref name=MalbinTry/> Along with ordinary [[parenting styles]], such strategies are frequently used by default for treating those with FAS, as the diagnoses [[oppositional defiance disorder]] (ODD), [[conduct disorder]], [[reactive attachment disorder]] (RAD) often overlap with FAS (along with [[ADHD]]), and these are sometimes thought to benefit from behavioral interventions. Frequently, a person's poor academic achievement results in [[special education]] services, which also utilizes principles of [[Learning theory (education)|learning theory]], [[behavior modification]], and [[outcome-based education]].

===Developmental framework===
Many books and handouts on FAS recommend a developmental approach, based on [[developmental psychology]], even though most do not specify it as such and provide little theoretical background. Optimal human development generally occurs in identifiable stages (e.g., [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[theory of cognitive development]], [[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]], [[John Bowlby]]'s [[Attachment theory|attachment framework]], and other [[developmental stage theories]]). FAS interferes with normal development,<ref name=McCreight/> which may cause stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed. Over time, an unaffected child can negotiate the increasing demands of life by progressing through stages of development normally, but not so for a child with FAS.<ref name=McCreight/>

By knowing what developmental stages and tasks children follow, treatment and interventions for FAS can be tailored to helping a person meet developmental tasks and demands successfully.<ref name=McCreight/> If a person is delayed in the [[adaptive behavior]] domain, for instance, then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice (e.g., practiced instruction on tying shoelaces), giving reminders, or making accommodations (e.g., using slip-on shoes) to support the desired functioning level. This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person's developmental context into account while developing interventions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Advocacy model===
The [[advocacy]] model takes the point of view that someone is needed to actively mediate between the environment and the person with FAS.<ref name=FASGuide/> Advocacy activities are conducted by an advocate (for example, a family member, friend, or [[Case management (mental health)|case manager]]) and fall into three basic categories. An advocate for FAS: (1) interprets FAS and the disabilities that arise from it and explains it to the environment in which the person operates, (2) engenders change or accommodation on behalf of the person, and (3) assists the person in developing and reaching attainable goals.<ref name=FASGuide/>

The advocacy model is often recommended, for example, when developing an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) for the person's progress at school.<ref name=Buxton>Buxton, B. (2005). ''Damaged Angels: An Adoptive Mother Discovers the Tragic Toll of Alcohol in Pregnancy''. New York: Carroll & Graf. {{ISBN|0-7867-1550-2}}.</ref>

An understanding of the developmental framework would presumably inform and enhance the advocacy model, but advocacy also implies interventions at a systems level as well, such as educating schools, social workers, and so forth on best practices for FAS. However, several organizations devoted to FAS also use the advocacy model at a [[community practice]] level as well.<ref name=agencies>[http://www.nofas.org National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405231125/http://www.nofas.org/ |date=5 April 2007 }} [http://www.mofas.org Minnesota Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405231157/http://www.mofas.org/ |date=5 April 2007 }}  Retrieved on 2007-04-11</ref>

===Public health and policy===
Treating FAS at the [[public health]] and [[public policy]] level promotes FAS prevention and diversion of [[Public services|public resources]] to assist those with FAS.<ref name=FASGuide/> It is related to the advocacy model but promoted at a systems level (rather than with the individual or family), such as developing community education and supports, state or province level prevention efforts (e.g., screening for maternal alcohol use during [[OB/GYN]] or prenatal medical care visits), or national awareness programs. Several organizations and state agencies in the U.S. are dedicated to this type of intervention.<ref name=agencies/>

The US Centers for Disease Control estimates 3 million women in the United States are at risk of having a baby with FASD, and recommended that women of child-bearing age should be on birth control or abstain from drinking alcohol as the safest way to avoid this.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0202-alcohol-exposed-pregnancy.html|title=More than 3 million US women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancy &#124; CDC Online Newsroom &#124; CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-20|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121002034/https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0202-alcohol-exposed-pregnancy.html|archive-date=21 November 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2 February 2016}}</ref>

==Prognosis==

===Primary disabilities===
The primary disabilities of FAS are the functional difficulties with which the child is born as a result of CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure.<ref name=2disabilities>Streissguth, A.P., Barr, H.M., Kogan, J., & Bookstein, F.L. (1996). ''Understanding the occurrence of secondary disabilities in clients with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol effects (FAE): Final report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Grant No. RO4/CCR008515'' (Tech. Report No. 96-06). Seattle: University of Washington, Fetal Alcohol and Drug Unit.</ref>

Often, primary disabilities are mistaken as ''behavior problems'', but the underlying CNS damage is the originating source of a functional difficulty,<ref name="MalbinFAE">Malbin, D. (1993). ''Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, Fetal Alcohol Effects: Strategies for Professionals''. Center City, MN: Hazelden. {{ISBN|0-89486-951-5}}</ref> rather than a mental health condition, which is considered a secondary disability. The exact mechanisms for functional problems of primary disabilities are not always fully understood, but [[Animal testing|animal studies]] have begun to shed light on some correlates between functional problems and brain structures damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure.<ref name=FASGuide/> Representative examples include:

* [[Learning disability|Learning impairments]] are associated with impaired [[dendrite]]s of the [[hippocampus]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Abel EL, Jacobson S, Sherwin BT | year = 1983 | title = In utero alcohol exposure: Functional and structural brain damage | journal = Neurobehavioral Toxicology and Teratology | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 363–366 | pmid = 6877477 }}</ref>
* Impaired [[Motor skill|motor development]] and functioning are associated with reduced size of the [[cerebellum]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Meyer L, Kotch L, Riley E |title=Neonatal ethanol exposure: functional alterations associated with cerebellar growth retardation |journal=Neurotoxicol Teratol |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=15–22 |year=1990 |pmid=2314357 |doi=10.1016/0892-0362(90)90107-N}}</ref>
* [[Hyperactivity]] is associated with decreased size of the [[corpus callosum]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zimmerberg B, Mickus LA | year = 1990 | title = Sex differences in corpus callosum: Influence of prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal undernutrition | journal = Brain Research | volume = 537 | issue = 1–2| pages = 115–122 | pmid = 2085766 | doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)90347-e| s2cid = 21989095 }}</ref>

Functional difficulties may result from CNS damage in more than one domain, but common functional difficulties by domain include:<ref name=FASGuide/><ref name=MalbinTry/><ref name=McCreight>McCreight, B. (1997). ''Recognizing and Managing Children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome/Fetal Alcohol Effects: A Guidebook''. Washington, DC: CWLA. {{ISBN|0-87868-607-X}}.</ref><ref name=MalbinFAE/> Note that this is not an exhaustive list of difficulties.

* Achievement: [[Learning disability|Learning disabilities]]
* Adaptive behavior: Poor [[Deferred gratification|impulse control]], poor [[personal boundaries]], poor [[anger management]], stubbornness, intrusive behavior, too friendly with strangers, poor [[daily living skills]], developmental delays
* Attention: [[ADHD|Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder]] (ADHD), poor attention or concentration, distractible
* Cognition: [[Intellectual disability]], confusion under pressure, poor [[Abstraction|abstract skills]], difficulty distinguishing between fantasy and reality, slower [[cognitive processing]]
* Executive functioning: Poor [[Decision making|judgment]], [[Sensory processing disorder|Information-processing disorder]], poor at perceiving patterns, poor cause and effect reasoning, inconsistent at linking words to actions, poor [[generalization]] ability
* Language: [[Expressive language disorder|Expressive]] or [[Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder|receptive]] language disorders, grasp parts but not whole concepts, lack understanding of metaphor, idioms, or sarcasm
* Memory: Poor [[short-term memory]], inconsistent memory and knowledge base
* Motor skills: Poor handwriting, poor [[fine motor skill]]s, poor [[gross motor skill]]s, [[Developmental coordination disorder|delayed motor skill development]] (e.g., riding a bicycle at appropriate age)
* [[Sensory processing]] and soft neurological problems: [[sensory processing disorder]], sensory defensiveness, undersensitivity to stimulation
* Social communication: Intrude into conversations, inability to read [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal]] or [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social]] cues, "chatty" but without substance

===Secondary disabilities===
The secondary disabilities of FAS are those that arise later in life secondary to CNS damage. These disabilities often emerge over time due to a mismatch between the primary disabilities and environmental expectations; secondary disabilities can be ameliorated with early interventions and appropriate supportive services.<ref name=2disabilities/>

Six main secondary disabilities were identified in a University of Washington research study of 473 subjects diagnosed with FAS, PFAS (partial fetal alcohol syndrome), and ARND (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder):<ref name=FASGuide/><ref name=2disabilities/>

* Mental health problems: Diagnosed with [[ADHD]], [[Clinical Depression]], or other [[mental illness]], experienced by over 90% of the subjects
* Disrupted school experience: Suspended or expelled from school or dropped out of school, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older)
* Trouble with the law: Charged or convicted with a crime, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older)
* Confinement: For inpatient psychiatric care, inpatient chemical dependency care, or incarcerated for a crime, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older)
* Inappropriate sexual behavior: Sexual advances, sexual touching, or promiscuity, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older)
* Alcohol and drug problems: Abuse or dependency, experienced by 35% of the subjects (age 12 and older)

Two additional secondary disabilities exist for adults:<ref name=FASGuide/><ref name=2disabilities/>

* Dependent living: Group home, living with family or friends, or some sort of assisted living, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older)
* Problems with employment: Required ongoing job training or coaching, could not keep a job, unemployed, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older)

===Protective factors and strengths===
Eight factors were identified in the same study as universal protective factors that reduced the incidence rate of the secondary disabilities:<ref name=FASGuide/><ref name=2disabilities/>
* Living in a stable and nurturing home for over 73% of life
* Being diagnosed with FAS before age six
* Never having experienced violence
* Remaining in each living situation for at least 2.8 years
* Experiencing a "good quality home" (meeting 10 or more defined qualities) from age 8 to 12 years old
* Having been found eligible for developmental disability (DD) services
* Having basic needs met for at least 13% of life
* Having a diagnosis of FAS (rather than another FASD condition)

Malbin (2002) has identified the following areas of interests and talents as strengths that often stand out for those with FASD and should be utilized, like any strength, in treatment planning:<ref name="MalbinTry"/>
*Music, playing instruments, composing, singing, art, spelling, reading, computers, mechanics, woodworking, skilled vocations (welding, electrician, etc.), writing, poetry
*Participation in non-impact sport or physical fitness activities

=== Lifespan ===
One study found that the people with FASD had a significantly shorter [[life expectancy]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Thanh|first1=Nguyen Xuan|last2=Jonsson|first2=Egon|date=2016|title=Life Expectancy of People with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome|journal=Journal of Population Therapeutics and Clinical Pharmacology = Journal de la Therapeutique des Populations et de la Pharmacologie Clinique|volume=23|issue=1|pages=e53–59|issn=2561-8741|pmid=26962962}}</ref>

==Epidemiology==
FASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe.<ref name=CDC2015Prev/> FAS is believed to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1000 live births in the United States.<ref name=CDC2015Prev/> The lifetime costs of an individual with FAS were estimated to be two million USD in 2002.<ref name=CDC2015Prev/> Drinking any quantity during pregnancy, the risk of giving birth to a child with FASD is about 15%, and to a child with FAS about 1.5%. Drinking large quantities, defined as 2 [[standard drink]]s a day, or 6 standard drinks in a short time, carries a 50% risk of a FAS birth.<ref name="Popova2017">{{cite journal|last1= Popova S.|last2= Lange S. |last3=Probst C. |last4=Gmel G. |last5= Rehm J.|title=Estimation of national, regional, and global prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy and fetal alcohol syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=The Lancet Global Health|doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(17)30021-9|volume=5 |date=2017|issue= 3 |pages= E290–E299|pmid=28089487}}</ref>

==History==

From the 1960s to the 1980s, alcohol was commonly used as a [[tocolytic]], a method to stop preterm labor. The method originated with Dr. Fritz Fuchs, the chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Cornell University Medical College.<ref name="Armstrong, E. M. 2003">Armstrong, E. M. (2003). Conceiving risk, bearing responsibility: Fetal alcohol syndrome & the diagnosis of moral disorder.

In later stages of pregnancy, the alcohol was administered intravenously and often in large amounts. "Women experienced similar effects as occur with oral ingestion, including intoxication, nausea and vomiting, and potential alcohol poisoning, followed by hangovers when the alcohol was discontinued."<ref>King, T. L., & Brucker, M. C. (2011). Pharmacology for women's health. Sudbury, MA: Jones and Bartlett.</ref> Vomiting put the mother at a high risk for aspiration and was "a brutal procedure for all involved."<ref name="Armstrong, E. M. 2003"/> Because the alcohol was being given intravenously, the doctor could continue giving the treatment to the mother long after she had passed out, resulting in her being more intoxicated than would otherwise be possible.

The earliest recorded observation of possible links between maternal alcohol use and fetal damage was made in 1899 by Dr. William Sullivan, a [[Liverpool]] prison physician who noted higher rates of [[stillbirth]] for 120 alcoholic female prisoners than their sober female relatives; he suggested the causal agent to be alcohol use.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sullivan W.C. | year = 1899 | title = A note on the influence of maternal inebriety on the offspring | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1448716| journal = Journal of Mental Science | volume = 45 | issue = 190| pages = 489–503 | doi=10.1192/bjp.45.190.489}}</ref> This contradicted the predominating belief at the time that heredity caused intellectual disability, poverty, and criminal behavior, which contemporary studies on the subjects usually concluded.<ref name=FASGuide/> A case study by [[Henry H.

Prior to fetal alcohol syndrome being specifically identified and named in 1973, only a few studies had noted differences between the children of mothers who used alcohol during [[pregnancy]] or [[breast-feeding]] and those who did not, and identified alcohol use as a possible contributing factor rather than heredity.<ref name=FASGuide/>

===Recognition as a syndrome===
Fetal alcohol syndrome was named in 1973 by two [[Dysmorphology|dysmorphologists]], Drs. Kenneth Lyons Jones and [[David Weyhe Smith]] of the [[University of Washington]] Medical School in [[Seattle]], United States. They identified a pattern of "craniofacial, limb, and cardiovascular defects associated with prenatal onset growth deficiency and developmental delay" in eight unrelated children of three [[Ethnicity|ethnic]] groups, all born to mothers who were [[alcoholic]]s.<ref name=Jonesetal1973/> The pattern of malformations indicated that the damage was prenatal. News of the discovery shocked some, while others were skeptical of the findings.<ref name=Streissguth1>Streissguth, A.P. (2002). In A. Streissguth, & J. Kanter (Eds.), ''The Challenge in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Overcoming Secondary Disabilities.'' Seattle: University of WA Press. {{ISBN|0-295-97650-0}}.</ref>

Within nine years of the Washington discovery, animal studies, including non-human monkey studies carried out at the University of Washington Primate Center by Dr. [[Sterling Clarren]], had confirmed that alcohol was a [[Teratogenesis|teratogen]]. By 1978, 245 cases of FAS had been reported by medical researchers, and the syndrome began to be described as the most frequent known cause of [[intellectual disability]].

While many [[syndrome]]s are [[eponym]]ous, i.e. named after the physician first reporting the association of symptoms, Dr. Smith named FAS after the causal agent of the symptoms.<ref name=foreword>Clarren, S.K.

Over time, as subsequent research and clinical experience suggested that a range of effects (including physical, behavioral, and cognitive) could arise from prenatal alcohol exposure, the term [[Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder]] (FASD) was developed to include FAS as well as other conditions resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure.<ref name=foreword/> Currently, FAS<ref name=IOM/><ref name=FAE>{{cite journal |author1=Clarren S.K. |author2=Smith D.W. | year = 1978 | title = Fetal alcohol syndrome | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 298 | issue = 19| pages = 1063–1067 | pmid = 347295 | doi=10.1056/NEJM197805112981906}}</ref><ref name=Jonesetal1973>{{cite journal |author1=Jones K.L. |author2=Smith D.W |author3=Ulleland C.N. |author4=Streissguth A.P. | year = 1973 | title = Pattern of malformation in offspring of chronic alcoholic mothers | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 7815| pages = 1267–1271 | pmid = 4126070 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(73)91291-9}}</ref> is the only expression of prenatal alcohol exposure defined by the [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] and assigned [[ICD-9]] and diagnoses.

In [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1932 novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' (where all fetuses are gestated [[in vitro]] in a factory), lower [[caste]] fetuses are created by receiving alcohol transfusions to reduce intelligence and height, thus conditioning them for simple, menial tasks. Connections between alcohol and incubating embryos are made multiple times in the novel. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Jasmine M |last2=Bland |first2=Roger |last3=Jonsson |first3=Egon |last4=Greenshaw |first4=Andrew J |title=A Brief History of Awareness of the Link Between Alcohol and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |date=March 2019 |volume=64 |issue=3 |page=166 |doi = 10.1177/0706743718777403 |pmid = 29807454}}</ref>
