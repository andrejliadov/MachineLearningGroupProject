'''School health and nutrition services''' are services provided through the school system to improve the health and well-being of children and in some cases whole families and the broader community.  These services have been developed in different ways around the globe but the fundamentals are constant: the early detection, correction, prevention or amelioration of disease, disability and abuse from which school aged children can suffer.

==Background==
It was shown by [[statistics]] that many [[pupil]]s were behind in their studies only because of lack of physical vitality.<ref name=colliers/> In 1920, it was shown that so many pupils in the schools of [[Brooklyn, New York]], were compelled to pass through the same grades twice that, at the average cost of $40 a term for each pupil, the [[borough]] lost $2,000,000. On this basis various [[social organization]]s demanded an [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]] from the city of $100,000 for more effective medical aid to the school children, contending that more than half of the extra expense could thus be saved. Out of 252,000 school-children inspected in [[New York City]] in 1919, 74% were found defective physically, defective teeth and vision being the chief faults.<ref name=colliers>{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Schools, Medical inspection of|year=1921}}</ref>

==Unesco Tools==
Unesco has published a set of tools, to support the [[FRESH, UNESCO|FRESH]] framework, to guide those wishing to set up school health services around the world.  Designed primarily for developing nations, these tools can be of universal use [https://web.archive.org/web/20091006100958/http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D35173%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html]. The main emphasis of these tools is on: 
*[[HIV/AIDS]]
*Food and nutrition
*[[Helminths]] and hygiene
*[[Malaria]]
*Violence
*[[Drugs]], [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]

==United States==
School health services are well developed in the United States. Central guidelines are provided by ''Making Health Academic'' but each state and within that each [[school board]] has adopted its own specific methods.

===Making Health Academic===
This is a five-year project funded by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]'s Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) designed to enable all schools to be part of a co-ordinated school health program. The project is built around the fact that six preventable behaviours, mainly learned in [[childhood]] and [[youth]], account for most of the serious illnesses and premature deaths in the United States; these are:[http://www2.edc.org/makinghealthacademic/cshp.asp#rationale]

===Examples of existing services===
*[[Massachusetts]]. An example from a maritime state is [http://www.mass.gov/dph/fch/schoolhealth/index.htm] where a typical mission statement starts "School Health Services fosters the growth, development and educational achievement of Massachusetts' students by promoting their health and wellbeing ... "
*[[New Mexico]]. An example from a southern state is [http://www.healthierschools.org/] where an interesting "[[yucca]] model of coordinated school health" is used to help visualize the inter-relationship of the services.

*[[American School Health Association]]

==United Kingdom==
The health of children and youth in the UK is mainly the responsibility of the [[National Health Service|NHS]], for example child health screening [http://www.nsc.nhs.uk/ch_screen/child_ind.htm] and advice for parents of overweight children [http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=823]. School based services are therefore more limited than in the US.

===Examples of existing services===
*[[England]] - Warrington [https://web.archive.org/web/20061231075316/http://www.warrington.gov.uk/learning/school_health.asp]
*[[Northern Ireland]] [http://www.sebt.n-i.nhs.uk/index2.html]
*[[Scotland]] [http://www.sciennes.edin.sch.uk/handbook/healthservice.html]

==Morocco==
Indicators of school health in Morocco are troublesome. A recent article by the European Institute of Health Sciences (Institut Européen des Sciences de la Santé) in [[Casablanca]] noted that:
* 15% of school children in Morocco (1.25 million) live with chronic medical conditions such as bronchial asthma, allergies, diabetes mellitus, anemia, epilepsy, congenital diseases and cancer.
* 10% to 25% of injuries to children occur while they are in school.
* 85% of infections occurring in school children are transmitted in school.
* 15% of school children suffer from an emotional or behavioral problem. One-third of them will have serious dysfunction.
* Statistics about engagement of Moroccan youth in risky behaviors are alarming.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Institut Européen des Sciences de la Santé|title=Facts about school health in morocco|url=http://iessmaroc.com/|website=IESS Maroc|accessdate=1 August 2014}} (not in cited reference)</ref>

School health services are traditionally provided by school nurses, but there is a severe shortage of qualified school nurses. The Institute therefore proposes both a one-year specialization program in school nursing designed for registered general nurses and a one-year program for qualifying teachers in providing school health services.

==Other countries==
School health systems are expanding in low- and middle-income countries. Information on school health in these countries is collated on the Schools and Health website [http://www.schoolsandhealth.org] maintained by the [[Partnership for Child Development]].  A database of School Health and Nutrition (SHN) Programmes in low and middle income countries can be found on the site:

==History==
[[Inspection (medicine)|Medical inspection]] in schools was first instituted in [[France]] in 1886, then, in succession, this example was followed by [[Belgium]], [[Hungary]], [[Chile]], [[Germany]] and [[Great Britain]], the latter in 1908. In the United States, medical inspection in schools was first instituted in [[New York City]] in 1892, then in [[Boston]] in 1894, in [[Chicago]] in 1895, and in [[Philadelphia]] in 1898.<ref name=colliers/>
