'''Chronic mountain sickness''' ('''CMS''') is a disease in which the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells increases ([[polycythaemia]]) and there is an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood ([[hypoxemia]]). CMS typically develops after extended time living at high altitude (over {{convert|2500|metres|feet}}). It is most common amongst native populations of high altitude nations.<ref name="Leon" /> The most frequent symptoms of CMS are headache, dizziness, [[tinnitus]], [[Dyspnoea|breathlessness]], [[palpitations]], sleep disturbance, fatigue, [[anorexia (symptom)|loss of appetite]], confusion, [[cyanosis]], and dilation of veins.<ref name="Wu">{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=TY|title=Chronic mountain sickness on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.|journal=Chinese Medical Journal|date=20 January 2005|volume=118|issue=2|pages=161–8|pmid=15667803}}</ref>

CMS was first described in 1925 by [[Carlos Monge Medrano]], a [[Peru]]vian doctor who specialised in diseases of high altitude.<ref name="Monge">{{cite journal|last1=Monge|first1=CC|last2=Whittembury|first2=J|title=Chronic mountain sickness.|journal=The Johns Hopkins Medical Journal|date=December 1976|volume=139 SUPPL|pages=87–9|pmid=1011412}}</ref> While [[Altitude sickness|acute mountain sickness]] is experienced shortly after ascent to high altitude, chronic mountain sickness may develop only after many years of living at high altitude. In medicine, high altitude is defined as over {{convert|2500|metres|feet}}, but most cases of CMS occur at over {{convert|3000|metres|feet}}.

It has recently been correlated with increased expression of the genes ''[[ANP32D]]'' and ''[[SENP1]]''.<ref name="Zhou">{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=D|last2=Udpa|first2=N|last3=Ronen|first3=R|last4=Stobdan|first4=T|last5=Liang|first5=J|display-authors=etal|title=Whole-genome sequencing uncovers the genetic basis of chronic mountain sickness in Andean highlanders.|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|date=5 September 2013|volume=93|issue=3|pages=452–62|pmid=23954164|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.07.011|pmc=3769925}}</ref><ref name="Cole">{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=AM|last2=Petousi|first2=N|last3=Cavalleri|first3=GL|last4=Robbins|first4=PA|title=Genetic variation in SENP1 and ANP32D as predictors of chronic mountain sickness.|journal=High Altitude Medicine & Biology|date=December 2014|volume=15|issue=4|pages=497–9|pmid=25225945|doi=10.1089/ham.2014.1036|pmc=4273201}}</ref>

== Diagnosis ==
CMS is characterised by [[polycythaemia]] (with subsequent increased [[haematocrit]]) and [[hypoxaemia]]; raised blood pressure in the lungs ([[pulmonary hypertension]]) can develop over time and in some cases progress to heart failure ([[cor pulmonale]]).<ref name="Leon" /> CMS is believed to arise because of an excessive production of red blood cells ([[erythrocytes]]) due to the low oxygen levels at altitude, which increases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood{{ref|O2}}. The increased levels of erythrocytes causes increased blood viscosity and uneven blood flow through the lungs ([[Ventilation/perfusion ratio|V/Q mismatch]]). However, CMS is also considered an adaptation of pulmonary and heart disease to life under chronic hypoxia at altitude.<ref name="Zub">{{cite journal|last1=Zubieta-Castillo G|first1=Sr|last2=Zubieta-Calleja GR|first2=Jr|last3=Zubieta-Calleja|first3=L|title=Chronic mountain sickness: the reaction of physical disorders to chronic hypoxia.|journal=Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology|date=September 2006|volume=57 Suppl 4|pages=431–42|pmid=17072074|url=http://www.altitudeclinic.com/}}</ref>

Consensus for clinical diagnosis of CMS use laboratory values: [[haemoglobin]] in Males ≥ 21 g/dL; Females ≥ 19 g/dL, [[haematocrit]] > 65%, and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) < 85% in both genders.<ref name="Leon">{{cite journal|last1=León-Velarde|first1=F|last2=Maggiorini|first2=M|last3=Reeves|first3=JT|last4=Aldashev|first4=A|last5=Asmus|first5=I|display-authors=etal|title=Consensus statement on chronic and subacute high altitude diseases.|journal=High Altitude Medicine & Biology|date=2005|volume=6|issue=2|pages=147–57|doi=10.1089/ham.2005.6.147|pmid=16060849|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7686405}}</ref>

== Treatment ==
Migration to low altitude is curative, though not immediate, as the body adapts to the normal oxygen level near sea-level and the haematocrit normalises. Alternatively, bloodletting ([[phlebotomy]]) can be performed to lower the haematocrit temporarily; when combined with volume replacement with fluids this can have a longer effect.<ref name="Leon" />

Medication with [[acetazolamide]], a [[carbonic anhydrase inhibitor]], has been shown to improve chronic mountain sickness by reducing [[erythropoietin]] and the resulting polycythaemia, which results in better arterial oxygenation and a lower heart rate.<ref name="Richalet">{{cite journal|last1=Richalet|first1=JP|last2=Rivera|first2=M|last3=Bouchet|first3=P|last4=Chirinos|first4=E|last5=Onnen|first5=I|display-authors=etal|title=Acetazolamide: a treatment for chronic mountain sickness.|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=1 December 2005|volume=172|issue=11|pages=1427–33|doi=10.1164/rccm.200505-807OC|pmid=16126936}}</ref>

Oxygen therapy and training in slow breathing techniques has been shown to reduce symptoms through increasing blood oxygenation.<ref name="Leon" />

== Epidemiology==
Although CMS generally affects people native to altitudes higher than {{convert|3000|metres|feet}}, it does not affect populations around the world equally. A recent study by Sahota and Panwar (2013)<ref name="Sahota">{{cite journal|last1=Sahota|first1=I|last2=Panwar|first2=N|title=Prevalence of Chronic Mountain Sickness in high altitude districts of Himachal Pradesh |journal=Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine |date=September 2013 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=94–100|doi= 10.4103/0019-5278.130839 |pmid=24872667 |pmc=4035612}}</ref> reviewed CMS [[prevalence rate]]s around the world and found the highest rates were found in Andean countries of South America and the lowest rates in people native to the [[East African Mountains]] of Ethiopia. CMS prevalence rates reported from the study are summarised below:

* Ethiopia [3600–4100&nbsp;m]: 0%
* Tibetan Plateau (Tibetans): 0.91–1.2%
* Indian Himalayas [3000–4200&nbsp;m]: 4–7%
* Kyrgyzstan [3000–4200&nbsp;m]: 4.6%
* Tibetan Plateau (Han Chinese): 5.6%
* La Paz, Bolivia [3600&nbsp;m]: 6% to 8%
* Bolivia: 8–10%
* Cerro de Pasco, Peru [4300&nbsp;m]: 14.8–18.2%
