{{short description|Medical condition affecting the cervical spine}}
'''Craniocervical instability''' is a [[medical condition]] where there is excessive movement of the vertebrae at the [[atlanto-occipital joint]] and the [[atlanto-axial joint]], that is, between the [[skull]] and the top two [[vertebrae]] ([[Atlas (anatomy)|C1]] and [[Axis (anatomy)|C2]]).{{cn|date=January 2020}} This can cause [[neuronal]] injury and compression of nearby structures including the [[spinal cord]], [[vertebral artery]] or [[vagus nerve]], causing a constellation of symptoms. It is frequently co-morbid with [[atlanto-axial instability]], [[Chiari malformation]]<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.2531/spinalsurg.23.168|title = Occipito-atlanto-axial Hypermobility : Clinical Features and Dynamic Analysis of Cranial Settling and Posterior Gliding of Occipital Condyle.

It is more common in people with a [[connective tissue disease]], notably [[Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]],<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1002/ajmg.c.31549|pmid = 28220607|title = Neurological and spinal manifestations of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes|journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C: Seminars in Medical Genetics|volume = 175|issue = 1|pages = 195–211|year = 2017|last1 = Henderson|first1 = Fraser C.|last2 = Austin|first2 = Claudiu|last3 = Benzel|first3 = Edward|last4 = Bolognese|first4 = Paolo|last5 = Ellenbogen|first5 = Richard|last6 = Francomano|first6 = Clair A.|last7 = Ireton|first7 = Candace|last8 = Klinge|first8 = Petra|last9 = Koby|first9 = Myles|last10 = Long|first10 = Donlin|last11 = Patel|first11 = Sunil|last12 = Singman|first12 = Eric L.|last13 = Voermans|first13 = Nicol C.|doi-access = free}}</ref> [[osteogenesis imperfecta]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1136/ard.52.9.629|pmid = 8239756|title = Neuropathology of the brainstem and spinal cord in end stage rheumatoid arthritis: Implications for treatment|journal = Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|volume = 52|issue = 9|pages = 629–637|year = 1993|last1 = Henderson|first1 = F.

==Symptoms and signs==
The impact of craniocervical instability can range from minor symptoms to severe disability, with some patients being bed-bound. The constellation of symptoms caused by craniocervical instability has been labelled the [[cervico-medullary syndrome]].<ref>Batzdorf U, Henderson F, Rigamonti D 2015.

Symptoms are frequently worsened by a [[Valsalva maneuver]] or by being upright for long periods of time. Lying [[supine position|supine]] can bring short-term relief.

==Diagnosis==
Craniocervical instability is usually diagnosed through neuro-anatomical measurement using [[radiography]]. Upright [[magnetic resonance imaging]] is considered the most accurate method, and [[supine]] [[magnetic resonance imaging]], [[CT scan]] or [[digital motion X-ray, or Digital X-ray]] are also used. 

The measurements to diagnose craniocervical instability are:
* Clivo-Axial Angle equal or less than 135 degrees
* Grabb-Oakes measurement equal or greater than 9 mm
* Harris measurement greater than 12mm<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1002/ajmg.c.31549|pmid = 28220607|title = Neurological and spinal manifestations of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes|journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C: Seminars in Medical Genetics|volume = 175|issue = 1|pages = 195–211|year = 2017|last1 = Henderson|first1 = Fraser C.|last2 = Austin|first2 = Claudiu|last3 = Benzel|first3 = Edward|last4 = Bolognese|first4 = Paolo|last5 = Ellenbogen|first5 = Richard|last6 = Francomano|first6 = Clair A.|last7 = Ireton|first7 = Candace|last8 = Klinge|first8 = Petra|last9 = Koby|first9 = Myles|last10 = Long|first10 = Donlin|last11 = Patel|first11 = Sunil|last12 = Singman|first12 = Eric L.|last13 = Voermans|first13 = Nicol C.|doi-access = free}}</ref>
* Spinal [[subluxation]]

Alternatively, craniocervical instability can be diagnosed if a trial of cervical [[traction (orthopedics)|traction]], typically using a [[halo (medicine)|halo fixation device]], results in a significant alleviation of symptoms.

==Treatment==
Conservative treatment of craniocervical instability includes [[physical therapy]] and the use of a [[cervical collar]] to keep the neck stable. [[spinal fusion|Cervical spinal fusion]] is performed on patients with more severe symptoms. [[Prolotherapy]], including with [[stem cells]], is another treatment option used <ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.2174/1874325001408010326|pmid = 25328557|pmc = 4200875|title = Chronic Neck Pain: Making the Connection Between Capsular Ligament Laxity and Cervical Instability|journal = The Open Orthopaedics Journal|volume = 8|pages = 326–345|year = 2014|last1 = Steilen|first1 = Danielle|last2 = Hauser|first2 = Ross|last3 = Woldin|first3 = Barbara|last4 = Sawyer|first4 = Sarah}}</ref> but there is limited scientific evidence on this approach.
