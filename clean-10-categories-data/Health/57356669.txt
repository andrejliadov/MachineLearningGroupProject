The '''Foundling Hospital''' ({{lang-ga|Ospidéal Foundling}}) was a [[hospital]] for abandoned children in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]].

==History==
The Foundling hospital of Dublin was opened in 1704.<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Foundling Hospitals|volume=10|pages=746–747}}</ref>
Firmly established by mid-18th century, the Foundling Hospital had steadily become a large "baby finding" institution. Two primary objectives of the hospital were to avoid deaths and murders of illegitimate children and to teach the Protestant faith to these children.<ref name="Wodsworth1876">{{cite book|editor=Wodsworth, William Dudley|title=A Brief History of the Ancient Foundling Hospital of Dublin, From the Year 1702.

This reduced the annual arrivals to about 500.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/briefhistoryofan00wods#page/52/mode/2up Wodsworth, p. 52.]</ref>

Child deaths during transport to the hospital or whilst staying in the hospital was not infrequent and would often become subject to inquiry. The number of Protestant nurses was usually inadequate with the resulting use of Roman Catholic nurses and occasional consequence of "religious error".<ref name="Wodsworth1876"/>

In 1829 the select committee on the Irish miscellaneous estimates recommended that no further assistance should be given.<ref name=EB1911/> The hospital had not preserved life or educated the foundlings.<ref name=EB1911/> The mortality was nearly 4 in 5, and the total cost £10,000 a year. Accordingly, in 1835 [[Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg|Lord Glenelg]] (then Irish Secretary) closed the institution.<ref name=EB1911/>
