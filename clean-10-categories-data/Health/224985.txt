In the engineering and social sciences, the term '''built environment,''' or '''built world''', refers to the [[human impact on the environment|human-made environment]] that provides the setting for [[human behavior|human activity]], ranging in scale from buildings to cities and beyond. It has been defined as "the human-made space in which people live, work and recreate on a day-to-day basis."<ref name=roof>{{cite journal|last=Roof|first=K|author2=Oleru N.|title=Public Health: Seattle and King County's Push for the Built Environment.|journal=J Environ Health|year=2008|volume=75|pages=24–27}}</ref> 

The built environment encompasses places and spaces created or modified by people to serve their needs of accommodation, organisation and representation.The topic of built environment also includes the ways in which communities have approached environmental issues that have arisen as a result of such altering of the environment for human activities amongst those of plants and animals<ref>{{Cite book|last=Omer|first=Abdeen Mustafa|title=Built Environment : Identifying, Developing, and Moving Sustainable Communities Through Renewable Energy|publisher=Nova Science Publishers, Inc.|year=2015|isbn=978-1-63463-339-0|location=e-book|pages=xxix}}</ref>

The sciences of the built environment cover architecture, urbanism, building technology, civil engineering, landscaping and the management of built stock mutations and operations.

==History==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
Early concepts of built environment date to [[Classical Antiquity]]: [[Hippodamus]] of [[Miletos]], known as the "father of urban planning"{{by whom|date=January 2015}}, developed [[Ancient Greece|Greek cities]] from 498&nbsp;BC to 408&nbsp;BC that created order by using grid plans that mapped the city.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burns|first=Alfred|date=1976|title=Hippodamus and the Planned City|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435519|journal=Historia: Zeitschrift für Alte Geschichte|volume=25|issue=4|pages=414–428|issn=0018-2311}}</ref> These early city plans eventually gave way to the [[City Beautiful movement]] in the late&nbsp;1800s and early&nbsp;1900s, inspired by [[Daniel Hudson Burnham]], a reformist for the Progressivism movement who actively promoted "a reform of the landscape in tandem with political change."<ref>{{cite web|title=The City Beautiful Movement|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~cap/citybeautiful/city.html|accessdate=26 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514005408/http://xroads.virginia.edu/~CAP/CITYBEAUTIFUL/city.html|archive-date=14 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The effort was in partnership with others who believed that beautifying American cities would improve the moral compass of the cities and encourage the upper class to spend their money in cities. This beautification process included parks and architectural design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Architecture: The City Beautiful Movement|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/61.html|accessdate=22 April 2012}}</ref> By mid-century modernist "indifferent" design influenced the character of work and public spaces, followed by what Alexander describes as a late twentieth century "revival of interest relating to the concept of place (including the built environment), and its relevance to mental health and other fields of study."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Donald|date=2008|title=Physical determinism, modernism and mental health|journal=Environments|volume=35|issue=3|hdl=10613/2722}}</ref>

==Modern built environment==
Currently, built environments are typically used to describe the [[interdisciplinary]] field that addresses the design, construction, management, and use of these man-made surroundings as an interrelated whole as well as their relationship to human activities over time (rather than a particular element in isolation or at a single moment in time). The field is generally not regarded as a traditional profession or [[academic discipline]] in its own right, instead drawing upon areas such as [[economics]], law, [[public policy]], public health, [[management]], [[geography]], design, engineering, technology, and [[environmental sustainability]]. Within the field of public health, built environments are referred to as building or renovating areas in an effort to improve the community's well-being through construction of “aesthetically, health improved, and environmentally improved landscapes and living structures”.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Built Environment and Health: 11 Profiles of Neighborhood Transformation|url=http://www.preventioninstitute.org/index.php?option=com_jlibrary&view=article&id=114&Itemid=127|accessdate=12 April 2012}}</ref> For example: community forest user group in Nepal is a multidimensional institution, which serves goods and services to the communities through natural resource management (see [[Climate change adaptation in Nepal]]).

Technology is playing a pivotal role in shaping the industries of today by augmenting processes, streamlining activities, and integrating innovations to propel the functioning of companies and organisations across a multitude of industries and help them achieve new heights. '''[[Building information modeling]]''' ('''BIM''') is prominent practice. It involves illustration & pre-execution overview of physical and functional characteristics of places. BIM tools help the planner in making a future ready informed decision regarding a building or other built asset. Smart Building Management, Drone-based Surveying, [[3D printing|3D Printing]], [[Intelligent transportation system|Intelligent Transportation System]] are recent implementation of technology in modern built environment.

==Public health==
===Physical activity===
In public health, built environment refers to physical environments that are designed with health and wellness as integral parts of the communities. Research has indicated that the way neighbourhoods are created can affect both the physical activity and mental health of the communities’ residents.<ref name=renalds>{{cite journal|last=Renalds|first=A|author2=Smith, T|author3=Hale, P|title=A Systematic Review of Built Environment and Health|journal=Family and Community Health|year=2010|volume=33|issue=1|pages=68–78|doi=10.1097/fch.0b013e3181c4e2e5|pmid=20010006}}</ref> Studies have shown that built environments that were expressly designed to improve physical activity are linked to higher rates of physical activity, which in turn, positively affects health.<ref name=carlson>{{cite journal|last=Carlson|first=C|author2=Aytur, S|author3=Gardner, K|author4=Rogers, S|title=Complexity in Built Environment, Health, and Destination Walking: A Neighborhood-Scale Analysis|journal=J Urban Health|year=2012|volume=89|issue=2|pages=270–84|doi=10.1007/s11524-011-9652-8|pmid=22350512|pmc=3324613}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sallis|first=James F.|last2=Cerin|first2=Ester|last3=Kerr|first3=Jacqueline|last4=Adams|first4=Marc A.|last5=Sugiyama|first5=Takemi|last6=Christiansen|first6=Lars B.|last7=Schipperijn|first7=Jasper|last8=Davey|first8=Rachel|last9=Salvo|first9=Deborah|last10=Frank|first10=Lawrence D.|last11=De Bourdeaudhuij|first11=Ilse|date=2020-04-02|title=Built Environment, Physical Activity, and Obesity: Findings from the International Physical Activity and Environment Network (IPEN) Adult Study|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040218-043657|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|language=en|volume=41|issue=1|pages=119–139|doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-040218-043657|issn=0163-7525|doi-access=free}}</ref>

[[File:WTM3 Gnarly 0028.jpg|thumb|A separated bike lane in New York City.]]
Neighbourhoods with more [[walkability]] had lower rates of [[obesity]], as well as increased physical activity among its residents. They also had lower rates of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], higher [[social capital]], and less [[alcohol abuse]]. Walkability features in these neighbourhoods include safety, [[sidewalk]] construction, as well as destinations in which to walk.<ref name=renalds /> In addition, the perception of a walkable neighbourhood, one that is perceived to have good sidewalks and connectivity, is correlated with higher rates of physical activity.<ref name=carlson />

Assessments of walkability have been completed through the use of [[GIS]] programs, such as the Street Smart Walk Score. This example of a walkability assessment tool determines distances to grocery stores and other amenities, as well as connectivity and intersection frequency using specific addresses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walk Score Methodology|url=http://www2.walkscore.com/pdf/WalkScoreMethodology.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511085256/http://www2.walkscore.com/pdf/WalkScoreMethodology.pdf|archive-date=11 May 2012}}</ref> Assessments such as the Street Smart Walk Score can be utilized by city and country planning departments to improve existing walkability of communities.

To implement walkable neighbourhoods, community members and local leaders should focus on policy development. An effective framework that has been utilized in an abundance of communities is the Complete Streets concept of community planning that has been developed by the National Complete Streets Coalition (NCSC).<ref name="policy">{{cite web|title=Complete Streets local policy workbook, Smart Growth America| url=https://smartgrowthamerica.org/resources/complete-streets-local-policy-workbook}}</ref> NCSC states that the most successful policies are those that reflect input from a broad group of stakeholders, including transportation planners and engineers, elected officials, transit agencies, public health departments, and members of the community.<ref name="policy"/> According to Riggs, 2016, policies may focus on a “Complete Streets” investment, which includes sidewalk bulb-outs and refuges to reduce crossing distances or street widths for pedestrians. Other investments should include installing crosswalks, road markings, benches, shelters and sidewalk art installations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Riggs|first1=William|title=Inclusively walkable: exploring the equity of walkable housing in the San Francisco Bay Area|journal=Local Environment|volume=21|issue=5|pages=527–554|doi= 10.1080/13549839.2014.982080|year=2016|doi-access=free}}</ref> Every community will have a unique method of policy development depending on whether it is an urban, suburban, or rural community and how the policy will combine the variety of transportation modalities. Communities may choose to focus on walkability, but will also need to consider biking, wheeling/rolling, driving, and emergency vehicles. The NCSC policy workbook gives descriptive guidance on how to proceed with policy development whether they be council-driven, council-approved, directives, or citizen vote.<ref name="policy"/> When deciding how to proceed with walkability policy development, considerations should be made regarding current and past transportation policies, local community and government support, and how transportation policies have been implemented in the past.

Public health also addresses additional components of built environments including “[[bikeability]]”, which refers to the access that an area has granted to safe biking through multiple bike paths and [[bike lane]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Horacek|first=TM|author2=White AA|author3=Greene GW|title=Sneakers and spokes: an assessment of the walkability and bikeability of U.S. postsecondary institutions|journal=J Environ Health|year=2012|volume=74|issue=2|pages=8–15|display-authors=etal|pmid=21949979}}</ref> Both walkability and bikeability have been cited as determinants of physical activity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cochrane|first=T|author2=Davey, R|title=Increasing uptake of physical activity: A social ecological approach|journal=J R Soc Promot Health|year=2008|volume=128|issue=1|pages=31–40|pmid=18274328|doi=10.1177/1466424007085223}}</ref>

===Intersectionality===
The intersection of public health with other disciplines is evident in the design process of built environments which includes [[environmental planning]], [[policy development]] and [[land-use planning]].<ref name=roof /> Research suggests that people are more active in [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use communities]] or those that incorporate retail and residential and densely populated areas as well as those with good street connectivity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heath|first=G|author2=Brownson, R|author3=Kruger, J|s2cid=5971070|title=The effectiveness of urban design and land use and transport policies and practices to increase physical activity: a systematic review|journal= Journal of Physical Activity and Health|year=2006|volume=3|issue=s1|pages=S55–S76|display-authors=etal|pmid=28834525|doi=10.1123/jpah.3.s1.s55}}</ref> Those who preferred to walk and live in walkable environments often have lower obesity rates and drive less compared to those who preferred living in auto-dependent environments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Frank|first=L|author2=Saelens, B|author3=Powell, K|author4=Chapmen, J|title=Stepping towards causation: Do built environments or neighborhood and travel preferences explain physical activity, driving, and obesity?|journal=Social Science & Medicine|year=2007|volume=65|issue=9|pages=1898–1914|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.05.053 |pmid=17644231}}</ref>
