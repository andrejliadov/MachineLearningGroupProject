'''Alcohol tolerance''' refers to the bodily responses to the functional effects of [[ethanol]] in alcoholic beverages. This includes direct tolerance, speed of recovery from insobriety and resistance to the development of [[alcoholism]].

==Consumption-induced tolerance==
Alcohol tolerance is increased by regular drinking.<ref name=niaaa1/> This reduced sensitivity requires that higher quantities of alcohol be consumed in order to achieve the same [[drunkenness|effects]] as before tolerance was established. Alcohol tolerance may lead to (or be a sign of) alcohol dependency.<ref name=niaaa1>{{cite journal |date=April 1995 |title=Alcohol and Tolerance |journal=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), Alcohol Alert |issue=28 |url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa28.htm |accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref>

Heavy alcohol consumption over a period of years can lead to "reverse tolerance". A liver can be damaged by chronic alcohol use, leading to a buildup of fat and scar tissue.<ref>{{cite web | title = Alcohol-Induced Liver Disease | publisher = UC San Diego Health | url = https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/gastro/areas-expertise/liver-center/pages/alcohol-induced-liver-disease.aspx | accessdate = 4 October 2020}}</ref> The reduced ability of such a liver to [[metabolize]] or break down alcohol means that small amounts can lead to a high [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) and more rapid [[alcohol intoxication|intoxication]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Physiology of alcohol tolerance==
[[File:Ethanol_to_acetaldehyde.svg|thumb|250px|[[Alcohol dehydrogenase]] is a dimeric zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the reversible oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes]]

Direct alcohol tolerance is largely dependent on body size. Large-bodied people will require more alcohol to reach insobriety than lightly built people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Factors That Affect How Alcohol is Absorbed & Metabolized|url=https://alcohol.stanford.edu/alcohol-drug-info/buzz-buzz/factors-affect-how-alcohol-absorbed|website=Student affairs - Office of Alcohol Policy and Education|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=26 May 2018}}</ref> Thus men, being larger than women on average, will typically have a higher alcohol tolerance. The alcohol tolerance is also connected with activity of ''[[alcohol dehydrogenase]]s'' (a group of [[enzyme]]s responsible for the breakdown of alcohol) in the [[liver]], and in the bloodstream.

High level of alcohol dehydrogenase activity results in fast transformation of ethanol to more toxic [[acetaldehyde]]. Such atypical alcohol dehydrogenase levels are less frequent in alcoholics than in nonalcoholics.<ref name="Hurley TD 2012">{{cite journal | author = Hurley TD, Edenberg HJ | year = 2012 | title = Genes encoding enzymes involved in ethanol metabolism | journal = Alcohol Res. | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 339–344 | pmid = 23134050 | pmc = 3756590 }}</ref> Furthermore, among alcoholics, the carriers of this atypical enzyme consume lower ethanol doses, compared to the individuals without the [[allele]].

An estimated one out of twenty people have an [[alcohol flush reaction]]. It is not in any way an indicator for the drunkenness of an individual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diffordsguide.com/en/magazine/2013-09-10/5/the-asian-gene|title=Myth or reality?

Both of those conditions—faster conversion of alcohol to acetaldehyde and slower removal of acetaldehyde—reduce the risk for excessive drinking and alcohol dependence.<ref name="Hurley TD 2012"/>
