'''Decision aids''' are interventions or tools designed to facilitate [[shared decision making]] and [[patient participation]] in health care decisions.

Decision support interventions help people think about choices they face; they describe where and why choice exists; and they provide information about options, including, where reasonable, the option of taking no action.<ref name="Ref 1"/> These interventions aim to help people to deliberate, independently or in collaboration with others, about options by considering relevant attributes to help them forecast how they might feel about short, intermediate and long-term outcomes which have relevant consequences.<ref name="Ref 1"/> Decision aids can be of any type but are most commonly pamphlets, videos, or web-based tools.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=Dawn|last2=Légaré|first2=France|last3=Lewis|first3=Krystina|last4=Barry|first4=Michael J|last5=Bennett|first5=Carol L|last6=Eden|first6=Karen B|last7=Holmes-Rovner|first7=Margaret|last8=Llewellyn-Thomas|first8=Hilary|last9=Lyddiatt|first9=Anne|date=2017-04-12|editor-last=Cochrane Consumers and Communication Group|title=Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|pages=CD001431|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001431.pub5|pmid=28402085|pmc=6478132}}</ref> Decision aids support the process of constructing preferences and eventual decision making, appropriate to their individual situation.<ref name="Ref 1">{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Investing in deliberation: defining and developing decision support interventions for people facing difficult health decisions|url=https://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/who-is-involved-in-the-effective-health-care-program1/about-the-eisenberg-center/eisenberg-center-conference-series-2009/|series=White Paper Series|location=Gaithersberg, Maryland, USA|publisher=John M Eisenberg Center for Clinical Decisions and Communication|vauthors=Elwyn G, Frosch D, Volandes A, Edwards A, Montori V|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923023732/https://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/who-is-involved-in-the-effective-health-care-program1/about-the-eisenberg-center/eisenberg-center-conference-series-2009/|archive-date=2016-09-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Usage==
There are numerous ways in which decision aids can be used.<ref name="Ref 1"/> They can be brief enough to be used during a clinical encounter or they can have sufficient content to be used  before or after clinical encounters. Although decision aids have been available since the early 1980s, evidence suggests that they are not well integrated into routine practice.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gravel K, Légaré F, Graham ID |title=Barriers and facilitators to implementing shared decision-making in clinical practice: a systematic review of health professionals' perceptions |journal=Implement Sci |volume=1 |pages=16 |year=2006 |pmid=16899124 |pmc=1586024 |doi=10.1186/1748-5908-1-16 }}</ref>

==Efficacy==
Decision aids provide people with a greater understanding of their medical treatment options and empower people to participate in their own health decision making.<ref name=Stacey2017>{{Cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=Dawn|last2=Légaré|first2=France|last3=Lewis|first3=Krystina|last4=Barry|first4=Michael J.|last5=Bennett|first5=Carol L.|last6=Eden|first6=Karen B.|last7=Holmes-Rovner|first7=Margaret|last8=Llewellyn-Thomas|first8=Hilary|last9=Lyddiatt|first9=Anne|date=2017|title=Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|pages=CD001431|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001431.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28402085|pmc=6478132}}</ref> Supplementing patient-education consultations with decision tools improves people's knowledge about the risks and benefits of a procedure or medication and may help them make decisions that are in line with their personal values.<ref name="Stacey2017" />

No adverse effects have been identified.<ref name="Stacey2017" />

It is not clear what type of decision aid for patients is cost-effective.<ref name="Stacey2017" /> It is also not clear what impact the use of clinical decision aid systems that assist people who face healthcare treatments or screening decisions may have on the overall healthcare system.<ref name="Stacey2017" /> It is not known if decision aids are helpful for people who are not strong readers.<ref name="Stacey2017" />

There are also many active research groups in the field, including the [http://www.ohri.ca/DecisionAid/ University of Ottawa], [https://web.archive.org/web/20091023032445/http://tdi.dartmouth.edu/centers/informed-choice Dartmouth College], [http://www.decisionlaboratory.com/ Cardiff University] and Hamburg; the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] uses the IPDAS standards<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ipdas.ohri.ca/index.html|title=International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration|website=ipdas.ohri.ca|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref> to produce its decision aids.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/tools-and-resources/patient-decision-aids/|title=Patient Decision Aids {{!}} AHRQ Effective Health Care Program|website=www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov|access-date=2016-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918093218/http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/tools-and-resources/patient-decision-aids/|archive-date=2016-09-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Standards==
There has been an increase in use of decision support and a global interest in developing these interventions among both for-profit and not-for-profit organisations.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Connor AM, Wennberg JE, Legare F |title=Toward the 'tipping point': decision aids and informed patient choice |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=716–25 |year=2007 |pmid=17485749 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.26.3.716 |url=https://repository.uchastings.edu/faculty_scholarship/1102 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> It is therefore essential to have internationally accepted standards to assess the quality of their development, process, content, potential bias and method of testing and evaluation. The International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration has published a checklist,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Elwyn G, O'Connor A, Stacey D |title=Developing a quality criteria framework for patient decision aids: online international Delphi consensus process |journal=BMJ |volume=333 |issue=7565 |pages=417–0 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16908462 |pmc=1553508 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38926.629329.AE |display-authors=etal}}</ref> and, more recently, an assessment instrument (IPDAS)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Elwyn G, O'Connor AM, Bennett C |title=Assessing the quality of decision support technologies using the International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument (IPDASi) |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=e4705 |year=2009 |pmid=19259269 |pmc=2649534 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004705 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> to evaluate the quality of decision support interventions. In its November 2013 issue, ''BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making'' published a supplement that described the 10-year evolution of the IPDAS Collaboration and 12 core dimensions for assessing the quality of patient decision aids.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-13-supplement-2|title=BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making|website=BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref> While specifying minimum standards for patient decision support interventions is a feasible development, it is unclear whether the minimum standards can be applied to interventions designed for use within clinical encounters and to those that target screening and diagnostic tests.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Joseph-Williams|first1=Natalie|last2=Newcombe|first2=Robert|last3=Politi|first3=Mary|last4=Durand|first4=Marie-Anne|last5=Sivell|first5=Stephanie|last6=Stacey|first6=Dawn|last7=O'Connor|first7=Annette|last8=Volk|first8=Robert J.|last9=Edwards|first9=Adrian|date=2014-08-01|title=Toward Minimum Standards for Certifying Patient Decision Aids: A Modified Delphi Consensus Process|journal=Medical Decision Making|volume=34|issue=6|pages=699–710|doi=10.1177/0272989X13501721|issn=1552-681X|pmid=23963501|s2cid=3815932}}</ref>
