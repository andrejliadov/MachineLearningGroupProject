'''Baumol's cost disease''' (or the '''Baumol effect''') is the rise of salaries in jobs that have experienced no or low increase of labor productivity, in response to rising salaries in other jobs that have experienced higher [[labor productivity]] growth. The phenomenon was described by [[William J. Baumol]] and [[William G. Bowen]] in the 1960s <ref name="performing">{{cite book|title=Performing Arts, The Economic Dilemma: a study of problems common to theater, opera, music, and dance|last=Baumol|first=William J.|author2=Bowen|first2=William G.|publisher=M.I.T. Press|year=1966|isbn=0262520117|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=}}</ref> and is an example of [[cross elasticity of demand]].

The rise of wages in jobs without productivity gains derives from the requirement to compete for employees with jobs that have experienced gains and so can naturally pay higher salaries, just as classical economics predicts. For instance, if the retail sector pays its managers 19th-century-style salaries, the managers may decide to quit to get a job at an automobile factory, where salaries are higher because of high labor productivity. Thus, managers' salaries are increased not by labor productivity increases in the retail sector but by productivity and corresponding wage increases in other industries.

==Description==
The original study was conducted for the [[performing arts]] sector.<ref name="performing" /> Baumol and Bowen pointed out that the same number of musicians is needed to play a [[Beethoven]] [[string quartet]] today as was needed in the 19th century; the productivity of [[European classical music|classical music]] performance has not increased. On the other hand, the real wages of musicians (as in all other professions) have increased greatly since the 19th century.

Baumol's cost disease is often used to describe consequences of the lack of growth in productivity in the [[quaternary sector of the economy]] and [[public service]]s, such as public hospitals and state colleges. Labor-intensive sectors that rely heavily on non-routine human interaction or activities, such as [[health care]], [[education]], or the performing arts, have had less growth in productivity over time. As with the string quartet example, it takes nurses the same amount of time to change a bandage or college professors the same amount of time to mark an [[essay]] today as it did in 1966, as those types of activities rely on the movements of the human body, which cannot yet be engineered to perform more quickly, accurately, or efficiently in the same way that a machine, such as a computer, have. In contrast, goods-producing industries, such as the car manufacturing sector and other activities that involve routine tasks, workers are continually becoming more productive by technological innovations to their tools and equipment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/helland-tabarrok_why-are-the-prices-so-damn-high_v1.pdf|last1=Helland |first1=Eric |last2=Tabarrok |first2=Alex |title=Why Are the Prices So Damn High?|accessdate=May 26, 2019|date=May 2019}}</ref>

==Early references==

The concept was alluded to as early as 1776 by [[Adam Smith]] in [[The Wealth of Nations]]:<ref>{{Cite web|title=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, by Adam Smith|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-h/3300-h.htm#chap10|access-date=2020-08-29|website=www.gutenberg.org}}</ref>
<blockquote>
Let us suppose, for example, that in the greater part of employments the productive powers of labour had been improved to tenfold, or that a day’s labour could produce ten times the quantity of work which it had done originally; but that in a particular employment they had been improved only to double, or that a day’s labour could produce only twice the quantity of work which it had done before. In exchanging the produce of a day’s labour in the greater part of employments for that of a day’s labour in this particular one, ten times the original quantity of work in them would purchase only twice the original quantity in it. Any particular quantity in it, therefore, a pound weight, for example, would appear to be five times dearer than before. In reality, however, it would be twice as cheap.

==Effects, symptoms, and remediation==

Employers may react to cost increases in any number of ways including:{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

* Decrease quantity/supply
* Decrease quality
* Decrease profit margins, dividends, or investment
* Increase price
* Increase non-monetary compensation or employ volunteers
* Increase [[total factor productivity]]

In the case of education, the Baumol effect has been used as at least partial justification for the fact that, in recent decades, the prices of education and health care have risen faster than the general rate of inflation.<ref name=surowiecki>{{cite magazine

The total factor productivity treatment is not available to the performing arts sector, as the consumable good is the labor itself. Instead, it has been observed that increases in price of the performing arts has been offset by increases in standard of living and entertainment spending by consumers.<ref name=Heilbrun>{{cite web
