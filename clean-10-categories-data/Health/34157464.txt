==Religion and spirituality==
[[Spirituality]] has been ascribed many different definitions in different contexts, but a general definition is: an individual's search for meaning and purpose in life. Spirituality is distinct from [[organized religion]] in that spirituality does not necessarily need a religious framework. That is, one does not necessarily need to follow certain rules, guidelines or practices to be spiritual, but an organized religion often has some combination of these in place. Some people who suffer from severe mental disorders may find comfort in religion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pargament|first=Kenneth|date=February 2013|title=Understanding and addressing religion among people with mental illness|journal=World Psychiatry|volume=12 | issue = 1 |pages=26–32|doi=10.1002/wps.20005|pmid=23471791|pmc=3619169}}</ref> People who report themselves to be spiritual people may not observe any specific religious practices or traditions.<ref name="Nelson, C.J. 2002 pp. 213">Nelson, C.J., Rosenfeld, B., Breitbart, W., Galietta, M.

==Dimensions of health==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) discerns four dimensions of health, namely physical, social, mental, and spiritual health.

===Physical health===

====Positive effects====
According to Ellison & Levin (1998), some studies indicate that religiosity appears to positively correlate with physical health.<ref>{{cite journal

These studies have been carried out among all ages,genders and religions. These are based on the experience of religion is positive in itself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seybold,K.S & Hill,P.C|date=February 2001|title=The Role Of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=10 | issue = 1 |pages=21–24|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00106|jstor=20182684}}</ref>

One possibility is that religion provides physical health benefits indirectly. Church attendees present with lower rates of alcohol consumption and improvement in mood, which is associated with better physical health.<ref>{{cite journal

Similar studies have been done investigating religious emotions and health. Although religious emotions, such as humility, forgiveness, and gratitude confer health benefits, it is unclear if religious people cultivate and experience those emotions more frequently than non-religious peoples.<ref>{{Cite journal

====Church attendance====
In many studies, attendance at religious services has been found to be associated with lower levels of multiple risk factors for ill health and mortality and with lower prevalence and incidence of illness and mortality. For example, a recent report of a follow-up study of over five thousand Americans found those attending more than weekly had half the mortality of those never attending after adjusting for multiple variables.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bruce |first1=Marino A. |last2=Martins |first2=David |last3=Duru |first3=Kenrik |last4=Beech |first4=Bettina M. |last5=Sims |first5=Mario |last6=Harawa |first6=Nina |last7=Vargas |first7=Roberto |last8=Kermah |first8=Dulcie |last9=Nicholas |first9=Susanne B. |last10=Brown |first10=Arleen |last11=Norris |first11=Keith C. |last12=Abe |first12=Takeru |title=Church attendance, allostatic load and mortality in middle aged adults |journal=PLOS ONE |date=16 May 2017 |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=e0177618 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0177618|pmid=28520779 |pmc=5433740 |doi-access=free }}</ref>  This can be expressed as an increase [[life expectancy]] (Hummer et al. 1999) with a life expectancy at age 20 of 83 years for frequent attendees and 75 years for non-attendees.  A causal association between a risk factor and an outcome can only be proven by a randomized controlled experiment, obviously infeasible in this case. Hence, observational findings of an association of religious attendance with lower mortality are compatible with a causal relationship but cannot prove one. Church goers may differ from others in ways not measured that could explain their better health.

====Death rates====
Kark et. (1996) included almost 4,000 Israelis, over 16 years (beginning in 1970), death rates were compared between the experimental group (people belonging to 11 religious [[kibbutz]]im) versus the control group (people belonging to secular kibbutzim). Some determining factors for the groups included the date the kibbutz was created, geography of the different groups, and the similarity in age. It was determined that “belonging to a religious collective was associated with a strong protective effect".<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kark JD, Shemi G, Friedlander Y, Martin O, Manor O, Blondheim SH |title=Does religious observance promote health? mortality in secular vs religious kibbutzim in Israel |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=341–6 |date=March 1996  |pmid=8604758 |pmc=1380514 |doi=10.2105/ajph.86.3.341}}</ref> Not only do religious people tend to exhibit healthier lifestyles, they also have a strong support system that secular people would not normally have. A religious community can provide support especially through a stressful life event such as the death of a loved one or illness. There is the belief that a higher power will provide healing and strength through the rough times which also can explain the lower mortality rate of religious people vs. secular people.

The existence of ‘religious struggle’ in elderly patients was predictive of greater risk of mortality in a study by Pargament et al. (2001). Results indicate that patients, with a previously sound religious life, experienced a 19% to 28% greater mortality due to the belief that God was supposedly punishing them or abandoning them.

====Infections====
A number of religious practices have been reported to cause [[infections]]. These happened during an ultra-orthodox Jewish [[circumcision]]s practice known as [[Brit milah#Metzitzah B.27Peh|metzitzah b'peh]], the ritual 'side roll' in [[Hinduism]],<ref group="note">The ‘side roll’ is a ritual performed during a Hindu festival in which large numbers of male devotees lie prostrate on the ground and roll sideways around the temple premises in fulfilment of vows taken at the temple. Because the men’s upper bodies are usually bare during this ritual, their skin comes into contact with the parasitic larvae that infest the soil or sand on the ground, resulting in the [[Cutaneous larva migrans]] (CLM) skin disease.</ref> the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Communion rite|communion]] [[chalice]], during the Islamic [[Hajj]] and after the Muslim ritual [[Ablution in Islam|ablution]].<ref name="Pellerin">{{Cite journal

====Prayer====
{{Main|Studies on intercessory prayer}}

Some religions claim that praying for somebody who is sick can have positive effects on the health of the person being prayed for. [[meta-study|Meta-studies]] of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is "no discernible effect" while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had "small, but significant, effect sizes" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.<ref name=Masters >{{cite journal | last1 = Masters | first1 = K. | last2 = Spielmans | first2 = G. | last3 = Goodson | first3 = J. | date = Aug 2006 | title = Are there demonstrable effects of distant intercessory prayer?

Randomized controlled trials of intercessory prayer have not yielded significant effects on health. These trials have compared personal, focused, committed and organized intercessory prayer with those interceding holding some belief that they are praying to God or a god versus any other intervention. A Cochrane collaboration review of these trials concluded that 1) results were equivocal, 2) evidence does not support a recommendation either in favor or against the use of intercessory prayer and 3) any resources available for future trials should be used to investigate other questions in health research.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Roberts L, Ahmed I, Hall S, Davison A |title=Intercessory prayer for the alleviation of ill health |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=2 |pages=CD000368 |year=2009 |pmid=19370557 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000368.pub3|pmc=7034220 }}</ref>
In a case-control study done following 5,286 Californians over a 28-year period in which variables were controlled for (i.e. age, race/ethnicity, gender, education level), participants who went to church on a frequent basis (defined as attending a religious service once a week or more) were 36% less likely to die during that period.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Strawbridge WJ, Cohen RD, Shema SJ, Kaplan GA |title=Frequent attendance at religious services and mortality over 28 years |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=957–61 |date=June 1997  |pmid=9224176 |pmc=1380930 |doi=10.2105/ajph.87.6.957}}</ref> However, this can be partly be attributed to a better lifestyle since religious people tend to drink and smoke less and eat a healthier diet.

===Mental health===
Evidence suggests that religiosity can be a pathway to both mental health and mental disorder. For example, [[religiosity]] is positively associated with mental disorders that involve an excessive amount of self-control and negatively associated with mental disorders that involve a lack of self-control.<ref>{{cite journal

Studies have shown a negative relationship between spiritual well-being and depressive symptoms. In one study, those who were assessed to have a higher spiritual [[quality of life]] on a spiritual well-being scale had less [[Depression symptoms|depressive symptoms]].<ref>Fehring, R.J., Miller, J.F., Shaw, C. (1997). Spiritual well-being, religiosity, hope, depression, and other mood states in elderly people coping with cancer 24. Oncology Nursing Forum. pp. 663–671.</ref> Cancer and AIDS patients who were more spiritual had lower depressive symptoms than religious patients. Spirituality shows beneficial effects possibly because it speaks to one's ability to intrinsically find meaning in life, strength, and inner peace, which is especially important for very ill patients.<ref name="Nelson, C.J. 2002 pp. 213"/>

Exline et al. 1999  showed that the difficulty in forgiving God and alienation from God were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Among those who currently believed in God, forgiving God for a specific, unfortunate incident predicted lower levels of anxious and depressed mood.

====Schizophrenia and psychosis====
{{Main|Religion and schizophrenia}}
Studies have reported beneficial effects of spirituality on the lives of patients with schizophrenia, [[major depression]], and other psychotic disorders. Schizophrenic patients were less likely to be re-hospitalized if families encouraged [[religious]] practice, and in depressed patients who underwent religiously based interventions, their symptoms improved faster than those who underwent [[secular]] interventions. Furthermore, a few cross-sectional studies have shown that more religiously involved people had less instance of [[psychosis]].<ref>Koenig, H. G. (2008) Research on religion, spirituality, and mental health: A review. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.</ref>

====Life satisfaction====
Research shows that religiosity moderates the relationship between “thinking about meaning of life” and life satisfaction. For individuals scoring low and moderately on religiosity, thinking about the meaning of life is negatively correlated with life satisfaction. For people scoring highly on religiosity, however, this relationship is positive.<ref name=":0" /> Religiosity has also been found to moderate the relationship between negative affect and life satisfaction, such that life satisfaction is less strongly influenced by the frequency of negative emotions in more religious (vs less religious) individuals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Joshanloo|first=Mohsen|date=2016-04-01|title=Religiosity moderates the relationship between negative affect and life satisfaction: A study in 29 European countries|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=61|pages=11–14|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2016.01.001}}</ref>

====Coping with trauma====
{{Main|Religion and coping with trauma}}

One of the most common ways that people cope with trauma is through the comfort found in religious or spiritual practices.<ref>Pargament, K. I. (1997). The psychology of religion and coping: Theory, research, practice. New York: Guilford Press.</ref> Psychologists of religion have performed multiple studies to measure the positive and negative effects of this coping style.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Trevino | first1 = K. M. | last2 = Pargament | first2 = K. I. | year = 2007 | title = Religious coping with terrorism and natural disaster | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/281f1d081f13404574ba80b5432d067e4b89cdb3| journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 100 | issue = 9| pages = 946–947 | doi=10.1097/smj.0b013e3181454660| pmid = 17902314 }}</ref> Leading researchers have split religious coping into two categories: positive religious coping and negative religious coping. Individuals who use positive religious coping are likely to seek spiritual support and look for meaning in a traumatic situation. Negative religious coping (or [[spiritual struggle]]s) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith.

The effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a [[defence mechanism]] as it was viewed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=D|title=The mediating role of coping in the relationships between religiousness and mental health (2014)|publisher=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy}}</ref>

===Spiritual health===
'''Spiritual Health''' is one of four dimensions to well-being as defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which include physical, social, and mental.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The preamble to Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO)  adopted by the International Health Conference held in New York from 19 June to 22 July 1946 and signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States<ref>Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2002, 80 (12)</ref> defined health as a state of "physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"<ref>Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York, 19–22 June 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948.</ref> and it has not been amended.

However, but many [https://healthysmartlifetips.com/2020/08/08/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-soulful-or-spiritual/ spiritual folks experience] moments of joy.  But However, in 1983 twenty-two WHO member countries from the Eastern Mediterranean Region proposed a draft resolution to this preamble to include reference to spiritual health, such that it would redefine health as a state of "physical, mental, spiritual and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity".<ref>Review of the Constitution of the World Health Organization: Report of the Executive Board Special Group. 101st Session. Agenda Item 7.3. 22 January 1998. Geneva: World Health Organization.</ref>

Whilst WHO did not amend the preamble to its constitution, resolution WHA31.13 passed by the Thirty-seventh World Health Assembly, in 1984<ref>Thirty-seventh World Health Assembly, Resolution WHA37.13. Geneva: World Health Organization; 1984. WHO document WHA37/1984/REC/1:6.</ref> called upon Member States to consider including in their [[Health For All]] strategies a spiritual dimension as defined in that resolution in accordance with their own social and cultural patterns
<ref>The fourth ten years of the World Health Organization: 1978–1987. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2011.</ref> recognizing  that "the  spiritual dimension  plays  a great  role in motivating people's achievements in all aspects of life".<ref>Draft Regional Health-for-all Policy and Strategy for the Twenty-First Century. World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean. Forty-fifth Session, Agenda item 15.</ref>

The complete description of the spiritual dimension as articulated by the Health Assembly is as follows:
<blockquote>The spiritual dimension is understood to imply a phenomenon that is not material in nature, but belongs to the realm of ideas, beliefs, values and ethics that have arisen in  the minds and conscience of human beings, particularly ennobling ideas. Ennobling ideas have given rise to health ideals, which have led to a practical strategy for Health for All that aims at attaining a goal that has both a material and non-material component. If the material component of the strategy can be provided to people, the non-material or spiritual one is something that has to arise within people and communities in keeping with their social and cultural patterns. The spiritual dimension plays a great role in motivating people’s achievement in all aspects of life.<ref>World Health Organization Publication: Year 1991. Issue 9290211407. Chapter 4: The Spiritual Dimension.</ref></blockquote>

Since the inclusion of spiritual health within WHO's purview, a number of other significant organizations have also attended to spirituality and incorporated reference to it in key documents, including the [[United Nations]] action plan [[Agenda 21]]<ref>Sitarz, Dan. "Agenda 21: The earth summit strategy to save our planet." (1993).</ref> which recognizes the right of individuals to "healthy physical, mental, and spiritual development".<ref>Agenda 21. Chapter 6.23. United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Rio de Janeiro, 1992.</ref>
