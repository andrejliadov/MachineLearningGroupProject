{{COVID-19 pandemic sidebar|expanded=issues}}
The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] has had a substantial impact on the [[video game industry]]. The video game industry has been impacted by the outbreak in various ways, most often due to concerns over travel to and from China or elsewhere or related to slowdowns in the manufacturing processes within China.

==Overview==
In contrast to [[economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|many other economic sectors that are drastically affected by the pandemic]], the video game industry has been far more resilient to the pandemic. Most video game developers, publishers and operators have been able to maintain operations with employees [[telecommuting|working from home remotely]] to sustain game development and digital releases, though as [[stay-at-home order|movement control orders]] persisted, some productivity issues have arose.<ref name="nytimes april sales">{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/technology/personaltech/coronavirus-video-game-production.html | title = Gaming Sales Are Up, but Production Is Down | first = Jason | last = Schreier | author-link = Jason Schreier | date = April 21, 2020 | accessdate = April 22, 2020 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> Further, with many people globally at home and unable to work, [[online game|online gaming]] has seen record numbers of players during the pandemic as a popular activity to counter [[social distancing|physical distancing for society]], a practice recommended by the [[World Health Organization]]<ref name="who video games"/> which helped boost revenues for many companies in the gaming industry.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ew.com/gaming/coronavirus-videogames-industry-impact/ |title = Game (still) on: How coronavirus is impacting the gaming industry | first = Nick | last=  Romero | date = March 19, 2020 | access-date = March 27, 2020 | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-world-turning-to-video-games-150704969.html | title=  The world is turning to video games amid coronavirus outbreak | first= Daniel | last = Howley | date = March 18, 2020 | accessdate = March 27, 2020 | work = [[Yahoo!]] }}</ref>

There have still been negative impacts on the industry, notably with major trade events like the [[E3 2020]] cancelled or postponed which may have impacted relationships between the smaller developers and publishers. This has particularly impacted [[indie developers]] who typically use these events for face-to-face meetings with potential partners to gain funding and publishing support, and caused them to have to delay or cancel projects.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-08-what-does-a-year-without-events-mean-for-indies | title = What does a year without events mean for indies? | first = Ryland H. | last = Garnett | date = April 8, 2020 | accessdate = April 10, 2020 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref> Further, many esport leagues had to alter plans for their games, transitioning from live events to remote play or cancellation altogether. Portions of the sector that relied on physical products, such as retail stores and peripheral makers, as well as those dependent on in-person activities such as [[quality assurance]] through playtesting, ratings evaluation, and marketing, also struggled with global [[stay-at-home order]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-09-the-games-industry-must-protect-its-vulnerable-businesses | title = The games industry must protect its vulnerable businesses | first=  Christopher | last = Dring | date = April 9, 2020 | accessdate = April 9, 2020 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>

The origin of the pandemic in China is also expected to impact the supply chains for electronics for the year which may limit hardware availability once the pandemic begins to slow down. This however did not impact plans for [[Microsoft]] and [[Sony]] to release their next-generation consoles, the [[Xbox Series X]] and [[PlayStation 5]] in Fall 2020.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-51907663 | title = Animal Crossing, Warzone and the coronavirus impact | first=  Steffan | last=  Powell |date = March 18, 2020 | accessdate = March 27, 2020 | work = [[BBC]] }}</ref>

== Cancelled or affected industry events ==
Many trade events and expositions for the industry have been cancelled or postponed due to bans against public gathers during the pandemic. Of note, the largest trade event [[E3 2020]] was ultimately cancelled by March 2020 by the [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA) after several weeks of doubt.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/e3-2020-coronavirus-actively-assessing-1203524365/ | title = E3 Organizers 'Actively Assessing' Coronavirus Outbreak, Still Planning to Hold June Event in L.A. | first = Todd | last = Spangler | date = March 4, 2020 | access-date = March 4, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> However, on March 11, 2020, the ESA affirmed that they cancelled the physical E3 show amid the fears of the outbreak as they are looking to arrange for virtual presentations from its exhibitors.<ref name="e3 2020 cancelled">{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/e3-2020-canceled-coronavirus-1203529992/ | title = E3 2020 Canceled After 'Overwhelming Concerns' About Coronavirus | first = Todd | last= Spangler | date = March 11, 2020 | access-date = March 11, 2020 |work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> However, by April 2020, the ESA determined that the logistics of arranging a virtual event was too difficult due to disruptions from the pandemic, fully cancelling the show in 2020, but with plans in place to return in 2021. The ESA offered the E3 website to help partners to support product announcements in lieu of the E3 show.<ref name="pcgamer e32020 fully cancalled">{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/e3-2021-dates-announced-but-theres-still-no-word-about-the-2020-online-experience/ | title = E3 2021 dates revealed, but the 2020 'online experience' isn't going to happen | first = Andy | last = Chalk | date= April 7, 2020 | accessdate = April 7, 2020 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref> Additional events have been arranged in lieu of E3, with [[Geoff Keighley]] having arranged a four-month Summer Game Fest with several game developers, publishers, and other industry leaders to provide announcements and game demos from May to August 2020 as a replacement for the E3 and other cancelled events.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/summer-game-fest-2020-schedule-1234595351/ | title = Summer Game Fest 2020 Steps in to Fill E3 Void for Video-Game Biz | first= Todd | last=  Spangler | date= May 1, 2020 | accessdate = May 1, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>

Most esports events are based on online games, but are typically played in local arenas to reduce network latency between players as well as to provide an audience. The pandemic caused many of these events to either become cancelled or switch to a fully online format for the year:

* [[ESL Pro League]] Season 11, a ''[[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]]'' tournament was originally going to be an offline event with the finals taking place at [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], [[United States]].

* Coupled with lowered hardware production, the Nintendo Switch also became a high-selling commodity during the pandemic, as it provided entertainment options across all ages, particularly with the release of ''[[Animal Crossing: New Horizons]]''. Nintendo worked to supply as many units as possible globally to most markets, but this led to some resellers developing means through [[Internet bot|bots]] to identify when Switch units were back in stock at various storefronts, purchasing as many units as possible at list price and then reselling these at a higher markup.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bvgqp3/nintendo-switch-check-out-bots-shortage | title = Resellers Using Checkout Bots Are Driving the Nintendo Switch Shortage | first = Joseph | last= Cox |date = April 17, 2020 | accessdate = April 18, 2020 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref> High sales of the Switch helped to offset low sales of other console hardware within the United States and buoy higher revenues for the sector.<ref name="bloomberg q1-2020"/>

''[[Animal Crossing: New Horizons]]'' saw particular and explosive popularity, with people around the world turning to the game's recreation of ordinary daily life activities, and social networking features, as a substitute for the normalcy disrupted by the pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why games like Animal Crossing are the new social media of the coronavirus era|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/16/999944/coronavirus-animal-crossing-video-games-social-media/|access-date=2020-11-04|website=MIT Technology Review|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Lin|title=The psychology behind video games during COVID-19 pandemic: A case study of Animal Crossing: New Horizons|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbe2.221|journal=Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies|language=en|volume=n/a|issue=n/a|doi=10.1002/hbe2.221|issn=2578-1863}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Gamers seeking social oasis turn ‘Animal Crossing’ into global hit|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13430524|access-date=2020-11-04|website=The Asahi Shimbun|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-26|title=CoD and Animal Crossing among best video games for socialising|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/gaming/video-games-virtual-travel-social-interaction-a4448791.html|access-date=2020-11-04|website=Evening Standard|language=en}}</ref> ''[[Fall Guys]]'' and ''[[Among Us]]'' were particularly popular during this time, with the former being released during the pandemic and the latter receiving a surge of popularity after being released in 2018.<ref name="improb">{{Cite web|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|date=2020-09-08|title=Among Us' Improbable Rise To The Top Of Twitch|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/09/among-us-improbable-rise-to-the-top-of-twitch/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200909025025/https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/09/among-us-improbable-rise-to-the-top-of-twitch/|archive-date=September 9, 2020|access-date=2020-09-08|website=Kotaku Australia|language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Grimm|first=Peter|date=2020-09-07|title=Among Us Hits Impressive Concurrent Player Milestone|url=https://gamerant.com/among-us-concurrent-player-milestone/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200909025047/https://gamerant.com/among-us-concurrent-player-milestone/|archive-date=September 9, 2020|access-date=2020-09-08|website=Game Rant|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Baird|first=Scott|date=2020-09-07|title=Fall Guys Is Number One On Steam's Bestselling List For Fifth Week In A Row|url=https://www.thegamer.com/fall-guys-number-one-steam-sales/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200909025047/https://www.thegamer.com/fall-guys-number-one-steam-sales/|archive-date=September 9, 2020|access-date=2020-09-08|website=TheGamer|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Matthews|first=Emma|date=2020-08-25|title=Why Among Us is the best game to watch on Twitch right now|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/why-among-us-is-the-best-game-to-watch-on-twitch-right-now/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200909025025/https://www.pcgamer.com/why-among-us-is-the-best-game-to-watch-on-twitch-right-now/|archive-date=September 9, 2020|access-date=2020-09-08|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US}}</ref> Some non-online games were also thematically compared to the pandemic, such as ''[[The Longing (video game)|The Longing]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Weber|first=Rachel|date=2020-04-03|title=The Longing is the indie game that sums up self-solation perfectly|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-longing-is-the-indie-game-that-sums-up-self-solation-perfectly/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200406034220/https://www.gamesradar.com/the-longing-is-the-indie-game-that-sums-up-self-solation-perfectly/|archive-date=April 6, 2020|access-date=2020-05-01|website=GamesRadar|language=en}}</ref>

{{short description|Impact of COVID-19}}
{{COVID-19 pandemic sidebar|expanded=issues}}
The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] has had a substantial impact on the [[video game industry]]. The video game industry has been impacted by the outbreak in various ways, most often due to concerns over travel to and from China or elsewhere or related to slowdowns in the manufacturing processes within China.

==Overview==
In contrast to [[economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic|many other economic sectors that are drastically affected by the pandemic]], the video game industry has been far more resilient to the pandemic. Most video game developers, publishers and operators have been able to maintain operations with employees [[telecommuting|working from home remotely]] to sustain game development and digital releases, though as [[stay-at-home order|movement control orders]] persisted, some productivity issues have arose.<ref name="nytimes april sales">{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/technology/personaltech/coronavirus-video-game-production.html | title = Gaming Sales Are Up, but Production Is Down | first = Jason | last = Schreier | author-link = Jason Schreier | date = April 21, 2020 | accessdate = April 22, 2020 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> Further, with many people globally at home and unable to work, [[online game|online gaming]] has seen record numbers of players during the pandemic as a popular activity to counter [[social distancing|physical distancing for society]], a practice recommended by the [[World Health Organization]]<ref name="who video games"/> which helped boost revenues for many companies in the gaming industry.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ew.com/gaming/coronavirus-videogames-industry-impact/ |title = Game (still) on: How coronavirus is impacting the gaming industry | first = Nick | last=  Romero | date = March 19, 2020 | access-date = March 27, 2020 | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-world-turning-to-video-games-150704969.html | title=  The world is turning to video games amid coronavirus outbreak | first= Daniel | last = Howley | date = March 18, 2020 | accessdate = March 27, 2020 | work = [[Yahoo!]] }}</ref>

There have still been negative impacts on the industry, notably with major trade events like the [[E3 2020]] cancelled or postponed which may have impacted relationships between the smaller developers and publishers. This has particularly impacted [[indie developers]] who typically use these events for face-to-face meetings with potential partners to gain funding and publishing support, and caused them to have to delay or cancel projects.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-08-what-does-a-year-without-events-mean-for-indies | title = What does a year without events mean for indies? | first = Ryland H. | last = Garnett | date = April 8, 2020 | accessdate = April 10, 2020 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref> Further, many esport leagues had to alter plans for their games, transitioning from live events to remote play or cancellation altogether. Portions of the sector that relied on physical products, such as retail stores and peripheral makers, as well as those dependent on in-person activities such as [[quality assurance]] through playtesting, ratings evaluation, and marketing, also struggled with global [[stay-at-home order]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-09-the-games-industry-must-protect-its-vulnerable-businesses | title = The games industry must protect its vulnerable businesses | first=  Christopher | last = Dring | date = April 9, 2020 | accessdate = April 9, 2020 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref>

The origin of the pandemic in China is also expected to impact the supply chains for electronics for the year which may limit hardware availability once the pandemic begins to slow down. This however did not impact plans for [[Microsoft]] and [[Sony]] to release their next-generation consoles, the [[Xbox Series X]] and [[PlayStation 5]] in Fall 2020.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-51907663 | title = Animal Crossing, Warzone and the coronavirus impact | first=  Steffan | last=  Powell |date = March 18, 2020 | accessdate = March 27, 2020 | work = [[BBC]] }}</ref>

== Cancelled or affected industry events ==
Many trade events and expositions for the industry have been cancelled or postponed due to bans against public gathers during the pandemic. Of note, the largest trade event [[E3 2020]] was ultimately cancelled by March 2020 by the [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA) after several weeks of doubt.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/e3-2020-coronavirus-actively-assessing-1203524365/ | title = E3 Organizers 'Actively Assessing' Coronavirus Outbreak, Still Planning to Hold June Event in L.A. | first = Todd | last = Spangler | date = March 4, 2020 | access-date = March 4, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> However, on March 11, 2020, the ESA affirmed that they cancelled the physical E3 show amid the fears of the outbreak as they are looking to arrange for virtual presentations from its exhibitors.<ref name="e3 2020 cancelled">{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/e3-2020-canceled-coronavirus-1203529992/ | title = E3 2020 Canceled After 'Overwhelming Concerns' About Coronavirus | first = Todd | last= Spangler | date = March 11, 2020 | access-date = March 11, 2020 |work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref> However, by April 2020, the ESA determined that the logistics of arranging a virtual event was too difficult due to disruptions from the pandemic, fully cancelling the show in 2020, but with plans in place to return in 2021. The ESA offered the E3 website to help partners to support product announcements in lieu of the E3 show.<ref name="pcgamer e32020 fully cancalled">{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/e3-2021-dates-announced-but-theres-still-no-word-about-the-2020-online-experience/ | title = E3 2021 dates revealed, but the 2020 'online experience' isn't going to happen | first = Andy | last = Chalk | date= April 7, 2020 | accessdate = April 7, 2020 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref> Additional events have been arranged in lieu of E3, with [[Geoff Keighley]] having arranged a four-month Summer Game Fest with several game developers, publishers, and other industry leaders to provide announcements and game demos from May to August 2020 as a replacement for the E3 and other cancelled events.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/summer-game-fest-2020-schedule-1234595351/ | title = Summer Game Fest 2020 Steps in to Fill E3 Void for Video-Game Biz | first= Todd | last=  Spangler | date= May 1, 2020 | accessdate = May 1, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>

* Similarly, several companies pulled out from the [[Game Developers Conference]] in San Francisco in March 2020, forcing the organizers to postpone the show until later in 2020.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/gdc-running-out-of-time-to-cancel-as-amazon-blizzard-join-no-show-list/ | title = GDC running out of time to cancel as Amazon, Blizzard join no-show list | first =Kate | last = Cox | date = February 28, 2020 | access-date = February 28, 2020 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/28/gdc-postponed-as-multiple-participants-pull-out-over-coronavirus-fears/ | title = GDC 'postponed' as multiple participants pull out over coronavirus fears | first = Jeff | last = Grubb | date = February 28, 2020 | access-date = February 28, 2020 | work = [[Venture Beat]] }}</ref> However, the event organizers devised a scheme to run the GDC as a virtual conference following a similar schedule across the same set of days by using the streaming services with a subset of the planned events that are presented through the streaming media and was made available online a week later.  This included the [[Game Developers Choice Awards]] and [[Independent Games Festival]] presentations.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/359319/Game_Developers_Conference_2020_announces_virtual_awards_and_talk_schedule.php | title = Game Developers Conference 2020 announces virtual awards and talk schedule | date = March 10, 2020 |accessdate =March 10, 2020 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref>

* The physical 2020 [[Gamescom]] event, to be held in [[Cologne, Germany]], was forced to cancel as Germany banned public events through August 2020 following the lifting of the initial lockdown, but organizers will move some portions of the event to be solely online. Also, the physical 2020 [[Gamescom]] Asia, to be held in [[Singapore]], was postponed to 2021.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-04-15-gamescom-hit-by-german-ban-on-events | title = Gamescom hit by German ban on events | first = Brendan | last=  Sinclair | date = April 15, 2020 | accessdate = April 15, 2020 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-05-18-gamescom-2020-interview | title = Gamescom: "We can seize the opportunity to prove how digital events can work" | first=  Matthew | last= Handrahan | date = May 18, 2020 | accessdate = May 18, 2020 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/lifestyle/bots/2020/06/599470/tech-gamescom-asia-postponed-2021-amid-covid-19|title=#TECH: Gamescom asia postponed to 2021 amid Covid-19|last=team|first=BOTS|date=June 10, 2020|accessdate=June 10, 2020}}</ref>

* Coupled with lowered hardware production, the Nintendo Switch also became a high-selling commodity during the pandemic, as it provided entertainment options across all ages, particularly with the release of ''[[Animal Crossing: New Horizons]]''. Nintendo worked to supply as many units as possible globally to most markets, but this led to some resellers developing means through [[Internet bot|bots]] to identify when Switch units were back in stock at various storefronts, purchasing as many units as possible at list price and then reselling these at a higher markup.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bvgqp3/nintendo-switch-check-out-bots-shortage | title = Resellers Using Checkout Bots Are Driving the Nintendo Switch Shortage | first = Joseph | last= Cox |date = April 17, 2020 | accessdate = April 18, 2020 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref> High sales of the Switch helped to offset low sales of other console hardware within the United States and buoy higher revenues for the sector.<ref name="bloomberg q1-2020"/>
