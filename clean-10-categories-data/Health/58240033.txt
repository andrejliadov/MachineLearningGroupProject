{{About|the mental health of Jesus|a worldwide view of Jesus|Jesus|and|Historical Jesus}}
The question of whether the [[historical Jesus]] was in good [[mental health]] has been explored by multiple psychologists, philosophers, historians, and writers. The first to openly question [[Jesus]]' sanity was French [[psychologist]] [[Charles Binet-Sanglé]], the chief physician of [[Paris]] and author of the book ''La Folie de Jésus''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Binet-Sanglé |first=Charles |title=La folie de Jésus |trans-title=The Madness of Jesus |publisher=A.

==Opinions challenging the sanity of Jesus==
The topic of the assessment of the psyche of Jesus first occurs in the gospels. The [[Gospel of Mark]] reports the opinion of members of Jesus' family who believe that Jesus "is beside himself". Some [[psychiatrist]]s, [[Religious studies|religious scholars]] and writers explain that Jesus' family, followers ({{bibleref2|John|7:20}}) and contemporaries seriously regarded him as [[Delusion|delusional]], [[Demonic possession|possessed by demons]], or insane.<ref name="SN"/><ref name="JNCN">{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=Evan D. |last2=Cunningham |first2=Miles G. |last3=Price |first3=Bruce H. |title=The Role of Psychotic Disorders in Religious History Considered |journal=[[Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences]] |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |date=October 2012 |pages=410–426 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214 |issn=1545-7222 |oclc=823065628 |pmid=23224447 |s2cid=207654711 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/14d7b462fa0d4041fb1e2685b62f9c60c09a5078}}</ref><ref name="Meggitt">{{Cite journal |last=Meggitt |first=Justin J. |title=The Madness of King Jesus: Why was Jesus Put to Death, but his Followers not? |journal=[[Journal for the Study of the New Testament]] |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=379–413 |date=June 1, 2007 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |place=London |issn=0142-064X |doi=10.1177/0142064X07078990 |s2cid=171007891 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Hirsch |first=William |title=Religion and Civilization: The Conclusions of a Psychiatrist |publisher=The Truth Seeker Company |location=New York |date=1912 |page=[https://archive.org/details/religionandcivi00hirsgoog/page/n143 135] |lccn=12002696 |oclc=39864035 |ol=OL20516240M |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/religionandcivi00hirsgoog |quote=That the other members of his own family considered him insane, is said quite plainly, for the openly declare, "He is beside himself."}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kasmar |first=Gene |title=All the obscenities in the Bible |publisher=Kas-mark Pub.

[[Jean Meslier]] (1664–1729) thought similarly.

<blockquote>In short, the nature of the hallucinations of Jesus, as they are described in the orthodox Gospels, permits us to conclude that the founder of Christian religion was afflicted with religious paranoia. (vol. 2, p. 393)</blockquote>

His view was shared by the New York psychiatrist William Hirsch who, in 1912, published his study ''Religion and Civilization: The Conclusions of a Psychiatrist'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Hirsch |first=William |title=Religion and civilization; the conclusions of a psychiatrist |publisher=The Truth Seeker Company |location=New York |date=1912 |lccn=12002696 |oclc=39864035 |ol=OL20516240M |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/religionandcivi00hirsgoog }}</ref> enumerating a number of Jesus' mentally aberrant behaviours. Hirsch agreed with Binet-Sanglé in that Jesus had been afflicted with hallucinations, and pointed to his "[[megalomania]], which mounted ceaselessly and immeasurably".<ref name="SN" /> Hirsch concluded that Jesus was "paranoid" – pure and simple, adding that:

<blockquote>But Christ offers in every respect an absolutely typical picture of a wellknown mental disease. All that we know of him corresponds so exactly to the clinical aspect of paranoia, that it is hardly conceivable how anybody at all acquainted with mental disorders, can entertain the slightest doubt as to the 
correctness of the diagnosis. (p. 103)</blockquote>

This was reflected in the novel by [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'', in which Jesus is depicted (articulated by [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]) as a harmless madman. It was only at the turn of the 1920s and 1930s that in the [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's propaganda]] won the [[Christ myth theory|mythological option]], namely the denial of the existence of Jesus.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Дождикова |first=Надежда |title=Чем был недоволен Берлиоз?

Storr agrees with most scholars of historical Jesus who are inclined to the hypothesis of [[Historical Jesus#Apocalyptic prophet|Jesus as apocalyptic prophet]].

<blockquote>It seems inescapable that Jesus did share the apocalyptic view that God's final conquest of evil was at hand and that God's kingdom would be established upon earth in the near future.<ref>{{cite book |last=Storr |first=Anthony |title=Feet of Clay; Saints, Sinners, and Madmen: A Study of Gurus |publisher=Free Press Paperbacks |location=New York |year=1997 |page=142 |isbn=0-684-83495-2}}</ref></blockquote>

Storr recognizes Jesus' many similarities to other gurus. It is, for example, going through a [[Temptation of Christ|period of internal conflict]] during his fasting in the desert. According to him, if Jesus really considered himself a deputy for [[God]] and believed that one day he would come down from heaven to rule, he was very similar to the gurus whom he had previously described as preachers of delusions possessed by mania of greatness. He notes that Jesus was not ideal in family life ({{bibleref2|Mark|3:31–35}}, {{bibleref2|Mark|13:12–13}}). Gurus often remain indifferent to family ties. Other similarities, according to Storr, include Jesus' faith in receiving a special [[revelation]] from God and a tendency to [[elitism]], in the sense that Jesus believed that he had been specially marked by God.<ref>{{cite book |last=Storr |first=Anthony |title=Feet of Clay; Saints, Sinners, and Madmen: A Study of Gurus |publisher=Free Press Paperbacks |location=New York |year=1997 |pages=143–146 |isbn=0-684-83495-2}}</ref>

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] wrote in his book ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (book)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'':

<blockquote>A broad current of liberal scholarship has interpreted Jesus′ Baptism as a vocational experience. After having led a perfectly normal life in the province of Galilee, at the moment of his Baptism he is said to have had an earth-shattering experience. It was then, we are told, that he became aware of his special relationship to God and his religious mission. This mission, moreover, supposedly originated from the expectation motif then dominant in Israel, creatively reshaped by John, and from the emotional upheaval that the event of his Baptism brought about in Jesus′ life. But none of this can be found in the texts. However much scholarly erudition goes into the presentation of this reading, it has to be seen as more akin to a ″Jesus novel″ than as an actual interpretation of the texts. The texts give us no window into Jesus′ inner life – Jesus stands above our psychologizing (Guardini, ''Das Wesen des Christentums'').<ref>{{Cite book |author=Pope Benedict XVI |translator-last1=Walker |translator-first1=Adrian J. |title=Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |year=2007 |pages=23–24|isbn=978-0-3855-2434-6}}</ref></blockquote>
[[C.S Lewis]] famously considered Jesus' mental health in what is known as [[Lewis's trilemma]]:
<blockquote>Christ either deceived mankind by conscious fraud, or He was Himself deluded and self-deceived, or He was Divine. There is no getting out of this trilemma. It is inexorable.</blockquote>

The [[Agnostic atheism|agnostic atheist]] New Testament scholar [[Bart Ehrman]] wrote on his own blog:

<blockquote>And he may well have thought (I think he did think) that he would be made the messiah in the future kingdom. That may have been a rather exalted view of himself, but I don’t think it makes Jesus crazy.  It makes him an unusually confident apocalyptic prophet.  There were others with visions of grandeur at the time.  I don’t think that makes him mentally ill.  It makes him a first-century apocalyptic Jew.<ref>{{cite web | first=Bart D.| last=Ehrman |url=https://ehrmanblog.org/were-jesus-followers-crazy-was-he-mailbag-june-4-2016/ |title=Were Jesus' Followers Crazy?
