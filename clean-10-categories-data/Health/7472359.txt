'''Chronic care''' refers to [[health care|medical care]] which addresses pre-existing or long-term illness, as opposed to [[acute care]] which is concerned with short term or severe illness of brief duration. [[Chronic (medicine)|Chronic medical conditions]] include [[asthma]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[emphysema]], chronic [[bronchitis]], congestive heart disease, [[cirrhosis of the liver]], [[hypertension]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Without effective treatment chronic conditions may lead to [[disability]].

The incidence of chronic disease has increased as [[mortality rate]]s have decreased.<ref name="chroncity"/>  It is estimated that by 2030 half of the population of the USA will have one or more chronic conditions.<ref name="mtcfoc"/>

According to the CDC, 6 out of 10 adults in the U.S. are managing at least one chronic disease and 42% of adults have two or more chronic conditions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chronic Diseases in America |url=https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/infographic/chronic-diseases.htm |website=CDC |publisher=CDC |accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref>

Conditions, injuries and diseases which were previously fatal can now be treated with chronic care. Chronic care aims to maintain wellness by keeping [[symptom]]s in [[remission (medicine)|remission]] while balancing treatment regimes and [[quality of life]].<ref name="chroncity"/>  Many of the core functions of [[primary health care]] are central to chronic care.<ref name="mtcoci">{{cite book |title=Meeting the Challenge of Chronic Illness |last=Kane |first=Robert L. |author2=Reinhard Priester |author3=Annette M.

==Policy making==
According to 2008 figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chronic medical care accounts for more than 75% of health care spending in the US.<ref name="chroncity">{{cite book |chapter=Chronicity |title=Chronic Illness: Impact and Intervention |last=Larsen |first=Pamala D. |editor1-last=Lubkin |editor1-first=Ilene Morof |editor2-last=Larsen |editor2-first=Pamala D. |year=2011 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers |isbn=0763799661 |pages=3–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NMCb5PeHXbcC |accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref>  In response to the increased government expenditure in dealing with chronic care policy makers are searching for effective interventions and strategies.  These strategies can broadly be described within four categories.  These are [[Preventive healthcare|disease prevention]] and early detection, new providers, settings and qualifications, [[Disease management (health)|disease management programs]] and [[Clinical pathway|integrated care models]].<ref name="tackcdie">{{cite book |title=Tackling Chronic Disease in Europe: Strategies, Interventions and Challenges |last=Busse |first=Reinhard |author2=Miriam Blümel |author3=David Scheller-Kreinsen |author4=Annette Zentner  |year=2010 |publisher=WHO Regional Office Europe |isbn=9289041927 |page=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WfyyrC7Q_j4C |accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref>

==Challenges==
One of the major problems from a health care system which is poorly coordinated for sufferers of chronic conditions is the incidence of patients receiving conflicting advice from different providers.<ref name="mtcfoc"/> Patients will often be given prescriptions for medication that adversely interact with
one another.  One recent study estimated that more than 20% of older patients in the USA took at least one medication which could negatively impact another condition.<ref name="ptc">{{cite web |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0089447#pone.0089447-Anderson1 |title=Potential Therapeutic Competition in Community-Living Older Adults in the U.S.: Use of Medications That May Adversely Affect a Coexisting Condition |date=February 25, 2014 |work=PLOS ONE |publisher=Public Library of Science |accessdate=14 March 2014 }}</ref> This is referred to as therapeutic competition.

Effective chronic care requires an information platform to track patients' status and ensure appropriate treatments are given.<ref name="kpiiltc">{{cite book |title=Key Policy Issues in Long-term Care |last=Brodsky |first=Jenny |author2=Jack Habib |author3=Miriam Hirschfeld  |year=2003 |publisher=World Health Organisation |isbn=9241562250 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J8DXL147v_MC |accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref>

There is a recognised gap between treatment guidelines and current practice for chronic care.<ref name="cfpwc">{{cite book |title=Caring For People With Chronic Conditions: A Health System Perspective: A Health System Perspective |last=Nolte |first=Ellen |author2=Martin McKee |year=2008 |publisher=McGraw-Hill International |isbn=0335233708 |pages=2, 4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RV3id1wQIcsC |accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref>  Individualised treatment plans are critical in treating chronic conditions because patients will place varying important on health outcomes.  For example, some patients will fore-go complex, inconvenient medication regimes at the expense of quality of life.<ref name="cfpwc"/>

===Multiple conditions===
One of the greatest challenges in this field of health care is dealing with the co-existence of multiple disorders,<ref name="mcc"/> which is called multi-morbidity.  There are few incentives within current [[health system|health care systems]] to coordinate care across multiple providers and varying services.<ref name="mtcfoc">{{cite web |url=http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/farm/reports/reports/2010/rwjf54583 |title=Chronic Care: Making the Case for Ongoing Care |date=2010 |author=Gerard Anderson |publisher=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation |accessdate=14 March 2014 }}</ref>  A 2001 survey by [[Mathematica Policy Research]] found that physicians feel they have inadequate training to deal with multiple chronic conditions.  An increase in the number of chronic conditions correlates with an increase in the number of inappropriate hospitalizations.<ref name="mtcfoc"/>  Self-management can be challenging because recommended activities for one condition may be made difficult because of another condition.<ref name="cfpwc"/>

A nurse has to be qualified to handle all the needs of a chronic client and has to be an advocate to put the case of the chronically ill across to the health administration, hospital board or their families.

A variety of specialists such as surgeons, dietitians, nutritionists, and occupational therapists have to be in attendance for the maximum benefit of the client. Someone suffering from chronic pain for a long time may need the help of a psychiatrist. Everyday activities that the physically fit see as normal may be a Herculean feat for the chronically ill and they need all the support that they can get. The nurse may be privy to some of these help that the chronically ill can benefit from. They need to be proactive and put these patients in contact with these help but also sensitive enough to give their client the freedom to decline any help if they think that they do not need it.

Chronic pain might also get the person to start questioning their faith and/or wanting to have a deeper spiritual experience because of their pain and suffering.

The patient also needs to take time to participate in some fun activities. They may need to check out of the facility/hospital or get out of the house occasionally preventing an association of hospitals with pain. This further helps the patients keep their sanity and keeps them psychologically sound.

They may need a nurse who is qualified in palliative care. Some may be dying and they need respect and dignity as they die in pain. They also need a nurse who is non-judgmental and one who is also compassionate and caring. The family has to be involved to help the client better manage the pain. One very important quality is co-ordinating the best care for the client and some amount of diplomacy and empathy.

In some cases, such as with [[diabetes]] or [[sleep apnea]], the treatment is long term and difficult for patients to understand and comply with. In these cases [[chronic care management]] is highly recommended to help the patient learn about the consequences of refusing treatment and how to best follow treatment.
