'''Sex education''' is the instruction of issues relating to [[human sexuality]], including emotional relations and responsibilities, [[human sexual anatomy]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], [[sexual reproduction]], [[age of consent]], [[reproductive health]], [[reproductive rights]], [[safe sex]], [[birth control]] and [[sexual abstinence]]. Sex education that covers all of these aspects is known as [[comprehensive sex education]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Stanger-Hall|first1=Kathrin F.|last2=Hall|first2=David W.|date=2011-10-14|editor-last=Vitzthum|editor-first=Virginia J.|title=Abstinence-Only Education and Teen Pregnancy Rates: Why We Need Comprehensive Sex Education in the U.S|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=6|issue=10|pages=e24658|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0024658|pmid=22022362|pmc=3194801|bibcode=2011PLoSO...624658S|issn=1932-6203}}</ref>  Common avenues for sex education are parents or caregivers, formal school programs, and public health campaigns.

Traditionally, [[adolescent]]s in many cultures were not given any information on sexual matters, with the discussion of these issues being considered [[taboo]]. Such instruction, as was given, was traditionally left to a child's parents, and often this was put off until just before a child's marriage. The [[progressive education]] movement of the late 19th century, however, led to the introduction of "[[social hygiene]]" in North American school curricula and the advent of school-based sex education.<ref name=Tupper>{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Sex, Drugs and the Honour Roll: The Perennial Challenges of Addressing Moral Purity Issues in Schools|journal=Critical Public Health|year=2013|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115–131|doi=10.1080/09581596.2013.862517|s2cid=143931197}}</ref> Despite early inroads of school-based sex education, most of the information on sexual matters in the mid-20th century was obtained informally from friends and the media, and much of this information was deficient or of dubious value, especially during the period following [[puberty]], when curiosity about sexual matters was the most acute. This deficiency was heightened by the increasing incidence of [[teenage pregnancies]], particularly in Western countries after the 1960s. As part of each country's efforts to reduce such pregnancies, programs of sex education were introduced, initially over strong opposition from parent and religious groups. 

The outbreak of [[AIDS]] has given a new sense of urgency to sex education. In many [[Africa]]n countries, where AIDS is at epidemic levels (see [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]]), sex education is seen by most scientists as a vital [[public health]] strategy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Namibia National Policy on HIV/AIDS for the Education Sector|url=http://www.youth-policy.com//Policies/NBANatl_Pol_HIV_AIDS_Education_Sector.pdf|publisher=USAID Health Policy Initiative|access-date=November 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108060907/http://www.youth-policy.com//Policies/NBANatl_Pol_HIV_AIDS_Education_Sector.pdf|archive-date=November 8, 2013|year=2003|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Some international organizations such as [[Planned Parenthood]] consider that broad sex education programs have global benefits, such as controlling the risk of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the advancement of [[women's rights]] (see also reproductive rights). The use of mass media campaigns has sometimes resulted in high levels of "awareness" coupled with essentially superficial knowledge of HIV transmission.<ref name=newapproach>{{cite news |title=A New Approach to Global HIV/AIDS Education|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-piya-sorcar/a-new-approach-to-global-_b_790420.html|author=Piya Sorcar|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=December 1, 2010 |access-date=December 16, 2010 |author-link=Piya Sorcar}}</ref>

==Definitions==
John J. Burt defined sex education as the study of the characteristics of beings: a male and female.<ref>{{cite book |title=Education for Sexuality: Concepts and Programs for Teaching |authors=John J. Burt, Linda Brower Meeks |date=1970 |publisher=W. B. Saunders Co.}}</ref> Such characteristics make up the person's sexuality. Sexuality is an important aspect of the life of a human being and almost all people, including children, want to know about it. Sex education includes all the educational measures which - regardless of the particular method used - may center on sex. He further said that sex education stands for protection, presentation extension, improvement and development of the family based on accepted ethical ideas.<ref name=DeLaMare>Referred in [http://www.educationalleaders.govt.nz/Leadership-development/Professional-information/Principals-sabbatical-reports/Report-archives-for-2007-2011/Primary-award-recipients-2011/De-La-Mare-Jeanette paper by Jeanette De La Mare. October 2011].</ref>

Leepson sees sex education as instruction in various physiological, psychological and sociological aspects of sexual response and reproduction.<ref name=DeLaMare /> Kearney (2008) also defined sex education as "involving a comprehensive course of action by the school, calculated to bring about the socially desirable attitudes, practices and personal conduct on the part of children and adults, that will best protect the individual as a human and the family as a social institution." Thus, sex education may also be described as "sexuality education", which means that it encompasses education about all aspects of sexuality, including information about [[family planning]], [[reproduction]] ([[Human fertilization|fertilization]], [[Conception (biology)|conception]] and development of the [[embryo]] and [[fetus]], through to childbirth), plus information about all aspects of one's sexuality including: [[body image]], [[sexual orientation]], [[sexual pleasure]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], decision making, communication, [[dating]], [[Intimate relationship|relationships]], [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs) and how to avoid them, and [[birth control]] methods.<ref name=DeLaMare /> Various aspects of sex education are considered appropriate in school depending on the age of the students or what the children can comprehend at a particular point in time. Rubin and Kindendall expressed that sex education is not merely the topics of reproduction and teaching how babies are conceived and born. Instead, it has a far richer scope and goal of helping children incorporate sex more meaningfully into their present and future life and to provide them with some basic understanding of virtually every aspect of sex by the time they reach full maturity.<ref>Rubin and Kindendall (2001)</ref>

==Evidence==
Evidence shows that a combination of comprehensive sex education and access to birth control appears to decrease the rates of unintended pregnancies among teenagers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Oringanje|first1=Chioma|last2=Meremikwu|first2=Martin M.|last3=Eko|first3=Hokehe|last4=Esu|first4=Ekpereonne|last5=Meremikwu|first5=Anne|last6=Ehiri|first6=John E.|date=2016-02-03|title=Interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies among adolescents|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=2|pages=CD005215|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005215.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26839116}}</ref> A meta-analysis that compared comprehensive sex education programs with abstinence-only programs found that abstinence-only programs did not reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, but rather may have increased it.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=DiCenso|first1=A|last2=Guyatt|first2=G|last3=Willan|first3=A|last4=Griffith|first4=L|title=Interventions to reduce unintended pregnancies among adolescents: systematic review of randomized controlled trials.|journal=BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)|date=Jun 15, 2002|volume=324|issue=7351|pages=1426|pmid=12065267|pmc=115855|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7351.1426}}</ref> Numerous studies show that curricula providing accurate information about condoms and contraception can lead to reductions in the [[risky sexual behavior|risky behaviors]] reported by young people as well as reductions in unintended pregnancies and STIs.<ref name="unfpa.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/comprehensive-sexuality-education|title=Comprehensive sexuality education - UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund|access-date=March 13, 2017}}</ref> Programs that teach only abstinence have not been shown to be effective.<ref name="unfpa.org" />

According to UNFPA, "A 2010 review found that 'gender-focused' curricula – meaning curricula that integrate gender equality into the learning material – were substantially more effective in reducing risky behaviors than programmes that did not consider gender."<ref name="unfpa.org" /> Research has also shown that delay in sexual initiation, use of condoms and practice contraception has been a result of young people adopting egalitarian attitudes about gender roles. These individuals were also found to be less likely engaged in violent relationships and have a lower rate of STIs including HIV and unintended pregnancy.<ref name="unfpa.org" />

By emphasizing rights and gender issues, these programs help reduce gender-based violence and bullying, promote safe schools, empower young people to advocate for their own rights, and advance gender equality.<ref name="unfpa.org" />

"Few sexual health interventions are designed with input from adolescents. Adolescents have suggested that sex education should be more positive with less emphasis on [[anatomy]] and scare tactics; it should focus on negotiation skills in sexual relationships and [[communication]]; and details of sexual health clinics should be advertised in areas that adolescents frequent (for example, school toilets, shopping centres)."<ref name=" DiCenso">{{cite journal |last1=DiCenso |first1=A.|year=2002 |title=Interventions to Reduce Unintended Pregnancies Among Adolescents: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/324/7351/1426|journal=British Medical Journal |volume=324 |issue=7351|page=1426 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7351.1426 |pmid=12065267 |pmc=115855|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Further, the report showed "Comprehensive programs worked for both genders, for all major ethnic groups, for sexually inexperienced and experienced teens, in different settings, and in different communities."<ref name="Kirby2007" />

[[The United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) recommends comprehensive sexuality education, as it enables young people to make informed decisions about their sexuality. According to UNFPA,<ref name="Guide">{{cite web|title=UNFPA Operational Guidance for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: A Focus on Human Rights and Gender|url=http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/UNFPA_OperationalGuidance_WEB3.pdf|publisher=[[United Nations Population Fund|UNFPA]]}}</ref>

"It is taught over several years, introducing age-appropriate information consistent with the evolving capacities of young people. It includes scientifically accurate, curriculum-based information about human development, anatomy and pregnancy. It also includes information about contraception and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. And it goes beyond information, to encourage confidence and improved communication skills. Curricula should also address the social issues surrounding sexuality and reproduction, including cultural norms, family life and interpersonal relationships."

Human rights issues, gender equality and gender roles should be integrated into every aspect of these discussions. This includes human rights protection, fulfilment and empowerment; the impact of gender discrimination; the importance of equality and gender-sensitivity; and the ideas underlying gender roles. Sexual abuse, gender-based violence and harmful practices should also be discussed. Taken together, all this information teaches young people the life skills necessary to assume responsibility for their own behavior and to respect the rights of others."<ref name="unfpa.org" />

[[Comprehensive sex education|Comprehensive sexuality education]] "enables young people to make informed decisions about their sexuality and health. These programmes build life skills and increase responsible behaviors, and because they are based on human rights principles, they help advance human rights, gender equality and the empowerment of young people."<ref name="unfpa.org" />

Sex education may be taught informally, such as when someone receives information from a conversation with a parent, friend, religious leader, or through the [[Mass media|media]].<ref>Philliber, SG and ML Tatum.

Training can also be provided through multimedia resources. Adolescents spend a lot of their time on social media, or watching television. Those same adolescents may also have a hard time talking to their families about sexual matters. A study has shown that mass media interventions; for example, use of teaching sexual education through commercials shown on television, or ads on social media, have proven effective and decreased the amount of unprotected sex.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sznitman|first=Susan|date=September 2011|title=Using Culturally Sensitive Media Messages to Reduce HIV-Associated Sexual Behavior in High-Risk African American Adolescents: Results From a Randomized Trial|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=49|issue=3|pages=244–251|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.12.007|pmid=21856515|pmc=3159865}}</ref> Formal sex education occurs when [[school]]s or health care providers offer sex education. Slyer stated that sex education teaches the young person what he or she should know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others.<ref>Slyer (2000)</ref> Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.<ref>Gruenberg (2000)</ref>

Sometimes formal sex education is taught as a full course as part of the [[curriculum]] in [[junior high school]] or high school. Other times it is only one unit within a more broad [[biology]], [[health]], [[home economics]], or [[physical education]] class. Some schools offer no sex education, since it remains a [[controversy|controversial]] issue in several countries, particularly the United States (especially with regard to the age at which children should start receiving such education, the amount of detail that is revealed, including [[LGBT sex education]],<ref name="NYT"/> and topics dealing with [[human sexual behavior]], e.g. [[safe sex]] practices, [[masturbation]], [[premarital sex]], and [[sexual ethics]]).

Wilhelm Reich commented that sex education of his time was a work of deception, focusing on biology while concealing [[sexual arousal|excitement-arousal]], which is what a [[pubescent]] individual is mostly interested in. Reich added that this emphasis obscures what he believed to be a basic psychological principle: that all worries and difficulties originate from unsatisfied sexual impulses.<ref>Reich (2006) ''[[Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf]]''. Part one "the failure.." 6. The puberty problem - (3°) "A reflection.." - c. sexual relationships of pubescents - paragraph 4.a (pp. 198-99 of Italian edition)</ref> Leepson asserted that the majority of people favor some sort of sex instruction in public schools, and this has become an intensely controversial issue because, unlike most subjects, sex education is concerned with an especially sensitive and highly personal part of human life. He suggested that sex education should be taught in the classroom.<ref name=DeLaMare />
The problem of pregnancy in adolescents is delicate and difficult to assess using sex education.<ref>Deschamps, 1999</ref> But Calderone{{Who|date=June 2011}} believed otherwise, stating that the answer to adolescents' sexual woes and pregnancy can not lie primarily in school programmes which at best can only be remedial; what is needed is prevention education and as such parents should be involved.

When sex education is contentiously debated, the chief controversial points are whether covering [[child sexuality]] is valuable or detrimental; whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into the curriculum;<ref name="NYT"/>  the use of [[birth control]] such as [[condom]]s and [[hormonal contraception]]; and the impact of such use on pregnancy outside marriage, [[teenage pregnancy]], and the transmission of STIs. Increasing support for [[abstinence-only sex education]] by conservative groups has been one of the primary causes of this controversy. Countries with conservative attitudes towards sex education (including the UK and the U.S.) have a higher incidence of STIs and teenage pregnancy.<ref name="Joy of sex education">[http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/comment/story/0,,1214047,00.html "Joy of sex education" by George Monbiot], ''The Guardian'', May 11, 2004</ref>

==Public opinion==
A survey conducted in Britain, Canada and the United States by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] in November 2011 asked adult respondents to look back to the time when they were teenagers, and describe how useful several sources were in enabling them to learn more about sex. By far, the largest proportion of respondents in the three countries (74% in Canada, 67% in Britain and 63% in the United States) said that conversations with friends were "very useful" or "moderately useful." The next reputable source was the media (television, books, movies, magazines), mentioned by three-in-five British (65%) and Canadians (62%) and more than half of Americans (54%) as useful.

While half of Canadians (54%) and Americans (52%) found their sex education courses at school to be useful, only 43% of British share the same view. And while more than half of Americans (57%) say conversations with family were useful, only 49% of Canadians and 35 percent of British said so.<ref name=opinion>{{cite news|title=Americans, Britons and Canadians Disagree on Sex Education|url=http://angusreidglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011.11.30_SexEd.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018215345/http://angusreidglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2011.11.30_SexEd.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 18, 2016|author=Mario Canseco|work=[[Angus Reid Public Opinion]]|date=November 30, 2011|access-date=November 30, 2011}}</ref>

Sex education in Africa has focused on stemming the growing [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS epidemic]]. Most governments in the region have established AIDS education programs in partnership with the [[World Health Organization]] and international [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s. These programs were undercut significantly by the [[Global Gag Rule]], an initiative put in place by President [[Ronald Reagan]], suspended by President [[Bill Clinton]], and re-instated by President [[George W.

The state of sex education programs in Asia is at various stages of development, like in the country Philippines where the topic sex education is considered to be very controversial because it deals with different topics which are sometimes too vague and too broad to be implemented largely in the society.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Gary|last2=Kippax|first2=Susan|last3=Aggleton|first3=Peter|last4=Tyrer|first4=Paul|date=April 2003|title=HIV/AIDS School-based Education in Selected Asia-Pacific Countries|journal=Sex Education|volume=3|issue=1|pages=3–21|doi=10.1080/1468181032000052126|s2cid=145274846|issn=1468-1811}}</ref>

====Thailand====
In [[Thailand]] there has been progress on sex education, with the boundaries being pushed forward with each revision of the curriculum. The first national policy on sexuality education in schools was announced in 1938, but sex education was not taught in schools until 1978. It was then called "Life and Family Studies", and its content consisted of issues related to the reproductive system and personal hygiene. The education curriculum has been revised several times, involving efforts from both government and non-government sectors, and sex education has been accepted as a problem solving tool for adolescent sexual reproduction and health issues. This has been a consequence of educational reform following the National Education Act B.E. 2542, increasing awareness of problems related to adolescents’ sexual practices, and the emergence of women's sexuality and queer movements. Another new approach in sexuality education curricula in Thailand has been the Teenpath Project developed by [[PATH (global health organization)|PATH]], Thailand. PATH has also succeeded in institutionalizing sexuality education curricula in schools since 2003.

The Singapore Family Planning Association has developed a series of sex education programs for young people, focusing on strict control of sexual behavior and age. The Singapore government attaches great importance to the moral education of young people, and the sentencing of sexual offenses is very strict .<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Liew|first=Warren Mark|date=2014-09-03|title=Sex (education) in the city: Singapore's sexuality education curriculum|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01596306.2014.931114|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|language=en|volume=35|issue=5|pages=705–717|doi=10.1080/01596306.2014.931114|s2cid=143451046|issn=0159-6306}}</ref>

====France====
In [[France]], sex education has been part of school curricula since 1973. Schools are expected to provide 30 to 40 hours of sex education, and pass out condoms, to students in grades 8 and 9 (aged 15–16). In January 2000, the French government launched an information campaign on contraception with TV and radio spots and the distribution of five million leaflets on contraception to high school students.<ref name=" britsexed">[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend.htm Britain: Sex Education Under Fire] ''UNESCO Courier'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222184211/http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/apprend.htm |date=December 22, 2009 }}</ref>
In September 2013, the government launched a new program called "les ABCD de l’égalité" (the ABCD of equality) whose main aim is to "fight gender stereotypes at school". The ultimate goal is to foster mutual respect between boys and girls early on so that it impacts their conception of the world later on.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vincent Peillon |url=http://www.gouvernement.fr/gouvernement/les-abcd-de-l-egalite-un-outil-pour-lutter-des-l-ecole-contre-les-inegalites-filles-gar |title=Les ABCD de l'égalité : un outil pour lutter dès l'école contre les inégalités filles-garçons &#124; Portail du Gouvernement |publisher=Gouvernement.fr |date=January 13, 2014 |access-date=August 5, 2014}}</ref>

In [[Germany]], sex education has been part of school curricula since 1970. Since 1992 sex education is a governmental duty by law.<ref>[http://bildungsklick.de/pm/35091/sexualaufklaerung-in-europa/ Sexualaufklärung in Europa] (German)</ref>

It normally covers all subjects concerning the process of growing up, bodily changes during puberty, emotions involved, the biological process of reproduction, sexual activity, partnership, homosexuality, unwanted pregnancies and the complications of abortion, the dangers of [[sexual violence]], [[child abuse]], and sex-transmitted diseases. It is comprehensive enough that it sometimes also includes things in its curricula such as sex positions. Most schools offer courses on the correct usage of contraception.<ref>[http://www.zeit.de/2003/03/Schmutzige_Gedanken Sexualkunde-Schmutzige Gedanken] (German)</ref>

A sex survey by the [[World Health Organization]] concerning the habits of European teenagers in 2006 revealed that German teenagers care about contraception. The birth rate among 15- to 19-year-olds was very low—only 11.7 per 1000 people, compared to 27.8 births per 1,000 people in the UK, and 39.0 births per 1,000 people in Bulgaria (which, incidentally, has the highest birth rate in Europe).<ref name="EUROPEAN SEX SURVEY">{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,454492,00.html |title=European Sex Survey |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=December 14, 2006 |access-date=August 5, 2014}}</ref>

====Poland====
From a Western point of view, sex education in Poland has never actually developed. At the time of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], since 1973, it was one of the school subjects; however, it was relatively poor and did not achieve any actual success. After 1989, it practically vanished from the school life—it is currently a subject called "Family Life Education" (''wychowanie do życia w rodzinie'') rather than "Sex Education" (''edukacja seksualna'')—and schools explicitly require parental consent for their children to attend sex ed classes. This policy is largely due to the strong objection against sex education raised by the [[Catholic Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racjonalista.pl/kk.php/s,6168 |title=Edukacja seksualna w polityce władz centralnych po transformacji ustrojowej |publisher=Racjonalista.pl |date=October 31, 2008 |access-date=August 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>[https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/gender-sexuality-english-language-education-focus-poland Pakuła Ł, Pawelczyk J., Sunderland, J. 2015 Gender and Sexuality in English Language Education: Focus on Poland.

====Portugal====
Some sex education is taught as part of biology-related curricula. There is also an official program intended to provide sex education for students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dgidc.min-edu.pt/educacaosaude/index.php?s=directorio&pid=107 |title=DGE - Educação Sexual em Meio Escolar - Educação para a Saúde |publisher=Dgidc.min-edu.pt |access-date=August 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810152902/http://www.dgidc.min-edu.pt/educacaosaude/index.php?s=directorio&pid=107 |archive-date=August 10, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

====Netherlands====
Subsidized by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government, the "Long Live Love" package (''Lang leve de liefde''), developed in the late 1980s, aims to give teenagers the skills to make their own decisions regarding health and sexuality. Nearly all secondary schools provide sex education, as part of biology classes and over half of primary schools discuss sexuality and contraception. Starting the 2012 school year, age-appropriate sex education—including education about [[sexual diversity]] —will be compulsory in all secondary and primary schools. The curriculum focuses on biological aspects of reproduction as well as on values, attitudes, communication and negotiation skills. Dutch sex education encourages the idea that topics like masturbation, homosexuality, and sexual pleasure are normal or natural and that there are larger emotional, relational, and societal forces that shape the experiences of sexuality.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schalet|first1=Amy|title=Not under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex.|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|pages=33–34}}</ref> Moreover, according to Amy Schalet, Dutch parents tend to form close relationships with their children, openly discussing [[Adolescent sexuality|teen sexuality]]. Dutch parents try to accept their children's romantic relationships and even allow sleepovers, expecting them to have sex.<ref>[Schalet, Amy T. Not under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex. Chicago: U of Chicago, 2011.]</ref> The media has encouraged open dialogue and the health-care system guarantees confidentiality and a non-judgmental approach.

====Slovakia====
In [[Slovakia]] the content of sex education varies from school to school, most frequently as a segment of a larger lesson plan of a subject akin to "Nature science" in English (this course covers both biology and [[petrology]]). Generally the sex ed content taught in Slovakia is quite basic, sometimes lacking, though exactly what any given lesson contains varies among schools and is dependent on the teacher's knowledge of the subject. It is not uncommon for teachers to rely on students asking questions (as opposed to documentaries, discussions, textbooks and in-class debates). Classes are usually divided into boys and girls. Boys are taught the basics of sex, usually limited to dialogue between student and teacher of annotated diagrams of genitalia; while girls are additionally taught about menstruation and pregnancy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

====Sweden====
In [[Sweden]], sex education was established in 1921 for secondary education and in 1942 for all grades.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sex Education: Political Issues in Britain and Europe|last=Meredith|first=Philip|year=1989|pages=100–104}}</ref> The subject is usually started in kindergarten and continues cumulatively throughout the student's entire schooling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boethius|first=Carl|year=1986|title=Sex Education in Swedish Schools: The Facts and the Fiction|journal=Family Planning Perspectives|volume=17|issue=6|pages=276–279|doi=10.2307/2135318|jstor=2135318|pmid=3842667}}</ref> This sexual education is incorporated into different subjects such as biology and history.<ref name="swedsexed">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978575-2,00.html Sex Has Many Accents] ''TIME''</ref> The [[Swedish Association for Sexuality Education]] (RFSU) has a sex education that emphasizes "sexual diversity, freedom and enjoyment",<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Thanem|first=Torkild|year=2010|title=Free At Last?

Alongside this emphasis of sexual diversity, Swedish sex education has equal incorporations of lesbian and gay sexuality as well as heterosexual sexuality. They provide knowledge about masturbation, oral and anal sex as well as heterosexual, genital intercourse.<ref name=":0" />

====Switzerland====
In [[Switzerland]], the content and amount of sex education is decided at the [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] level. In [[Geneva]], courses have been given at the secondary level first for girls since 1926 and compulsory programs have been implemented at secondary level for all classes since the 1950s.<ref>Gentiane Burgermeister, Education sexuelle en milieu scolaire, l’expérience genevoise; '' Int. J. Pub. Health, (1972) 17; 1; 53-57''.</ref> In most French-speaking cantons since the '70s, generalized courses have been implemented by states with duly formed and trained specialists working within school health services at the secondary level.

Interventions in primary schools were started during the '80s, with the basic objective of empowering children, strengthening their resources, and giving the capacity to discriminate what is right or wrong based upon what is and isn't allowed by law and society. They are also given knowledge of their own rights, told that they can have their own feelings about themselves, and informed on whom to talk to in case they feel uncomfortable about a private matter and wish to talk about it.

Finally, the objectives include an enforcement of their capacity to decide for themselves and their ability to express their feeling about a situation and say "No". In secondary schools, there are programs at ages 13–14 and 16–17 with the basic objective to give students a secure moment with caring, well informed adults. With confidentiality and mutual respect, students can talk to an adult who understands youth needs and what they should know about sexual life in conformity with age and maturity.

In the German part of the country, the situation is somewhat different. Sex education as a school implemented program is a fairly recent subject, the responsibility given to school teachers. Though federal structures give authority to each State to decide, there are efforts, notably under the auspices of ''Santé sexuelle Suisse'' - the Swiss branch of IPPF (International Planned Parenthood Federation) - to look for and propose possible models of application which take into account all factors of sex education according to their different levels of concern, parents, teachers, and external experts.

In [[England and Wales]], Sex and relationship education (<abbr>[[Sex and Relationships Education|SRE]]</abbr>) is currently compulsory, in part, from age 11 onwards. It involves teaching children about reproduction, sexuality and sexual health. It doesn't promote early sexual activity or any particular sexual orientation. The compulsory parts of sex and relationship education are the elements contained within the national curriculum for science. Parents can currently withdraw their children from all other parts of sex and relationship education if they want.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/other-compulsory-subjects|title=The national curriculum: Other compulsory subjects - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-13}}</ref>

=====Scotland=====
The main sex education programme in [[Scotland]] is ''Healthy Respect'', which focuses not only on the biological aspects of reproduction but also on relationships and emotions. Education about [[Birth control|contraception]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]] are included in the programme as a way of encouraging good sexual health. In response to a refusal by Catholic schools to commit to the programme, however, a separate sex education programme has been developed for use in those schools. Funded by the [[Scottish Government]], the programme ''Called to Love'' focuses on encouraging children to delay sex until marriage, and does not cover contraception, and as such is a form of [[abstinence-only sex education]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scmo.org/articles/507/1/Cardinal-praises-dedication-and-commitment-of-Catholic-teachers/Page1.html |title=Cardinal praises "dedication and commitment" of Catholic teachers |publisher=Scmo.org |date=April 30, 2008 |access-date=August 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620082038/http://scmo.org/articles/507/1/Cardinal-praises-dedication-and-commitment-of-Catholic-teachers/Page1.html |archive-date=June 20, 2010 }}</ref>

For example, a 1999 study by the [[Guttmacher Institute]] found that most U.S. sex education courses in grades 7 through 12 cover puberty, [[HIV]], [[Sexually Transmitted Infection|STI]]s, [[abstinence]], implications of [[teenage pregnancy]], and how to resist peer pressure. Other studied topics, such as methods of [[birth control]] and infection prevention, [[sexual orientation]], [[sexual abuse]], and factual and ethical information about [[abortion]], varied more widely.<ref>{{cite journal  |author2=Jacqueline E.

Only two forms of sex education are taught in American schools: "abstinence plus" and "[[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only]]".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stanger-Hall|first=Kathrin F.|author2=David W.

A 2002 study conducted by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] found that 58% of secondary school principals describe their sex education curriculum as "abstinence plus".<ref name="Kaiser 2002"/>

Abstinence-only sex education tells teenagers that they should be sexually abstinent until marriage and does not provide information about contraception. In the Kaiser study, 34% of high-school principals said their school's main message was abstinence-only.

Among 48 of the 50 U.S. states (the exceptions were [[North Dakota]] and [[Wyoming]]) in their 2005 state laws and policies, 21 stressed abstinence-only sexual education and 7 emphasized that abstinence should be taught in their state's sexual education programs.

The difference between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject.

On the other hand, proponents of abstinence-only sex education object to curricula that fail to teach their standard of moral behavior; they maintain that a morality which is based on sex only within the bounds of marriage is "healthy and constructive" and that value-free knowledge of the body may lead to immoral, unhealthy, and harmful practices. Within the last decade, the federal government has encouraged abstinence-only education by steering over a billion dollars to such programs.<ref>

=====Texas=====
Sex education in [[Texas]] has recently become a policy of much focus in the state. With the rise of recent protests and proposed bills in the Texas House, the current policy has been the focus of much scrutiny. As of 1997, when Senate Bill 1 was enacted, Texas has left the decision of inclusion of sex education classes within schools up to the individual districts. The school board members are entitled to approve all curricula that are taught; however the bill has certain criteria that a school must abide by when choosing to teach Sex Ed. These include:
* present abstinence from sexual activity as the preferred choice of behavior in relationship to all sexual activity for unmarried persons of school age;
* devote more attention to abstinence from sexual activity than to any other behavior;
* emphasize that abstinence from sexual activity, if used consistently and correctly, is the only method that is 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and the emotional trauma associated with adolescent sexual activity;
* direct adolescents to a standard of behavior in which abstinence from sexual activity before marriage is the most effective way to prevent pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and infection with HIV or AIDS;  and
* teach contraception and condom use in terms of real-world failure rates, not statistics based on laboratory rates, if instruction on contraception and condoms is included in curriculum content.

Additionally, school districts are not authorized to distribute condoms in connection with instruction relating to human sexuality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/ED/htm/ED.28.htm#28.004 |title=EDUCATION CODE CHAPTER 28. COURSES OF STUDY; ADVANCEMENT |publisher=Statutes.legis.state.tx.us |access-date=August 5, 2014}}</ref>

Since the enactment of this policy, several research studies have been done to evaluate the Sex Ed Policy, namely the ''abstinence-only'' aspect of the teaching. Drs. David Wiley and Kelly Wilson published the ''Just Say Don't Know: Sexuality Education in Texas Public Schools''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfn.org/site/DocServer/SexEdRort09_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-10-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401062410/http://www.tfn.org/site/DocServer/SexEdRort09_web.pdf |archive-date=April 1, 2012 }}</ref> report where they found that:
*Shaming and fear-based instruction are commonly used for teaching sex ed
*Gender stereotypes are promoted
*A majority of students receive no information about human sexuality except abstinence
*The materials used regularly contain factual errors and distort the truth about condoms and STDs

According to Texas State Representative Mike Villarreal, "We have a responsibility to ensure that our children receive accurate information in the classroom, particularly when students' health is at stake," Villarreal said. "We're dealing with a myriad of problems in Texas as a result of our sky high teen pregnancy rates. We cannot allow our schools to provide erroneous information—the stakes are far too high."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/member-page/?district=123 |title=Texas House of Representatives : Representative Villarreal, Mike |publisher=House.state.tx.us |access-date=August 5, 2014}}</ref> With this in mind, many state legislators have proposed bills to improve sex education in Texas Schools.

This bill would require schools that teach sex education to provide evidence-based, age-appropriate information that emphasizes the importance of abstinence as the only 100% effective method of avoiding sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy, while also teaching about contraceptive methods to avoid STIs and pregnancy.

It did not receive a hearing.
Scientific evidence accumulated over many decades clearly demonstrates that the abstinence-only-until-married (AOUM) curriculum taught in Texas schools is harmful and ineffective in reducing the adolescent pregnancy rate in Texas. Despite these facts, recently published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, AOUM programs continue to be funded by the U.S. government. In fact, the U.S. government has spent more than $2 billion over the last 20 years to prohibit much-needed sex education in public schools, choosing instead to fund the AOUM curriculum while the adolescent pregnancy rates continue to rise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2017/abstinence-only-until-marriage-programs-are-ineffective-and-harmful-young-people|title=Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage Programs Are Ineffective and Harmful to Young People, Expert Review Confirms|date=2017-08-14|website=Guttmacher Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>

Catholic schools in Texas follow Catholic Church teachings in regard to Sex Education. Some opponents of sex education in Catholic schools believe sex ed programs are doing more harm to the young than good. Opponents of sex education contend that children are not mentally and emotionally ready for this type of instruction, and believe that exposing the young to sex ed programs may foster the students with the preoccupation of sex.

The Catholic Church believes that parents are the first educators and should rightfully fight for their duty as such in regard to sex education:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMESCHL/SECATHSC.HTM |title=Sex Education And Catholic Schools |publisher=Ewtn.com |access-date=August 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Keenan | first1 = J.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
The [[Government of Victoria]] (Australia) developed a policy for the promotion of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools in 1980 that was introduced into the State's primary and secondary schools during 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation/HealthAndHumanRelationsEducation#page/n0/mode/1up |title=Health and Human Relations Education |access-date=August 5, 2014}}</ref> The initiative was developed and implemented by the Honorable [[Norman Lacy]] MP, Minister for Educational Services from 1979 to 1982.

A ''Consultative Council for Health and Human Relations Education'' was established in December 1980 under the chairmanship of Dame [[Margaret Blackwood]]; its members possessed considerable expertise in the area.

The council had three major functions:
# to advise and to be consulted on all aspects of Health and Human Relations' Education in schools;
# to develop, for consideration of the Government, appropriate curriculum for schools;
# to advise and recommend the standards for in-service courses for teachers and relevant members of the school community.

Support services for the Consultative Council were provided by a new Health and Human Relations Unit within the Special Services Division of the Education Department of Victoria and was responsible for the implementation of the Government's policy and guidelines in this area. The Unit advised principals, school councils, teachers, parents, tertiary institutions and others in all aspects of ''Health and Human Relations Education''.

In 1981 the Consultative Council recommended the adoption of a set of guidelines for the provision of ''Health and Human Relations Education'' in schools as well as a Curriculum Statement to assist schools in the development of their programs. These were presented to the Victorian Cabinet in December 1981 and adopted as Government policy.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, sexuality education is part of the Health and Physical Education curriculum, which is compulsory for the first ten years of schooling (Years 1 to 10) but optional beyond that. Sexual and reproductive health education begins at Year 7 (approx. age 11), although broader issues such as physical, emotional and social development, personal and interpersonal skills, and (non-sexual) relationships begin as early as Year 1 (approx. age 5).<ref name="NZMoE">{{cite book |title= Sexuality Education: Revised Guide for Principals, Boards of Trustees, and Teachers |author= Ministry of Education |year= 2002 |location= Wellington |publisher= Learning Media |isbn= 0478267274 |url= http://health.tki.org.nz/content/download/1748/18347/file/Sexed+guide.pdf |access-date= June 26, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150121051529/http://health.tki.org.nz/content/download/1748/18347/file/Sexed+guide.pdf |archive-date= January 21, 2015 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

The Health / ''Hauora'' curriculum, including the sexuality education component, is the only part of the New Zealand Curriculum / ''Te Matauranga o Aotearoa'' (the former for English-medium schools, the latter for Māori-medium schools) in which state and [[state-integrated school]]s must legally consult with the school community regarding its delivery, and the consultations must occur at least once every two years.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM179262.html |title= Section 60B: Consultation about treatment of health curriculum -- Education Act 1989 -- New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |access-date= June 26, 2013}}</ref> Parents can ask for their children to be removed from the sexuality education component of the health curriculum for any reason, provided they apply in writing to the school principal, and do so at least 24 hours beforehand so alternative arrangements can be made.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0080/latest/DLM178247.html |title= Section 25AA: Release from tuition in specified parts of health curriculum -- Education Act 1989 -- New Zealand Legislation |publisher= Parliamentary Counsel Office |access-date= June 26, 2013}}</ref> However, this does not prevent a teacher answering sexuality education questions if a student, excluded or not, asks them.<ref name="NZMoE" />

==Morality==
There are two opposing sides of the sex education argument amongst parents. Sexual liberals see knowledge on sex as equipping individuals to make informed decisions about their personal sexuality, and they are in favor of comprehensive sexual education all throughout schooling, not just in high school. Sexual conservatives see knowledge on sex as encouraging adolescents to have sex, and they believe that sex should be taught inside the family in order for their morals to be included in the conversation. Sexual conservatives see the importance of teaching sex education, but only through [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence-only]] programs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=When Sex Goes To School: Warring Views on Sex- And Sex Education- Since The Sixties|last=Luker|first=Kristen|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=2006}}</ref>

Another viewpoint on sex education, historically inspired by sexologists such as [[Wilhelm Reich]] and psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[James W. Prescott]], holds that what is at stake in sex education is control over the body and liberation from social control. Proponents of this view tend to see the political question as whether society or the individual should teach sexual [[mores]]. Sexual education may thus be seen as providing individuals with the knowledge necessary to liberate themselves from socially organized [[sexual oppression]] and to make up their own minds. In addition, sexual oppression may be viewed as socially harmful. Sex and relationship experts like Reid Mihalko of "Reid About Sex"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reidaboutsex.com/|title=ReidAboutSex — Sex and Relationship Expert Reid Mihalko's official site|access-date=March 13, 2017}}</ref> suggest that open dialogue about physical intimacy and health education can generate more self-esteem, self-confidence, humor, and general health.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mihalko|first=Reid|title=About Reid|url=http://reidaboutsex.com/about-reid/|work=Reid About Sex|access-date=June 3, 2011}}</ref>

Some claim that certain sex education curricula break down pre-existing notions of [[modesty]] or encourage acceptance of what they consider immoral practices, such as [[homosexuality]] or [[premarital sex]]. Naturally, those that believe that homosexuality and premarital sex are a normal part of the range of human sexuality disagree with them.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shackelford, Katherine Grace, 1986- author.|title=Abstinence discourses, practices and sexual literacy at a small, Christian church in Central Texas|oclc=1099182508}}</ref>

Many religions teach that sexual behavior outside of marriage is immoral and/or psychologically damaging, and many adherents desire this morality to be taught as a part of sex education. They may believe that sexual knowledge is necessary, or simply unavoidable, hence their preference for curricula based on [[abstinence]].<ref>PBS, February 4, 2005 [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/week823/feature.html Religion & Ethics Newsweekly, Episode 823] Accessed December 30, 2006</ref>

==LGBT sex education==
{{Main|LGBT sex education}}
One major source of controversy in the realm of sex education is whether LGBT sex education should be integrated into school curricula.<ref name="NYT"/> LGBT sex education includes inclusive teaching of safe sex practices for [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] individuals and general instruction in topics related to [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]]. Studies have shown that many schools do not offer such education today.<ref name="Formby"/> Five states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas) have laws in place that ban teaching LGBT sex education. Only 20% of LGBT students have heard anything positive about their community and they reported in a 2011 [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]] (GLSEN) report that they were more likely to hear positive information about LGBT people from a history or social studies class rather than a health class.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kosciw|first=J.G.|year=2012|title=The 2011 National School Climate Survey: The experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth in our nation's schools|journal=Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network}}</ref>

=== Pro-LGBT ===

Proponents of LGBT sex education argue that encompassing homosexuality into the curricula would provide LGBT students with the sexual health information they need,<ref name="CSW">{{cite web|last=Sanchez |first=Marisol |title=Providing inclusive sex education in schools will address the health needs of LGBT Youth |url=http://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |publisher=Center for the Study of Women UCLA |access-date=October 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102525/https://www.csw.ucla.edu/publications/policy-briefs/policy-briefs/CSWPolicyBrief11.pdf |archive-date=October 6, 2014 }}</ref> and help to ameliorate problems such as low self-esteem and depression that research has shown can be present in LGBT individuals.<ref name="CAP">{{cite web|last=Slater|first=Hannah|title=LGBT-Inclusive Sex Education Means Healthier Youth and Safer Schools|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2013/06/21/67411/lgbt-inclusive-sex-education-means-healthier-youth-and-safer-schools/|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=November 2, 2013}}</ref> They also claim that it could reduce homophobic bullying.<ref name="CAP" /><ref name="HP">{{cite web|last=Goodman|first=Josh|title=5 Reasons Schools Should Adopt LGBTQ-inclusive Sex Ed|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-a-goodman/lgbtq-inclusive-sex-ed_b_3834914.html|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=November 2, 2013}}</ref>

An example of LGBT-inclusive curriculum is introduced by the National Sexuality Education Standards set forth by the Future of Sex Education Initiative. These education standards outline seven core topics that must be addressed in sex education; one of those core topics is identity. The identity topic presents lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities as possibilities for students as they progress through life and come to understand who they are. These standards, the Future of Sex Education argues, will start in kindergarten and will evolve into more complex topics throughout schooling as the students mature and age.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGarry|first=Robert|year=2013|title=Build a curriculum that includes everyone: ensuring that schools are more accepting of LGBT students and issues requires more than passing mentions of diversity in sex education classes|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=EAIM&id=GALE&#124;A320848233&v=2.1&it=r&sid=summon&userGroup=lom_umichanna&authCount=1#|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume=94|issue=5|doi=10.1177/003172171309400506|s2cid=144659807}}</ref> In the UK, BigTalk Education's Growing Up  Safe programme includes LGBT relationship education from [[Primary school|Primary School]] age, was awarded the 2017 Pamela Sheridan award for innovation and good practice in relationships and sex education (RSE), services and projects for young people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fpa.org.uk/awards/pamela-sheridan-award|title=Pamela Sheridan Award|date=2013-04-24|work=FPA|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012074138/https://www.fpa.org.uk/awards/pamela-sheridan-award|archive-date=October 12, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>
