The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] has impacted international relations and affected the political systems of multiple countries, causing suspensions of legislative activities, isolation or deaths of multiple politicians and reschedulings of elections due to fears of spreading the virus.

==General impacts==
[[File:Krajské volby 2020, Olomouc.jpg|thumb|Anti-pandemic precautions during the 2020 Czech regional elections]]
The response to the pandemic has resulted in unprecedented expansion of government power. Advocates of small government worry that the state will be reluctant to give up that power once the crisis is over, as has often been the case historically.<ref>''The Economist'', March 28th 2020, page 7.</ref>

===Leader popularity===

Sixteen member nations of the European Union issued a statement warning that certain emergency measures issued by countries during the coronavirus pandemic could undermine the principles of rule of law and democracy on 1 April.

The heads of thirteen member parties of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) made a proposal to expunge the Hungarian [[Fidesz]] for the new legislation on 2 April. In response, Viktor Orbán expressed his willingness to discuss any issues relating to Fidesz's membership "once the pandemic is over" in a letter addressed to the Secretary General of EPP [[Antonio López-Istúriz White]].

{{Main|COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary}}

The [[National Assembly (Hungary)|Hungarian Parliament]] gave the government [[plenary power]] which authorizes it to override acts and to [[rule by decree]] to the extent that is "necessary and proportional" in order to ''"''prevent, manage, and eradicate the epidemic and to avoid and mitigate its effects".<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=https://index.hu/english/2020/03/30/hungary_coronavirus_act_parliament_viktor_orban_fidesz_sweeping_powers_indefinite_term/|title=Hungarian Coronavirus Act passes, granting Viktor Orbán unprecedented emergency powers|last=Zoltán|first=Kovács|date=30 March 2020|website=index.hu|language=en|access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The law prescribes that the government is to report back to the parliament, or if it's unable to convene, to its speaker and the leaders of the parliamentary groups, regularly about the measures it has taken.<ref name=":2" /> The law also suspends [[by-elections]] and referendums for the duration of the emergency.<ref>{{cite web|last=Liu |first=Abraham |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-viktor-orban-rule-by-decree/ |title=Hungary's Viktor Orbán wins vote to rule by decree |work=Politico |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> The [[Constitutional Court of Hungary]] is authorized to hold sessions via electronic communications networks.<ref name=":2" /> The act also criminalizes "statements known to be false or statements distorting true facts" with 1 to 5 years imprisonment "if done in a manner capable of hindering or derailing the effectiveness of the response effort".<ref name=":2" /> The opposition had demanded a 90-day [[Sunset provision|sunset clause]] to the emergency powers in return for its support, but had its amendments voted down and therefore opposed the act.<ref name=":2" />

[[Human Rights Watch]] described the legislation, as an authoritarian takeover, due to the rule of decree without parliamentary or judicial scrutiny and for criminal penalties for the publishing of "false" or "distorted" facts, and gave support to the European Commission using [[Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 7]] against Hungary. Criticism and concern regarding the decree stemmed from existing [[democratic backsliding|backsliding]] of Hungarian democracy under the premiership of [[Viktor Orbán]] and his majority-ruling [[Fidesz]] party since Orbán began his second tenure as [[Prime Minister of Hungary|Prime Minister]] in 2010. Orbán has been accused by opposition leaders and other critics of his premiership of shifting Hungary towards [[authoritarianism]] by centralizing legislative and executive power through [[Constitution of Hungary#2011 Constitution|Constitutional reforms]] passed in 2011 and 2013, curbing civil liberties, restricting freedom of speech to the extent that some independent media outlets once critical of his rule have since been acquired by allies of Orbán, and weakening other institutional [[separation of powers|checks on Orbán's power]] including the Constitutional Court and judiciary. Critics of the Orbán/Fidesz government expressed concern that the emergency plenary powers may not be rescinded once the pandemic subsides, and could be abused to dubiously prosecute independent journalists critical of his coronavirus response or his governance more broadly, and curtail other freedoms of speech and expression. Some observers suggest that any significant misuse of or, once the crisis subsides, failure to rescind the plenary powers by Orbán government could place Hungary at great risk of becoming the European Union's first [[dictatorship]], in violation of E.U. regulations. (Turkey's proposed E.U. membership has been held up and advocates have urged the Union to terminate the proposal, because of human rights violations under [[President of Turkey|President]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]]'s government.)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/01/hungarys-authoritarian-takeover-puts-european-union-risk#|title=Hungary's Authoritarian Takeover Puts European Union at Risk|date=1 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404030627/https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/01/hungarys-authoritarian-takeover-puts-european-union-risk|archive-date=4 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/victor-orbans-power-grab-in-hungry-heightens-fears-of-dictatorship-in-eu-83h3g9lpm|title=Victor Orban's power grab in Hungary heightens fears of dictatorship in EU|date=2 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://balkaninsight.com/2020/03/31/hungary-no-longer-a-democracy-after-coronavirus-law/|title=HUNGARY 'NO LONGER A DEMOCRACY' AFTER CORONAVIRUS LAW|date=31 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/en/europe/20200401-how-coronavirus-legislation-could-create-the-eu-s-first-dictatorship|title=How coronavirus legislation could create the EU's first dictatorship|date=1 April 2020}}</ref> A petition against the legislation was signed by over 100,000 people.

In Wisconsin, a [[swing state]] with a Democratic governor and a Republican legislature, an April 7 election for a state Supreme Court seat, the federal presidential primaries for both the Democratic and Republican parties, and several other judicial and local elections went ahead as scheduled. Due to the pandemic, at least fifteen other U.S. states cancelled or postponed scheduled elections or primaries at the time of Wisconsin's election.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Corasaniti|first1=Nick|url=https://www.nytimes.com/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html|title=15 States Have Postponed Their Primaries Because of Coronavirus.

On 6 April, Evers attempted to move the election by an [[executive order]], but was blocked by the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]]. On the same day, a separate effort to extend the deadline for mailing [[absentee ballots]] was blocked by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

[[Human Rights Watch]] described the legislation, as an authoritarian takeover, due to the rule of decree without parliamentary or judicial scrutiny and for criminal penalties for the publishing of "false" or "distorted" facts, and gave support to the European Commission using [[Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 7]] against Hungary. Criticism and concern regarding the decree stemmed from existing [[democratic backsliding|backsliding]] of Hungarian democracy under the premiership of [[Viktor Orbán]] and his majority-ruling [[Fidesz]] party since Orbán began his second tenure as [[Prime Minister of Hungary|Prime Minister]] in 2010. Orbán has been accused by opposition leaders and other critics of his premiership of shifting Hungary towards [[authoritarianism]] by centralizing legislative and executive power through [[Constitution of Hungary#2011 Constitution|Constitutional reforms]] passed in 2011 and 2013, curbing civil liberties, restricting freedom of speech to the extent that some independent media outlets once critical of his rule have since been acquired by allies of Orbán, and weakening other institutional [[separation of powers|checks on Orbán's power]] including the Constitutional Court and judiciary. Critics of the Orbán/Fidesz government expressed concern that the emergency plenary powers may not be rescinded once the pandemic subsides, and could be abused to dubiously prosecute independent journalists critical of his coronavirus response or his governance more broadly, and curtail other freedoms of speech and expression. Some observers suggest that any significant misuse of or, once the crisis subsides, failure to rescind the plenary powers by Orbán government could place Hungary at great risk of becoming the European Union's first [[dictatorship]], in violation of E.U. regulations. (Turkey's proposed E.U. membership has been held up and advocates have urged the Union to terminate the proposal, because of human rights violations under [[President of Turkey|President]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]]'s government.)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/01/hungarys-authoritarian-takeover-puts-european-union-risk#|title=Hungary's Authoritarian Takeover Puts European Union at Risk|date=1 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404030627/https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/01/hungarys-authoritarian-takeover-puts-european-union-risk|archive-date=4 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/victor-orbans-power-grab-in-hungry-heightens-fears-of-dictatorship-in-eu-83h3g9lpm|title=Victor Orban's power grab in Hungary heightens fears of dictatorship in EU|date=2 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://balkaninsight.com/2020/03/31/hungary-no-longer-a-democracy-after-coronavirus-law/|title=HUNGARY 'NO LONGER A DEMOCRACY' AFTER CORONAVIRUS LAW|date=31 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rfi.fr/en/europe/20200401-how-coronavirus-legislation-could-create-the-eu-s-first-dictatorship|title=How coronavirus legislation could create the EU's first dictatorship|date=1 April 2020}}</ref> A petition against the legislation was signed by over 100,000 people.
