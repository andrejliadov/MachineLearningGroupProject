'''Biorisk''' generally refers to the risk associated with biological materials and/or infectious agents, also known as [[pathogen]]s. The term has been used frequently for various purposes since the early 1990s.<ref>Ecotoxicology of Soil Organisms: Conference : Papers By Marianne H. Donker, H. Eijsackers, Fred Heimbach Contributor Marianne H. Donker, H. Eijsackers, Fred Heimbach; CRC Press, 1994</ref><ref>Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications By Kenneth E. Avis, Herbert A. Lieberman, Leon Lachman Contributor Kenneth E. Avis; Informa Health Care, 1993</ref> The term is used by [[Regulatory agency|regulators]], laboratory personnel and industry alike and is used by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).<ref>The World Health Organization, Biorisk Management: [https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/biosafety/WHO_CDS_EPR_2006_6.pdf ''Laboratory Biosecurity Guidance''] September 2006, WHO/CDS/EPR/2006.6

An international ''Laboratory Biorisk Management Standard'' developed under the auspices of the [[European Committee for Standardization]], defines biorisk as the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm where the source of harm is a biological agent or [[toxin]].<ref>The European Committee for Standardization, ''Laboratory Biorisk Management Standard'', CWA 15793:2008, p.9, www.cen.eu</ref> The source of harm may be an unintentional exposure, accidental release or loss, theft, misuse, diversion, unauthorized access or intentional unauthorized release.

In Norway, "Biorisk" is trademarked by the Norwegian [[accredited registrar]] [[DNV]].<ref>The Norwegian Industrial Property Office, ''Norsk varemerketidende'', no. 49, vol. 93, 2003.12.01, p. 36,  [http://www.patentstyret.no/upload/filarkiv/tidende/varemerketidende/2003/varemerketidende-nr49-2003.pdf (dead url)]</ref>

==Biorisk reduction==
Biorisk reduction involves creating expertise in managing high-consequence [[pathogen]]s, by providing training on safe handling and control of pathogens that pose significant health risks.<ref>{{cite web |title=WHO: Biorisk Reduction |url=https://www.who.int/csr/bioriskreduction/en/ |website=WHO |accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref>
