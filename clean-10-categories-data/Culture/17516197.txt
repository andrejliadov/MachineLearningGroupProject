==Plot==
Tarzan rescues [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]] from [[Arab]] slave-traders after they have been marooned in [[Africa]].  They return to the cabin where his parents lived before their death.  Jane is captured by [[La (Tarzan)|Queen La]] of [[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]], taken to that hidden city, and is to be made a sacrifice.  Tarzan rescues her and they escape.  Nikolas Rokoff and [[William Cecil Clayton]], the usurper to Tarzan's title of Lord Greystoke, learn that Jane has a map to the city (which contains fabulous riches in exotic jewels), [[tattoo]]ed onto her back.  They kidnap her and attempt to loot the city.  
Tarzan braves many perils, finally rescues Jane, defeats the villains and escapes La's amorous clutches.

==Production==
The success of the serial ''[[The Son of Tarzan (film)|The Son of Tarzan]]'' inspired [[Great Western Producing Company]] to approach Tarzan's creator [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] about making another Tarzan serial. However, the rights for another Tarzan film were still retained by the Weiss brothers' [[Numa Pictures Corporation]], the makers of the feature film ''[[The Revenge of Tarzan]]''. When Numa discovered that Great Western had Elmo Lincoln, the first screen Tarzan, signed to play the lead, they agreed to a deal in which Great Western would produce the film while Numa would handle distribution.<ref name="Essoe">{{cite book

===Casting===
This serial marked Elmo Lincoln's return to the part of Tarzan, whom he was the first to play, but it was also Lincoln's last time as the character.<ref name="Essoe" /> The serial was advertised as "Censor-proof."<ref name="GMS" /> Nevertheless, censorship forced the previously bare-chested Lincoln to cover up and wear an over-the-shoulder-styled costume for this production.<ref name="Essoe" /> Jane was played by Louise Lorraine, who celebrated her sixteenth birthday during production.<ref name="Essoe" /> As advertised "Joe Martin, famous screen ape, plays a leading part."<ref name="GMS" /> Production started January 1 and finished August 13, 1921.<ref name="Essoe" /> The serial's prologue featured Edgar Rice Burroughs himself.<ref name="GMS" />

===Stunts===
Frank Merrill began doubling Lincoln about half way through the serial. Lincoln was insured for $150,000 and the insurers were not happy with him doing his own stunts. Seven years later, Merrill was cast as the Apeman in ''[[Tarzan the Mighty]]''.<ref name="Essoe" /><ref name="GMS" /><ref name="stedman">{{cite book |last=Stedman |first=Raymond William |title=Serials: Suspense and Drama By Installment |year=1971 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0-8061-0927-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/serialssuspensea00sted/page/56 56] |chapter=3.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
For marketing purposes The Adventures of Tarzan Serial Sales Corporation was formed in New York. The serial sold in half of all available markets without the use of a road man.  Within three months of the completion date it had sold out in most countries world wide.<ref name="Essoe" />  Despite rumours circulated that the serial was not new material, but just a rehash of footage from previous Tarzan films, ''The Adventures of Tarzan'' was a successful film and one of the top four attractions of the year.<ref name="Essoe" />  The film was reedited and released with sound effects twice—first in 1928, and a second time in 1935.

===Home media===
The complete fifteen chapter version [[partially lost films|has not survived]].  The version available on DVD is the 1928 ten chapter re-release.

==Critical reception==
''The Exhibitors Herald'' wrote, "Elmo Lincoln as Tarzan is too well known to theater-goers to need further introduction. His red-blooded fights, staged in each episode, will evoke applause from the serial audience." ''Film Fun Magazine'' wrote, "There are enough wild animals introduced in each episode to keep the younger generation, which has shown a predilection for the serial form of entertainment, whooping her up.”<ref name="Essoe" />

==Influence==
The success of the serial inspired a Broadway show, ''Tarzan of the Apes,'' but critics attacked it as fit only for film and unsuitable for the stage.<ref name="Essoe" />
