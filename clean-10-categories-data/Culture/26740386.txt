'''Heritage science''' is the interdisciplinary domain of scientific study of heritage. Heritage science draws on diverse [[humanities]], [[sciences]] and [[engineering]] disciplines. It focuses on enhancing the [[understanding]], care and [[sustainable]] use of [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] so it can enrich people's lives, both today and in the future. Heritage science is an umbrella term encompassing all forms of scientific enquiry into human works and the combined works of nature and humans, of value to people.

The term has become widely used after 2006 when it became increasingly evident that the more traditional terms [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]] or preservation science inadequately reflected the breadth of research into [[cultural heritage]]. Heritage scientists in museums, galleries, libraries, archives, universities and research institutions support conservation (often called [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]]), access (e.g. development of new [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] tools), interpretation, including [[archaeometry]] and [[archaeological science]] (e.g. dating, [[Provenance|provenancing]], attribution), heritage management (e.g. development of tools and knowledge supporting strategic or environmental management decisions) and wider societal engagement with heritage (e.g. heritage [[Value (ethics)|values and ethics]]). Heritage science is also an excellent vehicle for public engagement with science as well as heritage.

Heritage science is seen as "key to the long-term sustainability of heritage: it is about managing change and risk and maximising social, cultural and economic benefit not just today, but in such a way that we can pass on to future generations that which we have inherited."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldsctech/256/256.pdf |title=Science and Technology Committee : Science and Heritage |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=2015-02-26}}</ref> Domains of research, where heritage science makes a particular input were recognised to be museums, galleries, libraries and archives; the built historic environment and archaeology, by the United Kingdom National Heritage Science Strategy documents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescienceforum.org.uk/strategy.php | title=UK National Heritage Science Strategy | accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref>

==Theory==
[[File:Red Rot Leather.jpg|right|thumbnail|Red rot on leather bindings was one of the first conservation issues to excite scientists.]]
The field still requires its literature canon and opinions on whether heritage science is a domain in its own right or a field of research diverge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5SpIq80XpU | title=Round Table discussion on the Future of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref> However, this appears a matter of academic recognition, rather than a matter of research practice.

Heritage science is an old field of research: in his [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] in 1843, [[Michael Faraday]] already pointed out how pollution importantly contributes to book degradation. The following premises appear to be of defining importance:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://heritagescienceresearch.wordpress.com/2015/11/17/theory_heritagescience/ | title=A Brief Theory of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08| date=2015-11-17}}</ref>
# Heritage science is inherently biased, as scientists, by doing research on heritage, contribute to its value: they create and popularize heritage through their research. 
# Heritage science is neither fundamental nor experimental: work with actual heritage objects, building or sites cannot be repeatable because heritage is not an experiment. On the other hand, the [[scientific method]] and deductive reasoning is easily applied when working with models and model objects, which heritage scientists often do due to the high value of actual historic objects and consequentially, sampling restrictions.

Since the context of heritage is often unknown, there can be any number of variables affecting the heritage system under observation – inductive reasoning is therefore often applied in heritage science. In this aspect, the premise of heritage science comes close to social science.
Heritage that is accessible, in its preserved authentic form or as a (digital) reproduction, is a "resource for economic growth, employment and social cohesion".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/library/publications/2014-heritage-communication_en.pdf |title=Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe |publisher=EU |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref> Through improved access, heritage science therefore contributes to well-being. Heritage science is proof that there is no world of [[The Two Cultures|'Two Cultures']]. A scientist, researching heritage defies the existence of the divide: there can be no scientific research of heritage without a contribution by humanities research. Heritage science also successfully bridges science and culture, because it provides an attractive vehicle to convey ideas and concepts related to technology and engineering, as well as culture and society. Heritage science can be considered an anthropogenic analog to environmental geography, which was defined by [[Halford Mackinder]] in 1887 as a discipline that aims to "bridge one of the greatest of all gaps" between "the natural sciences and the study of humanity".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MacKinder|first=H. J.|date=1887|title=On the Scope and Methods of Geography|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography|volume=9|issue=3|pages=141–174|doi=10.2307/1801248|jstor=1801248|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2320045}}</ref>

==Research==
[[Image:WoS publications 2015.png|right|thumbnail|Publication trends in the heritage science field, 2005-2014.]]

Heritage science is an increasingly lively science domain. Materials and techniques of the past are often very difficult to study and state-of-the-art techniques and methods need to be employed. Discoveries new to science are often the result of such endeavours, e.g. new antibiotics from bacteria discovered in the [[Cave of Altamira]], in Spain. With its wide definition, heritage science spans a significant variety of scientific activities. In order to support conservation, access, interpretation and management, heritage science must be based on an [[interdisciplinary]] palette of knowledge, from fundamental sciences ([[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]]) to [[arts]] and [[humanities]] (conservation, [[archaeology]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[history]], [[art history]] etc.), including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[computer science]]s and [[engineering]].

In academia, heritage science is often performed by scientists spending a proportion of their time on heritage-related research. The academic field, judged by the number of academic outputs published annually, is steadily increasing. This could be taken to estimate the domain size – with the number of outputs in 2014 being 6,800 (Source: Web of Science<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ |title=ISI Web of Knowledge |publisher=Images.isiknowledge.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref>), it could be assumed that there are about 3,000 heritage scientists active in the field (publishing on average 2 academic publications per year). This goes against the generally held view that the field is small.

The proportion per country varies greatly, about 20% of researchers being active in the US, 15% in the UK, 10% in Italy, 5% France, and 5% in China (with a strong increase in the last decade).

Since 2013, the scientific domain has its own flagship journal, ''Heritage Science''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/ |title=Heritage Science |publisher=Heritagesciencejournal.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref>

In 2013, the Mind the Gap project,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/our-role/collection-care/heritage-science-research-and-development/collaborative-working-practices-mind-the-gap/ |title= Mind the gap project |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref> funded by the UK EPSRC/AHRC Science and Heritage Programme,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescience.ac.uk/ |title= UK AHRC/EPSRC Science and Heritage Programme |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref> reported on the drivers and impediments in cross-disciplinary research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mind-the-gap-report-jan-2014.pdf |title=Mind the Gap Report |publisher=AHRC |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref> The project found that there is no gap between rigour and relevance in heritage science research but rather that there is a continuum of activity. However, there was less satisfaction with heritage science research in relation to its impact on practice, in comparison to its academic impact.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Mind the gap: rigour and relevance in collaborative heritage science research |journal= Heritage Science |volume= 2 |pages= 11 |doi= 10.1186/2050-7445-2-11 |year= 2014 |last1= Dillon |first1= Catherine |last2= Bell |first2= Nancy |last3= Fouseki |first3= Kalliopi |last4= Laurenson |first4= Pip |last5= Thompson |first5= Andrew |last6= Strlič |first6= Matija |url= http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1432599/1/2050-7445-2-11.pdf }}</ref>

The heritage science career paths are various. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of heritage science, any academic background is suitable, from [[formal sciences]], [[natural sciences]] to [[social sciences]]. 
Most researchers have entered the field by carrying out doctoral research in the field, which is due to the fact that there is currently no undergraduate course in this domain. Since 2010, Master's degree courses in heritage science have become available at [[University College London]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/heritage/programmes/mres-msc/mres-seaha |title=Heritage Science Masters at UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref> and [[Queens University Belfast]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/gap/ProspectiveStudents/PostgraduateStudies/GraduateStudiesTaught/HeritageScience/ |title=Heritage Science Masters at Queens University, Belfast |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref> In Italy, students can obtain undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in conservation science at the [[University of Florence]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unifi.it/p-cor2-2016-101227-B194-GEN-1-1.html|title=Offerta formativa - Università degli Studi di Firenze - UniFI|website=www.unifi.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}</ref> [[University of Bologna]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corsi.unibo.it/SCIENCEFORCONSERVATION/Pages/default.aspx|title=Two year master in Science for the conservation-restoration of cultural heritage - Ravenna - Università di Bologna|website=corsi.unibo.it|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28}}</ref> and a recently created programme at the [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice|University of Venice]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unive.it/pag/20740/|title=Summary: Master's Degree Programme in Conservation Science and Technology for Cultural Heritage - Ca' Foscari|website=www.unive.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}</ref> Several other universities in Italy have faculty members whose primary research focus is in heritage science; these groups often accept international students who would like to obtain a PhD in the field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scich.it/index.html|title=COLOMBINI GROUP - Chemical Science for the Safeguard of Cultural Heritage|website=www.scich.it|access-date=2017-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?oscar.chiantore#profilo|title=Prof. Oscar Chiantore - Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Scienza dei Materiali - Università degli Studi di Torino|last=Torino|first=Università degli Studi di|website=scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}</ref> Taught courses in heritage science programmes include elements of heritage science, e.g. technical art history is often part of [[art history]] courses, and [[natural sciences]] are often taught in conservation courses. [[Brandenburg University of Technology]] in Germany offers the international Master's programme World Heritage Studies <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/en/heritage-studies-phd/|title=World Heritage Studies, Master of Arts|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref> and PhD programme Heritage Studies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/worldheritage-ma/|title=PhD Programme Heritage Studies|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref>

At [[University College London|UCL]], [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Brighton]], the Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology ([http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ SEAHA]) was established in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ |title=Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology |accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref> A key aspect of the SEAHA scheme is the collaborative nature of projects, enabling partnerships between academic institutions, industry and national heritage agencies and giving an applied focus to the research training.

Since the field requires significant cross-disciplinary and transferable skills, graduates may be able to take jobs in industry and academia. To work within the field of heritage science (e.g. in a museum laboratory), a PhD in a field of science and significant experience in a heritage environment is typically required.
