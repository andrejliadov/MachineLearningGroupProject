'''Cultural governance''' is [[governance]] of [[culture]]. It includes [[cultural policy]] made by [[government]]s but extends also to cultural influence exerted by [[non-state actor]]s and to policies which influence culture indirectly.

== Meaning ==

The tendency to discuss cultural governance rather than policy corresponds to the broader shift from [[government]] to governance, with the emphasis shifting from state policymakers to include the influence of [[civil society organizations]] and the [[private sector]]. A broad interpretation of "governance" could also include government policies outside the scope of cultural policy which nevertheless impact culture.<ref>Schmitt (2011), pp. 48–49. “In order to be able to understand the governance of a cultural object, this must not just be considered alone, but also in the light of the often conflicting overlaps and interferences between different fields of governance that have an interest in the “cultural object”. Such considerations lead to the concept of cultural governance ''in the broad sense''. For example, the members of a theater ensemble may be bound by labour regulations, or the treatment of a historic building may be determined by fire prevention regulations or the specific interest of the users.”</ref>

The precise meaning of "cultural governance" also depends heavily on the definition of culture, which can range from narrow reference to institutions like [[museum]]s and [[concert hall]]s connected with [[the arts]] to broad meanings such as a society’s [[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]] or its systems of [[knowledge]] and [[symbol]]s.<ref>Schmitt (2011), pp. 11–18. Concepts or ideas thus have a twofold dialectical relationship with human agency on the one hand, and institutions on the other hand: concepts or ideas have a discursive influence on human agency, shaping actions, whether consciously, practically or unconsciously (see also Giddens 1984, Werlen 1997: 153). However, when actors take up ideas and appropriate them for themselves, they can change them, or they can create new ideas; they do not always have to act as passive recipients and actualizers of discourses. There is also a dialectical relationship between ideas and concepts on the one hand, and institutions on the other hand; but strictly speaking this relationship is always mediated by human agency. Political institutions (such as UNESCO) can take up and spread ideas, and can also reshape them. Ideas and institutions mutually “frame” each other (for a neo-Gramscian view, see Bøås/ McNeill 2004). / Ideas, symbols, concepts constitute one pole of the cultural sphere, while the other pole is made up of actions and practices (especially rituals and performances) and the material (or digital) artefacts in which concepts, ideas, senses and meanings are manifested.”</ref> In the broader view, cultural governance deals holistically with the production of meaning in a society, through aspects including the [[culture industry]], the formation of [[taste (sociology)|taste]], and the use of [[language]].<ref name=Schmitt2009>Thomas M. Schmitt, “[https://www.erdkunde.uni-bonn.de/archive/2009/global-cultural-governance.-decision-making-concerning-world-heritage-between-politics-and-science Global Cultural Governance: Decision-Making Concerning World Heritage Between Politics and Science]”; ''[[Erdkunde]]'' 63(2), 2009.</ref>

The dominant actor in global cultural governance is [[UNESCO]], a United Nations specialized agency created in 1946 and headquartered in Paris, France.<ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013 /> UNESCO produces documents which local governments frequently use as guidelines and may incorporate into law. It has also promoted the development of networks such as the Global Alliance for Cultural Diversity to promote [[public/social/private partnership]] in the cultural area. In recent years{{when|date=September 2017}} the organization has emphasized the importance of [[cities]] (with non-profit organizations participating in local governance) as cultural actors with networks such as the [[International Coalition of Cities Against Racism]] and the [[Creative Cities Network]].<ref name=DuxburyJeannotte2013>Nancy Duxbury & Sharon Jeannotte, "[http://www.ces.uc.pt/myces/UserFiles/livros/1097_Global_Cultural_Governance_Policy_Duxbury-Jeannotte_2013.pdf Global Cultural Governance Policy]"; Chapter 21 in ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Planning and Culture''; London: Ashgate, 2013.

In the [[China|People's Republic of China]] a major goal of cultural governance is to reinforce the legitimacy of the government.<ref name=Perry2013 /> Culture has long played a role in the governance of China, from the harmonious society promoted by [[Confucianism]] to the [[Cultural Revolution]] and other [[Chinese Communist Party]] strategies for transforming [[Chinese social structure|traditional society]] into [[Chinese industrialization|industrialized]] communism. Present-day Chinese leaders have made significant references in speeches to a continual tradition of [[Chinese culture]] and its importance for [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] purposes. Cultural governance is integrated with [[Propaganda in the People's Republic of China|propaganda]], [[Censorship in China|censorship]], [[political music in China|music]], and [[education in China|education]].<ref name=Perry2013>[[Elizabeth J. Perry]], ''[https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/11386987 Cultural Governance in Contemporary China: “Re-Orienting” Party Propaganda]''; Harvard-Yenching Institute Working Paper Series, 2013. "Despite such monumental ideological and institutional changes, however, the contemporary Chinese state also leans heavily on cultural governance. While far from 'traditional' in its espoused secularism and embrace of a 'scientific development outlook,' the PRC continues to devote considerable attention and energy to the exercise of symbolic power as a means to affirm its right to rule. [...] China's rulers today are quite explicit in the high value they put on cultural governance. They are almost equally explicit in their instrumental use of cultural governance for nationalistic ends."</ref> Within the Chinese [[Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Culture]], the [[State Administration of Cultural Heritage]] has stated that China's [[cultural heritage]] should be used to "strengthen national unity and promote sustainable development of the natural culture".<ref name=ShepherdYu2013p50>Shepherd & Yu (2013), pp. 49–51.</ref>

Localities in China have assumed much of the responsibility for identifying heritage sites, with the result that 300,000 such sites have been declared, many without state protection and support. Local governments have frequently turned to private companies to [[cultural heritage management|manage]] these sites and operate [[tourism in China|tourism businesses]].<ref name=ShepherdYu2013p50 /><ref name=HuangRyanYang2013 /> Sites may also come under many overlapping authorities, as in the case of [[Mount Wutai]], a national park and World Heritage Site, which is managed by eight government agencies and governed by 29 international, national, and local laws.<ref>Shepherd & Yu (2013), p. 53. "Mount Wutai, a sacred Buddhist mountain area designated a national park in 1982 and inscribed as a world heritage site in 2009, illustrates this fragmented bureaucratic structure of competing interests. Overall management authority is shared by the Ministry of Housing and Urban–rural Development and the Construction Authority of Shanxi Province. But the park’s forest reserves are overseen by the State Forestry Administration, temple sites by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, religious practice at temples and monasteries by the State Administration for Religious Affairs, geological sites by the Ministry of Geology, fossils by the Ministry of Land and Resources, and tourism by the National Tourism Administration. Finally, 29 different international, national, and provincial conventions, laws, and decrees impact the site (Shepherd 2012 ) . These range from the 1972 Convention on World Heritage and various State Council decrees on heritage protection to national laws regulating geological heritage (1995), forests (1998), fossils (2002), cultural relics (2003), religious practice (2004), and scenic areas (2006)."</ref>
