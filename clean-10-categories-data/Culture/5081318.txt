[[File:HistMac.gif|326px|thumb|The contemporary geographical [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] is not ''officially defined'' by any international organisation or state. In some contexts it appears to span five (six counting [[Kosovo]], disputed with [[Serbia]]) current sovereign countries: [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Kosovo]], and [[Serbia]]. For more details see the ''boundaries and definitions'' section in [[Macedonia (region)#Boundaries and definitions|Macedonia (region)]]]]
The name '''''Macedonia''''' is used in a number of competing or overlapping meanings to describe geographical, political and historical areas, languages and peoples in a part of south-eastern Europe. It has been a major source of political controversy since the early 20th century. The situation is complicated because different ethnic groups use different terminology for the same entity, or the same terminology for different entities, with different political connotations.

Historically, the region has presented markedly shifting borders across the [[Balkans|Balkan]] peninsula. Geographically, no single definition of its borders or the names of its subdivisions is accepted by all scholars and ethnic groups. Demographically, it is mainly inhabited by four ethnic groups, three of which self-identify as ''Macedonians'': two, a [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Bulgarian]] and a [[Macedonians (Greeks)|Greek]] one at a regional level, while a third [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] one at a national level. Linguistically, the names and affiliations of languages and dialects spoken in the region are a source of controversy. Politically, the rights to the extent of the use of the name ''Macedonia'' and its derivatives has led to a [[Macedonia naming dispute|diplomatic dispute]] between [[Greece]] and [[North Macedonia]]. After using provisional reference of the "former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" (FYROM), Greece and the then-Republic of Macedonia reached an [[Prespa agreement|agreement]] that the latter would change its name to ''North Macedonia''. It came into effect on 12 February 2019.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Macedonia'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Μακεδονία}} (''Makedonía''),<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2364599 Μακεδονία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> a [[Macedon|kingdom]] (later, [[Macedonia (region)|region]]) named after the [[ancient Macedonians]], from the Greek {{lang|grc|Μακεδόνες}} (''Makedones''), "Macedonians", explained as having originally meant either "the tall ones" or "highlanders".<ref>{{OEtymD|Macedonia}}</ref> The word {{lang|el|Μακεδνόν}} (''Makednon'') is first attested in [[Herodotus]] as the name which the Greek [[Ethnic group|ethnos]] was called (which was later called [[Dorians|Dorian]]) when it settled around [[Pindus]] mountain range.<ref>Herodotus , ''Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0125%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D56%3Asection%3D3 1.56.2,3]: "ταῦτα γὰρ ἦν τὰ προκεκριμένα, ἐόντα τὸ ἀρχαῖον τὸ μὲν Πελασγικὸν τὸ δὲ Ἑλληνικὸν ἔθνος. καὶ τὸ μὲν οὐδαμῇ κω ἐξεχώρησε, τὸ δὲ πολυπλάνητον κάρτα. ἐπὶ μὲν γὰρ Δευκαλίωνος βασιλέος οἴκεε γῆν τὴν Φθιῶτιν, ἐπὶ δὲ Δώρου τοῦ Ἕλληνος τὴν ὑπὸ τὴν Ὄσσαν τε καὶ τὸν Ὄλυμπον χώρην, καλεομένην δὲ Ἱστιαιῶτιν: ἐκ δὲ τῆς Ἱστιαιώτιδος ὡς ἐξανέστη ὑπὸ Καδμείων, οἴκεε ἐν Πίνδῳ Μακεδνὸν καλεόμενον: ἐνθεῦτεν δὲ αὖτις ἐς τὴν Δρυοπίδα μετέβη καὶ ἐκ τῆς Δρυοπίδος οὕτω ἐς Πελοπόννησον ἐλθὸν Δωρικὸν ἐκλήθη."</ref> ''Makednon'' is related to the [[Ancient Greek]] adjective {{lang|grc|μακεδνός}} (''makednós''), meaning "tall, slim",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmakedno%2Fs μακεδνός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> attested in [[Homer]] and [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] in its feminine form "μακεδνή" (''makednē''), meaning "long, tall".<ref>Homer, ''Odyssey'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0012,002:7:106&lang=original 7.106]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/stream/hesychiialexand00schmgoog#page/n537/mode/2up Hesychii Alexandrini lexicon]</ref>  It cognates with the words {{lang|grc|μακρός}} (''makros'', "long, large")<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmakro%2Fs1 μακρός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> and {{lang|grc|μήκος}} (''mēkos'', "length"),<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmh%3Dkos μήκος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> both deriving from the [[Indo-European root]] ''*mak-'', meaning "long' or "slender".<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/*mak- *mak-], Etymonline</ref> Linguist [[Robert S.

The [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] has been home to several historical political entities, which have used the name ''Macedonia''; the main ones are given below. The borders of each of these entities were different.

=== Early history ===
==== Ancient Macedonia ====
{{main|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}
[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] or ''Macedon'', the ancient [[monarchy|kingdom]],<ref name="Definition of Macedon">{{cite web |last1=Mark |first1=Joshua J. |title=Macedon definition |url=https://www.ancient.eu/macedon/ |website=Ancient history |publisher=Ancient History encyclopedia}}</ref> was located on the periphery of [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece]], and later became the dominant state of [[Hellenistic Greece]]. It was centered on the fertile plains west of the [[Gulf of Salonica]] (today north-western [[Greece]]); the first Macedonian state emerged in the 8th or early 7th century&nbsp;BC. Its extent beyond the center varied; some Macedonian kings could not hold their capital; [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] expanded his power until it reached from [[Epirus]], across [[Thrace]] to Gallipoli, and from [[Thermopylae]] to the Danube.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lane Fox |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Lane Fox |title=Alexander the Great |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |year=1973 |pages=17, 30 |isbn=978-0-7139-0500-7}}</ref> His son [[Alexander the Great]] conquered most of the land in southwestern Asia stretching from what is currently Turkey in the west to parts of India in the east. However, while Alexander's conquests are of major historical importance as having launched the [[Hellenistic Age]], Macedon as a state had no significant territorial gains due to them. Alexander's kingdom fell apart after his death in 323 BC; several of his [[Diadochi|Successors]] attempted to form a kingdom for themselves in Macedonia; the kingdom formed by [[Antigonus Gonatas]] contained all the land Philip II had started with and controlled much of what is now modern Greece; it lasted until the Romans divided it into four republics in 168&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rostovtseff |first=Michael Ivanovitch |title=History of the Ancient World (translated by James Duff Duff) |publisher=Biblo & Tannen Publishers |volume=II |year=1926 |page=78  |isbn=978-0-8196-2163-4}}</ref>

==== Roman Macedonia ====
{{main|Macedonia (Roman province)}}
{{see also|Diocese of Macedonia}}
The ancient Romans had two different entities called ''Macedonia'', at different levels. [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] was established as a [[Roman province]] in 146&nbsp;BC. Its boundaries were shifted from time to time for administrative convenience, but during the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Principate]] it extended west to the Adriatic and south to [[Central Greece]].

Under [[Diocletian]], [[Thessaly]], including parts of [[West Macedonia]], was split off to form a new province, and the central and southern Balkan provinces were grouped into the [[Diocese of Moesia]]. At some point in the 4th century (first securely attested in 370) this was divided into two new dioceses, the mostly Latin-speaking [[Diocese of Dacia]] in the north and the mostly Greek-speaking [[Diocese of Macedonia]] in the south. Under [[Constantine the Great]], the western part of the province of Macedonia was also split off to form the new province of [[Epirus nova]]. After Constantine's death, the western Balkans, Macedonia included, became part of the [[praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]].<ref>{{harvp|Roisman|Worthington|2010|pp=547–548}}</ref>

With the exception of a short-lived division between ''Macedonia Prima'' in the south and ''Macedonia Salutaris'' in the north towards the end of the 4th century (attested only in the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]''), Macedonia formed a single province until re-divided into southern and northern parts sometime in the late 5th century (the division is first securely attested in 482), although the province seems to have been reunified by 535. According to the 6th-century ''[[Synecdemus]]'', ''Macedonia Prima'', with [[Thessalonica]] as its capital and governed by a ''[[consularis]]'', counted 32 cities, and ''Macedonia Secunda'' in the north, with [[Stobi]] as its capital and governed by a ''[[praeses]]'', only eight. The approximate boundary between the two ran on a rough line from north of [[Bitola]] (which belonged to ''Macedonia Prima'') to the area of [[Demir Kapija]].<ref>{{harvp|Roisman|Worthington|2010|pp=548–550}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Kazhdan|1991|p=1261}}</ref>

==== Byzantine Macedonia ====
{{main|Macedonia (theme)}}
During the 7th century, most of the Balkans were overrun by [[Slavs|Slavic]] invasions, which left only the fortified towns and the coasts in the hands of the Greek-speaking [[Byzantine Empire]]. "[[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]]" was then used for a new [[theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|theme]] in the late 8th century under [[Irene of Athens]]. Geographically however it was located in [[Thrace]] and not in Macedonia, which was under the themes of [[Thessalonica (theme)|Thessalonica]], [[Strymon (theme)|Strymon]] and other smaller commands such as [[Boleron]] or [[Drougoubiteia]].<ref>{{harvp|Kazhdan|1991|pp=1261–1262, 1968}}</ref> Themes were not named geographically and the original sense was "army". They became districts during the military and fiscal crisis of the seventh century, when the Byzantine armies were instructed to find their supplies from the locals, wherever they happened to be. Thus the [[Armeniac theme]] was considerably west of [[Armenia]]; the [[Thracesian Theme]] was in Asia Minor, not in Thrace.<ref>{{harvp|Treadgold|1997|pp=421, 478, ''et passim''}}</ref> The [[Macedonian dynasty]] of the Byzantine Empire acquired its name from its founder, [[Basil I the Macedonian]], an [[Armenians|Armenian]] by descent, who was born in the theme of Macedonia.<ref>{{harvp|Treadgold|1997|p=455}}</ref>

The interior of Macedonia remained in Slavic and later [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] hands until the [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|campaigns]] of [[Basil II]], which ended the existence of the Bulgarian state and extended Byzantine authority across the central and northern Balkans. Thereafter Macedonia remained under Byzantine control until the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1204). A short-lived  [[Latins (Middle Ages)|Latin]] [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]] was established which survived until 1224, when it was captured by [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]]. Most of Macedonia then came under the control of the [[Empire of Nicaea]] in 1246, although its northern regions remained disputed with the [[Medieval Serbia|Serbs]] and the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]]. Most of the region was conquered by the Serbs under [[Stephen Dushan]] during the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347]]. Only Thessalonica and its environs remained in Byzantine hands. By the late 14th century, the [[Ottoman Turks]] in turn had conquered the region, although Thessalonica held out under Byzantine and later [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] control [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430)|until 1430]].<ref>{{harvp|Kazhdan|1991|pp=1262, 2072–2073}}</ref>

The Ottomans did not keep Macedonia as an [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|administrative unit]]:<ref>The region was not called "Macedonia" by the Ottomans, and the name "Macedonia" gained currency together with the ascendance of rival nationalism.

The northern part was the Kosovo vilayet and then of [[Skopje]]; the [[Thessaloniki]] (south), and the [[Monastir Province, Ottoman Empire|Monastir Vilayet]] (western) were also created. This administrative division lasted until 1912–13, when Macedonia was divided among the Balkan states.<ref>{{harvp|Rossos|2008|p=67}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last = Miller |first= William |title= The Ottoman empire and its successors |location = Cambridge [Eng.] |publisher = The University Press |year = 1936 |pages=9, 447–49}}</ref>

=== Modern history ===
{{main|History of modern Macedonia}}
{{See also|Peoples Liberation War of Macedonia|National Liberation Front (Macedonia)}}

Since the early stages of the [[Greek Revolution]], the provisional government of Greece claimed Macedonia as part of Greek national territory, but the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)]], which established a Greek independent state, set its northern boundary between [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] and [[Volos]].<ref>{{cite book| first=John | last= Comstock| title= History of the Greek Revolution| url=https://archive.org/details/historyofgreekre00coms | location= New York |year= 1829|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofgreekre00coms/page/n12 5]|publisher=W. W. Reed & co}}</ref> When the [[Ottoman Empire]] started breaking apart, ''Macedonia'' was claimed by all members of the [[Balkan League]] ([[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], Greece and Bulgaria), and by [[Romania]]. Under the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] that ended the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78]] the entire region, except Thessaloniki, was included in the borders of [[Bulgaria]], but after the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 the region was returned to the Ottoman Empire. The armies of the Balkan League advanced and occupied ''Macedonia'' in the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912. Because of disagreements between the allies about the partition of the region, the [[Second Balkan War]] erupted, and in its aftermath the arbitrary region of Macedonia was split into the following entities, that existed or still exist in this region:
* [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] (as a region of Greece) refers to three [[modern regions of Greece|regions]] in [[northern Greece]], incorporated in 1913, as a result of the [[Balkan Wars]] between the Ottoman Empire and the [[Balkan League]].<ref>{{harvp|Poulton|2000|pp=85–86}}</ref>
* Macedonia (as a [[People's Republic]] within [[Yugoslavia]]) used to refer to the [[People's Republic of Macedonia]] established in 1946, later known as the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, one of the constituent republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], renamed in 1963.<ref name=LOC>{{loc}} {{cite web| url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/yutoc.html | title= The Library of Congress, Country Studies | website=Yugoslavia | accessdate = 17 July 2006 }}</ref> Between 1929 and 1941 this region was part of [[Vardar Banovina]] province in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

"The choice of the name Macedonia by FYROM directly raises the issue of usurpation of the cultural heritage of a neighbouring country. The name constitutes the basis for staking an exclusive rights claim over the entire geographical area of Macedonia. More specifically, to call only the Slavo-Macedonians Macedonians monopolizes the name for the Slavo-Macedonians and creates semiological confusion, whilst violating the human rights and the right to self-determination of Greek Macedonians. The use of the name by FYROM alone may also create problems in the trade area, and subsequently become a potential springboard for distorting reality, and a basis for activities far removed from the standards set by the European Union and more specifically the clause on good neighbourly relations.

== Geography ==
Macedonia (as a current geographical term) refers to a region of the Balkan peninsula in [[south-eastern Europe]], covering some 60,000 or 70,000 square kilometers. Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears to correspond to the basins of (from west to east) the [[Haliacmon]] (Aliákmonas), [[Vardar|Vardar / Axios]] and [[Struma River|Struma / Strymónas]] rivers, and the plains around Thessaloniki and Serres.{{#tag:ref|For an attempt to delineate the boundaries of the region, see Kontogiorgi (2006).<ref>{{cite book| last=Kontogiorgi |first=Elisabeth |title=Population Exchange in Greek Macedonia |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-927896-1 |pages=11–13 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |chapter=Macedonia 1870–1922&nbsp;– The Regional Context}}</ref>|group=Note}}

In a [[Historical regions of the Balkan Peninsula|historic context]], the term ''Macedonia'' was used in various ways. Macedonia was not an administrative division of the Ottoman Empire; its entire territory was part of the ''beylerbeylik'' of [[Rumelia]].<ref name="mccarthy1">{{cite book |first=Justin |last=McCarthy |authorlink=Justin McCarthy (American historian) |year=2001 |title=The Ottoman Peoples and the End of Empire |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-340-70657-2}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Rossos|2008|p=51}}</ref> The geographer H.&nbsp;R.

Many [[ethnographic]] maps were produced in this period of controversy; these differ primarily in the areas given to each nationality within Macedonia. This was in part a result of the choice of definition: an inhabitant of Macedonia might well have different nationalities depending on whether the basis of classification was [[religious denomination|denomination]], [[kinship and descent|descent]], [[language]], [[self-identification]] or personal choice. In addition, the Ottoman census, taken on the basis of [[religion]], was misquoted by all sides; descent, or "[[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]", was largely conjectural; inhabitants of Macedonia might speak a different language at the market and at home, and the same Slavic dialect might be called Serbian "with Bulgarian influences", Macedonian, or West-Bulgarian.{{#tag:ref|For the difficulties to determine the national divisions of the population through the Ottoman census, see Jelavich (1993).<ref>{{cite book| last=Jelavich|first=Barbara|title=History of the Balkans| chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofbalkans0000jela| chapter-url-access=registration|year=1993|isbn=978-0-521-27459-3|chapter=The end of Ottoman Rule in Europe|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofbalkans0000jela/page/91 91]|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> For the Ottoman census and surveys about the population of Macedonia between 1882–1906, see Shaw (1977).<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=Ezel Kural|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|year=1977|isbn=978-0-521-29166-8|chapter=The Rise of Modern Turkey|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofottoman00stan/page/208 208–209]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofottoman00stan/page/208}}</ref>|group=Note}}

These maps also differed somewhat in the boundaries given to Macedonia. Its only inarguable limits were the [[Aegean Sea]] and the Serbian and Bulgarian frontiers (as of 1885); where it bordered Old Serbia, Albania, and Thrace (all parts of Ottoman [[Rumelia]]) was debatable.<ref name="wilkinson"/>

The Greek ethnographer Nicolaides, the Austrian Meinhard, and the Bulgarian Kǎnčev placed the northern boundary of Macedonia at the [[Šar Mountain]]s and the [[Skopska Crna Gora|Crna hills]], as had scholars before 1878. The Serb Gopčevič preferred a line much further south, assigning the entire region from Skopje to [[Strumica]] to "Old Serbia"; and some later Greek geographers have defined a more restricted Macedonia. In addition, maps might vary in smaller details: as to whether this town or that was Macedonian. One Italian map included [[Prizren]], where Nicolaides and Meinhard had drawn the boundary just south of it. On the south and west, [[Grevena]], [[Korçë]], and [[Konitsa]] varied from map to map; on the east, the usual line is the lower [[Mesta River|Mesta / Nestos]] river and then north or northwest, but one German geographer takes the line so far west as to exclude [[Bansko]] and [[Gotse Delchev (town)|Nevrokop / Gotse Delchev]].<ref name="wilkinson"/>

The region of Macedonia is commonly divided into three major and two minor sub-regions.<ref name="Danforth_44">{{harvp|Danforth|1995|p=44}}</ref> The name ''Macedonia'' appears under certain contexts on the major regions, while the smaller ones are traditionally referred to by other local [[toponyms]]:

==== Major regions ====
The region of Macedonia is commonly split geographically into three main sub-regions, especially when discussing the Macedonian Question. The terms are used in non-partisan scholarly works, although they are also used in [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] literature of an [[irredentist]] nature.<ref name= mymk>{{cite web |url=http://www.mymacedonia.net/aegean/aegean.htm |title=Aegean Part of Macedonia |publisher=MyMacedonia.net |accessdate=22 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204103011/http://www.mymacedonia.net/aegean/aegean.htm |archive-date=4 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

It reports [[Josip Broz Tito]] using the term "Aegean Macedonia" on 11 October 1945 in the buildup to the Greek Civil War; the original document is archived in 'GFM A/24581/G2/1945'. For Athens, the "new term, Aegean Macedonia", (also ''"Pirin Macedonia"''), was introduced by Yugoslavs. Contextually, this observation indicates this was part of the Yugoslav offensive against Greece, laying claim to Greek Macedonia, but Athens does not take issue with the term itself.

==== Minor regions ====
In addition to the above named sub-regions, there are also three smaller regions, in [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Serbia]] respectively. These regions are also considered geographically part of Macedonia. They are referred to by ethnic Macedonians as follows,<ref name= mymk /> but typically are not so referred to by non-partisan scholars.<ref>E.g., see {{harvp|Poulton|2000|p=146}}; {{harvp|Rossos|2008|p=2}}: "Albania received the relatively small areas of Mala Prespa and Golo Brdo."</ref>

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographic history of Macedonia}}

The region, as defined above, has a total population of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self-identify as ''Macedonian'' on a national level, while the Greek Macedonians self-identify as both ''Macedonian'' on a regional, and ''Greek'' on a national level. According to the Greek arguments, the ancient Macedonians' nationality was Greek and thus, the use of the term on a national level lays claims to their history. This disambiguation problem has led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the [[#Terminology by group|terminology by group]] section.

{{See also|Political views on the Macedonian language}}

As language is one of the elements tied in with national identity, the same disputes that are voiced over demographics are also found in linguistics. There are two main disputes about the use of the word Macedonian to describe a linguistic phenomenon, be it a language or a dialect:

Modern [[Macedonian language]],<ref name=offensive3 group=Note/> a [[South Slavic languages|south Slavic]] language, is not closely related to the Ancient Macedonian language.

== Politics ==
{{See also|Macedonia naming dispute}}

The controversies in geographic, linguistic and demographic terms, are also manifested in international politics. Among the autonomous countries that were formed as a result of the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s, was the (until then) subnational entity of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], by the official name of "Socialist Republic of Macedonia", the others being Serbia, [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Montenegro]]. The peaceful break-away of that nation resulted in the change of its name to "Republic of Macedonia".

[[Loring Danforth]], a professor of anthropology at [[Bates College]], asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate Macedonian position, publicly endorsed by [[Kiro Gligorov]], the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great, but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. They thus emphasize that the Macedonian language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] in the ninth century.<ref name="Danforth_gate">{{cite book | title=How can a woman give birth to one Greek and one Macedonian? | url=http://www.gate.net/~mango/How_can_a_woman_give_birth.htm | work=The construction of national identity among immigrants to Australia from Northern Greece | first=Loring M. | last=Danforth | accessdate=26 December 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602120005/http://www.gate.net/~mango/How_can_a_woman_give_birth.htm | archive-date=2 June 2007 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Although ethnic Macedonians agree Macedonian minorities exist in Bulgaria and Greece and these minorities have been subjected to harsh policies of forced assimilation, there are two different positions with regard to what their future should be. These were summarized by Danforth:<ref name="Danforth_gate"/>{{#tag:ref|Most quotations within the text are from [[Evangelos Kofos]]: "Most precious jewels" from a [[Boston Globe]] article of 5 January 1993, the others from ''Nationalism and communism'', Thessalonica, 1964.|group=Note}}

{{blockquote|The goal of more extreme Macedonian nationalists is to create a "free, united, and independent Macedonia" by "liberating" the parts of Macedonia "temporarily occupied" by Bulgaria and Greece. More moderate Macedonian nationalists recognize the inviolability of the Bulgarian and Greek borders and explicitly renounce any territorial claims against the two countries. They do, however, demand that Bulgaria and Greece recognize the existence of Macedonian minorities in their countries and grant them the basic human rights they deserve.}}

=== Greek nationalism ===
{{See also|Greek nationalism}}

Danforth describes the Greek position on Macedonia as follows: because Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians were Greeks, and because ancient and modern Greece are bound in an unbroken line of racial and cultural continuity, it is only Greeks who have the right to identify themselves as Macedonians. According to Danforth, this is why Greeks generally refer to Ethnic Macedonians as "Skopians", a practice comparable to calling Greeks "Athenians". Danforth asserts that the negation of Macedonian identity in Greek nationalist ideology focuses on three main points: the existence of a Macedonian nation, a Macedonian language, and a Macedonian minority in Greece. More specifically, Danforth says:<ref name="Danforth_gate"/>

{{blockquote|From the Greek nationalist perspective there cannot be a Macedonian nation since there has never been an independent Macedonian state: the Macedonian nation is an "artificial creation", an "invention", of Tito, who "baptized" a "mosaic of nationalities" with the Greek name "Macedonians". Similarly Greek nationalists claim that because the language spoken by the ancient Macedonians was Greek, the Slavic language spoken by the "Skopians" cannot be called "the Macedonian language." Greek sources generally refer to it as "the linguistic idiom of Skopje" and describe it as a corrupt and impoverished dialect of Bulgarian. Finally, the Greek government denies the existence of a Macedonian minority in northern Greece, claiming that there exists only a small group of "Slavophone Hellenes" or "bilingual Greeks", who speak Greek and "a local Slavic dialect" but have a "Greek national consciousness".}}

Thus from the Greek nationalist perspective the use of the term "Macedonian" by the "Slavs of Skopje" constitutes a "felony", an "act of plagiarism" against the Greek people. Greek nationalists believe that, by calling themselves "Macedonians", the ethnic Macedonians are "stealing" a Greek name, "embezzling" Greek cultural heritage, and "falsifying" Greek history.{{#tag:ref|Danforth quotes Kofos, telling a foreign reporter, "It is as if a robber came into my house and stole my most precious jewels—my history, my culture, my identity."<ref name="Danforth_gate"/>|group=Note}} Greek fears that the use of the name "Macedonia" by the ethnic Macedonians will inevitably lead to the assertion of irredentist claims to territory in Greek Macedonia are heightened by fairly recent historical events.{{#tag:ref|"During World War II Bulgaria occupied portions of northern Greece, while one of the specific goals of the founders of the People's Republic of Macedonia in 1944 was "the unification of the entire Macedonian nation", to be achieved by "the liberation of the other two segments" of Macedonia."<ref name="Danforth_gate"/>|group=Note}}

From a different point of view, Demetrius Andreas M.-A. Floudas, of [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge]], a leading commentator on the naming dispute from the Greek side, sums up this nationalistic reaction as follows: the Republic of Macedonia was accused of usurping the historical and cultural patrimony of Greece "in order to furnish a nucleus of national self-esteem for the new state and provide its citizens with a new, distinct, non-Bulgarian, non-Serbian, non-Albanian identity".<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330524708|title="'Macedonia Nostra'" (PDF).|last=Floudas|first=Demetrius Andreas|website=ResearchGate -- LSE Conference Paper; Greece: Prospects for Modernisation, London, 1994.}}</ref> The Republic emerged thus to Greek eyes as a country with a personality crisis, "a nondescript parasitic state"<ref name=":0" /> that lived off the history of its neighbours, because it allegedly lacked an illustrious past of its own, for the sake of achieving cohesion for what Greeks regarded as an "unhomogeneous little new nation".<ref name=":1" />

Although generally supportive of the Greek position, Floudas criticises some elements of the Greek stance as follows:<ref name=":2">{{cite journal|last=Floudas|first=Demetrius Andreas|journal=Journal of Political and Military Sociology|volume=24|page=285|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/11160801/name-conflict-conflict-name-analysis-greeces-dispute-fyrom|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031090521/http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/11160801/name-conflict-conflict-name-analysis-greeces-dispute-fyrom|url-status=dead|archive-date=31 October 2014|title=A Name for a Conflict or a Conflict for a Name?

{{blockquote|What appeared to go unquestioned in Greece nevertheless was whether there was indeed substance in the claims of FYROM that their citizens do feel members of a distinct 'Macedonian' nationality. To answer this appropriately, neither the decades of persistent indoctrination [during Tito's time] should be left out of consideration, nor Greece's violent struggle since 1991 in contrast to her complacency for the 45 years before this. If it was a common bond that the people in Skopje wanted, they found it by claiming this name and rallying the whole population in a united resistance front under a common cause against pugnacious Greece. After this bitter and protracted struggle, even the ones in FYROM who might have not initially been infused with any distinct Macedonian ethnic identity must be feeling very Macedonian now, thanks to Greece}}

As of early 2008, the official position of Greece, adopted unanimously by the four largest political parties, has made a more moderate shift towards accepting a "composite name solution" (i.e. the use of the name "Macedonia" plus some qualifier), so as to disambiguate the former Yugoslav Republic from the Greek region of Macedonia and the wider geographic region of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/South-Eastern+Europe/Balkans/Bilateral+Relations/FYROM/FYROM+-+THE+NAME+ISSUE.htm |publisher=Hellenic Republic, Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=17 July 2006 |title=Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)&nbsp;— The Name Issue |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708044400/http://www2.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic%2BRegions/South-Eastern%2BEurope/Balkans/Bilateral%2BRelations/FYROM/FYROM%2B-%2BTHE%2BNAME%2BISSUE.htm |archivedate=8 July 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Skai News|url=http://www.skai.gr/master_story.php?id=74004|title=KKE about Kosovo&nbsp;— FYROM|language=Greek|accessdate=3 June 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002044531/http://www.skai.gr/master_story.php?id=74004|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Terminology by group ==
All these controversies have led ethnic groups in Macedonia to use terms in conflicting ways. Despite the fact that these terms may not always be used in a [[pejorative]] way, they may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from ''Macedonia'' to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.

Bulgarians and ethnic Macedonians seek to deny the self-identification of the [[Slavic-speakers of Greek Macedonia|Slavic speaking minority]] in northern Greece, which mostly self-identifies as Greek.<ref>{{harvp|Shea|1997|p=125}}</ref>

Certain terms are in use by these groups as outlined below. Any denial of self-identification by any side, or any attribution of Macedonia related terms by third parties to the other side, can be seen as highly offensive. General usage of these terms follows:

=== Bulgarian ===
* '''[[Grecomans|Gărkomani]]''' (Гъркомани) is a derogatory term used to refer to the largest portion of the Slavic-speaking minority of Macedonia in Greece who self-identify as Greeks.
* '''[[Macedonian Bulgarians|Macedonian]]''' (Македонец) is a person originating from the region of Macedonia&nbsp;– the term has only regional, not ethnic meaning, and it usually means a Bulgarian, or a clarification is made (Greek, Albanian...).
* '''[[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]''' (Македонски) and the [[Slavic language (Greece)|Slavic dialects of Greece]] are considered dialects of Bulgarian by Bulgarian linguists; not independent languages or dialects of other languages (e.g. Serbian). This is also the popular view in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government, therefore, has officially recognized the language merely as "the constitutional language of the Republic of Macedonia".<ref name=bcb /><ref name= BulLang>{{cite press release | title = Article: Bulgaria Recognizes Macedonian Language | publisher = AIMpress Sofia&nbsp;– Skopje | date = 22 February 2006| url = http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199902/90222-005-trae-sof.htm | accessdate = 25 July 2006}}</ref> Translations are officially called "adaptations".
* '''[[Macedonism]]''' (Македонизъм) is the political ideology or simply views that the Slavs of Macedonia are an ethnic group separate from Bulgarians, with their own separate language, history and culture. It is also used to describe what Bulgarians view as the falsification of their history whether by Macedonian or foreign scholars who subscribe to the Macedonist point of view. It carries strong negative connotations.<ref name=macedonism>{{cite journal |last=Rychlík |first=Jan |year=2007|title=The Consciousness of the Slavonic Orthodox Population in Pirin Macedonia and the Identity of the Population of Moravia and Moravian Slovakia |journal=Sprawy Narodowościowe |volume= |issue=31 |pages=183–197 |id= |url=http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=e89e2e39-164b-4bd4-9632-b0ebc2cce969&articleId=1eebae8c-34b9-42a4-8537-3089639fb54c |accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref>
* '''[[Macedonistics]]''' (Македонистика) is a term, generally synonymous with disciplines such as study of the origins of the Macedonian language and history of the Macedonian people conducted in the Republic of Macedonia and in former Yugoslavia. It is generally considered in Bulgaria to be a kind of [[pseudoscience]].
* '''[[Macedonism|Macedonist]]''' (Македонист) is a person (typically Macedonian Slav) who believes that Macedonian Slavs are not ethnic Bulgarians but a separate ethnic group, directly descended from the ancient Macedonians. It is a more negatively charged synonym of "Macedonian nationalist". More rarely it is used for someone associated with the study of the origins of the Macedonian language and history of the Macedonian people (not necessarily from the Republic of Macedonia or Yugoslavia), whose studies support the official historical doctrine of the Republic of Macedonia or former Yugoslavia.<ref name=macedonism />
* '''[[Serbomans|Sărbomani]]''' (Сърбомани) is a derogatory term used to refer to people in the Republic of Macedonia self-identifying as Serbian, or having a pro-Serb orientation. It is also used pejoratively by Bulgarians to refer to Macedonians who refuse the Bulgarian national idea.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=P-1m1FLtrvsC&pg=PA226&dq=serbomans&hl=bg&ei=2BbjTuPEPImf-Qb79aXrBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=serbomans&f=false Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Chris Kostov, Peter Lang, 2010, p. 226.], {{ISBN|3-0343-0196-0}}</ref>
* '''[[Old Bulgarian]]''' (Старобългарски) is the name Bulgarians give to the [[Old Church Slavonic language]] used in the [[Ohrid Literary School]] among others. In contrast, Old Church Slavonic is rarely referred to by ethnic Macedonians as "Old Macedonian" or "Old Slavic".<ref name= OldChurchSlav>{{harvp|Shea|1997|p=198}}</ref>
