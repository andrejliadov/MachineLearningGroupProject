The '''Artists Authorship Rights Act''' is a 1984 New York law that provides legal protection for artists' [[moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]].

The law was in part a reaction to California's passage of the [[California Art Preservation Act]], however the New York Act provided for artists the right to disavow works that were altered against their wishes.

The Act was preempted by the similar federal [[Visual Artists Rights Act]] of 1990 (VARA), as held in Board of Managers of Soho Int'l Arts Condominium v. City of New York (S.D.N.Y. 2003).
