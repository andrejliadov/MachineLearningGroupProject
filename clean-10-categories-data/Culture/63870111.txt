== Biography ==
Armengol was born in the old quarter of Andorra la Vella, the capital city of [[Andorra]] (a landlocked [[microstate]] in the [[Pyrenees]] mountains). She attended primary classes in a French school there and then went to the [[University of Perpignan]] in nearby [[France]], where she continued her education at the Lycée [[Jean Lurçat]]. She graduated from the Spanish section of Letters in 1971. The following year she obtained her master's degree (Maîtrise d'Enseignement) at the same university.<ref name=":0" /> In 1978, she received the Diploma of Advanced Studies (DEA) in the specialty of Andorran Studies at the University of Perpignan. In 1984, she took a course in historical demography at the École d'Hautes Études de Sciencies in [[Paris|Paris, France]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=La Tribuna - Lídia Armengol i Vila|url=https://www.elperiodic.ad/opinio/article/25002/lidia-armengol-i-vila|website=El Periòdic d'Andorra|language=ca|access-date=2020-05-05}}</ref>

=== Government service ===
According to writer Antoni Pol, "Her contribution has been twofold, in two dimensions, politics and culture."<ref name=":0" />

Armengol was a promoter of the "Andorranization Program," which she proposed in 1970 when she was about 22 years of age.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Oriol|first=Carme|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttC-DwAAQBAJ&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA221&dq=L%C3%ADdia+Armengol&hl=en|title=A History of Catalan Folk Literature|last2=Samper|first2=Emili|date=2019-12-11|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=978-90-272-6185-4|pages=221|language=en}}</ref> The program became the basis of the country's public school system which, in turn, led to widespread culture awareness.<ref name=":1" /><blockquote>"These were years in which the institutionalisation of culture was framed as part of a process of reform directed at the country's political institutions, resulting, twenty years later in a constituent process and the passing of the Constitution of 14 March 1993, making Andorra an independent state that followed the rule of law and enjoyed a social welfare system."<ref name=":1" /> </blockquote>On 1 March 1973, she was appointed co-head of the country's Pedagogical Department, with [[Antoni Morell Mora|Antoni Morell i Mora]], and was later appointed General Secretary of the Department of Social Affairs, eventually heading the Department of Education, Culture and Sports.<ref name=":1" />
[[File:Location Andorra Europe.png|thumb|251x251px|Location of Andorra (green dot) in the mountains between southern France and northern Spain.]]
She helped organize the teaching of the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] language, Andorran geography and history, and the establishment of Andorran institutions near the centers of Spanish and French education in the country, creating the Andorran Training program.<ref name=":0" />

In 1975 she created the [[Andorra National Library|National Library of Andorra]] and then the [[National archives|National Archives]]. Then, a year later, the General Counsel created the Institute of Andorran Studies and put Armengol in its leadership position.<ref name=":1" /> The Institute's aim was,<blockquote>"to promote the historical research and the dissemination of scientific knowledge. The person put in charge of the new institute's organization of historical and cultural knowledge was the historian Lidia Armengol. ... Armengol published collections of key materials for research and prepared historical overviews that laid the groundwork for writing the history of the country and encourage young people to take an interest in their roots and in their own language and culture. The mythologised history of this Pyrenean enclave began to give way to a rigorous and critical historical account within a framework that generated many more studies, which were also aimed at the internationalisation of knowledge on Andorra."<ref name=":1" /></blockquote>During the government of prime minister [[Òscar Ribas Reig]] (1982 –1984), Armengol was appointed Director of Culture and Fine Arts. When the next government took over, the new prime minister, [[Josep Pintat-Solans|Josep Pintat i Solans]], appointed her to the position of General Secretary of the Ministry of Education and Culture. In 1990, when Ribas returned to the top government post, she was appointed Deputy Secretary General of the Presidency.<ref name=":0" />

=== Historical research ===
In parallel with her political work, she continued her historical research, publishing numerous works about her country's Catalan  language and culture. She was awarded the 1987 Principality of Andorra Prize, for ''Social Behaviors and Collective Mentalities: the Andorran ecclesiastical legacies of the 19th century.''<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Lídia Armengol Vila died yesterday morning after a long illness|date=27 November 1991|title=Obituary|page=8|work=Diari d'Andorra}}</ref>
