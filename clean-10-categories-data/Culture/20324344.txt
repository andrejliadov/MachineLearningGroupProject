}} "The colours represent creative energy, and the layers of the tower imply that a conlang is built piece by piece, never completed. The tower itself also alludes to the Tower of Babel, as it has long been a tradition to demonstrate a constructed language by translating the Babel legend. The Conlang flag was decided on by a vote between many competing designs, and one of my own contributions to the conlanging world is that I was the person who facilitated this election. The winning design was drawn by Christian Thalmann, who introduced the layers. The idea of including the Tower of Babel on the flag had been introduced by Jan van Steenbergen, and the idea of placing the sun on the horizon behind it by Leland Paul. The idea of having the rising sun on the flag had been introduced by David Peterson, who saw it as representing the rise of conlanging from obscurity to popularity and notoriety."</ref>]]

A '''constructed language''' (sometimes called a '''conlang''')<ref>Artificial languages are informally called ''conlangs'' (constructed languages), and the study of artificial languages and related matters is ''[[interlinguistics]]''.</ref> is a [[language]] whose [[phonology]], [[grammar]], and [[vocabulary]], instead of having developed [[natural language|naturally]], are consciously devised. Constructed languages may also be referred to as '''artificial languages''', '''planned languages''' or '''invented languages'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Ishtar for Belgium to Belgrade |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=554&_t=ishtar_for_belgium_to_belgrade |publisher= European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref> and in some cases, [[fictional language|fictional languages]]. Planned languages are languages that have been purposefully designed. They are the result of deliberate controlling intervention, thus of a form of language planning.<ref>Klaus Schubert, ''Designed Languages for Communicative Needs within and between Language Communities'', in: [https://www.onb.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF_Download/ESP_abstracts.pdf Planned languages and language planning] (PDF), Austrian National Library, 2019</ref> 

There are many possible reasons to create a constructed language, such as to ease human [[communication]] (see [[international auxiliary language]] and [[code]]); to give [[fiction]] or an associated constructed setting an added layer of realism; for experimentation in the fields of [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], and [[machine learning]]; for [[artistic language|artistic creation]]; and for [[language game]]s. Some people make constructed languages simply because they like doing it.

The expression ''planned language'' is sometimes used to indicate international auxiliary languages and other languages designed for actual use in human communication. Some prefer it to the adjective ''artificial'', as this term may be perceived as pejorative. Outside [[Esperanto culture]], the term [[language planning]] means the prescriptions given to a natural language to standardize it; in this regard, even a "natural language" may be artificial in some respects, meaning some of its words have been crafted by conscious decision. [[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptive grammar]]s, which date to ancient times for classical languages such as Latin and Sanskrit, are rule-based codifications of natural languages, such codifications being a middle ground between naïve natural selection and development of language and its explicit construction. The term ''glossopoeia'' <!--, coined by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], {see talk page; can anyone cite a use by Tolkien? Sarah Higley uses the word but does not attribute its coinage to him.}--> is also used to mean language construction, particularly construction of [[artistic language]]s.<ref name="higley2007">Sarah L. Higley: ''Hildegard of Bingen's Unknown Language''.  Palgrave Macmillan, 2007.</ref>

Conlang speakers are rare. For example, the Hungarian census of 2011 found 8397 speakers of [[Esperanto]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ksh.hu/nepszamlalas/tables_regional_00|title=Hungarian Central Statistical Office|website=www.ksh.hu|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> and the census of 2001 found 10 of [[Romanid]], two each of [[Interlingua]] and [[Ido]] and one each of [[Idiom Neutral]] and [[Mundolinco]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nepszamlalas2001.hu/hun/kotetek/18/tables/load2_39_1.html|title=18.

Ne malpli ol 992 - La Ondo de Esperanto|date=Dec 18, 2011}}</ref>

==Planned, constructed, artificial==
The terms "planned", "constructed", and "artificial" are used differently in some traditions. For example, few speakers of [[Interlingua]] consider their language artificial, since they assert that it has no invented content: Interlingua's vocabulary is taken from a small set of natural languages, and its grammar is based closely on these source languages, even including some degree of irregularity; its proponents prefer to describe its vocabulary and grammar as standardized rather than artificial or constructed. Similarly, [[Latino sine flexione]] (LsF) is a simplification of Latin from which the [[inflection]]s have been removed. As with Interlingua, some prefer to describe its development as "planning" rather than "constructing". Some speakers of [[Esperanto]] and [[Esperantido]]s also avoid the term "artificial language" because they deny that there is anything "unnatural" about the use of their language in human communication.

By contrast, some philosophers have argued that all human languages are conventional or artificial. [[François Rabelais]]'s fictional giant Pantagruel, for instance, said: "<abbr title="C'est abus dire que ayons langaige naturel; les langaiges sont par institution arbitraires et convenances des peuples: les voix, comme disent les dialecticiens, ne signifient naturellement, mais à plaisir.">It is a misuse of terms to say that we have natural language; languages ''are'' through arbitrary institutions and the conventions of peoples: voices, as the dialecticians say, don't signify naturally, but capriciously.</abbr>"<ref>[[François Rabelais]], Œvres complètes, III, 19 (Paris: Seuil, 1973). Also cited in Claude Piron, ''Le Defi des Langues'' (L'Harmattan, 1994) {{ISBN|2-7384-2432-5}}.</ref>

Furthermore, fictional or experimental languages can be considered ''naturalistic'' if they model real world languages. For example, if a naturalistic conlang is derived ''a posteriori'' from another language (real or constructed), it should imitate natural processes of [[phonology|phonological]], lexical, and [[grammar|grammatical]] change. In contrast with languages such as Interlingua, naturalistic fictional languages are not usually intended for easy learning or communication. Thus, naturalistic fictional languages tend to be more difficult and complex. While Interlingua has simpler grammar, syntax, and orthography than its source languages (though more complex and irregular than Esperanto or its descendants), naturalistic fictional languages typically mimic behaviors of natural languages like [[irregular verbs]] and nouns, and complicated phonological processes.

==Overview==

In terms of purpose, most constructed languages can broadly be divided into:

*''[[Engineered language]]s'' (''engelangs'' {{IPA|/ˈɛnd͡ʒlæŋz/}}), further subdivided into logical languages (''loglangs''), [[philosophical language]]s and [[experimental language]]s; devised for the purpose of experimentation in [[logic]], [[philosophy]], or [[linguistics]];<ref name=":0" />
*''[[International auxiliary language|Auxiliary language]]s'' (''auxlangs'') devised for international communication (also IALs, for International Auxiliary Language);<ref name=":0" />
*''[[Artistic language]]s'' (''artlangs'') devised to create aesthetic pleasure or humorous effect, ''just for fun''; usually secret languages and mystical languages are classified as artlangs.<ref name=":0" />

The boundaries between these categories are by no means clear.<ref>[http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Glosso/Glossopoeia.html The "Conlang Triangle"] by Raymond Brown.  Accessed 8 August 2008</ref> A constructed language could easily fall into more than one of the above categories. A logical language created for [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] reasons would also be classifiable as an artistic language, which might be created by someone with philosophical motives intending for said conlang to be used as an auxiliary language. There are no rules, either inherent in the process of language construction or externally imposed, that would limit a constructed language to fitting only one of the above categories.

A constructed language can have native speakers if young children learn it from parents who speak it fluently. According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are "200–2000 [[native Esperanto speakers|who speak Esperanto as a first language]]". A member of the [[Klingon Language Institute]], [[d'Armond Speers]], attempted to raise his son as a native (bilingual with English) [[Klingon language|Klingon]] speaker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/1999/08/hollywood-at-war-the-sequel/|title=Hollywood at War: The Sequel|first=James Der|last=Derian|date=Aug 1, 1999|via=www.wired.com}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=March 2018}}

As soon as a constructed language has a community of fluent speakers, especially if it has numerous native speakers, it begins to evolve and hence loses its constructed status. For example, [[Modern Hebrew]] and its pronunciation norms were developed from existing traditions of [[Hebrew]], such as [[Mishnaic Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Hebrew]] following a general [[Sephardic]] pronunciation, rather than engineered from scratch, and has undergone considerable changes since the state of [[Israel]] was founded in 1948 (Hetzron 1990:693). However, linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] argues that Modern Hebrew, which he terms "Israeli", is a Semito-European hybrid based not only on Hebrew but also on [[Yiddish]] and other languages spoken by revivalists.<ref>[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns], Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Journal of Language Contact, Varia 2, pp. 40-67 (2009).</ref> Zuckermann therefore endorses the translation of the Hebrew Bible into what he calls "Israeli".<ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212397385&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Let my people know!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916161700/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1242212397385&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |date=2011-09-16 }}, Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Jerusalem Post, May 18, 2009.</ref> [[Esperanto]] as a living spoken language has evolved significantly from the prescriptive blueprint published in 1887, so that modern editions of the ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', a 1903 collection of early texts in the language, require many footnotes on the syntactic and lexical differences between early and modern Esperanto.<ref>''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', ed. L. L. Zamenhof, 1903; 18th edition with footnotes by Gaston Waringhien, UEA 1992.</ref>

Proponents of constructed languages often have many reasons for using them. The famous but disputed [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is sometimes cited; this claims that the language one speaks influences the way one thinks. Thus, a "better" language should allow the speaker to think more clearly or intelligently or to encompass more points of view; this was the intention of [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] in creating [[Láadan]], a feminist language<ref name="foer-2012" /> embodied in her [[feminist science fiction]] series ''[[Native Tongue (Suzette Haden Elgin novel)|Native Tongue]]''.<ref>"My hypothesis was that if I constructed a language designed specifically to provide a more adequate mechanism for expressing women's perceptions, women would (a) embrace it and begin using it, or (b) embrace the idea but not the language, say "Elgin, you've got it all wrong!" and construct some other "women's language" to replace it."  {{cite web|title=Interview With Suzette Haden Elgin |last=Glatzer |first=Jenna |url=http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/suzette_haden_elgin.htm |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612005757/http://www.absolutewrite.com/novels/suzette_haden_elgin.htm |archive-date=2007-06-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A constructed language could also be used to ''restrict'' thought, as in [[George Orwell]]'s [[Newspeak]], or to ''simplify'' thought, as in [[Toki Pona]]. In contrast, linguists such as [[Steven Pinker]] argue that ideas exist independently of language. For example, in the book ''[[The Language Instinct]]'', Pinker states that children spontaneously re-invent slang and even grammar with each generation. These linguists argue that attempts to control the range of human thought through the reform of language would fail, as concepts like "freedom" will reappear in new words if the old words vanish.

Proponents claim a particular language makes it easier to express and understand concepts in one area, and more difficult in others. An example can be taken from the way various [[programming language]]s make it easier to write certain kinds of programs and harder to write others.

Another reason cited for using a constructed language is the telescope rule, which claims that it takes less time to first learn a simple constructed language and then a natural language, than to learn only a natural language. Thus, if someone wants to learn English, some suggest learning [[Basic English]] first. Constructed languages like Esperanto and Interlingua are in fact often simpler due to the typical lack of [[regular and irregular verbs|irregular verbs]] and other grammatical quirks. Some studies have found that learning Esperanto helps in learning a non-constructed language later (see [[propaedeutic value of Esperanto]]).

[[Codes for constructed languages]] include the [[ISO 639-2]] "<tt>[[Codes for constructed languages|art]]</tt>" for conlangs; however, some constructed languages have their own [[ISO 639]] language codes (e.g. "<tt>eo</tt>" and "<tt>epo</tt>" for [[Esperanto]], "jbo" for [[Lojban]], "<tt>ia</tt>" and "<tt>ina</tt>" for [[Interlingua]], "<tt>tlh</tt>" for [[Klingon language|Klingon]], and "<tt>io</tt>" and "<tt>ido</tt>" for [[Ido]]).

One constraint on a constructed language is that if it was constructed to be a natural language for use by fictional foreigners or aliens, as with [[Dothraki language|Dothraki]] and [[High Valyrian]] in the ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' series, which was adapted from the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' book series, the language should be easily pronounced by actors, and should fit with and incorporate any fragments of the language already invented by the book's author, and preferably also fit with any personal names of fictional speakers of the language.

==''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' languages==

An ''a priori'' constructed language is one whose features (including vocabulary, grammar, etc.) are not based on an existing language, and an ''a posteriori'' language is the opposite.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=David|title=The Art of Language Invention|date=2015|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0143126461|edition=1st|pages=21-22}}</ref> This categorization, however, is not absolute, as many constructed languages may be called ''a priori'' when considering some linguistic factors, and at the same time ''a posteriori'' when considering other factors.

===''A priori'' language===

An ''a priori'' language (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''a priori'', "from the former") is any constructed language of which all or a number of features are not based on existing languages, but rather invented or elaborated as to work in a different way or to allude different purposes. Some ''a priori'' languages are designed to be [[international auxiliary language]]s that remove what could be considered an unfair learning advantage for native speakers of a source language that would otherwise exist for ''a posteriori'' languages. Others, known as [[philosophical language|philosophical]] or [[taxonomic languages]], try to categorize their vocabulary, either to express an underlying philosophy or to make it easier to recognize new vocabulary. Finally, many [[artistic languages]], created for either personal use or for use in a fictional medium, employ consciously constructed grammars and vocabularies, and are best understood as ''a priori''.

* [[Klingon language|Klingon]] from the science-fiction franchise ''[[Star Trek]]''
* [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|The languages created]] by fantasy writer [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]

===''A posteriori'' language===
An '''''a posteriori'' language''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''a posteriori'', "from the latter"), according to [[Louis Couturat]], is any constructed language whose elements are borrowed from or based on existing languages. The term can also be extended to [[controlled language|controlled versions]] of natural languages, and is most commonly used to refer to vocabulary despite other features. Likewise, [[zonal constructed languages]] (auxiliary languages for speakers of a particular language family) are a posteriori by definition. 

While most auxiliary languages are ''a posteriori'' due to their intended function as a medium of communication, many [[artistic languages]] are fully a posteriori in design—many for the purposes of [[alternate history]]. In distinguishing whether the language is ''a priori'' or ''a posteriori'', the prevalence and distribution of respectable traits is often the key.

==History==

===Ancient linguistic experiments===
Grammatical speculation dates from [[Classical Antiquity]], appearing for instance in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' in Hermogenes's contention that words are not inherently linked to what they refer to; that people apply "a piece of their own voice... to the thing". [[Athenaeus]] of Naucratis, in Book III of ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', tells the story of two figures: Dionysius of Sicily and Alexarchus. Dionysius of Sicily created [[neologism]]s like ''menandros'' "virgin" (from ''menei'' "waiting" and ''andra'' "husband"), ''menekratēs'' "pillar" (from ''menei'' "it remains in one place" and ''kratei'' "it is strong"), and ''ballantion'' "javelin" (from ''balletai enantion'' "thrown against someone"). Incidentally, the more common Greek words for those three are ''parthenos'', ''stulos'', and ''akon''. [[Alexarchus of Macedon]], the brother of King Cassander of Macedon, was the founder of the city of Ouranopolis. Athenaeus recounts a story told by Heracleides of Lembos that Alexarchus "introduced a peculiar vocabulary, referring to a rooster as a "dawn-crier," a barber as a "mortal-shaver," a drachma as "worked silver"...and a herald as an ''aputēs'' [from ''ēputa'' "loud-voiced"]. "He once wrote something... to the public authorities in Casandreia...As for what this letter says, in my opinion not even the [[Apollo|Pythian god]] could make sense of it." While the mechanisms of grammar suggested by classical philosophers were designed to explain existing languages ([[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit]]), they were not used to construct new grammars. Roughly contemporary to Plato, in his descriptive grammar of Sanskrit, [[Pāṇini]] constructed a set of rules for explaining language, so that the text of his grammar may be considered a mixture of natural and constructed language.

===Early constructed languages===
[[File:68r.jpg|thumb|Page 68r of the [[Voynich manuscript]]. This three-page foldout from the manuscript includes a chart that appears astronomical.]]

A legend recorded in the seventh-century [[Irish language|Irish]] work [[Auraicept na n-Éces]] claims that [[Fénius Farsaid]] visited [[Shinar]] after the [[confusion of tongues]], and he and his scholars studied the various languages for ten years, taking the best features of each to create ''in Bérla tóbaide'' ("the selected language"), which he named [[Old Irish|''Goídelc'']]—the Irish language. This appears to be the first mention of the concept of a constructed language in literature.

The earliest non-natural languages were considered less "constructed" than "super-natural", mystical, or divinely inspired. The [[Lingua Ignota]], recorded in the 12th century by St. [[Hildegard of Bingen]] is an example, and apparently the first entirely artificial language.<ref name="foer-2012">Joshua Foer, [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/24/121224fa_fact_foer "John Quijada and Ithkuil, the Language He Invented"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Dec. 24, 2012.</ref> It is a form of private mystical [[cant (language)|cant]] (see also [[Enochian|language of angels]]). An important example from Middle-Eastern culture is [[Balaibalan]], invented in the 16th century.<ref name="higley2007"/> [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] grammatical speculation was directed at recovering the original language spoken by [[Adam and Eve]] in [[Paradise]], lost in the [[confusion of tongues]]. The first [[Christians|Christian]] project for an ideal language is outlined in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', where he searches for the ideal [[Italian language|Italian]] vernacular suited for literature. [[Ramon Llull]]'s ''[[Ramon Llull#Llull's_Art_(Ars_Magna)|Ars Magna]]'' was a project of a perfect language with which the infidels could be convinced of the truth of the Christian faith. It was basically an application of [[combinatorics]] on a given set of concepts.{{Vague|date=October 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} During [[the Renaissance]], Lullian and Kabbalistic ideas were drawn upon in a magical context, resulting in [[cryptography|cryptographic]] applications. The [[Voynich manuscript]] may be an example of this.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Perfecting language===
Renaissance interest in [[Ancient Egypt]], notably the discovery of the ''[[Hieroglyphica]]'' of [[Horapollo]], and first encounters with the [[Chinese script]] directed efforts towards a perfect written language. [[Johannes Trithemius]], in ''Steganographia'' and ''Polygraphia'', attempted to show how all languages can be reduced to one. In the 17th century, interest in [[Magical thinking|magical]] languages was continued by the [[Rosicrucians]] and [[Alchemy|Alchemists]] (like [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and his [[Enochian]]). [[Jakob Boehme]] in 1623 spoke of a "natural language" (''Natursprache'') of the senses.

[[Musical language]]s from the Renaissance were tied up with [[mysticism]], magic and [[alchemy]], sometimes also referred to as the [[language of the birds]]. The [[Solresol]] project of 1817 re-invented the concept in a more pragmatic context.

===17th and 18th century: advent of philosophical languages===
The 17th century saw the rise of projects for "philosophical" or "a priori" languages, such as:

*[[Francis Lodwick]]'s ''A Common Writing'' (1647) and ''The Groundwork or Foundation laid (or So Intended) for the Framing of a New Perfect Language and a Universal Common Writing'' (1652)
* Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s ''Ekskybalauron'' (1651) and ''Logopandecteision''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/urquhart/index.html|title=Logopandecteision|work=uchicago.edu}}</ref> (1652)
* [[George Dalgarno]]'s ''Ars signorum'', 1661
* [[John Wilkins]]' ''Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language'', 1668

These early taxonomic conlangs produced systems of [[hierarchical classification]] that were intended to result in both spoken and written expression. [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] had a similar purpose for his ''lingua generalis'' of 1678, aiming at a lexicon of characters upon which the user might perform calculations that would yield true propositions automatically, as a side-effect developing [[binary combinatory logic|binary calculus]]. These projects were not only occupied with reducing or modelling grammar, but also with the arrangement of all human knowledge into "characters" or hierarchies, an idea that with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] would ultimately lead to the ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. Many of these 17th−18th centuries conlangs were [[Pasigraphy|pasigraphies]], or purely written languages with no spoken form or a spoken form that would vary greatly according to the native language of the reader.<ref name="einstein1884">[[Leopold Einstein]], "Al la historio de la Provoj de Lingvoj Tutmondaj de Leibnitz ĝis la Nuna Tempo", 1884.  Reprinted in ''Fundamenta Krestomatio'', UEA 1992 [1903].</ref>

Leibniz and the encyclopedists realized that it is impossible to organize human knowledge unequivocally in a tree diagram, and consequently to construct an ''a priori'' language based on such a classification of concepts. Under the entry ''Charactère'', [[D'Alembert]] critically reviewed the projects of philosophical languages of the preceding century. After the ''Encyclopédie'', projects for ''a priori'' languages moved more and more to the lunatic fringe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Individual authors, typically unaware of the history of the idea, continued to propose taxonomic philosophical languages until the early 20th century (e.g. [[Ro (language)|Ro]]), but most recent [[engineered language]]s have had more modest goals; some are limited to a specific field, like mathematical formalism or calculus (e.g. [[Lincos (artificial language)|Lincos]] and [[programming language]]s), others are designed for eliminating [[syntactical ambiguity]] (e.g., [[Loglan]] and [[Lojban]]) or maximizing conciseness (e.g., [[Ithkuil]]<ref name="foer-2012" />).

===19th and 20th centuries: auxiliary languages===
{{main article|International auxiliary language}}
Already in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' attention began to focus on ''a posteriori'' auxiliary languages. [[Joachim Faiguet de Villeneuve]] in the article on ''Langue'' wrote a short proposition of a "laconic" or regularized grammar of [[French (language)|French]]. During the 19th century, a bewildering variety of such International Auxiliary Languages (IALs) were proposed, so that [[Louis Couturat]] and [[Léopold Leau]] in ''Histoire de la langue universelle'' (1903) reviewed 38 projects.

The first of these that made any international impact was [[Volapük]], proposed in 1879 by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]]; within a decade, 283 Volapükist clubs were counted all over the globe. However, disagreements between Schleyer and some prominent users of the language led to schism, and by the mid-1890s it fell into obscurity, making way for [[Esperanto]], proposed in 1887 by [[L. L. Zamenhof]], and its [[Esperantido|descendants]]. [[Interlingua]], the most recent auxlang to gain a significant number of speakers, emerged in 1951, when the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] published its [[Interlingua–English Dictionary]] and an accompanying [[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|grammar]]. The success of Esperanto did not stop others from trying to construct new auxiliary languages, such as Leslie Jones' [[Eurolengo]], which mixes elements of English and Spanish.

[[Loglan]] (1955) and its descendants constitute a pragmatic return to the aims of the ''a priori'' languages, tempered by the requirement of usability of an auxiliary language. Thus far, these modern ''a priori'' languages have garnered only small groups of speakers.

[[Robot Interaction Language]] (2010) is a spoken language that is optimized for communication between machines and humans. The major goals of ROILA are that it should be easily learnable by the human user, and optimized for efficient recognition by computer [[speech recognition]] algorithms.

===Artlangs===
{{main article|Artistic language}}
Language can be artistic to the extent that artists use language as a source of creativity in art, poetry, calligraphy or as a metaphor to address themes as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalizing world. 

Some people prefer however to take pleasure in constructing, crafting a language by a conscious decision for reasons of literary enjoyment or aesthetic reasons without any claim of usefulness. Such [[Artistic language|artistic languages]] begin to appear in Early Modern literature (in [[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]], and in [[Utopia]]n contexts), but they only seem to gain notability as serious projects beginning in the 20th century.<ref name="higley2007" /> ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'' (1912) by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] was possibly the first fiction of that century to feature a constructed language. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] developed families of related fictional languages and discussed artistic languages publicly, giving a lecture entitled "''[[A Secret Vice]]''" in 1931 at a congress. (Orwell's Newspeak is considered a satire of an [[International auxiliary language|IAL]] rather than an artistic language proper.)

By the beginning of the first decade of the 21st century, it had become common for science-fiction and fantasy works set in other worlds to feature constructed languages, or more commonly, an extremely limited but defined vocabulary which ''suggests'' the existence of a complete language, or whatever portions of the language are needed for the story, and constructed languages are a regular part of the genre, appearing in ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' ([[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish]]), ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' ([[Dothraki language]] and [[Valyrian languages]]), ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' and the ''[[Myst]]'' series of computer adventure games.

==Ownership of constructed languages==

The matter of whether or not a constructed language can be owned or protected by intellectual property laws, or if it would even be possible to enforce those laws, is contentious. 

In a 2015 lawsuit, [[CBS]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] challenged a fan film project called Axanar, stating the project infringed upon their intellectual property, which included the [[Klingon language]], among other creative elements. During the controversy, Marc Okrand, the language's original designer expressed doubt as to whether Paramount's claims of ownership were valid.<ref>Bhana,Yusuf, [https://www.translatemedia.com/us/blog-usa/can-copyright-language Can you copyright a language?] ''Translate Media'', June 6 2019</ref><ref>Gardner, Eriq, [https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/crowdfunded-star-trek-movie-draws-851474 Crowdfunded 'Star Trek' Movie Draws Lawsuit from Paramount, CBS] ''Hollywood Reporter,'' December 30 2015</ref>

[[David J. Peterson]], a linguist who created multiple well-known constructed languages including the [[Valyrian languages]] and [[Dothraki language|Dothraki]], advocated a similar opinion, saying that "Theoretically, anyone can publish anything using any language I created, and, in my opinion, neither I nor anyone else should be able to do anything about it."<ref name="auto">Owen, Becky,[https://www.cla.co.uk/blog/further-education/fictional-language-copyright Can you copyright a fictional language?] ''Copyright Licensing Agency'', 26 September 2019</ref>

However, Peterson also expressed concern that the respective rights-holders—regardless of whether or not their ownership of the rights is legitimate—would be likely to sue individuals who publish material in said languages, especially if the author might profit from said material. 

Furthermore, comprehensive learning material for such constructed languages as High Valyrian and Klingon has been published and made freely accessible on the language-learning platform [[Duolingo]]—but those courses are licensed by the respective copyright holders.<ref name="auto"/> Because only a few such disputes have occurred thus far, the legal consensus on ownership of languages remains uncertain.

==Modern conlang organizations==
Various paper zines on constructed languages were published from the 1970s through the 1990s, such as ''Glossopoeic Quarterly'', ''Taboo Jadoo'', and ''The Journal of Planned Languages''.<ref name="rosta2007">[http://archives.conlang.info/ge/bhaelvhua/vhurtaethuan.html "How did you find out that there were other conlangers?"] Conlang list posting by And Rosta, 14 October 2007</ref>
The Conlang Mailing List was founded in 1991, and later split off an AUXLANG mailing list dedicated to international auxiliary languages. <!-- to do: find exact date of Conlang/Auxlang split --> In the early to mid-1990s a few conlang-related zines were published as email or websites, such as ''Vortpunoj''<ref name="vortpunoj">[http://revo.bierfaristo.com/vortpunoj.html Archives of ''Vortpunoj''] at Steve Brewer's website</ref> and ''Model Languages''. The Conlang mailing list has developed a community of [[List of language inventors|conlangers]] with its own customs, such as translation challenges and [[translation relay]]s,<ref>[http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0003/languages.php Audience, Uglossia, and Conlang: Inventing Languages on the Internet] by Sarah L. Higley. M/C: A Journal of Media and Culture 3.1 (2000). ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050616085932/http://journal.media-culture.org.au/0003/languages.php |date=June 16, 2005 }}, media-culture.org.au site sometimes has problems.)</ref> and its own terminology. Sarah Higley reports from results of her surveys that the demographics of the Conlang list are primarily men from North America and western Europe, with a smaller number from Oceania, Asia, the Middle East, and South America, with an age range from thirteen to over sixty; the number of women participating has increased over time.

More recently founded online communities include the [[Zompist]] Bulletin Board (ZBB; since 2001) and the Conlanger Bulletin Board.  Discussion on these forums includes presentation of members' conlangs and feedback from other members, discussion of natural languages, whether particular conlang features have natural language precedents, and how interesting features of natural languages can be repurposed for conlangs, posting of interesting short texts as translation challenges, and meta-discussion about the philosophy of conlanging, conlangers' purposes, and whether conlanging is an art or a hobby.<ref name="higley2007"/>  Another 2001 survey by Patrick Jarrett showed an average age of 30.65, with the average time since starting to invent languages 11.83 years.<ref name="jarrett2001">[http://archives.conlang.info/bhe/gherque/chivirchein.html "Update mailing list statistics—FINAL"], Conlang list posting by Patrick Jarrett, 13 September 2001</ref> A more recent thread on the ZBB showed that many conlangers spend a relatively small amount of time on any one conlang, moving from one project to another; about a third spend years on developing the same language.<ref name="avg_age">[http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=28831 "Average life of a conlang"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614035040/http://www.spinnoff.com/zbb/viewtopic.php?t=28831 |date=2011-06-14 }} thread on Zompist Bulletin Board, 15 August 2008; accessed 26 August 2008.<br/>[http://archives.conlang.info/wu/seifi/phirqondal.html "Average life of a conlang"] thread on Conlang mailing list, 27 August 2008 (should be archived more persistently than the ZBB thread)</ref>{{portal|Constructed languages}}
