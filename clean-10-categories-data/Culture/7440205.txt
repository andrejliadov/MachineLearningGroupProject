The term '''Caledonian Antisyzygy''' refers to the "idea of dueling polarities within one entity",<ref>Martin, Maureen M. (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5HZYPW17S34C&pg=PA84&dq=%22caledonian+antisyzygy&hl=en&ei=gnwUTK7pGdKbOIaxoK4M&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&q=%22caledonian%20antisyzygy&f=false Maureen M. ''The Mighty Scot'', p. 84].</ref> thought of as typical for the Scottish psyche and literature. The term, which is derived from the Greek word ''zygon'' (yoke) and ''syzygy'' (conjunction or alignment), specifically refers to the so-called "Scottish disjunction".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Thistle and the Brier: Historical Links and Cultural Parallels Between Scotland and Appalachia|last=Blaustein|first=Richard|date=2003|publisher=McFarland|year=|isbn=0786414529|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=67}}</ref>  

== Origin ==
Caledonian Antisyzygy was first coined by [[George Gregory Smith|G. Gregory Smith]] in response to the view - especially that espoused by figures such as [[T.S. Eliot]] - that there is no value in Scottish provincial literature, noting an absence of coherence and an anchor in a single language.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Bella Caledonia: Woman, Nation, Text|last=Stirling|first=Kirsten|date=2008|publisher=Rodopi|year=|isbn=9789042025103|location=New York|pages=103}}</ref> Smith argued that such diversity or the union of opposites forms the basis of Scottish literature.<ref name=":1" /> While merging of opposites is not a unique cultural or racial trait, it is said that such contradiction became [[Apotheosis|apotheosized]] among the Scots.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Uncovering Caledonia: An Introduction to Scottish Studies|last=Kaličanin|first=Milena|date=2018|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=|isbn=9781527508019|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|pages=123}}</ref> In his 1919 book ''Scottish Literature: Character and Influence,''<ref>Carruthers, Gerard. (2009).

<!--Quote needs to be either paraphrased or summarised.-->
<blockquote>we find at closer scanning that the cohesion at least in formal expression and in choice of material is only apparent, that the literature is remarkably varied, and that it becomes, under the stress of foreign influence, almost a zigzag of contradictions. The antithesis need not, however, disconcert us. Perhaps in the very combination of opposites—what either of the two Thomases, [[Thomas Browne|of Norwich]] and [[Thomas Urquhart|Cromarty]], might have been willing to call "'''the Caledonian antisyzygy'''"— we have a reflection of the contrasts which the Scot shows at every turn... we need not be surprised to find that in his literature the Scot presents two aspects which appear contradictory. Oxymoron was ever the bravest figure, and we must not forget that disorderly order is order after all.</blockquote>

The term has since been adopted by figures of the Scottish Renascence of the 1920s such as [[Hugh MacDiarmid|Christopher Murray Grieve]] also known as [[Hugh MacDiarmid]].<ref name=":0" /> The poet elaborated on the concept in his essay, ''The Caledonian Antisyzygy and the Gaelic Idea'', published in two parts in ''The Modern Scot'' 1931–1932. The notion is most frequently cited in reference to the seemingly morally contradictory quality of the works of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] (''Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde'') and [[James Hogg]] (''The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner'').<ref name=":2">Hugo Dobson and [[Glenn Hook|Glenn D.

It is suggested that the emergence of Caledonian Antisyzygy as a tradition is associated with postmodernism, which resonates in Scotland not only due to the increasing [[cultural diversity]] in Britain but also because this genre features ontological shifts into worlds that are disjunct from reality.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Refracting the Canon in Contemporary British Literature and Film|last=Onega|first=Susana|last2=Jaén|first2=Susana Onega|last3=Gutleben|first3=Christian|date=2004|publisher=Rodopi|year=|isbn=9042010509|location=New York|pages=65}}</ref> Scholars such as Randall Stevenson maintained that the Scottish literature itself often includes narratives that have "antisyzygical splits" or double words/double narratives as demonstrated in the case of [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Jekyll and Hyde]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shades of Gray: science fiction, history and the problem of postmodernism in the work of Alasdair Gray|last=Böhnke|first=Dietmar|date=2004|publisher=Galda & Wilch|year=|isbn=9783931397548|location=Glienicke, Brandenburg|pages=77}}</ref> as well as the focus on the contrasts between the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]], Protestantism and Catholicism, Britishness and Scottishness, and others.<ref name=":2" />  

A disparaging interpretation refers to Caledonian Antisyzygy as the state of anguished examination of conscience and consciousness - a troubled posturing - that characterizes the mindset of Scottish [[Intellectual|intellectuals]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Break-up of Britain: Crisis and Neo-nationalism|last=Nairn|first=Tom|date=2003|publisher=Common Ground|year=|isbn=1863355081|location=Altona, Victoria|pages=138}}</ref>
