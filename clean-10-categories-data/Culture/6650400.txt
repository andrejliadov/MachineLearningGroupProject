According to [[Rudolf Koch]], the '''Dragon's Eye''' is an ancient [[Germany|Germanic]] symbol.<ref>''The Book of Signs'' by Rudolf Koch (London 1930 ; New York, 1955). {{ISBN|0-486-20162-7}} p. 95</ref> The Dragon's Eye is an [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]] or [[equilateral triangle]] pointing downward, with a "Y" in the middle connecting the three points of the triangle together. According to Carl G. Liungman's ''Dictionary of Symbols'', it combines the triangle meaning "threat" and the "[[Y]]" meaning a choice between [[good and evil]].<ref>''Dictionary of Symbols'', by Carl G. Liungman, W. W. Norton & Company. {{ISBN|0-393-31236-4}}</ref>

The dragon's eye resembles a two dimensional projection of a [[tetrahedron]] viewed from directly above one of its vertices.  Such a 2-D representation has been part of the logo of the [[Citgo|Citgo Petroleum Company]] ever since 1982, when it was spun off from Cities Services Company.

The dragon's eye was used by the [[White Nationalism|white nationalist]] organization [[Identity Evropa]] as their logo from their founding in 2016 until they re-branded themselves as the "American Identity Movement" in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-far-right-symbols-20170814-story.html|title=A guide to some of the far-right symbols seen in Charlottesville|last=Pearce|first=Matt|date=August 14, 2017|website=LA Times|access-date=March 17, 2018}}</ref>
