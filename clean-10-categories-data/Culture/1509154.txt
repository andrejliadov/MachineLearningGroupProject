A '''cultural critic''' is a [[critic]] of a given [[culture]], usually as a whole. Cultural criticism has significant overlap with [[social theory|social]] and [[cultural theory]]. While such criticism is simply part of the self-consciousness of the culture, the social positions of the critics and the medium they use vary widely. The conceptual and political grounding of criticism.

==Terminology ==
Contemporary usage has tended to include all types of [[criticism]] directed at culture.

The term "cultural criticism" itself has been claimed by [[Jacques Barzun]]: ''No such thing was recognized or in favour when we [i.e. Barzun and Trilling] began&mdash;more by intuition than design&mdash;in the autumn of 1934''.<ref>''Remembering [[Lionel Trilling]]'', (1976), reprinted in ''The Jacques Barzun Reader'' (2002).</ref><ref>[[Casey Nelson Blake]], a professor at [[Columbia University]] where Barzun and Trilling were, uses the term in the 1990 book title ''Beloved Community: The Cultural Criticism of [[Randolph Bourne]], [[Van Wyck Brooks]], [[Waldo Frank]], and [[Lewis Mumford]]''.</ref> It has been argued that in the [[inter-war period]], the language of [[literary criticism]] was adequate for the needs of cultural critics; but that later it mainly served [[academe]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bullard |first1=Paddy |title=The Oxford Handbook of Eighteenth-Century Satire |date=2019 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198727835 |page=710 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3dShDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA710 |language=en}}</ref> [[Alan Trachtenberg]]'s ''Critics of Culture'' (1976) concentrated on American intellectuals of the 1920s who were "nonacademic" (including [[H. L. Mencken]] and [[Lewis Mumford]]), where the 1995 collection ''American Cultural Critics'' covered mainly later figures, such as [[F. O. Matthiessen]] and [[Susan Sontag]], involved in debates on [[American culture]] as national.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Murray |first1=David |title=American Cultural Critics |date=1995 |publisher=University of Exeter Press |isbn=9780859894043 |pages=1–2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMKl8SDRZzMC&pg=PA1 |language=en}}</ref>

In contrast, a work such as [[Richard Wolin]]'s 1995 ''The Terms of Cultural Criticism: The Frankfurt School, Existentialism, Poststructuralism'' (1995) uses it as a broad-brush description.

==Victorian sages as critics==
Cultural critics came to the scene in the nineteenth century. [[Matthew Arnold]]<ref>His much-cited ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' was subtitled ''An Essay in Political and Social Criticism''.</ref> and [[Thomas Carlyle]] are leading examples of a cultural critic of the [[Victorian age]]; in Arnold there is also a concern for religion. [[John Ruskin]] was another. Because of an equation made between ugliness of material surroundings and an impoverished life, [[aesthete]]s and others might be considered implicitly to be engaging in cultural criticism, but the actual articulation is what makes a critic. In France, [[Charles Baudelaire]] was a cultural critic, as was [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in Denmark and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in Germany.

==Twentieth century==

In the twentieth century [[Irving Babbitt]] on the right, and [[Walter Benjamin]]<ref>E.g. [[Richard Wolin]], ''Walter Benjamin: An Aesthetic of Redemption'' (1994), series ''Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism'', 7.</ref> on the left, might be considered major cultural critics. The field of play has changed considerably, in that the [[humanities]] have broadened to include [[cultural studies]] of all kinds, which are grounded in [[critical theory]]. This trend is not without its dissidents, however; [[James Seaton (professor)|James Seaton]] has written extensively in defense of the continued importance of the [[Humanistic Tradition]] Irving Babbitt and his heirs championed, while criticizing the dominance of [[critical theory]] in the teaching of literature. [[Theory's Empire: An Anthology of Dissent]] features a collection of essays from prominent English professors, writers and critics stating their disagreement with the prominent role given to critical theory in English departments.
