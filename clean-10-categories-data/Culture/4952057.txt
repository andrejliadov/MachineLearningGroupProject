'''Nazareth College''' ("Naz") is a [[Private colleges|private]] college in [[Pittsford, New York]]. It offers over 60 undergraduate majors<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www2.naz.edu/academics |title = Undergraduate Majors & Graduate Degree Programs &#124; Nazareth College, Rochester NY}}</ref> and more than two dozen graduate programs. The college was previously known as Nazareth College of Rochester.

==History==
[[File:Nazareth College.JPG|thumbnail|right|Golisano Academic Center, Nazareth College]]

===Founding===
At the request of [[Thomas Francis Hickey (bishop)|Bishop Thomas Francis Hickey]] of Rochester, five [[Sisters of St. Joseph]] founded Nazareth College of Rochester in 1924. The first class was composed of 25 young women who began their studies in a large mansion on Lake Avenue in [[Rochester, New York]]. The original mansion that housed the college was known as "the Glass House." At that time, the college offered Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, each with a [[liberal arts]] core. In response to increasing enrollment, the college moved to a larger facility in 1928 at 402 Augustine Street.

===Move to East Avenue===
In January 1942, the college moved to its present campus on East Avenue in the suburb of [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]]. In the 1950s, the college responded to the need for graduate study by adding majors and by the 1970s offered programs in teacher education and social work.  Study abroad programs and intercollegiate sports were also added in the 1970s. During this time, the college became co-educational and independent of the Roman Catholic Church.

Nazareth competed in men’s intercollegiate athletics for the first time in 1977. The official nickname of the sports teams became the Golden Flyers — golden for the Nazareth color, and flyers for the bird-like symbol that is part of the old Nazareth logo. Today, Nazareth supports 25 varsity teams. The most recent sport, which began competition in 2019: men's rugby.<ref>[https://www2.naz.edu/news/archive/2018/July/447/nazareth-names-new-rugby-coach-for-inaugural-2019-season].</ref>

===Expansion===
In the early 2000s, the college purchased adjacent land from the Sisters of St. Joseph, including the former Motherhouse and Infirmary. This acquisition doubled the campus size to its current 150 acres.  As a result of support from college benefactors (including Tom Golisano, the founder of Paychex), the Motherhouse became the Golisano Academic Center. The Infirmary became George Hall, a residence hall that also houses a coffeehouse and late night study area. The decade of the 2000s also saw the construction of additional student housing, including Portka Hall, Clock Tower Commons, and the Lyons and Breen apartment buildings.

In 2003, 30 years after becoming religiously independent, Nazareth College was removed from ''The Official Catholic Directory,'' having been declared no longer a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] institution by [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester|Rochester Bishop]] Matthew H. Clark. It was the second time since [[Pope John Paul II]] issued [[Ex Corde Ecclesiae]], the apostolic constitution on Catholic universities in 1990, a bishop declared a historically Catholic college or university to be not Catholic.<ref>{{cite web

|title = New York Archdiocese Says Marist College 'No Longer Catholic'|accessdate = 2007-09-14}}</ref>

In 2012, Nazareth added Peckham Hall, the Integrated Center for Math and Science. Named after lead donors Nancy and Larry Peckham, the $30 million facility support majors in math and science fields, as well as education programs. It also provides important learning facilities for students in health and human services programs.
