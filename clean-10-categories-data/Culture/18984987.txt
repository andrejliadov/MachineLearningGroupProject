'''Eastern world''', also known as '''the East''' or '''the [[Orient]]''', is an [[umbrella term]] for various [[culture]]s or [[society|social structures]], nations and [[philosophy|philosophical systems]], which vary depending on the context. It most often includes at least part of [[Asia]] or, geographically, the countries and cultures east of [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean]] region and [[Arab world]], specifically in historical ([[pre-modern]]) contexts, and in modern times in the context of [[Orientalism]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=William |author2=Joseph Hickey |year=2005 |title=Society in Focus |publisher=[[Pearson plc]] |location =Boston |id=0-205-41365-X}}</ref> It is often seen as a [[counterpart theory|counterpart]] to the [[Western world]], and correlates strongly to the southern half of the [[North–South divide in the World|North–South divide]].

The various regions included in the term are varied, hard to generalize, and do not have a single shared common heritage, as is frequently claimed for the Western world. Although the various parts of the Eastern world share many common threads, most notably being in the [[Global South]] they have never historically defined themselves collectively.<ref>Lee, Sandra S. Mouth, Joanna. Barbara, Koening A. The Meanings of Race in the New Genomics: Implications for Health Disparities Research. Yale University. 2001. October 26, 2006.

The term originally had a literal geographic meaning, referring to the eastern part of the [[Old World]], contrasting the cultures and civilizations of Asia with those of Europe (or the Western world). Traditionally, this includes all of [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Greater Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], and [[South Asia]] ([[Afghanistan]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]]). 

Conceptually, the boundary between east and west is cultural, rather than geographical, as a result of which [[Australia]] is typically grouped in the 
West, while the [[Soviet Central Asia|Central Asian nations]] of the former [[Soviet Union]], even with significant western influence, are grouped in the East.<ref name=Mestrovic>{{cite book | last = Meštrovic | first = Stjepan | title = Balkanization of the West: The Confluence of Postmodernism and Postcommunism | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-203-34464-2 | page = 61}}</ref> Other than [[Asia]] and some parts of [[Africa]], [[Europe]] has successfully absorbed almost all of the societies of Oceania, and the [[Americas]] into the [[Western world]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/fine_arts.html |title=Embassy of Brazil – Ottawa |publisher=Brasembottawa.org |accessdate=2011-05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429013145/http://www.brasembottawa.org/en/culture_academic/fine_arts.html |archive-date=2011-04-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Falcoff |first=Mark |url=http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11413/pub_detail.asp |title=Chile Moves On |publisher=AEI |accessdate=2011-05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417075124/http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.11413/pub_detail.asp |archive-date=2009-04-17 }}</ref> [[Turkey]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Israel]], which are geographically located in the Eastern world, are considered at least partially westernized due to the [[westernization|cultural influence of Europe]].<ref name="Sheldon Kirshner">{{cite web|author=Sheldon Kirshner |url=http://sheldonkirshner.com/?p=1673 |title=Is Israel Really a Western Nation? |publisher=Sheldon Kirshner Journal |date=2013-10-16 |accessdate=2013-11-09}}</ref><ref name=Turkey1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/eu-turkey-relations/article-129678|accessdate=26 August 2008|title=EU-Turkey relations|work=European Information on Enlargement & Neighbours|publisher=EurActiv.com|date=23 September 2004}}</ref><ref name=Turkey2>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1920882,00.html|work=TIME|title=Fifty Years On, Turkey Still Pines to Become European|date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=8 September 2009}}</ref>

In some cases, the definition may be rarely used to refer to the former [[Eastern Bloc]] and [[Third World]] [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-aligned]] nations.

=== Asian concepts ===
Although the concept of a unified [[Asian people|Asian race]] does exist, its legitimacy is dubious, given how many different countries and cultures Asia comprises.<ref>Cartmill, M. (1999). The Status of the Race Concept in Physical Anthropology. American Anthropologist 100(3)651 -660.</ref><ref>For example, "Asian and Indian people" are referred to in the New Zealand Heart Foundation's [http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ BMI calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531222922/http://www.pickthetick.org.nz/bmi/ |date=2009-05-31 }}.</ref> This concept is even more debatable due to the fact that common parlance links the "Asian identity" to the people of South and East Asia and exclude regions of [[Western Asia]], which do not typically consider themselves part of the Eastern world; such areas include the [[Arab world|Arab nations]], [[Israel]], [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Khatib | first = Lina | title = Filming the modern Middle East: politics in the cinemas of Hollywood and the Arab world | volume = 57 | series = Library of Modern Middle East Studies, Library of International Relations | publisher = [[I.B. Tauris]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-84511-191-5 | pages = 166–167, 173}}</ref> 

Asian cultures often have strong traits of [[nationalism]] and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic individualism]], but the presence of many different cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems often results in cultural identities specific to individual nations and ethnic groups, not inclusive of the rest of the continent. People of Asia may prefer not to identify with their continent or region, but rather with their specific nation or cultural group.

The division between 'East' and 'West', formerly referred to as [[Orient]] and [[Western world|Occident]], is a product of European cultural history and of the distinction between European [[Christendom]] and the cultures beyond it to the East. With the [[European colonization of the Americas]] the East/West distinction became global. The concept of an Eastern, "Indian" ([[Indies]]) or "[[Oriental]]" sphere was emphasized by ideas of racial as well as religious and cultural differences. Such distinctions were articulated by Westerners in the scholarly tradition known as Orientalism and [[Indology]]. The notion of an Asian identity may, therefore, be considered a primarily European construct. [[Orientalism]], interestingly, has been the only Western concept of a unified Eastern world not limited to any specific region(s), but rather all of Asia together.<ref>Tromans, 6</ref><ref>from the Latin ''oriens''; ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''</ref>

=== European concepts ===
During the [[Cold War]], the term "Eastern world" was sometimes used as an extension of [[Eastern bloc]], connoting the [[Soviet Union]], the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and their [[communist]] allies, while the term "Western world" often connoted the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies such as the [[United Kingdom]].

The concept is often another term for the [[Far East]] – a region that bears considerable cultural and religious commonality. Eastern philosophy, art, literature, and other traditions, are often found throughout the region in places of high importance, such as popular culture, architecture and traditional literature. The spread of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Yoga]] is partly responsible for this.

Eastern culture has developed many themes and traditions. Some important ones are:

* [[Abrahamic religions]] (a.k.a. [[Abrahamic religions|West Asian religions]]) 
** [[Christianity]] — the majority of the modern world adheres to this faith although it isn't widely practiced in its native continent of Asia anymore and since the faith had spread to the [[Western World]] the notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}</ref> Nonetheless, vibrant indigenous minorities in the [[Levant]] have preserved their ancient beliefs, adhering to [[Syriac Christianity]] (i.e. [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Maronite people]]), an [[Eastern Christian]] sect.
** [[Islam]] — the majority of the world [[Muslim]] population have always lived in Asia, due to Islam spreading and becoming the dominant religion of these areas.
** [[Judaism]] — the national religion of the [[Israelites]]/[[Hebrews]] of the [[Fertile Crescent]], or what is now [[Israel]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]]. They eventually evolved into the [[Jews]] (particularly [[Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardic]], [[Mizrahi]]) and [[Samaritans]] of today.
