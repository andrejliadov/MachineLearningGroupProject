The '''Three Turnings of the Wheel (of Dharma)''' refers to a framework for understanding the sutra stream of the teachings of the [[Buddhism]] originally devised by the [[Yogachara]] school. It later became prevalent in modified form in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and related traditions.

The distinction is, on the one hand, a historic or quasi-historic scheme by which the Buddha's first sermons, as recorded in the Pali Canon and the [[tripitaka]]s of other early schools, constitute the First Turning, and the later [[Mahayana]] [[Sūtra|sutras]] comprise the Second and Third turnings. The schema appears in the [[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|''Samdhinirmochana'']] Sutra, a central Yogachara text, although it may predate it.

The model of three turnings of the 'Wheel' is an attempt to categorize the content, philosophical view, and practical application of the whole array of Buddhist [[sutrayana]] teachings. In [[East Asian Buddhism]], this classification system was expanded and modified into different doctrinal classifications called ''panjiao'' which were developed by different Chinese Buddhist schools.<ref>Ronald S. Green, Chanju Mun, ''Gyōnen’s Transmission of the Buddha Dharma in Three Countries'', BRILL, 2018, p. 28.</ref>

==Contents of the Three Turnings==
The basic content and audience of the three turnings of the wheel can be summarized as follows:

===First Turning===
The first turning is traditionally said to have taken place at Deer Park in [[Sarnath]] near Varanasi in northern [[India]], to an audience of [[shravaka]]s. It consisted of the teaching of the [[Four Noble Truths]] (Sanskrit: ''[[catvāry āryasatyāni]]''<ref>Jones, Lindsay (Ed. in Chief)(2005). ''Encyclopedia of Religion''. (2nd Ed.) Volume 14; Masaaki, Hattori (Ed.)(1987 & 2005)"''Yogācāra''": p.9897. USA:  Macmillan Reference.  {{ISBN|0-02-865983-X}} (v.14)</ref>) and the other elements of the Tripitaka &ndash; the [[Abhidharma]], [[Sutta Pitaka|Sutrapitaka]] and [[Vinaya]]. The Abhidharma referred to is the Abhidharma Pitaka of the [[Sarvastivada]] school, which is a later composition not taught by the Buddha, and contains philosophy which is antithetical, one may say, to the early teachings.<ref>David Kalupahana, "Sarvastivada and its theory of sarvam asti." ''University of Ceylon Review'' 24 1966, 94-105.</ref>

===Second Turning===
The second turning is said to have taken place at Vulture Peak Mountain in [[Rajagriha]], in [[Bihar]], India. The audience comprised [[bodhisattva]]s; in some telling there were also shravaka [[arhat]]s there as well.  In the second turning, the emphasis is on [[shunyata|emptiness]] (Skt: ''śūnyatā'') as epitomized in the ''[[Prajnaparamita]] sutras'', and on [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (Skt: ''{{IAST|karuṇā}}''). These two elements form [[bodhicitta]], the epitome of the second turning. The [[Madhyamika]] school that [[Nagarjuna]] founded arose from his [[exegesis]] of the early texts and is included under the second turning. Nagarjuna attacked the metaphysics of the [[Sarvastivada]] school and a school which broke away from it called [[Sautrantika]], and promoted, among other things, the classical emphasis on the dependent arising of phenomena of the early texts.<ref>Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, pages 221-222.</ref>

===Third Turning===
The first sutra source which mentions the "three turnings" is the ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Ārya-saṃdhi-nirmocana-sūtra]]'' or ''Noble sūtra of the Explanation of the Profound Secrets,'' the most foundational sutra of the [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]] school. The sūtra affirms that the earlier turnings while being authentic are also flawed or incomplete and require interpretation. The ''[[Sandhinirmocana Sutra|Saṃdhi-nirmocana]]'' further claims that its teachings are the ultimate and final truth. Major ideas include the basis-consciousness (''[[Eight Consciousnesses|ālaya-vijñāna]]''), and the doctrine of cognition-only (''vijñapti-mātra'') and the "three natures" (''trisvabhāva'').

Some Buddhist traditions also consider the ''[[Tathāgatagarbha]]'' (also known as Buddha nature) teachings as part of this turning. This was elaborated on in great detail by [[Maitreya]] via [[Asanga]] in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon#Five treatises of Maitreya|Five Treatises of Maitreya]], which are also generally grouped under the third turning. The [[Yogachara]] school reoriented later refinements, in all their complexity, so as to accord with the doctrines of earliest Buddhism.<ref>Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology.'' Routledge, 2002, page 43.</ref>

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Vajrayana|Buddhist tantra]] and its [[Tantras (Buddhism)|associated scriptures]] are sometimes considered to also be part of the third turning.<ref>Ray,  Reginald A. Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet, 2002, p. 126.</ref>

== Other similar classifications ==

===Fourth Turning===
[[Vajrayana]] schools sometimes refer to [[Vajrayana|Buddhist tantra]] as the "fourth turning." As explained by [[Surya Das|Lama Surya Das]], some traditions consider [[Dzogchen]] as a fourth turning.<ref>Lama Surya Das, Awakening the Buddha Within: Eight Steps to Enlightenment, p. 63.</ref> 

=== Sanron school ===
According to Japanese scholar [[Takakusu Junjiro|Junjirō Takakusu]], the [[East Asian Mādhyamaka|Sanron]] (Sanlun) [[Madhyamaka]] school divided the teaching into three [[Dharmachakra|dharmacakras]] as well, but with different definitions for each:<ref>Junjirō Takakusu, The Essentials of Buddhist Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1998, p. 109.

# The branch wheel of [[Hinayana]] and [[Mahayana]] texts.

=== Tiantai ===
The Chinese [[Tiantai]] school organized the Buddhas teachings into five periods (五時):<ref>A. Charles Muller (trans), Outline of the Tiantai Fourfold Teachings 天台四教儀 Compiled by the Goryeo Śramaṇa Chegwan 高麗沙門諦觀 http://www.acmuller.net/kor-bud/sagyoui.html</ref>

# [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Flower Ornament]] period 華嚴時, The sudden teaching is delivered as the Avatamsaka sutra, containing the direct content of the Buddha’s enlightenment experience. Few can understand it.
# Deer Park period 鹿苑時 (represented by the ''[[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgama]] sūtras'' 阿含經), represent a gradual and simpler teaching.
# the [[Mahayana|Vaipulya]] period 方等時 (represented by the ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra|Vimalakīrti Sūtra]]'' 淨名經 and so forth); this and the next period represent gradually deeper teachings. 
# the Prajñā period 般若時 (represented by the ''[[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā sūtras]]'' 般若經). 
# Lotus-Nirvāṇa period 法華涅槃時, [[Lotus Sutra|Lotus sutra]] and [[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra|''Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra'']], a teaching that is neither sudden nor gradual.

=== Huayen ===
Likewise, the [[Huayan|Huayen]] school had a five period system of dharma teachings:<ref>Buswell, Robert E.

# The "Final Teachings", based on the [[Tathagatagarbha|Tathagatagarbha-teachings]], especially the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana|Awakening of Faith]]
# The [[Subitism|Sudden Teaching]], "which 'revealed' (''hsien'') rather than verbalised the teaching"

==Definitive and provisional==
The schema of the three turnings is found in Yogachara and Tathāgatagarbha texts such as the [[Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra]] and the [[Srimala Sutra]] and likely originated in the Yogachara literature. Naturally, they identify themselves as definitive. However, the schema was later adopted more widely, and different sects and schools of Buddhism, as well as individual Buddhist teachers and philosophers give different explanations as to whether the second or third turnings is 'definitive' (Skt: ''nitartha'') or 'provisional' (Skt: ''neyartha'') or requiring interpretation. In the Tibetan tradition, the [[Gelug]] school considers the second turning definitive, as do some scholars in other schools.
