A '''duocentric social network''' is a type of [[social network]] composed of the combined network members of a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]]. The network consists of mutual, overlapping ties between members of the dyad as well as non-mutual ties.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Kennedy|first1=David P.|last2=Jackson|first2=Grace L.|last3=Green|first3=Harold D.|last4=Bradbury|first4=Thomas N.|last5=Karney|first5=Benjamin R.|date=2015|title=The Analysis of Duocentric Social Networks: A Primer|journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family|volume=77|issue=1|pages=295–311|doi=10.1111/jomf.12151|issn=0022-2445|pmc=4864858|pmid=27182084}}</ref> While an explicit conceptualization of ''duocentric social networks'' appeared for the first time in an academic publication in 2008,<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Coromina|first1=Lluís|last2=Guia|first2=Jaume|last3=Coenders|first3=Germà|last4=Ferligoj|first4=Anuška|date=2008-01-01|title=Duocentered networks|journal=Social Networks|volume=30|issue=1|pages=49–59|doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2007.07.001|issn=0378-8733}}</ref> the history of the analysis dates back to at least the 1950s<ref name="Rogler 1986 693–701">{{Cite journal|last1=Rogler|first1=Lloyd H.|last2=Procidano|first2=Mary E.|date=1986|title=The Effect of Social Networks on Marital Roles: A Test of the Bott Hypothesis in an Intergenerational Context|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=48|issue=4|pages=693–701|doi=10.2307/352562|issn=0022-2445|jstor=352562}}</ref> and has spanned the fields of [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[health]].

== History ==

=== Original conception ===
Coromina et al. coined the term ''duocentered networks'' to describe the analytical technique of combining two individuals’ (or ''egos'') social networks to examine both the shared network members (or ''alters'') between a dyad and those that are connected to only one individual.<ref name=":0"/> In this original conceptualization, Coromina et al. did not consider the relationships between the alters (i.e., the ''ties'' between alters) to be a necessary component of duocentric network analysis.

The impetus for this original conceptualization was a compromise between the two most commonly used social network analytical methods: ''egocentric''<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Djomba|first1=Janet Klara|last2=Zaletel-Kragelj|first2=Lijana|date=2016-07-28|title=A methodological approach to the analysis of egocentric social networks in public health research: a practical example|journal=Slovenian Journal of Public Health|volume=55|issue=4|pages=256–263|doi=10.1515/sjph-2016-0035|issn=0351-0026|pmc=5030837|pmid=27703548}}</ref> and ''sociocentric''<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Perkins|first1=Jessica M.|last2=Subramanian|first2=S.

Coromina et al.<ref name=":0" /> also state that duocentered networks relieve issues of [[data collection]] in sociocentric networks. First, it reduces “respondent inaccuracy” in reporting network contacts, which will be more prevalent in less well socially connected individuals. Because the dyad is selected for a specific network research question, they are more likely to be central members of their networks and better positioned to accurately report on their network contacts. Second, the technique reduces “unit non-response," which is the failure of an eligible study participant to respond or provide enough information to deem the response statistically usable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/encyclopedia-of-survey-research-methods/n608.xml|title=Unit Nonresponse - SAGE Research Methods|website=methods.sagepub.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Because the focus of a duocentered network is only two individuals rather than a larger group, it will ostensibly be easier to gather usable information.{{or|date=March 2020}}

=== Kennedy et al. (2015) expansion ===
Kennedy et al.<ref name=":1" /> maintained this basic framework, but redefined the concept as ''duocentric networks'', and suggested that information on the relatedness of ties in the network should be collected. Coromina et al. did not take this approach because of the respondent inaccuracy and unit non-response bias that similarly affect sociocentric analyses.<ref name=":0" /> Respondent inaccuracy in the context of duocentric networks means that people will inaccurately report the connections between their network members. Unit non-response follows from this difficulty; if people are unable to report connections, certain analyses that rely on these connections may not be possible.{{or|date=March 2020}}

== Analysis ==

=== Structural Measures ===
There are several common [[Structure|structural]] metrics derived from duocentric social networks:

* Degree centrality: The number of ties that an ego has with other network members. More central egos have a greater number of connections.<ref name=":1" />
* Closeness centrality: An ego has higher closeness centrality as the number of “steps” it takes to get to other alters in the network decreases. If an alter is the friend of a friend of one's partner, this will decrease one's closeness centrality as compared to a friend of one's partner (i.e., one step closer to the ego).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Linton C.|date=1978-01-01|title=Centrality in social networks conceptual clarification|journal=Social Networks|volume=1|issue=3|pages=215–239|doi=10.1016/0378-8733(78)90021-7|issn=0378-8733}}</ref>
* Betweenness centrality: If a network is visualized as many separate paths connecting network members to each other through varying number of links, an ego has higher betweenness centrality to the extent that they lie on more paths between alters in a network.<ref name=":0" /> Higher betweenness centrality indicates that one plays a larger role as an intermediary between network members who may not be directly connected.
* Density: The total number of ties in a network relative to the total number of ''possible'' ties in a network.<ref name=":1" />
* Overlap: Unique to duocentric networks, overlap measures the number of shared ties between two egos.<ref name=":1" />
* Diversity: Similar to density, diversity measures the size of the non-overlapping network members of both egos in the dyad.<ref name=":0" />
* Components: A component is a portion of the social network that is disconnected from the rest of the full network. The members in a component are connected either directly or through a maximum of one mutual tie. Generally, a greater number of components signals a less well-connected network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Widmer|first=Eric D.|date=2016-06-29|title=Who are my family members?

* Isolates: A measure of fragmentation in the network, isolates in a duocentric network are those that are connected to only one ego and to no other network members.<ref name=":1" />

=== Compositional Measures ===
Compositional measures are the characteristics of the individuals who make up the network or other [[Social norm|societal norm]]s and structures that may influence the structure and function of a social network.<ref name=":1" /> Compositional measures include social support,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Jeffrey A.|date=2010|title=Parents' networks: Egocentric networks and unique and shared sources of social support|url=https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/7189|language=en}}</ref> intimate relationship approval from network members,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bryant|first1=Chalandra M.|last2=Conger|first2=Rand D.|date=1999|title=Marital Success and Domains of Social Support in Long-Term Relationships: Does the Influence of Network Members Ever End?|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=61|issue=2|pages=437–450|doi=10.2307/353760|issn=0022-2445|jstor=353760}}</ref> proportion of family or friends in the network,<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Cotton|first1=Sandra|last2=Cunningham|first2=John D.|last3=Antill|first3=John K.|date=1993-12-01|title=Network structure, network support and the marital satisfaction of husbands and wives|journal=Australian Journal of Psychology|volume=45|issue=3|pages=176–181|doi=10.1080/00049539308259136|issn=0004-9530}}</ref> demographic characteristics, and norms.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Timmer|first1=Susan G.|last2=Veroff|first2=Joseph|date=2000|title=Family Ties and the Discontinuity of Divorce in Black and White Newlywed Couples|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|language=en|volume=62|issue=2|pages=349–361|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00349.x|issn=1741-3737}}</ref>

=== Feedback Loops ===
Although primarily supported in egocentric network analyses,<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Baxter|first1=Leslie A.|last2=Widenmann|first2=Sally|date=1993|title=Revealing and Not Revealing the Status of Romantic Relationships to Social Networks|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|language=en-US|volume=10|issue=3|pages=321–337|doi=10.1177/0265407593103002|s2cid=145082611|issn=0265-4075}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=Heather Kohler|last2=Felmlee|first2=Diane H.|last3=Conger|first3=Rand D.|date=2014-11-27|title=The Social Context of Adolescent Friendships: Parents, Peers, and Romantic Partners|journal=Youth & Society|volume=49|issue=5|pages=679–705|language=en|doi=10.1177/0044118X14559900|s2cid=146816449}}</ref> evidence suggest that dyads can influence the composition and structure of the duocentric networks in which they are embedded.

== Applications ==

=== Application to intimate relationships ===
One of the first studies examining duocentric social networks was [[Elizabeth Spillius|Elizabeth Bott's]] 1957 finding that the density of spouse's separate networks is positively associated with marital role segregation, a finding now known as the [[Bott Hypothesis]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Family and Social Network (2nd ed.)|last=Bott|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Free Press|year=1971|location=New York}}</ref> While Bott did not examine the overlapping network of spouses, her work was among the first to collect network data separately from both members of a dyad, and use that data to predict a dyadic phenomenon.

Perhaps the most well-studied phenomenon utilizing a duocentric network approach in the context of intimate relationships is network overlap. Most of this research points to higher relationship satisfaction as the level of overlap increases.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=Finy J.|last2=Fallon|first2=April E.|last3=Novotny|first3=Sherie L.|date=1991|title=The relationship between social network structure and marital satisfaction in distressed and nondistressed couples: A pilot study.|journal=Family Therapy|volume=18|issue=2|pages=101–114}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Hyun J.|last2=Stiff|first2=James B.|date=1991-09-01|title=Social Networks and the Development of Close Relationships|url=https://academic.oup.com/hcr/article/18/1/70/4575811|journal=Human Communication Research|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=70–91|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1991.tb00529.x|issn=0360-3989}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Stein|first1=Catherine H.|last2=Bush|first2=Ellen G.|last3=Ross|first3=Ronald R.|last4=Ward|first4=Marcia|date=1992|title=Mine, Yours and Ours: A Configural Analysis of the Networks of Married Couples in Relation to Marital Satisfaction and Individual Well-Being|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|language=en-US|volume=9|issue=3|pages=365–383|doi=10.1177/0265407592093003|s2cid=144879334|issn=0265-4075}}</ref> Network overlap increases as couples transition to cohabitation, and remarriages tend to have less overlap than first marriages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kalmijn|first=Matthijs|date=2003-07-01|title=Shared friendship networks and the life course: an analysis of survey data on married and cohabiting couples|journal=Social Networks|volume=25|issue=3|pages=231–249|doi=10.1016/S0378-8733(03)00010-8|issn=0378-8733}}</ref> Additionally, one finding suggests that more equal numbers of each partner's family contained in the overlapping network is associated with higher marital satisfaction for heterosexual couples.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Julien|first1=Danielle|last2=Chartrand|first2=Elise|last3=Bégin|first3=Jean|date=1999|title=Social Networks, Structural Interdependence, and Conjugal Adjustment in Heterosexual, Gay, and Lesbian Couples|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=61|issue=2|pages=516–530|doi=10.2307/353766|issn=0022-2445|jstor=353766}}</ref>

Other structural measures have received relatively less attention in the study of intimate relationships. Research shows a positive association between duocentric network size and marital satisfaction.<ref name=":5" /> Additionally, marriages in which both spouses are in their first marriage have larger networks than marriages in which both spouse is [[Remarriage|remarried]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kurdek|first=Lawrence A.|date=1989|title=Social Support and Psychological Distress in First-Married and Remarried Newlywed Husbands and Wives|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=51|issue=4|pages=1047–1052|doi=10.2307/353215|issn=0022-2445|jstor=353215}}</ref> Other studies have highlighted non-results, including that social network density is not associated with relationship satisfaction<ref name="Rogler 1986 693–701"/> and that density is not associated with marital role segregation (a refutation of the Bott Hypothesis).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Udry|first1=J.

The link between compositional duocentric network factors and intimate relationships is less well-studied. However, evidence from duocentric analyses suggest that discord with in-laws predicts lower satisfaction, commitment, and stability in marriages over time.<ref name=":4" /> Additionally, support and approval from the social network tends to be associated with higher commitment and marital satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=James E.|last2=Ogolsky|first2=Brian G.|date=2017-05-19|title=Effects of Network Approval on Accounts of Commitment Trajectories in Intraracial and Interracial Relationships|journal=Marriage & Family Review|volume=53|issue=4|pages=347–364|doi=10.1080/01494929.2016.1184210|s2cid=147767370|issn=0149-4929}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Yuliana|last2=Helms|first2=Heather M.|last3=Supple|first3=Andrew J.|last4=Hengstebeck|first4=Natalie D.|s2cid=145756132|date=2016-09-01|title=Mexican Immigrant Wives' Acculturative Stress and Spouses' Marital Quality: The Role of Wives' Marriage Work With Husbands and Close Friends|journal=Journal of Family Issues|language=en|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1678–1702|doi=10.1177/0192513X14561519|issn=0192-513X}}</ref>

=== Application to other fields ===
Duocentric social network analyses have been used less often outside the context of intimate relationships. One of the earliest examples examined the frequency with which two people mutually named one another in their respective network reports.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Muriel|date=1984-12-01|title=Explorations into the meaning of social network interview data|journal=Social Networks|volume=6|issue=4|pages=341–371|doi=10.1016/0378-8733(84)90008-X|issn=0378-8733}}</ref> The study recruited one person who listed their network members, then those network members were contacted and asked to list their own network members. About 86% of the time, people named by the original interviewee also named that interviewee on their own list. Another study of parents of children with brain tumors found that overlap of non-kin was near 50%, while overlap for kin was slightly higher.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Veiel|first1=H.O.F.|last2=Crisand|first2=M.|last3=Stroszeck-Somschor|first3=H.|last4=Herrie|first4=J.|date=1991|title=Social Support Networks of Chronically Strained Couples: Similarity and Overlap|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|language=en-US|volume=8|issue=2|pages=279–292|doi=10.1177/0265407591082007|s2cid=145345616|issn=0265-4075}}</ref> More peripheral overlapping ties (i.e., those to whom the couple is less close) was associated with lower rates of mental health disorders. Another study examined duocentric networks in [[sibling]] pairs aged 7–13.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McGuire|first1=Shirley|last2=Segal|first2=Nancy L.|date=2013|title=Peer Network Overlap in Twin, Sibling, and Friend Dyads|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=84|issue=2|pages=500–511|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01855.x|pmid=22994629|issn=1467-8624}}</ref> [[Twin|Monozygotic twins]] had the most overlap in their peer networks (82%), followed by same-sex dizygotic twins (67%), same-sex virtual twins (e.g., unrelated peers matched on certain characteristics; 62%), friend-friend pairs (48%), opposite-sex dizygotic twins (42%), same-sex full siblings (39%), opposite sex virtual twins (37%), and opposite-sex full siblings (27%). Genetics, sex (same- or opposite-sex), age, and relationship intimacy affected rates of peer overlap. Another example used pairs of [[corporation]]s engaged in a business alliance as the focal unit, and found that the more common partners (i.e., overlap) between the two firms, the less likely their alliance would dissolve.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Polidoro|first1=Francisco|last2=Ahuja|first2=Gautam|last3=Mitchell|first3=Will|s2cid=7529504|date=2011|title=When the Social Structure Overshadows Competitive Incentives: The Effects of Network Embeddedness on Joint Venture Dissolution|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=54|issue=1|pages=203–223|doi=10.5465/AMJ.2011.59215088}}</ref>

== Variants of duocentric network analyses ==
Kennedy et al. (2015) outline the most rigorous duocentric network study as one in which both members of the dyad report the specific individuals contained in their social networks.<ref name=":1" /> However, the time and cost of this form of data collection has led researchers to use less stringent techniques to gather information on a dyadic network.

=== Global Network Perceptions ===
Rather than asking respondents to list the specific people contained in their social network, researchers occasionally ask for global perceptions of network qualities from both members of a dyad. This methodology limits many structural analyses because the relationships between network members is unknown, unless the structural qualities are addressed at a global level (e.g., for global perceptions of overlap, see Kearns & Leonard (2004)<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kearns|first1=Jill N.|last2=Leonard|first2=Kenneth E.|date=2004|title=Social networks, structural interdependence, and marital quality over the transition to marriage: a prospective analysis|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|volume=18|issue=2|pages=383–395|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.18.2.383|issn=0893-3200|pmid=15222845}}</ref>). Therefore, these studies typically highlight how compositional network aspects affect the dyad. For example, in the study of intimate relationship research, this methodology has been used to show how global perceptions of approval from the network vary across relationship stage,<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last1=Sprecher|first1=Susan|last2=Felmlee|first2=Diane|date=2000|title=Romantic partners'perceptions of social network attributes with the passage of time and relationship transitions|journal=Personal Relationships|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=325–340|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.2000.tb00020.x|issn=1475-6811}}</ref> closeness to family predicts changes in marital happiness,<ref name=":6" /> the degree to which liking one's partner's family predicts relationship dissolution,<ref name=":7" /> the effect of network support on relationship satisfaction,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Julien|first1=Danielle|last2=Markman|first2=Howard J.|date=1991|title=Social Support and Social Networks as Determinants of Individual and Marital Outcomes|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=8|issue=4|pages=549–568|doi=10.1177/026540759184006|s2cid=144744331|issn=0265-4075}}</ref> and the relationship between time spent with the network and relationship commitment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Canary|first1=Daniel J.|last2=Stafford|first2=Laura|last3=Semic|first3=Beth A.|date=2002|title=A Panel Study of the Associations Between Maintenance Strategies and Relational Characteristics|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|language=en|volume=64|issue=2|pages=395–406|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2002.00395.x|issn=1741-3737}}</ref>

=== Single Ego Reporting ===
Another variant of the duocentric network approach is to interview only one member of a focal dyad, but require the individual to report on both their own and the other person's social network, or the other individual's relationship to their own network. In many of these studies, respondents report global network perceptions. For example, one study asked respondents to report on the propensity for a respondent's relationship partner to receive support from their own network (a ''global'' measure of support).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dainton|first=Marianne|date=2015-12-01|title=An Interdependence Approach to Relationship Maintenance in Interracial Marriage|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286767372|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=71|issue=4|pages=772–787|doi=10.1111/josi.12148}}</ref> Support was positively associated with relationship satisfaction. Another study asked respondents to report their perception of approval from their relationship partner's family (another global measure), which was found to be negatively associated with relationship dissolution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Felmlee|first=Diane H.|date=2001|title=No Couple Is an Island: A Social Network Perspective on Dyadic Stability|journal=Social Forces|volume=79|issue=4|pages=1259–1287|issn=0037-7732|jstor=2675472|doi=10.1353/sof.2001.0039|s2cid=143576063}}</ref>

However, some research utilizes specific alter reporting in a single ego methodology. Milardo (1982) asked respondents to report their romantic partner's relationship to each of their own, specific, network members.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Milardo|first=Robert M.|date=1982|title=Friendship Networks in Developing Relationships: Converging and Diverging Social Environments|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=45|issue=3|pages=162–172|doi=10.2307/3033649|issn=0190-2725|jstor=3033649}}</ref> This method allowed the researcher to understand how much of the ego's social network overlapped with his or her partner without collecting information from the partner. However, this approach risks the ego inaccurately reporting the relationship between their partner and the individual network members.<ref name=":0" /> Another study asked homeless youth to list recent sexual partners, other non-sexual partner network members, and the relationships between these alters.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kennedy|first1=David P.|last2=Tucker|first2=Joan S.|last3=Green|first3=Harold D.|last4=Golinelli|first4=Daniela|last5=Ewing|first5=Brett|date=2012|title=Unprotected sex of homeless youth: results from a multilevel dyadic analysis of individual, social network, and relationship factors|journal=AIDS and Behavior|volume=16|issue=7|pages=2015–2032|doi=10.1007/s10461-012-0195-0|issn=1573-3254|pmc=3434273|pmid=22610421}}</ref> The risk of unprotected sex was higher to the degree that sexual partners knew other members of the youth's social network.
