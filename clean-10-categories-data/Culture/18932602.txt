The '''Adam Mickiewicz Institute''' ({{lang-pl|Instytut Adama Mickiewicza}}) is a government-sponsored organization funded by [[Poland]]'s [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and National Heritage]], and headquartered at ''ulica Mokotowska 25'' (the [[Sugar Palace]]) in [[Warsaw]].

Named after Polish [[List of national poets#Europe|national poet]] [[Adam Mickiewicz]], its goal is to promote the [[Polish language]] and [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]] abroad.<ref>[http://www.iam.pl/en/about-us/about-the-institute Adam Mickiewicz Institute: About us] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212025613/http://www.iam.pl/en/about-us/about-the-institute |date=February 12, 2013 }}</ref>  The Institute operates a trilingual Polish-English-Russian portal, "[[Culture.pl]]", founded in 2001.

==Activities==
Besides a large number of associated poets, essayists, writers, translators, artists; literary, music, and film critics; and curators, the Institute includes [[Barbara Schabowska]], the Director (the former were [[Krzysztof Olendzki]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classicalsource.com/db_control/db_news.php?id=3993|title=Ambassador Krzysztof Olendzki appointed Director of the Adam Mickiewicz Institute @www.classicalsource.com|website=classicalsource.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref> and [[Paweł Potoroczyn]]),<ref name="Potoroczyn">{{cite web|url=http://www.iam.pl/en/about-us/structure/director.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130705192621/http://www.iam.pl/en/about-us/structure/director.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-07-05 |title=Director: Paweł Potoroczyn |publisher=Instytut Adama Mickiewicza |date=2013 |access-date=2013-05-09 |author=IAM }}</ref> as well as three deputy directors and number of key projects and programmes managers.

In addition to the Ministry-of-Culture-sponsored Adam Mickiewicz Institute, there are Polish Cultural Institutes, sponsored by the [[Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msz.gov.pl/Instytuty,Polskie,20909.html |title=Instytuty Polskie |publisher=Msz.gov.pl |access-date=2012-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216225043/http://www.msz.gov.pl/Instytuty%2CPolskie%2C20909.html |archivedate=2012-02-16 }}</ref> in over 22 major foreign cities, including [[Berlin]], [[Bratislava]], [[Budapest]], [[Bucharest]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Kiev]], [[Leipzig]], [[London]], [[Minsk]], [[Moscow]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Prague]], [[Rome]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Sofia]], [[Stockholm]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Vienna]], and [[Vilnius]].

While the Adam Mickiewicz Institute frequently collaborates with the Polish Cultural Institutes, each institution is independent of the other and is sponsored by a different Polish government ministry.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101230021524/http://www.culture.pl/en/culture/instytucje/instytuty_polskie Polish Cultural Institutes around the world - arranged according to cities in an alphabetical order.] Internet Archive.
