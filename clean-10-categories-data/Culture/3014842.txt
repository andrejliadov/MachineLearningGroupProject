An '''infinity pool''' or '''infinity edge pool''' is a [[reflecting pool|reflecting]] or [[swimming pool]] where the water flows over one or more edges, producing a visual effect of water with no boundary. Such pools are often designed so that the edge appears to merge with a larger body of water such as the ocean, or with the sky. They are often seen at resorts, estates, and in other luxurious places.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hiller |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.expressnews.com/lifestyle/home-garden/article/Ready-to-take-the-pool-plunge-6160832.php |title=Ready to take the pool plunge? |work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |date=March 27, 2015 |accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Neal J. |last=Leitereg |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-chris-bosh-mansion-20150326-story.html |title=Chris Bosh drops price on hilltop estate in Pacific Palisades |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 7, 2015 |accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Osborne |first=Claudia |url=http://travelingsage.com/14-enchanting-infinity-pools/ |title=14 Enchanting Infinity Pools That Are Built to Take Your Breath Away |publisher=Traveling Sage |date=March 4, 2015 |accessdate=May 25, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092440/http://travelingsage.com/14-enchanting-infinity-pools/ |archivedate=2015-05-18}}</ref>

==History==
It has been claimed{{By whom|date=April 2019}} that the infinity pool concept originated in [[France]], and that one of the first vanishing-edge designs was the Stag Fountain at the [[Palace of Versailles]], built in the late 17th century.<ref name=green>{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Linda G.|title=Infinity Edge Pools All the Rage|url=http://www.poolspanews.com/business/infinity-edge-pools-all-the-rage_o|accessdate=2018-04-11|work=Pool and Spa News|publisher=Hanley Wood Media|date=2013-06-28}}</ref> In the US, architect [[John Lautner]] has been credited as one of the first to come up with an infinity pool design in the early 1960s. He included infinity pools in various residential projects, and also created the vanishing-edge pool in the 1971 James Bond movie ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''.<ref name=green/>

Infinity pools are expensive and require extensive structural, mechanical, and architectural detailing.{{fact|date=February 2017}} Since they are often built in precarious locations, sound [[structural engineering]] is paramount. The high cost of these pools often arises from the elaborate foundation systems that anchor them to hillsides.{{fact|date=February 2017}}

The "infinite" edge of the pool terminates at a [[weir]] that is {{convert|1/16|to|1/4|in|0}} lower than the required pool water level. A trough or [[catch basin]] is constructed below the weir. The water spills into the catch basin, from where it is pumped back into the pool.
