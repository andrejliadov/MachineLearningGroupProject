{{short description|Mythological hero who changes the world through invention or discovery}}
A '''culture hero''' is a [[mythological]] [[hero]] specific to some group ([[Culture|cultural]], [[Ethnic group|ethnic]], [[Religion|religious]], etc.) who changes the world through [[invention]] or [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]. Although many culture heroes help with the creation of the world, most culture heroes are important because of their effect on the world after creation. A typical culture hero might be credited as the [[Theft of fire|discoverer of fire]], [[agriculture]], [[Folk music|songs]], [[tradition]], [[law]] or [[Religious founder|religion]], and is usually the most important legendary figure of a people, sometimes as the founder of its ruling [[dynasty]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Scott|first=William Henry|date=1964|title=The Legend of Biag, an Igorot Culture Hero|journal=Asian Folklore Studies|volume=23|issue=1|pages=93â€“110|doi=10.2307/1177639|issn=0385-2342|jstor=1177639}}</ref>

In many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] mythologies and beliefs, the [[coyote]] spirit stole fire from the gods (or stars or sun) and is more of a [[trickster]] than a culture hero. Natives from the Southeastern United States typically saw a [[rabbit]] trickster/culture hero, and [[Haida mythology|Pacific Northwest native stories]] often feature a [[raven]] in this role: in some stories, Raven steals fire from his uncle Beaver and eventually gives it to humans. The [[Western Africa]]n trickster spider [[Ananse]] is also common. In Norse mythology, [[Odin]] steals the [[mead of poetry]] from [[Jotunheim]] and is credited as the discoverer of the [[runes]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|ref=harv|last=Long|first=Jerome H.|editor=Lindsay Jones |display-editors=etal|title=Culture Heroes|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA: Thomas Gale|year=2005|volume=3|edition=second}}</ref>

== Culture heroes in mythology ==

=== History of a culture hero ===
The term "culture hero" was first brought about by historian [[Kurt Breysig]]; however, he used the German word ''heilbringer,'' which translates to 'savior'. Over the years, "culture hero" has been interpreted in many ways. Older interpretations by Breysig, [[Paul Ehrenreich]], and [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] thought that the journeys of culture heroes were ways in which humans could attempt to understand things in nature, such as the rising and setting of the sun, or the movement of the stars and constellations. Their interpretations eventually got rejected and replaced with newer interpretations by scholars such as [[Hermann Baumann (social anthropologist)|Hermann Baumann]], [[Adolf Ellegard Jensen|Adolf E. Jensen]], [[Mircea Eliade]], Otto Zerries, [[Raffaele Pettazzoni]], and Harry Tegnaeus which evolved as a result of having more access to ethnological data, creating the present day and famously known version of the culture hero.<ref name=":0" />

=== Creation of a culture hero ===
A culture hero is able to perform unbelievable tasks in life because they are different from the normal human. It is often believed that the culture hero is not from this world. All of a culture hero's power originates from their birth. Culture heroes are rarely born regularly. When their mothers get pregnant, it is not because of a man but instead is the result of the wind, or a drop of water. Once a culture hero is born, they are either very powerful babies or even come out of the womb as already full grown. The main point this makes is that the culture hero is not from this world.<ref name=":0" />

=== Characteristics of a culture hero ===
A culture hero generally goes on an adventure (often called the [[hero's journey]]) that in turn does one of the following:

* Saves humankind from a dangerous monster
* Shapes the world (rivers, mountains, etc...)
* Creates distinction between humans and animals
* Makes economic life possible for humans (teaching the humans)
* Sets the origin of death

Culture heroes often have more than one form, such as having the ability to transform from human to some form of animal, such as a fish or bird. A culture hero has many good qualities about him/her but also has bad ones as well which is why they must go on their journeys. In some journeys the hero is known as a [[trickster]]. They act in their own selfish way and the benefits from what they have done ends up being shared with the humans as a side effect.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/|title=Encyclopedia.com {{!}} Free Online Encyclopedia|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>

=== Disappearance of a culture hero ===
Once the culture hero has finished their task, they usually end up disappearing. In many stories, the hero is transformed back to their origin. Other times the place they die will be marked with a stone, tree, or body of water. The end of a culture hero's life will lead to the creation of something else, such as a river, constellations, food, animals, and the moon and sun. Culture heroes are the [[Etiology|etiological]] explanation for many humans about the things occurring in their daily lives.<ref name=":1" />
