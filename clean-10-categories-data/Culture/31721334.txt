'''Counter-flow''' (also called contraflow) refers to the movement of culture that runs counter to the traditional dominant-to-dominated ("West to rest") cultural adaptation patterns. In a contraflow situation, cultural elements brought into a society by immigrants become accepted and popular among the society at large. Examples include the world-wide popularity of [[telenovelas]], [[anime]] and [[K-Pop]].

==History==
Unlike [[transculturation]], counter-flows (or contra-flow) is not the mixing or meshing of two cultures. Rather, contra-flow is about the movement of cultures, like a two-way traffic lane, where individuals are said to live "between cultures".<ref name=Thussu>{{cite book|editor-last=Thussu|editor-first=Daya Kishan|title=Media on the Move: Global flow and contra-flow|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=9780415354585}}</ref>{{rp|1}} The term contra-flow originated from the preceding peripheries of global media industries, designated "sub-altern flows".<ref name=Thussu/>{{rp|5}} More importantly, contra-flows emerged because of the global mass media reversing the dominant Western, First World direction, in other words it is no longer from "the West to the rest",<ref name=Thussu/>{{rp|50}} It can also be said that counter-flows originated because of colonization and later on because of diaspora. The existence of this diaspora – which is on the point of becoming the largest “minority” in the U.S. and which will eventually constitute the majority group in America’s largest state, California – has encouraged the rapid rise of Spanish-language channels such as [[Telemundo]] and [[Univision]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bicket|first=Douglas|date=2005|title=Reconsidering Geocultural Contraflow: Intercultural Information Flows Through Trends in Global Audiovisual Trade|url=http://www.globalmediajournal.com/%20peer-reviewed/%20reconsidering-geocultural-contraflow-intercultural-information-flows-through-trends-in-global-audiovisual-trade-35122.html|journal=Global Media Journal|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|issn=1550-7521}}</ref>

[[Colonization]] brought a new language and religious beliefs to the Americas. On the one hand, a new way of living was taken in by the indigenous people, but on the other, they retained part of their language that is still used today such as the words "[[maize]]" and "[[Avocado|aguacate]]", among others. Additionally, just like the indigenous people, colonizers acquired something from the colonized; they brought back with them goods from the Americans such as potatoes and corn. Through colonization, we can see counter-flows being born and take action because of the consumption, fluidity, and flexibility of culture in both directions, from the colonizer to the colonized and vice versa.

==Example of contra-flow media==

Contra or counter-flows, through media, have had a positive and negative impact on migrant communities. As mentioned before, counter-flows is the movement of culture, not only one way but a two-way movement. Furthermore, media is a major source of communication and information that reaches hundreds of homes across the country. The term counter-flows is especially applied and seen in the Latino communities located all throughout the United States.

A positive example of contra-flow media are telenovelas or soap operas. Telenovelas have become global because of the leading producers of telenovelas such as [[Televisa]] in Mexico, [[Venevision]] in Venezuela, and [[Globo TV]] in Brazil, reaching hundreds of homes all around the globe. Through these leading networks, migrant communities are able to obtain information and watch entertainment shows from their native land.

''[[Yo Soy Betty La Fea]]'', a telenovela originally from Colombia, has become a success not only in its native country but in more than seventy countries in three different continents.<ref name="emilyhighet.com">Highet, Emily. "Yo Soy Betty La Fea is Beautiful in the United States." University of New South Wales, http://www.emilyhighet.com/uploads/5/8/4/2/5842260/yo_soy_betty_la_fea_is_beautiful_in_the_united_states.doc{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (p. 1)</ref> In the United States, for example, the telenovela aired on the [[Telemundo]] network for Latino communities in the United States. After its grand success, other United States networks became interested in creating or remaking the telenovela by naming it ''Ugly Betty'', but for an English-speaking audience. However, the producers of ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' made sure to still maintain the plot and some of the main characteristics from the original ''Yo Betty La Fea'' telenovela to retain the Hispanic fans and audience.<ref>Highet, Emily. "Yo Soy Betty La Fea is Beautiful in the United States." University of New South Wales, http://www.emilyhighet.com/uploads/5/8/4/2/5842260/yo_soy_betty_la_fea_is_beautiful_in_the_united_states.doc{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (p. 3)</ref> By maintaining some of the characteristics, producers hope that the English-speaking Latino communities are able to relate with the main character, Betty, because of the fact that she is a Latino woman living in the United States with an immigrant father.

''Yo Soy Betty La Fea'' is a great example of contra-flow media because of the increasing exportation of telenovelas to the United States and other countries not familiar or culturally similar to Latin America. ''Ugly Betty'' also shows the reverse media imperialism which is "the term focused on the one-way flow of information from the United States to the rest of the world with complete disregard for the importance of counter-flows generated by television exporters in other parts of the world".<ref name="emilyhighet.com"/>

=== Al-Jazeera ===
Another example of contra-flow media is the [[Qatar|Qatari]]-based news outlet [[Al Jazeera|Al-Jazeera]]. The outlet is among the first channels to contest the monopoly of Western-dominated global TV news journalism.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Wessler|first=Hartmut|last2=Adolphsen|first2=Manuel|date=2008-07-01|title=Contra-flow from the Arab world?

The station was applauded for its pioneering role in heralding and popularizing such concepts as political debate, press freedom and Western journalistic standards in the Arab world. It has also been praised for its ‘relative’ independence from political influences, even though it still is a state-financed station.<ref name=":2" />

The news outlet made an ambitious attempt at breaking into the American market in 2013, and aimed to compete with the established news outlets. [[Al Jazeera America|Al-Jazeera America]] was taken off the air in 2016,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Farhi|first=Paul|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/al-jazeera-america-news-channel-to-close-up-shop/2016/01/13/aa3ab180-ba1f-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d_story.html|title=Al Jazeera America: Was the TV news network cursed from the start?|date=2016-01-13|work=Washington Post|access-date=2020-04-27|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> with the reason cited as the current "economic landscape."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/al-jazeera-america-shut-down-855477|title=Al Jazeera America to Shut Down|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref> The failure of Al-Jazeera America shows how challenging it is for non-American based networks to gain traction and establish legitimacy in the United States. The hostile media environment and tendency of Americans to selectively expose themselves to media that fits their viewpoint is another factor cited in a 2015 study conducted by Tal Samuel-Azran and Tsahi Hayat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samuel-Azran|first=Tal|last2=Hayat|first2=Tsahi|date=2017-10-05|title=Counter-hegemonic contra-flow and the Al Jazeera America fiasco: A social network analysis of Al Jazeera America’s Twitter users:|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1742766517734255?casa_token=YsqPpxXA2aMAAAAA%3A7AYpHh4x6nshd5m17JiwDQIWtMscR8kdT83188VAvCDjKwdj3ZNazjsO4PBIOdXvXLvWGU-3TL8-Nk8|journal=Global Media and Communication|language=en|doi=10.1177/1742766517734255}}</ref> The study examined the network's Twitter following, and showed that 42 percent of Al-Jazeera America’s followers did not follow any other US news outlet, and that most of the remaining 58 percent followed liberal stations. 

==La Mara Salvatrucha as counter-flows==
La [[Mara Salvatrucha]] is a negative example of counter-flow. This Latin gang originated from Los Angeles California after Salvadoran migrants left their country in the early 1980s due to the civil war. La Mara Salvatrucha (or MS-13) has a reputation of being the world's most dangerous gang. The flow of La Mara Salvatrucha gang members between the United States and El Salvador has created a transnational empire of power and control supported by violence. Members from MS-13 keep in constant contact with members in El Salvador. Among the criminal activities that they operate in both the US an El Salvador are robbery, muggings, extortion, drug trafficking, the distribution of weapons, human trafficking and murder. They are protective with their business empire while keeping in touch through technology. According to Tina Strickland the gang members stay in contact by "using disposable cell phones and the Internet, both of which are readily available at low cost".<ref>Strickland, S., Tina. “Mara Salvatrucha: A Threat to U.S. and Central American Security.” The World’s Most Threatening Terrorist Networks and Criminal Gangs, New York, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009, p. 252.</ref> Many of the members do not have technological skills, but there are programs that help them navigate.

===La Mara in the media===
Through technology, the media has exposed society to issues that are occurring around the world. The media does not hesitate to expose violence through the news, Internet and newspaper magazines. The printing industry and images are a navigation chain to reach out to the world, and La Mara has been on top of the negative exposure. La Mara's exposure to the world has created fear among society. The gang’s history has appeared in different airings, from [[Fox News Channel]], and ''[[Gangland (TV series)|Gangland]]'' on the History Channel.  According to Strickland, "Deportations have helped create an 'unending chain' of gang members moving between the U.S. and Central America. ... it's a merry-go-round".<ref>Strickland, S., Tina. "Mara Salvatrucha: A Threat to U.S. and Central American Security". ''The World’s Most Threatening Terrorist Networks and Criminal Gangs''. New York, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009, p. 262.</ref> Till this day the Salvadoran gang MS-13 is still considered a transnational group through their back and forth movement.

=== Subaltern flows ===
This idea is mentioned by Daya Kishan Thussu in his 2012 article "Mapping Global Media Flow and Contra-Flow". He described the subaltern flows as "originators of transnational media flows have a strong regional presence but are also aimed at audiences outside their primary constituency."<ref name=Thussu2012>{{cite book|last=Thussu|first=Daya|chapter=Mapping Global Media Flow and Contra-Flow|title=The Globalization Reader|editor1-first=Frank|editor1-last=Lechner|editor2-first=John|editor2-last=Boli|edition=Fourth|pages=352-357|location=Oxford|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2012}}</ref> To better describe "subaltern flows", he mentioned the [[CCTV-9]] as an example. CCTV-9 is an English language network of China Central Television broadcasting since 2011 because the official language used there is English. The potential viewers of CCTV-9 are in two major groups, the foreigner in China and the overseas Chinese. As Thussu argued in 2012: "the expansion of CCTV-9, reflects the recognition by the Beijing authorities of the importance of the English language as the key to success for global commerce and communication and their strategy to bring Chinese public diplomacy to a global audience."<ref name=Thussu2012/>

=== Dominant flows ===
Thussu explained this idea in his article "Mapping Global Media Flow and Contra-Flow" as "the US-led Western media, both online and offline, and in various forms –information, infotainment and entertainment – are global in their reach and influence."<ref name=Thussu2012/> He also provides three examples of "dominant media flows" in his article which is media from the United States that "available across the global"; media from Britain which is a "major presence in global media, particularly in the field of news and current affairs"; and [[Anime|Japanese animation]] which is "the only non-Western genre".<ref name=Thussu2012/> However, more recent research has also discussed [[K-pop]] and Korean ''[[Korean wave|Hallyu]]'' as becoming another dominant non-Western genre.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Kimery S|date=2020-09-30|title=Fans as transcultural gatekeepers: The hierarchy of BTS’ Anglophone Reddit fandom and the digital East-West media flow|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444820962109|journal=New Media & Society|language=en|pages=146144482096210|doi=10.1177/1461444820962109|issn=1461-4448}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Chin|first=Bertha|title=Advancing transcultural fandom|date=2017-11-03|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781317268260/chapters/10.4324/9781315637518-36|work=The Routledge Companion to Media Fandom|pages=298–306|editor-last=Click|editor-first=Melissa A.|edition=1|publisher=Routledge|language=en|doi=10.4324/9781315637518-36|isbn=978-1-315-63751-8|access-date=2020-10-14|last2=Punathambekar|first2=Aswin|last3=Shresthova|first3=Sangita|editor2-last=Scott|editor2-first=Suzanne}}</ref> These are all considered as major dominant media flows that have extended their influence in a global content.
