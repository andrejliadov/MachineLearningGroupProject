'''Transculturation''' is a term coined by Cuban anthropologist [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] in 1940 (from the article Our America by [[José Martí]])<ref>[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf Ortiz 1995], pp. v, 97</ref> to describe the phenomenon of merging and converging cultures. Transculturation encompasses more than transition from one culture to another; it does not consist merely of acquiring another culture (acculturation) or of losing or uprooting a previous culture (deculturation).  Rather, it merges these concepts and instead carries the idea of the consequent creation of new cultural phenomena (neoculturation)<ref>{{Harvnb|Ortiz|1995|pp=102–103|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf}}</ref> in which the blending of cultures is understood as producing something entirely new.

Although transculturation is somewhat inevitable, cultural hegemony has historically shaped this process. Particularly, Ortiz referred to the devastating effects of Spanish colonialism on Cuba's indigenous peoples as a "failed transculturation". Further, he affirmed "that when cultures encounter each other, each of the parties invariably exerts a strong influence on the other(s)."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hermann|first=Elfriede|date=2007-12-01|title=Communicating with Transculturation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/jso.980|journal=Journal de la société des océanistes|issue=125|pages=257–260|doi=10.4000/jso.980|issn=0300-953X|doi-access=free}}</ref> Transculturation is often the result of colonial conquest and subjugation. In a postcolonial era, the effects of this oppression remain, as native peoples struggle to regain their own sense of identity. On the other hand, new musical genres have often emerged as a result of transculturation. In reference to Cuba in particular, there exists a mixture between European and African musics as "African slaves left a major imprint on Cuban society, especially in the area of Cuban popular music."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boggs|first=Vernon W.|date=24 July 2008|title=Musical transculturation: From Afro‐Cuban to Afro‐Cubanization, Popular Music and Society|journal=Popular Music and Society}}</ref>

Where transculturation affects ethnicity and ethnic issues, the term "ethnoconvergence" is sometimes used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In a general sense, transculturation covers [[war]], [[ethnic conflict]], [[racism]], [[multiculturalism]], [[cross-culturalism]], [[interracial marriage]], and any other of a number of contexts that deal with more than one culture. In the other general sense, transculturation is one aspect of global phenomena and human events.

The general processes of transculturation are extremely complex—steered by powerful forces at the macrosocial level, yet ultimately resolved at the interpersonal level. The driving force for conflict is simple [[Proxemics|proximity]]—boundaries, once separating people (providing for a measure of isolation) become the issue of a conflict when societies encroach upon one another territorially. If a means to co-exist cannot be immediately found, then conflicts can be hostile, leading to a process by which contact between individuals leads to some resolution. Often, history shows us, the processes of co-existence begins with hostilities, and with the natural passing of polarist individuals, comes the passing of their polarist sentiments, and soon some resolution is achieved.  Degrees of hostile conflict vary from outright genocidal conquest, to lukewarm infighting between differing political views within the same ethnic community.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

These changes often represent differences between homeland pons, and their [[diasporic]] communities abroad. Obstacles to '''ethnoconvergence''' are not great. The primary issue, [[language]], (''hence, communication and education'') can be overcome within a single generation—as is evident in the easy acclimation of children of foreign parents.  English, for example, is spoken by more non-Anglo-American people than by Anglo-Americans. It has become the current [[lingua-franca]], the worldwide ''de facto'' standard international language.

Processes of transculturation become more complex within the context of [[globalization]], given the multiple layers of abstraction that permeate everyday experiences. Elizabeth Kath argues that in the global era we can no longer consider transculturation only in relation to the face-to-face, but that we need to take into account the many layers of abstracted interactions that are interwoven through face-to-face encounters, a phenomenon that she describes as ''layers of transculturation''.<ref>Kath, Elizabeth (2015) [http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/narratives-of-globalization "On Transculturation: Re-enacting and Remaking Latin Dance and Music in Foreign Lands"] In Julian Lee (Ed) ''Narratives of Globalization: Reflections on the Global Condition.''  Rowman & Littlefield International</ref> Kath draws upon the concept of constitutive abstraction as seen in the work of Australian social theorists Geoff Sharp<ref>Sharp, Geoff (1993) "Extended Forms of the Social", ''Arena,'' 1</ref> and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]].<ref>James, Paul (1996) ''Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community,'' SAGE</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Emotional Ambivalence Across Times and Spaces: Mapping Petrarch's Intersecting Worlds|last = James|first = Paul|date = 2014|journal = Exemplaria|volume = 26}}</ref>

==Homogenization versus ethnoconvergence==

It has been observed that even in monolingual, industrial societies like urban North America, some individuals do cling to a "modernized" primordial identity, apart from others. Some intellectuals, such as [[Michael Ignatieff]], argue that convergence of a general culture does not directly entail a similar convergence in [[ethnic]] identities. This can become evident in social situations, where people divide into separate groups, despite being of an identical "super-ethnicity", such as [[nationality]].

Within each smaller ethnicity, individuals may tend to see it perfectly justified to assimilate with other cultures, and some others view assimilation as wrong and incorrect for their culture. This common theme, representing dualist opinions of ethnoconvergence itself, within a single ethnic group is often manifested in issues of [[sexual partner]]s and [[marriage]], employment preferences, etc. These varied opinions of ethnoconvergence represent themselves in a spectrum; [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[wikt:homogeneous|homogenization]], [[acculturation]], and [[cultural compromise]] are commonly used terms for ethnoconvegence which flavor the issues to a bias.

Often it's in a secular, multi-ethnic environment that cultural concerns are both minimised and exacerbated; Ethnic prides are boasted, hierarchy is created ("center" culture versus "periphery") but on the other hand, they will still share a common "culture", and common language and behaviours. Often the elderly, more conservative-in-association of a clan, tend to reject cross-cultural associations, and participate in ethnically similar community-oriented activities. [[Xenophobia|Xenophobes]] tend to think of cross-cultural contact as a component of assimilation, and see this as harmful.

==Obstacles to ethnoconvergence==

The obstacle to ethnoconvergence is [[ethnocentrism]], which is the view that one's culture is of greater importance than another's. Ethnocentrism often takes different forms, as it is a highly personal bias, and manifests itself in countless aspects of culture. [[Religion]], or belief, is the prime ethnocentric divider. Second is [[convention (norm)|custom]], which often overlaps with religion. With the adherence to each distinct component within ones own culture, comes the repulsion of the other. In most regions, ethnic divides are binary, meaning only two distinct cultures are present, each seeing the other as foreign. Many, however make the point that the binary example is the exception, and the norm is far more dynamic.

Ethnicity can be divided into two distinct areas, as they relate to ethnoconvergence:  Utilitarian traits, and traditional customs.

Religion, on the other hand, is a highly personal and attached part of culture. However, religion does not neatly correspond with ethnic identity. In many [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] societies, religion is everything—social, utilitarian, intellectual, political—from the point of view of people of immersed cultures; the very concept of ethnicity and its distinctions is incongruous to their immersed concepts.

In many societies, such as in those in Europe, languages are considered a significant component of ethnic values. This does not mean that most Europeans reject learning other languages. Quite the contrary, Europeans are often polyglots, and may label other individuals by their ethnicities; practical means of distinguishing cultures may resemble tendencies similar to ethnocentrism.

However, the political and cultural significance of regional or national languages are retained because these polyglots conform to the linguistic norms of the place they visit—doing "as the Romans do". Thus, conforming to the "ethnic integrity" of the region.

It has even become a cliché that "to learn a new language is to adopt a new soul". There are many other examples of the essential significance of language. In pre-[[Russia]]n [[Siberia]], [[Siberian Tatars|Tatar-Mongol]] colonists in the [[Taiga]] often recognized indigenous speakers of [[Turkic languages]] as their "own people" and non-Turkic groups as "foreigners", despite these indigenous groups having a similar level of material culture, and sharing much of a primitive culture with tribes foreign to the Muslim-Buddhist Tatar-Mongols.

==Transcultural communications==

In October 2011, U.S. communications agency [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] launched a new model/[[strategy]] utilizing transcultural [[sociological]] theory as a means to segment and 'make sense' of the changing [[United States|American]] cultural landscape. Returning to classic social science as a solution, [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] has embraced the anthropological approach put forward by thinkers like [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] as a way to account for ethnicity and language without being limited by them as a way for viewing the world.
