'''The Four Companions''', also called '''the Four Pillars of the Sahaba''' is a [[Shia]] term for the four [[Sahaba]] who stayed most loyal to [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] after the death of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]:<ref name=enc2>{{Cite book |url=https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia|chapter=Respecting the Righteous Companions |chapter-url=https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia/respecting-righteous-companions |title=A Shi'ite Encyclopedia |editor1-last=Ali |publisher=Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project |editor1-first=Abbas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603101754/https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia/respecting-righteous-companions |archive-date=3 June 2020 |via=al-islam.org}}</ref><ref name=rasul>{{Cite book|title=History of the Caliphs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YytVCAAAQBAJ |chapter=Umars Caliphate |isbn=9781312541085 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YytVCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT290 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |page=290 |year=2014 |last1=Ja'fariyan |first1=Rasul |via=books.google.com |lay-url=https://www.alseraj.net/maktaba/kotob/english/women/Womenin/al-tawhid/types/shiism.htm |lay-source=alseraj.net |quote=Abu Hatin al-Razi says, "It is the appellation of those who were attached to Ali during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah, such as Salman, Abu Dharr Ghifari, Miqdad ibn al-Aswad and Ammar ibn Yasir and others.

Salman is generally considered to be the loftiest amongst these elite four. It is narrated from [[Muhammad]] that:<ref name=slav>{{Cite book |title=Slavery: Islamic & Western Perspectives |chapter=Slaves in the History of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=puGqDwAAQBAJ |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=puGqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA24 |year=2001 |location=South Africa |publisher= Ahlul Bait (a.s.)

<blockquote>Faith has ten grades, and Salman is on the tenth (i.e., highest) grade, Abu Dharr on the ninth, and Miqdad on the eighth grade.</blockquote>

Those among [[sahaba|Muhammad's companions]] who were closest to both [[Muhammad]] and [[Ali]] were called [[Shia etymology|Shia of Ali]] (partisans of Ali) during Muhammad's lifetime,<ref name=dabashi>{{Cite book|title=Authority in Islam: From the Rise of Mohammad to the Establishment of the Umayyads |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKs0DwAAQBAJ |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKs0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT102 |chapter=The foundations of Sunnite Authority: The Routinization of Charisma |page=102 |isbn=9781351317108 |year=2017 |publisher=Routledge |last1=Dabashi |first1=Hamid |via=books.google.com}}</ref> and it was for these the following [[hadith]] narrated from [[Jabir al-Ansari]] takes root:<ref name=enc>{{Cite book |url=https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia|chapter=The Term Shi'a in Qur'an and Hadith |chapter-url=https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia/term-shia-quran-and-hadith |title=A Shi'ite Encyclopedia |editor1-last=Ali |publisher=Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project |editor1-first=Abbas |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200118095133/https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia/term-shia-quran-and-hadith |archive-date=18 January 2020 |via=al-islam.org}}</ref>
