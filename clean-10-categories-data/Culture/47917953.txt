{{Main|Asherah pole}}
An Asherah pole is a sacred [[tree]] or pole that stood near [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] religious locations to honor the [[Asherah|Ugaritic mother-goddess Asherah]], [[Spouse|consort]] of [[El (deity)|El]].<ref>Sarah Iles Johnston, ed. ''Religions of the Ancient World'', (Belnap Press, Harvard) 2004, p. 418; the book-length scholarly treatment is W.L. Reed, ''The Asherah in the Old Testament'' (Fort Worth: Texas Christian University Press) 1949; the connection of the pillar figurines with Asherah was made by [[Raphael Patai]] in ''[[The Hebrew Goddess]]'' (1967)</ref> The relation of the literary references to an ''asherah'' and archaeological finds of Judaean pillar-figurines has engendered a literature of debate.<ref>Summarized and sharply criticized in Raz Kletter's ''The Judean Pillar-Figurines and the Archaeology of Asherah'' (Oxford: Tempus Reparatum), 1996; Kletter gives a catalogue of material remains but his conclusions were not well received in the scholarly press{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}</ref>

The ''asherim'' were also [[cult object]]s related to the worship of the [[fertility god]]dess Asherah, the consort of either Ba'al or, as inscriptions from [[Kuntillet Ajrud|Kuntillet ‘Ajrud]] and Khirbet el-Qom attest, [[Yahweh (Canaanite deity)|Yahweh]],<ref>W.G. Dever, "Asherah, Consort of Yahweh? New Evidence from Kuntillet ʿAjrûd" ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'',1984; D.N. Freedman, "Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', 1987; [[Morton Smith]], "God Male and Female in the Old Testament: Yahweh and his Asherah" ''Theological Studies'', 1987; J.M. Hadley "The Khirbet el-Qom Inscription", ''Vetus Testamentum'', 1987</ref> and thus objects of contention among competing cults. The insertion of "''pole''" [[begs the question]] by setting up unwarranted expectations for such a wooden object: "we are never told exactly what it was", observes John Day.<ref>John Day, "Asherah in the Hebrew Bible and Northwest Semitic Literature" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''105'''.3 (September 1986:385-408) p 401; ''asherim'' are discussed pp 401-04.</ref> Though there was certainly a movement against goddess-worship at the Jerusalem Temple in the time of King Josiah, it did not long survive his reign, as the following four kings "did what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh" (2 Kings 23:32, 37; 24:9, 19). Further exhortations came from [[Jeremiah]]. The traditional interpretation of the Biblical text is that the Israelites imported pagan elements such as the Asherah poles from the surrounding Canaanites. In light of archeological finds, however, modern scholars now theorize that the Israelite [[folk religion]] was Canaanite in its inception and always polytheistic, and it was the prophets and priests who denounced the Asherah poles who were the innovators;<ref>William G. Dever, ''Did God have a wife?: Archaeology and folk religion in ancient Israel'', 2005, esp. pp</ref> such theories inspire ongoing debate.<ref>Shmuel Ahituv (2006), ''Did God have a wife?'', ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', Book Review</ref>

{{Main|Maypole|Mære Church}}
[[File:Maypole Sweden.jpg|thumb|300px|Dancing around the maypole, in [[Åmmeberg]], Sweden]]
A [[maypole]] is a tall wooden pole erected as a part of various European folk festivals, around which a maypole dance often takes place.

The festivals may occur on [[May Day]] or [[Pentecost]] ([[Whitsun]]), although in some countries it is instead erected at [[Midsummer]]. In some cases the maypole is a permanent feature that is only utilised during the festival, although in other cases it is erected specifically for the purpose before being taken down again.

Primarily found within the nations of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] Europe and the neighbouring areas which they have influenced, its origins remain unknown, although it has been speculated that it originally had some importance in the [[Germanic paganism]]<ref name="Russel Jefferry Burton">{{Cite book |last=Russel |first=Jefferry Burton |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C05LAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243 |title=Medieval Civilisation |date=22 February 2005 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=1-59752-103-5 |location=Eugene |page=243 |orig-year=1968}}</ref> of [[Iron Age]] and early Medieval cultures, and that the tradition survived Christianisation, albeit losing any original meaning that it had. It has been a recorded practice in many parts of Europe throughout the [[Medieval]] and [[Early Modern]] periods, although became less popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, the tradition is still observed in some parts of Europe and among European communities in North America.<ref name="Kelly Cannon">{{Cite news |last=Cannon |first=Kelly |url=http://news.hjnews.com/news/good-neighbor-former-teacher-continues-tradition-of-maypole-dance/article_43e9b2fb-2f30-54b6-aeb3-34398c645005.html |title=Good Neighbor: Former teacher continues tradition of Maypole dance |date=May 21, 2015 |work=From the Good Neighbors series |access-date=28 September 2015 |publisher=The Herald Journal, 75 West 300 North Logan, UT |agency=The Herald Journal's Staff writer |issue=May 21, 2015}}</ref>

The fact that they were found primarily in areas of Germanic Europe, where, prior to Christianisation, [[Germanic paganism]] was followed in various forms, has led to speculation that the maypoles were in some way a continuation of a Germanic pagan tradition.<ref name="Russel Jefferry Burton" /> One theory holds that they were a remnant of the Germanic reverence for sacred trees, as there is evidence for various sacred trees and wooden pillars that were venerated by the pagans across much of Germanic Europe, including [[Thor's Oak]] and the [[Irminsul]].<ref>''A History of Pagan Europe'' by Prudence Jones and Nigel Pennick, Routledge, 1997, {{ISBN|0-415-15804-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-15804-6}}, p. 119.</ref><ref name="James Frazer">{{Cite book |last=Frazer |first=James George |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Golden_Bough |title=The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion |date=1922 |page=Chapter 10:: Relics of Tree Worship in Modern Europe |access-date=28 September 2015}}</ref> It is also known that, in [[Norse paganism]], [[cosmology|cosmological]] views held that the universe was a [[world tree]], known as [[Yggdrasil]].<ref>'The London quarterly review, Volumes 113-114', Theodore Foster, 1863, p. 117.</ref><ref>'The History of Religions' By Hopkins Edward Washburn, The MacMillan Company 1929, p. 166.</ref><ref>''European paganism: the realities of cult from antiquity to the Middle Ages'' by [[Ken Dowden]], Routledge, 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-12034-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-12034-0}}, p. 119.</ref><ref>'Nart sagas from the Caucasus: myths and legends from the Circassians, Abazas, Abkhaz, and Ubykhs' by [[John Colarusso]], Princeton University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-691-02647-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-691-02647-3}}, p. 102.</ref><ref>'The early history and antiquities of Freemasonry: as connected with ancient Norse guilds, and the oriental and mediæval building fraternities' by George Franklin Fort, Bradley, 1881, p. 361.</ref>

The floor of the [[Mære Church]], [[Norway]], was excavated in 1969<ref>Lidén, Hans-Emil. 1969. From Pagan Sanctuary to Christian Church, the Excavation of Mære Church in Trøndelag. Norwegian Archaeological Review. (1969) 2, pp. 3–32.</ref> and found to contain the remains of a pagan cult structure. The nature of that structure was not clear. Lidén felt this represented the remains of a building, but a critique by Olsen (1969:26) in the same work suggested this may have been a site for pole-related rituals. A recent review of the evidence by Walaker (Norddide 2011: 107-113)<ref>Walaker Nordeide, Sæbjorg. 2011. The Viking Age As a Period of Religious Transformation: The Christianization of Norway from AD 560 to 1150/1200. {{ISBN|2503534805}}, Brepols Publishers.</ref> concluded that this site was similar to the site in Hove (Åsen, also in Nord-Trøndelag) and was therefore likely the site of a ceremonial pole.
