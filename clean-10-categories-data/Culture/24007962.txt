<noinclude><!-- THIS LIST OF GENERATIONS MUST NOT CONTAIN ANY GENERATION TITLES THAT DO NOT EXIST AT [[Generation#List of generations]].  DO NOT ADD ANY ADDITIONAL GENERATIONS TO THIS LIST, it is not meant to be a comprehensive list, but just a list of the non-controversial generation types, applying to the United States, which is a narrow categorization --  IF YOU REALLY want to add an item on the list, please gain consensus on the talk page first -- any adds will just be deleted otherwise -->
