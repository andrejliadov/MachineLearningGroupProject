'''Education in the performing arts''' is a key part of many [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] [[curriculum|curricula]] and is also available as a specialisation at the [[tertiary education|tertiary]] level.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The [[performing arts]], which include, but are not limited to [[dance]], [[music]] and [[theatre]], are key elements of [[culture]] and engage participants at a number of levels.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The end point for performing arts education varies: some educators integrate arts into school classrooms to support other curricula while simultaneously building students' art skills, and some focus on performing arts as an academic discipline in itself.<ref name=":0" />

==Performing arts integration==
'''Performing arts integration in schools'''

Integrating performing arts into educational experiences can help students learn other subjects, such as science, as well as help them develop various non-arts-based skills.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Arts-Integration-Teaching-Multicultural-Settings/dp/0132565560|title=Arts Integration: Teaching Subject Matter through the Arts in Multicultural Settings|last=Goldberg|first=Merryl|date=2011-04-11|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780132565561|edition=4|location=Boston|language=English}}</ref> As children grow, engaging them in performance arts can help them meet developmental milestones, including those for [[motor skill]]s and [[Psychosocial|psychosocial skills]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/18985575/childrens-developmental-benchmarks-and-stages|title=Children's Developmental Benchmarks and Stages|last=Yumpu.com|newspaper=yumpu.com|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref> For example, teachers can integrate performing arts and the discussion thereof into their classrooms to honor student [[Self-expression values|self-expression]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/vp/cf/|title=Curriculum Frameworks - Visual & Performing Arts (CA Dept of Education)|website=www.cde.ca.gov|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref> Bilingual youth can benefit from this type of [[arts integration]] because it offers them modes of communication that can respond more easily to their culture and language than text-based or test-based learning.<ref name=":12">{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Arts-Emergent-Bilingual-Youth-Culturally/dp/0415509742|title=The Arts and Emergent Bilingual Youth: Building Culturally Responsive, Critical and Creative Education in School and Community Contexts|last=Chappell|first=Sharon Verner|last2=Faltis|first2=Christian J.|date=2013-04-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415509749|language=English}}</ref> Regardless of the language used, teachers have found that using performing arts in the classroom, such as improvisational drama, can help students process and prepare for non-arts-based life situations, including [[bullying]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Artful-Teaching-Integrating-Understanding-Curriculum/dp/0807750808|title=Artful Teaching: Integrating the Arts for Understanding Across the Curriculum, K-8|last=Donahue|first=David M.|date=2010-06-02|publisher=Teachers College Press|isbn=9780807750803|editor-last=Stuart|editor-first=Jennifer|location=New York; Reston, VA|language=English}}</ref>

'''Performing arts integration out of schools'''

Performing arts integration that empowers students in these ways doesn't only happen in schools; community organizations, such as the Beat Nation Collective in Canada, use hip hop performance to help students deepen their understanding of and broaden their experience with indigenous identity and language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorliewski|first=Julie|last2=Porfilio|first2=Brad|year=2012|title=Revolutionizing Environmental Education through Indigenous Hip Hop Culture|journal=Canadian Journal of Environmental Education|volume=17|pages=46â€“61}}</ref>

'''Issues of access and equity'''

Despite the benefits of engaging students in performing arts, many students, particularly minority students such as African American and Latino students, do not have equitable access to performing arts in their school classrooms.<ref name=":12"/>

==Discipline-based performing arts==

The performing arts differ from the [[plastic arts]] insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and/or presence as a medium Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]] by special [[clothing]], [[cosmetics|stage makeup]], etc.

For students pursuing elite [[profession]]al [[career]]s in performing arts like [[classical ballet]] and [[circus]] arts, the physical demands are such that early entry into training can be essential.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}
