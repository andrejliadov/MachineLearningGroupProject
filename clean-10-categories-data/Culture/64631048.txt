The history of '''Islam in the Arctic''' starts relatively late in the chronology of [[Islamic history]], the [[Arctic Circle]] being at a great distance from traditional Muslim bastions of power and settlement.

The Egyptian professor M. G.

<!--In 922 AD, the explorer [[Ibn Fadlan]] referenced that new converts to Islam in [[Tatarstan]] had to deal with irregularities of the sunrise and sunset, which was confirmed four hundred years later by [[Ibn Battuta]] as he traveled the region, and noted the locals believed the [[Northern Lights]] were battles between the righteous and irreligious [[djinn]] spirits.<ref name="full" /><ref>https://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/197902/ibn.fadlan.and.the.midnight.sun.htm</ref>-->

A study from 2019 described Muslim communities in Arctic Russia as "rapidly growing" in the last two decades. An early attempt to build a mosque in a major city ([[Yakutsk]], about {{convert|450|km|sp=us}} south of the [[Arctic Circle]]) failed upon the outbreak of the [[First World War]] and the following [[October Revolution]]. In 1996, however, it became the site of the world's largest mosque in the far north, capable of holding 3000 worshipers.<ref name="full" />

Siberian [[Mullah]]s since the 19th century were hesitant to recognise distant authority.<ref name="full" /> After the 1991 [[Collapse of the Soviet Union]], three central Muslim directorates competed for control of the Islamic population in Siberia, the far East and the far North; one of these three was absorbed into another, leaving the CDUMR and the Council of Muftis—the latter seen as closely tied to the Russian government.<ref name="full" /> In 1998, the first mosque was built for the industrial city of [[Norilsk]], and by 2007 the Muslims in the city were estimated at 20% of the population, coming from [[Dagestan]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Azerbaijan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-muslims-russia-arctic-idUSL1072493620070415|title=Arctic mosque stays open but Muslim numbers shrink |first=Robin |last=Paxton |date=15 April 2007 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date=30 July 2020}}</ref>

Nearly every Arctic city in Russia has a Muslim presence as of 2019, and the 59 [[mosque]]s and [[musalla]]s spread across the Arctic exist in every region except for the  [[Nenets Autonomous Okrug]] and [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]].<ref name="full" /> A periodical journal named ''Islam in Yakutia'' is printed in [[Neryungri]].<ref name="full" /> In 2014, it was noted that a large number of ethnic Russians in [[Tyumen]], which boasts 30 northern mosques, seemed to be converting to [[Islam]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Laruelle |first1=Marlene |title=New Mobilities and Social Changes in Russia's Arctic Regions |date=2 August 2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781138191471 }}</ref>

Challenges to the Muslim presence are of different kinds. The Arctic city of [[Vorkuta]] had a strong [[skinhead]] and [[white nationalist]] scene in the 1990s and 2000s, and a Russian nationalist group protested against the mosque there.<ref name="full" /> The [[Yamal Peninsula]] has a [[meat processing]] business run by Nyda-Resurs of [[halal]] [[reindeer]] meat, which struggles against more traditional meats like [[mutton]].<ref name="full" /> In addition, the two Muslim organizations compete with each other over control of new Muslim communities; their competition is ideological (with the Council of Muftis more vocally supporting rights of Russian Muslims), political (since the council is closely connected to Moscow, and sometimes denounced as a state-backed organization that seeks to extend Moscow's control over Russia's Muslims), and ethnic (since North Caucasians dominate the council, while [[Tatars]] and [[Bashkirs]] traditionally control the CDUMR).<ref name="full" />

In 1905, Ali Abouchadi entered the [[Yukon Gold Rush]] alongside his uncle and a friend, the trio having emigrated from Lebanon to partake in the fortune-finding in the Canadian north, although they never made it further north than [[Lac La Biche, Alberta]],--but this caused a "gradual immigration of Lebanese Muslims to Lac La Biche".<ref name="auto4">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihistory.co/ali-ahmed-abouchadi/|title=Meet Ali Abouchadi, the trailblazing Canadian Muslim|first1=Meet Ali|last1=Abouchadi|first2=the trailblazing Canadian Muslim|last2=says|date=9 May 2017 |access-date=30 July 2020}}</ref> Twenty years later, Ali alone travelled northward to the [[Arctic Ocean]] as a merchant, stopping in [[Aklavik]], but ultimately returning to Alberta.<ref name="auto4"/>
