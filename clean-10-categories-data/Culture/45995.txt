A '''building,''' or '''edifice,''' is a [[structure]] with a [[roof]] and<ref name="Egenhofer" /> [[wall]]s standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a [[house]] or [[factory]].<ref name="Egenhofer"/> Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from [[building material]]s available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, and aesthetic reasons. To better understand the term ''building'' compare the list of [[nonbuilding structure]]s.

Buildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the [[:Category:Human habitats|human habitat]] (a place of comfort and safety) and the ''outside'' (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).

Ever since the first [[cave painting]]s, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. In recent years, interest in [[sustainable]] planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings.

== Definitions ==
The word ''building'' is both a noun and a verb: the structure itself and the act of making it. As a noun, a building is 'a structure that has a roof and walls and stands more or less permanently in one place';<ref name="Egenhofer">{{cite book|author=Max J. Egenhofer|title=Geographic Information Science: Second International Conference, GIScience 2002, Boulder, CO, USA, September 25–28, 2002.

In the broadest interpretation a [[fence]] or wall is a building.<ref>Building def. 2. Whitney, William Dwight, and Benjamin E. Smith. ''The Century dictionary and cyclopedia''. vol. 1. New York: Century Co., 1901. 712. Print.</ref> However, the word ''structure'' is used more broadly than ''building'' including natural and man-made formations<ref>Structure. def. 2. ''Merriam-Webster's dictionary of synonyms: a dictionary of discriminated synonyms with antonyms and analogous and contrasted words''.. Springfield, Mass: Merriam-Webster, 1984. 787. Print.</ref> and does not necessarily have walls. Structure is more likely to be used for a fence. [[Russell Sturgis|Sturgis' Dictionary]] included that "[building] differs from [[architecture]] in excluding all idea of artistic treatment; and it differs from [[construction]] in the idea of excluding scientific or highly skilful treatment."<ref>Building. def 1. Sturgis, Russell. ''A dictionary of architecture and building: biographical, historical, and descriptive''. vol. 1. New York: The Macmillan Co. ;, 1901. 2236. Print.</ref> As a verb, building is the act of construction.

''Structural height'' in technical usage is the height to the highest architectural detail on building from street-level. Depending on how they are classified, spires and masts may or may not be included in this height. Spires and masts used as antennas are not generally included. The definition of a ''low-rise vs. a high-rise'' building is a matter of debate, but generally three storeys or less is considered low-rise.<ref>Paul Francis Wendt and Alan Robert Cerf (1979), ''Real estate investment analysis and taxation'', McGraw-Hill, p. 210</ref>

== History ==
{{see also|History of architecture}}
There is clear evidence of homebuilding from around 18,000 BC.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Rob Dunn|author-link1=Robert Dunn (biologist)|journal=New Scientist|date=Aug 23, 2014|pages=34–37|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329830.500-meet-the-lodgers-wildlife-in-the-great-indoors.html?full=true|title=Meet the lodgers: Wildlife in the great indoors|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129031849/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329830.500-meet-the-lodgers-wildlife-in-the-great-indoors.html?full=true|archive-date=2014-11-29}}</ref> Buildings became common during the Neolithic (see [[Neolithic architecture]]).<ref>{{cite book|editor=Daniel Cilia|date=2004|first=Anthony|last=Pace|chapter=Tarxien|title=Malta before History – The World's Oldest Free Standing Stone Architecture|publisher=Miranda Publishers|isbn=978-9990985085}}</ref>

=== Residential ===
{{main|List of human habitation forms}}

Single-family residential buildings are most often called [[house]]s or [[home]]s. Multi-family residential buildings containing more than one dwelling unit are called a [[Duplex (building)|duplex]] or an [[apartment]] building. A [[condominium]] is an apartment that the occupant owns rather than rents. Houses may also be built in pairs ([[semi-detached]]), in terraces where all but two of the houses have others either side; apartments may be built round courtyards or as rectangular blocks surrounded by a piece of ground of varying sizes. Houses which were built as a single dwelling may later be divided into apartments or [[bedsitter]]s; they may also be converted to another use e.g. an office or a shop.

Building types may range from [[Hut (dwelling)|hut]]s to multimillion-dollar high-rise [[apartment block]]s able to house thousands of people. Increasing settlement density in buildings (and smaller distances between buildings) is usually a response to high ground prices resulting from many people wanting to live close to work or similar attractors. Other common [[building material]]s are brick, concrete or combinations of either of these with stone.

Residential buildings have different names for their use depending if they are seasonal include [[holiday cottage]] (vacation home) or [[timeshare]]; size such as a [[cottage]] or [[great house]]; value such as a [[shack]] or [[mansion]]; manner of construction such as a [[log home]] or [[mobile home]]; proximity to the ground such as [[Earth sheltering|earth sheltered]] house, [[stilt house]], or [[tree house]]. Also if the residents are in need of special care such as a [[nursing home]], [[orphanage]] or [[prison]]; or in group housing like [[barracks]] or [[dormitory|dormitories]].

Historically many people lived in communal buildings called [[longhouse]]s, smaller dwellings called [[pit-house]]s and houses combined with barns sometimes called [[housebarn]]s.

Buildings are defined to be substantial, permanent structures so other dwelling forms such as [[houseboat]]s, [[yurt]]s, and [[motorhome]]s are [[dwelling]]s but not buildings.

=== Complex ===
[[File:Competitiveness - Korea.jpg|thumb|[[Aluminium|Aluminum]] panel framed [[Steel building|steal building]], in Korea.]]
Sometimes a group of inter-related (and possibly inter-connected) builds are referred to as a complex – for example a [[housing complex]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/plans-to-convert-former-housing-complex-into-flats/story-30042482-detail/story.html|title=plans to convert housing complex|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110125715/http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/plans-to-convert-former-housing-complex-into-flats/story-30042482-detail/story.html#|archive-date=2017-01-10|access-date=2017-02-23}}</ref>  educational complex,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.isye.gatech.edu/about/maps-directions/isye-building-complex|title=isye building complex|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103001851/https://www.isye.gatech.edu/about/maps-directions/isye-building-complex|archive-date=2017-01-03}}</ref> hospital complex, etc.

== Creation ==
The practice of designing, constructing, and operating buildings is most usually a collective effort of different groups of [[professional]]s and [[Tradesperson|trades]]. Depending on the size, complexity, and purpose of a particular building project, the project team may include:

* A [[real estate developer]] who secures [[funding]] for the project;
* One or more financial institutions or other investors that provide the funding
* Local planning and code authorities
* A [[Quantity surveyor|Surveyor]] who performs an ALTA/ACSM and construction surveys throughout the project;
* [[construction management|Construction manager]]s who coordinate the effort of different groups of project participants;
* Licensed [[architect]]s and [[Architectural engineering|engineers]] who provide [[building design]] and prepare construction [[document]]s;
* The principal design Engineering disciplines which would normally include the following professionals: Civil, Structural, Mechanical building services or HVAC (heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) Electrical Building Services, Plumbing and drainage. Also other possible design Engineer specialists may be involved such as Fire (prevention), Acoustic, facade engineers, building physics, Telecomms,     AV (Audio Visual), BMS (Building Management Systems) Automatic controls etc. These design Engineers also prepare construction documents which are issued to specialist contractors to obtain a price for the works and to follow for the installations.
* [[Landscape architect]]s;
* [[Interior design]]ers;
* Other consultants;
* [[General contractor|Contractor]]s who provide [[construction]] services and install building systems such as [[HVAC|climate control]], [[Electrician|electrical]], [[plumbing]], [[Painter and decorator|decoration]], [[fire protection]], [[security]] and [[telecommunications]];
* Marketing or [[leasing]] agents;
* [[facility management|Facility managers]] who are responsible for operating the building.

Regardless of their size or intended use, all buildings in the US must comply with [[zoning ordinance]]s, [[building code]]s and other regulations such as [[fire code]]s, [[life safety code]]s and related standards.

Vehicles—such as [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]], [[Travel trailer|caravans]], [[ship]]s and passenger [[aircraft]]—are treated as "buildings" for life safety purposes.

=== Ownership and funding ===
* [[Mortgage loan]]
* [[Real estate developer]]

Any building requires a certain general amount of internal infrastructure to function, which includes such elements like heating / cooling, power and telecommunications, water and wastewater etc. Especially in [[commercial building]]s (such as offices or factories), these can be extremely intricate systems taking up large amounts of space (sometimes located in separate areas or double floors / false ceilings) and constitute a big part of the regular maintenance required.

=== Conveying systems ===

Systems for [[transport]] of people within buildings:

* [[Elevator]]
* [[Escalator]]
* [[Moving sidewalk]] (horizontal and inclined)

Systems for transport of people between interconnected buildings:

* [[Skyway]]
* [[Underground city]]

== Building damage ==

Buildings may be damaged during the construction of the building or during maintenance.
