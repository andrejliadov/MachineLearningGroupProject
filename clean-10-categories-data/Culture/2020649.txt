The '''luxury box''' (or '''skybox'''<ref>{{Cite OED|skybox}}</ref>) and '''club seating''' constitute the most exclusive class of seating in [[arena]]s and [[stadium]]s, and generate much higher revenues than regular seating.<ref name="sports.espn.go.com">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id%3D2889956%26campaign%3Drss%26source%3DNBAHeadlines |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111155233/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2889956&campaign=rss&source=NBAHeadlines |archivedate=2016-01-11 }}</ref><ref name="anr.uk.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.anr.uk.com/articles/i-2004-08-06-20-59-11.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308205236/http://anr.uk.com/articles/i-2004-08-06-20-59-11.html |archivedate=2016-03-08 }}</ref> Club ticketholders often receive exclusive access to an indoor part of the venue through private club entrances, to areas containing special restaurants, bars, merchandise stands, and lounge areas of the venue that are not otherwise available to regular ticketholders.<ref name="news.nationalpost.com">[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/why-its-so-hard-to-pee-at-an-edmonton-oilers-game]</ref>

==Location==
These special private seating sections located within [[stadium]]s, [[arena]]s, and other sporting and entertainment venues, are typically located in the midsection and/or main stand or [[grandstand]], usually providing the best views of the event. Some have glass panels that can be opened, in order for the spectators to feel closer to and more immersed in the action of the event. However at some tennis venues (where stadiums are smaller) the luxury boxes might be located at the lowest ring of seats, nearest to the playing court.

===Interior and amenities===
The inside of a luxury box typically includes a bar, televisions, a small seating area, and a private bathroom. The boxes are usually catered, with guests enjoying corporate hospitality, with champagne, [[canapés]], shrimp, and sushi being common favorites. The lease to a box usually comes with allocated parking spaces at the venue and access is usually provided with separate entrances, away from the general public gates.

===Commercial aspects===
Luxury boxes are a significant source of revenue for most professional sports teams and venue owners. Since the late 1990s, it has been proven that luxury suites and [[club seating]] are lucrative revenue-generating features that make pro sports teams financially successful in order to remain competitive long-term.<ref name=forbes1>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanaglass/2012/07/30/tom-gores-puts-his-stamp-on-the-detroit-pistons-with-arena-renovations/ |title=Tom Gores Puts His Stamp On The Detroit Pistons With Arena Renovations |work=Forbes |first=Alana |last=Glass |date=30 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=stadiumhotelnetwork1>{{cite web|url=http://palaceofauburnhills.stadiumhotelnetwork.com/information.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017190130/http://palaceofauburnhills.stadiumhotelnetwork.com/information.html |archivedate=2013-10-17 }}</ref><ref name=seattlepi1>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/basketball/270255_nbasonics15.html |title=Nothin' But Profit: Winning no longer key to new NBA |publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name=espn1>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2889956&campaign=rss&source=NBAHeadlines|title=Last of its kind: Charlotte Coliseum to be demolished Sunday|publisher=ESPN}}</ref> While originally widespread among North American major pro sports, this trend is also gaining popularity in Europe. For instance, [[Emirates Stadium]]'s revenue from [[club seating|premium seating]] and [[luxury suite|corporate boxes]] alone is nearly as high as the revenue from [[Arsenal F.C.]]'s [[Arsenal Stadium|previous stadium at Highbury]].<ref>Based on a quote by chief executive [[Keith Edelman]] in ''Management Today'', quoted in: {{cite web |url=http://www.anr.uk.com/articles/i-2004-08-06-20-59-11.html |title=Reasons to be cheerful |work=ANR |date=6 August 2004 |accessdate=8 December 2006}}</ref>

Particularly in [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American major professional sports leagues]], luxury suite revenue does not have to be shared unlike gate receipts which are split with visiting teams, leading to teams demanding new venues that contain more luxury boxes.<ref name="shakedown">
{{cite news|title=The Shakedown|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1006718/1/index.htm|work=Sports Illustrated Vault|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=24 June 2012|author=Tim Crothers|date=19 June 1995}}</ref>

===Marketing and exclusivity===
Most luxury suites are [[leased]] by contract on a yearly basis, though some are bought in a manner similar to that for a [[condominium]]. These methods usually grant access to the box by the leaseholder or owner for every event held at the venue. A few venues [[renting|rent]] them on a per-event basis. Prices vary from [[American Dollar|US$]]5,000 up to the millions of dollars depending on the venue and events held there.

Some{{who|date=May 2019}} have commented that the rise of the luxury box, along with [[club seating]], has degraded the game-day experience for the average fan, because placement of the boxes has moved the upper decks higher and farther away from the playing surface. Three current North American venues, [[Ford Field]], [[Red Bull Arena (New Jersey)|Red Bull Arena]], and [[Levi's Stadium]], have addressed these concerns by placing all luxury boxes on one side of the playing surface, which allows the other sides of the venue to have closer sightlines than most modern venues. [[State Farm Arena (Atlanta)|State Farm Arena]] in Atlanta formerly had all of its premium seating on one side of the arena; however, renovations that took place during 2017 removed the upper level luxury boxes and were replaced with a traditional upper deck and premium seating spread throughout the arena.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilfon|first1=Justin|title=Philips Arena to feature courtside bar, barber shop|url=https://www.wsbtv.com/sports/remodeled-phillips-arena-to-feature-nbas-first-courtside-bar-barber-shop/543874605|publisher=WSB-TV|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref>

===Single-event rental prices===
Luxury boxes that are rented on a single event basis can range from US$500 for low-key events to up to at least US$250,000 for high-end events such as sporting final matches. Also, the location of the box and how many people the box can hold usually makes up the price. Standing room tickets may also be purchased at an additional fee but are usually less money than an actual suite ticket. If a normal box ticket with a seat costs US$500 per ticket then standing room tickets might be around US$250–US$300 per ticket. These tickets will allow more people in a box, but they won't have seats and will have to stand in the box or sit in the lounge area.

Average private box rental prices for events vary based on location, matchup, and venue. Typical luxury boxes for most events fall within the following price ranges:

===Prevalence===
The stadium with the most luxury boxes is the [[Estadio Monumental "U"]] in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]: with 1,251. The first stadium to contain a luxury box was the [[Astrodome]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], built in 1965. The [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] constructed their first luxury boxes (dubbed the "Turn Two Suites") in 1973 as part of the existing motel complex on the grounds. One unique set of luxury boxes is located on the campus of [[Boston College]]. The school's main indoor arena, [[Conte Forum]] (also known as Kelley Rink for [[ice hockey|hockey]] games), is directly attached to its [[American football|football]] venue, [[Alumni Stadium]]. Some of the luxury boxes in the combined complex overlook both the stadium's playing field and the arena floor. The [[University of South Dakota]] later borrowed Boston College's concept when it built the [[Sanford Coyote Sports Center]], which opened in 2016 as the new home for the school's basketball and volleyball teams. Several boxes at the Sports Center allow their users to watch games at both the arena and the attached [[DakotaDome]], home to USD football.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn991.com/a-look-inside-the-new-sanford-coyote-sports-center-at-usd/ |title=A Look Inside the New Sanford Coyote Sports Center at USD |first=Jeff |last=Harkness |publisher=[[KSOO-FM|ESPN 99.1]] |location=[[Sioux Falls, South Dakota|Sioux Falls, SD]] |date=August 6, 2016 |accessdate=December 22, 2016}}</ref>

Luxury boxes have become a feature of the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports league]] system in North America. [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]]' large number of luxury suites was a pioneer for the building boom of modern-style NBA arenas in the 1990s. The Detroit Pistons played in The Palace from its opening in 1988 through the 2016–17 season, by which time it was one of the NBA's oldest arenas. Nonetheless, The Palace's forward-thinking design contained the amenities that most NBA teams sought in newer arenas. The Pistons moved to the new [[Little Caesars Arena]] in [[midtown Detroit]] for the 2017–18 season, by which time only one of the five other NBA venues that opened in the 1988–89 season was still in use—the [[Bradley Center]], which was replaced in 2018 by [[Fiserv Forum]] and then demolished in early 2019. Three of those five have been demolished ([[Amway Arena]], [[Charlotte Coliseum]], and [[Miami Arena]]), and the other, [[Sleep Train Arena]], was [[Golden 1 Center|replaced]] in 2016.<ref name=forbes1 /><ref name=stadiumhotelnetwork1 /><ref name=seattlepi1 /><ref name=espn1 />

Top-tier European pro [[association football]] teams have moved to new stadiums designed with a large number of luxury boxes, such as [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. Other clubs such as [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] have extensively renovated their existing stadiums to add large numbers of luxury boxes.

===Use in the NFL===
Most notable in their use of luxury boxes is the [[National Football League]]. Under the NFL's current revenue sharing agreement, teams must forfeit a large portion of their ticket revenues so that the funds can be [[wealth redistribution|redistributed]] among all the teams, particularly those in smaller markets. However, the luxury boxes, quickly becoming a top source of revenue for the franchises, were exempted from this sharing requirement.

Furthermore, the NFL's [[NFL on television#Blackout policies|blackout rule]] has led stadium operators to sacrifice [[seating capacity]] in favor of the luxury boxes, as it makes a sell-out easier with a lower total number of regular seats. Teams have used the threat of relocation to press state and local governments for financial assistance to either build new stadiums or renovate older venues.<ref name="shakedown" />

==Club seating==
{{main|Club seating}}

'''Club seating''', '''club-level seating''', or '''premium seating''' is a special section of seating in modern sports [[stadium]]s and [[arena]]s. These may be known by different terms, such as "Legends Suite seats" at [[Yankee Stadium]] or "Platinum Club" at [[Scotiabank Arena]].<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/sports/baseball/21tickets.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017112554/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/sports/baseball/21tickets.html |archivedate=2015-10-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaircanadacentre.com/restaurants/PlatinumClub/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429031424/http://www.theaircanadacentre.com/restaurants/PlatinumClub/ |archivedate=2016-04-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2013/07/22/maple_leafs_tim_leiweke_wants_to_end_sight_of_empty_seats_when_puck_drops_at_air_canada_centre.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111155233/http://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2013/07/22/maple_leafs_tim_leiweke_wants_to_end_sight_of_empty_seats_when_puck_drops_at_air_canada_centre.html |archivedate=2016-01-11 }}</ref> Club-level seating is open to the elements, as opposed to the entirely enclosed luxury boxes, which gives more of an outdoor impression at roofless and open-roof stadiums and arenas. Club-level seating is typically considered a more exclusive class of seating than elsewhere in the venue, other than the luxury boxes.

Club-level seating can either be sold as individual tickets, or marketed on a contract basis (similar to luxury suites) to allow for maximum profit on the part of the venue. This gives club seats more flexibility for individuals and small companies, while luxury boxes can typically only be leased by large corporations willing to pay around $500,000 USD or higher a year.<ref name="justluxe.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.justluxe.com/lifestyle/leisure/feature-1881758.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501072421/http://www.justluxe.com/lifestyle/leisure/feature-1881758.php |archivedate=2016-05-01 }}</ref>  Like luxury suites, club seating generates much higher revenues than regular seating.<ref name="sports.espn.go.com"/><ref name="anr.uk.com"/>

While luxury boxes and [[personal seat license]]s have been around since the 1960s, club-level seating is a recent innovation of the 1990s. The mid-stage is the optimal placement for luxury boxes in order to give them good sightlines to make them attractive for lessees, however only a limited number of luxury boxes can be placed there, as adding too many mid-level boxes will reduce seating capacity and degrade the viewing experience for other parts of the venue. For the area/stadium designer, club-level seating can be implemented in the middle tier at lower cost and less space than having all luxury boxes.

===Description===
Club levels normally provide fans several additional amenities than standard seating. The seats themselves are often wider and more comfortable than regular seats.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/sports/baseball/oriole-park-at-camden-yards-keeps-up-with-the-times-at-age-20.html?_r%3D0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903150411/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/sports/baseball/oriole-park-at-camden-yards-keeps-up-with-the-times-at-age-20.html?_r=0 |archivedate=2014-09-03 }}</ref> The club level provides fans with special access to an indoor part of the venue exclusive to fans with special tickets. These areas are air conditioned and allow access to special restaurants, merchandise stands, and lounge areas of the venue that are not otherwise available to standard ticketholders. Concession stands and vendors on the club level also often offer different menus than in other stands to give more of a special feel to the club. These areas are closed off to the rest of the venue, and they usually can only be accessed through the exclusive, private club entrances. Parking and concierge service are often available to club levels.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> The ratio of toilets to fans is considerably higher in the club level than general seating, avoiding the long washroom lineups that plague regular admission fans.<ref name="news.nationalpost.com"/>

The club level is usually located towards the middle of the stage of seating sections, above the lower deck but below the upper deck. They are usually situated near the luxury boxes, whether right above, right below, or sandwiched between two levels of luxury boxes. Unlike some luxury box levels, most club levels do not wrap entirely around the venue. Some club levels stop at a certain point, giving way to an expansion of the [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]], while others give way to lower-class luxury boxes (such as "party suites"). A notable exception to this is [[Emirates Stadium]] in [[London]], which has a complete tier of club seating. Some venues such as the [[MetLife Stadium]] have luxury suites that are not completely enclosed and come with exposed seats similar to those at club level.<ref name="justluxe.com"/>
