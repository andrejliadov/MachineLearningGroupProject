'''Applied ecology''' is a sub-field within [[ecology]] that considers the [[applied science|application]] of the science of ecology to real-world (usually management) questions. It is also described as a scientific field that focuses on the application of concepts, theories, models, or methods of fundamental ecology to environmental problems.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Theoretical Ecology" />

== Concept ==
Applied ecology is an integrated treatment of the ecological, social, and biotechnological aspects of natural resource conservation and management. Applied ecology typically focuses on geomorphology, soils, and plant communities as the underpinnings for vegetation and wildlife (both game and non-game) management.

Applied ecology includes all disciplines that are related to human activities so that it does not only cover [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] but also global change.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Plant Ecology|last1=Schulze|first1=Ernst-Detlef|last2=Beck|first2=Erwin|last3=Müller-Hohenstein|first3=Klaus|date=2005|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=354020833X|location=Berlin|pages=1}}</ref> It has two study categories. The first involves the outputs or those fields that address the use and management of the environment, particularly for its [[ecosystem services]] and exploitable resources.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Theoretical Ecology" /> The second are the inputs or those that are concerned with the management strategies or human influences on the ecosystem or biodiversity.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Theoretical Ecology" />

The discipline is often linked to ecological management on the grounds that the effective management of natural ecosystems depends on ecological knowledge.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Applied Ecology and Natural Resource Management|last1=McPherson|first1=Guy R.|last2=DeStefano|first2=Stephen|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521009751|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=1}}</ref> It often uses an ecological approach to solve problems of specific parts of the environment, which can involve the comparison of plausible options (e.g. best management options).<ref name="Encyclopedia of Theoretical Ecology" />

The role of applied science in agricultural production has been brought into greater focus as fluctuations in global food production feed through into prices and availability to consumers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780123948083/encyclopedia-of-applied-plant-sciences|title=scd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

== Approaches ==
Applied ecologists often use one or more of the following approaches, namely, observation, experimentation, and modeling.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ecology|last=|first=|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780444520333|location=Amsterdam|pages=230}}</ref> For example, a wildlife preservation project could involve: observational studies of the wildlife ecology;  experiments to understand causal relationships; and the application of modeling to determine the information beyond the scope of experimentation.<ref name=":1" />

The ecological approach used in applied ecology could include inputs from management strategies such as [[conservation biology]], [[restoration ecology]], global change, [[ecotoxicology]], [[biomonitoring]], [[biodiversity]], [[Environmental policy|environmental policies]], and [[economics]], among others.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Theoretical Ecology" /> Restoration ecology is a particularly prominent strategy in the discipline since it applies the principles of restoring and repairing damaged ecological systems to their original state.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Law and Ecology: The Rise of the Ecosystem Regime|last1=Brooks|first1=Richard O.|last2=Jones|first2=Ross|date=2017-07-05|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=9780754620389|location=Oxon|pages=21–22}}</ref>

Like those used in ecological theory, many areas of the discipline employ approaches that are based on simple statistical and analytic models (e.g. spatial models) as well as those with mathematical properties (e.g. matrix models).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Models in Ecosystem Science|last1=Canham|first1=Charles Draper William|last2=Cole|first2=Jonathan|last3=Lauenroth|first3=William K.|date=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691092885|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=63–64}}</ref> There is also the digital computer simulation modeling, which is designed to solve statistical ecology problems and to achieve bioeconomic goals such as the forecasting and the evaluation of consequences for specific activities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Systems Analysis and Simulation in Ecology, Volume II|last=Patten|first=Bernard C.|date=1972|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9781483262772|location=New York|pages=329|language=en}}</ref>

Applied ecology also requires human interest, particularly the exercise of judgments of relative values and goals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Concepts of Applied Ecology|last=DeSanto|first=R. S.|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9781461394341|location=New York|pages=124}}</ref>

== Applications ==
Applied ecology can be applied to the economic development process. The discipline, for example, can be integrated into the national economic planning to comprehensively address environmental concerns since these problems are intersectoral and interdisciplinary in nature.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race to Save the Tropics: Ecology And Economics For A Sustainable Future|last=Goodland|first=Robert|date=1990|publisher=Island Press|isbn=1559630396|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=12}}</ref>
