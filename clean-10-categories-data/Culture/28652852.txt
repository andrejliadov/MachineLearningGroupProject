==Biography==
While a student at [[St John's College, Oxford]], Albery became involved with [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] and spiritual movements in [[San Francisco]], dropped out of college and joined the anti-university in London.<ref name=GuardianObit /> He died in a car accident, on 3 June 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturaldeath.org.uk/index.php?page=trustees |title=Natural Death Centre .org - Who we are |publisher=Naturaldeath.org.uk |date=2001-06-03 |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref>

===Underground London in the 1970s===
After a period in [[Haight Ashbury]] he returned to the UK and became involved with the newly started [[BIT (infoshop)|BIT Information Service]], quickly becoming a driving force in the development of wider activities for BIT so that it became one of the first [[Social centre]]s. Around 1972-73, at the peak of its activities and with the momentum given by Nicholas, BIT Info-Service ran 24 hours a day, with "BIT-workers" coming up at around 10 PM to take the night shift until around 8:00 AM the following day.

===The "Windsor Festival case"===
In 1974, in the aftermath of a violent attack by police on the [[Windsor Free Festival]], Albery, playwright [[Heathcote Williams]] and his partner Diana Senior successfully sued David Holdsworth, the [[Thames Valley]] Chief Constable, for creating a riotous situation in which the police attacked the plaintiffs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enablerpublications.co.uk/pdfs/notonly2.pdf |title=Alan Dearling's "Not only but also..." memoirs of Free Festivals |format=PDF |date=}}</ref>

===Frestonia===
Nicholas was a Minister for the Free State of [[Frestonia]] in [[North Kensington]]<ref>[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/republic-of-frestonia-tony-sleep-032 "The Notting Hill Squatters".] [[Vice (magazine)]]</ref> and a [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] candidate in [[Notting Hill]].

==Social innovations' activist==
In 1985, out of BIT Information Service, he founded the [[Institute for Social Inventions]]. From small beginnings (a network of inventors, a quarterly newsletter), the Institute grew into a full-fledged organisation under his leadership: producing an annual compendium, running social inventions workshops and promoting creative solutions around the world. The Institute included [[Edward de Bono]], [[Anita Roddick]] and [[Fay Weldon ]]among its patrons.<ref name=GuardianObit />

The [[Global Ideas Bank]], which he founded in 1995 as an offspring of the Institute for Social Inventions, was first established online, and new features were added: online submission, voting systems, categorisation, a message board, and so on.

===Promoting "natural" death===
Albery and his wife, the psychotherapist Josefine Speyer, became interested in ecological approaches to death and funerals, and in breaking the [[taboo]]s that surround death in western societies. In 1991, with Christianne Heal, they founded the Natural Death Centre, offering advice on DIY burials.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nicholas Albery - Obituary |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1308961/Nicholas-Albery.html |newspaper=The Telegraph |accessdate=19 March 2019 |date=13 June 2001}}</ref> The much-patronised centre provides midwives for the dying, death exercises, recyclable coffins, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturaldeath.org.uk |title=Natural Death Centre .org - The Natural Death Centre |publisher=Naturaldeath.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-25}}</ref>
