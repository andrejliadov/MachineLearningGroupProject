'''Nuclear sharing''' is a concept in [[NATO]]'s policy of nuclear [[deterrence theory|deterrence]], which involves member countries without [[nuclear weapon]]s of their own in the planning for the use of nuclear weapons by NATO. In particular, it provides for the [[military|armed forces]] of those countries to be involved in delivering nuclear weapons in the event of their use.

As part of nuclear sharing, the participating countries carry out consultations and make common decisions on nuclear weapons policy, maintain technical equipment (notably nuclear-capable airplanes) required for the use of nuclear weapons and store nuclear weapons on their territory. In case of [[war]], the United States told NATO allies the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) would no longer be controlling.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.opanal.org/Articles/cancun/can-Donnelly.htm|title=The Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Articles I, II and VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128114502/http://www.opanal.org/Articles/cancun/can-Donnelly.htm|archivedate=28 January 2015 |accessdate=2 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Saudi Arabian–Pakistani agreement==
It is common belief among foreign officials that [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Pakistan]] have an understanding in which Pakistan would supply Saudi Arabia with warheads if security in the [[Persian Gulf]] was threatened. A Western official told ''[[The Times]]'' that Saudi Arabia could have the nuclear warheads in a matter of days of approaching Pakistan. Pakistan's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, [[Mohammed Naeem Khan]], was quoted as saying, "Pakistan considers the security of Saudi Arabia not just as a diplomatic or an internal matter but as a personal matter." Naeem also said that the Saudi leadership considered Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to be one country and that any threat to Saudi Arabia is also a threat to Pakistan.<ref name=msnbc-20100210>{{cite news |url=http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/10/10369793-report-saudi-arabia-to-buy-nukes-if-iran-tests-a-bomb |title=Report: Saudi Arabia to buy nukes if Iran tests A-bomb |website=msnbc.com |date=10 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213030211/http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/10/10369793-report-saudi-arabia-to-buy-nukes-if-iran-tests-a-bomb |archivedate=13 February 2012}}</ref> Other vendors were also likely to enter into a bidding war if Riyadh indicated that it was seeking nuclear warheads.

===Response===
According to the US based think-tank, the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], the BBC report on possible nuclear sharing between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia is partially incorrect. There is no indication of the validity or credibility of the BBC's sources, and the article fails to expand on what essentially constitutes an unverified lead. Furthermore, if Pakistan were to transfer nuclear warheads onto Saudi soil, it is highly unlikely that either nation would face any international repercussions if both nations were to follow strict nuclear sharing guidelines like those of [[NATO]].<ref>Deming, Kyle, [http://poniforum.csis.org/blog/no-price-is-right-why-the-bbc-is-incorrect-about-a-saudi-arabia-p "No Price is Right: Why the BBC is Incorrect about a Saudi Arabia-Pakistan Nuclear Weapons Deal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714205353/http://poniforum.csis.org/blog/no-price-is-right-why-the-bbc-is-incorrect-about-a-saudi-arabia-p |date=14 July 2014 }}, Project on Nuclear Weapons, 13 November 2013.</ref> A research paper produced by the [[British House of Commons]] [[Defence Select Committee]] states that as long as current NATO nuclear sharing arrangements remain in place, the NATO states would have few valid grounds for complaint if such a transfer were to occur.<ref name=dsc-2008/>

==Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty considerations==
Both the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and critics within NATO believe that NATO's nuclear sharing violates Articles I and II of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT), which prohibit the transfer and the acceptance of direct or indirect control, respectively, over nuclear weapons.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The United States insists that its forces control the weapons and that no transfer of the nuclear bombs or control over them is intended "unless and until a decision were made to go to war, at which the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]] would no longer be controlling", so there is no breach of the NPT.<ref name=Donnelly>{{citation|url=http://www.opanal.org/Articles/cancun/can-Donnelly.htm|title=The Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Articles I, II and VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|publisher=Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean|accessdate=7 August 2009|author1=Brian Donnelly|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105200406/http://www.opanal.org/Articles/cancun/can-Donnelly.htm|archivedate=5 January 2009}}</ref><ref name=statehistorian-19670428>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v11/d232 |title=232.

{{Quote

There are concerns that this arrangement undermines, and possibly contravenes, Articles I and II of the NPT. According to US lawyers, the transfer of control is legal because, on the outbreak of "general war", the NPT has failed in its purpose and can be regarded as no longer in controlling force. This arrangement was conceived in the early to mid-1960s to contain proliferation. It is arguable that several European nations including Germany were persuaded not to become nuclear states themselves because of the NATO nuclear umbrella. However, a nuclear sharing arrangement that may have had some logic in the pre-NPT and cold war world is now a source of weakening for the NPT, as it offers a rationale to other states to pursue a similar programme. NATO's nuclear sharing programme could now be used as an excuse by China, Pakistan or any other nuclear-armed nation to establish a similar arrangement. Imagine if China were to offer such an arrangement to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions. Or if Pakistan were to undertake nuclear sharing with Saudi Arabia or Iran. Such developments would be perceived as a threat to security in North Asia or the Middle East, and even as a direct threat to NATO. Yet, while the NATO arrangements remain in place, NATO members would have few valid grounds for complaint. The Committee should recommend the immediate termination of NATO nuclear sharing arrangements.<ref name=dsc-2008/>

At the time the NPT was being negotiated, the NATO nuclear sharing agreements were secret. These agreements were disclosed to some of the states, including the [[Soviet Union]], negotiating the treaty along with the NATO arguments for not treating them as proliferation.
