{{POV check|talk=Various sections in talk section address the dubious claim of universality of the sole and only list within this article.

A '''cultural universal''' (also called an '''anthropological universal''' or '''human universal'''), as discussed by [[Emile Durkheim]], [[George Murdock]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] and others, is an element, pattern, trait, or institution that is common to all [[human culture]]s worldwide. Taken together, the whole body of cultural universals is known as the [[human condition]]. [[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.<ref name="Psychology">Schacter, Daniel L, Daniel Wegner and Daniel Gilbert. 2007. ''Psychology''. Worth Publishers. pp. 26–27</ref> Some anthropological and sociological theorists that take a [[cultural relativist]] perspective may deny the existence of cultural universals: the extent to which these universals are "cultural" in the narrow sense, or in fact biologically inherited [[ethology|behavior]] is an issue of "[[nature versus nurture]]".

==Non-nativist explanations==
The observation of the same or similar behavior in different cultures does not prove that they are the results of a common underlying psychological mechanism. One possibility is that they may have been invented independently due to a common practical problem.<ref>Language: The cultural tool DL Everett - 2012 - Vintage</ref>

Since any cultures that have been [[anthropology|studied by anthropologists]] have had contact with at least the anthropologists that studied it, and anthropological [[research ethics]] slows the studies down so that other groups unbound by such ethics, often at least locally represented by people of the same skin color as the supposedly isolated tribe but significantly culturally globalized, reach the tribe before the anthropologists do, no truly uncontacted culture has ever been scientifically studied.<ref>Fam Med. 2008 Jan;40(1) Continuing professional development in sensitive cultures. Huntington MK1.</ref> This allows outside influence to be an explanation for cultural universals as well.<ref>Equal Recognition: The Moral Foundations of Minority Rights, Alan Patten 2014</ref> This does not preclude multiple independent inventions of [[civilization]] and is therefore not the same thing as [[hyperdiffusionism]]; it merely means that cultural universals are not proof of [[innateness]].<ref>Cultures and Globalization: Cultural Expression, Creativity and Innovation, Helmut K Anheier, Yudhishthir Raj Isar 2010</ref>
