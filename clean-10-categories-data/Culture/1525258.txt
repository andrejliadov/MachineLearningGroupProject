Used colloquially as a [[noun]] or [[adjective]], "'''highbrow'''" is [[synonym]]ous with [[intellectual]]; as an adjective, it also means [[elite]], and generally carries a [[connotation]] of [[high culture]]. The word draws its [[metonymy]] from the [[pseudoscience]] of [[phrenology]], and was originally simply a physical descriptor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hendrickson|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins|url=https://archive.org/details/qpbencyclopediao00robe|url-access=registration|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|year=1997|quote=Dr. [[Franz Joseph Gall]] (1758–1828), founder of the 'science' of phrenology, gave support to the old folk notion that people with big foreheads have more brains. The theory, later discredited, led to the expression 'highbrow' for an intellectual, which is first recorded in 1875.}}</ref>

==Applications==
"Highbrow" can be applied to [[music]], implying most of the [[European classical music|classical music]] tradition; to literature—i.e., [[literary fiction]] and [[poetry]]; to films in the [[art film|arthouse]] line; and to comedy that requires significant understanding of analogies or references to appreciate. The term ''highbrow'' is considered by some (with corresponding labels as 'middlebrow' 'lowbrow') as discriminatory or overly selective;<ref>Lawrence W. Levine, "Prologue", ''Highbrow/Lowbrow: The Emergence of Cultural Hierarchy in America'', 1990: 3</ref> and ''highbrow'' is currently distanced from the writer by quotation marks: "We thus focus on the consumption of two generally recognised 'highbrow' genres—opera and classical".<ref>Tak Wing Chan, ''Social Status and Cultural Consumption'' 2010: 60</ref> The first usage in print of ''highbrow'' was recorded in 1884.<ref>{{OED|Highbrow}}</ref> The term was popularized in 1902 by Will Irvin, a reporter for ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', who adhered to the phrenological notion of more intelligent people having high foreheads.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hendrickson|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins|url=https://archive.org/details/qpbencyclopediao00robe|url-access=registration|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|year=1997|quote=New York Sun reporter Will Irvin popularized 'highbrow,' and its opposite 'lowbrow' in 1902, basing his creation on the wrongful notion that people with high foreheads have bigger brains and are more intelligent and intellectual than those with low foreheads. At first the term was complimentary, but 'Tristi' came to be at best a neutral word.)}}</ref>

==Variants==

The opposite of highbrow is [[low culture|lowbrow]], and between them is [[middlebrow]], describing culture that is neither high nor low; as a usage, middlebrow is derogatory, as in [[Virginia Woolf]]'s unsent letter to the ''[[New Statesman]]'', written in the 1930s and published in ''The Death of the Moth and Other Essays'' (1942). According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the word ''middlebrow'' first appeared in print in 1925, in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'': "The [[BBC]] claims to have discovered a new type—'the middlebrow'. It consists of people who are hoping that some day they will get used to the stuff that they ought to like".<ref>Quoted in Micki McGee, ''Yaddo: Making American Culture'', 106: McGee outlines the history of the highbrow/lowbrow debate.</ref> The term had previously appeared in hyphenated form in ''[[The Nation]]'', on 25 January 1912:
{{quotation|[T]here is an alarmingly wide chasm, I might almost say a vacuum, between the high-brow, who considers reading either as a trade or as a form of intellectual wrestling, and the low-brow, who is merely seeking for gross thrills. It is to be hoped that culture will soon be democratized through some less conventional system of education, giving rise to a new type that might be called the middle-brow, who will consider books as a source of intellectual enjoyment.}}

It was popularized by the American writer and poet [[Margaret Widdemer]], whose essay "Message and Middlebrow" appeared in the ''Review of Literature'' in 1933. The three [[genre fiction|genres of fiction]], as American readers approached them in the 1950s and as obscenity law differentially judged them, are the subject of Ruth Pirsig Wood, ''Lolita in Peyton Place: Highbrow, Middlebrow, and Lowbrow Novels'', 1995.

==Cultural examples==
[[Prince Hamlet]] was considered by [[Virginia Woolf]] as a highbrow lacking orientation in the world once he had lost the lowbrow [[Ophelia]] with her grip on earthly realities: this, she thought, explained why in general highbrows "honour so wholeheartedly and depend so completely upon those who are called lowbrows".<ref>A. Fox, ''Virginia Woolf and the Literature of the English Renaissnce'' (1990) p. 107</ref>
