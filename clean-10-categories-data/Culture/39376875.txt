[[File:Margaret Atwood 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' series is an often cited [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian novel]] in [[ecocriticism]].]]
The term "cli-fi" first came into use on April 20, 2013 when [[NPR]] did a five-minute radio segment by Angela Evancie on Weekend Edition Saturday<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/04/20/176713022/so-hot-right-now-has-climate-change-created-a-new-literary-genre|title=So Hot Right Now: Has Climate Change Created A New Literary Genre?|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref> to describe novels and movies that deal with human-induced [[climate change]], and historically, there have been any number of literary works that dealt with climate change in earlier times as well. Dan Bloom has been an influential figure in the development of "cli-fi" as a distinct genre.<ref>Milner A and Burgmann JR.

[[Jules Verne]]'s 1889 novel ''[[The Purchase of the North Pole]]'' imagines climate change due to [[Earth#Axial tilt and seasons|tilting of Earth's axis]].  In his posthumous ''[[Paris in the Twentieth Century]]'', written in 1883 and set during the 1960s, the titular city experiences a sudden drop in temperature, which lasts for three years.<ref>Arthur B. Evans, "The 'New' Jules Verne".

Ballard]] deal with climate-related natural disasters: In  ''[[The Wind from Nowhere]]'' (1961), civilization is reduced by persistent hurricane-force winds, and ''[[The Drowned World]]'' (1962) describes a future of melted ice-caps and rising sea-levels caused by solar radiation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/22/1000-novels-jg-ballard|title=The best of JG Ballard|first=Toby|last=Litt|date=21 January 2009|via=The Guardian}}</ref> In ''[[The Burning World (novel)|The Burning World]]'' (1964, later called ''The Drought'') his climate catastrophe is human-made, a drought due to disruption of the precipitation cycle by industrial pollution.<ref>.http://www.jgballard.ca/criticism/milicia_drought1985.html</ref>

As scientific knowledge of the effects of fossil fuel consumption and resulting increase in atmospheric {{CO2}} concentrations entered the public and political arena as "[[History of climate change science|global warming]]",<ref name=aiphistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/co2.htm |title=The Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Effect |work=The Discovery of Global Warming | year=2003 |author=Spencer Weart}}</ref> fiction about the problems of human-induced global warming began to appear. [[Susan M. Gaines]]'s ''[[Carbon Dreams]]'' was an early example of a literary novel that "tells a story about the devastatingly serious issue of human-induced climate change," set in the 1980s and published before the term "cli-fi" was coined.<ref>Wilson, Elizabeth K. "Novelist Combines CO2 and Romance", Chemical and Engineering News, June 4, 2001.</ref> [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[State of Fear]]'' (2004), a [[techno-thriller]] portrays climate change as "a vast pseudo-scientific hoax" and is critical of [[scientific opinion on climate change]].<ref>Slovic, Scott.

Cultural critic Josephine Livingston at ''The New Republic'': "From Jeff Vandermeer's ''[[Annihilation (VanderMeer novel)|Annihilation]]'' to Nathaniel Rich's ''[[Odds Against Tomorrow]]'', the last decade has seen such a steep rise in sophisticated 'cli-fi' that some literary publications now devote whole verticals to it. With such various and fertile imaginations at work on the same topic, whether in fiction or nonfiction, the challenge facing the environmental writer now is standing out from the crowd (not to mention the headlines)."

== Influence ==

Many journalists, literary critics, and scholars and have speculated about the potential influence of climate fiction on the beliefs of its readers. To date, two empirical studies have examined this question.

One found that readers of climate fiction "are younger, more liberal, and more concerned about climate change than nonreaders," and that climate fiction "reminds concerned readers of the severity of climate change while impelling them to imagine environmental futures and consider the impact of climate change on human and nonhuman life. However, the actions that resulted from readers' heightened consciousness reveal that awareness is only as valuable as the cultural messages about possible actions to take that are in circulation. Moreover, the responses of some readers suggest that works of climate fiction might lead some people to associate climate change with intensely negative emotions, which could prove counterproductive to efforts at environmental engagement or persuasion."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schneider-Mayerson|first=Matthew|date=November 2018|title=The Influence of Climate Fiction: An Empirical Survey of Readers|url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/environmental-humanities/article/10/2/473/136689/The-Influence-of-Climate-FictionAn-Empirical|journal=Environmental Humanities|volume=10}}</ref>

Another empirical study, focused on the novel ''[[The Water Knife]]'', found that cautionary climate fiction set in a dystopic future can be effective at educating readers about climate injustice and leading readers to empathize with the victims of climate change, including [[Environmental migrant|environmental migrants]]. However, its results suggest that dystopic climate narratives might lead to support for [[Ecofascism|reactionary responses to climate change]]. Based on this result, it cautioned that "not all climate fiction is progressive," despite the hopes of many authors, critics, and readers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schneider-Mayerson|first=Matthew|date=2020-05-01|title="Just as in the Book"?
