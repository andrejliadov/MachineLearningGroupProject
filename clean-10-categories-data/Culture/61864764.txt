"'''It's Decorative Gourd Season, Motherfuckers'''" is a 2009 essay by Colin Nissan that was published in [[McSweeney's|''McSweeney’s Internet Tendency'']]. The essay parodies people who are enthusiastic fans of autumn and has become a cultural touchstone. Yearly, the piece goes viral at the beginning of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and has spawned parodies and spin-offs. 

== Essay ==
===Creation===
Nissan, who is a self-proclaimed fan of autumn, pitched the essay to ''McSweeney's Internet Tendency'' in 2009.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/decorative-gourd-season/544232/|title='It's Decorative Gourd Season, Motherfuckers' Will Never Die|last=Beck|first=Julie|date=2017-10-30|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref> At first, Nissan was unsure about the profanity-heavy piece. However, with the help of the ''McSweeney's'' editor, Nissan narrowed down the curse words used to just using the term "fuck" and modified the ending making the essay funnier and more positive.<ref name=":2" />

===Synopsis===
The piece is written from the point of view of a person who is overly obsessed with autumn.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/23/autumn-fall-mania-pumpkin-spice-lattes|title=There's something about autumn: why do people love fall so much?|last=Matei|first=Adrienne|date=2019-09-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-11|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The narrator, feeling the change of the season, wants to engage in a number of stereotypical autumnal activities such as placing "[[Shellac|shellacked]] vegetables" into a wicker [[cornucopia]] to make a centerpiece for a table.<ref name=":0" /> The piece both parodies and celebrates autumn and the people who are enthusiastic about the season by highlighting contradictions between the "Genteel, white, upper class, rural or suburban" world of people popularly conceived as to be fans of autumn and decorative gourds, and the "gritty, expletive-filled diatribe of excess" presented by the essay.<ref name="powell">{{cite journal |last1=Powell |first1=Lisa Jordan |last2=Engelhardt |first2=Elizabeth S.

== Impact ==
When the essay was released, it garnered one million views in several days.<ref name=":0" /> As of 2019, ten years after its publication, the essay is ''McSweeney's Internet Tendency''{{'}}s second-most-read piece.<ref name=":1" /> Every year since its publication at the start of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere, the piece [[Viral phenomenon|goes viral]] on social media.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/09/21/25427495/the-author-of-its-decorative-gourd-season-motherfuckers-does-not-get-residuals-but-he-did-get-a-mug|title=Q&A with the Author of "It's Decorative Gourd Season, Motherfuckers"|last=Herzog|first=Katie|date=September 21, 2017|website=The Stranger|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref> At least a dozen monologues of readers performing the essay have been posted to [[YouTube]].<ref name="powell" />

Nissan was not paid for the essay and receives no royalties from the piece's yearly popularity.<ref name=":2" /> However, he does receive royalties from the mug that ''McSweeney's'' made with a quote from the essay. Nissan enjoys the notoriety that comes from writing a piece of perennial viral content and thinks it "is much more than I could ever have gotten from a residual".<ref name=":2" />
