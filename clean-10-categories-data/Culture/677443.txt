'''''Homo faber''''' ([[Latin]] for "[[Human being|Man]] the Maker") is the concept that human beings are able to control their fate and their environment as a result of the use of tools.

== Original phrase ==

In Latin literature, [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] uses this term in his ''Sententiæ'', referring to the ability of man to control his destiny and what surrounds him: ''Homo faber suae quisque fortunae'' ("Every man is the artifex of his destiny").

In older [[anthropology|anthropological]] discussions, ''Homo faber'', as the "working man", is confronted with ''[[Homo ludens]]'', the "playing man", who is concerned with amusements, humor, and leisure. It is also used in [[George Kubler]]'s book, [[The Shape of Time]] as a reference to individuals who create works of art.<ref>{{harv|Kubler|1962|page=10}}</ref>

== Modern usage ==

The classic ''homo faber suae quisque fortunae'' was "rediscovered" by [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] in 14th century and was central in the [[Italian Renaissance]].

In the 20th century, [[Max Scheler]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]  made the philosophical concept central again.

[[Henri Bergson]] also referred to the concept in ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' (1907), defining [[intelligence]], in its original sense, as the "faculty to create artificial objects, in particular tools to make tools, and to indefinitely variate its makings."

''[[Homo Faber (novel)|Homo Faber]]'' is the title of an influential novel by the Swiss author [[Max Frisch]], published in 1957.

== Other contemporary era mentions ==
''Homo faber'' can be also used in opposition or juxtaposition to ''[[Demiurge|deus faber]]'' ("God the Creator"), an archetype of which are the various [[Vulcan (mythology)|gods of the forge]].

''Homo faber'' is used by [[Pierre Schaeffer]] in the [[Traité des objects Musicaux]] as the man creator of music, which uses its brute experience, an instinctive practice in music creation; Concluding that the ''homo faber''  aways precedes the [[Homo sapiens]] in the process of creation.

Frisch' book was made into the film ''[[Voyager (film)|Voyager]]'', starring [[Sam Shepard]] and [[Julie Delpy]].

''Homo Faber'' was one of the five [[IB Middle Years Programme|International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme]] areas of interaction, before it was replaced with "Human Ingenuity".

The concept of ''homo faber'' is referenced in [[Umberto Eco]]'s "Open Work". Eco refutes its negative connotation and instead argues that ''homo faber'' is a manifestation of man's innate being in nature. Use of ''homo faber'' in this negative light is argued by Eco to represent the alienation from and objectification of nature.

"Homo Faber" is also the title of a short poem by [[Frank Bidart]] that is included in his collection ''Desire'' (1997).

''Homo faber'' is often placed in juxtaposition to ''homo adorans'', the worshiping man.  In other words, under traditional [[Judeo-Christian]] philosophy, the ultimate purpose of humankind is to worship God, whereas, under (for example) [[Marxist]] or [[Capitalist]] ideology, the purpose of humankind was embedded in what he or she can make or produce.
