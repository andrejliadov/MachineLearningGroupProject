The '''Three Treasures''' or '''Three Jewels''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|三|寶}}|p=''sānbǎo''| w=''san-pao''}}) are basic [[virtues]] in [[Taoism]]. Although the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' originally used ''sanbao'' to mean "[[compassion]]", "[[frugality]]", and "[[humility]]", the term was later used to translate the [[Three Jewels]] ([[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]) in [[Chinese Buddhism]], and to mean the [[Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)|Three Treasures]] ([[Jing (Chinese medicine)|jing]], [[qi]], and [[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]) in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]].

==Tao Te Ching==
''Sanbao'' "three treasures" first occurs in ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' chapter 67, which [[Lin Yutang]] (1948:292) says contains [[Laozi]]'s "most beautiful teachings":

<blockquote>
{{lang|zh-Hant|天下皆謂我道大，似不肖。夫唯大，故似不肖。若肖久矣。其細也夫！我有三寶，持而保之。一曰慈，二曰儉，三曰不敢為天下先。慈故能勇；儉故能廣；不敢為天下先，故能成器長。今舍慈且勇；舍儉且廣；舍後且先；死矣！夫慈以戰則勝，以守則固。天將救之，以慈衛之。}}</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Every one under heaven says that our Way is greatly like folly. But it is just because it is great, that it seems like folly. As for things that do not seem like folly — well, there can be no question about ''their'' smallness!<br>
Here are my three treasures. Guard and keep them! The first is pity; the second, frugality; the third, refusal to be 'foremost of all things under heaven'. <br>
For only he that pities is truly able to be brave; <br>
Only he that is frugal is able to be profuse. <br>
Only he that refuses to be foremost of all things <br>
Is truly able to become chief of all Ministers. <br>
At present your bravery is not based on pity, nor your profusion on frugality, nor your vanguard on your rear; and this is death. But pity cannot fight without conquering or guard without saving. Heaven arms with pity those whom it would not see destroyed. (tr. Waley 1958:225)</blockquote>

[[Arthur Waley]] describes these Three Treasures as, "The three rules that formed the practical, political side of the author's teaching (1) abstention from aggressive war and capital punishment, (2) absolute simplicity of living, (3) refusal to assert active authority."

===Chinese terminology===
The first of the Three Treasures is ''ci'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|慈}}| p=''cí''|w=''tz'u''|l=compassion, tenderness, love, mercy, kindness, gentleness, benevolence}}), which is also a [[Classical Chinese]] term for "mother" (with "tender love, nurturing " semantic associations). ''Tao Te Ching'' chapters 18 and 19 parallel ''ci'' ("parental love") with ''xiao'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|孝}} "filial love; filial piety"). [[Wing-tsit Chan]] (1963:219) believes "the first is the most important" of the Three Treasures, and compares ''ci'' with [[Confucianist]] ''ren'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|仁}} "humaneness; benevolence"), which the ''Tao Te Ching'' (e.g., chapters 5 and 38) mocks.

The second is ''jian'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|儉}}|labels=no|p=''jiǎn''|w=''chien''|l=frugality, moderation, economy, restraint, be sparing}}), a practice that the ''Tao Te Ching'' (e.g., chapter 59) praises. Ellen M. Chen (1989:209) believes ''jian'' is "organically connected" with the Taoist metaphor ''[[Pu (Daoism)|pu]]'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|樸}} "uncarved wood; simplicity"), and "stands for the economy of nature that does not waste anything. When applied to the moral life it stands for the simplicity of desire."

The third treasure is a six-character phrase instead of a single word: ''Bugan wei tianxia xian'' {{lang|zh-Hant|不敢為天下先}} "not dare to be first/ahead in the world". 
Chen notes that
<blockquote>The third treasure, daring not be at the world's front, is the Taoist way to avoid premature death. To be at the world's front is to expose oneself, to render oneself vulnerable to the world's destructive forces, while to remain behind and to be humble is to allow oneself time to fully ripen and bear fruit. This is a treasure whose secret spring is the fear of losing one's life before one's time. This fear of death, out of a love for life, is indeed the key to Taoist wisdom. (1989:209) </blockquote>

In the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]] version of the ''Tao Te Ching'', this traditional "Three Treasures" chapter 67 is chapter 32, following the traditional last chapter (81, 31). Based upon this early silk manuscript, Robert G. Henricks (1989:160) concludes that "Chapters 67, 68, and 69 should be read together as a unit." Besides some graphic variants and [[phonetic loan character]]s, like ''ci'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|兹}} "mat, this") for ''ci'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|慈}} "compassion, love", clarified with the "heart radical" {{lang|zh-Hant|心}}), the most significant difference with the received text is the addition of ''heng'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|恆}}, "constantly, always") with "I constantly have three …" ({{lang|zh-Hant|我恆有三}}) instead of "I have three …" ({{lang|zh-Hant|我有三}}).

===English translations===
The language of the ''Tao Te Ching'' is notoriously difficult to translate, as illustrated by the diverse English renditions of "Three Treasures" below.

A consensus translation of the Three Treasures could be: [[compassion]] or [[love]], [[frugality]] or [[simplicity]], and [[humility]] or [[modesty]].

==Other meanings==
In addition to these Taoist "Three Treasures", Chinese ''sanbao'' can also refer to the [[Three Treasures (traditional Chinese medicine)|Three Treasures]] in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] or the [[Three Jewels]] in [[Buddhism]]. [[Victor H. Mair]] (1990:110) notes that Chinese Buddhists chose the Taoist term ''sanbao'' to translate [[Sanskrit]] ''[[triratna]]'' or ''ratnatraya'' ("three jewels"), and "It is not at all strange that the Taoists would take over this widespread ancient Indian expression and use it for their own purposes."

[[Erik Zürcher]], who studied influences of Buddhist doctrinal terms in Daoism, noted (1980:115) two later meanings of ''sanbao'': ''Dao'' {{lang|zh-Hant|道}} "the Way", ''jing'' {{lang|zh-Hant|經}} "the Scriptures", and ''shi'' {{lang|zh-Hant|師}} "the Master" seems to be patterned after Buddhist usage; ''Tianbao jun'' {{lang|zh-Hant|天寶君}} "Lord of Celestial Treasure", ''Lingbao jun'' {{lang|zh-Hant|靈寶君}} "Lord of Numinous Treasure", and ''Shenbao jun'' {{lang|zh-Hant|神寶君}} "Lord of Divine Treasure" are the ''Sanyuan'' {{lang|zh-Hant|三元}} "Three Primes" of the [[Lingbao School]].
