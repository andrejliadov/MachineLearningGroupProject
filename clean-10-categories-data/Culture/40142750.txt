Peng’s Coefficient is an economic term which refers to the proportion of an individual’s spending on culture- and spirit-related products or services, such as books, movie, [[opera]], concert, travelling, training and so forth, to her/his total expenditure. Peng’s Coefficient is inversely proportional to Engel’s [[Coefficient]], because the more proportion people spend on food, the less proportion on culture and spirit.
The concept was named after its creator Peng Bing from [[China]].


Equation: P=S/T
(P refers to Peng’s Coeffient, S refers to culture and spirit-related spending, T refers to total expenditure)
