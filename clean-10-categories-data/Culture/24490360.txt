The '''[[cuckoo clock]]''', more than any other kind of timepiece, has often featured in literature, music, cinema, television, etc., in the [[Western culture]], as a [[metaphor]] or [[allegory]] of innocence, childhood, old age, past, fun, [[mental disorder]], etc. It has apparently been viewed more as a symbol or a toy -a folksy musical apparatus with animated figures- fascinating and a bit mysterious rather than as a serious timekeeper.<ref>Richard Mühe & Beatrice Techen, ''Beha Clocks in the Black Forest Manner''. In: NAWCC Bulletin, December 2001: p. 739.</ref>

Although the cuckoo clock functions as a symbol of Switzerland and Swissness, in fact it only has a slim connection with that country in terms of production. Its real home is the [[Black Forest]] of Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of the Black Forest Cuckoo Clock {{!}} Bavarian ClockWorks|url=https://www.bavarianclockworks.com/history-of-the-cuckoo-clock/|access-date=2020-09-01|website=www.bavarianclockworks.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=GmbH|first=WIBROS|title=Cuckoo-Clocks - Buy Original German Cuckoo-Clock|url=https://www.cuckoopalace.com/cuckoo-clocks-blog/history-of-the-german-cuckoo-clock|access-date=2020-09-01|language=en}}</ref>

== Science and technology ==
Inside Sierra Diablo mountains ([[Texas]]), is being built the monumental [[10,000 Year Clock]] based upon an idea of [[Daniel Hillis]] who in 1995<ref>[http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2011/06/the_clock_in_th.php The Clock in the Mountain. The Technium. ]</ref> expressed as follows: ''"I want to build a clock that ticks once a year. The century hand advances once every 100 years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium. I want the cuckoo to come out every millennium for the next 10,000 years."''<ref>[http://www.10000yearclock.net/learnmore.html The 10.000 Year Clock official website.]</ref> Funded by [[Jeff Bezos]],<ref>[https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/06/10000-year-clock/all/1 Dylan Tweney, How to Make a Clock Run for 10.000 Years. Wired.com.]</ref> it is designed to run for ten millennia with minimal maintenance and interruption.<ref>[http://longnow.org/clock/ The Long Now Foundation website.]</ref>

The Discovey Channel TV series [[Big!]], consisted of a team of craftspeople, in welding and metal construction, manufacturing the world's biggest items scaled up to proportions for the sake of setting world records, the devices had to function to qualify. One of the enlarged objects was a cuckoo clock in the episode number 9, although the [[Guinness World Record]] was not finally achieved.

In 2016 [[Lego]], as part of his Lego Mindstorms Remix Challenge, gave 48 hours to four company designers to come up with a new item by combining two different existing products, the Lego Mindstorms EV3 (31313) and the Lego Technic Heavy Lift Helicopter (42052) sets. The winner model was a cuckoo and alarm clock by Jørn Kristian Thomsen. The cuckoo bird pops out to ‘cuckoo’ every 15 minutes and the alarm function triggers a moving, shooting vehicle to get you out of bed.<ref>[https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/remix Lego Mindstorms Remix Challenge]</ref>

In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love. They had five hundred years of democracy and peace. And what did that produce? The cuckoo clock." This remark was not in the script by [[Graham Greene]] but was added by Welles. Greene wrote in a letter: "What happened was that during the shooting of ''The Third Man'' it was found necessary for the timing to insert another sentence." Welles said the lines came from "an old Hungarian play". The painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] had said, "The Swiss in their mountains... What more worthy people! Yet, the perverse and scornful will none of it, and the sons of patriots are left with the clock that turns the mill, and the sudden cuckoo, with difficulty restrained in its box!" In ''This is Orson Welles'' (1993), Welles is quoted as saying "When the picture came out, the Swiss very nicely pointed out to me that they've never made any cuckoo clocks."<ref>Nigel Rees, ''Brewer's Famous Quotations'', Sterling, 2006, pp. 485–86.</ref>

The British comedy [[Dave Allen at Large]] has a sketch taking place in the [[American West]], in which an outlaw loads his revolver and heads for a [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] just before noon, against the pleas and begging of his woman not to go through with it.  He tells her, "It's high noon and a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.  There ain't no other time I can do it!"  He goes into the saloon where there is a cuckoo clock on the wall.  At the stroke of twelve, when the door on the cuckoo clock swings open he shoots the bird.  He then tells her, "Like I said, there ain't no other time I can do it!"

British comedian [[Eric Sykes]] frequently obtained humour from the cuckoo clock in his house in the 1970s sit-com [[Sykes (TV series)|Sykes]]. Sykes and on -screen Sister Hattie Jaques treated the clock as though it were a pet, and spoke it as though it was alive. The temperamental bird inside was called Peter, who could usually be called upon to 'cuckoo' at the most opportune moment.<ref>[http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/sykes.htm Sykes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104192343/http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/sykes.htm |date=4 January 2010 }}</ref>
