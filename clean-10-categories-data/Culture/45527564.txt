The '''3D Print Canal House''' is a three-year, publicly accessible "Research & Design by Doing" project in which an international team of partners from various sectors works together on [[3D printing]] a [[canal house]] in [[Amsterdam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/491666/first-3d-printed-house-to-be-built-in-amsterdam|title=First 3D Printed House to Be Built In Amsterdam|work=ArchDaily|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>

By building the house, all parties research the possibilities of 3D printing architecture and form connections between design, science, culture, building, software, communities and the city.  The project serves as both an exhibition of 3D printing technology, as well as a research site into 3D printing architecture. The project is initiated by DUS architects and the site, in Amsterdam North, opened to the public on March 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opp.today/how-3d-printing-by-robots-is-set-to-transform-building/|title=OPP.Today - How 3D printing by robots is set to transform building|work=OPP.Today|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/home-and-garden/architecture/the-printed-house-coming-soon/article24432799/|title=The printed house, coming soon: Futurists see 3-D technology radically changing the way houses are built|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>

== Kamermaker ==
The house is constructed by a [[fused deposition modeling]] printer developed by DUS: the Kamermaker ("Room builder"), able to print elements of up to 2.2×2.2×3.5 metres. It is a movable pavilion with the size of a shipping container. The machine itself is 6 meters tall. The Kamermaker can be moved by truck or by ship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/visiting/what-to-do/attractions-and-sights/overview-of-attractions/3d-print-canal-house|title=3D Print Canal House|work=iamsterdam.com|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>
