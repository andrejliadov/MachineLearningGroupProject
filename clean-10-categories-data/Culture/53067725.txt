Many {{nihongo|'''Japanese [[cemeteries]]'''|日本人墓地| Nihonjin bochi}} '''and [[cenotaphs]]''' are located outside of [[Japan]] for [[Japanese people]] who have died in war or other historical events. This article lists [[tomb]]s and [[Burial ground|burial]] places.

== History ==
The oldest known [[Japantown]] featuring a Japanese cemetery is in [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya District|Ayutthaya]], [[Thailand]], which was established between the 14th and 18th centuries. The oldest known Japanese national recorded by name and buried outside Japan is the early explorer [[Yamada Nagamasa]].

Wars, particularly [[World War II]], have accounted for a majority of the Japanese burial sites located outside of Japan. There is a cemetery for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in [[Malta]], multiple cites for [[Japanese prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|Japanese prisoners of war]] in [[Siberia]], and many [[Pacific War]] sites, which include Japanese cemeteries, cenotaphs, and [[Cadaver|remains]] in the [[Nanpō Islands]], [[Philippines|the Philippines]], [[New Guinea]], and other [[Pacific Islands]]. There have been multiple efforts by veteran organizations and the [[Japanese government]] to return remains to living relatives.

Monuments to victims of the United States' [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment of citizens of Japanese ancestry]] are prevalent in the western US.
