'''Bashu culture''' ({{zh|c=巴蜀文化 |p=Bāshǔ Wénhuà}}), sometimes also named '''Chongqing-Sichuan culture''', refers to the culture of [[Sichuan]] province and [[Chongqing]] city, China and the surrounding areas, including parts of the neighboring provinces of [[Yunnan]] and [[Guizhou]], since the [[Han Chinese subgroups|Han Chinese groups]] in these two provinces also primarily speak Southwestern Mandarin nowadays. It has a long history of over 3000 years, widely regarded as one of the cradles of modern Chinese [[civilization]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huaxia.com/qqla/lbyl/wh/2006/06/218625.html |script-title=zh:巴蜀文化渊源 |website=huaxia.com |date=June 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://hk.chiculture.net/index.php?file=topic_description&old_id=30037 |script-title=zh:巴蜀文化 |website=hk.chiculture.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bswh.net/ |script-title=zh:四川师范大学巴蜀文化中心 |publisher=Center for Bashu Cultural Studies, [[Sichuan Normal University]]}}</ref>
