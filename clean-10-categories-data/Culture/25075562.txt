In 1964, Cyril Taylor and his partners left [[Procter & Gamble]] to form the American Institute For Foreign Study (AIFS). With the assistance of the late Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in 1967, AIFS created the AIFS Foundation, which awards grants and scholarships to students for participation in study abroad programs and provides grants to high schools and other institutions for the purpose of international and educational travel.<ref>[http://www.aifsfoundation.org/mission.htm AIFS Foundation Mission Statement] aifsfoundation.org</ref> The AIFS Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) tax exempt public charity and a U.S. Department of State designated sponsor of the [[J-1 visa|J-1 Exchange Visitor Visa]].
