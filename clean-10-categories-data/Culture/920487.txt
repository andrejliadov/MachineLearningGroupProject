'''Blood brother''' can refer to one of two things: a male [[Kinship|related by birth]], or two or more men not related by [[birth]] who have sworn loyalty to each other. This is in modern times usually done in a ceremony, known as a '''blood [[oath]]''', where each person makes a small cut, usually on a finger, hand or the [[forearm]], and then the two cuts are pressed together and bound, the idea being that each person's blood now flows in the other participant's [[veins]]. The act may carry a risk due to [[blood-borne disease]]s. The process usually provides a participant with a heightened symbolic sense of attachment with another participant.

The Norsemen entering into the pact of foster brotherhood ({{lang-is|[[:is:Fóstbræðralag|Fóstbræðralag]]}}) involved a rite whereby they let their blood flow while they ducked underneath an arch formed by a strip of turf propped up by a spear or spears. An example is described in ''[[Gísla saga]]''.<ref>{{citation|last=Poole |first=Russell |author-link=Russell Poole |title=Claiming Kin Skaldic-Style |work=Verbal Encounters: Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse Studies for Roberta Frank |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8naeLlWGikC&pg=PA278 |page=278 |isbn=9780802080110}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Dasent|1866}}|translator=George Webbe Dasent|translator-link=George Webbe Dasent |others=Mildmay, C.

''[[Örvar-Oddr's saga]]'' contains another notable account of blood brotherhood. [[Örvar-Oddr]], after fighting the renowned Swedish warrior [[Hjalmar]] to a draw, entered into foster-brotherhood with him {{Dubious span|by this turf-raising ritual.

In the mythology of northern Europe, [[Gunther]] and [[Högni]] became the blood brothers of [[Sigurd]] when he married their sister [[Gudrun]]; in [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring Cycle]]'', the same occurs between [[Gunther]] and Wagner's version of Sigurd, [[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]], which is marked by the "Blood Brotherhood [[Leitmotiv]]". Additionally, it is briefly stated in [[Lokasenna]] that [[Odin]] and [[Loki]] are blood brothers.

===Scythia===
Among the [[Scyth]]ians, the covenantors would allow their blood to drip into a cup; the blood was subsequently mixed with wine and drunk by both participants. Every man was limited to having at most three blood brotherhoods at any time, lest his loyalties be distrusted; as a consequence, blood brotherhood was highly sought after and often preceded by a lengthy period of affiliation and friendship ([[Lucian]], ''[[Toxaris]]''). 
4th-century BC depictions of two Scythian warriors drinking from a single [[drinking horn]] (most notably in a gold appliqué from [[Kul-Oba]]) have been associated with the Scythian oath of blood brotherhood.<ref>Caspar Meyer, ''Greco-Scythian Art and the Birth of Eurasia: From Classical Antiquity to Russian Modernity'',  OUP (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=884TAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA246#v=onepage&q&f=false 246 (fig. 98b)] "Gold relief appliqué showing two Scythians drinking from one drinking horn.

The Hungarian [[hajduk]]s had a similar ceremony, though the wine was often replaced with milk so that the blood would be more visible.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===East Asia===
In [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]], the act and ceremony of becoming blood brothers is generally seen as a [[tribal]] relationship, that is, to bring about alliance between tribes. It was practiced for this reason most notably among the [[Mongol]]s and [[Chinese history|early Chinese]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', the Chinese classical literature, the three main characters took an oath of blood brother, the [[Oath of the Peach Garden]], by sacrificing a black ox and a white horse and swearing faith;<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6irEoGgDrm4C&pg=PA19 |page=19 |first=Mervyn Llewelyn |last=Wynne |title=Triad Societies: Western Accounts of the History, Sociology and Linguistics of Chinese Secret Societies, Volume 5 |publisher=Routledge |orig-year=1941 |year=200|isbn=9780415243971 }}</ref> other blood oaths involving animal sacrifice were characteristic of rebel groups, such as the uprising led by [[Deng Maoqi]] in the 1440s, of criminal organizations, such as the [[triad (organized crime)|triads]] or the pirates of [[Lin Daoqian]], and of non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] ethnic minorities such as the [[Mongols]] or [[Manchu]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L48YDQAAQBAJ |page=46 |last=Ownby |first=David |chapter=Chinese Hui and the Early Modern Social Order: Evidence from Eighteenth-Century Southeast China |title=Secret Societies Reconsidered: Perspectives on the Social History of Early Modern South China and Southeast Asia|editor-last=Ownby |editor-first=David |editor2-first=Mary |editor2-last=Somers Heidhues|isbn=9781315288031 |date=2016-09-16 }}<br>{{Cite book |page=155 |last=ter Haar |first=Barend |chapter=Messianism and the Heaven and Earth Society: Approaches to Heaven and Earth Society Texts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L48YDQAAQBAJ |title=Secret Societies Reconsidered: Perspectives on the Social History of Early Modern South China and Southeast Asia|editor-last=Ownby |editor-first=David |editor2-first=Mary |editor2-last=Somers Heidhues|isbn=9781315288031 |date=2016-09-16 }}</ref> In Mongolian history, Genghis Khan the Great had an anda, blood brother in Mongolian.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/anda|title=Anda {{!}} oath|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}</ref>

[[File:The Blood Compact by Juan Luna.jpg|thumb|''[[El Pacto de Sangre]]'', a romanticized painting of the ''[[Sandugo]]'' [[blood compact]] ritual between the [[Spaniards|Spanish]] explorer [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] and [[Datu Sikatuna]] of [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]]; by [[Juan Luna]] (1886)]]
In the [[Philippines]], [[blood compact]]s (''sandugo'' or ''sanduguan'', literally "one blood") were ancient rituals intended to seal a friendship or treaty, or to validate an agreement. They are described in the records of early Spanish and Portuguese explorers to the islands. The most well-known version of the ritual from the [[Visayan people]] involves mixing a drop of blood from both parties into a single cup of wine that is then drunk. Other versions also exist, like in [[Palawan]] which describes a ritual involving making a cut on the chest and then daubing the blood on the tongue and forehead.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Primo Viaggio Intorno Al Mondo |last1=Pigafetta |first1=Antonio |title=The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898, Volume XXXIII, 1519-1522|editor1= Emma Helen Blair|editor2=James Alexander Robertson  |date=1906 |publisher=Arthur H.

===Africa===
The blood oath was used in much the same fashion as has already been described in much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The British colonial administrator [[Lord Lugard]] is famous for having become blood brothers with numerous African chiefs as part of his political policy while in Africa. A powerful blood brother of his was the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] chieftain [[Waiyaki Wa Hinga]]. [[David Livingstone]] wrote of a similar practice called 'Kasendi'.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Blood Covenant|first=H.

===Southeastern Europe===
Blood brothers among larger groups were common in ancient [[Southeastern Europe]] where, for example, whole companies of soldiers would become one family through the ceremony. It was perhaps most prevalent in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, as it helped the oppressed people to fight the enemy more effectively; blood brotherhoods were common in what is today [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], [[Republic of North Macedonia]]. Christianity also recognized sworn brotherhood in a ceremony (known as {{lang-gr|[[adelphopoiesis]]}}, {{lang-sla|pobratimstvo}} in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches; known as {{lang-la|ordo ad fratres faciendum}} in the [[Roman Catholic]] church). The tradition of intertwining arms and drinking wine is also believed to be a representation of becoming blood brothers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

=== Folklore===
* The Norse gods [[Loki]] and [[Odin]] are famously stated to have mixed blood in ''days of old'' in ''Lokasenna''. This has been taken as an explanation why Loki is at all tolerated by the gods. 
* [[Liu Bei]], [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Fei]]. In the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]], these three men swore in their famous [[Oath of the Peach Garden]] that despite not being born on the same day, their sworn brotherhood would end with them dying on the same day. Histories only mention that the three men were "close like brothers".
* In the Chinese tale ''[[Journey to the West]]'', [[Sun Wukong]] (the Monkey King) became blood brothers with [[List of Journey to the West characters#Bull Demon King, Princess Iron Fan and associates|Niu Mowang]] (the Bull Demon King), but later on this brother relationship was forgotten because of a conflict that occurred involving the bull demon's son that caused other problems for Wukong.
