'''Visual arts education''' is the area of learning that is based upon only the kind of art that one can see, [[visual arts]]—[[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[printmaking]], and design in [[jewelry]], [[pottery]], [[weaving]], [[fabrics]], etc. and design applied to more practical fields such as commercial graphics and home furnishings. Contemporary topics include [[photography]], [[video]], [[film]], [[design]], and [[computer art]].  Art education may focus on students creating art, on learning to criticize or appreciate art, or some combination of the two.

Art is often taught through [[drawing]], painting, sculpture, installation, and mark making. Drawing is viewed as an empirical activity which involves seeing, interpreting and discovering appropriate marks to reproduce an observed phenomenon. Drawing instruction has been a component of formal education in the West since the [[Hellenistic period]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Art Education|page= 177

An alternative approach to art education involves an emphasis on imagination, both in interpreting and creating art. Many educators will ask their students "Why do you think the artist made this choice?", once they've given an answer, they'll then give them context of the piece, then ask them again. This is to get students to consider the deeper meaning behind works, rather than just showing them a pretty picture. Art education is also about experimentation and purposeful play and linking their art to conceptual messages and personal experiences. <ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Research and Policy in Art Education|page=769

|first1=Elliot W.|last1=Eisner|first2=Michael D.|last2=Day|year=2004|ref=harv}}</ref> Allowing students to connect a piece to emotion, helps them better understand how the artwork connects to the artist and their subject, developing their critical thinking skills. Alternative approaches, such as [[visual culture]] and issue-based approaches in which students explore societal and personal issues through art, also inform art education today.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Issues in Art and Design Teaching|page=195

Prominent curricular models for art education include:
*A sixfold model divided into "Creative-Productive, Cultural-Historical and Critical-Responsive” components in some provinces of Canada<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Drawing to Visual Culture: A History of Art Education in Canada

|first=Harold |last=Pearse |year=2006|ref=harv}}</ref>
*Discipline Based Art Education (DBAE) came to favor in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s, and it focused on specific skills including techniques, art criticism and art history. Heavily backed by the [[Getty Education Institute for the Arts]], DBAE faded after the Institute ceased funding in 1998.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Curriculum Studies Handbook – The Next Moment

*Teaching for Artistic Behavior (TAB) is a choice-based model that began in the 1970s in Massachusetts in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://teachingforartisticbehavior.org/|title=Teaching for Artistic Behavior|accessdate=2015-01-24}}</ref> TAB suggests that students should be the artists and be guided on their own individual artistic interests.

In addition, especially in higher education in the [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]] tradition, art is often taught as "art appreciation", a subject for [[aesthetic]] criticism rather than direct engagement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Critical Issues in Competency Based Education|page= 10

Some studies show that strong art education programs have demonstrated increased student performance in other academic areas, due to art activities' exercising their brains' right hemispheres and delateralizing their thinking.<ref>{{cite book |last= Jensen |first= Eric |title= Arts with the Brain in Mind |year= 2001 |publisher= [[Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development]] |location= Alexandria, Virginia |isbn= 0-87120-514-9 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/artswithbraininm00jens/page/57 57–58, 81] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/artswithbraininm00jens/page/57 }}</ref> Also see [[Betty Edwards]]' ''[[Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain]]''.

Art education is not limited to formal educational institutions. Some professional artists provide private or semi-private instruction in their own studios. This may take the form of an [[apprenticeship]] in which the student learns from a professional artist while assisting the artist with their work.  One form of this teaching style is the [[Atelier Method]] as exemplified by [[Gustave Moreau]] who taught Picasso, Braque and many other artists.{{sfn|Efland|1990|pp=52-53}}

===Apprenticeship===
[[File:Sweerts, Michael - The Drawing Class - 1656-58.jpg|thumb|''The Drawing Class'', by [[Michiel Sweerts]], c. 1656]]
Historically art was taught in Europe via the [[atelier method]] system<ref>[http://theatelier.org/ Atelier instruction]</ref> where artists took on apprentices who learned their trade in much the same way as that of [[trade guild|guilds]] such as the [[stonemason]]s or [[goldsmith]]s. During their free time formal training took place in art workshops or, more often, in homes or alone outside. It was in these ateliers that artists learned the craft through apprenticeship to masters, a relationship that was controlled by guild statutes. Florentine contracts dating from the late 13th century state that the master was expected to clothe and feed the apprentice, who was called upon to be a faithful servant in return. An apprentice often paid the master during the early years of his education; assuming the apprenticeship was productive, the student would be compensated later in his training. Northern European workshops featured similar terms.<ref>Dunkerton, Jill, et al. ''Giotto to Durer: Early Renaissance Painting in the National Gallery'', 136. Yale University Press, New Haven, 1991. {{ISBN|0-300-05070-4}}</ref>

Initially, learning to draw was a priority in this system. [[Michelangelo]] recommended that a young painter spend a year on drawing alone, then six years grinding colors, preparing panels and using gold leaf, during which time the study of drawing would continue. Another six years would be required to master fresco and tempera painting.<ref>Dunkerton, Jill, et al. 136</ref>

Historically, design has had some precedence over the [[fine arts]] with [[design school|schools of design]] being established all over Europe in the 18th century. These examples of skill and values from the early European art inspired later generations, including the Colonists of early America.

===Cultural appropriation within the classroom===

Individuals who employ cultural appropriation have the ability to produce works of considerable aesthetic merit.<ref>James O. Young, “Art, Authenticity and Appropriation” Front. Philos. China (2006) 3:455–476 (2006): 456, accessed October 2011, DOI 10.1007/s11466-006-0019-2</ref> Using properties of art from different cultures such as decoration or emulation of creative process can foster a greater understanding and appreciation of crafts from different cultures. This technique can be appreciated in the production of African or Native-American mask making projects, where students emulate technique and explore new material use and construction methods which esteem those practices of different cultures.<ref>Elizabeth Manley Delacruz, “Approaches to Multiculturalism in Art Education Curriculum Products: Business as Usual” Journal of Aesthetic Education(1996): 85 Accessed November 26, 2011</ref>

==By country==

===Argentina===
Leading country in the development of the arts in [[Latin America]], in 1875 created the National Society of the Stimulus of the Arts, founded by painters [[Eduardo Schiaffino]], [[Eduardo Sívori]], and other artists. Their guild was rechartered as the National Academy of Fine Arts in 1905 and, in 1923, on the initiative of painter and academic [[Ernesto de la Cárcova]], as a department in the [[University of Buenos Aires]], the Superior Art School of the Nation. Currently, the leading educational organization for the arts in the country is the [[Universidad Nacional de las Artes|UNA Universidad Nacional de las Artes]].<ref>Institutional Transformation IUNA - Law 24.521, Ministry of Justice & Education, Argentina (text in Spanish) / http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/40000-44999/40779/norma.htm</ref>

===Australia===

Australian Universities which have Visual / Fine Art departments or courses within their institutions have moved from Studio Based teaching models, associated with Art Schools, to more integrated theoretical / practical emphasis.  University of Western Australia has moved from a master's degree with theoretical emphasis to a theoretical BA Art degree.

Studio based teaching initiatives integrating contextual and media elements have been implemented as part of a national Studio Teaching Project<ref>[http://www.studioteaching.org/ Studio Teaching Project]</ref> supported by the Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) since 2007.

===Egypt===

The first modern art school in Egypt was opened in 1908 as the Cairo College of Fine Arts.<ref>{{Cite book|ref=harv|title=Creative Reckonings: The Politics of Art and Culture in Contemporary Egypt|page=315
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0804754772|isbn=0804754772
|first=Jessica |last=Winegar |year=2006}}</ref> These early art schools largely taught the Western aesthetic traditions.  As a result, after independence there was an effort to incorporate Egyptian and Middle Eastern traditions into art and art appreciation courses.{{sfn|Winegar|2006|p=59}} However, the process was slow; students at Cairo College of Fine Arts were not able to major in non-European art history until 1999.{{sfn|Winegar|2006|p=59}}

===Italy===
[[Art school]]s were established in Italy as early as the 13th century, starting with a painting school in Venice founded by a Greek painter named Theophanes around 1200.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Byzantine Art and Culture in Rome and Italy|journal=The American Journal of Archaeology and of the History of the Fine Arts|year=1895|volume=10|first=A.L.|last=Frothingham|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kD0SAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA168|page=168}}</ref>

===The Netherlands===
The Dutch Art Teachers Association (Nederlandse Vereniging voor Tekenonderwijs) was founded in 1880 and began to publish a monthly magazine in 1884.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gahetna.nl/collectie/archief/pdf/NL-HaNA_2.19.072.01.ead.pdf |publisher=Nationaal Archief|title=Inventaris van het archief van de Nederlandse Vereniging voor Tekenonderwijs, 1880-1994|accessdate=2015-01-24}}</ref>  Since the late 20th century, the growing diversity of Dutch society has made Dutch art and art education increasingly [[multicultural]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ethnic Amsterdam: Immigrants and Urban Change in the Twentieth Century|page=112

===United Kingdom===
Formal art education emerged in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century, motivated in part by a desire to match the quality of design work being done in France.{{sfn|Macdonald|2004|p=68}}  The model initially adopted was that of the German commercial schools.{{sfn|Macdonald|2004|p=68}} [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] was particularly influential in the creation of schools of Art in the UK.<ref>{{cite book|title=The History and Philosophy of Art Education

|first=Stuart |last=Macdonald|year=2004|ref=harv}}</ref>

Currently in the UK, the art curriculum is prescribed by the government's [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] except in [[public school (United Kingdom)|public]] or fee paying schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-art-and-design-programmes-of-study|title=National curriculum in England: art and design programmes of study|date=2013-09-11|accessdate=2015-01-24}}</ref>  [[Prince Charles]] has created [[The Prince's Drawing School]] in [[Hoxton]] to preserve the teaching of academic drawing.

The study of art appreciation in America began with the Artists of Today Movement in the late 19th century and began to fade at the end of the 1920s. Picture study was an important part of the art education curriculum. Attention to the aesthetics in classrooms led to public interest in beautifying the school, home, and community, which was known as “Art in Daily Living”. The idea was to bring culture to the child to change the parents.<ref>Smith, Peter (1986,Sept.) The Ecology of Picture Study, ''Art Education''[48–54].</ref> The picture study movement died out at the end of the 1920s as a result of new ideas regarding learning art appreciation through studio work became more popular in the United States.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

American [[Philosophy of education|educational philosopher]] and [[school reform]]er [[John Dewey]] was influential in broadening access to art education in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Since [[World War II]], artist training has moved to elementary schools, and contemporary art has become an increasingly academic and intellectual field. Prior to World War II an artist did not usually need a college degree. Since that time the [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] and then the [[Master of Fine Arts]] became recommended degrees to be a professional artist, facilitated by the passage of the [[G.I. Bill]] in 1944, which sent a wave of World War II veterans off to school, art school included. University art departments quickly expanded. American artists who might once have studied at bohemian, craft-intensive schools like the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]], [[Black Mountain College]], or the [[Hans Hofmann]] School of Art in [[Greenwich Village]]; began enrolling at universities instead. By the 60s, The [[School of Visual Arts]], [[Pratt Institute]], and [[Cooper Union]] in New York City and other art schools across the country like the [[Kansas City Art Institute]], the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Yale]] had become one of the first art academies.<ref>"How to Succeed in Art" by Deborah Solomon, New York Times Magazine. June 27, 1999</ref> This trend spread from the United States around the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Enrollment in art classes at the high school level peaked in the late 1960s—early 1970s.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}  With [[No Child Left Behind]] (NCLB){{when|date=April 2012}} (which retains the arts as part of the "daily life", but does not require reporting or assessment data on this area) there has been additional decline of arts education in American public schools.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The [[United States Department of Education]] now awards Arts in Education Model Development and Dissemination grants to support organizations with art expertise in their development of artistic curricula. After 2010, an estimate of 25% of the nation's public high schools will end all art programs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Various "ed-tech" companies like [[Kadenze]] and [[edX]] have attempted to mitigate this loss through online arts education.<ref>[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/art-schools-go-mooc-new-online-platform-works-with-art-programs-at-18-colleges/56947 Art Schools Go MOOC, With A New Online Platform]</ref>

Education through the visual arts is an important and effective influence in allowing students, from an early age, to comprehend and implement the foundational democratic process emphasized within the United States societal structure.<ref name="2009_LowenfeldLecture_OliviaGude">Gude, Olivia.

Minnesota, Minneapolis. 20 April 2009</ref> In 2008, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) studied 7,900 eight-grade students in the fields of art and music. The findings of the study concluded that female students earned higher scores than their male peers in both music and visual art. <ref>{{Cite web|date=2004|title=ED report card|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e483142006-006|access-date=2020-09-20|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset}}</ref>

[[Olivia Gude]], the 2009 recipient of the National Art Education Association’s Lowenfeld Lecture Scholarship, spoke about the numerous ways in which art education is instrumental in forming an informed self- and world-aware citizen. She asserts that:
:<blockquote>Through art education, students develop enhanced skills for understanding the meaning making of others. Through quality art education, youth develop the capacity to learn several jobs much easier than others. Most significantly, engagement with the arts teaches youth to perceive complexity as pleasure and possibility, not as irritating uncertainty. Heightened self-awareness is extended to heightened awareness of others . . .<ref name="2009_LowenfeldLecture_OliviaGude"/></blockquote>

==Special education==

Art education was combined with special education even before there were reforms to create special accommodations for children with special needs in typical classrooms.  When it comes to art, [[art therapist]]s are often used to connect with students with special needs. However, some art therapists pull students out of the classroom, causing them to fall behind in their other schoolwork such as math, English, and science. Because of this, art therapy is reserved for students who do not have much chance for long-term improvements, but rather short-term developmental skills, or for those who seek to increase their all-round capabilities.<ref name="vanmeter">Van Meter, M. L. (2010.). "[http://www.arttherapy.org/upload/toolkitspecialeducation.pdf Art therapy and special education]" (PDF). Retrieved  November 24, 2011.</ref>

Special educator Jean Lokerson and art educator [[Amelia Jones]] wrote that “the art room is a place where learning disabilities can turn into learning assets.” Special needs students often come out of their shells and get enthusiastic about creating. Art is also a way that special educators teach their students fundamentals that they may not even realize.<ref name="gerber">Gerber, B. (2011). "[http://www.arteducators.org/research/resource-library/2011_NAEA_Lowenfeld_Lecture.pdf Art education and special education: A promising partnership]" (PDF). Paper presented at 2011 National Art Education Association national convention, Seattle, WA. Retrieved November 24, 2011.</ref>

There are ongoing studies that continue to prove that art and special education go hand in hand. Testing continues to prove that art in any classroom, but especially special education classrooms causes students to be motivated, enthusiastic, and in some cases, even promote learning in other subject areas.<ref>Iwai, K. (2002). "The contribution of arts education to children's lives". ''Prospects'', 32(4), 1–15.</ref>

== Current trends in theory and scholarship ==

A/r/t/ography is a method of inquiring about one’s teaching practice within an art classroom (Irwin & Springgay, 2008). It integrates theory into teaching practice and sees the class as a living organism which is susceptible to change (Irwin & Springgay,2008). Rita Irwin and Stephanie Springgay (2008), Art Education theorists and faculty at the University of British Columbia explain that  a/r/t/ography focuses on the in-between of art-making, researching and teaching and is perceived as not an environment or object but as a process of learning for the teacher and their students.
