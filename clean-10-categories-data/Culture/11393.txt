In [[Buddhism]], the '''Four Noble Truths''' [[Pali]]: ''cattāri ariyasaccāni'' [[Sanskrit]]: ''catvāri āryasatyāni''; , "The four Arya satyas") are "the truths of the [[Arhat|Noble Ones]]", the truths or realities for the "spiritually worthy ones".{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2002|p=41}}<ref group=web name="EB-Arhat">[a] [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Four-Noble-Truths Four Noble Truths: BUDDHIST PHILOSOPHY], '''Encyclopaedia Britannica''', Quote: "Although the term Four Noble Truths is well known in English, it is a misleading translation of the Pali term Chattari-ariya-saccani (Sanskrit: Chatvari-arya-satyani), because noble (Pali: ariya; Sanskrit: arya) refers not to the truths themselves but to those who recognize and understand them. A more accurate rendering, therefore, might be “four truths for the [spiritually] noble” [...]";<br>[b][http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34073/arhat ''Arhat (Buddhism)''], '''Encyclopædia Britannica'''</ref>{{sfn|Keown|2013|pp=48–62}} The truths are:
* ''[[dukkha]]'' (suffering, incapable of satisfying, painful) is an innate characteristic of existence in the realm of ''[[samsara]]'';<ref group=web name="EB-4NTa">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Four-Noble-Truths Four Noble Truths: BUDDHIST PHILOSOPHY], Encyclopaedia Britannica, Quote: "The first truth, suffering (Pali: dukkha; Sanskrit: duhkha), is characteristic of existence in the realm of rebirth, called samsara (literally “wandering”)."</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2004|pp=295-297}}. Quote: "This, bhikkhus, is the noble truth that is suffering. Birth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow and grief, physical and mental suffering, and disturbance are suffering. [...]  In short, all life is suffering, according to the Buddha’s first sermon."</ref>{{sfn|Keown|2013|pp=50–52}}
*''[[samudaya]]'' (origin, arising) of this ''dukkha'', which arises or "comes together" with ''[[taṇhā]]'' ("craving, desire or attachment");<ref group=web name="EB-4NTb">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Four-Noble-Truths Four Noble Truths: BUDDHIST PHILOSOPHY], Encyclopaedia Britannica, Quote: "The second truth is the origin (Pali and Sanskrit: samudaya) or cause of suffering, which the Buddha associated with craving or attachment in his first sermon."</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2004|pp=295–297}}. Quote: "The second truth is samudaya (arising or origin). To end suffering, the four noble truths tell us, one needs to know how and why suffering arises. The second noble truth explains that suffering arises because of craving, desire, and attachment."</ref>{{sfn|Keown|2013|pp=53–55}}
*''[[nirodha]]'' (cessation, ending) of this ''dukkha'' can be attained by the renouncement or letting go of this ''taṇhā'';{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014|page="nirodha"}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=96}}<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2004|pp=295–297}}, Quote: "The third truth follows from the second: If the cause of suffering is desire and attachment to various things, then the way to end suffering is to eliminate craving, desire, and attachment. The third truth is called nirodha, which means “ending” or “cessation.” To stop suffering, one must stop desiring."</ref>{{sfn|Keown|2013|pp=56–58}}
*''[[Buddhist paths to awakening|magga]]'' (path, [[Noble Eightfold Path]]) is the path leading to renouncement of ''tanha'' and cessation of ''dukkha''.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2004|pp=295–297}}, Quote: "This, bhikkhus, is the noble truth that is the way leading to the ending of suffering. This is the eightfold path of the noble ones: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.[..] The Buddha taught the fourth truth, maarga (Pali, magga), the path that has eight parts, as the means to end suffering."</ref>{{sfn|Keown|2013|pp=58–60}}{{sfn|Norman|2003|pp=219, 222}}

They are traditionally identified as the first teaching given by the Buddha,{{refn|group=note|name="Moksha"}} and considered one of the most important teachings in Buddhism.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55, Quote: "As the context of the Buddha's first talk on ''dhamma'', the four noble truths are recognized as perhaps the most important teaching of the Buddha."}}

The four truths appear in many grammatical forms in the ancient [[Buddhist texts]],{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=56, Quote: "There are different grammatical forms in which the four noble truths appear throughout the canonical corpus; there is no one formula for the four noble truths."}} and they have both a symbolic and a propositional function.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=223–231}} Symbolically, they represent the awakening and liberation of the Buddha, and of the potential for his followers to reach the same religious experience as him.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=56}} As propositions, the Four Truths are a conceptual framework that appear in the [[Pali canon]] and early Hybrid [[Sanskrit]] Buddhist scriptures.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55, Quote: "The four noble truths are an important part of the Buddha's biography that is recorded partially in the Pali Tipitaka as well as in the Tripitaka recorded in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit. [... They] were at the center of a specific set of teaching about the Buddha, his teachings, and the path."}} They are a part of the broader "network of teachings"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} (the "''[[Dharma#Buddhism|dhamma]]'' matrix"),{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86}} which have to be taken together.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} They provide a conceptual framework for introducing and explaining Buddhist thought, which has to be personally understood or "experienced".{{sfn|Makransky|1997|pp=27–28}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gethin_framework"}}

As a proposition, the four truths defy an exact definition, but refer to and express the basic orientation of [[Buddhism]]:{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=59}} unguarded sensory contact [[Pratītyasamutpāda|gives rise]] to [[Taṇhā|craving]] and [[Upādāna|clinging]] to [[Saṅkhāra#Conditioned things|impermanent states and things]],{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}} which are ''dukkha'',{{sfn|Khantipalo|2003|p=41}} "incapable of satisfying"<ref group=web name="Sumedho-first"/> and painful.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}}{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}}{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2002|pp=74–75}} This craving keeps us caught in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]'',{{refn|group=note|name="Samudaya"}} "wandering," usually interpreted as the endless cycle of repeated [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]],{{refn|group=note|[[Buddhist modernism]] and some Theravadins have reinterpreted these teachings as "birth of ego". See, for example Payutto,<ref name="Payutto">Payutto, ''Dependent Origination: the Buddhist Law of Causality</ref><ref group=web name="Buddhadasa">{{cite web |last=Buddhadasa |first=Bhikkhu |title=Paticcasamuppada: Practical dependent Origination |url=http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books6/Bhikkhu_Buddhadasa_Paticcasamuppada.htm |via=DhammaTalks.net}}</ref> and [[Buddhist_modernism#West:_Naturalized_Buddhism]].}} and the continued ''dukkha'' that comes with it.{{refn|group=note|name="Samsara"}} There is a way to [[Moksha|end this cycle]],{{sfn|Warder|1999|pp=45–46}}{{refn|group=note|name="Pleasure"}} namely by attaining ''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]]'', cessation of craving, whereafter rebirth and the accompanying ''dukkha'' will no longer arise again.{{refn|group=note |name="Nirodha"}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|p=304}} This can be accomplished by following the [[Noble Eightfold Path|eightfold path]],{{refn|group=note|name="Moksha"}} confining our automatic responses to sensory contact by restraining oneself, cultivating discipline and wholesome states, and practicing [[mindfulness]] and ''[[Dhyana in Buddhism|dhyana]]'' (meditation).{{sfn|Raju|1985|pp=147–151}}{{sfn|Eliot|2014|pp=39–41}}

The function of the four truths, and their importance, developed over time and the Buddhist tradition slowly recognized them as the Buddha's first teaching.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55, Quote: "However, the four noble truths do not always appear in the stories of the Buddha's enlightenment where we might expect to find them. This feature may indicate that the four noble truths emerged into the canonical tradition at some point and slowly became recognized as the first teaching of the Buddha, [...]."}} This tradition was established when ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]'', or "liberating insight", came to be regarded as liberating in itself,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=99–100, 102–111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p={{pn|date=November 2020}}}} instead of or in addition to the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=99–100, 102–111}} This "liberating insight" gained a prominent place in the sutras, and the four truths came to represent this liberating insight, as a part of the [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] story of the Buddha.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|pp=99–102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=93–111}} 

The four truths grew to be of central importance in the [[Theravada]] tradition of Buddhism by about the 5th-century CE,{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=55–56}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=230–231}} which holds that the insight into the four truths is liberating in itself.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}} They are less prominent in the [[Mahayana]] tradition, which sees the higher aims of insight into ''[[sunyata]]'', emptiness, and following the [[Bodhisattva path]] as central elements in their teachings and practice.{{sfn|Carter|1987|pp=3179–3180}} The Mahayana tradition reinterpreted the four truths to explain how a liberated being can still be "pervasively operative in this world".{{sfn|Makransky|1997|pp=346–347}} Beginning with the exploration of Buddhism by [[Colonial India|western colonialists]] in the 19th century and the development of [[Buddhist modernism]], they came to be often presented in the west as the central teaching of Buddhism,{{sfn|Harris|2006|pp=72–73}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196}} sometimes with novel modernistic reinterpretations very different from the historic Buddhist traditions in Asia.{{sfn|Keown|2009|pp=60–63, 74–85, 185–187}}{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}{{sfn|Lopez|2012|pp=39–43, 57–60, 74–76, 122–124}}

==The four truths==

===Full set – Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta===
The four truths are best known from their presentation in the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' text,{{refn|group=note|name="best-known"}} which contains two sets of the four truths,{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=295}}{{sfn|Norman|2003}} while various other sets can be found in the [[Pāli Canon]], a collection of scriptures in the [[Theravadan]] Buddhist tradition.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p={{pn|date=November 2020}}}} The full set, which is most commonly used in modern expositions,{{refn|group=note|name="best-known"|For example:<br>
* Ven. Dr. Rewata Dhamma: The Four Noble Truths [...] are: 1. The Noble Truth of Suffering (''dukkha''); 2. The Noble Truth of the origin of suffering (''samudaya''); 3. The Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering (''nirodha''); 4. The Noble Truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering (''magga'').{{sfn|Dhamma|1997|p=55}}
* Bhikkhu Bodhi: "The Four Noble Truths are as follows: 1. The truth of Dukkha; 2. The truth of the origin of Dukkha; 3. The truth of the cessation of Dukkha; 4. The truth of the path, the way to liberation from Dukkha".<ref group=web name=bodhi1/>
* Geshe Tashi Tsering: "The four noble truths are: 1. The noble truth of suffering; 2. The noble truth of the origin of suffering; 3. The noble truth of the cessation of suffering and the origin of suffering; 4. The noble truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering and the origin of suffering."{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=loc. 246–250}}
* Joseph Goldstein: "The four noble truths are the truth of suffering, its cause, its end, and the path to that end.{{sfn|Goldstein|2002|p=24}}}} contains grammatical errors, pointing to multiple sources for this set and translation problems within the ancient Buddhist community. Nevertheless, they were considered correct by the Pali tradition, which did not correct them.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}}

According to the Buddhist tradition, the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', "Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion",<ref group=web name="Dhammacakka">[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion – Majjhima Nikaya 56.11'']</ref> contains the first teachings that the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] gave after attaining [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|full awakening]], and liberation from rebirth. According to [[L. S. Cousins]], many scholars are of the view that "this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date,"{{sfn|Cousins|2001|p=38}} and according to professor of religion Carol S. Anderson{{refn|group=note |Professor of religion, Kalamazoo College; Co-Editor of the Journal of Buddhist–Christian Studies.<ref group=web>[https://www.society-buddhist-christian-studies.org/partners/ ''Governing Board of the Society for Buddhist–Christian studies'']</ref><ref group=web>[https://www.society-buddhist-christian-studies.org/carol-anderson ''Carol Anderson'']</ref>}} the four truths may originally not have been part of this sutta, but were later added in some versions.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=68}} Within this discourse, the four noble truths are given as follows ("bhikkus" is normally translated as "Buddhist monks"):
{{quote| Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the [[Skandha|five aggregates]] subject to clinging are suffering.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving [''[[taṇhā]]'', "thirst"] which [[Twelve Nidānas|leads to re-becoming]], accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for becoming, craving for disbecoming.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it is this noble eightfold path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.<ref group=web name="BB">[http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebsut001.htm Bikkhu Bodhi (translator), ''Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta. Samyutta Nikaya LVI, 11. "Setting in Motion the Wheel of the Dhamma".'']</ref>}}

According to this sutra, with the complete comprehension of these four truths release from ''samsara'', the cycle of rebirth, was attained:
{{quote|Knowledge & vision arose in me: 'Unprovoked is my release. This is the last birth. There is now no further becoming.<ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"/>}}

The comprehension of these four truths by his audience leads to the opening of the ''Dhamma Eye'', that is, the attainment of right vision:
{{quote|Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation.<ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"/>}}

===Basic set===
According to K.R. Norman, the basic set is as follows:{{sfn|Norman|2003|pp=219, 222}}
* ''idam dukkham'', "this is pain"
* ''ayam dukkha-samudayo'', "this is the origin of pain"
* ''ayam dukkha-nirodha'', "this is the cessation of pain"
* ''ayam dukkha-nirodha-gamini patipada'', "this is the path leading to the cessation of pain."  The key terms in the longer version of this expression, ''dukkha-nirodha-gamini Patipada'', can be translated as follows:
:* ''Gamini'': leading to, making for<ref group=web>[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=pali&query=g%C4%81min%C4%AB&matchtype=exact&display=utf8 Pali Text Society Dictionary]</ref>
:* ''Patipada'': road, path, way; the means of reaching a goal or destination<ref group=web>[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#pq Access to Insight Glossary – pq]</ref>

===Mnemonic set===
According to [[K. R. Norman]], the Pali canon contains various shortened forms of the four truths, the "mnemonic set", which were "intended to remind the hearer of the full form of the NTs."{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=213}} The earliest form of the mnemonic set was "dukkham samudayo nirodho magga", without the reference to the [[Pali]] terms ''sacca''{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=219}} or ''arya'',{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}} which were later added to the formula.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}} The four mnemonic terms can be translated as follows:
# ''[[Dukkha]]'' – "incapable of satisfying",<ref group=web name="Sumedho-first">[http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble4.htm Ajahn Sumedho, ''The First Noble Truth'']</ref> "the unsatisfactory nature and the general insecurity of all [[Saṅkhāra#Conditioned things|conditioned phenomena]]"; "painful".{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}}{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}} ''Dukkha'' is most commonly translated as "suffering". According to Khantipalo, this is an incorrect translation, since it refers to the ultimately unsatisfactory nature of temporary states and things, including pleasant but temporary experiences.{{sfn|Khantipalo|2003|p=46}} According to Emmanuel, ''Dukkha'' is the opposite of ''sukha'', "pleasure", and it is better translated as "pain".{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}}
# ''[[Samudaya]]'' – "origin", "source", "arising", "coming to existence";<ref group=web name=DigitalLibrary>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120611220213/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/DBLM/olcourse/sanskrit/heart/heart16.htm Digital Library & Museum of Buddhist Studies, College of liberal Arts, Taiwan University: Samudaya]</ref> "aggregate of the constituent elements or factors of any being or existence", "cluster", "coming together", "combination", "producing cause", "combination", "rising".<ref group=web>[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&beginning=0+&tinput=+samudaya&trans=Translate&direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for spoken Sanskrit, ''samudaya'']</ref>
# ''Nirodha'' – cessation; release; to confine;{{sfn|Brazier|2001}} "prevention, suppression, enclosing, restraint"<ref group=web>[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&tinput=+nirodha&trans=Translate spokensanskrit.de, ''nirodha'']</ref>
# ''[[Noble Eightfold Path|Marga]]'' – "path".<ref group=web>[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#m Access to Insight Glossary – m]</ref>

===Alternative formulations===
According to L.S. Cousins, the four truths are not restricted to the well-known form where ''dukkha'' is the subject. Other forms take "the world, the arising of the world" or "the [[Asava|āsavas]], the arising of the āsavas" as their subject. According to Cousins, "the well-known form is simply shorthand for all of the forms."{{sfn|Cousins|2001|p=36}} "The world" refers to the [[saṅkhāra]]s, that is, all compounded things,<ref group=web>[http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/7.2-Rohitassa-S-s2.26-piya.pdf The Dharmafarers, ''Rhitassa Sutra'' (Samyutta Nikaya 2.26)]</ref> or to the [[Ayatana|six sense spheres]].{{sfn|Choong|2000|p=84}}

The various terms all point to the same basic idea of Buddhism, as described in [[Skandha|five skandhas]] and [[Twelve Nidānas|twelve nidānas]]. In the five skandhas, sense-contact with objects leads to sensation and perception; the [[saṅkhāra]] ('inclinations', c.q. craving etc.) determine the interpretation of, and the response to, these sensations and perceptions, and affect consciousness in specific ways. The ''twelve nidānas'' describe the further process: craving and clinging (''[[upādāna]]'') lead to ''[[bhava]]'' (becoming) and ''[[jāti]]'' (birth). 

In the orthodox interpretation, ''bhava'' is interpreted as ''kammabhava'', that is , ''[[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]'', while ''jāti'' is interpreted as rebirth: from sensation comes craving, from craving comes karma, from karma comes rebirth. The aim of the Buddhist path is to reverse this causal chain: when there is no (response to) sensation, there is no craving, no karma, no rebirth.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=840}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=55–59}} In Thai Buddhism, ''bhava'' is interpreted as behavior which serves craving and clinging, while ''jāti'' is interpreted as the repeated birth of the ego or self-sense, which perpetuates the process of self-serving responses and actions.<ref name="Payutto"/><ref group=web name="Buddhadasa"/>

===Truths for the noble ones===
The Pali terms ''ariya sacca'' (Sanskrit: ''arya satya'') are commonly translated as "noble truths". This translation is a convention started by the earliest translators of Buddhist texts into English. According to K.R. Norman, this is just one of several possible translations.{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2002|p=41}} According to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]],{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2002|p=41}}
{{quote|[T]here is no particular reason why the Pali expression ariyasaccani should be translated as 'noble truths'. It could equally be translated as 'the nobles' truths', or 'the truths for nobles', or 'the nobilising truths', or 'the truths of, possessed by, the noble ones' [...] In fact the Pali expression (and its Sanskrit equivalent) can mean all of these, although the Pali commentators place 'the noble truths' as the least important in their understanding.{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2002|p=41}}}}

The term "arya" was later added to the four truths.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p={{pn|date=November 2020}}}}{{sfn|Analayo|2013|p=15}} The term ''[[Arya (Buddhism)|ariya]]'' (Sanskrit: ''arya'') can be translated as "noble", "not ordinary", "valuable", "precious".{{refn|group=note|Ajahn Sucitto states: "So the four truths (ariya sacca) are generally called “noble” truths, although one might also translate ariya as "precious", "{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|loc=loc. 122}} }} "pure".{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Paul Williams:
{{quote|The Aryas are the noble ones, the saints, those who have attained 'the fruits of the path', 'that middle path the Tathagata has comprehended which promotes sight and knowledge, and which tends to peace, higher wisdom, enlightenment, and Nibbana'.{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2002|p=52}}}}

The term ''[[satya|sacca]]'' (Sanskrit: ''[[satya]]'') is a central term in Indian thought and religion. It is typically translated as "truth"; but it also means "that which is in accord with reality", or "reality". According to [[Rupert Gethin]], the four truths are "four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}} They function as "a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gethin_framework"|Gethin: "The word satya (Pali sacca) can certainly mean truth, but it might equally be rendered as 'real' or 'actual thing'. That is, we are not dealing here with propositional truths with which we must either agree or disagree, but with four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening. [...] This is not to say that the Buddha's discourses do not contain theoretical statements of the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation, but these descriptions function not so much as dogmas of the Buddhist faith as a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}}} According to K. R. Norman, probably the best translation is "the truth[s] of the noble one (the Buddha)".{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2002|p=41}} It is a statement of how things are seen by a Buddha, how things really are when seen correctly. It is the truthful way of seeing.{{refn|group=note|'"Truth", ''satya'' (Sanskrit), ''sacca'' (Pali), derived from ''sat'', being, how it is.{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2002|p=41}}}} Through not seeing things this way, and behaving accordingly, we suffer.{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2002|p=41}}{{refn|group=note|Contemporary Buddhist teacher [[Mingyur Rinpoche]] describes the four ''arya satya'' as "Four Pure Insights into the Way Things Are".{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Contemporary scholar Peter Harvey translates ''arya satya'' as "True Realities for the Spiritually Ennobled".{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=52}}}}

===Symbolic and propositional function===
[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.65|The [[Dharmacakra]], often used to represent the Noble Eightfold Path]]

According to Anderson, the four truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function:
{{quote|... the four noble truths are truly set apart within the body of the Buddha's teachings, not because they are by definition sacred, but because they are both a symbol and a doctrine and transformative within the sphere of right view. As one doctrine among others, the four noble truths make explicit the structure within which one should seek enlightenment; as a symbol, the four noble truths evoke the possibility of enlightenment. As both, they occupy not only a central but a singular position within the Theravada canon and tradition.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=230–231}}}}

The well-known eightfold path consists of the understanding that this world is fleeting and unsatisfying, and how craving keeps us tied to this fleeting world; a friendly and compassionate attitude to others; a correct way of behaving; mind-control, which means not feeding on negative thoughts, and nurturing positive thoughts; constant awareness of the feelings and responses which arise; and the practice of ''dhyana'', meditation.{{sfn|Bucknell|1984}} The tenfold path adds the right (liberating) insight, and liberation from rebirth.{{sfn|Bucknell|1984}}{{refn|group=note|Another variant, which may be condensed to the eightfold or tenfold path, starts with a Tathagatha entering this world.

{{quote|Once birth has arisen, "ageing and death", and various other dukkha states follow. While saying that birth is the cause of death may sound rather simplistic, in Buddhism it is a very significant statement; for there is an alternative to being born. This is to attain Nirvāna, so bringing an end to the process of rebirth and redeath. Nirvāna is not subject to time and change, and so is known as the [[Anutpada|‘unborn’]]; as it is not born it cannot die, and so it is also known as the "deathless". To attain this state, all phenomena subject to birth – the [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|khandhas]] and [[Nidana|nidānas]] – must be transcended by means of [[Nekkhamma|non-attachment]].{{sfn|Harvey|2013|pp=71–72}}}}

The last sermon, the ''[[Maha-parinibbana Sutta]]'' (Last Days of the Buddha, Digha Nikaya 16)", states it as follows:
{{quote|[...] it is through not realizing, through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you [...] But now, bhikkhus, that these have been realized and penetrated, cut off is the craving for existence, destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming [rebirth], and there is no fresh becoming.<ref group=web name="ati_Maha-parinibbana_Sutta"/>}}

===Other interpretations===
According to Bhikkhu [[Buddhadasa]], "birth" does refer not to physical birth and death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the "emergence of the ego". According to Buddhadhasa,
{{quote|...dependent arising is a phenomenon that lasts an instant; it is impermanent. Therefore, Birth and Death must be explained as phenomena within the process of dependent arising in everyday life of ordinary people. Right Mindfulness is lost during contacts of the Roots and surroundings. Thereafter, when vexation due to greed, anger, and ignorance is experienced, the ego has already been born. It is considered as one 'birth'".<ref group=web name="Buddhadasa"/>}}

Some contemporary teachers tend to explain the four truths psychologically, by taking ''dukkha'' to mean mental anguish in addition to the physical pain of life,{{sfn|Batchelor|2012|p=94}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2016|p=10}} and interpreting the four truths as a means to attain happiness in this life.{{sfn|Kingsland|2016|p=280}} In the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]] that emerged out of the Theravada Buddhism, freedom and the "pursuit of happiness" have become the main goals, not the end of rebirth, which is hardly mentioned in their teachings.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|pp=164–166}}{{refn|group=note|The Vipassana-movement originated in colonial Burma, in response to the British colonial regime. While traditional Theravada saw little room for meditation practice, a subordinate role for lay Buddhists, and the attainment of ''nirvana'' as impossible in our times, reformists advocated the practice of meditation by lay Buddhists, as a means to preserve the pre-colonial order, which was based on Buddhism. ''Nirvana'' was suddenly deemed attainable, also for lay Buddhists. The Burmese reformists had a profound influence in the Theravada world, and also in the US since the 1970s, shaping the popular understanding of Buddhism.<ref group=web name="Braun2014">Eric Braun (2014), [http://www.spiritrock.org/document.doc?id=5335 ''How colonialism sparked the global Vipassana movement'']</ref>}}

Yet, though freedom and happiness is a part of the Buddhist teachings, these words refer to something different in traditional Asian Buddhism. According to [[Gil Fronsdal]], "when Asian teachers do talk about freedom, it is primarily in reference to what one is free from – that is, from greed, hate, delusion, grasping, attachment, wrong view, self, and most significantly, rebirth".{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=172}} ''Nibbana'' is the final freedom, and it has no purpose beyond itself. In contrast, freedom in the creative modern interpretation of Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path means living happily and wisely, "without drastic changes in lifestyle".{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=172}} Such freedom and happiness is not the goal of Four Noble Truths and related doctrines within traditional Buddhism, but the vipassana teachings in the West make no reference to traditional Theravada doctrines, instead they present only the pragmatic and experiential goals in the form of therapy for the audience's current lives.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|pp=172–174}} The creative interpretations are driven in part because the foundational premises of Buddhism do not make sense to audiences outside of Asia.{{refn|group=note|Stephen Batchelor states, "Such craving is at the root of greed, hatred, and bewilderment that prompt one to commit acts that cause one to be reborn after death in more or less favourable conditions in samsara. Although I have presented this formulation of the existential dilemma and its resolution in Buddhist terms, the same soteriological framework is shared by Hindus and Jains. (...) So embedded is this Indian soteriological framework in Buddhism that Buddhists might find it unintelligible that one would even consider questioning it. For to dispense with such key doctrines as rebirth, the law of kamma, and liberation from the cycle of birth and death would surely undermine the entire edifice of Buddhism itself. Yet for those who have grown up outside of Indian culture, who feel at home in a modernity informed by the natural sciences, to then be told that one cannot “really” practise the dharma unless one adheres to the tenets of ancient Indian soteriology makes little sense. The reason people can no longer accept these beliefs need not be because they reject them as false, but because such views are too much at variance with everything else they know and believe about the nature of themselves and the world. They simply do not work anymore, and the intellectual gymnastics one needs to perform to make them work seem casuistic and, for many, unpersuasive. They are metaphysical beliefs, in that (like belief in God) they can neither be convincingly demonstrated nor refuted."{{sfn|Batchelor|2012|p=89–90}}}}{{refn|group=note|name="Wallace"|B. Alan Wallace states, "The Theravada Buddhist worldview is originally based on the Pali Buddhist canon, as interpreted by the great fifth-century commentator Buddhaghosa and later Buddhist scholars and contemplatives. For the immigrant Theravada Buddhist laity, the central feature of this worldview is the affirmation of the reality of reincarnation and karma. The possibility of achieving nirvana is primarily a concern for Buddhist monastics, while the laity are more concerned with avoiding karma that would propel them to a miserable rebirth, and with accumulating meritorious karma that will lead to a favorable rebirth and, in the long run, to ultimate liberation. (...) As a direct result of their belief in the efficacy of karma, Theravada lay Buddhists commonly make offerings of food, goods, and money to the ordained Sangha. Such meritorious conduct is thought to lead to a better rebirth either for themselves or for their deceased loved ones, depending on how the merit is dedicated by the person who performs this service."{{sfn|Wallace|2002|p=36–37}}}} According to Spiro, "the Buddhist message is not simply a psychological message", but an eschatological message.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=42}}

According to academic scholars, inconsistencies in the oldest texts may reveal developments in the oldest teachings.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=ix}}{{refn|group=note|name="development of teachings"}} While the Theravada-tradition holds that the Sutta Pitaka is "the definitive recension of the Buddha-word",{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|1995a|p=13}} and Theravadins argue that it is likely that the sutras date back to the Buddha himself, in an unbroken chain of oral transmission,<ref group=web>{{cite web |last1=Payutto |first1=P.A. |title=The Pali Canon What a Buddhist Must Know |url=http://www.watnyanaves.net/uploads/File/books/pdf/the_pali_canon_what_a_buddhist_must_know.pdf}}</ref><ref group=web name="BS_BB">{{citation |last1=Sujato |first1=Bhante |author-link1=Bhante Sujato |last2=Brahmali |first2=Bhikkhu |title=The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts |url=https://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/authenticity.pdf |year=2015 |publisher=Chroniker Press |ISBN=978-1312911505}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|[[Bhante Sujato|Bhikkhu Sujato]] & Bhikkhu Brahmali, p. 4: "Most academic scholars of Early Buddhism cautiously affirm that it is possible that the EBTS contain some authentic sayings of the Buddha.

Information of the oldest teachings of Buddhism, such as on the Four Noble Truths, has been obtained by analysis of the oldest texts and these inconsistencies, and are a matter of ongoing discussion and research.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p={{pn|date=November 2020}}}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}} According to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished regarding the possibility to retain knowledge of the oldest Buddhism:{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=vii}}
# "Stress on the fundamental homogeneity and substantial authenticity of at least a considerable part of the Nikayic materials;"{{refn|group=note|Well-known proponents of the first position are:<br>* [[A.K. Warder]]. According to A.K. Warder, in his 1970 publication "Indian Buddhism", from the oldest extant texts a common kernel can be drawn out,{{sfn|Warder|1999|loc=inside flap}} namely the [[Bodhipakkhiyādhammā]]. According to Warder, c.q. his publisher: "This kernel of doctrine is presumably common Buddhism of the period before the great schisms of the fourth and third centuries BC. It may be substantially the Buddhism of the Buddha himself, although this cannot be proved: at any rate it is a Buddhism presupposed by the schools as existing about a hundred years after the parinirvana of the Buddha, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was formulated by anyone else than the Buddha and his immediate followers."{{sfn|Warder|1999|loc=inside flap}}<br>* [[Richard Gombrich]]: "I have the greatest difficulty in accepting that the main edifice is not the work of a single genius. By "the main edifice" I mean the collections of the main body of sermons, the four Nikāyas, and of the main body of monastic rules."{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}}}
# "Scepticism with regard to the possibility of retrieving the doctrine of earliest Buddhism;"{{refn|group=note|A proponent of the second position is Ronald Davidson: "While most scholars agree that there was a rough body of sacred literature (disputed)(sic) that a relatively early community (disputed)(sic) maintained and transmitted, we have little confidence that much, if any, of surviving Buddhist scripture is actually the word of the historic Buddha."{{sfn|Davidson|2003|p=147}}}}
# "Cautious optimism in this respect."{{refn|group=note|Well-known proponent of the third position are:<br>* J.W. de Jong: "It would be hypocritical to assert that nothing can be said about the doctrine of earliest Buddhism [...] the basic ideas of Buddhism found in the canonical writings could very well have been proclaimed by him [the Buddha], transmitted and developed by his disciples and, finally, codified in fixed formulas."{{sfn|Jong|1993|p=25}}<br>* Johannes Bronkhorst: "This position is to be preferred to (ii) for purely methodological reasons: only those who seek may find, even if no success is guaranteed."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1997|p=vii}}<br>* Donald Lopez: "The original teachings of the historical Buddha are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to recover or reconstruct."{{sfn|Lopez|1995|p=4}}}}

===Development===

====Growing importance====
According to Bronkhorst, the four truths may already have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, but did not have the central place they acquired in later buddhism.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} According to Anderson, only by the time of the commentaries, in the fifth century CE, did the four truths come to be identified in the Theravada tradition as the central teaching of the Buddha.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=55–56}}{{refn|group=note|Anderson: "However, the four noble truths do not always appear in stories of the Buddha's enlightenment where we might expect to find them. This feature may indicate that the four noble truths emerged into the canonical tradition at a particular point and slowly became recognized as the first teaching of the Buddha. Speculations about early and late teachings must be made relative to other passages in the Pali canon because of a lack of supporting extratextual evidence. Nonetheless, it is still possible to suggest a certain historical development of the four noble truths within the Pali canon. What we will find is a doctrine that came to be identified as the central teaching of the Buddha by the time of the commentaries in the fifth century C.E."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=55–56}}}} According to Anderson,

{{quote|... the four noble truths were probably not part of the earliest strata of what came to be recognized as Buddhism, but that they emerged as a central teaching in a slightly later period that still preceded the final redactions of the various Buddhist canons.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=21}}}}

According to Feer and Anderson, the four truths probably entered the Sutta Pitaka from the Vinaya, the rules for monastic order.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=74, 77}}{{refn|group=note|Anderson refers to Léon Feer, who already in 1870 "suggested the possibility that the four noble truths emerged into Buddhist literature through ''vinaya'' collections."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=183}} She also refers to Bareau, who noticed the consistency between the two versions in the ''Mahavagga'', part of the ''Vinaya'', and the ''Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta'' of the Buddha's enlightenment: "As Bareau noted, the consistency between these two versions of the Buddha's enlightenment is an indication that the redactors of the Theravada canon probably brought the two accounts into agreement with each other at a relatively late point in the formation of the canon.<br />Leon Feer had already suggested in 1870 that the versions of the four noble truths found in the sutras and suttas were derived from the vinaya rescensions in the larger body of Buddhist literature; Bareau's conclusion builds on this claim."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=74}}}} They were first added to enlightenment-stories which contain the Four Jhanas, replacing terms for "liberating insight".{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=148}}{{refn|group=note|According to Schmithausen, in his often-cited article ''On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of 'Liberating Insight' and 'Enlightenment' in Early Buddhism'', the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p={{pn|date=November 2020}}}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}}} From there they were added to the biographical stories of the Buddha.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=17}}{{refn|group=note|Anderson refers to research by K.R.

====Substituting "liberating insight"====
Scholars have noted inconsistencies in the presentations of the Buddha's enlightenment, and the Buddhist path to liberation, in the oldest sutras. They offer that these inconsistencies show that the Buddhist teachings evolved, either during the lifetime of the Buddha, or thereafter.<!--**START OF NOTE**-->{{refn|group=note|name="development of teachings"|See:

Instead, they are a rather late theory on the content of the Buddha's enlightenment.{{sfn|Hirakawa|1990|p=28}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, the earliest Buddhist path consisted of a set of practices which culminate in the practice of ''dhyana'',{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxi–xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=93–111}} leading to a calm of mind and [[Sati (Buddhism)|awareness]] (mindfulness){{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxv}} which according to Vetter ''is'' the liberation which is being sought.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxi–xxxvii}}{{refn|group=note|Note that ''dhyana'' is not the same as ''samatha'', the calming of the mind by one-pointedly concentration. While ''dhyana'' also leads to a calm of mind, it aids in developing mindfulness, which is necessary to be aware of the arising of disturbing, selfish, thoughts and emotions, and to counter them. Wynne: "...the Buddha taught a ‘middle way’ between pure meditation and cognitive practices. The states of absorption induced by meditation were considered useful and necessary, but in distinction from the meditative mainstream their ultimate aim was insight. For the Buddha it was vitally important that the meditative adept should apply his concentrative state to the practice of mindfulness (Sn 1070: ''satima''; Sn 1111: ''ajjhattañ ca bahiddha ca nabhinandato''; Sn 1113: ''ajjhattañ ca bahiddha ca natthi ti passato''), and work towards the attainment of insight. According to this view meditation alone, the goal of the meditative mainstream would have been harshly criticized in the earliest Buddhism."{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=105}}}} Later on, "liberating insight" came to be regarded as equally liberating.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|pp=99–102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=93–111}} This "liberating insight" came to be exemplified by ''prajna'', or the insight in the "four truths",{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|pp=99–102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=93–111}} but also by other elements of the Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxi–xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|loc=chapter 7}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, this growing importance of "liberating insight" was a response to other religious groups in India, which held that a liberating insight was indispensable for ''[[moksha]]'', liberation from rebirth.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxxii, xxxiii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=54–55, 96, 99}}{{refn|group=note|Tillmann Vetter: "Very likely the cause was the growing influence of a non-Buddhist spiritual environment·which claimed that one can be released only by some truth or higher knowledge. In addition the alternative (and perhaps sometimes competing) method of discriminating insight (fully established after the introduction of the four noble truths) seemed to conform so well to this claim."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiii}}<br><br>According to Bronkhorst, this happened under influence of the "mainstream of meditation", that is, Vedic-Brahmanical oriented groups, which believed that the cessation of action could not be liberating, since action can never be fully stopped. Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions. By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating. What exactly was regarded as the central insight "varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=54–55, 96, 99}}}} This change is reflected in the canon, where, according to Bronkhorst,

{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}

According to Vetter and Bonkhorst, the ideas on what exactly constituted this "liberating insight" was not fixed but developed over time.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|pp=xxi–xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chpter 7}} According to Bronkhorst, in [[Presectarian Buddhism|earliest Buddhism]] the four truths did not serve as a description of "liberating insight".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Initially the term ''prajna'' served to denote this "liberating insight". Later on, ''prajna'' was replaced in the suttas by the "four truths".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=99–100, 102–111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p={{pn|date=November 2020}}}} This happened in those texts where practicing the four jhanas preceded the attainment of "liberating insight", and where this practice of the four jhanas then culminates in "liberating insight".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}} This "liberating insight" came to be defined as "insight into the four truths", which is presented as the "liberating insight" which constituted the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], or "enlightenment" of the Buddha. When he understood these truths he was "enlightened" and liberated,{{refn|group=note|"Enlightenment" is a typical western term, which bears its own, specific western connotations, meanings and interpretations.{{sfn|Cohen|2006}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}}} as reflected in Majjhima Nikaya 26:42: "his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=268}}

Bronkhorst points to an inconsistency, noting that the four truths refer here to the eightfold path as the means to gain liberation, while the attainment of insight into the four truths is portrayed as liberating in itself.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p={{pn|date=November 2020}}}} According to Bronkhorst, this is an inconsistency which reveals a change which took place over time in the composition of the sutras.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p={{pn|date=November 2020}}}} An example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42–43, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=102–103}}

According to Schmithausen, the four truths were superseded by ''[[pratityasamutpada]]'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the [[Anatta|non-existence of a substantial self or person]].{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=100–101}} Schmithausen further states that still other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon:
{{quote|"that the five Skandhas are impermanent, disagreeable, and neither the Self nor belonging to oneself";{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26}} "the contemplation of the arising and disappearance (''udayabbaya'') of the five Skandhas";{{refn|group=note|Anguttara Nikaya II.45 (PTS)}} "the realisation of the Skandhas as empty (''rittaka''), vain (''tucchaka'') and without any pith or substance (''asaraka'').{{refn|group=note|Samyutta Nikaya III.140–142 (PTS)}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}}}

In contrast, Thanissaro Bikkhu presents the view that the four truths, [[pratityasamutpada]] and anatta are inextricably intertwined.<ref group=web>{{cite web |website=accestoinsight.org |title=Wings to Awakening Part 3 |url=https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part3.html#part3-h-1}}</ref>

===Acquiring the ''dhamma-eye'' and destroying the ''āsavās''===
In their symbolic function, the sutras present the insight into the four truths as the culmination of the Buddha's path to awakening. In the ''Vinayapitaka'' and the ''Sutta-pitaka'' they have the same symbolic function, in a reenactment by his listeners of the Buddha's awakening by attaining the ''dhamma-eye''. In contrast, here this insight serves as the starting point to path-entry for his audience.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp=126, 132, 143}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2000|pp=79, 80}} These sutras present a repeated sequence of events:{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp=132–134}}
# ''Annupubbikathā'' ("graduated talk"), in which the Buddha explains the four truths; this talk frees the listener from the hindrances;
# This talk opens the ''dhammacakkhu'' ("dhamma eye"), and knowledge arises: "all that has the nature of arising has the nature of ending";{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=132}}{{refn|group=note|In effect to the exposition of the four truths, as presented in the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', the "dustless, stainless Dhamma eye" arose to Kondañña, stating: "Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."<ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"/>}}
# The request to become a member of the Buddhist order;
# A second talk by the Buddha, which destroys the ''āsavās'', impurities;
# The statement that "there are now ''x arahats'' in the world."

Yet, in other sutras, where the four truths have a propositional function, the comprehension of the four truths destroys the corruptions.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=146}} They do so in combination with the practice of the ''jhanas'' and the attainment of the divine eye, with which past lives and the working of rebirth are being seen.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp=146–147}}

According to Anderson, following Schmithausen and Bronkhorst, these two presentations give two different models of the path to liberation, reflecting their function as a symbol and as a proposition.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=149}} Most likely, the four truths were first associated with the culmination of the path in the destruction of the ''āsavās'', where they substituted the unspecified "liberating insight"; as the canon developed, they became more logically associated with the beginning of the Buddhist path.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=149}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2000|pp=79, 80}}

===Popularisation in the west===
According to Anderson there is a strong tendency within scholarship to present the four truths as the most essential teaching of Buddhism.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196}} According to Anderson, the four truths have been simplified and popularized in western writings, due to "the colonial project of gaining control over Buddhism."{{sfn|Crosby|2013}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=197}} According to Crosby, the Buddhist teachings are reduced to a "simple, single rationalized account", which has parallels in the reinterpretation of the Buddha in western literature.{{sfn|Crosby|2013}}

The presentation of the four truths as one of the most important teachings of the Buddha "has been [done] to reduce the four noble truths to a teaching that is accessible, pliable, and therefore readily appropriated by non-Buddhists."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=197}} There is a great variety of teachings in the Buddhist literature, which may be bewildering for those who are unaware of this variety.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196}} The four truths are easily accessible in this regard, and are "readily [understood] by those outside the Buddhist traditions."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp=196–197}} For example Walpola Rahula's ''What the Buddha Taught'', a widely used introductory text for non-Buddhists, uses the four truths as a framework to present an overview of the Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=197}}

According to Harris, the British in the 19th century crafted new representations of Buddhism and the Buddha.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=169}} 19th century missionaries studied Buddhism, to be more effective in their missionary efforts.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=120}} The Buddha was de-mystified, and reduced from a "superhuman" to a "compassionate, heroic human", serving "western historical method and the missionary agenda of situating the Buddha firmly below the divine."{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=169}} The four truths were discovered by the British by reading the Buddhist texts, and were not immediately granted the central position they later received.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=169}}

The writings of British missionaries show a growing emphasis on the four truths as being central to Buddhism, with somewhat different presentations of them.{{sfn|Harris|2006|pp=72–73}}{{refn|group=note| Whereas Gogerly wrote in 1861 "That sorrow is connected with existence in all its forms [and] [t]hat its continuance results from a continued desire of existence", Spencer Hardy wrote in 1866 that "there is sorrow connected with every mode of existence; that the cause of sorrow is desire."{{sfn|Harris|2006|pp=72–73}} Childers, drawing on Gogerly and Hardy, writes that "existence is suffering; human passion (''tanhã'' – desire) is the cause of continued existence."{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=120}}}} This colonial project had a strong influence on some strands of Buddhism, culminating in so-called [[Protestant Buddhism]], which incorporated several essentially Protestant attitudes regarding religion, such as the emphasis on written texts.{{sfn|Gombrich|Obeyesekere|1988}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} According to Gimello, Rahula's book is an example of this Protestant Budhism, and "was created in an accommodating response to western expectations, and in nearly diametrical opposition to Buddhism as it had actually been practised in traditional Theravada."{{refn|group=note|Gimello (2004), as quoted in Taylor (2007).{{sfn|Taylor|2007|p=361}}}}

[[Hendrik Kern]] proposed in 1882 that the model of the four truths may be an analogy with classical Indian medicine, in which the four truths function as a medical diagnosis, and the Buddha is presented as a physician.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}{{refn|group=note|Kern's model:{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=loc. 909–911}}{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=52}}{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2002|p=42}}

# ''The truth of dukkha:'' identifying the illness and the nature of the illness (the [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]])
# ''The truth of origin:''  identifying the [[Cause (medicine)|causes of the illness]]
# ''The truth of cessation:'' identifying a cure for the illness (the [[prognosis]])
# ''The truth of the path:'' recommending a treatment for the illness that can bring about a cure (the [[Medical prescription|prescription]])}} Kern's analogy became rather popular,{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}{{refn|group=note|See,{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=loc. 909–911}}{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=52}}{{sfn|Williams|Tribe|Wynne|2002|p=42}}}} but "there is not sufficient historical evidence to conclude that the Buddha deliberately drew upon a clearly defined medical model for his fourfold analysis of human pain."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}

According to Anderson, those scholars who did not place the four truths at the center of Buddhism, either "located the four truths in a fuller reading of the Theravada canon and the larger context of South Asian literature", or "located the teaching within an experience of Buddhism as practiced in a contemporary setting."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=198}} According to Anderson, "these autors suggest a more complex reading of the four noble truths than those who locate the teaching as the key to or as a crucial element within the grand scheme of Buddhism."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=198}}

==Appearance within the discourses==
The developing Buddhist tradition inserted the four truths, using various formulations, at various sutras.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p={{pn|date=November 2020}}}} They are being used both as a symbol of all dhammas and the Buddha's awakening, and as a set of propositions which function within a matrix of teachings.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=86}} According to Anderson, there is no single way to understand the teachings; one teaching may be used to explain another teaching, and vice versa. The teachings form a network, which should be apprehended as such to understand how the various teachings intersect with each other.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=86–87}}

===Symbolic function===

====''Mahasaccaka Sutta''====
The ''Mahasaccaka Sutta'' ("The Greater Discourse to Saccaka", Majjhima Nikaya 36) gives one of several versions of the Buddha's way to liberation.{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26, "The Noble Search", also gives an account, which is markedly different, omitting the ascetic practices and the four truths.}} He attains the three knowledges, namely knowledge of his former lifes, knowledge of death and rebirth, and knowledge of the destruction of the taints,{{refn|group=note|Which keep one trapped in ''samsara''.}} the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p={{pn|date=October 2020}}}} After going through the four dhyanas, and gaining the first two knowledges, the story proceeds:
{{quote|I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants [suffering ... origin ... cessation ... path] [intoxicants (''asava'') ... origin ... cessation ... path] My mind was liberated [...] the knowledge arose that it was liberated.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=102–103}}}}

Bronkhorst dismisses the first two knowledges as later additions, and proceeds to notice that the recognition of the intoxicants is modelled on the four truths. According to Bronkhorst, those are added the bridge the original sequence of "I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants. My mind was liberated", which was interrupted by the addition of the four truths. Bronkhorst points out that those do not fit here, since the four truths culminate in the knowledge of the path to be followed, while the Buddha himself is already liberated at that point.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=103–104}}

====''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta''====
[[File:Gandharan - Expounding the Law - Walters 2551.jpg|right|thumb|A relief depicting the first discourse of the Buddha, from the 2nd century (Kushan).<ref group=web>[http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21971 Expounding the Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000844/http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21971 |date=4 March 2016 }}, [[The Walters Art Museum]]</ref> The Walters Art Museum. The Buddha's hand can be seen at right.]]

According to the Buddhist tradition, the first talk of [[Gautama Buddha]] after he attained [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] is recorded in the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' ("Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dhamma", Samyutta Nikaya 56.11). The ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' provides details on three stages in the understanding of each truth, for a total of twelve insights. The three stages for understanding each truth are:{{sfn|Rahula|2007a|loc=loc. 3935–3939}}{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|pp=99–100}}{{sfn|Ajahn Sumedho|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Moffitt|2002|loc=loc. 225–226}}{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=loc. 303–306}}
# ''sacca-ñāṇa'' – knowing the nature of the truth (e.g., acknowledgement, view, reflection)
# ''kicca-ñāṇa'' – knowing what needs to be done in connection with that truth (e.g., practice; motivation; directly experiencing)
# ''kata-ñāṇa'' – accomplishing what needs to be done (e.g., result, full understanding, knowing)

These three stages of understanding are emphasized particularly in the Theravada tradition, but they are also recognized by some contemporary Mahayana teachers.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=loc. 303–306}}{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hanh|1999|pp=28–46}}

According to Cousins, many scholars are of the view that "this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date."{{sfn|Cousins|2001|p=38}} According to Stephen Batchelor, the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' contains incongruities, and states that
{{quote|The First Discourse cannot be treated as a verbatim transcript of what the Buddha taught in the Deer Park, but as a document that has evolved over an unspecified period of time until it reached the form in which it is found today in the canons of the different Buddhist schools.{{sfn|Batchelor|2012|p=91}}}}

According to Bronkhorst this "first sermon" is recorded in several sutras, with important variations.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}} In the Vinaya texts, and in the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' which was influenced by the Vinaya texts, the four truths are included, and Kondañña is enlightened{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=69}} when the "vision of Dhamma"{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=1846}} arises in him: "whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."{{refn|group=note|Translation Bhikkhu Bodhi (2000), ''Samyutta Nikaya'', SN 56.11, p. 1846. See also Anderson (2001), ''Pain and its Ending'', p. 69.}} Yet, in the ''Ariyapariyesanā Sutta'' ("The Noble Search", Majjhima Nikaya 26) the four truths are not included,{{refn|group=note|MN 26.17 merely says "[']This will serve for the striving of a clansman intent on striving.' And I sat down there thinking: 'This will serve for striving.'{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=259}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi Majjhima Nikaya 36 then continuous with the extreme ascetic practices, which are omitted in MN 26.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=1216, note 403}} In verse 18, the Buddha has attained Nirvana, being secured from bondage by birth, ageing, sickness and death, referring to the truths of dependent origination and "the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all attachments, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|pp=259–260}}}} and the Buddha gives the five ascetics personal instructions in turn, two or three of them, while the others go out begging for food. The versions of the "first sermon" which include the four truths, such as the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', omit this instruction, showing that
{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the subsequent destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}

According to Bronkhorst, this indicates that the four truths were later added to earlier descriptions of liberation by practicing the four dhyanas, which originally was thought to be sufficient for the destruction of the arsavas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}} Anderson, following Norman, also thinks that the four truths originally were not part of this sutta, and were later added in some versions.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=68}}{{refn|group=note|According to Cousins, Anderson misunderstands Norman in this respect, but does "not think that this misunderstanding of Norman's position critically affects Anderson's thesis. Even if these arguments do not prove that the four truths are definitely a later insertion in the Dhammacakkapavattana-sutta, it is certainly possible to take the position that the sutta itself is relatively late."{{sfn|Cousins|2001|p=38}}}}

According to Bronkhorst, the "twelve insights" are probably also a later addition, born out of unease with the substitution of the general term "prajna" for the more specific "four truths".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=106}}

====''Maha-parinibbana Sutta''====
According to the Buddhist tradition, the ''[[Maha-parinibbana Sutta]]'' (Last Days of the Buddha, Digha Nikaya 16) was given near the end of the Buddha's life. This sutta "gives a good general idea of the Buddha's Teaching:"<ref group=web name="ati_Maha-parinibbana_Sutta">[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html ''Maha-parinibbana Sutta: Last Days of the Buddha'', translated by Sister Vajira & Francis Story]</ref>
{{quote|And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Bhikkhus, it is through not realizing, through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you. What are these four? They are the noble truth of suffering; the noble truth of the origin of suffering; the noble truth of the cessation of suffering; and the noble truth of the way to the cessation of suffering. But now, bhikkhus, that these have been realized and penetrated, cut off is the craving for existence, destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming, and there is no fresh becoming."

Thus it was said by the Blessed One. And the Happy One, the Master, further said:

{{poemquote|Through not seeing the Four Noble Truths,
Long was the weary path from birth to birth.
When these are known, removed is rebirth's cause,
The root of sorrow plucked; then ends rebirth.}}
}}

====''Maha-salayatanika Sutta''====
The ''Maha-salayatanika Sutta'', Majjhima Nikaya 149:3 plus 149:9, give an alternative presentation of the four truths:
{{quote|When one abides inflamed by lust, fettered, infatuated, contemplating gratification, [...] [o]ne's bodily and mental troubles increase, one's bodily and mental torments increase, one's bodily and mental fevers increase, and one experiences bodily and mental suffering.<br><br>...when one does not know and see as it actually is [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as condition, then one is inflamed by lust for the eye, for forms, for eye-consciousness, for eye-contact, for [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as condition [repeated for the nose, tongue, body, mind].<br><br>When one abides uninflamed by lust, unfettered, uninfatuated, contemplating danger [...] one's craving [...] is abandoned.

==Emphasis within different traditions==

===Early Indian Buddhism===
The [[Ekavyāvahārika]] sect emphasized the transcendence of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], asserting that he was eternally enlightened and essentially non-physical. According to the Ekavyāvahārika, the words of the Buddha were spoken with one transcendent meaning, and the Four Noble Truths are to be understood simultaneously in one moment of insight.{{sfn|Rockhill |1884|pp=187–188}} According to the [[Mahīśāsaka]] sect, the Four Noble Truths should be meditated upon simultaneously.{{sfn|Potter|2004|p=106}}

===Theravada===
{{See also|Vipassana movement}}

According to Carol Anderson, the four truths have "a singular position within the Theravada canon and tradition."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=230–231}} The Theravada tradition regards insight in the four truths as liberating in itself.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}} As Walpola Rahula states, "when the Truth is seen, all the forces which feverishly produce the continuity of [[samsara]] in [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|illusion]] become calm and incapable of producing any more [[Karma in Buddhism|karma-formations]] [...] he is free from [...] the 'thirst' for becoming."<ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/>{{refn|group=note|Walpola Rahula:

* "When wisdom is developed and cultivated according to the Fourth Noble Truth (the next to be taken up), it sees the secret of life, the reality of things as they are. When the secret is discovered, when the Truth is seen, all the forces which feverishly produce the continuity of saṃsāra in illusion become calm and incapable of producing any more karma-formations, because there is no more illusion, no more ‘thirst’ for continuity."<ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/> 
* "The remaining two factors, namely Right Thought and Right Understanding go to constitute Wisdom."<ref group=web name="WP_ch5">{{cite web |website=Walpola Rahula: What the Buddha Taught |title=CHAPTER V. THE FOURTH NOBLE TRUTH: ''MAGGA'': THE PATH |url=https://sites.google.com/site/rahulawhatthebuddha/the-fourth-noble-truth}}</ref>
* "Right Understanding is the understanding of things as they are, and it is the Four Noble Truths that explain things as they really are. Right Understanding therefore is ultimately reduced to the understanding of the Four Noble Truths. This understanding is the highest wisdom which sees the Ultimate Reality."<ref group=web name="WP_ch5"/>}} This liberation can be attained in one single moment, when the four truths are understood together.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}} Within the [[Theravada]] tradition, great emphasis is placed upon reading and contemplating ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|The Discourse That Sets Turning the Wheel of Truth]]'', and other suttas, as a means to study the four noble truths and put them into practice.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=loc. 275–280}} For example, Ajahn Sumedho states: 
{{quote|The ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', the Buddha's teaching on the Four Noble Truths, has been the main reference that I have used for my practice over the years. It is the teaching we used in our monastery in Thailand. The Theravada school of Buddhism regards this sutta as the quintessence of the teachings of the Buddha. This one sutta contains all that is necessary for understanding the Dhamma and for enlightenment."{{sfn|Ajahn Sumedho| 2002|p=5}}}}

Within the Theravada-tradition, three different stances on ''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]]'' and the question what happens with the ''Arhat'' after death can be found.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=77}}{{sfn|Hick|1994|p=436}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|pp=96–97}}{{sfn|Geisler|Amano|2004|p=32}} ''Nirvana'' refers to the cessation of the defilements and the resulting peace of mind and happiness (''khlesa-nirvana''); to the final dissolution of the five skandhas at the time of death (''skandha-nirvana'' or ''[[parinirvana]]''); and to a transcendental reality which is "known at the moment of awakening".{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=77}}{{refn|group=note|Gethin: "(I) it is the extinguishing of the defilements of greed, hatred, and delusion; (2) it is the final condition of the Buddha and arhats after death consequent upon the extinction of the defilements; (3) it is the unconditioned realm known at the moment of awakening.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=77}}}} According to Gethin, "modern Buddhist usage tends to restrict 'nirvāṇa' to the awakening experience and reserve 'parinirvāṇa' for the death experience.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=76}} According to Geisler and Amano, in the "minimal Theravada interpretation", ''nirvana'' is a psychological state, which ends with the dissolution of the body and the total extinction of existence.{{sfn|Hick|1994|p=436}}{{sfn|Geisler|Amano|2004|p=32}} According to Geisler and Amano, the "orthodox Theravada interpretation" is that nirvana is a transcendent reality with which the self unites.{{sfn|Geisler|Amano|2004|p=32}} According to Bronkhorst, while "Buddhism preached liberation in this life, i.e. before death",{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=96}} there was also a tendency in Buddhism to think of liberation happening after death. According to Bronkhorst, this

{{quote|...becomes visible in those canonical passages which distinguish between Nirvana—qualified in Sanskrit and pali as "without a remainder of upadhi/upadi" (anupadhisesa/anupadisesa)—and the "highest and complete enlightenment" (anuttara samyaksambodhi/sammasambodhi). The former occurs at death, the latter in life.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=97}}}}

According to [[Walpola Rahula]], the cessation of ''dukkha'' is ''nirvana'', the ''summum bonum'' of Buddhism, and is attained in this life, not when one dies.<ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/> ''Nirvana'' is "perfect freedom, peace, tranquility and happiness",<ref group=web>{{cite web|website=Walpola Rahula: What the Buddha Taught |url=https://sites.google.com/site/rahulawhatthebuddha/the-first-noble-truth |title=CHAPTER II.

{{quote|... if Nirvāṇa is to be expressed and explained in positive terms, we are likely immediately to grasp an idea associated with those terms, which may be quite the contrary. Therefore it is generally expressed in negative terms."<ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/>}} According to Gombrich this distinction between [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] and cataphatic approaches can be found in all religions.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=150–152}} Rahula gives an overview of negative statements of ''nirvana,'' whereafter he states:

{{quote|Because Nirvana is thus expressed in negative terms, there are many who have got a wrong notion that it is negative, and expresses self-annihilation. Nirvāṇa is definitely no annihilation of self, because there is no self to annihilate. If at all, it is the annihilation of the illusion of the false idea of self.<br>
It is incorrect to say that Nirvāṇa is negative or positive. The ideas of ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ are relative, and are within the realm of duality. These terms cannot be applied to Nirvāṇa, Absolute Truth, which is beyond duality and relativity [...]<br><br>
Nirvāṇa is neither cause nor effect. It is beyond cause and effect. Truth is not a result nor an effect. It is not produced like a mystic, spiritual, mental state, such as dhyāna or samādhi. TRUTH IS. NIRVĀṆA IS.<ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/>}}

Rahula refers to the ''Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta'' (the Majjhima-nikāya 140) for his interpretation of "Nirvāṇa as Absolute Truth", which, according to Rahula, says: 

{{quote|O bhikkhu, that which is unreality (mosadhamma) is false; that which is reality (amosadhamma), Nibbāna, is Truth (Sacca). Therefore, O bhikkhu, a person so endowed is endowed with this Absolute Truth. For, the Absolute Noble Truth (paramaṃ ariyasaccaṃ) is Nibbāna, which is Reality.’<ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/>}}

While Jayatilleke translates ''amosadhamma'' as "ineffable",{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2009|p=306}} Thanissaro Bhikkhu gives a somewhat different translation:
{{quote|His release, being founded on truth, does not fluctuate, for whatever is deceptive is false; Unbinding—the undeceptive—is true. Thus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for truth, for this—Unbinding, the undeceptive—is the highest noble truth.<ref group=web>[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.140.than.html ''Dhatu-vibhanga Sutta: An Analysis of the Properties'']</ref>}}

In response to Rahula, [[Richard Gombrich]] states that:
{{quote|In proclaiming (in block capitals) that 'Truth is', Rahula has for a moment fallen into Upanisadic mode. Since truth can only be a property of propositions, which have subjects and predicates, and nirvana is not a proposition, it makes no sense in English to say that nirvana is truth. The confusion arises, perhaps, because the Sanskrit word satyam and the corresponding Pali word saccam can indeed mean either 'truth' or 'reality'. But in our language this will not work.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|pp=156–157}}}}

Richard Gombrich also states that Rahula's book would more aptly be titled ''What [[Buddhagosa]] Taught''.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|pp=156–157}}  According to David Kalupahana, Buddhagosa was influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, and introduced "the substantialist as well as essentialist standpoints of the Sarvastavadins and Sautrantikas."{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|pp=208, 210}}}}<!-- **END OF NOTE** --> Jayatilleke also speaks of "the attainment of an ultimate reality".{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2009|p=306}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the "elimination of craving culminates not only in the extinction of sorrow, anguish and distress, but in the unconditioned freedom of nibbana, which is won with the ending of reapeated rebirth."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2011|p=10}}

According to Spiro, most (lay) Theravada Buddhists do not aspire for ''nirvana'' and total extinction, but for a pleasurable rebirth in heaven.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|pp=76–77}} According to Spiro, this presents a "serious conflict" since the Buddhist texts and teaching "describe life as suffering and hold up nirvana as the ''summum bonum.''"{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=78}} In response to this deviation, "monks and others emphasize that the hope for nirvana is the only legitimate action for Buddhist action."{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=78}} Nevertheless, according to Spiro most Burmese lay Buddhists do not aspire for the extinction of existence which is ''nirvana''.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=78}}{{refn|group=note|name="Wallace"}}

According to [[B.R. Ambedkar]], the Indian Buddhist [[Dalit]] leader, the four truths were not part of the original teachings of the Buddha, but a later aggregation, due to Hindu influences.{{sfn|Karunyakara|2002|p=67}} According to Ambedkar, total cessation of suffering is an illusion; yet, the Buddhist Middle Path aims at the reduction of suffering and the maximizing of happiness, balancing both sorrow and happiness.{{sfn|Karunyakara|2002|pp=67–68}}

===Mahayana===
The four truths are less prominent in the Mahayana traditions, which emphasize insight into [[Śūnyatā]] and the [[bodhisattva|Bodhisattva path]] as a central elements in their teachings.{{sfn|Carter|1987|pp=3179–3180}} If the sutras in general are studied at all, it is through various Mahayana commentaries.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=103}}

According to Makransky the Mahayana Bodhisattva ideal created tensions in the explanation of the four truths.{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=345}} In the Mahayana view, a fully enlightened Buddha does not leave ''samsara'', but remains in the world out of compassion for all sentient beings.{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346}} The four truths, which aim at ending ''samsara'', do not provide a doctrinal basis for this view, and had to be reinterpreted.{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346}} In the old view, ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|klesas]]'' and ''karma'' are the cause of prolonged existence. According to Makransky, "[t]o remove those causes was, at physical death, to extinguish one's conditioned existence, hence to end forever one's participation in the world (Third Truth)."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346}} According to Makransky, the question of how a liberated being can still be "pervasively operative in this world" has been "a seminal source of ongoing doctrinal tension over Buddhahood throughout the history of the Mahayana in India and Tibet."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|pp=346–347}}

====Tibetan Buddhism====
[[Atisha]], in his ''[[Bodhipathapradīpa]]'' ("A Lamp for the Path to Awakening"), which forms the basis for the [[Lamrim]] tradition, discerns three levels of motivation for Buddhist practitioners.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17}} At the beginning level of motivation, one strives toward a better life in ''samsara''.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17}} At the intermediate level, one strives to a liberation from existence in samsara and the end of all suffering.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|pp=17, 66–67}} At the highest level of motivation, one strives after the liberation  of all living beings.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17}} In his commentary on the text, Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche explains that the four truths are to be meditated upon as a means of practice for the intermediate level.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|pp=66–67}}

According to [[Tashi Tsering (Jamyang Buddhist Centre)|Geshe Tashi Tsering]], within [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the four noble truths are studied as part of the Bodhisattva path. They are explained in Mahayana commentaries such as the ''[[Abhisamayalamkara]]'', a summary of and commentary on the [[Prajna Paramitra]] sutras, where they form part of the lower [[Hinayana]] teachings. The truth of the path (the fourth truth) is traditionally presented according to a progressive formula of [[Five Paths|five paths]], rather than as the eightfold path presented in Theravada.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=loc. 2187–2190}} According to Tsering, the study of the four truths is combined with the study of the [[sixteen characteristics]] of the four noble truths.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=loc. 741–743}}

Some contemporary Tibetan Buddhist teachers have provided commentary on the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' and the noble eightfold path when presenting the dharma to Western students.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=loc. 241}}{{sfn|Ringu Tulku|2005|pp=36–54}}{{sfn|Lama Surya Das|1997}}

===Western Buddhism===
For many western Buddhists, the rebirth doctrine in the Four Noble Truths teaching is a problematic notion.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}{{sfn|Hayes|2013|p=172}}{{sfn|Lamb|2001|p=258}}<ref group=web name="BB-rebirth">Bhikkhu Bodhi, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_46.html ''Does Rebirth Make Sense?'']</ref>{{refn|group=note|See also:<br>* [[James Ishmael Ford|James Ford]], [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2015/08/the-karma-and-rebirth-debate-within-contemporary-western-buddhism-some-links-to-follow.html ''The Karma and Rebirth Debate Within Contemporary Western Buddhism: Some Links to Follow'']<br>* Manon Welles, [http://aristocratsofthesoul.com/secular-buddhism-vs-traditional-buddhism-six-key-differences/ ''Secular Buddhism vs. Traditional Buddhism: 6 Key Differences'']<br>* Alan Peta, [http://www.alanpeto.com/buddhism/understanding-reincarnation-rebirth/ ''Reincarnation and Buddhism: Here We Go Again'']}} According to Lamb, "Certain forms of modern western Buddhism [...] see it as purely mythical and thus a dispensable notion."{{sfn|Lamb|2001|p=258}} According to Coleman, the focus of most vipassana students in the west "is mainly on meditation practice and a kind of down-to-earth psychological wisdom."{{sfn|Coleman|2002|p=110}}{{refn|group=note|According to Coleman, the goal in Theravada Buddhism "is to uproot the desires and defilements in order to attain nibbana (nirvana in Sanskrit) and win liberation from the otherwise endless round of death and rebirth. But few Western Vipassana teachers pay much attention to the more metaphysical aspects of such concepts as rebirth and nibbana, and of course very few of their students are celibate monks. Their focus is mainly on meditation practice and a kind of down-to-earth psychological wisdom. "As a result," one respected Vipassana teacher writes, "many more Americans of European descent refer to themselves as Vipassana students rather than as students of Theravada Buddhism."{{sfn|Coleman|2002|p=110}}}} According to [[Damien Keown]], westerners find "the ideas of [[karma]] and rebirth puzzling."{{sfn|Keown|2009|pp=60–63, 74–85, 185–187}} According to Gowans, many Western followers and people interested in exploring Buddhism are skeptical and object to the belief in karma and rebirth foundational to the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|pp=18–23, 76–88}}{{refn|group=note|Gowans groups the objections into three categories. The first objection can be called "consistency objection", which asks if "there is no self (atman, soul), then what is reborn and how does karma work?".

The third objection can be called "morality objection", which asks "why presume that an infant born with an illness, is because of karma in previous life" as seems implied by ''Majjhima Nikāya'' section 3.204 for example. Gowans provides a summary of prevailing answers, clarifications and explanations proffered by practicing Buddhists.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|pp=18–23, 76–88}}}} According to Konik,
{{quote|Since the fundamental problems underlying early Indian Buddhism and contemporary western Buddhism are not the same, the validity of applying the set of solutions developed by the first to the situation of the second becomes a question of great importance. Simply putting an end to rebirth would not necessarily strike the western Buddhist as the ultimate answer, as it certainly was for early Indian Buddhists.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}}}
 
According to Keown, it is possible to reinterpret the Buddhist doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths, since the final goal and the answer to the problem of suffering is [[nirvana]], and not rebirth.{{sfn|Keown|2009|pp=60–63, 74–85, 185–187}} Some Western interpreters have proposed what is sometimes referred to as "naturalized Buddhism". It is devoid of rebirth, karma, nirvana, realms of existence, and other concepts of Buddhism, with doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths reformulated and restated in modernistic terms.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|pp=18–23, 91–94}}{{sfn|Prothero|1996|p=128}}{{refn|group=note|Prothereo describes how Theosophist [[Henry Steel Olcott]] (1832–1907) reinterpreted Buddhism: "In addition to a restatement of the Four Noble Truths and the Five Precepts for lay Buddhists, the fourteen propositions included: an affirmation of religious tolerance and of the evolution of the universe, a rejection of supernaturalism, heaven or hell, and superstition, and an emphasis on education and the use of reason."{{sfn|Prothero|1996|p=128}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Owen Flanagan, the proportion of people in North America that believe in heaven is about the same as the proportion of East and Southeast Asia who believe in rebirth. But, 'rebirth' is considered superstitious by many in the West while 'heaven' is not, adds Flanagan, though a reflective naturalistic approach demands that both 'heaven' and 'rebirth' be equally questioned".{{sfn|Flanagan|2011|pp=2–3, 68–70, 79–80}} According to Donald S. Lopez, Buddhist movements in the West have reconstructed a "Scientific Buddha" and a "modern Buddhism" unknown in Asia, "one that may never have existed there before the late  19th-century".{{sfn|Lopez|2012|pp=39–43, 57–60, 74–76, 122–124}}}} This "deflated secular Buddhism" stresses compassion, impermanence, causality, selfless persons, no Boddhisattvas, no nirvana, no rebirth, and a naturalist's approach to well-being of oneself and others.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|pp=39–42}}

According to Melford Spiro, this approach undermines the Four Noble Truths, for it does not address the existential question for the Buddhist as to "why live? why not commit suicide, hasten the end of ''dukkha'' in current life by ending life". In traditional Buddhism, rebirth continues the ''dukkha'' and the path to cessation of ''dukkha'' isn't suicide, but the fourth reality of the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|pp=39–42}} The "naturalized Buddhism", according to Gowans, is a radical revision to traditional Buddhist thought and practice, and it attacks the structure behind the hopes, needs and rationalization of the realities of human life to traditional Buddhists in East, Southeast and South Asia.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|pp=18–23, 91–94}} According to Keown, it may not be necessary to believe in some of the core Buddhist doctrines to be a Buddhist, but the rebirth, karma, [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|realms of existence]] and cyclic universe doctrines underpin the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism.{{sfn|Keown|2009|pp=60–63, 74–85, 185–187}}

Traditional Buddhist scholars disagree with these modernist Western interpretations. Bhikkhu Bodhi, for example, states that rebirth is an integral part of the Buddhist teachings as found in the sutras, despite the problems that "modernist interpreters of Buddhism" seem to have with it.<ref group=web name="BB-rebirth"/>{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: "Newcomers to Buddhism are usually impressed by the clarity, directness, and earthy practicality of the Dhamma as embodied in such basic teachings as the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the threefold training. These teachings, as clear as day-light, are accessible to any serious seeker looking for a way beyond suffering. When, however, these seekers encounter the doctrine of rebirth, they often balk, convinced it just doesn't make sense. At this point, they suspect that the teaching has swerved off course, tumbling from the grand highway of reason into wistfulness and speculation. Even modernist interpreters of Buddhism seem to have trouble taking the rebirth teaching seriously. Some dismiss it as just a piece of cultural baggage, "ancient Indian metaphysics", that the Buddha retained in deference to the world view of his age. Others interpret it as a metaphor for the change of mental states, with the realms of rebirth seen as symbols for psychological archetypes. A few critics even question the authenticity of the texts on rebirth, arguing that they must be interpolations.<br>A quick glance at the Pali suttas would show that none of these claims has much substance. The teaching of rebirth crops up almost everywhere in the Canon, and is so closely bound to a host of other doctrines that to remove it would virtually reduce the Dhamma to tatters. Moreover, when the suttas speak about rebirth into the five realms—the hells, the animal world, the spirit realm, the human world, and the heavens—they never hint that these terms are meant symbolically. To the contrary, they even say that rebirth occurs "with the breakup of the body, after death," which clearly implies they intend the idea of rebirth to be taken quite literally."<ref group=web name="BB-rebirth"/>}} [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], as another example, rejects the "modern argument" that "one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth." He states, "rebirth has always been a central teaching in the Buddhist tradition."<ref group=web name="TB_Rebirth">Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/truth_of_rebirth.html ''The Truth of Rebirth. And Why it Matters for Buddhist Practice'']</ref>{{refn|group=note|Thanissaro Bhikkhu: "A second modern argument against accepting the canonical accounts of what's known in awakening—and in particular, the knowledge of rebirth achieved in awakening—is that one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth. After all, all the factors leading to suffering are all immediately present to awareness, so there should be no need, when trying to abandon them, to accept any premises about where they may or may not lead in the future.<br>This objection, however, ignores the role of appropriate attention on the path. As we noted above, one of its roles is to examine and abandon the assumptions that underlie one's views on the metaphysics of personal identity. Unless you're willing to step back from your own views—such as those concerning what a person is, and why that makes rebirth impossible—and subject them to this sort of examination, there's something lacking in your path. You'll remain entangled in the questions of inappropriate attention, which will prevent you from actually identifying and abandoning the causes of suffering and achieving the full results of the practice.<br><br>In addition, the terms of appropriate attention—the four noble truths—are not concerned simply with events arising and passing away in the present moment. They also focus on the causal connections among those events, connections that occur both in the immediate present and over time. If you limit your focus solely to connections in the present while ignoring those over time, you can't fully comprehend the ways in which craving causes suffering: not only by latching on to the four kinds of nutriment, but also giving rise to the four kinds of nutriment as well.<ref group=web name="TB_Rebirth"/>}}{{refn|group=note|According to Konik: {{quote|No doubt, according to the early Indian Buddhist tradition, the Buddha's great discovery, as condensed in his experience of nirvana, involved the remembrance of his many former existences, presupposing as fact the reality of a never-ending process of rebirth as a source of deep anxiety, and an acceptance of the Buddha's overcoming of that fate as ultimate liberation.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}}}}}

According to Owen Flanagan, the Dalai Lama states that "Buddhists believe in rebirth" and that this belief has been common among his followers. However, the Dalai Lama's belief, adds Flanagan, is more sophisticated than ordinary Buddhists, because it is not the same as [[reincarnation]]—rebirth in Buddhism is envisioned as happening without the assumption of an "atman, self, soul", but rather through a "consciousness conceived along the [[anatta|anatman]] lines".{{sfn|Flanagan|2014|pp=233–234 with note 1}}{{refn|group=note|The Dalai Lama himself is regarded to be an incarnation of the thirteen previous Dalai Lamas, who are all manifestations of [[Avalokitasvara]].{{sfn|Chitkara|1998|p=39}}}} The doctrine of rebirth is considered mandatory in Tibetan Buddhism, and across many Buddhist sects.{{sfn|Flanagan|2014|pp=234–235 with note 5}}

According to Christopher Gowans, for "most ordinary Buddhists, today as well as in the past, their basic moral orientation is governed by belief in karma and rebirth".{{sfn|Gowans|2014|pp=18–23, 76–88}} Buddhist morality hinges on the hope of well being in this lifetime or in future rebirths, with nirvana (enlightenment) a project for a future lifetime. A denial of karma and rebirth undermines their history, moral orientation and religious foundations.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|pp=18–23, 76–88}} According to Keown, most Buddhists in Asia do accept these traditional teachings, and seek better rebirth.{{sfn|Keown|2009|pp=60–63, 74–85, 185–187}}{{refn|group=note|The vast majority of Buddhist lay people, states Kevin Trainor, have historically pursued Buddhist rituals and practices motivated with rebirth into Deva realm.{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=62}} Fowler and others concur with Trainor, stating that better rebirth, not nirvana, has been the primary focus of a vast majority of lay Buddhists. This they attempt through merit accumulation and good ''kamma''.{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=65}}{{refn|group=note|Merv Foweler: "For a vast majority of Buddhists in Theravadin countries, however, the order of monks is seen by lay Buddhists as a means of gaining the most merit in the hope of accumulating good karma for a better rebirth."{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=65}}}}{{sfn|Gowans|2004|p=169}}}}

Gone, for instance, were the doctrines of karma and rebirth, the traditional emphasis on renunciation of the world, the practice of meditation, and the experience of enlightenment. Gone too were any teachings that implied the existence of a trans-empirical realm (...). Most jarring, perhaps, especially among more traditional Buddhists, was the absence of the Four Noble Truths, which Ambedkar regarded as the invention of wrong-headed monks".</ref>
