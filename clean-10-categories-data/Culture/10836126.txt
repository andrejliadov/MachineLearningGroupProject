'''Brain fag syndrome''' ('''BFS''') describes a [[Syndrome|set of symptoms]]: somatic, sleep-related and cognitive complaints, difficulty in concentrating and retaining information, head and neck pains, and eye pain.<ref name="Ola" /> The condition was first described in [[Education in Nigeria|Nigerian]] high school and university students in the 1960s.<ref name=Ola>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ola BA, Morakinyo O, Adewuya AO |title=Brain Fag Syndrome - a myth or a reality |journal=Afr J Psychiatry (Johannesbg) |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=135–43 |date=May 2009 |pmid=19582315 |doi= 10.4314/ajpsy.v12i2.43731|url=https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajpsy/article/view/43731|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |vauthors= ((Katona CLE)), Robertson MM |year= 2005 |title= Psychiatry at a Glance | location =  Oxford |publisher=  Blackwell Publishing Limited |isbn= 1-4051-2404-0}}</ref> It is considered a [[culture-bound syndrome]] caused by excessive pressure to be successful among the young.<ref>{{cite book|last=Byng|first=Patricia R.

== Classification ==
BFS is classified in the fourth revision of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV) as a [[culture-bound syndrome]].<ref name=Ola/>  Individuals with ''symptoms'' of brain fag must be differentiated from those with the ''syndrome'' according to the Brain Fag Syndrome Scale (BFSS);<ref name=Ola/> Ola ''et al'' said it would not be "surpris[ing] if BFS was called an equivalent of either depression or anxiety".<ref name=Ola/>

==Causes==
Morakinyo found in 20 persons with BFS an achievement drive that was [[anxiety]]-related that led to the use of psychostimulants and consequent [[sleep deprivation]] which contributed to cognitive disruption;<ref name=Ola/>  Omoluabi related BFS to test anxiety.<ref name=Ola/>

==Treatment==

Anumonye reported treatment success with lorazepam; others found benefit with antidepressants and relaxation exercises.<ref name=Ola/>

==Epidemiology==
BFS has been reported in other [[Africa]]n cultures,<ref name=Ola/> and also in Brazil, Argentina, and [[Ethiopian Jews]].<ref name=Ola/>   Historic higher reported prevalence among males may be due to more males being present in higher education in African countries.<ref name=Ola/>  Studies since the 1990s have not verified gender differences.<ref name=Ola/>  Other studies found a possible association with low [[socioeconomic status]], an association with average or higher intelligence, and a high association with [[neuroticism]].<ref name=Ola/>  Individuals with BFS have been found to have problems with isolation, poor study habits, and the use of [[psychostimulant]]s as well as physical changes including in muscle tension and heart rate.<ref name=Ola/>

==History==
The condition was first described by RH Prince who named the condition based on the term ''brain fag'' used by students who believed their symptoms were attributed to "brain fatigue".<ref name=Ola/> However, this term was used in the United States and Europe dating back to 1839.<ref>{{cite journal|author=C.

Ayonrinde<ref name=":0" /> concludes that, the time has come for the decolonization of brain fag and its African syndromization in the true spirit of ethical scientific rigour in the 21st century.{{cn|date=December 2020}}
