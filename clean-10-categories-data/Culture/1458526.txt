A '''national language''' is a [[language]] (or [[variety (linguistics)|language variant]], e.g. [[dialect]]) that has some connection—[[de facto]] or [[de jure]]—with a [[nation]]. There is little consistency in the use of this term. One or more languages spoken as [[first language]]s in the territory of a country may be referred to informally or designated in legislation as national languages of the country. National languages are mentioned in over 150 world constitutions.<ref>[http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/index.html Jacques Leclerc]</ref>{{Dead link|date=March 2019}}<!-- it would be helpful to narrow this down to just the number of constitutions that mention "national language," or to be precise as to the number of constitutions mentioning each or both, and it would be helpful to look for better sources -->

[[C.M.B. Brann]], with particular reference to India, suggests that there are "four quite distinctive meanings" for national language in a polity:<ref>Brann, C.M.B. 1994. "The National Language Question: Concepts and Terminology." ''Logos'' [University of Namibia, Windhoek] Vol 14: 125–134</ref>
*"Territorial language" (''chthonolect'', sometimes known as ''chtonolect''<ref>Wolff, H. Ekkehard "African Languages: An Introduction Ch./Art: Language and Society p. 321 pub. Cambridge University Press 2000</ref>) of a particular people
*"[[Regional language]]" (''choralect'')
*"Language-in-common or community language" (''demolect'') used throughout a country
*"Central language" (''politolect'') used by government and perhaps having a symbolic value.
The last is usually given the title of [[official language]]. In some cases (e.g., [[#Philippines|the Philippines]]), several languages are designated as ''official'' and a national language is separately designated.

== Official versus national languages ==
{{See also|Linguistic prescription|Linguistic rights}}
"National language" and "[[official language]]" are best understood as two concepts or legal categories with ranges of meaning that may coincide, or may be intentionally separate. [[Stateless nation]]s are not in the position to legislate an [[official language]], but their languages may be sufficiently distinct and well-preserved to be national languages. Some languages may be recognized popularly as "national languages," while others may enjoy official recognition in use or promotion.

In many African countries, some or all [[Indigenous language|indigenous]] [[African languages]] are officially used, promoted, or expressly allowed to be promoted (usually taught in schools and written in important publications) as semi-official languages whether by long-term legislation or short-term, case-by-case executive (government) measures.  To be official, spoken and written languages may enjoy government or federalised use, major tax-funded promotion or at least full tolerance as to their teaching and employers' recognition in [[public education]], standing on equal footing with the official language(s). Further, they may enjoy recognition as a language used in compulsory schooling and treasury money may be spent to teach or encourage adults in learning a language which is a minority language in a particular area to restore its understanding and spread its moral stories, rhymes, poems, phrases, songs, and other literary heritage which will promote [[social cohesion]] (where other languages remain) or will promote [[nationalism|nationalist differentiation]] where another, non-indigenous language is deprecated.<ref>''20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language'' http://www.plean2028.ie/en/node/14{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Williams | first = Colin H. | editor-last = Coupland | editor-first = Nikolas | title = English in Wales: Diversity, Conflict, and Change | place = Clevedon, Avon | publisher = Multilingual Matters | year = 1990 | contribution = The Anglicisation of Wales | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&q=monoglot+welsh+speakers&pg=PA38 | pages = 38–41 | isbn = 9781853590313 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tPwYt3gVbu4C&q=monoglot%20welsh%20speakers&pg=PP1}}</ref>

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Nationalisms in Canada|Bilingualism in Canada|Languages of Canada}}
[[Canada]]'s official languages since the [[Official Languages Act of 1969]] are [[English language|English]] ([[Canadian English]]) and [[French language|French]] ([[Canadian French]]).  Depending on one's views of what constitutes a "nation", these two languages may be considered two equal national languages of the nation of Canada, or the national languages of two nations within one state, [[English Canada]] and [[French Canada]].

[[Quebec nationalists]] consider [[Quebec French]] the language of the Quebec nation.

Two of Canada's northern territories legislate a variety of Indigenous languages. [[Nunavut]] holds [[Inuktitut]] and [[Inuinnaqtun]] as official languages, and [[Northwest Territories]] has nine official languages aside from English and French: [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Chipewyan language|Dënesųłiné]], [[Gwich’in language|Gwich’in]], Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, [[Slavey language|North and South Slavey]] and [[Dogrib language|Tłı̨chǫ]]. As these official languages are legislated at a territorial (sub-federal) level, they can be construed as national languages.

Besides these there many [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Indigenous languages of Canada]] which are the national languages of one or more of Canada's [[First Nations]] groups, [[Inuit]] and [[Metis people (Canada)|Métis]] (mixed First Nations-European peoples); a number of First Nations legislate at the Indigenous government levels their language as an official language of the Nation, such is the case with the [[Nisg̱a’a language]] in [[Nisg̱a’a]]. Notably the [[Cree language]] is spoken (with variations) from Alberta to Labrador,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Ojibwe language|Anishinaabemowin]] is spoken across central Canada and Inuktitut is spoken across the arctic.

=== China ===
{{see also|Languages of China|Standard Chinese|History of Mandarin}}
There are many languages spoken across [[China]], with most people speaking one of several [[varieties of Chinese]]. During successive imperial dynasties, the spoken language of the capital city served as the official spoken language and was used across the country by government officials who traveled to communicate with one another. Dialects used for this purpose in different eras included those of [[Xi'an]], [[Luoyang]], [[Nanjing]], [[Beijing]], and [[Historical capitals of China|other historical capital cities]].

After the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese nationalists) founded the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. In order to promote a sense of national unity and enhance the efficiency of communications within the nation, the government decided to designate a national language. The [[Beijing dialect]] of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Cantonese|Guangzhou dialect]] of [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] were each proposed as the basis for a national language for China.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In the beginning, there were attempts to introduce elements from other Chinese varieties into the national language in addition to those from the Beijing dialect; this was reflected in the first official dictionary of the national language, given the name {{Lang|zh-Hant|國語}} ([[Pinyin]]: {{Lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|Guóyǔ}}, literally "national language"). But this artificial language had no native speakers and was difficult to learn, so it was abandoned in 1924. Ultimately, the Beijing dialect was chosen as the national language and it continued to be referred to as {{Lang|zh-Hant|國語}} in Chinese in the Republic of China. Since then, the Beijing dialect has become the main standard for pronunciation, due to its prestigious status during the preceding [[Qing Dynasty]].

Still, elements from other dialects do exist in the standard language, which is now defined as reflecting the pronunciation of Beijing, the grammatical patterns of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] dialects spoken in the northern parts of China, and the vocabulary of modern vernacular Chinese literature. The People's Republic of China renamed the national language {{Lang|zh-Hans|普通话}} (Pinyin: Pǔtōnghuà, literally "common speech"), without otherwise changing the definition of the standard national language.<ref>{{Citation

The 1973 [[Constitution of the Philippines|Philippine constitution]] hegemonically imposed [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] national language at the expense of all other ethnic nationalities in the country and mandated development and formal adoption of a common national language to be known as [[Filipino language|Filipino]]. English ([[Philippine English]]) was also designated as an official language, "until otherwise provided by law".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/1973-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-2/|title=1973 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines|at=Article XV, Section 3}}</ref>

The 1987 constitution designated the [[Filipino language]], which is based on Tagalog with the inclusion of terms from all recognized [[languages of the Philippines]], as the national language.

=== Singapore ===
{{Main|Languages of Singapore}}
[[Singapore]] has four official languages: [[English language|English]] ([[Singapore English]]), [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Although English is the primary language of business, government, and education, Malay is designated as the national language. This is due to the geographical and historical ties to [[Malaysia]] as well as the recognition of ethnic [[Malays in Singapore|Malays]] (about 14% of the population) as the indigenous people of Singapore.

Traditionally, the [[lingua franca]] among the different ethnic groups in Singapore was [[Malay trade and creole languages|Bazaar Malay]], a Malay-based [[Malay-based creole languages|creole]]. Since independence, the government has been promoting English as the main language of Singapore. The bilingual education policy requires students to study two languages: English and a "mother tongue" corresponding to the student's ethnicity. Malay is only offered to non-Malay students as an optional third language in secondary schools. As a result, English has displaced Bazaar Malay as the common language among Singaporeans. Therefore, despite the status of Malay as the national language, the majority doesn't speak it.
