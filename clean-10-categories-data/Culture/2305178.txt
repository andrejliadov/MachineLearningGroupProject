In [[medicine]] and [[medical anthropology]], a '''culture-bound syndrome''', '''culture-specific syndrome''', or '''folk illness''' is a combination of psychiatric and somatic [[symptom]]s that are considered to be a recognizable disease only within a specific society or [[culture]]. There are no objective biochemical or structural alterations of [[organ (anatomy)|body organs]] or functions, and the disease is not recognized in other cultures. The term ''culture-bound syndrome'' was included in the fourth version of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[American Psychiatric Association]], 1994) which also includes a list of the most common culture-bound conditions ([[DSM-IV]]: Appendix I). Counterpart within the framework of [[ICD-10]] ([[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders|Chapter V]]) are the ''culture-specific disorders'' defined in Annex 2 of the ''Diagnostic criteria for research''.<ref name="ICD10Diag">[https://www.who.int/entity/classifications/icd/en/GRNBOOK.pdf Diagnostic criteria for research], p. 213–225 ([[World Health Organization|WHO]] 1993)</ref>

More broadly, an [[endemic]] that can be attributed to certain behavior patterns within a specific culture by [[suggestion]] may be referred to as a potential '''behavioral epidemic'''. As in the cases of [[drug abuse|drug]] use, or [[alcohol abuse|alcohol]] and smoking abuses, [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] can be determined by [[communal reinforcement]] and person-to-person interactions. On [[etiological]] grounds, it can be difficult to distinguish the causal contribution of culture upon disease from other [[environmental factor]]s such as [[toxicity]].<ref name=Porta-2008>{{cite encyclopedia|editor=Porta, Miquel |encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Epidemiology| edition=5th | title=Behavioral epidemic | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7R-MLMyEgwC&pg=PT48|accessdate=25 August 2013| year=2008| publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-157844-1|page=48}}</ref>

==Identification==

A culture-specific syndrome is characterized by:{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
# categorization as a [[disease]] in the culture (i.e., not a voluntary behaviour or false claim);
# widespread familiarity in the culture;
# complete lack of familiarity or misunderstanding of the condition to people in other cultures;
# no objectively demonstrable biochemical or tissue abnormalities (signs);
# the condition is usually recognized and treated by the [[folk medicine]] of the culture.

Some culture-specific syndromes involve somatic symptoms (pain or disturbed function of a body part), while others are purely behavioral. Some culture-bound syndromes appear with similar features in several cultures, but with locally specific traits, such as [[penis panic]]s.

A culture-specific syndrome is not the same as a geographically localized disease with specific, identifiable, causal tissue abnormalities, such as [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]] or [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], or genetic conditions limited to certain populations. It is possible that a condition originally assumed to be a culture-bound behavioral syndrome is found to have a biological cause; from a medical perspective it would then be redefined into another [[nosology|nosological]] category.

<blockquote>The term ''culture-bound syndrome'' denotes recurrent, locality-specific patterns of aberrant behavior and troubling experience that may or may not be linked to a particular DSM-IV diagnostic category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be "illnesses," or at least afflictions, and most have local names. Although presentations conforming to the major DSM-IV categories can be found throughout the world, the particular symptoms, course, and social response are very often influenced by local cultural factors. In contrast, culture-bound syndromes are generally limited to specific societies or culture areas and are localized, folk, diagnostic categories that frame coherent meanings for certain repetitive, patterned, and troubling sets of experiences and observations.</blockquote>

The term ''culture-bound syndrome'' is controversial since it reflects the different opinions of anthropologists and psychiatrists.<ref>Perry, S. (2012, 13 January).

Some studies suggest that culture-bound syndromes represent an acceptable way within a specific culture (and cultural context) among certain vulnerable individuals (i.e. an ''[[ataque de nervios]]'' at a funeral in Puerto Rico) to express distress in the wake of a traumatic experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Schechter|first1=Daniel S.|last2=Marshall|first2=Randall|last3=Salmán|first3=Ester|last4=Goetz|first4=Deborah|last5=Davies|first5=Sharon|last6=Liebowitz|first6=Michael R.|date=July 2000|title=Ataque de nervios and history of childhood trauma|journal=Journal of Traumatic Stress|volume=13|issue=3|pages=529–534|doi=10.1023/a:1007797611148|pmid=10948492|s2cid=33348909|issn=0894-9867}}</ref> A similar manifestation of distress when displaced into a North American medical culture may lead to a very different, even adverse outcome for a given individual and his or her family.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Schechter|first1=Daniel S.|last2=Kaminer|first2=Tammy|last3=Grienenberger|first3=John F.|last4=Amat|first4=Jose|date=2003|title=Fits and Starts: A Mother-Infant Case-Study Involving Intergenerational Violent Trauma and Pseudoseizures Across Three Generations|journal=[[Infant Mental Health Journal]]|volume=24|issue=5|pages=510–528|doi=10.1002/imhj.10070|issn=0163-9641|pmc=2078527|pmid=18007961}}</ref> The history and etymology of some syndromes such as Brain- Fag Syndrome, have also been reattributed to 19<sup>th</sup> century Victorian Britain rather than West Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ayonrinde|first=Oyedeji A.|date=2020-06-26|title='Brain fag': a syndrome associated with 'overstudy' and mental exhaustion in 19th century Britain|journal=International Review of Psychiatry|volume=0|issue=5–6|pages=520–535|doi=10.1080/09540261.2020.1775428|issn=0954-0261|pmid=32589474|s2cid=220121013}}</ref> 

In 2013, the DSM 5, dropped the term culture-bound syndrome, preferring the new name “Cultural Concepts of Distress”.<ref>{{Cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|date=2013-05-22|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|language=en|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596|hdl=2027.42/138395}}</ref>
