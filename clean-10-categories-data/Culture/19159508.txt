'''Culture''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ʌ|l|tʃ|ər}}) is an umbrella term which encompasses the [[social behavior]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[Society|societies]], as well as the [[knowledge]], [[Belief|beliefs]], [[Art|arts]], [[Law|laws]], [[Social norm|customs]], capabilities, and [[Habit|habits]] of the individuals in these groups.<ref name= tyor1871 >Tylor, Edward. (1871). Primitive Culture. Vol 1. New York: J.P. Putnam's Son</ref>

Humans acquire culture through the [[learning]] processes of [[enculturation]] and [[socialization]], which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies.

A [[cultural norm]] codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group.
Accepting only a [[monoculturalism|monoculture]] in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change.<ref>Jackson, Y. Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology, p. 203</ref> 
Thus in military culture, [[Courage|valor]] is counted a typical behavior for an individual and duty, honor, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues or functional responses in the [[continuum of conflict]]. In the practice of religion, analogous attributes can be identified in a social group.

Culture is considered a central concept in [[anthropology]], encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social [[learning]] in human [[society|societies]]. [[Cultural universals]] are found in all human societies. These include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[Tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of [[social organization]] (including practices of [[political organization]] and social [[institutions]]), [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]] (both [[writing|written]] and [[oral literature|oral]]), and [[science]] comprise the [[intangible cultural heritage]] of a society.<ref name="Macionis, Gerber and 2010 53">{{Cite book|title=Sociology|last1=Macionis|first1=John J|last2=Gerber|first2=Linda Marie|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|oclc=652430995|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|location=Toronto|language=en|page=53|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In the [[humanities]], one sense of culture as an attribute of the individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication in [[the arts]], sciences, [[education]], or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been used to distinguish [[civilization]]s from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in [[Social class|class-based]] distinctions between a [[high culture]] of the social [[elite]] and a [[low culture]], [[popular culture]], or [[folk culture]] of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to [[cultural capital]]. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by [[ethnicity|ethnic groups]] to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as [[body modification]], [[clothing]] or [[jewelry]]. [[Media culture|Mass culture]] refers to the [[Mass production|mass-produced]] and [[mass media]]ted forms of [[consumer culture]] that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as [[Marxism]] and [[critical theory]], have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the [[proletariat]] and create a [[false consciousness]]. Such perspectives are common in the discipline of [[cultural studies]]. In the wider [[social sciences]], the theoretical perspective of [[cultural materialism (cultural studies)|cultural materialism]] holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in [[human evolution|evolved biological]] dispositions.

When used as a [[count noun]], a "culture" is the set of customs, [[tradition]]s, and values of a society or community, such as an ethnic group or nation. Culture is the set of knowledge acquired over time. In this sense, [[multiculturalism]] values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet. Sometimes "culture" is also used to describe specific practices within a subgroup of a society, a [[subculture]] (e.g. "[[bro culture]]"), or a [[counterculture]]. Within [[cultural anthropology]], the ideology and analytical stance of [[cultural relativism]] hold that cultures cannot easily be objectively ranked or evaluated because any evaluation is necessarily situated within the value system of a given culture.

== Etymology ==
The modern term "culture" is based on a term used by the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] orator [[Cicero]] in his ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'', where he wrote of a cultivation of the soul or ''"cultura animi,"''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZcOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA273|title=Tusculanes|last1=Cicéron|first1=Marcus Tullius Cicero|last2=Bouhier|first2=Jean|date=1812|publisher=J.

[[Samuel Pufendorf]] took over this metaphor in a modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer assuming that philosophy was man's natural perfection. His use, and that of many writers after him, "''refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original [[Barbarian|barbarism]], and through artifice, become fully human."''<ref name=velkley>{{Cite book|title=Being after Rousseau: philosophy and culture in question|last=Velkley|first=Richard L|date=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|oclc=47930775|isbn=978-0-226-85256-0|chapter=The Tension in the Beautiful: On Culture and Civilization in Rousseau and German Philosophy|pages=11–30|location=Chicago|language=en}}</ref>

In 1986, philosopher [[Edward S. Casey]] wrote, "The very word ''culture'' meant 'place tilled' in Middle English, and the same word goes back to Latin ''colere'', 'to inhabit, care for, till, worship' and ''cultus'', 'A cult, especially a religious one.' To be cultural, to have a culture, is to inhabit a place sufficiently intensely to cultivate it—to be responsible for it, to respond to it, to attend to it caringly."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sorrells|first1=Kathryn|title=Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice|date=2015|publisher=Sage|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-4129-2744-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/interculturalcom0000sorr}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}<!-- Ref provided is based purely on ASIN from earlier, incomplete, citation.

Culture described by [[Richard Velkley]]:<ref name=velkley/> <blockquote>... originally meant the cultivation of the soul or mind, acquires most of its later modern meaning in the writings of the 18th-century German thinkers, who were on various levels developing [[Rousseau]]'s criticism of "[[modernity|modern]] [[liberalism]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]." Thus a contrast between "culture" and "[[civilization]]" is usually implied in these authors, even when not expressed as such.</blockquote>

In the words of anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]], it is "that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."{{sfn|Tylor|1974|loc=1}} Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, "Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/9294719|title=Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability|last1=James|first1=Paul|last2=Magee|first2=Liam|last3=Scerri|first3=Andy|last4=Steger|first4=Manfred|date=2015|isbn=978-1-138-02572-1|oclc=942553107|page=53|publisher=Routledge|location=London|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626015736/http://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_|archive-date=June 26, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with [[symbol]]s and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of [[behavioral modernity]] in humans around 50,000 years ago and is often thought to be unique to humans. However, some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complicated, abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that are transmitted through social [[interaction]] and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form.

It has been estimated from archaeological data that the human capacity for cumulative culture emerged somewhere between 500,000–170,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lind|first1=J.|last2=Lindenfors|first2=P.|last3=Ghirlanda|first3=S.|last4=Lidén|first4=K.|last5=Enquist|first5=M.|date=2013-05-07|title=Dating human cultural capacity using phylogenetic principles|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=3|issue=1|page=1785|doi=10.1038/srep01785|issn=2045-2322|pmc=3646280|pmid=23648831|df=mdy-all|bibcode=2013NatSR...3E1785L}}</ref>

[[Raimon Panikkar]] identified 29 ways in which [[cultural change]] can be brought about, including growth, development, evolution, [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]], renovation, [[reconception]], reform, [[social innovation|innovation]], revivalism, [[social revolution|revolution]], [[mutation]], [[social progress|progress]], [[diffusion]], [[Social osmosis|osmosis]], borrowing, [[eclecticism]], [[syncretism]], modernization, [[indigenization]], and transformation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religious Pluralism: An Indian Christian Perspective|last=Panikkar|first=Raimon|editor-last=Pathil|editor-first=Kuncheria|date=1991|publisher=[[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge|ISPCK]]|isbn=978-81-7214-005-2|oclc=25410539|pages=252–99}}</ref> In this context, modernization could be viewed as adoption of Enlightenment era beliefs and practices, such as science, rationalism, industry, commerce, democracy, and the notion of progress.

Alexander]], has proposed a model of cultural change based on claims and bids, which are judged by their [[cognitive adequacy]] and endorsed or not endorsed by the symbolic authority of the cultural community in question.<ref name="meaning-in-action" />

[[Cultural invention]] has come to mean any innovation that is new and found to be useful to a group of people and expressed in their behavior but which does not exist as a physical object. Humanity is in a global "accelerating culture change period," driven by the expansion of international commerce, the mass media, and above all, the [[World population|human population]] explosion, among other factors.

Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. These forces are related to both [[social structure]]s and natural events, and are involved in the perpetuation of cultural ideas and practices within [[structuration|current structures]], which themselves are subject to change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/change/change_2.htm|title=Culture Change: Processes of Change|last=O'Neil|first=Dennis|date=2006|website=Culture Change|publisher=Palomar College|access-date=October 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027181934/http://anthro.palomar.edu/change/change_2.htm|archive-date=October 27, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new [[schema (psychology)|cultural models]], and spurring or enabling [[generative actor|generative action]]. These social shifts may accompany [[ideology|ideological]] shifts and other types of cultural change. For example, the U.S. [[feminist movement]] involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last [[ice age]], plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the invention of [[agriculture]], which in turn brought about many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pringle|first=Heather|date=November 20, 1998|title=The Slow Birth of Agriculture|journal=Science|volume=282|issue=5393|page=1446|doi=10.1126/science.282.5393.1446|s2cid=128522781|issn=0036-8075|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or acculturation. In [[diffusion (anthropology)|diffusion]], the form of something (though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For example, Western restaurant chains and culinary brands sparked curiosity and fascination to the Chinese as China opened its economy to international trade in the late 20th-century.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eater.com/2018/3/20/16973532/mcdonalds-starbucks-kfc-china-pizza-hut-growth-sales |title=Why China Loves American Chain Restaurants So Much |last=Wei |first=Clarissa |date=March 20, 2018 |website=Eater |access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref> "Stimulus diffusion" (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. "Direct borrowing," on the other hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another. [[Diffusion of innovations]] theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas, practices, and products.

[[Acculturation]] has different meanings. Still, in this context, it refers to the replacement of traits of one culture with another, such as what happened to certain [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes and many indigenous peoples across the globe during the process of [[colonization]]. Related processes on an individual level include [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] (adoption of a different culture by an individual) and [[transculturation]]. The transnational flow of culture has played a major role in merging different cultures and sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.

==Early modern discourses==

===German Romanticism===
[[File: Johann gottfried herder.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johann Herder]] called attention to national cultures.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) formulated an individualist definition of "enlightenment" similar to the concept of ''[[bildung]]'': "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity."<ref>Kant, Immanuel. 1784. "Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?" (German: "Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?") ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'', December (Berlin Monthly)</ref> He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: ''Sapere Aude'', "Dare to be wise!" In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of ''Bildung'': "For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/USC/pbt1.html|title=The German Bildung Tradition|last=Eldridge|first=Michael|publisher=[[UNC Charlotte]]|access-date=2017-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123162257/http://www.philosophy.uncc.edu/mleldrid/SAAP/USC/pbt1.html|archive-date=January 23, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Adolf Bastian.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adolf Bastian]] developed a universal model of culture.]]
In 1795, the Prussian linguist and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], scholars in [[Germany]], especially those concerned with [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements—such as the nationalist struggle to create a "Germany" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]—developed a more inclusive notion of culture as "[[world view|worldview]]" (''Weltanschauung'').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Humboldt, Worldview, and Language|last=Underhill|first=James W.|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2009|location=Edinburgh}}</ref> According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between "civilized" and "primitive" or "tribal" cultures.

In 1860, [[Adolf Bastian]] (1826–1905) argued for "the psychic unity of mankind."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Adolf Bastian and the psychic unity of mankind|last=Köpping|first=Klaus-Peter|date=2005|publisher=Lit Verlag|isbn=978-3-8258-3989-5|oclc=977343058}}</ref> He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of "elementary ideas" (''Elementargedanken''); different cultures, or different "folk ideas" (''Völkergedanken''), are local modifications of the elementary ideas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://todayinsci.com/B/Bastian_Adolf/BastianAdolf.htm|title=Biography of Adolf Bastian, ethnologist|last=Ellis|first=Ian|website=Today in Science History|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806215336/https://todayinsci.com/B/Bastian_Adolf/BastianAdolf.htm|archive-date=August 6, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.

===English Romanticism===
[[File:Matthew Arnold - Project Gutenberg eText 16745.jpg|thumb|left|upright|British poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] viewed "culture" as the cultivation of the humanist ideal.]]

In the 19th century, [[Humanism|humanists]] such as [[English people|English]] poet and essayist [[Matthew Arnold]] (1822–1888) used the word "culture" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of "the best that has been thought and said in the world."<ref name=anarchy>{{Cite web|url=http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_all.html|title=Culture and Anarchy|last=Arnold|first=Matthew|date=1869|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106012655/http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/nonfiction_u/arnoldm_ca/ca_all.html|archive-date=January 6, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This concept of culture is also comparable to the [[German people|German]] concept of ''bildung'': "...culture being a pursuit of our total [[perfection]] by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world."<ref name=anarchy />

In practice, ''culture'' referred to an [[elite]] ideal and was associated with such activities as [[art]], [[European classical music|classical music]], and [[haute cuisine]].<ref>Williams (1983), p. 90. Cited in {{Cite book|title=Understanding popular music|last=Roy|first=Shuker|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-10723-5|oclc=245910934|page=[https://archive.org/details/understandingpop0000shuk_i1i5/page/5 5]|url=https://archive.org/details/understandingpop0000shuk_i1i5/page/5}} argues that contemporary definitions of culture fall into three possibilities or mixture of the following three:
* "a general process of intellectual, spiritual, and aesthetic development."
* "a particular way of life, whether of a people, period or a group."
* "the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity." </ref> As these forms were associated with urban life, "culture" was identified with "civilization" (from lat. ''civitas'', city). Another facet of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement was an interest in [[folklore]], which led to identifying a "culture" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between [[high culture]], namely that of the [[Ruling class|ruling]] [[social group]], and [[low culture]]. In other words, the idea of "culture" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.<ref>Bakhtin 1981, p. 4</ref>

[[File: Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|upright|British anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] was one of the first English-speaking scholars to use the term culture in an inclusive and universal sense.]]

Matthew Arnold contrasted "culture" with [[anarchy]]; other Europeans, following [[philosophy|philosophers]] [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], contrasted "culture" with "the state of nature." According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between "civilized" and "uncivilized." According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to [[Herbert Spencer]]'s theory of [[Social Darwinism]] and [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s theory of [[cultural evolution]]. Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, other critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects.

Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and [[sophistication]] of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature.<!-- i.e., American Transcendentalism?? --> These critics considered [[folk music]] (as produced by "the folk," i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed [[indigenous peoples]] as "[[noble savage]]s" living [[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]] and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified [[capitalism|capitalist]] systems of [[Western culture|the West]].

In 1870 the anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor|Edward Tylor]] (1832–1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the [[evolution of religion]]. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms.<ref>McClenon, pp. 528–29</ref> In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of religion.

{{main|Sociology of culture}}
[[File:04162012Bailes032.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|An example of folkloric dancing in [[Colombia]].]]

The [[sociology of culture]] concerns culture as manifested in [[society]]. For sociologist [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918), culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/oclc/951272809|title=Georg Simmel on individuality and social forms: selected writings|last=Simmel|first=Georg|editor-last=Levine|editor-first=Donald N|date=1971|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-75776-6|location=Chicago|page=xix|access-date=May 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912194431/https://www.worldcat.org/title/oclc/951272809|archive-date=September 12, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As such, culture in the [[sociology|sociological]] field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life. Culture can be any of two types, [[non-material culture]] or [[material culture]].<ref name=" Macionis, Gerber and 2010 53" /> Non-material culture refers to the non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in archeological and anthropological studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be attributed to culture, past or present.

Cultural sociology first emerged in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]] (1918–1933), where sociologists such as [[Alfred Weber]] used the term ''Kultursoziologie'' (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then "reinvented" in the English-speaking world as a product of the "[[cultural turn]]" of the 1960s, which ushered in [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] and [[postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may be loosely regarded as an approach incorporating [[cultural analysis]] and [[critical theory]]. Cultural sociologists tend to reject scientific methods, instead [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] focusing on words, artifacts and symbols.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|date=June 5, 1996|website=Lingua Franca|access-date=October 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326152500/http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|archive-date=March 26, 2007|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}} Physicist [[Alan Sokal]] published a paper in a journal of cultural sociology stating that gravity was a social construct that should be examined hermeneutically. See [[Sokal affair]] for further details.</ref> "Culture" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like [[social stratification]] and [[social network|social network analysis]]. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus, there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and instead, look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of [[social psychology]] and [[cognitive science]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Is any research confirms this claim/trend? Otherwise, can this claim be backed up by any major work about this new vein with many substantive contributors (handbook, encyclopedia, periodic dedicated to this new vein, etc.)?

===Early researchers and development of cultural sociology===
The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology (as shaped by early theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Karl Marx: His Life and Environment|last1=Berlin|first1=Isaiah|last2=Ryan|first2=Alan|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510326-7|oclc=611127754|location=New York|language=en|page=[https://archive.org/details/karlmarxhislifee00berl/page/130 130]|url=https://archive.org/details/karlmarxhislifee00berl/page/130}}</ref> [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]) with the growing discipline of [[anthropology]], wherein researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development of the field lingers in the methods (much of cultural, sociological research is qualitative), in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities), and in the substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between [[popular culture]], political control, and [[social class]] were early and lasting concerns in the field.

==Cultural studies==
{{main|Cultural studies}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], sociologists and other scholars influenced by [[Marxism]] such as [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] (1932–2014) and [[Raymond Williams]] (1921–1988) developed [[cultural studies]]. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified "culture" with consumption goods and leisure activities (such as art, music, film, [[food]], sports, and clothing). They saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by [[relations of production]], which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Raymond|date=1983|title=Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=87–93, 236–38|language=en|df=mdy-all|oclc=906396817}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Ways of seeing|last=Berger|first=John|date=1972|publisher=Peter Smithn|isbn=978-0-563-12244-9|oclc=780459348|language=en|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
[[File:Metropolitan Museum 1 (4675714481).jpg|thumb|The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[Manhattan]]. [[Visual art]] is one expression of culture.]]
In the United States, cultural studies focuses largely on the study of [[popular culture]]; that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods. [[Richard Hoggart]] coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] or CCCS.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Studying Culture – Reflections and Assessment: An Interview with Richard Hoggart|journal=Media, Culture & Society|volume=13}}</ref> It has since become strongly associated with [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/sep/23/communities.politicsphilosophyandsociety|title=Cultural hallmark|last=Adams|first=Tim|date=September 23, 2007|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 30, 2016|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031030223/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/sep/23/communities.politicsphilosophyandsociety|archive-date=October 31, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> who succeeded Hoggart as Director.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Stuart Hall|last=James|first=Procter|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-26267-5|oclc=318376213}}</ref> Cultural studies in this sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as "[[Western culture|Western civilization]]" or "[[globalism]]."

From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], [[Dick Hebdige]], Tony Jefferson, and [[Angela McRobbie]], created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed, it began to combine [[political economy]], [[communication]], [[sociology]], [[social theory]], [[literary theory]], [[Media influence|media theory]], [[film theory|film/video studies]], [[cultural anthropology]], [[philosophy]], [[museum studies]], and [[art history]] to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of [[ideology]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[social class]], and/or [[gender]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introducing Cultural Studies|last1=Sardar|first1=Ziauddin|last2=Van Loon|first2=Borin|last3=Appignanesi|first3=Richard|date=1994|publisher=Totem Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-84046-587-7|oclc=937991291}}</ref> Cultural studies is concerned with the [[Value (personal and cultural)|meaning]] and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends to "fit in" certainly qualifies since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice.

In the context of cultural studies, the idea of a ''text'' includes not only [[written language]], but also [[film]]s, [[photography|photographs]], [[fashion]] or [[hairstyle]]s: the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Myths of Oz: reading Australian popular culture|last1=Fiske|first1=John|last2=Turner|first2=Graeme|last3=Hodge|first3=Robert Ian Vere|date=1987|publisher=Allen and Unwin|isbn=978-0-04-330391-7|oclc=883364628|location=London|language=en}}</ref> Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of "culture."

The last two, in fact, have become the main focus of cultural studies. A further and recent approach is [[comparative cultural studies]], based on the disciplines of [[comparative literature]] and cultural studies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|title=Comparative Cultural Studies|date=2015|website=Purdue University Press|access-date=October 30, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805230001/http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|archive-date=August 5, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Scholars in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] developed somewhat different versions of cultural studies after the late 1970s. The British version of cultural studies had originated in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly under the influence of Richard Hoggart, [[E.P. Thompson]], and [[Raymond Williams]], and later that of Stuart Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the [[University of Birmingham]]. This included overtly political, [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] views, and criticisms of [[popular culture]] as "capitalist" [[mass culture]]; it absorbed some of the ideas of the [[Frankfurt School]] critique of the "[[culture industry]]" (i.e. mass culture). This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and [[Paul Gilroy]].

In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, "Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Qualitative Communication Research Methods|last1=Lindlof|first1=Thomas R|last2=Taylor|first2=Bryan C|date=2002|publisher=Sage|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-7619-2493-7|oclc=780825710|page=[https://archive.org/details/qualitativecommu00lind/page/60 60]|url=https://archive.org/details/qualitativecommu00lind/page/60}}</ref> The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, [[mass culture]]; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of [[fandom]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a [[Marxist]] model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the [[Frankfurt School]], but especially from the [[structuralism|structuralist]] Marxism of [[Louis Althusser]] and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the ''production'' of [[Value (personal and cultural)|meaning]]. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies [[power (social and political)|power]] as residing with those producing [[cultural artifact]]s. In a Marxist view, the [[mode of production|mode]] and [[relations of production]] form the economic base of society, which constantly interacts and influences [[base and superstructure|superstructures]], such as culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/marxism |title=Marxism |last=Gonick |first=Cy |date=February 7, 2006 |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |access-date=October 7, 2019 }}</ref> Other approaches to cultural studies, such as [[feminist]] cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book ''Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman'' (by Paul du Gay ''et al.''),<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gX-kksNNdFIC|title=Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman|editor1-last=du Gay|editor1-first=Paul|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0-7619-5402-6|oclc=949857570|year=1997}}</ref> which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist, and art historian [[Griselda Pollock]] contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of [[art history]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. The writer [[Julia Kristeva]] is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical [[French feminism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780190221911/obo-9780190221911-0063.xml |title=Julia Kristeva |last=MacKenzie |first=Gina |date=August 21, 2018 |website=Oxford Bibliographies |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=September 29, 2019 }}</ref>

Petrakis and Kostis (2013) divide cultural background variables into two main groups:<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Petrakis|first1=Panagiotis|last2=Kostis|first2=Pantelis|date=2013-12-01|title=Economic growth and cultural change|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|volume=47|pages=147–57|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2013.02.011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

# The first group covers the variables that represent the "efficiency orientation" of the societies: performance orientation, [[future orientation]], assertiveness, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance.
# The second covers the variables that represent the "social orientation" of societies, i.e., the attitudes and lifestyles of their members. These variables include gender egalitarianism, institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism, and human orientation.
In 2016, a new approach to culture was suggested by [[Rein Raud]],<ref name="meaning-in-action">{{Cite book|title=Meaning in Action: Outline of an Integral Theory of Culture|last=Rein|first=Raud|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-5095-1124-2|oclc=944339574|date = 2016-08-29}}</ref> who defines culture as the sum of resources available to human beings for making sense of their world and proposes a two-tiered approach, combining the study of texts (all reified meanings in circulation) and cultural practices (all repeatable actions that involve the production, dissemination or transmission of purposes), thus making it possible to re-link anthropological and sociological study of culture with the tradition of textual theory.

== Protection of culture ==
There are a number of international agreements and national laws relating to the protection of culture and [[cultural heritage]]. [[UNESCO]] and its partner organizations such as [[Blue Shield International]] coordinate international protection and local implementation.<ref>Roger O’Keefe, Camille Péron, Tofig Musayev, Gianluca Ferrari "Protection of Cultural Property. Military Manual." UNESCO, 2016, p 73.</ref><ref>''UNESCO Director-General calls for stronger cooperation for heritage protection at the Blue Shield International General Assembly.'' UNESCO, 13 September 2017.</ref>
[[File:Blue Shield Fact Finding Mission Egypt.jpg|right|thumb|A fact finding mission by [[Blue Shield International]] in Egypt during the civil war in 2011 to protect the cultural assets there.]]
Basically, the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and the UNESCO Convention for the Protection of Cultural Diversity deal with the protection of culture. Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights deals with cultural heritage in two ways: it gives people the right to participate in cultural life on the one hand and the right to the protection of their contributions to cultural life on the other.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html|title=UNESCO Legal Instruments: Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict 1999}}</ref>

The protection of culture and cultural goods is increasingly taking up a large area nationally and internationally. Under international law, the [[UN]] and [[UNESCO]] try to set up and enforce rules for this. The aim is not to protect a person's property, but rather to preserve the cultural heritage of humanity, especially in the event of war and armed conflict. According to [[Karl von Habsburg]], President of Blue Shield International, the destruction of cultural assets is also part of psychological warfare. The target of the attack is the identity of the opponent, which is why symbolic cultural assets become a main target. It is also intended to affect the particularly sensitive cultural memory, the growing cultural diversity and the economic basis (such as tourism) of a state, region or municipality.<ref>Gerold Keusch "Kulturschutz in der Ära der Identitätskriege" In: Truppendienst - Magazin des Österreichischen Bundesheeres, 24 October 2018.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Karl von Habsburg auf Mission im Libanon|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.krone.at/1911689|url-status=|format=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=|year=|language=de|pages=|quote=}}</ref><ref>Corine Wegener, Marjan Otter: ''Cultural Property at War: Protecting Heritage during Armed Conflict.''
