Absinthe has played a notable role in the [[fine art]] movements of [[Impressionism]], [[Post-impressionism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Modernism]], [[Cubism]] and in the corresponding literary movements. The legendary drink has more recently appeared in movies, video, television, music, and contemporary literature. The modern absinthe revival has had a notable effect on its portrayal. It is often shown as an unnaturally glowing green liquid demonstrating the influence of contemporary marketing efforts.

Absinthe has a widely documented role in 19th-century visual art and was frequently the subject of many [[Genre works|genre paintings]] and [[still life]]s of the day.

*[[Manet|Édouard Manet]] began his career with ''[[The Absinthe Drinker (Manet painting)|The Absinthe Drinker]]'' (1858), oil on canvas<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artchive.com/artchive/M/manet.html |title=Édouard Manet |work=Artchive.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2009}} demonstrating that at least he was exposed to the drink and its effects.{{Original research inline|date=November 2009}}
*[[Edgar Degas]]' painting ''[[L'Absinthe]]'' (1876) portrayed grim absinthe drinkers in a cafe. Degas himself never called the painting "L'Absinthe"; it was either his art dealer or a later owner who gave it the name.  Years later, it set off a flurry in the London art world, and the grim realism of "L'Absinthe" (a theme popular with [[bohemian]] artists) was perceived by London art critics as a lesson against alcohol and the French in general. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}
*[[Paul Verlaine]] was addicted to absinthe in his last (alcoholic) period. 
*[[Paul Gauguin]] is known for consuming large quantities of absinthe,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and his bold use of flat color has also been attributed to its influence.<ref>[https://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/352/12/1275 NEJM - Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref>{{Dubious|date=November 2009}}

==Literature==

===Classic literature===
As prominent as absinthe's influence on visual art was, it is perhaps even more noteworthy in the context of 19th-century literature. Below is a short list of important authors who credited a portion of their literary success to the drink.

*[[Baudelaire]] was an avid absinthe drinker. Though he never wrote specifically about absinthe he did reference it in his famous poem "Get Drunk".<ref>[http://www.absintheliquor.com/famous_absinthe_citats.htm Absintheliquor.com]</ref>
*[[Guy de Maupassant]] was a naturalistic French author. He is generally considered one of the greatest French short story writers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.online-literature.com/maupassant/ |title=Guy de Maupassant - Biography and Works |work=Online-literature.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref> In one famous work of prose, "A Queer Night in Paris", he describes the smells and sensations of absinthe in the streets of Paris and makes an overt reference to "the hour to take absinthe".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readprint.com/work-1178/Guy-de-Maupassant |title=A Queer Night in Paris by Guy de Maupassant |publisher=Read Print |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref>
*[[Ernest Dowson]] was an important English poet who notably wrote a poem dedicated to absinthe called "Absinthia Taetra".
*[[Ernest Hemingway]] features absinthe in the [[short story]] "[[Hills Like White Elephants]]" (1927), and in ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1940), disappointed with the quality of other liquor available, Robert Jordan turns to absinthe while fighting with the loyalist guerrillas. Hemingway himself was a frequent absinthe drinker and most likely procured his absinthe from Spain and [[Cuba]] after the ban.<ref>[[Barnaby Conrad III|Conrad III, Barnaby]]; (1988). ''Absinthe History in a Bottle. ''Chronicle books. {{ISBN|0-8118-1650-8}} p. 137.</ref>
*[[Alfred Jarry]] is notably the author of the French absurdist play, ''Ubu Roi.'' Jarry claimed to use absinthe to "fuse together the dream and reality, art and lifestyle".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> The drink was purported by the author to be a key part of his creative process.
*[[Arthur Rimbaud]] was a young Parisian poet who was notably involved in a homosexual relationship with Paul Verlaine; they famously drank large quantities of absinthe together. Their relationship ended when Rimbaud was shot in the hand by Verlaine, who was then sentenced to prison. Later in life Rimbaud quit drinking absinthe and writing poetry and instead became involved in military exploits and [[gun running]]. He is still regarded as one of France's greatest poets.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
*[[Paul Marie Verlaine]] was a famous Parisian poet of the Bohemian style. Though he wrote extensively about the benefits of absinthe in his early years, he later claimed to have consorted with prostitutes and men while drinking it, and blamed the beverage for his downfalls. Even when he was on his deathbed, his friends were said to be hiding bottles for him under his pillow.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.zoomgraphics.com/absinthe/drinkers.html |title=Zoomgraphics Absinthe Page |work=Zoomgraphics.com |accessdate=2010-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606074910/http://www.zoomgraphics.com/absinthe/drinkers.html |archivedate=2010-06-06 }}</ref>
*[[Oscar Wilde]] was an avid absinthe consumer {{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and often wrote about the drink in connection with the creative process.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  Wilde has been quoted as saying, "What difference is there between a glass of absinthe and a sunset?"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxygenee.com/absintheFAQ4.html |title=Oxygénée's Absinthe FAQ IV |work=Oxygenee.com |accessdate=2010-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926210034/http://www.oxygenee.com/absintheFAQ4.html |archivedate=2010-09-26 }}</ref><ref>"Absinthe History in a bottle" [[Barnaby Conrad III]] (1988)</ref> and "After the first glass [of absinthe] you see things as you wish they were.

===Contemporary literature ===

*[[Dennis Wheatley]] included an absinthe session in his novel about the outbreak of the [[World War I|Great War]] in 1914, ''The Second Seal'' (1950). Wheatley was a wine merchant for many years, with a wide stock of spirits and liqueurs as well, and always put much information on the subject in his books. His hero the [[Duke de Richleau]] has been sent by British Intelligence on a mission to Vienna. He has to foil a plot by the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] to disturb the peace of Europe, and so of course must concentrate his thoughts:

<blockquote>  Instinctively he walked back across the Ring to Sachers. There he went up to his room, sat on his bed for a while, then rang for the waiter and ordered a double Absinthe. When it arrived, he added sugar and water and slowly drank the opal fluid. It had no more perceptible kick in it than lime juice, or a diluted [[paregoric]] cough mixture which it resembled in flavour, but he knew it had hidden properties which would act like a drug in clearing and accelerating his brain.  </blockquote>
