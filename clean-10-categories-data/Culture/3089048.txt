'''Bhatkal''', is a [[town]] in the [[Uttara Kannada District]] of the Indian state of [[Karnataka]]. Bhatkal lies on [[National Highway 66 (India)|National Highway 66]], which runs between [[Mumbai]] and [[Kanyakumari]], and has one of the major [[railway station]]s along the [[Konkan Railway]] line, which runs between [[Mumbai]] and [[Mangaluru|Mangalore]]. This place is sometimes referred to as Mini Dubai.{{why|date=July 2020}} This place is also known as "Al Nawayath

==History==
In its early days, Bhatkal was mainly inhabited by the followers of [[Jain]] and [[Hindu]] religions, but gradually people from other religions and cultures began to settle there. Bhatkal was named after Jain Grammarian, Bhattakalanka, who hailed from Hadwalli village, a town on the state highway toward [[Jog Falls]]. With [[Sharavathi]] river flowing a few miles to the north, the town is located along the shores of the [[Arabian Sea]]. Because of its strategic location, Bhatkal was the main factor behind the erratic history of the countryside. Bhatkal witnessed the rise and fall of several dynasties and rulers. It was a part of the [[Hoysala Empire]], from 1291 to 1343, before falling into the hands of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]. After the disintegration of the latter, the much-coveted town of Bhatkal came under the control of the [[Saluva dynasty|Saluva]] (Jain) rulers based in Hadwalli.

Numerous temples and bases were constructed during the reign of the [[Saluva dynasty]]. Vestiges of this period can be found in Mudbhatkal, where a few temples are still standing as a testament to the magnificence of that era. The [[Nawayath|Nawayaths]] arrived on the West Coast of India from countries including [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Yemen]], [[Jordan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Oman]], [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Morocco]], as traders of spices, leather, jewelry and [[Arabian horse|Arabian horses]]. They chose to settle there and married into another trading community of India, the Jains, who had been converted to Islam more than 1,000 years before. This led to the emergence of a new community. The people belonging to this community were characterized by facial features typical of Arabs and the fair skin of the Jains. 

[[Chola]] emperors under [[Aditya I]], his son, [[Parantaka I]], and [[Sundara Chola]], also known as [[Parantaka Chola II]], initially invaded and conquered territories in [[Kannada]] country, between Gangavadi on the [[Mysuru]] plateau and Bhatkal on the Sahyadri Coast, between 880 CE and 975 CE. They later built the [[Solesvara]] Temple to commemorate their victory over the region.

The Portuguese marked their presence in Bhatkal in the beginning of the 16th century. [[Krishnadevaraya]], emperor of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], allowed them to build a fort in the town in 1510.<ref name="sen2">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=109}}</ref>  From the Keladi rulers, Bhatkal passed on to [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]]. Hyder Ali made Bhatkal the main base on the Canara Coast for his newly built [[Naval Force]]. Tipu Sultan made Bhatkal an important port and built a Mosque and a street named after him. One of Tipu's wives was from Bhatkal. Bhatkal later came into the hands of the [[British Empire in India|British Empire]] in 1799 after his death, who died in a battle against the British.
