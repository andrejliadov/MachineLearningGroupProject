'''Lucius Aelius Caesar''' (January 13, 101 – January 1, 138) was the father of Emperor [[Lucius Verus]]. In 136, he was adopted by [[Hadrian]] and named [[Caesar (title)|heir to the throne]]. He died before Hadrian and thus never became emperor.  After Lucius' death, he was replaced by [[Antoninus Pius]], who succeeded Hadrian the same year.

Aelius was born with the name '''Lucius Ceionius Commodus''', and became '''Lucius Aelius Caesar''' upon his adoption as Hadrian's heir. He is often sometimes referred to as '''Lucius Aelius Verus''', though this name is  not attested outside the [[Augustan History]] and probably the result of a manuscript error. The young Lucius Ceionius Commodus was of the [[gens]] [[Ceionia gens|Ceionia]]. His father, also named [[Lucius Ceionius Commodus (consul 106)|Lucius Ceionius Commodus]] (the  author of the [[Augustan History]] adds the cognomen Verus), was consul in 106, and his paternal grandfather, also of the same name, was consul in 78. His paternal ancestors were from [[Etruria]], and were of consular rank. His mother was a surmised but otherwise undocumented Roman woman named [[Ignota Plautia]].<ref>[[Ronald Syme]], "Antonine Relatives: Ceionii and Vettulani", ''Athenaeum'', 35 (1957), pp. 306–315</ref> The [[Augustan History]] states that his maternal grandfather and his maternal ancestors were of consular rank.

Before 130, the younger Lucius Commodus married [[Avidia Plautia]], a well-connected Roman noblewoman who was the daughter of the senator [[Gaius Avidius Nigrinus]]. Plautia bore Lucius two sons and two daughters, who were: 
*[[Lucius Verus|Lucius Ceionius Commodus the Younger]] – He would become Lucius Verus Caesar, and would co-rule as [[Roman Emperor]] with [[Marcus Aurelius]] from 161 until his own death in 169. Verus would marry [[Lucilla]], the second daughter of Marcus Aurelius and [[Faustina the Younger]].
* Gaius Avidius Ceionius Commodus – he is known from an inscription found in Rome.
* [[Ceionia Fabia]] – at the time of Marcus Aurelius's adoption, she was betrothed, as part of the adoption conditions, to him. Shortly after [[Antoninus Pius]]' ascension, Pius came to Aurelius and asked him to end his engagement to Fabia, instead marrying Antoninus Pius’ daughter [[Faustina the Younger]]; Faustina had originally been planned by Hadrian to wed Lucius Verus.
* [[Ceionia Plautia]]

==Heir to Hadrian==
[[File:Bust Hadrian Musei Capitolini MC817.jpg|thumb|Bust of Hadrian, [[Musei Capitolini]]]]
For a long time, the emperor [[Hadrian]] had considered his brother-in-law [[Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus]] as his unofficial successor. As Hadrian's reign drew to a close, however, he changed his mind. Although the emperor certainly thought Servianus capable of ruling as an emperor after Hadrian's own death, Servianus, by now in his nineties, was clearly too old for the position.  Hadrian's attentions turned to Servianus' grandson, [[Lucius Pedanius Fuscus Salinator]]. Hadrian promoted the young Salinator, his great-nephew, gave him special status in his court, and groomed him as his heir.

However, in late 136, Hadrian almost died from a haemorrhage. Convalescent in [[Hadrian's Villa|his villa]] at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]], he decided to change his mind, and selected Lucius Ceionius Commodus as his new successor, [[Adoption in Ancient Rome|adopting]] him as his son.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 41–42.</ref> The selection was done ''invitis omnibus'', "against the wishes of everyone";<ref>''HA Hadrian'' 23.10, qtd. in Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 42.</ref> in particular, Servianus and the young Salinator became very angry at Hadrian and wished to challenge him over the adoption. Even today, the rationale for Hadrian's sudden switch is still unclear.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 42. On the succession to Hadrian, see also: T.D. Barnes, "Hadrian and Lucius Verus", ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 57:1–2 (1967): 65–79; J. VanderLeest, "Hadrian, Lucius Verus, and the Arco di Portogallo", ''Phoenix'' 49:4 (1995): 319–30.</ref> It is possible Salinator went so far as to attempt a coup against Hadrian in which Servianus was implicated.  In order to avoid any potential conflict in the succession, Hadrian ordered the deaths of Salinator and Servianus.<ref>Anthony Birley, Hadrian the Restless Emperor, pp. 291–292.</ref>

Although Lucius had no military experience, he had served as a [[Roman Senator|senator]], and had powerful political connections; however, he was in poor health. As part of his adoption, Lucius Ceionius Commodus took the name Lucius Aelius Caesar.

==Death==
After a year's stationing on the Danube frontier, Aelius returned to Rome to make an address to the senate on the first day of 138. The night before the speech, however, he grew ill, and died of a haemorrhage late the next day.<ref>''HA Hadrian'' 23.15–16; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 45; "Hadrian to the Antonines", 148.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Commodus was a known consumptive at the time of his adoption, so Hadrian may have intended the eventual post-Antoninus succession, anyway.<ref>Dio 69.17.1; ''HA Aelius'' 3.7, 4.6, 6.1–7; Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", 147.</ref>|group=notes}} On 24 January 138, Hadrian selected [[Antoninus Pius|Aurelius Antoninus]] (September 19, 86 – March 7, 161) as his new successor.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 46. Date: Birley, "Hadrian to the Antonines", 148.</ref>

After a few days' consideration, Antoninus accepted. He was adopted on 25 February. As part of Hadrian's terms, Antoninus adopted both Lucius Aelius's son (properly called Lucius Ceionius Commodus the Younger) and Hadrian's great-nephew by marriage, [[Marcus Aurelius]] (April 26, 121 – March 17, 180). Marcus became M. Aelius Aurelius Verus; Lucius became L. Aelius Aurelius Commodus.{{#tag:ref|The younger Lucius Commodus did not take the cognomen Verus until his joint accession with Marcus after the death of Pius.|group=notes}} At Hadrian's request, Antoninus' daughter Faustina was betrothed to Lucius.<ref>Dio 69.21.1; ''HA Hadrian'' 24.1; ''HA Aelius'' 6.9; ''HA Antoninus Pius'' 4.6–7; Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 48–49.</ref>

Marcus Aurelius later co-ruled with Lucius Verus as joint Roman Emperors, until Lucius Verus died in 169, after which Aurelius was sole ruler until his own death in 180.

== Sources ==
The major sources for the life of Aelius are patchy and frequently unreliable. The most important group of sources, the biographies contained in the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'', claim to be written by a group of authors at the turn of the 4th century, but are in fact written by a single author (referred to here as "the biographer") from the later 4th century (c. 395).<ref name="Birley, 1889">Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 229–30. The thesis of single authorship was first proposed in H. Dessau's "Über Zeit und Persönlichkeit der ''Scriptoes Historiae Augustae''" (in German), ''Hermes'' 24 (1889), 337ff.</ref>

The later biographies and the biographies of subordinate emperors and usurpers are a tissue of lies and fiction, but the earlier biographies, derived primarily from now-lost earlier sources ([[Marius Maximus]] or Ignotus), are much more accurate.<ref name="Birley, 1889"/> For Aelius, the biographies of [[Hadrian]], Antoninus Pius, Marcus and Lucius Verus are largely reliable, but that of Avidius Cassius, and even Lucius Aelius' own, is full of fiction.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 230. On the ''HA Verus'', see Barnes, 65–74.</ref>

Some other literary sources provide specific detail: the writings of the physician [[Galen]] on the habits of the Antonine elite, the orations of [[Aelius Aristides]] on the temper of the times, and the constitutions preserved in the ''Digest'' and ''Codex Justinianus'' on Marcus' legal work.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 227–28.</ref> [[Epigraphy|Inscriptions]] and [[numismatics|coin finds]] supplement the literary sources.<ref>Birley, ''Marcus Aurelius'', 228.</ref>
