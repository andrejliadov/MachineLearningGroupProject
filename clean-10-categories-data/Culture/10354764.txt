'''The 2010 Imperative''' is an initiative issued by [[Architecture 2030]] that proposed [[ecology|ecological literacy]], largely missing from the curriculum in the United States, would
become a key element of design education by 2010, in order to combat [[global warming]] and world [[resource depletion]].

==The initiative==
The 2010 Imperative called for the following:
* Beginning in 2007, educators should add to all design studio problems the following requirement:
"Solutions to design problems must engage the environment in a way that dramatically reduces or eliminates the need for [[fossil fuel]]."
* By 2010, all academic design curricula shall achieve complete ecological literacy in design education, including the following areas of study:
: design / studio
: history / theory
: materials / technology
: structures / construction
: professional practice / ethics
* By 2010, all design school campuses shall achieve a [[carbon-neutral footprint]].

This may be accomplished by implementing innovative sustainable design strategies, generating on-site renewable power and/or purchasing a maximum of 20% renewable energy and/or certified renewable energy credits (RECs, [[Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)|Green tags]]).
