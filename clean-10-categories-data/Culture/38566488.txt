Some trademark signatures may have started as [[in-joke]]s, but have then come to have been recognised by a wider audience.

Sometimes, when a celebrity stops using a trademark look, people might even find it hard to recognise them.<ref>[http://uk.eonline.com/news/416739/zooey-deschanel-ditches-trademark-bangs-looks-unrecognizable E Online "Zooey Deschanel Ditches Trademark Bangs, Looks Unrecognizable"] retrieved 2014-01-15</ref>

The term trademark look (or anything similar) is not used in [[trademark]] law and a trademark look is not necessarily trademark protected in itself.
