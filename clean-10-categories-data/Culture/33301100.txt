'''Cultural radicalism''' (Danish: ''Kulturradikalisme'') was a movement in first [[Denmark|Danish]], but later also [[Norway|Norwegian]] culture. It was particular strong in the [[Interwar Period]], but its philosophy has its origin in the 1870s and a great deal of modern social commentary still refer to it.

At the time of the height of the cultural radical movement it was referred to as modern. The words cultural radical and cultural radicalism was first used in an essay by Elias Bredsdorff in the [[broadsheet newspaper]], ''[[Politiken]]'', in 1956. Bredsdorff described cultural radicals as people who are socially responsible with an international outlook.

Cultural radicalism has usually been described as the heritage of [[Georg Brandes]]'s [[Modern Breakthrough]], the foundation and early editorials of the newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'', the foundation of the political party ''[[Radikale Venstre]]'', to the magazine ''[[Kritisk Revy]]'' by [[Poul Henningsen|Poul Henningsen (PH)]]. By opponents of cultural radicalism though, it often simply refers to the liberal intellectual elite.

The values most commonly associated with cultural radicalism are among others: [[criticism of religion]], opposition to [[social norms]], criticism of [[Victorian morality|Victorian sexual morality]], [[anti-militarism]] and an openness to new cultural input other than the classic western (e.g. [[jazz]], modern architecture, art, literature and theater).

==Internationally==
''Cultural radicalism'' is also used outside of Denmark. In Scandinavia, it often refers to the Danish movement, but elsewhere, the concept may just share the etymology. In [[Sweden]], cultural radicalism has been seen as opposition to the Swedish church and to the [[Neo-Victorian]] sexual moral. In [[Norway]] the movement has been associated with the magazine [[Mot Dag]] in 1930s and its authors such as [[Sigurd Hoel]] and [[Arnulf Øverland]]. In the US, ''cultural radicalism'' is sometimes used as the opposite of [[cultural conservatism]], especially in the context of [[culture wars]].
