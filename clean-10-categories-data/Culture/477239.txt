The '''burning bush''' is an object described by the [[Book of Exodus]]{{bibleref2c-nb|Exodus|3:1–4:17}} as being located on [[Mount Horeb]]. According to the narrative, the bush was on fire, but was not consumed by the flames, hence the name.<ref name="bibleverse||Exodus|3:2">{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:4|}}</ref> In the biblical narrative, the burning bush is the location at which [[Moses]] was appointed by [[God]] to lead the [[Israelites]] out of [[Egypt]] and into [[Canaan]].

The Hebrew word in the narrative that is translated into English as ''bush'' is ''seneh'' ({{Hebrew|סנה}} {{IPAc-he|s|ə|n|e|h}}), which refers in particular to [[bramble]]s;<ref>Cheyne and Black (1899), ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''</ref><ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia">''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref><ref>''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''</ref> ''seneh'' is a biblical [[hapax legomenon|dis legomenon]], only appearing in two places, both of which describe the burning bush.<ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia" /> It is possible that the reference to a burning bush is based on a mistaken interpretation of ''[[Biblical Mount Sinai|Sinai]]'' ({{Hebrew|סיני}} {{IPAc-he|S|î|n|a|y}}), a mountain described in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 19:18 as being on fire.<ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia" /><ref>Cheyne and Black, ''Encyclopedia Biblica''</ref> Another possibility is that the use of ''seneh'' ({{Hebrew|סנה}} {{IPAc-he|s|'|n|é}}) may be a deliberate pun on ''Sinai'' ({{Hebrew|סיני}}), a feature common in [[Hebrew]] texts.<ref name=FriedmanSources />

==Biblical narrative==
[[File:Bouts moses.jpg|thumb|right|''Moses and the Burning Bush'', c. 1450–1475, attributed to [[Dieric Bouts]].]]

In the narrative, an [[angel of the Lord]] is described as appearing in a bush,<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:2|}}</ref> and God is subsequently described as calling out from it to Moses, who had been grazing [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]'s flocks there.<ref name="bibleverse||Exodus|3:2" /> When Moses starts to approach, God tells Moses to take off his sandals first, due to the place being holy ground,<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:5|}}</ref> and Moses hides his face.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:6|}}</ref> Some [[Old Testament]] scholars regard the account of the burning bush as being spliced together from the [[Yahwist]] and [[Elohist]] texts, with the Angel of Yahweh and the removal of sandals being part of the Yahwist version, and the Elohist's parallels to these being God and the turning away of Moses's face, respectively.<ref name="FriedmanSources">{{cite book |last1=Friedman |first1=Richard Elliott |title=The Bible with Sources Revealed |publisher=HarperOne |isbn=978-0-06-073065-9}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Book of Exodus''</ref><ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible">''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref>

When challenged on his identity, Yahweh replies that he is the God of the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarchs]] – [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:16|}}</ref> – and that he is ''[[Yahweh]]''.<ref name="bibleverse||Exodus|3:14">{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:14|}}</ref> The text [[etymology|derives]] ''Yahweh'' ({{Hebrew|יהוה}}) from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''[[hayah]]'' ({{hebrew|היה}} {{IPAc-he|h|a|'|y|a}}) in the phrase ''ehyeh ašer ehyeh'', meaning "he who is he", or "[[I am that I am]]".<ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible" />

The text portrays Yahweh as telling Moses that he is sending him to the [[Pharaoh]] in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt, an action that Yahweh is described as having decided upon as a result of noticing that the Israelites were being oppressed by the Egyptians.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:7|}}</ref> Yahweh tells Moses to tell the ''elders'' of the Israelites that Yahweh would lead them into the land of the [[Canaan]]ites, [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]]s, [[Amorite]]s, [[Hivite]]s, and [[Jebusite]]s,<ref name="bibleverse||Exodus|3:17">{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:17|}}</ref> a region generally referred to as a whole by the term ''Canaan''; this is described as being a land of "milk and honey".<ref name="bibleverse||Exodus|3:17"/>

According to the narrative Yahweh instructs Moses to confront the Egyptians and Israelites and briefs the prophet on what is to take place.  Yahweh then performs various demonstrative miracles in order to bolster Moses's credibility. Among other things, [[Staff of Moses|his staff]] was transmuted into a snake,<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|4:2-4|}}</ref> Moses's hand was temporarily made [[leprosy|leprous]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|4:6-7|}}</ref> and water was transmuted into blood.<ref name="bibleverse||Exodus|4:9">{{bibleverse||Exodus|4:9|}}</ref> In the text, Yahweh instructs Moses to take "this staff" in his hands, in order to perform miracles with it,<ref name="bibleverse||Exodus|4:9"/> as if it is a staff given to him, rather than his own;<ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible" /> some textual scholars propose that this latter instruction is the Elohist's version of the more detailed earlier description, where Moses uses his own staff, which they attribute to the Yahwist.<ref name="ReferenceA" /><ref name="Peake's commentary on the Bible" />

Despite the signs, Moses is described as being very reluctant to take on the role, arguing that he lacked eloquence, and that someone else should be sent instead;<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|4:10-13|}}</ref> in the text, Yahweh reacts by angrily rebuking Moses for presuming to lecture the One who made the mouth on who was qualified to speak and not to speak. Yet Yahweh concedes and allows [[Aaron]] to be sent to assist Moses, since Aaron is eloquent and was already on his way to meet Moses.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|4:14|}}</ref> This is the first time in the Torah that Aaron is mentioned, and here he is described as being Moses's mouthpiece.<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|4:15-16|}}</ref>

They conclude, however, that ''Dictamnus'' spp. is not found in the Sinai peninsula, adding:  "It is, therefore, highly improbable that any ''Dictamnus'' spp. was a true 'Burning Bush' despite such an attractive rational foundation."

[[Colin Humphreys]] replies that "the book of Exodus suggests a long-lasting fire that Moses went to investigate, not a fire that flares up and then rapidly goes out."<ref>{{cite book|last=Humphreys|first=Colin|title=Miracles of Exodus|year=2006|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|author-link=Colin Humphreys|page=73}}</ref>

==Location==
[[File:Burning Bush, St Catherine's Monastery.jpg|thumb|right|The bush at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which monastic tradition identifies as being ''the'' burning bush.]]
Christian [[hermit]]s originally gathered at [[Mount Serbal]], believing it to be the [[biblical Mount Sinai]]. However, in the 4th century, under the [[Byzantine Empire]], the monastery built there was abandoned in favour of the newer belief that [[Mount Saint Catherine]] was the Biblical Mount Sinai; a new monastery – [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] – was built at its foot, and the alleged site of the biblical burning bush was identified. The bush growing at the spot (a bramble, scientific name ''[[Rubus sanctus]]''),<ref>[http://www.paracompusa.com/SmartScience/Popa/Vol4-5.html Popa's Tales: The Burning Bush<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009211705/http://www.paracompusa.com/SmartScience/Popa/Vol4-5.html |date=9 October 2007 }}</ref> was later transplanted several yards away to a courtyard of the monastery, and its original spot was covered by a chapel dedicated to the [[Annunciation]], with a silver star marking where the roots of the bush had come out of the ground. The Monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery, following [[Sacred Tradition|church tradition]], believe that this bush is, in fact, the original bush seen by Moses, rather than a later replacement,{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} and anyone entering the chapel is required to remove their shoes, just as Moses was said to have done so in the biblical account.

However, in modern times, it is not Mount Saint Catherine, but the adjacent Jebel Musa (''Mount Moses''), which is currently identified as [[Mount Sinai]] by popular tradition and guidebooks; this identification arose from [[Bedouin]] tradition.

Mount Serbal, Mount Sinai, and Mount Saint Catherine, all lie at the southern tip of the [[Sinai peninsula]], but the peninsula's name is a comparatively modern invention, and it was not known by that name at the time of [[Josephus]] or earlier. Some modern scholars and theologians, favor locations in the [[Hijaz]] (at the north west of [[Saudi Arabia]]), northern [[Arabah]] (in the vicinity of [[Petra]], or the surrounding area), or occasionally in the central or northern Sinai Peninsula. Hence, the majority of academics and theologians agree that if the burning bush ever existed, then it is highly unlikely to be the bush preserved at St Catherine's Monastery.

== Interpretations from Eastern Orthodoxy ==
[[File:Neopalimaya kupina.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Traditional [[icon]] of Our Lady of the Burning Bush (''Neopalimaya Kupina'').]]
[[File:Krzewgorejący.JPG|thumb|left|The Icon of the Theotokos "Burning Bush" of the [[Old Testament]]. 19th century, [[Polissya]], [[Ukraine]].

Radomysl Castle-Museum on the Royal Road Via Regia". — Kyiv, 2013 {{ISBN|978-617-7031-15-3}}</ref>]]
In [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] a tradition exists, originating in the Orthodox [[Fathers of the Church]] and its [[Ecumenical council#The first seven ecumenical councils|Ecumenical Synods (or Councils)]], that the flame Moses saw was in fact God's [[Essence-Energies distinction|''Uncreated Energies''/''Glory'']], manifested as light, thus explaining why the bush was not consumed. Hence, it is not interpreted as a miracle in the sense of an event, which only temporarily exists, but is instead viewed as Moses being permitted to see these ''Uncreated Energies''/''Glory'', which are considered to be eternal things; the Orthodox [[soteriology|definition of salvation]] is this vision of the ''Uncreated Energies''/''Glory'', and it is a recurring theme in the works of Greek Orthodox theologians such as [[John S. Romanides]].

In Eastern Orthodox [[parlance]], the preferred name for the event is ''The Unburnt Bush'', and the theology and hymnography of the church view it as prefiguring the [[virgin birth of Jesus]]; Eastern Orthodox theology refers to [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]] as the ''[[Theotokos]]'' ("God bearer"), viewing her as having given birth to [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnate God]] without suffering any harm, or loss of [[virginity]], in parallel to the bush being burnt without being consumed.<ref>''The Octoechos'', Volume II (St. John of Kronstadt Press, Liberty, TN, 1999), [[Dogmaticon]], Tone II</ref> There is an [[Icon]] by the name of ''the Unburnt Bush'', which portrays Mary in the guise of ''God bearer''; the icon's [[feast day]] is held on 4 September ({{lang-ru|Неопалимая Купина|translit=Neopalimaya Kupina}}).

While God speaks to Moses, in the narrative, Eastern Orthodoxy believes that the angel was also heard by Moses; Eastern orthodoxy interprets the angel as being the [[Jesus the Logos|Logos of God]], regarding it as the ''Angel of Great Counsel'' mentioned in the [[Septuagint]] version of [[Isaiah 9]]:6;<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|9:6|}} (LXX)</ref> (it is ''Counsellor, Mighty God'' in the [[masoretic text]]).

==Symbolism==
The symbolic meaning of the burning bush has been emphasized in [[Christianity]], especially among participants in the [[Reformed tradition]] of [[Protestantism]]. [[Judaism]] also attaches symbolism to it.

===Reformed tradition===
[[File:CofSBurningBushLogo.JPG|thumb|200px|The emblem of the [[Church of Scotland]], above the entrance to the [[Church of Scotland Offices|Church Offices]] in [[Edinburgh]]|alt=An oval-shaped emblem depicting the burnish bush, set in front of Saint Andrew's cross.]]

The burning bush has been a popular symbol among [[Reformed]] churches since it was first adopted by the [[Huguenots]] ([[France|French]] [[Calvinists]]) in 1583 during its 12th National [[Synod]]. The French motto ''Flagror non consumor'' – "I am burned but not consumed" – suggests the symbolism was understood of the suffering church that nevertheless lives.<ref>https://reformationstudybible.com/about/the-symbol-of-the-burning-bush-in-church-history</ref> However, given the fire is a sign of God's presence, he who is a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:29) the miracle appears to point to a greater miracle: God, in grace, is with his covenant people and so they are not consumed.

* The current symbol of the [[Reformed Church of France]] is a burning bush with the [[Huguenot cross]].
* The motto of the [[Church of Scotland]] is ''Nec tamen consumebatur'', [[Latin (language)|Latin]] for "Yet it was not consumed", an allusion to the biblical description of the burning bush, and a stylised depiction of the burning bush is used as the Church's symbol. Usage dates from the 1690s.
* The burning bush is also used as the basis of the symbol of the [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland]], which uses the Latin motto ''Ardens sed virens'', meaning "Burning but flourishing", and is based on the biblical description of the burning bush. The same logo is used from the separated [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]].
* The burning bush is also the symbol of the [[Presbyterian Church in Canada]], [[Presbyterian Church of Australia|Presbyterian Church in Australia crest]], [[Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia]] with the motto in English since its foundation in 1846: 'And the Bush was not consumed', [[Presbyterian Church in New Zealand]], [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]], [[Presbyterian Church in Singapore]], [[Presbyterian Church of Brazil]], the [[Presbyterian Church in Malaysia]], the [[Free Reformed Churches of North America]],  and the [[Christian Reformed Churches]] in the Netherlands.

===Judaism===
The logo of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] is also an image of the burning bush with the phrase "and the bush was not consumed" in both English and in Hebrew.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jtsa.edu/ |title=The Jewish Theological Seminary - Home Page<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=9 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603044750/http://www.jtsa.edu/ |archive-date=3 June 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Islam ===
According to the Quran, Moses (''Musa'') [[Moses in Islam#Call to prophethood|departed for Egypt]] along with his family after completing the time period.

===Baháʼí Faith===
The [[Baháʼí Faith]] believes that the burning Bush was the voice of [[Baha'u'llah]].

===Rastafari===
The [[Rastafari]] believe that the burning bush was [[cannabis]].

=== Biblical entheogen hypothesis ===
Professor [[Benny Shanon]]'s controversial hypothesis speculates that the key event of the Old Testament might refer to a [[psychedelic experience]] with [[N,N-dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT). Some varieties of Acacia trees that grow in the holy land contain this substance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/06/religion.israelandthepalestinians |title=Moses saw God 'because he was stoned – again' |last=Jeffay |first=Nathan |date=2008-03-06 |website=The Guardian |language=en |access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref> In his article ''Biblical Entheogens: a Speculative Hypothesis'', Shanon details parallels between the effects induced by the [[entheogen]]e DMT-containing brew [[ayahuasca]] and the [[Bible]]'s account of the life of Moses. Also [[Rick Strassman]], who studied the effects of DMT on human subjects in experimental conditions,<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Strassman |first=Rick J. |date=1994-02-01 |title=Dose-Response Study of N,N-Dimethyltryptamine in Humans |url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/496494 |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |language=en |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=85 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1994.03950020009001 |issn=0003-990X |pmid=8297216}}</ref> suggests in his book ''DMT and the Soul of Prophecy: A New Science of Spiritual Revelation in the Hebrew Bible'' that DMT experiences may most closely resemble those visions found in the Hebrew Bible's model of prophecy.
