'''Classification chart'''  or '''classification tree''' is a synopsis of the [[classification scheme]],<ref>U. S. Department of the Army. ''The Writing of American Military History.'' U.S. Government Printing Office, 1956, p. 31.</ref> designed to illustrate the structure of any particular field.

== Overview == 
Classification is the process in which ideas and objects are recognized, differentiated, and understood, and classification charts are intended to help create and eventually visualized the outcome.

According to Brinton "in a classification chart the facts, data etc. are arranged so that the place of each in relation to all others is readily seen. Quantities need not be given, although a quantitative analysis adds to the value of a classification chart."<ref name="WCB 1939">[[Willard Cope Brinton]], ''Graphic presentation.'' 1939. p. 43</ref>

[[Karl G. Karsten|Karsten]] (1923) explained, that "in all chart-making, the material to be shown must be accurately compiled before it can be charted. For an understanding of the classification chart, we must delve somewhat into the mysteries of the classification and indexing. The art of classification calls into play the power of visualizing a 'whole' together with its 'parts'."<ref>[[Karsten, Karl G.]] ''[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006593135 Charts and graphs: An introduction to graphic methods in the control and analysis of statistics].'' Prentice-Hall, 1923, p. 13.</ref>

== Examples ==
Early examples of classification chart are:
* The illustrations of the [[Carl Linnaeus]]' 1735 classification of [[animals]] and his [[Linnaean taxonomy|classification]] of [[plant]]s in his ''Classes Plantarum'' 1738. 
* In 1752 [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Denis Diderot]] produced a [[figurative system of human knowledge]] produced for the ''[[Encyclopédie]].''
* [[Augustin Augier]]'s "Arbre Botanique" (1801)<ref name="JDA 2009">J. David Archibald (2009): [http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/faculty/archibald.html/Archibald09JHB42p561.pdf Edward Hitchcock’s Pre-Darwinian (1840) 'Tree of Life'], ''Journal of the History of Biology'' (2009) 42:561–592.</ref>
* In 1840 [[Edward Hitchcock]] inserted a paleontological chart in his ''Elementary Geology'' (1840).<ref name="JDA 2009"/> It shows a branching diagram of the plant and animal kingdom against a geological background.
* The tree of life image that appeared in Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]],'' 1859
Early classification chart are often visualized in a [[tree structure]]. Modern charts can also be presented in [[Table (information)|table]] or as an [[infographic]].

The term "classification chart" came into use in the 20th century. In his 1939 ''Graphic presentation.'' (first edition 1919) [[Willard Cope Brinton]] was one of the first to devoted a whole chapter on classification charts.<ref name="WCB 1939"/>
