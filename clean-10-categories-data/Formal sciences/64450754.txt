The '''Fréchet inception distance (FID)''' is a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] used to assess the quality of images created by the generator of a [[generative adversarial network]] (GAN).<ref name="fid">{{cite arxiv |last1=Heusel |first1=Martin |last2=Ramsauer |first2=Hubert |last3=Unterthiner |first3=Thomas |last4=Nessler |first4=Bernhard |last5=Hochreiter |first5=Sepp |title=GANs Trained by a Two Time-Scale Update Rule Converge to a Local Nash Equilibrium |date=12 January 2018 |class=cs.LG |eprint=1706.08500}}</ref>  Unlike the earlier [[inception score]] (IS), which evaluates only the distribution of generated images, the FID compares the distribution of generated images with the distribution of real images that were used to train the generator.<ref name="fid" /><ref name="neal">{{cite web |last1=Jean |first1=Neal |title=Fréchet Inception Distance |url=https://nealjean.com/ml/frechet-inception-distance/ |website=Neal Jean |accessdate=3 July 2020 |language=en |date=15 July 2018}}</ref>

The FID metric is the [[Fréchet distance]] between two [[multivariate normal distribution|multidimensional Gaussian distributions]]: <math>\mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)</math>, the distribution of the Inception v3 features of the images generated by the GAN and <math>\mathcal{N}(\mu_w,\Sigma_w)</math>, the distribution of the Inception v3 features from the "world" or real images used to train the GAN.  As a result, it can be computed from the mean and the [[covariance]] of the activations when the synthesized and real images are fed into the Inception network as:

: <math>\text{FID} = |\mu-\mu_w|^2 + \operatorname{tr}(\Sigma+\Sigma_w-2(\Sigma\Sigma_w)^{1/2}).</math>

Rather than directly comparing images pixel by pixel (for example, as done by the [[L2 norm]]), the FID compares the mean and standard deviation of one of the deeper layers in Inception v3, a [[Convolutional neural network]].  These layers are closer to output nodes that correspond to real-world objects such as a specific breed of dog or an airplane, and further from the shallow layers near the input image.  As a result, they tend to mimic human perception of similarity in images{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}.

The FID metric is the current standard metric for assessing the quality of GANs as of 2020.  It has been used to measure the quality of many recent GANs<ref name="neal" /> including the high-resolution StyleGAN1<ref name="stylegan1">{{cite journal |last1=Karras |first1=Tero |last2=Laine |first2=Samuli |last3=Aila |first3=Timo |title=A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |year=2020 |volume=PP |page=1 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.2020.2970919 |pmid=32012000 |arxiv=1812.04948}}</ref> and StyleGAN2<ref>{{cite arxiv |last1=Karras |first1=Tero |last2=Laine |first2=Samuli |last3=Aittala |first3=Miika |last4=Hellsten |first4=Janne |last5=Lehtinen |first5=Jaakko |last6=Aila |first6=Timo |title=Analyzing and Improving the Image Quality of StyleGAN |date=23 March 2020 |class=cs.CV |eprint=1912.04958}}</ref> networks

== History ==
The FID metric was introduced in 2017.<ref name="fid" />  It is inspired by the [[Fréchet distance]] introduced in 1957 by M. Frechet.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fréchet. |first1=M |title=Sur la distance de deux lois de probabilité. |journal=C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris |date=1957 |volume=244 |pages=689–692}}</ref>
