'''Computer graphics''' is a sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content.  Although the term often refers to the study of [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional computer graphics]], it also encompasses [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional graphics]] and [[image processing]].

== Overview ==
Computer graphics studies the manipulation of visual and geometric information using computational techniques.  It focuses on the ''mathematical'' and ''computational'' foundations of image generation and processing rather than purely [[aesthetic]] issues.  Computer graphics is often differentiated from the field of [[visualization (graphic)|visualization]], although the two fields have many similarities.

Connected studies include:
* [[Applied mathematics]]
* [[Computational geometry]]
* [[Computational topology]]
* [[Computer vision]]
* [[Image processing]]
* [[Information visualization]]
* [[Scientific visualization]]

Applications of computer graphics include:
*[[Print design]]
*[[Digital art]]
*[[Special effect]]s
*[[Video game]]s
*[[Visual effects]]

== History ==
{{See also|History of computer animation|Computer graphics#History}}

There are several international conferences and journals where the most significant results in computer graphics are published. Among them are the [[SIGGRAPH]] and [[Eurographics]] conferences and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) Transactions on Graphics journal. The joint Eurographics and [[ACM SIGGRAPH]] symposium series features the major venues for the more specialized sub-fields: Symposium on Geometry Processing,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.geometryprocessing.org |title = geometryprocessing.org |website = geometryprocessing.org |access-date=2014-05-01 }}</ref> Symposium on Rendering, Symposium on Computer Animation,<ref>[http://www.eg.org/events ] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070314004027/http://www.eg.org/events |date = March 14, 2007 }}</ref> and High Performance Graphics.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.highperformancegraphics.org |title = High Performance Graphics |website = highperformancegraphics.org }}</ref> 

As in the rest of computer science, conference publications in computer graphics are generally more significant than journal publications (and subsequently have lower acceptance rates).<ref name="cra memo">{{cite web |url = http://www.cra.org/reports/tenure_review.html |title=Best Practices Memo |website = Cra.org |access-date=2014-05-01 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140502002308/http://www.cra.org/reports/tenure_review.html |archive-date=2014-05-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="ernst note">{{cite web |url = http://people.csail.mit.edu/mernst/advice/conferences-vs-journals.html |title=Choosing a venue: conference or journal? |website = People.csail.mit.edu |access-date=2014-05-01}}</ref><ref name="graphics acceptance rates">{{cite web |url = http://vrlab.epfl.ch/~ulicny/statistics/ |title = Graphics/vision publications acceptance rates statistics |website = vrlab.epfl.ch |access-date=2014-05-01 }}</ref><ref>An extensive history of computer graphics can be found at [http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html this page] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070405172134/http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html |date=April 5, 2007 }}.</ref>

== Subfields ==
A broad classification of major subfields in computer graphics might be:
# [[Geometry]]: ways to represent and process surfaces
# [[Animation]]: ways to represent and manipulate motion
# [[Rendering (computer graphics)|Rendering]]: [[algorithm]]s to reproduce light transport
# [[Digital imaging|Imaging]]: image acquisition or image editing

=== Geometry ===
[[File:Stanford bunny qem.png|thumb|Successive approximations of a surface computed using quadric error metrics]]

The subfield of geometry studies the representation of three-dimensional objects in a discrete digital setting.  Because the appearance of an object depends largely on its exterior, [[boundary representation]]s are most commonly used.  Two dimensional [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s are a good representation for most objects, though they may be non-[[manifold]].  Since surfaces are not finite, discrete digital approximations are used. [[polygon mesh|Polygonal meshes]] (and to a lesser extent [[subdivision surfaces]]) are by far the most common representation, although point-based representations have become more popular recently (see for instance the Symposium on Point-Based Graphics).<ref>{{cite web |url = http://graphics.ethz.ch/events/pbg/07/ |title=Point Based Graphics 2007 - PBG07 |website = Graphics.ethz.ch |access-date=2014-05-01}}</ref> These representations are ''Lagrangian,'' meaning the spatial locations of the samples are independent.  Recently, ''Eulerian'' surface descriptions (i.e., where spatial samples are fixed) such as [[level set]]s have been developed into a useful representation for deforming surfaces which undergo many topological changes (with [[fluids]] being the most notable example).<ref name="stanford fedkiw">{{cite web |url = http://graphics.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/ |title = Ron Fedkiw |website = graphics.stanford.edu |access-date=2014-05-01 }}</ref>

; Geometry Subfields
* [[Implicit surface]] modeling – an older subfield which examines the use of algebraic surfaces, [[constructive solid geometry]], etc., for surface representation.
* Digital geometry processing – [[3d scanning|surface reconstruction]], simplification, fairing, mesh repair, [[mesh parameterization|parameterization]], remeshing, [[mesh generation]], surface compression, and surface editing all fall under this heading.<ref name="caltech multires dgp">[http://www.multires.caltech.edu/pubs/DGPCourse/ ] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070214021951/http://www.multires.caltech.edu/pubs/DGPCourse/ |date=February 14, 2007 }}</ref><ref name="uiuc graphics dgp">[http://graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/~garland/class/geometry/ CS 598: Digital Geometry Processing (Fall 2004)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20041025104252/http://graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/~garland/class/geometry/ |date=2004-10-25 }}</ref><ref name="ubc sheffa dgp">{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~sheffa/dgp/ |title=Digital Geometry Processing |website = cs.ubc.ca |access-date=2014-05-01}}</ref>
* Discrete differential geometry – a nascent field which defines geometric quantities for the discrete surfaces used in computer graphics.<ref name="columbia ddg">{{cite web |url = http://ddg.cs.columbia.edu/ |title=Discrete Differential Geometry |website = ddg.cs.columbia.edu |access-date=2014-05-01}}</ref>
* Point-based graphics – a recent field which focuses on points as the fundamental representation of surfaces.
* [[Subdivision surfaces]]
* Out-of-core mesh processing – another recent field which focuses on mesh datasets that do not fit in main memory.

=== Animation ===
The subfield of animation studies descriptions for surfaces (and other phenomena) that move or deform over time.  Historically, most work in this field has focused on parametric and data-driven models, but recently [[physical simulation]] has become more popular as computers have become more powerful computationally.

; Subfields
* [[Motion capture|Performance capture]]
* Character animation
* Physical simulation (e.g. [[cloth modeling]],  animation of [[fluid dynamics]], etc.)

=== Rendering ===
[[File:Cornellbox pathtracing irradiancecaching.png|thumb|Indirect diffuse scattering simulated using [[path tracing]] and [[irradiance]] [[Cache (computing)|caching]].]]

Rendering generates images from a model.  Rendering may simulate [[light transport theory|light transport]] to create realistic images or it may create images that have a particular artistic style in [[non-photorealistic rendering]].  The two basic operations in realistic rendering are transport (how much light passes from one place to another) and scattering (how surfaces interact with light).  See [[Rendering (computer graphics)]] for more information.

; Transport
[[light transport theory|Transport]] describes how illumination in a scene gets from one place to another. [[visibility (geometry)|Visibility]] is a major component of light transport.

; Scattering
Models of ''scattering'' and ''shading'' are used to describe the appearance of a surface.  In graphics these problems are often studied within the context of rendering since they can substantially affect the design of [[rendering algorithm]]s.  Shading can be broken down into two orthogonal issues, which are often studied independently:
# '''scattering''' – how light interacts with the surface ''at a given point''
# '''shading''' – how material properties vary across the surface

The former problem refers to [[scattering]], i.e., the relationship between incoming and outgoing illumination at a given point.  Descriptions of scattering are usually given in terms of a [[bidirectional scattering distribution function]] or BSDF.  The latter issue addresses how different types of scattering are distributed across the surface (i.e., which scattering function applies where).  Descriptions of this kind are typically expressed with a program called a [[shader]].  (Note that there is some confusion since the word "shader" is sometimes used for programs that describe local ''geometric'' variation.)

;Other subfields
* [[Non-photorealistic rendering]]
* [[Physically based rendering]] – concerned with generating images according to the laws of [[geometric optics]]
* [[Real-time rendering]] – focuses on rendering for interactive applications, typically using specialized hardware like [[graphics processing unit|GPUs]]
* [[Relighting]] – recent area concerned with quickly re-rendering scenes
