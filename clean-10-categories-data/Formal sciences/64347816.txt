Mathematics has been used in [[Nepal]] for measurement since ancient time. Advance mathematics was used primarily in the field of [[Astrology]] to predict position of planets to determine auspicious time for various [[Hindu]] rituals. In recent time, mathematics is taught formally in schools from primary level up to doctrate degree. All students must pass mathematics in the [[Secondary Education Examination (Nepal)|SEE exam]]. 

==History==
The history of mathematics in Nepal is inter-related with the history of mathematics in the Indian sub-continent. However, independent history of mathematics in Nepal also exists. The ancient [[Licchavi (kingdom)| Licchavi]] people developed a series of the system for measurement such as ''Kharika'' to measure land area and ''Kosh'' for measurement of distance. Similalry, [[Jayasthiti Malla]] during 1350 standardized ''Mana'' and ''Pathi'' for volumetric measurement of grains and cerials.<ref>History of Nepal. “Malla Kings,” July 11, 2010. https://www.historynepal.com/2010/07/malla-kings.html.</ref>

The numerials of [[Ranjana script]], was developed in 199 BC. It was used until the mid-20th century in Nepal and India. It is still in use in the [[Newar language|Newari]] language.<ref>Acharya, Eka Ratna. “Ranjana Numeral System: A Brief Information.” Journal of the Institute of Engineering 13, no. 1 (2017): 221–24. https://doi.org/10.3126/jie.v13i1.20370.

===Formal Education===
In the [[Rana dynasty|Rana Period]], Kashi  ([[Banaras]])  used to be the education hub to learn astrology and mathematics. The mathematics was based mainly on the text of Baskaracharya's  Siddhant Siromani. <ref name="KU2006">{{cite journal |last1=Jha |first1=K |last2=Adhikary |first2=PR |last3=Pant |first3=SR |title=A HISTORY OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES  IN NEPAL |journal=KATHMANDU UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY |date=2006}}</ref>

The formal education of mathematics in school started after overthrowing of Rana regime and start of democracy.

The M.A./M.Sc. in Mathematics started on July 14, 1959 and Central Department of Mathematics was formed on September 20, 1959 A.D. in Tripureshwor<ref>“Department of Mathematics :: Tribhuvan University.” Accessed June 22, 2020. https://www.cdmathtu.edu.np/index.php?linkId=9.</ref> Bengali mathematician  Prof.  Asutosh  Ganguli was the first head of  Department in  Master level mathematics courses at  Tri-Chandra  College. <ref name="KU2006"/>

==Notable figures in mathematics==
* [[Chakra Pani Aryal]] was the 15th Century's astrologer and mathematicians. He wrote Uttan Gadit (in Sanskrit) that was used for calculation of solar and lunar eclipses.  This book was revised by Padma Nav Keshari Aryal in 1934 A.D.<ref>Acharya, Eka Ratna. “Gopal Pande: The First Mathematician of Nepal.” ResearchGate.

* Pd. '''[[Gopal Pande]]''' (1883-1914) was the first person to write a book in Nepali about mathematics. He wrote four editions of his mathematics books in Nepali. The third edition was also published in  Hindi. He was honoured as the Royal Astrologer for successfully predicting the number of lunar eclipses in 1884.He was also responsible to make the plot of [[Tudikhel]]. <ref name="KU2006"/> 
* [[Noor  Dutta  Pande]] (second son of Gopal Pande)  wrote the Gorkha  Bijaganita.  He has composed the mathematics book called “Bichitra Ganita”. 
* Tikaram Dhananjaya (1909-1936) wrote the first full commentary of Lilavati of Bhaskaracharya in Nepali language and he wrote the book Shishubodha Tarangini along with his wife Chandrakala Dhananjaya.
*Chandra Kala Dhananjaya was the first women writer in mathematics. She wrote Shishu Bodhini Ragini Ganita in a form of poem that explained addition, multiplication and divisions.
* In 1890 the Rana  Prime minister  [[Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana| Chandra  Samser]] was the first  Nepali to pass the matriculation examination from the Calcutta  University with mathematics. 
*[[Naya Raj Pant]] (1913-2002) was the first person to graduate in Mathematics from [[Tribhuwan University]]. He also used his skill in astronomy to decide the historical events.<ref>“Remembering a Scholar Extraordinaire - MyRepublica - The New York Times Partner, Latest News of Nepal in English, Latest News Articles.” Accessed June 22, 2020. https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/remembering-a-scholar-extraordinaire/?categoryId=opinion.
