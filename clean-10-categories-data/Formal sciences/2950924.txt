An '''accession number''' in bioinformatics is a unique identifier given to a [[DNA sequence|DNA]] or [[amino acid sequence|protein]] sequence record to allow for tracking of different versions of that sequence record and the associated sequence over time in a single data repository.  Because of its relative stability, accession numbers can be utilized as [[foreign key]]s for referring to a sequence object, but not necessarily to a unique sequence.  All sequence information repositories implement the concept of "accession number" but might do so with subtle variations.

{{main|Locus Reference Genomic}}
Locus Reference Genomic (LRG) records have unique accession numbers starting with LRG_ followed by a number. They are recommended in the [http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/ Human Genome Variation Society Nomenclature guidelines] as stable genomic reference sequences to report sequence variants in LSDBs and the literature.
