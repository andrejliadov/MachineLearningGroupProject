The '''Classification of types of construction''' (CC), is a [[nomenclature]] for the classification of constructions (i.e. [[building]]s) according to their type. It is based on the [[Central Product Classification|CPC]] that was published by the [[United Nations]] in 1991. Its final version was approved in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=METADATA / Classification of Types of Constructions (1998)|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/nomenclatures/index.cfm?TargetUrl=LST_NOM_DTL&StrNom=CC_1998|accessdate=2017-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Classification_of_types_of_construction_(CC)|title=Glossary:Classification of types of construction (CC)|accessdate=2017-06-20}}</ref>

The decimal system classification - each type is qualified by a four-digit number - comprises:<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/documents/cc/publication/pdf/cc-en.zip</ref>
#2 Sections (1-digit) - Buildings, [[Civil engineering]] works
#6 Divisions (2-digit)
#20 Groups (3-digit)
#46 Classes (4-digit)

The CC is a "standard that must be taken into account in recording, collecting, processing, analysing, transmitting and disseminating data on construction works for statistical and record-keeping purposes" in various European countries and  [[Eurostat]].<ref>http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STAT-01-107_en.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CCâ€“SI - Classification of Types of Constructions|url=http://www.stat.si/StatWeb/en/Methods/Classifications|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stat.gov.pl/en/metainformations/classifications/#Polish%20Classification%20of%20Types%20of%20Constructions%20(PKOB)|title=Polish Classification of Types of Constructions (PKOB)|quote=The Polish Classification of Types of Constructions (PKOB) is a systematized list of construction objects which are the final products of construction activity. It was compiled based on the European Classification of Types of Construction (CC), which is in accordance with the UN recommendations.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/en/content/4497/%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8/building-permits-issued-construction-new-buildings|title=Building permits issued for construction of new buildings|publisher=REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA National statistical institute}}</ref>

The classification of types of construction should not be confused with the [[16 Divisions]] or [[50 Divisions]], which separates construction projects by specifications and trade.<ref>http://www.northstarcsi.com/technotes/tn9908-div17.htm</ref>
