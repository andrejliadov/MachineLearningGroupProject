'''Magic Quadrant''' (MQ) is a series of [[market research]] reports published by [[Information technology consulting|IT consulting firm]] [[Gartner]] that rely on proprietary [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] [[data analysis]] methods to demonstrate market trends, such as direction, maturity and participants.<ref name="How Gartner Evaluates">

==Rating==
Gartner rates vendors upon two criteria: ''completeness of [[vision statement|vision]]''<ref name="How Gartner Evaluates" /><ref name="How Gartner Evaluates2" /> and ''ability to execute''.<ref name="How Gartner Evaluates" /><ref name="How Gartner Evaluates2">
{{cite web | title=How Markets and Vendors Are Evaluated in Gartner Magic Quadrants | url=https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3956304/how-markets-and-vendors-are-evaluated-in-gartner-magic-q | publisher=Gartner.com | date=August 2019 | access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>

* Completeness of Vision: Reflects the vendor’s innovation, whether the vendor drives or follows the market, and if the vendor’s view of how the market will develop matches Gartner’s perspective.
* Ability to Execute: Summarizes factors such as the vendor’s financial viability, market responsiveness, product development, sales channels and customer base.

These component scores lead to a vendor position in one of four quadrants:
*Leaders – Vendors in the Leaders quadrant have the highest composite scores for their Completeness of Vision and Ability to Execute. A vendor in the Leaders quadrant has the market share, credibility, and marketing & sales capabilities needed to drive the acceptance of new technologies. These vendors demonstrate a clear understanding of market needs, they are innovators and thought leaders, and they have well-articulated plans that customers and prospects can use when designing their infrastructures and strategies. In addition, they have a presence in the five major geographical regions, consistent financial performance, and broad platform support.
*Challengers – A vendor in the Challengers quadrant participates in the market and executes well enough to be a serious threat to vendors in the Leaders quadrant. They have strong products, as well as sufficiently credible market position and resources to sustain continued growth. Financial viability is not an issue for vendors in the Challengers quadrant, but they lack the size and influence of vendors in the Leaders quadrant.
*Visionaries – A vendor in the Visionaries quadrant delivers innovative products that address operationally or financially important end-user problems at a broad scale, but has not yet demonstrated the ability to capture market share or sustainable profitability. Visionary vendors are frequently privately held companies and acquisition targets for larger, established companies. The likelihood of acquisition often reduces the risks associated with installing their systems.
*Niche Players – Vendors in the Niche Players quadrant are often narrowly focused on specific market or vertical segments. This quadrant may also include vendors that are adapting their existing products to enter the market under consideration, or larger vendors having difficulty developing and executing on their vision.

Gartner [[Critical Capabilities]] complement Magic Quadrant analysis to offer deeper insight into the products and services offered by multiple vendors.

==Criticism==
It has been pointed out{{by who?|date=November 2020}} that the criteria for the Magic Quadrant cater more towards [[investor]]s and large vendors than towards buyers.<ref>{{cite web | title=Looking beyond the magic quadrant to find the nitty-gritty | url=http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1660-Assessing-WCM-vendors | publisher=[[Real Story Group]] | date=2009-08-07 | access-date=2009-08-08}}</ref>

Much of the criticism is focused on the lack of disclosure of the money received from the vendors it rates, raising [[conflict of interest]] issues. Also a source of criticism is the lack of disclosure on the vendor's component scores and the lack of transparency in Gartner's methodology used to derive the vendor's position on the MQ map.

The Magic Quadrant, and analysts in general, also skew the market: according to research,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://analystrelations.org/2012/09/26/guest-post-why-it-vendors-should-take-industry-analysts-more-seriously |title=Why IT Vendors Should Take Industry Analysts (More) Seriously &#124; Institute of Industry Analyst Relations |publisher=Analystrelations.org |date=2012-09-26 |access-date=2015-02-24}}</ref> by applying their methodologies to describe a market, they change that marketplace to fit their tools.

Another criticism is that open source vendors are not considered sufficiently by analysts like Gartner, as has been published in an online discussion between a VP from [[Talend (business)|Talend]] and a German Research VP from Gartner.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vendor complains in a very public blog post about Gartner's Data Integration Magic Quadrant|url=http://sagecircle.wordpress.com/2008/12/29/vendor-complains-in-a-very-public-blog-post-about-gartners-data-integration-magic-quadrant/|publisher=Sagecircle.wordpress.com|date=2009-12-29|access-date=2009-08-08}}</ref>

Gartner was the target of a [[federal law]]suit (filed May 29, 2009) from software vendor, [[ZL Technologies]], challenging the “legitimacy” of Gartner’s Magic Quadrant rating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://analystrelations.org/2009/10/21/is-shooting-on-the-referee-productive/ |title=Is shooting on the referee productive? &#124; Institute of Industry Analyst Relations |publisher=Analystrelations.org |date=2009-10-21 |access-date=2015-02-24}}</ref> Gartner filed a motion to dismiss by claiming [[First Amendment]] protection since it contends that its MQ reports contain "pure opinion", which legally means opinions which are not based on fact.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/21393241/ZL-v-Gartner-Complaint |title=ZL v Gartner Complaint |publisher=Scribd.com |access-date=2015-02-24}}</ref> The court threw out the ZL case because it lacked a specific complaint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/continuity/features/article.php/3848461 |title=E-mail Archiving Vendor Takes on Gartner's Magic Quadrant |publisher=EnterpriseStorageForum.com |date=2009-11-13 |access-date=2015-02-24}}</ref> That decision was upheld on appeal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/memoranda/view.php?pk_id=0000007656 |title=Unpublished Dispositions (Memoranda) |publisher=Ca9.uscourts.gov |access-date=2015-02-24}}</ref>
