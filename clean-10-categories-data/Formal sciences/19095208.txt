'''[[Statistics]]''' is the theory and application of [[mathematics]] to the [[scientific method]] including hypothesis generation, [[experimental design]], [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]], [[data collection]], [[Summary statistics|data summarization]], [[Estimator|estimation]], [[prediction]] and [[statistical inference|inference]] from those results to the [[statistical population|population]] from which the experimental sample was drawn. This article lists [[statisticians]] who have been instrumental in the development of [[mathematical statistics|theoretical]] and [[applied statistics]].
