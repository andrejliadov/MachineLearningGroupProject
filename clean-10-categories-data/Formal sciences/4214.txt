'''Bioinformatics''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-bioinformatics.ogg|ˌ|b|aɪ|.|oʊ|ˌ|ɪ|n|f|ɚ|ˈ|m|æ|t|ɪ|k|s}} is an [[interdisciplinary]] field that develops methods and [[software tool]]s for understanding [[biology|biological]] data, in particular when the data sets are large and complex. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]] to analyze and interpret the [[Biological Data|biological data]]. Bioinformatics has been used for ''[[in silico]]'' analyses of biological queries using mathematical and statistical techniques.{{clarify|date=March 2020}}

Bioinformatics includes biological studies that use [[computer programming]] as part of their methodology, as well as a specific analysis "pipelines" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of [[genomics]]. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidates [[gene]]s and single [[nucleotide]] polymorphisms ([[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]]). Often, such identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organizational principles within [[nucleic acid]] and [[protein]] sequences, called [[proteomics]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Lesk |first=A.

==Introduction==
Bioinformatics has become an important part of many areas of biology. In experimental [[molecular biology]], bioinformatics techniques such as [[image processing|image]] and [[signal processing]] allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed [[mutation]]s. It plays a role in the [[text mining]] of biological literature and the development of biological and gene [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] to organize and query biological data. It also plays a role in the analysis of gene and protein expression and regulation. Bioinformatics tools aid in comparing, analyzing and interpreting of genetic and genomic data and more generally in the understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. At a more integrative level, it helps analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and networks that are an important part of [[systems biology]]. In [[structural biology]], it aids in the simulation and modeling of DNA,<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last1=Sim |first1=A. Y.

===History===
Historically, the term ''bioinformatics'' did not mean what it means today. [[Paulien Hogeweg]] and [[Ben Hesper]] coined it in 1970 to refer to the study of information processes in biotic systems.<ref name="Hogeweg2011">{{cite journal |author=Hogeweg P |title=The Roots of Bioinformatics in Theoretical Biology |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=e1002021 |year=2011 |pmid=21483479 |pmc=3068925 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002021 |editor1-last=Searls |bibcode=2011PLSCB...7E2021H |editor1-first=David B. }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hesper B, Hogeweg P |year=1970 |title=Bioinformatica: een werkconcept |publisher=Kameleon |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=28–29}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hogeweg P |title=Simulating the growth of cellular forms |journal=Simulation |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=90–96 |year=1978 |doi=10.1177/003754977803100305 |s2cid=61206099 }}</ref> This definition placed bioinformatics as a field parallel to [[biochemistry]] (the study of chemical processes in biological systems).<ref name="Hogeweg2011" />

====Sequences====
[[File:Example DNA sequence.png|thumbnail|right|Sequences of genetic material are frequently used in bioinformatics and are easier to manage using computers than manually.]]

Computers became essential in molecular biology when [[protein sequences]] became available after [[Frederick Sanger]] determined the sequence of [[insulin]] in the early 1950s. Comparing multiple sequences manually turned out to be impractical. A pioneer in the field was [[Margaret Oakley Dayhoff]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Glyn |last=Moody |year=2004 |title=Digital Code of Life: How Bioinformatics is Revolutionizing Science, Medicine, and Business |isbn=978-0-471-32788-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/digitalcodeoflif0000mood }}</ref> She compiled one of the first protein sequence databases, initially published as books<ref>Dayhoff, M.O. (1966) Atlas of protein sequence and structure. National Biomedical Research Foundation, 215 pp.</ref> and pioneered methods of sequence alignment and molecular evolution.<ref name="pmid17775169">{{cite journal |vauthors=Eck RV, Dayhoff MO |title=Evolution of the structure of ferredoxin based on living relics of primitive amino Acid sequences |journal=Science |volume=152 |issue=3720 |pages=363–66 |year=1966 |pmid=17775169 |doi=10.1126/science.152.3720.363 |bibcode=1966Sci...152..363E |s2cid=23208558 }}</ref> Another early contributor to bioinformatics was [[Elvin A. Kabat]], who pioneered biological sequence analysis in 1970 with his comprehensive volumes of antibody sequences released with Tai Te Wu between 1980 and 1991.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson G, Wu TT |title=Kabat Database and its applications: 30 years after the first variability plot |journal=Nucleic Acids Res |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=214–18 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10592229 |pmc=102431 |doi=10.1093/nar/28.1.214 }}</ref>
In the 1970’s, new techniques for sequencing DNA were applied to bacteriophage MS2 and øX174, and the extended nucleotide sequences were then parsed with informational and statistical algorithms.  These studies illustrated that well known features, such as the coding segments and the triplet code, are revealed in straightforward statistical analyses and were thus proof of the concept that bioinformatics would be insightful.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Erickson |first1=JW |last2=Altman |first2=GG |title=A Search for Patterns in the Nucleotide Sequence of the MS2 Genome |journal=Journal of Mathematical Biology |date=1979 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=219–230 |doi=10.1007/BF00275725 |s2cid=85199492 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shulman |first1=MJ |last2=Steinberg |first2=CM |last3=Westmoreland |first3=N |title=The Coding Function of Nucleotide Sequences can be Discerned by Statistical Analysis |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |date=1981 |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=409–420|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(81)90274-5 |pmid=6456380 }}</ref>

===Goals===
To study how normal cellular activities are altered in different disease states, the biological data must be combined to form a comprehensive picture of these activities. Therefore, the field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis and interpretation of various types of data. This includes nucleotide and [[amino acid sequence]]s, [[protein domain]]s, and [[protein structure]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essential Bioinformatics|url=https://archive.org/details/essentialbioinfo00xion|url-access=limited|last=Xiong|first=Jin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-511-16815-4|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=[https://archive.org/details/essentialbioinfo00xion/page/n13 4]|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> The actual process of analyzing and interpreting data is referred to as [[computational biology]]. Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include:

* Development and implementation of computer programs that enable efficient access to, management and use of, various types of information.
* Development of new algorithms (mathematical formulas) and statistical measures that assess relationships among members of large data sets. For example, there are methods to locate a [[gene]] within a sequence, to predict protein structure and/or function, and to [[Cluster analysis|cluster]] protein sequences into families of related sequences.

The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes. What sets it apart from other approaches, however, is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to achieve this goal. Examples include: [[pattern recognition]], [[data mining]], [[machine learning]] algorithms, and [[Biological Data Visualization|visualization]]. Major research efforts in the field include [[sequence alignment]], [[gene finding]], [[genome assembly]], [[drug design]], [[drug discovery]], [[protein structural alignment|protein structure alignment]], [[protein structure prediction]], prediction of [[gene expression]] and [[protein–protein interactions]], [[genome-wide association studies]], the modeling of [[evolution]] and [[Cellular model|cell division/mitosis.]]

Bioinformatics now entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data.

Over the past few decades, rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in [[information technologies]] have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology. Bioinformatics is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes.

Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing [[DNA]] and protein sequences, aligning DNA and protein sequences to compare them, and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures.

===Relation to other fields===
Bioinformatics is a science field that is similar to but distinct from [[biological computation]], while it is often considered synonymous to [[computational biology]]. Biological computation uses [[bioengineering]] and [[biology]] to build biological [[computer]]s, whereas bioinformatics uses computation to better understand biology. Bioinformatics and computational biology involve the analysis of biological data, particularly DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The field of bioinformatics experienced explosive growth starting in the mid-1990s, driven largely by the [[Human Genome Project]] and by rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology.

Analyzing biological data to produce meaningful information involves writing and running software programs that use [[algorithm]]s from [[graph theory]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[soft computing]], [[data mining]], [[image processing]], and [[computer simulation]]. The algorithms in turn depend on theoretical foundations such as [[discrete mathematics]], [[control theory]], [[system theory]], [[information theory]], and [[statistics]].

==Sequence analysis==
{{main|Sequence alignment|Sequence database|Alignment-free sequence analysis}}
Since the [[Phi X 174|Phage Φ-X174]] was [[sequencing|sequenced]] in 1977,<ref name="pmid870828">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sanger F, Air GM, Barrell BG, Brown NL, Coulson AR, Fiddes CA, Hutchison CA, Slocombe PM, Smith M |title=Nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage phi X174 DNA |journal=Nature |volume=265 |issue=5596 |pages=687–95 |date=February 1977 |pmid=870828 |doi=10.1038/265687a0 |bibcode=1977Natur.265..687S |s2cid=4206886 }}</ref> the [[DNA sequence]]s of thousands of organisms have been decoded and stored in databases. This sequence information is analyzed to determine genes that encode [[protein]]s, RNA genes, regulatory sequences, structural motifs, and repetitive sequences. A comparison of genes within a [[species]] or between different species can show similarities between protein functions, or relations between species (the use of [[molecular systematics]] to construct [[phylogenetic tree]]s). With the growing amount of data, it long ago became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually. [[Computer program]]s such as [[BLAST]] are used routinely to search sequences—as of 2008, from more than 260,000 organisms, containing over 190 billion [[nucleotide]]s.<ref name="pmid18073190">{{cite journal |vauthors=Benson DA, Karsch-Mizrachi I, Lipman DJ, Ostell J, Wheeler DL |title=GenBank |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=36 |issue=Database issue |pages=D25–30 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18073190 |pmc=2238942 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm929 }}</ref>

===DNA sequencing===
{{main|DNA sequencing}}
Before sequences can be analyzed they have to be obtained from the data storage bank example the Genbank. [[DNA sequencing]] is still a non-trivial problem as the raw data may be noisy or afflicted by weak signals. [[Algorithm]]s have been developed for [[base calling]] for the various experimental approaches to DNA sequencing.

===Sequence assembly===
{{main|Sequence assembly}}
Most DNA sequencing techniques produce short fragments of sequence that need to be assembled to obtain complete gene or genome sequences. The so-called [[shotgun sequencing]] technique (which was used, for example, by [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] (TIGR) to sequence the first bacterial genome, ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'')<ref name="pmid7542800">{{cite journal |vauthors=Fleischmann RD, Adams MD, White O, Clayton RA, Kirkness EF, Kerlavage AR, Bult CJ, Tomb JF, Dougherty BA, Merrick JM |title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd |journal=Science |volume=269 |issue=5223 |pages=496–512 |date=July 1995 |pmid=7542800 |doi=10.1126/science.7542800 |bibcode=1995Sci...269..496F }}</ref> generates the sequences of many thousands of small DNA fragments (ranging from 35 to 900 nucleotides long, depending on the sequencing technology). The ends of these fragments overlap and, when aligned properly by a genome assembly program, can be used to reconstruct the complete genome. Shotgun sequencing yields sequence data quickly, but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite complicated for larger genomes. For a genome as large as the [[human genome]], it may take many days of CPU time on large-memory, multiprocessor computers to assemble the fragments, and the resulting assembly usually contains numerous gaps that must be filled in later. Shotgun sequencing is the method of choice for virtually all genomes sequenced today{{when|date=September 2018}}, and genome assembly algorithms are a critical area of bioinformatics research.

===Genome annotation===
{{main|Gene prediction}}

In the context of [[genomics]], [[Genome project#Genome annotation|annotation]] is the process of marking the genes and other biological features in a DNA sequence. This process needs to be automated because most genomes are too large to annotate by hand, not to mention the desire to annotate as many genomes as possible, as the rate of [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] has ceased to pose a bottleneck. Annotation is made possible by the fact that genes have recognisable start and stop regions, although the exact sequence found in these regions can vary between genes.

The first description of a comprehensive genome annotation system was published in 1995<ref name="pmid7542800"/> by the team at [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] that performed the first complete sequencing and analysis of the genome of a free-living organism, the bacterium ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.<ref name="pmid7542800"/> [[Owen White]] designed and built a software system to identify the genes encoding all proteins, transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs (and other sites) and to make initial functional assignments. Most current genome annotation systems work similarly, but the programs available for analysis of genomic DNA, such as the [[GeneMark]] program trained and used to find protein-coding genes in ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', are constantly changing and improving.

Following the goals that the Human Genome Project left to achieve after its closure in 2003, a new project developed by the National Human Genome Research Institute in the U.S appeared. The so-called [[ENCODE]] project is a collaborative data collection of the functional elements of the human genome that uses next-generation DNA-sequencing technologies and genomic tiling arrays, technologies able to automatically generate large amounts of data at a dramatically reduced per-base cost but with the same accuracy (base call error) and fidelity (assembly error).

===Computational evolutionary biology===
{{further|Computational phylogenetics}}

[[Evolutionary biology]] is the study of the origin and descent of [[species]], as well as their change over time. [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]] has assisted evolutionary biologists by enabling researchers to:
* trace the evolution of a large number of organisms by measuring changes in their [[DNA]], rather than through physical taxonomy or physiological observations alone,
* compare entire [[genomes]], which permits the study of more complex evolutionary events, such as [[gene duplication]], [[horizontal gene transfer]], and the prediction of factors important in bacterial [[speciation]],
* build complex computational [[population genetics]] models to predict the outcome of the system over time<ref>{{cite journal |author=Carvajal-Rodríguez A |title=Simulation of Genes and Genomes Forward in Time |journal=Current Genomics |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=58–61 |year=2012 |pmid=20808525 |pmc=2851118 |doi=10.2174/138920210790218007 }}</ref>
* track and share information on an increasingly large number of species and organisms
Future work endeavours to reconstruct the now more complex [[Evolutionary tree|tree of life]].{{according to whom|date=June 2020}}

The area of research within [[computer science]] that uses [[genetic algorithm]]s is sometimes confused with computational evolutionary biology, but the two areas are not necessarily related.

===Comparative genomics===
{{main|Comparative genomics}}

The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between [[genes]] ([[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthology]] analysis) or other genomic features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=TA |title=Genomes |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford |location=Manchester (UK) |edition=2nd |chapter=Mutation, Repair and Recombination}}</ref> Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and [[endosymbiosis]], often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectrum of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, [[heuristics]], fixed parameter and [[approximation algorithms]] for problems based on parsimony models to [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] algorithms for [[Bayesian analysis]] of problems based on probabilistic models.

Many of these studies are based on the detection of [[sequence homology]] to assign sequences to [[Protein family|protein families]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=N.

===Pan genomics===
{{main|Pan-genome}}

Pan genomics is a concept introduced in 2005 by Tettelin and Medini which eventually took root in bioinformatics. Pan genome is the complete gene repertoire of a particular taxonomic group: although initially applied to closely related strains of a species, it can be applied to a larger context like genus, phylum etc. It is divided in two parts- The Core genome: Set of genes common to all the genomes under study (These are often housekeeping genes vital for survival) and The Dispensable/Flexible Genome: Set of genes not present in all but one or some genomes under study. A bioinformatics tool BPGA can be used to characterize the Pan Genome of bacterial species.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chaudhari Narendrakumar M., Kumar Gupta Vinod, Dutta Chitra |year=2016 |title=BPGA-an ultra-fast pan-genome analysis pipeline |doi=10.1038/srep24373 |pmid=27071527 |pmc=4829868 |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=6 |pages=24373 |bibcode=2016NatSR...624373C }}</ref>

===Analysis of mutations in cancer===
{{main|Oncogenomics}}

In [[cancer]], the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown [[point mutation]]s in a variety of [[gene]]s in cancer. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of [[human genome]] sequences and [[germline]] polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as [[oligonucleotide]] microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called [[comparative genomic hybridization]]), and [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] arrays to detect known ''point mutations''. These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate [[terabyte]]s of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or [[noise]], and thus [[Hidden Markov model]] and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real [[copy number variation|copy number]] changes.

Two important principles can be used in the analysis of cancer genomes bioinformatically pertaining to the identification of mutations in the [[exome]]. First, cancer is a disease of accumulated somatic mutations in genes. Second cancer contains driver mutations which need to be distinguished from passengers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Vazquez|first1=Miguel|last2=Torre|first2=Victor de la|last3=Valencia|first3=Alfonso|date=2012-12-27|title=Chapter 14: Cancer Genome Analysis|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|language=en|volume=8|issue=12|pages=e1002824|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002824|pmid=23300415|pmc=3531315|issn=1553-7358|bibcode=2012PLSCB...8E2824V}}</ref>

With the breakthroughs that this next-generation sequencing technology is providing to the field of Bioinformatics, cancer genomics could drastically change. These new methods and software allow bioinformaticians to sequence many cancer genomes quickly and affordably. This could create a more flexible process for classifying types of cancer by analysis of cancer driven mutations in the genome. Furthermore, tracking of patients while the disease progresses may be possible in the future with the sequence of cancer samples.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hye-Jung |first1=E.C. |last2=Jaswinder |first2=K. |last3=Martin |first3=K. |last4=Samuel |first4=A.A |last5=Marco |first5=A.M |editor1-last=Dellaire |editor1-first=Graham |editor2-last=Berman |editor2-first=Jason N. |editor3-last=Arceci |editor3-first=Robert J. |title=Cancer Genomics |date=2014 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston (US) |isbn=9780123969675 |pages=13–30 |chapter=Second-Generation Sequencing for Cancer Genome Analysis |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-396967-5.00002-5}}</ref>

Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of [[lesion]]s found to be recurrent among many tumors.

==Gene and protein expression==

===Analysis of gene expression===
The [[gene expression|expression]] of many genes can be determined by measuring [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] levels with multiple techniques including [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[expressed sequence tag|expressed cDNA sequence tag]] (EST) sequencing, [[serial analysis of gene expression]] (SAGE) tag sequencing, [[massively parallel signature sequencing]] (MPSS), [[RNA-Seq]], also known as "Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing" (WTSS), or various applications of multiplexed in-situ hybridization. All of these techniques are extremely noise-prone and/or subject to bias in the biological measurement, and a major research area in computational biology involves developing statistical tools to separate [[signal (information theory)|signal]] from [[noise]] in high-throughput gene expression studies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Grau|first1=J.|last2=Ben-Gal|first2=I.|last3=Posch|first3=S.|last4=Grosse|first4=I.|title=VOMBAT: prediction of transcription factor binding sites using variable order Bayesian trees|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=1 July 2006|volume=34|issue=Web Server|pages=W529–W533|doi=10.1093/nar/gkl212 |pmid=16845064|pmc=1538886|url=http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/VOMBAT.pdf}}</ref> Such studies are often used to determine the genes implicated in a disorder: one might compare microarray data from cancerous [[epithelial]] cells to data from non-cancerous cells to determine the transcripts that are up-regulated and down-regulated in a particular population of cancer cells.

===Analysis of protein expression===
[[Protein microarray]]s and high throughput (HT) [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) can provide a snapshot of the proteins present in a biological sample. Bioinformatics is very much involved in making sense of protein microarray and HT MS data; the former approach faces similar problems as with microarrays targeted at mRNA, the latter involves the problem of matching large amounts of mass data against predicted masses from protein sequence databases, and the complicated statistical analysis of samples where multiple, but incomplete peptides from each protein are detected. Cellular protein localization in a tissue context can be achieved through affinity [[proteomics]] displayed as spatial data based on [[immunohistochemistry]] and [[tissue microarray]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.proteinatlas.org |title=The Human Protein Atlas |website=www.proteinatlas.org |access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref>

===Analysis of regulation===
[[Regulation of gene expression|Gene regulation]] is the complex orchestration of events by which a signal, potentially an extracellular signal such as a [[hormone]], eventually leads to an increase or decrease in the activity of one or more [[protein]]s. Bioinformatics techniques have been applied to explore various steps in this process.

For example, gene expression can be regulated by nearby elements in the genome. Promoter analysis involves the identification and study of [[sequence motif]]s in the DNA surrounding the coding region of a gene. These motifs influence the extent to which that region is transcribed into mRNA. [[Enhancer (genetics)|Enhancer]] elements far away from the promoter can also regulate gene expression, through three-dimensional looping interactions. These interactions can be determined by bioinformatic analysis of [[chromosome conformation capture]] experiments.

Expression data can be used to infer gene regulation: one might compare [[microarray]] data from a wide variety of states of an organism to form hypotheses about the genes involved in each state. In a single-cell organism, one might compare stages of the [[cell cycle]], along with various stress conditions (heat shock, starvation, etc.). One can then apply [[cluster analysis|clustering algorithms]] to that expression data to determine which genes are co-expressed. For example, the upstream regions (promoters) of co-expressed genes can be searched for over-represented [[regulatory elements]]. Examples of clustering algorithms applied in gene clustering are [[k-means clustering]], [[self-organizing map]]s (SOMs), [[hierarchical clustering]], and [[consensus clustering]] methods.

==Analysis of cellular organization==
Several approaches have been developed to analyze the location of organelles, genes, proteins, and other components within cells. This is relevant as the location of these components affects the events within a cell and thus helps us to predict the behavior of biological systems. A [[gene ontology]] category, ''cellular component'', has been devised to capture subcellular localization in many [[biological database]]s.

===Microscopy and image analysis===
Microscopic pictures allow us to locate both [[organelle]]s as well as molecules. It may also help us to distinguish between normal and abnormal cells, e.g. in [[cancer]].

===Protein localization===
The localization of proteins helps us to evaluate the role of a protein. For instance, if a protein is found in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] it may be involved in [[Regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]] or [[RNA splicing|splicing]]. By contrast, if a protein is found in [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]], it may be involved in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] or other [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]]. Protein localization is thus an important component of [[protein function prediction]]. There are well developed [[protein subcellular localization prediction]] resources available, including protein subcellular location databases, and prediction tools.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.proteinatlas.org/humancell |title=The human cell |website=www.proteinatlas.org |access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Thul |first1=Peter J. |last2=Åkesson |first2=Lovisa |last3=Wiking |first3=Mikaela |last4=Mahdessian |first4=Diana |last5=Geladaki |first5=Aikaterini |last6=Blal |first6=Hammou Ait |last7=Alm |first7=Tove |last8=Asplund |first8=Anna |last9=Björk |first9=Lars |date=2017-05-26 |title=A subcellular map of the human proteome |journal=Science |volume=356 |issue=6340 |pages=eaal3321 |doi=10.1126/science.aal3321 |pmid=28495876|s2cid=10744558 }}</ref>

===Nuclear organization of chromatin===
{{main|Nuclear organization}}
Data from high-throughput [[chromosome conformation capture]] experiments, such as [[Hi-C (experiment)]] and [[ChIA-PET]], can provide information on the spatial proximity of DNA loci. Analysis of these experiments can determine the three-dimensional structure and [[nuclear organization]] of chromatin. Bioinformatic challenges in this field include partitioning the genome into domains, such as [[Topologically Associating Domain]]s (TADs), that are organised together in three-dimensional space.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ay |first1=Ferhat |last2=Noble |first2=William S. |title=Analysis methods for studying the 3D architecture of the genome |journal=Genome Biology |date=2 September 2015 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=183 |doi=10.1186/s13059-015-0745-7|pmid=26328929 |pmc=4556012 }}</ref>

==Structural bioinformatics==<!-- this is specific enough, compared to general knowledge in previous paragraph, that it would be nice to have a source or example -->
{{main|Structural bioinformatics|Protein structure prediction}}
{{See also|Structural motif|Structural domain}}
[[File:1kqf opm.png|thumbnail|left|3-dimensional protein structures such as this one are common subjects in bioinformatic analyses.]]

Protein structure prediction is another important application of bioinformatics. The [[amino acid]] sequence of a protein, the so-called [[primary structure]], can be easily determined from the sequence on the gene that codes for it. In the vast majority of cases, this primary structure uniquely determines a structure in its native environment. (Of course, there are exceptions, such as the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad cow disease) [[prion]].) Knowledge of this structure is vital in understanding the function of the protein. Structural information is usually classified as one of ''[[secondary structure|secondary]]'', ''[[tertiary structure|tertiary]]'' and ''[[quaternary structure|quaternary]]'' structure. A viable general solution to such predictions remains an open problem. Most efforts have so far been directed towards heuristics that work most of the time.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

One of the key ideas in bioinformatics is the notion of [[Sequence homology|homology]]. In the genomic branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to predict the function of a gene: if the sequence of gene ''A'', whose function is known, is homologous to the sequence of gene ''B,'' whose function is unknown, one could infer that B may share A's function. In the structural branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to determine which parts of a protein are important in structure formation and interaction with other proteins. In a technique called [[homology modeling]], this information is used to predict the structure of a protein once the structure of a homologous protein is known. This currently remains the only way to predict protein structures reliably.

One example of this is hemoglobin in humans and the hemoglobin in legumes ([[leghemoglobin]]), which are distant relatives from the same [[protein superfamily]]. Both serve the same purpose of transporting oxygen in the organism. Although both of these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences, their protein structures are virtually identical, which reflects their near identical purposes and shared ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hoy |first1=JA |last2=Robinson |first2=H |last3=Trent JT |first3=3rd |last4=Kakar |first4=S |last5=Smagghe |first5=BJ |last6=Hargrove |first6=MS |title=Plant hemoglobins: a molecular fossil record for the evolution of oxygen transport |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |date=3 August 2007 |volume=371 |issue=1 |pages=168–79 |pmid=17560601 |doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2007.05.029}}</ref>

Other techniques for predicting protein structure include protein threading and ''de novo'' (from scratch) physics-based modeling.

Another aspect of structural bioinformatics include the use of protein structures for [[Virtual screening|Virtual Screening]] models such as [[QSAR|Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship]] models and proteochemometric models (PCM). Furthermore, a protein's crystal structure can be used in simulation of for example ligand-binding studies and ''in silico'' mutagenesis studies.

==Network and systems biology==
{{main|Computational systems biology|Biological network|Interactome}}

''Network analysis'' seeks to understand the relationships within [[biological network]]s such as [[Metabolic network|metabolic]] or [[Interactome|protein–protein interaction networks]]. Although biological networks can be constructed from a single type of molecule or entity (such as genes), network biology often attempts to integrate many different data types, such as proteins, small molecules, gene expression data, and others, which are all connected physically, functionally, or both.

''Systems biology'' involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems (such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s that comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s) to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes. [[Artificial life]] or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms.

===Molecular interaction networks===
[[File:The protein interaction network of Treponema pallidum.png|200px|thumbnail|right|Interactions between proteins are frequently visualized and analyzed using networks. This network is made up of protein–protein interactions from ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'', the causative agent of [[syphilis]] and other diseases.]]
{{main|Protein–protein interaction prediction|interactome}}

Tens of thousands of three-dimensional protein structures have been determined by [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (protein NMR) and a central question in structural bioinformatics is whether it is practical to predict possible protein–protein interactions only based on these 3D shapes, without performing [[protein–protein interaction]] experiments. A variety of methods have been developed to tackle the [[protein–protein docking]] problem, though it seems that there is still much work to be done in this field.

Other interactions encountered in the field include Protein–ligand (including drug) and [[protein–peptide]]. Molecular dynamic simulation of movement of atoms about rotatable bonds is the fundamental principle behind computational [[algorithm]]s, termed docking algorithms, for studying [[interactome|molecular interactions]].

==Others==

===Literature analysis===
{{main|Text mining|Biomedical text mining}}

The growth in the number of published literature makes it virtually impossible to read every paper, resulting in disjointed sub-fields of research. Literature analysis aims to employ computational and statistical linguistics to mine this growing library of text resources. For example:
* Abbreviation recognition – identify the long-form and abbreviation of biological terms
* Named entity recognition – recognizing biological terms such as gene names
* Protein–protein interaction – identify which [[protein]]s interact with which proteins from text

The area of research draws from [[statistics]] and [[computational linguistics]].

===High-throughput image analysis===
Computational technologies are used to accelerate or fully automate the processing, quantification and analysis of large amounts of high-information-content [[medical imaging|biomedical imagery]]. Modern [[image analysis]] systems augment an observer's ability to make measurements from a large or complex set of images, by improving [[accuracy]], [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]], or speed. A fully developed analysis system may completely replace the observer. Although these systems are not unique to biomedical imagery, biomedical imaging is becoming more important for both [[diagnostics]] and research. Some examples are:
* high-throughput and high-fidelity quantification and sub-cellular localization ([[high-content screening]], cytohistopathology, [[Bioimage informatics]])
* [[morphometrics]]
* clinical image analysis and visualization
* determining the real-time air-flow patterns in breathing lungs of living animals
* quantifying occlusion size in real-time imagery from the development of and recovery during arterial injury
* making behavioral observations from extended video recordings of laboratory animals
* infrared measurements for metabolic activity determination
* inferring clone overlaps in [[Gene mapping|DNA mapping]], e.g. the [[Sulston score]]

===High-throughput single cell data analysis===
{{main|Flow cytometry bioinformatics}}
Computational techniques are used to analyse high-throughput, low-measurement single cell data, such as that obtained from [[flow cytometry]]. These methods typically involve finding populations of cells that are relevant to a particular disease state or experimental condition.

===Biodiversity informatics===
{{main|Biodiversity informatics}}
Biodiversity informatics deals with the collection and analysis of [[biodiversity]] data, such as [[taxonomic database]]s, or [[microbiome]] data. Examples of such analyses include [[phylogenetics]], [[niche modelling]], [[species richness]] mapping, [[DNA barcoding]], or [[Speciesism|species]] identification tools.

===Ontologies and data integration===
Biological ontologies are [[directed acyclic graph]]s of [[controlled vocabulary|controlled vocabularies]]. They are designed to capture biological concepts and descriptions in a way that can be easily categorised and analysed with computers. When categorised in this way, it is possible to gain added value from holistic and integrated analysis.

The [[OBO Foundry]] was an effort to standardise certain ontologies. One of the most widespread is the [[Gene ontology]] which describes gene function. There are also ontologies which describe phenotypes.

==Databases==
{{main|List of biological databases|Biological database}}
Databases are essential for bioinformatics research and applications. Many databases exist, covering various information types: for example, DNA and protein sequences, molecular structures, phenotypes and biodiversity. Databases may contain empirical data (obtained directly from experiments), predicted data (obtained from analysis), or, most commonly, both. They may be specific to a particular organism, pathway or molecule of interest. Alternatively, they can incorporate data compiled from multiple other databases. These databases vary in their format, access mechanism, and whether they are public or not.

Some of the most commonly used databases are listed below. For a more comprehensive list, please check the link at the beginning of the subsection.

* Used in biological sequence analysis: [[Genbank]], [[UniProt]]
* Used in structure analysis: [[Protein Data Bank]] (PDB)
* Used in finding Protein Families and [[Sequence motif|Motif]] Finding: [[InterPro]], [[Pfam]]
* Used for Next Generation Sequencing: [[Sequence Read Archive]]
* Used in Network Analysis: Metabolic Pathway Databases ([[KEGG]], [[BioCyc database collection|BioCyc]]), Interaction Analysis Databases, Functional Networks
* Used in design of synthetic genetic circuits: [[GenoCAD]]

==Software and tools==
[[List of bioinformatics software|Software tools for bioinformatics]] range from simple command-line tools, to more complex graphical programs and standalone web-services available from various [[List of bioinformatics companies|bioinformatics companies]] or public institutions.

===Open-source bioinformatics software===
Many [[free and open-source software]] tools have existed and continued to grow since the 1980s.<ref name=obf-main>{{cite web |title=Open Bioinformatics Foundation: About us |url=http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page |website=Official website |publisher=[[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]] |accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> The combination of a continued need for new [[algorithm]]s for the analysis of emerging types of biological readouts, the potential for innovative ''[[in silico]]'' experiments, and freely available [[open code]] bases have helped to create opportunities for all research groups to contribute to both bioinformatics and the range of open-source software available, regardless of their funding arrangements. The open source tools often act as incubators of ideas, or community-supported [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] in commercial applications. They may also provide ''[[de facto]]'' standards and shared object models for assisting with the challenge of bioinformation integration.

The [[List of open-source bioinformatics software|range of open-source software packages]] includes titles such as [[Bioconductor]], [[BioPerl]], [[Biopython]], [[BioJava]], [[BioJS]], [[BioRuby]], [[Bioclipse]], [[EMBOSS]], [[.NET Bio]], [[Orange (software)|Orange]] with its bioinformatics add-on, [[Apache Taverna]], [[UGENE]] and [[GenoCAD]]. To maintain this tradition and create further opportunities, the non-profit [[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]]<ref name=obf-main /> have supported the annual [[Bioinformatics Open Source Conference]] (BOSC) since 2000.<ref name=obf-bosc>{{cite web |title=Open Bioinformatics Foundation: BOSC |url=http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC |website=Official website |publisher=[[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]] |accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref>

An alternative method to build public bioinformatics databases is to use the MediaWiki engine with the [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:WikiOpener ''WikiOpener''] extension. This system allows the database to be accessed and updated by all experts in the field.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brohée |first1=Sylvain |last2=Barriot |first2=Roland |last3=Moreau |first3=Yves |title=Biological knowledge bases using Wikis: combining the flexibility of Wikis with the structure of databases |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/17/2210.full |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=26 |issue=17 |pages=2210–11|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btq348 |pmid=20591906 |year=2010 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Web services in bioinformatics===
[[SOAP]]- and [[REST]]-based interfaces have been developed for a wide variety of bioinformatics applications allowing an application running on one computer in one part of the world to use algorithms, data and computing resources on servers in other parts of the world. The main advantages derive from the fact that end users do not have to deal with software and database maintenance overheads.

Basic bioinformatics services are classified by the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]] into three categories: [[Sequence alignment software|SSS]] (Sequence Search Services), [[Multiple sequence alignment|MSA]] (Multiple Sequence Alignment), and [[Bioinformatics#Sequence analysis|BSA]] (Biological Sequence Analysis).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nisbet |first=Robert |others=John Elder IV, Gary Miner |title=Handbook of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Applications |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5np34a5fmQC&q=bioinformatics%20service%20categories%20EBI&pg=PA328|publisher=Academic Press |year=2009 |page=328 |chapter=Bioinformatics |isbn=978-0080912035 }}</ref> The availability of these [[Service-orientation|service-oriented]] bioinformatics resources demonstrate the applicability of web-based bioinformatics solutions, and range from a collection of standalone tools with a common data format under a single, standalone or web-based interface, to integrative, distributed and extensible [[bioinformatics workflow management systems]].

===Bioinformatics workflow management systems===
{{main|Bioinformatics workflow management systems}}

A [[Bioinformatics workflow management systems|bioinformatics workflow management system]] is a specialized form of a [[workflow management system]] designed specifically to compose and execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps, or a workflow, in a Bioinformatics application. Such systems are designed to
* provide an easy-to-use environment for individual application scientists themselves to create their own workflows,
* provide interactive tools for the scientists enabling them to execute their workflows and view their results in real-time,
* simplify the process of sharing and reusing workflows between the scientists, and
* enable scientists to track the [[provenance]] of the workflow execution results and the workflow creation steps.

Some of the platforms giving this service: [[Galaxy (computational biology)|Galaxy]], [[Kepler scientific workflow system|Kepler]], [[Apache Taverna|Taverna]], [[UGENE]], [[Anduril (workflow engine)|Anduril]], [[High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment|HIVE]].

=== BioCompute and BioCompute Objects ===
In 2014, the [[Food and Drug Administration|US Food and Drug Administration]] sponsored a conference held at the [[National Institutes of Health]] Bethesda Campus to discuss reproducibility in bioinformatics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RegulatoryScience/ucm389561.htm|title=Advancing Regulatory Science – Sept. 24–25, 2014 Public Workshop: Next Generation Sequencing Standards|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Over the next three years, a consortium of stakeholders met regularly to discuss what would become BioCompute paradigm.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Simonyan|first1=Vahan|last2=Goecks|first2=Jeremy|last3=Mazumder|first3=Raja|date=2017|title=Biocompute Objects – A Step towards Evaluation and Validation of Biomedical Scientific Computations|journal=PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology|volume=71|issue=2|pages=136–46|doi=10.5731/pdajpst.2016.006734|issn=1079-7440|pmc=5510742|pmid=27974626}}</ref> These stakeholders included representatives from government, industry, and academic entities. Session leaders represented numerous branches of the FDA and NIH Institutes and Centers, non-profit entities including the [[Human Variome Project]] and the [[European Federation for Medical Informatics]], and research institutions including [[Stanford University|Stanford]], the [[New York Genome Center]], and the [[George Washington University]].

It was decided that the BioCompute paradigm would be in the form of digital 'lab notebooks' which allow for the reproducibility, replication, review, and reuse, of bioinformatics protocols. This was proposed to enable greater continuity within a research group over the course of normal personnel flux while furthering the exchange of ideas between groups. The US FDA funded this work so that information on pipelines would be more transparent and accessible to their regulatory staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RegulatoryScience/ucm491893.htm|title=Advancing Regulatory Science – Community-based development of HTS standards for validating data and computation and encouraging interoperability|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>

In 2016, the group reconvened at the NIH in Bethesda and discussed the potential for a [[BioCompute Object]], an instance of the BioCompute paradigm. This work was copied as both a "standard trial use" document and a preprint paper uploaded to bioRxiv. The BioCompute object allows for the JSON-ized record to be shared among employees, collaborators, and regulators.<ref>{{cite biorxiv|last1=Alterovitz|first1=Gil|last2=Dean|first2=Dennis A.|last3=Goble|first3=Carole|last4=Crusoe|first4=Michael R.|last5=Soiland-Reyes|first5=Stian|last6=Bell|first6=Amanda|last7=Hayes|first7=Anais|last8=King|first8=Charles Hadley S.|last9=Johanson|first9=Elaine|date=2017-10-04|title=Enabling Precision Medicine via standard communication of NGS provenance, analysis, and results|biorxiv=10.1101/191783}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=BioCompute Object (BCO) project is a collaborative and community-driven framework to standardize HTS computational data. 1.
