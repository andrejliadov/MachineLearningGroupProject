<!--
PLEASE FOLLOW THESE RULES WHEN ADDING AN ENTRY:
  - Only projects that have achieved notability must be added. As per Wikipedia guideline (found at [[WP:MOSLIST]]), if an item is not notable enough to have a Wikipedia article of its own, it should not be added to a list. It's as simple as that.
  - Each entry must state the item name and a small one-line (but no larger) description.
  - The item name must be the project name if one is available, with only a secondary reference to the company name if any.
  - The item description should mention just how the project is a notable AI project.
  - Items must be added in alphabetical order within the appropriate section.
  - Items with external links have been removed in the past, and so external links probably shouldn't be added. If you do, you risk the project getting removed from the list altogether.

Syntax:
* [[Item name]], item description. [Mandatory_RefLink1] [Optional_Ref2]
* Item name, item description. [Mandatory_RefLink1] [Optional_Ref2]
