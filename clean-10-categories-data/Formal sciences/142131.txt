'''Hornbostel–Sachs''' or '''Sachs–Hornbostel''' is a system of [[musical instrument classification]] devised by [[Erich Moritz von Hornbostel]] and [[Curt Sachs]], and first published in the {{lang|de|Zeitschrift für Ethnologie|italic=yes}} in 1914.<ref>Volume 46 (1914) of the ''Zeitschrift'' is available online in a [https://archive.org/details/zeitschriftfre46berluoft variety of formats], as part of the digital [https://archive.org/search.php?query=collection%3A%22toronto%22 collection] of the [[University of Toronto]]. The article by Hornbostel and Sachs is to be found on pages 553–90.</ref> An English translation was published in the ''[[Galpin Society|Galpin Society Journal]]'' in 1961. It is the most widely used system for classifying [[musical instruments]] by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]] and [[organology|organologists]] (people who study musical instruments). The system was updated in 2011 as part of the work of the Musical Instrument Museums Online (MIMO) Project.<ref>{{cite web|author=Evénement |url=http://www.mimo-international.com |title=MIMO Project – Musical Instrument Museums Online |publisher=Mimo-international.com |access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref>

Hornbostel and Sachs based their ideas on a system devised in the late 19th century by [[Victor-Charles Mahillon]], the curator of musical instruments at [[Brussels Conservatory]]. Mahillon divided instruments into four broad categories according to the nature of the sound-producing material: an air column; string; membrane; and body of the instrument. From this basis, Hornbostel and Sachs expanded Mahillon's system to make it possible to classify any instrument from any culture.

Formally, the Hornbostel–Sachs is modeled on the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] for libraries. It has five top-level classifications, with several levels below those, adding up to over 300 basic categories in all. The top five levels of the scheme are as follows:

==Idiophones (1)==
'''[[Idiophone]]s''' primarily produce their sounds by means of the actual body of the instrument vibrating, rather than a string, membrane, or column of air. In essence, this group includes all [[percussion instrument]]s apart from [[drums]], as well as some other instruments. In the Hornbostel–Sachs classification, idiophones are first categorized according to the method used to play the instrument. The result is four main categories: struck idiophones (11), plucked idiophones (12), friction idiophones (13), and blown idiophones (14). These groups are subsequently divided through various criteria. In many cases these sub-categories are split in singular specimens and sets of instruments. The latter category includes the [[xylophone]], the [[marimba]], the [[glockenspiel]], and the [[glass harmonica]].

([[List of idiophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number]])

===Struck idiophones (11)===
These idiophones are set in vibration by being struck, for example [[cymbal]]s or [[xylophone]]s.

====Directly struck idiophones (111)====
The player executes the movement of striking; whether by mechanical intermediate devices, beaters, keyboards, or by pulling ropes, etc. It is definitive that the player can apply clear, exact, individual strokes, and that the instrument itself is equipped for this kind of percussion.
* 111.1 [[Concussion idiophone]]s or [[clapper (musical instrument)|clappers]] – Two or more complementary sonorous parts are struck against each other.
** 111.11 Concussion [[wikt:stick|sticks]] or [[stick clapper]]s ([[clapstick]]).
** 111.12 Concussion [[plaque (instrument)|plaques]] or [[plaque clapper]]s ([[paiban]]).
** 111.13 Concussion [[trough (physics)|troughs]] or [[watering trough|trough]] clappers ([[devil chase]]).
** 111.14 Concussion [[Bowl (vessel)|vessels]] or [[vessel clapper]]s ([[spoon (musical instrument)|spoons]]).
*** 111.141 [[Castanets]] – Natural and hollowed-out vessel clappers.
*** 111.142 [[Cymbals]] – Vessel clappers with manufactured rim.
* 111.2 [[Percussion idiophone]]s – The instrument is struck either with a non-sonorous object (hand, stick, striker) or against a non-sonorous object (human body, the ground).
** 111.21 [[Percussion stick]]s.
*** 111.211 Individual percussion sticks.
*** 111.212 Sets of percussion sticks in a range of different pitches combined into one instrument. – All [[xylophone]]s, as long  as their sounding components are not in two different planes.
** 111.22 [[Percussion plaque]]s.
*** 111.221 Individual percussion plaques.
*** 111.222 Sets of percussion plaques – Examples are the [[lithophone]] and also most [[metallophone]]s.
** 111.23 [[Percussion tube]]s.
*** 111.231 Individual percussion tubes.
*** 111.232 Sets of percussion tubes.
** 111.24 [[Percussion vessel]]s.
*** 111.241 [[Gong]]s – The vibration is strongest near the vertex.
**** 111.241.1 Individual gongs.
**** 111.241.2 Sets of gongs.

****** 111.242.221 Sets of hanging bells without internal strikers.
****** 111.242.222 Sets of hanging bells with internal strikers.
**111.3 Mixed sets of directly struck idiophones

====Indirectly struck idiophones (112)====
The player himself/herself does not go through the movement of striking; percussion results indirectly through some other movement by the player.
* 112.1 Shaken Idiophones or [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]] – The player makes a shaking motion
** 112.11 Suspension rattles – Perforated idiophones are mounted together, and shaken to strike against each other.
*** 112.111 Strung rattles – Rattling objects are strung in rows on a cord.
*** 112.112 Stick rattles – Rattling objects are strung on a bar or ring.
** 112.12 Frame rattles – Rattling objects are attached to a carrier against which they strike ([[flexatone]]).
*** 112.121 Pendant rattles.
*** 112.122 Sliding rattles.
** 112.13 Vessel rattles – Rattling objects enclosed in a vessel strike against each other or against the walls of the vessel, or usually against both.
* 112.2 Scraped Idiophones – The player causes a scraping movement directly or indirectly; a non-sonorous object moves along the notched surface of a sonorous object, to be alternately lifted off the teeth and flicked against them; or an elastic sonorous object moves along the surface of a notched non-sonorous object to cause a series of impacts. This group must not be confused with that of friction idiophones.

***112.232 Scraped wheels with resonator.
* 112.3 Split idiophones – Instruments in the shape of two springy arms connected at one end and touching at the other: the arms are forced apart by a little stick, to jangle or vibrate on recoil.

===Plucked idiophones (12)===
{{See|List of lamellophones}}

Plucked idiophones, or [[lamellaphone]]s, are idiophones set in vibration by being plucked; examples include the [[jaw harp]] or [[mbira]]. This group is sub-divided in the following two categories:

====In the form of a frame (121)====
The lamellae vibrate within a frame or hoop.
* 121.1 Clack idiophones or [[Cricri]] – The lamella is carved in the surface of a fruit shell, which serves as resonator.
* 121.2 Guimbardes and [[Jaw harp]]s (i. e. “kissed” idiophones) – The lamella is mounted in a rod- or plaque-shaped frame and depends on the player's mouth cavity for resonance.
** 121.21 Idioglot guimbardes – The lamella is cut through the frame of the instrument ([[kubing]]).
***121.211 Individual idioglot guimbardes.
*** 121.212 Sets of idioglot guimbardes
** 121.22 Heteroglot guimbardes – The lamella is attached to the frame (Western Jew's harp, [[kouxian]]). Present-day ethnomusicologists, such as [[Margaret J. Kartomi|Margaret Kartomi]] (page 173) and Ellingson (PhD dissertation, 1979, p.&nbsp;544), might support the suggestion that, in keeping with the spirit of the original Hornbostel–Sachs classification scheme, of categorization by what first produces the initial sound in the instrument, that the supposed class 412.13 should count as these instead.
*** 121.221 Individual heteroglot guimbardes.
*** 121.222 Sets of heteroglot guimbardes
**121.23 Mixed sets of guimbardes

Instruments in which the membrane is vibrated by an unbroken column of wind, without a chamber

====Tube or vessel-kazoos (242)====
Instruments in which the membrane is placed in a box, tube or other container

This group includes all instruments generally called [[string instrument]]s in the west, as well as many (but not all) [[keyboard instrument]]s, such as [[piano]]s and [[harpsichord]]s.

([[List of chordophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number]])

===Simple chordophones or [[zither]]s (31)===
Instruments which are in essence simply a string or strings and a string bearer. These instruments may have a resonator box, but removing it should not render the instrument unplayable, though it may result in quite a different sound being produced. They include the [[piano]] therefore, as well as other kinds of [[zither]]s such as the [[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]], and [[musical bow]]s.

===Unclassified chordophones (33)===

==Aerophones (4)==
{{main|Aerophone}}
Aerophones primarily produce their sounds by means of vibrating air. The instrument itself does not vibrate, and there are no vibrating strings or membranes.

([[List of aerophones by Hornbostel–Sachs number]])

===Free aerophones (41)===
Instruments in which the vibrating air is not contained within the instrument, for example sirens,<!--Is this correct? Is [[Car horn#Signalling and vehicle horns]] what is meant?--> or the [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarer]].

====Displacement free aerophones (411)====
The air-stream meets a sharp edge, or a sharp edge is moved through the air. In either case, according to more recent views, a periodic displacement of air occurs to the alternate flanks of the edge. Examples are the swordblade or the whip.

====Interruptive free aerophones (412)====
The air-stream is interrupted periodically.
* 412.1 Idiophonic interruptive aerophones or reeds – The air-stream is directed against a lamella, setting it in periodic vibration to interrupt the stream intermittently. In this group also belong reeds with a 'cover,' i.e. a tube in which the air vibrates only in a secondary sense, not producing the sound but simply adding roundness and timbre to the sound made by the reed's vibration; generally recognizable by the absence of fingerholes though present-day ethnomusicologists, such as Margaret Kartomi (page 173) and Ellingson (PhD dissertation, 1979, p.&nbsp;544), might support the suggestion that, in keeping with the spirit of the original Hornbostel–Sachs classification scheme, of categorization by what first produces the initial sound in the instrument, that such reeds should not really remain as aerophones, exiting for the lamellophones.
** 412.11 Concussion reeds – Two lamellae make a gap which closes periodically during their vibration.
*** 412.111 Independent pairs of concussion reeds.
*** 412.112 Paired sets of concussion reeds
** 412.12 Percussion reeds – A single lamella strikes against a frame.
*** 412.121 Independent percussion reeds.
*** 412.122 Sets of percussion reeds. – Earlier organs
** 412.13 [[Free-reed instrument]]s feature a reed which vibrates within a closely fitting slot (there may be an attached pipe, but it should only vibrate in sympathy with the reed, and not have an effect on the pitch – instruments of this class can be distinguished from 422.3 by the lack of finger-holes).
*** 412.131 Individual free reeds.
*** 412.132 Sets of free reeds – [[Accordion]], [[harmonica]], and [[reed pipe]]s of the [[pipe organ]].
** 412.14 Band reed instruments – The air hits the sharp edge of a band under tension. The acoustics of this instrument have so far not been investigated.<ref>"[http://www.mimo-db.eu/HornbostelAndSachs/237 412.14 Ribbon reeds]," ''Mimo-db.eu.''</ref>

** 412.23 Sets of disks and tubes
* 412.3 Mixed sets of interruptive aerophones

====Plosive aerophones (413)====
The sound is caused by a single compression and release of air. Examples include the [[botija]], the [[gharha]], the [[ghatam]], and the [[udu]].

'''Mixed sets of free aerophones (414)'''

===Non-free aerophones (wind instruments proper) (42)===
The vibrating air is contained within the instrument. This group includes most of the instruments called [[wind instrument]]s in the west, such as the [[flute]] or [[French horn]], as well as many other kinds of instruments such as [[conch shell]]s.

====[[Edge-blown aerophones|Edge-blown aerophones or flutes]] (421)====

====Mixed sets of wind instruments (424)====

===Mixed sets of aerophones (43)===
{{Empty section|date=November 2018|section= }}

==Electrophones (5)==
* 51. Instruments having electric action (e.g. pipe organ with electrically controlled solenoid air valves);
* 52. Instruments having electrical amplification, such as the Neo-Bechstein piano of 1931, which had 18 microphones built into it;
* 53. ''Radioelectric instruments'': instruments in which sound is produced by electrical means.

The fifth top-level group, the '''[[electrophone]]s''' category, was added by Sachs in 1940, to describe instruments involving electricity. Sachs broke down his 5th category into 3 subcategories: 51=electrically actuated acoustic instruments; 52=electrically amplified acoustic instruments; 53= instruments which make sound primarily by way of electrically driven oscillators, such as [[theremin]]s or [[synthesizer]]s, which he called radioelectric instruments. [[Francis William Galpin]] provided such a group in his own classification system, which is closer to Mahillon than Sachs–Hornbostel. For example, in Galpin's 1937 book ''A Textbook of European Musical Instruments,'' he lists electrophones with three second-level divisions for sound generation ("by oscillation," "electro-magnetic," and "electro-static"), as well as third-level and fourth-level categories based on the control method. Sachs himself proposed subcategories 51, 52, and 53, on pages 447–467 of his 1940 book ''The History of Musical Instruments.'' However, the original 1914 version of the system did not acknowledge the existence of his 5th category.

Present-day ethnomusicologists, such as Margaret Kartomi (page 173) and Ellingson (PhD dissertation, 1979, p.&nbsp;544), suggest that, in keeping with the spirit of the original Hornbostel–Sachs classification scheme, of categorization by what first produces the initial sound in the instrument, that only subcategory 53 should remain in the electrophones category. Thus it has been more recently proposed that, for example, the pipe organ (even if it uses electric key action to control solenoid valves) remain in the aerophones category, and that the electric guitar remain in the chordophones category, etc..

==Application of the system==
Beyond the top three groups are several further levels of classification, so that the [[xylophone]], for example, is in the group labeled 111.212 (periods are usually added after every third digit to make long numbers easier to read). A long classification number does not necessarily indicate the instrument is a complicated one. The [[Bugle (instrument)|valveless bugle]] for instance, has the classification number 423.121.22, even though it is generally regarded as a relatively simple instrument (it is basically a bent conical tube which you blow down like a [[trumpet]], but it does not have valves or finger-holes). The numbers in the bugle's classification indicate the following:
* '''4''' – an aerophone
* '''42''' – the vibrating air is enclosed within the instrument
* '''423''' – the player's lips cause the air to vibrate directly (as opposed to an instrument with a reed like a [[clarinet]], or an edge-blown instrument, like a [[flute]])
* '''423.1''' – the player's lips are the only means of changing the instrument's pitch (that is, there are no valves as on a trumpet)
* '''423.12''' – the instrument is tubular, rather than being a [[conch]]-type instrument
* '''423.121''' – the player blows into the end of the tube, as opposed to the side of the tube
* '''423.121.2''' – the tube is bent or folded, as opposed to straight
* '''423.121.22''' – the instrument has a [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]]

423.121.22 does not uniquely identify the bugle, but rather identifies the bugle as a certain kind of instrument which has much in common with other instruments in the same class. Another instrument classified as 423.121.22 is the bronze [[lur]], an instrument dating back to the [[Bronze Age]].

==Suffixes and composite instruments==
After the number described above, a number of [[suffix]]es may be appended. An '''8''' indicates that the instrument has a keyboard attached, while a '''9''' indicates the instrument is mechanically driven. In addition to these, there are a number of suffixes unique to each of the top-level groups indicating details not considered crucial to the fundamental nature of the instrument. In the membranophone class, for instance, suffixes can indicate whether the skin of a drum is glued, nailed or tied to its body; in the chordophone class, suffixes can indicate whether the strings are plucked with fingers or plectrum, or played with a bow.

There are ways to classify instruments with this system even if they have elements from more than one group. Such instruments may have particularly long classification numbers with colons and hyphens used as well as numbers. Hornbostel and Sachs themselves cite the case of various [[bagpipe]]s where some of the pipes are single reed (like a clarinet) and others are double reed (like the [[oboe]]). A number of similar composite instruments exist.
