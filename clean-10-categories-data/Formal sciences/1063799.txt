__NOTOC__
'''Categorical logic''' is the branch of [[mathematics]] in which tools and concepts from [[category theory]] are applied to the study of [[mathematical logic]]. It is also notable for its connections to [[theoretical computer science]]. In broad terms, categorical logic represents both syntax and semantics by a [[category (mathematics)|category]], and an [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] by a [[functor]].  The categorical framework provides a rich conceptual background for logical and [[type theory|type-theoretic]] constructions. The subject has been recognisable in these terms since around 1970.

== Overview ==

There are three important<!--to computer science --> themes in the categorical approach to logic:
;Categorical semantics: Categorical logic introduces the notion of ''structure valued in a category'' C with the classical [[model theory|model theoretic]] notion of a structure appearing in the particular case where C is the [[Category of sets|category of sets and functions]]. This notion has proven useful when the set-theoretic notion of a model lacks generality and/or is inconvenient. [[R.A.G. Seely]]'s modeling of various [[impredicative]] theories, such as [[system F]] is an example of the usefulness of categorical semantics.

:It was found that the connectives of pre-categorical logic were more clearly understood using the concept of adjoint functor, and that the quantifiers were also best understood using adjoint functors.<ref>Lawvere, Quantifiers and Sheaves</ref>

;Internal languages: This can be seen as a formalization and generalization of proof by [[diagram chasing]]. One defines a suitable internal language naming relevant constituents of a category, and then applies categorical semantics to turn assertions in a logic over the internal language into corresponding categorical statements. This has been most successful in the theory of [[topos]]es, where the internal language of a topos together with the semantics of intuitionistic higher-order logic in a topos enables one to reason about the objects and morphisms of a topos "as if they were sets and functions".{{Citation needed|reason=if this is an actual quote, who said it?|date=July 2015}} This has been successful in dealing with toposes that have "sets" with properties incompatible with classical logic. A prime example is [[Dana Scott]]'s model of [[untyped lambda calculus]] in terms of objects that retract onto their own function space. Another is the Moggi–Hyland model of [[system F]] by an internal [[full subcategory]] of the [[effective topos]] of [[Martin Hyland]].
;Term-model constructions: In many cases, the categorical semantics of a logic provide a basis for establishing a correspondence between [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theories]] in the logic and instances of an appropriate kind of category. A classic example is the correspondence between theories of [[beta reduction|βη]]-[[equational logic]] over [[simply typed lambda calculus]] and [[Cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]]. Categories arising from theories via term-model constructions can usually be characterized up to [[Equivalence of categories|equivalence]] by a suitable [[universal property]]. This has enabled proofs of [[Metalogic|meta-theoretical]] properties of some logics by means of an appropriate [[:Category:monoidal categories|categorical algebra]]<!--no good article-->. For instance, [[Peter J. Freyd|Freyd]] gave a proof of the existence and disjunction properties of [[intuitionistic logic]] this way.
