'''ADS-AC''' is an experimental [[open-source model|open source]] program which implements Absolutely Dynamic System (ADS), a proposed mechanism for [[Artificial consciousness|Artificial Consciousness (AC)]].

==Theory==
ADS-AC uses a system of "points" or "nodes" connected by "links" to create a structure of "knots". The nodes have no properties other than their links to other nodes in order to maintain their absolute dynamicity.
