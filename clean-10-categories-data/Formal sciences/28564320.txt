'''Complex systems biology''' ('''CSB''') is a branch or subfield of [[mathematical and theoretical biology]] invented by [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]] concerned with [[complexity]] of both structure and function in biological organisms, as well as the emergence and evolution of organisms and species, with emphasis being placed on the [[interconnectivity]] of, and within, [[biological network inference]],<ref>Donald Snooks, Graeme, "A general theory of complex living systems: Exploring the demand side of dynamics", ''Complexity'', vol. 13, no. 6, July/August 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baianu | first1 = I.

According to Baianu ''et al''.  CSB is a field that has only a partial overlap with the more conventional concepts of [[complex systems theory]] and [[systems biology]], because CSB is concerned with philosophy and human consciousness. Moreover, [[mathematics]] can model a wide range of [[complex systems]], but this is claimed not to be relevant.<ref name="springerlink">{{cite journal | last1 = Baianu | first1 = I.

According to Rosen, most [[complex system]] models are not about biological subjects, such as [[genome]]s and organisms,<ref name="Rosen" /><ref>^ Heylighen, Francis (2008).

Regarding [[ontology]] (the philosophical [[metaphysics]] of reality), one is assuming that there is a [[hierarchy]] of complexity levels of organization distinct from reality.<ref name="springerlink" /><ref>{{cite journal | author = Poli R | year = 2001a | title = The Basic Problem of the Theory of Levels of Reality | journal = Axiomathes | volume = 12 | issue = 3–4| pages = 261–283 | doi = 10.1023/A:1015845217681 | s2cid = 55743057 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Poli R | year = 1998 | title = Levels | journal = Axiomathes | volume = 9 | issue = 1–2| pages = 197–211 | doi=10.1007/bf02681712| pmid = 8053082 }}</ref> 

Baianu ''et al''. claim that taxonomic ranks such as [[Order (biology)|order]], [[Family (biology)|family]], [[genus]], [[species]], etc. reflect a hierarchy of complexity levels of organization in biology.<ref name="springerlink" />

Because of their variability, ability to heal and self-reproduce, and so on, organisms are defined as '[[meta-system]]s' of simpler systems in CSB.<ref name="springerlink" /><ref name=Metasystem>[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/MST.html Metasystem Transition Theory], [[Valentin Turchin]], [[Cliff Joslyn]], 1993-1997</ref> A meta-system is a system of systems.<ref name=Metasystem/> [[Autopoiesis]] also models such a biological system of systems,<ref>[http://archonic.net Reflexive Autopoietic Systems Theory]</ref> however, Baianu ''et al''. claim that in biology a meta-system is not equivalent to such a system of systems.<ref name="springerlink" /> They also claim it differs from the meta-system defined in a blog by Kent D.
