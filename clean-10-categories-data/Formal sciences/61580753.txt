'''Computational Politics''' is the intersection between [[computer science]] and [[political science]]. The area involves the usage of computational method such as analysis tools, prediction methods to present the solutions to political sciences questions. Researchers in this area use large sets of data to study user behavior.<ref>{{cite document |last1=Winston |first1=Patrick H. |last2=Finlayson |first2=Mark A. |s2cid=7589841 |title=Computational Politics }}</ref> Common examples of such works are building a [[Statistical classification|classifier]] to predict users' political bias in [[social media]] or finding political bias in the news. This discipline is closely related with [[Digital sociology|Digital Sociology]]. However, the main focus is on political related problems and analysis.

Computational politics is often discussed together with policy and [[Social engineering (political science)|public opinion engineering]]. Ashu M. G. Solo highlights the need of technocracy in democratic process where decision makers can make decision, e.g. where and how to spend the campaign money<ref>Solo, Ashu MG.
