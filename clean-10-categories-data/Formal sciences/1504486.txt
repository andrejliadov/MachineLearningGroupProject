'''Scientific formalism''' is a family of approaches to the presentation of [[science]]. It is viewed as an important part of the [[scientific method]], especially in the [[physical sciences]].

==Levels of formalism==

There are multiple levels of scientific formalism possible. At the lowest level, scientific formalism deals with the symbolic manner in which the information is presented. To achieve formalism in a [[scientific theory]] at this level, one starts with a well defined set of [[axiom]]s, and from this follows a [[formal system]].

However, at a higher level, scientific formalism also involves consideration of the axioms themselves. These can be viewed as questions of [[ontology]]. For example, one can, at the lower level of formalism, define a [[property (philosophy)|property]] called 'existence'. However, at the higher level, the question of whether an [[electron]] exists in the same sense that a [[bacterium]] exists still needs to be resolved.

Some actual formal theories on [[fact]]s have been proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/facts/formal-theories.html|title=Facts > Some Formal Theories in the Literature (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|website=plato.stanford.edu|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref>

==In modern physics==

The scientific climate of the twentieth century revived these questions. From about the time of [[Isaac Newton]] to that of [[James Clerk Maxwell]] they had been dormant, in the sense that the physical sciences could rely on the status of the [[real number]]s as a description of the [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], and an agnostic view of [[atom]]s and their structure. [[Quantum mechanics]], the dominant physical theory after about 1925, was formulated in a way which raised questions of both types.

In the [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian]] framework there was indeed a degree of comfort in the answers one could give. Consider for example the question of whether the [[Earth]] really goes round the [[Sun]]. In a [[frame of reference]] adapted to calculating the Earth's orbit, this is a mathematical but also tautological statement. [[Newtonian mechanics]] can answer the question, whether it is not equally the case that the Sun goes round the Earth, as it indeed appears to Earth-based astronomers. In Newton's theory there is a basic, fixed frame of reference that is [[inertial]]. The 'correct answer' is that the point of view of an observer in an inertial frame of reference is privileged: other observers see artifacts of their acceleration relative to an inertial frame (the [[Fictitious force|inertial forces]]). Before Newton, [[Galileo]] would draw the consequences, from the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] [[heliocentric]] model. He was, however, constrained to call his work (in effect) scientific formalism, under the old 'description' '''saving the phenomena'''. To avoid going against authority, the elliptic orbits of the heliocentric model could be labelled as a more convenient device for calculations, rather than an actual description of reality.

In [[general relativity]], Newton's inertial frames are no longer privileged. In quantum mechanics, [[Paul Dirac]] argued that physical models were not there to provide semantic constructs allowing us to ''understand'' microscopic physics in language comparable to that we use on the familiar scale of everyday objects. His attitude, adopted by many [[theoretical physicist]]s, is that a good model is judged by our capacity to use it to calculate physical quantities that can be tested experimentally. Dirac's view is close to what [[Bas van Fraassen]] calls [[constructive empiricism]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/constructive-empiricism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Bradley|last1=Monton|first2=Chad|last2=Mohler|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=19 April 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=19 April 2018|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>

==Duhem==
A physicist who took the issues involved seriously was [[Pierre Duhem]], writing at the beginning of the twentieth century. He wrote an extended analysis of the approach he saw as characteristically British, in requiring [[field theory (physics)|field theories]] of theoretical physics to have a mechanical-physical interpretation. That was an accurate characterisation of what Dirac (himself British) would later argue against. The national characteristics specified by Duhem do not need to be taken too seriously, since he also claimed that the use of [[abstract algebra]], namely [[quaternion]]s, was also characteristically British (as opposed to French or German); as if the use of [[classical analysis]] methods alone was important one way or the other.

Duhem also wrote on saving the phenomena. In addition to the [[Copernican revolution]] debate of "saving the phenomena" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: σῴζειν τὰ φαινόμενα, ''sozein ta phainomena''<ref name= "sozein ta phainomena">An ancient view (attributed to [[Plato]] by [[Simplicius of Cilicia]]) on hypotheses, theories and phaenomena, on what scientists, or more historically accurately (ancient) astronomers, are for, are supposed to do; see

<blockquote>Reason may be employed in two ways to establish a point: firstly, for the purpose of furnishing sufficient proof of some principle [...]. Reason is employed in another way, not as furnishing a sufficient proof of a principle, but as confirming an already established principle, by showing the congruity of its results, as in astronomy the theory of [[Deferent and epicycle|eccentrics and epicycles]] is considered as established, because thereby the sensible appearances of the heavenly movements can be explained (''possunt salvari apparentia sensibilia''); not, however, as if this proof were sufficient, forasmuch as some other theory might explain them.

The idea that a physical interpretation—in common language or classical ideas and physical entities, though of or examined in an ontological or quasi-ontological sense—of a phenomenon in physics is not an ultimate or necessary condition for its understanding or validity, also appears in modern [[Structural realism (philosophy of science)|structural realist]] views on science.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/structural-realism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=James|last=Ladyman|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=19 April 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=19 April 2018|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>

Modern physicist [[Pierre Duhem]] "suggests that in one respect, at least, Bellarmine had shown himself a better scientist than Galileo by disallowing the possibility of a 'strict proof of the earth's motion,' on the grounds that an astronomical theory merely 'saves the appearances' without necessarily revealing what 'really happens.'"<ref>*{{Cite encyclopedia
