{{United States patent law}}
In [[United States patent law]], a '''method''', also called "process", is one of the four principal categories of things that may be patented through "utility patents".  The other three are a [[machine (patent)|machine]], an [[article of manufacture]] (also termed a ''manufacture''), and a [[composition of matter]].<ref name="types">{{cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/patdesc.htm |title=Types of Patents |author= |date=1 June 2000 |work=Technology Assessment and Forecast data base |publisher=USPTO |quote=Utility Patent- Issued for the invention of a new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, (...) |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref>

In that context, a method is a series of steps for performing a function or accomplishing a result.<ref>See Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 70 (1972) ("A process is a mode of treatment of certain materials to produce a given result. It is an act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing."). See also In re Kollar, 286 F.3d 1326, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("[A] process...consists of a series of acts or steps.... It consists of doing something, and therefore has to be carried out or performed.").</ref> While the terms ''method'' and ''process'' are largely interchangeable,<ref>section 100(b) of the US patent act, 35 U.S.C. sec. 100(b), states that "[t]he term 'process' means process, art, or method, and includes a new use of a known process. . . ."</ref> ''method'' usually refers to a way to use a product to accomplish a given result, and ''process'' usually refers to a series of steps in manufacture. Thus, one might speak about a method for curing headaches that comprises the administration of a therapeutically effective dose of aspirin or speak about a process for making soap or candles.

Not all methods, in the dictionary sense, are methods for purposes of United States patent law. The [[case law]] "forecloses a purely literal reading of ยง 101."<ref>[[Parker v. Flook]], 437 U.S. 584, 589 (1978). In [[Gottschalk v. Benson]], 409 U.S. 63, 64 (1973), the Court said, "The question is whether the method described and claimed is a 'process' within the meaning of the Patent Act." See also [[In re Bilski]] ("But the Supreme Court has held that the meaning of 'process' as used in ยง 101 is narrower than its ordinary meaning.").</ref> The concept is elaborated in the article [[machine-or-transformation test]].

A method patent claim can only be infringed when a single person or entity (including contractually obligated agents, if any) practices all of the claimed steps.<ref>"[A] method claim is only infringed when a single party can be charged with performing each step of the asserted claim."  Muniauction v. Thomson Corp. and i-Deal, (Fed. Cir. 2008) [http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-1485.pdf opinion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527115237/http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions/07-1485.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }}</ref> Neither a physical device, such as a product that can be used to practice the method, nor instructions for practicing the method, are infringing until they are used by a single person to perform all the steps together.  A potential exception to this rule for indirect infringement was implicit in the circuit court of appeal's ruling in Akamai Tech. v. Limelight Networks (Fed. Cir. 2012).<ref>Akamai Tech. v. Limelight Networks (Fed. Cir. 2012) [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2012/09/04/cafcs-joint-infringement-conundrum-p1/id=27774/ ipwatchdog review of decision]</ref> The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the circuit court's ruling on Monday, June 2, 2014 (docket number 12-786), holding that the circuit court had misread patent law to reach its decision. The court noted that the statute explicitly defines a method patent to cover only the entirety of the method, and doesn't confer any rights in the individual steps that make up the method.<ref>Akamai Tech. v. Limelight Networks (S.C.o.t.U.S. docket #12-786) [https://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2013/2013_12_786 LIMELIGHT NETWORKS v. AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES]</ref>

The European Patent Convention does not mention method patents (called process patents) so prominently, and the same applies to the TRIPS Agreement. The prime characteristic of process patents in these treaties is that "the protection conferred by the patent shall extend to the products directly obtained by such process".<ref>{{EPC Article|64|2}}</ref> Art. 28(1)(b) TRIPS provides a similar rule. This shows the historical background of process patents in chemistry, where there was a need to protect new processes to manufacture known substances.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}
