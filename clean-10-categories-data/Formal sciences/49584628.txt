==Background==
The Bornhuetter–Ferguson method was introduced in the 1972 paper "The Actuary and IBNR," co-authored by Ron Bornhuetter and Ron Ferguson.<ref name=variance /><ref name=fried /><ref name=bfpaper>https://www.casact.org/pubs/proceed/proceed72/72181.pdf</ref><ref name=investopedia>http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bornhuetterferguson-technique.asp</ref>

Like other loss reserving techniques, the Bornhuetter–Ferguson method aims to estimate [[incurred but not reported]] insurance claim amounts. It is primarily used in the [[general insurance|property and casualty]]<ref name=fried /><ref name=wm /> and [[health insurance]]<ref name=soa /> fields.

Generally considered a blend of the [[chain-ladder method|chain-ladder]] and expected claims loss reserving methods,<ref name=soa /><ref name=investopedia /><ref name=variance2 /> the Bornhuetter–Ferguson method uses both reported or paid losses as well as an [[a priori probability|''a priori'']] expected [[loss ratio]] to arrive at an ultimate loss estimate.<ref name=soa /><ref name=wm>https://www.casact.org/library/studynotes/Werner_Modlin_Ratemaking.pdf</ref> Simply, reported (or paid) losses are added to ''a priori'' expected losses multiplied by an estimated percent unreported. The estimated percent unreported (or unpaid) is established by observing historical claims experience.<ref name=soa />

The Bornhuetter–Ferguson method can be used with either reported or paid losses.<ref name=soa /><ref name=fried />

==Methodology==

There are two algebraically equivalent approaches to calculating the Bornhuetter–Ferguson ultimate loss.

In the first approach, undeveloped reported (or paid) losses are added directly to expected losses (based on an ''a priori'' loss ratio) multiplied by an estimated percent unreported.

In the second approach, reported (or paid) losses are first developed to ultimate using a chain-ladder approach and applying a [[loss development factor]] (LDF). Next, the chain-ladder ultimate is multiplied by an estimated percent reported. Finally, expected losses multiplied by an estimated percent unreported are added (as in the first approach).

<math>\mathrm{BF} = L \cdot \mathrm{LDF} \cdot w + \mathrm{ELR} \cdot \mathrm{Exposure} \cdot (1 - w)</math><ref name=soa /><ref name=fried />

The estimated percent reported is the reciprocal of the loss development factor.<ref name=soa /><ref name=fried />

[[Incurred but not reported]] claims can then be determined by subtracting reported losses from the Bornhuetter–Ferguson ultimate loss estimate.
