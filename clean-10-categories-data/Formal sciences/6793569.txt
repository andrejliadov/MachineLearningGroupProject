'''Align-m''' is a [[multiple sequence alignment]] program written by Ivo Van Walle.

Align-m has the ability to accomplish the following tasks:
* multiple sequence alignment,
* include extra information to guide the sequence alignment,
* multiple [[structural alignment]],
* [[homology modeling]] by (iteratively) combining sequence and structure alignment data,
* 'filtering' of [[BLAST]] or other pairwise alignments,
* combining many alignments into one [[consensus sequence]],
* multiple genome alignment (can cope with rearrangements).
