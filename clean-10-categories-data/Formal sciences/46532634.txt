'''Learning Lab (LL)''' is a [[research]] [[methodology]] developed in 2011 by [[Aydin Bal]]  that provides [[research]]-based guidelines for local stakeholders to develop productive [[family]]-[[school]]-community partnerships and design [[behavioral support]] systems that are culturally responsive to diverse needs, strengths, practices, and goals of all stakeholders within a local school community.<ref>Bal, A. (2011).

Madison, WI: Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction.</ref> The Learning Lab builds organizational capacity in schools and [[school district]]s by forming an inclusive problem solving team of multiple local stakeholders ([[teacher]]s, education leaders, families, [[student]]s, and local community representatives). In Learning Labs, local stakeholders, specifically those who are historically marginalized from schools’ decision-making activities, collectively examine disparities in behavioral outcomes in their local schools and develop solutions through systemic transformation.
 
The Learning Lab methodology was adapted from the change laboratory methodology and is grounded in [[Cultural-historical activity theory|Cultural Historical Activity Theory]].<ref>Engeström, Y.

The goal of the Learning Lab methodology is to facilitate collective agency among local stakeholders who develop locally meaningful, socially just, and sustainable systemic solutions to [[educational equity]] issues such as racial disproportionality in exclusionary and punitive [[School discipline|school disciplinary actions]] (e.g., detention, [[Suspension_(punishment)|suspension]], and [[expulsion (education)|expulsion]]).<ref>http://www.niusileadscape.org/bl/aydin-bal/</ref>

In the [[CRPBIS|Culturally Responsive Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports Project]], the Learning Lab has been implemented at urban pre [[kindergarten|K]]-[[twelfth grade|12]] schools in the [[United States]]. The Learning Lab was found to successfully facilitate and sustain authentic partnerships among local stakeholders that renovated their schoolwide behavioral support systems to be positive, inclusive and culturally responsive.<ref>Bal, A., Schrader, E., Afacan, K., Mawene, D., Cakir, H., Olsen, R., & Thiel, M., & Pryor, E.
