'''Antepredicaments''', in [[logic]], are certain previous matters requisite to a more easy and clear apprehension of the doctrine of ''predicaments'' or [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]]. Such are definitions of common terms, as [[Equivocation|equivocal]]s, [[univocal]]s, etc., with divisions of things, their differences, etc. They are thus called because [[Aristotle]] treated them before the ''predicaments'', hoping that the thread of discourse might not afterwards be interrupted.
