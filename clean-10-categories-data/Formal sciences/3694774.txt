'''Formal science''' is a [[branch of science]] studying [[formal language]] disciplines concerned with [[formal system]]s, such as [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[information theory]], [[game theory]], [[systems theory]], [[decision theory]], and [[theoretical linguistics]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=American Mathematical Society |author-link1=American Mathematical Society |title=MSC2010 database |url=https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/msc2010.html |website=mathscinet.ams.org |accessdate=17 May 2019}}</ref>   Whereas the [[natural science]]s and [[social science]]s seek to characterize [[physical systems]] and [[social system]]s, respectively, using empirical methods, the formal sciences are language [[tools]] concerned with characterizing abstract structures described by [[sign systems|symbolic systems]]. The formal sciences aid the natural and social sciences by providing information about the structures the latter use to describe the world, and what inferences may be made about them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Etymology==
The modern usage of the term ''formal sciences'', in English-language literature, occurs at least as early as 1860,{{Primary source inline|date=December 2020}} in a posthumous publication of lectures on philosophy by [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]] wherein logic and mathematics are listed as formal sciences.<ref>Hamilton, William. ''Lectures on metaphysics and logic''. 1860. Ed. Henry Longueville Mansel & John Veitch, pub. Gould and Lincoln. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hnuj33&view=1up&seq=84&q1=formal%20science Vol. 4, pp. 64–65]. "Formal truth will, therefore, be of two kinds,—Logical and Mathematical. […] The case is the same with the other formal science, the science of Quantity, or Mathematics."</ref> Going even further back, to 1819, a German-language textbook on logic was published by [[Wilhelm Esser]], elucidating the significance of the designation ''formal science'' (''Formalwissenschaft'') as applied to logic;<ref>Esser, Wilhelm. ''Logik'', § 3, pp. 5–6. Cf. ''et seq''. 2d edit. 1819.—Ed. Krug, ''Denklehre oder Logik'', § 8, p. 17</ref> an English-language translation of it is provided in William Hamilton's lecture:

{{quotation|Logic thus obtains, in common parlance, the appellation of a formal science, not indeed in the sense as if Logic had only a form and not an object, but simply because the form of human thought is the object of Logic; so that the title ''formal science'' is properly only an abbreviated expression.<ref> Hamilton, William. ''Lectures on metaphysics and logic''. 1860. Ed. Henry Longueville Mansel & John Veitch, pub. Gould and Lincoln. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t3707z04z&view=1up&seq=35&q1=formal%20science Vol. 3, p. 17]</ref>}}

==History==
Formal sciences began before the formulation of the [[scientific method]], with the most ancient [[Mathematics|mathematical]] texts dating back to 1800&nbsp;BC ([[Babylonian mathematics]]), 1600&nbsp;BC ([[Egyptian mathematics]]) and 1000&nbsp;BC ([[Indian mathematics]]). From then on different cultures such as the [[Greek mathematics|Greek]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab and Persian]] made major contributions to mathematics, while the [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese]] and [[Japanese mathematics|Japanese]], independently of more distant cultures, developed their own mathematical tradition.

Besides mathematics, [[logic]] is another example of one of oldest subjects in the field of the formal sciences. As an explicit analysis of the methods of reasoning, logic received sustained development originally in three places: [[Indian logic|India]] from the {{nowrap|6th century BC}}, [[Logic in China|China]] in the {{nowrap|5th century BC}}, and [[Term logic|Greece]] between the {{nowrap|4th century BC}} and the {{nowrap|1st century BC}}. The formally sophisticated treatment of modern logic descends from the Greek tradition, being informed from the transmission of [[Aristotelian logic]], which was then further developed by [[logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logicians]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}. The Indian tradition also continued into the [[early modern period]]. The native Chinese tradition did not survive beyond [[Ancient history|antiquity]], though Indian logic was later adopted in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] China.

As a number of other disciplines of formal science rely heavily on mathematics, they did not exist until mathematics had developed into a relatively advanced level. [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] (1654), and [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1657) started the earliest study of [[probability theory]]. In the early 1800s, [[Gauss]] and [[Laplace]] developed the mathematical theory of [[statistics]], which also explained the use of statistics in insurance and governmental accounting. Mathematical statistics was recognized as a mathematical discipline in the early 20th&nbsp;century.

In the mid-20th century, mathematics was broadened and enriched by the rise of new [[mathematical science]]s and engineering disciplines such as [[operations research]] and [[systems engineering]]. These sciences benefited from basic research in [[electrical engineering]] and then by the development of [[Computer|electrical computing]], which also stimulated [[information theory]], [[numerical analysis]] ([[scientific computing]]), and [[theoretical computer science]]. Theoretical computer science also benefits from the discipline of [[mathematical logic]], which included the [[theory of computation]].

==Differences from other forms of science==
{{quote|One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.|[[Albert Einstein]]<ref>{{cite book |author=Albert Einstein |author-link=Albert Einstein |title=Sidelights on relativity |chapter=Geometry and Experience |page=27 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1923}} Reprinted by Dover (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-486-24511-9}}.</ref>}}

As opposed to empirical sciences (natural and social), the formal sciences do not involve empirical procedures. They also do not presuppose knowledge of contingent facts, or describe the real world. In this sense, formal sciences are both logically and methodologically ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', for their content and validity are independent of any empirical procedures.  

Therefore, straightly speaking, formal science is not a science.  It is a formal logical system with its content targeted at the real things, information and thoughts that we experienced.  As [[Francis Bacon]] pointed out in the 17th century, experimental verification of the propositions must be carried out rigorously and cannot take logic itself as the way to draw conclusions in nature.  Formal science is a method that is helpful to science but cannot replace science.

Although formal sciences are conceptual systems, lacking empirical content, this does not mean that they have no relation to the real world. But this relation is such that their formal statements hold in all possible conceivable worlds – whereas, statements based on empirical theories, such as, say, [[general relativity]] or [[evolutionary biology]], do not hold in all possible worlds, and may eventually turn out not to hold in this world as well. That is why formal sciences are applicable in all domains and useful in all empirical sciences.

Because of their non-empirical nature, formal sciences are construed by outlining a set of [[axioms]] and [[definitions]] from which other statements ([[theorems]]) are deduced. For this reason, in [[Rudolf Carnap]]'s [[Logical positivism|logical-positivist]] conception of the [[Philosophy of science|epistemology of science]], theories belonging to formal sciences are understood to contain no [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic statements]], being that instead all their statements are [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia
