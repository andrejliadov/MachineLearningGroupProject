'''Qualitative properties''' are properties that are observed and can generally not be measured with a numerical result <ref>https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/qualitative</ref>. They are contrasted to [[Quantitative property|quantitative properties]] which have numerical characteristics.  

Some engineering and scientific properties are qualitative. A [[test method]] can result in qualitative data about something. This can be a categorical result or a [[binary classification]] (e.g., pass/fail, [[go/no go]], [[Conformity|conform]]/non-conform). It can sometimes be an engineering judgement.

The data that all share a qualitative property form a [[nominal category]]. A variable which codes for the presence or absence of such a property is called a binary [[categorical variable]], or equivalently a [[dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]].

==In businesses==
Some important qualitative properties that concern businesses are:

[[Human factors]], '[[human work capital]]' is probably one of the most important issues that deals with qualitative properties. Some common aspects are work, [[motivation]], general participation, etc. Although all of these aspects are not measurable in terms of quantitative criteria, the general overview of them could be summarized as a [[quantitative property]].

[[Environmental issues]] are in some cases quantitatively measurable, but other properties are qualitative e.g.: environmentally friendly [[manufacturing]], responsibility for the entire life of a product (from the raw-material till scrap), attitudes towards safety, efficiency, and minimum waste production. 

[[Ethical issues]] are closely related to environmental and human issues, and may be covered in [[corporate governance]]. [[Child labour]] and [[illegal dumping]] of waste are examples of ethical issues.

The way a company deals with its [[Shareholder|stockholders]] (the 'acting' of a company) is probably the most obvious qualitative aspect of a business. Although measuring something in qualitative terms is difficult, most people can (and will) make a judgement about a [[behaviour]] on the basis of how they feel treated. This indicates that qualitative properties are closely related to [[emotional]] impressions.
