The '''current solar income''' of the [[Earth]], or any [[ecoregion]] of the earth, is the amount of [[solar energy]] that falls on it as sunlight.  This is thought important in some branches of [[green economics]], as the ultimate measure of [[renewable energy]].

[[Buckminster Fuller]] first described the concept in his 1970 paper ''[[Cosmic Costing]]'', contrasting the [[photosynthesis]] on which [[natural capital]] and [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[infrastructural capital]] depend, with the [[chemosynthesis]] of extracting and using [[fossil fuel]]s.

[[Paul Hawken]] is a more recent advocate of the concept, and views it as central to his notion of a [[restorative economy]].  It remains a popular notion among those who believe that [[toxic waste]] and maintenance problems of direct [[solar energy]] devices can ultimately be overcome, or that yields of passive or biological means of gathering and using this energy as [[biofuel]]s can be made to approximate those of fossil fuels.
