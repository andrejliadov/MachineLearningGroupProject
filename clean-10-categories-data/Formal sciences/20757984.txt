{{wikt | conformity}}
'''Conformity''' is the act of matching attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to [[social group | group]] [[Norm (social) |norms]], [[politics]] or being like-minded.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cialdini | first1 = R.

People often choose to conform to [[society]] rather than to pursue personal desires - because it is often easier to follow the path others have made already, rather than forging a new one. This tendency to conform occurs in small groups and/or in society as a whole, and may result from subtle unconscious influences (predisposed state of mind), or from direct and overt [[social pressure]]. Conformity can occur in the presence of others, or when an individual is alone. For example, people tend to follow social norms when eating or when watching television, even if alone.

People often{{quantify|date=December 2020}} conform from a desire for [[security]] within a group{{cn|date=December 2020}}—typically a group of a similar age, [[culture]], [[religion]] or educational status. This is often referred to{{by whom?|date=December 2020}} as [[groupthink]]: a pattern of thought characterized by self-deception, forced manufacture of consent, and conformity to group values and [[morality | ethics]], which ignores realistic appraisal of other courses of action. Unwillingness to conform carries the risk of [[social rejection]]. Conformity is often associated{{by whom?|date=December 2020}} with adolescence and [[youth culture]], but strongly affects humans of all ages.<ref>{{cite web|last= McLeod|first= Saul|title= What is Conformity?|website = Simply Psychology|date= 2016 |url = https://www.simplypsychology.org/conformity.html}}</ref>

Although [[peer pressure]] may manifest negatively, conformity can be regarded{{by whom?|date=December 2020}} as either good or bad. Driving on the conventionally-approved side of the road may be seen as beneficial conformity.<ref>{{cite book|last= Aronson|first= E|title= Social Psychology (6th ed.)|year= 2007|publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall|location= Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn= 978-0-13-233487-7|author2= Wilson, T.

In this sense it can be perceived{{by whom?|date=December 2020}} as a positive force that prevents acts that are perceptually disruptive or dangerous.

As conformity is a [[group dynamics |group]] phenomenon, factors such as group size, unanimity, cohesion, [[Social status| status]], prior commitment and [[public opinion]] help determine the level of conformity an individual displays.

== Peer ==
Some adolescents gain acceptance and recognition from their peers by conformity. This peer moderated conformity increases from the transition of childhood to adolescence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Bradford|title=Perceptions of peer pressure, peer conformity dispositions, and self-reported behavior among adolescents|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1986|volume=22|issue=4|pages=521–530|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.22.4.521}}</ref> It follows a U-shaped age pattern wherein conformity increases through childhood, peaking at sixth and ninth grades and then declines.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of School Psychology|last1=Watson|first1=T.

== Social responses ==
According to [[Donelson Forsyth]], after submitting to group pressures, individuals may find themselves facing one of several responses to conformity. These types of responses to conformity vary in their degree of public agreement versus private agreement.

When an individual finds themselves in a position where they publicly agree with the group's decision yet privately disagrees with the group's consensus, they are experiencing ''compliance'' or ''acquiescence''.  In turn, ''conversion'', otherwise known as ''private acceptance'', involves both publicly and privately agreeing with the group's decision. Thus, this represents a true change of opinion to match the majority.

Another type of social response, which does not involve conformity with the majority of the group, is called ''convergence''. In this type of social response, the group member agrees with the group's decision from the outset and thus does not need to shift their opinion on the matter at hand.<ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009">{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D. R.|title=Group dynamics|year=2013|publisher=Wadsworth|location=New York|isbn=978-1-133-95653-2}} [Chapter 7]</ref>

In addition, Forsyth shows that nonconformity can also fall into one of two response categories. Firstly, an individual who does not conform to the majority can display ''independence''. ''Independence'', or ''dissent'', can be defined as the unwillingness to bend to group pressures. Thus, this individual stays true to his or her personal standards instead of the swaying toward group standards. Secondly, a nonconformist could be displaying ''[[Anticonformity (psychology)|anticonformity]]'' or ''counterconformity'' which involves the taking of opinions that are opposite to what the group believes. This type of nonconformity can be motivated by a need to rebel against the status quo instead of the need to be accurate in one's opinion.

To conclude, social responses to conformity can be seen to vary along a continuum from conversion to anticonformity. For example, a popular experiment in conformity research, known as the ''Asch situation'' or [[Asch conformity experiments]], primarily includes ''compliance'' and ''independence''. Also, other responses to conformity can be identified in groups such as juries, sports teams and work teams.<ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2009" />

== Main experiments ==

=== Sherif's experiment (1936) ===
Muzafer Sherif was interested in knowing how many people would change their opinions to bring them in line with the opinion of a group. In his experiment, participants were placed in a dark room and asked to stare at a small dot of light 15 feet away. They were then asked to estimate the amount it moved. The trick was there was no movement, it was caused by a visual illusion known as the [[autokinetic effect]]. On the first day, each person perceived different amounts of movement, but from the second to the fourth day, the same estimate was agreed on and others conformed to it.<ref name="Hogg 2005">{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=M. A.|title=Social psychology|year=2005|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Harlow|author2=Vaughan, G. M.}}</ref> Sherif suggested this was a simulation for how social norms develop in a society, providing a common frame of reference for people.

Subsequent experiments were based on more realistic situations. In an eyewitness identification task, participants were shown a suspect individually and then in a lineup of other suspects. They were given one second to identify him, making it a difficult task. One group was told that their input was very important and would be used by the legal community. To the other it was simply a trial. Being more motivated to get the right answer increased the tendency to conform. Those who wanted to be more accurate conformed 51% of the time as opposed to 35% in the other group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=R. S. |author2=Vandello, J. A. |author3=Brunsman, B.|title=The forgotten variable in conformity research: Impact of task importance on social influence|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1996|volume=71|issue=5|pages=915–927|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.5.915}}</ref>

=== Asch's experiment (1951) ===
{{Main|Asch conformity experiments}}

[[File:Asch experiment.png|thumb|250px|Which line matches the first line, A, B, or C? In the [[Asch conformity experiments]], people frequently followed the majority judgment, even when the majority was wrong.]]
Solomon E. Asch conducted a modification of Sherif's study, assuming that when the situation was very clear, conformity would be drastically reduced. He exposed people in a group to a series of lines, and the participants were asked to match one line with a standard line. All participants except one were accomplices and gave the wrong answer in 12 of the 18 trials.<ref name="Asch 1955 31–35" />

The results showed a surprisingly high degree of conformity: 74% of the participants conformed on at least one trial. On average people conformed one third of the time.<ref name="Asch 1955 31–35">{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=S. E.|title=Opinions and Social Pressure|journal=Scientific American|year=1955|volume=193|issue=5|pages=31–35|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31|bibcode=1955SciAm.193e..31A}}</ref> A question is how the group would affect individuals in a situation where the correct answer is less obvious.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guimond|first=S|title=Psychologie Sociale : Perspective Multiculturelle|year=2010|publisher=Mardaga|location=Warve|pages=19–28}}</ref>

After his first test, Asch wanted to investigate whether the size or unanimity of the majority had greater influence on test subjects.
"Which aspect of the influence of a majority is more important – the size of the majority or its unanimity? The experiment was modified to examine this question. In one series the size of the opposition was varied from one to 15 persons."<ref>{{cite book|last=Asch|first=S. E.|title=Social Psychology|url=https://archive.org/details/socialpsychology00asch|url-access=registration|year=1952|publisher=Prentice Hal|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ}}</ref> The results clearly showed that as more people opposed the subject, the subject became more likely to conform. However, the increasing majority was only influential up to a point: from three or more opponents, there is more than 30% of conformity.<ref name="Asch 1955 31–35" />

Besides that, this experiment proved that conformity is powerful, but also fragile. It is powerful because just by having actors giving the wrong answer made the participant to also give the wrong answer, even though they knew it was not correct. It is also fragile, however, because in one of the variants for the experiment, one of the actors was supposed to give the correct answer, being an "ally" to the participant. With an ally, the participant was more likely to give the correct answer than he was before the ally. In addition, if the participant was able to write down the answer, instead of saying out loud, he was also more likely to put the correct answer. The reason for that is because he was not afraid of being different from the rest of the group since the answers were hidden. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Asch|first=S. E.|date=1951|title=Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgment|journal=Groups, Leadership and Men|via=Carnegie Press}}</ref> 

== Varieties ==
Harvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] identified three major types of conformity.<ref name="Kelman 1958 51–60">{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=H. C|s2cid=145642577|title=Compliance, Identification, and Internalization: Three Processes of Attitude Change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|year=1958|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106}}</ref>
* ''[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]]'' is public conformity, while possibly keeping one's own original beliefs for yourself. Compliance is motivated by the need for approval and the fear of being rejected.
* ''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]'' is conforming to someone who is liked and respected, such as a celebrity or a favorite uncle. This can be motivated by the attractiveness of the source,<ref name="Kelman 1958 51–60" /> and this is a deeper type of conformism than compliance.
* ''[[Internalization]]'' is accepting the belief or behavior and conforming both publicly and privately, if the source is credible. It is the deepest influence on people and it will affect them for a long time.

Although Kelman's distinction has been influential, research in [[Social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] has focused primarily on two varieties of conformity. These are ''informational'' conformity, or [[informational social influence]], and ''normative'' conformity, also called [[normative social influence]]. In Kelman's terminology, these correspond to internalization and compliance, respectively. There are naturally more than two or three variables in society influential on human [[psychology]] and conformity; the notion of "varieties" of conformity based upon "social influence" is ambiguous and indefinable in this context.

For Deutsch and Gérard (1955), conformity results from a motivational conflict  (between the fear of being socially rejected and the wish to say what we think is correct) that leads to the normative influence, and a cognitive conflict (others create doubts in what we think) which leads to the informational influence.<ref name="Deutsch 1955 629–636">{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=M|author2=Gérard, H. B|title=A study of normative and informational social influences upon individual judgement|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|year=1955|volume=51|issue=3|pages=629–636|doi=10.1037/h0046408|pmid=13286010}}</ref>

=== Informational influence ===
{{Main|Informational social influence}}
Informational social influence occurs when one turns to the members of one's group to obtain and accept accurate information about reality. A person is most likely to use informational social influence in certain situations: when a situation is ambiguous, people become uncertain about what to do and they are more likely to depend on others for the answer; and during a crisis when immediate action is necessary, in spite of panic. Looking to other people can help ease fears, but unfortunately they are not always right. The more knowledgeable a person is, the more valuable they are as a resource. Thus people often turn to [[expert]]s for help. But once again people must be careful, as experts can make mistakes too. Informational social influence often results in ''internalization'' or ''private acceptance'', where a person genuinely believes that the information is right.<ref name="Hogg 2005" />

=== Normative influence ===
{{Main|Normative social influence}}
Normative social influence occurs when one conforms to be liked or accepted by the members of the group. This need of social approval and acceptance is part of our state of humans.<ref name="Hogg 2005" /> In addition to this, we know that when people do not conform with their group and therefore are deviants, they are less liked and even punished by the group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schachter|first=S|title=Deviation, Rejection, and communication|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1951|volume=46|issue=2|pages=190–208|doi=10.1037/h0062326|pmid=14841000}}</ref> Normative influence usually results in ''public compliance'', doing or saying something without believing in it. The experiment of Asch in 1951 is one example of normative influence. Even though John Turner et al argued that the post experimental interviews showed that the respondents were uncertain about the correct answers in some cases. The answers might have been evident to the experimenters but the participants did not have the same experience. Subsequent studies pointed out the fact that the participants were not known to each other and therefore did not pose a threat against social rejection. See: [[Asch conformity experiments|Normative influence vs. referent informational influence]]

In a reinterpretation of the original data from these [[Asch conformity experiments|experiments]] Hodges and Geyer (2006)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hodges|first=B. H.|author2=Geyer, A. L.|s2cid=24608338|title=A Nonconformist Account of the Asch Experiments: Values, Pragmatics, and Moral Dilemmas|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=2–19|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1001_1|pmid=16430326}}</ref>  found that Asch's subjects were not so conformist after all: The experiments provide powerful evidence for people's tendency to tell the truth even when others do not. They also provide compelling evidence of people's concern for others and their views.
By closely examining the situation in which Asch's subjects find themselves they find that the situation places multiple demands on participants: They include truth (i.e., expressing one's own view accurately), trust (i.e., taking seriously the value of others' claims), and social solidarity (i.e., a commitment to integrate the views of self and others without deprecating either). In addition to these epistemic values, there are multiple moral claims as well: These include the need for participants to care for the integrity and well-being of other participants, the experimenter, themselves, and the worth of scientific research.

Deutsch & Gérard (1955) designed different situations that variated from Asch' experiment and found that when participants were writing their answer privately, they were giving the correct one<ref name="Deutsch 1955 629–636" />

Normative influence, a function of [[social impact theory]], has three components.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Latané|first=B|title=The psychology of social impact|journal=American Psychologist|year=1981|volume=36|issue=4|pages=343–356|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.36.4.343}}</ref> The ''number of people'' in the group has a surprising effect. As the number increases, each person has less of an impact. A group's ''strength'' is how important the group is to a person. Groups we value generally have more social influence. ''Immediacy'' is how close the group is in time and space when the influence is taking place. Psychologists have constructed a mathematical model using these three factors and are able to predict the amount of conformity that occurs with some degree of accuracy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forgas|first=J. P.|title=Social influence: Direct and indirect processes. The Sydney symposium of social psychology|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press.|location=New York|pages=61–76|author2=Williams, K. D}}</ref>

Baron and his colleagues conducted a second ''eyewitness study'' that focused on normative influence. In this version, the task was easier. Each participant had five seconds to look at a slide instead of just one second. Once again, there were both high and low motives to be accurate, but the results were the reverse of the first study. The low motivation group conformed 33% of the time (similar to Asch's findings). The high motivation group conformed less at 16%. These results show that when accuracy is not very important, it is better to get the wrong answer than to risk social disapproval.

An experiment using procedures similar to Asch's found that there was significantly less conformity in six-person groups of [[friend]]s as compared to six-person groups of strangers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKelvey|first=W.|author2=Kerr, N. H.|s2cid=145481141|title=Differences in conformity among friends and strangers|journal=Psychological Reports|year=1988|volume=62|issue=3|pages=759–762|doi=10.2466/pr0.1988.62.3.759}}</ref> Because friends already know and accept each other, there may be less normative pressure to conform in some situations. Field studies on cigarette and alcohol abuse, however, generally demonstrate evidence of friends exerting normative social influence on each other.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Urberg|first=K. A.|author2=Degirmencioglu, S. M. |author3=Pilgrim, C. |title=Close friend and group influence on adolescent cigarette smoking and alcohol use|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1997|volume=33|issue=5|pages=834–844|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.33.5.834|pmid=9300216}}</ref>

== Minority influence ==
{{Main|Minority influence}}
Although conformity generally leads individuals to think and act more like groups, individuals are occasionally able to reverse this tendency and change the people around them. This is known as ''minority influence'', a special case of informational influence. Minority influence is most likely when people can make a clear and consistent case for their point of view. If the minority fluctuates and shows uncertainty, the chance of influence is small. However, a minority that makes a strong, convincing case increases the probability of changing  the majority's beliefs and behaviors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moscovici|first=S. N.|title="Minority influence". Social psychology: Classic and contemporary integrations|year=1974|publisher=Rand McNally|location=Chicago|pages=217–249}}</ref> Minority members who are perceived as experts, are high in status, or have benefited the group in the past are also more likely to succeed.

Another form of minority influence can sometimes override conformity effects and lead to unhealthy group dynamics. A 2007 review of two dozen studies by the University of Washington found that a single "bad apple" (an inconsiderate or negligent group member) can substantially increase conflicts and reduce performance in work groups. Bad apples often create a negative emotional climate that interferes with healthy group functioning. They can be avoided by careful selection procedures and managed by reassigning them to positions that require less social interaction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Felps|first=W|author2=Mitchell, T R. |author3=Byington, E |title=How, When, and Why Bad Apples Spoil the Barrel: Negative Group Members and Dysfunctional|journal=GroupsResearch in Organizational Behavior|year=2006|volume=27|pages=175–222|doi=10.1016/s0191-3085(06)27005-9}}</ref>

== Specific predictors ==

=== Culture ===
[[Stanley Milgram]] found that individuals in Norway (from a collectivistic culture) exhibited a higher degree of conformity than individuals in France (from an individualistic culture).<ref name="Milgram">{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = S | year = 1961 | title = Nationality and conformity | url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | journal = Scientific American | volume = 205 | issue =  6| page = 6 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121004201132/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=milgram-nationality-conformity | archive-date = 2012-10-04 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1261-45 | bibcode = 1961SciAm.205f..45M }}</ref> Similarly, Berry studied two different populations: the Temne (collectivists) and the Inuit (individualists) and found that the Temne conformed more than the Inuit when exposed to a conformity task.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=J W.|title=Independence and conformity in subsistence-level societies|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1967|volume=7|issue=4, Pt.1|pages=415–418|doi=10.1037/h0025231|pmid=6065870}}</ref>

Bond and Smith compared 134 studies in a meta-analysis and found that there is a positive correlation between a country's level of collectivistic values and conformity rates in the Asch paradigm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=M. H|author2=Smith, P. B.|title=Culture and Conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using the Asch's (1952b, 1956) line judgement task|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1996|volume=119|pages=111–137|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}</ref> Bond and Smith also reported that conformity has declined in the United States over time.

Influenced by the writings of late-19th- and early-20th-century Western travelers, scholars or diplomats who visited Japan, such as [[Basil Hall Chamberlain]], [[George Trumbull Ladd]] and [[Percival Lowell]], as well as by [[Ruth Benedict]]'s influential book ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'', many scholars of Japanese studies speculated that there would be a higher propensity to conform in Japanese culture than in American culture. However, this view was not formed on the basis of [[Scientific method|empirical evidence collected in a systematic way]], but rather on the basis of anecdotes and casual observations, which are subject to a variety of [[cognitive bias]]es. Modern scientific studies comparing conformity in Japan and the United States show that Americans conform in general as much as the Japanese and, in some situations, even more. Psychology professor [[:ja:高野陽太郎|Yohtaro Takano]] from the [[University of Tokyo]], along with Eiko Osaka reviewed four behavioral studies and found that the rate of conformity errors that the Japanese subjects manifested in the Asch paradigm was similar with that manifested by Americans.<ref>Takano, Y., & Osaka, E. (1999). An unsupported common view: Comparing Japan and the US on individualism/collectivism. ''Asian Journal of Social Psychology'', ''2''(3), 311-341.</ref> The study published in 1970 by [[Robert Frager]] from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] found that the percentage of conformity errors within the Asch paradigm was significantly lower in Japan than in the United States, especially in the prize condition. Another study published in 2008, which compared the level of conformity among Japanese in-groups (peers from the same college clubs) with that found among Americans found no substantial difference in the level of conformity manifested by the two nations, even in the case of in-groups.<ref>Takano, Y., & Sogon, S.

Societal norms often establish gender differences and researchers have reported differences in the way men and women conform to social influence.<ref name="BondSmith">{{cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = R. | last2 = Smith | first2 = P.B. | year = 1996 | title = Culture and conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using Asch's (1952b, 1956) line judgement task | url = http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/_private/gradsoc_articles/individualism_collectivism/conformity%20and%20culture.pdf | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 119 | issue = 1| pages = 111–137 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}</ref><ref name="Reitan, 1964 45–51">{{cite journal|last=Reitan|first=H|author2=Shaw, M|title=Group Membership, Sex-Composition of the Group, and Conformity Behavior|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|year=1964|volume=64|pages=45–51|doi=10.1080/00224545.1964.9919541|pmid=14217456}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Applezweig|first=M H|title=Conforming behavior and personality variables|year=1958|publisher=Connecticut College|location=New London|author2=Moeller, G}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Beloff|first=H|title=Two forms of social conformity: Acquiescence and conventionality|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1958|volume=56|issue=1|pages=99–104|doi=10.1037/h0046604|pmid=13501978}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Coleman|first=J |author2=Blake, R R |author3=Mouton, J S|title=Task difficulty and conformity pressures|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1958|volume=57|issue=1|pages=120–122|doi=10.1037/h0041274|pmid=13563057 }}</ref><ref name="CooperHM">{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = H.M. | year = 1979 | title = Statistically combining independent studies: A meta-analysis of sex differences in conformity research | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 37 | pages = 131–146 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.37.1.131}}</ref><ref name="Eagly78">{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = A.H. | year = 1978 | title = Sex differences in influenceability | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 85 | pages = 86–116 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.85.1.86}}</ref> For example, Alice Eagly and Linda Carli performed a meta-analysis of 148 studies of influenceability. They found that women are more persuadable and more conforming than men in group pressure situations that involve surveillance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=A. H|author2=Carli, L. L|title=Sex of researchers and sex-typed communications as determinants of sex differences in influenceability: A meta-analysis of social influence studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1981|volume=90|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.90.1.1}}</ref> Eagly has proposed that this sex difference may be due to different sex roles in society.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eagly|first=A. H.|title=Sex differences in social behavior: A social role interpretation|year=1987|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ}}</ref> Women are generally taught to be more agreeable whereas men are taught to be more independent.

The composition of the group plays a role in conformity as well. In a study by Reitan and Shaw, it was found that men and women conformed more when there were participants of both sexes involved versus participants of the same sex. Subjects in the groups with both sexes were more apprehensive when there was a discrepancy amongst group members, and thus the subjects reported that they doubted their own judgments.<ref name="Reitan, 1964 45–51" />
Sistrunk and McDavid made the argument that women conformed more because of a methodological bias.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sistrunk|first=F|author2=McDavid, J. W|title=Sex variable in conforming behavior|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1971|volume=17|issue=2|pages=200–207|doi=10.1037/h0030382}}</ref> They argued that because stereotypes used in studies are generally male ones (sports, cars..) more than female ones (cooking, fashion..), women are feeling uncertain and conformed more, which was confirmed by their results.

=== Age ===
Research has noted age differences in conformity. For example, research with Australian children and adolescents ages 3 to 17 discovered that conformity decreases with age.<ref name="WalkerMB">{{Cite journal

}}</ref> The results revealed a similar trend&nbsp;– older participants displayed less conformity when compared to younger participants.

In the same way that gender has been viewed as corresponding to status, age has also been argued to have status implications. Berger, Rosenholtz and Zelditch suggest that age as a status role can be observed among college students. Younger students, such as those in their first year in college, are treated as lower-status individuals and older college students are treated as higher-status individuals.<ref name="Berger1980">{{cite journal | last1 = Berger | first1 = J. | last2 = Rosenholtz | first2 = S.J. | last3 = Zelditch | first3 = M. | year = 1980 | title = Status organizing processes | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 6 | pages = 479–508 | doi=10.1146/annurev.so.06.080180.002403}}</ref> Therefore, given these status roles, it would be expected that younger individuals (low status) conform to the majority whereas older individuals (high status) would be expected not to conform <ref name="Eagly1982" />

Researchers have also reported an interaction of gender and age on conformity.<ref name="Eagly1980">{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Chrvala | first2 = C. | s2cid = 146308947 | year = 1980 | title = Sex differences in conformity: Status and gender role interpretations | url = http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ344964&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ344964 | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 203–220 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1986.tb00747.x }}</ref> Eagly and Chrvala examined the role of age (under 19 years vs. 19 years and older), gender and surveillance (anticipating responses to be shared with group members vs. not anticipating responses being shared) on conformity to group opinions. They discovered that among participants that were 19 years or older, females conformed to group opinions more so than males when under surveillance (i.e., anticipated that their responses would be shared with group members). However, there were no gender differences in conformity among participants who were under 19 years of age and in surveillance conditions. There were also no gender differences when participants were not under surveillance. In a subsequent research article, Eagly suggests that women are more likely to conform than men because of lower status roles of women in society. She suggests that more submissive roles (i.e., conforming) are expected of individuals that hold low status roles.<ref name="Eagly1982">{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Wood | first2 = W. | year = 1982 | title = Inferred sex differences in status as a determinant of gender stereotypes about social influence | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 5| pages = 915–928 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.5.915}}</ref>  Still, Eagly and Chrvala's results do conflict with previous research which have found higher conformity levels among younger rather than older individuals.

=== Size of the group ===
Although conformity pressures generally increase as the size of the majority increases, a meta-analysis suggests that conformity pressures in Asch's experiment peak once the majority reaches about four or five in number.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bond | first1 = R. | last2 = Smith | first2 = P. B. | year = 1996 | title = Culture and conformity: A meta-analysis of studies using Asch's (1952b, 1956) Line Judgement task | url = http://www.radford.edu/~jaspelme/_private/gradsoc_articles/individualism_collectivism/conformity%20and%20culture.pdf | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 119 | pages = 111–137 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}</ref> Moreover, a study suggests that the effects of group size depend on the type of social influence operating.<ref name = Campbell1989>{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = J. D. | last2 = Fairey | first2 = P. J. | year = 1989 | title = Informational and normative routes to conformity: The effect of faction size as a function of norm extremity and attention to the stimulus | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 457–468 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.57.3.457}}</ref> This means that in situations where the group is clearly wrong, conformity will be motivated by normative influence; the participants will conform in order to be accepted by the group. A participant may not feel much pressure to conform when the first person gives an incorrect response. However, conformity pressure will increase as each additional group member also gives the same incorrect response.<ref name = Campbell1989 />

=== Different stimuli ===
In 1961 Stanley Milgram published a study in which he utilized Asch's conformity paradigm using audio tones instead of lines; he conducted his study in Norway and France.<ref name="Milgram" /> He found substantially higher levels of conformity than Asch, with participants conforming 50% of the time in France and 62% of the time in Norway during critical trials. Milgram also conducted the same experiment once more, but told participants that the results of the study would be applied to the design of aircraft safety signals. His conformity estimates were 56% in Norway and 46% in France, suggesting that individuals conformed slightly less when the task was linked to an important issue. Stanley Milgram's study demonstrated that Asch's study could be replicated with other stimuli, and that in the case of tones, there was a high degree of conformity.

=== Neural correlates ===
Evidence has been found for the involvement of the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) in conformity,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Izuma | first1 = K | s2cid = 12160803 | year = 2013 | title = The neural basis of social influence and attitude change | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 456–462 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2013.03.009 | pmid = 23608704 }}</ref> an area associated with memory and decision-making. For example, Klucharev et al.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Klucharev | first1 = V. | last2 = Munneke | first2 = M. A. | last3 = Smidts | first3 = A. | last4 = Fernández | first4 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Downregulation of the posterior medial frontal cortex prevents social conformity | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 31 | issue = 33| pages = 11934–11940 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1869-11.2011 | pmid = 21849554 | pmc = 6623179 }}</ref> revealed in their study that by using repetitive [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] on the pMFC, participants reduced their tendency to conform to the group, suggesting a causal role for the brain region in social conformity.

Neuroscience has also shown how people quickly develop similar values for things. Opinions of others immediately change the brain's reward response in the [[ventral striatum]] to receiving or losing the object in question, in proportion to how susceptible the person is to social influence. Having similar opinions to others can also generate a reward response.<ref name="How the opinion of others affects o"/>

The [[amygdala]] and [[hippocampus]] have also been found to be recruited when individuals participated in a social manipulation experiment involving long-term memory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Edelson | first1 = M. | last2 = Sharot | first2 = T. | last3 = Dolan | first3 = R.

In particular, Charpentier et al. found that the OFC mirrors the exposure to social influence at a subsequent time point, when a decision is being made without the social influence being present. The tendency to conform has also been observed in the structure of the OFC, with a greater [[grey matter]] volume in high conformers.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Campbell-Meiklejohn | first1 = D.
