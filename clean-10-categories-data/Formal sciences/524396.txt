'''Ecosystem diversity''' deals with the variations in [[ecosystem]]s within a [[geographical location]] and its overall impact on human existence and the [[environmental impact|environment]].

Ecosystem diversity addresses the combined characteristics of [[Biotic component|biotic]] properties ([[biodiversity]]) and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] properties ([[geodiversity]]). It is the variation in the [[ecosystems]] found in a region or the variation in ecosystems over the whole planet. Ecological diversity includes the variation in both [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. Ecological diversity can also take into account the variation in the [[complexity]] of a [[biological community]], including the number of different [[ecological niche|niches]], the number of [[trophic level]]s and other ecological processes. An example of ecological diversity on a global scale would be the variation in ecosystems, such as [[desert]]s, [[forest]]s, [[grassland]]s, [[wetland]]s and [[ocean]]s. Ecological diversity is the largest scale of biodiversity, and within each ecosystem, there is a great deal of both [[Species diversity|species]] and [[genetic diversity]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Margaret|last= Cunningham|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-biodiversity-definition-and-relation-to-ecosystem-stability.html|website=study.com|series= DSST Environment & Humanity: Study Guide & Test Prep |title=What is Biodiversity? - Definition and Relation to Ecosystem Stability|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|year=2009|chapter=Ecosystems|chapter-url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GVRL&sw=w&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CCX3233900080&asid=ece573364e176588534845e3350339a7|title=Environmental Science: In context|series=In Context Series |volume=1|pages=242–246|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|oclc=277051356|isbn=978-1-4103-3754-2

== Impact ==

Diversity in the ecosystem is significant to human existence for a variety of reasons. Ecosystem diversity boosts the availability of [[oxygen]] via the process of [[photosynthesis]] amongst plant organisms domiciled in the habitat. Diversity In an aquatic environment helps in the [[water purification|purification of water]] by plant varieties for use by humans. Diversity increases plant varieties which serves as a good source for medicines and [[herb]]s for human use.  A lack of diversity in the ecosystem produces an opposite result.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Naveh|first=Z.|date=1994-09-01|title=From Biodiversity to Ecodiversity: A Landscape-Ecology Approach to Conservation and Restoration|journal=Restoration Ecology|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=180–189|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.1994.tb00065.x|issn=1526-100X}}</ref>

== Examples ==
Some examples of ecosystems that are rich in diversity are:
* [[Desert]]s
* [[Forest]]s
* [[Large marine ecosystem]]s
* [[Marine ecosystem]]s
* [[Old-growth forest]]s
* [[Rainforest]]s
* [[Tundra]]
* [[Coral reef]]s
* [[Marine biology|Marine]]

== Ecosystem diversity as a result of evolutionary pressure ==
Ecological diversity around the world can be directly linked to the evolutionary and [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressures]] that constrain the [[Diversity index|diversity]] outcome of the ecosystems within different [[Niche segregation|niches]]. [[Tundra]]s, [[Rainforest]]s, coral reefs and [[deciduous forests]] all are formed as a result of [[evolutionary pressure]]s. Even seemingly small evolutionary interactions can have large impacts on the diversity of the [[ecosystem]]s throughout the world. One of the best studied cases of this is of the honey bee's interaction with [[Flowering plant|angiosperms]] on every continent in the world except [[Antarctica]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://animals.mom.me/continents-bees-not-found-5374.html|title=On What Continents Are Bees Not Found?|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}</ref>

In 2010 Robert Brodschneider, and Karl Crailsheim conducted a study about the health and nutrition in honey bee colonies, the study conducted focused on: overall colony health, adult nutrition, and [[larva]] nutrition as a function of the effect of [[pesticide]]s, [[monoculture]]s and genetically modified crops to see if the anthropogenically created problems can have an effect pollination levels.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brodschneider|first=Robert|date=2010|title=Nutrition and health in Honey bees|url=https://www.apidologie.org/articles/apido/pdf/2010/03/m09120.pdf|journal=Apidologie|volume=41|issue=3|pages=278–294|doi=10.1051/apido/2010012|s2cid=40046635}}</ref> The results indicate that human activity does have a role in the destruction of the fitness of the bee colony. The extinction or near extinction of these pollinators would result in many plants that feed humans on a wide scale, needing alternative pollination methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2015/2015/bee_tech.html|title=Mission 2015: Bee Technology|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref> Crop pollinating insects are worth annually 14.6 billion to the [[Economy of the United States|US economy]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5193-Decline-of-bees-forces-China-s-apple-farmers-to-pollinate-by-hand|title=Decline of bees forces China's apple farmers to pollinate by hand|website=chinadialogue.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref> and cost to hand pollinate over insect pollination will cost an estimated 5,715-$7,135 per hectare additionally. Not only will there be a cost increase but also an decrease in colony fitness, leading to a decrease in genetic diversity, which studies have shown has a direct link to the long term survival of the honey bee colonies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130617111341.htm|title=Genetic diversity key to survival of honey bee colonies|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}</ref>

According to a study, there are over 50 plants that are dependent on bee pollination, many of these being key staples to feeding the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gears.tucson.ars.ag.gov/beeclass/Pollination.pdf|date=2007-09-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020735/http://gears.tucson.ars.ag.gov/beeclass/Pollination.pdf|access-date=2018-10-31|archive-date=2007-09-30}}</ref> Another study conducted states that as a direct result of a lack of [[plant]] diversity, will lead to a decline in the bee population fitness, and a low bee colony fitness has impacts on the fitness of plant ecosystem diversity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2018/08/22/Plant-biodiversity-essential-to-bee-health/7391534949396/|title=Plant biodiversity essential to bee health|work=UPI|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}</ref> By allowing for bee pollination and working to reduce [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenically]] harmful footprints, bee pollination can increase flora growth genetic diversity and create a unique ecosystem that is highly diverse and can provide a habitat and niche for many other organisms to thrive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/why-bees-are-important-to-our-planet/|title=Why Bees Are Important to Our Planet - One Green Planet|website=onegreenplanet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31|date=2014-06-17}}</ref> Due to the evolutionary pressures of bees being located on six out of seven continents, there can be no denying the impact of [[pollinator]]s on the ecosystem diversity. The [[pollen]] collected by the bees is harvested and used as an energy source for winter time, this act of collecting pollen from local plants also has a more important effect of facilitating the movement of genes between [[organism]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Min|last2=Compton|first2=Stephen G.|last3=Peng|first3=Fo-En|last4=Zhang|first4=Jian|last5=Chen|first5=Xiao-Yong|date=2015-06-07|title=Movements of genes between populations: are pollinators more effective at transferring their own or plant genetic markers?|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=282|issue=1808|pages=20150290|doi=10.1098/rspb.2015.0290|issn=0962-8452|pmc=4455804|pmid=25948688}}</ref>

The new evolutionary pressures that are largely [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenically]] catalyzed can potentially cause wide spread collapse of ecosystems. In the north Atlantic sea, a study was conducted that followed the effects of the human interaction on surrounding ocean habitats. They found that in there was no [[habitat]] or [[trophic level]] that in some way was effected negatively by human interaction, and that much of the diversity of life was being stunted as a result.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lotze|first1=Heike K.|last2=Milewski|first2=Inka|title=Two Centuries of Multiple Human Impacts and Successive Changes in a North Atlantic Food Web|date=October 2004|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=1428–1447|doi=10.1890/03-5027|issn=1051-0761}}</ref>
