'''Systems psychology''' is a branch of both [[theoretical psychology]] and [[applied psychology]] that studies [[human behaviour]] and [[experience]] as [[complex system]]s. It is inspired by [[systems theory]] and [[systems thinking]], and based on the theoretical work of [[Roger Barker]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Humberto Maturana]] and others.<ref>Jeanne M. Plas (1986) ''Systems psychology in the schools''. p.xvi</ref> Groups and individuals are considered as [[systems]] in [[homeostasis]]. Alternative terms here are "systemic psychology", "systems behavior", and "systems-based psychology".{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== Types ==
In the scientific literature, different kinds of systems psychology have been mentioned:

;Applied systems psychology
:In the 1970s the term applied systems psychology was being used as a specialism directly related to [[engineering psychology]] and [[human factor]].<ref>Kenyon B. De Greene, Earl A. Alluisi (1970), ''Systems Psychology'', McGraw-Hill. p.44</ref><ref>Ronald John Beishon, Geoff Peters (1976) ''Systems behaviour''. p.144</ref>

;Cognitive systems theory
:Cognitive systems psychology is a part of [[cognitive psychology]] and like [[existential psychology]], attempts to dissolve the barrier between [[conscious]] and the unconscious mind.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

;Organismic-systems psychology
:Through the application of organismic-systems biology to human behavior [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] conceived and developed the organismic-systems psychology, as the theoretical prospect needed for the gradual comprehension of the various ways human personalities may evolve and how they could evolve properly, being supported by a holistic interpretation of human behavior.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.bertalanffy.org/c_22.html | title = Organsmic Systems Psychology | accessdate = 21 March 2008 | publisher = Bertalanffy Center for the Study of Systems Science | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081001203159/http://www.bertalanffy.org/c_22.html

=== Ergonomics ===
{{Main|Ergonomics}}
Ergonomics, also called <!-- "[[Engineering psychology]]" or --> "[[human factors]]", is the application of scientific information concerning objects, systems and environment for human use (definition adopted by the [[International Ergonomics Association]] in 2007). Ergonomics is commonly described as the way companies design tasks and work areas to maximize the efficiency and quality of their employees' work. However, ergonomics comes into everything which involves people. Work systems, sports and leisure, health and safety should all embody ergonomics principles if well designed.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Equipment design is intended to maximize productivity by reducing operator fatigue and discomfort. The field is also called human engineering and [[human factors engineering]]. Ergonomic research is primarily performed by ergonomists who study human capabilities in relationship to their work demands. Information derived from ergonomists contributes to the design and evaluation of tasks, jobs, products, environments and systems in order to make them compatible with the needs, abilities and limitations of people.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Family system therapy===
{{Main|Family therapy}}
Family system therapy, also referred to as "family therapy" and "couple and family therapy", is a branch of [[psychotherapy]] related to [[relationship counseling]] that works with [[family|families]] and couples in [[intimate relationship]]s to nurture change and development. It tends to view the family as a system, family relationships as an important factor in psychological health. As such, family problems have been seen to arise as an [[emergence|emergent]] property of systemic interactions, rather than to be blamed on individual members.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanchard MA, Heeren A |title=Why we should move from reductionism and embrace a network approach to parental burnout |journal=New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development |year=2021| doi = 10.1002/cad.20377 |url=https://doi.org/10.1002/cad.20377 }}</ref> Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) are the most specifically trained in this type of psychotherapy.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Organizational psychology ===
{{Main|Industrial and organizational psychology}}
Industrial and organizational psychology also known as "work psychology", "occupational psychology" or "personnel psychology" concerns the application of [[psychology|psychological]] theories, research methods, and intervention strategies to workplace issues. Industrial and organizational psychologists are interested in making organizations more productive while ensuring workers are able to lead physically and psychologically healthy lives. Relevant topics include personnel psychology, [[motivation]] and [[leadership]], employee selection, training and development, organization development and guided change, [[organizational behavior]], and job and family issues.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Perceptual control theory ===
{{Main|Perceptual control theory}}
Perceptual control theory (PCT) is a psychological theory of animal and [[human behavior]] originated by [[William T. Powers]]. In contrast with other theories of psychology and behavior, which assume that behavior is a function of perception – that perceptual inputs determine or cause behavior – PCT postulates that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions. In contrast with [[control theory|engineering control theory]], the reference variable for each [[negative feedback]] control loop in a control hierarchy is set from within the system (the organism), rather than by an external agent changing the [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] of the [[Controller (control theory)|controller]].<ref name="CT_disfunctions">[[control theory|Engineering control theory]] also makes use of [[Feed forward (control)|feedforward]], [[Model predictive control|predictive control]], and other functions that are not required to model the behavior of living organisms.</ref> PCT also applies to nonliving [[Autonomic Systems|autonomic systems]].<ref name="Byte">For an introduction, see the ''Byte'' articles on robotics and the article on the origins of purpose in this [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/intro_papers/bill_pct.html collection] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604100935/http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/intro_papers/bill_pct.html |date=4 June 2007 }}.</ref>
