The '''Common Weakness Enumeration''' (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses and vulnerabilities. It is sustained by a community project with the goals of understanding flaws in software and creating automated tools that can be used to identify, fix, and prevent those flaws.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cwe.mitre.org/about/index.html |title=CWE - About CWE|publisher=at mitre.org}}</ref>  The project is sponsored by the [[National Cybersecurity FFRDC]], which is operated by [[Mitre Corporation|The MITRE Corporation]], with support from [[US-CERT]] and the [[National Cyber Security Division]] of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.<ref>[https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/categories National Vulnerabilities Database CWE Slice] at nist.gov</ref>

Version 3.2 of the CWE standard was released in January 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cwe.mitre.org/news/index.html#jan032019_CWE_Version_3.2_Now_Available|title=CWE News|publisher=at mitre.org}}</ref>

CWE has over 600 categories, including classes for buffer overflows, path/directory tree traversal errors, race conditions, [[cross-site scripting]], hard-coded passwords, and insecure random numbers.<ref name=samate>[https://samate.nist.gov/BF/Enlightenment/CWE.html The Bugs Framework (BF) / Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)] at nist.gov</ref>

== Examples ==
* CWE category 121 is for stack-based buffer overflows.<ref>[http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflows]</ref>

== CWE compatibility ==
Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Compatibility program allows a service or a product to be reviewed and registered as officially "CWE-Compatible" and "CWE-Effective". The program assists organizations in selecting the right software tools and learning about possible weaknesses and their possible impact.

In order to obtain CWE Compatible status a product or a service must meet 4 out of 6 requirements, shown below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''CWE Searchable'''
| users may search security elements using CWE identifiers
|-
| '''CWE Output'''
| security elements presented to users includes, or allows users to obtain, associated CWE identifiers
|-
| '''Mapping Accuracy'''
| security elements accurately link to the appropriate CWE identifiers
|-
| '''CWE Documentation'''
| capability's documentation describes CWE, CWE compatibility, and how CWE-related functionality in the capability is used
|-
| '''CWE Coverage'''
| for CWE-Compatibility and CWE-Effectiveness, the capability's documentation explicitly lists the CWE-IDs that the capability claims coverage and effectiveness against locating in software
|-
| '''CWE Test Results'''
| for CWE-Effectiveness, test results from the capability showing the results of assessing software for the CWEs are posted on the CWE Web site
|}

There are 56 organizations as of September 2019 that develop and maintain products and services that achieved CWE Compatible status.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/compatible.html |title=CWE - CWE-Compatible Products and Services|publisher=at mitre.org}}</ref>

== Research, critiques, and new developments ==
Some researchers think that ambiguities in CWE can be avoided or reduced.<ref>Paul E. Black, Irena V. Bojanova, Yaacov Yesha, Yan Wu. 2015. [https://www.nist.gov/publications/towards-147periodic-table148-bugs Towards a “Periodic Table” of Bugs]</ref>
