[[DNA barcoding]] of [[algae]] is commonly used for species identification and [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] studies. [[Algae]] form a [[phylogenetically]] heterogeneous group, meaning that the application of a single universal barcode/[[Genetic marker|marker]] for species delimitation is unfeasible, thus [[Algae DNA barcoding#Target regions|different markers/barcodes]] are applied for this aim in different algal groups.

== Diatoms ==
'''Diatom [[DNA barcoding]]''' is a method for taxonomical identification of [[diatom]]s even to [[species]] level. It is conducted using [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] followed by [[Polymerase chain reaction|amplification]] and [[sequencing]] of specific, [[Conserved sequence|conserved regions]] in the diatom [[genome]] followed by taxonomic assignment.

One of the main challenges of identifying diatoms is that it is often collected as a mixture of diatoms from several species. DNA metabarcoding is the process of identifying the individual species from a mixed sample of [[environmental DNA]] (also called eDNA) which is DNA extracted straight from the environment such as in soil or water samples.

A newly applied method is diatom [[DNA metabarcoding]] which is used for ecological quality assessment of rivers and streams because of the specific response of diatoms to particular ecologic conditions.

=== Advantages ===
Applying the DNA barcoding concept to diatoms promises great potential to resolve the problem of inaccurate species identification and thus facilitate analyses of the biodiversity of environmental samples.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Vasselon|first1=Valentin|last2=Domaizon|first2=Isabelle|last3=Rimet|first3=Frédéric|last4=Kahlert|first4=Maria|last5=Bouchez|first5=Agnès|date=2017|title=Application of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) metabarcoding to diatom biomonitoring: Do DNA extraction methods matter?|journal=Freshwater Science|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|pages=162–177|doi=10.1086/690649|issn=2161-9549|url=https://pub.epsilon.slu.se/14206/1/vasselon_v_et_al_170328.pdf}}</ref>

DNA metabarcoding can also increase the taxonomic resolution and comparability across geographic regions, which is often difficult using morphological characters only. Moreover, DNA-based identification allows extending the range of potential bioindicators, including the inconspicuous taxonomic groups that could be highly sensitive or tolerant to particular stressors. Indirectly, the molecular methods can also help filling the gaps in knowledge of species ecology, by increasing the number of samples processed coupled with a decrease in processing time (cost-effectiveness), as well as by increasing the accuracy and precision of correlation between species/MOTUs occurrence and environmental factors.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Pawlowski|first1=Jan|last2=Kelly-Quinn|first2=Mary|last3=Altermatt|first3=Florian|last4=Apothéloz-Perret-Gentil|first4=Laure|last5=Beja|first5=Pedro|last6=Boggero|first6=Angela|last7=Borja|first7=Angel|last8=Bouchez|first8=Agnès|last9=Cordier|first9=Tristan|date=2018|title=The future of biotic indices in the ecogenomic era: Integrating (e)DNA metabarcoding in biological assessment of aquatic ecosystems|journal=Science of the Total Environment|language=en|volume=637-638|pages=1295–1310|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.002|pmid=29801222|url=http://repositori.irta.cat/bitstream/20.500.12327/138/1/Pawlowski_Future_2018.pdf}}</ref>

=== Challenges ===

[[File:Naviculoid diatom (3074442495).jpg|alt=|thumb|Diatom morphology]]

Currently there is no consensus concerning methods for DNA preservation and isolation, the choice of DNA barcodes and PCR primers, nor agreement concerning the parameters of MOTU clustering and their taxonomic assignment.<ref name=":2" /> Sampling and molecular steps need to be standardize through development studies.<ref name=":0" /> One of the major limitation is the availability of reference barcodes for diatoms species. The reference database of bioindicator taxa is far from complete despite the constant efforts of numerous national barcoding initiatives a lot of species are still lacking barcode information. Furthermore, most existing metabarcoding data are only locally available and geographically scattered, which is hindering the development of globally useful tools.<ref name=":2" /> Visco et al.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Visco|first1=Joana Amorim|last2=Apothéloz-Perret-Gentil|first2=Laure|last3=Cordonier|first3=Arielle|last4=Esling|first4=Philippe|last5=Pillet|first5=Loïc|last6=Pawlowski|first6=Jan|date=2015-07-07|title=Environmental Monitoring: Inferring the Diatom Index from Next-Generation Sequencing Data|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|language=en|volume=49|issue=13|pages=7597–7605|doi=10.1021/es506158m|pmid=26052741|issn=0013-936X}}</ref> estimated that no more than 30% of European diatoms species are currently represented in reference databases. For example, there is an important lack for a number of species from the Fennoscandian communities (especially acidophilic diatoms, such as ''Eunotia incisa''). It has also been shown that taxonomic identification with DNA barcoding is not accurate above species level, to discriminate varieties for example (reference missing).

Another well-known limitation of barcoding for taxonomic identification is the clustering method used before the taxonomic assignation: It often leads to massive loss of genetic information and the only reliable way to assess the effects of different clustering and different taxonomic assignation processes would be to compare the species list generated by different pipelines when using the same reference database. This has yet to be done for the variety of pipelines used in molecular assessment of diatom communities in Europe.<ref name=":2" /> Taxonomically validated databases, which includes accessible vouchers are also crucial for reliable taxa identification via NGS.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Zimmermann|first1=Jonas|last2=Abarca|first2=Nelida|last3=Enk|first3=Neela|last4=Skibbe|first4=Oliver|last5=Kusber|first5=Wolf-Henning|last6=Jahn|first6=Regine|date=2014-09-29|editor-last=Schierwater|editor-first=Bernd|title=Taxonomic Reference Libraries for Environmental Barcoding: A Best Practice Example from Diatom Research|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=9|pages=e108793|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0108793|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4180937|pmid=25265556}}</ref>

Additionally, primer bias is often found to be a major source of variation in barcoding and PCR primers efficiency can differ between diatoms species, i.e. some primers lead to a preferential amplification of one taxon over another.<ref name=":2" />

Moniz and Kaczmarska <ref name="Moniz 2010 7–34"/>  investigated the amplification success of the SSU, COI, and ITS2 markers and found that the 300 – 400 bp ITS-2 + 5.8S fragment provided the highest success rate of amplification and good species resolution. This marker was subsequently used to separate morphologically defined species with a success rate of 99.5%. Despite this amplification success, Zimmerman et al.<ref name=":1" /> criticised the use of ITS-2 due to intra-individual heterogeneity. It has been suggested that SSU<ref name=":1" /> or the rbcL (Mann et al., 2010) markers less heterogenous between individuals and therefore more beneficial when distinguishing between species.

==== Forensics ====
Diatoms are used to as a diagnosis tool for drowning in forensic practices. The diatom test is based on the principle of diatom inhalation from water into the lungs and distribution and deposition around the body. DNA methods can be used to confirm if the cause of death was indeed drowning and locate the origin of drowning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Seo|first1=Yasuhisa|last2=Ichida|first2=Daisuke|last3=Sato|first3=Shingo|last4=Kuroki|first4=Kohji|last5=Kishida|first5=Tetsuko|date=2014|title=An Improved Method for the Diatom Test Utilizing DNA Binding Ability of Silica|journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences|language=en|volume=59|issue=3|pages=779–784|doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12390|pmid=24502836}}</ref> Diatom DNA metabarcoding, provides the opportunity to quickly analyse the diatom community present within a body and locate the origin of drowning and investigate if a body may have been moved from one place to another.

==== Cryptic species and databasing ====
Diatom metabarcoding may help delimit cryptic species that are difficult to identify using microscopy and help complete reference databases by comparing morphological assemblages to metabarcoding data.<ref name="Rimet 2018 51–62"/>''' '''

== Other Microalgae ==
[[Chlorophyta|Chlorophytes]] possess an ancients and taxonomically very diverse lineage  (Fang et al. 2014), including terrestrial plants too. Even though more than 14 000 species have been described based on structural and ultrastructural criteria (Hall et al. 2010) their morphological identification is often limited.

Several barcodes for chlorophytes have been proposed for DNA-based identification in order to bypass the problematics of the morphological one. Although the cytochrome oxidase I (COI, COX) coding gene (link) is a standard barcode for animals it proved to be unsatisfactory for chlorophytes because the gene contains several introns in this algae group (Turmel et al. 2002). Nuclear marker genes have been used for chlorophytes are SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA, rDNA ITS (Leliaert et al. 2014).

== Macroalgae ==
[[Macroalgae]]—a morphological rather than taxonomic grouping—can be very challenging to identify because of their simple morphology, phenotypic plasticity and alternate lifecycle stages. Thus, algal systematics and identification have come to rely heavily on genetic/molecular tools such as [[DNA barcoding]].<ref name="Saunders 1879–1888">{{Cite journal|last=Saunders|first=Gary W|date=2005-10-29|title=Applying DNA barcoding to red macroalgae: a preliminary appraisal holds promise for future applications|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=360|issue=1462|pages=1879–1888|doi=10.1098/rstb.2005.1719|issn=0962-8436|pmc=1609223|pmid=16214745}}</ref><ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Leliaert|first1=Frederik|last2=Verbruggen|first2=Heroen|last3=Vanormelingen|first3=Pieter|last4=Steen|first4=Frederique|last5=López-Bautista|first5=Juan M.|last6=Zuccarello|first6=Giuseppe C.|last7=De Clerck|first7=Olivier|date=2014-04-03|title=DNA-based species delimitation in algae|journal=European Journal of Phycology|language=en|volume=49|issue=2|pages=179–196|doi=10.1080/09670262.2014.904524|issn=0967-0262|doi-access=free}}</ref> The [[SSU rRNA|SSU rDNA]] gene is a common used barcode for phylogenetic studies on macroalgae.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Harper & Saunders (2001)|title=The application of sequences of the ribosomal cistron to the systematics and classification of the florideophyte red algae (Florideophyceae, Rhodophyta)|journal=Cahiers de Biologie Marine|volume=42(1/2)|pages=25–38}}</ref> However, the SSU rDNA is a highly conserved region and typically lack resolution for species identification.
