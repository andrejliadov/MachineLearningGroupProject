'''Decision theory''' (or the '''theory of choice''' not to be confused with [[Rational choice theory|choice theory]]) is the study of an [[agent (economics)|agent's]] choices.<ref>Steele, Katie and Stefánsson, H. Orri, "Decision Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/decision-theory]</ref> Decision theory can be broken into two branches: [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] decision theory, which analyzes the outcomes of decisions or determines the [[optimal decision|optimal decisions]] given constraints and assumptions, and descriptive decision theory, which analyzes ''how'' agents actually make the decisions they do.

Decision theory is closely related to the field of [[game theory]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Myerson|first1=Roger B.|title=Game theory analysis of conflict|date=1991|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674728615|chapter=1.2: Basic concepts of Decision Theory}}</ref> and is an interdisciplinary topic, studied by economists, statisticians, data scientists, psychologists, biologists,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Habibi I, Cheong R, Lipniacki T, Levchenko A, Emamian ES, Abdi A | title = Computation and measurement of cell decision making errors using single cell data | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = e1005436 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28379950 | pmc = 5397092 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005436 | bibcode = 2017PLSCB..13E5436H }}</ref> political and other social scientists, philosophers<ref>Hansson, Sven Ove. "Decision theory: A brief introduction." (2005) Section 1.2: A truly interdisciplinary subject.</ref> and computer scientists.

Empirical applications of this rich theory are usually done with the help of [[statistics|statistical]] and [[econometrics|econometric]] methods.

==Normative and descriptive==
[[Normative]] decision theory is concerned with identification of optimal decisions where optimality is often determined by considering an ideal decision maker who is able to calculate with perfect accuracy and is in some sense fully [[Rationality|rational]]. The practical application of this prescriptive approach (how people ''ought to'' make decisions) is called [[decision analysis]] and is aimed at finding tools, methodologies, and software ([[decision support system]]s) to help people make better decisions.<ref name=":5">{{cite book |last=MacCrimmon |first=Kenneth R. |chapter=Descriptive and normative implications of the decision-theory postulates |title=Risk and Uncertainty |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |year=1968 |pages=3–32 |oclc=231114 }}</ref><ref name=":6">{{cite journal |last1=Slovic |first1=Paul |first2=Baruch |last2=Fischhoff |first3=Sarah |last3=Lichtenstein |title=Behavioral Decision Theory |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=28 |issue=1 |year=1977 |pages=1–39 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.28.020177.000245 |hdl=1794/22385 }}</ref>

In contrast, [[Positive statement|positive]] or descriptive decision theory is concerned with describing observed behaviors often under the assumption that the decision-making agents are behaving under some consistent rules. These rules may, for instance, have a procedural framework (e.g. [[Amos Tversky]]'s elimination by aspects model) or an [[axiom]]atic framework (e.g. [[stochastic transitivity]] axioms), reconciling the [[Expected utility hypothesis#Von Neumann|Von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms]] with behavioral violations of the [[expected utility]] hypothesis, or they may explicitly give a functional form for [[Time inconsistency|time-inconsistent]] [[utility function]]s (e.g. Laibson's [[Hyperbolic discounting|quasi-hyperbolic discounting]]).<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" />

The prescriptions or predictions about behavior that positive decision theory produces allow for further tests of the kind of decision-making that occurs in practice. In recent decades, there has also been increasing interest in "behavioral decision theory", contributing to a re-evaluation of what useful decision-making requires.<ref>For instance, see: {{cite book |last=Anand |first=Paul |year=1993 |title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-823303-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Keren GB, Wagenaar WA |title=On the psychology of playing blackjack: Normative and descriptive considerations with implications for decision theory. |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |date=1985 |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=133–158 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.114.2.133 }}</ref>

==Types of decisions==

===Choice under uncertainty=== <!-- This section is linked from [[Risk]] -->
{{Details|Expected utility hypothesis}}
The area of choice under uncertainty represents the heart of decision theory. Known from the 17th century ([[Blaise Pascal]] invoked it in his [[Pascal's Wager|famous wager]], which is contained in his ''[[Pensées]]'', published in 1670), the idea of [[expected value]] is that, when faced with a number of actions, each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities, the rational procedure is to identify all possible outcomes, determine their values (positive or negative) and the probabilities that will result from each course of action, and multiply the two to give an "expected value", or the average expectation for an outcome; the action to be chosen should be the one that gives rise to the highest total expected value.  In 1738, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published an influential paper entitled ''Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk'', in which he uses the [[St. Petersburg paradox]] to show that expected value theory must be [[Norm (philosophy)|normatively]] wrong. He gives an example in which a Dutch merchant is trying to decide whether to insure a cargo being sent from Amsterdam to St Petersburg in winter. In his solution, he defines a [[utility function]] and computes [[expected utility]] rather than expected financial value.<ref>For a review see {{cite journal |last=Schoemaker |first=P. J. |title=The Expected Utility Model: Its Variants, Purposes, Evidence and Limitations|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=20|year=1982|issue=2 |pages=529–563 |jstor=2724488}}</ref>

In the 20th century, interest was reignited by [[Abraham Wald|Abraham Wald's]] 1939 paper<ref>{{cite journal | title = Contributions to the Theory of Statistical Estimation and Testing Hypotheses | last = Wald | first = Abraham | author-link = Abraham Wald | journal = [[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–326 | year = 1939 | doi = 10.1214/aoms/1177732144 | mr = 932 | doi-access = free }}</ref> pointing out that the two central procedures of [[frequentist statistics|sampling-distribution-based]] statistical-theory, namely [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] and [[estimation theory|parameter estimation]], are special cases of the general decision problem.  Wald's paper renewed and synthesized many concepts of statistical theory, including [[loss function]]s, [[risk function]]s, [[admissible decision rule]]s, [[prior probability|antecedent distributions]], [[admissible decision rule#Bayes rules|Bayesian procedures]], and [[minimax]] procedures.  The phrase "decision theory" itself was used in 1950 by [[E. L. Lehmann]].<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Lehmann EL |author-link=E. L. Lehmann|title=Some Principles of the Theory of Testing Hypotheses|journal=[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]|year=1950|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–26|jstor=2236552|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177729884|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The revival of [[subjective probability]] theory, from the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], [[Bruno de Finetti]], [[L. J. Savage|Leonard Savage]] and others, extended the scope of expected utility theory to situations where subjective probabilities can be used. At the time, von Neumann and Morgenstern's theory of [[expected utility]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theory of Games and Economic Behavior | edition = third |last1=Neumann|first1=John von|last2=Morgenstern|first2=Oskar | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1953 |orig-year=1944|location=Princeton, NJ}}</ref> proved that expected utility maximization followed from basic postulates about rational behavior.

The work of [[Maurice Allais]] and [[Daniel Ellsberg]] showed that human behavior has systematic and sometimes important departures from expected-utility maximization.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Expected Utility Hypotheses and the Allais Paradox: Contemporary Discussions of the Decisions Under Uncertainty with Allais' Rejoinder|last1=Allais|first1=M.|last2=Hagen|first2=G. M.|date=2013-03-14|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9789048183548|location=Dordrecht|pages=333}}</ref> The [[prospect theory]] of [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] renewed the empirical study of [[behavioral economics|economic behavior]] with less emphasis on rationality presuppositions. It describes a way by which people make decisions when all of the outcomes carry a risk.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|last1=Morvan|first1=Camille|last2=Jenkins|first2=William J.|date=2017-07-05|publisher=Macat International Ltd.|isbn=9781912303687|location=London|pages=13}}</ref> Kahneman and Tversky found three regularities – in actual human decision-making, "losses loom larger than gains"; persons focus more on ''changes'' in their utility-states than they focus on absolute utilities; and the estimation of subjective probabilities is severely biased by [[anchoring]].

===Intertemporal choice===
{{Main|Intertemporal choice}}
Intertemporal choice is concerned with the kind of choice where different actions lead to outcomes that are realised at different stages over time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essays In Decision Making: A Volume in Honour of Stanley Zionts|last1=Karwan|first1=Mark|last2=Spronk|first2=Jaap|last3=Wallenius|first3=Jyrki|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783642644993|location=Berlin|pages=135}}</ref> It is also described as cost-benefit decision making since it involves the choices between rewards that vary according to magnitude and time of arrival.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Aging and Decision Making: Empirical and Applied Perspectives|last1=Hess|first1=Thomas M.|last2=Strough|first2=JoNell|last3=Löckenhoff|first3=Corinna|author3-link= Corinna Löckenhoff |date=2015|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780124171558|location=London|pages=21}}</ref> If someone received a windfall of several thousand dollars, they could spend it on an expensive holiday, giving them immediate pleasure, or they could invest it in a pension scheme, giving them an income at some time in the future.  What is the optimal thing to do?  The answer depends partly on factors such as the expected [[interest rate|rates of interest]] and [[inflation]], the person's [[life expectancy]], and their confidence in the pensions industry.  However even with all those factors taken into account, human behavior again deviates greatly from the predictions of prescriptive decision theory, leading to alternative models in which, for example, objective interest rates are replaced by [[hyperbolic discounting|subjective discount rates]].

===Interaction of decision makers===
Some decisions are difficult because of the need to take into account how other people in the situation will respond to the decision that is taken.  The analysis of such social decisions is more often treated under the label of [[game theory]], rather than decision theory, though it involves the same mathematical methods. From the standpoint of game theory, most of the problems treated in decision theory are one-player games (or the one player is viewed as playing against an impersonal background situation). In the emerging field of [[socio-cognitive]] engineering, the research is especially focused on the different types of distributed decision-making in human organizations, in normal and abnormal/emergency/crisis situations.<ref>Crozier, M. & Friedberg, E. 1995. "Organization and Collective Action. Our Contribution to Organizational Analysis" in Bacharach S.B, Gagliardi P. & Mundell P. (Eds). Research in the Sociology of Organizations. Vol. XIII, Special Issue on European Perspectives of Organizational Theory, Greenwich, CT: JAI Press.</ref>

===Complex decisions===
Other areas of decision theory are concerned with decisions that are difficult simply because of their complexity, or the complexity of the organization that has to make them. Individuals making decisions are limited in resources (i.e. time and intelligence) and are therefore [[Bounded rationality|boundedly rational]]; the issue is thus, more than the deviation between real and optimal behaviour, the difficulty of determining the optimal behaviour in the first place. One example is the model of economic growth and resource usage developed by the [[Club of Rome]] to help politicians make real-life decisions in complex situations{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Decisions are also affected by whether options are framed together or separately; this is known as the [[distinction bias]].

==Heuristics==
{{Main|Heuristics in judgment and decision-making}}

[[Heuristic]]s in decision-making is the ability of making decisions based on unjustified or routine thinking. While quicker than step-by-step processing, heuristic thinking is also more likely to involve fallacies or inaccuracies.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Eric J. |last2=Payne |first2=John W.  | name-list-style = vanc |title=Effort and Accuracy in Choice |journal=Management Science |date=April 1985 |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=395–414 |doi=10.1287/mnsc.31.4.395 }}</ref> The main use for heuristics in our daily routines is to decrease the amount of evaluative thinking we perform when making simple decisions, making them instead based on unconscious rules and focusing on some aspects of the decision, while ignoring others.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bobadilla-Suarez S, Love BC | title = Fast or frugal, but not both: Decision heuristics under time pressure | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–33 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 28557503 | pmc = 5708146 | doi = 10.1037/xlm0000419 | url = http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10038268/1/2017-23585-001.pdf }}</ref> One example of a common and erroneous thought process that arises through heuristic thinking is the [[Gambler's fallacy|Gambler's Fallacy]] — believing that an isolated random event is affected by previous isolated random events. For example, if a coin is flipped to tails for a couple of turns, it still has the same probability of doing so; however it seems more likely, intuitively, for it to roll heads soon.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal |last1=Roe |first1=Robert M. |last2=Busemeyer |first2=Jermone R. |last3=Townsend |first3=James T.  | name-list-style = vanc |title=Multialternative decision field theory: A dynamic connectionst model of decision making. |journal=Psychological Review |date=2001 |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=370–392 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.370 |pmid=11381834 }}</ref> This happens because, due to routine thinking, one disregards the probability and concentrates on the ratio of the outcomes, meaning that one expects that in the long run the ratio of flips should be half for each outcome.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu J, Harvey N | title = Carry on winning: the gamblers' fallacy creates hot hand effects in online gambling | journal = Cognition | volume = 131 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–80 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24549140 | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2014.01.002 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Another example is that decision-makers may be biased towards preferring moderate alternatives to extreme ones; the ''Compromise Effect'' operates under a mindset that the most moderate option carries the most benefit. In an incomplete information scenario, as in most daily decisions, the moderate option will look more appealing than either extreme, independent of the context, based only on the fact that it has characteristics that can be found at either extreme.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal |first1=Shih-Chieh |last1=Chuang |first2=Danny Tengti |last2=Kao |first3=Yin-Hui |last3=Cheng |first4=Chu-An |last4=Chou  | name-list-style = vanc |title=The effect of incomplete information on the compromise effect |journal=Judgment and Decision Making |volume=7 |issue=2 |date=March 2012 |pages=196–206 |url=http://journal.sjdm.org/11/11214/jdm11214.html |citeseerx=10.1.1.419.4767 }}</ref>

==Alternatives==
A highly controversial issue is whether one can replace the use of probability in decision theory by other alternatives.

===Probability theory===
Advocates for the use of probability theory point to:
*   the work of [[Richard Threlkeld Cox]] for justification of the probability axioms,
*   the [[Dutch book]] paradoxes of [[Bruno de Finetti]] as illustrative of the theoretical difficulties that can arise from departures from the probability axioms, and
*   the complete class theorems, which show that all [[admissible decision rule]]s are equivalent to the Bayesian decision rule for some utility function and some [[prior distribution]] (or for the limit of a sequence of prior distributions). Thus, for every decision rule, either the rule may be reformulated as a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] procedure (or a limit of a sequence of such), or there is a rule that is sometimes better and never worse.

===Alternatives to probability theory===
The proponents of [[fuzzy logic]], [[possibility theory]], [[quantum cognition]], [[Dempster–Shafer theory]], and [[info-gap decision theory]] maintain that probability is only one of many alternatives and point to many examples where non-standard alternatives have been implemented with apparent success; notably, probabilistic decision theory is [[sensitivity analysis|sensitive]] to assumptions about the probabilities of various events, while non-probabilistic rules such as [[minimax]] are [[robust statistics|robust]], in that they do not make such assumptions.

===Ludic fallacy===
{{Main|Ludic fallacy}}

A general criticism of decision theory based on a fixed universe of possibilities is that it considers the "known unknowns", not the "[[unknown unknowns]]"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}: it focuses on expected variations, not on unforeseen events, which some argue have outsized impact and must be considered – significant events may be "outside model". This line of argument, called the [[ludic fallacy]], is that there are inevitable imperfections in modeling the real world by particular models, and that unquestioning reliance on models blinds one to their limits.

Decision theory is closely related to the field of [[game theory]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Myerson|first1=Roger B.|title=Game theory analysis of conflict|date=1991|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674728615|chapter=1.2: Basic concepts of Decision Theory}}</ref> and is an interdisciplinary topic, studied by economists, statisticians, data scientists, psychologists, biologists,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Habibi I, Cheong R, Lipniacki T, Levchenko A, Emamian ES, Abdi A | title = Computation and measurement of cell decision making errors using single cell data | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = e1005436 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28379950 | pmc = 5397092 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005436 | bibcode = 2017PLSCB..13E5436H }}</ref> political and other social scientists, philosophers<ref>Hansson, Sven Ove.

Empirical applications of this rich theory are usually done with the help of [[statistics|statistical]] and [[econometrics|econometric]] methods.

==Normative and descriptive==
[[Normative]] decision theory is concerned with identification of optimal decisions where optimality is often determined by considering an ideal decision maker who is able to calculate with perfect accuracy and is in some sense fully [[Rationality|rational]]. The practical application of this prescriptive approach (how people ''ought to'' make decisions) is called [[decision analysis]] and is aimed at finding tools, methodologies, and software ([[decision support system]]s) to help people make better decisions.<ref name=":5">{{cite book |last=MacCrimmon |first=Kenneth R. |chapter=Descriptive and normative implications of the decision-theory postulates |title=Risk and Uncertainty |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |year=1968 |pages=3–32 |oclc=231114 }}</ref><ref name=":6">{{cite journal |last1=Slovic |first1=Paul |first2=Baruch |last2=Fischhoff |first3=Sarah |last3=Lichtenstein |title=Behavioral Decision Theory |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=28 |issue=1 |year=1977 |pages=1–39 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.28.020177.000245 |hdl=1794/22385 }}</ref>

In contrast, [[Positive statement|positive]] or descriptive decision theory is concerned with describing observed behaviors often under the assumption that the decision-making agents are behaving under some consistent rules. These rules may, for instance, have a procedural framework (e.g. [[Amos Tversky]]'s elimination by aspects model) or an [[axiom]]atic framework (e.g. [[stochastic transitivity]] axioms), reconciling the [[Expected utility hypothesis#Von Neumann|Von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms]] with behavioral violations of the [[expected utility]] hypothesis, or they may explicitly give a functional form for [[Time inconsistency|time-inconsistent]] [[utility function]]s (e.g. Laibson's [[Hyperbolic discounting|quasi-hyperbolic discounting]]).<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" />

The prescriptions or predictions about behavior that positive decision theory produces allow for further tests of the kind of decision-making that occurs in practice. In recent decades, there has also been increasing interest in "behavioral decision theory", contributing to a re-evaluation of what useful decision-making requires.<ref>For instance, see: {{cite book |last=Anand |first=Paul |year=1993 |title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-823303-5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Keren GB, Wagenaar WA |title=On the psychology of playing blackjack: Normative and descriptive considerations with implications for decision theory. |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General |date=1985 |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=133–158 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.114.2.133 }}</ref>

==Types of decisions==

===Choice under uncertainty=== <!-- This section is linked from [[Risk]] -->
{{Details|Expected utility hypothesis}}
The area of choice under uncertainty represents the heart of decision theory. Known from the 17th century ([[Blaise Pascal]] invoked it in his [[Pascal's Wager|famous wager]], which is contained in his ''[[Pensées]]'', published in 1670), the idea of [[expected value]] is that, when faced with a number of actions, each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities, the rational procedure is to identify all possible outcomes, determine their values (positive or negative) and the probabilities that will result from each course of action, and multiply the two to give an "expected value", or the average expectation for an outcome; the action to be chosen should be the one that gives rise to the highest total expected value.  In 1738, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published an influential paper entitled ''Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk'', in which he uses the [[St. Petersburg paradox]] to show that expected value theory must be [[Norm (philosophy)|normatively]] wrong. He gives an example in which a Dutch merchant is trying to decide whether to insure a cargo being sent from Amsterdam to St Petersburg in winter. In his solution, he defines a [[utility function]] and computes [[expected utility]] rather than expected financial value.<ref>For a review see {{cite journal |last=Schoemaker |first=P. J. |title=The Expected Utility Model: Its Variants, Purposes, Evidence and Limitations|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=20|year=1982|issue=2 |pages=529–563 |jstor=2724488}}</ref>

In the 20th century, interest was reignited by [[Abraham Wald|Abraham Wald's]] 1939 paper<ref>{{cite journal | title = Contributions to the Theory of Statistical Estimation and Testing Hypotheses | last = Wald | first = Abraham | author-link = Abraham Wald | journal = [[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–326 | year = 1939 | doi = 10.1214/aoms/1177732144 | mr = 932 | doi-access = free }}</ref> pointing out that the two central procedures of [[frequentist statistics|sampling-distribution-based]] statistical-theory, namely [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] and [[estimation theory|parameter estimation]], are special cases of the general decision problem.  Wald's paper renewed and synthesized many concepts of statistical theory, including [[loss function]]s, [[risk function]]s, [[admissible decision rule]]s, [[prior probability|antecedent distributions]], [[admissible decision rule#Bayes rules|Bayesian procedures]], and [[minimax]] procedures.  The phrase "decision theory" itself was used in 1950 by [[E. L. Lehmann]].<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Lehmann EL |author-link=E. L. Lehmann|title=Some Principles of the Theory of Testing Hypotheses|journal=[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]|year=1950|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–26|jstor=2236552|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177729884|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The revival of [[subjective probability]] theory, from the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], [[Bruno de Finetti]], [[L. J. Savage|Leonard Savage]] and others, extended the scope of expected utility theory to situations where subjective probabilities can be used. At the time, von Neumann and Morgenstern's theory of [[expected utility]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theory of Games and Economic Behavior | edition = third |last1=Neumann|first1=John von|last2=Morgenstern|first2=Oskar | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1953 |orig-year=1944|location=Princeton, NJ}}</ref> proved that expected utility maximization followed from basic postulates about rational behavior.

The work of [[Maurice Allais]] and [[Daniel Ellsberg]] showed that human behavior has systematic and sometimes important departures from expected-utility maximization.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Expected Utility Hypotheses and the Allais Paradox: Contemporary Discussions of the Decisions Under Uncertainty with Allais' Rejoinder|last1=Allais|first1=M.|last2=Hagen|first2=G. M.|date=2013-03-14|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9789048183548|location=Dordrecht|pages=333}}</ref> The [[prospect theory]] of [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] renewed the empirical study of [[behavioral economics|economic behavior]] with less emphasis on rationality presuppositions. It describes a way by which people make decisions when all of the outcomes carry a risk.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|last1=Morvan|first1=Camille|last2=Jenkins|first2=William J.|date=2017-07-05|publisher=Macat International Ltd.|isbn=9781912303687|location=London|pages=13}}</ref> Kahneman and Tversky found three regularities – in actual human decision-making, "losses loom larger than gains"; persons focus more on ''changes'' in their utility-states than they focus on absolute utilities; and the estimation of subjective probabilities is severely biased by [[anchoring]].

===Intertemporal choice===
{{Main|Intertemporal choice}}
Intertemporal choice is concerned with the kind of choice where different actions lead to outcomes that are realised at different stages over time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essays In Decision Making: A Volume in Honour of Stanley Zionts|last1=Karwan|first1=Mark|last2=Spronk|first2=Jaap|last3=Wallenius|first3=Jyrki|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783642644993|location=Berlin|pages=135}}</ref> It is also described as cost-benefit decision making since it involves the choices between rewards that vary according to magnitude and time of arrival.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Aging and Decision Making: Empirical and Applied Perspectives|last1=Hess|first1=Thomas M.|last2=Strough|first2=JoNell|last3=Löckenhoff|first3=Corinna|author3-link= Corinna Löckenhoff |date=2015|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780124171558|location=London|pages=21}}</ref> If someone received a windfall of several thousand dollars, they could spend it on an expensive holiday, giving them immediate pleasure, or they could invest it in a pension scheme, giving them an income at some time in the future.  What is the optimal thing to do?  The answer depends partly on factors such as the expected [[interest rate|rates of interest]] and [[inflation]], the person's [[life expectancy]], and their confidence in the pensions industry.  However even with all those factors taken into account, human behavior again deviates greatly from the predictions of prescriptive decision theory, leading to alternative models in which, for example, objective interest rates are replaced by [[hyperbolic discounting|subjective discount rates]].

===Interaction of decision makers===
Some decisions are difficult because of the need to take into account how other people in the situation will respond to the decision that is taken.  The analysis of such social decisions is more often treated under the label of [[game theory]], rather than decision theory, though it involves the same mathematical methods. From the standpoint of game theory, most of the problems treated in decision theory are one-player games (or the one player is viewed as playing against an impersonal background situation). In the emerging field of [[socio-cognitive]] engineering, the research is especially focused on the different types of distributed decision-making in human organizations, in normal and abnormal/emergency/crisis situations.<ref>Crozier, M. & Friedberg, E. 1995. "Organization and Collective Action. Our Contribution to Organizational Analysis" in Bacharach S.B, Gagliardi P. & Mundell P. (Eds). Research in the Sociology of Organizations. Vol. XIII, Special Issue on European Perspectives of Organizational Theory, Greenwich, CT: JAI Press.</ref>

===Complex decisions===
Other areas of decision theory are concerned with decisions that are difficult simply because of their complexity, or the complexity of the organization that has to make them. Individuals making decisions are limited in resources (i.e. time and intelligence) and are therefore [[Bounded rationality|boundedly rational]]; the issue is thus, more than the deviation between real and optimal behaviour, the difficulty of determining the optimal behaviour in the first place. One example is the model of economic growth and resource usage developed by the [[Club of Rome]] to help politicians make real-life decisions in complex situations{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Decisions are also affected by whether options are framed together or separately; this is known as the [[distinction bias]].

==Heuristics==
{{Main|Heuristics in judgment and decision-making}}

[[Heuristic]]s in decision-making is the ability of making decisions based on unjustified or routine thinking. While quicker than step-by-step processing, heuristic thinking is also more likely to involve fallacies or inaccuracies.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Eric J. |last2=Payne |first2=John W.  | name-list-style = vanc |title=Effort and Accuracy in Choice |journal=Management Science |date=April 1985 |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=395–414 |doi=10.1287/mnsc.31.4.395 }}</ref> The main use for heuristics in our daily routines is to decrease the amount of evaluative thinking we perform when making simple decisions, making them instead based on unconscious rules and focusing on some aspects of the decision, while ignoring others.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bobadilla-Suarez S, Love BC | title = Fast or frugal, but not both: Decision heuristics under time pressure | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–33 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 28557503 | pmc = 5708146 | doi = 10.1037/xlm0000419 | url = http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10038268/1/2017-23585-001.pdf }}</ref> One example of a common and erroneous thought process that arises through heuristic thinking is the [[Gambler's fallacy|Gambler's Fallacy]] — believing that an isolated random event is affected by previous isolated random events. For example, if a coin is flipped to tails for a couple of turns, it still has the same probability of doing so; however it seems more likely, intuitively, for it to roll heads soon.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal |last1=Roe |first1=Robert M. |last2=Busemeyer |first2=Jermone R. |last3=Townsend |first3=James T.  | name-list-style = vanc |title=Multialternative decision field theory: A dynamic connectionst model of decision making. |journal=Psychological Review |date=2001 |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=370–392 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.370 |pmid=11381834 }}</ref> This happens because, due to routine thinking, one disregards the probability and concentrates on the ratio of the outcomes, meaning that one expects that in the long run the ratio of flips should be half for each outcome.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu J, Harvey N | title = Carry on winning: the gamblers' fallacy creates hot hand effects in online gambling | journal = Cognition | volume = 131 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–80 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24549140 | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2014.01.002 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Another example is that decision-makers may be biased towards preferring moderate alternatives to extreme ones; the ''Compromise Effect'' operates under a mindset that the most moderate option carries the most benefit. In an incomplete information scenario, as in most daily decisions, the moderate option will look more appealing than either extreme, independent of the context, based only on the fact that it has characteristics that can be found at either extreme.<ref name=":4">{{cite journal |first1=Shih-Chieh |last1=Chuang |first2=Danny Tengti |last2=Kao |first3=Yin-Hui |last3=Cheng |first4=Chu-An |last4=Chou  | name-list-style = vanc |title=The effect of incomplete information on the compromise effect |journal=Judgment and Decision Making |volume=7 |issue=2 |date=March 2012 |pages=196–206 |url=http://journal.sjdm.org/11/11214/jdm11214.html |citeseerx=10.1.1.419.4767 }}</ref>

==Alternatives==
A highly controversial issue is whether one can replace the use of probability in decision theory by other alternatives.

===Probability theory===
Advocates for the use of probability theory point to:
*   the work of [[Richard Threlkeld Cox]] for justification of the probability axioms,
*   the [[Dutch book]] paradoxes of [[Bruno de Finetti]] as illustrative of the theoretical difficulties that can arise from departures from the probability axioms, and
*   the complete class theorems, which show that all [[admissible decision rule]]s are equivalent to the Bayesian decision rule for some utility function and some [[prior distribution]] (or for the limit of a sequence of prior distributions). Thus, for every decision rule, either the rule may be reformulated as a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] procedure (or a limit of a sequence of such), or there is a rule that is sometimes better and never worse.

===Alternatives to probability theory===
The proponents of [[fuzzy logic]], [[possibility theory]], [[quantum cognition]], [[Dempster–Shafer theory]], and [[info-gap decision theory]] maintain that probability is only one of many alternatives and point to many examples where non-standard alternatives have been implemented with apparent success; notably, probabilistic decision theory is [[sensitivity analysis|sensitive]] to assumptions about the probabilities of various events, while non-probabilistic rules such as [[minimax]] are [[robust statistics|robust]], in that they do not make such assumptions.

===Ludic fallacy===
{{Main|Ludic fallacy}}

A general criticism of decision theory based on a fixed universe of possibilities is that it considers the "known unknowns", not the "[[unknown unknowns]]"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}: it focuses on expected variations, not on unforeseen events, which some argue have outsized impact and must be considered – significant events may be "outside model". This line of argument, called the [[ludic fallacy]], is that there are inevitable imperfections in modeling the real world by particular models, and that unquestioning reliance on models blinds one to their limits.
