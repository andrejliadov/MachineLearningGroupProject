'''Agent Communication Language''' ('''ACL'''), proposed by the [[Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents]] (FIPA), is a proposed standard language for [[Software agent|agent]] communications.  [[Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language]] (KQML) is another proposed standard.

The most popular ACLs are:

* FIPA-ACL<ref>{{cite journal|last=Poslad|first=Stefan|title=Specifying Protocols for Multi-agent System Interaction|year=2007|journal=ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems|volume=2|issue=4|pages=15–es|doi=10.1145/1293731.1293735}}</ref> (by the [[Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents]], a standardization [[consortium]])
* [[KQML]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finin|first=Tim|author2= Richard Fritzson, Don McKay and Robin McEntire |title=KQML as an agent communication language|year=1994|conference=Proceedings of the third international conference on Information and knowledge management, CIKM '94 |pages= 456–463}}</ref> (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language)

Both rely on [[speech act]] theory developed by [[John Searle|Searle]] in the 1960s<ref>{{cite book|last=Searle|first=J.R.|year=1969|title=Speech Acts|publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK}}</ref> and enhanced by [[Terry Winograd|Winograd]] and [[Fernando Flores|Flores]] in the 1970s. They define a set of [[Performative utterance|performatives]], also called Communicative Acts, and their meaning (e.g. ask-one). The content of the performative is not standardized, but varies from system to system.

To make agents understand each other they have to not only speak the same language, but also have a common [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]. An ontology is a part of the agent's knowledge base that describes what kind of things an agent can deal with and how they are related to each other.

Examples of frameworks that implement a standard agent communication language (FIPA-ACL) include FIPA-OS<ref>{{cite conference|last=Poslad|first=Stefan|author2=Philip Buckle and Robert Hadingham|title=The FIPA-OS agent platform: Open Source for Open Standards|year=2000|conference=Proceedings of 5th International Conference on the Practical Application Of Intelligent Agents And Multi-Agent Technology (PAAM)|pages=355–368}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Poslad|first=S|author2=Buckle P, Hadingham R.G|title=Open Source, Standards and Scaleable Agencies|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2001|volume=1887|pages=[https://archive.org/details/infrastructurefo0000inte/page/296 296–303]|doi=10.1007/3-540-47772-1_30|isbn=978-3-540-42315-7|url=https://archive.org/details/infrastructurefo0000inte/page/296}}</ref>
