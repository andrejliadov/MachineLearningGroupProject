{{confused|roboticist}}
A '''cyberneticist''' or a '''cybernetician''' is a person who practices [[cybernetics]].

[[Heinz von Foerster]] once told [[Stuart Umpleby]] that [[Norbert Wiener]] preferred the term "cybernetician" rather than "cyberneticist",  perhaps because Wiener was a mathematician rather than a physicist.

The word "cyberneticist" was used by [[Nicolas Rashevsky]] who began as a theoretical physicist. [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]], who began his career as a mathematician, regarded [[Brain–computer interface|neurocybernetics]]—and more generally [[biocybernetics]]—as fields closely allied to [[mathematical biology]] and mathematical [[biophysics]] in which [[control theory]] and [[dynamical system]] theories also play significant roles.

Today "cybernetician" is preferred by members of the [[American Society for Cybernetics]].<ref>[http://www.cybsoc.org/ CybSoc]</ref>
