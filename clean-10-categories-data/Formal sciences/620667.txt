'''Methodology '''is "'a contextual framework' for research, a coherent and logical scheme based on views, beliefs, and values, that guides the choices researchers [or other users] make".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kara |first=Helen |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908273802|title=Creative research methods in the social sciences: a practical guide|publisher=Policy Press|others=Gergen, Kenneth J., Gergen, Mary M. |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4473-1627-5 |location=Bristol|page=4 |oclc=908273802}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551433734|title=Creative arts research: narratives of methodologies and practices|date=2009|publisher=Sense Publishers|others=Grierson, Elizabeth; Brearley, Laura; Hamm, Treahna|isbn=978-90-8790-995-6|location=Rotterdam, The Netherlands|oclc=551433734}}</ref> 

It comprises the theoretical analysis of the body of methods and principles associated with a branch of knowledge such that the methodologies employed from differing [[Academic discipline|disciplines]] vary depending on their historical development.

Methodology may be visualized as a spectrum from a predominantly [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] approach towards a predominantly [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] approach.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Newman, Isadore.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44962443|title=Qualitative-quantitative research methodology: exploring the interactive continuum|date=1998|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Benz, Carolyn R. |isbn=0-585-17889-5|location=Carbondale, Ill.|oclc=44962443}}</ref> Although a methodology may conventionally sit specifically within one of these approaches, researchers may blend approaches in answering their research objectives and so have methodologies that are [[Multimethodology|multimethod]] and/or [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]].<ref>Irny, S.I. and Rose, A.A.

Overall, a methodology does not set out to provide solutions - it is therefore, not the same as a method.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Steve|date=2016|title=Perspectives: Method and methodology in nursing research|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1744987116679583|journal=Journal of Research in Nursing|volume=21|issue=8|pages=656–659|doi=10.1177/1744987116679583|s2cid=78696476|issn=1744-9871}}</ref> Instead, a methodology offers a [[Theory|theoretical]] [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] for understanding which method, set of methods, or [[best practice]]s can be applied to the [[research question]](s) at hand.

== Definitions ==
Some definitions of methodology include: 
# "the [[analysis]] of the principles of methods, rules, and postulates employed by a discipline";<ref name="merrian-webster">''Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language, Second Edition, Unabridged'', W.&nbsp;A. Neilson, T.&nbsp;A. Knott, P.&nbsp;W. Carhart (eds.), G. & C. Merriam Company, Springfield, MA, 1950. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/methodology "Methodology Usage Notes"], entry at [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam–Webster]]</ref>
# "the systematic study of methods that are, can be, or have been applied within a discipline";<ref name="merrian-webster" />
# "the study or description of methods".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baskerville|first1=R.|year=1991|title=Risk Analysis as a Source of Professional Knowledge|journal=Computers & Security|volume=10|issue=8|pages=749–764|doi=10.1016/0167-4048(91)90094-T}}</ref>

== In natural sciences ==
[[File:STARR-seq Methodology.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The methodology underlying a type of [[DNA sequencing]].]]
The [[Natural science|natural sciences]] (for example, but not limited to, [[astronomy]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[Earth science|earth sciences]], and [[physics]]) draw their study of methods through the [[scientific method]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lakatos, Imre, 1922-1974.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2896185|title=Philosophical papers|date=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-21644-3|location=Cambridge|oclc=2896185}}</ref> This is a [[quantitative research|quantitative]] approach influenced through the philosophy of [[empiricism]] that posits knowledge (see [[epistemology]]) can only be obtained through direct, verifiable observations. The scientific method offers a defined set of best practice to observe the world through established methods such as characterizations, hypotheses, predictions, and [[Experiment|experimentation]]. A key distinguishing feature of this methodology is that it sets out not to prove knowledge, or facts, "right", but rather it primarily sets out to prove something "wrong" or false (see [[falsifiability]]). A cornerstone of this is the [[null hypothesis]] that states there is no connection (see [[causality]]) between whatever is being observed. That it is the researcher's position to do all they can to disprove their own hypothesis through relevant methods or techniques, documented in a clear and replicable process, to such an extent that they can disprove the null hypothesis and therefore accept the alternative hypothesis that there is a relationship between what they have observed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Çaparlar|first1=Ceyda Özhan|last2=Dönmez|first2=Aslı|date=2016|title=What is Scientific Research and How Can it be Done?|journal=Turkish Journal of Anaesthesiology and Reanimation|volume=44|issue=4|pages=212–218|doi=10.5152/TJAR.2016.34711|issn=2149-0937|pmc=5019873|pmid=27909596}}</ref>

== In social sciences ==
''See [[Social research]]''

The [[Social science|social sciences]] (for example, but not limited to, [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], and [[psychology]]) derive their study of methods from a broader continuum of methodologies than the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] do.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hollis, Martin|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/782950418|title=The philosophy of social science : an introduction|isbn=978-1-139-07679-1|location=Cambridge [England]|oclc=782950418}}</ref>

==Related concepts==
Methodology has several related concepts: paradigm, algorithm, and method.

The ''methodology'' is the general research strategy that outlines the way in which research is to be undertaken and, among other things, identifies the methods to be used in it. These ''methods'', described in the methodology, define the means or modes of data collection or, sometimes, how a specific result is to be calculated.<ref>Howell, K. E. (2013) ''Introduction to the Philosophy of Methodology''. London: Sage Publications</ref>  ''Methodology'' does not define specific methods, even though much attention is given to the nature and kinds of processes to be followed in a particular procedure or to attain an objective.

When proper to a study of methodology, such processes constitute a ''constructive generic framework'', and may therefore be broken down into sub-processes, combined, or their sequence changed.<ref name=Vacca1>{{cite book |last= Katsicas |first=Sokratis K. |editor1-last=Vacca |editor1-first=John |title=Computer and Information Security Handbook |series=Morgan Kaufmann Publications |year=2009 |publisher= Elsevier Inc |isbn= 978-0-12-374354-1 |page=605 |chapter=Chapter 35}}</ref>

===Paradigm===
A ''[[paradigm]]'' is similar to a methodology in that it is also a ''constructive framework''.  In theoretical work, the development of paradigms satisfies most or all of the criteria for methodology.<ref>See, for example, [[Thomas Kuhn]], ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (University of Chicago, 1970, 2nd ed.)</ref>  

===Algorithm===
An ''[[algorithm]]'', like a paradigm, is also a type of ''constructive framework'', meaning that the construction is a logical, rather than a physical, array of connected elements.

Any description of a means of calculation of a specific result is always a description of a method and never a description of a methodology.  It is thus important to avoid using ''methodology'' as a synonym for ''method'' or ''body of methods''.  Doing this shifts it away from its true [[Epistemology|epistemological]] meaning and reduces it to being the procedure itself, or the set of tools, or the instruments that should have been its outcome.  A methodology is the design process for carrying out research or the development of a procedure and is not in itself an instrument, or method, or procedure for doing things.

The economist George M. Frankfurter has argued that the word ''method'' is not interchangeable for methodology, and in contemporary scientific discourse is a "pretentious substitute for the word method".<ref name="Frankfurter">George M. Frankfurter, ''Theory and Reality in Financial Economics: Essays Toward a New Political Finance''.</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=October 2020}} He argues that using methodology as a synonym for ''method'' or ''set of methods'' leads to confusion and misinterpretation and undermines the proper analysis that should go into designing research.<ref name="Frankfurter" />
