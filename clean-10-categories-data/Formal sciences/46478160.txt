'''Gross National Wellness''' ('''GNW''') or '''Well-being''' is a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] development and measurement framework. The GNW / GNH Index consists of 7 dimensions: [[economic]], [[environmental]], physical, mental, work, [[social]], and [[Politics|political]]. Most wellness areas include both subjective results (via survey) and objective [[data]].<ref>[https://www.iim-edu.org/grossnationalhappiness/ "Global GNW / GNH Index"]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150701192803/https://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/67149/1241406/version/1/file/PAE+Beachy_Zorn_2012.pdf "National Indicators for a New Era (page 81), Ben, Beachy and Juston Zorn, of the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University"]</ref><ref>[https://dugi-doc.udg.edu/bitstream/handle/10256/15117/ortuzar-fernandez.pdf?sequence=1 "Empirical Study of Healthcare and Life Satisfaction in Spain at University De Girona"]</ref>

==Disambiguation==
The GNW Index is also known as the first GNH Index or [[Gross National Happiness]] Index, not to be confused with [[Bhutan]]'s GNH Index. Both [[Econometrics|econometric]] frameworks are different in authorship, creation dates, and [[Geography|geographic]] scope. The GNW / GNH index is a global development measurement framework published in 2005 by the [[International Institute of Management and Technical Studies|International Institute of Management]] in the [[United States]].<ref>H A Hellyer, [http://www.thenational.ae/opinion/comment/the-happiness-portfolio-is-no-laughing-matter "UAE National Newspaper on Happiness Ministry Background"].</ref> <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=20R9_6rC-LoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=GNH "Ecological Economics Book - page 274"]</ref>

The [[Gross National Happiness]] phrase was coined in 1972 by [[Sicco Mansholt]], one of the founders of the [[European Union]] and the fourth President of the [[European Commission]], and was later popularized by [[Bhutan]] in the late 1990s.<ref>[http://gnh.institute/gross-national-happiness-gnh-origin.htm "The Origin of Gross National Happiness - The European GNH Institute"]</ref> However, no GNH Index existed until 2005.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317151566_The_History_of_Gross_National_Happiness "The History of Gross National Happiness, Professor Monica Correa, Universidad Dr. Rafael Belloso Chacín"]</ref>

The GNH [[philosophy]] suggested that the ideal purpose of [[Government|governments]] is to promote happiness. The philosophy remained difficult to implement due to the subjective nature of happiness, the lack of exact quantitative definition of GNH,<ref>[http://www.gpiatlantic.org/conference/papers/mcdonald.pdf "McDonald, Ross (2005). "Rethinking Development. Local Pathways to Global Wellbeing". St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada. p. 3."]</ref> and the lack of a practical model to measure the impact of [[Economic policy|economic policies]] on the subjective well-being of the citizens.<ref>[https://repositorio.iscte-iul.pt/bitstream/10071/13633/1/HappinessSeekingThesis_AnaRodrigues.pdf  Selling Happiness - Lisbon University"]</ref>

The GNW Index paper proposed the first GNH Index as a solution to help with the implementation of the GHN philosophy and was designed to transform the first generation abstract subjective political [[mission statement]] into a second generation implementation [[holistic]] (objective and subjective) concept and by treating [[happiness]] as a socioeconomic development metric that would provide an alternative to the traditional GDP indicator, the new metric would integrate subjective and objective socioeconomic development policy framework and measurement indicators.<ref>[http://gnh.institute/gross-national-happiness-research-library/happiness-economics-history-milestones-timeline.htm "Happiness Economics Timeline and Milestones - GNH Institute"]</ref><ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316091499_A_Modern_History_of_Happiness_as_Economic_Policy "A Modern History of Happiness as Economic Policy Dr Deidre Rose, University of Guelph"]</ref>

The GNW Index is a [[secular]] [[Econometrics|econometric]] model that tracks 7 subjective and objective development areas with no [[Religion|religious]] measurement components. On the other hand, Bhutan's GNH Index is a local development framework and measurement index, published by the [[Centre for Bhutan Studies and GNH Research|Centre for Bhutan Studies]] in 2012 based on 2011 Index function designed by Alkire-Foster at [[Oxford University]]. The Bhutan's GNH Index is customized to the country's [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Culture|cultural]] and spiritual values, it tracks 9 subjective happiness areas including spiritual measurement such as [[Prayer|prayers]] [[recitation]] and other [[Karma]] indicators.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.grossnationalhappiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Short-GNH-Index-edited.pdf|author1=Karma Ura|author2=Sabina Alkire|author3=Tshoki Zangmo|author4=Karma Wangdi|title=A Short Summary of Bhutan GNH Index|publisher=The Centre for Bhutan Studies|year=2012|isbn=978-99936-14-66-1}}</ref> The concepts and issues at the heart of Bhutanese approach are similar to the secular GNH Index.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSy7Ubd-PX8C&pg=PA31|author=Alastair Campbell|title=The Happy Depressive: In Pursuit of Personal and Political Happiness|publisher=Arrow Books|page=31}}</ref>

In 2006, a policy white paper providing recommendations for implementing the GNW Index metric was published by the International Institute of Management. The paper is widely referenced by academic and policy maker citing the GNW / GNH index as a potential model for local socioeconomic development and measurement.<ref>[https://www.medjones.com/happiness-economics-gross-national-wellbeing-happiness-index.htm "Happiness Economics - GNH Index Research Citations"]</ref>

==GNW survey components==
The subjective survey part of the GNW measurement system is structured into seven areas or dimensions.<ref>[https://www.iim-edu.org/polls/GrossNationalHappinessSurvey.htm "The Global Gross National Happiness Index Survey - Global GNH Index Survey"]</ref>
Each area or dimension satisfaction rating is scaled from 0–10: 0 being very dissatisfied, 5 being neutral, and 10 is very satisfied.

#Mental & Emotional Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):<br>Frequency and levels of positive vs. negative thoughts and feelings over the past year
#Physical & Health Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):<br>Physical safety and health, including risk to life, body and property and the cost and quality of healthcare, if one gets sick
#Work & Income Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):<br>Job and income to support essential living expenses, including shelter, food, transportation, and education. If a head of household, the expenses to support household/family is included
#Social Relations Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):<br>Relations with the significant other, family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and community
#Economic & Retirement Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):<br>Disposable (extra) income, which is the remaining money after paying for essential living expenses. This money can be used for leisure activities, retirement savings, investments, or charity.
#Political & Government Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):<br>Political rights, privacy and personal freedom as well the performance of the government (including socioeconomic development policies effectiveness and efficiency) 
#Living Environment Wellbeing Overall Satisfaction (0-10):<br>City/urban planning, utilities, infrastructure, traffic, architecture, landscaping and nature's pollution (including noise, air, water, and soil)

The survey also asks four qualitative questions to identify key causes of happiness and unhappiness:

#What are the top positive things in your life that make you happy?
#What are the top challenges and causes of stress in your life?
#What would you advise your government to increase your well-being and happiness?
#What are the most influential [[city]], state, federal or international projects? How are they impacting your well-being and happiness (positively or negatively)?

==Criticism==
One major criticism is that the use of subjective surveys can lead to unreliable conclusions{{original research inline|date=April 2018}}.
