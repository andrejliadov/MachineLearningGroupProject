In [[mathematics]], the '''resolvent formalism''' is a technique for applying concepts from [[complex analysis]] to the study of the [[spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s on [[Banach space|Banach spaces]] and more general spaces. Formal justification for the manipulations can be found in the framework of [[holomorphic functional calculus]].

The '''resolvent''' captures the spectral properties of an operator in the analytic structure of the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]. Given an operator {{mvar|A}}, the resolvent may be defined as
: <math> R(z;A)= (A-zI)^{-1}~. </math>

Among other uses, the resolvent may be used to solve the inhomogeneous [[Fredholm integral equation]]s; a commonly used approach is a series solution, the [[Liouville–Neumann series]].

The resolvent of {{mvar|A}} can be used to directly obtain information about the [[Spectral theorem|spectral decomposition]]
of {{mvar|A}}. For example, suppose {{mvar|λ}}  is an isolated [[eigenvalue]] in the 
[[spectrum]] of {{mvar|A}}. That is, suppose there exists a simple closed curve <math> C_\lambda </math> 
in the complex plane that separates   {{mvar|λ}} from the rest of the spectrum of {{mvar|A}}.
Then the [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]] 
: <math> -\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{C_\lambda} (A- z I)^{-1}~ dz </math>
defines a [[projection operator]] onto the  {{mvar|λ}} [[eigenspace]] of {{mvar|A}}. {{further|Frobenius covariant|Holomorphic functional calculus}}

The [[Hille–Yosida theorem]] relates the resolvent through a [[Laplace transform]] to an integral over the one-parameter [[group (mathematics)|group]] of transformations generated by {{mvar|A}}.<ref>Taylor, section 9 of Appendix A.</ref>  Thus, for example, if {{mvar|A}} is a [[Hermitian operator|Hermitian]], then {{math|''U''(''t'') {{=}} exp(''itA'')}} is a one-parameter group of unitary operators. The resolvent of ''iA'' can be expressed as the [[Laplace transform]]
: <math>R(z;iA)= \int_0^\infty e^{-zt}U(t)~dt.</math>

==History==
The first major use of the resolvent operator as a series in {{mvar|A}} (cf. [[Liouville–Neumann series]]) was by [[Ivar Fredholm]], in a landmark 1903 paper in ''Acta Mathematica'' that helped establish modern [[operator theory]].  

The name ''resolvent'' was given by [[David Hilbert]].

==Resolvent identity==
For all {{math|''z, w''}}  in   {{math|''ρ''(''A'')}}, the [[resolvent set]] of an operator  {{mvar|A}}, we have that the '''first resolvent identity''' (also called Hilbert's identity) holds:<ref>Dunford and Schwartz, Vol I, Lemma 6, p. 568.</ref>
:<math>R(z; A) - R(w; A) = (z-w) R(z;A) R(w;A)\, . </math>
(Note that Dunford and Schwartz, cited, define the resolvent as {{math|(''zI −A'')<sup>−1</sup>}}, instead, so that the formula above  differs in sign from theirs.)

The '''second resolvent identity''' is a generalization of the first resolvent identity, above, useful for comparing the resolvents of two distinct operators.    Given operators  {{mvar|A}} and  {{mvar|B}}, both defined on the same linear space,  and {{mvar|z}}  in {{math|''ρ''(''A'')&nbsp;∩&nbsp;''ρ''(''B'')}} the following identity holds,<ref> Hille and Phillips, Theorem 4.8.2, p. 126 </ref>
:<math>R(z;A) - R(z;B) = R(z;A)(B-A) R(z;B) \, .  </math>

==Compact resolvent==
When studying an [[unbounded operator]]     {{mvar|A}}: {{mvar|H}} → {{mvar|H}} on a [[Hilbert space]]  {{mvar|H}}, if there exists <math>z\in\rho(A)</math> such that <math>R(z;A)</math> is a [[compact operator]], we say that  {{mvar|A}} has compact resolvent. The spectrum <math>\sigma(A)</math> of such  {{mvar|A}}  is a discrete subset of <math>\mathbb{C}</math>. If furthermore {{mvar|A}} is [[self-adjoint]], then <math>\sigma(A)\subset\mathbb{R}</math> and there exists an orthonormal basis <math>\{v_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}</math> of eigenvectors of  {{mvar|A}} with eigenvalues <math>\{\lambda_i\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}</math> respectively. Also, <math>\{\lambda_i\}</math> has no finite [[accumulation point]].<ref>Taylor, p. 515.</ref>
