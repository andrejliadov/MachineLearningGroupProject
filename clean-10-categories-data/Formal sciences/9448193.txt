Nodes can be either switched on (red) or off (blue). Thin (black) arrows symbolise the inputs of the [[Boolean function]] which is a simple "copy"-function for each node.

A '''Boolean network''' consists of a discrete set of [[boolean variable]]s each of which has a [[Boolean function]] (possibly different for each variable) assigned to it which takes inputs from a subset of those variables and output that determines the state of the variable it is assigned to.  This set of functions in effect determines a topology (connectivity) on the set of variables, which then become nodes in a [[network (mathematics)|network]]. Usually, the dynamics of the system is taken as a discrete [[time series]] where the state of the entire network at time ''t''+1 is determined by evaluating each variable's function on the state of the network at time ''t''.  This may be done [[synchronous]]ly or [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]]ly.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Naldi|first1=A.|last2=Monteiro|first2=P. T.|last3=Mussel|first3=C.|last4=Kestler|first4=H.

Boolean networks have been used in biology to model regulatory networks. Although Boolean networks are a crude simplification of genetic reality where genes are not simple binary switches, there are several cases where they correctly capture the correct pattern of expressed and suppressed genes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Albert|first1=Réka|last2=Othmer|first2=Hans G|title=The topology of the regulatory interactions predicts the expression pattern of the segment polarity genes in Drosophila melanogaster|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=July 2003|volume=223|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(03)00035-3|pmid=12782112|pmc=6388622|citeseerx=10.1.1.13.3370}}<!--|accessdate=25 November 2014--></ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=J.|last2=Bench|first2=A.

== Classical model ==
A Boolean network is a particular kind of [[sequential dynamical system]], where time and states are discrete, i.e. both the set of variables and the set of states in the time series each have a [[bijection]] onto an integer series. Such systems are like [[cellular automata]] on networks, except for the fact that when they are set up each node has a rule that is randomly chosen from all ''2{{sup|2{{sup|K}}}}'' possible ones with ''K'' inputs. With ''K=2'' class 2 behavior tends to dominate. But for ''K>2'', the behavior one sees quickly approaches what is typical for a random mapping in which the network representing the evolution of the ''2{{sup|N}}'' states of the ''N'' underlying nodes is itself connected essentially randomly.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wolfram|first1=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|date=2002|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|location=Champaign, Illinois|isbn=978-1579550080|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/936 936]|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/936|accessdate=15 March 2018|url-access=registration}}</ref>

A '''random Boolean network'''&nbsp;(RBN) is one that is randomly selected from the set of all possible boolean networks of a particular size, ''N''.  One then can study statistically, how the expected properties of such networks depend on various statistical properties of the ensemble of all possible networks.  For example, one may study how the RBN behavior changes as the average connectivity is changed.

The first Boolean networks were proposed by [[Stuart A. Kauffman]] in 1969, as [[random]] models of [[genetic regulatory network]]s<ref name=KauffmanOriginal>{{cite journal|last1=Kauffman|first1=Stuart|title=Homeostasis and Differentiation in Random Genetic Control Networks|journal=Nature|date=11 October 1969|volume=224|issue=5215|pages=177–178|doi=10.1038/224177a0|pmid=5343519|bibcode = 1969Natur.224..177K |s2cid=4179318}}<!--|accessdate=25 November 2014--></ref> but their mathematical understanding only started in the 2000s.<ref name=AldanaCoppersmithKadanoff>{{cite book|last1=Aldana|first1=Maximo|last2=Coppersmith|first2=Susan|author2-link= Susan Coppersmith |last3=Kadanoff|first3=Leo P.|title=Boolean Dynamics with Random Couplings|journal=Perspectives and Problems in Nonlinear Sciences|date=2003|pages=23–89|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-21789-5_2|arxiv=nlin/0204062|isbn=978-1-4684-9566-9|s2cid=15024306}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=nlin.AO/0408006|last1=Gershenson|first1=Carlos|title=Introduction to Random Boolean Networks|journal=In Bedau, M., P.

=== Attractors ===

Since a Boolean network has only 2<sup>''N''</sup> possible states, a trajectory will sooner or later  reach a previously visited state, and thus, since the dynamics are deterministic, the trajectory will fall into a steady state or cycle called an [[attractor]] (though in the broader field of dynamical systems a cycle is only an attractor if perturbations from it lead back to it). If the attractor has only a single state it is called a ''point attractor'', and if the attractor consists of more than one state it is called a ''cycle attractor''. The set of states that lead to an attractor is called the ''basin'' of the attractor. States which occur only at the beginning of trajectories (no trajectories lead ''to'' them), are called ''garden-of-Eden'' states<ref name=WuenscheBook>{{cite book|last1=Wuensche|first1=Andrew|title=Exploring discrete dynamics : [the DDLab manual : tools for researching cellular automata, random Boolean and multivalue neworks [sic] and beyond]|date=2011|publisher=Luniver Press|location=Frome, England|isbn=9781905986316|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qsktzY_Vg8QC&pg=PA16|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref> and the dynamics of the network flow from these states towards attractors. The time it takes to reach an attractor is called ''transient time''.<ref name=DrosselRbn />

With growing computer power and increasing understanding of the seemingly simple model, different authors gave different estimates for the mean number and length of the attractors, here a brief summary of key publications.<ref name=GreilReview>{{cite journal|last1=Greil|first1=Florian|title=Boolean Networks as Modeling Framework|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|date=2012|volume=3|pages=178|doi=10.3389/fpls.2012.00178|pmid=22912642|pmc=3419389}}<!--|accessdate=26 November 2014--></ref>

== Stability ==
In dynamical systems theory, the structure and length of the attractors of a network corresponds to the dynamic phase of the network. The '''stability of Boolean networks''' depends on the connections of their [[Node (graph theory)|node]]s. A Boolean network can exhibit stable, critical or [[chaotic behavior]]. This phenomenon is governed by a critical value of the average number of connections of nodes (<math>K_{c}</math>), and can be characterized by the [[Hamming distance]] as distance measure. In the unstable regime, the distance between two initially close states on average grows exponentially in time, while in the stable regime it decreases exponentially. In this, with "initially close states" one means that the Hamming distance is small compared with the number of nodes (<math>N</math>) in the network.

For '''N-K-model'''<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kauffman |first=S.

The state of a given node <math> n_{i} </math> is updated according to its [[truth table]], whose outputs are randomly populated. <math> p_{i} </math> denotes the probability of assigning an off output to a given series of input signals.

If <math> p_{i}=p=const. </math> for every node, the transition between the stable and chaotic range depends on <math> p </math>. According to [[Bernard Derrida]] and [[Yves Pomeau]]<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Random Networks of Automata: A Simple Annealed Approximation|url = http://stacks.iop.org/0295-5075/1/i=2/a=001?key=crossref.8cf81041d96c6144f3a397d9cf72cf09|journal = Europhysics Letters (EPL)|date = 1986-01-15|pages = 45–49|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi = 10.1209/0295-5075/1/2/001|first1 = B|last1 = Derrida|first2 = Y|last2 = Pomeau|bibcode = 1986EL......1...45D}}</ref>
