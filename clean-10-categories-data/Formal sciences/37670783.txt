==History==
The classification of Buddha teachings is discussed very early by Mahayana Buddhists in China. In 600 AD there were 10 main classifications.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.qts.com.cn/bezz/berr06/201101/651.html |title=【报恩论坛】智者大师评判“南三北七”的意义（连载一） |access-date=November 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101204634/http://qts.com.cn/bezz/berr06/201101/651.html |archive-date=November 1, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.huayen.org.tw/thesis/13/1315.pdf 五、六世紀中國各家的判教理論]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Five Periods and Eight Teachings== 
[[Zhiyi]] of the [[Tiantai]] school categorized the [[Buddha]]'s teachings in the [[Mohe Zhiguan]] (摩訶止觀) and Fahua Xuanyi (法華玄義). These are classed under what are now known as the ''Five Periods and Eight Teachings'' (五時八教).

The Five Periods are as follows:
*[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Flower Ornament]] Period (華嚴時)
*[[Āgama (Buddhism)|Āgamas]] Period (阿含時)
*[[Mahayana|Vaipūlya]] (方等時)
*[[Prajnaparamita|Prajñā]] (般若時)
*[[Lotus Sutra|Lotus]]-[[Nirvana Sutra|Nirvāṇa]] Period (法華涅槃時). 

The Eight Teachings are subdivided into two groups:

*The Fourfold Methods of Conversion (化儀四教)
**Sudden Teaching (頓教)
**Gradual Teaching (漸教)
**Secret Teaching (秘密教)
**Variable Teaching (不定教)
*The Fourfold Doctrines of Conversion (化法四教)
**Tripitaka Teaching (三藏教)
**Shared Teaching (通教)
**Distinctive Teaching (別教)
**Complete Teaching (圓教)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131103025354/http://www.buddhistdoor.com/OldWeb/bdoor/archive/nutshell/teach70.htm Buddhism in a Nutshell – Chap 70]</ref>
[[Tiantai]] followed this classification.

==Five Divisions and Ten Schools==
[[Fazang]] wrote Huayan Yisheng Jiaoyi Fenqi Zhang (華嚴一乘教義分齊章)<ref>[http://feikongfeise.blog.163.com/blog/static/8197498520087710186372 《华严五教章》简介]</ref> in which he classified Buddhist teachings into ''Five Divisions and Ten Schools'' (五教十宗). 

*[[Hīnayāna]] teaching (小乘教)
**The doctrine of the reality of both the self and the dharmas (我法俱有宗) ([[Pudgalavada|Vātsīputrīya]])
**The doctrine that the self is non-substantial but the dharmas are real, and that the past, present, and future exist independently (法有我無宗) ([[Sarvāstivāda]])
**The doctrine that the reality of the dharmas exists only in the present and not in the past or the future (法無去來宗) ([[Mahāsāṃghika]])
**The doctrine that the present contains both reality and unreality (現通假實宗) ([[Prajñaptivāda]])
**The doctrine that worldly truth is unreal, but that Buddhist truth is real (俗妄真實宗) ([[Lokottaravāda]])
**The doctrine that all things and phenomena are mere names without self-nature (諸法但有宗) ([[Ekavyāvahārika]])
*Elementary Mahāyāna teaching (大乘初教)
**The doctrine that maintains the non-substantiality of all things (一切皆空宗) ([[East Asian Mādhyamaka|Sānlùn]])
*Final Mahāyāna teaching(大乘終教)
**The doctrine that recognizes an unchanging truth that is the essence (bhūtatathatā) of all things(真實不空宗) ([[Tiantai|Tiāntāi]])
*Sudden Mahāyāna teaching (大乘頓教) 
**The doctrine that the truth lies in the mystic realm beyond the polarity of subject and object. (相想俱絕宗) ([[Chan Buddhism|Chán]])
*Perfect Teaching (of the [[Ekayāna|One Vehicle]]) (一乘圓教)
**The doctrine that all things exist in perfect harmony and interrelation (圓明具德宗) ([[Huayan|Huáyán]])<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131103025328/http://www.buddhistdoor.com/OldWeb/bdoor/archive/nutshell/teach66.htm Buddhism in a Nutshell – Chap 66]</ref><ref>[http://www.huayen.org.tw/b3.asp 論文集索引] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20040710045959/http://www.huayen.org.tw/b3.asp |date=July 10, 2004 }}</ref>
