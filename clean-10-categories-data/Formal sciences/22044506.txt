'''Augmented learning''' is an on-demand [[learning]] technique where the environment adapts to the learner. By providing remediation on-demand, learners can gain greater understanding of a topic while stimulating discovery and learning.<ref>[https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/09/an-interview-with-mcgraw-hill-higher-education-president-brian-kibby-about-the-future-of-ebooks-tctv/ Augmented learning and super-adaptive learning]</ref>

Technologies incorporating [[rich media]] and interaction have demonstrated the educational potential that scholars, teachers and students are embracing.  Instead of focusing on [[memorization]], the learner experiences an [[adaptive learning]] experience based upon the current context. The augmented content can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment by displaying text, images, video or even playing audio (music or speech). This additional information is commonly shown in a pop-up window for computer-based environments.

Most implementations of augmented learning are forms of e-learning. In desktop computing environments, the learner receives supplemental, contextual information through an on-screen, pop-up window, [[toolbar]] or [[Sidebar (computing)|sidebar]]. As the user navigates a website, e-mail or document, the learner associates the supplemental information with the key text selected by a mouse, touch or other input device. In mobile environments, augmented learning has also been deployed on tablets and smartphones.

Augmented learning is closely related to augmented intelligence ([[intelligence amplification]]) and [[augmented reality]]. Augmented intelligence applies information processing capabilities to extend the processing capabilities of the human mind through [[distributed cognition]]. Augmented intelligence provides extra support for autonomous intelligence and has a long history of success. Mechanical and electronic devices that function as augmented intelligence range from the [[abacus]], calculator, personal computers and smart phones. Software with augmented intelligence provide supplemental information that is related to the context of the user. When an individual's name appears on the screen, a pop-up window could display a person's organizational affiliation, contact information and most recent interactions.

In mobile reality systems,<ref name="Augmented Learning">[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1156186 Augmented Learning], Augmented Learning: Context-Aware Mobile Augmented Reality Architecture for Learning</ref> the annotation may appear on the learner's individual "heads-up display" or through headphones for audio instruction. For example, apps for Google Glasses can provide video tutorials and interactive click-throughs, .<ref name="Augmented Reality">[http://edcetera.rafter.com/how-augmented-reality-can-enhance-learning-in-higher-ed/ Augmented Reality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407044513/http://edcetera.rafter.com/how-augmented-reality-can-enhance-learning-in-higher-ed/ |date=April 7, 2014 }}</ref>

Foreign language educators are also beginning to incorporate augmented learning techniques to traditional paper-and-pen-based exercises. For example, augmented information is presented near the primary subject matter, allowing the learner to learn how to write glyphs while understanding the meaning of the underlying characters. See [[#Understanding language|Understanding language]], below.

==Just-in-time understanding and learning==
Augmentation tools can help learners understand issues, acquire relevant information and solve complex issues by presenting supplementary information at the time of need or "on demand." This contrasts with traditional methods of associative learning, including [[rote learning]], [[classical conditioning]] and [[observational learning]], where the learning is performed in advance of the learner's need to recall or apply what has been learned.

Snyder and Wilson<ref>[http://www.knowledgeharvesting.org/documents/Computer%20Augmented%20Learning.pdf Computer Augmented Learning: The Basis of Sustained Knowledge Management] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827221021/http://www.knowledgeharvesting.org/documents/Computer%20Augmented%20Learning.pdf |date=August 27, 2008 }}</ref> assert that just-in-time learning is not sufficient. Long-term learning demands continuous training should be individualized and built upon individual competencies and strengths.

==Understanding language==
Augmented learning tools have been useful for learners to gain an enhanced understanding of words or to understand a foreign language. The interactive, dynamic nature of these on-demand language assistants can provide definitions, sample sentences and even audible pronunciations. When sentences or blocks of text are selected, the words are read aloud while the user follows along with the native text or phonetics. Speech rate control can tailor the text-to-speech (TTS) to keep pace with the learner's comprehension.

== Understanding Science ==
Augmented reality has come a long way in the science field, but it is still in its infancy.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Kun-Hung|last2=Tsai|first2=Chin-Chung|date=2012-08-03|title=Affordances of Augmented Reality in Science Learning: Suggestions for Future Research|journal=Journal of Science Education and Technology|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=449–462|doi=10.1007/s10956-012-9405-9|issn=1059-0145}}</ref> They have started using webcams, making them read a certain marker label, then an object where the label would be comes up on the screen. Developers are continuing to gather information on how AR ([[augmented reality]]) could take its part in the learning environment. Over the past few years there have been technologies added to the classroom such as computers, laptops, projectors, white boards and much more. It is allowing students to be more engaged in what is happening.<ref name=":0" /> 

Students are also now able to take notes without having to listening to what the teacher is saying, but instead writing what they typed on the projector.<ref name="Eric Klopfer" /> The notes can be more thorough and to the point, rather than an entire explanation. With the help of AR we can also see pictures on the board showing students the space in between certain objects such as planets or atoms.

==Making learning fun==
One researcher<ref name="Eric Klopfer">[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=11466 Klopfer, Eric] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223005434/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=11466 |date=December 23, 2008 }}, Augmented Learning: Research and Design of Mobile Educational Games</ref> has suggested that handheld devices like cell phones and portable game machines (Game Boy, PlayStation Portable) can make an impact on learning. These mobile devices excel in their portability, context sensitivity, connectivity and ubiquity. By incorporating social dynamics in a real-world context, learning games can create compelling environments for learners.

At the [[Allard Pierson Museum]] in Amsterdam, visitors view information on-demand at the "A Future for the Past" exhibit. In a virtual reconstruction of [[Satricum]] and the Forum Romanum, users can call up information that is overlaid on room-sized photos and other images. The museum uses both stationary displays and mobile computers to allow users to view translucent images and information keyed to their specific interest.<ref name="Augmented reality">[https://www.engadget.com/2009/04/13/augmented-reality-on-hand-at-museum-in-the-netherlands-threaten/ Flatley, Joseph L.], Augmented reality at the Allard Pierson Museum in Netherland</ref>

==Is augmentation really "learning"?==
Critics may see learning augmentation as a crutch that precludes memorization; similar arguments have been made about using [[calculators]] in the past. Just as rote learning is also not a substitute for understanding, augmented learning is simply another faculty for helping learners recall, present and process information.

Current research suggests that even unconscious visual learning can be effective.<ref name="cell-neuron">{{cite journal |title=Rewards Evoke Learning of Unconsciously Processed Visual Stimuli in Adult Humans |last1=Seitz |first1=Aaron R. |last2=Kim |first2=Dongho |last3=Watanabe |first3=Takeo |journal=Neuron |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=700–707 |date=12 March 2009 |url=http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(09)00083-X |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.01.016|pmid=19285467 |pmc=2683263 }}</ref> Visual stimuli, rendered in flashes of information, showed signs of learning even when the human adult subjects were unaware of the stimulus or reward contingencies.

One way to look at augmentation is whether the process leads to improvement in terms of signal to noise ratio for the individual learner. Diverse predispositions among varied learners means there can be great disparity in signal processing by different learners for any one particular instruction method.

== Augmented Learning in Education ==
Augmented learning has allowed not only students to learn, but also their parents. Tools like mobile games have made it easier for parents to understand more fully what their child is learning in school. Technology brings the childs content to a new platform which is helpful to parents when trying to make meaningful connections to what their child is learning in school. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I0kaFNaK704C&pg=PR5&dq=augmented+learning+in+science#v=onepage&q=augmented%20learning%20in%20science&f=false|title=Augmented Learning: Research and Design of Mobile Educational Games|last=Klopfer|first=Eric|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262113151|language=en}}</ref> Furthermore, augmented reality has brought a new way of learning to young children to have the ability to articulate words. By using marker labels in books that are read by a tablet, making pictures appear on the screen along with audio narration for enhanced reading. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Kun-Hung|last2=Tsai|first2=Chin-Chung|date=2014-11-11|title=The interaction of child-parent shared reading with an augmented reality (AR) picture book and parents' conceptions of AR learning|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=203–222|doi=10.1111/bjet.12228|issn=0007-1013}}</ref>

[[Augmented reality|Augmented Reality]] in education has the potential to change the timing and location of the conventional learning process. This style of learning introduces new methods of studying. With the boom of [[technology]] and younger students being the biggest users, the learning platform has the ability to connect this generation and their smartphones to gain knowledge. Though it has yet to be fully discovered, Augmented Reality in education is looking to become a large market.

This style of learning can gain attention and expand the students interest in subject and topics he would not learn or come across in the conventional classroom lecture. Extra data such as fun facts, visual models, or historical data from events could give a wider understanding of the topics being taught. The learning platform hopes to explain abstract concepts, engage and interact with the learner, and discover and learn additional information about what they what to learn.
