{{short description|University academic program}}

'''Computer Science & Engineering''' ('''CSE''') is an academic program at many [[University|universities]] which comprises scientific and engineering aspects of computing. CSE is also a term often used in Europe to translate the name of [[engineering informatics]] academic programs.

==Academic courses==
Academic programs vary between colleges. Courses usually include introduction to [[Computer programming|programming]], introduction to [[algorithms]] and [[data structures]], [[computer architecture]], [[operating systems]], [[computer networks]], [[parallel computing]], [[embedded systems]], [[algorithmics|algorithms design]], [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|circuit analysis]] and [[electronics]], [[digital logic]] and [[Processor (computing)|processor]] design, [[computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]], [[scientific computing]], [[software engineering]], [[database|database systems]], [[digital signal processing]], [[virtualization]], [[computer simulation]]s and [[game programming|games]] programming. CSE programs also include core subjects of theoretical computer science such as [[theory of computation]], [[numerical methods]], [[machine learning]], [[programming language theory|programming theory]] and [[Programming paradigm|paradigms]]. Modern academic programs also cover emerging computing fields like [[image processing]], [[data science]], [[robotics]], [[bio-inspired computing]], [[computational biology]], [[autonomic computing]] and [[artificial intelligence]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Courses in Computer Science and Engineering {{!}} Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering|url=https://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/|access-date=2020-08-22|website=www.cs.washington.edu}}</ref> Most of the above CSE areas require initial [[mathematics|mathematical]] knowledge, hence the first year of study is dominated by mathematical courses, primarily [[discrete mathematics]], [[mathematical analysis]], [[linear algebra]] and [[statistics]], as well as the basics of [[physics]] - [[Field theory (physics)|field theory]] and [[electromagnetism]].
