'''3G MIMO''' describes [[MIMO]] techniques which have been considered as [[3G]] standard techniques.
 
[[MIMO]], as the state of the art of [[intelligent antenna]] (IA), improves the performance of radio systems by embedding electronics [[intelligence]] into the spatial processing unit. Spatial processing includes spatial precoding at the transmitter and spatial postcoding at the receiver, which are dual each other from information signal processing theoretic point of view. Intelligent antenna is technology which represents [[smart antenna]], [[multiple antenna research|multiple antenna]] ([[Multiple-input multiple-output communications|MIMO]]), self-tracking directional antenna, [[Cooperative wireless communications|cooperative virtual antenna]] and so on.

== Technology ==
Spatial precoding of intelligent antenna includes spatial beamforming and spatial coding. In wireless communications, spatial precoding has been developing for high reliability, high rate and lower interference as shown in the following table.

=== Summary of 3G MIMO ===
The table summarizes the history of 3G MIMO techniques candidated for 3G standards. Although the table additionally contains the future part but the contents are not clearly filled out since the future is not precisely predictable.

=== IA in ad hoc networking ===
{{main|Wireless ad hoc network}}
IA technology enables client terminals, which have either multiple antennas or a self-tracking directional antenna, to communicate to each other with as high as possible signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR). Assume that there is a source terminal, a destination terminal, and some candidate interference terminals. Compared to conventional approaches, an advanced IA based terminal will perform spatial precoding (spatial beamforming and/or spatial coding) not only to enhance the signal power at the destination terminal but also to diminish the interfering power at interference terminals. As a human does, the advanced IA terminal is given to know that occurring high interference to other terminals will eventually degrade the performance of the associated wireless network.

== Comparisons ==

=== Intelligent antenna (IA) vs. Cognitive radio (CR) ===
However, it requires intelligent multiple or [[cooperation|cooperative]] antenna array. On the contrary, [[cognitive radio]] (CR) allows user terminals to sense the other service usage of spectrum beans to share the spectrum among users, which is so, cognitive spectrum sharing technology. The following table compares the different points between two approach for future wireless systems: Intelligent antenna (IA) vs. Cognitive radio (CR).
