The '''Andre Walker Hair Typing System''' is classification system for hair types created in the 1990s by [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s stylist [[Andre Walker]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.women-info.com/en/andre-walker-hair-typing-system/|title=Andre Walker hair typing system - Women Health Info Blog|date=2017-02-01|work=Women Health Info Blog|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-hair-chart/|title=The Hair Chart - 99% Invisible|work=99% Invisible|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.oprah.com/style/african-american-hair-advice-from-oprahs-stylist/all|title=Q&A with Andre Walker|work=Oprah.com|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-us}}</ref> It was originally created to market Walker's line of hair care products but has since been widely adopted as a hair type classification system. The system includes images of each hair type to aid classification. The system has been criticised for an apparent hierarchy which values caucasian hair over other hair types. In 2018 the system was the subject of episodes of the [[podcast|podcasts]] ''[[99% Invisible]]'' and ''The Stoop''.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.studio2121.com/the-andre-walker-system-hair-typing-chart/|title=The Andre Walker System: Hair Typing Chart - The Salon and Spa at Studio 2121|website=www.studio2121.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestoop.org/home/2018/4/20/episode-13-are-you-a-4c|title=Episode 13: Are you a 4C?|work=The Stoop|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}</ref>
