'''Digital signal processing''' ('''DSP''') is the use of [[digital processing]], such as by computers or more specialized [[digital signal processor]]s, to perform a wide variety of [[signal processing]] operations.  The [[digital signals]] processed in this manner are a sequence of numbers that represent [[Sampling (signal processing)|samples]] of a [[continuous variable]] in a domain such as time, space, or frequency. In [[digital electronics]], a digital signal is represented as a [[pulse train]],<ref>{{cite book |author=B.

Digital signal processing and [[analog signal processing]] are subfields of signal processing. DSP applications include [[Audio signal processing|audio]] and [[speech processing]], [[sonar]], [[radar]] and other [[sensor array]] processing, [[spectral density estimation]], [[statistical signal processing]], [[digital image processing]], [[data compression]], [[video coding]], [[audio coding]], [[image compression]], signal processing for [[telecommunication]]s, [[control system]]s, [[biomedical engineering]], and [[seismology]], among others.

DSP can involve linear or nonlinear operations. Nonlinear signal processing is closely related to [[nonlinear system identification]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Billings |first=Stephen A. |title=Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-119-94359-4 |date=Sep 2013 |location=UK}}</ref>  and can be implemented in the [[Time domain|time]], [[Frequency domain|frequency]], and [[Film|spatio-temporal domains]].<!--sort of a flip stab at a wikilink for this concept. Readers ''might'' get the idea.-->

The application of digital computation to signal processing allows for many advantages over analog processing in many applications, such as [[error detection and correction]] in transmission as well as [[data compression]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Digital Signal Processing: Instant access |last=Broesch |first=James D. |last2=Stranneby |first2=Dag |last3=Walker |first3=William |date=2008-10-20 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann-Newnes |edition=1 |isbn=9780750689762 |page=3}}</ref> Digital signal processing is also fundamental to [[digital electronics|digital technology]], such as [[digital telecommunication]] and [[wireless communications]].<ref name="Srivastava">{{cite book |last1=Srivastava |first1=Viranjay M. |last2=Singh |first2=Ghanshyam |title=MOSFET Technologies for Double-Pole Four-Throw Radio-Frequency Switch |date=2013 |publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]] |isbn=9783319011653 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fkO9BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1}}</ref> DSP is applicable to both [[streaming data]] and static (stored) data.

== Signal sampling ==
{{Main|Sampling (signal processing)}}

To digitally analyze and manipulate an analog signal, it must be digitized with an [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Walden |first=R. H. |date=1999 |title=Analog-to-digital converter survey and analysis |journal=IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=539–550 |doi=10.1109/49.761034}}</ref> Sampling is usually carried out in two stages, [[discretization]] and [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]. Discretization means that the signal is divided into equal intervals of time, and each interval is represented by a single measurement of amplitude.  Quantization means each amplitude measurement is approximated by a value from a finite set.  Rounding [[real numbers]] to integers is an example.

The [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] states that a signal can be exactly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling frequency is greater than twice the highest frequency component in the signal. In practice, the sampling frequency is often significantly higher than twice the [[Nyquist frequency]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Candes |first=E. J. |last2=Wakin |first2=M. B. |date=2008 |title=An Introduction To Compressive Sampling |journal=IEEE Signal Processing Magazine |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=21–30 |doi=10.1109/MSP.2007.914731}}</ref>

Theoretical DSP analyses and derivations are typically performed on [[discrete-time signal]] models with no amplitude inaccuracies ([[quantization error]]), "created" by the abstract process of [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]]. Numerical methods require a quantized signal, such as those produced by an ADC.  The processed result might be a frequency spectrum or a set of statistics.  But often it is another quantized signal that is converted back to analog form by a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC).

== Domains ==
In DSP, engineers usually study digital signals in one of the following domains: [[time domain]] (one-dimensional signals), spatial domain (multidimensional signals), [[frequency domain]], and [[wavelet]] domains. They choose the domain in which to process a signal by making an informed assumption (or by trying different possibilities) as to which domain best represents the essential characteristics of the signal and the processing to be applied to it. A sequence of samples from a measuring device produces a temporal or spatial domain representation, whereas a [[discrete Fourier transform]] produces the frequency domain representation.

=== Time and space domains ===
[[Time domain]] refers to the analysis of signals with respect to time. Similarly, space domain refers to the analysis of signals with respect to position, e.g., pixel location for the case of image processing.

The most common processing approach in the time or space domain is enhancement of the input signal through a method called filtering. [[Digital filter]]ing generally consists of some linear transformation of a number of surrounding samples around the current sample of the input or output signal. The surrounding samples may be identified with respect to time or space. The output of a linear digital filter to any given input may be calculated by [[convolution|convolving]] the input signal with an [[impulse response]].

=== Frequency domain ===
{{Main|Frequency domain}}

Signals are converted from time or space domain to the frequency domain usually through use of the [[Fourier transform]]. The Fourier transform converts the time or space information to a magnitude and phase component of each frequency. With some applications, how the phase varies with frequency can be a significant consideration. Where phase is unimportant, often the Fourier transform is converted to the power spectrum, which is the magnitude of each frequency component squared.

The most common purpose for analysis of signals in the frequency domain is analysis of signal properties. The engineer can study the spectrum to determine which frequencies are present in the input signal and which are missing. Frequency domain analysis is also called ''spectrum-'' or ''spectral analysis''.

Filtering, particularly in non-realtime work can also be achieved in the frequency domain, applying the filter and then converting back to the time domain. This can be an efficient implementation and can give essentially any filter response including excellent approximations to [[brickwall filter]]s.

There are some commonly used frequency domain transformations. For example, the [[cepstrum]] converts a signal to the frequency domain through Fourier transform, takes the logarithm, then applies another Fourier transform. This emphasizes the harmonic structure of the original spectrum.

===Z-plane analysis===
Digital filters come in both IIR and FIR types. Whereas FIR filters are always stable, IIR filters have feedback loops that may become unstable and oscillate. The [[Z-transform]] provides a tool for analyzing stability issues of digital IIR filters. It is analogous to the [[Laplace transform]], which is used to design and analyze analog IIR filters.

===Wavelet===
[[File:Jpeg2000 2-level wavelet transform-lichtenstein.png|thumb|300px|An example of the 2D discrete wavelet transform that is used in [[JPEG2000]]. The original image is high-pass filtered, yielding the three large images, each describing local changes in brightness (details) in the original image. It is then low-pass filtered and downscaled, yielding an approximation image; this image is high-pass filtered to produce the three smaller detail images, and low-pass filtered to produce the final approximation image in the upper-left.]]
In [[numerical analysis]] and [[functional analysis]], a [[discrete wavelet transform]] is any [[wavelet transform]] for which the [[wavelet]]s are discretely sampled. As with other wavelet transforms, a key advantage it has over [[Fourier transform]]s is temporal resolution: it captures both frequency ''and'' location information. The accuracy of the joint time-frequency resolution is limited by the [[Uncertainty principle#Signal processing|uncertainty principle]] of time-frequency.

== Implementation ==
DSP [[algorithm]]s may be run on general-purpose computers and [[digital signal processor]]s. DSP algorithms are also implemented on purpose-built hardware such as [[application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASICs). Additional technologies for digital signal processing include more powerful general purpose [[microprocessor]]s, [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs), [[digital signal controller]]s (mostly for industrial applications such as motor control), and [[stream processing|stream processors]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Digital Signal Processing and Applications |last=Stranneby |first=Dag |last2=Walker |first2=William |edition=2nd |publisher=Elsevier |year=2004 |isbn=0-7506-6344-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKK1DdqcDVUC&pg=PA241}}</ref>

For systems that do not have a [[real-time computing]] requirement and the signal data (either input or output) exists in data files, processing may be done economically with a general-purpose computer.  This is essentially no different from any other [[data processing]], except DSP mathematical techniques (such as the [[Discrete cosine transform|DCT]] and [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]]) are used, and the sampled data is usually assumed to be uniformly sampled in time or space.  An example of such an application is processing [[digital photograph]]s with software such as [[Photoshop]].

When the application requirement is real-time, DSP is often implemented using specialized or dedicated processors or microprocessors, sometimes using multiple processors or multiple processing cores. These may process data using fixed-point arithmetic or floating point. For more demanding applications [[FPGA]]s may be used.<ref>{{cite web |last=JPFix |title=FPGA-Based Image Processing Accelerator |url=http://www.jpfix.com/About_Us/Articles/FPGA-Based_Image_Processing_Ac/fpga-based_image_processing_ac.html |date=2006 |accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref> For the most demanding applications or high-volume products, [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s might be designed specifically for the application.
