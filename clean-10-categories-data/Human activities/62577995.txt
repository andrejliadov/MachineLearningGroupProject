A [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States|United States postage stamp]] and the names of a number of recreational and cultural facilities, schools, streets and other facilities and institutions throughout the [[United States]] have commemorated [[Benjamin Banneker]]'s documented and mythical accomplishments throughout the years since he lived (1731–1806) (see [[Mythology of Benjamin Banneker]]). Among such [[memorialization]]s of this [[Free Negro|free African American]] [[almanac]] author, [[surveying|surveyor]], [[Land tenure|landowner]] and [[farmer]] who had knowledge of [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]] and [[natural history]] was a biographical verse that [[Rita Dove]], a future [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate of the United States]], wrote in 1983 while on the faculty of [[Arizona State University]].

==Benjamin Banneker postage stamp==
On February 15, 1980, during Black History Month, the United States Postal Service issued in Annapolis, Maryland, a 15 cent [[Commemorative stamp|commemorative postage stamp]] that featured a portrait of Banneker.<ref name=stamp2>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818215049/http://www.xyht.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Banneker2.jpg |archivedate=2015-08-18 |url=http://www.xyht.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Banneker2.jpg |title=Image and United States Postal Service description of Benjamin Banneker postage stamp|quote=The U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp in 1980 with this description: "Benjamin Banneker first achieved national recognition for his scientific work in the 1791 survey of the Federal Territory ...

Lacking such, an image frequently used is a woodcut portrait bust of a young black man, imaginary and not based on life, wearing the typical Quaker garb of the period. Purported to be of Banneker, this image illustrated the cover of a 1797 edition of one of his almanacs. The most accurate representation known may be found on a modern mural painting by the late William H. Smith of the survey of the federal territory. It hangs in the Maryland House on the John F. Kennedy Highway in Aberdeen, Maryland. In 1980 the U.S. Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Banneker based on imagined features. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |archivedate=2016-02-03 }}</ref>

Constructed in the 1850s, the Bannaky house is the most prominent feature on the Park and Museum property and is symbol of the Oella’s enduring history. Beginning as just a one room house, the Bannaky house steadily grew with time as several families called it home.  Upon learning about the legacy of Benjamin Banneker and his property, Baltimore County purchased the house and 42.5 acres the surrounding property to establish the Benjamin Banneker Historical Park. The house was later restored in 2004 as an office complex. It is listed on the [[Maryland Historical Trust]] Inventory of Historic Properties. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218064904/https://www.bannekerfoundation.com/single-post/2016/04/09/New-Signs-Coming-Soon |archivedate=2017-02-18 }}</ref><ref group="a">Coordinates of Molly Banneky House: {{coord| 39.270297|-76.776638|type:landmark|name=Molly Banneky House in Benjamin Banneker Historical Park|format=dms}}</ref>

The rings of the fountain and basin in the center of the site are reiterated in the benches, double rows of [[Platanus × acerifolia|London plane tree]]s, and low concrete walls that establish the plaza's edge. The ground plane is paved with granite squares, a continuation of L'Enfant Promenade's materials.

In 1970, the [[District of Columbia home rule#History of self-government|District of Columbia City Council]] passed a resolution that petitioned the NPS to rename the Overlook as Banneker Park, arguing that the council had already renamed the adjacent highway circle as Banneker Circle, S.W.<ref name=inventory/> The NPS thereupon hosted a dedication ceremony in 1971 that renamed the Overlook as "Benjamin Banneker Park".<ref name="Bedini p. 318">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/318 Bedini, 1999, p. 318.] "In the two centuries since Banneker's death, his achievements have been forgotten or misrepresented .....

Because we find that the district court erred in finding that the University had sufficient evidence of present effects of past discrimination to justify the program and in finding that the program is narrowly tailored to serve its stated objectives, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment to the University. We further reverse the district court's denial of Podberesky's motion for summary judgment, and we remand for entry of judgment in favor of Podberesky.<br />The facts and prior proceedings in this case are set forth at length in our earlier opinion, Podberesky v. Kirwan, 956 F.2d 52 (4th Cir.1992) (Podberesky I). In sum, Daniel Podberesky challenges the University of Maryland's Banneker scholarship program, which is a merit-based program for which only African-American students are eligible. The University maintains a separate merit-based scholarship program, the Francis Scott Key program, which is not restricted to African-American students. Podberesky is Hispanic; he was therefore ineligible for consideration under the Banneker Program, although he met the academic and all other requirements for consideration. Podberesky was ineligible for consideration under the Key program because his academic credentials fell just shy of its more rigorous standards. ....}}</ref>

Ossie Davis stars in this 60-minute TV drama. Davis plays Benjamin Banneker, the self-taught African-American astronomer, surveyor and almanac author. Banneker accomplished all this in the late 18th and early 19th century, a time when most blacks were held in the grip of slavery. The story details Banneker's first few "free" years as a farmer, his correspondence with Thomas Jefferson, and his efforts to help fugitive slaves escape. Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Loved the Stars was first telecast in February of 1989 over the CBN cable service.}}</ref>
