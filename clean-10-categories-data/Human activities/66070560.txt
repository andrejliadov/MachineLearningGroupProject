== History ==

Engum and Hazzard started to work together January 2021 at Great Falls Montana Tourism. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Engum thought of launching a podcast to reach potential leisure travelers while they were under limited travel orders. The podcast would talk all things Great Falls, Montana, and get listeners excited to visit when it was safe for them to travel.

In October 2020, Engum and Hazzard started to brainstorm ideas for their podcast, and settled on the name '''''We're No Dam Experts''''' but to include the fact "they knew some stuff' and were knowledgeable of Great Falls, Montana. In November 2020, they recorded their first four episodes of their podcast, creating a foundation that showcases the art and adventure that visitors to Great Falls, Montana can experience. Known as Basecamp <ref>{{cite web |title=Basecamp |url=https://visitgreatfallsmontana.org/basecamp/}}</ref> in Montana, Great Falls is halfway between Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park, which are both highlighted in on separate episodes of We're No Dam Experts <ref>{{cite web |url=https://visitgreatfallsmontana.org/podcast/episodes/ |title=All The Dam Episodes}}</ref>. Engum and Hazzard also dedicated an entire episode answering the #1 question they receive from in-market guests, "Where are the Falls?" <ref>{{cite web |url=https://visitgreatfallsmontana.org/podcast/episodes/episode-2-where-are-the-falls/ |title=Where Are The Falls?}}</ref> 

Their most successful episode to date was filmed at the #1 Bar in the World Worth Flying For, according to GQ Magazine <ref>{{cite web |url=https://ohairemotorinn.com/sip-n-dip/ |title=Sip 'n Dip Lounge}}</ref> The Sip 'n Dip Lounge, and has over 118 views on YouTube <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIXpcAd9HSU&t=374s |title=Episode 5: Mermaids. Yes, Virginia, we have Mermaids.}}</ref>. During the Episode, Engum and Hazzard have Sandra Johnson-Thares, owner of The Sip 'n Dip Lounge, on as their first expert and guest. 

== Format ==
Engum and Hazzard start each episode by introducing The Greatest Dam Town in Montana, Great Falls. They focus on one topic that is related to art and adventure in Great Falls, Montana and the episodes are primarily dialogue. Initially, the audio for the podcast was minimally edited, but quality drastically improved on episode four. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://visitgreatfallsmontana.org/podcast/episodes/episode-4-the-first-national-park-and-the-science-park-yellowstone-national-park/ |title=Episode 4: The First National Park and The Science Park, Yellowstone National Park}}</ref> Titles are puns, jokes, or pop culture based. Engum repeatedly states that Hazzard does not have a face for TV or a voice for radio. 

Full episodes are released weekly on Thursdays or Fridays, ranging in length from 20-50 minutes.
