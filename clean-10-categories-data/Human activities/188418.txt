'''Overconsumption''' is a situation where [[resource consumption|resource use]] has outpaced the [[sustainable]] [[carrying capacity|capacity]] of the [[ecosystem]]. A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to [[environmental degradation]] and the eventual [[resource depletion|loss of resource]] bases.

Generally, the discussion of overconsumption parallels that of [[human overpopulation]];<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul R |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089–E6096|doi=10.1073/pnas.1704949114|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich.

However, humanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors besides the raw number of people. Their lifestyle (including overall affluence and resource utilization) and the pollution they generate (including [[carbon footprint]]) are equally important. Currently, the inhabitants of the [[developed nation]]s of the world consume resources at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population (7.4 billion people).<ref name="NYTimes_Diamond">Diamond, Jared: (2008-01-02). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02diamond.html "What's Your Consumption Factor?"] ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>

However, the developing world is a growing market for consumption. These nations are quickly gaining more purchasing power and it is expected that the Global South, which includes cities in Asia, America and Africa, will account for 56% of consumption growth by 2030.<ref>Richard Dobbs, James Manyika, Jonathan Woetzel, Jaana Remes, Jesko Perrey, Greg Kelly, Kanaka Pattabiraman, and Hemant Sharma.

The theory of overpopulation reflects issues of [[Carrying capacity#Humans|carrying capacity]] without taking into account per capita consumption, by which developing nations are evaluated to consume more than their land can support. The United Nations estimate that world population will reach 9.8 billion in the year 2050 and 11.2 in 2100.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/|title=World Population Prospects - Population Division - United Nations|website=population.un.org|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref> This growth will be highly concentrated in the developing nations which also poses issues with inequality of consumption.

There is a spectrum of goods and services that the world population constantly consume. These range from food and beverage, clothing and footwear, housing, energy, technology,  transportation, education, health and personal care, financial services and other utilities.<ref name="worldbank.org">The World Bank Group - www.worldbank.org. (n.d.). The developing world’s 4.5 billion low-income people already a $5 trillion market. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/market</ref> Each of these require a different resource and once that resource is exploited to a certain point, that qualifies as overconsumption. Since the developing nations are rising quickly into the consumer class, it is important to note the trends happening in these nations. According to the World Bank, the highest shares of consumption lie in food, beverage, clothing, and footwear. This applies regardless of the sector of income.<ref name="worldbank.org" />

Two main factors of why people buy so much and so often are due to [[Planned obsolescence|planned and perceived obsolescence]].<ref name="youtube.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM|title=The Story of Stuff|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> This factor of production was introduced first in the United States and it revolves around the design of products. With these methods, the products are intentionally designed to be discarded after a short amount of time. As of 2012, only 1% of goods purchased were still in use after 6 months.
When it is planned, designers create products that will not be able to work after a certain amount of time but they work for enough time to ensure the customers will come back to buy again. Perceived obsolescence comes in a lot with fashion and trends and fueled by advertising and [[media consumption]]. Through this technique, consumers are convinced that certain products do not have value anymore because it is out of style, and to have value, consumers must buy more up to date styles. As of 2015, the top five consumer markets in the world included the United States, Japan, Germany, China and France.<ref>The 25 Largest Consumer's Markets ... And The Outlook For 2015. (n.d.).

[[File:Waste generation per day per capita, September 2018.jpg|thumb|[[Waste]] generation, measured in kilograms per person per day]]
A fundamental effect of overconsumption is a reduction in the planet's [[carrying capacity]]. Excessive unsustainable consumption will exceed the long term carrying capacity of its environment ([[Overshoot (ecology)|ecological overshoot]]) and subsequent resource depletion, [[environmental degradation]] and reduced [[ecosystem health]]. In 2020 multinational team of scientists published a study, saying that overconsumption is the biggest threat to sustainability. According to the study a drastic change in lifestyle is necessary for solving the ecological crisis. According to one of the authors Julia Steinberger: “To protect ourselves from the worsening climate crisis, we must reduce inequality and challenge the notion that riches, and those who possess them, are inherently good.” The research was published on the site of the [[World Economic Forum]]. The leader of the forum professor [[Klaus Schwab]], calls to a "great reset of capitalism".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fleming |first1=Sean |title=This is now the world's greatest threat – and it's not coronavirus |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/affluence-bigger-threat-than-coronavirus-scientists-capitalism/ |website=World Economic Forum |publisher=World Economic forum |access-date=5 August 2020}}</ref>

According to a study published in [[Nature Scientific Reports]] if the consumption of forests will continue in current rate in the next 20 - 40 years, it can trigger a full or almost full extinction of humanity. To avoid it humanity should pass from a civilization dominated by the economy to "cultural society" that "privileges the interest of the ecosystem above the individual interest of its components, but eventually in accordance with the overall communal interest"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nafeez |first1=Ahmed |title=Theoretical Physicists Say 90% Chance of Societal Collapse Within Several Decades |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/akzn5a/theoretical-physicists-say-90-chance-of-societal-collapse-within-several-decades |website=Vice |access-date=9 August 2020}}</ref>

Looking at the two largest sectors of over consumption, the fashion and food industries, we can see most of the harmful effects on the Earth starting here. The fashion industry has created a new venue, fast fashion, which in 2013 produced 15.1 million tons of textile waste and of that, 12.8 million tons were thrown out.  The United States, being the largest consumer market, deals with excess clothing by exporting it to poorer, developing nations but this solution is not sustainable because the demand will go down as cheap clothing becomes more readily available. Another way of disposal is to throw out into landfills or burn up in incinerators which is the least sustainable disposal solution.<ref>Tan, Z. Y. (2016, April 10). What Happens When Fashion Becomes Fast, Disposable And Cheap? Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.npr.org/2016/04/08/473513620/what-happens-when-fashion-becomes-fast-disposable-and-cheap
</ref>

The food industry is the other largest sector of consumption and studies show that people waste a fifth of food products just through disposal or overconsumption. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization collected data and found that by the time food reaches the consumer, 9% (160 million tons) goes uneaten and 10% is lost to overconsumption - meaning consumers ate more than the calorie intake requirement. Other aspects of losses surrounding dry matter came at each stage in the food system, the highest amount being from livestock production at 43.9%, transportation accounted for 18% and consumer waste accounting for 12.2% loss. When the consumer takes in too much, this not only explains losses at the beginning of the stage at production (and [[overproduction]]) but also lends itself to overconsumption of energy and protein, having harmful effects on the body.<ref>Beer, E. (2017, February 27). Consumer waste and livestock biggest inefficiencies in food production: Study.

The idea of overconsumption is also strongly tied to the idea of an ecological footprint.  The term "ecological footprint" refers to the "resource accounting framework for measuring human demand on the biosphere."  Currently, China is roughly 11 times lower in per capita footprint, yet has a population that is more than four times the size of the USA.  It is estimated that if China developed to the level of the United States that world consumption rates would roughly double.<ref name="NYTimes_Diamond" />  According to Scientific American, one person from China uses 53 times fewer resources than the average American.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/american-consumption-habits/|title=American Consumption}}</ref>

[[Globalization]] and modernization has brought Western consumer cultures to countries like China and India, including meat-intensive diets which are supplanting traditional plant-based diets. More than 200 billion animals are consumed by a global population of over 7 billion annually.<ref>{{cite book |last= Best|first=Steven|date=2014 |title=The Politics of Total Liberation: Revolution for the 21st Century|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|page=97 |isbn=978-1137471116|author-link=Steven Best}}</ref> A 2018 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' postulates that meat consumption is set to increase as the result of [[human population growth]] and rising affluence, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce [[biodiversity]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Devlin|first=Hannah |date=July 19, 2018 |title=Rising global meat consumption 'will devastate environment'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/19/rising-global-meat-consumption-will-devastate-environment|work=The Guardian |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}</ref> Meat consumption needs to be reduced by up to 90% according to a 2018 study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Willett|first1=Walter|last2=Rockström|first2=Johan|last3=Tilman|first3=David|last4=Godfray|first4=H.

The most obvious solution to the issue of overconsumption is to simply slow the rate at which materials are becoming [[Resource depletion|depleted]]. From capitalistic point of view, less consumption has negative effects on economies and so instead, countries must look to curb consumption rates but also allow for new industries, such as [[renewable energy]] and [[recycling]] technologies, to flourish and deflect some of the economic burdens. There are movements who think that reduction in consumption in some cases can benefit economy and society. They think that a fundamental shift in the global economy may be necessary to account for the current change that is taking place or that will need to take place. Movements and lifestyle choices related to stopping overconsumption include: [[anti-consumerism]], [[freeganism]], [[green economics]], [[ecological economics]], [[degrowth]], [[frugality]], [[Downshifting (lifestyle)|downshifting]], [[simple living]], [[The Minimalists|minimalism]], and thrifting.

Many consider the final target of the movements as arriving to a [[steady-state economy]] in which the rate of consumption is optimal for health and environment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kerschner |first1=Christian |title=Economic de-growth vs. steady-state economy |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |date=10 November 2009 |volume=18 |issue=2010 |url=https://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Kerschner-2010.pdf |access-date=6 September 2019}}</ref>

Recent grassroots movements have been coming up with creative ways to decrease the number of goods we consume. [[The Freecycle Network]] is a network of people in one's community that are willing to trade goods for other goods or services. It is a new take on thrifting while still being beneficial to both parties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freecycle.org/|title=The Freecycle Network|website=www.freecycle.org|access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref>

Other researchers and movements such as [[the Zeitgeist Movement]] suggest a new socioeconomic model which, through a structural increase of [[efficiency]], collaboration and locality in production as well as effective [[sharing economy|sharing]], increased [[modularity]], sustainability and optimal design of products, are expected to reduce resource-consumption.<ref>[http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq The Zeitgeist Movement - Frequently Asked Questions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815095626/http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq |date=2012-08-15 }} Retrieved on 6 May 2014</ref>
Solutions offered include consumers using market forces to influence businesses towards more sustainable manufacturing and products.<ref>Derraik, J. (2002). The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: a review. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 22(9), pp. 842-852. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0025-326X(02)00220-5</ref>

Other ways to reduce consumption is to slow population growth by improving family planning services worldwide. In developing countries, more than 200 million women do not have adequate access.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2017/08/benefits-investing-international-family-planning-and-price-slashing-funding|title=The Benefits of Investing in International Family Planning—and the Price of Slashing Funding|date=2017-07-20|website=Guttmacher Institute|access-date=2019-01-23}}</ref> Women's empowerment in these countries will also result in smaller families.
