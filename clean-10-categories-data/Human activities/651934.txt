'''Anti-incumbency''' is sentiment in favor of voting out [[incumbent politician]]s. It is sometimes referred to as a "throw the bums out" sentiment. Periods of anti-incumbent sentiment are typically characterized by [[wave election]]s.<ref name=stanford/> This sentiment can also lead to support for [[term limit]]s.

In a [[two-party system]], anti-incumbent voters have only one party to vote for, when voting against the incumbent; in a [[multi-party system]], [[public mood]], i.e., the tendency of opinions held by voters over a set of related policy issues, can determine which parties receive the anti-incumbent vote.<ref>https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/baker/sites/default/files/attached-files/mexico_2012_paper_baker_website.pdf</ref>

==Causes==
When voters perceive times as bad, this can cause anti-incumbent sentiment. However, this is subject to biases. Perceptions of whether, e.g., economic conditions have worsened during a politician's term are influenced by [[partisan bias]], for instance.<ref>http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/sites/default/files/articles/WQ_VOL32_A_2008_Article_05_1.pdf</ref> In the U.S., reliance on partisan media, as opposed to mainstream media, is associated with anti-incumbent attitudes toward Congress.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Lee |first2=Angela M. |title=Kick the bums out?: A structural equation model exploring the degree to which mainstream and partisan sources influence polarization and anti-incumbent attitudes |journal=Electoral Studies |date=December 2015 |volume=40 |pages=210–220 |doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2015.08.008 }}</ref> New democracies' elections, such as those in Central and Eastern Europe, and in Latin America and Asia, often are characterized by anti-incumbency.<ref name=ecpr>{{cite journal |last1=Bochsler |first1=Daniel |last2=Hänni |first2=Miriam |title=The three stages of the anti-incumbency vote: Retrospective economic voting in young and established democracies |journal=European Journal of Political Research |date=February 2019 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=30–55 |doi=10.1111/1475-6765.12269 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

===India===
India has the highest rate of anti-incumbency in the world,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/anti-incumbency-in-our-dna-1452422-2019-02-10 |title = Anti-incumbency in our DNA}}</ref> with incumbents from the ruling party having only a fifty-fifty shot at returning to parliament.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/08/13/incumbency-in-india-more-curse-than-blessing-pub-77010 |title = Incumbency in India: More Curse Than Blessing?}}</ref> For example, since 1985, the electorate in [[Assam, India]] has oscillated between voting the [[Asom Gana Parishad]] and the [[Indian National Congress]] to power.<ref>Counting on Anti-Incumbency Economic and Political Weekly, 24 March 2001, Vol.36(12), pp.981-981</ref> In [[Karnataka]], the last time the ruling government was re-elected was in the 1985 Indian elections.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thelogicalindian.com/tli-explains/anti-incumbency/ |title = TLI Explains: What is Anti-Incumbency & How Does It Affect the Fate of Parties|date = 2019-03-13}}</ref> [[Kerala]] has always voted in whichever is the opposition pre-poll alliance since 1[[1982 Kerala Legislative Assembly election|982 assembly elections]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-02-24|title=The quiet decline of anti-incumbency|url=https://www.gatewayhouse.in/the-quiet-decline-of-anti-incumbency/|access-date=2020-08-30|website=Gateway House|language=en}}</ref> [[Voter turnout]] does not appear correlated with incumbents' electoral performance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vaishnav |first1=Milan |last2=Guy |first2=Johnathan |title=Does Higher Turnout Hurt Incumbents?

In 2018, India's period of anti-incumbency was accompanied by acute rural distress, multiple farmer agitations and serious joblessness.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.dailyo.in/politics/anti-incumbency-politics-madhya-pradesh-chhattisgarh-democracy-assembly-polls-2018/story/1/28468.html | title=Why the government should worry about the warning signs of anti-incumbency}}</ref>

===Mexico===
In the [[2010 Mexican gubernatorial elections]], incumbents from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]], and [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] were rejected.<ref>An Anti-Incumbency Wave -- in Mexico. Krauze, Enrique The New York Times, July 7, 2010, p.A21(L)</ref>

===United States===
Eras of anti-incumbent sentiment included the [[Gilded Age]], in which the majority party in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] shifted six times in the 15 Congressional elections between 1870 and 1900, with three of those shifts involving losses of more than 70 seats by the majority party. David M. Kennedy notes, "Generations of American scholars have struggled to find a coherent narrative or to identify heroic leaders in that era's messy and inconclusive political scene."<ref name=stanford>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=David M. |title=Throwing the Bums Out for 140 Years |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/opinion/07kennedy.html |work=The New York Times |date=6 November 2010 }}</ref>

The [[1992 United States elections]] were also characterized by anti-incumbent sentiment, as a stubborn recession and persistently high unemployment fuelled voter dissatisfaction.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Myers |first1=Dee Dee |title=New Technology and the 1992 Clinton Presidential Campaign |journal=American Behavioral Scientist |date=27 July 2016 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=181–184 |doi=10.1177/0002764293037002003 }}</ref> A 2013 poll found that 60% of Americans would vote to "defeat and replace every single member of Congress, including [their] own representative" if that option were available.<ref>https://www.american.edu/cas/literature/wsp/upload/2016-atrium.pdf</ref>

The concept of anti-incumbency, at least with regard to U.S. elections, is controversial, since more often voters will punish only one party.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.politico.com/story/2011/10/the-anti-incumbent-election-is-a-myth-065550 |title = The anti-incumbent election is a myth}}</ref> Three organizations that supported voting out incumbents were Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out, Vote Out Incumbents Democracy and Tenure Corrupts.

==Criticism==
A perceived disadvantage of anti-incumbency, with regard to judicial elections, is that good lawyers will not want to accept what they regard as a revolving-door judgeship.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Anti-incumbency's threat to judicial selection |journal=Judicature |date=1992 |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=56 }}</ref> Another criticism of anti-incumbency is that it causes political parties to focus on single-term policies rather than long-term development.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gatewayhouse.in/the-quiet-decline-of-anti-incumbency/ |title = The quiet decline of anti-incumbency|date = 2015-02-24}}</ref>
