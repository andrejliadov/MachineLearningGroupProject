This article presents a [[chronology]] of sporting development and events from time immemorial until the end of the 10th century CE. The major sporting event of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman periods]] was the original [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], which were held every four years at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] for over a thousand years. [[Gladiator]]ial contests and [[chariot racing]] were massively popular. Some modern sports such as [[archery]], [[Sport of athletics|athletics]], [[boxing]], [[football]], [[horse racing]] and [[wrestling]] can directly trace their origins back to this period while later sports like [[cricket]] and [[golf]] trace their evolution from basic activities such as hitting a stone with a stick.

==Ball and stick games==
There are many modern games which call upon the basic action of hitting a ball with some kind of club or stick. These include [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[croquet]], [[golf]], all forms of [[hockey]], [[rounders]] and all forms of [[tennis]]. It can be argued that these sports share a common origin which dates back to time immemorial and, as such, can never be found.<ref>{{cite book |last=Major |first=John |author-link=John Major |title=More Than A Game |page=17 |year=2007 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=978-0-00-718364-7}}</ref>
