==Origins and oversight==
The Aid for Trade initiative was launched at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005]] in December 2005,<ref>{{Cite web|title=WTO {{!}} Ministerial conferences - Hong Kong 6th Ministerial|url=https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min05_e/min05_e.htm|access-date=2020-09-21|website=www.wto.org}}</ref><ref name="oecd">{{cite web |title=Aid for Trade |url=http://www.oecd.org/aidfortrade/ |website=OECD.org |accessdate=22 September 2020}}</ref> and in 2007, the WTO started implementation of its February 2006 recommendations of the Aid for Trade Task Force as it moved into its first stage.

The purpose of the Global Review is to provide strong monitoring and evaluation for the Aid for Trade agenda. Global Review events have been held under the themes of “Maintaining Momentum”, “Showing Results”, and “Connecting to Value Chains” in 2009, 2011 and 2013 respectively.
