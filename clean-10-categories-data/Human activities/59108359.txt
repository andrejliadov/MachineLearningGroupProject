[[Alcoholic drinks]] are generally disallowed in [[spaceflight]], but space agencies have previously allowed its consumption.<ref name=BI/> [[NASA]] has been stricter about alcohol consumption than the [[Roscosmos]], both according to regulations and in practice. Astronauts and cosmonauts are restricted from being intoxicated at launch. Despite restrictions on consumption, there have been experiments in making and keeping alcoholic drinks in space.

==Drinking in space==
The effects of alcohol on human physiology in microgravity have not been researched, though because medications can differ in their effects NASA expects that the effects of alcohol will also differ.<ref name=ns/> Beer and other carbonated drinks are not suitable for spaceflight as the bubbles cause 'wet burps'; also, a foamy head cannot form as the bubbles do not rise.<ref name=ns>{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12388-beer-in-space-a-short-but-frothy-history/|title=Beer in space: A short but frothy history|date=July 31, 2007|first=Anna|last=Davison|work=New Scientist}}</ref>

On July 20, 1969, [[Apollo 11]] astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] drank some wine when he [[Eucharist|took communion]] while on the Moon in the [[Lunar Module Eagle|Lunar Module ''Eagle'']]. The ceremony was not broadcast following earlier protests against religious activity that were perceived to breach the separation between church and state.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/sep/13/buzz-aldrin-communion-moon|title=How Buzz Aldrin's communion on the moon was hushed up|first=Matthew|last=Cresswell|date=September 13, 2012|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

In the 1970s, NASA's Charles Bourland planned to send sherry with the astronauts visiting [[Skylab]], but the idea was scrapped because the smell was found to induce a gag reflex in zero-gravity flight tests, there was ambivalence among the astronauts, and angry letters were received after plans were discussed in public by [[Gerald Carr (astronaut)|Gerry Carr]].<ref name=BI>{{cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/alcohol-that-has-flown-in-space-2016-1|title=A surprising amount of booze has flown into space|first=Kelly|last=Dickerson|work=Business Insider|date=February 2, 2016}}</ref><ref name=alphr/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/why-astronauts-were-banned-from-drinking-wine-in-outer-1513304233/|title=Why Astronauts Were Banned From Drinking Wine In Outer Space|last=Twilley|first=Nicola|work=Gizmodo|date=January 31, 2014}}</ref> Alcohol is prohibited aboard the [[International Space Station]] due to the impact it can have on the [[ISS ECLSS|Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)]].<ref name="Lufkin 2017">{{cite web |last1=Lufkin |first1=Bryan |title=Why astronauts are banned from getting drunk in space |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170217-why-astronauts-are-banned-from-getting-drunk-in-space |website=BBC Online |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

A 1985 NASA report on extended spaceflight predicted that alcohol would be missed, but would only become common in stable settlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19850024459.pdf|title=Living Aloft: Human Requirements for Extended Spaceflight|last1=Connors|first1=Mary M.|last2=Harrison|first2=Albert A.|last3=Akins|first3=Faren R.|date=1985|work=Ames Research Center|publisher=NASA|quote=It is unlikely that alcohol as a social beverage will find its way into space, at least until relatively large and stable settlements are established. Alcohol, as a recreational drug, may be keenly missed by space travelers, since there is evidence that alcohol plays an important social role in exotic environments (p.8) ... With this level of cultural acceptance, alcohol could find its way into space when resupply arrangements are in place and when storage capacity is plentiful ... It is reasonable to assume that substitute methods of gratification will be sought, perhaps including the use of alcohol or other diverting drugs. Alternately, the self-censuring which restricts competitive interaction in confinement may also preclude the use of drugs (p. 246) ... If alcohol or drugs were to be available in space, problems associated with grief responses could be aggravated (p. 261)}}</ref>

=== Russia ===
The Russian state media ''[[Russia Beyond]]'' says drinking has been officially banned, but the first alcoholic drink sent into space by cosmonauts was a bottle of cognac, to the [[Salyut 7]] in 1984.<ref name=RBTH>{{cite news|url=https://www.rbth.com/science_and_tech/2017/04/12/space-smugglers-how-russian-cosmonauts-sneak-booze-into-outer-space_740566|title=Space smugglers: How Russian cosmonauts sneak booze into outer space|date=April 12, 2017|work=RBTH| first=Yevgeny|last=Levkovich}}</ref> Cosmonaut [[Igor Volk]] said they would lose weight and hide alcohol in their spacesuits or hide bottles inside book covers, and [[Georgy Grechko]] discussed the difficulties of drinking in space as the liquid and air would mix to form froth.<ref name=RBTH/>

Cosmonauts aboard ''[[Mir]]'' were allowed alcoholic drinks including cognac, vodka, and "ginseng liquer", supposedly for health reasons, according to comments made by former cosmonaut [[Alexander Lazutkin]] to the Interfax news agency in 2010.<ref name="Lufkin 2017" /><ref name=BI/> Cosmonaut [[Alexander Poleshchuk]] said bottles of cognac would be hidden behind panels on ''Mir''.<ref name=telegraph/> American astronauts on ''Mir'' watched while their Russian colleagues drank; NASA tried to block the release of photographs of a 1997 "cognac party" onboard ''Mir'', but [[James Oberg]] of NBC News obtained them via a freedom of information request.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/alcohol-space-da-6C10403671|title=Alcohol in space?

In 2006, the ban on cosmonauts drinking on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) was proposed to be lifted, though champagne was still regarded as too dangerous.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1507896/Russia-lets-cosmonauts-drink-but-they-musnt-go-into-orbit.html|title=Russia lets cosmonauts drink - but they musn't go into orbit|first=Simon|last=Saradzhyan|work=The Telegraph|date=January 15, 2006}}</ref> Crew care packages cannot contain any alcohol, even in aftershave or mouthwash.<ref name=alphr/>

==Pre-flight==
In July 2007, following [[Lisa_Nowak#Reactions|a scandal in which astronauts were alleged to have flown while drunk]], NASA admitted that its rules around alcohol were vague and introduced a new rule prohibiting astronauts from being 'under the influence' and consuming alcohol within 12 hours of launch, based on the rules for [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38 training jets]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/29/weekinreview/29basicB.html|title=The Astronaut’s Drinking Rules|first=John|last=Schwartz|date=July 29, 2007|work=New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/188111main_Astronaut_Alcohol_Use_Report_final.pdf|title=Space Flight Safety Review (Alcohol Use In The Preflight Period)|work=NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance|first=Bryan|last=O’Connor|publisher=NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC|date=August 28, 2007}}</ref>

A 3D-printed plastic whisky glass was designed for spaceflight in 2015, and whisky was sent to the ISS for four years to study the effect on its flavor.<ref name=alphr>{{cite news|url=https://www.alphr.com/space/1001502/alcohol-in-space-from-communion-wine-to-zero-gravity-whisky|title=Alcohol in space: From communion wine to zero-gravity whisky|last=Martin|first=Alan|date=September 9, 2015|work=Alphr}}</ref> One beer company sponsored a graduate student's research into brewing beer in space,<ref name=ns/> and in 2017 another planned to sponsor research on the ISS with the aim of serving beer on Mars.<ref name=make>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/whats-point-going-space-dont-make-booze/|title=What's the point of going to space if you don't make booze?|last=Stockton|first=Nick|work=Wired|date=March 22, 2017}}</ref>

Making alcohol in space would be difficult, for example conventional distillation would be impossible in zero gravity and the volumes of liquid required are high.<ref name=make/>
