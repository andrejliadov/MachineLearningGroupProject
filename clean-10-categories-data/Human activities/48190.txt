A '''commodity market''' is a [[Market (economics)|market]] that trades in the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary economic sector]] rather than manufactured products, such as [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], fruit and [[sugar]]. Hard commodities are mined, such as [[gold]] and [[Crude oil|oil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/softcommodity.asp#axzz2EGf9ZeC2 |title=Soft Commodity Definition |publisher=Investopedia |date=15 February 2009 |access-date=6 December 2012}}</ref> [[Futures contract]]s are the oldest way of investing in commodities.

Derivatives such as futures contracts, [[Swap (finance)|Swaps]] (1970s-), Exchange-traded Commodities (ETC) (2003-), forward contracts have become the primary trading instruments in commodity markets. Futures are traded on regulated [[commodities exchange]]s. Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are "privately negotiated bilateral contracts entered into between the contracting parties directly".<ref name=DerivativesCanada>

[[Exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) began to feature commodities in 2003. Gold ETFs are based on "electronic gold" that does not entail the ownership of physical bullion, with its added costs of insurance and storage in repositories such as the [[London bullion market]]. According to the [[World Gold Council]], ETFs allow investors to be exposed to the gold market without the risk of price [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] associated with gold as a physical commodity.<ref name=GoldMutualVSETF>

== History ==
Commodity-based money and commodity markets in a crude early form are believed to have originated in [[Sumer]] between 4500 BC and 4000 BC. Sumerians first used [[clay]] tokens sealed in a clay vessel, then [[Sumer#Mathematics|clay writing tablets]] to represent the amount—for example, the number of goats, to be delivered.<ref name=forbesindia16jan2013>

Beginning in the late 10th century, commodity markets grew as a mechanism for allocating goods, labor, land and capital across Europe. Between the late 11th and the late 13th century, English urbanization, regional specialization, expanded and improved infrastructure, the increased use of coinage and the proliferation of markets and fairs were evidence of commercialization.<ref name=comarhistoryHolland2010>{{cite web

The [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]], often cited as the first stock exchange, originated as a market for the exchange of commodities. Early trading on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange often involved the use of very sophisticated contracts, including short sales, forward contracts, and options. "Trading took place at the Amsterdam Bourse, an open aired
venue, which was created as a commodity exchange in 1530 and rebuilt in 1608. Commodity exchanges themselves were a relatively recent invention, existing in only a handful of cities."<ref name=Stringham>{{cite journal|last1=Stringham|first1=Edward|title=The Extralegal Development of Securities Trading in Seventeenth Century Amsterdam|journal=Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance|date=2003|volume=43|issue=2|page=321|ssrn=1676251|doi=10.1016/S1062-9769(02)00153-9|s2cid=153987773}}</ref>

In 1864, in the United States, wheat, corn, cattle, and pigs were widely traded using standard instruments on the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (CBOT), the world's oldest futures and options exchange. Other food commodities were added to the [[Commodity Exchange Act]] and traded through CBOT in the 1930s and 1940s, expanding the list from grains to include rice, mill feeds, butter, eggs, Irish potatoes and soybeans.<ref>

==Commodity price index==
In 1934, the US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] began the computation of a daily [[Commodity price index]] that became available to the public in 1940. By 1952, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a [[Spot Market Price Index]] that measured the price movements of "22 sensitive basic commodities whose markets are presumed to be among the first to be influenced by changes in economic conditions. As such, it serves as one early indication of impending changes in business activity."<ref name=CRBspotindex2006>{{cite encyclopedia

==Commodity index fund==
A [[commodity index fund]] is a fund whose assets are invested in financial instruments based on or linked to a commodity index. In just about every case the index is in fact a Commodity Futures Index. The first such index was the Dow Jones Commodity Index, which began in 1933.<ref>{{cite document |title=The First Commodity Futures Index of 1933 |ssrn=3451443 }}</ref>  The first practically investable commodity futures index was the [[Goldman Sachs Commodity Index]], created in 1991,<ref name="bub">"The Food Bubble", Frederick Kaufman, Harper's, 2010 July</ref> and known as the "GSCI". The next was the Dow Jones AIG Commodity Index. It differed from the GSCI primarily in the weights allocated to each commodity. The DJ AIG had mechanisms to periodically limit the weight of any one commodity and to remove commodities whose weights became too small. After [[AIG]]'s financial problems in 2008 the Index rights were sold to [[UBS]] and it is now known as the DJUBS index. Other commodity indices include the Reuters / CRB index (which is the old CRB Index as re-structured in 2005) and the Rogers Index.

==Cash commodity==
Cash commodities or "actuals" refer to the physical goods—e.g., wheat, corn, soybeans, crude oil, gold, silver—that someone is buying/selling/trading as distinguished from derivatives.<ref name=NFA2006 />

==Call options ==
In a [[call option]] [[counterparty|counterparties]] enter into a financial contract option where the buyer purchases the right but not the obligation to buy an agreed quantity of a particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying) from the seller of the option at a certain time (the expiration date) for a certain price (the [[strike price]]). The seller (or "writer") is obligated to sell the commodity or financial instrument should the buyer so decide. The buyer pays a fee (called a premium) for this right.<ref>{{cite book

In 1992 the  [[Financial Information eXchange]] (FIX) protocol was introduced, allowing international real-time exchange of information regarding market transactions.

===Contracts in the commodity market===
A [[Spot contract]] is an agreement where delivery and payment either takes place immediately, or with a short lag. Physical trading normally involves a visual inspection and is carried out in physical [[Market (place)|market]]s such as a [[Farmers' market|farmers market]]. [[Derivatives market]]s, on the other hand, require the existence of agreed standards so that trades can be made without visual inspection.

===Standardization===
US [[soybean]] futures, for something else, are of not being standard grade if they are "GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non-GMO No. 2 yellow soybeans of Indiana, Ohio and Michigan origin produced in the U.S.A. (Non-screened, stored in silo)". They are of "deliverable grade" if they are "GMO or a mixture of GMO and Non-GMO No. 2 yellow soybeans of Iowa, Illinois and Wisconsin origin produced in the U.S.A. (Non-screened, stored in silo)".  Note the distinction between states, and the need to clearly mention their status as GMO ([[genetically modified organism]]) which makes them unacceptable to most [[organic farming|organic]] food buyers.

Similar specifications apply for cotton, orange juice, cocoa, sugar, wheat, corn, barley, [[pork belly|pork bellies]], milk, feed stuffs, fruits, vegetables, other grains, other beans, hay, other livestock, meats, poultry, eggs, or any other commodity which is so traded.

Standardization has also occurred technologically, as the use of the FIX Protocol by commodities exchanges has allowed trade messages to be sent, received and processed in the same format as stocks or equities. This process began in 2001 when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange launched a FIX-compliant interface that was adopted by commodity exchanges around the world.<ref name="FIXGlobal2011"/>

==Derivatives==
[[Derivative (finance)|Derivatives]] evolved from simple commodity future contracts into a diverse group of financial instruments that apply to every kind of asset, including mortgages, insurance and many more. Futures contracts, [[Swap (finance)|Swaps]] (1970s-), Exchange-traded Commodities (ETC) (2003-), forward contracts, etc. are examples. They can be traded through formal exchanges or through Over-the-counter (OTC). Commodity market derivatives unlike credit default derivatives, for example, are secured by the physical assets or commodities.<ref name=washingtonpost21apr2010 />

===Forward contracts===
A [[forward contract]] is an agreement between two parties to exchange at a fixed future date a given quantity of a commodity for a specific price defined when the contract is finalized. The fixed price is also called [[forward price]]. Such forward contracts began as a way of reducing pricing risk in food and agricultural product markets. By agreeing in advance on a price for a future delivery, farmers were able protect their output against a possible fall of market prices and in contrast buyers were able to protect themselves against's a possible rise of market prices.

Forward contracts, for example, were used for rice in seventeenth century Japan.

===Futures contract===
[[Futures contract|Futures]] contracts are standardized forward contracts that are transacted through an exchange. In futures contracts the buyer and the seller stipulate product, grade, quantity and location and leaving price as the only variable.<ref>Garner, Carley. ''A Trader's First Book on Commodities''. (New Jersey: FT Press, 2010): pg 19.</ref>

Agricultural futures contracts are the oldest, in use in the United States for more than 170 years.<ref>[[Futures Trading Act of 1921]], Declared unconstitutional in [[Hill v. Wallace]] 259 U.S. 44 (1922), the [[Grain Futures Act]] of 1922 and ''[[Board of Trade of City of Chicago v.

===Swaps===
A [[Swap (finance)|swap]] is a derivative in which counterparties exchange the cash flows of one party's financial instrument for those of the other party's financial instrument. They were introduced in the 1970s.<ref name=GlobalFinance2003>{{cite book

===Exchange-traded commodities (ETCs)===
{{main|Exchange-traded product}}
Exchange-traded commodity is a term used for commodity [[exchange-traded fund]]s (which are funds) or commodity [[exchange-traded note]]s (which are notes). These track the performance of an underlying commodity index including total return indices based on a single commodity. They are similar to ETFs and traded and settled exactly like stock funds. ETCs have [[market maker]] support with guaranteed liquidity, enabling investors to easily invest in commodities.

They were introduced in 2003.

At first, only professional institutional investors had access, but online exchanges opened some ETC markets to almost anyone. ETCs were introduced partly in response to the tight supply of commodities in 2000, combined with record low inventories and increasing demand from emerging markets such as China and India.<ref name=ETC>{{cite journal

Gold was the first commodity to be securitised through an [[Exchange-traded fund|Exchange Traded Fund]] (ETF) in the early 1990s, but it was not available for trade until 2003.<ref name=ETC /> The idea of a Gold ETF was first officially conceptualised by [[Benchmark Asset Management Company Private Ltd]] in India, when they filed a proposal with the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] in May 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etfglobalinvestor.net/gold-etf.php |title=Benchmark Asset Management Company conceptualises Gold ETF |publisher=Etfglobalinvestor.net |access-date=3 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009035807/http://www.etfglobalinvestor.net/gold-etf.php |archive-date=9 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first gold exchange-traded fund was [[Gold Bullion Securities]] launched on the ASX in 2003, and the first [[silver exchange-traded fund]] was iShares Silver Trust launched on the NYSE in 2006. As of November 2010 a commodity ETF, namely [[SPDR Gold Shares]], was the second-largest ETF by market capitalization.<ref name="etfdb1">{{cite web|url=http://etfdb.com/compare/market-cap/|title=Largest ETFs: Top 25 ETFs By Market Cap|publisher=ETFdb|access-date=3 November 2010}}</ref>

Generally, commodity ETFs are index funds tracking non-security [[index (economics)|indices]]. Because they do not invest in securities, commodity ETFs are not regulated as investment companies under the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]] in the United States, although their public offering is subject to SEC review and they need an SEC [[no-action letter]] under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]]. They may, however, be subject to regulation by the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]].<ref>Michael Sackheim, Michael Schmidtberger & James Munsell, DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund: An Innovative Exchange-Traded Fund, ''Futures Industry'' (May/June 2006).</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Koyfman |first=Yevgeniy |url=http://www.indexuniverse.com/sections/newsinfocus/6362-nogaz.html |title=No Gas: Barclays Halts Issuance of Natural Gas ETN |publisher=Index universe.com |date=21 August 2009 |access-date=3 October 2011}}</ref>

The earliest commodity ETFs, such as [[SPDR Gold Shares]] {{NYSE Arca|GLD}} and [[iShares]] Silver Trust {{NYSE Arca|SLV}}, actually owned the physical commodity (e.g., gold and silver bars). Similar to these are {{NYSE Arca|PALL}} (palladium) and {{NYSE Arca|PPLT}} (platinum). However, most ETCs implement a [[futures trading]] strategy, which may produce quite different results from owning the commodity.

Commodity ETFs trade provide exposure to an increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, [[Soft commodity|softs]] and agriculture. Many commodity funds, such as oil roll so-called front-month futures contracts from month to month. This provides exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the ''term structure'', such as a high cost to roll.<ref name=GoldMutualVSETF /><ref name=commodityETF />

ETCs in China and India gained in importance due to those countries' emergence as commodities consumers and producers. China accounted for more than 60% of exchange-traded commodities in 2009, up from 40% the previous year. The global volume of ETCs increased by a 20% in 2010, and 50% since 2008, to around 2.5 billion million contracts.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

=== Over-the-counter (OTC) commodities derivatives ===
[[Over-the-counter (finance)|Over-the-counter]] (OTC) commodities derivatives trading originally involved two parties, without an [[exchange (organized market)|exchange]].  Exchange trading offers greater transparency and regulatory protections. In an OTC trade, the price is not generally made public. OTC commodities derivatives are higher risk but may also lead to higher profits.<ref>Jon Gregory. Counterparty credit risk. {{ISBN|978-0-470-68576-1}}. p. 7.</ref>

Between 2007 and 2010, global physical exports of commodities fell by 2%, while the outstanding value of OTC commodities derivatives declined by two-thirds as investors reduced risk following a five-fold increase in the previous three years.

Money under management more than doubled between 2008 and 2010 to nearly $380 billion. Inflows into the sector totaled over $60 billion in 2010, the second-highest year on record, down from $72 billion the previous year. The bulk of funds went into precious metals and energy products. The growth in prices of many commodities in 2010 contributed to the increase in the value of commodities funds under management.<ref>[http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Commodities-Trading-2011.pdf Commodities Trading report] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20151107060517/http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Commodities-Trading-2011.pdf archive])</ref>

==Commodities exchange==
{{main|Commodities exchange}}
A commodities exchange is an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] where various commodities and derivatives are traded. Most commodity markets across the world trade in agricultural products and other raw materials (like wheat, barley, sugar, maize, cotton, [[Cocoa bean|coco]]a, coffee, milk products, pork bellies, oil, metals, etc.) and contracts based on them. These contracts can include spot prices, forwards, futures and options on futures. Other sophisticated products may include interest rates, environmental instruments, swaps, or freight contracts.<ref name=NFA2006 />

===Energy===
Energy commodities include [[crude oil]] particularly [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) crude oil and [[Brent Crude|Brent crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[heating oil]], [[ethanol]] and [[purified terephthalic acid]]. [[fuel hedging|Hedging]] is a common practice for these commodities.

====Crude oil and natural gas====
{{See also|Chronology of world oil market events (1970–2005)}}

For many years, [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) crude oil, a [[Light crude oil|light, sweet crude oil]], was the world's most-traded commodity. WTI is a grade used as a [[benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark in oil pricing]]. It is the [[underlying]] [[commodity]] of Chicago Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts. WTI is often referenced in news reports on oil prices, alongside [[Brent Crude]]. WTI is lighter and sweeter than Brent and considerably lighter and sweeter than Dubai or Oman.<ref>[[Marius Vassiliou]] (2009). Historical Dictionary of the Petroleum Industry. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press. {{ISBN|0-8108-5993-9}}.</ref>

From April through October 2012, Brent futures contracts exceeded those for WTI, the longest streak since at least 1995.<ref name=BrentWTI2012>

Crude oil can be light or [[Heavy crude oil|heavy]]. Oil was the first form of energy to be widely traded. Some commodity market speculation is directly related to the stability of certain states, e.g., [[Iraq]], [[Bahrain]], [[Iran]], [[Venezuela]] and many others. Most commodities markets are not so tied to the politics of volatile regions.

Oil and gasoline are traded in units of 1,000 barrels (42,000 US gallons). WTI crude oil is traded through [[NYMEX]] under [[Ticker symbol|trading symbol]] CL and through [[Intercontinental Exchange]] (ICE) under trading symbol WBS. Brent crude oil is traded in through Intercontinental Exchange under trading symbol BRN and on the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange|CME]] under trading symbol BZ. [[Gulf Coast Gasoline]] is traded through NYMEX  with the trading symbol of LR. [[Gasoline]] (reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending or RBOB) is traded through NYMEX via trading symbol RB. [[Propane]] is traded through NYMEX, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange since early 2013, via trading symbol PN.

Natural gas is traded through NYMEX in units of 10,000 million BTU with the trading symbol of NG. [[Heating oil]] is traded through NYMEX under trading symbol HO.

====Others====
[[Purified terephthalic acid]] (PTA) is traded through ZCE in units of 5 tons with the trading symbol of TA. [[Ethanol]] is traded at [[Chicago Board of Trade|CBOT]] in units of 29,000 U.S. gal under trading symbols AC (Open Auction) and ZE (Electronic).

===Metals===
====Precious metals====
[[Precious metal]]s currently traded on the commodity market include [[gold]], [[platinum]], [[palladium]] and [[silver]] which are sold by the [[troy ounce]]. One of the main exchanges for these precious metals is [[New York Mercantile Exchange|COMEX]].

According to the [[World Gold Council]], investments in gold are the primary driver of industry growth. Gold prices are highly volatile, driven by large flows of speculative money.<ref name=NYT13Apr2012>

====Industrial metals====
Industrial metals are sold by the [[metric ton]] through the [[London Metal Exchange]] and [[New York Mercantile Exchange]]. The London Metal Exchange trades include [[copper]], [[aluminium]], [[lead]], [[tin]], [[aluminium alloy]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]] and [[molybdenum]]. In 2007, [[steel]] began trading on the London Metal Exchange.

Iron ore has been the latest addition to industrial metal derivatives. Deutsche Bank first began offering iron ore swaps in 2008, other banks quickly followed. Since then the size of the market has more than doubled each year between 2008 and 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalresourcejournal.com/features/january13_features/the_importance_of_iron_ore_derivatives.html|title=The Importance of Iron Ore Derivatives - The International Resource Journal|website=www.internationalresourcejournal.com|access-date=6 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915161411/http://www.internationalresourcejournal.com/features/january13_features/the_importance_of_iron_ore_derivatives.html|archive-date=15 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Agriculture===
{{see also|Hedge (finance)#Agricultural commodity price hedging}}
Agricultural commodities include grains, food and fiber as well as livestock and meat, various regulatory bodies define agricultural products.<ref>''See'' the [[Futures Trading Act of 1921]], Declared unconstitutional in [[Hill v. Wallace]] 259 U.S. 44 (1922), the [[Grain Futures Act]] of 1922 and [[Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen]] 262 US 1 (1923).</ref>

In 1900, corn acreage was double that of wheat in the United States. But from the 1930s through the 1970s soybean acreage surpassed corn. Early in the 1970s grain and soybean prices, which had been relatively stable, "soared to levels that were unimaginable at the time". There were a number of factors affecting prices including the "surge in crude oil prices caused by the Arab Oil Embargo in October 1973 (US inflation reached 11% in 1975)".<ref name=CRB>{{cite web

On 21 July 2010, [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] with changes to the definition of agricultural commodity. The operational definition used by Dodd-Frank includes "[a]ll other commodities that are, or once were, or are derived from, living organisms, including plant, animal and aquatic life, which are generally fungible, within their respective classes, and are used primarily for human food, shelter, animal feed, or natural fiber". Three other categories were explained and listed.<ref name=DoddFrankdefinition2010>

In February 2013, [[Cornell Law School]] included lumber, soybeans, oilseeds, livestock (live cattle and hogs), dairy products. Agricultural commodities can include lumber (timber and forests), grains excluding stored grain (wheat, oats, barley, rye, grain sorghum, cotton, flax, forage, tame hay, native grass), vegetables (potatoes, tomatoes, sweet corn, dry beans, dry peas, freezing and canning peas), fruit (citrus such as oranges, apples, grapes) corn, tobacco, rice, peanuts, sugar beets, sugar cane, sunflowers, raisins, nursery crops, nuts, soybean complex, aquacultural fish farm species such as finfish, mollusk, crustacean, aquatic invertebrate, amphibian, reptile, or plant life cultivated in aquatic plant farms.<ref name=cornell>

===Diamonds===
As of 2012, diamond was not traded as a commodity. Institutional investors were repelled by campaign against "[[blood diamonds]]", the monopoly structure of the diamond market and the lack of uniform standards for diamond pricing. In 2012 the SEC reviewed a proposal to create the "first diamond-backed exchange-traded fund" that would trade on-line in units of one-carat diamonds with a storage vault and delivery point in Antwerp, home of the [[World Federation of Diamond Bourses|Antwerp Diamond Bourse]]. The exchange fund was backed by a company based in [[New York City]] called [[IndexIQ]]. IndexIQ had already introduced 14 exchange-traded funds since 2008.<ref name=NYT13Apr2012 /><ref>

According to [[Citigroup]] analysts, the annual production of polished diamonds is about $18 billion. Like gold, diamonds are easily authenticated and durable. Diamond prices have been more stable than the metals, as the global diamond monopoly [[De Beers]] once held almost 90% (by 2013 reduced to 40%) of the new diamond market.<ref name=NYT13Apr2012 />

===Other commodity markets===
Rubber trades on the [[Singapore Commodity Exchange]] in units of 1&nbsp;kg priced in US cents. [[Palm oil]] is traded on the [[Malaysian Ringgit]] (RM), [[Bursa Malaysia]] in units of 1&nbsp;kg priced in US cents. Wool is traded on the [[AUD]] in units of 1&nbsp;kg. Polypropylene and Linear Low Density Polyethylene (LL) did trade on the London Metal Exchange in units of 1,000&nbsp;kg priced in USD but was dropped in 2011.

==Regulatory bodies and policies==
===United States===
In the United States, the principal regulator of commodity and futures markets is the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC). The [[National Futures Association]] (NFA) was formed in 1976 and is the futures industry's self-regulatory organization. The NFA's first regulatory operations began in 1982 and fall under the [[Commodity Exchange Act]] of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974|Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act]].<ref name=NFA>
{{cite web
|publisher=National Futures Association

Dodd–Frank was enacted in response to the 2008 financial crisis. It called for "strong measures to limit speculation in agricultural commodities" calling upon the CFTC to further limit positions and to regulate over-the-counter trades.<ref>

The EP voted in favor of stronger regulation of commodity derivative markets in September 2012 to "end abusive speculation in commodity markets" that were "driving global food prices increases and price volatility". In July 2012, "food prices globally soared by 10 percent" ([[World Bank]] 2012). Senior British MEP Arlene McCarthy called for "putting a brake on excessive [[food speculation]] and speculating giants profiting from hunger" ending immoral practices that "only serve the interests of profiteers".<ref name=EU>
