'''Human spaceflight''' (also referred to as '''manned spaceflight''' or '''crewed spaceflight''') is [[spaceflight]] with a crew or passengers aboard a [[spacecraft]], the spacecraft being operated directly by the onboard human crew. Spacecraft can also be [[telerobotic|remotely operated]] from ground stations on Earth, or [[Autonomous robot|autonomously]], without any direct human involvement. Persons trained for spaceflight are called [[astronaut]]s, cosmonauts, or taikonauts; and non-professionals are referred to as [[spaceflight participant]]s.

The first human in space was [[Yuri Gagarin]], who flew the [[Vostok 1]] spacecraft, which was launched by the [[USSR|Soviet Union]] on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April 1961]] as part of the [[Vostok program]]. Humans traveled to the [[Moon]] nine times between 1968 and 1972 as part of the United States [[Apollo program]], and have had a continuous presence in space for {{age in years and days|2 November 2000|sep=and}} on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).<ref>{{cite web |title=Counting the Many Ways the International Space Station Benefits Humanity |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/counting-the-many-ways-the-international-space-station-benefits-humanity |access-date=4 May 2019}}</ref>

To date, [[Russia]], the [[United States]], and [[China]] are the only countries with [[List of human spaceflight programs|public or commercial human spaceflight-capable programs]]. [[List of private spaceflight companies|Non-governmental spaceflight companies]] have been working to develop human space programs of their own, e.g. for [[space tourism]] or commercial [[Space research|in-space research]]. The first private human spaceflight launch was a suborbital flight on [[SpaceShipOne]] on June 21, 2004. The first commercial orbital crew launch was in May 2020, transporting, under government contract, astronauts to the ISS.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SpaceX Astronauts Reach Space Station After Milestone Voyage|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-30/spacex-set-to-retry-historic-rocket-launch-after-weather-delay|access-date=2020-06-16|website=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref>

Human spaceflight capability was first developed during the [[Cold War]] between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR). These nations developed [[intercontinental ballistic missile|intercontinental ballistic missiles]] for the delivery of [[nuclear weapon]]s, producing rockets large enough to be adapted to carry the first [[artificial satellite]]s into [[low Earth orbit]]. 

After the first satellites were launched in 1957 and 1958 by the Soviet Union, the US began work on [[Project Mercury]], with the aim of launching men into orbit. The USSR was secretly pursuing the [[Vostok programme|Vostok program]] to accomplish the same thing, and launched the first human into space, the cosmonaut [[Yuri Gagarin]], who, on 12 April 1961, was launched aboard [[Vostok 1]] on a [[Vostok 3KA]] rocket and completed a single orbit. On 5 May 1961, the US launched its first [[astronaut]], [[Alan Shepard]], on a suborbital flight aboard ''[[Freedom 7]]'' on a [[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Mercury-Redstone rocket]]. Unlike Gagarin, Shepard manually [[attitude control|controlled his spacecraft's attitude]]. On 20 February 1962, [[John Glenn]] became the first American in orbit, aboard ''[[Friendship 7]]'' on a [[Atlas LV-3B|Mercury-Atlas rocket]]. The USSR launched five more cosmonauts in Vostok [[space capsule|capsule]]s, including the first woman in space, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] aboard [[Vostok 6]], on 16 June 1963. Through 1963, the US launched a total of two astronauts in suborbital flights and four into orbit. The US also made two [[North American X-15]] flights ([[X-15 Flight 90|90]] and [[X-15 Flight 91|91]], piloted by [[Joseph A. Walker]]) that exceeded the [[Kármán line]], the internationally recognized {{convert|100|km}} altitude used by the [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] (FAI) to denote the edge of space.

In 1961, US President [[John F. Kennedy]] raised the stakes of the Space Race by setting the goal of landing a man on the [[Moon]] and returning him safely to Earth by the end of the 1960s.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Kennedy, John F. |date=25 May 1961 |title=Special Message to Congress on Urgent National Needs |medium=Motion picture (excerpt) |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/xzw1gaeeTES6khED14P1Iw.aspx |access-date=1 August 2013 |publisher=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum |location=Boston, MA |id=Accession Number: TNC:200; Digital Identifier: TNC-200-2}}</ref> That same year, the US began the [[Apollo program]] of launching three-man capsules atop the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn family of launch vehicles]] to accomplish this; and, in 1962, began [[Project Gemini]], which, in 1965 and 1966, flew 10 missions with two-man crews launched by [[Titan II GLV|Titan II rockets]], Gemini's objective being to support Apollo by developing American orbital spaceflight experience and techniques to be used during the Moon mission.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Loff  |first1=Sarah  |title=Gemini: Stepping Stone to the Moon |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/gemini/#.VKi1GsaWt78 |website=Gemini: Bridge to the Moon |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |access-date=4 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221151510/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/gemini/ |archive-date=21 December 2014 |location=Washington, DC |date=21 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the USSR remained silent about their intentions to send humans to the Moon, and proceeded to stretch the limits of their single-pilot Vostok capsule by adapting it to a two or three-person [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] capsule to compete with Gemini. They were able to launch two orbital flights in 1964 and 1965 and achieved the first [[spacewalk]], performed by [[Alexei Leonov]] on [[Voskhod 2]] on 8 March 1965. However, the Voskhod did not have Gemini's capability to maneuver in orbit, and the program was terminated. The US Gemini flights did not achieve the first spacewalk, but overcame the early Soviet lead by performing several spacewalks, solving the problem of astronaut fatigue caused by compensating for the lack of gravity, demonstrating the ability of humans to endure two weeks in space, and performing the first [[space rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking]] of spacecraft.

The US succeeded in developing the [[Saturn V]] rocket necessary to send the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon, and sent [[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]], and [[William Anders]] into 10 orbits around the Moon in [[Apollo 8]] in December 1968. In July 1969, [[Apollo 11]] accomplished Kennedy's goal by landing [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] on the Moon on 21 July and returning them safely on 24 July, along with Command Module pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]]. Through 1972, a total of six Apollo missions landed 12 men to walk on the Moon, half of which drove [[Lunar Roving Vehicle|electric powered vehicles]] on the surface. The crew of [[Apollo 13]]—[[Jim Lovell]], [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]]—survived a catastrophic in-flight spacecraft failure, orbited the Moon without landing, and returned safely to Earth.

[[File:Soyuz TMA-7 spacecraft2edit1.jpg|thumb|[[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]], most serial spacecraft]]
[[File:Salyut 1 and Soyuz drawing.png|thumb|[[Salyut 1]], first crewed space station, with docked Soyuz spacecraft]]

Meanwhile, the USSR secretly pursued [[Soviet crewed lunar programs|crewed lunar orbiting and landing programs]]. They successfully developed the three-person [[Soyuz spacecraft]] for use in the lunar programs, but failed to develop the [[N1 (rocket)|N1 rocket]] necessary for a human landing, discontinuing their lunar programs in 1974.<ref>{{cite book|title = Challenge To Apollo The Soviet Union and The Space Race, 1945–1974|last = Siddiqi|first = Asif|page = 832|publisher = NASA|url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?Ntk=all&Ntx=mode%20matchall&Ntt=SP-2000-4408}}</ref> Upon losing the Moon race they concentrated on the development of [[space station]]s, using the Soyuz as a ferry to take cosmonauts to and from the stations. They started with a series of [[Salyut program|Salyut]] sortie stations from 1971 to 1986.

==== Post-Apollo era ====
[[File:Apollo-Soyuz-Test-Program-artist-rendering.jpg|thumb|Artist's rendering of an [[Apollo CSM]] is about to dock with a [[Soyuz spacecraft]].]]

In 1969, Nixon appointed his vice president, [[Spiro Agnew]], to head a Space Task Group to recommend follow-on human spaceflight programs after Apollo. The group proposed an ambitious [[Space Transportation System]] based on a [[Space Shuttle design process|reusable Space Shuttle]], which consisted of a winged, internally fueled orbiter stage burning liquid hydrogen, launched with a similar, but larger [[RP-1|kerosene]]-fueled booster stage, each equipped with airbreathing jet engines for powered return to a runway at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] launch site. Other components of the system included a permanent, modular space station; reusable [[space tug]]; and [[NERVA|nuclear]] interplanetary ferry, leading to a [[human mission to Mars|human expedition to Mars]] as early as 1986 or as late as 2000, depending on the level of funding allocated. However, Nixon knew the American political climate would not support congressional funding for such an ambition, and killed proposals for all but the Shuttle, possibly to be followed by the space station. [[Space Shuttle|Plans for the Shuttle were scaled back]] to reduce development risk, cost, and time, replacing the piloted fly back booster with two reusable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]]s, and the smaller orbiter would use an expendable [[Space Shuttle external tank|external propellant tank]] to feed its hydrogen-fueled [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engine]]s. The orbiter would have to make unpowered landings.

[[File:Space Shuttle Atlantis landing at KSC following STS-122 (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Space Shuttle orbiter]], first crewed orbital spaceplane]]

In 1973, the US launched the [[Skylab]] sortie space station and inhabited it for 171 days with three crews ferried aboard Apollo spacecraft. During that time, President [[Richard Nixon]] and Soviet Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]] were negotiating an easing of Cold War tensions known as [[détente]]. As part of this, they negotiated the [[Apollo-Soyuz]] program, in which an Apollo spacecraft carrying a special docking adapter module rendezvoused and docked with [[Soyuz 19]] in 1975. The American and Russian crews shook hands in space, but the purpose of the flight was purely symbolic.

The two nations continued to compete rather than cooperate in space, as the US turned to developing the Space Shuttle and planning the space station, which was dubbed ''[[Space Station Freedom|Freedom]]''. The USSR launched three [[Almaz]] military sortie stations from 1973 to 1977, disguised as Salyuts. They followed Salyut with the development of ''[[Mir]]'', the first modular, semi-permanent space station, the construction of which took place from 1986 to 1996. ''Mir'' orbited at an altitude of {{convert|354|km|nmi|abbr=off|sp=us}}, at an [[orbital inclination]] of 51.6°. It was occupied for 4,592 days and made a controlled reentry in 2001.

The Space Shuttle started flying in 1981, but the US Congress failed to approve sufficient funds to make ''Space Station Freedom'' a reality. A fleet of four shuttles was built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. A fifth shuttle, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built to replace ''Challenger'', which was destroyed in [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|an accident during launch]] that killed 7 astronauts on 28 January 1986. From 1983 to 1998, twenty-two Shuttle flights carried components for a [[European Space Agency]] sortie space station called [[Spacelab]] in the Shuttle payload bay.<ref name=StoryShuttle>{{cite book |title=The Story of the Space Shuttle |author=David Michael Harland |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] Praxis |date=2004 |page=[https://archive.org/details/storyofspaceshut0000harl/page/444 444] |isbn=978-1-85233-793-3 |author-link=David M.

[[File:Buran on An-225 (Le Bourget 1989) (cropped).JPEG|thumb|''[[Buran programme|Buran]]''-class orbiter, copy of the Space Shuttle orbiter]]

The USSR copied the US's reusable [[Space Shuttle orbiter]], which they called ''[[Buran programme|Buran]]''-class orbiter or simply ''Buran'', which was designed to be launched into orbit by the expendable [[Energia]] rocket, and capable of robotic orbital flight and landing. Unlike the Space Shuttle, ''Buran'' had no main rocket engines, but like the Space Shuttle orbiter it used smaller rocket engines to perform its final orbital insertion. A single uncrewed orbital test flight took place in November 1988. A second test flight was planned by 1993, but the program was canceled due to lack of funding and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Two more orbiters were never completed, and the one that performed the uncrewed flight was destroyed in a hangar roof collapse in May 2002.

=== US / Russian cooperation ===
[[File:International Space Station after undocking of STS-132.jpg|thumb|right|International Space Station, assembled in orbit by US and Russia]]

The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought an end to the Cold War and opened the door to true cooperation between the US and Russia. The Soviet Soyuz and Mir programs were taken over by the Russian Federal Space Agency, now known as the [[Roscosmos State Corporation]]. The [[Shuttle-Mir Program]] included American Space Shuttles visiting the ''Mir'' space station, Russian cosmonauts flying on the Shuttle, and an American astronaut flying aboard a Soyuz spacecraft for long-duration expeditions aboard ''Mir''.

In 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] secured Russia's cooperation in converting the planned Space Station ''Freedom'' into the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). Construction of the station began in 1998. The station orbits at an altitude of {{convert|409|km|nmi|sp=us}} and an orbital inclination of 51.65°. Several of the Space Shuttle's 135 orbital flights were to help assemble, supply, and crew the ISS. Russia has built half of the International Space Station and has continued its cooperation with the US.

=== China ===
[[File:Shenzhou left.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shenzhou (spacecraft)|Shenzhou]], first non-USSR and non-USA spacecraft]]

After Russia's launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] intended to place a Chinese satellite in orbit by 1959 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|founding of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2007/10/16/15/33/09.htm|script-title=zh:九章与中国卫星 |publisher= [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]|date=16 October 2007|access-date=3 July 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080314030932/http://www.cas.ac.cn/html/Dir/2007/10/16/15/33/09.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 14 March 2008}}</ref> However, China did not successfully launch its first satellite until 24 April 1970. On 14 July 1967, Mao and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] decided that the PRC should not be left behind, and started China's own human spaceflight program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tech.tom.com/1121/1122/2005916-250955.html |script-title=zh:首批航天员19人胜出 为后来积累了宝贵的经验 |publisher=雷霆万钧 |date=16 September 2005 |access-date=24 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051222024152/http://tech.tom.com/1121/1122/2005916-250955.html |archive-date=22 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> However, the first attempt, the [[Shuguang spacecraft]], which was copied from the US Gemini craft, was canceled on 13 May 1972.
 
China later designed the [[Shenzhou (spacecraft)|Shenzhou spacecraft]], which resembled the Russian Soyuz, and became the third nation to achieve independent human spaceflight capability by launching [[Yang Liwei]] on a 21-hour flight aboard [[Shenzhou 5]] on 15 October 2003. China launched the [[Tiangong-1]] space station on 29 September 2011, and two sortie missions to it: [[Shenzhou 9]] 16–29 June 2012, with China's first female astronaut [[Liu Yang (astronaut)|Liu Yang]]; and [[Shenzhou 10]], 13–26 June 2013. The station was retired on 21 March 2016 and reentered Earth's atmosphere on 2 April 2018, burning up with small fragments impacting the Pacific Ocean. Tiangong-1's successor [[Tiangong-2]] was launched in September 2016. Tiangong-2 hosted a crew of two—[[Jing Haipeng]] and [[Chen Dong (astronaut)|Chen Dong]]—for 30 days. On 22 April 2017, the [[Tianzhou 1]] cargo spacecraft docked with the station, which was later deorbited, in July 2019, burning up over the Pacific.

=== Abandoned programs of other nations ===
The [[European Space Agency]] began development of the [[Hermes (spacecraft)|Hermes]] shuttle [[spaceplane]] in 1987, to be launched on the [[Ariane 5]] expendable launch vehicle. It was intended to dock with the European [[Columbus Man-Tended Free Flyer|Columbus space station]]. The projects were canceled in 1992, when it became clear that neither cost nor performance goals could be achieved. No Hermes shuttles were ever built. The Columbus space station was reconfigured as the [[Columbus (ISS module)|European module of the same name]] on the International Space Station.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

[[Japan]] ([[NASDA]]) began development of the [[HOPE-X]] experimental shuttle spaceplane in the 1980s, to be launched on its [[H-IIA]] expendable launch vehicle. A string of failures in 1998 led to funding reductions, and the project's cancellation in 2003 in favor of participation in the International Space Station program through the [[Kibo (ISS module)|''Kibō'' Japanese Experiment Module]] and [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]] cargo spacecraft. As an alternative to HOPE-X, NASDA in 2001 proposed the [[Fuji (spacecraft)|Fuji crew capsule]] for independent or ISS flights, but the project did not proceed to the contracting stage.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

From 1993 to 1997, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Japanese Rocket Society|ja|3=日本ロケット協会|vertical-align=sup}}, [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]], and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] worked on the proposed [[Kankoh-maru]] [[vertical takeoff and landing|vertical-takeoff-and-landing]] [[single-stage-to-orbit]] reusable launch system. In 2005, this system was proposed for space tourism.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

According to a press release from the [[Iraqi News Agency]] dated 5 December 1989, there was only one test of the [[Tammouz rocket|Tammouz]] space launcher, which [[Iraq]] intended to use to develop its own crewed space facilities by the end of the century. These plans were put to an end by the [[Gulf War]] of 1991 and the economic hardships that followed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

=== United States "Shuttle gap" ===

Under the Bush administration, the [[Constellation program]] included plans for retiring the Space Shuttle program and replacing it with the capability for spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit. In the [[2011 United States federal budget]], the Obama administration canceled Constellation for being over budget and behind schedule while not innovating and investing in critical new technologies.<ref>[http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_space_thewritestuff/2008/11/congressional-w.html Congressional watchdog finds NASA's new rocket is in trouble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129102151/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_space_thewritestuff/2008/11/congressional-w.html |date=29 November 2011 }}. Orlando Sentinel blog summary of official reports. 3 November 2008</ref> As part of the [[Artemis program]], NASA is developing the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] spacecraft to be launched by the [[Space Launch System]]. Under the [[Commercial Crew Development]] plan, NASA will rely on transportation services provided by the private sector to reach low Earth orbit, such as [[SpaceX Dragon 2]], [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]]'s [[Dream Chaser]], or the [[Boeing Starliner]]. The period between the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011 and the first launch into space of [[SpaceShipTwo]] [[VSS Unity VP-03|Flight VP-03]] on 13 December 2018 is similar to the gap between the end of [[Apollo program|Apollo]] in 1975 and the [[STS-1|first Space Shuttle flight]] in 1981, and is referred to by a presidential Blue Ribbon Committee as the U.S. human spaceflight gap.

=== Commercial private spaceflight ===

Since the early 2000s, a variety of [[private spaceflight]] ventures have been undertaken. Several of the companies—including [[Blue Origin]], [[SpaceX]], [[Virgin Galactic]], and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation|Sierra Nevada]]—have plans to advance human spaceflight. {{asof|2016}}, all four of those companies have development programs to fly commercial passengers.

A commercial [[suborbital spaceflight|suborbital]] spacecraft aimed at the [[space tourism]] market is being developed by [[Virgin Galactic]]. Called [[SpaceshipTwo]], it reached space in December 2018.<ref>https://www.space.com/42725-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-unity-4th-powered-flight-twitter-updates.html</ref><ref>David, Leonard.

[[Blue Origin]] has begun a multi-year [[flight test|test]] program of their [[New Shepard]] vehicle and has carried out 11 successful uncrewed test flights in 2015–2019. Blue Origin planned to fly with humans in 2019.

SpaceX and [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security|Boeing]] are both developing passenger-capable [[orbital spaceflight|orbital]] [[space capsule]]s as of 2020, with SpaceX carrying [[Commercial Crew Development|NASA astronauts to the International Space Station]] on board a [[Crew Dragon]] spacecraft on a [[Falcon 9 Block 5]] launch vehicle.

There have been no public announcements of commercial offerings for orbital flights from either company, although both companies are planning some flights with their own private, non-NASA, astronauts on board.

== Passenger travel via spacecraft ==
Over the decades, a number of spacecraft have been proposed for spaceliner passenger travel. Somewhat analogous to travel by [[airliner]] after the middle of the 20th century, these vehicles are proposed to [[space transport|transport]] large numbers of passengers to destinations in space, or on Earth via [[suborbital spaceflight]]s. To date, none of these concepts have been built, although a few vehicles that carry fewer than 10 persons are currently in the [[test flight]] phase of their development process.

One large spaceliner concept currently in early development is the [[SpaceX Starship]], which, in addition to replacing the [[Falcon 9]] and [[Falcon Heavy]] [[launch vehicle]]s in the legacy Earth-orbit [[Space launch market competition|market]] after 2020, has been proposed by SpaceX for long-distance commercial travel on Earth, flying 100+ people suborbitally between two points in under one hour, also known as "Earth-to-Earth".<ref name=rollingstone20171115>{{cite news|last1=Strauss|first1=Neil|title=Elon Musk: The Architect of Tomorrow|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/elon-musk-inventors-plans-for-outer-space-cars-finding-love-w511747|access-date=15 November 2017|work=Rolling Stone|date=15 November 2017}}</ref><ref name=sxEarthToEarth201709>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=40&v=zqE-ultsWt0 Starship Earth to Earth], SpaceX, 28 September 2017, accessed 23 December 2017.</ref><ref name=sn20171015c>{{cite news |last=Foust|first=Jeff |url=http://spacenews.com/musk-offers-more-technical-details-on-bfr-system/ |title=Musk offers more technical details on BFR system |work=[[SpaceNews]] |date=15 October 2017 |access-date=15 October 2017 |quote=[the] spaceship portion of the BFR, which would transport people on point-to-point suborbital flights or on missions to the moon or Mars, will be tested on Earth first in a series of short hops. ... a full-scale Ship doing short hops of a few hundred kilometers altitude and lateral distance ... fairly easy on the vehicle, as no heat shield is needed, we can have a large amount of reserve propellant and don't need the high area ratio, deep space Raptor engines.}}</ref>

Small [[spaceplane]] or small [[space capsule|capsule]] suborbital spacecraft have been under development for the past decade or so; {{asof|2017|lc=y}}, at least one of each type is under development.

== Human representation and participation ==
{{See also|Space law|Human presence in space|Space colonization|Human outpost}}

Participation and representation of humanity in space has been an issue ever since the first phase of space exploration.<ref name="Durrani"/> Some rights of non-spacefaring countries have been secured through international [[space law]], declaring space the "[[Common heritage of mankind|province of all mankind]]", though the sharing of space by all humanity is sometimes critizized as [[imperialism|imperialist]] and lacking.<ref name="Durrani">{{cite web |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/apollo-space-lunar-rockets-colonialism/ |title=Is Spaceflight Colonialism? |author=Haris Durrani |access-date=2 October 2020 |date=19 July 2019}}</ref> In addition to the lack of international inclusion, the inclusion of women and [[people of color]] has also been lacking. To make spaceflight more inclusive, organizations such as the ''Justspace Alliance''<ref name="Durrani"/> and [[IAU]]-featured ''Inclusive Astronomy''<ref>[https://www.inclusiveastronomy.org Website of the IAU100 ''Inclusive Astronomy'' project]</ref> have been formed in recent years.

===Women===
{{Main|Women in space}}

The first woman to ever enter space was [[Valentina Tereshkova]]. She flew in 1963, but it was not until the 1980s that another woman entered space again. At the time, all astronauts were required to be military test pilots; and women were not able to enter this career, which is one reason for the delay in allowing women to join space crews.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} After the rules were changed, [[Svetlana Savitskaya]] became the second woman to enter space; she was also from the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Sally Ride]] became the next woman to enter space and the first woman to enter space through the United States program.

Since then, eleven other countries have allowed women astronauts. The first all-female space walk occurred in 2018, by [[Christina Koch]] and [[Jessica Meir]]. These two women had both participated in separate space walks with NASA. The first woman to go to the moon is planned for 2024.

Despite these developments women are still underrepresented among astronauts and especially cosmonauts. Issues that block potential applicants from the programs, and limit the space missions they are able to go on, are, for example:
* agencies limiting women to half as much time in space than men, due to suppositions that women are at greater potential risk for cancer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.space.com/22252-women-astronauts-radiation-risk.html | title = Female Astronauts Face Discrimination from Space Radiation Concerns, Astronauts Say | first = Miriam | last = Kramer | date = 27 August 2013 | access-date = 7 January 2017 | work = Space.com | publisher = Purch}}</ref>
* a lack of space suits sized appropriately for female astronauts.<ref name="clothing">{{cite magazine |last=Sokolowski |first=Susan L.|title= Female astronauts: How performance products like space suits and bras are designed to pave the way for women's accomplishments|url=https://theconversation.com/female-astronauts-how-performance-products-like-space-suits-and-bras-are-designed-to-pave-the-way-for-womens-accomplishments-114346 |date=5 April 2019 | magazine =The Conversation |access-date=10 May 2020 }}</ref>

Additionally, women have been discriminated against in other ways, for example as with Sally Ride being scrutinized more than her male counterparts and asked sexist questions by the press.

== Milestones ==

[[Sally Ride]] became the first American woman in space, in 1983. [[Eileen Collins]] was the first female Shuttle pilot, and with Shuttle mission [[STS-93]] in 1999 she became the first woman to command a U.S. spacecraft.

For many years, only the USSR (later [[Russia]]) and the United States were the only countries whose astronauts flew in space. That ended with the 1978 flight of Vladimir Remek. {{As of|2010}}, citizens from 38 nations (including [[space tourism|space tourists]]) have flown in space aboard Soviet, American, Russian, and Chinese spacecraft.

== Space programs ==
{{Main|List of human spaceflight programs}}
{{Redirect|Astronaut corps|subdivision of NASA|NASA Astronaut Corps}}

Human spaceflight programs have been conducted by the Soviet Union–Russian Federation, the United States, [[Mainland China]], and by American [[private spaceflight]] companies.

{{human spaceflight capability}}

===Current programs===
The following space vehicles and [[spaceport]]s are currently used for launching human spaceflights:
* [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz program]] ([[Soviet Union|USSR]]/Russia): spacecraft on [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz launch vehicle]], from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]; 140 crewed orbital flights since 1967, including two in-flight aborts which failed to reach orbit, {{As of|alt=as of March 2019|2019|March}} 
* [[Shenzhou program]] (China): spacecraft on [[Long March (rocket family)|Long March launch vehicle]], from [[Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center]]; 5 flights since 2003, {{As of|alt=as of July 2016|2016|July}}
* [[SpaceShipTwo]] (US): Air launched from [[Scaled Composites White Knight Two|White Knight Two]] carrier aircraft. 2 suborbital spaceflights since 2018, as of February 2019
* [[Crew Dragon]] (US): Part of the [[Commercial Crew Program]], launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on a [[Falcon 9 Block 5|Falcon 9]] rocket. One successful launch with more in the planning stages.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NASA Astronauts Launch from America in Test of SpaceX Crew Dragon|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-astronauts-launch-from-america-in-historic-test-flight-of-spacex-crew-dragon|last=Potter|first=Sean|date=2020-05-30|website=NASA|access-date=2020-05-31}}</ref>

The following [[space stations]] are currently maintained in Earth orbit for human occupation:
* [[International Space Station]] (US and Russia) assembled in orbit: altitude {{convert|409|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}}, 51.65° orbital inclination; crews transported by Soyuz spacecraft

Most of the time, the only humans in space are those aboard the ISS, whose crew of up to 7 spends up to six months at a time in [[low Earth orbit]].

Numerous private companies attempted human spaceflight programs in an effort to win the $10 million [[Ansari X Prize]]. The first private human spaceflight took place on 21 June 2004, when SpaceShipOne conducted a suborbital flight. SpaceShipOne captured the prize on 4 October 2004, when it accomplished two consecutive flights within one week.

[[NASA]] and [[ESA]] use the term "human spaceflight" to refer to their programs of launching people into space. These endeavors have also been referred to as "manned space missions", though because of gender specificity this is no longer official parlance according to NASA style guides.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/styleguide.html |title=Style Guide |publisher=[[NASA]] |access-date=6 January 2016}}</ref>

===Planned future programs===
Under the [[Indian Human Spaceflight Programme|Indian Human Spaceflight Program]], India is planning to send humans into space on its orbital vehicle [[Gaganyaan]] before August 2022. The [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) began work on this project in 2006.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Scientists Discuss Indian Manned Space Mission|url=https://www.isro.gov.in/update/07-nov-2006/scientists-discuss-indian-manned-space-mission|publisher=Indian Space Research Organisation|date=2006-11-07}}</ref><ref name="Kadursrinivas 2017">{{cite web |last1=Rao |first1=Mukund Kadursrinivas |last2=Murthi |first2=Sridhara, K.

Since 2008, the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] has developed the [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]] cargo-spacecraft-based crewed spacecraft and [[Kibo (ISS module)|''Kibō'' Japanese Experiment Module]]–based small space laboratory.

[[NASA]] is developing a plan to land humans on Mars by the 2030s. The first step will begin with [[Artemis 1]] in 2021, sending an uncrewed [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] spacecraft to a [[distant retrograde orbit]] around the Moon and returning it to Earth after a 25-day mission.

Several other countries and space agencies have announced and begun human spaceflight programs using natively developed equipment and technology, including [[Japan]] ([[JAXA]]), [[Iran]] ([[Iranian Space Agency|ISA]]), and [[North Korea]] ([[National Aerospace Development Administration|NADA]]). The plans for the [[Iranian crewed spacecraft]] are for a small spacecraft and space laboratory. [[North Korea]]'s [[National Aerospace Development Administration|space program]] has plans for crewed spacecraft and small shuttle systems.

=== National spacefaring attempts ===
: ''This section lists all nations which have attempted human spaceflight programs. This should not to be confused with [[List of space travelers by nationality|nations with citizens who have traveled into space]], including space tourists, flown or intending to fly by a foreign country's or non-domestic private company's space systems – who are not counted in this list toward their country's national spacefaring attempts.''

== Safety concerns ==
There are two main sources of hazard in space flight: those due to the hostile space environment, and those due to possible equipment malfunctions.

=== Environmental hazards ===
{{See also|Bioastronautics|Space habitat|Effect of spaceflight on the human body|Locomotion in Space}}

Planners of human spaceflight missions face a number of safety concerns.

==== Life support ====
{{Main| Life support system}}

The basic needs for breathable air and drinkable water are addressed by the [[life support system]] of the spacecraft.

{{See also|Astronautical hygiene}}

==== Medical issues ====
{{See also|Effect of spaceflight on the human body|Sleep in space|Space medicine}}

Astronauts may not be able to quickly return to Earth or receive medical supplies, equipment, or personnel if a medical emergency occurs. The astronauts may have to rely for long periods on limited resources and medical advice from the ground.

===== Microgravity =====
{{See also|Weightlessness}}
[[File:Space fluid shift.gif|thumb|The effects of microgravity on fluid distribution around the body (greatly exaggerated).]]

Medical data from astronauts in low Earth orbits for long periods, dating back to the 1970s, show several adverse effects of a microgravity environment: loss of [[bone]] density, decreased muscle strength and endurance, postural instability, and reductions in aerobic capacity. Over time these [[deconditioning]] effects can impair astronauts' performance or increase their risk of injury.<ref>

In a weightless environment, astronauts put almost no weight on the back [[muscle]]s or leg muscles used for standing up, which causes the muscles to weaken and get smaller. Astronauts can lose up to twenty per cent of their muscle mass on spaceflights lasting five to eleven days. The consequent loss of strength could be a serious problem in case of a landing emergency.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/64249main_ffs_factsheets_hbp_atrophy.pdf|title = NASA Information: Muscle Atrophy|access-date = 20 November 2015|website = NASA}}</ref> Upon returning to Earth from [[long-duration spaceflight|long-duration]] flights, astronauts are considerably weakened and are not allowed{{by whom|date=October 2020}}<!-- is this rule USSR, USA, India, China, ... or do we have a source that indicates this is a truth for all astronauts in all nations states? --> to drive a car for twenty-one days.<ref>{{cite web|title = Earth Living Is Tough for Astronaut Used to Space|url = http://www.space.com/21413-hadfield-astronaut-health-return-earth.html|website = Space.com|access-date = 21 November 2015}}</ref>

Astronauts experiencing weightlessness will often lose their orientation, get [[motion sickness]], and lose their sense of direction as their bodies try to get used to a weightless environment. When they get back to Earth, they have to readjust and may have problems standing up, focusing their gaze, walking, and turning. Importantly, those motor disturbances only get worse the longer the exposure to weightlessness.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3830060&page=1 | last=Watson | first=Traci | date=11 November 2007 | title=Readjusting to gravity anti-fun for astronauts | publisher=ABC News | access-date=14 February 2020}}</ref> These changes can affect the ability to perform tasks required for approach and landing, docking, remote manipulation, and emergencies that may occur while landing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

It was concluded by NASA that the cosmonauts most likely had hallucinated the smell.

It is possible that the mental health of astronauts can be affected by the changes in the sensory systems while in prolonged space travel.

===== Sensory systems =====
During astronauts' spaceflight, they are in an extreme environment. This, and the fact that little change is taking place in the environment, will result in the weakening of sensory input to the astronauts' seven senses.

* [[Hearing]] – In the space station and spacecraft there are no noises from the outside, as there is no medium that can transmit sound waves. Although there are other team members who can talk to each other, their voices become familiar and do not stimulating the sense of hearing as much. Mechanical noises become familiar, as well.
* [[Sight]] – Because of weightlessness, the body's liquids attain an equilibrium that is different from what it is on the Earth. For this reason, an astronaut's face swells and presses on the eyes; and therefore their vision is impaired. The landscape surrounding the astronauts is constant, which lessens visual stimulations. Due to cosmic rays, astronauts may see flashes.
* [[Sense of smell|Smell]] – The space station has a permanent odor described as the smell of gunpowder. Due to the zero gravity, the bodily fluids rise to the face and prevent the sinuses from drying up, which dulls the sense of smell.
* [[Taste]] – The sense of taste is directly affected by the sense of smell and therefore when the sense of smell is dulled, the sense of taste is also. The astronauts' food is bland, and there are only certain foods that can be eaten. The food comes only once every few months, when supplies arrive, and there is little or no variety.
* [[Somatosensory system|Touch]] – There are almost no stimulating changes in physical contact. There is almost no human physical contact during the journey.
* The [[vestibular system]] (motion and equilibrium system) – Due to the lack of gravity, all the movements required of the astronauts are changed, and the vestibular system is damaged by the extreme change.
* The [[Proprioception|proprioception system]] (the sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement) – As a result of weightlessness, few forces are exerted on the astronauts' muscles; and there is less stimulus to this system.

=== Equipment hazards ===
Space flight requires much higher velocities than ground or air transportation, and consequently requires the use of high [[energy density]] propellants for launch, and the dissipation of large amounts of energy, usually as heat, for safe reentry through the Earth's atmosphere.

==== Launch ====
{{See also| Launch escape system}}
[[File:Sts33-e204.jpg|thumb|There was no practical way for the {{OV|99}}'s crew to safely abort before the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|vehicle's violent disintegration]].]]

Since rockets have the potential for fire or explosive destruction, [[space capsule]]s generally employ some sort of [[launch escape system]], consisting either of a tower-mounted solid-fuel rocket to quickly carry the capsule away from the [[launch vehicle]] (employed on [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]], and [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]], the escape tower being discarded at some point after launch, at a point where an abort can be performed using the spacecraft's engines), or else [[ejection seat]]s (employed on [[Vostok spacecraft|Vostok]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]]) to carry astronauts out of the capsule and away for individual parachute landings.

Such a launch escape system is not always practical for multiple-crew-member vehicles (particularly [[spaceplane]]s), depending on location of egress hatch(es). When the single-hatch Vostok capsule was modified to become the 2 or 3-person [[Voskhod (spacecraft)|Voskhod]], the single-cosmonaut ejection seat could not be used, and no escape tower system was added. The two Voskhod flights in 1964 and 1965 avoided launch mishaps. The [[Space Shuttle]] carried ejection seats and escape hatches for its pilot and copilot in early flights; but these could not be used for passengers who sat below the flight deck on later flights, and so were discontinued.

There have been only two in-flight launch aborts of a crewed flight. The first occurred on [[Soyuz 7K-T No.39|Soyuz 18a]] on 5 April 1975. The abort occurred after the launch escape system had been jettisoned when the launch vehicle's spent second stage failed to separate before the third stage ignited and the vehicle strayed off course. The crew finally managed to separate the spacecraft, firing its engines to pull it away from the errant rocket, both cosmonauts landing safely. The second occurred on 11 October 2018 with the launch of [[Soyuz MS-10]]. Again, both crew members survived.

In the first use of a launch escape system on the launchpad, before the start of a crewed flight, happened during the planned [[Soyuz 7K-ST No. 16L|Soyuz T-10a]] launch on 26 September 1983, which was aborted by a launch vehicle fire 90 seconds before liftoff. Both cosmonauts aboard landed safely.

The only crew fatality during launch occurred on 28 January 1986, when the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] broke apart 73 seconds after liftoff, due to failure of a [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] seal, which caused the failure of the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank]], resulting in explosion of the fuel and separation of the boosters. All seven crew members were killed.

==== Extravehicular activity ====
Despite the ever-present risks related to mechanical failures while working in open space, no [[extravehicular activity|spacewalking astronaut]] has ever been lost. There is a requirement for spacewalking astronauts to use tethers and sometimes supplementary anchors. If those fail, a spacewalking astronaut would most probably float away impelled by forces that were acting on the astronaut at the time of breaking loose. Such an astronaut would possibly be spinning, as kicking and flailing would be of no use. At the right angle and velocity, the astronaut might even re-enter the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and burn up. [[NASA]] has protocols for such situations: astronauts would be wearing an emergency jetpack that would automatically counter any tumbling. NASA's plan states that astronauts should then take manual control of the jetpack and fly back to safety.{{fact|date=October 2020}}

However, if the jetpack's {{convert|3|lb}} of fuel runs out, and if there is no other astronaut in close proximity to help, or if the air lock is irreparably damaged, the [[space exposure|outcome would certainly be fatal]]. At this time, there is no spacecraft to save an astronaut floating in space, as the only one with a rescue-ready air-locked compartment — [[Space Shuttle retirement|the Space Shuttle]] — retired {{age|July 2011|{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}} years ago. There is approximately a litre of water available via straw in an astronaut's helmet. The astronaut<!-- use gender-neutral language, see [[MOS:GENDER]] --> would wait roughly 7.5 hours for breathable air to run out before dying of suffocation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sofge |first1=Eric |title=What Happens If An Astronaut Floats Off In Space? |url=https://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2013-09/what-happens-if-astronaut-floats-space/ |website=Popular Science}}</ref>

==== Reentry and landing ====
{{See also| Atmospheric reentry}}

The single pilot of [[Soyuz 1]], [[Vladimir Komarov]], was killed when his capsule's parachutes failed during an emergency landing on 24 April 1967, causing the capsule to crash.

On 1 February 2003, the crew of seven aboard the {{OV|102}} were [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|killed on reentry]] after completing a [[STS-107|successful mission in space]]. A wing-leading-edge [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] heat shield had been damaged by a piece of frozen [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] foam insulation that had broken off and struck the wing during launch. Hot reentry gasses entered and destroyed the wing structure, leading to the breakup of the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|orbiter vehicle]].

==== Artificial atmosphere ====
There are two basic choices for an artificial atmosphere: either an Earth-like mixture of oxygen and an inert gas such as nitrogen or helium, or pure oxygen, which can be used at lower than standard atmospheric pressure. A nitrogen–oxygen mixture is used in the International Space Station and Soyuz spacecraft, while low-pressure pure oxygen is commonly used in space suits for [[extravehicular activity]].

The use of a gas mixture carries the risk of [[decompression sickness]] (commonly known as "the bends") when transitioning to or from the pure oxygen space suit environment. There have been instances of injury and fatalities caused by suffocation in the presence of too much nitrogen and not enough oxygen.
* In 1960, [[McDonnell Aircraft]] test pilot G.B. North passed out and was seriously injured when testing a Mercury cabin–space suit atmosphere system in a vacuum chamber, due to nitrogen-rich air leaking from the cabin into his space suit feed.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Giblin |first=Kelly A. |date=Spring 1998 |title =Fire in the Cockpit! |journal=[[American Heritage of Invention & Technology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |publisher=American Heritage Publishing |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_46.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120153024/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_46.shtml |archive-date=20 November 2008 |access-date=23 March 2011}}</ref> This incident led NASA to decide on a pure oxygen atmosphere for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft.
* In 1981, three pad workers were killed by a nitrogen-rich atmosphere in the aft engine compartment of the {{OV|102}} at the [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010605212352/http://www-lib.ksc.nasa.gov/lib/chrono.html 1981 KSC Chronology Part 1 – pages 84, 85, 100; Part 2 – pages 181, 194, 195], NASA</ref>
* In 1995, two pad workers were similarly killed by a nitrogen leak in a confined area of the [[Ariane 5]] launch pad at [[Guiana Space Centre]].<ref>[http://www.esa.int/esaCP/Pr_17_1995_p_EN.html "Fatal accident at the Guiana Space Centre"], ''ESA Portal'', 5 May 1993</ref>

A pure oxygen atmosphere carries the risk of fire. The original design of the Apollo spacecraft used pure oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure prior to launch. An electrical fire started in the cabin of [[Apollo 1]] during a ground test at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34]] on 27 January 1967, and spread rapidly. The high pressure, increased by the fire, prevented removal of the [[plug door]] hatch cover in time to rescue the crew. All three astronauts—[[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger Chaffee]]—were killed.<ref name="SP4029">{{cite book |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |access-date=12 July 2013 |series=NASA History Series |orig-year=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |work=NASA History Division, Office of Policy and Plans |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=978-0-16-050631-4 |lccn=00061677 |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |chapter=Apollo 1 – The Fire: 27 January 1967 |chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_01a_Summary.htm}}</ref> This led NASA to use a nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere before launch, and low pressure pure oxygen only in space.

The March 1966 [[Gemini 8]] mission was aborted in orbit when an [[attitude control system]] thruster stuck in the on position, sending the craft into a dangerous spin that threatened the lives of [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[David Scott]]. Armstrong had to shut the control system off and use the reentry control system to stop the spin. The craft made an emergency reentry and the astronauts landed safely. The most probable cause was determined to be an electrical short due to a [[static electricity]] discharge, which caused the thruster to remain powered even when switched off. The control system was modified to put each thruster on its own isolated circuit.

The third lunar landing expedition, [[Apollo 13]], in April 1970, was aborted and the lives of the crew—[[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]], [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]]—were threatened after the failure of a [[cryogenic]] [[liquid oxygen]] tank en route to the Moon. The tank burst when electrical power was applied to internal stirring fans in the tank, causing the immediate loss of all of its contents, and also damaging the second tank, causing the gradual loss of its remaining oxygen over a period of 130 minutes. This in turn caused loss of electrical power provided by [[fuel cell]]s to the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command spacecraft]]. The crew managed to return to Earth safely by using the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar landing craft]] as a "life boat". The tank failure was determined to be caused by two mistakes: the tank's drain fitting had been damaged when it was dropped during factory testing, necessitating the use of its internal heaters to boil out the oxygen after a pre-launch test; which in turn damaged the fan wiring's electrical insulation because the thermostats on the heaters did not meet the required voltage rating due to a vendor miscommunication.

The crew of [[Soyuz 11]] were killed on 30 June 1971 by a combination of mechanical malfunctions; the crew were [[asphyxia]]ted due to cabin decompression following separation of their descent capsule from the service module. A cabin ventilation valve had been jolted open at an altitude of {{convert|168|km}} by the stronger-than-expected shock of explosive separation bolts, which were designed to fire sequentially, but in fact had fired simultaneously. The loss of pressure became fatal within about 30 seconds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch8-2.htm|title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|access-date=20 October 2007|publisher=NASA|year=1974|author=NASA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823124845/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch8-2.htm|archive-date=23 August 2007}}</ref>

| [[X-15 Flight 3-65-97]]
| The accident board found that the cockpit instrumentation had been functioning properly, and concluded that Adams had lost control of the X-15 as a result of a combination of distraction, misinterpretation of his instrumentation display, and possible [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]. The electrical disturbance early in the flight degraded the overall effectiveness of the aircraft's control system and further added to pilot workload.
