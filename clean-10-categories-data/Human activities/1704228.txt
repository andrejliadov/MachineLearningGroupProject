'''Soil conservation''' is the prevention of loss of the top most layer of the soil from [[erosion]] or prevention of reduced fertility caused by over usage, [[Soil acidification|acidification]], salinization or other chemical [[soil contamination]].

[[Slash-and-burn]] and other [[unsustainable]] methods of [[subsistence farming]] are practiced in some lesser developed areas. A sequel to the deforestation is typically large scale [[erosion]], loss of soil nutrients and sometimes total [[desertification]]. Techniques for improved soil conservation include [[crop rotation]], [[cover crop]]s, [[Tillage#Conservation tillage|conservation tillage]] and planted [[windbreak]]s, affect both [[erosion]] and [[fertility]]. When plants die, they decay and become part of the soil. Code 330 defines standard methods recommended by the U.S. [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]]. Farmers have practiced soil conservation for millennia. In Europe, policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy are targeting the application of best management practices such as reduced [[tillage]], winter cover crops,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Panagos |first=Panos |last2=Borrelli |first2=Pasquale |last3=Meusburger |first3=Katrin |last4=Alewell |first4=Christine |last5=Lugato |first5=Emanuele |last6=Montanarella |first6=Luca |title=Estimating the soil erosion cover-management factor at the European scale |journal=Land Use Policy |volume=48 |pages=38–50 |doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.05.021 |year=2015|doi-access=free }}</ref> plant residues and grass margins in order to better address the soil conservation. [[Political]] and economic action is further required to solve the erosion problem.

== Contour ploughing  ==
[[Contour ploughing]] orients furrows fellows following the [[contour line]]s of the farmed area. Furrows move left and right to maintain a constant altitude, which reduces [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. Contour ploughing was practiced by the ancient [[Phoenicia]]ns for slopes between two and ten percent.<ref>''Predicting euler erosion by water, a guide to conservation planning in the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation'', [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Agricultural Research Service, Agricultural handbook no. 703 (1997)</ref> Contour ploughing can increase crop yields from 10 to 50 percent, partially as a result of greater soil retention.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/contourfarmingbo23unit|title=Contour farming boosts yields: a farmer's guide in laying out key contour lines and establishing grassed seeds for the ways of life|last=United States. Department of Agriculture|first=National Agricultural Library|date=1943-01-01|publisher=[Washington, D.C.] : U.S. Dept. of Agriculture}}</ref>

== Terrace farming ==
[[terrace (agriculture)|Terracing]] is the practice of creating nearly level areas in a hillside area. The terraces form a series of steps, each at a higher level than the previous. Terraces are protected from erosion by other soil barriers. Terraced farming is more common on small farms

== Keyline design ==

[[Keyline design]] is the enhancement of contour farming, where the total watershed properties are taken into account in forming the [[contour line]]s.

== Perimeter runoff control ==
[[File:Runoff and filtersoxx.ogv|thumb|350px|runoff and filter soxx]]

Tree, [[shrub]]s and [[ground-cover]] are effective perimeter treatment for [[soil erosion]] prevention, by impeding surface flows. A special form of this perimeter or inter-row treatment is the use of a "grass way" that both [[Channel (geography)|channel]]s and dissipates runoff through surface friction, impeding [[surface runoff]] and encouraging infiltration of the slowed surface water.<ref>''Perimeter landscaping of Carneros Business Park'', Lumina Technologies, Santa Rosa, Ca., prepared for Sonoma County, Ca. (2002)</ref>

==Windbreaks==

Windbreaks are sufficiently dense rows of [[tree]]s at the [[Windward and leeward|windward]] exposure of an agricultural field subject to [[wind]] [[erosion]].<ref>Wolfgang Summer, ''Modelling Soil Erosion, Sediment Transport and Closely Related Hydrological Processes'' entry by Mingyuan Du, Peiming Du, Taichi Maki and Shigeto Kawashima, "Numerical modeling of air flow over complex terrain concerning wind erosion", International Association of Hydrological Sciences publication no. 249 (1998)  {{ISBN|1-901502-50-3}}</ref> [[Evergreen]] [[species]] provide year-round protection; however, as long as [[foliage]] is present in the seasons of bare [[soil]] surfaces, the effect of [[deciduous]] trees may be adequate.

== Cover crops/crop rotation ==

Cover crops such as legumes plant, white turnips, radishes and other species are rotated with cash crops to blanket the soil year-round and act as [[green manure]] that replenishes nitrogen and other critical nutrients. Cover crops also help suppress weeds.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news

== Soil-conservation farming ==

Soil-conservation farming involves [[no-till farming]], "green manures" and other soil-enhancing practices which make it hard for the soils to be equalized.  Such farming methods attempt to mimic the biology of [[barren lands]]. They can revive damaged soil, minimize erosion, encourage plant growth, eliminate the use of nitrogen fertilizer or fungicide, produce above-average yields and protect crops during droughts or flooding. The result is less labor and lower costs that increase farmers’ profits. No-till farming and cover crops act as sinks for nitrogen and other nutrients. This increases the amount of [[soil organic matter]].<ref name=":0" />

Repeated plowing/tilling degrades soil, killing its beneficial fungi and earthworms. Once damaged, soil may take multiple seasons to fully recover, even in optimal circumstances.<ref name=":0" />

Critics argue that no-till and related methods are impractical and too expensive for many growers, partly because it requires new equipment. They cite advantages for conventional tilling depending on the geography, crops and soil conditions. Some farmers claimed that no-till complicates pest control, delays planting and that post-harvest residues, especially for corn, are hard to manage.<ref name=":0" />

== Salinity management==
[[File:Aralship2.jpg|thumb|Salt deposits on the former bed of the [[Aral Sea]]]]
{{Main|Soil salinity control}}
[[Salinity]] in soil is caused by irrigating with salty water. Water then evaporates from the soil leaving the salt behind. Salt breaks down the soil structure, causing infertility and reduced growth.
 
The [[ions]] responsible for salination are: [[sodium]] (Na<sup>+</sup>), [[potassium]] (K<sup>+</sup>), [[calcium]] (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), [[magnesium]] (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and [[chlorine]] (Cl<sup>−</sup>). Salinity is estimated to affect about one third of the earth's [[arable land]].<ref>Dan Yaron, ''Salinity in Irrigation and Water Resources'', Marcel Dekker, New York (1981) {{ISBN|0-8247-6741-1}}</ref> Soil salinity adversely affects crop [[metabolism]] and erosion usually follows.

Salinity occurs on [[drylands]] from [[Irrigation|overirrigation]] and in areas with shallow saline water tables. Over-irrigation deposits salts in upper soil layers as a byproduct of soil [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]]; irrigation merely increases the rate of salt deposition. The best-known case of shallow [[saline water]] table [[capillary action]] occurred in [[Egypt]] after the 1970 construction of the [[Aswan Dam]]. The change in the [[groundwater]] level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the [[water table]] led to [[soil salination]].

Use of [[humic acid]]s may prevent excess salination, especially given excessive irrigation.{{Citation needed|reason=this claim appears speculative. Sourcing is needed.|date=February 2019}} Humic acids can fix both [[anion]]s and [[cation]]s and eliminate them from [[root|root zones]].{{Citation needed|reason=dubious claim need sourcing. The ability of humic acid to fix solutes is not expected to work on a scale that is practical for salinity management. Solutes occur at tons per acre, humic acids are applied at pounds per acre. The limits of stoichiometry mean that only pounds per acre of salts will be fixed by adding pounds per acre of very expensive humic acids.|date=February 2019}}

Planting species that can tolerate saline conditions can be used to lower water tables and thus reduce the rate of capillary and evaporative enrichment of surface salts. Salt-tolerant plants include [[saltbush]], a plant found in much of [[North America]] and in the [[Mediterranean]] regions of [[Europe]].

== Soil organisms ==
[[File:K 1033CR08-9 Yellow fungus on stalk.jpeg|thumb|upright|Yellow fungus, a [[mushroom]] that assists in organic decay.]]
When worms excrete [[feces]] in the form of [[Vermicompost|casts]], a balanced selection of minerals and plant nutrients is made into a form accessible for [[root]] uptake. [[Earthworm]] casts are five times richer in available [[nitrogen]], seven times richer in available [[phosphate]]s and eleven times richer in available [[potash]] than the surrounding upper {{Convert|150|mm}} of soil. The weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5&nbsp;kg per worm per year. By burrowing, the earthworm improves soil [[poros]]ity, creating channels that enhance the processes of aeration and drainage.<ref>Bill  Mollison, ''Permaculture: A Designer's Manual'', Tagari Press, (December 1, 1988), 576 pages, {{ISBN|0908228015}}. Increases in porosity enhance infiltration and thus reduce adverse effects of [[surface runoff]].</ref>

Other important soil organisms include [[nematodes]], [[mycorrhiza]] and [[bacteria]]. A quarter of all the animal species live underground. According to the 2020 [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization’s]] report "State of knowledge of soil biodiversity – Status, challenges and potentialities", there are major gaps in knowledge about biodiversity in soils.<ref>{{Cite web|last=FAO, ITPS, GSBI, SCBD and EC|date=2020|title=State of knowledge of soil biodiversity – Status, challenges and potentialities. Summary for policy makers|url=http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/CB1929EN/|access-date=2020-12-04|website=www.fao.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Carrington|first=Damian|date=2020-12-04|title=Global soils underpin life but future looks ‘bleak’, warns UN report|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/04/global-soils-underpin-life-but-future-looks-bleak-warns-un-report|access-date=2020-12-04|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Degraded soil requires [[synthetic fertilizer]] to produce high yields. Lacking structure increases erosion and carries nitrogen and other pollutants into rivers and streams.<ref name=":0" />

Each one percent increase in soil organic matter helps soil hold 20,000 gallons more water per acre.<ref name=":0" />

==Mineralization==
To allow plants full realization of their [[phytonutrient]] potential, active [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of the soil is sometimes undertaken. This can involve adding crushed rock or chemical soil supplements. In either case the purpose is to [[combat]] [[mineral]] depletion. A broad range of minerals can be used, including common substances such  as [[phosphorus]] and more exotic substances such as [[zinc]] and [[selenium]]. Extensive research examines the phase transitions of minerals in soil with aqueous contact.<ref>Arthur T. Hubbard, ''Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science Vol 3'', Santa Barbara, California Science Project, Marcel Dekker, New York (2004) {{ISBN|0-8247-0759-1}}</ref>

Flooding can bring significant [[sediments]] to an [[alluvial]] plain. While this effect may not be desirable if floods endanger life or if the sediment originates from productive land, this process of addition to a [[floodplain]] is a natural process that can rejuvenate soil chemistry through mineralization.
