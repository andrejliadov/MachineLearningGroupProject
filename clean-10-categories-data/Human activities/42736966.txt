In sociology and [[political philosophy]], "Critical Theory"<!--capitalized--> means the [[Western Marxism|Western-Marxist philosophy]] of the [[Frankfurt School]], developed in Germany in the 1930s and drawing on the ideas of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud]].{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Though a "critical theory" or a "critical social theory" may have similar elements of thought, capitalizing Critical Theory as if it were a [[proper noun]] stresses the intellectual lineage specific to the Frankfurt School.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} 

Modern critical theory has also been influenced by [[György Lukács]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], as well as second-generation Frankfurt School scholars, notably [[Jürgen Habermas]]. In Habermas's work, critical theory transcended its theoretical roots in [[German idealism]] and progressed closer to [[Pragmatism|American pragmatism]]. Concern for social "[[base and superstructure]]" is one of the remaining [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist]] philosophical concepts in much contemporary critical theory.<ref name="Outhwaite, William 1988. pp. 5-8">Outhwaite, William.

[[Postmodern]] critical theory analyzes the fragmentation of [[Cultural identity|cultural identities]] in order to challenge [[Modernism|modernist-era]] constructs such as [[Metanarrative|metanarratives]], [[rationality]], and universal truths, while politicizing social problems "by situating them in historical and cultural contexts, to implicate themselves in the process of collecting and analyzing data, and to relativize their findings."<ref name="LINDTAYLOR" />

==Overview<!--'Critical social theory' and 'Critical sociology' redirect here-->==
[[Max Horkheimer]] first defined critical theory ({{lang-de|Kritische Theorie}}) in his 1937 essay "Traditional and Critical Theory", as a [[social theory]] oriented toward [[Critique|critiquing]] and changing [[society]] as a whole, in contrast to traditional theory oriented only toward understanding or explaining it. Wanting to distinguish critical theory as a radical, emancipatory form of [[Marxist philosophy]], Horkheimer critiqued both the model of science put forward by [[logical positivism]], and what he and his colleagues saw as the covert [[positivism]] and [[authoritarianism]] of [[orthodox Marxism]] and [[Communism]]. He described a theory as ''critical'' insofar as it seeks "to liberate human beings from the circumstances that enslave them."<ref>Horkheimer 1982, p. 244.</ref> Critical theory involves a [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] dimension, either by criticizing society in terms of some general theory of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] or norms (''oughts''), or by criticizing society in terms of its own espoused values (i.e. ''[[immanent critique]]'').<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/critical-theory/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Bohman|first=James|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2016|access-date=21 December 2016|archive-date=13 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613210654/https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/critical-theory/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The core concepts of critical theory are that it should:
# be directed at the totality of society in its historical specificity (i.e. how it came to be configured at a specific point in time); and
# improve understanding of society by integrating all the major [[Social science|social sciences]], including [[geography]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[anthropology]], and [[psychology]].

=== Kant and Marx ===
This version of "critical" theory derives from the use of the term ''[[critique]]'' by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and from Marx, on the premise that ''[[Das Kapital]]'' is a "critique of [[political economy]]."

In Kant's [[transcendental idealism]], ''critique'' means examining and establishing the limits of the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of a faculty, type, or body of knowledge, especially by accounting for the limitations of that [[Knowledge-based systems|knowledge system]]'s fundamental, irreducible concepts.

Kant's notion of ''critique'' has been associated with the overturning of false, unprovable, or [[Dogma|dogmatic]] philosophical, social, and political beliefs. His critique of reason involved the critique of dogmatic [[theological]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] ideas and was intertwined with the enhancement of ethical [[autonomy]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] critique of [[superstition]] and irrational authority. Ignored by many in "[[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realist]]" circles is that Kant's immediate impetus for writing ''Critique of Pure Reason'' was to address problems raised by [[David Hume]]'s [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptical]] [[empiricism]] which, in attacking metaphysics, employed reason and logic to argue against the knowability of the world and common notions of [[Causation (sociology)|causation]]. Kant, by contrast, pushed the employment of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' metaphysical claims as requisite, for if anything is to be said to be knowable, it would have to be established upon abstractions distinct from perceivable phenomena.

Marx explicitly developed the notion of ''critique'' into the ''[[critique of ideology]]'', linking it with the practice of [[social revolution]], as stated in the 11th section of his ''[[Theses on Feuerbach]]'': "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm |title=Theses on Feuerbach |others=§XI |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |accessdate=11 April 2015 |archive-date=16 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416221439/https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/theses/theses.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Adorno and Horkheimer ===
One of the distinguishing characteristics of critical theory, as [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]] elaborated in their ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947), is an ambivalence about the ultimate source or foundation of social domination, an ambivalence that gave rise to the "[[pessimism]]" of the new critical theory about the possibility of [[Emancipation|human emancipation]] and [[Political freedom|freedom]].<ref>[[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno, Theodor W.]], and [[Max Horkheimer]]. [1947] 2002. ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', translated by E. Jephcott. Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]]. p. 242.</ref> This ambivalence was rooted in the historical circumstances in which the work was originally produced, particularly the rise of [[Nazism|National Socialism]], [[state capitalism]], and [[culture industry]] as entirely new forms of social domination that could not be adequately explained in the terms of traditional [[Marxist sociology]].<ref>[[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas, Jürgen]]. 1987. "The Entwinement of Myth and Enlightenment: Horkheimer and Adorno." In ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity|The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Twelve Lectures]]'', translated by F. Lawrence. Cambridge, MA: [[MIT Press]]. p. 116:

"Critical Theory was initially developed in Horkheimer's circle to think through political disappointments at the absence of revolution in the West, the development of Stalinism in Soviet Russia, and the victory of fascism in Germany. It was supposed to explain mistaken Marxist prognoses, but without breaking Marxist intentions."</ref><ref>Dubiel, Helmut. 1985. ''Theory and Politics: Studies in the Development of Critical Theory'', translated by B. Gregg. Cambridge, MA.</ref>

For Adorno and Horkheimer, [[state intervention]] in the economy had effectively abolished the traditional tension between Marxism's "[[relations of production]]" and "material [[productive forces]]" of society. The market (as an "unconscious" mechanism for the distribution of goods) had been replaced by [[centralized planning]].<ref>''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]''. p. 38: "[G]one are the objective laws of the market which ruled in the actions of the entrepreneurs and tended toward catastrophe. Instead the conscious decision of the managing directors executes as results (which are more obligatory than the blindest price-mechanisms) the old law of value and hence the destiny of capitalism." </ref>

Contrary to Marx's prediction in the ''[[Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy|Preface to a Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'', this shift did not lead to "an era of [[social revolution]]" but to [[fascism]] and [[totalitarianism]]. As such, critical theory was left, in Habermas's words, without "anything in reserve to which it might appeal, and when the forces of production enter into a baneful symbiosis with the relations of production that they were supposed to blow wide open, there is no longer any dynamism upon which critique could base its hope."<ref>"The Entwinement of Myth and Enlightenment," p. 118.</ref> For Adorno and Horkheimer, this posed the problem of how to account for the apparent persistence of domination in the absence of the very contradiction that, according to traditional critical theory, was the source of domination itself.

=== Habermas ===
In the 1960s, Habermas, a proponent of '''critical social theory'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->,<ref>[[George Katsiaficas|Katsiaficas, George N.]], Robert George Kirkpatrick, and Mary Lou Emery. 1987. ''Introduction to Critical Sociology''. Irvington Publishers. p. 26.</ref> raised the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] discussion to a new level in his ''[[Knowledge and Human Interests]]'' (1968), by identifying critical [[knowledge]] as based on principles that differentiated it either from the [[natural sciences]] or the [[humanities]], through its orientation to [[self-reflection]] and emancipation.<ref>Laurie, Timothy, Hannah Stark, and Briohny Walker. 2019. "[https://www.academia.edu/38122177 Critical Approaches to Continental Philosophy: Intellectual Community, Disciplinary Identity, and the Politics of Inclusion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211120909/https://www.academia.edu/38122177 |date=11 December 2019 }}." ''[[Parrhesia (journal)|Parrhesia]]'' 30:1–17. {{Doi|10.1007/s10691-011-9167-4}}. (Discusses critical social theory as a form of self-reflection.)</ref> Although unsatisfied with Adorno and Horkheimer's thought in ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'', Habermas shares the view that, in the form of [[instrumental rationality]], the era of [[modernity]] marks a move away from the liberation of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and toward a new form of enslavement.<ref name="Outhwaite, William 1988. pp. 5-8" />{{Rp|6}} In Habermas's work, critical theory transcended its theoretical roots in [[German idealism]], and progressed closer to [[Pragmatism|American pragmatism]].

Habermas's ideas about the relationship between modernity and [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] are in this sense strongly influenced by [[Max Weber]]. He further dissolved the elements of critical theory derived from [[Hegelian]] [[German Idealism]], though his epistemology remains broadly Marxist. Perhaps his two most influential ideas are the concepts of the [[public sphere]] and [[communicative action]], the latter arriving partly as a reaction to new [[post-structural]] or so-called "[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]" challenges to the discourse of modernity. Habermas engaged in regular correspondence with [[Richard Rorty]], and a strong sense of philosophical [[pragmatism]] may be felt in his thought, which frequently traverses the boundaries between sociology and philosophy.

==In academia==
===Postmodern critical social theory===
Focusing on [[language]], symbolism, communication, and [[social construction]], critical theory has been applied in the social sciences as a critique of social construction and [[Postmodernity|postmodern society]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Agger|first=Ben|title=North American Critical Theory After Postmodernism|date=2012|pages=128–154|chapter=Ben Agger|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|doi=10.1057/9781137262868_7|isbn=9781349350391}}</ref>

While [[modernist]] critical theory (as described above) concerns itself with "forms of authority and injustice that accompanied the evolution of industrial and [[corporate capitalism]] as a [[Political economy|political-economic]] system", [[postmodern]] critical theory politicizes social problems "by situating them in historical and cultural contexts, to implicate themselves in the process of collecting and analyzing data, and to relativize their findings."<ref name="LINDTAYLOR">{{cite book|last1=Lindlof|first1=Thomas R.|last2=Taylor|first2=Bryan C.|title=Qualitative Communication Research Methods|date=2002|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761924944|page=[https://archive.org/details/qualitativecommu00lind/page/49 49]|url=https://archive.org/details/qualitativecommu00lind|url-access=registration|quote=forms of authority and injustice that accompanied the evolution of industrial and corporate capitalism as a political-economic system.|language=en}}</ref> Meaning itself is seen as unstable due to social structures' rapid transformation. As a result, research focuses on local manifestations rather than broad generalizations.

Postmodern critical research is also characterized by the ''crisis of representation'', which rejects the idea that a researcher's work is an "objective depiction of a stable other." Instead, many postmodern scholars have adopted "alternatives that encourage reflection about the 'politics and poetics' of their work. In these accounts, the embodied, collaborative, dialogic, and improvisational aspects of qualitative research are clarified."<ref>Lindlof & Taylor, 2002, p.&nbsp;53</ref>

The term ''critical theory'' is often [[Appropriation of knowledge|appropriated]] when an author works in [[Sociology|sociological]] terms, yet attacks the social or human sciences, thus attempting to remain "outside" those frames of inquiry. [[Michel Foucault]] has been described as one such author.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rivera Vicencio|first1=E.|title=Foucault: His influence over accounting and management research.

====Communication studies====
From the 1960s and 1970s onward, language, symbolism, text, and meaning came to be seen as the theoretical foundation for the [[humanities]], through the influence of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and other thinkers in [[Linguistic philosophy|linguistic]] and [[analytic philosophy]], [[structural linguistics]], [[symbolic interactionism]], [[hermeneutics]], [[semiology]], linguistically oriented [[psychoanalysis]] ([[Jacques Lacan]], [[Alfred Lorenzer]]), and [[deconstruction]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

When, in the 1970s and 1980s, Habermas redefined ''critical social theory'' as a [[Communication studies|study of communication]], with communicative competence and [[communicative rationality]] on the one hand, and distorted communication on the other, the two versions of critical theory began to overlap to a much greater degree than before.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Pedagogy===
Critical theorists have widely credited [[Paulo Freire]] for the first applications of critical theory to education/[[pedagogy]], considering his best-known work to be ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'', a seminal text in what is now known as the philosophy and social movement of ''[[critical pedagogy]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-07-09|title=Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed : Book Summary|url=http://www.theeducationist.info/paulo-freires-pedagogy-oppressed-book-summary/|access-date=2020-06-04|website=The Educationist|language=en-US|archive-date=28 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328154753/http://www.theeducationist.info/paulo-freires-pedagogy-oppressed-book-summary|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>For a history of the emergence of critical theory in the field of education, see Gottesman, Isaac. 2016. ''The Critical Turn in Education: From Marxist Critique to Postructuralist Feminism to Critical Theories of Race''. New York: [[Routledge]].</ref> Dedicated to the oppressed and based on his own experience helping Brazilian adults learn to read and write, Freire includes a detailed [[Marxist analysis|Marxist]] [[class analysis]] in his exploration of the relationship between the colonizer and the colonized.  In the book, he calls traditional pedagogy the "[[banking model of education]]", because it treats the student as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge. He argues that pedagogy should instead treat the learner as a co-creator of knowledge.

In contrast to the banking model, the teacher in the critical-theory model is not the dispenser of all knowledge, but a participant who learns with and from the students—in conversation with them, even as they learn from the teacher. The goal is to liberate the learner from an oppressive construct of teacher versus student, a dichotomy analogous to colonizer and colonized. It is not enough for the student to analyze societal power structures and hierarchies, to merely recognize imbalance and inequity; critical theory pedagogy must also empower the learner to reflect and act on that reflection to challenge an oppressive status quo.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014-07-09|title=Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed : Book Summary|url=http://www.theeducationist.info/paulo-freires-pedagogy-oppressed-book-summary/|access-date=2020-06-04|website=The Educationist|language=en-US|archive-date=28 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328154753/http://www.theeducationist.info/paulo-freires-pedagogy-oppressed-book-summary|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Criticism==
While critical theorists have often been called Marxist intellectuals,<ref name="Kołakowski">See, e.g., [[Leszek Kołakowski|Kołakowski, Leszek]]. [1976] 1979. ''[[Main Currents of Marxism]]'' 3. W. W. Norton & Company. {{ISBN|0393329437}}. ch. 10.</ref> their tendency to denounce some Marxist concepts and to combine Marxian analysis with other sociological and philosophical traditions has resulted in accusations of [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]] by [[Classical Marxism|classical]], [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox]], and [[Analytical Marxism|analytical]] Marxists, and by [[Marxist–Leninist]] philosophers. [[Martin Jay]] has said that the first generation of critical theory is best understood not as promoting a specific philosophical agenda or ideology, but as "a [[Social gadfly|gadfly]] of other systems."<ref name="Martin Jay">{{Cite book|last=Jay|first=Martin|date=1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwkzVdaaB2sC&pg=PA41|title=The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research, 1923–1950|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20423-2|page=41|access-date=7 May 2020|archive-date=28 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201028061218/https://books.google.com/books?id=nwkzVdaaB2sC&pg=PA41|url-status=live}}</ref>

Critical theory has been criticized for not offering any clear road map to political action ([[Praxis_(process)#Marxism|praxis]]), often explicitly repudiating any solutions (as with Marcuse's "Great Refusal", which promoted abstaining from engaging in active political change).<ref>Corradetti, Claudio. "[https://www.iep.utm.edu/frankfur/#SH2a The Frankfurt School and Critical Theory] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218090424/https://www.iep.utm.edu/frankfur/#SH2a |date=18 February 2018 }}." ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.</ref>

A primary criticism of the theory is that it is anti-scientific, both for its lack of the use of the scientific method, and for its overt criticism of science as a tool used for oppression of marginalized groups of people.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-02-12|title=How Critical Theory Came to Be Skeptical of Science|url=https://areomagazine.com/2020/02/12/how-critical-theory-came-to-be-skeptical-of-science/|access-date=2020-07-29|website=Areo|language=en-US|archive-date=10 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200610030809/https://areomagazine.com/2020/02/12/how-critical-theory-came-to-be-skeptical-of-science/|url-status=live}}</ref>
