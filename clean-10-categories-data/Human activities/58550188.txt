{{Short description|Work done underwater during diving operations}}
'''Underwater work''' is work done underwater, generally by divers during [[Underwater diving|diving operations]], but includes work done underwater by remotely operated vehicles and manned submersibles.

*Use of a guideline or jackstay

===Underwater searches===
{{main|Underwater searches}}
Underwater searches are procedures to find a known or suspected target object or objects in a specified search area under water. They may be carried out underwater by divers, manned [[submersibles]], [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s, or [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s, or from the surface by other agents, including surface vessels, aircraft and [[cadaver dogs]].

A search method attempts to provide full coverage of the search area. This is greatly influenced by the width of the sweep which largely depends on the method used to detect the target. For divers in conditions of zero visibility this is as far as the diver can feel with his hands while proceeding along the pattern. When visibility is better, it depends on the distance at which the target can be seen from the pattern, or detected by sonar or magnetic field anomalies. In all cases the search pattern should completely cover the search area without excessive redundancy or missed areas. Overlap is needed to compensate for inaccuracy and sensor error, and may be necessary to avoid gaps in some patterns.

===Inspection, measuring and recording===
