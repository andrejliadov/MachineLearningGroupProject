'''Anarcho-punk''' (or '''anarchist punk''')<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/style/anarchist-punk-ma0000011967 Anarchist Punk | Music Highlights | AllMusic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is [[punk rock]] that promotes [[anarchism]]. Some use the term broadly to refer to any punk music with anarchist lyrical content, which may figure in [[crust punk]], [[hardcore punk]], [[folk punk]], and other styles.
==History==
[[Image:Crass pete steve andy.png|300px|thumb|[[Crass]], shown here in 1984, played a major role in introducing anarchism to the punk subculture.]]

===Before  1977===
Some [[protopunk]] bands of the late 1960s had anarchist members, such as the German blues-rock band [[Ton Steine Scherben]] and English bands connected to the [[UK underground]], such as [[Hawkwind]], [[Pink Fairies]], [[The Deviants (band)|The Deviants]] and the [[Edgar Broughton Band]]. These bands, along with Detroit's [[MC5]], set a precedent for mixing radical politics with rock music and established the idea of rock as an agent of social and political change in the public consciousness. Other precursors to anarcho-punk include avant-garde art and political movements such as [[Fluxus]], [[Dada]], the [[Beat generation]], England's [[angry young men]] (such as [[Joe Orton]]), the [[surrealism]]-inspired [[Situationist International]], the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] uprising in Paris, and the [[CND]]. [[Jello Biafra]] of the [[Dead Kennedys]] has cited the [[Youth International Party|Yippies]] as an influence on his activism and thinking.<ref>Vander Molen, Jodi, [http://www.progressive.org/mag_intvbiafra Jello Biafra Interview], ''[[The Progressive]]'' (Feb. 2002)</ref><ref>Colurso, Mary (2007-06-29) [http://blog.al.com/mcolurso/2007/06/jello_biafra_can_ruffle_feathe.html Jello Biafra can ruffle feathers], ''[[The Birmingham News]]''</ref>

===Post 1977===
A surge of popular interest in [[anarchism]] occurred during the 1970s in the [[United Kingdom]] following the birth of [[punk rock]], in particular the [[Situationist International|Situationist]]-influenced graphics of [[Sex Pistols]] artist [[Jamie Reid]], as well as that band's first single, "[[Anarchy in the U.K.]]".<ref>Cross, Rich.

Retrieved on 15 March 2020.</ref> However, while the early punk scene appropriated anarchist imagery mainly for its shock or comedy value or at best as a desire for hedonist personal freedom,<ref name="nosir">{{cite web|last=Dines|first=Mike|title=No Sir, I Won't: Reconsidering the Legacy of Crass and Anarcho-punk|url=https://www.academia.edu/3023089|publisher=Academia.edu|access-date=May 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Savage|first=Jon|title=England's Dreaming, Revised Edition: Anarchy, Sex Pistols, Punk Rock, and Beyond|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=2002|page=204|isbn=978-0312288228}}</ref> [[Crass]] along with neighbours [[Poison Girls]] may have been the first punk bands to expound serious anarchist ideas.<ref name="nosir"/> Crass and the Poison Girls funded the rented [[Wapping Autonomy Centre]] with a benefit single and this then inspired other squatted [[self-managed social centre]]s in London such as the Ambulance Station on Old Kent Road, [[Centro Iberico]], Molly's Café on Upper Street and the Bingo Hall opposite [[Highbury & Islington]] station (now the [[The Garage, London|Garage]]).<ref name="bergcentres">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=George|title=The story of Crass|publisher=London: Omnibus Press|year=2006|page=193|isbn=1-84609-402-X}}</ref> The concept (and aesthetics) of anarcho-punk was quickly picked up on by bands like [[Flux of Pink Indians]], [[Subhumans (UK band)|Subhumans]] and [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]].<ref name="berger">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=George|title=The story of Crass|publisher=London: Omnibus Press|year=2006|pages=67–68|isbn=1-84609-402-X}}</ref>

The early-1980s saw the emergence of the [[Leeds]] anarcho punk scene with groups like [[Abrasive Wheels]], [[The Expelled]] and [[Icon A.D.]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Glasper |first1=Ian |title=Burning Britain: The History of UK Punk 1980–1984 |pages=165}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ABRASIVE WHEELS |url=https://nostalgiacentral.com/music/artists-a-to-k/artists-a/abrasive-wheels/ |access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Glasper |first1=Ian |title=The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980–1984 |pages=385}}</ref> From this scene came [[Chumbawamba]], whose emphasise on confrontational political activism soon overtook their connection to the scene. Despite their anti-corporate views, the group signed to [[EMI]], leading to their  1997 single [[Tubthumping]] number 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="The City Talking">{{cite AV media |title=Music in Leeds vol.3 |url=https://the-dots.com/projects/music-in-leeds-vol-i-iii-170479 |access-date=7 March 2020 |publisher=The City Talking}}</ref>

Pioneering [[crust punk]] bands [[Antisect]], [[Anti System]], [[Sacrilege (band)|Sacrilege]] and [[Amebix]] all began in the anarcho punk scene, before incorporating their anarchist lyrical themes with elements of early [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].<ref name="Rise of Crust">{{cite web|last=Von Havoc |first=Felix |title=Rise of Crust |publisher=Profane Existence |date=1984-01-01 |url=http://www.havocrex.com/press/article/3/83 |access-date=2008-06-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615163312/http://www.havocrex.com/press/article/3/83 |archive-date=2008-06-15 }}</ref> Early British [[grindcore]] bands like [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]], [[Napalm Death]] and [[Extreme Noise Terror]] were primarily a part of the 1980s anarcho punk scene, however began embracing elements of [[extreme metal]] and American [[thrashcore]].<ref name="Glasper 2009, p. 11">Glasper 2009, p. 11</ref>

==Ideology==
{{Anarchism sidebar |Culture}}
Anarcho-punk bands often disassociated themselves from established anarchist currents like [[collectivist anarchism]], [[anarcho syndicalism]] or [[anarcho communism]]. Because of this, as well as their emphasis on [[pacifism]], the scene was generally independent of the wider anarchist movement at the time. Bands generally supported [[animal rights]], [[anti-corporate activism|anti-corporatism]], [[labor rights]] and the [[anti-war]] movement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=CROSS |first1=RICH |title="There Is No Authority But Yourself ": The Individual and the Collective in British Anarcho-Punk |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/mp/9460447.0004.203/--there-is-no-authority-but-yourself-the-individual?rgn=main;view=fulltext |access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref>

Anarcho-punks have criticized the flaws of the [[punk subculture|punk movement]] and the wider youth culture. Bands like [[Crass]] and [[Dead Kennedys]] have written songs that attack corporate co-option of the punk subculture, people who are deemed to have [[sold out]], and the violence between punks, [[skinhead]]s, [[breakdancing|B-boys]], other youth subcultures,<ref name="berger"/><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|title=...In Which Crass Voluntarily Blow Their Own... |url=http://blog.southern.com/about-crass-records/ |publisher=[[Southern Records]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023025044/http://blog.southern.com/about-crass-records/ |archive-date=2014-10-23 }}</ref> and within punk itself. Some anarcho-punks are [[straight edge]], claiming that [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], drugs and promiscuity are instruments of oppression and are self-destructive because they cloud the mind and wear down a person's resistance to other types of oppression. Some also condemn the waste of land, water and resources necessary to grow crops to make alcohol, tobacco and drugs, forfeiting the potential to grow and manufacture food. Some may be straight edge for religious reasons, such as in the case of [[Christian anarchists|Christian]], [[Islam and anarchism|Muslim]], and [[Buddhist anarchism|Buddhist]] anarcho-punks (see [[Anarchism and religion]] for more background).

Although Crass initially espoused [[pacifism]], this is not necessarily the case for all anarcho-punks. Despite the broader punk subculture's antagonism towards hippies, the ideals of the hippie counterculture were an influence on anarcho-punk. Crass were explicit regarding their associations with the hippie counterculture,<ref name="berger" /><ref name="autogenerated1" /> and this influence has also carried over to crust punk.

===Direct action===
Anarcho-punks universally believe in [[direct action]], although the way in which this manifests itself varies greatly. Despite their differences in strategy, anarcho-punks often co-operate with each other. Many anarcho-punks are [[pacifism|pacifists]] (e.g. Crass and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include [[nonviolent resistance]], [[refusal of work]], [[squatting]], economic [[sabotage]], [[dumpster diving]], [[graffiti]], [[culture jamming]], [[ecotage]], [[freeganism]], [[boycott]]ing, [[civil disobedience]], [[hacktivism]] and [[subvertising]]. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]). This manifests itself as [[riot]]ing, [[vandalism]], wire cutting, [[Hunt saboteur|hunt sabotage]], participation in [[Animal Liberation Front]], [[Earth Liberation Front]], or even [[Black Bloc]] style activities, and in extreme cases, bombings. Many anarchists dispute the applicability of the term "violence" to describe destruction of property, since they argue that destruction of property is done not to control an individual or institution but to take its control away.<ref>{{cite web|title=César Chavez on the Pragmatics of Violence|url=http://www.american-philosophy.org/archives/past_conference_programs/pc2004/submissions/tp-2.htm|publisher=Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy (SAAP)|access-date=May 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023055608/http://www.american-philosophy.org/archives/past_conference_programs/pc2004/submissions/tp-2.htm|archive-date=October 23, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Fringe anarchists in middle of violent demonstrations|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64114222.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629103332/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64114222.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 29, 2013|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|access-date=May 29, 2013}}</ref>

===DIY punk ethic===
Many anarcho-punk bands subscribe to a [[DIY ethic|''do-it-yourself'' ethic]]. A popular anarcho-punk slogan is "[[Do it yourself|DIY]] not [[EMI]]", a conscious rejection of a major record company.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Maximum Rocknroll | issue = 255 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFNbAAAAMAAJ&q=%22DIY+not+EMI%22 | pages = 14 | year = 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title=Peace News for Nonviolent Revolution|issue=2236–2259|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FNREAQAAIAAJ&q=%22DIY+not+EMI%22|page=liv|year=1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DIY (not EMI) in 2010|url=http://theefaction.wordpress.com/2010/09/05/diy-not-emi-in-2010/|publisher=Thee Faction|access-date=May 29, 2013}}</ref> Many anarcho-punk bands were showcased on the ''[[Bullshit Detector]]'' series of LPs released by [[Crass Records]] and Resistance Productions between 1980 and 1994. Some anarcho-punk performers were part of the [[cassette culture]]. This allowed artists to bypass the traditional recording and distribution routes, with recordings often being made available in exchange for a blank tape and a self-addressed envelope. The anarcho-punk movement has its own network of [[fanzine]]s or [[punk zine]]s which disseminate news, ideas and artwork from the scene. These are DIY productions, tending to be produced in runs of hundreds at most. The zines are printed on [[photocopier]]s or duplicator machines, and distributed by hand at punk concerts, in radical bookstores and infoshops, and through the mail.

==Musical style and aesthetics==
Anarcho-punk bands are often less focused on particular musical delivery and more focused on a totalized aesthetic that encompasses the entire creative process, from album and concert art, to political message, and to the lifestyles of the band members.<ref name="allmusic">[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d11374|pure_url=yes}} allmusic<!-- Bot generated title -->] quotation: {{quotation|...its ideology of personal freedom (musical self-expression ought to be available to anyone, regardless of technical ability), and also that the message tended to be more important than the music.}}</ref> Crass listed as band members the people who did their album art and live visuals. The message is considered to be more important than the music.<ref name="berger" /><ref name="allmusic"/> According to the punk aesthetic, one can express oneself and produce moving and serious works with limited means and technical ability.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="Byrne2010">[[David Byrne]], Jeremy Deller (2010) [http://www.davidbyrne.com/news/press/articles/modernpainters_2010.php ''Audio Games''], in ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'', March 1, 2010 quotation: {{quotation|I think I embrace a bit of the punk aesthetic that one can express oneself with two chords if that’s all you know, and likewise one can make a great film with limited means or skills or clothes or furniture. It’s just as moving and serious as works that employ great skill and craft sometimes. Granted, when you learn that third chord, or more, you don’t have to continue making "simple" things, unless you want to. Sometimes that’s a problem.}}</ref> It is not uncommon for anarcho-punk songs to lack the usual rock structure of verses and a chorus, however, there are exceptions to this. For example, later [[Chumbawamba]] songs were at the same time anarcho-punk and pop-oriented.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Chumbawamba's Long Voyage|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/07/chumbawambas-long-voyage/|magazine=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]}}</ref>

Bands such as Crass, Conflict, [[Nausea (band)|Nausea]] and Chumbawamba make use of both male and female vocalists.<ref name="Larkin80">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2003|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-969-9|pages=124/5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Griffin |first1=Joh |title=Nausea Biography by John Griffin |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/nausea-mn0000318559/biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=16 April 2020}}</ref><ref name="The City Talking" /><ref>Rimbaud, P; "...EXIT – 'The Mystic Trumpeter, Live at the Roundhouse 1972'" accompanying booklet, Exitstencil Recordings 2013</ref>
