A '''lawn''' is an area of soil-covered land planted with [[Poaceae|grass]]es and other durable plants such as [[clover]] which are maintained at a short height with a [[lawnmower]] (or sometimes grazing animals) and used for aesthetic and recreational purposes. Lawns are usually composed only of grass species, subject to [[weed control|weed]] and [[pest control]], maintained in a green color (e.g., by [[Irrigation|watering]]), and are regularly mowed to ensure an acceptable length.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKc5DQAAQBAJ|title=Encyclopedia of Urban Studies|date=2010|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412914321|pages=441–45|language=en}}</ref> Lawns are used around houses, apartments, commercial buildings and offices. Many city parks also have large lawn areas. In recreational contexts, the specialised names '''turf''', '''pitch''', '''field''' or '''green''' may be used, depending on the sport and the continent.

The term "lawn", referring to a managed grass space, dates to no earlier than the 16th century. Tied to [[suburban]] expansion and the creation of the household aesthetic, the lawn is an important aspect of the interaction between the natural environment and the constructed urban and suburban space.<ref name="Robbins">Robbins, Paul.

In many{{clarify | probably a national / regional issue? US-only? Aus?  Probably not UK?|date=November 2018}} suburban areas, there are bylaws in place requiring houses to have lawns and requiring the proper maintenance of these lawns. In some jurisdictions where there are water shortages, local government authorities are encouraging alternatives to lawns to reduce water use.

==Etymology==
Lawn is a [[cognate]] of ''[[Llan (placename element)|llan]]'' which is derived from the [[Common Brittonic]] word ''landa'' ({{lang-fro|lande}}) that originally means heath, barren land, or clearing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=lawn&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date=10 June 1927 |access-date=11 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=laund|work=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/106277|access-date=27 March 2013}}</ref>

===Origins===
[[File:Vaux-le-Vicomte Garten.jpg|thumb|Gardens of the [[Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte]], designed by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Maincy]].]]

Lawns may have originated as grassed enclosures within early medieval settlements used for communal grazing of [[livestock]], as distinct from [[Field (agriculture)|fields]] reserved for agriculture. The word "laune" is first attested in 1540,<ref>{{cite web|title=Etymology for "lawn"|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=lawn&searchmode=none|publisher=[[Etymonline]]|access-date=5 June 2015}}</ref> and is likely related to the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] word ''[[Llan (placename element)|lan/llan/laun]]'', which has the meaning of enclosure, often in relation to a place of worship.

In medieval Europe, open expanses of low grasses <ref>{{cite web|title=All You Need to Know About Lawn History|url=https://www.thelawninstitute.org/pages/education/lawn-history/lawns-and-lawn-history/|website=www.thelawninstitute.org|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref> became valued among the aristocracy because they allowed those inside an enclosed fence or castle to view those approaching.

Lawns became popular with the [[aristocracy]] in northern [[Europe]] from the [[Middle Ages]] onward. The early lawns were not always distinguishable from [[pasture]] fields. The damp climate of maritime Western Europe in the north made lawns possible to grow and manage. They were not a part of gardens in other regions and cultures of the world until contemporary influence.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hostetler |first=Mark E. |date=2012 |title=The Green Leap: A Primer for Conserving Biodiversity in Subdivision Development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJuDZEtKFCcC&q=lawns+western+europe+history&pg=PA91 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520271104 |language=en}}</ref>

Before the invention of [[lawn mower|mowing machines]] in 1830, lawns were managed very differently. They were an element of wealthy estates and [[manor house]]s, and in some places were maintained by the labor-intensive methods of [[Scythe|scything]] and shearing. In most situations, they were also pasture land maintained through grazing by [[sheep]] or other [[livestock]]. Areas of grass grazed regularly by [[rabbit]]s, [[horse]]s or [[sheep]] over a long period often form a very low, tight sward similar to a modern lawn. This was the original meaning of the word "lawn" care, and the term can still be found in place names. Some forest areas where extensive [[grazing]] is practiced still have these seminatural lawns. For example, in the [[New Forest]], [[England]], such grazed areas are common, and are known as lawns, for example [[Balmer Lawn]]. Lawns similar to those of today first appeared in France and England in the 1700s when [[André Le Nôtre]] designed the gardens of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] that included a small area of grass called the ''{{lang|fr|tapis vert}}'', or "green carpet".

===The English lawn===
[[Image:BadmintonMorris edited.jpg|thumb|[[Capability Brown]]'s landscape design at [[Badminton House]].]]

It was not until the 17th and 18th century that the garden and the lawn became a place created first as walkways and social areas. They were made up of meadow plants, such as [[Chamomile|camomile]], a particular favorite. In the early 17th century, the [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] epoch of gardening began; during this period, the closely cut "English" lawn was born. By the end of this period, the English lawn was a symbol of status of the [[aristocracy]] and [[gentry]]; it showed that the owner could afford to keep land that was not being used for a building, or for food production.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In the early 18th century, landscape gardening for the [[aristocracy]] entered a golden age, under the direction of [[William Kent]] and [[Capability Brown|Lancelot "Capability" Brown]]. They refined the [[English landscape garden]] style with the design of natural, or "romantic", estate settings for wealthy Englishmen.<ref name="Lancelot">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/81572/Lancelot-Brown?anchor=ref45555 |title=Lancelot Brown |year=2007 |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc |access-date=12 March 2012}}</ref> Brown, remembered as "England's greatest gardener", designed over 170 parks, many of which still endure. His influence was so great that the contributions to the English garden made by his predecessors [[Charles Bridgeman]] and [[William Kent]] are often overlooked.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Horace |last1=Walpole |author-link=Horace Walpole |location=Canton, Pa. |publisher=Kirgate Press |url=https://archive.org/details/essayonmodernga00walpgoog |title=On Modern Gardening |orig-year=1780 |year=1905}} at [[Internet Archive]]</ref>

His work still endures at [[Croome Park|Croome Court]] (where he also designed the house), [[Blenheim Palace]], [[Warwick Castle]], [[Harewood House]], [[Bowood House]], [[Milton Abbey]] (and nearby [[Milton Abbas]] village), in traces at [[Kew Gardens]] and many other locations.<ref name="kew">{{cite web|url=http://www.kew.org/heritage/people/brown.html |title=Lancelot 'Capability' Brown (1716–1783) |work=Kew History & Heritage |publisher=Kew Gardens |access-date=16 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008111550/http://www.kew.org/heritage/people/brown.html |archive-date= 8 October 2012 }}</ref> His style of smooth undulating lawns which ran seamlessly to the house and meadow, clumps, belts and scattering of trees and his serpentine lakes formed by invisibly damming small rivers, were a new style within the English landscape, a "gardenless" form of landscape gardening, which swept away almost all the remnants of previous formally patterned styles. His landscapes were fundamentally different from what they replaced, the well-known formal gardens of England which were criticised by [[Alexander Pope]] and others from the 1710s.<ref>Peter Willis, "Capability Brown in Northumberland" ''Garden History'' '''9'''.2 (Autumn, 1981, pp. 157–183)</ref>

[[File:János Rombauer - English Garden in the Csáky Castle at Hotkóc - WGA20009.jpg|thumb|left|1803 painting of the main elements of the English landscape garden.]]
The open "English style" of parkland first spread across Britain and Ireland, and then across Europe, such as the [[garden à la française|garden ''à la française'']] being replaced by the [[French landscape garden]]. By this time, the word "lawn" in England had semantically shifted to describe a piece of a garden covered with grass and closely mown.<ref name="Jenkins" /> Wealthy families in America during the late 18th century also began mimicking English landscaping styles. In 1780, the [[Shaker]] community began the first industrial production of high-quality grass seed in North America, and a number of seed companies and nurseries were founded in [[Philadelphia]]. The increased availability of these grasses meant they were in plentiful supply for parks and residential areas, not just livestock.<ref name="Jenkins" />

[[Thomas Jefferson]] has long been given credit for being the first person to attempt an English-style lawn at his estate, [[Monticello]], in 1806, but many others had tried to emulate English landscaping before he did. Over time, an increasing number towns in [[New England]] began to emphasize grass spaces. Many scholars link this development to the romantic and transcendentalist movements of the 19th century. These green commons were also heavily associated with the success of the Revolutionary War and often became the homes of patriotic war memorials after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended in 1865.<ref name="Jenkins" />

===Middle class pursuit===
[[File:Kirby Fleetham Hall, Yorkshire, UK, lawn, 1889.jpg|thumbnail|The lawn at [[Kirkby Fleetham]] Hall, Yorkshire, England, circa 1889.]]
Before the mechanical lawnmower, the upkeep of lawns was possible only for the extremely wealthy estates and [[manor house]]s of the aristocracy. Labor-intensive methods of [[Scythe|scything]] and shearing the grass were required to maintain the lawn in its correct state, and most of the land in England was required for more functional, [[agriculture|agricultural]] purposes.

This all changed with the invention of the lawnmower by [[Edwin Beard Budding]] in 1830.
Budding had the idea for a lawnmower after seeing a machine in a local cloth mill which used a cutting cylinder (or bladed reel) mounted on a bench to trim the irregular nap from the surface of woollen cloth and give a smooth finish.<ref>{{cite web|title = History of British Gardening Series - Georgian and Regency era | publisher= BBC |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/design/nonflash_georgianregency4.shtml |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100216212228/http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/design/nonflash_georgianregency4.shtml |url-status = dead |archive-date = 2010-02-16 | access-date = 2018-11-09}}</ref> Budding realised that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism was mounted in a wheeled frame to make the blades rotate close to the lawn's surface. His mower design was to be used primarily to cut the lawn on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the [[scythe]], and he was granted a British patent on 31 August 1830.<ref>{{cite patent|inventor-last=Passmore|inventor-first=Everett G.|date=23 February 1869|issue-date=28 January 1879|title=Improvement in Lawn-Mowers|country-code=US|description=RE|patent-number=8560}}; see pg 1, col 2. For a copy, see [http://www.google.com/patents?id=tS4gAAAAEBAJ&zoom=4&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false Google Patents copy]. This source indicates the patent number as "6,080". According to "[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-about/p-whatis/p-oldnumbers/p-oldnumbers-1617.htm British patent numbers 1617 - 1852 (old series)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017021941/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/patent/p-about/p-whatis/p-oldnumbers/p-oldnumbers-1617.htm |date=17 October 2011 }}", the patent number was assigned sometime after 1852 and took the form of "6080/1830".</ref>

Budding went into partnership with a local engineer, John Ferrabee, who paid the costs of development and acquired rights to manufacture and sell lawn mowers and to [[license]] other manufacturers.  Together they made mowers in a factory at [[Brimscombe and Thrupp|Thrupp]] near Stroud.<ref>{{cite web|title=People at the cutting edge: lawnmower designers|publisher=Parks & Gardens UK ([[University of York]]/Association of Gardens Trusts)|url=http://www.parksandgardens.ac.uk/274/explore-31/historical-profiles-176/people-at-the-cutting-edge%3a-lawnmower-designers-483.html|access-date=24 May 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226090458/http://www.parksandgardens.ac.uk/274/explore-31/historical-profiles-176/people-at-the-cutting-edge%3A-lawnmower-designers-483.html|archive-date=26 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Among the other companies manufacturing under license the most successful was [[Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies]] of Ipswich which began mower production as early as 1832.<ref name="oldlawnmowerclub1"/>

[[File:Ransomes00.gif|Lawnmower advert|thumb|left|The first [[Petrol engine|petrol-powered]] lawnmower, 1902.]]
However, his model had two crucial drawbacks. It was immensely heavy (it was made of [[cast iron]]) and difficult to manoeuvre in the garden, and did not cut the grass very well. The blade would often spin above the grass uselessly.<ref name="oldlawnmowerclub1">{{cite web|author=The Old Lawnmower Club|url=http://www.oldlawnmowerclub.co.uk/mowinfo/mowhist.htm|title=Mower History|publisher=The Old Lawnmower Club|access-date=23 April 2011}}</ref> It took ten more years and further innovations, including the advent of the [[Bessemer process]] for the production of the much lighter alloy [[steel]] and advances in motorization such as the [[drive chain]], for the lawnmower to become a practical proposition. Middle-class families across the country, in imitation of aristocratic landscape gardens, began to grow finely trimmed lawns in their back gardens.

In the 1850s, [[Thomas Green & Son|Thomas Green]] of [[Leeds]] introduced a revolutionary mower design called the Silens Messor (meaning silent cutter), which used a chain to transmit power from the rear roller to the cutting cylinder. The machine was much lighter and quieter than the gear driven machines that preceded them, and won first prize at the first lawn mower trial at the London Horticultural Gardens.<ref name="oldlawnmowerclub1"/> Thus began a great expansion in the lawn mower production in the 1860s. [[Leyland Steam Motor Company|James Sumner]] of [[Lancashire]] patented the first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] lawn mower in 1893.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thelawnmower.info/history.php |title=The History of the LawnMower |publisher=Thelawnmower.info |access-date=23 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722001018/http://thelawnmower.info/history.php |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Around 1900, [[Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies|Ransomes]]' Automaton, available in chain- or gear-driven models, dominated the British market. In 1902, Ransomes produced the first commercially available mower powered by an internal combustion gasoline engine. JP Engineering of Leicester, founded after [[World War I]], invented the first riding mowers.

[[File:Ransomes01.jpg|Lawnmower advert|thumb|From the 19th century, the cultivation of lawns, especially for sports, became a middle-class obsession in England. Pictured, a lawnmower advertisement from [[Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies|Ransomes]].]]
This went hand-in-hand with a booming consumer market for lawns from the 1860s onward. With the increasing popularity of [[sports]] in the mid-Victorian period, the lawn mower was used to craft modern-style sporting ovals, playing fields, pitches and grass courts for the nascent sports of [[football]], [[lawn bowls]], [[tennis|lawn tennis]] and others.<ref>Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.</ref> The rise of [[Suburb]]anisation in the [[interwar period]] was heavily influenced by the [[garden city movement]] of [[Ebenezer Howard]] and the creation of the first [[garden suburb]]s at the turn of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The suburban aspiration in England since 1919 | doi=10.1080/13619460008581576 | volume=14|journal=Contemporary British History|pages=151–174|year = 2000|last1 = Clapson|first1 = Mark| s2cid=143590157 }}</ref> The garden suburb, developed through the efforts of [[social reform]]er [[Henrietta Barnett]] and her husband, exemplified the incorporation of the well manicured lawn into suburban life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hgstrust.org/history/index.html |title=Henrietta Barnett and the Beginnings of the Suburb |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206232730/http://hgstrust.org/history/index.html |archive-date= 6 December 2013 }}</ref> Suburbs dramatically increased in size.

Lawns began to proliferate in America from the 1870s onwards. As more plants were introduced from Europe, lawns became smaller as they were filled with [[Cottage garden|flower beds]], [[perennial]]s, sculptures, and water features.<ref name="Steinberg" /> Eventually the wealthy began to move away from the cities into new suburban communities. In 1856, an architectural book was published to accompany the development of the new suburbia that placed importance on the availability of a grassy space for children to play on and a space to grow fruits and vegetables that further imbued the lawn with cultural importance.<ref name="Jenkins" /> Lawns began making more appearances in development plans, magazine articles, and catalogs.<ref>Influence of catalogs: See ''America’s Romance with the English Garden'' by Thomas J. Mickey, 2013. Cited at [https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/10/06/suitcase-wearing/jRAOX41Sdo7pWj6B9fanWM/story.html]</ref> The lawn became less associated with being a [[status symbol]], instead giving way to a landscape aesthetic. Improvements in the lawn mower and water supply enabled the spread of lawn culture from the [[New England|Northeast]] to the [[American South|South]] where the grass grew more poorly.<ref name="Jenkins" /> This in combination with [[Setback (land use)|setback rules]] which required all homes to have a 30-foot gap between the structure and the sidewalk meant that the lawn had found a specific place in suburbia.<ref name="Steinberg" />

Prior to European colonization, the grasses on the East Coast of North America were mostly [[Sorghum bicolor|broom straw]], [[wild rye]], and [[marsh grass]]. As Europeans moved into the region, it was noted by colonists in New England, more than others, that the grasses of the New World were inferior to those of England and that their livestock seemed to receive less nutrition from it. In fact, once livestock brought overseas from Europe spread throughout the colonies, much of the native grasses of New England disappeared, and an inventory list from the 17th century noted supplies of [[clover]] and grass seed from England. New colonists were even urged by their country and companies to bring grass seed with them to North America. By the late 17th century, a new market in imported grass seed had begun in New England.<ref name="Jenkins">Jenkins, Virginia S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DjwWCAAAQBAJ ''The Lawn: A History of an American Obsession'']. Smithsonian Institution, 1994. {{ISBN|1588345165}}</ref>

Much of the new grasses brought by Europeans spread quickly and effectively, often ahead of the colonists. One such species, Bermuda grass (''[[Cynodon dactylon]]''), became the most important pasture grass for the southern colonies.

Kentucky bluegrass (''[[Poa pratensis]]'') is a grass native to Europe or the Middle East. It was likely carried to Midwestern United States in the early 1600s by French missionaries and spread via the waterways to the region around Kentucky. However, it may also have spread across the Appalachian mountains after an introduction on the east coast. Kentucky Bluegrass is now one of the top three pasture grasses in the United States and the most desirable species of grass for lawns.

Farmers at first continued to harvest meadows and marshes composed of indigenous grasses until they became overgrazed. These areas quickly fell to erosion and were overrun with less favorable plant life. Soon, farmers began to purposefully plant new species of grass in these areas, hoping to improve the quality and quantity of hay to provide for their livestock as native species had a lower nutritive value. While Middle Eastern and Europeans species of grass did extremely well on the East Coast of North America, it was a number of grasses from the Mediterranean that dominated the Western seaboard. As cultivated grasses became valued for their nutritional benefits to livestock, farmers relied less and less on natural meadows in the more colonized areas of the country. Eventually even the grasses of the Great Plains were overrun with European species that were more durable to the grazing patterns of imported livestock.<ref name="Jenkins" />
A pivotal factor in the spread of the lawn in America was the passage of legislation in 1938 of the 40-hour [[work week]]. Until then, Americans had typically worked half days on Saturdays, leaving little time to focus on their lawns. With this legislation and the housing boom following the [[Second World War]], managed grass spaces became more commonplace.<ref name="Steinberg" /> The creation in the early 20th century of country clubs and golf courses completed the rise of lawn culture.<ref name="Jenkins" />

According to study based on satellite observations by Cristina Milesi, NASA Earth System Science, its estimates : "More surface area in the United States is devoted to lawns than to individual irrigated crops such as corn or wheat.... area, covering about 128,000 square kilometers in all".<ref name="NASA">NASA Earth Observatory,

Lawn [[monoculture]] was a reflection of more than an interest in offsetting depreciation, it propagated the homogeneity of the suburb itself. Although lawns had been a recognizable feature in English residences since the 19th century, a revolution in industrialization and monoculture of the lawn since the Second World War fundamentally changed the ecology of the lawn. Intensive suburbanization both concentrated and expanded the spread of lawn maintenance which meant increased inputs in not only [[petrochemical]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, and [[pesticide]]s, but also natural resources like water.<ref name="Robbins" /><ref name="Jenkins" /><ref name="Steinberg" />

[[File:Mr. Soukup all in a days work.jpg|thumb|A high school principal caring for the school lawn; from a 1916–1917 yearbook in [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin]].]]
Front lawns became standardized in the 1930s when, over time, specific aspects such as grass type and maintenance methods became popular. The lawn-care industry boomed, but the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and in the period prior to [[World War II]] made it difficult to maintain the cultural standards that had become heavily associated with the lawn due to grass seed shortages in Europe, America's main supplier. Still, seed distributors such as [[Scotts Miracle-Gro Company]]  in the United States encouraged families to continue to maintain their lawns, promoting it as a stress-relieving hobby. During the war itself, homeowners were asked to maintain the appearances of the home front, likely as a show of strength, morale, and solidarity. After World War II, the lawn aesthetic once again became a standard feature of North America, bouncing back from its minor decline in the decades before with a vengeance, particularly as a result of the housing and population boom post-war.<ref name="Jenkins" />

The [[VA loan]] in the United States let American ex-servicemen buy homes without providing a down payment, while the [[Federal Housing Administration]] offered lender inducements that aided the reduction of down payments for the average American from 30% to as little as 10%. These developments made owning your own home cheaper than renting, further enabling the spread of suburbia and its lawns.<ref name="Steinberg" />

[[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], New York was the beginning of the industrial suburb in the 20th Century, and by proxy the industrial lawn. Between 1947 and 1951, Abraham Levitt and his sons built more than seventeen thousand homes, each with its own lawn. Abraham Levitt wrote "No single feature of a suburban residential community contributes as much to the charm and beauty of the individual home and the locality as well-kept lawns". Landscaping was one of the most important factors in Levittown's success - and no feature was more prominent than the lawn. The Levitts understood that landscaping could add to the appeal of their developments and claimed that, "increase in values are most often found in neighborhoods where lawns show as green carpets" and that, over the years, "lawns trees and shrubs become more valuable both esthetically and monetarily".<ref>{{cite book |last=Teysott |first=Georges |date=1 June 1999 |title=The American Lawn |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |page=18 |isbn=978-1568981604}}</ref> During 1948, the first spring that Levittown had enjoyed, Levitt and Sons fertilized and reseeded all of the lawns free of charge.<ref name="Steinberg" />

The economic recession that began in 2008 has resulted in many communities worldwide to dig up their lawns and plant fruit and vegetable gardens{{source needed|date=May 2018}}. This has the potential to greatly change cultural values attached to the lawn, as they are increasingly viewed as environmentally and economically unviable in the modern context.<ref name="Trudgill">{{cite journal | last1 = Trudgill | first1 = Stephan | last2 = Jeffery | first2 = Angus | last3 = Parker | first3 = John | year = 2010 | title = Climate Change and the Resilience of the Domestic Lawn | journal = Applied Geography | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 177–190 | doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2009.08.002}}</ref>

===Australia===
The appearance of the lawn in [[Australia]] followed closely after its establishment in North America and parts of Europe. Lawn was established on the so-called "nature strip" (a uniquely Australian term) by the 1920s and was common throughout the developing suburbs of Australia. By the 1950s, the Australian-designed [[Victa lawn mower]] was being used by the many people who had turned pastures into lawn and was also being exported to dozens of countries.<ref>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Wood |first=Richard V. |authorlink=|year=2002|id=A160099b.htm|title= Richardson, Mervyn Victor (1894 - 1972) |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</ref> Prior to the 1970s, all brush and native species were stripped from a development site and replaced with lawns that utilized imported plant species. Since the 1970s there has been an interest in using indigenous species for lawns, especially considering their lower water requirements.<ref name="Hogan">{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/07255136030741005|doi = 10.1177/07255136030741005|title = 'Nature Strip': Australian Suburbia and the Enculturation of Nature|year = 2003|last1 = Hogan|first1 = Trevor|journal = Thesis Eleven|volume = 74|pages = 54–75|s2cid = 145780003}}</ref> Lawns are also established in garden areas as well as used for the surface of sporting fields.

Over time, with consideration to the frequency of droughts in Australia, the movement towards "naturalism", or the use of indigenous plant species in yards, was beneficial. These grasses were more drought resistant than their European counterparts, and many who wished to keep their lawns switched to these alternatives or allowed their green carpets to revert to the indigenous scrub in an effort to reduce the strain on water supplies.<ref name="Trudgill" /> However, lawns remain a popular surface and their practical and aesthetically pleasing appearance reduces the use of water-impervious surfaces such as concrete. The growing use of [[Rainwater tank|rainwater storage tanks]] has improved the ability to maintain them.

Following recent droughts, Australia has seen a change to predominately warm-season turfgrasses, particularly in the southern states like New South Wales and Victoria which are predominately temperate climates within urban regions. The more drought tolerant grasses have been chosen by councils and homeowners for the choice of using less water compared to cool-season turfgrasses like fescue and ryegrass. Mild dormancy seems to be of little concern when high-profile areas can be oversown for short periods or nowadays, turf colourants (fake green) are extremely popular.

==Uses==
[[File:Seededfertilizedlawn.JPG|thumb|A newly seeded, fertilized and mowed lawn]]
Lawns are a common feature of private [[garden]]s, public landscapes and [[park]]s in many parts of the world. They are created for aesthetic pleasure, as well as for sports or other outdoor recreational use. Lawns are useful as a playing surface both because they mitigate erosion and dust generated by intensive foot traffic and because they provide a cushion for players in sports such as [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[American football|football]], [[soccer]], [[cricket]], [[baseball]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[hockey]] and lawn [[bocce]].

Lawns and the resulting lawn clipping waste can be used as an ingredient in making compost and is also viewed as [[fodder]], used in the production of lawn clipping [[silage]] which is fed to livestock<ref>{{Cite web|title = Making Silage from Lawn Clippings|url = http://www.grit.com/farm-and-garden/making-silage-from-lawn-clippings-ze0z1410zdeh.aspx|website = Grit|access-date = 2016-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = All Flesh Is Grass|last = Logsdon|first = Gene|publisher = Swallow Press|year = 2004|isbn = 978-0-8040-1068-9|location = Ohio|pages = Chapter 20}}</ref> as a sustainable feed source.

==Types of lawn plants==
Lawns need not be, and have not always been, made up of [[grass]]es alone. Other plants for lawn-like usable garden areas are [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], low [[herb]]s and [[wildflower]]s, and [[ground cover]]s that can be walked upon.
[[Image:Lawn 16l07.JPG|right|thumb|The area on the right has not been mown since the previous autumn.]]
Thousands of varieties of grasses and grasslike plants are used for lawns, each adapted to specific conditions of precipitation and irrigation, seasonal temperatures, and sun/shade tolerances. Plant hybridizers and botanists are constantly creating and finding improved varieties of the basic species and new ones, often more economical and environmentally sustainable by needing less water, fertilizer, pest and disease treatments, and maintenance. The three basic categories are cool season grasses, warm season grasses, and grass alternatives.

===Grasses===

Many different species of grass are currently used, depending on the intended use and the climate. Coarse grasses are used where active sports are played, and finer grasses are used for ornamental lawns for their visual effects. Some grasses are adapted to [[oceanic climate]]s with cooler summers, and others to [[tropical]] and [[continental climate]]s with hotter summers. Often, a mix of grass or low plant types is used to form a stronger lawn when one type does better in the warmer seasons and the other in the colder ones. This mixing is taken further by a form of grass breeding which produces what are known as cultivars. A cultivar is a cross-breed of two different varieties of grass and aims to combine certain traits taken from each individual breed. This creates a new strain which can be very specialised, suited to a particular environment, such as low water, low light or low nutrient.

[[Image:Grassy grass plant.svg|thumb|Diagram of a typical lawn grass plant]]
====Cool season grasses====
Cool season grasses start growth at {{convert|5|C|F}}, and grow at their fastest rate when temperatures are between {{convert|10|C|F}} and {{convert|25|C|F}}, in climates that have relatively mild/cool summers, with two periods of rapid growth in the spring and autumn.<ref name="huxley">Huxley, A., ed. (1992). Lawns. In ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening'' 3: 26-33. Macmillan. {{ISBN|0-333-47494-5}}</ref> They retain their color well in extreme cold and typically grow very dense, carpetlike lawns with relatively little thatch.

*Bluegrass (''[[Poa]]'' spp.)
*Bentgrass (''[[Agrostis]]'' spp.)
*Ryegrasses (''[[Lolium]]'' spp.)
*Fescues (''[[Festuca]]'' spp.)
*Feather reed grass (''[[Calamogrostis]]'' spp.)
*Tufted hair grass (''[[Deschampsia]]'' spp.)

====Warm season grasses====
Warm season grasses only start growth at temperatures above {{convert|10|C|F}}, and grow fastest when temperatures are between {{convert|25|C|F}} and {{convert|35|C|F}}, with one long growth period over the spring and summer (Huxley 1992). They often go dormant in cooler months, turning shades of tan or brown. Many warm season grasses are quite drought tolerant, and can handle very high summer temperatures, although temperatures below {{convert|-15|C|F}} can kill most southern ecotype warm season grasses.  The northern varieties, such as buffalograss and blue grama, are hardy to {{convert|45|C|F}}.

*Zoysiagrass (''[[Zoysia]]'' spp.)
*Bermudagrass (''[[Cynodon]]'' spp.)
*[[St. Augustine grass]] (''Stenotaphrum secundatum'')
*Bahiagrass (''[[Paspalum]]'' spp.)
*Centipedegrass (''[[Eremochloa ophiuroides]]'')
*Carpet grass (''[[Axonopus]]'' spp.)
*[[Bouteloua dactyloides|Buffalograss]] (''Bouteloua dactyloides'')
*Grama grass (''[[Bouteloua]]'' spp.)
*Kikuyu grass (''[[Pennisetum clandestinum]]'')

===Grass alternatives===
''[[Carex]]'' species and cultivars are well represented in the [[horticulture]] industry as 'sedge' alternatives for 'grass' in mowed lawns and garden meadows. Both low-growing and spreading [[Ornamental plant|ornamental]] [[cultivar]]s and [[Native plant|native species]] are used in for [[sustainable landscaping]] as low-maintenance and [[Xeriscaping|drought-tolerant]] [[Turfgrass|grass]] replacements for lawns and garden [[meadow]]s. [[Natural environment|wildland]] [[habitat]] [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] projects and [[Natural landscaping|natural landscaping and gardens]] use them also for 'user-friendly' areas. The [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] has used ''[[Carex pansa]]'' (meadow sedge) and ''[[Carex praegracilis]]'' (dune sedge) expansively in the [[Sculpture Garden]]s in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="Bornstein, Fross, O'Brien">Bornstein, Carol, Fross, David, and O'Brien, Bart; 'California Native Plants for the Garden;' Cachuma Press, Los Olivos, CA; 2005; {{ISBN|0-9628505-8-6}}, 0-9628505-9-4. pp. 74-5.</ref>

:Some lower [[Cyperaceae|sedges]] used are:
*''Carex caryophyllea'' (cultivar 'The Beatles')
*''C. divulsa'' (Berkeley sedge)<ref name="Bornstein, Fross, O'Brien" />
*''[[Carex flacca|C. glauca]]'' (blue sedge) (syn. ''C. flacca'')

*''C. tumulicola'' (foothill sedge) (cultivar 'Santa Cruz Mnts. selection')<ref name="Bornstein, Fross, O'Brien" />
*''C. uncifolia'' (ruby sedge)

===Ground cover alternatives===
[[File:Arctostaphylos-uva-ursi.JPG|thumb|One of ground cover plants, [[common bearberry]]]]
Some lawns are replaced with low [[ground cover]]s, such as [[Thymus serpyllum|creeping thyme]], [[camomile]], [[Lippia graveolens|''Lippia'']], [[Mazus reptans|purple flowering ''Mazus'']], [[Dymondia|grey ''Dymondia'']], creeping [[sedum]]s, and [[creeping jenny]].<ref name="Lunn">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/gardening/stories/s1148898.htm|title=Fact Sheet: Lawn Alternatives|last=Lunn|first=Matthew|date=7 September 2004|publisher=Gardening Australia|access-date=16 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903103225/http://www.abc.net.au/gardening/stories/s1148898.htm|archive-date=3 September 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
An example of this is the floral lawn in [[Avondale Park]]. Other alternatives to lawns include [[meadow]]s, drought-tolerant [[xeriscape]] gardens, [[Natural landscaping|natural landscape]]s, [[native plant]] habitat gardens, paved [[Spanish garden|Spanish]] [[courtyard]] and [[patio garden]]s, [[butterfly garden]]s, [[rain gardens]], [[tapestry lawn]] and [[kitchen garden]]s. Trees and shrubs in close proximity to lawns provide habitat for birds in [[History of gardening|traditional]], [[cottage garden|cottage]] and [[wildlife garden]]s.

==Lawn care and maintenance==
Seasonal lawn establishment and care varies depending on the climate zone and type of lawn grown.

===Planting and seeding===
[[File:Spreader AF.jpg|thumb|[[Broadcast spreader]]s can be attached to [[tractor]]s or [[all-terrain vehicle|ATV]]s to spread seed or fertilizer]]
[[File:Plug Aerator2.jpg|thumb|[[Lawn aerator|Aeration]] is one method used to maintain a lawn]]

Early autumn, spring, and early summer are the primary seasons to seed, lay [[sod]] (turf), plant 'liners', or 'sprig' new lawns, when the soil is warmer and air cooler. Seeding is the least expensive, but may take longer for the lawn to be established. [[Lawn aerator|Aerating]] just before planting/seeding may promote deeper root growth and thicker turf.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://toolsaroundthehouse.com/garden/lawn-aeration-guide|title=Lawn Aeration: What It Is, When to do it and Why It Helps|date=August 2017|website=toolsaroundthehouse.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-30}}</ref>

Sodding (American English), or turfing (British English), provides an almost instant lawn, and can be undertaken in most temperate climates in any season, but is more expensive and more vulnerable to drought until established. [[Hydroseeding]] is a quick, less expensive method of planting large, sloped or hillside landscapes. Some grasses and sedges are available and planted from 'liner' and {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} containers, from 'flats', 'plugs' or 'sprigs', and are planted apart to grow together.

===Fertilizers and chemicals===

Various organic and inorganic or synthetic fertilizers are available, with instant or time-release applications. Pesticides, which includes biological and chemical [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s and [[fungicide]]s, treating diseases like [[gray leaf spot]], are available. Consideration for their effects on the lawn and garden ecosystem and via runoff and dispersion on the surrounding environment, can constrain their use. For example, the Canadian [[province]] of Quebec and over 130 [[town|municipalities]] prohibit the use of synthetic lawn pesticides.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web

[[Sustainable gardening]] uses [[organic horticulture]] methods, such as [[organic fertilizer]]s, [[biological pest control]], [[beneficial insects]], and [[companion planting]], among other methods, to sustain an attractive lawn in a safe garden. An example of an organic herbicide is [[corn gluten meal]], which releases an 'organic dipeptide' into the soil to inhibit root formation of germinating [[weed]] seeds. An example of an organic alternative to insecticide use is applying beneficial [[nematode]]s to combat soil-dwelling [[Larva|grubs]], such as the larvae of [[Scarabaeidae|chafer beetles]]. The [[Integrated Pest Management]] approach is a coordinated low impact approach.<ref>[http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/index.html UC Statewide Integrated Pest Management Program.] access date: 25 May 2010</ref>

Maintaining a rough lawn requires only occasional cutting with a suitable machine, or grazing by animals. Maintaining a smooth and closely cut lawn, be it for aesthetic or practical reasons or because [[social pressure]] from neighbors and local municipal ordinances requires it,<ref>{{cite web

==Social impacts==
The prevalence of the lawns in films such as [[Pleasantville (film)| ''Pleasantville'']] (1998) and ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990) alludes to the importance of the lawn as a social mechanism that gives great importance to visual representation of the American suburb as well as its practised culture. It is implied that a neighbor whose lawn is not in pristine condition is morally corrupt, emphasizing the role a well-kept lawn plays in neighborly and community relationships. In both of these films, green space surrounding a house in the suburbs becomes an indicator of [[morality | moral]] [[integrity]] as well as of [[social norm | social]] and [[gender norm]]s - lawn care has long been associated{{by whom?|date=August 2020}} with men. These lawns also reinforce [[social class | class]] and societal norms by subtly excluding those who may not have been able to afford a house with a lawn.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dickinson | first1 = Greg | year = 2006 | title = The Pleasantville Effect: Nostalgia and the Visual Framing of (White) Suburbia | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 70 | issue = 3| pages = 212–233 | doi = 10.1080/10570310600843504 | s2cid = 144339746 }}</ref> The lawn as a reflection of someone's character and the neighborhood at large is not restricted to films; the same theme appears in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), by American novelist [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]].<ref>Fitzgerald, F. Scott. ''The Great Gatsby''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1925.</ref> Character Nick Carraway rents the house next to Gatsby's and fails to maintain his lawn according to West Egg standards. The rift between the two lawns troubles Gatsby to the point that he dispatches his gardener to mow Nick's grass and thereby establish uniformity.

Most lawn-care equipment over the decades has been advertised to men, and companies have long associated good lawn-care with good [[citizenship]] in their [[marketing campaign]]s. As well, the appearance of a healthy lawn was meant{{by whom?|date=August 2020}} to imply the health of the man taking care of it; controlled weeds and strict boundaries became a practical application of the desire to control [[nature]], as well as an expression of control over personal lives once working full-time became central to suburban success. Women were [[enculturation | encultured]] over time to view the lawn as part of the household, as an essential furnishing, and to encourage their husbands to maintain a lawn for the family and community reputation.<ref name="Jenkins" />

During [[World War II]] (1939-1945), women became the focus of lawn-care companies in the absence of their husbands and sons. The lawn was promoted{{by whom?|date=August 2020}} as a necessary means by which women could help support their male family-members and American patriotism as a whole. The image of the lawn changed from focusing on technology and manhood to emphasizing aesthetic pleasure and the health benefits derived from its maintenance; it was assumed{{by whom?|date=August 2020}} that women would not respond positively to images of efficiency and power. The language of these marketing campaigns still intended to imbue the female population with notions of family, motherhood, and the duties of a wife; it has been argued{{by whom?|date=August 2020}} that this was done so that it would be easier for men returning from war to resume the roles which their wives had taken over in their absence. This was especially apparent in the 1950s and 1960s, when lawn-care rhetoric emphasized the lawn as a husband's responsibility and as a pleasurable hobby when he retired.<ref name="Jenkins" />

The lawn aesthetic in Europe and Australia seems{{or|date=August 2020}} to exhibit the same cultural tendencies - as a representation of order, power over nature, patriotism, and suburban [[family life]] while still adhering to other [[gender constructs]] present throughout the world's suburbs.{{cn|date=August 2020}} However, there are differences in the particulars of lawn maintenance and appearance, such as the length of the grass, species (and therefore its color), and mowing.<ref name="Hogan" /><ref>

Other concerns, criticisms, and ordinances regarding lawns arise from wider environmental consequences:
* Lawns can reduce [[biodiversity]], especially when the lawn covers a large area. Lawns promote homogenization and are normally cleared of unwanted plant and animal species, typically with synthetic [[pesticide]]s, which can also kill unintended target species. They may be composed of [[introduced species]] not native to the area, particularly in the United States.  This can produce a habitat that supports a reduced number of wildlife species.<ref name=turf>{{Cite web|url=http://ag.udel.edu/udbg/sl/vegetation/Turf_Grass_Madness.pdf|title=Rebecca Pineo. Susan Barton. Turf Grass Madness: Reasons to Reduce the Lawn in Your Landscape}}</ref>
* Lawn maintenance commonly involves use of fertilizers and synthetic [[pesticide]]s, which can cause great harm. Some are [[carcinogen]]s and [[endocrine disruptor]]s.  They may permanently linger in the environment and negatively affect the health of potentially all nearby organisms. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has estimated{{When|date=August 2011}} nearly {{convert|32000000|kg}} of active pesticide ingredients are used on suburban lawns each year in the United States.<ref name="nwf">{{cite web

===Water conservation===
Maintaining a green lawn sometimes requires large amounts of [[water]]. While natural rainfall is usually sufficient to maintain a lawn's health in the temperate British Isles- the birthplace of the concept of the lawn- in times of drought hosepipe bans may be implemented by the water suppliers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hosepipeban.org.uk/ |title=Hosepipe ban |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |access-date=21 January 2015 }}</ref> Conversely, exportation of the lawn ideal to more arid regions (e.g. U.S. Southwest and Australia) strains [[water supply]] systems when water supplies are already scarce. This necessitates upgrades to larger, more environmentally invasive equipment to deal with increased demand due to lawn watering. Grass typically goes dormant during periods of cold or heat outside of its preferred temperature ranges; dormancy reduces the grasses' water demand. Most grasses typically recover quite well from a drought, but many property owners become concerned about the brown appearance and increase watering during the summer months. ''Water in Australia'' observed 1995 data that up to 90% of the water used in [[Canberra]] during summer [[droughts in Australia|drought periods]] was used for watering lawns.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xC0fAQAAIAAJ|title=Water in Australia: Resources and Management|last=Smith|first=David Ingle|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195537048|language=en}}</ref>

An increased concern from the general public over pesticide and fertilizer use and their associated health risks, combined with the implementation of the legislation, such as the US [[Food Quality Protection Act]], has resulted in the reduced presence of synthetic chemicals, namely pesticides, in urban landscapes such as lawns in the late 20th century.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alumai | first1 = Alfred | last2 = Salminen | first2 = Seppo O. | last3 = Richmond | first3 = Douglas S | last4 = Cardina | first4 = John | last5 = Grewal | first5 = Parwinder S. | year = 2009 | title = Comparative Evaluation of Aesthetic, Biological, and Economic Effectiveness of Different Lawn Management Programs | journal = Urban Ecosyst | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 127–144 | doi=10.1007/s11252-008-0073-8| s2cid = 13204219 }}</ref> Many of these concerns over the safety and environmental impact of some of the synthetic fertilizers and pesticides has led to their ban by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and many local governments.<ref name="Alumai PhD" /> The use of pesticides and other chemicals to care for lawns has also led to the death of nearly 7 million birds each year, a topic that was central to [[Silent Spring]] by the conservationist [[Rachel Carson]].<ref name="Steinberg" />

===Decreasing environmental impact===

In the [[United States]], lawn heights are generally maintained by gasoline-powered [[lawnmower]]s, which contribute to urban [[smog]] during the summer months. The EPA found, in some urban areas, up to 5% of smog was due to small gasoline engines made before 1997, such as are typically used on lawnmowers. Since 1997, the EPA has mandated emissions controls on newer engines in an effort to reduce smog.<ref>{{cite web

A 2010 study seemed to show lawn care inputs were balanced by the [[carbon sequestration]] benefits of lawns, and they may not be contributors to [[anthropogenic global warming]].<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Bright-Green/2010/0122/Lawns-may-contribute-to-global-warming "Lawns may contribute to global warming"] by Judy Lowe, ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 22 January 2010.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100119133515.htm|title=Retrieved 17 May 2010|work=sciencedaily.com}}</ref> <!---Note---Headline does not reflect later correction. Article gave link to https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100119133515.htm "Urban 'Green' Spaces May Contribute to Global Warming"], ''ScienceDaily'', same date, which is longer but has less on the correction; the ''Monitor'' on 15 February 2010 published an addendum notice from the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute which said in part "that Dr. Amy Townsend-Small of [[University of California, Irvine]] acknowledged a computation error [in the] study published January 19, 2010, titled 'Carbon Sequestration and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Urban Turf.' With the error corrected, ornamental grass is in fact shown to be a net sequesterer of carbon, even when inputs are accounted for in grass maintenance. The correction has been submitted to the [[American Geophysical Union]] (AGU) who published the paper. ... The error was not caught during the peer review process prior to publication of the paper by the AGU." Retrieved 2010-05-17--->

However, lawns with high maintenance (mowing, irrigation, and leaf blowing) and high fertilization rates have a net emission of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide that have large [[global warming potential]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Townsend‐Small|first=Amy|author2=Czimczik, Claudia|date=March 2010|title=Correction to "Carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in urban turf"|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2010/2010GL042735.shtml|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=37|issue=6|pages=n/a|bibcode=2010GeoRL..37.6707T|doi=10.1029/2010GL042735|access-date=15 March 2012}}</ref>

With the use of ecological techniques including [[organic lawn management]], the impact of lawns can be reduced. Such methods include the use of native grasses, sedges, and low herbs; higher mowing techniques; low volume irrigation, "[[grasscycling]]" grass clippings in place; an [[integrated pest management]] program; exclusive organic fertilizer and compost use; and including a variety of trees, [[shrub]]s, perennials, and other plants surrounding the lawn. A positive benefit of a healthy lawn is it filters contaminants and prevents runoff and erosion of bare soil.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} <!---where in U.S. ?-Highway construction projects in the United States now routinely include replanting grasses on disturbed soils for this purpose, although they are not maintained as lawns.--->

Replacing turf grass with low-maintenance groundcovers or employing a variety of low-maintenance perennials, trees and shrubs<ref name=turf/> can be a good alternative to traditional lawn spaces, especially in hard-to-grow or hard-to-mow areas, as it can reduce maintenance requirements, associated pollution and offers higher aesthetic and wildlife value.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ag.udel.edu/udbg/sl/vegetation/Groundcovers.pdf|title=Rebecca Pineo, Botanic Gardens Intern Susan Barton, Extension Specialist.

Some environmental organizations, with the support of the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], concerned by the decline in the number of [[bee]]s worldwide, in the first day of Bees' Needs Week 2018 (an annual week-long event arranged by [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Defra]] that is meant to raise awareness of the effects caused upon bees by human activity, lasting from 9-15 July), give some recommendations of ways to preserve bees. 

The recommendations include to:
#Grow more flowers
#Let gardens grow freely
#Cut grass less often
#Do not disturb insect nest and hibernation spots
#Do not use pesticides<ref name="Bees' Needs Week 2018">{{cite web |title=Bees' Needs Week 2018 |url=https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org/bees-needs/ |website=Bumblebee Conservation Trust |publisher=Bumblebee Conservation Trust |access-date=9 July 2018}}</ref>
