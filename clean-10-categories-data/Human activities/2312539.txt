'''Amichand Rajbansi''' (14 January 1942 â€“ 29 December 2011) was a [[South Africa]]n [[politician]]. He was a former Chairman of the Ministers' Council of the [[House of Delegates of South Africa|House of Delegates]] [[Tricameral Parliament|Tricameral]] parliamentary chamber for [[Indians in South Africa|Indian]] people, and leader of the [[Minority Front]].

Amichand Rajbansi, nicknamed the Bengal Tiger, was born in [[Clairwood]], [[Durban]] on 14 January 1942. He attended [[Clairwood Secondary School]] and the [[Indian University College]] to study [[History]] and [[Psychology]] as major subjects.

After a long service as a sports administrator, professional soccer referee, civic leader, and serving in local government structures dealing with local affairs, Rajbansi was elected to the [[South African Indian Council]] in 1974. This council was rejected by most Indians.<ref name="SAICOMalley">{{Cite web|url=https://omalley.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv03445/04lv03446/05lv03503.htm|title=South African Indian Council - The O'Malley Archives|website=omalley.nelsonmandela.org|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref> In 1976 Rajbansi resigned from the Indian Council protesting the inter Cabinet council{{clarify|date=December 2011}} between the Indian Council and government cabinet of Prime Minister [[John Vorster]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} In 1981 he formed the [[National People's Party (South Africa, 1981)|National People's Party]] (NPP) and was elected leader of this new party. The NPP successfully competed for the election to the South African Indian Council and took control of SAIC, although only 6% of the Indian electorate participated in the 1981 elections for the Council.<ref name="SAICOMalley"/>

In 1984, following Prime Minister [[PW Botha]]'s [[Tricameral Parliament|constitutional reforms]], the NPP stood for the newly constituted [[House of Delegates of South Africa|House of Delegates]], the Indian only parliamentary chamber, and won the majority of seats in the House. As a result, Rajbansi became a member of the [[Government of South Africa|South African Cabinet]] and chairman for the Ministers' Council for Indian Affairs.

Rajbansi's leadership of the House of Delegates was often controversial, and in May 1987, his NPP lost its majority {{clarify|date=December 2011}} to an opposition coalition. However, Rajbansi did not resign his chairmanship,{{clarify|date=December 2011}} and he survived the leadership challenge with the help of P.W. Botha. A Parliamentary select committee later in 1987 found that Rajbansi accepted R10 000 for his party in order to "facilitate the obtaining of land and contracts", and he was suspended from the House of Delegates. He was suspended from P.W. Botha's cabinet, and Botha appointed a [[Public inquiry|commission of enquiry]] under Justice Neville James  to investigate allegations of corruption in the House of Delegates Administration. He was later found guilty by another parliamentary committee of "glaring" maladministration in forcing the purchase of a cultural centre for an inflated price. Botha fired Rajbansi from his cabinet and his Minister's Council in December 1988, following the preliminary report from the James Commission. The final report of the commission described Rajbansi as "arrogant", "unscrupulous", "ruthless" and a "mean-minded bully". The commission found that Rajbansi had lied to Parliament, committed statutory [[perjury]], had given false evidence to the Commission,  and misused his position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/amichand-rajbansi-threatens-non-cooperation-james-commission|title=Amichand Rajbansi threatens non-cooperation with the James Commission {{!}} South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref> It also recommended that he never again be employed as a minister in the House of Delegates or in any official or semi-official post which called for integrity. He later resigned as leader of the NPP, and was suspended from the House of Delegates, only to be reinstated a few months later. In June 1990, he was convicted on 2 counts of fraud, and was fined R10 000 for using "fronts" {{clarify|date=December 2011}} to obtain premises for his businesses when he was a member of the SA Indian Council.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/rajbansi-bombastic-thick-skinned-and-controversial-1205795|title=Rajbansi: Bombastic, thick-skinned and controversial {{!}} IOL News|website=www.iol.co.za|language=en|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>

After South Africa's transition to [[Multiracial people|multi-racial]] democracy in 1994, the NPP became the Minority Front and continued to draw support from parts of the [[Indian South Africans|Indian community]].

After the 2004 elections, Rajbansi made an alliance with the [[African National Congress]] and he became MEC for Sports and Recreation for [[KwaZulu-Natal]] Province. In January 2009, Mr Rajbansi received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[India International Friendship Society]] in [[New Delhi]], in recognition of his selfless service to humanity. He was the only African to receive this award.

On 29 December 2011, Rajbansi died from natural causes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Amichand-Rajbansi-dead-at-69-20111229 |title=Amichand Rajbansi dies |work=[[News24]] |date=29 December 2011}}</ref>
