Cows routinely lie down and can easily regain their footing unless sick or injured. Scientific studies have been conducted to determine if cow tipping is theoretically possible, with varying conclusions.  All agree that cows are large animals that are difficult to surprise and will generally resist attempts to be tipped. Estimates suggest a force of between {{convert|3000|and|4000|N|abbr=off}} is needed, and that at least four and possibly as many as fourteen people would be required to achieve this. In real-life situations where cattle have to be laid on the ground, or "cast", such as for [[livestock branding|branding]], [[hoof]] care or veterinary treatment, either rope restraints are required or specialized mechanical equipment is used that confines the cow and then tips it over.  On rare occasions, cattle can lie down or fall down in proximity to a ditch or hill that restricts their normal ability to rise without help. Cow tipping has many references in popular culture and is also used as a [[figure of speech]].

The urban legend of cow tipping relies upon the presumption that cattle are slow-moving, dim-witted, and weak-legged, thus easily pushed over without much force. Some versions suggest that because cows sleep standing up, it is possible to approach them and push them over without the animals reacting.<ref name="Haines" /> However, cows only sleep lightly while standing up, and they are easily awakened.<ref name = Cow1>{{cite news |last = Malvern |first = Jack |title = Cow-Tipping Myth Hasn't Got a Leg to Stand On |newspaper = Times Online |url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1940322.ece |accessdate = October 28, 2006 |location = London |date = November 5, 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629083548/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article586737.ece |archivedate = June 29, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref> They lie down to sleep deeply.<ref name=collins /> Furthermore, numerous sources have questioned the practice's feasibility, since most cows weigh over half a ton and easily resist any lesser force.<ref name = Cow1 /><ref>{{cite web |last = Semke |first = Matt |title = The Statics of Cow Tipping |publisher = University of Nebraska – Lincoln (UNL) College of Engineering and Mechanics Course Project |url = http://emweb.unl.edu/Mechanics-Pages/Matt-Semke/The%20Statics%20of%20Cow%20Tipping.htm |accessdate = April 17, 2007 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080827083454/http://emweb.unl.edu/Mechanics-Pages/Matt-Semke/The%20Statics%20of%20Cow%20Tipping.htm |archivedate = August 27, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

A 2005 study led by Margo Lillie, a [[zoology|zoologist]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], and her student Tracy Boechler, concluded that tipping a cow would require a force of nearly {{convert|3000|N}}<ref name="Haines">{{cite news |last = Haines |first = Lester |title = Boffins Debunk Cow-Tipping Myth |newspaper = The Register |date = November 9, 2005 |accessdate = November 30, 2012 |url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/09/cow_tipping |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121031144516/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/09/cow_tipping/ |archivedate = October 31, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> and is therefore impossible to accomplish by a single person. Her calculations found that it would require more than four people to apply enough force to push over a cow,<ref name="Haines" /> based on an estimate that a single person could exert {{convert|660|N}} of force. However, since a cow can brace itself, Lillie and Boechler suggested that five or six people would, most likely, be needed.<ref name=collins /> Further, cattle are well aware of their surroundings and are very difficult to surprise, due to excellent senses of both smell and hearing.<ref name=collins>{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/10289862/Cow-tipping-myth-dispelled.html |title = Cow Tipping Myth Dispelled |first = Nick |last = Collins |work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date = September 6, 2013 |accessdate = May 18, 2016 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160426021919/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/10289862/Cow-tipping-myth-dispelled.html |archivedate = April 26, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=Glenn>{{cite news |first = Eddie |last = Glenn |url = http://tahlequahdailypress.com/archive/x519330324 |title = Cow-Tipping: Myth or Reality? |work = Tahlequah Daily Press |date = December 15, 2006 |accessdate = May 18, 2016 }}</ref> Lillie and Boechler's analysis found that if a cow did not move, the principles of static physics suggest that two people might be able to tip a cow if its [[centre of mass]] were pushed over its hooves before the cow could react. However, cows are not rigid or unresponsive, and the faster humans have to move, the less force they can exert. Thus Lillie and Boechler concluded that it is unlikely that cows can actually be tipped over in this way.<ref name="Haines" /> Lillie stated, "It just makes the physics of it all, in my opinion, impossible."<ref name=collins />

Although he agrees that it would take a force of about 3,000 newtons to push over a standing cow, biologist Steven Vogel thinks that the study by Lillie and Boechler overestimates the pushing ability of an individual human.<ref name="Vogel" /> Using data from Cotterell and Kamminga, who estimated that humans exert a pushing force of 280 newtons,<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Cotterell |first1 = Brian |last2 = Kamminga |first2 = Johan |title = Mechanics of Pre-industrial Technology : Introduction to the Mechanics of Ancient and Traditional Material Culture |date = 1992 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Cambridge |isbn = 978-0-521-42871-2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0-xOM8y6Uc8C |via = Google Books }}</ref> Vogel suggests that someone applying force at the requisite height to topple a cow might generate a maximum push of no more than 300 newtons. By this calculation, at least 10 people would be needed to tip over a non-reacting cow. However, this combined force requirement, he says, might not be the greatest impediment to such a prank. Standing cows are not asleep and like other animals have ever-vigilant reflexes. "If the cow does no more than modestly widen its stance without an overall shift of its center of gravity", he says, "about 4,000 newtons or 14 pushers would be needed—quite a challenge to deploy without angering the cow."<ref name="Vogel">{{cite book |last = Vogel |first = Steven |title = Glimpses of Creatures in Their Physical Worlds |publisher = Princeton University Press |year = 2009 |page = 238 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qaOi_huPdfsC |isbn = 978-0-691-13806-0 }}</ref>

Journalist Jake Steelhammer believes the American urban myth of cow tipping originated in the 1970s.

== Veterinary and husbandry practices ==

[[File:Calf cradle.JPG|thumb|left|A calf cradle used for branding in Australia]]

Cattle may need to be deliberately thrown or tipped over for certain types of [[animal husbandry|husbandry]] practices and medical treatment.  When done for medical purposes, this is often called "casting", and when performed without mechanical assistance requires the attachment of {{cvt|30|to|40|ft}} of rope around the body and legs of the animal. After the rope is secured by non-slip [[bowline]] knots, it is pulled to the rear until the animal is off-balance. Once the cow is forced to lie down in [[sternum|sternal]] recumbency (on its chest), it can be rolled onto its side and its legs tied to prevent kicking.<ref>{{cite web |title = Rope Squeeze |url = http://research.vet.upenn.edu/Dairy/Restraint/CastingRestraints/RopeSqueeze/tabid/3917/Default.aspx |website = University of Pennsylvania Veterinary Medicine |accessdate = May 16, 2016 |date = 2016 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160523185855/http://research.vet.upenn.edu/Dairy/Restraint/CastingRestraints/RopeSqueeze/tabid/3917/Default.aspx |archivedate = May 23, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Burley Method of Casting |url = http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/projects/fieldservice/Dairy/RESTR/burley.htm |website = New Bolton Center Field Service Department |accessdate = May 16, 2016 |date = 2003 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160525221519/http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/projects/fieldservice/Dairy/RESTR/burley.htm |archivedate = May 25, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

A calf table or calf cradle, also called a "tipping table" or a "throw down", is a relatively modern invention designed to be used on [[calf|calves]] that are being [[livestock branding|branded]].

Cows may tip themselves inadvertently.  Due to their bulk and relatively short legs, cattle cannot roll over. Those that lie down and roll to their sides with their feet pointing uphill may become stuck and unable to rise without assistance, with potentially fatal results.  In such cases, two humans can roll or flip a cow onto its other side, so that its feet are aimed downhill, thus allowing it to rise on its own.<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Swearingen |first1 = Jake |title = Cow Tipping Doesn't Exist — But Cow Flipping Does – Modern Farmer |url = http://modernfarmer.com/2013/09/cow-tipping-doesnt-exist-cow-flipping/ |website = Modern Farmer |accessdate = May 16, 2016 |language = en-US |date = September 9, 2013 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160526180102/http://modernfarmer.com/2013/09/cow-tipping-doesnt-exist-cow-flipping/ |archivedate = May 26, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>
In one documented case of "real-life cow tipping", a pregnant cow rolled into a gully in [[New Hampshire]] and became trapped in an inverted state until rescued by [[volunteer fire fighters]].

Trauma or illness may also result in a cow unable to rise to its feet.  Such animals are sometimes called "[[downer (animal)|downers]]."

The term ''cow tipping'' is sometimes used as a [[figure of speech]] for pushing over something big.
