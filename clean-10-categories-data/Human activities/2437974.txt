The '''food industry''' is a complex, global collective of diverse [[business]]es that supplies most of the [[food]] consumed by the [[World population|world's population]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The term food industries covers a series of industrial activities directed at the processing, conversion, preparation, preservation and packaging of foodstuffs. The food industry today has become highly diversified, with manufacturing ranging from small, traditional, family-run activities that are highly labor-intensive, to large, capital-intensive and highly mechanized industrial processes. Many food industries depend almost entirely on local agriculture produce or fishing.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parmeggiani|first1=Lougi|title=Encyclopædia of Occupational Health and Safety|edition=3rd|pages=2538|asin=B00E1WQZ9S}}</ref>

It is challenging to find an inclusive way to cover all aspects of food production and sale. The UK [[Food Standards Agency]] describes it as "the whole food industry – from farming and food production, packaging and distribution, to retail and catering."<ref>{{cite web|title=Industry|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/|website=Food Standards Agency (UK)}}</ref> The Economic Research Service of the [[USDA]] uses the term ''food system'' to describe the same thing, stating: "The U.S. food system is a complex network of farmers and the industries that link to them. Those links include makers of farm equipment and chemicals as well as firms that provide services to agribusinesses, such as providers of transportation and financial services. The system also includes the food marketing industries that link farms to consumers, and which include food and fiber processors, wholesalers, retailers, and foodservice establishments."<ref>{{cite web|title=Food market structures: Overview|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-markets-prices.aspx|website=Economic Research Service (USDA)}}</ref> The food industry includes:
* [[Agriculture]]: raising [[crop]]s, [[livestock]], and [[seafood]]
*[[Manufacturing]]: [[agrichemicals]], agricultural construction, [[farm machinery]] and supplies, [[seed]], etc.
* [[Food processing]]: preparation of fresh products for market, and manufacture of prepared food products
* [[Marketing]]: promotion of generic products (e.g., milk board), new products, [[advertising]], marketing campaigns, [[packaging]], [[public relations]], etc.
* [[Wholesale]] and [[food distribution]]: logistics, transportation, [[Warehouse|warehousing]]
* [[Foodservice]] (which includes catering)
* [[Grocery]], [[farmers' market]]s, [[Marketplaces#Types|public market]]s and other [[retail]]ing
*[[Regulation]]: local, regional, national, and international rules and regulations for food production and sale, including [[food quality]], [[food security]], [[food safety]], marketing/advertising, and industry lobbying activities
* Education: academic, consultancy, vocational
* Research and development: [[food technology]]
* Financial services: [[credit]], [[insurance]]
Only [[subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]], those who survive on what they grow, and [[hunter-gatherers]] can be considered outside the scope of the modern food industry.

The dominant companies in the food industry have sometimes been referred to as Big Food, the term coined by the writer Neil Hamilton.<ref name="BoothCoveney2015">{{cite book|author1=Sue Booth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DS3ABgAAQBAJ&pg=PA3|title=Food Democracy: From consumer to food citizen|author2=John Coveney|date=19 February 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-287-423-8|pages=3–}}</ref><ref name="AllisonRonald2019">{{cite book|author1=Gray, Allison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWSzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA371|title=A Handbook of Food Crime: Immoral and Illegal Practices in the Food Industry and What to Do About Them|author2=Hinch, Ronald|date=1 October 2019|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=978-1-4473-5628-8|pages=371–}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Booth|first=Sue|title=‘Big Food’—The Industrial Food System|date=2015|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-287-423-8_2|work=Food Democracy: From consumer to food citizen|pages=3–11|editor-last=Booth|editor-first=Sue|series=SpringerBriefs in Public Health|place=Singapore|publisher=Springer|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-981-287-423-8_2|isbn=978-981-287-423-8|access-date=2020-11-26|last2=Coveney|first2=John|editor2-last=Coveney|editor2-first=John}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stuckler|first=David|last2=Nestle|first2=Marion|date=2012-06-19|title=Big Food, Food Systems, and Global Health|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001242|journal=PLOS Medicine|language=en|volume=9|issue=6|pages=e1001242|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001242|issn=1549-1676|pmc=3378592|pmid=22723746}}</ref>

== Food production ==
{{Main|Agriculture|Agronomy}}
[[File:Junín Campo Cerrito Colorado 20130124 1.jpg|thumb|A soybean field in Junin, Argentina]]
Most food produced for the food industry comes from commodity crops using conventional agricultural practices. Agriculture is the process of producing food, feeding products, fiber and other desired products by the cultivation of certain plants and the raising of domesticated animals ([[livestock]]).  On average, 83% of the food consumed by humans is produced using terrestrial agriculture.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title={{Harvnb|IPCC SRCCL|2019}}|last1=Mbow|first1=C.|last2=Rosenzweig|first2=C.|last3=Barioni|first3=L.

The practice of agriculture is also known as "[[farming]]". Scientists, inventors, and others devoted to improving farming methods and implements are also said to be engaged in agriculture. 1 in 3 people worldwide are employed in agriculture,<ref name="DAOLab">{{cite web|title=Labour|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2490e/i2490e01b.pdf|website=FAO.org|publisher=The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> yet it only contributes 3% to global GDP.<ref name="FAOMac">{{cite web|title=Macroeconomy|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2490e/i2490e01c.pdf|website=FAO.org|publisher=The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> In 2017, on average, agriculture contributes 4% of national GDPs.<ref name=":0" /> Global agricultural production is responsible for between 14 and 28% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it one of the largest contributors to [[global warming]], in large part due to conventional agricultural practices, including [[Fertilizer|nitrogen fertilizers]] and poor [[land management]].<ref name=":0" />

Agronomy is the science and technology of producing and using plants for food, fuel, fibre, and [[land reclamation]]. Agronomy encompasses work in the areas of [[plant genetics]], [[plant physiology]], [[meteorology]], and [[soil science]]. Agronomy is the application of a combination of sciences. Agronomists today are involved with many issues including producing food, creating healthier food, managing the environmental impact of agriculture, and extracting energy from plants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ImAnAgronomist.net |title=I'm An Agronomist! |publisher=Imanagronomist.net |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>

== Food processing ==
{{Main|Food processing}}

[[File:Meat packages in a Roman supermarket.jpg|thumb|Packaged [[meat]] in a [[supermarket]]]]

Food processing includes the methods and techniques used to transform raw ingredients into food for human consumption. Food processing takes clean, harvested or slaughtered and butchered components and uses them to produce marketable food products. There are several different ways in which food can be produced.

[[Bespoke|One-off production]]: This method is used when customers make an order for something to be made to their own specifications, for example, a [[wedding cake]]. The making of one-off products could take days depending on how intricate the design is.

[[Batch production]]: This method is used when the size of the market for a product is not clear, and where there is a range within a [[product line]].  A certain number of the same goods will be produced to make up a batch or run, for example a bakery may bake a limited number of [[cupcake]]s.  This method involves estimating [[consumer demand]].

[[Mass production]]: This method is used when there is a mass market for a large number of identical products, for example [[chocolate bar]]s, ready meals and [[Canning|canned food]]. The product passes from one stage of production to another along a [[production line]].

[[Just-in-time (business)|Just-in-time (JIT)]] (production): This method of production is mainly used in [[restaurant]]s. All components of the product are available in-house and the customer chooses what they want in the product. It is then prepared in a [[kitchen]], or in front of the buyer as in [[delicatessen|sandwich delicatessens]], [[pizzerias]], and  [[sushi|sushi bars]].

== Industry influence ==
The food industry has a large influence on consumerism.  Organizations, such as The [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP), have been criticized for accepting monetary donations from companies within the food industry, such as Coca-Cola.<ref name="Brody 354–358">{{Cite journal|last=Brody|first=Howard|date=2016-08-01|title=Professional medical organizations and commercial conflicts of interest: ethical issues|journal=Annals of Family Medicine|volume=8|issue=4|pages=354–358|doi=10.1370/afm.1140|issn=1544-1717|pmc=2906531|pmid=20644191}}</ref> These donations have been criticized for creating a conflict of interest and favoring an interest such as financial gains.<ref name="Brody 354–358"/>

== Regulation ==
{{See also|Category:Food law}}
Since World War II, agriculture in the United States and the entire national food system in its entirety has been characterized by models that focus on monetary [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] at the expense of social and environmental integrity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schattman|first1=Rachel|title=Sustainable Food Sourcing and Distribution in the Vermont-Regional Food System|url=https://www.uvm.edu/sustainableagriculture/Documents/Schattman_localfoodsourcing.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202005131/https://www.uvm.edu/sustainableagriculture/Documents/Schattman_localfoodsourcing.pdf|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Regulations exist to protect consumers and somewhat balance this economic orientation with public interests for food quality, food security, food safety, animal well-being, environmental protection and health.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Szajkowska|first1=Anna|title=Regulating Food Law: Risk Analysis and the Precautionary Principle as General Principles of EU Food Law|publisher=Wageningen Academic Pub|isbn=9789086861941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Xv0hgss2IEC&pg=PA33|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}</ref>

== Wholesale and distribution ==
[[File:2008-07-24 International truck docked at Duke Hospital South 2.jpg|thumb|A [[foodservice]] truck at a loading dock. Trucks commonly distribute food products to commercial businesses and organizations.]]

(A vast global cargo network connects the numerous parts of the industry.  These include suppliers, manufacturers, warehousers, retailers and the end consumers.) [[Wholesale marketing|Wholesale markets]] for fresh food products have tended to decline in importance in [[urbanization|urbanizing]] countries, including Latin America and some Asian countries as a result of the growth of [[supermarkets]], which procure directly from farmers or through preferred suppliers, rather than going through markets.

The constant and uninterrupted flow of product from distribution centers to store locations is a critical link in food industry operations. Distribution centers run more efficiently, throughput can be increased, costs can be lowered, and manpower better utilized if the proper steps are taken when setting up a [[material handling]] system in a warehouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.groceryheadquarters.com/articles/2009-01-01/Boosting-efficiency-at-the-DC|website=Grocery Headquarters|title=Boosting efficiency at the DC|accessdate=26 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327154126/http://www.groceryheadquarters.com/articles/2009-01-01/Boosting-efficiency-at-the-DC|archive-date=2010-03-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Retail ==

With worldwide [[urbanization]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wup2003/WUP2003.htm |title=World Urbanization Prospects: The 2003 Revision|website= Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (United Nations)}}</ref> food buying is increasingly removed from food production.  During the 20th century, the [[supermarket]] became the defining retail element of the food industry.  There, tens of thousands of products are gathered in one location, in continuous, year-round supply.

Food preparation is another area where the change in recent decades has been dramatic. Today, two food industry sectors are in apparent competition for the retail food dollar.  The grocery industry sells fresh and largely raw products for consumers to use as ingredients in home cooking.  The [[food service]] industry, by contrast, offers prepared food, either as finished products or as partially prepared components for final "assembly".  Restaurants, cafes, bakeries and mobile [[food truck]]s provide opportunities for consumers to purchase food.

== Food industry technologies ==
[[File:Passaic Agricultural Chemical Works. 1876.jpg|thumb|The Passaic Agricultural Chemical Works, an [[agrochemical]] company, in Newark, New Jersey, 1876]]
Modern food production is defined by sophisticated technologies. These include many areas. [[Agricultural machinery]], originally led by the [[tractor]], has practically eliminated human labor in many areas of production. Biotechnology is driving much change, in areas as diverse as [[agrochemical]]s, [[plant breeding]] and food processing. Many other types of technology are also involved, to the point where it is hard to find an area that does not have a direct impact on the food industry. As in other fields, computer technology is also a central force, with computer networks and specialized software providing the support infrastructure to allow global movement of the myriad components involved.
For food to be totally safe, food traceability is of prime importance and this is where blockchain technology is doing wonders. It is all the more necessary since food by its very nature is perishable and when foodborne diseases threaten public health, the first step is to track down the source of contamination through blockchain technology.

== Marketing ==
{{main|Food marketing|Agricultural marketing}}
As consumers grow increasingly removed from food production, the role of product creation, [[advertising]], and publicity become the primary vehicles for information about food. With processed food as the dominant category, marketers have almost infinite possibilities in product creation. Of the food advertised to [[Advertising to children|children]] on [[TV ad|television]] 73% is [[fast food|fast]] or [[convenience foods]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kunkel|first=Dale|year=2009|title=The Impact of Industry Self-Regulation on the Nutritional Quality of Foods Advertised to Children on Television|url=http://lahealthaction.org/library/adstudy09_report.pdf|journal=Children Now}}</ref>

== Labor and education ==
[[File:Tartu Mill 04.jpg|thumb|Some equipment at [[Tartu Mill]], the largest grain milling company in the [[Baltic states]]. Modern food processing factories are often highly automated and need few workers.]]
Until the last 100 years, agriculture was [[labor-intensive]]. Farming was a common occupation and millions of people were involved in food production. Farmers, largely trained from generation to generation, carried on the family business. That situation has changed dramatically today. In America in 1870, 70-80 percent of the US population was employed in agriculture.<ref>[http://www.farmersedge.ca/blog/2013/07/04/neat-facts-about-united-states-agriculture Neat Facts About United States Agriculture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314005120/http://www.farmersedge.ca/blog/2013/07/04/neat-facts-about-united-states-agriculture |date=2014-03-14 }}, Retrieved November 19, 2013</ref> {{As of|2008}}, less than 2 percent of the population is directly employed in agriculture,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_201.htm |title=Employment by major industry sector |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2013-12-19 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/qlinks/extension.html |title=Extension |publisher=Csrees.usda.gov |date=2014-03-28 |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> and about 80% of the population lives in cities. The food industry as a complex whole requires an incredibly wide range of skills. Several hundred occupation types exist within the food industry.
