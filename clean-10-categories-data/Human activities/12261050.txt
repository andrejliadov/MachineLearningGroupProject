'''Games with concealed rules''' are [[game]]s where the [[Game#Rules|rules]] are intentionally concealed from new players, either because their discovery is part of the game itself, or because the game is a hoax and the rules do not exist. In fiction, the counterpart of the first category are games that supposedly do have a rule set, but that rule set is not disclosed.

==Actual games==

===Discovery games===
* [[Eleusis (card game)|Eleusis]]: A card game in which one player secretly decides on a rule which determines which cards may be played on top of each other. The other players then use deductive logic to work out the secret rule.
* [[Haggle (game)|Haggle]]: A party game in which the [[Gamemaster]] divides a set of cards and a subset of the full rules among players and allows them to trade for other cards and rules. 
* [[Mao (card game)|Mao]]: A [[Shedding-type game|shedding-type]] card game where the winner of a round adds a concealed rule of their choice to all subsequent rounds.
* [[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]: A [[tabletop role-playing game]] in which the rules are considered "classified". Only the [[Gamemaster]] has full knowledge of the rules, while other players must deduce them by trial and error as they proceed through the game. (The game acknowledges that players may read the gamemaster section, but ''demonstrating'' knowledge of the rules is considered treasonous, and the gamemaster may also make arbitrary changes.)
*[[Penultima]]: A chess variant in which the spectators make secret rules governing how the pieces move and capture. The two players are unaware of the rules and must discover them by inductive reasoning.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fryers |first1=Michael |year=1998 |title=Penultima |journal=[[Variant Chess]] |volume=3 |issue=28 |pages=164â€“166}}</ref>
* [[Scissors (game)|Scissors]]: A party game in which a pair of scissors is passed between players, with the passer declaring that they are being passed "open" or "closed" based on an individual and secret rule. The other players must use observation to deduce the rule each player uses to make the declaration.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/326383402.html?dids=326383402:326383402&FMT=ABS&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+15%2C+1899&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=TWO+JOLLY+GAMES%2C |title= Two Jolly Games, A Noisy Play Imported From Peru and 'The Spider And The Fly' |date= October 15, 1899 |work= Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 24, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Hofmann |first= Mary Christina |title= Games for Everybody |publisher= Dodge Publishing |location= New York |year= 1905 |url= https://archive.org/stream/games10/games10.txt}}</ref>
* Whose Triangle Is It?: A party game in which one player points to three people or objects, forming an imaginary triangle, and then asks "Whose triangle is it?" The triangle belongs to the person closest to the closest object of a similar color to the color of second point of the triangle, but this rule is not told to new players, and the game is for new players to figure out what the rule is.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.yarps.org/resources/games/mind-games/ |title= Mind Games |work= Yarps |access-date= April 2, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103203/http://www.yarps.org/resources/games/mind-games/ |archive-date= December 24, 2013 |url-status= dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author= Outbound Training |url= http://www.slideshare.net/outboundtraining/team-building-games-outbound-training |title= Team Building Games & Activities |publisher= Slide Share}}</ref>
* [[Zendo (game)|Zendo]]: A game in which one player creates a rule for structures to follow and the other players try to discover the rule by building structures

===Hoax or joke games===
* [[52 Pickup]]: A card game in which dealer scatters the cards on the floor and non-dealer must pick them up.
* [[Mornington Crescent (game)|Mornington Crescent]]: Originally a round in the [[BBC Radio 4]] comedy panel game ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/clue/article/|publisher= BBC |title= I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue: A History |accessdate= July 31, 2007}}</ref> The game consists of each panelist in turn announcing a landmark or street, most often a tube station on the London Underground system. The apparent aim is to be the first to announce "Mornington Crescent", a station on the Northern Line. Despite appearances, however, there are no rules to the game, and both the naming of stations and the specification of "rules" are based on stream-of-consciousness association and improvisation. Thus the game is intentionally incomprehensible.

==Games in works of fiction==

===Games with undisclosed rules===
* [[43-Man Squamish]]: ''MAD Magazine'' published an article outlining a college sport designed to be unplayable. The sport features a pentagonal field, silly-sounding terms and a dummy on each team.
* [[Calvinball]]: In the comic series ''[[Calvin & Hobbes]]'', ''Calvinball'' is a game regularly played by the main characters. The only consistent rule of ''Calvinball'' is that "Calvinball may never be played with the same rules twice".
* [[Double Fanucci]]: Featured in the computer game [[Zork Zero]], ''Double Fanucci'' has mind-bogglingly complex "rules". Legal play can depend on things like the phase of the Moon and the ancestry of the players.
* [[Dragon Poker]]: A fictional card game by [[Robert Asprin]] in the [[MythAdventures]] series. The rules change depending on weather, seating position, time of day, and other undisclosed modifiers. However, a playable version has been created by fans, based on the rules and play that are presented in the books.

===Hoax games===
* [[That Mitchell and Webb Look#Recurring sketches|Numberwang]]: A recurring "game show" on the sketch series ''[[That Mitchell and Webb Look#Recurring sketches|That Mitchell and Webb Look]]''.<ref name="BBC - Numberwang">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thatmitchellandwebbsite/characters/numberwang.shtml |title=BBC - Comedy - That Mitchell And Webb Site - Numberwang |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref> Similar to ''Mornington Crescent'' above, the "contestants" call out random numbers in an attempt to score a "Numberwang", though the responses are scripted and there are no actual rules to winning a "Numberwang".
* Clique: The online satirical gaming magazine ''Critical Miss'' featured rules for a card game called Clique, a parody of collectible card games that used printed cards and spurious spoken rules to confuse onlookers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalmiss.com/issue9/clique1.html|title=Clique: The Uncollectable, Unplayable Card Game|accessdate=September 5, 2007}}</ref>
* [[List of games in Star Trek#Fizzbin|Fizzbin]]: In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "A Piece of the Action", [[James T. Kirk]] created this game while he and [[Spock (Star Trek)|Cmdr. Spock]] were being held prisoner. They "taught" the game to the guards, improvising the rules until their captors were sufficiently distracted, then overpowered them and escaped.
* Cups: In the ''[[Friends]]'' episode "The One on the Last Night", Chandler invents the card game "cups", making up the result of each card turn in an attempt to give Joey money after he refuses a handout. Joey later loses all the money to Ross in another game of cups.
