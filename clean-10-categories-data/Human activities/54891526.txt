==Functions==
The CNS has the following three main functions.

===Communication===
'''C'''ommunication, i.e. [[aviation communication]], refers to communication between two or more aircraft, the exchange of data or verbal information between aircraft and [[air traffic control]] and the ground based communication infrastructure of the ATM network (like the [[aeronautical fixed service]]).<ref name="CNS"/> For [[Continent|continental airspace]], [[Very high frequency|VHF]] (civil) and [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] (military) systems are used whereas for [[Ocean|oceanic areas]], [[high frequency]] systems and [[Communications satellite|SATCOM]]s are used.<ref name="Communication navigation and surveillance"/>

===Navigation===
'''N'''avigation, i.e. [[air navigation]], refers to the process of planning, recording, and controlling the movement of an aircraft from one place to another by providing accurate, reliable and seamless position determination capability.<ref name="CNS"/><ref name='NVPUB9V1'>{{cite book

===Surveillance===
[[Surveillance|'''S'''urveillance]] systems are used by air traffic control to determine the position of aircraft. There are two types of surveillance systems:

====Cooperative systems====
Cooperative systems ([[Pseudonym|a.k.a.]] dependent surveillance): Under this form of surveillance, systems on the ground (such as [[Secondary surveillance radar|SSR]]) communicate with equipment (such as [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponder]]s) on board the aircraft to determine the position and other details of the aircraft. Aircraft information, which may include position from [[GNSS]] or other means is determined on board and then transmitted to [[air traffic control|ATC]] in response to interrogation.<ref name="CNS"/><ref name="Communication navigation and surveillance"/> Other cooperative systems such as [[ADS-B]] rely on aircraft transmitting their position and other information without interrogation from the ground.

====Non-cooperative systems====
Non-cooperative systems (a.k.a. independent surveillance): Under this form of surveillance, systems on the ground (such as [[Primary surveillance radar|PSR]]) are able to locate the aircraft and measure its position from the ground by transmitting pulses of radio waves which reflect off the aircraft's hull.<ref name="CNS"/><ref name="Communication navigation and surveillance"/>
