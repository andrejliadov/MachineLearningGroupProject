In the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] and other [[communist state]]s of the [[Soviet Bloc]], the '''counterplan''' ({{lang-ru|Встречный план}}) was a plan put forth by workers of an enterprise (or its structural unit) to exceed the expectations of the [[planned economy|state plan]] allocated for the enterprise/unit. It was an important part of the [[socialist competition]].<ref name=gse>''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]],'' article "[http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/007/163.htm Встречный план]" {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629043647/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/007/163.htm |date=2008-06-29 }}{{in lang|ru}}</ref>

According to the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', the idea of the counterplan was put forth by the workers of the Karl Marx Plant, [[Leningrad]], in June 1930, during the [[first five-year plan]].<ref name=gse/>

Since the 1960s, counterplans, in the form of obligations as part of [[Socialist emulation]], to execute state plans (annual, quarterly, monthly) ahead of schedule were common in the Soviet Union and other communist states.<ref name=gse/>
