'''Activism''' consists of efforts to promote, impede, direct, or intervene in [[Social change|social]], [[Political campaign|political]], [[Economics|economic]], or [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[reform]] with the desire to make [[Social change|changes in society]] toward a perceived greater good. Forms of activism range from [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] building in the community (including writing letters to newspapers), petitioning [[elected officials]], running or contributing to a [[political campaign]], preferential patronage (or [[boycott]]) of businesses, and demonstrative forms of activism like [[Demonstration (protest)|rallies]], [[Demonstration (people)|street marches]], [[Strike action|strikes]], [[sit-in]]s, or [[hunger strike]]s.

Activism may be performed on a day-to-day basis in a wide variety of ways, including through the creation of art ([[artivism]]), computer hacking ([[hacktivism]]), or simply in how one chooses to spend their money ([[economic activism]]). For example, the refusal to buy clothes or other merchandise from a company as a [[protest]] against the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] by that company could be considered an expression of activism. However, the most highly visible and impactful activism often comes in the form of [[collective action]], in which numerous individuals coordinate an act of protest together in order to make a bigger impact.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Power in Movement: Social Movements and Contentious Politics|last=Tarrow|first=Sidney|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139076807|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=727948411|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/powerinmovements0000tarr}}</ref> Collective action that is purposeful, organized, and sustained over a period of time becomes known as a [[social movement]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Social Movements Reader: Cases and Concepts|last=Goodwin|first=Jeff|last2=Jasper|first2=James|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|isbn=9781405187640|edition=2nd|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/socialmovementsr2edunse}}</ref>

Historically, activists have used literature, including pamphlets, tracts, and books to disseminate or propagate their messages and attempt to persuade their readers of the [[Social justice|justice]] of their cause. Research has now begun to explore how contemporary activist groups use [[social media]] to facilitate [[civic engagement]] and collective action combining [[Politics and technology|politics with technology]].<ref name="Advocacy 2.0">{{cite journal|last= Obar|first= Jonathan|title= Advocacy 2.0: An Analysis of How Advocacy Groups in the United States Perceive and Use Social Media as Tools for Facilitating Civic Engagement and Collective Action|journal= Journal of Information Policy|year= 2012|ssrn= 1956352|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name="Obar">{{Cite journal|last= Obar|first= Jonathan|title= Canadian Advocacy 2.0: A Study of Social Media Use by Social Movement Groups and Activists in Canada|journal= Canadian Journal of Communication|year= 2014|ssrn= 2254742|doi= 10.22230/cjc.2014v39n2a2678|doi-access= free|volume= 39}}

==Definitions of activism==
The ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'' records the English words "activism" and "activist" as in use in the political sense from the year 1920<ref>{{OEtymD|activism|accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref> or 1915<ref>{{OEtymD|activist|accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref> respectively. The history of the word ''activism'' traces back to earlier understandings of [[collective behavior]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to the Science of Sociology|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.107514|last=Park|first=Robert|last2=Burgess|first2=Ernest|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1921 |location=Chicago}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Social Theory and Social Structure|last=Merton|first=Robert|publisher=Free Press|year=1945|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements |last=Hoffer|first=Eric|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1951|location=New York}}</ref> and [[Social action theory|social action]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of Social Action|last=Parsons|first=Talcott|publisher=Free Press|year=1937 |location=New York}}</ref> As late as 1969 ''activism was'' defined as "the policy or practice of doing things with decision and energy", without regard to a political signification, whereas ''social action was'' defined as "organized action taken by a group to improve social conditions", without regard to normative status. Following the surge of so-called "new social movements" in the United States in the 1960s, a new understanding of activism emerged as a rational and acceptable [[Democracy|democratic]] option of [[protest]] or appeal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups|url=https://archive.org/details/logicofcollectiv0124olso|url-access=registration|last=Olson|first= Mancur|publisher= Harvard University Press|year=1965|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Strategy of Social Protest|last=Gamson|first=William A.|publisher=Dorsey Press|year=1975|isbn=9780256016840|location=Homewood, IL|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/strategyofsocial0000gams}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=From Mobilization to Revolution|url=https://archive.org/details/frommobilization00till|url-access=registration|last=Tilly|first=Charles|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1978|location=Reading, Mass.}}</ref> However, the history of the existence of revolt through organized or unified protest in recorded history dates back to the [[Slave rebellion|slave revolts]] of the 1st century BC(E) in the [[Roman Empire]], where under the leadership of former gladiator [[Spartacus]] 6,000 slaves rebelled and were crucified from Capua to [[Rome]] in what became known as the [[Third Servile War]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/spartacus.htm|title=Ancient History: Spartacus and the Slave Rebellion|last=Czech |first=Kenneth P.|date=Apr 1994|website=HistoryNet|access-date=12 August 2018}}</ref>

In English history, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] erupted in response to the imposition of a [[Poll tax riots|poll tax]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Peasants-Revolt|title=Peasants' Revolt|last=Encyclopaedia Britannica|first=Editors of|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=12 August 2018}}</ref> and has been paralleled by other rebellions and revolutions in Hungary, Russia, and more recently, for example, [[Umbrella Revolution|Hong Kong]]. In 1930 under the leadership of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] thousands of protesting Indians participated in the [[Salt March]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url= https://www.britannica.com/event/Salt-March |title = Salt March|encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia Britannica|first = Kenneth|last = Pletcher |date = 14 December 2015}}</ref> as a protest against the oppressive taxes of their government, resulting in the imprisonment of 60,000 people and eventually independence of their nation. In nations throughout Asia, Africa and South America, the prominence of activism organized by [[social movement]]s and especially under the leadership of [[Civil and political rights|civil activists]] or [[social revolution]]aries has pushed for increasing national self-reliance or, in some parts of the developing world, collectivist communist or socialist organization and affiliation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991|url=https://archive.org/details/nootherwayout00jeff|url-access=registration|last= Goodwin |first=Jeff|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|location=Cambridge, UK}}</ref> Activism has had major impacts on Western societies as well, particularly over the past century through social movements such as the [[Labour movement]], the [[Women's rights|Women's Rights movement]], and the [[civil rights movement]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Social Movement Society: Contentious Politics for a New Century|last=Meyer|first=David|last2=Tarrow|first2=Sidney|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |year=1998}}</ref>

==Types of activism==
Activists can function in a number of roles, including judicial, environmental, internet (technological) and design (art). Historically, most activism has focused on creating substantive changes in the policy or practice of a government or industry. Some activists try to persuade people to change their behavior directly (see also [[direct action]]), rather than to persuade governments to change laws. For example, the [[cooperative movement]] seeks to build new institutions which conform to cooperative principles, and generally does not lobby or protest politically. Other activists try to persuade people or government policy to remain the same, in an effort to [[Countermovement|counter change]].

Activism is not an activity always performed by those who profess activism as a profession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.permanentculturenow.com/what-is-activism/|title=Introduction to Activism|publisher=Permanent Culture Now|accessdate=20 December 2011}}</ref> The term ″activist″ may apply broadly to anyone who engages in activism, or narrowly limited to those who choose political or social activism as a vocation or characteristic practice.

=== Judicial and citizen activism ===
[[Judicial activism]] involves the efforts of public officials. [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] - American [[historian]], [[public intellectual]], and [[Social criticism|social critic]] - introduced the term "judicial activism" in a January 1946 [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'' magazine]] article titled "The Supreme Court: 1947".<ref>{{cite journal|first = Keenan D.|last = Kmiec|date = October 2004|journal = California Law Review|title = The Origin and Current Meanings of Judicial Activism|volume = 92|issue = 5|pages = 1441–1478|url = https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1324&context=californialawreview|doi = 10.2307/3481421|jstor = 3481421|access-date = 25 January 2019|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191217052001/https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1324&context=californialawreview|archive-date = 17 December 2019|url-status = dead}}</ref> Activists can also be public [[Consumer organization|watchdogs]] and [[whistle blower]]s, attempting to understand all the actions of every form of government that acts in the name of the people and hold it accountable to oversight and transparency. Activism involves an engaged citizenry.<ref name="pat">{{cite web |url=http://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/2017-02-27/politically-active-4-tips-for-incorporating-self-care |title=Politically Active? 4 Tips for Incorporating Self-Care, US News |date=27 February 2017 |work=US News |accessdate=5 March 2017 }}</ref>

=== Environmental activism ===
{{See also|Environmentalism|List of environmental activists assassinated}}

Environmental activism takes quite a few forms:
* the protection of nature or the natural environment [[Environmentalism#Preservation and conservation|driven by a utilitarian conservation ethic or a nature oriented preservationist ethic]]
* the protection of the human environment (by [[pollution]] prevention or the protection of [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|cultural]] heritage or quality of life)
* the conservation of depletable [[natural resource]]s
* the protection of the function of critical [[Earth system science|earth system]] elements or processes such as the [[climate]].

===Internet activism===
{{Further|Internet activism|Hacktivism|Online social movement|Anonymous (group)|Digital rights|Category:Internet activism|Activism in the tech industry}}
The power of [[Internet Activism|Internet activism]] came into a global lens with the [[Arab Spring]] protests starting in late 2010. People living in the Middle East and North African countries that were experiencing revolutions used social networking to communicate information about protests, including videos recorded on smart phones, which put the issues in front of an international audience.<ref>{{Cite web

}}</ref> This was the one of the first occasions in which social networking technology was used by citizen-activists to circumvent state-controlled media and communicate directly with the rest of the world. These types of practices of Internet activism were later picked up and used by other activists in subsequent mass mobilizations, such as the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M Movement]] in Spain in 2011, [[Gezi Park protests|Occupy Gezi]] in Turkey in 2013, and more.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest|last=Zeynep|first=Tufekci|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780300215120|location=New Haven|oclc=961312425}}</ref>

Internet activism may also refer to activism which focuses on protecting or changing the Internet itself, also known as [[digital rights]]. The Digital Rights movement<ref>{{Cite book|title=The digital rights movement : the role of technology in subverting digital copyright|last=Hector|first=Postigo|date=2012|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262305334|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=812346336}}</ref> consists of activists and organizations, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], who work to protect the rights of people in relation to new technologies, particularly concerning the Internet and other [[Information and communications technology|information and communications technologies]].

=== Activism in literature ===
Activism in literature (not to be confused with [[literary activism]]) includes the expression of intended or advocated reforms, realized or unachieved, through published, written or verbally promoted or communicated forms.

=== Economic activism ===
[[Economic activism]] involves using the economic power of government, consumers, and businesses for social and economic policy change.<ref>Lin, Tom C. W., [https://ssrn.com/abstract=3294317 Incorporating Social Activism] (1 December 2018). 98 Boston University Law Review 1535 (2018)</ref> Both conservative and liberal groups use economic activism to as a form of pressure to influence companies and organizations to oppose or support particular political, religious, or social values and behaviors.<ref>White, Ben and Romm, Tony, [https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/corporate-america-challenges-trump-234704 Corporate America Tackles Trump], Politico, (6 February 2017)</ref> This is typically done either through preferential [[patronage]] to reinforce "good" behavior and support companies one would like to succeed, or through [[boycott]] or [[divestment]] to penalize "bad" behavior and pressure companies to change or go out of business.

[[Brand activism]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Brand Activism: From Purpose to Action |first1=Christian |last1=Sarkar |first2=Philip |last2=Kotler |date=October 2018 |isbn=978-0-9905767-9-2 }}</ref> is the type of activism in which business plays a leading role in the processes of social change. Applying brand activism, businesses show concern for the communities they serve, and their economic, social, and environmental problems, which allows businesses to build sustainable and long-term relationships with the customers and prospects. [[Philip Kotler|Kotler]] and Sarkar defined the phenomenon as an attempt by firms to solve the global problems its future customers and employees care about.<ref>http://www.activistbrands.com/what-is-brand-activism/</ref>

[[Consumer activism]] consists of activism carried out on behalf of [[consumer]]s for [[consumer protection]] or by consumers themselves. For instance, activists in the [[free produce movement]] of the late 1700s protested against [[slavery]] by boycotting goods produced with slave labor. Today, [[vegetarianism]], [[veganism]], and [[freeganism]] are all forms of consumer activism which boycott certain types of products. Other examples of consumer activism include [[simple living]], a minimalist lifestyle intended to reduce [[Economic materialism|materialism]] and [[conspicuous consumption]], and [[tax resistance]], a form of [[direct action]] and [[civil disobedience]] in opposition to the government that is imposing the tax, to government policy, or as [[Taxation as theft|opposition to taxation in itself]].

[[Activist shareholder|Shareholder activism]] involves [[shareholder]]s using an [[Equity (finance)|equity]] stake in a [[corporation]] to put pressure on its [[management]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Tom C. W.|date=2015-03-18|title=Reasonable Investor(s)|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=2579510}}</ref> The goals of activist shareholders range from financial (increase of [[shareholder value]] through changes in corporate policy, financing structure, cost cutting, etc.) to non-financial ([[disinvestment]] from particular countries, adoption of [[environmentalism|environmentally friendly]] policies, etc.).<ref>{{cite web |title=Activist Investor Definition |url=https://www.carriedin.com/activist-investor |website=Carried Interest |accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>

=== Visual Activism ===
Design Activism locates design at the center of promoting social change, raising awareness on social/political issues, or questioning problems associated with mass production and consumerism. Design Activism is not limited to one type of design.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Markussen | first1 = T | year = 2013 | title = The Disruptive Aesthetics of Design Activism: Enacting Design Between Art and Politics | journal = Design Issues | volume = 29 | issue = 1| page = 38 | doi = 10.1162/DESI_a_00195 }}</ref>

Art Activism or [[Artivism]] utilizes the medium of visual art as a method of social or political commentary.

Activists employ many different methods, or tactics, in pursuit of their goals.<ref name=":0" /> Decisions over what tactics to use or not may be planned carefully in advance, result from negotiations with law enforcement such as when and where to hold a rally, or be made in the heat of the moment. The tactics chosen are significant because they can determine how activists are perceived and what they are capable of accomplishing. For example, nonviolent tactics generally tend to garner more public sympathy than violent ones<ref>{{Cite book|title=Nonviolent Social Movements: A Geographical Perspective|last=Zunes|first=Stephen|last2=Asher|first2=Sarah Beth|last3=Kurtz|first3=Lester|date=1999|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=978-1577180753|location=Malden, Mass.|oclc=40753886|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/nonviolentsocial0000unse}}</ref> and are more than twice as effective in achieving stated goals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict|last=Chenoweth|first=Erica|last2=Stephan|first2=Maria J.|author-link1=Erica Chenoweth|author-link2=Maria Stephan|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780231156837|location=New York|oclc=810145714}}</ref>

[[Charles Tilly]] developed the concept of a “[[repertoire of contention]],” which describes the full range of tactics available to activists at a given time and place.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=Contentious Politics|last=Tilly|first=Charles|last2=Tarrow|first2=Sidney|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780190255053|edition= Second revised |location=New York, NY|oclc=909883395}}</ref> This repertoire consists of all of the tactics which have been proven to be successful by activists in the past, such as boycotts, petitions, marches, and sit-ins, and can be drawn upon by any new activists and social movements. Activists may also innovate new tactics of protest.

Many contemporary activists now utilize new tactics through the [[Internet]] and other information and communication technologies (ICTs), also known as [[Internet activism]] or cyber-activism. Some scholars argue that many of these new tactics are digitally analogous to the traditional offline tools of contention.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Future Active: Media Activism and the Internet|last=Meikle|first=Graham|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1864031485|location=Annandale, N.S.W.|oclc=50165391}}</ref> Other digital tactics may be entire new and unique, such as certain types of [[hacktivism]].<ref name=":2"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=Hacktivism and the Future of Political Participation|last=Samuel|first=Alexandra|publisher=Doctoral Dissertation|year=2004|location=Harvard University}}</ref> Together they form a new "digital repertoire of contention" alongside the existing offline one.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Digitally Enabled Social Change: Activism in the Internet Age|last=Earl|first=Jennifer|last2=Kimport|first2=Katrina|publisher=MIT Press|year=2011|isbn=9780262295352|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=727948420}}</ref> The rising use of digital tools and platforms by activists<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rolfe|first=Brett|date=2005|title=Building an Electronic Repertoire of Contention|journal=Social Movement Studies|volume=4|issue=1|pages=65–74|doi=10.1080/14742830500051945|issn=1474-2837|citeseerx=10.1.1.457.9077}}</ref> has also increasingly led to the creation of decentralized networks of activists that are self-organized<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=Christian|date=2006|title=The Self-Organization of Social Movements|journal=Systemic Practice and Action Research|volume=19|issue=1|pages=101–137|doi=10.1007/s11213-005-9006-0|issn=1094-429X}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing without Organizations|last=Clay|first=Shirky|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2008|isbn=9781594201530|location=New York|oclc=168716646|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/herecomeseverybo0000shir}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Networks of Outrage and Hope: Social Movements in the Internet Age|last=Castells|first=Manuel|publisher=Polity|year=2015|isbn=9780745695754|edition= 2nd|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=896126968}}</ref> and [[Leaderless resistance|leaderless]],<ref name=":1"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Leaderless Revolution: How Ordinary People will Take Power and Change Politics in the 21st Century|last=Carne|first=Ross|publisher=Plume|year=2013|isbn=9780452298941|location=New York|oclc=795168105}}</ref> or what is known as [[franchise activism]].

==Activism industry==
Some groups and organizations participate in activism to such an extent that it can be considered as an industry. In these cases, activism is often done full-time, as part of an organization's [[core business]]. Many organizations in the activism industry are either [[non-profit|non-profit organizations]] or [[non-governmental organization]]s with specific aims and objectives in mind. Most activist organizations do not manufacture goods,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} but rather mobilize personnel to recruit funds and gain media coverage.

The term ''activism industry'' has often been used to refer to outsourced [[fundraising]] operations. However, activist organizations engage in other activities as well.<ref>{{cite web|first =Dana R.|last = Fisher|url = https://prospect.org/article/activism-industry|title =  The Activism Industry|url-status =live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205162211/http://prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=11993 |archive-date= 5 December 2010|website = [[The American Prospect]]|date=14 September 2006}}</ref> [[Lobbying]], or the influencing of decisions made by government, is another activist tactic. Many groups, including law firms, have designated staff assigned specifically for lobbying purposes. In the United States, lobbying is regulated by the federal government.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110711095632/http://www.gklaw.com/publication.cfm?publication_id=724 New Federal Lobbying Law Reporting Periods Begin]</ref>

Many government systems encourage public support of non-profit organizations by granting various forms of [[income tax|tax]] relief for donations to [[charitable organization]]s. Governments may attempt to deny these benefits to activists by restricting the political activity of tax-exempt organizations.
