'''Killed in action''' ('''KIA''') is a [[Casualty (person)|casualty]] classification generally used by [[Military|militaries]] to describe the deaths of their own [[combatants]] at the hands of hostile forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Department of Defense Dictionary: killed in action|url=http://ww.dtc.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/k/03003.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927022355/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/data/k/03003.html|archive-date=2012-09-27|access-date=2007-02-04}}</ref> The [[United States Department of Defense]], for example, says that those declared KIA need not have fired their weapons but have been killed due to hostile attack. KIAs include those killed by [[friendly fire]] in the midst of combat, but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes, murder and other non-hostile events or terrorism. KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval, air and support troops. Someone who is killed in action during a particular event is denoted with a {{font|text=†|font=times|size=120%}} ([[Dagger (typography)|dagger]]) beside their name to signify their death in that event or events.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Further, KIA denotes a person to have been killed in action on the battlefield whereas '''died of wounds''' ('''DOW''') relates to someone who survived to reach a medical treatment facility. The [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) also uses DWRIA, rather than DOW, for "died of wounds received in action". However, historically, militaries and historians have used the former acronym.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

'''PKIA''' means '''presumed killed in action'''. This term is used when personnel are lost in battle, initially listed [[missing in action]] (MIA), but after not being found, are later presumed to have not survived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/ddg69/Pages/namesake.aspx|title=USS Milius — Named in honor of Navy pilot Captain Paul L.

A very large number of soldiers killed in action went unidentified in [[World War I]], like the son of British poet [[Rudyard Kipling]], prompting the formation of the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]].<ref name="John">{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Jonathan |title=The Great War and its aftermath: The son who haunted Kipling |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/the-great-war-and-its-aftermath-the-son-who-haunted-kipling-413795.html |access-date=3 May 2018 |work=The Independent |date=28 August 2006}}</ref>
