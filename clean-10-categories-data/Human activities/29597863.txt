'''Agricultural astrology''', a type of [[electional astrology]] for [[gardening]] and for [[horticulture]], advises scheduling the planting, cultivating and harvesting of crops based on [[Lunar phase |moon phases]] and on [[astrological sign]]s. Agricultural astrology is often referred to as "planting by the signs" because of its reliance on astrological signs for planting, cultivating and harvesting.<ref name="Lewis11-12">Lewis 2003, p. 11-12</ref>

The ''[[Old Farmer's Almanac]]'' regularly features a "planting by the signs" section.<ref name="Lewis13">

==History==
Agricultural astrology is one of the oldest forms of astrology. It was probably one of the first use humans made of [[lunar cycle]]s.<ref name="Oken16">Oken 2006, p. 16</ref> Evidence of its practice dates back thousands of years to the ancient peoples of the [[Nile River|Nile]] and [[Euphrates River|Euphrates]] River valleys. Farmers of these civilizations planted by the Moon's phase and its sign in the zodiac.<ref name="Llewellyn83">Llewellyn 2004, p. 83</ref> There is a lack of [[scientific evidence]] proving the beneficial effects of astrological gardening. A few studies have been conducted, but "none of this has been conclusively proven or disproved by modern science".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hendry.ifas.ufl.edu/HCHortNews_AstroGardening.htm |title=Planting by the Moon and Signs, University of Florida |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112101630/http://hendry.ifas.ufl.edu/HCHortNews_AstroGardening.htm |archivedate=2017-11-12}}</ref>

==Other uses==
Although agricultural astrology is primarily used as a guide for growing crops, it also has been applied to the practice of [[animal husbandry]]. For example, agricultural astrology encourages [[Poultry farming|poultry farmers]] to set up their chicken's eggs to hatch when it is a [[new moon]] and in a "fruitful" sign. It claims that chicks hatched during this time grow faster and produce more offspring.<ref name="Llewellyn91">Llewellyn 2004, p. 91</ref>

Moon gardeners maintain that not only is science on their side, but also that the results are plain to see. According to the theory, plants that are sown in the few days before a full moon become stronger and more productive. The moon gardeners claim that the [[Gravitation|gravitational force]] of the full moon affects the [[Tide|level of groundwater]] in the soil, just as it does the level of the oceans. The phases of the moon do not correspond to the distance of the moon's orbit around the Earth, and hence are not indicators of the strength of the moon's gravitational pull. Instead, apogee and perigee of the moon's orbit are what determines the moon's distance to the Earth. Also, the increase in [[moonlight]] between the [[new moon]] and [[full moon]] ([[lunar phase|waxing phase]]) are thought to stimulate leaf growth,<ref>[http://tipsplants.com/community/growing-plants/about-planting-moon Planting by the Moon | Tipsplants.com]</ref> when the light decreases between the full moon and new moon ([[Lunar_phase#Waxing_and_waning|waning phase]]) the plant's energy is then thought to be focused on the roots.<ref>[https://www.astrocal.co.uk/the-moon/planting-by-the-moon/ Waxing-Waning Moon | Astrocal.co.uk]</ref> Each [[astrological sign]] has its own corresponding element (earth, air, fire, water) and the most favorable times for planting above ground leafy crops is said to be when the Moon is in the leaf/water signs ([[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]]) and the underground root crops when the Moon is in the root/earth signs ([[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]).<ref>[https://www.gardeningbythemoon.com/signs-best-planting-days/ Best Planting Days: the Influence of the Astrological Moon Signs | gardeningbythemoon.com]</ref>

One of the more notable sources to rely upon this methodology is the annual ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'', which bases its Gardening by the Moon Calendar on the concept of agricultural astrology.
