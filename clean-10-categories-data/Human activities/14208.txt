The Holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as [[megafauna]], starting at the end of the [[last glacial period]]. Megafauna outside of the African mainland (thus excluding [[#Madagascar|Madagascar]]), which did not evolve alongside humans, proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new [[predation]], and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the Earth<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/au-wht082015.php |title=Without humans, the whole world could look like Serengeti |website=EurekAlert! |access-date=August 16, 2020 |quote=The existence of Africa's many species of mammals is thus not due to an optimal climate and environment, but rather because it is the only place where they have not yet been eradicated by humans.

The most popular theory is that human overhunting of species added to existing stress conditions as the extinction coincides with human emergence. Although there is debate regarding how much human predation affected their decline, certain population declines have been directly correlated with human activity, such as the extinction events of [[List of extinct animals of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[List of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]]. Aside from humans, [[Climate variability and change|climate change]] may have been a driving factor in the megafaunal extinctions, especially at the end of the Pleistocene.

Ecologically, humanity has been noted as an unprecedented "global superpredator"<ref name=":4"/> that consistently preys on the adults of other [[apex predator]]s, and has [[human impact on the environment|worldwide effect]]s on [[food web]]s. There have been extinctions of species on every [[land mass]] and in every [[ocean]]: there are many famous examples [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|within Africa]], [[List of Asian animals extinct in the Holocene|Asia]], [[List of extinct animals of Europe|Europe]], [[List of extinct animals of Australia|Australia]], [[List of North American animals extinct in the Holocene|North]] and [[List of South American animals extinct in the Holocene|South America]], and on smaller islands. Overall, the Holocene extinction can be linked to the [[human impact on the environment]].

Recent research, based on [[archeology|archaeological]] and [[paleontology|paleontological]] digs on 70 different Pacific islands has shown that numerous species became extinct as people moved across the Pacific, starting 30,000 years ago in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] and [[Solomon Islands]].<ref>{{harvnb|Steadman|Martin|2003}}</ref> It is currently estimated that among the bird species of the Pacific, some 2000 species have gone extinct since the arrival of humans, representing a 20% drop in the biodiversity of birds worldwide.<ref>{{harvnb|Steadman|1995}}</ref>

The [[Ancient Hawaii|first settlers]] are thought to have arrived in the islands between 300 and 800 CE, with European arrival in the 16th century. Hawaii is notable for its [[Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands|endemism]] of plants, [[Endemic birds of Hawaii|birds]], insects, mollusks and [[List of fish of Hawaii|fish]]; 30% of its organisms are endemic.

[[Australia]] was once home to a [[Australian megafauna|large assemblage of megafauna]], with many parallels to those found on the African continent today. Australia's fauna is characterised by primarily [[marsupial]] mammals, and many reptiles and birds, all existing as giant forms until recently. [[Indigenous Australians|Humans]] arrived on the continent very early, about 50,000 years ago.<ref name=":0" /> The extent human arrival contributed is controversial; climatic drying of Australia 40,000–60,000 years ago was an unlikely cause, as it was less severe in speed or magnitude than previous regional climate change which failed to kill off megafauna.

[[New Zealand]] is characterised by its [[geographic isolation]] and [[Insular biogeography|island biogeography]], and had been isolated from mainland Australia for 80 million years. It was the last large land mass to be colonised by humans.

With them, the Europeans brought [[Black rat|ship rat]]s, possums, cats and mustelids which decimated native bird life, some of which had adapted [[Flightless bird|flightlessness]] and ground nesting habits and others had no defensive behavior as a result of having no extant [[endemic]] mammalian predators.

There has been a debate as to the extent to which the disappearance of [[megafauna]] at the end of the last [[glacial period]] can be attributed to human activities by hunting, or even by slaughter<ref>This may refer to groups of animals endangered by climate change. For example, during a catastrophic drought, remaining animals would be gathered around the few remaining watering holes, and thus become extremely vulnerable.</ref> of prey populations.

There likely would have been human settlements prior to the Clovis Culture, and the history of [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|humans in the Americas]] may extend back many thousands of years before the Clovis culture.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The amount of correlation between human arrival and megafauna extinction is still being debated: for example, in [[Wrangel Island]] in Siberia the extinction of dwarf [[woolly mammoth]]s (approximately 2000 BCE)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = P.S. | year = 1995 | title = Mammoth Extinction: Two Continents and Wrangel Island | journal = Radiocarbon | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 7–10 | doi=10.1017/s0033822200014739| doi-access = free }}</ref> did not coincide with the arrival of humans, nor did megafaunal mass extinction on the South American continent, although it has been suggested climate changes induced by anthropogenic effects elsewhere in the world may have contributed.<ref name=":0" />

Comparisons are sometimes made between recent extinctions (approximately since the [[industrial revolution]]) and the Pleistocene extinction near the end of the last [[glacial period]]. The latter is exemplified by the extinction of large herbivores such as the [[woolly mammoth]] and the carnivores that preyed on them. Humans of this era actively hunted the [[mammoth]] and the [[mastodon]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pitulko | first1 = V. V. | last2 = Nikolsky | first2 = P. A. | last3 = Girya | first3 = E.

The ecosystems encountered by the first Americans had not been exposed to human interaction, and may have been far less resilient to human made changes than the ecosystems encountered by industrial era humans. Therefore, the actions of the Clovis people, despite seeming insignificant by today's standards could indeed have had a profound effect on the ecosystems and wild life which was entirely unused to human influence.<ref name=":0" />

====Afroeurasia====

A 2020 study published in ''[[Science Advances]]'' found that human population size and/or specific human activities, not climate change, caused rapidly rising global mammal extinction rates during the past 126,000 years. Around 96% of all mammalian extinctions over this time period are attributable to human impacts. According to Tobias Andermann, lead author of the study, "these extinctions did not happen continuously and at constant pace. Instead, bursts of extinctions are detected across different continents at times when humans first reached them. More recently, the magnitude of human driven extinctions has picked up the pace again, this time on a global scale."<ref>{{cite news |title=Humans, not climate, have driven rapidly rising mammal extinction rate |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-09-humans-climate-driven-rapidly-mammal.html |access-date=9 October 2020 |work=phys.org |language=en}}</ref><ref name="rapidrise"/>

====Megafaunal extinction====
Megafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem, tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance. They do so by their movement between the time they consume the nutrient and the time they release it through elimination (or, to a much lesser extent, through decomposition after death).<ref name="Wolf2013">{{cite journal|last1=Wolf|first1=A.|last2=Doughty|first2=C.

Large populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of [[methane]], which is an important [[greenhouse gas]]. Modern [[ruminant]] [[herbivores]] produce methane as a byproduct of [[foregut fermentation]] in digestion, and release it through belching or flatulence. Today, around 20% of annual [[methane emissions]] come from livestock methane release. In the [[Mesozoic]], it has been estimated that [[sauropod]]s could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually,<ref name = "Wilkinson">{{cite journal|last1=Wilkinson|first1=D.

After early humans migrated to the Americas about 13,000 [[Before Present|BP]], their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there. Calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 9.6 million tons per year. This suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the [[Younger Dryas]].<ref name = "Smith"/> The decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time, as recorded in [[ice core]]s, was 2–4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years, suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work.<ref name = "Smith"/>

=== Disease ===

The hyperdisease hypothesis, proposed by Ross MacPhee in 1997, states that the megafaunal die-off was due to an indirect transmission of diseases by newly arriving [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal humans]].<ref name="MacPhee&Marx1997">{{cite book |author1=MacFee, R.D.E.  |author2=Marx, P.A.  |name-list-style=amp | year = 1997 |chapter= Humans, hyperdisease and first-contact extinctions |title=Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar |editor= Goodman, S. |editor2=Patterson, B.D. | location = Washington D.C. | publisher = Smithsonian Press | pages = 169–217 | isbn = 978-1-56098-683-6}}</ref><ref name="MacPhee&Marx1998">{{cite web |author1=MacFee, R.D.E.  |author2=Marx, P.A.  |name-list-style=amp | year = 1998 | title = Lightning Strikes Twice: Blitzkrieg, Hyperdisease, and Global Explanations of the Late Quaternary Catastrophic Extinctions | publisher = American Museum of Natural History | url = http://www.amnh.biz/science/biodiversity/extinction/Day1/bytes/MacPheePres.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference| first = Ross D.E.| last = MacPhee|author2=Marx, Preston | title = The 40,000-year Plague: Humans, Hyperdisease, and First-Contact Extinctions| book-title = Natural Change and Human Impact in Madagascar| pages = 169–217| publisher = Smithsonian Institution Press| year = 1997| location = Washington, D.C.}}</ref> According to MacPhee, aboriginals or animals travelling with them, such as [[domestic dog]]s or livestock, introduced one or more highly [[virulent]] diseases into new environments whose native population had no immunity to them, eventually leading to their extinction. [[K-selection]] animals, such as the now-extinct megafauna, are especially vulnerable to diseases, as opposed to [[r-selection]] animals who have a shorter [[gestation period]] and a higher population size. Humans are thought to be the sole cause as other earlier migrations of animals into North America from Eurasia did not cause extinctions.<ref name="MacPhee&Marx1997"/>

There are many problems with this theory, as this disease would have to meet several criteria: it has to be able to sustain itself in an environment with no [[host (biology)|hosts]]; it has to have a high [[infection rate]]; and be extremely lethal, with a [[mortality rate]] of 50–75%. Disease has to be very virulent to kill off all the individuals in a [[genus]] or [[species]], and even such a virulent disease as [[West Nile fever]] is unlikely to have caused extinction.<ref name="Lyons et al2004">{{cite journal |last1=Lyons|first1=K.|last2=Smith|first2=F.

Most recently, insect populations have experienced rapid surprising declines. Insects have declined at an annual rate of 2.5% over the last 25–30 years. The most severe effects may include Puerto Rico, where [[Insect collecting#Collecting techniques|insect ground fall]] has declined by 98% in the previous 35 years. Butterflies and moths are experiencing some of the most severe effect. Butterfly species have declined by 58% on farmland in England. In the last ten years, 40% of insect species and 22% of mammal species have disappeared. Germany is experiencing a 75% decline. Climate change and agriculture are believed to be the most significant contributors to the change.<ref name="plummet222">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature |author=Damien Carrington |title=Plummeting insect numbers 'threaten collapse of nature' |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 February 2019 }}</ref>

Rising levels of carbon dioxide are resulting in influx of this gas into the ocean, increasing its acidity.

The report offers several policy options to reduce such risk, such as taxing [[meat]] production and consumption, cracking down on the illegal wildlife trade, removing high disease-risk species from the legal wildlife trade, and eliminating subsidies to businesses which are harmful to the environment.<ref name="Damien 102020">{{cite news |last=Carrington |first=Damian |date=October 29, 2020 |title=Protecting nature is vital to escape 'era of pandemics' – report |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/29/protecting-nature-vital-pandemics-report-outbreaks-wild |work=The Guardian |access-date=November 28, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Mcelwee |first=Pamela |date=November 2, 2020 |title=COVID-19 and the biodiversity crisis |url=https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/523944-covid-19-and-the-biodiversity-crisis |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date=November 28, 2020}}</ref><ref name="IPBESPandemic">{{cite web |url=https://ipbes.net/pandemics |title=Escaping the 'Era of Pandemics': Experts Warn Worse Crises to Come Options Offered to Reduce Risk |author=<!--Not stated-->|date=2020|publisher=[[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services]]|access-date=November 28, 2020}}</ref> According to marine zoologist John Spicer, "the Covid-19 crisis is not just another crisis alongside the biodiversity crisis and the climate change crisis.
