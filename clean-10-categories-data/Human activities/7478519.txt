A '''Book of Remembrance''' is a book commemorating those who have died, usually listing their names in date or alphabetical order. They are often compiled to commemorate war dead and others who have died on military operations, but may also commemorate those buried in a cemetery.<ref>[https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/memorials/books/history (2019, April 3).
