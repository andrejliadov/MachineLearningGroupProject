==Motivation of perpetrators==
The intention of the attacker is often to humiliate rather than to kill the victim. In Britain, such attacks, particularly those against men, are believed to be underreported, and as a result many of them do not show up in official statistics.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Some of the most common motivations of perpetrators include:
* Personal conflict regarding intimate relationships and sexual rejection<ref name="auto">{{cite journal|title=DEFINE_ME_WA|journal=The Lancet|volume=376|issue=9748|pages=1209–10| doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61863-6|pmid=20941859|year=2010|last1=Solberg|first1=Kristin|s2cid=34192666}}</ref><ref name=10a /> 
* Racial motivations{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}
* Sexual-related jealousy and lust<ref name="archive.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206231722/http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 February 2017|date=6 February 2017}}</ref>
* Social, political, and religious motivations
* Gang violence and rivalry{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}
* Anti-minority discrimination{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}
* Conflicts over land ownership, farm animals, housing, and property<ref name=Bahl_Syed/>
* Revenge for refusal of sexual advances, proposals of [[marriage]], and demands for [[dowry]]<ref name="Bandyopadhyay_Khan" />

Acid attacks often occur as revenge against a woman who rejects a proposal of marriage or a sexual advance.<ref name="bbc.com">{{cite news | last = de Castella | first = Tom | title=How many acid attacks are there? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23631395 | work=[[BBC News]] | date=9 August 2013 |access-date=20 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=6a>{{cite journal|last=Mannan|first=A.|author2=S.

Attacks against individuals based on their religious beliefs or social or political activities also occur. These attacks may be targeted against a specific individual, due to their activities, or may be perpetrated against random persons merely because they are part of a social group or community.

Additionally, anecdotal evidence for acid attacks exists in other regions of the world such as [[South America]], [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Central Asia]].<ref name=13a /> However, [[South Asia]]n countries maintain the highest incidence of acid attacks.<ref name=12a2 />

Police in the United Kingdom have noted that many victims are afraid to come forward to report attacks, meaning the true scale of the problem may be unknown.<ref name=telegraph_policestats>{{cite news|title=True scale of acid attacks hidden as victims too scared to come forward, police say|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/22/partner-towie-star-wanted-nightclub-acid-attack-thought-have/|date=22 April 2017}}</ref>

==Gender==
An accurate estimate of the gender ratio of victims and perpetrators is difficult to establish because many acid attacks are not reported or recorded by authorities. For example, a 2010 study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' described that there are "no reliable statistics" on the prevalence of acid attacks in [[Pakistan]].<ref name="auto"/>

A 2007 literature review analyzed 24 studies in 13 countries over the past 40 years, covering 771 cases.<ref name=3a/> According to the London-based charity [[Acid Survivors Trust International]], 80% of acid attacks are on women, and acid assaults are grossly under-estimated. In some regions, assaults perpetrated on female victims by males are often driven by the mentality "If I can't have you, no one shall."<ref>Bhalla, Nita (9 July 2013) [http://www.trust.org/item/20130709160626-j5dfo/?source=dpagehead India's top court says gov't not trying to stop acid attacks]. ''Thomson Reuters Foundation''</ref>

In Bangladesh, throwing acid has been labeled as a "gender crime", as there is a dominance of female victims who are assaulted by males, for the reason of refusing to marry, or refusing sexual advances.<ref name="kln.ac.lk">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.burns.2006.05.002|pmid=17095164|url=http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206231722/http://www.kln.ac.lk/medicine/depts/forensic/images/stories/ques_1/chemical_assaults_worldwide.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-02-06|title=Cases of chemical assault worldwide: A literature review|journal=Burns|volume=33|issue=2|pages=149–54|year=2007|last1=Mannan|first1=Ashim|last2=Ghani|first2=Samuel|last3=Clarke|first3=Alex|last4=Butler|first4=Peter E.M.}}
</ref> In Jamaica, women throwing acid on other women in relation to fights over male partners is a common cause.<ref name="kln.ac.lk"/> In the UK, the majority of victims are men, and many of these attacks are related to gang violence.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Another factor that puts victims at increased risk for an acid assault is their [[socioeconomic status]], as those living in [[poverty]] are more likely to be attacked.<ref name=2a /><ref name=12a2 /> {{as of|2013}}, the three nations with the most noted incidence of acid attacks – Bangladesh, India, and Cambodia – were ranked 75th, 101st, and 104th, respectively, out of 136 countries on the [[Global Gender Gap]] Index, a scale that measures equality in opportunities between men and women in nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2013.pdf|title=The Global Gender Gap report|website=3.weforum.org|year=2013}}</ref>

In Uganda, 57% of acid assault victims were female and 43% were male.<ref name=10a /> A study focusing on chemical burns in Nigeria revealed a reversal in findings–60% of the acid attack patients were male while 40% were female.<ref name="159a"/> In both nations, younger individuals were more likely to suffer from an acid attack: the average age in the Nigeria study was 20.6 years,<ref name="159a"/> while Ugandan analysis shows 59% of survivors were 19–34 years of age.<ref name=10a />

Motivation for acid assault in these African countries is similar to that of [[Cambodia]]. Relationship conflicts caused 35% of acid attacks in Uganda in 1985–2011, followed by property conflicts at 8%, and business conflicts at 5%.<ref name=10a /> Disaggregated data was not available in the Nigeria study, but they reported that 71% of acid assaults resulted from an argument with either a jilted lover, family member, or business partner.<ref name="159a"/> As with the other nations, researchers believe these statistics to be under-representative of the actual scope and magnitude of acid attacks in African nations.<ref name=10a />

In August 2013, two Jewish women volunteer teachers—Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup from the UK—were injured by an acid attack by men on a moped near Stone Town in [[Tanzania]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/zanzibar-acid-attack-recap-updates-2143076|title=Zanzibar acid attack: Recap updates as British teenagers Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup land back in Britain|date=2013-08-09|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|access-date=2013-09-21}}</ref>

Acid attacks are often referred to as a "[[crime of passion]]", fueled by jealousy and revenge.<ref name=3a /> Actual cases though, show that they are usually the result of rage at a woman who rebuffs the advances of a male. For the country of Bangladesh, such passion is often rooted in [[marriage]] and relationships. One study showed that refusal of [[marriage proposal]]s accounted for 55% of acid assaults, with abuse from a husband or other family member (18%), property disputes (11%) and refusal of sexual or romantic advances (2%) as other leading causes.<ref name="6a"/> Additionally, the use of acid attacks in dowry arguments has been reported in Bangladesh,<ref name=2a /> with 15% of cases studied by the [[Acid Survivors Foundation]] citing dowry disputes as the motive.<ref name=12a2 /> The chemical agents most commonly used to commit these attacks are [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sulfuric acid]].<ref name=Anwary1>{{Cite journal | last = Anwary | first = Afroza | date = 2002 | title = Acid Violence And Medical Care In Bangladesh: Women's Activism as Carework |journal= Gender & Society | pages = 305–313 | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1177/0891243202250851| s2cid = 73403974 }}</ref>

Though comprehensive statistics on acid attacks in [[South America]] are sparse, a recent study investigating acid assault in [[Bogota]], [[Colombia]], provides some insight for this region. According to the article, the first identified survivor of acid violence in Bogota was attacked in 1998. Since then reported cases have been increasing with time. The study also cited the Colombian Forensics Institute, which reported that 56 women complained of aggression by acid in 2010, 46 in 2011, and 16 during the first trimester of 2012. The average age of survivors was about 23 years old, but ranged from 13 to 41 years.<ref name=15a>{{cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Linda|title=Burns due to acid assaults in Bogotá, Colombia|journal=Burns|date=October 2012|pages=1018–1023|doi=10.1016/j.burns.2012.10.022|pmid=23260999|volume=39|issue=5}}</ref>

The study reported a male:female victim ratio of 1:30 for acid assault in Bogota, Colombia, although recent reports show the ratio is closer to 1:1.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.las2orillas.co/hay-456-hombres-en-colombia-que-tambien-son-natalia-ponce/ | work=las2orillas | title=Hay 456 hombres en Colombia que también son Natalia Ponce | date=2014-04-10 | access-date=2015-12-02}}</ref> Reasons behind these attacks usually stemmed from poor interpersonal relationships and domestic intolerance toward women. Moreover, female victims usually came from low [[socioeconomic class]]es and had low education. The authors state that the prevalence of acid attacks in other areas of South America remains unknown due to significant underreporting.<ref name=15a />

On March 27, 2014, a woman named [[Natalia Ponce de León]] was assaulted by Jonathan Vega, who threw a liter of [[sulphuric acid]] on her face and body.

The new law, which is named after her, defines acid attacks as a specific crime and increases [[Sentence (law)|maximum sentences]] to 50 years in jail for convicted offenders.<ref name="dailyrecord3"/> The law also aims to provide victims with better state medical care including reconstructive surgery and psychological therapy.

===Vietnam===
Acid attacks are rare in Vietnam. An example of an acid attack in Vietnam is the Ho Chi Minh City acid attack where four people were injured.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/society/20171023/intl-school-accountant-victim-of-acid-attack-in-ho-chi-minh-city/42214.html|title=Int'l school accountant victim of acid attack in Ho Chi Minh City|work=Tuoi Tre News|access-date=2018-03-29|language=vi-VN}}</ref> Most of Vietnam's acid attack victims spend their lives isolated and ignored and also blamed for their agony.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://e.vnexpress.net/news/travel-life/vietnam-s-brutal-acid-attack-epidemic-3685509.html|title=Vietnam's brutal acid attack epidemic|work=VnExpress International|access-date=2018-03-29|language=EN}}</ref>

==Health effects==
The most notable effect of an acid attack is the lifelong bodily disfigurement. According to the [[Acid Survivors Foundation]] in [[Pakistan]], there is a high survival rate amongst victims of acid attacks. Consequently, the victim is faced with physical challenges, which require long-term surgical treatment, as well as psychological challenges, which require in-depth intervention from [[psychologist]]s and counselors at each stage of physical recovery.<ref name=ASF>{{cite web|last=Khan|first=Adnan|title=The real miracle workers fighting, and healing, Pakistan's acid attacks|url=http://acidsurvivorspakistan.org/|publisher=Acid Survivors Foundation, Pakistan|date=Apr 21, 2012|access-date=24 May 2012}}</ref> These far-reaching effects on their lives impact their psychological, social, and economic viability in communities.<ref name=11a />

===Medical===
The medical effects of acid attacks are extensive. As a majority of acid attacks are aimed at the face,<ref name="3a" /> several articles thoroughly reviewed the medical implications for these victims. The severity of the damage depends on the [[concentration]] of the acid and the time before the acid is thoroughly washed off with water or [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralized]] with a neutralizing agent. The acid can rapidly eat away skin, the layer of fat beneath the skin, and in some cases even the underlying bone. Eyelids and lips may be completely destroyed and the nose and ears severely damaged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cequinindia.org/pdf/Special_Reports/Acid%20Throwing.pdf|title=Gender-Based Violence In Public Places: Acid Throwing|author=Keerthi Bollineni|publisher=[[Centre for Equality and Inclusion]]|access-date=2012-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526012923/http://cequinindia.org/pdf/Special_Reports/Acid%20Throwing.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Though not exhaustive, Acid Survivors Foundation Uganda findings included:<ref name="10a" />
* The [[skull]] is partly destroyed/deformed and hair lost.
* [[Ear]] cartilage is usually partly or totally destroyed; [[deafness]] may occur.
* [[Eyelids]] may be burned off or deformed, leaving the [[eye]]s extremely dry and prone to [[blindness]]. Acid directly in the eye also damages [[eyesight|sight]], sometimes causing blindness in both eyes.
* The [[nose]] can become shrunken and deformed; the [[nostril]]s may close off completely due to destroyed [[cartilage]].
* The [[mouth]] becomes shrunken and narrow, and it may lose its full range of motion. Sometimes, the [[lip]]s may be partly or totally destroyed, exposing the [[teeth]]. Eating and speaking can become difficult.
* [[Scar]]s can run down from the [[chin]] to [[neck]] area, shrinking the chin and extremely limiting [[range of motion]] in the neck.
* [[Inhalation]] of acid vapors usually creates [[respiratory]] problems, exacerbated restricted [[airway]] pathways (the [[esophagus]] and [[nostril]]s) in acid patients.

In addition to these above-mentioned medical effects, acid attack victims face the possibility of [[sepsis]], [[kidney failure]], skin [[depigmentation]], and even death.<ref name="159a"/>

A 2015 attack that involved throwing sulfuric acid on a man's face and body while he lay in bed caused him, among other serious injuries, to become paralyzed from the neck down.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/23/berlinah-wallace-jailed-years-sadistic-acid-attack-mark-van-dongen|title=Berlinah Wallace jailed for life for 'sadistic' acid attack on Mark van Dongen|first=Steven|last=Morris|date=23 May 2018|via=www.theguardian.com|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

===Psychological===
Acid assault survivors face many [[mental health]] issues upon recovery. One study showed that when compared to published Western [[norm (social)|norms]] for psychological well-being, non-Caucasian acid attack victims reported higher levels of [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and scored higher on the Derriford appearance scale, which measures [[psychological distress]] due to one's concern for their appearance. Additionally, female victims reported lowered [[self-esteem]] according to the [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale|Rosenberg scale]] and increased [[self-consciousness]], both in general and in the social sphere.<ref name=6a />

===Social===
In addition to medical and psychological effects, many social implications exist for acid survivors, especially women.<ref name=10a /> For example, such attacks usually leave victims [[handicapped]] in some way, rendering them dependent on either their spouse or family for everyday activities, such as eating and running errands. These dependencies are increased by the fact that many acid survivors are not able to find suitable work, due to impaired vision and [[Physical disability|physical handicap]]. This negatively impacts their economic viability, causing hardships on the families/spouses that care for them. As a result, divorce rates are high, with abandonment by husbands found in 25% of acid assault cases in [[Uganda]] (compared to only 3% of wives abandoning their disfigured husbands).<ref name=10a /> Moreover, acid survivors who are single when attacked almost certainly become [[social rejection|ostracized]] from society, effectively ruining marriage prospects.<ref name=2a /> Some media outlets overwhelmingly avoid reporting acid attack violence, or the description of the attack is laconic or often implies that the act was inevitable or even justified.<ref>Sarah Halim and Marian Meyers (2010), ''News Coverage of Violence Against Muslim Women: A View From the Arabian Gulf'', Communication, Culture & Critique. Volume 3, Issue 1, pages 85–104, March 2010</ref>

==Treatment and consequences==
When acids contact the skin, response time is crucial. If washed away with water or neutralized promptly, burns to skin can be minimized or avoided entirely, although areas unprotected by skin, like the [[cornea]] of the eye or the lips, can be burned immediately on contact. However, many victims are attacked in an area without immediate access to water, or unable to see due to being blinded or forced to keep their eyes closed to prevent additional burns to the eye.

Treatment for burn victims remains inadequate in many [[developing nation]]s where incidence is high. Medical underfunding has resulted in very few [[burn center]]s available for victims in countries such as Uganda,<ref name="10a" /> Bangladesh,<ref name="7a">{{cite journal|last=Faga|first=A.|author2=D. Scevolab|author3=M.G. Mezzettic|author4=S. Scevolaa|title=Sulphuric acid burned women in Bangladesh: A social and medical problem|journal=Burns|volume=26|issue=8|pages=701–709|doi=10.1016/S0305-4179(00)00049-8|date=20 January 2000|pmid=11024602}}</ref> and Cambodia.<ref name="11a" /> For example, Uganda has one specialized [[burn center]] in the entire nation, which opened in 2003;<ref name="10a" /> likewise, Cambodia has only one burn facility for victims,<ref name="11a" /> and scholars estimate that only 30% of the Bangladeshi community has access to [[health care]].<ref name="7a" />

In addition to inadequate medical capabilities, many acid assault victims fail to report to the [[police]] due to a lack of trust in the force, a sense of hopelessness due to the attackers' [[impunity]], and a fear of male brutality in dealing with their cases.<ref name=2a /> Most of the female victims suffer more because of police apathy in dealing with cases of harassment as safety issues as victims refused to register a police case despite being attacked thrice before meriting police aid after an acid attack.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2854918.ece A case of police apathy?], ''The Hindu'', February 3, 2012</ref>

These problems are exacerbated by a lack of knowledge of how to treat burns: many victims applied oil to the acid, rather than rinsing thoroughly and completely with water for 30 minutes or longer to [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralize]] the acid. Such [[home remedy|home remedies]] only serve to increase the severity of damage, as they do not counteract the acidity.<ref name="159a"/>

==Prevention==
Research has prompted many solutions to the increasing incidence of acid attacks in the world. Many countries look to Bangladesh, whose rates of attack have been decreasing, as a model, following their lead in many legislative reforms.<ref name=12a2 /> However, several reports highlighted the need for an increased, legal role of NGOs to offer rehabilitation support to acid survivors.<ref name=11a /> Additionally, nearly all research stressed the need for stricter [[regulation]] of acid sales to combat this social issue.<ref name=11a /><ref name=10a /><ref name=12a2 />

===Role of NGOs===
Many [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) have been formed in the areas with the highest occurrence of acid attacks to combat such attacks. Bangladesh has its [[Acid Survivors Foundation]], which offers acid victims [[legal]], [[medical]], [[rehabilitation counseling|counseling]], and monetary assistance in rebuilding their lives.<ref name=12a2 /> Similar institutions exist in Uganda, which has its own Acid Survivors Foundation,<ref name=10a /> and in Cambodia which uses the help of [[Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity]].<ref name=11a /> NGOs provide rehabilitation services for survivors while acting as advocates for [[social reform]], hoping to increase support and awareness for acid assault.

===Regulation of acid sales===
A positive correlation has been observed between acid attacks and ease of acid purchase.<ref name=12a2 /> [[sulfuric acid|Sulfuric]], [[nitric acid|nitric]], and [[hydrochloric acid]] are most commonly used and are all cheap and readily available in many instances. For example, often acid throwers can purchase a liter of concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] at motorbike mechanic shops for about 40 U.S. cents. [[Nitric acid]] costs around $1.50 per liter and is available for purchase at gold or jewelry shops, as polishers generally use it to purify gold and metals. [[Hydrochloric acid]] is also used for polishing jewelry, as well as for making [[soy sauce]], [[cosmetics]], and traditional medicine/[[substituted amphetamine|amphetamine]] drugs.<ref name=13a />

Due to such ease of access, many organizations call for a stricter regulation on the acid economy. Specific actions include required [[license]]s for all acid traders, a ban on concentrated acid in certain areas, and an enhanced system of monitoring for acid sales, such as the need to document all transactions involving acid.<ref name=11a /> However, some scholars have warned that such stringent regulation may result in [[black market]] trading of acid, which law enforcements must keep in mind.<ref name=11a />

==History==
Acid has been used in [[metallurgy]] and for etching since ancient times. The rhetorical and theatrical term "La Vitrioleuse" was coined in France after a "wave of vitriolage" occurred according to the popular press where, in 1879, 16 cases of vitriol attacks were widely reported as [[Crime of passion|crimes of passion]] perpetrated predominantly by women against other women.<ref name=13a/> Much was made of the idea that women, no matter how few, had employed such violent means to an end. On October 17, 1915, acid was fatally thrown on [[Prince Leopold Clement of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], heir to the [[House of Koháry]], by his distraught mistress, [[Camilla Rybicka]], who then [[Murder–suicide|killed herself]]. Sensationalizing such incidents made for lucrative newspaper sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TC19160107.2.10|title=Royal Love Tragedy|work=[[The Colonist]]|publisher=Papers Past, [[National Library of New Zealand]]|date=1916-01-07}}</ref> Similarly, multiple acid attacks were reported in the UK in the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century. Again, these were seen as a crime carried out by women, although in practice perpetrators were as likely to be male as female.<ref>https://legalhistorymiscellany.com/2017/09/13/acid-attacks-in-nineteenth-century-britain/</ref>

The use of acid as a weapon began to rise in many [[developing country|developing nations]], specifically those in [[South Asia]].<ref name=7a /> The first recorded acid attacks in South Asia occurred in Bangladesh in 1967,<ref name=12a2/> India in 1982, and Cambodia in 1993.<ref name=13a/> Since then, research has witnessed an increase in the quantity and severity of acid attacks in the region. However, this can be traced to significant underreporting in the 1980s and 1990s, along with a general lack of research on this phenomenon during that period.<ref name=2a>{{cite web|title=Baseline Report: Violence Against Women in Bangladesh |url=http://www.iwraw-ap.org/aboutus/pdf/FPvaw.pdf |publisher=International Women's Rights Action Watch Asia Pacific |access-date=6 March 2013 |author=Naripokkho |author2=Bangladesh Mahila Parishad |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922173913/http://www.iwraw-ap.org/aboutus/pdf/FPvaw.pdf |archive-date=22 September 2013 }}</ref>

Research shows acid attacks increasing in many [[developing country|developing nations]], with the exception of Bangladesh which has observed a decrease in incidence in the past few years.<ref name=12a2 />

==Legislation==
Many countries have begun pushing for [[legislation]] addressing acid attacks, and a few have recently employed new [[law]]s against this crime.<ref name=12a2 /> Under the [[Qisas]] law of Pakistan, the perpetrator may suffer the same fate as the victim, and may be punished by having drops of acid placed in their eyes.<ref name="quisas">{{cite web|url=http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1908/context/archive|title=Pakistan's Acid-Attack Victims Press for Justice|access-date=2008-05-30|publisher=Women's eNews|date=July 13, 2004|author=Juliette Terzieff|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612174357/http://www.womensenews.org/article.cfm/dyn/aid/1908/context/archive|archive-date=2008-06-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> This law is not binding and is rarely enforced according to a report in ''The New York Times''.<ref name="video.nytimes.com"/> In Pakistan, the Lower House of [[parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] unanimously passed the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill on May 10, 2011. As punishment, according to the bill individuals held responsible for acid attacks face harsh fines and [[life in prison]]. However, the country with the most specific, effective legislation against acid attacks is Bangladesh, and such legal action has resulted in a steady 20–30% decrease in acid violence for the past few years.<ref name=12a2 /> In 2013, India introduced an amendment to the [[Indian Penal Code]] through the [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013]], making acid attacks a specific offence with a punishment of imprisonment not less than 10 years and which can extend to life imprisonment and with fine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 |url=http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf |publisher=Government of India |access-date=11 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417194151/http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf |archive-date=17 April 2013 }}</ref>

===India===
India's top court ruled that authorities must regulate the sale of acid. The Supreme Court's ruling on July 16, 2013, came after an incident in which four sisters suffered severe burns after being attacked with acid by two men on a motorbike. Acid which is designed to clean rusted tools is often used in the attacks can be bought across the counter. But the judges said the buyer of such acids should in future have to provide a photo identity card to any retailer when they make a purchase.

In 2002, Bangladesh introduced the [[death penalty]] for acid attacks and laws strictly controlling the sale, use, storage, and [[international trade]] of acids. The acids are used in traditional trades carving marble nameplates, [[conch]] bangles, goldsmiths, tanneries, and other industries, which have largely failed to comply with the legislation. Salma Ali of the [[Bangladesh National Women Lawyers' Association]] derided these laws as ineffective.<ref name="Bangladesh laws">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/south_asia/5133410.stm|title=Bangladesh's acid attack problem|access-date=2008-06-14|work=BBC News|date=28 July 2006|author=Roland Buerk}}</ref> The names of these laws are the Acid Crime Control Act (ACCA) and the Acid Control Act (ACA), respectively.<ref name=12a2 />

The ACCA directly impacts the [[criminal law|criminal]] aspect of acid attacks, and allows for the death penalty or a level of punishment corresponding to the area of the body affected. If the attack results in a [[Deafness|loss of hearing]] or [[Loss of sight|sight]] or damages the victim's [[face]], [[breast]]s, or [[sex organ]]s then the perpetrator faces either the death penalty or [[life imprisonment|life sentencing]]. If any other part of the body is maimed, then the criminal faces 7–14 years of [[imprisonment]] in addition to a fine of US$700. Additionally, throwing or attempting to throw acid without causing any physical or mental harm is punishable by this law and could result in a prison term of 3–7 years along with a US$700 fine. Furthermore, [[conspiracy (crime)|conspirators]] that aid in such attacks assume the same [[legal liability|liability]] as those actually committing the crime.<ref name=12a2 />

The ACA regulates the sale, usage, and storing of acid in Bangladesh through the creation of the National Acid Control Council (NACC). The law requires that the NACC implement policies regarding the trade, misuse, and disposal of acid, while also undertaking initiatives that raise awareness about the dangers of acid and improve victim treatment and rehabilitation. The ACA calls for district-level committees responsible for enacting local measures that enforce and further regulate acid use in towns and cities.<ref name=12a2 />

===Pakistan===
Under the [[Qisas]] (eye-for-an-eye) law of Pakistan, the perpetrator could suffer the same fate as the victim, if the victim or the victim's guardian chooses. The perpetrator may be punished by having drops of acid placed in their eyes.<ref name="womensenews.org"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/legislation/1860/actXLVof1860.html|title=Pakistan Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860)|website=www.pakistani.org|access-date=2018-12-03}}</ref>

Section 336B of Pakistan Penal Code states: "Whoever causes hurt by corrosive substance shall be punished with imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description which shall not be less than fourteen years and a minimum fine of one million rupees."<ref name=":0" /> Additionally, section 299 defines ''Qisas'' and states: "''Qisas'' means punishment by causing similar hurt at the same part of the body of the convict as he has caused to the victim or by causing his death if he has committed qatl-iamd (intentional manslaughter) in exercise of the right of the victim or a [[Wali]] (the guardian of the victim)."<ref name=":0" />

===United Kingdom===
After a spate of attacks in London in 2017, the [[Home Office]] said it would consider changes in laws and measures regarding sales of acid, as well as changes in prosecution and sentencing guidelines. As of 2017, it is unlawful to carry acid with the intent to cause harm. Attacks are prosecuted as acts of [[actual bodily harm]] and [[grievous bodily harm]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40621303|work=BBC News|title=Acid attack punishments assessed in government review|date=16 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/acid-attacks-uk-london-sale-law-change-theresa-may-latest-news-abh-gbh-a7840776.html|title=Theresa May hints at changing law after 'horrific' acid attacks in London|date=14 July 2017|website=Independent.co.uk|access-date=15 July 2017}}</ref> Three quarters of police investigations do not end in prosecution, either because the attacker could not be found, or because the victim is unwilling to press charges.<ref name=telegraph_policestats /> According to ASTI, of the 2,078 acid attack crimes recorded for the years 2011–2016 in UK, only 414 of those crimes resulted in charges being brought. Most acid attack crimes happened in London, where over 1,200 cases were recorded over the past five years. From 2011 to 2016 there were 1,464 crimes involving acid or corrosive substance. Northumbria recorded the second highest with 109 recorded attacks, Cambridgeshire had 69 attacks, Hertfordshire 67, Greater Manchester 57 and Humberside 52.

The [[Offensive Weapons Act 2019]] made provisions for crimes related to acid attacks, including bringing in greater regulation of the sale of corrosive products and making it an offence to carry a corrosive substance in a public place without good reason.
