The term '''collapsology''' is a neologism used to designate the ''transdisciplinary study of the risks of collapse of our industrial civilization''. Although the concept of societal or [[civilizational collapse]] had already existed for many years, collapsology focuses its attention on the contemporary, [[Industrial sector|industrial]] and [[globalization|globalized]] society.

The word 'collapsology' has been coined and brought to the attention of the general public by Pablo Servigne and Raphaël Stevens in their essay: ''Comment tout peut s’effondrer. Petit manuel de collapsologie à l’usage des générations présentes''<ref name="Servigne2015">{{Cite book|title= Comment tout peut s'effondrer : petit manuel de collapsologie à l'usage des générations présentes|last= Servigne |first= Pablo|last2= Stevens| first2= Raphaël|date= 2015|publisher =Ed. du Seuil|isbn= 9782021223316 |page= 253|language= fr|oclc= 908244398}}</ref> (How everything can collapse: A manual for our times<ref name= "Collapse2020">{{Cite book|last=Servigne |first=Pablo|last2=Stevens |first2= Raphaël|title=How Everything Can Collapse|publisher= Polity|year= 2020|isbn=9781509541393 |location= Cambridge }}</ref>), published in 2015 in France.<ref name="NYR">{{cite magazine|last=Stetler |first=Harrison |date=2020-01-21 |title = ‘Collapsologie’: Constructing an Idea of How Things Fall Apart |url =https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/01/21/collapsologie-constructing-an-idea-of-how-things-fall-apart/|magazine=[[The New York Review of Books]]|location=New York City|publisher=Rea S. Hederman|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Since then, the term has gradually spread in the Anglo-Saxon community, although it is still seldom used by the English-speaking specialists of the field.

Collapsology is part of the idea that mankind impacts its environment sustainably and negatively, and propagates the concept of ecological urgency, linked in particular to [[global warming]] and the [[biodiversity loss]]. Collapsologists believe, however, that the collapse of industrial civilization could be the result of a combination of different crises: environmental, but also energy, economic, geopolitical, democratic, and other crises.<ref name="Futura">{{Cite web|url=https://www.futura-sciences.com/planete/definitions/climatologie-collapsologie-18034/|title=Collapsologie|website=Futura|language=fr|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>

Collapsology is a transdisciplinary exercise involving [[ecology]], [[economics]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[biophysics]], [[biogeography]], [[agriculture]], [[demography]], [[politics]], [[geopolitics]], [[bioarchaeology]], [[history]], [[futurology]], [[health]], [[law]] and [[art]].<ref name="Collapse2020" />

==Etymology==
The word "collapsology" is a neologism invented "with a certain self-mockery" by Pablo Servigne, an agricultural engineer, and Raphaël Stevens, an expert in the resilience of socio-ecological systems. It appears in their book published in 2015.<ref>{{cite news | language = fr | last = Faure | first = Sonya | title = Collapsologie [nom]: du latin, ''collapsus'', " tombé d’un seul bloc "| newspaper = [[Libération]]|date = 11 June 2015|url = http://www.liberation.fr/debats/2015/06/11/collapsologie-nom-du-latin-collapsus-tombe-d-un-seul-bloc_1327524 |access-date = 9 June 2020}}</ref>

It is a [[portmanteau]] derived from the [[Latin]] collapsus, "to fall, to collapse" and from the suffix "-logy", [[logos]], put for "study " , which is intended to name an approach of scientific nature.<ref>{{cite news | language = fr | last1 = Garric | first = Audrey |last2 = Bouanchaud |first2 =Cécile | title = Le succès inattendu des théories de l’effondrement| newspaper =[[Le Monde]]|date = 5 February 2019|url = https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2019/02/05/le-succes-inattendu-des-theories-de-l-effondrement_5419370_3244.html|access-date = 9 June 2020}}</ref>

Since 2015 and the publication of ''How everything can collapse'' in French, several words have been proposed to describe the various approaches dealing with the issue of collapse: [[collapso-sophy]] to designate the [[Philosophy of life|philosophical]] approach, [[collapso-praxis]] to designate the [[ideology]] inspired by this study, and [[collapsonauts]] to designate people living with this idea in mind.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Servigne, Pablo|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1152054578|title=Another end of the world is possible : living the collapse (and not merely surviving it)|others=Stevens, Raphaël, Chapelle, Gauthier, Samuel, Geoffrey.|isbn=978-1-5095-4465-3|location=Medford|oclc=1152054578}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Citton, Yves|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1150810193|title=Générations collapsonautes : naviguer par temps d'effondrements|others=Rasmi, Jacopo.|isbn=978-2-02-144740-8|location=Paris|oclc=1150810193}}</ref>

==Mythological and religious foundations==
{{details|eschatology|end time|global catastrophic risk|flood myth|apocalyptic literature}}
Unlike traditional eschatological thinking, collapsology is based on data and concepts from contemporary scientific work, primarily human understanding of [[climate change]] as caused by human economic and geopolitical systems. It is not in line with the idea of a cosmic, apocalyptic "end of the world", but makes the hypothesis of the end of the human ''current'' world, the "thermo-industrial civilization".

==Scientific basis==
As early as 1972, [[The Limits to Growth]],<ref name="Meadows-1972">{{cite book|last1=Meadows|first1=Donella H|last2=Meadows|first2=Dennis L|last3=Randers|first3=Jørgen|last4=Behrens III|first4=William W|title=The Limits to Growth; A Report for the Club of Rome's Project on the Predicament of Mankind|date=1972|ref=Potomac Associates|publisher=Universe Books|location=New York|isbn=0876631650|url=https://issuu.com/dartmouth_college_library/docs/the_limits_to_growth?e=1347206/1573259|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> a report produced by MIT researchers, warned of the risks of exponential demographic and economic growth on a planet with limited resources.

As a [[Systems analysis|systemic approach]], collapsology is based on prospective studies such as The Limits of Growth, but also on the state of global and regional trends in the environmental, social and economic fields (such as the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], [[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services|IPBES]] or Global Environment Outlook (GE) reports periodically published by the Early Warning and Assessment Division of the [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]], etc.) and numerous scientific works<ref name="Servigne2015" /> as well as various studies, such as "A safe operating space for humanity";<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Johan|last1=Rockström|first2=Will|last2=Steffen|first3=Kevin|last3=Noone|first4=Åsa|last4=Persson|title=A safe operating space for humanity|journal=Nature|volume=461|number=7263|date=2009-09-23|doi=10.1038/461472a|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/461472a|access-date=2020-04-07|pages=472–475}}</ref> "Approaching a state shift in Earth's biosphere",<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barnosky|first1=Anthony D.|last2=Hadly|first2=Elizabeth A.|last3=Bascompte|first3=Jordi|last4=Berlow|first4=Eric L.|title=Approaching a state shift in Earth’s biosphere|journal=Nature|volume=486|issue=7401|date=2012-06-06|issn=1476-4687|doi=10.1038/nature11018|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature11018|access-date=2020-04-07|pages=52–58|hdl=10261/55208|hdl-access=free}}</ref> published in Nature in 2009 and 2012, "The trajectory of the Anthropocene: The Great Acceleration",<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Steffen |first1=Will |last2=Broadgate |first2=Wendy |last3=Deutsch |first3=Lisa |last4=Gaffney |first4=Owen |last5=Ludwig |first5=Cornelia |title=The trajectory of the Anthropocene : The Great Acceleration |journal=The Anthropocene Review |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=2015-01-16|doi=10.1177/2053019614564785|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2053019614564785|access-date=2020-04-07|pages=81–98|hdl=1885/66463 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> published in 2015 in The Anthropocene Review, and "Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene",<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Steffen |first1=Will |last2=Rockström |first2=Johan |last3=Richardson |first3=Katherine |last4=Lenton |first4=Timothy M. |title=Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=115 |issue=33 |date=2018-08-14 |issn=0027-8424|doi=10.1073/pnas.1810141115 |url=http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1810141115 |access-date=2020-04-07 |pages=8252–8259 |doi-access=free }}</ref> published in 2018 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.

== History ==
=== Precursors (278 B.C.-2005) ===
Even if this neologism only appeared in 2015 and concerns the study of the collapse of industrial civilization, the study of the [[societal collapse|collapse of societies]] is older and is probably a concern of every [[civilization]]. Among the works on this theme (in a broad sense) one can mention  {{Citation needed|reason=Not actual reference to cited texts or citations|date=June 2020}} those of [[Berossus]] (278 B.C.), [[Pliny the Younger]] (79 AD), [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1375), [[Montesquieu]] (1734), [[Thomas Malthus|Thomas Robert Malthus]] (1766 - 1834), [[Edward Gibbon]] (1776), [[Georges Cuvier]], (1821), [[Élisée Reclus]] (1905), [[Oswald Spengler]] (1918), [[Arnold Toynbee]] (1939), [[Günther Anders]] (1956), [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] (1956), [[Leopold Kohr]] (1957), [[Rachel Carson]] (1962), [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich (1969)]], [[Donella Meadows]], [[Dennis Meadows]] & [[Jørgen Randers]] (1972), [[René Dumont]] (1973), [[Hans Jonas]] (1979), [[Joseph Tainter]] (1988), [[Al Gore]] (1992), [[Hubert Reeves]] (2003), [[Richard Posner]] (2004), [[Jared Diamond]] (2005).

==== Arnold J. Toynbee (1889-1975) ====
In his monumental (initially published in twelve volumes) and highly controversial work of contemporary historiography entitled "[[A Study of History]]" (1972), [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee|Arnold J. Toynbee]] (1889-1975) deals with the genesis of civilizations (chap. 2), their growth (chap. 3), their decline (chap. 4), and their disintegration (chap. 5). According to him, the mortality of civilizations is trivial evidence for the historian, as is the fact that they follow one another over a long period of time.

==== Joseph Tainter (born 1949) ====
In his book [[The Collapse of Complex Societies]], the anthropologist and historian [[Joseph Tainter]] (1949-) studies the collapse of various civilizations, including that of the Roman Empire, in terms of [[network theory]], [[energy economics]] and [[Complex system|complexity theory]]. For Tainter, an increasingly complex society eventually collapses because of the ever-increasing difficulty in solving its problems.

==== Jared Diamond (born 1937) ====
The American [[geographer]], [[synthetic theory of evolution|evolutionary]] [[biologist]] and [[physiologist]] [[Jared Diamond]] (1937- )  already evoked the theme of civilizational collapse in his book called ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', published in 2005. By relying on historical cases, notably the [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]] civilization, the [[Vikings]] and the [[Maya civilization]], Diamond argues that humanity collectively faces, on a much larger scale, many of the same issues as these civilizations did, with possibly catastrophic near-future consequences to many of the world's populations. This book has had a resonance beyond the United States, despite some criticism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diamond|first1=Jarde|date=2005|title=Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed|isbn=978-0-241-95868-1|url=http://cpor.org/ce/Diamond%282005%29Collapse-HowSocietiesChooseFailureSuccess.pdf|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>

=== Modern collapsologists ===
Since the invention of the term collapsology, many French personalities gravitate in or around the collapsologists' sphere. Not all have the same vision of civilizational collapse, some even reject the term "collapsologist", but all agree that contemporary industrial civilization, and the biosphere as a whole, are on the verge of a global crisis of unprecedented proportions. According to them, the process is already under way, and it is now only possible to try to reduce its devastating effects in the near future. The leaders of the movement are [[Yves Cochet]] and [[:fr:Agnès Sinaï|Agnès Sinaï]] of the [[:fr:Institut Momentum|Momentum Institute]] (a [[think tank]] exploring the causes of environmental and societal risks of collapse of the thermo-industrial civilization and possible actions to adapt to it), and Pablo Servigne and Raphaël Stevens who wrote the essay ''How everything can collapse: A manual for our times''<ref name = "Collapse2020" />). Arnaud Dorthe is leading the development a new simulator that is a continuation of the MIT World Dynamics simulators, entitled '''Apocalypse Dynamics'''™.

Beyond the French collapsologists mentioned above, one can mention: [[Aurélien Barrau]] (astrophysicist), Philippe Bihouix (engineer, low-tech developer), [[Dominique Bourg]] (philosopher), Valérie Cabanes (lawyer, seeking recognition of the crime of [[ecocide]] by the international criminal court), [[Jean-Marc Jancovici]] (energy-climate specialist), [[Paul Jorion]] (anthropologist, sociologist)...

In 2020 the French humanities and social science website Cairn.info published a dossier on collapsology titled ''The Age of Catastrophe'', with contributions from historian [[François Hartog]], economist Emmanuel Hache, philosopher Pierre Charbonnier, art historian Romain Noël, geoscientist Gabriele Salerno, and American philosopher [[Eugene Thacker]].<ref>[https://www.cairn-int.info/dossiers-2020-9-page-1.htm The Age of Catastrophe], Cairn.info (International Edition), Vol. 4, Issue 9, October 2020.</ref>

Even if the term remains rather unknown in the Anglo-Saxon world, many publications deal with the same topic (for example the recent David Wallace-Wells' bestseller ''[[The Uninhabitable Earth]]'', probably a mass-market collapsology work without using the term<ref name="NYR" />). It is now gradually spreading on general<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/bg27r3/french_collapsology_if_you_didnt_know_this_in/|title=French collapsology – "If you didn’t know this, in recent years France has seen a big societal movement around the idea that we are approaching a collapse."|date=2019-04-22|website=reddit.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> and scientific<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/Collapsology_Have_you_heard_about |title=Collapsology!
