'''Navigation''' is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another.<ref name="bow799">Bowditch, 2003:799.</ref> The field of navigation includes four general categories: land navigation, marine navigation, aeronautic navigation, and space navigation.<ref name="hofman">{{cite book|last=Rell Pros-Wellenhof|first=Bernhard|title=Navigation: Principles of Positioning and Guidances|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-00828-7|pages=5–6}}</ref>

It is also the term of art used for the specialized knowledge used by navigators to perform navigation tasks. All navigational techniques involve locating the navigator's position compared to known locations or patterns.

Navigation, in a broader sense, can refer to any skill or study that involves the determination of position and direction.<ref name="hofman"/> In this sense, navigation includes orienteering and pedestrian navigation.<ref name="hofman"/>

==History==
{{Details|History of navigation}}
{{see also|History of geodesy}}
In the European medieval period, navigation was considered part of the set of ''[[mechanic arts|seven mechanical arts]]'', none of which were used for long voyages across open ocean. [[Polynesian navigation]] is probably the earliest form of open-ocean navigation, it was based on memory and observation recorded on scientific instruments like the [[Marshall Islands stick chart|Marshall Islands Stick Charts of Ocean Swells]]. Early Pacific Polynesians used the motion of stars, weather, the position of certain wildlife species, or the size of waves to find the path from one island to another.

Maritime navigation using scientific instruments such as the [[mariner's astrolabe]] first occurred in the Mediterranean during the Middle Ages. Although [[astrolabe|land astrolabes]] were invented in the [[Hellenistic period]] and existed in [[classical antiquity]] and the [[Islamic Golden Age]], the oldest record of a sea astrolabe is that of [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorcan]] astronomer [[Ramon Llull]] dating from 1295.<ref name="oxfordShipsAndSea">''The Ty Pros Companion to Ships and the Sea'', Peter Kemp ed., 1976 {{ISBN|0-586-08308-1}}</ref> The perfecting of this navigation instrument is attributed to [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] navigators during early [[Portuguese discoveries]] in the [[Age of Discovery]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Comandante Estácio dos Reis |title=Astrolábios Náuticos |year=2002  |publisher=INAPA |isbn=978-972-797-037-7}}</ref><ref name="ancruzeiros.pt">{{cite web |url=http://www.ancruzeiros.pt/anci-astrolabio.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-04-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122134304/http://www.ancruzeiros.pt/anci-astrolabio.html |archive-date=2012-11-22 }}</ref> The earliest known description of how to make and use a sea astrolabe comes from Spanish cosmographer [[Martín Cortés de Albacar]]'s ''Arte de Navegar'' (''The Art of Navigation'') published in 1551,<ref name="swanick">Swanick, Lois Ann. ''An Analysis Of Navigational Instruments In The Age Of Exploration: 15th Century To Mid-17th century'', MA Thesis, Texas A&M University, December 2005</ref> based on the principle of the [[archipendulum]] used in constructing the [[Egyptian pyramids]].

Open-seas navigation using the astrolabe and the [[compass]] started during the Age of Discovery in the 15th century. The Portuguese began systematically exploring the [[Atlantic]] coast of [[Africa]] from 1418, under the sponsorship of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry]]. In 1488 [[Bartolomeu Dias]] reached the [[Indian Ocean]] by this route. In 1492 the [[Ferdinand and Isabella|Spanish monarchs]] funded [[Christopher Columbus]]'s expedition to sail west to reach the [[Indies]] by crossing the Atlantic, which resulted in the [[Discovery of the Americas]]. In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]] reached [[India]] by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with [[Asia]]. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1512, landing in [[China]] one year later.

The first circumnavigation of the earth was completed in 1522 with the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan-Elcano expedition]], a Spanish voyage of discovery led by Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and completed by Spanish navigator [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] after the former's death in the [[Philippines]] in 1521. The fleet of seven ships sailed from [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] in Southern [[Spain]] in 1519, crossed the Atlantic Ocean and after several stopovers rounded the southern tip of [[South America]]. Some ships were lost, but the remaining fleet continued across the [[Pacific]] making a number of discoveries including [[Guam]] and the Philippines. By then, only two galleons were left from the original seven. The ''Victoria'' led by Elcano sailed across the Indian Ocean and north along the coast of Africa, to finally arrive in Spain in 1522, three years after its departure. The ''Trinidad'' sailed east from the Philippines, trying to find a maritime path back to the [[Americas]], but was unsuccessful. The eastward route across the Pacific, also known as the ''tornaviaje'' (return trip) was only discovered forty years later, when Spanish cosmographer [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] sailed from the Philippines, north to parallel 39°, and hit the eastward [[Kuroshio Current]] which took its galleon across the Pacific. He arrived in [[Acapulco]] on October 8, 1565.

==Etymology==
The term stems from the 1530s, from [[Latin]] ''navigationem'' (nom. ''navigatio''), from ''navigatus'', pp. of ''navigare'' "to sail, sail over, go by sea, steer a ship," from ''navis'' "ship" and the root of ''agere'' "to drive".<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Basic concepts==
{{longlat}}

===Latitude===
{{Further|Latitude}}
Roughly, the latitude of a place on Earth is its angular distance north or south of the [[equator]].<ref name="bow4">Bowditch, 2003:4.</ref> Latitude is usually expressed in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (marked with °) ranging from 0° at the [[Equator]] to 90° at the North and South poles.<ref name="bow4"/>  The latitude of the [[North Pole]] is 90° N, and the latitude of the [[South Pole]] is 90° S.<ref name="bow4" /> Mariners calculated latitude in the Northern Hemisphere by sighting the North Star [[Polaris]] with a [[sextant]] and using sight reduction tables to correct for height of eye and atmospheric refraction. The height of [[Polaris]] in degrees above the horizon is the latitude of the observer, within a degree or so.

===Longitude===
{{Further|Longitude}}
Similar to latitude, the longitude of a place on Earth is the angular distance east or west of the [[prime meridian]] or [[Greenwich meridian]].<ref name="bow4"/>   Longitude is usually expressed in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (marked with °) ranging from [[prime meridian|0°]] at the Greenwich meridian to [[180th meridian|180°]] east and west. [[Sydney]], for example, has a longitude of about [[151st meridian east|151° east]]. [[New York City]] has a longitude of [[74th meridian west|74° west]]. For most of history, mariners struggled to determine longitude. Longitude can be calculated if the precise time of a sighting is known. Lacking that, one can use a [[sextant]]  to take a [[Lunar distance (navigation)|lunar distance]] (also called ''the lunar observation'', or "lunar" for short) that, with a [[nautical almanac]], can be used to calculate the time at zero longitude (see [[Greenwich Mean Time]]).<ref name="Norie 1828 pg 222">

===Loxodrome===
{{Further|Rhumb line}}
In navigation, a rhumb line (or loxodrome) is a line crossing all meridians of longitude at the same angle, i.e. a path derived from a defined initial bearing. That is, upon taking an initial bearing, one proceeds along the same bearing, without changing the direction as measured relative to true or magnetic north.

==Methods of navigation==
Most modern navigation relies primarily on positions determined electronically by receivers collecting information from satellites. Most other modern techniques rely on crossing [[line of position|lines of position]] or LOP.<ref name="mal615">Maloney, 2003:615.</ref>

A line of position can refer to two different things, either a line on a chart or a line between the observer and an object in real life.<ref name="mal614">Maloney, 2003:614</ref>  A bearing is a measure of the direction to an object.<ref name="mal614"/>  If the navigator measures the direction in real life, the angle can then be drawn on a [[nautical chart]] and the navigator will be on that line on the chart.<ref name="mal614"/>

In addition to bearings, navigators also often measure distances to objects.<ref name="mal615"/>  On the chart, a distance produces a circle or arc of position.<ref name="mal615"/>  Circles, arcs, and hyperbolae of positions are often referred to as lines of position.

If the navigator draws two lines of position, and they intersect he must be at that position.<ref name="mal615"/>  A [[fix (position)|fix]] is the intersection of two or more LOPs.<ref name="mal615"/>

If only one line of position is available, this may be evaluated against the [[dead reckoning]] position to establish an estimated position.<ref name="mal618">Maloney, 2003:618.</ref>

Lines (or circles) of position can be derived from a variety of sources:
* celestial observation (a short segment of the [[circle of equal altitude]], but generally represented as a line),
* terrestrial range (natural or man made) when two charted points are observed to be in line with each other,<ref name="mal622">Maloney, 2003:622.</ref>
* compass bearing to a charted object,
* radar range to a charted object,
* on certain coastlines, a depth sounding from [[Fathometer|echo sounder]] or hand [[Sounding line|lead line]].

There are some methods seldom used today such as "dipping a light" to calculate the geographic range from observer to lighthouse.

Methods of navigation have changed through history.<ref name="bow1">Bowditch, 2002:1.</ref>  Each new method has enhanced the mariner's ability to complete his voyage.<ref name="bow1"/> One of the most important judgments the navigator must make is the best method to use.<ref name="bow1"/>  Some types of navigation are depicted in the table.

===Mental navigation checks===
By mental navigation checks, a pilot or a navigator estimates tracks, distances, and altitudes which will then help the pilot avoid gross navigation errors.

===Piloting===
{{Further|Pilotage}}
[[File:Navigatie.jpg|thumb|Manual navigation through Dutch airspace]]
Piloting (also called pilotage) involves navigating an aircraft by visual reference to landmarks,<ref name="14cfr1">Federal Aviation Regulations Part 1 §1.1</ref> or a water vessel in restricted waters and fixing its position as precisely as possible at frequent intervals.<ref name="bow105">Bowditch, 2002:105.</ref> More so than in other phases of navigation, proper preparation and attention to detail are important.<ref name="bow105"/>  Procedures vary from vessel to vessel, and between military, commercial, and private vessels.<ref name="bow105"/>

A military navigation team will nearly always consist of several people.<ref name="bow105"/>   A military navigator might have bearing takers stationed at the gyro repeaters on the bridge wings for taking simultaneous bearings, while the civilian navigator must often take and plot them himself.<ref name="bow105"/>  While the military navigator will have a bearing book and someone to record entries for each fix, the civilian navigator will simply pilot the bearings on the chart as they are taken and not record them at all.<ref name="bow105"/>

If the ship is equipped with an ECDIS, it is reasonable for the navigator to simply monitor the progress of the ship along the chosen track, visually ensuring that the ship is proceeding as desired, checking the compass, sounder and other indicators only occasionally.<ref name="bow105"/>  If a [[harbour pilot|pilot]] is aboard, as is often the case in the most restricted of waters, his judgement can generally be relied upon, further easing the workload.<ref name="bow105"/>  But should the ECDIS fail, the navigator will have to rely on his skill in the manual and time-tested procedures.<ref name="bow105"/>

===Celestial navigation===
{{Main|Celestial navigation}}
[[File:Sun-Moon path.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|A celestial fix will be at the intersection of two or more circles.]]

Celestial navigation systems are based on observation of the positions of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[Planet]]s and [[list of selected stars for navigation|navigational stars]]. Such systems are in use as well for terrestrial navigating as for interstellar navigating. By knowing which point on the rotating earth a celestial object is above and measuring its height above the observer's horizon, the navigator can determine his distance from that subpoint.  A [[nautical almanac]] and a [[marine chronometer]] are used to compute the subpoint on earth a celestial body is over, and a [[sextant]] is used to measure the body's angular height above the horizon.  That height can then be used to compute distance from the subpoint to create a circular line of position.  A navigator shoots a number of stars in succession to give a series of overlapping lines of position.  Where they intersect is the celestial fix.  The moon and sun may also be used.  The sun can also be used by itself to shoot a succession of lines of position (best done around local noon) to determine a position.<ref name="bow269"/>

====Marine chronometer====
{{main|Marine chronometer}}
In order to accurately measure longitude, the precise time of a sextant sighting (down to the second, if possible) must be recorded.  Each second of error is equivalent to 15 seconds of longitude error, which at the equator is a position error of .25 of a nautical mile,  about the accuracy limit of manual celestial navigation.

The spring-driven marine chronometer is a precision timepiece used aboard ship to provide accurate time for celestial observations.<ref name="bow269">Bowditch, 2002:269.</ref>  A chronometer differs from a spring-driven watch principally in that it contains a variable lever device to maintain even pressure on the mainspring, and a special balance designed to compensate for temperature variations.<ref name="bow269"/>

A spring-driven chronometer is set approximately to Greenwich mean time (GMT) and is not reset until the instrument is overhauled and cleaned, usually at three-year intervals.<ref name="bow269"/>  The difference between GMT and chronometer time is carefully determined and applied as a correction to all chronometer readings.<ref name="bow269"/>   Spring-driven chronometers must be wound at about the same time each day.<ref name="bow269"/>

Quartz crystal marine chronometers have replaced spring-driven chronometers aboard many ships because of their greater accuracy.<ref name="bow269"/>  They are maintained on GMT directly from radio time signals.<ref name="bow269"/>  This eliminates chronometer error and watch error corrections.<ref name="bow269"/>  Should the second hand be in error by a readable amount, it can be reset electrically.<ref name="bow269"/>

The basic element for time generation is a quartz crystal oscillator.<ref name="bow269"/>  The quartz crystal is temperature compensated and is hermetically sealed in an evacuated envelope.<ref name="bow269"/>  A calibrated adjustment capability is provided to adjust for the aging of the crystal.<ref name="bow269"/>

The chronometer is designed to operate for a minimum of 1 year on a single set of batteries.<ref name="bow269"/> Observations may be timed and ship's clocks set with a comparing watch, which is set to chronometer time and taken to the bridge wing for recording sight times.<ref name="bow269"/>  In practice, a wrist watch coordinated to the nearest second with the chronometer will be adequate.<ref name="bow269"/>

A stop watch, either spring wound or digital, may also be used for celestial observations.<ref name="bow269"/>  In this case, the watch is started at a known GMT by chronometer, and the elapsed time of each sight added to this to obtain GMT of the sight.<ref name="bow269"/>

All chronometers and watches should be checked regularly with a radio time signal.<ref name="bow269"/>  Times and frequencies of radio time signals are listed in publications such as [[Radio Navigational Aids]].<ref name="bow269"/>

====The marine sextant====
[[File:Marine sextant.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The marine [[sextant]] is used to measure the elevation of celestial bodies above the horizon.]]
{{Details|Sextant}}
The second critical component of celestial navigation is to measure the angle formed at the observer's eye between the celestial body and the sensible horizon.  The sextant, an optical instrument, is used to perform this function.  The sextant consists of two primary assemblies.  The frame is a rigid triangular structure with a pivot at the top and a graduated segment of a circle, referred to as the "arc", at the bottom.  The second component is the index arm, which is attached to the pivot at the top of the frame.  At the bottom is an endless vernier which clamps into teeth on the bottom of the "arc".  The optical system consists of two mirrors and, generally, a low power telescope.  One mirror, referred to as the "index mirror" is fixed to the top of the index arm, over the pivot.  As the index arm is moved, this mirror rotates, and the graduated scale on the arc indicates the measured angle ("altitude").

The second mirror, referred to as the "horizon glass", is fixed to the front of the frame.  One half of the horizon glass is silvered and the other half is clear.  Light from the celestial body strikes the index mirror and is reflected to the silvered portion of the horizon glass, then back to the observer's eye through the telescope.  The observer manipulates the index arm so the reflected image of the body in the horizon glass is just resting on the visual horizon, seen through the clear side of the horizon glass.

Adjustment of the sextant consists of checking and aligning all the optical elements to eliminate "index correction".  Index correction should be checked, using the horizon or more preferably a star, each time the sextant is used.  The practice of taking celestial observations from the deck of a rolling ship, often through cloud cover and with a hazy horizon, is by far the most challenging part of celestial navigation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Inertial navigation===
{{Further|Inertial navigation system}}

[[Inertial navigation system]] (INS) is a [[dead reckoning]] type of navigation system that computes its position based on motion sensors. Before actually navigating, the initial latitude and longitude and the INS's physical orientation relative to the earth (e.g., north and level) are established. After alignment, an INS receives impulses from motion detectors that measure (a) the acceleration along three axes (accelerometers), and (b) rate of rotation about three orthogonal axes (gyroscopes). These enable an INS to continually and accurately calculate its current latitude and longitude (and often velocity). 

Advantages over other navigation systems are that, once aligned, an INS does not require outside information. An INS is not affected by adverse weather conditions and it cannot be detected or jammed. Its disadvantage is that since the current position is calculated solely from previous positions and motion sensors, its errors are cumulative, increasing at a rate roughly proportional to the time since the initial position was input.  Inertial navigation systems must therefore be frequently corrected with a location 'fix' from some other type of navigation system.  

The first inertial system is considered to be the V-2 guidance system deployed by the Germans in 1942. However, inertial sensors are traced to the early 19th century.<ref name="Tazartes">"An historical perspective on inertial navigation systems", Daniel Tazartes, ''2014 International Symposium on Inertial Sensors and Systems (ISISS)'',  Laguna Beach, CA, USA</ref>  The advantages INSs led their use in aircraft, missiles, surface ships and submarines. For example, the U.S. Navy developed the Ships Inertial Navigation System (SINS) during the [[Polaris missile]] program to ensure a reliable and accurate navigation system to initial its missile guidance systems. Inertial navigation systems were in wide use until [[satellite navigation]] systems (GPS) became available. INSs are still in common use on submarines (since GPS reception or other fix sources are not possible while submerged) and long-range missiles.

====Radio navigation====
{{main|Radio navigation|Radio direction finder}}
A radio direction finder or RDF is a device for finding the direction to a [[radio]] source. Due to radio's ability to travel very long distances "over the horizon", it makes a particularly good navigation system for ships and aircraft that might be flying at a distance from land.

RDFs works by rotating a directional [[Antenna (electronics)|antenna]] and listening for the direction in which the signal from a known station comes through most strongly. This sort of system was widely used in the 1930s and 1940s. RDF antennas are easy to spot on [[Germany|German]] [[World War II]] aircraft, as loops under the rear section of the fuselage, whereas most [[United States|US]] aircraft enclosed the antenna in a small teardrop-shaped fairing.

In navigational applications, RDF signals are provided in the form of ''radio beacons'', the radio version of a [[lighthouse]]. The signal is typically a simple [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] broadcast of a [[morse code]] series of letters, which the RDF can tune in to see if the beacon is "on the air". Most modern detectors can also tune in any commercial radio stations, which is particularly useful due to their high power and location near major cities.

[[Decca Navigator System|Decca]], [[OMEGA Navigation System|OMEGA]], and [[LORAN-C]] are three similar hyperbolic navigation systems.  Decca was a [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] [[low frequency]] [[radio navigation]] system (also known as [[multilateration]]) that was first deployed during [[World War II]] when the Allied forces needed a system which could be used to achieve accurate landings. As was the case with [[Loran C]], its primary use was for ship navigation in coastal waters. Fishing vessels were major post-war users, but it was also used on aircraft, including a very early (1949) application of moving-map displays. The system was deployed in the North Sea and was used by helicopters operating to [[oil platform]]s.

The OMEGA Navigation System was the first truly global [[radio navigation]] system for aircraft, operated by the [[United States]] in cooperation with six partner nations.  OMEGA was developed by the United States Navy for military aviation users. It was approved for development in 1968 and promised a true worldwide oceanic coverage capability with only eight transmitters and the ability to achieve a four-mile (6&nbsp;km) accuracy when fixing a position. Initially, the system was to be used for navigating nuclear bombers across the North Pole to Russia. Later, it was found useful for submarines.[http://www.jproc.ca/hyperbolic/omega.html]   Due to the success of the [[Global Positioning System]] the use of Omega declined during the 1990s, to a point where the cost of operating Omega could no longer be justified.  Omega was terminated on September 30, 1997 and all stations ceased operation.

LORAN is a terrestrial [[radio-navigation|navigation]] system using [[low frequency]] radio transmitters that use the time interval between radio signals received from three or more stations to determine the position of a ship or aircraft.  The current version of LORAN in common use is LORAN-C, which operates in the [[low frequency]] portion of the EM spectrum from 90 to 110 [[Hertz|kHz]].  Many nations are users of the system, including the [[United States]], [[Japan]], and several European countries. Russia uses a nearly exact system in the same frequency range, called [[CHAYKA]]. LORAN use is in steep decline, with [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] being the primary replacement.  However, there are attempts to enhance and re-popularize LORAN.  LORAN signals are less susceptible to interference and can penetrate better into foliage and buildings than GPS signals.

====Radar navigation====

When a vessel is within radar range of land or special radar aids to navigation, the navigator can take distances and angular bearings to charted objects and use these to establish arcs of position and lines of position on a chart.<ref name="chap744">Maloney, 2003:744.</ref>  A fix consisting of only radar information is called a radar fix.<ref name="bow816">Bowditch, 2002:816.</ref>

Types of radar fixes include "range and bearing to a single object,"<ref name="nima163">National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 2001:163.</ref>  "two or more bearings,"<ref name="nima163"/> "tangent bearings,"<ref name="nima163"/> and "two or more ranges."<ref name="nima163"/>

Parallel indexing is a technique defined by William Burger in the 1957 book ''The Radar Observer's Handbook''.<ref name="nima169">National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 2001:169.</ref>  This technique involves creating a line on the screen that is parallel to the ship's course, but offset to the left or right by some distance.<ref name="nima169"/>  This parallel line allows the navigator to maintain a given distance away from hazards.<ref name="nima169"/>

Some techniques have been developed for special situations.  One, known as the "contour method," involves marking a transparent plastic template on the radar screen and moving it to the chart to fix a position.<ref name="nima164">National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 2001:164.</ref>

Another special technique, known as the Franklin Continuous Radar Plot Technique, involves drawing the path a radar object should follow on the radar display if the ship stays on its planned course.<ref name="nima182">National Imagery and Mapping Agency, 2001:182.</ref>  During the transit, the navigator can check that the ship is on track by checking that the pip lies on the drawn line.<ref name="nima182"/>

====Satellite navigation====
{{Further|Satellite navigation}}
Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS is the term for satellite navigation systems that provide positioning with global coverage. A GNSS allow small [[electronics|electronic]] receivers to determine their location ([[longitude]], [[latitude]], and [[altitude]]) to within a few metres using [[time signal]]s transmitted along a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] by [[radio]] from [[satellite]]s.  Receivers on the ground with a fixed position can also be used to calculate the precise time as a reference for scientific experiments.

As of October 2011, only the [[United States]] NAVSTAR [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and the [[Russia]]n [[GLONASS]] are fully globally operational GNSSs. The [[European Union]]'s [[Galileo positioning system]] is a next generation GNSS in the final deployment phase, and became operational in 2016. [[China]] has indicated it may expand its regional [[Beidou navigation system]] into a global system.

More than two dozen GPS satellites are in [[medium Earth orbit]], transmitting signals allowing GPS receivers to determine the receiver's [[geographic location|location]], speed and direction.

Since the first experimental satellite was launched in 1978, GPS has become an indispensable aid to navigation around the world, and an important tool for [[cartography|map-making]] and [[surveying|land surveying]]. GPS also provides a precise [[time transfer|time reference]] used in many applications including scientific study of [[earthquake]]s, and [[synchronization]] of telecommunications networks.

Developed by the [[United States Department of Defense]], GPS is officially named NAVSTAR GPS (NAVigation Satellite Timing And Ranging Global Positioning System). The [[satellite constellation]] is managed by the [[United States Air Force]] [[50th Space Wing]]. The cost of maintaining the system is approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]750 million per year,<ref name="GPS overview from JPO">[http://gps.losangeles.af.mil/jpo/gpsoverview.htm GPS Overview from the NAVSTAR Joint Program Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928042828/http://gps.losangeles.af.mil/jpo/gpsoverview.htm |date=2006-09-28 }}. Accessed December 15, 2006.</ref> including the replacement of aging satellites, and research and development. Despite this fact, GPS is free for civilian use as a [[Public good (economics)|public good]].

Modern [[smartphones]] act as personal [[GPS]] navigators for civilians who own them. Overuse of these devices, whether in the vehicle or on foot, can lead to a relative inability to learn about navigated environments, resulting in sub-optimal navigation abilities when and if these devices become unavailable <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gardony|first=Aaron L|date=April 2013|title=How Navigational Aids Impair Spatial Memory: Evidence for Divided Attention|journal=Spatial Cognition & Computation|volume=13|issue=4|pages=319–350|doi=10.1080/13875868.2013.792821|s2cid=7905481}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gardony|first=Aaron L.|date=June 2015|title=Navigational Aids and Spatial Memory Impairment: The Role of Divided Attention|journal=Spatial Cognition & Computation|volume=15|issue=4|pages=246–284|doi=10.1080/13875868.2015.1059432|s2cid=42070277}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Spatial Information Theory|last=Winter|first=Stephen|publisher=Springer Berlin|year=2007|isbn=978-3-540-74788-8|location=Heidelberg, Germany|pages=238–254}}</ref>. Typically a [[compass]] is also provided to determine direction when not moving.

==Navigation processes==

===Ships and similar vessels===
====One day's work in navigation====
The day's work in navigation is a minimal set of tasks consistent with prudent navigation.  The definition will vary on military and civilian vessels, and from ship to ship, but the traditional method takes a form resembling:<ref name="mmoh6-18">Turpin and McEwen, 1980:6–18.</ref>
# Maintain a continuous dead reckoning plot.
# Take two or more star observations at morning twilight for a celestial fix (prudent to observe 6 stars).
# Morning sun observation.  Can be taken on or near [[prime vertical]] for longitude, or at any time for a line of position.
# Determine compass error by azimuth observation of the sun.
# Computation of the interval to noon, watch time of local apparent noon, and constants for meridian or ex-meridian sights.
# Noontime meridian or ex-meridian observation of the sun for noon latitude line.  Running fix or cross with Venus line for noon fix.
# Noontime determination the day's run and day's set and drift.
# At least one afternoon sun line, in case the stars are not visible at twilight.
# Determine compass error by azimuth observation of the sun.
# Take two or more star observations at evening twilight for a celestial fix (prudent to observe 6 stars).

Navigation on ships is usually always conducted on the [[Bridge_(nautical)#Navigation_station|bridge]]. It may also take place in adjacent space, where chart tables and publications are available.

====Passage planning====
{{Main|Passage planning}}
[[File:Exval.jpeg|thumb|right|Poor passage planning and deviation from the plan can lead to groundings, ship damage and cargo loss.]]Passage planning or voyage planning is a procedure to develop a complete description of vessel's voyage from start to finish.  The plan includes leaving the dock and harbor area, the en route portion of a voyage, approaching the destination, and [[Mooring (watercraft)|mooring]]. According to international law, a vessel's [[captain (nautical)|captain]] is legally responsible for passage planning,<ref name="reg34">{{cite web
 | title =  Regulation 34 – Safe Navigation

 | work = IMO RESOLUTION A.893(21) adopted on 25 November 1999
 | access-date=March 26, 2007}}</ref> however on larger vessels, the task will be delegated to the ship's [[navigator]].<ref name="annex24">{{cite web
 | title =  ANNEX 24 – MCA Guidance Notes for Voyage Planning
 | url = https://mcanet.mcga.gov.uk/public/c4/solas/solas_v/Annexes/Annex24.htm

 | access-date=March 26, 2007}}</ref>

Studies show that [[human error]] is a factor in 80 percent of navigational accidents and that in many cases the human making the error had access to information that could have prevented the accident.<ref name="annex24"/>  The practice of voyage planning has evolved from penciling lines on [[nautical chart]]s to a process of [[risk management]].<ref name="annex24"/>

Passage planning consists of four stages: appraisal, planning, execution, and monitoring,<ref name="annex24"/> which are specified in ''[[International Maritime Organization]] Resolution A.893(21), Guidelines For Voyage Planning,''<ref name="annex25">{{cite web
 | title =  ANNEX 25 – MCA Guidance Notes for Voyage Planning
 | url = https://mcanet.mcga.gov.uk/public/c4/solas/solas_v/Annexes/Annex25.htm
 | work = IMO RESOLUTION A.893(21) adopted on 25 November 1999
 | access-date=January 28, 2011}}</ref>  and these guidelines are reflected in the local laws of IMO signatory countries (for example, Title 33 of the U.S. [[Code of Federal Regulations]]), and a number of professional books or publications. There are some fifty elements of a comprehensive passage plan depending on the size and type of vessel.

The appraisal stage deals with the collection of information relevant to the proposed voyage as well as ascertaining risks and assessing the key features of the voyage.  This will involve considering the type of navigation required e.g. [[Ice navigation]], the region the ship will be passing through and the [[hydrography|hydrographic]] information on the route. In the next stage, the written plan is created.  The third stage is the execution of the finalised voyage plan, taking into account any special circumstances which may arise such as changes in the weather, which may require the plan to be reviewed or altered.  The final stage of passage planning consists of monitoring the vessel's progress in relation to the plan and responding to deviations and unforeseen circumstances.

====Integrated bridge systems====
[[File:Integriertes Brückensystem.jpg|thumb|Integrated Bridge System, integrated on an Offshore Service Ship]]
Electronic integrated bridge concepts are driving future navigation system planning.<ref name="bow1"/> Integrated systems take inputs from various ship sensors, electronically display positioning information, and provide control signals required to maintain a vessel on a preset course.<ref name="bow1"/> The navigator becomes a system manager, choosing system presets, interpreting system output, and monitoring vessel response.<ref name="bow1"/>

===Land navigation===
{{main|Land navigation}}
Navigation for cars and other land-based travel typically uses [[map]]s, [[landmark]]s, and in recent times [[Navigation system|computer navigation]] ("[[satnav]]", short for satellite navigation), as well as any means available on water.

Computerized navigation commonly relies on [[GPS]] for current location information, a [[electronic map|navigational map database]] of roads and navigable routes, and uses [[algorithm]]s related to the [[shortest path problem]] to identify optimal routes.
===Underwater navigation===
{{main|Diver navigation|Submarine navigation}}

==Standards, Training and Organisations==

Professional standards for navigation depend on the type of navigation and vary by country. For marine navigation, [[Merchant Navy]] [[Deck department|deck officers]] are trained and internationally certified according to the [[STCW Convention]].<ref name="STCW">{{cite book |title=Standards of Training and Certification of Watchkeeping' (STCW) Convention |publisher= [[International Maritime Organization]]|date= 2010 }}</ref> Leisure and amateur mariners may undertake lessons in navigation at local/regional training schools. [[Navy|Naval]] officers receive navigation training as part of their naval training. 

In land navigation, courses and training is often provided to young persons as part of general or extra-curricular education. Land navigation is also an essential part of army training. Additionally, organisations such as the [[Scouting|Scouts]] and [[The Duke of Edinburgh's Award|DoE programme]] teach navigation to their students. [[Orienteering]] organisations are a type of sports that require navigational skills using a map and compass to navigate from point to point in diverse and usually unfamiliar terrain whilst moving at speed.<ref>{{cite web

In aviation, pilots undertake [[Air navigation|air navigation]] training as part of learning to fly. 

Professional organisations also assist to encourage improvements in navigation or bring together navigators in learned environments. The [[Royal Institute of Navigation]] (RIN) is a [[learned society]] with charitable status, aimed at furthering the development of navigation on land and sea, in the air and in space. It was founded in 1947 as a forum for mariners, pilots, engineers and academics to compare their experiences and exchange information.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2016|title=The Royal Institute of Navigation - Aims and Objects|journal=Journal of Navigation|volume=69|issue=66|pages= b1–b2 }}</ref> In the US, the [[Institute of Navigation]] (ION) is a non-profit professional organisation advancing the art and science of positioning, navigation and timing.<ref name="ION">{{cite web

 | access-date=February 6, 2020}}</ref>

===Publications===
Numerous [[Nautical publications|nautical publications]] are available on navigation, which are published by professional sources all over the world. In the UK, the [[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office]], the [[Witherby Publishing Group]] and the [[Nautical Institute]] provide numerous navigational publications, including the comprehensive Admiralty Manual of Navigation.<ref name="Manual of Navigation">{{cite web
