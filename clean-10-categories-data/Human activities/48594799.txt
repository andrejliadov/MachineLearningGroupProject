Usually, the ''mink'a'' labor is without salary, such as in the public works projects ''of'' [[Ocra (Peru)|Ocra]], a [[Tenant farmer|campesino]] community in the Andes. Faenas are seen as a labor tribute to the community or a cash-free form of local taxation. ''Mink'a'' is mainly practiced in [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]] and [[Paraguay]].

== Peru ==
In Peru, the concept of ''mink'a'' is associated with [[pre-Columbian]] [[indigenous cultures]]. It is practiced in ''[[mestizo]]'' and ''campesino'' communities of the [[Andes]], where the notion of reciprocity (''[[ayni]]'') organizes community work.  An example of this type of reciprocity is the development of agricultural activities among a dozen neighbors in traditional productive units, or the building of a community kitchen with personal tools and local materials. During the [[Inca Empire]], ''mink'a'' was the basic way in which work was carried out within communities (''[[ayllu]]'') and was also practiced for the benefit of larger territories (''[[mit'a]]''), as part of the services that each ''ayllu'' provided to the whole of the society.  The families participated in the construction of premises, [[Acequia|irrigation canals]], as well as helped in the farm operations of the disabled, and cared for orphans and the elderly.  Due to the great migration to the cities of the Peruvian coast, ''mink'a'' became widespread in the coastal areas of Peru - mostly however within smaller communities where local "taxation" consisting of labor is more feasible than a monetary tax to realize community projects.
