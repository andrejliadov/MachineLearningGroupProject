'''Work''' or '''labour''' is intentional activity people perform to support themselves, others, or the needs and wants of a wider community.<ref name="Def1" /> Alternatively, work can be viewed as the human activity that contributes (along with other [[factors of production]]) towards the [[goods]] and [[service (economics)|service]]s within an [[economy]].<ref name="Def2" />

Work is fundamental to all societies, but can vary widely within and between them, from [[hunting and gathering|gathering]] in [[natural resource]]s by hand, to operating complex [[technology|technologies]] that [[mechanization|substitute for physical]] or [[automation|even mental]] effort by many human beings. All but the simplest tasks also require specific [[skill]]s, equipment or [[tool]]s, and other resources (such as [[material]] for [[manufacturing]] goods).{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=Hopefully non-controversial statements to seed development of article.}} Cultures and individuals across history have expressed a wide range of attitudes towards work. Outside of any specific process or industry, humanity has developed a variety of institutions for situating work in society. 

Besides objective differences, one [[culture]] may organize or attach [[social status]] to work roles differently from another. Throughout history, work has been intimately connected with other aspects of society and [[politics]], such as [[power (social and political)|power]], [[social class|class]], [[tradition]], [[rights]], and [[privilege (law)|privileges]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=More wide-reaching but hopefully non-controversial statements to seed development of article.}} Accordingly, the [[division of labor]] is a prominent topic across the [[social science]]s, as both an abstract concept and a characteristic of individual cultures.<ref name="DivOfLabor" />

Work can take many different forms, as various as the environments, tools, skills, goals, and institutions around a worker.

Because sustained effort is a necessary part of many human activities, what qualifies as work is often a matter of context. Specialization is one common feature that distinguishes work from other activities. For example, a [[sport]] is a [[job]] for a [[professional athlete]] who earns their livelihood from it, but a [[hobby]] to someone playing for fun in their community. An element of advance [[planning]] or expectation is also common, such as when a [[paramedic]] provides medical care while on-duty and fully equipped, rather than performing [[first aid]] off-duty as a bystander to an emergency. [[Self-care]] and basic habits like [[personal grooming]] are also not typically considered work either.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=The logic here shouldn't be original but definitely needs a source.}}

While a later [[gift]], [[trade]], or [[payment]] may retroactively affirm an activity as productive, this can exclude work like [[volunteering]] or what remains within a [[family]], like [[parenting]] or [[housekeeping]]. In some cases, the distinction between work and other activities is simply a matter of [[common sense]] within a community. However, an alternative view is that labeling any activity as work is somewhat subjective, such as [[Mark Twain]] expressed in the "whitewashed fence" scene of [[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=A better example probably exists & the statement about affirmation could use a reference.}}

== Kinds of work ==
There are several ways to categorize and compare different kinds of work. In economics, one popular approach is the [[three-sector model]] or variations of it. In this view, an economy can be separated into three broad categories:
* [[Primary sector]], which extracts food, [[raw material]]s, and other resources from the environment
* [[Secondary sector]], which manufactures physical products, [[refine]]s materials, and provides [[utilities]]
* [[Tertiary sector]], which provides services and helps administer the economy

In complex economies with high specialization, these categories are further subdivided into [[Industry (economics)|industries]] that produce a focused subset of products or services. Some economists also propose additional sectors such as a "knowledge-based" [[quaternary sector]], but this division is neither standardized nor universally accepted.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=Least controversial way could think of to mention the quaternary sector idea.}}

Another common way of contrasting work roles is ranking them according to a criterion, such as the amount of skill, [[experience]], or [[seniority]] associated with a role. The progression from [[apprentice]] through [[journeyman]] to [[master craftsman]] in the [[skilled trade]]s is one example with a long history and analogues in many cultures.

Societies also commonly rank different work roles by perceived status, but this is more subjective and goes beyond clear progressions within a single industry. Some industries may be seen as more prestigious than others overall, even if they include roles with similar functions. At the same time, a wide swathe of roles across all industries may be afforded more status (e.g. [[managerial]] roles) or less (like [[manual labor]]) based on characteristics such as a job being low-paid or [[dirty, dangerous and demeaning]].

Other social dynamics, like how labor is compensated, can even exclude meaningful tasks from a society's conception of work. For example, in modern market-economies where [[wage labor]] or [[piece work]] predominates, [[unpaid work]] may be omitted from economic analysis or even cultural ideas of what qualifies as work.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=Don't think this overstates the unpaid work issue, but definitely needs a strong citation.}}

At a political level, different roles can fall under separate [[institution]]s where workers have qualitatively different power or rights. In the extreme, the least powerful members of society may be [[social stigma|stigmatized]] (as in [[untouchability]]) or even violently forced (via [[slavery]]) into performing the least desirable work. Complementary to this, [[elite]]s may have exclusive access to the most prestigious work, largely symbolic [[sinecure]]s, or even a "life of [[leisure]]."

== Workers ==
Work cannot be done in a vacuum and individual workers require several things, like sufficient [[health]] and resources, to succeed at even the simplest tasks.

=== Physiology ===

[[File:Production Line - Wrights Biscuits.jpg|thumb|left|A woman at work in an English biscuit factory]]
As living beings, humans require a baseline of good health, [[nutrition]], rest, and other physical needs in able to reliably exert themselves. This is particularly true of physical labor that places direct demands on the body, but even largely mental work can cause [[stress (biology)|stress]] from problems like long hours, excessive demands, or a hostile workplace.

Particularly intense forms of manual labor often lead workers to develop [[physical strength]] necessary for their job. However, this activity does not necessarily improve a worker's overall [[physical fitness]] like [[exercise]], due to problems like [[overwork]] or a small set of repetitive motions.<ref name="PhysActParadox" /> In these physical jobs, maintaining good [[human position|posture]] or movements with proper technique is also a crucial skill for avoiding [[injury]]. Ironically, [[white-collar worker]]s who are [[sedentary]] throughout the workday may also suffer from long-term health problems due to a lack of physical activity.

=== Training ===
[[Learning]] the necessary skills for work is often a complex process in its own right, requiring intentional [[training]]. In traditional societies, know-how for different tasks can be passed to each new generation through [[oral tradition]] and working under adult guidance. For work that is more specialized and technically complex, however, a more formal system of [[education]] is usually necessary. A complete [[curriculum]] ensures that a worker in training has some exposure to all major aspects of their specialty, in both [[theory]] and [[praxis (process)|practice]].

=== Equipment and technology ===

Tool use has been a central aspect of [[human evolution]] and is also an essential feature of work. Even in technologically advanced societies, many workers' toolsets still include a number of smaller hand-tools, designed to be held and operated by a single person, often without supplementary [[power (physics)|power]]. This is especially true when tasks can be handled by one or a few workers, don't require significant physical power, and are somewhat self-paced, like in many services or [[handicraft]] manufacturing.

For other tasks needing large amounts of power, such as in the [[construction]] industry, or involving a highly-repetitive set of simple actions, like in [[mass manufacturing]], complex [[machine]]s can carry out much of the effort. The workers present will focus on more complex tasks, operating controls, or performing [[maintenance (technical)|maintenance]]. Over several millennia, [[invention]], [[science|scientific discovery]], and [[engineering]] principles have allowed humans to proceed from creating [[simple machine]]s that merely redirect or amplify [[force]], through [[engine]]s for harnessing supplementary power sources, to today's complex, regulated systems that automate many steps within a work process.

In the 20th century, the development of [[electronics]] and new [[mathematical]] insights led to the creation and widespread adoption of fast, general-purpose [[computer]]s. Just as mechanization can substitute for the physical labor of many human beings, computers allow for the partial automation of mental work previously carried out by human workers, such as [[computer (job description)|calculations]], [[transcription (service)|document transcription]], and basic [[customer service]] requests. [[Research & development]] of related technologies like [[machine learning]] and [[robotics]] continues into the 21st century.

Beyond tools and machines used to actively perform tasks, workers benefit when other passive elements of their work and environment are [[designed]] properly. This includes everything from personal items like [[workwear]] and [[safety gear]] to features of the workspace itself like [[furniture]], [[lighting]], [[HVAC|air quality]], and even the underlying [[architecture]].

== In society ==
=== Organizations ===
Even if workers are personally ready to perform their jobs, coordination is required for any effort outside of individual [[subsistence]] to succeed. At the level of a small team working on a single task, only cooperation and good communication may be necessary. As the complexity of a work process increases though, requiring more planning or more workers focused on specific tasks, a reliable [[organization]] becomes more critical.

Economic organizations often reflect social thought common to their time and place, such as ideas about [[human nature]] or [[hierarchy]]. These unique organizations can also be historically significant, even forming major pillars of an [[economic system]]. In European history, for instance, the decline of [[guild]]s and rise of [[joint-stock companies]] goes hand-in-hand with other changes, like the growth of centralized [[state (polity)|state]]s and [[capitalism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=They're strong statements but should check out against a detailed reference.}}

In industrialized economies, [[labor union]]s are another significant organization. In isolation, a worker that is easily replaceable in the [[labor market]] has little power to demand better wages or conditions. By banding together and interacting with business owners as a [[corporate]] entity, the same workers can claim a larger share of the value created by their labor. While a union does require workers to sacrifice some autonomy in relation to their coworkers, it can grant workers more control over the work process itself in addition to material benefits.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=Think this is accurate without being biased for or against unions.}}

=== Institutions ===
The need for planning and coordination extends beyond individual organizations to society as a whole too. Both effective [[resource allocation]] to provide necessities and materials and [[fixed investment|investment]] in equipment and facilities are key to the success of any work project. In smaller, traditional societies, these aspects can be mostly regulated through [[convention (norm)|custom]], though as societies grow, more extensive methods become necessary.

These complex institutions, however, still have roots in common human activities. Even in modern states, the [[free market]]s of capitalist societies rely fundamentally on [[trade]] while [[administrative-command system|command economies]], such as in most [[communist state]]s until the late 20th century, rely on a highly [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] and hierarchical form of [[redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=More strong statements but would be surprising if they're original synthesis or unverifiable.}}

Other institutions can affect workers even more directly by delimiting practical day-to-day life or basic legal rights. For example, a [[caste]] system may restrict families to a narrow range of jobs, inherited from parent to child. In [[serfdom]], a [[peasant]] has more rights than a slave but is attached to a specific piece of land and largely under the power of the [[landholder]], even requiring permission to physically travel outside the land-holding. How institutions play out in individual workers' lives can be complex too; in most societies where wage-labor predominates, workers possess equal rights by law and mobility in theory. Without social support or other resources, however, the necessity of earning a livelihood may force a worker to cede some rights and freedoms in fact.

=== Values ===
Despite the universal need for work, societies and [[subculture]]s may value work in general, or specific kinds of it, very differently. When social status or [[virtue]] is strongly associated with leisure and opposed to tedium, then work itself can become indicative of low social rank and devalued. In the opposite case, a society may hold strongly to a [[work ethic]] where
work itself is seen as virtuous. An example of this is German sociologist [[Max Weber]]'s hypothesis that capitalism originated in a [[Protestant work ethic]] that had evolved from the [[Reformation]] in Northern Europe.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=The contrast is a meaningful claim, plus the reference to Weber clearly could use a reference.}}

For some, work may hold a spiritual value in addition to any secular notions. Especially in some [[monastic]] or [[mystical]] strands of several [[religion]]s, simple manual labor may be held in high regard as a way to maintain the body, cultivate self-discipline and humility, and focus the mind.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=Don't think this misrepresents the case but definitely could use a reference.}}

=== Current issues ===
The contemporary [[world economy]] has brought many changes, overturning some previously widespread labor issues. At the same time, some longstanding issues remain relevant, and other new ones have emerged. One issue that continues despite many improvements is [[unfree labor]] and [[human trafficking]]. Though ideas about universal rights and the economic benefits of free labor have significantly diminished the prevalence of outright slavery, it continues in lawless areas, or in attenuated forms on the margins of many economies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=Think this covers the issue without overreaching or being too florid; obviously needs a reference.}}

Another difficulty, which has emerged in most societies as a result of [[urbanization]] and [[industrialization]], is [[unemployment]]. While the shift from a subsistence economy usually increases the overall [[productivity]] of society and lifts many out of [[poverty]], it removes a baseline of material security from those who cannot find [[employment]] or other support. Governments have tried a range of strategies to mitigate the problem, such as improving the efficiency of [[job matching]], conditionally providing [[welfare]] benefits or [[unemployment insurance]], or even directly overriding the labor market through work-relief programs or a [[job guarantee]]. Since a job forms a major part of many workers' [[self-identity]], unemployment can have severe psychological and social consequences beyond the financial insecurity it causes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=Shouldn't overstate anything but needs a couple references.}}

One more issue, which may not directly interfere with the functioning of an economy but can have significant indirect effects, is when governments fail to account for work occurring out-of-view from the public sphere. This may be important, uncompensated work occurring everyday in private life; or it may be [[criminal]] activity that involves clear but furtive economic exchanges. By ignoring or failing to understand these activities, economic policies can have counter-intuitive effects and cause strains on the community and society.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=Simultaneously vague and far-reaching paragraph, but expanding it should be possible with a good reference.}}
