A '''cameo role''' or '''cameo appearance''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|æ|m|i|oʊ}}; often shortened to just '''cameo''') is a brief appearance or voice part of a well-known person in a work of the [[performing arts]]. These roles are generally small, many of them non-speaking ones, and are commonly either appearances in a work in which they hold some special significance (such as actors from an original movie appearing in its remake) or renowned people making uncredited appearances. Short appearances by [[Celebrity|celebrities]], [[film director]]s, [[politician]]s, [[athlete]]s or [[musician]]s are common. A crew member of the movie or show playing a minor role can be referred to as a cameo as well, such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|frequently performed cameos]].

==Concept==
Originally, in the 1920s, "cameo role" meant "a small character part that stands out from the other minor parts". The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] connects this with the meaning "a short literary sketch or portrait", which is based on the literal meaning of "[[Cameo (carving)|cameo]]", a miniature carving on a gemstone.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, "Cameo".</ref> More recently (late 20th century), "cameo" has come to refer to any short appearances, as a character, such as the examples below.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cameo in Film topic |url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/Film-topic/cameo |publisher=Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English |accessdate=9 January 2017 |quote=a short appearance in a film or play by a well-known actor}}</ref>

Cameos are generally not credited because of their brevity, or a perceived mismatch between the celebrity's stature and the film or television series in which they are appearing. Many are [[publicity stunt]]s. Others are acknowledgements of an actor's contribution to an earlier work, as in the case of many [[film adaptation]]s of television series, or of [[remake]]s of earlier films. Others honour artists or celebrities known for work in a particular field.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

One of the best-known series of cameos was by [[Stan Lee]], who made [[List of cameo appearances by Stan Lee|very brief appearances in most of Marvel movies]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techinsider.io/every-stan-lee-cameo-2016-2 |title=Stan Lee has made 28 cameos in Marvel movies and shows — here they are |work=[[Tech Insider]] |access-date=18 February 2017 |date=16 February 2016 |first=Sidney |last=Fussell |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808150333/http://www.techinsider.io/every-stan-lee-cameo-2016-2 |archive-date=8 August 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Cameos also occur in [[novel]]s and other literary works. "Literary cameos" usually involve an established character from another work who makes a brief appearance to establish a [[shared universe]] setting, to make a point, or to offer [[Homage (arts)|homage]]. [[Balzac]] often employed this practice, as in his ''[[La Comédie humaine|Comédie humaine]]''. Sometimes a cameo features a historical person who "drops in" on fictional characters in a [[historical novel]], as when [[Benjamin Franklin]] shares a [[beer]] with Phillipe Charboneau in ''[[The Bastard (novel)|The Bastard]]'' by [[John Jakes]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

A cameo appearance can be made by the author of a work to put a sort of personal "signature" on a story. [[Vladimir Nabokov]] often put himself in his novels, for instance as the very minor character Vivian Darkbloom (an anagram of his name) in ''[[Lolita]]''.<ref name="Straumann2008">{{cite book|last=Straumann|first=Barbara|title=Figurations of Exile in Hitchcock and Nabokov|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AqrBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA114|year=2008|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3647-1|page=114}}</ref>

===Film directors===
{{further|List of directors who appear in their own films}}

[[Alfred Hitchcock]] is known for [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|his frequently performed cameos in his movies]], as early as in his third film [[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog|''The Lodger'']] (1927). In ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'', as the action was restricted to the titular lifeboat, Hitchcock appeared in a newspaper ad.

[[Quentin Tarantino]] provides cameos or [[Bit part|small role]]s in at least 10 of his movies.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vincent|first1=Alice|last2=Saunders|first2=Tristram Fane|title=Quentin Tarantino: his 10 best cameo roles|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/hateful-eight/quentin-tarantino-best-cameo-roles/|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=10 December 2015}}</ref>

Likewise, [[Peter Jackson]] has made brief cameos in all of his movies, except for his first feature-length film ''[[Bad Taste]]'' in which he plays a main character, as well as ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', though a portrait of him appears in the film. For example, he plays a peasant eating a carrot in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]''; a Rohan warrior in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' and a Corsair of Umbar boatswain in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''. All four were non-speaking "blink and you miss him" appearances, although in the Extended Release of ''The Return of the King'', his character was given more screen time and his reprise of the carrot eating peasant in ''The Desolation of Smaug'' was featured in the foreground in reference to ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' - last seen twelve years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sumra|first1=Husain|title=Did you know that Peter Jackson made cameos in the Lord of the Rings films?|url=http://www.swiftfilm.com/did-you-know-that-peter-jackson-made-cameos-in-the-lord-of-the-rings-films/|publisher=Swiftfilm|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=14 December 2011}}</ref>

Director [[Martin Scorsese]] appears in the background of his films as a bystander or an [[unseen character]]. In ''[[Who's That Knocking at My Door]]'' (1967), he appears as one of the gangsters; he is a lighting crewman in ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985) and a passenger in ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976). He opens up his film ''[[The Color of Money]]'' (1986) with a monologue on the art of playing pool. In addition, he appears with his wife and daughter as wealthy New Yorkers in ''[[Gangs of New York]]'', and he appears as a theatre-goer and is heard as a movie projectionist in ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In a same way, [[Roman Polanski]] appears as a hired hoodlum in his film ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974), slitting Jack Nicholson's nose with the blade of his clasp knife.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Roger|title=Story of the scene: 'Chinatown' Roman Polanski (1974)|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/story-of-the-scene-chinatown-roman-polanski-1974-819366.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=1 May 2008}}</ref>

===Actors and writers===
Directors sometimes cast well-known lead actors with whom they have worked in the past in other films. [[Mike Todd]]'s film ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956) was filled with cameo roles: [[John Gielgud]] as an English butler, [[Frank Sinatra]] playing piano in a saloon, and others. The stars in cameo roles were pictured in oval insets in posters for the film, and gave the term wide circulation outside the theatrical profession.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), an "epic comedy", also features cameos from nearly every popular American comedian alive at the time, including [[The Three Stooges]], [[Jerry Lewis]], a silent appearance by [[Buster Keaton]] and a voice-only cameo by [[Selma Diamond]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Sobczynski |first=Peter |title="It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" Gets the Deluxe Treatment from Criterion |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/its-a-mad-mad-mad-mad-world-gets-the-deluxe-treatment-from-criterion |work=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=15 September 2016 |date=21 January 2014}}</ref>

''[[Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood]]'' (1976) features cameos from dozens of actors from Hollywood's golden age.

[[Aaron Sorkin]] also had cameos in some works he wrote: as a bar customer speaking about the law in his debut film screenplay ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992), as an advertising executive in ''[[The Social Network]]'' and as a guest at the inauguration of President [[Matt Santos]] in the final episode of ''[[The West Wing]]''.

[[Franco Nero]], the actor who portrayed the Django character in the original [[Django (1966 film)|1966 film]], appears in a bar scene of the Tarantino film ''[[Django Unchained]]''. There, he asks Django ([[Jamie Foxx]]) to spell his name, which led to the famous promotional tagline for the film - "The 'D' is silent". Franco's character responds simply, "I know."

Many cameos featured in ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'' (1994), directed by [[Richard Donner]]. Among them, [[Danny Glover]] &ndash; [[Mel Gibson]]'s co-star in the ''[[Lethal Weapon (film series)|Lethal Weapon]]'' franchise also directed by Donner &ndash; appears as the lead [[bank robber]]. He and Maverick (Gibson) share a scene where they look as if they knew each other, but then shake it off. As Glover makes his escape with the money, he mutters "I'm too old for this shit", his character's [[catchphrase]] in the ''Lethal Weapon'' films. In addition, a strain of the main [[Theme (music)|theme]] from ''Lethal Weapon'' plays in the [[Film score|score]] when Glover is revealed. Actress [[Margot Kidder]] made a cameo appearance in the same film as a robbed villager: she had previously starred as [[Lois Lane]] in Donner's ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978).<ref name=RevEbert>{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19940520/REVIEWS/405200302 |title=Maverick |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]] |date=20 May 1994 |access-date=15 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511023955/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19940520%2FREVIEWS%2F405200302 |archive-date=11 May 2011 |author-link=Roger Ebert |via=[[rogerebert.com]] |url-status=live }}</ref>
