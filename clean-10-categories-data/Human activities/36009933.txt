The '''Aldwych farces''' were a series of twelve stage [[farce]]s presented at the [[Aldwych Theatre]], London, nearly continuously from 1923 to 1933. All but three of them were written by [[Ben Travers]]. They incorporate and develop British [[low comedy]] styles, combined with clever word-play. The plays were presented by the actor-manager [[Tom Walls]] and starred Walls and [[Ralph Lynn]], supported by a regular company that included [[Robertson Hare]], [[Mary Brough]], [[Winifred Shotter]], [[Ethel Coleridge]], and [[Gordon James (actor)|Gordon James]]. 

The farces were so popular that touring companies were sent to present them in the British provinces.  Most of the Aldwych farces were adapted for film in the 1930s, starring the original stage casts as far as possible. The plays were later seen in television versions, and some enjoyed revivals.

==History==
[[Leslie Henson]] and [[Tom Walls]] co-produced the farce ''[[Tons of Money (play)|Tons of Money]]'' in 1922 at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]]. This was a great popular success, running for nearly two years, and they collaborated again, moving to the [[Aldwych Theatre]]. Walls secured a cheap, long-term lease on the theatre, which had fallen so far out of fashion with playgoers that it had been used as a [[YMCA]] hostel during the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref name=prog>Programme booklet for ''Plunder'', [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], March 1976, p. 9</ref>

The first in the Aldwych farce series was ''[[It Pays to Advertise (play)|It Pays to Advertise]]'', which ran for nearly 600 performances.<ref name=times>"Mr. Ralph Lynn", ''[[The Times]]'', 10 August 1962, p. 11</ref> Meanwhile, [[Ben Travers]]' first play, ''The Dippers'', based on his 1920 novel of the same name, was produced and directed by [[Charles Hawtrey (19th century actor)|Sir Charles Hawtrey]].<ref>"The Dippers", ''[[Western Daily Press]]'', 24 May 1922, p. 4</ref> It became a success on tour from 1921 and in another London theatre in 1922.<ref>"Travers, Master of Farce, Bows Out", ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', 19 December 1980, p. 8</ref> [[Lawrence Grossmith]] had acquired the rights to Travers' farce ''[[A Cuckoo in the Nest]]'' and sold them to Walls.<ref>{{cite web|title=Travers, Ben |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/92341|accessdate=23 June 2020|publisher=British Film Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114131900/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/92341|archive-date=14 January 2009}}</ref>

It took Travers some time to establish a satisfactory working relationship with Walls, whom he found difficult as an [[actor-manager]], and also distressingly unprepared as an actor. In the early days, he also had reservations about the other star of the company, [[Ralph Lynn]], who initially [[ad libitum|ad-libbed]] too much for the author's taste.<ref>Travers noted that the ad-libbing diminished as he came to anticipate and include in his scripts "the sort of thing Ralph himself would have said in the circumstances". Travers, p. 91</ref> Travers built on each play, and the characterisations in the earlier plays, in writing the next farce for the company; and even Walls' calls to the stage manager for lines became a popular part of opening nights at the Aldwych.<ref name=Selective>Smith, pp. 50–69</ref>

The Aldwych farces also featured a regular team of supporting actors: [[Robertson Hare]] as a figure of put-upon respectability; [[Mary Brough]] in eccentric old lady roles; [[Ethel Coleridge]] as the severe voice of authority; the saturnine [[Gordon James (actor)|Gordon James]] as the "heavy"; and first [[Yvonne Arnaud]], then [[Winifred Shotter]], as the sprightly young female lead.<ref>Trussler, p. 278</ref> The plays generally revolved around a series of preposterous incidents involving a misunderstanding, borrowed clothes and lost trousers, involving the worldly Walls character, the innocent yet cheeky Lynn, the hapless Hare, the beefy, domineering Brough, the lean, domineering Coleridge, and the pretty and slightly spicy Shotter, all played with earnest seriousness.<ref name=Selective/> The scripts incorporated and developed British [[low comedy]] styles, particularly "silly-asses, henpecked husbands, battleaxe mothers-in-law and lots of innocent misunderstandings."<ref>[http://www.britishpictures.com/stars/Walls.htm Archive: "Tom Walls (1883 – 1949)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916142827/http://www.britishpictures.com/stars/Walls.htm |date=16 September 2012 }}, British Pictures.com, accessed 2 June 2012</ref> 

The farces proved popular, and touring casts were regularly sent to the provinces.<ref>"Local and District News", ''[[Western Gazette]]'', 15 August 1930, pp. 4–5; and "Aldwych Farce at the Repertory", ''[[Western Morning News]]'', 13 May 1933, p. 5</ref> Some touring players, such as William Daunt (1893–1938) who played the Ralph Lynn roles, made considerable personal successes in the 1920s playing Aldwych farces in the provinces.<ref>"Prince's Theatre: Rookery Nook", ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'', 14 December 1926, p. 13</ref> Lynn's younger brother Hastings Lynn, played his brother's roles in successful productions in Australia and New Zealand.<ref>"Criterion – A Cuckoo In The Nest", ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 31 December 1927, p. 7; "Rookery Nook", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 21 April 1928, p. 12; "Criterion – Thark", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 2 June 1928, p. 10; and "Stage Jottings", ''[[Auckland Star]]'', Volume LIX, Issue 201, 25 August 1928, p. 2</ref> Among the up-and-coming performers who appeared in Aldwych farces before becoming famous were [[Roger Livesey]],<ref>"Aldwych Theatre", ''The Times'', 23 July 1925, p. 12</ref> [[Margot Grahame]],<ref name= anlt>"Aldwych Theatre", ''The Times'' , 19 February 1930, p. 12</ref> and [[Norma Varden]].<ref name=anlt/>

After five years of extraordinary success, Walls' business partnership with Henson ended in September 1927 during the run of ''[[Thark (play)|Thark]]'', and from October, the Aldwych farces were presented by the firm of Tom Walls and Reginald Highley Ltd.<ref>"Theatres", ''The Times'', 28 September 1927, p. 12; and 3 October 1927, p. 12</ref> By 1930, Walls was losing interest in the theatre, turning his attention to the cinema. He did not appear in the last three of the twelve Aldwych farces, which had disappointing runs. The last of them, ''[[A Bit of a Test]]'' in 1933, ran for 142 performances, compared with runs of more than 400 performances for some of the earlier productions.<ref name=times/>

In 1952, three years after Walls's death, Lynn and Hare starred at the Aldwych in a new Travers farce, ''[[Wild Horses (play)|Wild Horses]]''. It ran from 6 November 1952 to 11 April 1953.<ref>"The Theatres", ''The Times'', 3 November 1952, p. 9, and 27 March 1953, p. 2</ref> In the 1950s and early 1960s, a similar hit series of farces began at the [[Whitehall Theatre]] and came to be known as [[Whitehall farces]].<ref name=Selective/><ref>Nightingale, Benedict.
