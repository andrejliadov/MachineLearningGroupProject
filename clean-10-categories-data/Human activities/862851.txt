A state government may have some level of political [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]], or be subject to the direct control of the federal government. This relationship may be defined by a [[constitution]].

The reference to "state" denotes country subdivisions which are officially or widely known as "states", and should not be confused with a "[[sovereign state]]". Most federations designate their federal units "state" or the equivalent term in the local language; however in some federations other designations are used such as [[Oblast]] or [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Republic]]. Some federations are [[Asymmetric federalism|asymmetric]], designating greater powers to some federal units than others.

Provinces are usually divisions of unitary states but occasionally the designation is also given to the federal units such as the [[Provinces of Argentina]] or [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canada]]. Their governments, which are also ''provincial governments'', are not the subject of this article.


==Australia==
{{main|States and territories of Australia}}
The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] is a [[Federation|federal]] nation with six states (and two mainland territories). [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution]] sets out the division of [[legislature|legislative]] power between the states and the Commonwealth (federal) government. The Commonwealth government is given a variety of legislative powers, including control of [[foreign policy]], [[taxation]] (although this cannot discriminate between states or parts of states), and regulation of interstate [[commerce]] and [[corporations]].<ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/par5cha1.htm Section 51 of the Australian Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014193759/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/par5cha1.htm |date=2011-10-14 }} at theamericanParliament website</ref> Since the original ratification of the constitution, the [[High Court of Australia]] has settled a number of disputes concerning the extent of the Commonwealth's legislative powers, some of which have been controversial and extensively criticised; these included a dispute in 1982 over whether the Commonwealth was entitled to designate land for national heritage purposes under [[United Nations]] agreements,<ref>Barwick, Sir Garfield, [http://www.samuelgriffith.org.au/papers/html/volume6/v6chap1.htm A View of the External Affairs Power], Samuel Griffith Society</ref> as well as numerous disputes over the extent of the Commonwealth's power over [[trade union]] and [[industrial relations]] legislation.<ref>{{cite web |author=Creighton, Breen |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/2000/33.html |title=One Hundred Years of the Conciliation and Arbitration Power: A Province Lost?}} (2000) 24(3) Melbourne University Law Review 839.</ref>

One difference between the Australian and [[United States]] models of federalism is that, in Australia, the Commonwealth Parliament has explicit constitutional power over [[marriage]] legislation; this has been a focal point for recent controversies over [[same-sex marriage]].<ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2001-02/02rn17.pdf The High Court and the Meaning of 'Marriage' in Section 51(xxi) of the Constitution], Australian Parliamentary Library</ref>

===Government structure===
{{see also|Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|Premiers of the Australian states}}

Each state of Australia has a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]], who represents the [[Queen of Australia]] (currently [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]]) and performs the ceremonial duties of a [[head of state]]. Unlike the Canadian lieutenant-governors, a state governor is appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the state government, not the federal government. Every state also has a [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|parliament]]; most states have a [[bicameral]] parliament, except for [[Queensland]], where the upper chamber (the [[Legislative Council]]) was abolished in 1922.<ref>[https://sscinfo.in/ssc-stenographer-answer-key/]{{Dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, Queensland Parliament website</ref> Like their [[India]]n counterparts, Australian states have a [[Westminster system]] of parliamentary government; the head of government, known in each state as a [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]], is drawn from the  state parliament.

==Austria==
In Austria, a ''Landtag'' (state parliament) elects a ''Landeshauptmann'', who is not only the chairman of a state government, but also the representative of the federal government and responsible for the enforcement of federal legislation. 

==India==
{{see also|State governments of India|Union List|State List}}
In [[India]], the state governments are the level of governments below the [[Government of India]]. India is a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic with a [[Parliamentary system]] of government. The Republic is governed in terms of the [[Constitution of India]]. Sovereignty is shared between the union and the state government, but the union government is given greater powers. The [[President of India|President]] is the constitutional head Executive of the State. Real executive power vests in a [[Union Council of Ministers]] with the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] as head of government. The [[States and union territories of India|States]] resembles the [[Federalism in India|federal system]]. In the states, the [[Governor (India)|Governor]] is the head of Executive, but real executive power vests with the [[Chief Minister (India)|Chief Minister]] who heads the [[Council of Ministers]]. The judicial setup of the country is headed by the [[Chief Justice of India]] at federal level, who presides over one of the largest judicial apparatus dispensing criminal, civil and all other forms of litigation, and [[Chief Justice]]s of the [[List of high courts in India|High Courts]] at state level. The government head of its legal wing is the [[Attorney General of India]] at federal level and [[Advocate general (India)|Advocate General]] at state level.

== Nigeria==
{{see also|States of Nigeria}}
In [[Nigeria]], States are constituent political entities of which there are currently 36. States have an elected [[Governor]] and legislature and broad powers in some areas. Powers not given to the states belong to the [[Federal government of Nigeria|federal government]] under the [[Constitution of Nigeria]].

==Pakistan==
{{see also|Provincial Governments of Pakistan}}
In [[Pakistan]], the [[Provinces of Pakistan]] are the federal units. There are currently four.

The Provincial Governments are each headed formally by a [[Provincial Governors of Pakistan|Provincial Governor]] but for practical purposes power is exercised by the [[Chief Minister]], in a [[parliamentary system]] similar to that of the Federal government of Pakistan .

==South Africa==
{{main|Provincial governments of South Africa}}
South Africa is usually considered a [[unitary state]] but its government system possesses a strong similarity to a federal one. The [[Constitution of South Africa]] does not describe the state as federal or unitary.

South Africa is divided into [[Provinces of South Africa|nine provinces]] which have their own elected governments. Chapter Six of the [[Constitution of South Africa]] describes the division of power between the national government and the provincial governments, listing those "functional areas" of government that are exclusively reserved to the provincial governments and those where both levels of government have concurrent powers; the remaining areas not listed are reserved to the national government. In areas where both levels have concurrent powers there is a complex set of rules in the event of a conflict between national and provincial legislation. Generally in such a case the provincial legislation prevails, but national legislation may prescribe standards and frameworks for provinces to follow, and may prevent provinces from adversely affecting national interests or the interests of other provinces. The functional areas in which the provincial governments have powers include agriculture, arts and culture, primary and secondary education, the environment and tourism, health, housing, roads and transport, and social welfare.

The provincial governments are structured according to a [[parliamentary system]] in which the executive is dependent on and accountable to the legislature. The unicameral [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislature]] is elected by [[party-list proportional representation]], and the legislature in turn elects one of its members as [[Premier (South Africa)|Premier]] to head the executive. The Premier appoints an [[Executive Council (South Africa)|Executive Council]] (a cabinet), consisting of members of the legislature, to administer the various [[government department|departments]] of the provincial administration.

==United States==
{{See also|State governments of the United States}}
The United States is divided into 50 [[U.S. state|states]], which comprise the [[Federated state|federal entities.]] Under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|10th Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], all governmental powers not granted to the [[Federal government of the United States]] nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, making the United States a decentralised federation. However, [[State law (United States)|State law]] is trumped by [[Federal law]] when the two may come into contact. U.S. states all share a similar system of government to the national level with a directly elected and usually quite powerful executive styled [[Governor (United States)|Governor]] and a [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] exercising legislative authority. In 49 states out of 50 as well as three of the inhabited [[Territories of the United States]] ([[Puerto Rico]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], and [[American Samoa]]), the legislature is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] with the houses commonly, though not exclusively being styled [[House of Representatives]] and [[Senate]] although the name of the legislative body as a whole varies between the states (the most common are [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] (Itself sometimes a term for the lower house of a state legislature) such as in [[North Carolina]] or simply [[Texas Legislature|Legislature]] as in [[Texas]]). In [[Nebraska]], [[United States Virgin Islands]] and [[Guam]] (the latter two being federal territories rather than states) the legislature is [[Unicameralism|unicameral]].  
 
The states are semi-sovereign republics in their own right and maintain much control over their internal affairs with issues such as [[public transport]] and [[law enforcement]] generally being the domain of state governments (although the Federal government often works with states in these areas). Large portions of the welfare state in the United States are administered at a state level as well which means that levels of social services vary from state to state. This has sometimes been controversial, such as in the case of [[Medicaid expansion]].  
 
There are also several territories, the most notable of which is [[Puerto Rico]]. Puerto Rico is treated in a manner similar to a state in many areas but in others is quite different. Most notably it does not have representation in the [[United States Congress]] other than its non-voting [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico]]. However, it does enjoy more autonomy in taxation and some other areas than the states and thus is commonly classified as a sort of [[autonomous region]] for the [[Puerto Rican people]], who are culturally distinct from the Americans on the mainland. There exists a [[Political status of Puerto Rico|debate as to the future status of the territory]] with proposals including [[Statehood movement in Puerto Rico|full statehood]], [[Status quo movement in Puerto Rico|maintenance of the autonomous territory status]], or some form of [[independence]] (either [[Free association movement in Puerto Rico|retaining limited reliance upon the United States]] or [[Independence movement in Puerto Rico|full independence with no special relationship]])
