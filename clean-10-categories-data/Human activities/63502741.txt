The following is the '''list of teams to overcome 3–0 series deficits'''. The listed teams won four consecutive games after being down three games to none in a [[playoff format|best-of-seven playoff series]].

==Background==
[[File:Boston Red Sox George W. Bush 2005.jpg|thumb|right|The [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|2004 Boston Red Sox]], seen here at the [[White House]], were the first MLB team to force a game seven after being down 0–3 in a series.]]
Three major North American professional [[sports league]]s have playoff series that can reach a [[Game seven|seventh game]]: [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), and the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).

In the history of these leagues, teams that were down 3–0 in a series have come back to win the series five times; four times in the NHL and once in MLB.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2014/10/15/6983961/orioles-royals-alcs-teams-down-0-3-playoffs-postseason-baseball |title=A brief history of teams down 0-3 in a best-of-seven series |first=Grant |last=Brisbee |website=[[SB Nation]] |date=October 21, 2015 |accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref> The most recent example is the [[Los Angeles Kings]] of the NHL in the [[2014 Stanley Cup playoffs]]. The only instance in a championship finals series was by the NHL's [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in the [[1942 Stanley Cup Finals]].<ref name="nhl-list" />

Conversely, teams have had their 3–0 comeback fall short after evening a series nine times: five in the NHL, three in the NBA, and one in MLB. The most recent example is the [[Houston Astros]] of MLB in the [[2020 American League Championship Series]].<ref name="astros-game-7" />

No team has overcome multiple 3–0 deficits in a single postseason, although the [[1974–75 New York Islanders season|1974–75 New York Islanders]] of the NHL nearly did so; they successfully overcame a 3–0 series deficit in the 1975 quarterfinals, then rallied from a 3–0 series deficit in the semifinals before losing the seventh game.<ref name="nhl-list" />

While seven-game series were traditionally used only for the final series of a postseason, MLB adopted a best-of-seven format for its semi-finals (the [[League Championship Series]]) in 1985,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportscasting.com/mlb-2-reasons-baseballs-best-of-5-playoff-series-format-is-terrible |title=MLB 2 Reasons Baseballs Best-of-5 Playoff Series Format is Terrible |first=Dave |last=Consolazio |website=[[Sportscasting]] |date=October 8, 2019 |accessdate=October 28, 2020}}</ref> the NHL followed suit for its first round in 1987,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://records.nhl.com/history/playoff-formats |title=All-Time Playoff Formats |accessdate=October 28, 2020}}</ref> and the NBA did the same for its first round in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fansided.com/2017/10/12/nba-playoff-reform-adam-silver-history/ |title=Throwback Thursday: The history of NBA playoff reformatting |first=Rich |last=Kraetsch|website=Fansided |accessdate=October 28, 2020}}</ref>

Outside of the noted major North American leagues, various other leagues across multiples sports also use seven-game postseason series. There are several known instances of teams in such leagues overcoming 3–0 series deficits.
