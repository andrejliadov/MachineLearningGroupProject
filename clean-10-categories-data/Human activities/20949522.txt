Various commentators have noted the necessity of bureaucracies in modern society. The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] (1864-1920) argued that bureaucracy constitutes the most efficient and rational way in which human activity can be organized and that systematic processes and organized hierarchies are necessary to maintain order, to maximize [[efficiency]], and to eliminate favoritism. On the other hand, Weber also saw unfettered bureaucracy as a threat to [[individual freedom]], with the potential of trapping individuals in an impersonal "[[iron cage]]" of rule-based, rational control.<ref name="Bureaucratic" /><ref name="GRitzer" />

[[Modern bureaucracy]] has been defined{{by whom?|date=November 2020}} as comprising four features:<ref>

[[File:Civilserviceexam1.jpg|thumb|Students competed in [[imperial examination]]s to receive a position in the bureaucracy of [[Imperial China]].]]
Although the term "bureaucracy" first originated in the mid-18th century, organized and consistent administrative systems existed much earlier. The development of writing ({{circa}} 3500 BC) and the use of documents was critical to the administration of this system, and the first definitive emergence of bureaucracy occurred in ancient [[Sumer]], where an emergent class of [[scribe]]s used [[clay tablet]]s to administer the harvest and to allocate its spoils.<ref name="Scribes">Compare: {{cite book|title= Civilizations of the Ancient Near East|editor= Jack M.

====Ashanti Empire====
The government of the [[Ashanti Empire]] was built upon a sophisticated bureaucracy in [[Kumasi]], with separate [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] which saw to the handling of state affairs. Ashanti's Foreign Office was based in Kumasi. Despite the small size of the office, it allowed the state to pursue complex negotiations with foreign powers. The Office was divided into departments that handled Ashanti relations separately with the [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], and [[Arab]]s. Scholars of Ashanti history, such as Larry Yarak and [[Ivor Wilks|Ivor Wilkes]], disagree over the power of this sophisticated bureaucracy in comparison to the [[Asantehene]]. However, both scholars agree that it was a sign of a highly developed government with a complex system of [[Separation of powers|checks and balances]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Historical Reminisciences: Great Empires Of Yore (Part 15) By Mike Ozekhome, SAN|url=https://thenigerialawyer.com/historical-reminisciences-great-empires-of-yore-part-15-by-mike-ozekhome-san/|last=Chioma|first=Unini|date=2020-03-15|website=TheNigeriaLawyer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-30}}</ref>

Instead of the inefficient and often corrupt system of [[tax farming]] that prevailed in [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] states such as France, the [[Exchequer]] was able to exert control over the entire system of tax revenue and government expenditure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/workingPapers/2012/WP167.pdf|title=3 Public finance in China and Britain in the long eighteenth century|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref> By the late 18th century, the ratio of fiscal bureaucracy to population in Britain was approximately 1 in 1300, almost four times larger than the second most heavily bureaucratized nation, France.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPxlQgAACAAJ|title=States and Economic Development: A Comparative Historical Analysis|author1=Linda Weiss |author2=John Hobson |year=1995|publisher=Wiley|accessdate=2013-02-07|isbn=978-0745614571}}</ref> Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], argued in his ''Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China'' (1847) that "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution [[meritocratic]].<ref name="Bodde"/> Influenced by the ancient Chinese [[imperial examination]], the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] of 1854 recommended that recruitment should be on the basis of merit determined through competitive examination, candidates should have a solid general education to enable inter-departmental transfers, and promotion should be through achievement rather than "preferment, patronage, or purchase".<ref>[http://www.civilservant.org.uk/northcotetrevelyan.pdf Full text of the Northcote-Trevelyan Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222072511/http://www.civilservant.org.uk/northcotetrevelyan.pdf |date=22 December 2014 }}</ref><ref name="Bodde">{{cite web|last=Bodde|first=Derke|title=China: A Teaching Workbook|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_ideas.htm|publisher=Columbia University}}</ref> This led to implementation of [[Her Majesty's Civil Service]] as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Walker|first=David|title=Fair game|work=The Guardian|date=2003-07-09|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jul/09/publicsector.guardiansocietysupplement|accessdate =2003-07-09|location=London, UK}}</ref>

In the British civil service, just as it was in China, entrance to the civil service was usually based on a general education in ancient classics, which similarly gave bureaucrats greater prestige. The Cambridge-Oxford ideal of the civil service was identical to the Confucian ideal of a general education in world affairs through humanism.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Joseph Richmond Levenson |title=Confucian China and Its Modern Fate, Volume 1 |date=1964 |publisher=University of California Press |pages=17–18 |edition=revised}}</ref> (Well into the 20th century, Classics, Literature, History and Language remained heavily favoured in British civil service examinations.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fry |first1=Geoffrey Kingdon |title=Statesmen in Disguise: The Changing Role of the Administrative Class of the British Home Civil Service 1853–1965 |date=1969 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK |isbn=978-1-349-00034-0 |pages=95–96}}</ref> In the period of 1925–1935, 67 percent of British civil service entrants consisted of such graduates.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finer |first1=Herman |title=The British Civil Service |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.458787 |year=1937 |publisher=The Fabian Society / George Allen & Unwin |page = [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.458787/page/n91 92] }}</ref>) Like the Chinese model's consideration of personal values, the British model also took personal physique and character into account.<ref name=rung/>

====France====
Like the British, the development of French bureaucracy was influenced by the Chinese system.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mark W. Huddleston |last2=William W.

The governments of China, Egypt, Peru and Empress [[Catherine II]] were regarded as models of Enlightened Despotism, admired by such figures as Diderot, D'Alembert and Voltaire.<ref name="Jacoby1973"/>

Napoleonic France adopted this meritocracy system <ref name="EE"/> and soon saw a rapid and dramatic expansion of government, accompanied by the rise of the French civil service and its complex systems of bureaucracy. This phenomenon became known as "bureaumania". In the early 19th century, [[Napoleon]] attempted to reform the bureaucracies of France and other territories under his control by the imposition of the standardized [[Napoleonic Code]]. But paradoxically, that led to even further growth of the bureaucracy.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iSkH1Qf6xsC&pg=PA142|title=Handbook of Administrative History - Paper - J.C.N.

French civil service examinations adopted in the late 19th century were also heavily based on general cultural studies. These features have been likened to the earlier Chinese model.<ref name=rung>{{cite book |last1=Rung |first1=Margaret C. |title=Servants of the State: Managing Diversity & Democracy in the Federal Workforce, 1933-1953 |date=2002 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=0820323624 |pages=8,200–201 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ucVgkbmqynUC}}</ref>

====Other industrialized nations====
By the mid-19th century, bureaucratic forms of administration were firmly in place across the industrialized world. Thinkers like [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Karl Marx]] began to theorize about the economic functions and power-structures of bureaucracy in contemporary life. [[Max Weber]] was the first to endorse bureaucracy as a necessary feature of modernity, and by the late 19th century bureaucratic forms had begun their spread from government to other large-scale institutions.<ref name="google1"/>

The trend toward increased bureaucratization continued in the 20th century, with the public sector employing over 5% of the workforce in many Western countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Within capitalist systems, informal bureaucratic structures began to appear in the form of [[corporate power]] hierarchies, as detailed in mid-century works like ''[[The Organization Man]]'' and ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]''. Meanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, a powerful class of bureaucratic administrators termed ''[[nomenklatura]]'' governed nearly all aspects of public life.<ref name="Voslensky">{{Cite book|author=Michael Voslensky|author-link=Michael Voslensky|year=1984|title=Nomenklatura: The Soviet Ruling Class|publisher=Doubleday|edition=1st|isbn=978-0-385-17657-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/nomenklaturasovi0000vosl_l7v8}}</ref>

The 1980s brought a backlash against perceptions of "big government" and the associated bureaucracy. Politicians like [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] gained power by promising to eliminate government regulatory bureaucracies, which they saw as overbearing, and return economic production to a more purely capitalistic mode, which they saw as more efficient.<ref name="ThatcherBBC">{{cite web|title=Viewpoints: How did Margaret Thatcher change Britain?|website=BBC News|date=13 April 2013|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-22076774}}</ref><ref name="Speech">{{cite speech|title=A Time For Choosing|author=Ronald Reagan|date=27 October 1964|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/timechoosing.html|website=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library}}</ref> In the business world, managers like [[Jack Welch]] gained fortune and renown by eliminating bureaucratic structures inside corporations.<ref name="Welch">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1996/44/b34991.htm |title=Jack Welch's Encore |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=14 June 1997 |accessdate=2010-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101031942/http://www.businessweek.com/1996/44/b34991.htm |archive-date=1 January 2010 }}</ref> Still, in the modern world, most organized institutions rely on bureaucratic systems to manage information, process records, and administer complex systems, although the decline of paperwork and the widespread use of electronic databases is transforming the way bureaucracies function.<ref name="Modernity">{{cite book|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199563654.do|title=Managing Modernity: Beyond Bureaucracy?|editor1=Stewart R.

==Theories==

===Karl Marx===
[[Karl Marx]] theorized about the role and function of bureaucracy in his ''[[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'', published in 1843. In ''[[Philosophy of Right]]'', [[Hegel]] had supported the role of specialized officials in [[public administration]], although he never used the term "bureaucracy" himself. By contrast, Marx was opposed to bureaucracy. Marx posited that while [[corporation|corporate]] and government bureaucracy seem to operate in opposition, in actuality they mutually rely on one another to exist. He wrote that "The Corporation is civil society's attempt to become state; but the bureaucracy is the state which has really made itself into civil society."<ref name="Marx1843"/>

===John Stuart Mill===
Writing in the early 1860s, political scientist [[John Stuart Mill]] theorized that successful monarchies were essentially bureaucracies, and found evidence of their existence in [[Imperial China]], the [[Russian Empire]], and the regimes of [[Europe]]. Mill referred to bureaucracy as a distinct form of government, separate from representative democracy. He believed bureaucracies had certain advantages, most importantly the accumulation of experience in those who actually conduct the affairs. Nevertheless, he believed this form of governance compared poorly to representative government, as it relied on appointment rather than direct election. Mill wrote that ultimately the bureaucracy stifles the mind, and that "a bureaucracy always tends to become a pedantocracy."<ref name="Mill"/>

===Max Weber===<!--'Weberian bureaucracy' redirects here-->

Chapter 6 Edited and Translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. Palgrave MacMillan 2015, pp. 73-128 {{ISBN|978-1137365866}}</ref>}}
The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] was the first to formally study bureaucracy and his works led to the popularization of this term.<ref name="BuSach"/> In his essay ''Bureaucracy'',[https://www.academia.edu/31803869/_Bureaucracy_by_Max_Weber_Translated_and_Edited_by_Tony_Waters_and_Dagmar_Waters],<ref>Weber, 2015, pp. 73–127 in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, New York: Palgrave MacMillan</ref> published in his magnum opus ''[[Economy and Society]]'', Weber described many [[ideal type|ideal-typical]] forms of [[public administration]], government, and business. His ideal-typical bureaucracy, whether public or private, is characterized by:
* hierarchical organization
* formal lines of authority ([[command hierarchy|chain of command]])
* a fixed area of activity
* rigid division of labor
* regular and continuous execution of assigned tasks
* all decisions and powers specified and restricted by regulations
* officials with expert training in their fields
* career advancement dependent on technical qualifications
* qualifications evaluated by organizational rules, not individuals<ref name="Bureaucratic"/><ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/><ref>Weber 2015, p. 76, in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations on Politics, Bureaucracy, and Social Stratification, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. New York: Palgrave Macmillan<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

Weber listed several preconditions for the [[emergence]] of bureaucracy, including an increase in the amount of space and population being administered, an increase in the complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out, and the existence of a [[monetary economy]] requiring a more efficient administrative system.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/> Development of [[information and communications technology|communication]] and [[transportation]] technologies make more efficient administration possible, and [[democratization]] and rationalization of culture results in demands for [[equal treatment]].<ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/>

Although he was not necessarily an admirer of bureaucracy, Weber saw bureaucratization as the most efficient and rational way of organizing human activity and therefore as the key to [[rational-legal authority]], indispensable to the modern world.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_c3Mcnh8hCgC&pg=PA19&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Max Weber (2015) extract], books.google.ca; accessed 30 August 2015.</ref> Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] of [[Western society]].<ref name="Bureaucratic"/><ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42"/> Weber also saw bureaucracy, however, as a threat to individual freedoms, and the ongoing bureaucratization as leading to a "polar night of icy darkness", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in a soulless "[[iron cage]]" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control.<ref name="Bureaucratic"/><ref name="GRitzer"/> Weber's critical study of the bureaucratization of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work.<ref name="Bureaucratic"/><ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42"/> Many aspects of modern public administration are based on his work, and a classic, hierarchically organized [[civil service]] of the Continental type is called "Weberian civil service" or "Weberian bureaucracy".<ref name="Hooghe2001"/> It is debated among social scientists whether Weberian bureaucracy contributes to economic growth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cornell|first1=Agnes|last2=Knutsen|first2=Carl Henrik|last3=Teorell|first3=Jan|date=2020|title=Bureaucracy and Growth|journal=Comparative Political Studies|language=en-US|volume=53|issue=14|pages=2246–2282|doi=10.1177/0010414020912262|issn=0010-4140|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Woodrow Wilson===
Writing as an academic while a professor at [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s essay ''[[The Study of Administration]]''<ref>Woodrow Wilson, "The Study of Administration", ''Political Science Quarterly'', July 1887</ref> argued for bureaucracy as a professional cadre, devoid of allegiance to fleeting politics. Wilson advocated a bureaucracy that "is a part of political life only as the methods of the counting house are a part of the life of society; only as machinery is part of the manufactured product. But it is, at the same time, raised very far above the dull level of mere technical detail by the fact that through its greater principles it is directly connected with the lasting maxims of political wisdom, the permanent truths of political progress."

Wilson did not advocate a replacement of rule by the governed, he simply advised that, "Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices". This essay became a foundation for the study of public administration in America.<ref>Christopher Hood (30 March 2000).

===Ludwig von Mises===
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}
In his 1944 work ''[[Bureaucracy (book)|Bureaucracy]]'', the Austrian economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] compared bureaucratic management to profit management. Profit management, he argued, is the most effective method of organization when the services rendered may be checked by economic calculation of profit and loss. When, however, the service in question can not be subjected to economic calculation, bureaucratic management is necessary. He did not oppose universally bureaucratic management; on the contrary, he argued that bureaucracy is an indispensable method for social organization, for it is the only method by which the law can be made supreme, and is the protector of the individual against despotic arbitrariness. Using the example of the Catholic Church, he pointed out that bureaucracy is only appropriate for an organization whose code of conduct is not subject to change. He then went on to argue that complaints about bureaucratization usually refer not to the criticism of the bureaucratic methods themselves, but to "the intrusion of bureaucracy into all spheres of human life." Mises saw bureaucratic processes at work in both the private and public spheres; however, he believed that bureaucratization in the private sphere could only occur as a consequence of government interference. According to him, "What must be realized is only that the strait jacket <!--[sic]--> of bureaucratic organization paralyzes the individual's initiative, while within the capitalist market society an innovator still has a chance to succeed. The former makes for stagnation and preservation of inveterate methods, the latter makes for progress and improvement."<ref name="Mises"/>

===Robert K. Merton===
American sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] expanded on Weber's theories of bureaucracy in his work ''Social Theory and Social Structure'', published in 1957. While Merton agreed with certain aspects of Weber's analysis, he also noted the dysfunctional aspects of bureaucracy, which he attributed to a "trained incapacity" resulting from "over conformity". He believed that bureaucrats are more likely to defend their own entrenched interests than to act to benefit the organization as a whole but that pride in their craft makes them resistant to changes in established routines. Merton stated that bureaucrats emphasize formality over interpersonal relationships, and have been trained to ignore the special circumstances of particular cases, causing them to come across as "arrogant" and "haughty".<ref name="Merton"/>

=== Elliott Jaques ===
In his book "A General Theory of Bureaucracy", first published in 1976, [[Elliott Jaques|Dr. Elliott Jaques]] describes the discovery of a universal and uniform underlying structure of managerial or work levels in the bureaucratic hierarchy for any type of employment systems.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constructing the infrastructure for the knowledge economy : methods and tools, theory and structure|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers|others=Linger, Henry|isbn=978-0306485541|location=New York|pages=104|oclc=55877281}}</ref>

[[Elliott Jaques]] argues and presents evidence that for the bureaucracy to provide a valuable contribution to the open society some of the following conditions must be met:
* Number of levels in a bureaucracy hierarchy must match the complexity level of the employment system for which the bureaucratic hierarchy is created (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 levels of complexity for bureaucratic hierarchies).
* Roles within a bureaucratic hierarchy differ in the level of work complexity.
* The level of work complexity in the roles must be matched with the level of human capability of the role holders (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 Levels of human capability).
* The level of work complexity in any managerial role within a bureaucratic hierarchy must be one level higher than the level of work complexity of the subordinate roles.
* Any managerial role in a bureaucratic hierarchy must have full managerial accountabilities and authorities (veto selection to the team, decide task types and specific task assignments, decide personal effectiveness and recognition, decide initiation of removal from the team within due process).
* Lateral working accountabilities and authorities must be defined for all the roles in the hierarchy (7 types of lateral working accountabilities and authorities: collateral, advisory, service-getting and -giving, coordinative, monitoring, auditing, prescribing).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A general theory of bureaucracy|last=Elliott.|first=Jaques|date=1976|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0435824785|location=London|oclc=2089721}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com/human_nature/free-associations/kirsnerjaques.html|title=Psychoanalysis Psychotherapy|website=www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1990/01/in-praise-of-hierarchy|title=In Praise of Hierarchy|date=1990-01-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>
The definition of effective bureaucratic hierarchy by [[Elliott Jaques]] is of importance not only to sociology but to social psychology, social anthropology, economics, politics, and social philosophy. They also have a practical application in business and administrative studies.
