'''Land degradation''' is a process in which the value of the [[biophysical environment]] is affected by a combination of [[Human impact on the environment|human-induced processes]] acting upon the land.<ref name="rural">{{cite book |title=Rural Land Degradation in Australia |last=Conacher |first=Arthur |author2=Conacher, Jeanette  |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press Australia |location=South Melbourne, Victoria |isbn=0-19-553436-0 |page=2 }}

According to the [[Special Report on Climate Change and Land]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]: "About a quarter of the Earth's ice-free land area is subject to human-induced degradation (medium confidence). Soil erosion from agricultural fields is estimated to be currently 10 to 20 times (no tillage) to more than 100 times (conventional tillage) higher than the soil formation rate (medium confidence).".<ref>{{cite book |title=Summary for Policymakers.

The United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goal 15]] has a target to restore degraded land and soil and achieve a land degradation-neutral world by 2030.<ref name="Goal 15 targets">{{Cite web|title=Goal 15 targets|url=https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-15-life-on-land/targets.html|access-date=2020-09-24|website=UNDP|language=en}}</ref>

==Measures==
There are four main ways of looking at land degradation and its impact on the environment around it:

#A temporary or permanent decline in the [[productive capacity]] of the land. This can be seen through a loss of [[biomass]], a loss of actual productivity or in potential productivity, or a loss or change in [[vegetative cover]] and [[soil nutrient]]s.
#Action in the land's capacity to provide resources for human livelihoods. This can be measured from a base line of past land use.
#Loss of [[biodiversity]]: A loss of range of species or ecosystem complexity as a decline in the environmental quality.
#Shifting ecological risk: increased vulnerability of the environment or people to destruction or crisis. This is measured through a base line in the form of pre-existing risk of crisis or destruction.

A problem with defining land degradation is that what one group of people might view as degradation, others might view as a benefit or opportunity. For example, planting [[crop]]s at a location with heavy [[rainfall]] and steep slopes would create scientific and environmental concern regarding the risk of [[Soil erosion#Rainfall and runoff|soil erosion by water]], yet farmers could view the location as a favourable one for high [[crop yield]]s.<ref name="landguide" />

== Different types ==
[[File:A potato field with soil erosion.jpg|thumb|Potato field with soil erosion]]
In addition to the usual types of land degradation that have been known for centuries (water, wind and mechanical [[erosion]], physical, chemical and [[biological degradation]]), four other types have emerged in the last 50 years:<ref>Brabant Pierre, 2010. [http://www.csf-desertification.eu/dossier/item/a-land-degradation-assessment-and-mapping-method A land degradation assessment and mapping method. A standard guideline proposal]. ''Les dossiers thématiques du CSFD. ''N°8. November 2010. CSFD/Agropolis International, Montpellier, France. 52 pp.</ref>
* [[pollution]], often chemical, due to [[industrial agriculture|agricultural]], industrial, [[mining]] or commercial activities;
* [[land loss|loss]] of arable land due to [[urbanization|urban construction]], [[road building]], [[land conversion]], [[agricultural expansion]], etc.;
* [[artificial radioactivity]], sometimes accidental;
* land-use constraints associated with [[armed conflict]]s.

Overall, more than 36 types of land degradation can be assessed. All are induced or aggravated by human activities, e.g. [[soil erosion]], [[soil contamination]], [[soil acidification]],  [[sheet erosion]], [[silting]], [[aridification]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], [[urbanization]], etc.

==Causes==
[[File:Cattle.jpg|thumb|Overgrazing by [[livestock]] can lead to land degradation]]
Land degradation is a global problem largely related to [[Agriculture|agricultural]] use, [[deforestation]] and [[Global warming|climate change]]. Causes include:

* Land clearance, such as [[clearcutting]] and [[Deforestation and climate change|deforestation]]
* Agricultural depletion of soil [[nutrient]]s through poor farming practices
* [[Livestock]] including [[overgrazing]] and [[overdrafting]]
* Inappropriate [[irrigation]]<ref>{{Citation | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review  | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18–34 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf }}</ref> and [[overdrafting]]
* [[Urban sprawl]] and commercial development
* Vehicle [[off-roading]]
*[[Quarry]]ing of stone, sand, ore and minerals
* Increase in field size due to [[economies of scale]], reducing shelter for wildlife, as [[hedgerow]]s and [[copse]]s disappear
* Exposure of naked soil after harvesting by heavy equipment
* [[Monoculture]], destabilizing the local ecosystem
* Dumping of non-[[biodegradable]] trash, such as [[plastics]]
* Invasive Species
* [[Climate change]]
* Loss of [[soil carbon]]

[[File:Erosion.jpg|thumb|160px|Soil erosion in a [[wheat]] field near [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], US]]
[[Overlogging|Overcutting]] of vegetation occurs when people cut forests, woodlands and shrublands—to obtain [[timber]], [[fuelwood]] and other products—at a pace [[ecological debt|exceeding the rate of natural regrowth]]. This is frequent in semi-arid environments, where [[fuelwood]] shortages are often severe. 
 
[[Overgrazing]] is the grazing of natural pastures at stocking intensities above the livestock [[carrying capacity]]; the resulting decrease in the vegetation cover is a leading cause of wind and water erosion. It is a significant factor in [[Afghanistan]]. The growing population pressure, during 1980–1990, has led to decreases in the already small areas of agricultural land per person in six out of eight countries (14% for India and 21% for Pakistan).

[[Population pressure]] also operates through other mechanisms. Improper agricultural practices, for instance, occur only under constraints such as the saturation of good lands under population pressure which leads settlers to cultivate too shallow or too steep soils, plough fallow land before it has recovered its fertility, or attempt to obtain multiple crops by irrigating unsuitable soils.

High [[population density]] is not always related to land degradation. Rather, it is the practices of the human population that can cause a landscape to become degraded. Populations can be a benefit to the land and make it more productive than it is in its natural state. Land degradation is an important factor of internal displacement in many African and Asian countries.<ref>Terminski, Bogumil, Towards Recognition and Protection of Forced Environmental Migrants in the Public International Law: Refugee or IDPs Umbrella (December 1, 2011). Policy Studies Organization (PSO) Summit, December 2011</ref>

Severe land degradation affects a significant portion of the Earth's arable lands, decreasing the wealth and [[economic development]] of nations. As the land resource base becomes less productive, [[food security]] is compromised and competition for dwindling [[resource]]s increases, the seeds of [[famine]] and potential conflict are sown.

===Climate change and land degradation===
According to the [[Special Report on Climate Change and Land]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] climate change in one of the causes of land degradation. The report state that: "Climate change exacerbates land degradation, particularly in lowlying coastal areas, river deltas, drylands and in permafrost areas (high confidence). Over the period 1961–2013, the annual area of drylands in drought has increased, on average by slightly more than 1% per year, with large inter-annual variability. In 2015, about 500 (380–620) million people lived within areas which experienced [[desertification]] between the year 1980s and 2000s. The highest numbers of people affected are in South and East Asia, the circum Sahara region including North Africa, and the Middle East including the Arabian Peninsula (low confidence). Other dryland regions have also experienced desertification. People living in already degraded or desertified areas are increasingly negatively affected by climate change (high confidence)."<ref>{{cite book |title=Summary for Policymakers. In: Climate Change and Land: an IPCC special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems |date=2019 |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |page=5 |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2019/12/02_Summary-for-Policymakers_SPM.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2020}}</ref> Additionally, it is claimed that 74% of the poor are directly affected by land degradation globally.<ref name="Goal 15 targets"/>

Significant land degradation from [[seawater]] [[inundation]], particularly in [[river delta]]s and on low-lying islands, is a potential hazard that was identified in a 2007 [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/mains3-3-2.html report]<!-- Link needs updating. -->.{{IPCC|date=September 2008}} As a result of [[sea-level rise]] from climate change, salinity levels can reach levels where agriculture becomes impossible in very low-lying areas.

==Sensitivity and resilience==
Sensitivity and [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] are measures of the vulnerability of a landscape to degradation. These two factors combine to explain the degree of vulnerability.<ref name="landguide">{{Citation | author1 = Stockings, Mike | author2 = Murnaghan, Niamh. | title = Land Degradation - Guidelines for Field Assessment | year = 2000 | location = Norwich, UK | pages = 7–15 | url = http://146.83.42.209/manuel_casanova/Conserva2011/Stocking_COMPLETE.pdf }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Sensitivity is the degree to which a land system undergoes change due to natural forces, human intervention or a combination of both. Resilience is the ability of a landscape to absorb change, without significantly altering the relationship between the relative importance and numbers of individuals and species that compose the community.<ref>{{Citation |author1=Johnson, Douglas |author2=Lewis, Lawrence. | title = Land Degradation; Creation and Destruction | year = 2007 | location = Maryland, US}}</ref> It also refers to the ability of the region to return to its original state after being changed in some way. The resilience of a landscape can be increased or decreased through human interaction based upon different methods of land-use management. Land that is degraded becomes less resilient than undegraded land, which can lead to even further degradation through shocks to the landscape.
