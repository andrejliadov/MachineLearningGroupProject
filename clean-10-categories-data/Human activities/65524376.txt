The '''Global Travel Taskforce''' is an advisory body of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]]. Secretary of State for Transport, [[Grant Shapps]] announced the formation of the group on 7 October 2020 as a cross-government response to an identified need to enable the safe and sustainable recovery of international travel and to introduce a COVID-19 testing system for travellers visiting the UK.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=7 October 2020 |title=Covid: Taskforce to look at virus testing for UK arrivals |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54452397 |via=www.bbc.co.uk |access-date=2020-10-07}}</ref> In a Written Statement to Parliament of 7 October 2020, the Transport Secretary pledged to formally report to the Prime Minister by early November 2020 with the taskforce's recommendations as to how the country can help global travel resume safe operation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-global-travel-taskforce |title=Global Travel Taskforce to consider steps to enable the safe and sustainable recovery of international travel. |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=7 October 2020 |website=gov.uk |publisher=Written statement to Parliament  |access-date=2020-10-07 }}</ref> The Government intends that the work of the taskforce will be performed in collaboration with the transport and tourism industries along with the private sector, specifically in relation to COVID-19 testing.<ref>{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= |title=Covid-19: International Travel |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-10-07/debates/20100744000002/Covid-19InternationalTravel |house=Commons |volume=681 |date=7 October 2020 |column_start=30WS |column_end=32WS |speaker=Grant Shapps |position=The Secretary of State for Transport}}</ref>

Any ongoing work in relation to [[Travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic|travel corridors]] and related policies is not expected to come under the auspices of the taskforce.

==Membership==
The taskforce will be jointly chaired by [[Grant Shapps]] and [[Matt Hancock]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Brewis |first=Harriet |date=7 October 2020 |title=Hope for UK travel quarantine reduction as testing task force launched |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/global-travel-taskforce-launched-testing-quarantine-a4565826.html |work=Evening Standard |location=London |access-date=2020-10-07}}</ref> The group will work with the following government departments and bodies: [[Department for Transport]], [[Department for Health and Social Care]], [[NHS Test and Trace]], [[Public Health England]], [[Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office]]; [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]]; [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]]; [[Ministry of Housing]], [[Communities and Local Government]]; [[HM Treasury]]; [[The Home Office]]; [[Department for International Trade]]; and the No 10 / [[Cabinet Office]] C–19 Taskforce.

Officials from the nations of the [[Home nations|constituent countries]] of the United Kingdom will also be involved with the work of the taskforce despite the fundamental theme of health being a devolved issue.<ref>{{cite news |last=Frainier |first=Lizzie |date=8 October 2020 |title=What is the Global Travel Taskforce, and what does it mean for your holiday? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/advice/global-travel-taskforce-your-holiday/ |work=The Telegraph |location=London |access-date=2020-10-09 |quote=''The taskforce will seek to achieve a four nations approach, while noting that health matters are devolved, so decision-making and implementation may differ across the nations.''}}</ref>

==Developments==
On 11 October 2020, it emerged that the taskforce was exploring ways in which the required period to [[The_Health_Protection_(Coronavirus,_International_Travel)_(England)_Regulations_2020#Requirement_to_self-isolate|self-isolate]] in the UK could be reduced for people arriving from overseas using COVID-19 testing provided by the private sector which would be paid for by the person travelling.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hughes |first=David |date=11 October 2020 |title=Will quarantine rules change? How new UK travel testing plan could replace 14-day restrictions |url=https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/travel/quarantine-rules-change-will-uk-travel-testing-plan-14-day-self-isolation-restrictions-task-force-687466 |via=inews.co.uk |location=London |access-date=2020-10-25}}</ref>

On 14 October, Grant Shapps announced proposals for a testing scheme involving a single COVID-19 test to be performed 7 days after arrival in the UK from a high-risk country.
The new testing regime would not negate the need to undergo quarantine for one week after arrival in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news |last=Paton |first=Graeme|last2= Clatworth|first2=Ben |date=14 October 2020 |title=Coronavirus testing plan for airports only cuts quarantine period by week |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-testing-plan-for-airports-only-cuts-quarantine-period-by-week-v8rjq657w |work=The Times |location=London |access-date=2020-10-14}}</ref> The move would be in keeping with the government's preference for a hybrid solution of lessening the duration required in quarantine with the upscaling of a testing regime within the private sector.<ref>{{cite news |last=Frainier |first=Lizzie |date=8 October 2020 |title=What is the Global Travel Taskforce, and what does it mean for your holiday? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/advice/global-travel-taskforce-your-holiday/ |work=The Telegraph |location=London |access-date=2020-10-14 |quote=''Most likely, a combination of a reduced quarantine time and a private sector test.''}}</ref>

On 16 October, the BBC reported that those returning from travel would have to fund their own private COVID-19 tests in order to prevent NHS capacity from being adversely affected.<ref>{{cite news |date=16 October 2020 |title=Coronavirus: What are the UK travel quarantine rules?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52544307 |via=www.bbc.co.uk |location=London |access-date=2020-10-17}}</ref>

According to Ian Taylor writing in [[Travel Weekly (UK)|Travel Weekly]] on 21 October 2020, the taskforce met for the first time with leaders from the [[Tourism|travel industry]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Ben |date=21 October 2020 |title=Hopes for cheaper faster tests to shorten quarantine |url=https://www.travelweekly.co.uk/articles/389861/hopes-for-cheaper-faster-tests-to-shorten-quarantine |work=Travel Weekly (UK) |access-date=2020-10-25}}</ref>

Charles Hymas writing in ''The Telegraph'' on 27 October reported that arrangements for testing prior to departure which would significantly lessen isolation times had already been agreed between airports and airlines but that government authorization following consideration by the government's taskforce was yet to be forthcoming.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hymas |first=Charles |date=27 October 2020 |title=Winter sun hopes boosted as airport boss says London-Dubai travel corridor is ready |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/27/winter-sun-hopes-boosted-airport-boss-says-london-dubai-travel/ |work=The Telegraph  |location=London |access-date=2020-11-01}}</ref>

On 29 October, it was confirmed that the taskforce would give consideration to the safe return of the UK cruise industry within the context of operations already having been resumed in certain areas of Europe. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Aviation and Maritime, [[Robert Courts]], said that "different circumstances" applied to the respective countries which had given the go-ahead but that he was "acutely aware" of the significant impact on the cruise sector.<ref>{{cite news |last=Holland |first=Kaye |date=29 October 2020 |title=UK cruise restart on the cards as Government task force examines industry |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/news/government-travel-taskforce-consider-cruise-restart/ |work=The Telegraph  |location=London |access-date=2020-10-30}}</ref>

===Pre-departure COVID testing===
On 17 November, as part of a trial of COVID testing prior to departure, United Airlines Flight 14 landed at London Heathrow where everyone on board had been mandatorily tested for coronavirus using a [[NAAT]] prior to departure at Newark Airport, New York. The flight was part of a pre-departure testing trial involving 12 transatlantic flights scheduled between November and December 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last=Calder |first=Simon |date=17 November 2020 |title=First transatlantic flight with mandatory Covid tests lands at London Heathrow |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/flight-new-york-london-heathrow-united-airlines-covid-test-b1723907.html |work=The Independent |access-date=2020-11-17}}</ref> A further trial will commence on 25 November involving two British Airways flights (BA268 and BA114) and an American Airlines flight (AA50) from the United States, where passengers will be invited on a voluntary basis to be tested for coronavirus, free of charge, at three days prior to departure and at subsequent points.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=British Airways to launch Covid testing trial for arrivals |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54971144 |via=www.bbc.co.uk |date=17 November 2020 |access-date=2020-11-17}}</ref> 

The taskforce is reported to be considering how the duration of quarantine can be reduced, however, those travelling as part of the pre-departure testing trials will still be required to self-isolate for the required period of 14 days, even though they had tested negative for COVID-19 before boarding their flight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/uk/british-airways-bring-in-coronavirus-testing-to-get-travel-quarantine-scrapped/|title=British Airways bring in coronavirus testing to get travel quarantine scrapped|website=lbc.co.uk|access-date=17 November 2020}}</ref>

==Criticism==
On Friday, 9 October 2020, just two days after the Global Travel Taskforce was [[Inauguration|inaugurated]], an article in [[The Times]] referred to the new body as ″a navel-gazing talking shop″. The article title presented a critical view of the timing of the introduction of the taskforce making it clear that it had arrived too late.<ref>{{cite news |last=Osbourne |first=Alistair |date=9 October 2020 |title=Air travel taskforce arriving too late |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/air-travel-taskforce-arriving-too-late-jz3tgvpn3 |work=The Times |access-date=2020-10-09}}</ref> The [[Daily telegraph|Telegraph]] also carried an article on 9 October 2020 which levelled criticism at the new taskforce, especially noting the frustration of the beleaguered travel industry.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dickinson |first=Greg |date=9 October 2020 |title=″Frankly laughable″&nbsp;–&nbsp;Government′s Travel Taskforce comes under fire |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/travel-task-force-industry-reaction/ |work=The Telegraph |access-date=2020-10-09}}</ref> 

On 14 October, [[Simon Calder]], Travel Correspondent for [[the Independent]] pointed out that the Global Travel Taskforce—the government's answer to demands for airport testing—arrived six months too late.<ref>{{cite news |last=Calder |first=Simon |date=14 October 2020 |title=Grant Shapps refuses demands for coronavirus airport testing on arrival |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/coronavirus-airport-test-quarantine-grant-shapps-covid-b1034209.html |work=The Independent |access-date=2020-10-16 |quote=''Six months after calls for airport testing began, the government has set up a Global Travel Taskforce that will report in November.''}}</ref> The same day, the Guardian presented a critical view from within the travel industry, when chief executive of [[ABTA – The Travel Association|ABTA]], Mark Tanzer, claimed that the Transport Secretary had not "bat for his sector" and disputed Shapps' claim that the groundwork already done by government could be augmented by the new Global Travel Taskforce.<ref>{{cite news |last=Topham |first=Gwyn |date=14 October 2020 |title=Quarantine for arrivals to UK may be cut to a week, says Shapps |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/oct/14/grant-shapps-criticised-by-abta-for-failing-to-bat-for-travel-industry |work=The Guardian |access-date=2020-10-17}}</ref>

Giles Hawke, chief executive of Cosmos Tours, writing in the [[Telegraph]] on 16 October 2020, made the statement that from the inception of the taskforce on 7 October, he had been unable to identify anyone in the travel industry of an appropriately high position who could confirm that they had been asked to become involved with the taskforce. Hawke added, "anyone in travel could have told Mr Shapps his solution won't work" and that the taskforce "looks set to deliver an unworkable solution".<ref>{{cite news |last=Hawke |first=Giles |date=16 October 2020 |title=The Government doesn't understand travel&nbsp;–&nbsp;why aren't they asking experts to help?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/comment/government-save-travel-task-force-plan-no-industry-experts/ |work=The Telegraph |location=London |access-date=2020-10-17}}</ref>

== Report of the taskforce ==
On 24 November 2020, the taskforce published a report in which 14 recommendations were made.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/global-travel-taskforce-recommendations|title=Global Travel Taskforce recommendations|date=24 November 2020|website=gov.uk|publisher=Department for Transport|access-date=2020-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite report |authors=Global Travel Taskforce |date=24 November 2020 |title=Report of the Global Travel Taskforce |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/938377/report-of-the-global-travel-taskforce.pdf |publisher=Department for Transport |page=5 |access-date=2020-11-25 |quote=''This report makes 14 recommendations to ensure clear public health measures, increase demand safely and take the lead on global standards...''}}</ref> The recommendations fall within three fundamental precepts:<ref>{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= |title=Covid-19: Global Travel Taskforce  |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2020-11-24/debates/20112432000010/Covid-19GlobalTravelTaskforce |house=Commons |date=24 November 2020 |column_start=24WS |column_end=26WS |volume= 684|speaker=Robert Courts |position=The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport}}</ref> {{bulleted list| That journeys will be conducted safely|That safety will be ensured as the need for travel intensifies |That the UK should be foremost in the recovery of global travel, underpinned by the advancement of international standards.}}

The report discussed the stasis of the beleaguered cruise sector and a recommendation was made for the publication of "epidemiological criteria" in relation to the UK before the sector could be restored to safe operation through a "phased restart".<ref>{{cite news |last=Parker  |first=Benjamin |date=25 November 2020 |title=Cruise holidays can have 'phased restart'&nbsp;–&nbsp;but not while Covid alert is high, says Government |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/cruise-holidays-can-have-phased-restart-not-covid-alert-low/ |work=The Telegraph |access-date=2020-11-25|quote=''Recommendations published in the report from the Global Travel Taskforce, a group chaired by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, are that authorities should publish the "epidemiological criteria" for when ships can welcome back passengers, with the return of cruise allowed “when it is safe to do so”.''}}</ref>

One the same day as the taskforce's publication, ''The Times'' reported that a plan outlined as part of the recommendations could see exemptions to the two-week quarantine requirements for those forming part of a tour group or those travelling for business, but that business travellers would be prohibited from mixing with other people in any capacity not directly related to their business trip.<ref>{{cite news |last=Paton |first=Graeme |date=25 November 2020 |title=Covid quarantine to be lifted for business and tour groups |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-business-travellers-and-tour-groups-set-for-quarantine-exemption-j0gwlv70h?wgu=270525_54264_16063338814151_1f0e35aad6&wgexpiry=1614109881&utm_source=planit&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_content=22278 |work=The Times |location=London |access-date=2020-11-25|quote=''...although business travellers would be banned from "socialising or any other non-business-related activity".''}}</ref>
