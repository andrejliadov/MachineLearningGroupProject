'''Citizenship''' is the [[Status (law)|status]] of a person recognized under the [[custom (law)|custom]] or [[law]] of a [[sovereign state]] or local jurisdiction as a member of or belonging to the state. Each state is free to determine the conditions under which it will recognize persons as its citizens, and the conditions under which that status will be withdrawn. Recognition by a state as a citizen generally carries with it recognition of [[civil and political rights|civil, political]], and [[social rights]] which are not afforded to non-citizens.

In general, the basic rights normally regarded as arising from citizenship are the right to a passport, the right to leave and return to the country/ies of citizenship, the right to live in that country and to work there. 

Some countries permit their citizens to have [[multiple citizenship]]s, while others insist on exclusive allegiance. A person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be [[Stateless person|stateless]], while one who lives on state borders whose territorial status is uncertain is a border-lander.<ref>Coplan, David. "Introduction: From empiricism to theory in African border studies." Journal of Borderlands Studies 25.2 (2010): 1-5.</ref>

[[Nationality]] is often used as a [[synonym]] for citizenship in English<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/slovaknationalityethnicityenglishtranslation.html | title = Nationality, ethnicity in Slovakia. | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}</ref> although the term is mainly – notably in [[public international law|international law]] – understood as denoting a person's membership of a [[nation]] (a large [[Ethnicity|ethnic group]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=Nationality and Statelessness in International Law |first1=Paul |last1=Weis |isbn=9789028603295 |year=1979 |publisher=Sijthoff & Noordhoff |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hSLGDXqXeegC&pg=PA3 3]}}</ref> In some countries, e.g. the [[Citizenship of the United States#Distinction between citizenship and nationality|United States]], [[British nationality law#Classes of British nationality|the United Kingdom]], nationality and citizenship can have different meanings.

{{further|Nationality law}}
A person can be recognized or granted citizenship on a number of bases. Usually citizenship based on circumstances of birth is automatic, but an application may be required.

*Citizenship by birth (''[[jus sanguinis]]''). If one or both of a person's parents are citizens of a given state, then the person may have the right to be a citizen of that state as well.{{efn|Examples: [[Philippine nationality law#Citizenship by birth|Philippines]],<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/article4.htm Article IV of the Philippine Constitution].</ref> [[Title 8 of the United States Code|United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III/part-I|title=8 U.S. Code Part I - Nationality at Birth and Collective Naturalization|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>}} Formerly this might only have applied through the paternal line, but [[sex equality]] became common since the late twentieth century. Citizenship is granted based on ancestry or [[ethnicity]] and is related to the concept of a [[nation state]] common in [[Europe]]. Where ''jus sanguinis'' holds, a person born outside a country, one or both of whose parents are citizens of the country, is also a citizen. Some states ([[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]]) limit the right to citizenship by descent to a certain number of generations born outside the state; others ([[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) grant citizenship only if each new generation is registered with the relevant foreign mission within a specified deadline; while others ([[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]]) have no limitation on the number of generations born abroad who can claim citizenship of their ancestors' country. This form of citizenship is common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries.
* Born within a country (''[[jus soli]]''). Some people are automatically citizens of the state in which they are born. This form of citizenship originated in [[England]], where those who were born within the realm were [[British subject#Prior to 1949|subjects of the monarch]] (a concept pre-dating citizenship) and is common in [[common law]] countries. Most countries in [[Americas|the Americas]] grant unconditional ''jus soli'' citizenship, while it has been limited or abolished in almost all other countries.
** In many cases, both ''jus soli'' and ''jus sanguinis'' hold citizenship either by place or parentage (or both).
* Citizenship by marriage (''[[jus matrimonii]]''). Many countries fast-track naturalization based on the marriage of a person to a citizen. Countries which are destinations for such immigration often have regulations to try to detect [[sham marriage]]s, where a citizen marries a non-citizen typically for payment, without them having the intention of living together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bishops-act-to-tackle-sham-marriages|title=Bishops act to tackle sham marriages|website=GOV.UK}}</ref> Many countries ([[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[United States]], [[Canada]]) allow citizenship by marriage only if the foreign spouse is a permanent resident of the country in which citizenship is sought; others ([[Switzerland]], [[Luxembourg]]) allow foreign spouses of expatriate citizens to obtain citizenship after a certain period of marriage, and sometimes also subject to language skills and proof of cultural integration (e.g. regular visits to the spouse's country of citizenship).
* [[Naturalization]]. States normally grant citizenship to people who have entered the country legally and been granted permit to stay, or been granted [[political asylum]], and also lived there for a specified period. In some countries, naturalization is subject to conditions which may include passing a test demonstrating reasonable knowledge of the language or way of life of the host country, good conduct (no serious criminal record) and moral character (such as drunkenness, or gambling), vowing allegiance to their new state or its ruler and renouncing their prior citizenship. Some states allow [[dual citizenship]] and do not require naturalized citizens to formally renounce any other citizenship.
* Citizenship by investment or [[Economic Citizenship]]. Wealthy people invest money in property or businesses, buy government bonds or simply donate cash directly, in exchange for citizenship and a passport. 
Whilst legitimate and usually limited in quota, the schemes are controversial. Costs for citizenship by investment range from as little as $100,000 (£74,900) to as much as €2.5m (£2.19m)<ref>{{cite web |title=Citizenship for sale: how tycoons can go shopping for a new passport |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/citizenship-by-investment-passport-super-rich-nationality |website=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=24 August 2018}}</ref>
* Excluded categories. In the past there have been exclusions on entitlement to citizenship on grounds such as skin color, ethnicity, sex, and free status (not being a [[slave]]). Most of these exclusions no longer apply in most places. Modern examples include some [[Arab countries]] which rarely grant citizenship to non-Muslims, e.g. [[Qatar]] is known for granting citizenship to foreign athletes, but they all have to profess the [[Islamic]] faith in order to receive citizenship. The United States grants citizenship to those born as a result of reproductive technologies, and internationally adopted children born after February 27, 1983. Some exclusions still persist for internationally adopted children born before February 27, 1983 even though their parents meet citizenship criteria.

==History==
{{Main|History of citizenship}}

===Polis===
{{Main|Polis}}
Many thinkers point to the concept of citizenship beginning in the early [[city-state]]s of [[ancient Greece]], although others see it as primarily a modern phenomenon dating back only a few hundred years and, for humanity, that the concept of citizenship arose with the first [[law]]s. ''Polis'' meant both the political assembly of the city-state as well as the entire society.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=32}} Citizenship concept has generally been identified as a western phenomenon.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=4}} There is a general view that citizenship in ancient times was a simpler relation than modern forms of citizenship, although this view has come under scrutiny.<ref name="tws2Y17"/> The relation of citizenship has not been a fixed or static relation, but constantly changed within each society, and that according to one view, citizenship might "really have worked" only at select periods during certain times, such as when the Athenian politician [[Solon]] made reforms in the early Athenian state.<ref name=tws2Y12>{{harvnb|Heater|2004|p={{pageno|date=July 2020}}}}</ref>

Historian [[Geoffrey Hosking]] in his 2005 ''Modern Scholar'' lecture course suggested that citizenship in [[ancient Greece]] arose from an appreciation for the importance of [[Political freedom|freedom]].<ref name=twsfjiui>{{Cite book

{{Quote|It can be argued that this growth of slavery was what made Greeks particularly conscious of the value of freedom. After all, any Greek farmer might fall into debt and therefore might become a slave, at almost any time ... When the Greeks fought together, they fought in order to avoid being enslaved by warfare, to avoid being defeated by those who might take them into slavery. And they also arranged their political institutions so as to remain free men.|Geoffrey Hosking, 2005<ref name=twsfjiui/>}}

[[File:Arte greca, pietra tombale di donna con la sua assistente, 100 ac. circa.JPG|thumb|right|Geoffrey Hosking suggests that fear of being enslaved was a central motivating force for the development of the Greek sense of citizenship. Sculpture: a Greek woman being served by a slave-child.]]
Slavery permitted slave-owners to have substantial free time, and enabled participation in public life.<ref name=twsfjiui/> Polis citizenship was marked by exclusivity. Inequality of status was widespread; citizens (πολίτης ''politēs'' < πόλις 'city') had a higher status than non-citizens, such as women, slaves, and resident foreigners ([[metic]]s).<ref name=tws2Y16/>{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=33}} The first form of citizenship was based on the way people lived in the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] times, in small-scale organic communities of the polis. Citizenship was not seen as a separate activity from the private life of the individual person, in the sense that there was not a distinction between [[public sphere|public]] and [[Private sphere|private]] life. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected into one's everyday life in the polis. These small-scale organic communities were generally seen as a new development in world history, in contrast to the established ancient civilizations of [[Egypt]] or Persia, or the hunter-gatherer bands 
elsewhere. From the viewpoint of the ancient Greeks, a person's public life was not separated from their private life, and Greeks did not distinguish between the two worlds according to the modern western conception. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected with everyday life. To be truly human, one had to be an active citizen to the community, which [[Aristotle]] famously expressed: "To take no part in the running of the community's affairs is to be either a beast or a god!" This form of citizenship was based on obligations of citizens towards the community, rather than rights given to the citizens of the community. This was not a problem because they all had a strong affinity with the polis; their own destiny and the destiny of the community were strongly linked. Also, citizens of the polis saw obligations to the community as an opportunity to be virtuous, it was a source of honour and respect. In Athens, citizens were both ruler and ruled, important political and judicial offices were rotated and all citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly.

===Roman ideas===
In the [[Roman Empire]], citizenship expanded from small-scale communities to the entirety of the empire. Romans realized that granting citizenship to people from all over the empire legitimized Roman rule over conquered areas. Roman citizenship was no longer a status of political agency, as it had been reduced to a judicial safeguard and the expression of rule and law.<ref>See [[Civis romanus sum]].</ref> Rome carried forth Greek ideas of citizenship such as the principles of [[equality under the law]], civic participation in government, and notions that "no one citizen should have too much power for too long",<ref name=twsffujfk>{{Cite book

  | isbn =978-1-4025-8360-5}}</ref> but Rome offered relatively generous terms to its captives, including chances for lesser forms of citizenship.<ref name=twsffujfk/> If Greek citizenship was an "emancipation from the world of things",{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=35}} the Roman sense increasingly reflected the fact that citizens could act upon material things as well as other citizens, in the sense of buying or selling property, possessions, titles, goods. One historian explained:

{{Quote|The person was defined and represented through his actions upon things; in the course of time, the term property came to mean, first, the defining characteristic of a human or other being; second, the relation which a person had with a thing; and third, the thing defined as the possession of some person.|[[J. G. A. Pocock]], 1998{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=36}}}}

Roman citizenship reflected a struggle between the upper-class [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] interests against the lower-order working groups known as the [[plebs|plebeian]] class.<ref name=twsffujfk/> A citizen came to be understood as a person "free to act by law, free to ask and expect the law's protection, a citizen of such and such a legal community, of such and such a legal standing in that community".{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} Citizenship meant having rights to have possessions, immunities, expectations, which were "available in many kinds and degrees, available or unavailable to many kinds of person for many kinds of reason".{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} The law itself was a kind of bond uniting people.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}} Roman citizenship was more impersonal, universal, multiform, having different degrees and applications.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}}

===Middle Ages===
During the European [[Middle Ages]], citizenship was usually associated with cities and towns (see [[medieval commune]]), and applied mainly to middle class folk. Titles such as [[Burgher (title)|burgher]], [[grand burgher]] (German ''Großbürger'') and [[bourgeoisie]] denoted political affiliation and identity in relation to a particular locality, as well as membership in a mercantile or trading class; thus, individuals of respectable means and socioeconomic status were interchangeable with citizens.

During this era, members of the [[nobility]] had a range of [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s above [[commoner]]s (see [[aristocracy]]), though political upheavals and reforms, beginning most prominently with the [[French Revolution]], abolished privileges and created an egalitarian concept of citizenship.

===Renaissance===
 <!-- linked from redirect [[Subject (monarchy)]] -->
{{anchor|Subject}}
During the [[Renaissance]], people transitioned from being subjects of a king or queen to being citizens of a city and later to a nation.<ref name=tws2Y14/>{{rp|p.161}} Each city had its own law, courts, and independent administration.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} And being a citizen often meant being subject to the city's law in addition to having power in some instances to help choose officials.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} City dwellers who had fought alongside nobles in battles to defend their cities were no longer content with having a subordinate social status, but demanded a greater role in the form of citizenship.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=46}} Membership in [[guild]]s was an indirect form of citizenship in that it helped their members succeed financially.{{sfn|Weber|1998|pp=46-47}} The rise of citizenship was linked to the rise of [[republicanism]], according to one account, since independent citizens meant that kings had less power.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=3}} Citizenship became an idealized, almost abstract, concept,<ref name=tws2Y12/> and did not signify a submissive relation with a lord or count, but rather indicated the bond between a person and the state in the rather abstract sense of having [[rights]] and duties.<ref name=tws2Y12/>

===Modern times===
The modern idea of citizenship still respects the idea of political participation, but it is usually done through "elaborate systems of political representation at a distance" such as [[representative democracy]].<ref name=tws2Y17/> Modern citizenship is much more passive; action is delegated to others; citizenship is often a constraint on acting, not an impetus to act.<ref name=tws2Y17/> Nevertheless, citizens are usually aware of their obligations to authorities, and are aware that these bonds often limit what they can do.<ref name=tws2Y17/>

====United States of America====

[[File:DredScott.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Dred Scott, plaintiff in the infamous ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' case at the Supreme Court of the United States, commissioned by a "group of Negro citizens" and presented to the Missouri Historical Society, St. Louis, in 1888]]
From 1790 until the mid-twentieth century, [[Law of the United States|United States law]] used racial criteria to establish citizenship rights and regulate who was eligible to become a naturalized citizen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/04/news/mn-9708|title=A History of U.S. Citizenship|date=July 4, 1997|website=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=21 September 2016}}</ref> [[Naturalization Act of 1790|The Naturalization Act of 1790]], the first law in U.S. history to establish rules for citizenship and naturalization, barred citizenship to all people who were not of European descent, stating that "any alien being a free white person, who shall have resided within the limits and under the jurisdiction of the [[United States]] for the term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen thereof."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=001/llsl001.db&recNum=226|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875|publisher=The Library of Congress|access-date=21 September 2016}}</ref>

Under early U.S. laws, African Americans were not eligible for citizenship. In 1857, these laws were upheld in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] case ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'', which ruled that "a free negro of the African race, whose ancestors were brought to this country and sold as slaves, is not a 'citizen' within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States," and that "the special rights and immunities guarantied to citizens do not apply to them."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/60/393#writing-USSC_CR_0060_0393_ZO|title=Scott v. Sandford|date=1857|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell University Law School|access-date=21 September 2016}}</ref>

It was not until the abolition of slavery following the [[American Civil War]] that African Americans were granted citizenship rights. [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], ratified on July 9, 1868, stated that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html|title=Constitution of the United States: Amendment XIV|date=1868|website=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration|access-date=21 September 2016}}</ref> Two years later, the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]] would extend the right to become a naturalized citizen to include "aliens of African nativity and to persons of African descent".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Naturalization_Act_of_1870|title=Naturalization Act of 1870|website=Wikisource|publisher=U.S. Congress}}</ref>

Despite the gains made by African Americans after the Civil War, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Asian Americans|Asians]], and others not considered "free white persons" were still denied the ability to become citizens. The 1882 [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] explicitly denied naturalization rights to all people of Chinese origin, while subsequent acts passed by the US Congress, such as laws in [[Naturalization Act of 1906|1906]], [[Immigration Act of 1917|1917]], and [[Immigration Act of 1924|1924]], would include clauses that denied immigration and naturalization rights to people based on broadly defined racial categories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://library.uwb.edu/static/USimmigration/1917_immigration_act.html|title=1917 Immigration Act|website=US Immigration Legislation Online|publisher=University of Washington-Bothell Library}}</ref> Supreme Court cases such as ''[[Ozawa v. United States]]'' (1922) and ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind|U.S. v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'' (1923), would later clarify the meaning of the phrase "free white persons," ruling that ethnically Japanese, Indian, and other non-European people were not "white persons", and were therefore ineligible for naturalization under U.S. law.

Native Americans were not granted full US citizenship until the passage of the [[Indian Citizenship Act]] in 1924. However, even well into the 1960s some state laws prevented Native Americans from exercising their full rights as citizens, such as the right to vote. In 1962, [[New Mexico]] became the last state to enfranchise Native Americans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/elections/voters9.html|title=Elections: Native Americans|website=Library of Congress}}</ref>

It was not until the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] that the racial and gender restrictions for naturalization were explicitly abolished. However, the act still contained restrictions regarding who was eligible for US citizenship, and retained a national quota system which limited the number of visas given to immigrants based on their national origin, to be fixed "at a rate of one-sixth of one percent of each nationality's population in the United States in 1920".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/immigration-act|title=The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (The McCarran-Walter Act)|website=The Office of the Historian|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}</ref> It was not until the passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] that these immigration quota systems were drastically altered in favor of a less discriminatory system.

====Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics====
{{Main|Soviet nationality law}}
The [[Soviet Russia Constitution of 1918|1918 constitution of revolutionary Russia]] granted citizenship to any foreigners who were living within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], so long as they were "engaged in work and [belonged] to the working class."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/constitution/1918/article2.htm|title=1918 Constitution of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic.

====Nazi Germany====

[[Nazism]], the German variant of twentieth century fascism, classified inhabitants of the country into three main hierarchical categories, each of which would have different rights in relation to the state: citizens, subjects, and aliens. The first category, citizens, were to possess full civic rights and responsibilities. Citizenship was conferred only on males of [[Germans|German]] (or so-called "[[Aryan]]") heritage who had completed military service, and could be revoked at any time by the state. The [[Reich Citizenship Law]] of 1935 established [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial criteria for citizenship in the German Reich]], and because of this law Jews and others who could not "prove German racial heritage" were stripped of their citizenship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/nurmlaw3.html|title=The Nuremberg Laws: The Reich Citizenship Law (September 15, 1935)|website=Jewish Virtual Library}}</ref>

The second category, subjects, referred to all others who were born within the nation's boundaries who did not fit the racial criteria for citizenship. Subjects would have no voting rights, could not hold any position within the state, and possessed none of the other rights and civic responsibilities conferred on citizens. All women were to be conferred "subject" status upon birth, and could only obtain "citizen" status if they worked independently or if they married a German citizen (see [[women in Nazi Germany]]).

The final category, aliens, referred to those who were citizens of another state, who also had no rights.

====Israel====
{{main article|Israeli citizenship law}}
The primary principles of Israeli citizenship is ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (citizenship by descent) for Jews and ''[[jus soli]]'' (citizenship by place of birth) for others.<ref name="safran1997">{{cite journal|first=William|last=Safran|date=1997-07-01|title=Citizenship and Nationality in Democratic Systems: Approaches to Defining and Acquiring Membership in the Political Community|publisher=SAGE Publishing|journal=International Political Science Review|volume=18|issue=3|pages=313–335|doi=10.1177/019251297018003006|s2cid=145476893}}</ref>

==Different senses==
Many theorists suggest that there are two opposing conceptions of citizenship: an economic one, and a political one. For further information, see [[History of citizenship#Competing senses of citizenship|History of citizenship]]. Citizenship status, under [[social contract]] theory, carries with it both [[Social rights (social contract theory)|rights]] and [[duties]]. In this sense, citizenship was described as "a bundle of rights -- primarily, political participation in the life of the community, the right to vote, and the right to receive certain protection from the community, as well as obligations."<ref name=twsJun16>{{cite book|author=Virginia Leary|editor1=Alan C.

How citizenship is understood depends on the person making the determination. The relation of citizenship has never been fixed or static, but constantly changes within each society. While citizenship has varied considerably throughout history, and within societies over time, there are some common elements but they vary considerably as well. As a bond, citizenship extends beyond basic kinship ties to unite people of different genetic backgrounds. It usually signifies membership in a political body. It is often based on, or was a result of, some form of military service or expectation of future service. It usually involves some form of political participation, but this can vary from token acts to active service in government.

Citizenship is a status in society. It is an ideal state as well. It generally describes a person with legal rights within a given political order. It almost always has an element of exclusion, meaning that some people are not citizens, and that this distinction can sometimes be very important, or not important, depending on a particular society. Citizenship as a concept is generally hard to isolate intellectually and compare with related political notions, since it relates to many other aspects of society such as the [[family]], [[military service]], the individual, [[political freedom|freedom]], [[religion]], ideas of [[ethics|right and wrong]], [[ethnicity]], and patterns for how a person should behave in society.<ref name=tws2Y14/> When there are many different groups within a nation, citizenship may be the only real bond which unites everybody as equals without discrimination—it is a "broad bond" linking "a person with the state" and gives people a universal identity as a legal member of a specific nation.<ref name=tws2Y15>{{Cite book

According to this viewpoint, citizens are sovereign, morally autonomous beings with duties to pay taxes, obey the law, engage in business transactions, and defend the nation if it comes under attack,<ref name=tws2Y14qwea/> but are essentially passive politically,<ref name=tws2Y18/> and their primary focus is on economic betterment. This idea began to appear around the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and became stronger over time, according to one view.<ref name=tws2Y12/> According to this formulation, the state exists for the benefit of citizens and has an obligation to respect and protect the rights of citizens, including civil rights and political rights.<ref name=tws2Y12/> It was later that so-called social rights became part of the obligation for the state.<ref name=tws2Y12/>

* The civic-republican or sometimes classical or civic humanist conception of citizenship emphasizes man's political nature, and sees citizenship as an active process, not a passive state or legal marker.<ref name=tws2Y18/> It is relatively more concerned that government will interfere with popular places to practice citizenship in the [[public sphere]]. Citizenship means being active in government affairs.<ref name=tws2Y14qwea/> According to one view, most people today live as citizens according to the liberal-individualist conception but wished they lived more according to the civic-republican ideal.<ref name=tws2Y18/> An ideal citizen is one who exhibits "good civic behavior".<ref name=tws2Y12/> Free citizens and a republic government are "mutually interrelated."<ref name=tws2Y12/> Citizenship suggested a commitment to "duty and civic virtue".<ref name=tws2Y12/>
{{further|Civic engagement}}

Scholars suggest that the concept of citizenship contains many unresolved issues, sometimes called tensions, existing within the relation, that continue to reflect uncertainty about what citizenship is supposed to mean.<ref name=tws2Y12/> Some unresolved issues regarding citizenship include questions about what is the proper balance between [[duties]] and [[rights]].<ref name=tws2Y12/> Another is a question about what is the proper balance between political citizenship versus social citizenship.<ref name=tws2Y12/> Some thinkers see benefits with people being absent from public affairs, since too much participation such as revolution can be destructive, yet too little participation such as total apathy can be problematic as well.<ref name=tws2Y12/> Citizenship can be seen as a special elite status, and it can also be seen as a democratizing force and something that everybody has; the concept can include both senses.<ref name=tws2Y12/> According to [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Arthur Stinchcombe]], citizenship is based on the extent that a person can control one's own destiny within the group in the sense of being able to influence the government of the group.<ref name=tws2Y14>{{Cite book

==International==
{{See also|Global citizenship}}
Some [[intergovernmental organization]]s have extended the concept and terminology associated with citizenship to the international level,<ref>[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8737.html ''"The Global Commonwealth of Citizens. Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy"''], [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 2008</ref> where it is applied to the totality of the citizens of their constituent countries combined. Citizenship at this level is a secondary concept, with rights deriving from national citizenship.

===European Union===
{{Main|Citizenship of the European Union}}
The [[Maastricht Treaty]] introduced the concept of [[citizenship of the European Union]]. Article 17 (1) of the [[Treaties of the European Union#Treaty on European Union|Treaty on European Union]]<ref>Note: the consolidated version.</ref> stated that: <blockquote>Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenship.<ref name="Rome">{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0001:01:EN:HTML|title=Consolidated versions of the Treaty on European Union}}</ref></blockquote>

An agreement known as the amended [[EC Treaty]]<ref name="Rome" /> established certain minimal rights for European Union citizens. Article 12 of the amended EC Treaty guaranteed a general right of non-discrimination within the scope of the Treaty. Article 18 provided a limited right to free movement and residence in Member States other than that of which the European Union citizen is a national. Articles 18-21 and 225 provide certain political rights.

Union citizens have also extensive [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|rights to move in order to exercise economic activity]] in any of the Member States<ref>Note: Articles 39, 43, 49 EC.</ref> which predate the introduction of Union citizenship.<ref>Violaine Hacker, « Citoyenneté culturelle et politique européenne des médias : entre compétitivité et promotion des valeurs », NATIONS, CULTURES ET ENTREPRISES EN EUROPE, sous la direction de Gilles Rouet, Collection Local et Global, L'Harmattan, Paris, pp. 163-184</ref>

===Mercosur===
{{Main|Citizenship of the Mercosur}}
Citizenship of the [[Mercosur]] is granted to eligible citizens of the [[Member states of Mercosur|Southern Common Market member states]]. It was approved in 2010 through the Citizenship Statute and should be fully implemented by the member countries in 2021, when the program will be transformed in an international treaty incorporated into the national legal system of the countries, under the concept of "Mercosur Citizen".{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

===Commonwealth===
{{Main|Commonwealth citizen}}
The concept of "Commonwealth Citizenship" has been in place ever since the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. As with the EU, one holds Commonwealth citizenship only by being a citizen of a Commonwealth member state. This form of citizenship offers certain privileges within some Commonwealth countries:
* Some such countries do not require tourist [[visa (document)|visas]] of citizens of other Commonwealth countries, or allow some Commonwealth citizens to stay in the country for tourism purposes without a visa for longer than citizens of other countries.
* In some Commonwealth countries, [[permanent resident|resident]] citizens of other Commonwealth countries are entitled to political rights, e.g., the [[right to vote]] in local and national elections and in some cases even the right to stand for election.
* In some instances the right to work in any position (including the [[civil service]]) is granted, except for certain specific positions, such as in the defense departments, [[Governor-General]] or [[President (government title)|President]] or [[Prime Minister]].
*In the United Kingdom, all Commonwealth citizens legally residing in the country can vote and stand for office at all elections.

Although [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] was excluded from the Commonwealth in 1949 because it declared itself a republic, Ireland is generally treated as if it were still a member. Legislation often specifically provides for equal treatment between Commonwealth countries and Ireland and refers to "Commonwealth countries and Ireland".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/246/pdfs/uksi_20050246_en.pdf|title=The Commonwealth Countries and Ireland (Immunities and Privileges) (Amendment) Order 2005}}</ref> Ireland's citizens are not classified as foreign nationals in the [[United Kingdom]].

Canada departed from the principle of nationality being defined in terms of allegiance in 1921. In 1935 the [[Irish Free State]] was the first to introduce its own citizenship. However, [[Irish citizen]]s were still treated as [[British subject|subjects of the Crown]], and they are still not regarded as foreign, even though Ireland is not a member of the Commonwealth.<ref>''Murray v Parkes'' [1942] All ER 123.</ref> The [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act]] of 1947 provided for a distinct [[Canadian nationality law|Canadian Citizenship]], automatically conferred upon most individuals born in Canada, with some exceptions, and defined the conditions under which one could become a naturalized citizen. The concept of Commonwealth citizenship was introduced in 1948 in the [[History of British nationality law#British Nationality Act 1948|British Nationality Act 1948]]. Other [[dominion]]s adopted this principle such as [[New Zealand]],  by way of the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act of 1948.

==Subnational==
Citizenship most usually relates to membership of the nation state, but the term can also apply at the subnational level. [[Subnational entity|Subnational entities]] may impose requirements, of [[Residency (domicile)|residency]] or otherwise, which permit citizens to participate in the political life of that entity, or to enjoy benefits provided by the government of that entity. But in such cases, those eligible are also sometimes seen as "citizens" of the relevant state, province, or region. An example of this is how the fundamental basis of [[Switzerland|Swiss]] citizenship is citizenship of an individual [[Commune (administrative division)|commune]], from which follows citizenship of a [[Canton (country subdivision)|canton]] and of the Confederation. Another example is [[Åland]] where the residents enjoy a special provincial citizenship within [[Finland]], ''hembygdsrätt''.

The United States has a federal system in which a person is a citizen of their specific state of residence, such as [[New York (state)|New York]] or [[California]], as well as a [[Citizenship in the United States|citizen of the United States]]. State [[constitution]]s may grant certain rights above and beyond what are granted under the [[United States Constitution]] and may impose their own obligations including the sovereign right of taxation and military service; each state maintains at least one military force subject to national militia transfer service, the state's national guard, and some states maintain a second military force not subject to nationalization.

==Education==
{{Main|Citizenship education (subject)}}
"[[Active citizenship]]" is the philosophy that citizens should work towards the betterment of their community through economic participation, public, volunteer work, and other such efforts to improve life for all citizens. In this vein, citizenship education is taught in schools, as an academic subject in some countries. By the time children reach secondary education there is an emphasis on such unconventional subjects to be included in academic curriculum. While the diagram on citizenship to the right is rather facile and depth-less, it is simplified to explain the general model of citizenship that is taught to many secondary school pupils. The idea behind this model within education is to instill in young pupils that their actions (i.e. their [[Election|vote]]) affect collective citizenship and thus in turn them.

===Republic of Ireland===
It is taught in the [[Republic of Ireland]] as an exam subject for the Junior Certificate. It is known as Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE). A new Leaving Certificate exam subject with the working title 'Politics & Society' is being developed by the [[National Council for Curriculum and Assessment]] (NCCA) and is expected to be introduced to the curriculum sometime after 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncca.ie/en/Publications/Reports/Senior_Cycle_Politics_and_Society_Report_on_the_consultation.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928175132/http://www.ncca.ie/en/Publications/Reports/Senior_Cycle_Politics_and_Society_Report_on_the_consultation.pdf |archive-date=2013-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
Citizenship is offered as a [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) course in many schools in the [[United Kingdom]]. As well as teaching knowledge about [[democracy]], parliament, government, the justice system, [[human rights]] and the UK's relations with the wider world, students participate in active citizenship, often involving a social action or social enterprise in their local community.
*Citizenship is a compulsory subject of the National Curriculum in state schools in [[England]] for all pupils aged 11–16. Some schools offer a qualification in this subject at [[GCSE]] and [[A level]]. All state schools have a statutory requirement to teach the subject, assess pupil attainment and report student's progress in citizenship to parents.<ref name=dfes>{{cite web

*Citizenship is not taught as a discrete subject in [[Scotland|Scottish]] schools, but is a cross-curricular strand of the Curriculum for Excellence. However they do teach a subject called "Modern Studies" which covers the social, political and economic study of local, national and international issues.<ref>{{cite web

*Citizenship is taught as a standalone subject in all state [[Education in Northern Ireland|schools in Northern Ireland]] and most other schools in some forms from year 8 to 10 prior to [[GCSEs]]. Components of Citizenship are then also incorporated into GCSE courses such as 'Learning for Life and Work'.

==Criticism of citizenship education in schools==
There are two kinds of criticism of citizenship education in schools. Firstly, some philosophers of education argue that most governments and mainstream policies stimulate and advocate questionable approaches of citizenship education. These approaches aim to develop specific dispositions in students, dispositions conducive to political participation and solidarity. But there are radically different views on the nature of good citizenship and education should involve and develop autonomy and open-mindedness. Therefore, it requires a more critical approach than is possible when political participation and solidarity are conceived of as goals of education.<ref name="Van der Ploeg & Guérin">Van der Ploeg, P.A. & L.J.F. Guérin (2016) Questioning Participation and Solidarity as Goals of Citizenship Education. ''Critical Review'', DOI: 10.1080/08913811.2016.1191191 [https://www.academia.edu/28404527/Questioning_Participation_and_Solidarity_as_Goals_of_Citizenship_Education]</ref> Secondly, some educationalists argue that merely teaching children about the theory of citizenship is ineffective, unless schools themselves reflect democratic practices by giving children the opportunity to have a say in decision making. They suggest that schools are fundamentally undemocratic institutions, and that such a setting cannot instill in children the commitment and belief in democratic values that is necessary for citizenship education to have a proper impact.<ref name=Greenberg>Greenberg, D. (1992), Education in America - A View from Sudbury Valley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YQn_BA76TF4C&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=Greenberg+Education+in+America+-+A+View+from+Sudbury+Valley+%22Democracy+Must+be+Experienced+to+be+Learned%22#v=onepage&q=&f=false "Democracy Must be Experienced to be Learned."] Retrieved 14 June 2011.</ref> Some educationalists relate this criticism to [[John Dewey]] (see critical comments on this interpretation of Dewey: Van der Ploeg, 2016).<ref name="Van der Ploeg">Van der Ploeg, P.A. (2016) Dewey versus ‘Dewey’ on democracy and education, ''Education, Citizenship and Social Justice'', DOI: 10.1177/1746197916648283 [https://www.academia.edu/26426259/Dewey_versus_Dewey_on_democracy_and_education]</ref>
