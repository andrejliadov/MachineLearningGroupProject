'''Treacle mining''' is the fictitious mining of [[treacle]] (similar to [[molasses]]) in a raw form similar to coal. The subject purports to be serious but is an attempt to test [[credulity]]. Thick black treacle makes the deception plausible. The topic has been a joke in [[British humour]] since the mid-19th century.

==Origins==
One possible origin of the joke is from 1853 when 8,000 [[British Army]] soldiers were camped on [[Chobham Common]]. The camp included storehouses containing barrels. When the soldiers left for the [[Crimean War]] and the site was dismantled, they buried barrels to avoid having to remove them. Some of the barrels contained treacle and [[Chobham]] villagers who discovered and removed them were called "treacle miners" as a joke. Local folklore about treacle mining was extended into history back to [[Roman Britain]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Alice Eats Wonderland|page=53|author1=August Imholtz  |author2=Alison Tannenbaum |name-list-style=amp |publisher=Applewood Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1429091060}}</ref>

Another explanation is that "treacle" meant 'a medicine', derived from the appearance of the Greek derivative '[[theriac]]al' meaning medicinal (Greek ''theriake'' "curative", "antidote"), so the various healing wells around Britain were called "treacle wells". Treacle later came to mean a sticky syrup after the popularity of a honey-based drug called "[[Venice treacle]]", and the continued use of the old form in the treacle wells led to the joke.<ref>{{Cite book |author1       = Cooper, Quentin

In Devon, on the eastern edge of [[Dartmoor]], UK, the remains of mines that produced [[micaceous hematite]], used as [[pounce (calligraphy)|pounce]] to dust early ink to prevent smearing, are known locally as "treacle mines" since they show a glistening black residue that looks like treacle.

==Locations==
The village of [[Sabden]] in [[Lancashire]] cultivated a considerable body of folklore about local treacle mining in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lancashire mill town traditions|page=9|author=William Reginald Mitchell|publisher=Dalesman|year=1977|isbn=0852064144}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Lancashire nicknames and sayings|page=63|author=Bob Dobson|publisher=Dalesman|year=1973|isbn=0852061773}}</ref> The local newspaper helped foster the myth, publishing numerous stories about the fictitious mines.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Lore of the Land: A Guide to England's Legends, from Spring-heeled Jack to the Witches of Warboys|page=871|author1=Jennifer Westwood  |author2=Jacqueline Simpson |name-list-style=amp |publisher=Penguin Books|year=2005|isbn=0141021039}}</ref>

The paper mills around [[Maidstone]] in Kent were known  as "The [[Tovil]] Treacle Mines"<ref>Tovil pronounced to rhyme with "[[Bovril]]" – not "Toeville")</ref> by locals, after the area where one of the mills owned by Albert E. Reed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reed-elsevier.com/index.cfm?articleid=113|title=Reed Elsevier – Product highlight|publisher=[[Reed Elsevier]]|accessdate=31 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212122102/http://www.reed-elsevier.com/index.cfm?articleid=113|archivedate=12 December 2004}}</ref> was situated. The company helped the myth with a float in Maidstone carnival with a "treacle mine" theme. 

One suggested source of the story in this area is a rumour that the paper industry was threatened during the [[Second World War]] because there was no imported [[timber]]. Fermentation of straw was tried, creating a sticky goo. There were attempts to make paper from other than rags in the 19th century and an early commercial success was achieved by Samuel Hook and his son, Charles Townsend Hook, using straw at Upper Tovil Mill in the 1850s. The road next to Upper Tovil Mill became known, and was later named, as Straw Mill Hill. To produce pulp, the straw was cooked in hot alkali. After separation of the fibre, the remaining liquid looked like black treacle. Upper Tovil Mill closed in the 1980s and the site was used for a housing estate.

[[Tudeley]] and [[Frittenden]] in Kent are also said to have had treacle mines. A tank wagon on the [[Kent and East Sussex Railway]] was painted in sham "Frittenden Treacle Mines" livery in 2009.<ref name=Tank>{{cite web|url=https://www.kesr.org.uk/visitor-information/about-kesr/stations/15-stock/wagons/128-132|title=Nº. 132 – Esso 14 ton Tank Wagon Nº. 2338|publisher=Kent & East Sussex Railway|accessdate=23 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218134931/https://www.kesr.org.uk/visitor-information/about-kesr/stations/15-stock/wagons/128-132|archivedate=18 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Suggestions of a treacle mine in [[Buxted]] were published by the "Friends of Horwich".<ref>[http://www.treacleminer.com/docs/buxtedtreacle.htm Buxted Treacle Mine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717093624/http://www.treacleminer.com/docs/buxtedtreacle.htm |date=17 July 2011 }}</ref>

[[Tadley]] treacle mines had a local hotel named after them and a Tadley Treacle Fair is held. Legend says the name derives from using treacle tins to store money because banks could not be trusted. The tins were buried around the village. Criminals mined for tins.

[[Hemel Hempstead]] in [[Hertfordshire]] has a legend of having a treacle mine and a local nickname since around [[World War One]] was "Treacle Bumstead".<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Boy from Treacle Bumstead: A Country Lad's Journey from Reform School to National Service|last = Sears|first = Ken|publisher = Simon & Schuster Ltd|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1471113574|location = |pages = }}</ref> [[Wareside]], also in Hertfordshire, has long had its own "treacle mines". When asked "where have you been?", it was often a popular answer in and around [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], to say "down the treacle mines!"

Treacle mines have also been claimed in the twin villages [[Trimley St. Martin]] and [[Trimley St. Mary]] (Suffolk), [[Wem]] ([[Shropshire]]), [[Talskiddy]], [[Bisham]], [[Nuneaton]], [[Sway, Hampshire|Sway]] ([[Hampshire]]), [[West Ginge|Ginge]] ([[Oxfordshire]]), [[Chobham]] ([[Surrey]]), [[Tongham]], [[Tadley]], [[Skidby]], [[Ditchford railway station|Ditchford]], [[Crick, Northamptonshire|Crick]] ([[Northamptonshire]]), [[Debdale]] ([[Leicestershire]]), [[Dunchideock]] and many other locations across [[Somerset]] and [[Devon]],<ref>{{cite book

==Actual places==
Several [[public house]]s, restaurants and hotels have borne the name. The Treacle Mine public house in [[Grays, Essex|Grays]], [[Thurrock]], Essex (pictured above) is an example, and the adjacent [[Treacle Mine Roundabout]], which features on the local bus timetable, is named after the public house.

There is a restaurant/pub named Treacle Mine in [[Polegate]], East Sussex;.<ref>{{cite web|last=Table Table|title=Treacle Mine Restaurant|url=http://www.tabletable.co.uk/content/tabletable/our-pubs/brighton/treacle-mine.html|publisher=Whitbread plc|accessdate=30 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003223837/http://www.tabletable.co.uk/content/tabletable/our-pubs/brighton/treacle-mine.html|archivedate=3 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  The name refers to the Polegate treacle mines, a long-running tale in the area that is very popular, with locals dressing as treacle miners for the 1978 Eastbourne carnival.  The origins are believed to be associated with a nearby sweet factory.<ref>https://www.whitbreadinns.co.uk/treacle-mine-pub-and-restaurant/story retrieved 1 May 2017</ref>

The Broomsquire Hotel in [[Tadley]], Hampshire, was previously the Treacle Mine Hotel; and another Treacle Mine pub is in [[Hereford]].

Since April 2009 the town of [[Wincanton]] in Somerset, twinned with [[Ankh-Morpork]], has had a Treacle Mine Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/7984118.stm|title=Roads named after Discworld books|publisher=BBC News|date=5 April 2009|accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref>

== Cultural references ==
The Treacle Mine has been a joke played on children and the gullible since at least the nineteenth century.
*[[Ottershaw School]] in [[Surrey]] (a state boarding school founded in 1948 and closed in 1980) encouraged all new boys, on their first Sunday, to wait outside the Main gate for the coach that would take them on an outing to the Chobham Treacle Mines.
*In ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) by [[Lewis Carroll]], Alice is shushed at the [[The Hatter|Mad Hatter's]] tea party for disbelieving a story told by the [[Dormouse]] about a treacle well, inspired by the [[holy well]] at [[Binsey, Oxfordshire]].
*In ''[[Uncle and the Treacle Trouble]]'' (1967), a children's book by [[J. P. Martin]], the main character (an elephant named "Uncle") discovers the true meaning of a cryptic sign which reads "Treac Levat"; the characters soon discover that it relates to a vast hidden treacle vat.
*Treacle mining features in several novels by [[Terry Pratchett]]. On the fictional [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]] treacle is mined from buried deposits of compressed ancient sugarcane. In the city of [[Ankh-Morpork]] there is a street named Treacle Mine Road, with the current watch house (analogous to a police station) found in the building formerly housing the entrance to a treacle mine. The books also make references to "deep treacle" deposits beneath the city. As with many features of the Discworld, treacle mines exist ''because'' people believe in them, according to the Discworld's Theory of Narrative Causality.
*''[[The Treacle People]]'' was a children's TV show from 1995 based around the treacle mines of [[Sabden]] in [[Lancashire]].
*All the members of the Seven Champions [[Molly dance|Molly Dancers]] <ref name=SevenChamps>[http://www.sevenchampions.org.uk Seven Champions Molly Dancers]</ref> from [[Kent]] are reputed to be treacle miners.
*Some of [[Ken Dodd]]'s [[Diddy Men]] were said to work in a [[Jam sandwich (food)|jam butty]] mine.  This appears to be a similar concept.
