'''Aerial application''', or what is informally referred to as '''crop dusting''', involves spraying crops with crop protection products from an [[agricultural aircraft]]. Planting certain types of seed are also included in aerial application. The specific spreading of fertilizer is also known as ''[[aerial topdressing]] ''in some countries. Many countries have severely limited aerial application of [[pesticide]]s and other products because of environmental and public health hazards like [[Pesticide drift|spray drift]]; most notably, the [[European Union]] banned it outright with a few highly restricted exceptions in 2009,<ref name=sprayBanEuro /> effectively ending the practice in all member states.

Agricultural aircraft are highly specialized, purpose-built aircraft. Today's agricultural aircraft are often powered by turbine engines of up to {{cvt|1500|shp}} and can carry as much as {{convert|800|USgal|l}} of crop protection product. [[Helicopter]]s are sometimes used, and some aircraft serve double duty as [[water bomber]]s in areas prone to [[wildfires]]. (These aircraft are referred to as SEAT, "single engine air tankers").

==History==

===Aerial seed sowing===
The first known aerial application of agricultural materials was by John Chaytor, who in 1906 spread seed over a swamped valley floor in [[Wairoa]], [[New Zealand]], using a [[hot air balloon]] with mobile tethers.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Aerial sowing of seed still continues to this day with cover crop applications and rice planting.

===Crop dusting===

The first known use of a heavier-than-air machine to disperse products occurred on 3 August 1921.<ref name="JohnsonMary">{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Mary Ann |title=McCook Field 1917–1927 |publisher=Landfall Press |location=Dayton, Ohio |year=2002 |isbn=0-913428-84-1 |pages=190–191 }}</ref> Crop dusting was developed under the joint efforts of the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], and the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]]' research station at [[McCook Field]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].<ref name="JohnsonMary" /> Under the direction of McCook engineer [[Etienne Dormoy]], a [[United States Army Air Service]] [[Curtiss JN4]] Jenny piloted by [[John A.

Harold R. Harris.<ref name="JohnsonMary" /> Use of [[insecticide]] and [[fungicide]] for crop dusting slowly spread in the Americas and to a lesser extent other nations in the 1930s. The name 'crop dusting' originated here, as actual dust was spread across the crops. Today, aerial applicators use liquid crop protection products in very small doses.

===Top dressing===
{{main|Aerial topdressing}}
Aerial topdressing is the aerial application of fertilisers over farmland using agricultural aircraft. It was developed in New Zealand in the 1940s and rapidly adopted elsewhere in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===Purpose-built aircraft===
In 1951, Leland Snow begins designing the first aircraft specifically built for aerial application, the S-1. In 1957, The Grumman G-164 Ag-Cat is the first aircraft designed by a major company for ag aviation. Currently, the most common agricultural aircraft are the [[Air Tractor]], [[Cessna 188|Cessna Ag-wagon]], [[Gippsland GA200]], [[Grumman Ag Cat]], [[PZL-106 Kruk|PZL-106 KRUK]], [[M-18 Dromader]], [[PAC Fletcher]], [[Piper PA-36 Pawnee Brave]], [[Embraer EMB 202 Ipanema]], and [[Rockwell Thrush Commander]] but multi-purpose [[helicopter]]s are also used.

===Unmanned aerial application===

Beginning in the late 1990s, [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] are also being used for agricultural spraying. This phenomenon started in Japan and South Korea, where mountainous terrain and relatively small family-owned farms required lower-cost and higher precision spraying. {{as of|2014}}, the use of UAV crop dusters, such as the [[Yamaha R-MAX]], is being expanded to the United States for use in spraying of vineyards.<ref>Evan Ackerman, [https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/aerial-robots/yamaha-demos-agricultural-robocopter Yamaha Demos Agricultural RoboCopter, But Humans Can't Unleash It Yet], ''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'', Oct. 16th 2014.</ref> Now they work long hours (10–12 hours a day) and almost everyday of the week.

==Bans==

Since the 1970s, multiple countries started to limit or ban aerial application of pesticides, [[fertilizer]]s and other products out of environmental and public health concerns, in particular from [[Pesticide drift|spray drift]]. Most notably, in 2009 the [[European Union]] prohibited aerial spraying of pesticides with a few highly restricted exceptions in article 9 of ''[[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] 2009/128/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides'', which effectively ended most aerial application in all member states and overseas territories.<ref name=sprayBanEuro>{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32009L0128|title=EUR-Lex - 32009L0128 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref>
