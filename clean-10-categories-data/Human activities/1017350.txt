A '''cosmorama''' is an exhibition of [[perspective picture]]s of different places in the world, usually world [[landmark]]s. Careful use of illumination and lenses gives the images greater realism.

Cosmorama was also the name of an entertainment in 19th century London, at 207-209 [[Regent Street]], at which the public could view scenes of distant lands and exotic subjects through optical devices that magnified the pictures. It was later converted into an exhibition of curiosities named the [[Prince of Wales Bazaar]]. Exhibits included a sea lion, a sea serpent and L. Bertolotto's [[Flea circus]].
