A '''chemical oxygen generator''' is a device that releases [[oxygen]] via a [[chemical reaction]]. The oxygen source is usually an inorganic [[superoxide]],<ref>Hayyan M., Hashim M.A., AlNashef I.M., Superoxide Ion: Generation and Chemical Implications, Chem. Rev., 2016, 116 (5), pp 3029–3085. [[DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00407]]</ref> [[chlorate]], or [[perchlorate]]; [[ozonide]]s are a promising group of oxygen sources.  The generators are usually ignited by a [[firing pin]], and the chemical reaction is usually [[exothermic]], making the generator a potential [[fire hazard]]. [[Potassium superoxide]] was used as an oxygen source on early manned  missions of the [[Soviet space program]], for [[firefighting|firefighters]], and for [[mine rescue]].

== In commercial airliners ==

Commercial aircraft provide [[Emergency oxygen system|emergency oxygen]] to passengers to protect them from drops in cabin pressure. Chemical oxygen generators are not used for the cockpit crew, who are typically supplied using compressed oxygen canisters also known as oxygen bottles.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} In narrow body airliners, for each row of seats there are overhead [[oxygen mask]]s and oxygen generators. In some wide-body airliners, such as the [[DC-10]] and [[IL-96]], the canisters and oxygen masks are mounted in the top portion of the seat backs, since the ceiling is too high above the passengers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} If a decompression occurs, the panels are opened either by an automatic pressure switch or by a manual switch, and the masks are released. When the passengers pull down on the mask they remove the retaining pins and trigger the production of oxygen.

The oxidizer core is [[sodium chlorate]] ([[Sodium|Na]][[Chlorine|Cl]][[Oxygen|O]]<sub>3</sub>), which is mixed with less than 5
percent [[barium peroxide]] ([[barium|Ba]][[Oxygen|O]]<sub>2</sub>) and less than 1 percent [[potassium perchlorate]] ([[potassium|K]][[chlorine|Cl]][[oxygen|O]]<sub>4</sub>). The explosives in the percussion cap are a [[lead styphnate]] and [[tetrazene explosive]] mixture. The chemical reaction is exothermic and the exterior temperature of the canister will reach {{convert|260|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. It will produce oxygen for 12 to 22 minutes.<ref>

Accidental activation of improperly shipped expired generators caused the [[ValuJet Flight 592]] crash, killing all on board. An ATA DC-10, Flight 131, was also destroyed while parked at O'Hare Airport, on August 10, 1986. The cause was the accidental activation of an oxygen canister, contained in the back of a broken DC-10 seat, being shipped in the cargo compartment to a repair station. There were no fatalities or injuries because the plane contained no passengers when the fire broke out.<ref>[http://www.airliners.net/photo/American-Trans-Air/McDonnell-Douglas-DC-10-40/0148751/L/&sid=faf57dd90832c5c13834020fb2255dc2 Airliners.net, Photograph, Dave Campbell]</ref>

==Oxygen candle==
A ''chlorate candle'', or an ''oxygen candle'', is a cylindrical chemical oxygen generator that contains a mix of [[sodium chlorate]] and [[iron]] powder, which when ignited [[smoldering|smolders]] at about {{convert|600|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, producing [[sodium chloride]], [[iron oxide]], and at a fixed rate of about 6.5 man-hours of oxygen per kilogram of the mixture. The mixture has an indefinite shelf life if stored properly: candles have been stored for 20 years without decreased oxygen output.  [[Thermal decomposition]] releases the oxygen.  The burning iron supplies the heat. The candle must be wrapped in thermal insulation to maintain the reaction temperature and to protect surrounding equipment.  The key reaction is:<ref name=G&E>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>
:2 NaClO<sub>3</sub>  →  2 NaCl  +  3 O<sub>2</sub>

[[potassium chlorate|Potassium]] and [[lithium chlorate]], and [[sodium perchlorate|sodium]], [[potassium perchlorate|potassium]] and [[lithium perchlorate]]s can also be used in oxygen candles.

An explosion caused by one of these candles killed two Royal Navy sailors on {{HMS|Tireless|S88}}, a nuclear-powered submarine, under the Arctic on 21&nbsp;March 2007.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=C. W.|title=Degraded Modes and the 'Culture of Coping' in Military Operations: An Analysis of a Fatal Incident on-board HMS Tireless on 20/21 March 2007|url=http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~johnson/papers/JWSSC2009/Degraded_Modes.pdf}}</ref>  The candle had become contaminated with hydraulic oil, which caused the mixture to explode rather than burn.<ref>{{cite web |title = 'Oxygen candle' caused explosion| url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/03/22/sub_blast_oxy_candle/ | publisher = The Register | last = Page | first = Lewis | date = 22 March 2007 | accessdate = 2013-09-04 }}</ref>

In the [[Vika oxygen generator]] used on some spacecraft, [[lithium perchlorate]] is the source of [[oxygen]]. At 400&nbsp;°C, it releases 60% of its weight as [[oxygen]]:<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lithium Perchlorate Oxygen Candle. Pyrochemical Source of Pure Oxygen|authors=M. M. Markowitz, D. A. Boryta, and Harvey Stewart Jr.|journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod. Res. Dev.|year=1964|volume=3|issue=4|pages=321–330

==Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generators==
{{Main|Oxygen concentrator}}
Advances in technology have provided industrial oxygen generator systems for use where air is available and a higher concentration of oxygen is desired. [[Pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA) incorporates a material called molecular sieve for gas separation. In the case of oxygen generation a zeolite-based sieve forces preferential adsorption for nitrogen.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}} Clean, dry air is passed through the sieve beds on the oxygen generator, producing an oxygen-enriched gas.  [[Nitrogen separation membrane]] equipment is also used.

==Uses==
Chemical oxygen generators are used in [[aircraft]], breathing apparatus for [[firefighter]]s and mine rescue crews, [[submarine]]s, and everywhere a compact emergency oxygen generator with long shelf life is needed. They usually contain a device for absorption of [[carbon dioxide]], sometimes a filter filled with [[lithium hydroxide]]; a kilogram of LiOH absorbs about half a kilogram of CO<sub>2</sub>.
*Self-contained oxygen generators (SCOGs) are used in submarines.
*[[Self-contained self-rescue device]]s (SCSRs) are used to facilitate escape from [[mining|mines]].
*On the [[International Space Station]], chemical oxygen generators are used as a backup supply. Each canister can produce enough oxygen for one crewmember for one day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barry|first=Patrick|title=Breathing Easy on the Space Station|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast13nov_1/|accessdate=9 September 2012|year=2000|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]}}</ref>
