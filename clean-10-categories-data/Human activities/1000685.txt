A '''car chase''' is the vehicular overland chase of one party by another, involving at least one automobile or other wheeled [[motor vehicle]] in pursuit -- commonly [[hot pursuit]] of [[suspect]]s by [[law enforcers]]. The rise of the [[automotive industry]] in the 20th century increased [[car ownership]], leading to a growing number of criminals attempting to evade police in [[Crime scene getaway#Vehicle|their own vehicle]] or a [[stolen car]]. Car chases may, instead (or also), involve other parties (including criminals) in pursuit of a criminal suspect or intended victim, or simply in an attempt to make contact with a moving person for non-conflict reasons.

Car chases are often captured on news broadcast due to the video footage recorded by [[police car]]s and [[Police aviation|police]] and [[News media|media]] [[helicopters]] participating in the chase. Car chases are also a popular subject with media and audiences due to their intensity, drama and the innate danger of high-speed driving -- and thus are common content in fiction, particularly [[action drama]]s.

== In reality ==
Car chases occur when a suspect attempts to use a [[vehicle]] to escape from law enforcement attempting to detain or arrest him or her. The assumed [[offence (law)|offence]] committed may range from [[misdemeanour]]s such as [[Moving violation|traffic infraction]]s to felonies as serious as [[murder]]. When suspects realize they have been spotted by law enforcement, they attempt to lose their pursuer by driving away, usually at high speed. Generally, suspects whom police spot committing crimes for which long prison terms are likely upon conviction are much more likely to start car chases. In 2002, 700 pursuits were reported in the city of [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/27/1046064169270.html?oneclick=true | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Los Angeles urges media to curb coverage of police chases | date=2003-02-28}}</ref>

Los Angeles television station [[KCAL-TV|KCAL]] reported a quadrupling of ratings when police pursuits aired.<ref>{{citation |mode=cs1 |last=Kine |first=Starlee |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/248/transcript |section=If It Drives, Go Live |type=Transcript |title=Like It or Not |publisher=This American Life |date=24 October 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508125649/http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/248/transcript |archive-date=2012-05-08}}</ref> Police officials have asked news media to reduce coverage of chases, claiming that they encourage suspects to flee and inciting gawkers to possibly get in the way of the pursuit, while the media responds that coverage of chases provides a public service and provide a deterrent to [[police brutality]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Top Cops Pan TV Car Chase Coverage|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/27/local/me-pursuit27|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 27, 2003|first1=Jill|last1=Leovy|first2=Greg|last2=Braxton}}</ref>

Police use a number of techniques to end chases, from pleading with the driver, waiting for the driver's vehicle to run out of fuel, or hoping the driver's vehicle becomes somehow disabled to more forceful methods such as boxing in the vehicle with [[police cruiser]]s, ramming the vehicle, the [[PIT maneuver]], shooting out the [[tire]]s, or the use of [[spike strips]], though all efforts, many of which pose risk to all involved as well as bystanders, will be aimed at avoiding danger to civilians. When available, a [[police helicopter|helicopter]] may be employed, which in some cases, may follow the vehicle from above while ground units may or may not be involved. The [[StarChase]] system as of summer 2009 was in use by the [[Arizona Department of Public Safety]].<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.azdps.gov/Media/News/View/?p=115 |title=DPS becomes the first state-level law enforcement agency in the country to deploy the StarChase Pursuit Management System |website=Arizona Department of Public Safety |date=September 30, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015050053/http://www.azdps.gov/Media/News/View/?p=115 |archive-date=2009-10-15}}</ref>

The February [[2005 Macquarie Fields riots]] occurred in [[Sydney, Australia]] after a local driver crashed a stolen vehicle into a tree, killing his two passengers following a high-speed police pursuit. The death of university student Clea Rose following a police chase in Canberra sparked major recriminations over police pursuit policies. [[Ole Christian Bach]] was found shot and killed in [[Sweden]] in a presumed [[suicide]] after he had been followed in a car chase by Swedish undercover police.

[[Reality television]] has combined with the car chase genre in a number of television shows and specials featuring real footage, mostly taken from police cruisers and [[Police helicopter|law enforcement]] or media helicopters of suspects fleeing police.

One notable, recorded police chase occurred when an [[M60 Patton]] [[tank]] was stolen by [[Shawn Nelson (criminal)|Shawn Nelson]] from an [[Army National Guard]] [[armory (military)|armory]], on May 17, 1995. Nelson went on a rampage through [[San Diego]], [[California]], with the massive tank crushing multiple civilian vehicles before becoming stuck on a road divider. Police were able to get aboard the tank and open the hatch, killing the suspect when he would not surrender.

On June 4, 2004, [[welder]] [[Marvin Heemeyer]] went on a rampage in a heavily modified [[bulldozer]] in [[Granby, Colorado]], wrecking 13 buildings including the town hall, the public library, a bank, a concrete batch plant, and a house owned by the town's former mayor, resulting in over $7&nbsp;million in damage. The police were initially powerless, as none of their [[weapons]] could penetrate the suspect's vehicle. However, the bulldozer's engine failed and the machine became stuck, so Heemeyer committed suicide by gunshot.

On July 27, 2007, at exactly 12:46:20&nbsp;p.m. [[Mountain Standard Time|MST]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], [[2007 Phoenix news helicopter collision|two helicopters crashed in mid air]]. Both were [[Eurocopter AS350|AS-350 AStar]] helicopters from [[KNXV-TV]] (the area's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate) and [[KTVK]] (an independent, but was the ABC affiliate until losing it to KNXV in 1995) news stations [[Mid-air collision|collided in mid-air]] above [[Steele Indian School Park]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]] while covering a police pursuit.<ref>{{cite news|title=4 Dead As 2 Helicopters Tracking Police Pursuit Collide |date=2007-07-27 |url=http://www.kpho.com/news/13770683/detail.html |work=KPHO-TV |access-date=2007-07-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030213/http://www.kpho.com/news/13770683/detail.html |archive-date=2007-09-27 }}</ref><ref name="ntsb">[https://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2009/AAR0902.pdf Accident Report 0902] Midair Collision of Electronic News Gathering Helicopters KTVK-TV, Eurocopter AS350B2, N613TV, and U.S. Helicopters, Inc., Eurocopter AS350B2, N215TV Aircraft [[National Transportation Safety Board]].

On September 28, 2012, [[Fox News]] aired a live police chase in Arizona which ended in the suspect exiting the vehicle and shooting himself after a short foot chase. Fox News was airing it in a five-second delay instead of a normal ten-second delay, which resulted in the shooting being aired on a live broadcast of the [[Fox Report]]. Fox [[news presenter|anchorman]] [[Shepard Smith]] soon apologized for the broadcast and vowed to never let it happen again.<ref>

===Risks and legal considerations===
High-speed car chases are recognized as a [[road safety]] problem, as vehicles not involved in the pursuit or pedestrians or street furniture may be hit by the elusive driver, who will often violate a number of traffic laws, often repeatedly, in their attempt to escape, or by the pursuing police cars. In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 40 people a year are killed in road traffic incidents involving police, most as a result of a police pursuit.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/pr180907_rti.htm |title=IPCC publishes major study on police road traffic incidents |website=Independent Police Complaints Commission |date=18 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124022341/http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/pr180907_rti.htm |archive-date=2009-01-24 |url-status=unfit}}</ref> In the United States, chase-related deaths range between 300 and 400 people per year.<ref name="npr">{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/07/23/425598535/even-if-a-car-chase-will-help-police-nab-a-suspect-some-don-t |title=In Hot Pursuit Of Public Safety, Police Consider Fewer Car Chases|author=Bridgit Bowden |date=July 23, 2015 |work=All Things Considered |publisher=NPR |type=Transcript}}</ref>

[[Kristie's Law]] was a proposed [[California]] law that would restrict immunity for damage (including injuries or deaths) caused by high-speed pursuits, where law enforcement agencies have established, but not followed, written pursuit policies.

In 2007, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Scott v. Harris]]'' (550 U.S. 372) that a "police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death."

In most [[common law]] jurisdictions, the [[fireman's rule]] prevents police officers injured in such pursuits from filing civil lawsuits for monetary damages against the fleeing suspects, because such injuries are supposed to be an inherent risk of the job.  Public outrage at such immunity has resulted in statutory exceptions. One example is [[California Civil Code]] Section 1714.9 (enacted 1982), which reinstates liability where the suspect knew or should have known that the police were present.

Policy on what circumstances justify a high-speed pursuit differ by jurisdiction. Some safety advocates want to restrict risky chases to violent felonies.<ref name="npr" /> Another option is to use technology to end or avoid the need for such chases.  For example, vehicles can be tracked by aircraft or GPS tagging device like [[StarChase]], allowing police agencies to reliably intercept suspects using stationary blockades, lower-speed vehicles, or when the vehicle is parked.

===Inter-jurisdictional pursuits and policy issues===
One particular hazard that is attendant to police pursuits is the problem of multiple law enforcement agencies becoming involved in a car chase that crosses municipal and jurisdictional boundaries. This is often complicated by radio communication incompatibility and policy differences in the various departments involved in a pursuit.

The city of [[Dallas, Texas]] was the first major city in the United States to adopt an "Inter-Jurisdictional Pursuit Policy" to address the problems inherent in car chases that involved more than one law enforcement agency. In August 1984, the Dallas Police Department's Planning and Research Division, under the command of Captain Rick Stone, began crafting a policy that more than twenty (20) local law enforcement agencies could agree to abide by when car chases crossed their borders. The result was a model policy that became the standard for use by police departments around the United States.<ref>"Dallas-area police departments establish policy on pursuits", Dallas Morning News, September 8, 1985.</ref>

In Europe, as many national borders [[Schengen Area|no longer have border stations]], car chases may sometimes cross national boundaries. States often have agreements in place where the police of one state can continue the chase across the national boundary.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== In film and television ==
In [[film]] and [[television]], the term "car chase" refers to a "chase scene" involving one or more automobiles pursuing one another; the chase may or may not involve a police car. Car chases are a staple of the [[action movie]] genre, and feature-length films have been built entirely around car chases, often featuring high-powered, [[supercar|exotic vehicles]]. They are popular because they are fast moving scenes that generate a great deal of excitement and action, due to the speed of the vehicles involved, and the potential [[car crash|collisions]] and the [[debris]] resulting from the [[Traffic collision|wreckage]], while not being hugely expensive to [[Staging (theatre, film, television)|stage]].

[[Staging (theatre, film, television)|Staging]] car chase sequences often requires numerous takes and destruction of several vehicles (whether intentional or mishap), giving an incentive for [[Filmmaking|filmmakers]] to find ways to reduce costs. Hence it is common to use older vehicles that are 1–2 generations behind the current models on the market, since these can be second-hand acquisitions at low cost due to depreciation.  There are some exceptions, if a high-profile vehicle (maybe but not necessarily a [[halo car]]) is used and/or if the vehicle manufacturer pays for [[product placement]] in a film production (serving as a technical adviser, donating vehicles to be used in filming); examples include the [[James Bond in film|James Bond]] and [[Transporter (franchise)|Transporter]] franchises who use current and even concept vehicles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fourtitude.com/news/Audi_News_1/though-bond-still-drives-an-aston-skyfall-includes-audi-a5/ |title=Though Bond Still Drives an Aston, 'SkyFall' Includes Audi Cameos |author=Audi of America |date=14 November 2012 |website=Fourtitude}}</ref>

Although car chases on film were staged as early as the motor vehicle itself — one of the earliest examples being "Runaway Match" directed by [[Alf Collins]] in 1903<ref>{{IMDb name|id=nm0172118|name=Alf Collins}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2018/01/11/watch-the-first-car-chase-scen.html|title=Watch the first car chase scene in a movie|author=David Pescovitz|date=2018-01-11|publisher=Boing Boing}}</ref> — the consensus among historians and film critics is that the first modern car chase movie was 1968's ''[[Bullitt]]''.<ref>John Alfred Heitmann, ''The Automobile And American Life'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, 2009), 182–183.</ref><ref>Jesse Crosse, ''The Greatest Movie Car Chases of All Time'' (St. Paul: MBI Publishing, 2006), 16.</ref><ref>[[Todd Gitlin]], ''Media Unlimited: How The Torrent of Images and Sounds Overwhelms Our Lives'' (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 2002), 90.</ref><ref>William Krause, ''Hollywood TV and Movie Cars'' (St. Paul: MBI Publishing, 2001), 39.</ref> The revolutionary 10-minute-long chase scene in ''Bullitt'' was far longer and far faster than what had gone before, and placed cameras so that the audience felt as though they were inside the cars. Even during the most calamitous scenes, the star – [[Steve McQueen]] – could be clearly seen at the wheel of the vehicle. Previously, car chase scenes were often staged using the [[rear projection effect]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTbkAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA69|title=B Is for Bad Cinema: Aesthetics, Politics, and Cultural Value|author=edited by Claire Perkins & Constantine Verevis|year=2014|publisher=SUNY Press|page=69|isbn=9781438449975}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTJnDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA84|title=Hollywood in San Francisco: Location Shooting and the Aesthetics of Urban Decline|author=Joshua Gleich|year=2018|publisher=University of Texas Press|page=84|isbn=9781477317556}}</ref>

''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' further increased the realism. While previous chases had obviously been filmed on closed roads, isolated highways, or Sunday mornings (including ''Bullitt''), ''The French Connection'' placed the chase in the midst of busy New York traffic and pedestrians. The producer of both ''Bullitt'' and ''The French Connection'', [[Philip D'Antoni]], went on to direct ''[[The Seven-Ups]]'' with yet another trademark chase sequence through New York featuring [[Roy Scheider]] from ''The French Connection'' as well as [[Bill Hickman]], one of the drivers who had previously appeared in ''Bullitt''.

As time went on, so did the expectations of the movie car chase. Since ''Bullitt'', car chases featured in movies have become more advanced and arguably more entertaining. [[Car accident|Car crashes]] have also formed an increasingly important role, with the destruction of any vehicle often coming as a delight to the viewer. An early example of a staged but startling accident in a movie chase can be found in the 1974 movie ''[[McQ]]'', which featured an incredible rollover, the first cannon rollover in fact, across a beach. The spectacle came at a cost, however, for [[stuntman|stunt driver]] [[Hal Needham]], who sustained multiple injuries after setting the [[explosives]] too high.

Eventually this resulted in movies which are not much more than a series of linked car chases, such as the 1974 film ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (1974 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'', which culminated in a 40-minute car chase scene with multiple crashes (some of them unplanned, real accidents) and a 30-foot-high, 128-feet-long airborne jump over crashed cars that block a road.

Arguably the most typical car chase is one in which a car is being pursued by [[police car]]s. In part because car chases are so common many movie makers try to introduce a new twists to them. One of the most famous variations is from ''The French Connection'' and involves a car chasing an elevated train. Chases involving buses, trucks, snowmobiles, trains, tanks, and virtually every other type of vehicle (with or without wheels) have appeared at some point.

Car chases can also be played for laughs. Films such as [[The Blues Brothers (film)|''The Blues Brothers'']], ''[[The Keystone Kops]]'', [[W.C. Fields]] comedies, ''[[The Three Stooges]]'', ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', ''[[No Deposit, No Return]]'', ''[[Freaky Friday (1976 film)|Freaky Friday]]'', ''[[The Gnome Mobile]]'', ''[[The Million Dollar Duck]]'', ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'', and many others have car chases that are used for comedy.

Probably the most complex type of car chase involves going the wrong way at high speed against moderately congested [[freeway]] [[traffic]], most notably in ''[[To Live and Die in L.A. (film)|To Live and Die in L.A.]]'' and ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'' which, by no small coincidence, were directed by [[William Friedkin]] (''The French Connection'') and [[John Frankenheimer]] (''French Connection II''), respectively.

Several films that feature complex large-scale chases involving a lot of vehicles in the pursuit include ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', ''[[The Transporter]]'', ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'','' [[Mad Max 2|The Road Warrior]]'', and [[The Fast and the Furious (franchise)|''The Fast and the Furious'' series]]. Another method of escalating a car chase scene is to have a [[Fictional character|character]] move from one vehicle to another and to fight in or on top of a moving vehicle as the [[The Wachowskis|Wachowskis]] employed very effectively in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''.

A number of television shows have been built around the popularity of car chases, such as ''[[CHiPs]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Airwolf]]'', and most recently, ''[[Chase (2010 TV series)|Chase]]''.

In more modern times, the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] is becoming increasingly popular, and, although costly, eliminates any danger level. While impressive at times, it is often argued that it eliminates the [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] of the chase scene, which can then in turn damage the established thrill factor. Recent examples of this computer-generated imagery can be found in the [[Michael Bay]] films ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' and ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]''. ''[[Driven (2001 film)|Driven]]'' was particularly panned for its CGI car chase sequences. Such criticism has affected recent Hollywood productions; for example, films like ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'', ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'', ''[[The Kingdom (film)|The Kingdom]]'', and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' all had actual live-action chases with minimal use of CGI, if at all.

In the action comedy film ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'', the scene in which Sergeant Angel chases the speeding car has been declared the shortest car chase in film history. The brevity of the scene, as acknowledged in interviews, was itself the joke.

==In video games==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2020}}
Many [[Video game|video games]], often within the [[open world]] and [[Racing video game|racing]] genres, tend to contain, if not focus on, car chases of some sort, usually involving police. Many of these chases are often heavily stylized, with police often ramming or even shooting suspect vehicles.

Notable examples of such games include:

*Early examples included [[Bally Midway]]'s ''[[Spy Hunter]]'' (1983), featuring a [[James Bond]]-style weaponized vehicle; and [[Atari Games]]' ''[[APB (1987 video game)|APB]]'' (1987), where the player controlled a police car.
*''[[Chase H.Q.]]'' (1988) and its sequels have the player assume the role of a police officer who, along with his partner, must stop fleeing criminals in high-speed pursuits.
*The [[Need for Speed|''Need for Speed'' series]] is notable for its depiction of police pursuits, usually involving high-performance cars driven by both criminals and police.
*Some games in the [[Burnout (series)|''Burnout'' series]] contain modes which depict pursuits. However, police pursuits are generally not depicted in ''Burnout''.
*The [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] is especially famous for its depiction of car chases in both missions and its open world, with reckless pursuits by both criminals and police being possible in almost every game in the series.
*''[[L.A. Noire]]'' (2011) features police pursuits in several of its cases and missions, though unlike ''Grand Theft Auto'', players control the pursuing police in ''L.A. Noire''.
*The [[Driver (series)|''Driver'' series]], with the exception of ''[[Driver: Parallel Lines|Parallel Lines]]'', have featured a "Film Director" mode which allows players to create their own car chases by setting up cameras and the like in a [[post-production]] style movie suite. Police pursuits are also possible in most games in the ''Driver'' series.
*The ''[[Sim City 4: Rush Hour]]'' (2003) expansion pack contains police pursuit missions in its ''U-Drive-It'' feature.
*In certain [[Roblox]] games, there is the ability to get in another players’ vehicle and could be a depiction of a vehicle theft.
