A '''bedtime story''' is a traditional form of [[storytelling]], where a  [[Narrative|story]] is told to a [[child]] at [[bedtime]] to prepare the child for [[sleep]]. The bedtime story has long been considered "a definite institution in many families".<ref name=institution>Dickson, Marguerite Stockman (1919). ''Vocational Guidance for Girls''. p. 90â€“93.</ref>

Reading bedtime stories yields multiple benefits for parents and children alike. The fixed routine of a bedtime story before sleeping can improve the child's brain development, language mastery, and logical thinking skills.<ref name=parents>Jones, Patti (2011). [http://www.parents.com/fun/entertainment/books/the-brainy-benefits-of-bedtime-stories/ "The Brainy Benefits of Bedtime Stories"]. ''Parents Magazine''.</ref> The storyteller-listener relationship creates an emotional bond between the parent and the child.<ref name=parents/> Due to "the strength of the imitative instinct" of a child, the parent and the stories that they tell act as a model for the child to follow.<ref name=institution/>

Bedtime stories are also useful for teaching the child abstract virtues such as [[sympathy]], [[Altruism|selflessness]], and [[self-control]], as most children are said to be "naturally sympathetic when they have experienced or can imagine the feelings of others".<ref name=institution/> Thus, bedtime stories can be used to discuss darker subjects such as [[death]] and [[racism]].<ref name=parents/> As the bedtime stories broaden in theme, the child "will broaden in their conception of the lives and feelings of others".<ref name=institution/>

Adult versions in the form of audio books help adults fall asleep without finishing the story.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Purdon |first1=Nick |last2=Palleja |first2=Leonardo |title=Canada's top 'sleep writer' reveals how he puts you under (can you stay awake?) |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/national-sleep-stories-chris-advansun-1.4929841 |accessdate=1 February 2019 |work=[[CBC News]] |date=27 January 2019}}</ref>
