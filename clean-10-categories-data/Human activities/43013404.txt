'''''Abzû'''''{{efn|The title is stylized as '''''ABZÛ''''', and translated by the developers as ''Ocean of Wisdom''.<ref name="ABZUwebsite"/>}} is an [[adventure game|adventure video game]] developed by [[Giant Squid Studios]] and published by [[505 Games]] for [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. Initially released as a digital title in August 2016, a retail version for consoles was released in January 2017. Following the journey of a diver exploring the ocean and restoring life using sonar calls, the gameplay allows the player to freely navigate underwater environments ranging from open water and natural caverns to ancient ruins.

Development lasted three years, involving a team of thirteen people. Several members, including director Matt Nava and composer [[Austin Wintory]], had previously worked on the 2012 video game ''[[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]]''—the ocean setting of ''Abzû'' was both a reaction to the desert setting of ''Journey'' and inspired by Nava's love of scuba diving. The setting and story drew from [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian mythology]] and the [[cosmic ocean]] myth. Reaching high positions in sales charts, ''Abzû'' was praised by journalists: the majority of praise went to its art style, with some critics comparing it to ''Journey''.

==Gameplay==

==Synopsis==
The narrative of ''Abzû'' is told wordlessly through gameplay and using cutscenes, taking place in a vast ocean.<ref name="PCGNinterview"/> The player character, referred to as a female diver,{{efn|The diver is referred to as female in the developer diary.<ref name="ABZUdev"/>}} awakens floating in the ocean and begins exploring the surrounding sea: ruins and ancient murals show that an ancient civilization which shared a symbiotic connection with the ocean. As she explores, she is led by a [[great white shark]] to wells that—when activated using an energy from within her—restore life to the local seas. That energy is being forcefully harvested by pyramid-like devices, the development of which disrupted the ocean's balance and brought about the civilization's downfall. Upon reaching the original pyramid, the diver sees the great white shark attacking it, and the pyramid's counterattack damages the diver—revealing her to be mechanical and confirming her existence as a being connected to the pyramid and capable of restoring life to the ocean—and mortally wounds the great white shark, which dies as the diver comforts it. After activating the final well, the great white shark manifests and guides the repaired diver back to the original pyramid which the diver destroys, returning life to the ocean. During the credits, the diver and great white shark swim together through the revitalized ocean.<ref name="CraveStory"/>

==Development==
The origins of ''Abzû'' lay in the development of ''[[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]]'', an independent video game developed by [[Thatgamecompany]] and released in 2012. ''Abzû''{{'}}s creator, director and art director Matt Nava had previously worked as art director for ''Journey'' during its three-year development. Having worked in a game featuring a desert setting, Nava wanted to change to a more vibrant and populated setting for his next title.<ref name="80lvInterview"/> Nava began creating the pitch for ''Abzû'' before leaving Thatgamecompany and founding the game's developer Giant Squid Studios. One of the main elements Nava incorporated was his love for ancient cultures and their artwork, particularly relating to the myths surrounding the concept of [[Abzu]]. Nava's love of the ocean, which he explored through his hobby of scuba diving, also figured heavily in the design of ''Abzû''.<ref name="VerseInterview"/> The team at Giant Squid Studios grew to ten developers from across the industry, mainly programmers who specialized in multiple aspects of game design from gameplay to graphics, in addition to a graphical and technical artist who helped create and animate the character models.<ref name="80lvInterview"/> The game was first announced at the 2014 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3).<ref name="AbzuAnnounced"/> It was later previewed at E3 2016.<ref name="Abzu2016"/> The game's initial digital release was on [[PlayStation 4]] via [[PlayStation Network]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] through [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on August 2, 2016.<ref name="AbzuRelease"/> Later it was also released digitally on [[Xbox One]] through [[Xbox Live]] on December 6, 2016<ref name="AbzuXbox"/> and on [[Nintendo Switch]] through the [[Nintendo eShop]] on November 29, 2018. It was released in Japan on February 27, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ec.nintendo.com/JP/ja/titles/70010000021659|title=ABZÛ (アブズ)|website=Nintendo Japan|accessdate=February 29, 2020}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://gearnuke.com/abzu-nintendo-switch-release-date/|title=Abzu Announced For Nintendo Switch, Out On November 29|last=Imtiaz|first=Khurram|date=2018-11-13|website=GearNuke|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref> The game also received a physical release for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on January 31, 2017.<ref name="AbzuPhysical1"/><ref name="AbzuPhysical2"/> All versions were published by [[505 Games]].<ref name="AbzuRelease"/><ref name="AbzuXbox"/><ref name=":0" /><ref name="AbzuPhysical1"/>

===Design===
The game's title stems from [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian mythology]], particularly the myth of the ocean goddess [[Tiamat]] and the fresh water god [[Abzu]] uniting to form all life: a reason this was chosen was that myths surrounding land-based life and their supposed origins in a [[cosmic ocean]] were a recurring theme in multiple world mythologies.<ref name="VerseInterview"/> The title is made up of the words "Ab" (water) and "Zû" (to know), translated by the developers as "''Ocean of Wisdom''".<ref name="ABZUwebsite"/> The word provided difficulties early on, as the Sumerian spelling "Abzu" differed from the Akkadian spelling "Apsû". As a compromise, the team merged the two spellings into the game's title. The [[circumflex]] over the letter "u" caused problems for the team as hardly anyone knew how to type it and the computer programs had trouble handling it as part of the coding. The use of the word played into the game's focus on the ocean due to its mythic connections. The Middle Eastern influences extended to the game's architecture, and incorporated Nava's wish for structures to have meaning beyond being simple scenery or tools for player progression.<ref name="VerseInterview"/>

The aim from an early stage was not to simulate diving, but instead to capture the dream-like feeling of ocean exploration.<ref name="ABZUdev"/> As part of his research, Nava experimented with other ocean simulation games and found they were not "fun".<ref name="VentureInterview"/> By removing any time limit or air gauge, the team sought to promote a relaxing sense of exploration.<ref name="PCGNinterview"/> One of the main issues was giving the player complete freedom to swim around, including doing a full loop—this effect was normally held back due to camera difficulties, but Giant Squid managed to resolve the issue and allow for greater range of movement.<ref name="80lvInterview"/> The meditation mechanic was added during later development from 2015 to 2016 as a means of allowing players a view of the surrounding marine life and environment.<ref name="VentureInterview"/> When choosing their [[game engine]], Matt Nava was still the only staff member and so they needed an easy-to-use platform with tools and technology to create his vision. [[Unreal Engine 4]] was still quite new at this time, but it was chosen after the team had vetted other developer software available at the time. The team were able to use both Unreal Engine 4's advanced developer tools and expand the engine's functionality to incorporate unique elements such as fish shoal behavior, vegetation animation, and underwater lighting.<ref name="80lvInterview"/> Using Unreal Engine 4 allowed engineer Derek Cornish to construct unique systems for underwater lighting effects.<ref name="PCGNinterview"/>

The artistic style was meant to portray a vibrant underwater world, but the team also needed to prevent activity on-screen from overwhelming the player, so a stylized look was chosen to both maintain the game's artistic style and reduce the amount of "visual noise". Environmental editing was a big issue for the team, with much of their early development dedicated to creating editing tools that could do small-scale edits to environments after they had been locked down.<ref name="80lvInterview"/> When creating the environments, Nava drew on his experience developing ''[[Flower (video game)|Flower]]'' for Thatgamecompany, creating sporadically scattered interaction points that triggered with player exploration and triggered new life or new elements within each environment.<ref name="VerseInterview"/> Since there was no dedicated animator, the team needed to use multiple techniques for animating the diver, fish and flexible vegetation: the diver used a [[skeletal animation]] run through a complex state machine, vegetation such as seaweed used rope physics, while fish mainly used mathematical motion in combination with [[morph target animation|morph target]] posing to remove the need of individual skeletal structures.<ref name="80lvInterview"/>

The types of fish seen in ''Abzû'' were based on real-life creatures from the oceans of Earth, and to fit them into the game each species was distilled down to its most distinctive traits.<ref name="80lvInterview"/> The team had "tens of thousands" of fish within the game.<ref name="VerseInterview"/> Their swimming styles were directly modeled on the behavior and physics of real fish movements.<ref name="ABZUdev"/> The number of fish presented problems with running the game, but the programming staff developed a method of simplifying each fish's animation without compromising the game's visuals, which "multiplied the number of fish possible on screens by 10". Each fish species had its own unique [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] that had cascading levels of awareness and interaction with other species and objects in the environment. The team started with getting the fish to swim without clipping through walls, then built upon that with further expansion on fish behavior and interaction. Their most challenging task was creating realistic [[bait ball]]ing effects for shoals of small fish, which was only achieved and finalized near the end of development. The developers did take liberties by grouping together types of fish from different parts of the globe which would normally not be able to interact, though this fell in line with the game's overall theme and the myths it referenced. Despite this, the developers emulated the zones that each fish would be found in, whether it be a coral reef or the deep ocean where sunlight does not reach.<ref name="VerseInterview"/> The amount of work and the team's dedication to creating a realistic and vibrant experience meant they were creating fish until development finished.<ref name="80lvInterview"/>

===Music===
The soundtrack for ''Abzû'' was composed, conducted, and produced by [[Austin Wintory]], who had previously worked on ''Journey'' and ''[[The Banner Saga]]''.<ref name="80lvInterview"/> Wintory was first shown concept art for the project by Nava before Giant Squid Studios was founded and development began. When the studio was founded, Wintory was invited on board the project.<ref name="VGMOwintory"/> The music was written from the start to be interactive and dynamic rather than based on specific cues. To achieve this, Wintory had to play the game extensively and repeatedly to get a sense for what players would experience and what would best match the mood.<ref name="DGTwintory"/> Similar to Wintory's work on ''Journey'', the first track written was the main theme "To Know, Water" and further tracks were created over the game's three year development based on that theme.<ref name="VGMOwintory"/>

The score's instrumental element began with using a harp as its base, with a choir being used later. More instrumentation was needed, with a full orchestra eventually being incorporated. As with his work on ''Journey'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'', he used a soloist alongside an ensemble orchestra: in this case, the solo instrument was an oboe.<ref name="DGTwintory"/> The oboe solos were performed by Kristin Naigus, whom Wintory had heard performing a cover of a track from ''Journey'' on [[YouTube]].<ref name="VGMOwintory"/><ref name="DGTwintory"/> Wintory worked closely with ''Abzû''{{'}}s sound designer Steve Green created a music-based story that flowed alongside and worked with the visual narrative of ''Abzû''.<ref name="PCGNinterview"/>

The official soundtrack was released as a digital album through [[Bandcamp]] and [[iTunes]] on August 2, 2016.<ref name="VGMOwintory"/><ref name="AbzuPhysical1"/> A physical edition was released on October 22 through [[Varèse Sarabande]].<ref name="OSTrelease"/> Music reviewers were generally positive about the soundtrack album.<ref name="OSVreview"/><ref name="VGMOreview"/> The soundtrack later won the 2017 Game Audio Network Guild's "Best Original Soundtrack Album" award.<ref name="GANG"/> The soundtrack was also nominated at the 2017 [[British Academy Games Awards|BAFTA Games Awards]] in the "Music" category, but lost to ''[[Virginia (video game)|Virginia]]''.<ref name="AbzuBafta"/> For his work on ''Abzû'', Wintory won the 2016 [[International Film Music Critics Association]] award for "Best Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media", making his second win in a row.<ref name="IFMCAabzu"/> The score was also nominated at the [[Hollywood Music in Media Awards]] in the "Original Score – Video Game" category.<ref name="HMMAabzu"/> Reviewers of the game also gave unanimous praise to the soundtrack, positively comparing it to that of ''Journey''.<ref name="PolyReview"/><ref name="GIreview"/><ref name="DesReview"/><ref name="IGNreview"/><ref name="PCGreview"/>
