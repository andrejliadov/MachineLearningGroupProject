Most often it includes content intended to teach but has incidental entertainment value. It has been used by academia, corporations, governments, and other entities in various countries to disseminate information in classrooms and/or via television, radio, and other media to influence viewers' opinions and behaviors.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rapeepisarn |first1=K. |last2=Wong |first2=K.

== History ==

===Concept===
Interest in combining education with entertainment, especially in order to make learning more enjoyable, has existed for hundreds of years, with the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] being movements in which this combination was presented to students.<ref name=":0">{{Cite conference|title=Edutainment or Education: Education Possibilities of Didactic Games in Science Education|date=September 2007|location=Brno, Czech Republic|url=http://www.iccp-play.org/documents/brno/nemec_trna.pdf|access-date=12 April 2017|editor=Němec, J.|pages=55–64|conference=ICCP Brno Conference|last1=Trna|first1=Josef|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817210858/http://www.iccp-play.org/documents/brno/nemec_trna.pdf|archive-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> [[John Amos Comenius|Komenský]] in particular is affiliated with the “school as play” concept, which proposes [[pedagogy]] with dramatic or delightful elements.<ref name=":0" />

Later development of the concept of edutainment can be tied to [[Walt Disney]], with his first educational short film, [[Tommy Tucker's Tooth|''Tommy Tucker’s Tooth'']], being commissioned and shot in 1922 for the Deneer Dental Institute.<ref>Miller, Diane Disney (1957).

Modern forms of edutainment include television productions, film, museum exhibits, and computer software which use entertainment to attract and maintain an audience, while incorporating deliberate educational content or messages. It is also apparent that educational elements are becoming implemented into traditionally recreational realms, such as vacations and games.<ref name=":1" />

=== Terminology ===
The term edutainment was used as early as 1954 by [[Walt Disney]] to describe the ''[[True Life Adventures]]'' series.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DISNEY|first=WALT|date=1954-01-01|jstor=42922993|journal=Educational Horizons|volume=33|issue=2|pages=82–84|title=Educational Values in Factual Nature Pictures}}</ref> The [[noun]] ''edutainment'' is a [[Neologism|neologistic]] [[portmanteau]] used by Robert Heyman in 1973 while producing documentaries for the [[National Geographic Society]].<ref>Marta Rey-López et al. A Model for Personalized Learning. In: Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems. Springer. Berlin. 2006.</ref> It was used by Dr. Chris Daniels in 1975 to encapsulate the theme of his Millennium Project. This project later became known as The Elysian World Project.<ref name="elysianworld2">{{cite web|url=http://www.elysianworld.com|title=Elysian World|publisher=elysianworld.com|access-date=November 6, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217052758/http://elysianworld.com/|archive-date=December 17, 2014}}</ref> The terms “edutainment” (and “busitainment”) were used in 2001 to explain how the CRUMPET project, on context-aware and personalised Tourism, refers to people travelling for adventure yet who also travel for education and business and who do not perceive themselves as classical “tourists”.<ref>{{cite conference|last1=Poslad|first1=Stefan|last2=Laamanen|first2=Heimo|last3=Malaka|display-authors=etal|first3=Rainer|year=2001|title=CRUMPET: Creation of User-friendly Mobile services PErsonalised for Tourism.|conference=IEE 3G2001 Conference on Mobile Communication Technologies|pages=28–32}}</ref> The offshoot word "Edutainer" has been used by Craig Sim Webb since before the turn of the millennium to describe an individual who offers edutainment presentations and performances.<ref name="edutainer2">{{cite web|url=http://www.edutainer.ca|title=Inspirational speakers – Professional Inspirational Speaker, Performer, Songwriter & Author|publisher=edutainer.ca|access-date=November 6, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027001013/http://edutainer.ca/|archive-date=October 27, 2014}}</ref>

== Application ==

=== Audio and video ===
''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'', ''[[Wishbone (TV series)|Wishbone]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' are examples of shows that use [[music]] and video to teach topics like math, science, and history. Using music to aid memory dates back to the passing of ancient oral traditions, including the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Much of what edutainment can offer through audio and video especially, is accessible over the internet on platforms such as [[YouTube]], with such channels as ''[[Vsauce]]'', ''[[CGP Grey]]'', ''[[MinutePhysics]]'', ''Meet Arnold, ''[[Veritasium]]'', and ''[[Crash Course (YouTube)|Crash Course]]''.

[[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]] is a band that incorporates audio and footage from the [[British Film Institute]] into their music and performances, and this partnership helps the British Film Institute showcase its material; their album ''[[Inform-Educate-Entertain|Inform—Educate—Entertain]]'', which covers topics such as the climbing of [[Mount Everest]] and [[highway safety]], demonstrates the connection between the concept of edutainment and their music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/archival-delights-public-service-broadcasting|title=The Archival Delights of Public Service Broadcasting|date=2015-02-24|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-04-13|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422133120/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/archival-delights-public-service-broadcasting|archive-date=2017-04-22}}</ref>

=== Film and television ===
{{Main|Educational television}}

Motion pictures with educational content appeared as early as 1943, such as ''[[Private Snafu]]'', and can still be seen in films such as ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''. After [[World War II]], educational entertainment shifted towards television. Television programs can be divided into three main categories: those with primarily educational intentions, those with a high degree of both education and entertainment, and entertainment shows with incidental or occasional educational value.

Mexican TV producer Miguel Sabido pioneered in the 1970s a form of edutainment via [[telenovelas]], "soap operas for social change". The "Sabido  method" has been adopted in many other countries subsequently, including India, Peru, Kenya, and China.<ref>Hanna Rosin, "Life Lessons: How Soap Operas Can Change the World", ''The New Yorker'', June 5, 2006, pp. 40-45.</ref>  In Mexico, the government in the 1970s successfully used a telenovela to promote family planning to curb the country's high birthrate.<ref>Gabriela Soto Laveaga, "'Let's become fewer': Soap operas, contraception, and nationalizing the Mexican family in an overpopulated world." ''Sexuality Research and Social Policy''. September 2007, vol. 4,, no. 3 pp. 19-33.</ref>

The third season of the television show ''MTV Shuga'' was analyzed by researchers and then published online in 2017 in terms of its effects related to its goal of educating African youth about [[Sexual Health|sexual health]] and [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV]], and secondarily, [[Gender based violence|gender-based violence]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/02/23/mtv-shuga-soap-opera-turns-edutainment-into-a-tool-to-fight-hiv-and-gender-based-violence|title=MTV Shuga Soap Opera Turns Edutainment into a Tool to Fight HIV and Gender-Based Violence|date=2017-02-27|work=World Bank|access-date=2017-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422212033/http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/02/23/mtv-shuga-soap-opera-turns-edutainment-into-a-tool-to-fight-hiv-and-gender-based-violence|archive-date=2017-04-22|url-status=live|language=en}}</ref> In the [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]], those in the treatment group who watched the show for six months were “almost twice as likely” to get tested at HIV testing centers; mixed results were found in regards to the show's effects on gender-based violence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/438421467236362785/Entertainment-Edu-workshop-Flyer-6-3-16.pdf|title=EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF MTV SHUGA: CHANGING SOCIAL NORMS AND BEHAVIORS WITH ENTERTAINMENT EDUCATION|last=Banerjee|first=Abhijit|last2=La Ferrara|first2=Eliana|date=2017|website=World Bank|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174725/http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/438421467236362785/Entertainment-Edu-workshop-Flyer-6-3-16.pdf|archive-date=2017-03-15|url-status=live|last3=Orozco|first3=Victor}}</ref>

According to the article "Walt Disney: Master of Laughter and Learning" Walt Disney believed in education through the entertainment of film and television. He is known as the master of communications who brought both entertainment and education into the world in distinctive ways. His creation of mickey mouse and his adventures taught his audience that life is not always so simple, there will be obstacles that will stand in your way. Mickey mouse's is unpolished and imperfect which make him so realistic to his audience. In many of his stories we see him battle and adventure which he overcomes teach a value in life for viewers, keep going in life. Disney achieved and educational characteristic in his work through the picture series of live animals in their natural habitat by which some film techniques added to the drama of the series. This series was one that satisfied Walt Disney the most as it obtained both the qualities of entertainment and education, which was the characteristics of this series.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=1491447|title=Walt Disney: Master of Laughter and Learning|first=Ralph S.|last=Izard|date=12 May 1967|journal=Peabody Journal of Education|volume=45|issue=1|pages=36–41|doi=10.1080/01619566709537484}}</ref>

=== Healthcare ===
Educating the public about health issues is a focus for many stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. In recent years, several initiatives have used educational entertainment principles to highlight specific conditions or wider healthcare issues. Examples include In Memory about dementia,<ref name="HEALTHCARE FEATURE FILMS: IN MEMORY">{{cite web|title=HEALTHCARE FEATURE FILMS: IN MEMORY|url=https://bedrock-health.com/healthcare-feature-films/|website=Bedrock|access-date=3 November 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107022823/https://bedrock-health.com/healthcare-feature-films/|archive-date=7 November 2017}}</ref> Millefeuille about psoriasis<ref name="Millefeuille">{{cite web|title=Millefeuille|url=http://www.millefeuillemovie.com/|website=Millefeuille|publisher=Celgene|access-date=3 November 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030657/http://www.millefeuillemovie.com/|archive-date=7 November 2017}}</ref> and This is Axiom about the challenges facing the UK's National Health Service.<ref name="This is Axiom">{{cite web|title=This is Axiom|url=http://thisisaxiommovie.com/|website=This is Axiom|publisher=Celgene|access-date=3 November 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020639/http://thisisaxiommovie.com/|archive-date=7 November 2017}}</ref>

=== Games ===
{{Main|Educational game}}

Games fulfill a number of educational purposes. Some games may be explicitly designed with education in mind, while others may have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games, including [[board game|board]], [[card game|card]], and video games, may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are designed to teach people about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand an historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play.

According to Paraskeva (2010), at least 68% of American households play video games. Many recent research articles postulate education and gaming can be joined to provide academic benefits.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Paraskeva | first1 = F. | last2 = Mysirlaki | first2 = S. | last3 = Papgianni | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Multiplayer online games as educational tools: Facing new challenges in learning | journal = Computers and Education | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 498–505 | doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.001}}</ref>

According to Van Eck (2006), there are three reasons why games are considered learning tools: 1. Ongoing research that has included the last 20 years of educational findings have proven that digital games can be educational; 2. The new generation of today wants "multiple streams of information" (p.&nbsp;1), which includes quick and frequent interaction that allows inductive reasoning; and 3. The mere popularity of games has created a billion-dollar industry. The idea of playing a game assumes the person is engaging in that activity by choice. The activity should have some value of "fun". This does not mean that the person is engaging in the activity only for leisure pursuits; it can also include the desire to learn a skill, connect with other gamers (social community), and spend time in a chosen activity. The activity needs to remain one of choice for the gamer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Eck|first=R.|year=2006|title=Digital game-based learning: It's not just the digital natives who are restless...|publisher=Educase Review|volume=41|issue=2|pages=1–16|url=http://edergbl.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/47991237/digital%20game%20based%20learning%202006.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229182518/http://edergbl.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/47991237/digital%20game%20based%20learning%202006.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-29}}</ref>

Kim (2008) supports the use of off-the-shelf games with [[Metacognition|meta-cognitive]] strategies to provide an increase in students' cognitive performance.<ref>Kim, B., Park, H., & Baek, Y. (2009)</ref><ref>Computers and Education, 52, 800-810</ref>

=== Radio and podcasts ===

[[Radio]] can serve as an effective vehicle for educational entertainment. The British radio soap opera ''[[The Archers]]'' has for decades been systematically educating its audience on agricultural matters; likewise, the [[Tanzania]]n radio soap opera ''Twende na Wakati'' ("Let's Go With the Times") was written primarily to promote [[family planning]].

Likewise, [[podcast]]s have begun to exemplify the concept of edutainment, with some radio programs also becoming available in this digital format. Not only are there are series with educational elements that are listened to recreationally, but there are also [[Uses of podcasting#Education and academia|podcasts used as an educational tool]]. Lessons based on podcasts have increased in popularity, with [[Teacherspayteachers.com|''TeachersPayTeachers'']] finding that lesson plans relating to podcasts rose in downloads by 21 percent and 650 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively, which corresponded with the release of ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]''.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/|title=Using 'Serial' to Get Students to Read More|last=Godsey|first=Michael|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209125945/https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/|archive-date=2017-02-09}}</ref>

=== Toys ===
{{Main|Educational toy}}

Toys are perhaps the earliest "edutainment" objects a person encounters, as many toys have also an educational aspect beside their [[aesthetic]] appeal. They can teach children literacy, numerical, conceptual or motor skills. Many toys (e.g., a miniature [[piano]]) are simply colorful, scaled-down versions of more complex objects, and thus can base children in skills and benefits associated with the latter. It is up to grown-ups to guide children to the toy's proper use in order to make the most out of it.

Toys are often employed in the context of [[mimicry]] and [[roleplay]] to partially experience personalities or situations not otherwise possible, very akin to [[simulation]] in video games. They can be used as primitive means to nurture an [[instinct]] or a [[character trait]] in children. Often, toys work simultaneously the other way, providing children with the means to ''express'' those things: a doll may be used by a girl to mimic her mother or express [[motherhood]] as much as to explore it.

Even for toys that don't possess explicit educational value, a thoughtful parent or teacher can turn a static [[figurine]], for example, into an object of interest, by pointing out its features or costumes, or referring to its history or science (e.g., a figurine of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] may be a starting point for exploring American history; a [[Santa Claus]] may be used to explore the roots of Christmas; a toy [[astronaut]] to explore science...), which can be done in conjunction with a more-explicitly "edutaining" object, such as a [[picture book]]. Most children are naturally inquisitive (possibly why they sometimes break their toys; simply to know what is inside or how it moves or what produces that sound), and caregivers should not waste this opportunity.

Even ''grown-ups'' can learn through toys about children: what are their [[Aptitude|talents]] or interests; if they are more [[extrovert]] or [[introvert]]; indeed if they dislike toys and prefer social activities or sport, and thus capitalize on the children's abilities and correct what is wrong or lacking.

Some toys are of considerable appeal and benefit to both children and adults, such as [[Lego]] or [[Rubik's Cube]], as their design and implementation can range from the simple to the sophisticated.

=== Hip hop culture ===
The term "edutainment" was first made popular amongst the hip hop community by [[KRS-One]] (a.k.a. The Teacha) thanks to his [[Boogie Down Productions]] [[Edutainment (album)|album by the same name]].

The term has since been borrowed to describe hip hop culture's innate pedagogical aesthetics. Examples of this include how Hip Hop uniquely combines both thought and action (see [[Paulo Freire]]'s use of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] in ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'') and values both Eurocentric values of rational thought and Afrocentric epistemology of kinetic, affective and emotional ways of knowing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives|last=Petchauer|first=Emery|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88971-1|location=New York|pages=72}}</ref> Another example is in the transmission of technical and historical knowledge, the manner in which Hip Hop practitioners learn and exchange by sharing moments of performance together through ''building'' or ''building sessions.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives|last=Petchauer|first=Emery|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88971-1|location=New-York|pages=76–77}}</ref>

=== Corporations ===
The concept of educational entertainment is being used for building learning programs for organizations. High technology is used to make the programs entertaining and educational.<ref>{{Cite book|title=E-Content: Technologies and Perspectives for the European Market|last=Nagy|first=Atilla|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|year=2006|isbn=978-3-540-25093-7|pages=79–96|chapter=The Impact of E-Learning}}</ref> As an example, [[PowerPoint]] presentations may become more entertaining with the addition of flashy animations or graphics. An article in a satirical newspaper, ''[[The Onion]]'', poked fun at the concept of embellishing boring presentations with attention-catching effects.<ref name="Onion2">{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/articles/wow-factor-added-to-corporate-presentation,2766/|title=Wow Factor Added To Corporate Presentation &#124; The Onion – America's Finest News Source|publisher=theonion.com|access-date=November 6, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106232425/http://www.theonion.com/articles/wow-factor-added-to-corporate-presentation,2766/|archive-date=November 6, 2014}}</ref> A fictional marketing executive in the article noted the previous lack of excitement in the presentation, saying "When we first finished the PowerPoint, the content was all there, but it still lacked that certain something."<ref name="Onion2" />

=== Theme parks ===
{{Main|Amusement park#Educational theme parks}}
[[File:Spaceship Earth at EPCOT.jpg|link=[[:File:Spaceship Earth at EPCOT]].jpg|thumb|[[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]], an attraction at [[Epcot]]]]
Theme parks are a specific kind of setting in which the combination of entertaining and educational elements can be prevalent. [[Epcot]] at [[Walt Disney World]], which is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], is highly based on edutainment; the park features attractions that teach about the past, conservation, imagination, future technologies, and the world. The park's dedication plaque, written by [[Marty Sklar]] and Erwin Okun, states the following: “May [[EPCOT Center]] entertain, inform and inspire. And above all, may it instill a new sense of belief and pride in man’s ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dream It! Do It!: My Half-Century Creating Disney's Magic Kingdoms|last=Sklar|first=Marty|publisher=Disney Editions|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4231-7406-6|pages=162}}</ref>

The offerings and promotions at [[SeaWorld]] associated with the educational topics of [[marine biology]], [[Conservation biology|conservation]], and animal rescue efforts are increasing at their current locations and in plans for the upcoming [[SeaWorld Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi theme park]], which is likely due to activism for animal rights.<ref>{{Cite news|title=SeaWorld Shifts to Educational Entertainment, Adds Virtual-Reality Ride; Theme-park moves further away from controversial orca shows|last=Hufford|first=Austen|date=27 September 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal (Online)|publisher=Dow Jones & Company Inc}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=SeaWorld writes a new chapter with first killer whale-free park|last=Lindsay|first=Rowena|date=14 December 2016|work=The Christian Science Monitor|location=Boston, Mass.|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>

Other notable theme parks that incorporate educational elements and topics are [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], [[Holy Land Experience]], [[Dinosaur World (theme parks)|Dinosaur World]], [[Busch Gardens]], and [[Puy du Fou]].

=== Museums and public access areas ===

Edutainment is also a growing [[paradigm]] within the [[Science museum|science center]] and [[children's museum]] community in the United States, as well as in many other locations such as the [[zoo]] or a [[botanical garden]]. Educational locations such as these are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to reach the surrounding public and get them interested in areas such as the fine arts, science, literature, and history. Additionally, [[field trip]] visits to these educational places provide participants with interactional stimulus to learn about the content offered there. Since people are used to flashy, polished entertainment venues like movie theaters and theme parks, they demand similar experiences at science centers or museums. Consequently, interactive experiences, such as games and [[mobile app]]s, are implemented in museums in order to more effectively help people learn about what they are seeing.<ref>{{Cite news|title=ART; TAP AND TOUR; Museums are quietly adapting to the app-happy 'selfie culture'|last=Gelt|first=Jessica|date=25 October 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> Museums are also embracing the ability to use storytelling to engage people, especially those who are young, in hopes to increase attendance; all the while, though, it is possible for the focus and purpose of museums to be diluted.<ref>{{Cite news|title=ARENA --- The Museum of The Future --- From 3-D headsets to holograms, new technologies are revolutionizing exhibits; is it entertainment or education?|last=Gamerman|first=Ellen|date=16 October 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|location=New York, N.Y.|edition= Eastern|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> Thus, a museum or a zoo can be seen as just another business competing for entertainment dollars from the public, rather than as an institution that serves the public welfare through education or historical preservation.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/hightechhereticw00stol/page/485|title=High Tech Heretic|last=Stoll|first=Clifford|publisher=Doubleday|year=1999|isbn=978-0-385-48975-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/hightechhereticw00stol/page/485 485–499]|url-access=registration}}</ref>

== Effects in the classroom ==
{{Main|Entertainment in education}}Much research has been done in association with edutainment and its effectiveness in its various forms. Particularly, the effects of the implementation of the concept of edutainment in the classroom setting have been studied on multiple occasions. The concept of [[flipped classroom]]s, in association with edutainment, was studied by Retta Guy and Gerald Marquis (2016), in which students were assigned [[video lesson]]s and podcasts as opposed to projects prior to class; it was found that these students outperformed those in traditional classrooms, found the actual time in class to prompt more interaction, and thought the class to be more enjoyable, although there was a noticeable period of adaption.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guy|first=Retta|last2=Marquis|first2=Gerald|date=2016|title=The Flipped Classroom: A Comparison of Student Performance Using Instructional Videos and Podcasts Versus the Lecture-Based Model of Instruction|journal= Issues in Informing Science and Information Technology|volume= 13|pages= 001–013|issn=1547-5840|doi=10.28945/3461|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In a study conducted by Ruby Lynch-Arroyo and Joyce Asing-Cashman (2016), ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', which is an example of edutainment in the form of a television show, was integrated into the education of [[Pre-service teacher education|preservice]] mathematics teachers. The subsequent results exemplified the potential for edutainment to promote [[critical thinking]], increased engagement, and [[growth mindset]]s.<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last=Lynch-Arroyo|first=Ruby|last2=Asing-Cashman|first2=Joyce|date=2016|title=Using Edutainment to Facilitate Mathematical Thinking and Learning: An Exploratory Study|url=http://educationforatoz.com/images/2016_Research_3.pdf|journal=Journal of Mathematics Education|volume=9|pages= 37–52|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817203754/http://educationforatoz.com/images/2016_Research_3.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-17}}</ref>

Similarly, Craig D. Cox, ''et al''. (2017) conducted a study in which a mini-series that combined educational and entertaining elements was developed and presented to pharmacy [[preceptor]]s; it was effective in increasing the confidence of the participants and was an honorable mention for the [[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy]] Innovations in Teaching Award in 2015.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Craig D.|last2=Cheon|first2=Jongpil|last3=Crooks|first3=Steven M.|last4=Lee|first4=Jaehoon|date=2017|title=Use of Entertainment Elements in an Online Video Mini-Series to Train Pharmacy Preceptors|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|volume= 81|issue=1|pages= 1–13|issn=0002-9459}}</ref>

A system that incorporated the concept of edutainment through the use of games has also been studied in association with [[Disability|disabled]] students by Amal Dandashi, ''et al''. (2015), and it was found that the system had a positive impact in terms of scores, coordination, communication, and memorization skills; after replaying, higher scores were often achieved as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dandashi|first=Amal|last2=Karkar|first2=Abdel Ghani|last3=Saad|first3=Sawsan|last4=Barhoumi|first4=Zaara|last5=Al-Jaam|first5=Jihad|last6=Saddik|first6=Abdulmotaleb El|date=2015-01-01|title=Enhancing the Cognitive and Learning Skills of Children with Intellectual Disability through Physical Activity and Edutainment Games|journal=International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|doi=10.1155/2015/165165|page=165165|doi-access=free}}</ref>

As for podcasts and narration specifically, according to a study conducted by Trish L. Varao Sousa, Jonathan S. A. Carriere, and Daniel Smilek (2013) with student participants, these forms may not be particularly helpful, as their use can result in both less information actually internalized and less engagement overall when compared to other "reading encounters."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Varao Sousa|first=Trish L.|last2=Carriere|first2=Jonathan S. A.|last3=Smilek|first3=Daniel|date=2013-01-01|title=The way we encounter reading material influences how frequently we mind wander|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=en|volume=4|page=892|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00892|issn=1664-1078|pmid=24348444|pmc=3842750}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
Debate regarding the value of educational entertainment and its implementation has been had for decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/thats-edutainment/305126/|title=That's Edutainment|last=Rozen|first=Joel|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323160117/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/thats-edutainment/305126/|archive-date=2016-03-23}}</ref> The negative feedback received by Walt Disney for his ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'' series represents the views of some skeptics of the concept of edutainment. For example, the use of music along with the footage of animals, such as the circumstance in which "The courtship of tarantulas was set to a tango, while the movements of two scorpions were showcased with square dance music in the background" was criticized at the time; the purpose of the music was to enhance the footage, but some people took issue with this humanization. Additionally, without approval, some of the film crew of ''[[White Wilderness (film)|White Wilderness]]'' prompted unnatural behavior in lemmings that would be filmed, which then generated a negative response.<ref name=":10">{{Cite news|url=http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-and-true-life-adventures|title=Walt and the True-Life Adventures|last=admin|date=2012-02-09|work=The Walt Disney Family Museum|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419053222/http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-and-true-life-adventures|archive-date=2017-04-19}}</ref>

''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television show that demonstrates the concept of edutainment, has also specifically been subject to criticism. For instance, in an article published in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in May 1971, [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] criticizes the promotion of "Right Answers" in the television show without actual action being taken by the children, and also argues that it is nonsensical and perplexing to have adults convey to children that everything that is to be discovered is logical and easy to understand.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/big-bird-meet-dick-and-jane/305125/|title=Big Bird, Meet Dick and Jane|last=Holt|first=John|date=May 1971|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523172022/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/big-bird-meet-dick-and-jane/305125/|archive-date=2016-05-23|url-status=live|language=en-US}}</ref>

The argument that the concept of edutainment hurts the actual value of education has been prevalent as well. The book entitled ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' by theorist [[Neil Postman]] demonstrates this notion, as it is claimed that areas of study have been “transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business.”<ref>Neil., Postman, (1986-01-01). {{oclc|14271773}} ''Amusing ourselves to death : public discourse in the age of show business''.
