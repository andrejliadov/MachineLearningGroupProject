{{other uses|Arts and Letters (disambiguation)}}
'''Arts and letters''' is a traditional term for the [[fine arts]] and [[literature]] considered together. The category defined as "arts and letters" may also include the [[performing arts]], [[visual arts]], or [[liberal arts]].

==History==
By the late 19th century the term was used to name a few arts-related institutions in the [[United States]]. A [[subscription]]-based Theatre of Arts and Letters opened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1892, but closed within a year.<ref>{{cite journal

The term has also figured in [[higher education]]. For example, by 1889 students at [[Swarthmore College]] were sorted into two categories of study: "Arts and Letters" or "Science and Engineering."<ref>''Twenty-first Annual Catalogue of Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa., 1889–90''. Philadelphia: Press of Friends' Book Association.</ref> Since 2010, course requirements at the University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences have included a "sector" (category) called "Arts and Letters." The college defines the sector as including "visual arts, literature and music, together with the criticism surrounding them."<ref>University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences, ''The College Curriculum''  http://www.college.upenn.edu/curriculum/2010/sectors.php {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120043113/http://www.college.upenn.edu/curriculum/2010/sectors.php |date=2011-11-20 }}, accessed 17 March 2012.</ref>
