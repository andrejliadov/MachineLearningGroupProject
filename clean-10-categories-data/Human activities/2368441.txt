'''Bowhunting''' (or '''bow hunting''') is the practice of hunting [[Game (food)|game animals]] by [[archery]]. Many [[indigenous peoples]] have employed the technique as their primary hunting method for thousands of years, and it has survived into contemporary use for sport and hunting.

==Modern history==
[[File:Saxton Pope and grizzly.jpg|thumb|right|Picture of Pope taken while grizzly hunting at Yellowstone]]
The last of the [[Yahi#Yahi|Yahi Indian]] tribe, a native known as [[Ishi]], came out of hiding in California in 1911.<ref>{{citation|title=The Traditional Bowyer's Bible, Volume 4|last1=Allely|first1=Steve|year=2008|publisher=The Lyons Press|isbn=978-0-9645741-6-8|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Ishi in Two Worlds: a biography of the last wild Indian in North America|last=Kroeber|first=Theodora|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|place=Berkeley|year=2004|isbn=978-0-520-24037-7}}</ref> His doctor, [[Saxton Pope]], learned many of Ishi's traditional archery skills, and popularized them.<ref>{{citation|title=Hunting with the Bow and Arrow|last=Pope|first=Saxton|publisher= G.

Founded as a nonprofit scientific organization, the Club was patterned after the [[Boone and Crockett Club]] and advocated responsible bowhunting by promoting quality, [[fair chase]] hunting, and sound conservation practices. Modern game archery owes much of its success to [[Fred Bear]], an American bow hunter and bow manufacturer.<ref name="Bertalan2007">{{cite book|last=Bertalan|first=Dan|title=Traditional Bowyers Encyclopedia: The Bowhunting and Bowmaking World of the Nation's Top Crafters of Longbows and Recurves|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sYBT1c2NKVoC&pg=PA73|access-date=1 June 2018|year=2007|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=9781602390461|page=73}}</ref>

==Equipment==
[[File:Crossbow Hunting.jpg|thumb|Hunting crossbow]]
[[Arrow]]s, [[bow (weapon)|bows]] and [[sights]] are commonly of the more modern varieties. However, all effective variations, including [[crossbow]]s and [[self bow|wooden bows]] launching wooden arrows with stone points, are used. [[Arrowhead]]s are chosen to ensure lethality. Broadheads feature blades that jut out from the shaft at an angle to cause more damage to the target; some models have retractable blades that only deploy once they hit the target.

Big game hunting requires a draw weight of more than {{convert|35|lb|kg}}. For larger game such as elk or moose, more than {{convert|50|lb|kg}} is suggested. Most male American archers can draw a bow rated at {{convert|50|-|60|lb|kg}}, most women {{convert|30|-|40|lb|kg}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keystone-sports.com/sizing_guide.html |title=Bow Sizing Guide |website=Keystone-sports.com |access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref>

Lighter arrows, all else equal, will give a higher speed and a flatter trajectory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huntersfriend.com/carbon_arrows/hunting_arrows_selection_guide_chapter_5.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=26 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924070848/http://www.huntersfriend.com/carbon_arrows/hunting_arrows_selection_guide_chapter_5.htm |archive-date=24 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Because arrows with mass more than {{convert|900|gr|g|abbr=off|round=5}} carry more [[momentum]], and penetrate better in large animals, bow hunters might choose them when hunting these animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tradgang.com/ashby/Arrow%20Lethality%202.htm |title=Arrow Lethality : Part II Broadheads - The Natal Study |author=Dr. Ed Ashby |website=Tradgang.com |access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref>

==Methods of hunting==
In contrast to a rifle hunter, who may shoot effectively from ranges in excess of {{convert|200|yd|m}}; archers usually restrict shots to {{convert|2.3|to|42|yd|m|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Ashby Reports 1996 Dr. W.E (Ed) Ashby|website=Tradgang.com|url=http://www.tradgang.com/ashby/images/g11.jpg|format=JPG|access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref> The distance depends upon individual ability, the target animal, the bow strength, terrain, arrow and weather. The bow hunter may walk along the ground slowly, looking for game and stalking it carefully in the final approach. This type of slow, methodical stalking, is called "spot and stalk." Hunters often wear [[camouflage]] clothing and walk upwind (with the wind in their face) so that game ahead of them cannot smell them.

In "stand hunting," the hunter waits for game to come to them, usually near food, water, or known trails. Brush and other natural materials may be placed for cover, or a "ground blind" that looks like a camouflage tent may be used.<ref name="Woodrow">{{cite web|url=http://www.trtribune.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7013%3Afoothills-outdoor-journal-ground-blinds-are-worth-considering&catid=71%3Afoothills-outdoor-journal&Itemid=322|title=Ground blinds are worth considering|last=Woodrow|first=Ross|date=September 2013|work=TR Tribune|access-date=1 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928062519/http://www.trtribune.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7013%3Afoothills-outdoor-journal-ground-blinds-are-worth-considering&catid=71%3Afoothills-outdoor-journal&Itemid=322|archive-date=28 September 2013}}</ref> They usually "pop" up and can be set up from folded in a few minutes. The hunter may wait on a wooden or metal stand elevated in a tree, from {{convert|3|to|6|m|yd|spell=in|sp=us|round=0.5}}.

Bowhunting for fish is called [[bowfishing]]. Bowfishing equipment usually adds a line attached to a spool or a reel as well as a specially designed, heavier, barbed arrow. Most bow-fishers do not use sights, but if they do have sights they are different from standard ones to allow for [[refraction]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Jon|url=http://www.hunthd.com/bowfishing/bowfishing-equipment-tips/cat_27.html|title=Bowfishing equipment tips|work=HuntHD.com|access-date=1 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928003236/http://www.hunthd.com/bowfishing/bowfishing-equipment-tips/cat_27.html|archive-date=28 September 2013}}</ref>

==Legal and cultural considerations==
Bowhunting often has different seasons and restrictions from firearm hunting, and they differ significantly between areas. Legal and cultural approaches specific to the area must be taken into consideration by the hunter.

===Europe===
[[File:Bogenjagd in Europa.png|thumb|Legal status of bowhunting in Europe with countries allowing bowhunting in green]]
Nations including Denmark, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Hungary, Finland, Bulgaria and Slovenia use bow and arrow hunting as a hunting tool in modern game management. Some European countries, including the United Kingdom, prohibit bowhunting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (c. 69)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/69/section/11|quote=if any person… uses for the purpose of killing or taking any wild animal ... any bow or cross-bow ... he shall be guilty of an offence.|access-date=6 May 2009}}</ref> Bowhunting, like target archery, was revived in [[United Kingdom|the UK]] during the Victorian era,<ref>Archer's Craft.

=== United States and Canada===
In the United States and Canada, as with other styles of hunting, bowhunting is regulated by individual provinces and states. Regulations often address issues such as which area to hunt in, what time of year (season), and which sex and species of game may be taken. In many cases, a special archery season is set aside, to minimize interference from rifle hunters. While bowhunting can run into rifle hunting seasons, hunter orange is typically required to be worn during the cross over seasons. In addition, in an effort to maximize game recovery and shot lethality, there are often technical regulations, such as a minimum draw weight, minimum width of head, and lack of barbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/8305.html |title=Deer and Bear Hunting Regulations - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation |website=Dec.ny.gov |date=7 November 2014|access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref>

In general most bow hunting for big game begins in late August or early September in northern states and Canadian provinces, and slightly later in southern states.

===New Zealand===
Organized bow hunting began in New Zealand in 1945. The New Zealand government regulates bowhunting.<ref name=NZ_REG>{{cite web|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/parks-and-recreation/hunting/hunting-in-conservation-areas-brochure.pdf|title=DOC Hunting Guide|page=5|access-date=6 May 2009}}</ref> An annual 3 day field shoot tournament is held every Queen's Birthday Weekend at various locations throughout New Zealand. Bowhunters must have permission to hunt on private land, and they cannot hunt in DOC lands, national parks, or any other reserves without a permit. All native species are protected; only introduced species are legal quarry.

There are no special seasons for bowhunters or for hunting with a firearm.<ref name=NZ_DOC>{{cite web|title=Activity Finder - Hunting|author=New Zealand Department of Conservation|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/activity-finder/hunting/|access-date=6 May 2009}}</ref> There is an active bow hunters' society.<ref name=NZ_BS>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzbowhunters.co.nz/index.htm |title=New Zealand Bowhunters Society |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119034446/http://www.nzbowhunters.co.nz/index.htm |archive-date=19 January 2008 }}</ref>

===Australia===
Bowhunting is practiced in Australia and is not specifically subject to regulation by law. Only non-native species are recognized as game by the Australian Bowhunters Association. However, native species may be killed during government-authorized culls.<ref>{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217172413/http://bowhunters.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=99 | archive-date=17 February 2011 | url=http://bowhunters.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=99 | title=More Bowhunting Information | date=13 June 2009 | publisher=Australian Bowhunters Association | access-date=1 June 2018 }}</ref>

The states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]] both regulate bowhunting. In Victoria hunting is regulated through the Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE).<ref name=VIC_DSE>{{cite web|url=http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenrt.nsf/childdocs/-7380F92E35E27D99CA2573750023D375?open |author=Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment |title=Game Hunting in Victoria |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530083524/http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenrt.nsf/childdocs/-7380F92E35E27D99CA2573750023D375?open |archive-date=30 May 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> In New South Wales this is done through the Department of Primary Industry.<ref name=NSW_GC>{{cite web|title=New South Wales Game Council|url=http://www.gamecouncil.nsw.gov.au/|access-date=6 May 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519102639/http://www.gamecouncil.nsw.gov.au/|archive-date=19 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> At the current time there are no specific hunting regulations in other states and territories.<ref name=ABA>{{cite web|title=More Bowhunting Information |author=Australian Bowhunters Association |url=http://www.bowhunters.org.au/phpBB3/bowhunting_info.php |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105194937/http://www.bowhunters.org.au/phpBB3/bowhunting_info.php |archive-date=5 January 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>

In July 2013 the New South Wales Government disbanded the Game Council, and temporarily suspended licensed hunting in NSW State forests.<ref name=NSW_ABO_GC>{{cite web |title=Government abolishes Game Council NSW |url=http://www.ssaa.org.au/notice-board/2013/2013-07-12_government-abolishes-game-council-nsw.html#.Ukj2QdJHK-I |access-date=30 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725004850/http://www.ssaa.org.au/notice-board/2013/2013-07-12_government-abolishes-game-council-nsw.html#.Ukj2QdJHK-I |archive-date=25 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>

While both Victoria and New South Wales place licensing requirements on would-be bowhunters, the sport is self-regulated. The Australian Bowhunters Association and local clubs assess hunters through the Bowhunter Proficiency Certificate (BPC) which is designed to ensure that animals are killed according to humane principles.<ref name=BPC>{{cite web|title=Bowhunting in Australia |author=Australian Bowhunters Association |url=http://www.bowhunters.org.au/phpBB3/bowhunting_aus.php |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105193933/http://www.bowhunters.org.au/phpBB3/bowhunting_aus.php |archive-date=5 January 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Zimbabwe===
Zimbabwe has legally permitted hunting with compound bows since 1989 as an exception, and since 1999 under formal legislation. Minimum arrow weights and bow draws are mandated. Bowhunting is only allowed on private or tribal lands, but not in national parks. Bowhunters must be accompanied by licensed guides or professional hunters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gothunts.com/bowhunting-in-zimbabwe/ |title=Bowhunting in Zimbabwe |website=Gothunts.com |access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref> Bowhunting of elephants is mostly conducted in Zimbabwe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bowhuntingsafari.com/Zimbabwe.html |title=Bowhunting in Zimbabwe |website=Bowhuntingsafari.com |access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref> Following international outrage over the illegal hunt for [[Cecil (lion)|Cecil]], the lion, in 2015 the Parks and Wildlife Management Authority banned all bowhunting unless specifically authorized, as well as other hunting restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Merritt Clifton |url=http://www.animals24-7.org/2015/08/02/death-of-cecil-zimbabwe-parks-wildlife-responds/ |title=Death of Cecil: Zimbabwe Parks & Wildlife responds – Animals 24-7 |website=Animals24-7.org |access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref>

==Opposition==
Some are deeply opposed to bow hunting in particular, on the grounds of cruelty. The organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] states that "quick kills are rare, and many animals suffer prolonged, painful deaths when hunters severely injure but fail to kill them."<ref>{{cite web |publisher=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals |quote=A member of the Maine Bow Hunters Alliance estimates that 50 percent of animals who are shot with crossbows are wounded but not killed. A study of 80 radio-collared white-tailed deer found that of the 22 deer who had been shot with "traditional archery equipment," 11 were wounded but not recovered by hunters. |author=Stephen S.

===Wounding rates===
A study conducted by the [[Oklahoma]] Fish and Wildlife Agencies found that approximately 50% of deer that were shot were never recovered, noting that this rate was similar to data from other studies. Some deer survived for up to 5–7 days before succumbing to their wounds. "71% to 82% of all shots taken" miss the target<ref>{{cite web|quotation="Researchers in Wisconsin".

In another study from [[Maryland]], archers who had passed a pre-season accuracy test claimed that 82% of deer hit were recovered within 24 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=2008 Proc. Annu. Conf.

Danish licensed bowhunters are required to complete a report every time that they kill a [[roe deer]]. (To become a licensed bowhunter in [[Denmark]] it is necessary to pass a very demanding proficiency test, including a test of accuracy in which five of six arrows must hit within the vital area of game targets ranging from roe deer to pheasant in size at unknown distances up to {{convert|25|m|yd|sp=us}}. Only 2% of Danish bowhunters use traditional equipment.) For 1999–2004, these reports showed that 576 arrows were released at roe deer. 92.5% of these shots resulted in a dead roe deer being collected by the hunter, and 2.6% are documented as misses. In 5% of reports the deer was hit and wounded (as indicated by bodily fluids on the ground or on the arrow), but not recovered by the hunter. The European Bowhunters Association states that "this percentage compares favorably with other means of harvesting roe deer in Europe." <ref>{{cite web|author1=Anders Gejer|author2=Richard Cadwalader|publisher=European Bowhunters Association|date=May 2005|title=Evaluation of the Danish Bowhunting Association, the Danish National Forest and Nature Agency's Statistics on Roedeer (Capreolus Capreolus) shot with bow and arrow in Denmark between 1 October 1999 – 15 January 2004|url=http://www.jousimetsastys.fi/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/danish-report-1999-2004.pdf|format=PDF|access-date=29 January 2014}}</ref>
