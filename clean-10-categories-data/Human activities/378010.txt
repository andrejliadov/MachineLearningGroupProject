'''Planning''' is the [[process]] of [[thinking]] about the activities required to achieve a desired [[goal]]. It is the first and foremost activity to achieve desired results. It involves the creation and maintenance of a [[plan]], such as psychological aspects that require conceptual skills. There are even a couple of tests to measure someone’s capability of planning well. As such, planning is a fundamental property of intelligent behavior.  An important further meaning, often just called "planning", is the [[Urban planning|legal context of permitted building developments]].

Also, planning has a specific process and is necessary for multiple occupations (particularly in fields such as [[management]], [[business]], etc.). In each field there are different types of plans that help companies achieve efficiency and effectiveness. An important, albeit often ignored aspect of planning, is the relationship it holds to [[forecasting]]. Forecasting can be described as predicting what the future will look like, whereas planning predicts what the future should look like for multiple scenarios. Planning combines forecasting with [[Preparation (principle)|preparation]] of scenarios and how to react to them. Planning is one of the most important project management and time management techniques. Planning is preparing a sequence of action steps to achieve some specific goal. If a person does it effectively, they can reduce much the necessary time and effort of achieving the goal. A plan is like a map. When following a plan, a person can see how much they have progressed towards their project goal and how far they are from their destination.

=== Psychological aspects ===
[[File:Schizophrenia PET scan.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Striatum]]; part of the [[basal ganglia]]; neural pathways between the striatum and the [[frontal lobe]] have been implicated in planning function.]]
Planning is one of the [[executive function]]s of the brain, encompassing the [[neurological]] processes involved in the formulation, evaluation and selection of a sequence of thoughts and actions to achieve a desired goal.  Various studies utilizing a combination of [[neuropsychological]], neuropharmacological and functional [[neuroimaging]] approaches have suggested there is a positive relationship between impaired planning ability and damage to the [[frontal lobe]].

A specific area within the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex located in the frontal lobe has been implicated as playing an intrinsic role in both [[cognitive planning]] and associated executive traits such as [[working memory]].

Disruption of the [[neural pathway]]s, via various mechanisms such as [[traumatic brain injury]], or the effects of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s between this area of the frontal cortex and the [[basal ganglia]], specifically the [[striatum]] (cortico-striatal pathway), may disrupt the processes required for normal planning function.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Owen | first1 = AM | date = Nov 1997 | title = Cognitive planning in humans: neuropsychological, neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological perspectives | journal = Prog Neurobiol | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 431–50 | pmid = 9421831 | doi=10.1016/s0301-0082(97)00042-7| s2cid = 69523 }}</ref>

===Neuropsychological tests===
[[File:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|thumb|right|Animation of a four disc version of the [[Tower of Hanoi]].|alt=A version of the Tower of Hanoi utilizing four discs.]]
There are a variety of neuropsychological tests which can be used to measure variance of planning ability between the subject and controls.

* [[Tower of Hanoi]] (TOH-R), a puzzle invented in 1883 by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas. There are different variations of the puzzle, the classic version consists of three rods and usually seven to nine  discs of subsequently smaller size. Planning is a key component of the problem solving skills necessary to achieve the objective, which is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:
** Only one disk may be moved at a time.
** Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.
** No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Welsh | first1 = MC | last2 = Huizinga | first2 = M | date = Jun 2001 | title = The development and preliminary validation of the Tower of Hanoi-revised | url = http://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/the-development-and-preliminary-validation-of-the-tower-of-hanoirevised(18534ae6-bff2-407b-ac7c-6b135753cc48).html| journal = Assessment | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 167–76 | pmid = 11428696 | doi=10.1177/107319110100800205| s2cid = 27931772 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = JR | last2 = Albert | first2 = MV | last3 = Fincham | first3 = JM | date = Aug 2005 | title = Tracing problem solving in real time: fMRI analysis of the subject-paced Tower of Hanoi | journal = J Cogn Neurosci | volume = 17 | issue = 8| pages = 1261–74 | doi = 10.1162/0898929055002427 | pmid = 16197682 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.139.8424 | s2cid = 7567982 }}</ref>
[[File:PEBLTowerOfLondon.png|thumb|Screenshot of the PEBL psychology software running the Tower of London test]]

* [[Tower of London test|Tower of London]] (TOL) is another test that was developed in 1992 (Shallice 1992) specifically to detect deficits in planning as may occur with damage to the frontal lobe.  Test participants with damage to the left anterior frontal lobe demonstrated planning deficits (i.e., greater number of moves required for solution).

Test participants with damage to the right anterior, and left or right posterior areas of the frontal lobes showed no impairment. The results implicating the left anterior frontal lobes involvement in solving the TOL were supported in concomitant neuroimaging studies which also showed a reduction in regional [[cerebral blood flow]] to the left pre-frontal lobe. For the number of moves, a significant negative correlation was observed for the left prefrontal area: [[i.e.]] subjects that took more time planning their moves showed greater activation in the left prefrontal area.<ref>{{Cite journal

=== Planning in public policy ===

Public policy planning includes [[environmental planning|environmental]], [[land-use planning|land use]], [[regional planning|regional]], [[urban planning|urban]] and [[spatial planning]]. In many countries, the operation of a town and country planning system is often referred to as "planning" and the professionals which operate the system are known as "[[urban planner|planners]]".

It is a conscious as well as sub-conscious activity. It is "an anticipatory decision making process" that helps in coping with complexities. It is deciding future course of action from amongst alternatives. It is a process that involves making and evaluating each set of interrelated decisions. It is selection of missions, objectives and "translation of knowledge into action." A planned performance brings better results compared to an unplanned one. A manager's job is planning, monitoring and controlling. Planning and goal setting are important traits of an organization. It is done at all levels of the organization. Planning includes the plan, the thought process, action, and implementation. Planning gives more power over the future. Planning is deciding in advance what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and who should do it. This bridges the gap from where the organization is to where it wants to be. The planning function involves establishing goals and arranging them in logical order. A well planned organization achieve faster goals than the ones that don't plan before implementation.

== Planning process ==
[[File:Planning proces.gif|thumb|Example of planning process framework.]]
Patrick Montana and Bruce Charnov outline a three-step result-oriented process for planning:<ref>Barron's Management book fourth edition, Authors: Patrick J. Montana and Bruce H. Charnov</ref> 
# choosing a destination
# evaluating alternative routes
# deciding the specific course of the plan
In organizations, planning can become a management process, concerned with defining goals for a future direction and determining on the missions and resources to achieve those targets. To meet the goals, managers may develop plans such as a [[business plan]] or a [[marketing plan]]. Planning always has a purpose. The purpose may involve the achievement of certain goals or targets.

Major characteristics of planning in organizations include:

* Planning increases the efficiency of an organization.
* Planning reduces risks.
* Planning utilizes with maximum efficiency the available time and resources

The concept of planning in [[organization]]s involves identifying what an organization wants to do by using four questions: "where are we today in terms of our business or strategy planning? Where are we going? Where do we want to go? How are we going to get there?..."{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Alternatives to planning ==
[[Opportunism]] can supplement or replace planning.<ref>
