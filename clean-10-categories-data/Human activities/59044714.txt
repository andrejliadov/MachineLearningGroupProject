[[File:Hammer nails smithonian.jpg|thumb|''Hammer and Nails'' (1977) by [[Hans Godo Frabel]]. A "glass hammer" is a highly impractical object which an apprentice might be sent to fetch as part of a fool's errand]]
A '''fool's errand''' is a type of [[practical joke]] or [[prank]] where a newcomer to a group, typically in a professional context, is given an impossible or nonsensical task by older or more experienced members of the group. Many such errands require the victim to travel some distance and request an impossible object by name; the prank will be widely known within the peer group as an [[in-joke]], and the person they ask for the object will play along, often by sending the victim on to make the same request elsewhere.

The errand is an example of a [[hazing]] ritual, through which a newcomer gains acceptance into a group.

==Examples==
* One type of North American fool's errand is the "[[snipe hunt]]".<ref name="Marsh 2015">{{cite book |last=Marsh |first= Moira |title=Practically Joking |date=2015 |publisher=Utah State University Press |location=Logan, UT |isbn=978-0-87-421983-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3jgCwAAQBAJ&q=snipe+hunt |pages=45–48}}</ref><ref name="Watts 2007">{{cite book |last=Watts |first = Linda S.|title=Encyclopedia of American folklore |date=2007 |publisher=Facts On File |location=New York|isbn=978-0-81-605699-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofam00lind |url-access=registration |quote=snipe hunt. |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofam00lind/page/206 206]}}</ref> The hunters are typically led to an outdoor spot at night and given a bag or pillowcase along with instructions that can include either waiting quietly or making odd noises to attract the creatures. The other group members leave, promising to chase the snipe toward the newcomer; instead, they return home or to camp, leaving the victim of the prank alone in the dark to discover that they have been duped and left "[[holding the bag]]".<ref name="Bronner 2012">{{cite book |last=Bronner |first=Simon J.|title=Campus traditions : folklore from the old-time college to the modern mega-university |date=2012 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson |isbn=978-1-61-703615-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJkkykeN-nkC&q=snipe+hunt&pg=PA260 |page=260}}</ref> As an American [[rite of passage]], it is often associated with [[summer camp]]s and groups such as the [[Boy Scouts]].<ref name="Fee">{{cite book|editor1-last=Fee|editor1-first=Christopher R.|editor-link1=Christopher R.

* New car repair staff are requested to collect fresh [[spark plug]] sparks, by catching sparks from a grinder disc using a small box.
* New car salespeople are often sent to different dealerships around town to get the "lot stretcher". After reaching the new dealership, the manager informs the victim that it has been moved to another dealership across town, and the prank continues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2009/08/editorial-of-ttacs-guide-to-car-dealer-lingo/|title=Editorial: TTAC's Guide to Car Dealer Lingo|date=2009-08-12|newspaper=The Truth About Cars|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-03}}</ref>
* A common fool's errand is to send someone to get "[[Automotive lighting|blinker]] fluid"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Here's How Actual 'Blinker Fluid' Could Work|url=https://jalopnik.com/here-s-how-actual-blinker-fluid-could-work-1822456779|access-date=2020-08-18|website=Jalopnik|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Megargee|first1=Jeremy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xf-FDwAAQBAJ&q=blinker+fluid&pg=PT68|title=Creeping Corruption Anthology|last2=Bondoni|first2=Gustavo|last3=Kirby|first3=Oscar|last4=Lubaczewski|first4=Paul|last5=Harrison|first5=Kev|last6=Kolb|first6=Lukas|last7=Bain|first7=Ian|last8=Booth|first8=Die|last9=Striker|first9=J.

* In [[baseball]], a manager or a coach will ask a new [[batboy]] to fetch them a "box of [[Curveball|curveballs]]" or "the keys to the [[batter's box]]." Major League pitcher [[Rick Sutcliffe]] would often perform this prank.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://gameofinches.blogspot.com/2009/02/baseballs-top-pranks.html| title=Sports: A Game Of Inches| work=gameofinches.blogspot.com| access-date=6 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19920315&id=4kJWAAAAIBAJ&pg=6770,3535341| title=Eugene Register-Guard |via= Google News Archive Search |work=google.com |access-date=6 September 2015}}</ref>

* [[File:Frosted light globe screw fitting.jpg|thumb|A lightbulb frosted on the interior was once thought to be impossible]]At [[General Electric]]'s NELA Park plant in the 1920s, as a joke, newly hired engineers would be told to develop an inside frosted lightbulb, which the experienced engineers believed to be impossible (previous bulbs had been sandblasted for the frosting effect, which caused brittleness). In 1925, newly-hired [[Marvin Pipkin]] got the assignment and astonished his peers by succeeding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schenectadymuseum.org/edison/c_modules/module_identify/A51.htm|work=Schenectady Museum|title=Marvin Pipkin|access-date=5 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226091801/http://www.schenectadymuseum.org/edison/c_modules/module_identify/A51.htm|archive-date=February 2016}}</ref>

* In the [[United States Air Force]], a new Airman will be asked to stand in front of an aircraft and move back and forth in order to calibrate the weather radar before takeoff. Another request for new aviators is to assist in an air quality check, where they are required to run around the cabin of an aircraft with a plastic trash bag and fill it with air before tying it off and writing the name of the Air quality project on it “I-D-10-T”.
