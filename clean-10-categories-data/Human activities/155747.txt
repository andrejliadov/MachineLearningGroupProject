'''Travel''' is the movement of people between distant geographical [[Location (geography)|location]]s. Travel can be done by [[Pedestrian|foot]], [[bicycle]], [[automobile]], [[train]], [[boat]], [[bus]], [[airplane]], [[ship]] or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/travel "Travel."] (definition). [http://www.thefreedictionary.com Thefreedictionary.com]. Accessed July 2011.</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/travel "Travel."] (definition). [http://www.merriam-webster.com Merriam-webster.com]. Accessed July 2011.</ref> Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of [[tourism]].

==Etymology==
The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate from the [[Old French]] word ''travail'', which means 'work'.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=travail&allowed_in_frame=0 Entymoligical dictionary] (definition). Retrieved on 10 December 2011</ref> According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, the first known use of the word ''travel'' was in the 14th century. It also states that the word comes from Middle English ''travailen'', ''travelen'' (which means to torment, labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French ''travailler'' (which means to work strenuously, toil). In English we still occasionally use the words "travail", which means struggle. According to Simon Winchester in his book ''The Best Travelers' Tales (2004)'', the words "travel" and "travail" both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the ''tripalium'' (in Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale). This link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Travel in modern times may or may not be much easier depending upon the destination. Travel to [[Mount Everest]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], [[extreme tourism]], and [[adventure travel]] are more difficult forms of travel. Travel can also be more difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by [[bus]], [[cruise ship]], or even by [[bullock cart]].<ref>Buzard, J. (1993) The Beaten Track.

Motives for travel include:

==History of travel==
Travel dates back to [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Baiae]].<ref name=matador>{{cite web|title=A History Of Why People Travel |url=https://matadornetwork.com/bnt/a-history-of-why-people-travel/ | website=Matador Network}}</ref>
While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible.<ref>[https://www.gapyear.com/history-of-travel/ "A Brief Visual History of Travel"]. Accessed May 2017.</ref> Mankind has come a long way in transportation since [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed to the new world from Spain in 1492, an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century where [[aircraft]] allow travel from Spain to the United States overnight.

Travel in the [[Middle Ages]] offered hardships and challenges, however, it was important to the economy and to society. The [[Wholesaling|wholesale sector]] depended (for example) on [[merchants]] dealing with/through [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] or sea-voyagers, end-user [[retailing]] often demanded the services of many itinerant [[peddler]]s wandering from village to hamlet, [[gyrovague]]s (Wandering Monks) and wandering [[friar]]s brought [[theology]] and [[Pastoral care|pastoral support]] to neglected areas, [[travelling minstrel]]s practiced the never-ending tour, and armies ranged far and wide in various crusades and in sundry other wars.<ref name=matador/>
Pilgrimages were common in both the European and Islamic world and involved streams of travellers both locally ([[Canterbury Tales]]-style) and internationally.<ref>{{cite book |last=Peters |first=F. E. |title=The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places |publisher=Princeton University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EK5MqskDYC0C&pg=PA164 |year=1994 |page=164 |isbn=9780691026190}}</ref>

In the late 16th century it became fashionable for young European [[aristocrat]]s and wealthy upper-class men to travel to significant European cities as part of their education in the arts and literature. This was known as the [[Grand Tour]], it included cities such as London, Paris, Venice, Florence and Rome.
However, The [[French revolution]] brought with it the end of the Grand Tour.<ref name=matador/>

Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of [[railway]]s in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging task. This was capitalised on by people like [[Thomas Cook]] selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together.<ref name=DW>{{cite news|title=A brief history of travel: From elite hobby to mass tourism|url=http://www.dw.com/en/a-brief-history-of-travel-from-elite-hobby-to-mass-tourism/a-16996047|accessdate=13 February 2018|work=Deutsche Welle|language=en}}</ref> [[Airship]]s and [[airplane]]s took over much of the role of long-distance surface travel in the 20th century, notably after the second World War where there was a surplus of both aircraft and pilots.<ref name=matador/> Indeed, air travel has become so ubiquitous in the 21st century that one woman, [[Alexis Alford]], visited all 196 countries before the age of 21.<ref name="twsLL222">{{cite web

== Geographic types ==
Travel may be local, regional, national (domestic) or international. In some countries, non-local internal travel may require an [[internal passport]], while international travel typically requires a [[passport]] and [[Visa (document)|visa]]. A trip may also be part of a round-trip, which is a particular type of travel whereby a person moves from one location to another and returns.<ref>
