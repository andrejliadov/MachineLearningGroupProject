'''EXAPT''' ("'''EX'''tended Subset of [[APT (programming language)|'''APT''']]") is a production oriented [[programming language]] to generate [[Numerical control|NC programs]] with control information for [[Machine tool|machining tools]] and enables to consider production-related issues of various machining processes.

EXAPT has developed historically regarding industrial requirements. Through the years software solutions{{solution-inline|date=December 2019}} for the manufacturing industry were created which today form a broad scalable portfolio with future-oriented products and services.

Today the tradename EXAPT is primarily understood as [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM-System]] and [[Production planning|production data]] und [[tool management]] [[Software]] of the German company EXAPT Systemtechnik GmbH based in Aachen.

== General==

EXAPT is a modularly built programming system for all NC machining operations <ref>[http://www.exapt.de/de/ ''EXAPT'']</ref> as
* [[Drilling]]
* [[Turning]]
* [[Milling (machining)|Milling]]
* Turn-Milling
* [[Blanking and piercing#Nibbling|Nibbling]]
* [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|Flame-]], [[Laser cutting|Laser-]], [[Plasma cutting|Plasma-]] and [[Water jet cutter|Water jet cutting]] 
* [[Electrical discharge machining|Wire eroding]]
* Operations with [[Industrial robot]]s
Due to the modular structure the main product groups '''EXAPTcam''' and '''EXAPTpdo''' are gradually expandable and permit individual software solutions{{solution-inline|date=December 2019}} for the manufacturing industry used individually and also in compound with an existing IT environment.

== Functionality==

'''EXAPTcam''' meets the requirements for NC planning especially for the cutting operations as turning, drilling and milling up to 5-axis simultaneous machining. Thereby new process technologies, tool and machine concepts are constantly involved. In the NC programming data from different sources as 3D CAD models, drawings or tables can flow in. The possibilities of NC programming reaches from the language-oriented to the feature-oriented NC programming. The integrated EXAPT knowledge database and intelligent and scalable automatisms support the user. The EXAPT NC planning also covers the generation of production information as clamping and tool plans, presetting data or time calculations. The realistic simulation possibilities of NC planning and NC control data provide with production reliability.

'''EXAPTpdo''' (EXAPT ProductionsDataOrganization) provides a neutrally applicable technology platform for the information compound of the NC planning - to the shop floor. This applies to all NC production data which are necessary for the set-up of NC machines, for the provision, presetting and stocking of manufacturing resources and provided by EXAPTpdo in a central [[database]]. Beside classical functions of the tool management system (TMS) as the management of cutting tools, measuring, testing and clamping devices the technology data management and tool lifecycle management (TLM) is also included. System-supported "where-used lists" help to handle the manufacturing resource cycle by secured requirement determination and requirement fulfillment. Unnecessary transports and unplanned dispositive adjustments are dropped, stocks are reduced, set-up times reduced and the throughput is increased. EXAPTpdo synchronizes involved systems within the [[value chain]]. [[Stock management|Stock systems]], [[Manufacturing execution system|MES systems]] or [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP systems]] (e.g. from the purchasing or production areas) do not work in isolation from each other but they interact with each other. EXAPTpdo provides the base to [[Industry 4.0|Smart Factory]], for more flexibility in production and a faster communication.

== History ==

With the foundation of the EXAPT-Verein in '''1967''' as spin-off of the universities [[RWTH Aachen University|Aachen]], [[Technical University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Stuttgart|Stuttgart]] the further development „EXAPT (EXtended Subset of APT)“ of the programming language „[[APT (programming language)|APT (Automatically Programmed Tool)]]“ was focused and so the first milestone for the EXAPT history was set.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.exapt-verein.de/de/Ueber_uns/chronologie.htm |title=''History of EXAPT-Verein'' |access-date=2016-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123075045/http://www.exapt-verein.de/de/Ueber_uns/chronologie.htm |archive-date=2017-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 
In the same year the system EXAPT 1 for drilling and simple milling tasks is available.

'''1969''' the industrial application of EXAPT 2 for the programming of NC machines with 2-axis linear and path control begins. In the following year the development of the EXAPT modular system starts.

'''1972''' BASIC-EXAPT is provided for the universal, homogeneous programming of all NC tasks. The support is made by the EXAPT applications consultancy.

'''1973''' EXAPT 1.1 is provided for the programming of straight-cut and continuous-path controlled drilling and milling machines and machining centres. At the Hanover Fair (IHA 73) the interactive access to a mainframe via time-sharing terminal for the part program entry and correction is presented and starts the replacement of the [[Punched card|punch card]].

'''1974''' the possibilities for the use of process computers for the NC data transfer are levelled out. As a pioneer EXAPT offers the possibility of the result simulation when using plotters with display of tool paths and tool in assignment to the workpiece.

In April '''1975''' the EXAPT NC Systemtechnik GmbH is founded with the aim, to enable the entry into the NC technique for small and medium-sized companies by a complete product and service program. In the following year the system portfolio is extended with further system modules and service programs and the provision of postprocessors.

'''1978''' the development activities on the EXAPT module system started 1970 are completed. Using modern software techniques the different system parts BASIC-EXAPT, EXAPT 1, EXAPT 1.1 and EXAPT 2 are composed to a total system. System support and applications consultancy become a new working focus.

'''From the beginning to the middle of the 1980s''' beside new portable software modules for CAD/CAM applications (e. g. CAPEX, NESTEX, CADEX, CADCPL) the first version of the EXAPT DNC system and extensions of the EXAPT NC programming system für the machining of sculptured surfaces are presented.

'''1988''' EXAPT expands the software product range by systems for the tool data management (BMO) and production data management (FDO). In 1988 EXAPT trains more than 1.300 course participants including company-specific courses.

'''1992''' the first version of the completely new product generation EXAPTplus is presented and the agency in Dresden is opened.

'''1993''' the company name " EXAPT NC Systemtechnik GmbH“ is changed to „EXAPT Systemtechnik GmbH“.EXAPTplus is presented on PC under Windows NT at the EMO '93. The decentralization of the use of EXAPT systems expands the range of application considerably. In the following year EXAPT-DNC is executable under Windows on customary PC. Special hardware is not needed and so it can be used in compound with the database-supported EXAPT production data management system (FDO).

'''1995''' EXAPTplus is also ready for complex application cases as machining of tubes at extrusion tools. EXAPT-CADI provides the transfer of 2D CAD data to EXAPTplus. With the new office Gießen the marketing is strengthened. In the following year the EXAPT NC editor is developed for the direct processing of NC control data with tool path display and visualization of the tools.

In the course of the market entry of more comfortable 3D CAD systems for the solid modelling of components a detailed evaluation of current systems is made in '''1997'''. It is decided to use SolidWorks as reference system for the solid oriented NC planning with EXAPT.

'''1998''' the first solution{{solution-inline|date=December 2019}} for the transfer of geometry data between SolidWorks and EXAPTplus is generated. The EXAPT organization systems are (beside SQL) also executable under Oracle now. The use of client server solutions{{solution-inline|date=December 2019}} supports the data flow in the production.

'''1999''' AFR functions are provided in connection with EXAPTsolid to support a workpiece modelling for NC. The millennium capability is ensured for all EXAPT systems. AFR is ground-breaking for the integration of third party products.

'''2002''' EXAPT-BMG is developed for the generation and visualization of tools with additional functions for the assembly from components. The acquisition of tools with its geometric and technological presentation offers extensive support of the NC planning with EXAPT systems.

'''2003''' EXAPTpdo is available to optimize the process chains in production planning and production execution optimally regarding the increasing requirements of changing production conditions.

'''2004''' are diverse system extensions made in EXAPTplus, EXAPTsolid, EXAPT NC editor, EXAPTpdo for the complete machining on turning/ milling centres with result reliability because of more extensive simulation based on realNC (Tecnomatix), for the use of new complex tool systems and for the compound use between ERP systems as SAP and intelligent CNC systems. In the following year EXAPTpdo is extended for the cross-order set-up optimization and provision of manufacturing re-sources especially for single and small series production with connection to purchase and physical portfolio management.

'''2006''' the EXAPT systems are available in the extended use as information platform for the production, the time management and similar requirements. EXAPTsolid is extended for the feature-oriented milling operation and machine simulation. The NC programming of complex machine tools, e.g. three-turret-turning/milling centres is supported by EXAPT systems, as well as the use of multi-functional tools.

'''2007''' a module for 3-5-axis simultaneous milling machining is presented.
