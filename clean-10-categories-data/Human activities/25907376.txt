'''Heli hiking''' is a [[Recreation|recreational activity]] in which a [[helicopter]] is used to access remote areas of the [[Backcountry|back country]] for hiking. These locations are typically inaccessible through other forms of transportation. Along with heli skiing, heli hiking is one of the most popular forms of heli [[tourism]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Simon|last2=Miller|first2=Graham A|date=2005-04-01|title=The responsible marketing of tourism: the case of Canadian Mountain Holidays|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517703002371|journal=Tourism Management|language=en|volume=26|issue=2|pages=133–142|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2003.06.005|issn=0261-5177}}</ref><ref>Thirkell, K.

Heli hiking is a form of [[mountain]] recreation in the mountainous regions of [[New Zealand]] and [[the Bugaboos]] in [[Canada]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Booth|first=Kay L.|last2=Cullen|first2=Ross|date=November 2001|title=Managing Recreation and Tourism in New Zealand Mountains|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1659/0276-4741%282001%29021%5B0331%3AMRATIN%5D2.0.CO%3B2|journal=Mountain Research and Development|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=331–334|doi=10.1659/0276-4741(2001)021[0331:MRATIN]2.0.CO;2|issn=0276-4741}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Moure|first=Celeste|date=|title=Heli-Hiking in the Canadian Rockies|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/canada/heli-hiking-in-the-canadian-rockies-british-columbia/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=National Geographic}}</ref> It is a form of [[glacier]] tourism in locations including [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay National Park]], [[Westland Tai Poutini National Park]], and [[Ilulissat Icefjord]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2020-12-01|title=China's glacier tourism: Potential evaluation and spatial planning|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212571X20301281|journal=Journal of Destination Marketing & Management|language=en|volume=18|pages=100506|doi=10.1016/j.jdmm.2020.100506|issn=2212-571X}}</ref>

== History ==
The first heli hiking tour took place in the summer of 1978 at the Cariboo Lodge, operated by Canadian Mountain Holidays.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|last=Richins|first=Harold|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ND9CwAAQBAJ&dq|title=Mountain Tourism: Experiences, Communities, Environments and Sustainable Futures|last2=Hull|first2=John|date=2016-02-19|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-78064-460-8|language=en}}</ref> It was introduced as and continues to be the summer counterpart to heli skiing.<ref name=":2" />

== Marketing ==
Heli hiking has been marketed toward women.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bond|first=Marybeth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_Ckm6_VlRkC&dq|title=50 Best Girlfriends Getaways in North America|date=2007|publisher=National Geographic Books|isbn=978-1-4262-0051-9|language=en}}</ref> It is popular among young female tourists in New Zealand.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shipway|first=Richard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHBjYOWvj9sC&lr=&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=International Sports Events: Impacts, Experiences and Identities|last2=Fyall|first2=Alan|date=2013-05-07|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-47563-4|language=en}}</ref>

The activity is advertised as a luxury tourist attraction.

== Environmental impact and regulation ==
Due to the disturbances caused by helicopter overflights, heli hiking is considered by authorities to be a possible cause of the decline of the [[mountain goat]] population in southeastern [[British Columbia]] and is opposed by the [[Regional District of East Kootenay|East Kootenay]] Environmental Society.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Michael I.|last2=Poe|first2=Aaron J.|last3=Cooper|first3=Erin|last4=Youkey|first4=Don|last5=Brown|first5=Bridget A.|last6=McDonald|first6=Trent L.|date=2005|title=Mountain goat response to helicopter overflights in Alaska|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2193/0091-7648%282005%2933%5B688%3AMGRTHO%5D2.0.CO%3B2|journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=688–699|doi=10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[688:MGRTHO]2.0.CO;2|issn=1938-5463}}</ref><ref>Poole, K.

In the [[North Cascades]], heli hiking has been discouraged by the [[United States Forest Service]].<ref>Burr, Eric. "Heli-Ski Survival Guide." https://arc.lib.montana.edu/snow-science/objects/issw-1996-207-208.pdf</ref> However, there is still minimal regulation of heli hiking and other mountain recreation activities for environmental protection.<ref name=":1" />
