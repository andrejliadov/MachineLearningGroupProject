'''Hagbard Celine''' is a central protagonist in the ''[[Illuminatus trilogy]]'' of books by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], named after the legendary Viking hero [[Hagbard]] who died for love. In the ''[[Schr√∂dinger's Cat trilogy]]'', written after ''Illuminatus!'', it is stated that 'Hagbard Celine' is a pseudonym, and his legal name is 'Howard Crane'.  However, the trilogy passes through many very different universes.

==Character==
Hagbard has parallels to [[Jules Verne]]'s character, [[Captain Nemo]]. Both are genius captains aboard a fantastic submarine. Both are rogues who have mostly broken off from society, yet help the oppressed. Some have even theorized that Hagbard Celine is Captain Nemo,[http://www.coolfrenchcomics.com/wnu6.htm] though Verne's ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' is set in the second half of the nineteenth century. He is also comparable to a degree to [[Ragnar Danneskjold]], a libertarian pirate in the [[Ayn Rand]] novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', which is spoofed in the chronicles as "''Telemachus Sneezed''". Like Danneskjold, Hagbard participates in the black market, exploiting and resisting governments, and both characters have Norwegian roots.

Hagbard is a notorious prankster and liar (telling one character not to trust anyone with the initials H.C.). This character trait is displayed throughout ''Illuminatus!''. Celine tends to give misinformation about himself and his intentions and that he faked the death of an actress in order to train her into becoming an embodiment of the goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]]. Celine subsequently fell in love with the woman and announces his intention to marry her during the trilogy.

A [[Discordianism|Discordian]] [[anarchist]], he fights the Illuminati from a golden submarine, the ''Leif Ericson'' (named after [[Leif Ericson|the Viking explorer]]) The submarine was supposedly designed and built by himself, stolen from the [[United States Navy]], or a gift from [[the Mafia]]. Despite its size - the equivalent of five city blocks long with a three-story-high [[conning tower]] - it has so far remained undetected.

He has a Norwegian mother and a Sicilian father, and physically resembles [[Anthony Quinn]].  In a section printed in the introductions of volumes I and II of the trilogy, though not reprinted in the single volume compilation, the narrator mentions that he has a raft of Irish relatives in Ohio named McGee and Marlowe.  Wilson also implies in ''[[The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles]]'' that Hagbard is related to one of the central characters, Sigismundo Celine.

He speaks Norwegian, Italian, English, German, Latin, Greek and Swahili. He graduated [[Harvard]] with the somewhat strange [[double major]] of [[contract law]] and [[naval engineering]].

A former [[Naturalization|naturalized]] United States citizen, Hagbard supposedly [[relinquishment of United States nationality|relinquished his citizenship]] after representing a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] reservation in court against the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. Hagbard himself generally told people that he was an engineer building a dam during his time with the Mohawk because he was ashamed at having been a lawyer.

He later became a citizen of [[Equatorial Guinea]] of which [[Bioko|Fernando Poo]] is a part; having papers referring to this by the time of the [[Walpurgis Night|Walpurgisnacht]] rock concert. In the appendix to the trilogy, it mentions that Hagbard builds a [[starship]] and leaves to explore [[Alpha Centauri]] in the year 1999.

Hagbard designed a supercomputer called First Universal Cybernetic Kynetic Ultramicro-Programmer (FUCKUP). Among other things, he used FUCKUP to calculate the chances of [[World War III]] starting, which it does by throwing virtual [[I Ching]] sticks.

His manifesto is called ''Never Whistle While You're Pissing'', containing his ''Definitions and Distinctions'', an anarchist interpretation of capitalist concepts.<ref>{{cite web
