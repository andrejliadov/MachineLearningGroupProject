{{short description|Growth of agricultural land in the 21st century}}
'''Agricultural expansion''' describes the growth of [[agricultural land]] ([[arable land]], [[pastures]], etc.) in the 21st century.

The agricultural expansion is often explained as a direct consequence of the global increase in [[food security|food]] and [[energy security|energy]] requirements due to the [[human overpopulation]] (which in turn has been attributed to agricultural expansion itself<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/bystrc/pub/pimentel.pdf|title=Human population numbers as a function of food supply|work=Russel Hopfenburg, David Pimentel, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA;2Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA|quote=Human population growth has typically been seen as the primary causative factor of other ecologically destructive phenomena. Current human disease epidemics are explored as a function of population size. That human population growth is itself a phenomenon with clearly identifiable ecological/biological causes has been overlooked. Here, human population growth is discussed as being subject to the same dynamic processes as the population growth of other species. Contrary to the widely held belief that food production must be increased to feed the growing population, experimental and correlational data indicate that human population growth varies as a function of food availability. By increasing food production for humans, at the expense of other species, the biologically determined effect has been, and continues to be, an increase in the human population. Understanding the relationship between food increases and population increases is proposed as a necessary first step in addressing this global problem. Resistance to this perspective is briefly discussed in terms of cultural bias in science.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ecorazzi.com/2014/02/19/morgan-freeman-on-the-tyranny-of-agriculture-and-the-doomed-human-race/|title=Morgan Freeman on the Tyranny of Agriculture|publisher=Ecorazzi.com}}</ref>), with an estimated expectation of 10 to 11 billion humans on Earth by end of this century. It is foreseen that most of the world's non-agrarian ecosystems ([[terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]] and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]]) will be [[environmental impact|affected adversely]], from [[habitat loss]], [[land degradation]], [[overexploitation]], and other problems. The intensified [[food production|food]] (and [[biofuel]]) production will in particular affect the [[tropical]] regions.

Most modern agriculture relies on [[intensive agriculture|intensive]] methods. Further expansion of the predominant farming types that rest on a small number of [[High-yielding variety|highly productive crops]] has led to a significant [[loss of biodiversity]] on a global scale already.<ref name="Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment 2018">{{cite web | title=The expansion of modern agriculture and global biodiversity decline: an integrated assessment | website=[[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] | date=2018-02-19 | url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/publication/running-with-the-red-queen-an-integrated-assessment-of-agricultural-land-expansion-and-global-biodiversity-decline/ | access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>
Moreover, agricultural expansion continues to be the main driver of deforestation and forest fragmentation. Large-scale commercial agriculture (primarily cattle ranching and cultivation of soya bean and oil palm) accounted for 40 percent of tropical deforestation between 2000 and 2010, and local subsistence agriculture for another 33 percent.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.4060/ca8985en|title=The State of the World’s Forests 2020.

The [[FAO]] predicts that global [[arable land]] use will continue to grow from a {{convert | 1.58 | e9ha}} in 2014 to {{convert|1.66 |e9ha}} in 2050, with most of this growth projected to result from [[developing countries]]. At the same time, arable land use in [[developed countries]] is likely to continue its decline.<ref name="Our World in Data">{{cite web | title=Yields and Land Use in Agriculture | website=Our World in Data | url=https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture | access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>

A well-known example of already ongoing agricultural expansion is the proliferation of [[palm oil]] production areas or the [[land conversion]]/[[deforestation]] for [[soy bean]] production in [[South America]]. Today's [[land grabbing]] activities are often a consequence of the strive for agricultural land by [[economic growth|growing]] economies.<ref name="Ceddia Bardsley Gomez-y-Paloma Sedlacek pp. 7242–7247">{{cite journal | last1=Ceddia | first1=M.

In the beginning of the 21 century the palm oil industry caused a massive [[Deforestation and climate change|deforestation]] in Borneo with a heavy consequences.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wright |first1=Rebecca |last2=Watson |first2=Ivan |last3=Booth |first3=Tom |last4=Jamaluddin |first4=Masrur |title=Borneo is burning |url=https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/11/asia/borneo-climate-bomb-intl-hnk/index.html |access-date=4 December 2019 |agency=CNN}}</ref>
