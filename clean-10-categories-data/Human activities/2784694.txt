==History==

In 1920, Mr. F.C. Kenworthy began cataloging his transportation token collection. Five years later, Mr. Kenworthy handed his work off to Mr. R.W. Dunn. In 1932 Mr. Dunn printed his list of U.S. and foreign transportation tokens.  Shortly after printing, Dr. Dunn passed the task of cataloging transportation tokens off to Ronald C. Atwood. In 1948, Mr. Atwood had his ''National Check and Premium List of All U.S. Transportation Tokens'' published by the American Numismatic Company of [[Los Angeles]].

Meanwhile, Mr. R.L. Moore began publishing the ''Fare Box'', a monthly newsletter about transportation [[Token (Numismatics)|tokens]]. On October 31, 1948, the American Vecturist Association was formed in [[New York City]] out of interest sparked from Mr. Moore's newsletter. Two months later, Mr. Moore turned over the ''Fare Box'' to the newly formed American Vecturist Association.  [[John M. Coffee Jr.]] (died 2012), a history professor at [[Emerson College]] in Boston and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister, was the Editor of the ''Fare Box'' for 60 years.<ref>{{cite web
