'''Moneygami''' (also known as '''money-gami''')<ref name=Post/> is a term that arose as a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[money]] and [[origami]]. It refers to shaping [[paper currency]], such as [[India]]n [[Indian rupee|rupees]] and [[United States]] [[United States dollar|dollars]], into pieces of art. The concept has been popularized by individuals such as Japanese [[pop art]]ist Yosuke Hasegawa, who has had his work featured at an exhibition at the [[Tadu Art Gallery]], and its creation can function as [[Culture|cultural]] commentary on the value that [[Economic materialism|materialistic]] societies place on money. For example, one piece by Hasegawa involves Chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s folded head wearing a [[cowboy hat]] in a double image, based on [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[Triple Elvis|famous picture of]] [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=Nation>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/sunday/Money-changes-everything-30265660.html|title=Money changes everything|accessdate=23 September 2015|date=2 August 2015|newspaper= [[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]] |first=Khetsirin|last=Pholdhampalit}}</ref>

The name alludes to traditional origami, which is the [[Japanese art]] of folding flat materials, generally paper, into figures resembling various objects. Other examples of moneygami include folding bills into clothing-like bits, such as dollar bills becoming [[bowties]].<ref name=Post>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2014/01/16/Carnegie-boy-teachs-origami/stories/201401160059|title=Carnegie boy, 12, teaches origami|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=25 September 2015|date=15 January 2014}}</ref>
