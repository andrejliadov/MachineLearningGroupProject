==Overview==
{{See also|Classification of advocacy groups}}
An advocacy group is a group or an organization which tries to influence the government but does not hold power in the government.

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:William Hogarth - John Wilkes, Esq.png|thumb|150px|right|upright|Satirical engraving of Wilkes by [[William Hogarth]]. On the table beside Wilkes lies two editions of ''[[The North Briton]]''.]]
The early growth of pressure groups was connected to broad economic and political changes in England in the mid-18th century, including [[political representation]], [[market capitalization]], and [[proletarianization]]. The first mass social movement catalyzed around the controversial political figure, [[John Wilkes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/51006/232.pdf?...1|title=BRITAIN CREATES THE SOCIAL MOVEMENT|first=Charles|last=Tilly}}</ref> As editor of the paper ''[[The North Briton]]'', Wilkes vigorously attacked the new administration of [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]] and the peace terms that the new government accepted at the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] at the end of the [[Seven Years' War]]. Charged with [[seditious libel]], Wilkes was arrested after the issue of a [[general warrant]], a move that Wilkes denounced as unlawful – the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] eventually ruled in Wilkes favour. As a result of this episode, Wilkes became a figurehead to the growing movement for popular sovereignty among the middle classes – people began chanting, "Wilkes and Liberty" in the streets.

After a later period of exile, brought about by further charges of libel and [[obscenity]], Wilkes stood for the Parliamentary seat at [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]], where most of his support was located.<ref>{{cite book|last =Cash|first = Arthur|date= 2006 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/johnwilkes00arth_0/page/204 204–226]|title = John Wilkes: The Scandalous Father of Civil Liberty|url =https://archive.org/details/johnwilkes00arth_0|url-access =registration|isbn =  978-0300123630|publisher = Yale University Press}}</ref> When Wilkes was imprisoned in the [[King's Bench Prison]] on 10 May 1768, a mass movement of support emerged, with large demonstrations in the streets under the slogan "No liberty, no King."{{Sfn|Cash|2006|pp=216–26}} Stripped of the right to sit in Parliament, Wilkes became an [[Alderman]] of [[City of London|London]] in 1769, and an activist group called the ''Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights'' began aggressively promoting his policies.<ref>[http://www.historyhome.co.uk/c-eight/18reform/ssbr.htm www.historyhome.co.uk]</ref> This was the first ever sustained social advocacy group;—it involved public meetings, demonstrations, the distribution of pamphlets on an unprecedented scale and the mass petition march. However, the movement was careful not to cross the line into open rebellion;—it tried to rectify the faults in governance through appeals to existing legal precedents and was conceived of as an extra-Parliamentary form of agitation to arrive at a consensual and constitutional arrangement.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Rudbeck | first1 = J. | title = Popular sovereignty and the historical origin of the social movement | doi = 10.1007/s11186-012-9180-x | journal =   Theory and Society| volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 581–601 | year = 2012 | s2cid = 143513084 }}</ref>  The force and influence of this social advocacy movement on the streets of London compelled the authorities to concede to the movement's demands. Wilkes was returned to Parliament, [[general warrant]]s were declared as unconstitutional and press freedom was extended to the coverage of [[Parliamentary debate]]s.

Another important advocacy group that emerged in the late 18th century was the British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] movement against [[slavery]]. Starting with an organised sugar boycott in 1791, it led the second great petition drive of 1806, which brought about the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|banning of the slave trade]] in 1807. In the opinion of Eugene Black (1963), "...association made possible the extension of the politically effective public. Modern extra parliamentary political organization is a product of the late eighteenth century [and] the history of the age of reform cannot be written without it.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0674050002|title=The Association British Extra Parliamentary Political Organization, 1769-1793|first=Eugene Charlton|last=Black|year=1963|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=279}}</ref>

===Growth and spread===
[[File:Chartist meeting on Kennington Common by William Edward Kilburn 1848 - restoration1.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Great Chartist Meeting on [[Kennington Common]], London in 1848.]]
From 1815, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] after victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] entered a period of social upheaval characterised by the growing maturity of the use of social movements and special-interest associations. [[Chartism]] was the first mass movement of the growing working-class in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.counterfire.org/index.php/articles/75-our-history/12331-chartism-the-birth-of-mass-working-class-resistance|title=Chartism: the birth of mass working class resistance |access-date=17 December 2012}}</ref> It campaigned for political reform between 1838 and 1848 with the [[People's Charter of 1838]] as its manifesto – this called for [[universal suffrage]] and the implementation of the [[secret ballot]], amongst other things. The term "social movements" was introduced in 1848 by the German Sociologist [[Lorenz von Stein]] in his book ''Socialist and Communist Movements since the Third French Revolution (1848)'' in which he introduced the term "social movement" into scholarly discussions<ref>Tilly, 2004, p.&nbsp;5.</ref> – actually depicting in this way [[political movement]]s fighting for the social rights understood as [[welfare rights]].

[[Image:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] led the [[American Civil Rights Movement]], one of the most famous social movements of the 20th century.]]
The [[labor movement]] and [[socialist movement]] of the late 19th century are seen as the prototypical social movements, leading to the formation of [[communism|communist]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties and organisations. These tendencies were seen in poorer countries as pressure for reform continued, for example in Russia with the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917|of 1917]], resulting in the collapse of the Czarist regime around the end of the [[World War I|First World War]].

In the post-war period, [[Feminism|women's rights]], [[gay rights movement|gay rights]], [[peace movement|peace]], [[civil rights]], [[anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear]] and [[environmental movement]]s emerged, often dubbed the [[New Social Movements]],<ref>Westd, David B. "New Social Movements." Knowledge Center. Built on the Thematic Theme Framework., 16 July 2004.</ref> some of which may be considered "[[public interest|general interest]] groups" as opposed to special interest groups. They led, among other things, to the formation of [[green parties]] and organisations influenced by the [[new left]]. Some find in the end of the 1990s the emergence of a new global social movement, the [[anti-globalization movement]]. Some social movement scholars posit that with the rapid pace of globalization, the potential for the emergence of new ''type'' of social movement is latent—they make the analogy to national movements of the past to describe what has been termed a [[global citizens movement]].

==Activities==
Advocacy groups exist in a wide variety of genres based upon their most pronounced activities.
* Anti-defamation organizations issue responses or criticisms to real or supposed slights of any sort (including speech or violence) by an individual or group against a specific segment of the population which the organization exists to represent.
* Watchdog groups exist to provide oversight and rating of actions or media by various outlets, both government and corporate. They may also index personalities, organizations, products, and activities in databases to provide coverage and rating of the value or viability of such entities to target demographics.
* Lobby groups [[Lobbying|lobby]] for a change to the law or the maintenance of a particular law and big businesses fund very considerable lobbying influence on legislators, for example [[Lobbying in the United States|in the USA]] and [[Lobbying in the United Kingdom|in the UK]] where lobbying first developed. Some Lobby groups have considerable financial resources at their disposal. Lobbying is regulated to stop the worst abuses which can develop into [[Political corruption|corruption]]. In the United States the [[Internal Revenue Service]] makes a clear distinction between lobbying and advocacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npaction.org/article/articleview/76/1/248 |title=Lobbying Versus Advocacy: Legal Definitions |publisher=NP Action |access-date=2010-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402225054/http://www.npaction.org/article/articleview/76/1/248 |archive-date=2 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
* Lobby groups spend considerable amounts of money on election advertising as well. For example, the 2011 documentary film ''[[Hot Coffee (film)|Hot Coffee]]'' contains interviews of former [[Mississippi Supreme Court]] Justice [[Oliver E. Diaz, Jr.]] and evidence the [[US Chamber of Commerce]] paid for advertising to unseat him.
* [[Defense (legal)|Legal defense]] funds provide funding for the legal defense for, or legal action against, individuals or groups related to their specific interests or target demographic. This is often accompanied by one of the above types of advocacy groups filing an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' if the cause at stake serves the interests of both the legal defense fund and the other advocacy groups.
* [[Astroturfing]] groups mask the sponsors of a message or organization (e.g., political, advertising, religious or public relations) to make it appear as though it originates from and is supported by grassroots participants. It is a practice intended to give the statements or organizations credibility by withholding information about the source's financial connection.

==Influence==
In most [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], advocacy groups tend to use the [[bureaucracy]] as the main channel of influence – because, in liberal democracies, this is where the decision-making power lies. The aim of advocacy groups here is to attempt to influence a member of the [[legislature]] to support their cause by voting a certain way in the legislature. Access to this channel is generally restricted to groups with insider status such as large corporations and trade unions – groups with outsider status are unlikely to be able to meet with ministers or other members of the bureaucracy to discuss policy. What must be understood about groups exerting influence in the bureaucracy is; "the crucial relationship here [in the bureaucracy] is usually that between the senior bureaucrats and leading business or industrial interests".<ref name="Heywood 2007 305">{{cite book|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Politics|year=2007|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|page=305}}</ref> This supports the view that groups with greater financial resources at their disposal will generally be better able to influence the decision-making process of government. The advantages that large businesses have is mainly due to the fact that they are key producers within their countries economy and, therefore, their interests are important to the government as their contributions are important to the economy. According to [[George Monbiot]], the influence of [[big business]] has been strengthened by "the greater ease with which corporations can [[:wikt:relocation|relocate]] production and investment in a [[global economy]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Monibot|first=George|title=The Captive State: The Corporate Take-Over of Britain|year=2011|publisher=Pan|location=London}}</ref>  This suggests that in the ever modernising world, big business has an increasing role in influencing the bureaucracy and in turn, the decision-making process of government.

Advocacy groups can also exert influence through the assembly by lobbying. Groups with greater economic resources at their disposal can employ professional lobbyists to try and exert influence in the assembly. An example of such a group is the environmentalist group [[Greenpeace]]; Greenpeace (an organisation with income upward of $50,000,000) use lobbying to gain political support for their campaigns. They raise issues about the environment with the aim of having their issues translated into policy such as the government encouraging [[alternative energy]] and [[recycling]].

The judicial branch of government can also be used by advocacy groups to exert influence. In states where legislation cannot be challenged by the courts, like the UK, advocacy groups are limited in the amount of influence they have. In states that have codified constitutions, like the US, however, advocacy group influence is much more significant. For example, – in 1954 the [[NAACP]] (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) lobbied against the [[Topeka]] Board of education, arguing that segregation of education based on race was unconstitutional. As a result of group pressure from the NAACP, the supreme court unanimously ruled that racial segregation in education was indeed unconstitutional and such practices were banned. This is a novel example of how advocacy groups can exert influence in the judicial branch of government.

Advocacy groups can also exert influence on political parties. The main way groups do this is through campaign finance. For instance; in the UK, the conservative parties campaigns are often funded by large corporations, as many of the conservative parties campaigns reflect the interests of businesses. For example, [[George W. Bush]]'s re-election campaign in 2004 was the most expensive in American history and was financed mainly by large corporations and industrial interests that the Bush administration represented in government. Conversely, left-wing parties are often funded by organised labour – when the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was formed, it was largely funded by trade unions. Often, political parties are actually formed as a result of group pressure, for example, the Labour Party in the UK was formed out of the new trade-union movement which lobbied for the rights of workers.

Advocacy groups also exert influence through channels that are separate from the government or the political structure such as the [[mass media]] and through [[public opinion]] campaigning. Advocacy groups will use methods such as [[protesting]], [[petitioning]] and [[civil disobedience]] to attempt to exert influence in Liberal Democracies. Groups will generally use two distinct styles when attempting to manipulate the media – they will either put across their outsider status and use their inability to access the other channels of influence to gain sympathy or they may put across a more ideological agenda. Traditionally, a prime example of such a group were the trade-unions who were the so-called "industrial" muscle. Trade-unions would campaign in the forms of industrial action and marches for workers rights, these gained much media attention and sympathy for their cause. In the United States, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gained much of its publicity through civil disobedience; African Americans would simply disobey the racist segregation laws to get the violent, racist reaction from the police and white Americans. This violence and racism was then broadcast all over the world, showing the world just how one sided the race 'war' in America actually was.

Advocacy group influence has also manifested itself in supranational bodies that have arisen through [[globalisation]]. Groups that already had a global structure such as Greenpeace were better able to adapt to globalisation. Greenpeace, for example, has offices in over 30 countries and has an income of $50 million annually. Groups such as these have secured the nature of their influence by gaining status as [[nongovernmental organisation]]s (NGOs), many of which oversee the work of the UN and the EU from their permanent offices in America and Europe. Group pressure by [[supranational union|supranational]] industries can be exerted in a number of ways: "through direct lobbying by large corporations, national trade bodies and 'peak' associations such as the [[European Round Table of Industrialists]]".<ref name="Heywood 2007 305"/>

* [[US Chamber of Commerce]], by far the biggest lobby group in the US by expenditures .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?showYear=a&indexType=s |website=opensecrets.org|title=Lobby}}</ref>

==Adversarial groupings==
On some controversial issues there are a number of competing advocacy groups, sometimes with very different resources available to them:
* [[Pro-choice]] vs [[Pro-life movement]]s ([[abortion]] policy in the United States)
* [[SPEAK campaign]] vs [[Pro-Test]] ([[animal testing]] in United Kingdom)
* [[The Automobile Association]] vs [[Pedestrians' Association]] (now 'Living Streets') (road safety in the United Kingdom since 1929)
* [[Tobacco Institute]] vs [[Action on Smoking and Health]] (tobacco legislation)
* [[Flying Matters]] vs [[Plane Stupid]] (aviation policy in the United Kingdom since 2007)

==Benefits and incentives==

===Free rider problem===

A general theory is that individuals must be enticed with some type of [[:wikt:benefit|benefit]] to join an interest group.<ref name="John R p. 19"/> However, the [[free rider problem]] addresses the difficulty of obtaining members of a particular interest group when the benefits are already reaped without membership. For instance, an interest group dedicated to improving farming standards will fight for the general goal of improving farming for every farmer, even those who are not members of that particular interest group. Thus, there is no real incentive to join an interest group and pay dues if the farmer will receive that benefit anyway.<ref name="Olson">{{cite book | first=Mancur | last=Olson | author-link=Mancur Olson | orig-year=1965 | year=1971 | title=The Logic of Collective Action : Public Goods and the Theory of Groups | edition=Revised | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0-674-53751-4 | url=https://archive.org/details/logicofcollectiv00olso_0 }}</ref>{{rp|111–131}}  For another example, every individual in the world would benefit from a cleaner environment, but [[environmental protection]] interest groups do not receive monetary help from every individual in the world.<ref name="John R p. 19">{{cite book|author=Wright, John R.|title=Interest Groups and Congress, Lobbying, Contributions, and Influence|pages=[https://archive.org/details/interestgroupsco0000wrig/page/19 19–21]|isbn=978-0-02-430301-1|publisher=Longman|date=January 1996|url=https://archive.org/details/interestgroupsco0000wrig/page/19}}</ref>

This poses a problem for interest groups, which require dues from their members and contributions in order to accomplish the groups' agendas.<ref name="John R p. 19"/>

===Selective benefits===

Selective benefits are material, rather than monetary benefits conferred on group members. For instance, an interest group could give members [[travel discount]]s, [[free meal]]s at certain restaurants, or [[free subscription]]s to magazines, newspapers, or journals.<ref name="Olson"/>{{rp|133–134}} Many trade and professional interest groups tend to give these types of benefits to their members.

===Solidarity incentives===

A solidary incentive is a reward for participation that is socially derived and created out of the act of association. A selective solidary benefit offered to members or prospective members of an interest group might involve such incentives as "socializing congeniality, the sense of group membership and identification, the status resulting from membership, fun, [[conviviality]], the maintenance of [[social distinction]]s, and so on.<ref>{{cite book |author=Clark, Peter B. |author2=Wilson, James Q. |title=Incentive Systems: A Theory of Organizations|publisher=[[Administrative Science Quarterly]]|issue=6|year=1961|pages=134–135}}</ref>

===Expressive incentives===

People who join an interest group because of expressive benefits likely joined to express an [[ideological]] or [[moral]] value that they believe in, such as [[free speech]], [[civil rights]], [[economic justice]], or [[political equality]]. To obtain these types of benefits, members would simply pay dues, and donate their time or money to get a feeling of satisfaction from expressing a political value. Also, it would not matter if the interest group achieved their goal; these members would merely be able to say they helped out in the process of trying to obtain their goals, which is the expressive incentive that they got in the first place.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Salisbury|first = Robert H. |title=An Exchange Theory of Interest Groups|journal=Midwest Journal of Political Science |volume =13|number =1|year=1969|pages=1–32|url = http://pavroz.ru/files/salisburyexchangetheory.pdf|doi= 10.2307/2110212 |jstor = 2110212 }}</ref> The types of interest groups that rely on expressive benefits or incentives are environmental groups and groups who claim to be lobbying for the public interest.<ref name="John R p. 19"/>

===Latent interests===

Some public policy interests are not recognized or addressed by a group at all. These interests are labeled latent interests.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Theoretical perspectives==

Much work has been undertaken by academics attempting to categorize how advocacy groups operate, particularly in relation to governmental policy creation. The field is dominated by numerous and diverse schools of thought:
* '''[[Pluralism (political theory)|Pluralism]]''': This is based upon the understanding that advocacy groups operate in competition with one another and play a key role in the political system.  They do this by acting as a counterweight to undue concentrations of power.
:However, this pluralist theory (formed primarily by American academics) reflects a more open and fragmented political system similar to that in countries such as the United States. 
* '''Neo-pluralism''': Under neo-pluralism, a concept of political communities developed that is more similar to the British form of government. This is based on the concept of political communities in that advocacy groups and other such bodies are organised around a government department and its network of client groups.  The members of this network co-operate together during the policy making process.
* '''[[Corporatism]]''' or '''[[elitism]]''': Some advocacy groups are backed by private businesses which can have a considerable influence on legislature.

==Social media use==

A study published in early 2012<ref name="Advocacy 2.0" /> suggests that advocacy groups of varying political and ideological orientations operating in the United States are using [[social media]] to interact with citizens every day. The study surveyed 53 groups, that were found to be using a variety of social media technologies to achieve organizational and political goals:
*[[Facebook]] was the social media site of choice with all but one group noting that they use the site to connect with citizens. 
*[[Twitter]] was also popular with all but two groups saying that they use Twitter. 
*Other social media being used included [[YouTube]], [[LinkedIn]], [[wiki]]s, [[Flickr]], [[Jumo]], [[Diigo]], [[Tumblr]], [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]], [[Identi.ca]], [[Picasa]], and [[Vimeo]]. 
As noted in the study, "while some groups raised doubts about social media’s ability to overcome the limitations of weak ties and generational gaps, an overwhelming majority of groups see social media as essential to contemporary advocacy work and laud its [[democratizing]] function."<ref name="Advocacy 2.0" />
