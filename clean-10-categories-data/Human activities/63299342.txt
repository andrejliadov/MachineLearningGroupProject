You can help by [{{fullurl:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|action=edit}} expanding it] with [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliably sourced]] entries that were longer walks, runs or wheelchair expeditions than the shortest ones listed.}}

This is a list of the '''longest walks''' that have occurred in groups and on solo or duo projects. Many have promoted social causes or medical conditions. Some have been done mostly for the experience.

Groups consist of three or more people who walked at least most of the entire distance. Solo/duo walks are one or two people. The difference is that the former is tougher to organise logistically, especially when crossing international borders, since there generally needs to be greater accommodations and more thorough approvals for a group. There is also a tougher process of decision making with even a small group than with one or two people. Some people walking in groups say that the walking part can be easier than dealing with group politics and dynamics.

The walks should be continuous, save for a few weeks to organise through other countries. There is a separate section for long runs and wheelchair expeditions that were not walks.

== Longest group walks ==
These were walks involving three or more long-distance participants.

* '''Miles walked per month:''' {{convert|368|mi}}
* '''Details:''' A [[Walk of the People – A Pilgrimage for Life]] called for an end to the [[Cold War]] with better relations between the U.S. and former [[Soviet Union]].

It was the only walk from the U.S. to Moscow that went through the Deep South, Northern Ireland, and Hungary, so that added to the mileage.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.apnews.com/7ba3f8625c2931f93edb4a112db1c95e|title=U.S. Peace Activists Denied East German Visas - Associated Press|date=September 12, 1985|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}</ref>
