The '''National Office for Veterans and Victims of War''' ({{lang-fr|'''Office national des anciens combattants et victimes de guerre'''}} ('''ONACVG''') ) is a French governmental agency under the [[Ministry of the Armed Forces (France)|Ministry of the Armed Forces]]. Its purpose is recognition and support of the nation's war veterans and victims, and directing national policy about war memorials and remembrances.

The current agency is the successor to the veteran's organisation first set up in 1916 during the [[First World War]]. It underwent several mergers with related veterans and war victims organisations. Its charter was expanded to include victims of terrorist incidents following the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]].

The first office to be created was the National Office of Disabled and Discharged War Veterans created by ministerial decree on {{date|2 March 1916}}, during the First World War.<ref name="Archives-ONAC">{{cite web |language=fr |last1= |first1= |title=Office national des anciens combattants et victimes de guerre (ONAC) 1917-1998 (FranceArchives) |trans-title=National Office for Veterans and Victims of War (ONAV) 1917-1998 |url=https://francearchives.fr/findingaid/70672ad853e27942b990403a43a7782a6b84c1a8 |date=2005-02-06 |website=FranceArchives |publisher=Service interministériel des Archives de France |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=2019-04-06 |quote= }}</ref> At the outset the latter was an interagency autonomous public institution managed by a Board of Directors.

During the years 1933 and 1934, successive mergers of the three organisations created the National Office of Veterans, Disabled, War Victims, and Wards of the Nation. In 1946 this organisation took over the management of social services of the Ministry of Prisoners, Deportees and Refugees and was renamed the National Office of Veterans and Victims of War. Since 1991, it also handles assistance to victims of terrorism.

* Recognition on behalf of the Nation towards people affected by the war. It allocates recognition of their status and to the entitlements that go along with it via local services, id cards, and documents.
* Social action, as expressed by administrative assistance, by implementation of the status of Ward of the Nation by financing the cost of professional retraining, and by assistance for French citizens living abroad.
* Operation of the policy of memorials and historical preservation developed by the Armed Forces.  The actions of the Office are geared towards celebrating, sharing, and conveying the memory of contemporary conflicts and the values of the [[French Republic|Republic]].
