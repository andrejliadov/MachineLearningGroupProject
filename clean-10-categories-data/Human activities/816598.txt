The '''Protestant work ethic''', the '''Calvinist work ethic''',<ref>The Idea of Work in Europe from Antiquity to Modern Times by Catharina Lis</ref> or the '''Puritan work ethic'''<ref>{{cite book |last=Ryken |first=Leland |date=2010 |title=Worldly Saints: The Puritans As They Really Were |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox7aNVgljlMC&pg=PT51 |publisher=Harper Collins |pages=51– |isbn=978-0-310-87428-7}}</ref> is a [[work ethic]] concept in [[theology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]] and [[history]] which emphasizes that hard work, discipline, and [[frugality]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Protestant Ethic|url=http://mb-soft.com/believe/txn/protesta.htm|website=Believe: Religious Information Source}}</ref> are a result of a person's subscription to the values espoused by the [[Protestantism|Protestant faith]], particularly [[Calvinism]].

The phrase was initially coined in 1904–1905{{efn|No exact date is known and appeared to the public with the publication of his book in 1905.}} by [[Max Weber]] in his book ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|orig-year=First published 1905|translator-first=Talcott|translator-last=Parsons|date=2003|publisher=Dover| location=New York|isbn=9780486122373}}</ref> Weber asserted that Protestant ethics and values along with the Calvinist doctrine of [[asceticism]] and [[predestination]] gave birth to capitalism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tutor2u.net/sociology/reference/sociology-weber-calvinism-and-spirit-of-modern-capitalism|title=Weber, Calvinism and the Spirit of Modern…|date=March 22, 2020|website=tutor2u}}</ref> It is one of the most influential and cited books in sociology although the thesis presented has been controversial since its release. In opposition to Weber, historians such as [[Fernand Braudel]] and [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] assert that the Protestant work ethic did not create [[capitalism]] and that capitalism developed in pre-Reformation Catholic communities. Just as priests and caring professionals are deemed to have a [[vocation]] (or "calling" from God) for their work, according to the Protestant work ethic the lowly workman also has a noble vocation which he can fulfil through dedication to his work.

== Basis in Protestant theology ==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
{{Further|Grace (Christianity)|Good works}}
Protestants, beginning with [[Martin Luther]], reconceptualized worldly work as a duty which benefits both the individual and society as a whole. Thus, the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] idea of [[good works]] was transformed into an obligation to consistently work diligently as a sign of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]]. Whereas Catholicism teaches that good works are required of Catholics as a necessary manifestation of the faith they received, and that faith apart from works is dead (James 2:14–26) and barren, the Calvinist theologians taught that only those who were [[Predestination|predestined]] to be saved would be saved.

Since it was impossible to know who was predestined, the notion developed that it might be possible to discern that a person was [[Unconditional election|elect]] (predestined) by observing their way of life. Hard work and frugality were thought to be two important consequences of being one of the elect. Protestants were thus attracted to these qualities and supposed to strive for reaching them.

==American political history==
Writer [[Frank Chodorov]] argued that the Protestant ethic was long considered indispensable for American political figures:
{{quote|
There was a time, in these United States, when a candidate for public office could qualify with the electorate only by fixing his birthplace in or near the "log cabin." He may have acquired a competence, or even a fortune, since then, but it was in the tradition that he must have been born of poor parents and made his way up the ladder by sheer ability, self-reliance, and perseverance in the face of hardship. In short, he had to be "self made." The so-called Protestant Ethic then prevalent held that man was a sturdy and responsible individual, responsible to himself, his society, and his God. Anybody who could not measure up to that standard could not qualify for public office or even popular respect. One who was born "with a silver spoon in his mouth" might be envied, but he could not aspire to public acclaim; he had to live out his life in the seclusion of his own class.<ref>{{cite web| first=Frank|last=Chodorov|author-link=Frank Chodorov|url=https://mises.org/daily/5031/The-Radical-Rich |title=The Radical Rich|website=Mises Daily Articles|publisher=[[Mises Institute]]|date=21 March 2011}}</ref>
}}

Some political scientists have described the term as a myth invented to assert [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]] superiority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/the-myth-of-the-protestant-work-ethic/|title=The Myth of the Protestant Work Ethic|first=John|last=Starke}}</ref> Many have connected this belief to racism.<ref>{{Cite document|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Protestant-work-ethic's-relation-to-intergroup-and-Rosenthal-Levy/6d75a317aeb8db7d17fd02505d427beff4990fe7|title=Protestant work ethic's relation to intergroup and policy attitudes: A meta-analytic review &#124; Semantic Scholar|year=2011|doi=10.1002/EJSP.832|s2cid=33949400}}</ref> For example, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] said:
{{quote|We have deluded ourselves into believing the myth that capitalism grew and prospered out of the Protestant ethic of hard work and sacrifice. The fact is that capitalism was built on the exploitation and suffering of black slaves and continues to thrive on the exploitation of the poor — both black and white, here and abroad.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-12-04/smiley-capitalism-has-always-been-built-back-poor-both-black-and-white|title=Smiley: Capitalism has always been built on the back of the poor — both black and white|website=Public Radio International}}</ref>}}

==Support==
There has been a revitalization of Weber's interest, including the work of [[Lawrence Harrison (academic)|Lawrence Harrison]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]], and [[David Landes]]. In a ''[[New York Times]]'' article, published on June 8, 2003, [[Niall Ferguson]] pointed that data from the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) seems to confirm that "the experience of Western Europe in the past quarter-century offers an unexpected confirmation of the Protestant ethic. To put it bluntly, we are witnessing the decline and fall of the Protestant work ethic in Europe. This represents the stunning triumph of secularization in Western Europe—the simultaneous decline of both Protestantism and its unique work ethic."<ref>{{cite news|first=Niall|last=Ferguson|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/08/weekinreview/the-world-why-america-outpaces-europe-clue-the-god-factor.html |title=The World; Why America Outpaces Europe (Clue: The God Factor) |work=The New York Times |date=8 June 2003 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}</ref>

==Criticism==
{{See also|The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism#Criticism}}

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] argued that [[capitalism]] began in [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy in the 14th century]], not in the Protestant areas of Europe.<ref>{{Citation |title=History of Economic Analysis |first=Joseph A. |last=Schumpeter |oclc=269819 |isbn=978-0-415-10888-1 |pages=74–75 |chapter=Part II From the Beginning to the First Classical Situation (to about 1790), chapter 2 The scholastic Doctors and the Philosophers of Natural Law|year=1994 }}. In the footnote, Schumpeter refers to {{cite book |first=Abbott Payson |last=Usher |title=The Early History of Deposit Banking in Mediterranean Europe |year=1943 |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002870348|publisher=Harvard university press |series=Harvard economic studies; v. 75 }} and {{cite journal |last=de Roover |first=Raymond |date=December 1942 |title=Money, Banking, and Credit in Medieval Bruges |journal=Journal of Economic History |volume=2, supplement S1 |pages=52–65 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700083431}}</ref>  Other factors that further developed the European market economy included the strengthening of [[property right]]s and lowering of [[transaction cost]]s with the decline and monetization of [[feudalism]], and the increase in real [[wage]]s following the epidemics of [[bubonic plague]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Voigtlander|first1=Nico|last2=Voth|first2=Hans-Joachim|title=The Three Horsemen of Riches: Plague, War, and Urbanization in Early Modern Europe|url=http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/nico.v/Research/Horsemen.pdf|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|date=9 October 2012|volume=80|issue=2|pages=774–811|doi=10.1093/restud/rds034|hdl=10230/778|citeseerx=10.1.1.303.2638}}</ref>

Economists Sascha Becker and [[Ludger Wößmann]] have posited an alternate theory, claiming that the literacy gap between Protestants (as a result of the [[Reformation]]) and Catholics was sufficient explanation for the economic gaps, and that the "results hold when we exploit the initial concentric dispersion of the Reformation to use distance to Wittenberg as an instrument for Protestantism".<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=Sascha O.|last2=Woessmann|first2=Ludger|date=May 2009|title=Was Weber Wrong? A Human Capital Theory of Protestant Economic History *|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=124|issue=2|pages=531–596|doi=10.1162/qjec.2009.124.2.531|hdl=1893/1653|s2cid=3113486|issn=0033-5533|hdl-access=free}}</ref> However, they also note that, between Luther (1500) and [[Prussia]] [[Franco-Prussian War|during the Franco-Prussian War]] (1871), the limited data available has meant that the period in question is regarded as a "black box" and that only "some cursory discussion and analysis" is possible.<ref>Becker, Wossmann (2007) page A5 Appendix B</ref>

Historian [[Fernand Braudel]] wrote that "all historians" opposed the "tenuous theory" of Protestant Ethic, despite not being able to entirely quash the theory "once and for all". Braudel continues to remark that the "northern countries took over the place that earlier had been so long and brilliantly been occupied by the old capitalist centers of the Mediterranean. They invented nothing, either in technology or business management".<ref>[[Fernand Braudel|Braudel, Fernand]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IRukAQAACAAJ Afterthoughts on Material Civilization and Capitalism]''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press (1977).</ref>

Social scientist [[Rodney Stark]] commented that "during their critical period of economic development, these northern centers of capitalism were Catholic, not Protestant", with the [[Reformation]] still far off in the future. Furthermore, he also highlighted the conclusions of other historians, noting that, compared to Catholics, Protestants were "not more likely to hold the high-status capitalist positions", that Catholic Europe did not lag in its industrial development compared to Protestant areas, and that even Weber wrote that "fully developed capitalism had appeared in Europe" long before the Reformation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/controversy/protestant-objections/protestant-modernity.html | title=Protestant Modernity}}</ref> As British historian [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] stated, the concept of that "large-scale industrial capitalism was ideologically impossible before the Reformation is exploded by the simple fact that it existed".<ref>Trevor-Roper. 2001.

Andersen ''et al'' found that the location monasteries of the Catholic Order of [[Cistercian]]s, and specifically their density, highly correlated to this work ethic in later centuries;<ref name="anderson">{{cite journal | title = Pre‐Reformation Roots of the Protestant Ethic | first1 = Thomas Barnebeck | last1 = Andersen | first2 =  Jeanet | last2 = Bentzen | first3 = Carl‐Johan | last3 = Dalgaard | first4 = Paul | last4 = Sharp | journal = The Economic Journal |  volume = 127 | issue = 604 | date = September 2017 | pages = 1756–1793 | doi = 10.1111/ecoj.12367 }}</ref> ninety percent of these monasteries were founded before the year 1300 AD.

[[Tshilidzi Marwala]] asserted that the principles of protestant ethic are important for development in Africa and that they should be secularized and used as an alternative to the ethic of [[Prosperity theology|prosperity Christianity]] which advocates miracles as a basis of development. <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2020-11-29-a-protestant-work-ethic-and-not-the-flash-and-glamour-of-prosperity-christianity-is-what-africa-needs/ | title=Protestant Ethic}}</ref>
