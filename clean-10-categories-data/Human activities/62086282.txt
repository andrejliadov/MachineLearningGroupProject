To be '''blown off course''' in the [[sailing ship]] era meant be to diverted by [[Winds in the Age of Sail|unexpected winds]], [[getting lost]] possibly to [[shipwreck]] or to a new destination. In the ancient world, this was especially a great danger before the maturation of the [[Maritime Silk Road]] in the Early Middle Ages, finding expression in the writing of [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2d9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA45|title=Rome and the Indian Ocean Trade from Augustus to the Early Third Century CE|last=Cobb|first=Matthew A.|date=2018-07-26|publisher=BRILL|year=|isbn=9789004376571|location=|pages=45|language=en}}</ref> Even in later eras, the ship could attempt to limit its divergence by [[tacking (sailing)|tacking]] or [[heaving to]], but it was often difficult to keep track by mere [[celestial navigation]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2CTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT793|title=Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia|last=Kleinhenz|first=Christopher|date=2004-08-02|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781135948801|location=|pages=763|language=en}}</ref> before the invention of the [[marine chronometer]] in the late 18th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lW8DYSPa6fEC&pg=PA17|title=Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time|last=Sobel|first=Dava|date=2010-07-05|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=|isbn=9780802779434|location=|pages=14|language=en}}</ref>

A number of "discoveries" during the [[Age of Discovery]] were accidentally found in this way,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9DI9rWxowMC&pg=PA15|title=A Cultural History of the Atlantic World, 1250-1820|last=Thornton|first=John K.|date=2012-09-10|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521727341|location=|pages=15|language=en}}</ref> and the [[serendipity]] of being blown off course is also a common trope in fiction. Accidental discovery may have played a larger role than previously acknowledged in early European colonialism in contrast to the idea of a centrally-planned program as by [[Prince Henry the Navigator]], but it is also thought that the [[Austronesian expansion]] was more directed and purposeful than once thought.
