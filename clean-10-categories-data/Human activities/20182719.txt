Cartoning machines can be divided into two types:
* Horizontal cartoning machines <ref> {{cite patent

A cartoning machine which picks a single piece from stack of folded carton and erects it, fills with a product or bag of products or number of products horizontally through an open end and closes by tucking the end flaps of the carton or applying glue or adhesive. The product might be pushed in the carton either through the mechanical sleeve or by [[Compressed air|pressurized air]]. For many applications however, the products are inserted into the carton manually. This type of Cartoning machine is widely used for packaging [[food]]stuffs, [[confectionery]], [[Pharmaceutical drug|medicine]], [[cosmetics]], sundry goods, etc.

A cartoning machine which erects a folded carton, fills with a product or number of products vertically through an open end and closes by either tucking the end flaps of the carton or applying glue or adhesive, is called an end load cartoning machine.<ref name=Delkor>Delkor Media Library.
