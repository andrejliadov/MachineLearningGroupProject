==Terminology==
The earliest use of the word ''commodification'' in English attested in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates from 1975.<ref>commodification, n.
Second edition, 1989; online version November 2010. <http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/37198>; accessed 6 January 2011.</ref> Use of the concept of commodification became common with the rise of critical discourse analysis in [[semiotics]].<ref>{{Cite web

==Business and economics==
{{see also|Commodity}}
The word ''commodification'', which describes assignment of economic value to something not previously considered in economic terms, is sometimes also used to describe the transformation of the market for a unique, branded product into a market based on undifferentiated products.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

These two concepts are fundamentally different and the business community more commonly uses commoditization to describe the transformation of the market to undifferentiated products through increased competition, typically resulting in decreasing prices. While in economic terms, commoditization is closely related to and often follows from the stage when a market changes from one of [[monopolistic competition]] to one of [[perfect competition]], a product essentially becomes a commodity when customers perceive little or no value difference between brands or versions. {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

[[Commoditization]] can be the desired outcome of an entity in the market, or it can be an unintentional outcome that no party actively sought to achieve. (For example, see [[Xerox#Trademark]].)

According to [[Neoclassical economics|Neo-classical economic theory]], consumers can benefit from commoditization, since perfect competition usually leads to lower prices.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-03-29|title=Three Steps Towards Market Domination|url=https://knowledge.insead.edu/strategy/three-steps-towards-market-domination-4605|access-date=2020-07-27|website=INSEAD Knowledge|language=en}}</ref>  Branded producers often suffer under commoditization, since the value of the brand (and ability to command price premiums) can be weakened.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Surowiecki|first=James|date=1998-01-30|title=The Commoditization Conundrum|language=en-US|work=Slate|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_motley_fool/1998/01/the_commoditization_conundrum.html|access-date=2020-07-27|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>

However, false commoditization can create substantial risk when premier products do have substantial value to offer, particularly in health, safety and security. Examples are counterfeit drugs and generic [[network service]]s (loss of 911).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Commodification and commoditization==
{{wtp|commoditize#Usage_notes|commoditize: Usage notes}}

The terms ''commodification'' and ''commoditization'' are sometimes used synonymously,<ref>''Robert Hartwell Fiske’s Dictionary of Unendurable English: A Compendium of Mistakes in Grammar, Usage, and Spelling with commentary on lexicographers and linguists,'' Robert Hartwell Fiske, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JZqfZfIvtlsC&pg=PA99&dq=commoditize p. 99]</ref> particularly in the sense of this article, to describe the process of making [[Commodity|commodities]] out of anything that was not used to be available for trade previously; compare [[Cultural Anthropology|anthropology]] usage.<ref>Appadurai 1986, also cited in Martha M. Ertman, Joan C. Williams, ''Rethinking commodification'', 2005, in Afterword by Carol Rose, pp. 402–403. This cites various uses of ''commodification'' to mean "become a commodity market", and considers the use of ''commodification'' (Peggy Radin, 1987) and ''commoditization'' (Appadurai 1986) as equivalent.</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Greenwood, D.J. |date=1977 |title=Culture by the Pound: An Anthropological Perspective on Tourism as Cultural Commoditization |journal=Hosts and Guests |editor=V. L. Smith |pages=129–139 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press}}</ref>

However, other authors distinguish them (as done in this article), with ''commodification'' used in social contexts to mean that a non-commercial good has become commercial, typically with connotations of "corrupted by commerce", while ''commoditization'' is used in business contexts to mean when the market for an existing product has become a commodity market, where products are interchangeable and there is heavy price competition. In a quip: "Microprocessors are commoditized. Love is commodified."<ref name="surowiecki">{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/the_motley_fool/1998/01/the_commoditization_conundrum.html |title=The Commoditization Conundrum |author-link=James Surowiecki |first=James |last=Surowiecki |date=1998-01-30 |publisher=Slate |accessdate=2015-08-16 |quote=What corporations fear is the phenomenon now known, rather inelegantly, as "commoditization." What the term means is simply the conversion of the market for a given product into a commodity market, which is characterized by declining prices and profit margins, increasing competition, and lowered barriers to entry. ("Commoditization" is therefore different from "commodification," the word cultural critics use to decry the corruption of higher goods by commercial values. Microprocessors are commoditized. Love is commodified.)}}</ref>

The difference between the terms of commodification (Marxist political theory) and commoditization (business theory) has been drawn by [[James Surowiecki]] (1998)<ref name="surowiecki"/> and [[Douglas Rushkoff]] (2005).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rushkoff.com/2005/09/04/commodified-vs-commoditized/ |title=Commodified vs. Commoditized |accessdate=2008-07-21 |last=Rushkoff |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Rushkoff |date=2005-09-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221213504/http://rushkoff.com/2005/09/04/commodified-vs-commoditized/ |archive-date=21 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In particular, Rushkoff argued that the words ''commodification'' and ''commoditization'' were used to describe the two different processes of the assignment of value to a social good, and the movement towards undifferentiated competition, respectively:

''Commodification'' (beginning early 1950s) is used to describe the process by which something which does not have an economic value is assigned a value and hence how market values can replace other social values. It describes a modification of relationships, formerly untainted by commerce, into commercial relationships in everyday use.

''[[Commoditization]]'' (early 1990s in business theory) is the process by which goods that have economic value and are distinguishable in terms of attributes (uniqueness or brand) end up becoming simple commodities in the eyes of the market or consumers. It is the movement of a market from differentiated to undifferentiated price competition and from monopolistic to perfect competition.

== Cultural commodification ==
American author and feminist [[bell hooks]] thinks about the cultural commodification of race and difference as the dominant culture "eating the other".  To hooks, cultural expressions of Otherness, even revolutionary ones, are sold to the dominant culture for their enjoyment. And any messages of social change are not marketed for their messages but used as a mechanism for the dominant ones to acquire a piece of the "primitive".<ref>hooks, bell 1992. ''Black Looks: Race and Representation'' (South End Press)</ref>  Any interests in past historical culture almost always have a modern twist. According to Mariana Torgovnick:

<blockquote>What is clear now is that the West's fascination with the primitive has to do with its own crises in identity, with its own need to clearly demarcate subject and object even while flirting with other ways of experiencing the universe.<ref>Torgovnick, Marianna 1991. ''Gone Primitive: Savage Intellects, Modern Lives'' (Chicago)</ref></blockquote>

hooks states that marginalized groups are seduced by this concept because of "the promise of recognition and reconciliation".

<blockquote>When the dominant culture demands that the Other be offered as sign that progressive political change is taking place, that the American Dream can indeed be inclusive of difference, it invites a resurgence of essentialist cultural nationalism.</blockquote>

Commodification of indigenous cultures refers to "areas in the life of a community which prior to its penetration by tourism have not been within the domain of economic relations regulated by criteria of market exchange” (Cohen 1988, 372). An example of this type of cultural commodification can be described through viewing the perspective of Hawaiian cultural change since the 1950s. A Hawaiian Luau, which was once a traditional performance reserved for community members and local people, but through the rise of tourism, this tradition has lost part of its cultural meaning and is now mostly a "for profit" performance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Erik|date=1988|title=Authenticity and commodification in tourism|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=15|issue=3|pages=371–386|doi=10.1016/0160-7383(88)90028-X}}</ref>

Digital commodification is when a business or corporation uses information from an online community without their knowledge for profit. The commodification of information allows a higher up authority to make money rather than a collaborative system of free thoughts.

==In Marxist theory==
{{see also|Commodity (Marxism)}}
The Marxist understanding of ''commodity'' is distinct from its meaning in business. Commodity played a key role throughout [[Karl Marx]]'s work; he considered it a cell-form of [[capitalism]] and a key starting point for an analysis of this politico-economic system.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/94847331/Prodnik-Jernej-A-Note-on-the-Ongoing-Processes-of-Commodification-From-the-Audience-Commodity-to-the-Social-Factory |title=A Note on the Ongoing Processes of Commodification: From the Audience Commodity to the Social Factory |author=Prodnik, Jernej (2012) |work=triple-C: Cognition, Communication, Co-operation (Vol. 10, No. 2) - special issue "Marx is Back" (edited by Christian Fuchs and Vincent Mosco)|pages= 274–301 |accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref> Marx extensively criticized the social impact of commodification under the name [[commodity fetishism]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#S4|author=Marx, Karl |date=1867 |title=Capital: A Critique of Political Economy, Vol. 1, Chapter 1, Section 3 The Form of Value or Exchange-Value, Part 4 The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret thereof |publisher=Progress Press, Moscow}}</ref>
