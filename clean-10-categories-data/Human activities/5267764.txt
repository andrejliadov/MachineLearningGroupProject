Bacteria are microorganisms and they are useful to us. 
Bacteria are economically important as these [[microbes in human culture|microorganisms are used by humans]] for many purposes. The beneficial uses of bacteria include the production of traditional foods such as yogurt, cheese, and vinegar. Microbes are also important in agriculture for the compost and fertilizer production. Bacteria are used in genetic engineering and genetic changes.

===Biotechnology===
{{main|Biotechnology}}

[[Biotechnology]] involves the use of microorganisms including bacteria and fungi in the manufacturing and services industries. These include chemical manufacturing such as [[ethanol]], [[acetone]], [[organic acid]], [[enzyme]]s, and [[perfume]]s.  Bacteria are important in the production of many [[dietary supplements]] and [[pharmaceuticals]].  For example, ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' is used for commercial preparation of [[riboflavin]] and [[vitamin K]].<ref name=Astrologist>{{cite book|last=Astrologist|first=VB|title=Modern Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_ooNitL-pkC&pg=SA11-PA50|year=1997|publisher=Pitambar Publishing|isbn=978-81-209-0442-2|page=11}}</ref>  ''E. coli'' is also used to produce [[D-amino acids]] such as D-p-hydroxyphenylglycine, an important intermediate for synthesis of the antibiotic [[amoxicillin]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|title = Production of fine chemicals using biocatalysis|journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology|date = 1999|pages = 595–603| volume = 10 | issue = 6 |pmid =10600695|doi =10.1016/S0958-1669(99)00040-3|first = A|last = Liese|first2 = MV|last2 = Filho}}</ref>

===Genetic engineering===
[[File:Inzulín.jpg|thumb|right|A vial of [[insulin]]]]
{{main|Genetic engineering}}
[[Genetic engineering]] is the manipulation of genes. It is also called recombinant DNA technology. In genetic engineering, pieces of DNA ([[genes]]) are introduced into a host by a variety of techniques, one of the earliest being the use of a virus vector. The foreign DNA becomes a permanent feature of the host, and is replicated and passed on to daughter cells along with the rest of its DNA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/how-does-gm-differ-from-conventional-plant-breeding/|title=How does GM differ from conventional plant breeding?|website=royalsociety.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref> Bacterial cells are transformed and used in production of commercially important products.

===Fibre retting===
[[File:Morsan Tauröste.jpg|thumb|Dew [[retting]] of flax]]
{{main|Retting}}

Bacteria such as ''[[Clostridium butyricum]]'' are used to separate fibres of [[jute]], [[hemp]] and [[flax]] in the process of [[retting]]. The plants are immersed in water and when they swell, inoculated with bacteria which hydrolyze pectic substances of the cell walls and separate the fibres. Alternatively, the plants are spread out on the ground and ret naturally because [[dew]] provides moisture. These separated fibres are used to make ropes, sacks etc.<ref name=Rastogi>{{cite book|last=Rastogi|first=VB|title=Modern Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E_ooNitL-pkC&pg=SA11-PA50|year=1997|publisher=Pitambar Publishing|isbn=978-81-209-0442-2|page=11}}</ref>

===Pest control===
{{main|Pest control}}
Bacteria can also be used in the place of [[pesticide]]s in [[biological pest control]]. This commonly uses ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (BT), a Gram-positive, soil-dwelling bacterium. This bacterium is used as a [[Lepidoptera]]n-specific [[insecticide]] under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as [[environmentally friendly]], with little effect on [[human]]s, [[wildlife]], [[pollinator]]s, or other [[beneficial insect]]s.<ref name="pmid12598644">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wei JZ, Hale K, Carta L, Platzer E, Wong C, Fang SC, Aroian RV | title = ''Bacillus thuringiensis'' crystal proteins that target nematodes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2760–5 | date = 2003 | pmid = 12598644 | pmc = 151414 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0538072100 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2760W }}</ref>

===Digestion===
{{further|Gut flora}}

Bacteria living in the gut of cattle, horses and other herbivores, for example ''[[Ruminococcus]]'' [[species|spp.]], help to digest [[cellulose]] by secreting the enzyme [[cellulase]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|title = The Ruminococci: key symbionts of the gut ecosystem|journal = Journal of Microbiology|date = 2018|pages = 199–208| volume = 56 | issue = 3 |pmid =29492877|doi =10.1007/s12275-018-8024-4|first = AJ|last = La Reau|first2 = G|last2 = Suen}}</ref>  This is how herbivores are able to get the energy they need from grass and other plants.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/z2d2gdm|title=What is cellulose?|publisher=BBC |access-date=14 September 2019}}</ref>

Also, ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', part of the [[Gut flora|intestinal microbiota]] of humans and other herbivorous animals, converts consumed food into [[Vitamin K|vitamin K<sub>2</sub>]].  This is absorbed in the [[Colon (organ)|colon]] and, in [[animal model]]s, is sufficient to meet their daily requirement of the vitamin.<ref name=:2>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bentley R, Meganathan R | title = Biosynthesis of vitamin K (menaquinone) in bacteria | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–80 | date = 1982 | pmid = 6127606 | pmc = 281544 | url = http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6127606 }}</ref>

===Tanning Of Leather===
Bacteria helps purify animal hides to make them easy, clean, and fit for use.

===Medicines===
Bacteria are used to create multiple antibiotics such as Streptomycin from the bacteria streptococcus. Bacteria can also be used to create vaccines to prevent several diseases.

==Harmful bacteria==

Some bacteria are harmful and act either as disease-causing agents ([[pathogen]]s) both in plants and animals, or may play a role in food spoilage.

===Agents of disease===

[[Plant disease]]s caused by bacteria are commercially important worldwide for [[agriculture]]. Besides bacterial pathogens that are already established in many areas, there are many instances of pathogens moving to new geographic areas or even the emergence of new pathogen variants. In addition, bacterial plant pathogens are difficult to control because of the shortage of chemical control agents for bacteria.<ref name= JacksonRW>{{cite book | editor=Jackson, RW | title=Plant Pathogenic Bacteria: Genomics and Molecular Biology | publisher=Caister Academic Press | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-904455-37-0 }}</ref>

===[[Food]] spoilage===
{{Main|Food spoilage}}
[[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprotrophic]] bacteria attack and decompose organic matter. This characteristic has posed a problem to mankind as food such as stored grains, meat, fish, vegetable and fruits are attacked by saprotrophic bacteria and spoiled. Similarly milk and products are easily contaminated by bacteria and spoiled.<ref name=":food spoilage 1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.foodsafety.gov/blog/2016/02/what-is-food-spoilage.html|title=What is Food Spoilage?|date=2016-03-08|website=www.foodsafety.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>
