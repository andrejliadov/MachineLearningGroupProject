== Definition of artistic freedom ==
[[File:Freedom Ranking World.svg|center|frameless|722x722px]]
Repeatedly, the terms ''artistic freedom'' and ''freedom of artistic expressions'' are used as synonyms. Their underlying concepts "[[art]]", "[[freedom]]" and "expression"  comprise very vast fields of discussion: "Art is a very 'subtle' - sometimes also symbolic - form of expression, suffering from definition problems more than any other form."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polymenopoulou|first=Eleni|date=September 2016|title=Does One Swallow Make a Spring?

It includes the right of all citizens to have access to these works and is essential for the wellbeing of societies."<ref name=":2" /> UNESCO puts forth that "artistic freedom embodies a bundle of rights protected under international law."<ref name=":2" /> These include:<ref name=":9" />

* The right to create without censorship or intimidation;
* The right to have artistic work supported, distributed and remunerated;
* The right to freedom of movement;
* The right to freedom of association;
* The right to the protection of social and economic rights;
* The right to participate in cultural life.

== Legal frameworks to protect and promote artistic freedom ==
[[File:Attacks on artistic expression.svg|frameless|448x448px|alt=|right]]

Legal frameworks to protect and promote artistic freedom reflect the conviction that "[c]ulture constitutes one process of, and space for, democratic debate. The freedom of artistic expression forms its backbone. There is compelling evidence that participation in culture also promotes democratic participation as well as empowerment and well-being of our citizens."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.norden.org/en/declaration/declaration-nordic-ministers-culture-promoting-diversity-cultural-expressions-and|title=Declaration by the Nordic Ministers of Culture on Promoting Diversity of Cultural Expressions and Artistic Freedom in a Digital Age|website=Nordic cooperation|language=en|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref> Farida Shaheed wrote: "Artists may entertain people, but they also contribute to social debates, sometimes bringing counter-discourses and potential counterweights to existing power centres."<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/755488?ln=en|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur in the Field of Cultural Rights, Farida Shaheed : the right to freedom of artistic expression and creativity|last=Shaheed|first=Farida|date=14 March 2013}}</ref> Moreover, she emphasized that "the vitality of artistic creativity is necessary for the development of vibrant cultures and the functioning of democratic societies. Artistic expressions and creations are an integral part of cultural life,which entails contesting meanings and revisiting culturally inherited ideas and concepts."<ref name=":3" /> According to Freemuse, "[p]opulists and nationalists, who often portray human rights as a limitation on what they claim is the will of the majority, are on the rise globally. As this phenomenon rises, artists continue to play an important role in expressing alternative visions for society."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freemuse.org/resources/art-under-threat-in-2016/art-under-threat-in-2016/|title=Art Under Threat in 2016|website=Freemuse|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> This is why "artists are sometimes responsible for radical criticism."<ref name=":5" /> As a result, artistic expressions and artists are suffering censorship and violations worldwide.  <blockquote>"Artists are among the first to be silenced by repressive regimes: the poets, playwrights and painters who challenge the status quo are often lone workers, and as such easy targets for an authoritarian state or violent oppressor. When their views fail to accord with the mainstream, the artist is also vulnerable to the censorship of the mob. That is why it is vital that artistic expression is protected."<ref name=":2" /></blockquote>
[[File:Serious attacks by art form.svg|right|frameless|279x279px]]
Freemuse's 2016 report "Arts under threat" shows that "[i]t is not only governments violating the right to artistic freedom. 2016 saw a worrying amount of actions by non-state actors, ranging from militant extremists to peaceful community groups, against art and artists.

==== Artistic freedom as a pillar of the right to freedom of expression ====
The following legal instruments do not specifically mention artistic freedom but rather understand it as a pillar of freedom of expression in general related to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. They aim to guarantee the right to [[freedom of expression]] or the right to participate in cultural life without specific reference to the arts.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":1" />

*Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR);
* Article 9 of the [[European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]];
* Article 9 and 17 of the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]];
* Article 32 of the [[Arab Charter on Human Rights]];
* The right "to seek and develop cultural knowledge and expressions and to share them with others, as well as to act creatively and take part in creative activity" formulated by the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]];
*Article 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR).

=== UNESCO instruments ===

==== 1980 UNESCO Recommendation Concerning the Status of the Artist ====
Artistic freedom first appeared as a distinct right in UNESCO's [[1980 Recommendation concerning the Status of the Artist]] underlining "the essential role of art in the life and development of the individual and of society' and the duty of States to protect and defend artistic freedom."<ref name=":0" /> Although not a binding instrument, the Recommendation is an important reference in defining artists' rights across the spectrum worldwide. The 1980 Recommendation serves as a reference for policy development and as a basis for new formulations of cultural policies.<blockquote>"Member States, recognizing the essential role of art in the life and development of the individual and of society, accordingly have a duty to protect, defend and assist artists and their freedom of creation. For this purpose, they should take all necessary steps to stimulate artistic creativity and the flowering of talent, in particular by adopting measures to secure greater freedom for artists, without which they cannot fulfill their mission, and to improve their status by acknowledging their right to enjoy the fruits of their work."<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=UNESCO|date=Fall 1980|title=Recommendation concerning the Status of the Artist|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000114029.page=144|journal=Records of the General Conference, 21st Session, Belgrade|volume=V. 1 "Resolutions"|pages=147–156|via=UNESCO}}</ref></blockquote>

==== 2005 UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions ====
{{main|Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions}}

The [[Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions|2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]] acknowledges that "the diversity of cultural expressions can only be promoted if human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/creativity/files/investing-creativity|title=Investing in Creativity|website=Diversity of Cultural Expressions|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref> A guiding principle of the 2005 Convention is that "cultural diversity can be protected and promoted only if human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression, information and communication, as well as the ability of individuals to choose cultural expressions, are guaranteed."<ref name=":2" /> In this context, governance of culture refers to policies and measures governments establish to promote and to protect all forms of [[creativity]] and artistic expressions. The most recent UNESCO Convention in the field of culture and ratified by 146 Parties, it frames the formulation and implementation of different types of legislative, regulatory, institutional and financial interventions to promote the emergence of diverse cultural and [[Creative industries|creative industry]] sectors around the world. As a result, it aims to ensure participation in cultural life and to support access to diverse cultural expressions ([[film]], [[music]], [[performing arts]], etc.). The progress and challenges in implementing the Convention is monitored through its Global Report Series [[Reshaping Cultural Policies|Re{{!}}Shaping Cultural Policies]].<ref name=":2" />

=== National legislative measures to promote artistic freedom ===
{{See also|Freedom of speech by country}}Similar to the aforementioned universal instruments to protect artists and artistic freedom, "[i]n national constitutions (...), freedom of artistic creativity is often located within the strongly-protected right to freedom of expression."<ref name=":1" /> Certain countries also "recognize the freedom of artistic expression within the ambit of the right to science and culture."<ref name=":1" /> The following national legislative measures are listed in alphabetical order. The list is to be completed.

==== Burkina Faso ====

Adopted on 23 May 2013 by "Direction générale des arts (DGA)", the decree "Décret portant statut de l'artiste au [[Burkina Faso]]" envisages improving the social protection and the living conditions of artists, particularly the social security of employed artists and freelancers, the return of social contributions of artists and the complement dispositive for mutual accountability.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Direction générale des arts (DGA)|title=Décret N° 2013-169 /PRES/PM/MCT/MEF /MFPTSS portant statut de l'artiste au Burkina Faso|url=https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/SERIAL/97962/116413/F1100956330/BFA-97962.pdf|journal=Journal Officiel |date=2013-05-23|issue=21}}</ref>

==== France ====

In July 2016, [[France]] amended its [[Law of France|legislation]] in order to extend it with the legal protection of artistic freedom, [[architecture]] and [[Cultural heritage|heritage]]. For the first time in international law, artistic expressions are established as public goods and the "dissemination of artistic creation is free". This implies not only that artists are free to create but also that the wider [[public]] has access to it.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/creativity/files/artistic-freedom-leaflet|title=Artistic Freedom Leaflet|website=Diversity of Cultural Expressions|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> As a result, art and artistic expressions cannot be censored or simply excluded from exhibits and other events.

==== Germany ====

Article 5 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|German Basic Law]] contains a special paragraph that connects the right to freedom of expression with the right to freely develop the arts and sciences."<ref name=":1" />

==== Mexico ====

On 19 June 2017, [[Mexico]] published its "Ley General de Cultura y Derechos Culturales"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5545309&fecha=29/11/2018|title=DOF - Diario Oficial de la Federación|website=dof.gob.mx|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref> promising strong protection for artistic freedom and artists and cultural professionals, a provision specifically needed given the alarming conditions under which Mexican artists, journalists and cultural professionals currently work.<ref name=":8" />

==== Spain ====

On 6 September 2018, the [[Congress of Deputies|Spanish Congress of Deputies]] unanimously ratified a proposal assigned to elaborate a "Estatuto del Artista y del Profesional de la Cultura". Broadly, the decree aims to protect and promote artists with regard to taxation, their work security and legal protection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boe.es/eli/es/rdl/2018/12/28/26|title=Real Decreto-ley 26/2018, de 28 de diciembre, por el que se aprueban medidas de urgencia sobre la creación artística y la cinematografía|website=www.boe.es|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eldiario.es/cultura/politicas_culturales/Congreso-unanimidad-artistas-compatibilizar-creacion_0_859864966.html|title=El Congreso aprueba por unanimidad que los artistas puedan compatibilizar la pensión con la creación|last=Cultura|first=Eldiarioes|website=eldiario.es|language=es|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref>

==== Sweden ====

Article 1 (2) of the [[Law of Sweden|Swedish Fundamental Law]] explicitly includes the freedom of artistic creation as part of the key purposes of freedom of expression: "The purpose of freedom of expression under this Fundamental Law is to secure the free exchange of opinion, free and comprehensive information, and freedom of artistic creation."<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/sw04000_.html|title=ICL - Sweden -- Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression|website=www.servat.unibe.ch|access-date=2019-03-05}}</ref>

==== Togo ====

On 20 June 2016, [[Togo]] adopted its "Statut de l'artiste". Its major objective is to acknowledge artists as individuals and their moral role in society, their contributions towards the intellectual sphere protected by copyright. It defines the rights and duties linked to artistic professions and aims to promote creativity and to protect artists socially.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ministère des Arts et de la Culture Togolais|date=2016|title=Loi n° 2016 - 012 portant statut de l'artiste|url=http://jo.gouv.tg/sites/default/files/publications/LOI_2016_012.pdf|journal=Journal Officiel de la République Togolaise 61|volume=N° 21}}</ref>

==== Tunisia ====

Adopted in 2014, article 42 of the [[Constitution of Tunisia|Tunisian Constitution]] states: "The right to culture is guaranteed. The freedom of creative expression is guaranteed. The State encourages cultural creativity and supports the strengthening of national culture, its diversity and renewal, in promoting the values of tolerance, rejection of violence, openness to different cultures and dialogue between civilizations."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/quotes/constitution-of-tunisia-article-42-culture|title=Constitution of Tunisia, Article 42: Culture|last=University|first=Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221065857/https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/quotes/constitution-of-tunisia-article-42-culture|archive-date=2020-02-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==== United States of America ====

In the [[United States|U.S.]], the [[first amendment]] protects artistic expression.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech/artistic-expression|title=Artistic Expression}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> According to the Court, freedom of artistic creativity is an element of the respect for freedom of self-expression, one of the core values of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].<ref name=":1" /> However, the U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has never considered artistic freedom as a distinct category akin to political or commercial speech: "it rather addresses the various forms of art in their relation to the First Amendment on a contextual basis."<ref name=":1" />

== Challenges to artistic freedom ==

The [[International Cities of Refuge Network|International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN)]] explains the purpose of its existence with the following statement:<blockquote>"Writers and artists are especially vulnerable to censorship, [[harassment]], imprisonment and even death, because of what they do. They represent the liberating gift of the human imagination and give voice to thoughts, ideas, debate and critique, disseminated to a wide audience. They also tend to be the first to speak out and resist when free speech is threatened."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icorn.org/about-icorn|title=About ICORN|website=ICORN international cities of refuge network|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Cities of refuge.svg|right|frameless|332x332px]]
Freemuse's report (2018) demonstrates that artistic freedom ''"''is being shut down in every corner of the globe, including in the traditionally democratic West. According to Freemuse's 2016 report, the music industry is the main target of serious violations, and second to film in overall violations, including non-violent censorship.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.iq-mag.net/2017/02/artistic-freedom-threat-2016-freemuse/|title=Artistic freedom under attack in 2016 {{!}} IQ Magazine|date=2017-02-08|work=IQ Magazine|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-GB}}</ref> The most serious violations included the murder of Pakistani Qawwali singer [[Amjad Sabri]] and the killing of Burundi musician [[Pascal Treasury Nshimirimana]].<ref name=":7" /> In 2019, [[Karima Bennoune]], UN Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, underlines that "the freedom of artistic expression and creativity of persons with disabilities, women or older persons"<ref name=":4" /> remains significantly restricted. She states that "many cultural rights actors have not incorporated a gender perspective into their work, while many women's rights advocates have not considered cultural rights issues."<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|url=https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/CulturalRights/A_HRC_40_53_EN.docx|title=Cultural rights: tenth anniversary report.

[[File:Attacks on writers by region.svg|frameless|259x259px|alt=|right]]
Moreover, new digital technologies, including [[social media]] platforms, are challenging artistic freedom: "Art in the online and digital space continues to challenge authorities and corporations who are quick to react by closing down expression rather than using it as an opportunity to foster it."<ref name=":8" /> Social media and [[Streaming media|music streaming]] channels, like [[Instagram]] and [[SoundCloud]] are becoming the platforms on which artists publicly display and promote their work. However, they also bring with them threats to rights and freedoms. [[trolling|Online trolls]] often intimidate artists to withdraw their work.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":8" /> Additionally, growing [[digital surveillance]] has a corrosive effect on artistic freedom.<ref name=":2" /> Many platforms have established mechanisms, such as Instagram's guidelines on 'standards of behavior' whose formulations are very vague. This provides disproportionate power to individuals and organizations who use the platform's reporting processes to get individual artworks removed, and sometimes entire accounts blocked. In addition, the impact of [[algorithm]]s on diversity of content is another area of concern: platforms display a plethora of cultural offerings, but also control not only sales but also communication and the recommendation algorithms (e.g. adapting offered content to the profile of each internet user). These algorithms finally serve to promote certain contents while oppressing others.<ref name=":8" />

In conclusion, new digital technologies - while providing a platform for the distribution of artistic content - may interrupt the flow of ideas of artists and curtail their artistic freedom.

In the 10th Anniversary UN Report on Cultural Rights, [[Ole Reitov]], former exectutive director of Freemuse, underscores the progressive fact that "artistic freedom is no longer a 'marginalized' issue in the 'world of freedom of expression'".<ref name=":4" /> Since Farida Shaheed's report and inspired by lobbying from arts and [[human rights]] [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, efforts to promote artistic freedom have multiplied across the entire [[United Nations]] system: "The UN Universal Periodic Review provides an opportunity for NGOs, among others, to make submissions on States' failures to meet human rights standards, including artistic freedom. New calls for a UN Action Plan on the Safety of Artists and Audiences (similar to the one for journalists) have been put forward."<ref name=":2" /> As UNESCO's Global Report "[[Reshaping Cultural Policies|Re{{!}}shaping Cultural Policies]]" (2018) shows, the number and capacity of organizations monitoring artistic freedom is increasing. "In this domain as well, cities are taking valuable initiatives by providing safe havens for artists at risk."<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /> As the list above shows, "measures to support the economic and social rights of artists are appearing increasingly in national legislation, especially in Africa."<ref name=":2" />

== Monitoring artistic freedom ==
Despite the progress made and legal instruments established to promote and protect freedom of artistic expressions, "there is urgent need for monitoring and surveillance, essential if these freedoms are to become a permanent reality."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mande|first=Hamadou|date=2016|title=Artistic freedom and Cultural Creation in Burkina Faso|url=http://www.arterialnetwork.org/resources/our_publications/awa_e-book_2016|journal=How Free is Free?

Karima Bennoune notes that the increasing number of reported attacks perpetrated by State and non-State actors against cultural professionals reflects the boosting capacity of monitoring artistic freedom.<ref name=":4" /> She states the [[Reshaping Cultural Policies|UNESCO global reports]] monitoring the implementation of the 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of Cultural Expressions have been "[o]f particular relevance".<ref name=":4" /> The reports provide a monitoring framework comprising four overarching goals to enhance cultural policies worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/creativity/convention/monitoring-framework|title=Monitoring Framework|date=2018-02-15|website=Diversity of Cultural Expressions|language=en|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> One of these goals aims to "Promote Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms" and encompasses artistic freedom as an "area of monitoring" incorporating core indicators to measure achievements regarding the rights and protection of artists.<ref name=":4" /> Additionally, the framework relates artistic freedom to the [[Sustainable Development Goal 16|Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16]] of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN 2030 Agenda]], which aims to "'Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels".<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16|title=Goal 16 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> Specifically, the SDG's target 16.10 aims to "ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements".<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":10" />

Additionally, there are many other initiatives advocating and monitoring artistic freedom. Alongside other organizations documenting violations against freedom of artistic expression (such as [[Arterial Network]], [[Artists at Risk Connection]], [[PEN International]] and the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]]), Freemuse is an independent international organization particularly monitoring the freedom of expression of musicians and composers worldwide. "Freemuse's reports collated from all over the world show that artists are increasingly facing censorship, persecution, incarceration or death, because of their work."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mataga|first=Jesmael|date=2016|title=Freedom of Artistic and Creative Expression in Zimbabwe: A Survey of the Legal and Policy Frameworks|url=http://www.arterialnetwork.org/resources/our_publications/awa_e-book_2016|journal=How Free is Free?

In order to monitor the actions taken to implement the 1980 Recommendation concerning the Status of the Artists, the Secretariat of the 2005 UNESCO Convention (see below) runs a global survey every four years gathering information from Members States, NGOs and INGOs and prepares a report, which is then submitted to the General Conference.<ref name=":0" />
