In a '''blind audition''' the identity of the performer is concealed from the judges so as to prevent [[bias]]. The performance takes place behind a curtain so that the judges cannot see the performer. Blind auditions are standard in symphony orchestras. According to a 2001 study by [[Cecilia Rouse]] of Princeton and [[Claudia Goldin]] of Harvard, the introduction of blind auditions to American symphony orchestras increased the probability that a woman would advance from preliminary rounds by 50 percent. Among those symphonies, "about 10 percent of orchestra members were female around 1970, compared to about 35 percent in the mid-1990s." Rouse and Goldin attribute about 30 percent of this gain to the advent of blind auditions, though they admit that their "estimates have large standard errors and at least one persistent effect in the opposite direction."<ref>{{cite web| title=Orchestrating Impartiality: The Impact of "Blind" Auditions on Female Musicians|  first=Claudia|last= Golden | url= https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.90.4.715 | date= September 4, 2000 | work = American Economic Review | accessdate=2019-02-20}}</ref> Jazz bassist and clinical psychologist [[Art Davis]] is known for launching a legal case which led to the current system of blind auditions for orchestras.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003822287_davisobit05.html |title=Art Davis, renowned bassist, dies at 73 |date=August 5, 2007 |publisher=Seattle Times |first=Jocelyn Y. |last=Stewart |work=Los Angeles Times obituary |accessdate=2012-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921072824/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003822287_davisobit05.html |archivedate=2011-09-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Osborne |first=William |url= http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/blind.htm |title=Blind Auditions and Moral Myopia| publisher=osborne-conant.org| accessdate= 2012-12-28}}</ref> In 2010, the competitive talent show ''[[The Voice of Holland]]'' introduced the use of blind auditions to televised talent shows; the format was then quickly franchised to [[The Voice (TV series)#National series|dozens of other countries]]. Similarly '''blind judging''' and '''blind jury''' represent the same premise of an item or person being judged solely on its own merits.
