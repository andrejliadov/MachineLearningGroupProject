'''Disengagement from education''' refers to a situation where a person does not feel included, does not participate in [[Extracurricular activity|school activities]], are not enrolled, or have [[Truancy|poor school attendance]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=UNESCO|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000370912|title=Youth and changing realities: perspectives from Southern Africa|publisher=UNESCO|year=2019|isbn=978-92-3-100334-9|location=|pages=}}</ref> Disengagement from school is linked to individual attitudes or values and can be influenced by peers, family members, the community, the media, and surrounding cultural aspects in general, including the school itself. In the case of girls, specific circumstances contribute to them dropping out of school, such as [[teenage pregnancy]], classroom practices, [[poverty]], illness or [[death]] in the [[family]], [[Child marriage|early marriage]], [[sexual harassment]], and [[peer pressure]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Makwinja-Morara|first=Veronica|date=7 October 2009|title=Female Dropouts in Botswana Junior Secondary Schools|journal=Educational Studies|volume=45|issue=5|pages=440–462|doi=10.1080/00131940903190493|issn=0013-1946}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

Disengagement from school creates barriers for the [[youth]]. School is related not only to the [[future]] of a young person, as a resource for upward mobility and a higher quality of life, but also to the person's current [[well-being]]. When disengaged from the educational system, young people become disconnected and [[Social isolation|isolated]], they feel worthless and incapable of contributing in significant ways in the different domains of their lives such as the family, community or at the national level.<ref name=":0" />

When there is no engagement with school and young people drop out, they become the target of exclusion, not only because of barriers to fostering their skills or reduced chances of finding a formal job, but because they will also likely become victims of [[prejudice]] that will construct them as people with deficiencies in their skills and [[knowledge]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth [ARACY]|year=2008|title=Preventing youth disengagement and promoting engagement|journal=Ustralia, ARACY}}</ref>

== Socio-cultural factors ==

=== Education of girls ===
According to studies, post-basic education is significant for girls and women, but face challenges and difficult choices to continue with schooling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Subrahmanian|first=Ramya|date=July 2005|title=Gender equality in education: Definitions and measurements|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=25|issue=4|pages=395–407|doi=10.1016/j.ijedudev.2005.04.003|issn=0738-0593}}</ref> Many factors influence young women's engagement with the school system, including financial barriers, cultural beliefs, and marital status.<ref name=":0" />

Despite in schools girls and boys are given equal opportunities, there are some factors that affect female students that lead them to disengage from education. Reasons for the disengagement from education by girls are poverty, early marriage, teenage pregnancy, harmful traditional practices like [[initiation rites]], and [[gender-based violence]]. Statistics from UIS show that, in [[Namibia]], girls are less likely to drop out of secondary school than boys (girls 21% compared to boys 23%). However, in [[Malawi]] there are differences between the dropout rates of boys and girls from secondary school (71% female and 66% male).<ref name=":0" />

In [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]], the dropout rates for female and male students are the same. Studies showed that early marriage is the principal reason for girls’ disengagement, along with financial limitations. In Malawi 50% of girls are married by the age of 18, whilst in Zambia 41% of the girls are married before they reach 18. [[Child marriage]] rates in Zimbabwe are at 34% and in Namibia there are low at 7%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.girlsnotbrides.org/where-does-it-happen/|title=Child marriage around the world|last=Brides|first=Girls Not|website=Girls Not Brides|access-date=13 March 2020}}</ref> In Malawi, studies noted that when girls came back from initiation ceremonies they would have missed several weeks of school and some were unlikely to return to school. In Zimbabwe, boys, especially those from [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] origin, missed school whilst attending initiation rites. Traditional [[gender role]]s also affect young women.<ref name=":0" />

=== Economic situation ===
Financial difficulties that young people and their families face are major barriers when considering attending school.<ref name=":0" /> Although primary education is free in several countries, students are also expected to pay for their school supplies, including books and transport to school. This is related to ethnicity, the rural-urban gap and gender, and produce inequalities.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morrow, S, Panday, S. & Richter, L.|title=Where we're at and where we're going: Young people in South Africa in 2005|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=Johannesburg, Umsobomvu Youth Fund|pages=}}</ref> Studies show that, in South Africa, financial barriers is the main obstacle to continuing education for black young people.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Makiwane|first=Monde|last2=Kwizera|first2=Stella|date=22 July 2008|title=Youth and Well-Being: A South African Case Study|journal=Social Indicators Research|volume=91|issue=2|pages=223–242|doi=10.1007/s11205-008-9279-7|issn=0303-8300|doi-access=free}}</ref>

According to [[The World Bank]], geographic inequalities are barriers for education in the world, and are associated with economic disparities stating that people living in poverty are ten times less likely to attend school than their richer counterparts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kuyini|first=Ahmed Bawa|date=1 March 2013|title=Ghana's education reform 2007: A realistic proposition or a crisis of vision?|journal=International Review of Education|volume=59|issue=2|pages=157–176|doi=10.1007/s11159-013-9343-7|issn=0020-8566}}</ref> The price of post-basic education is a challenge for many students. Fees, even at the lower amount, pose a burden to families who struggle to raise enough money to send their children to secondary school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rippleafrica.org/education-in-malawi-africa/general-education-in-malawi-africa|title=General Information about Education in Malaw|last=RIPPLE Africa|year=2014|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

=== Disadvantaged communities, schools and youth ===
Studies show that HIV and AIDS also affect the enrollment of students and the recruitment of teachers in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. This has a negative impact in the quality of education and poses a threat to progress. It reduces the number of teachers and students due to virus-related deaths, and delays efficiency because teaching and learning become more difficult for infected teachers and students. In addition, there is a large number of young [[orphan]]s in the region who lack reliable parental care. This affects their possibility to attend school and complete education.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anangisye, W.A.L.|year=2010|title=Revisiting the alternative responses to the perceived quality 'decline' in basic education in Tanzania.|journal=EDI Journal of Educational Policy|volume= 7| issue =  1|pages=115–138}}</ref>

Poor performance by students from disadvantaged schools traps [[marginalized]] groups in perpetual poverty. The poor performance of students is attributed to poor infrastructure and inadequate learning materials.<ref name=":0" />

=== Families and communities ===
The perception [[Family|families]] may have of education has a negative impact on the uptake of secondary school by young people. Parents tend to encourage children who excel academically and demotivate children who score lower marks. Families that do not offer any support, causes individuals to disengage from education.<ref name=":0" />

The breakdown of the family unit is also a reason of youth disengagement from education. Divorce, death and migration of parents are reasons education is interrupted. Divorce and death may change the financial status of the family, and the educational needs of the children could not be met due to dwindling incomes.<ref name=":0" />

In cases of migration, though the financial situation of a family may have improved, children lacked emotional support and parental motivation. In the absence of parental motivation and support, young people are left to manage on their own the challenges that arise during [[puberty]], and are thus more vulnerable to [[peer pressure]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Culture and religion ===
[[Culture|Cultural]] and religious practices affect both the education of boys and girls. Studies show that it is not only traditional cultural practices that affect young people's education, but also the growth of rural-urban migration which has led to the rise of an alternative urban culture that is affecting the [[youth]]. Youth behaviour is a reason for youth disengagement from education.<ref name=":0" />

Boys in [[Malawi]] as well as some parts of [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]] drop out of school to become part of the Nyao. The initiation into Nyao involves staying in a place where the [[ancestor]]s are buried for a week or longer. These initiation rites in Malawi and Zambia disturbed the education of young boys. Nyao is a cultural practice of [[Chewa people|Chewa]] people who are found mainly in Malawi, as well as parts of Zambia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Although Nyao is a cultural practice in Zimbabwe it has been commercialized with dancers charging money to put up shows. Boys as young as 13 drop out of school to become part of a group of Nyao dancers.<ref name=":0" />

== Addressing disengagement from education ==
Addressing the causes of non-participation in education and training improves leaners' possibilities to engage in the education system and have access to future opportunities. Five elements to consider individuals' engagement with education include:<ref name=":0" />

# Engaging youth about the relevance of education as actors of change, focusing on strategies and opportunities in stressful environments;
# Promoting schools and their [[Curriculum|curricula's]] connections with the students’ communities, and [[Empowerment|empowering]] families in the promotion of education;
# Improving the education of girls through gender-sensitive policies, engagement with communities, and out-of-school programmes;
# Elaborating, implementing and evaluating [[Policy|policies]] and programmes for the education and inclusion of vulnerable and [[marginalized]] youth, with the participation of beneficiaries and communities;
# Developing out-of-school programmes.<ref name=":0" />
