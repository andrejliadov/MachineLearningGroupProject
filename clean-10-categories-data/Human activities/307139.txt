'''Empirical evidence''' is the [[information]] received by means of the [[senses]], particularly by [[observation]] and documentation of patterns and behavior through [[experiment]]ation.<ref>{{harvnb|Pickett|2006|p=585}}</ref> The term comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word for experience, ἐμπειρία (''empeiría''). 

After [[Immanuel Kant]], in [[philosophy]], it is common to call [[knowledge]] gained by means of empirical evidence '''''[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]'' knowledge''' (in contrast to ''[[a priori]]'' knowledge).

==Meaning==
Empirical evidence is information that verifies the [[truth]] (which accurately corresponds to reality) or falsity (inaccuracy) of a claim. In the [[empiricism|empiricist]] view, one can claim to have knowledge only when based on empirical evidence (although some empiricists believe that there are other ways of gaining knowledge). This stands in contrast to the [[rationalism|rationalist]] view under which [[reason]] or reflection alone is considered evidence for the truth or falsity of some [[proposition]]s.<ref name="cdp">{{harvnb|Feldman|2001|p=293}}</ref> Empirical evidence is information acquired by observation or experimentation, in the form of recorded [[data]], which may be the subject of analysis (e.g. by scientists). This is the primary source of empirical evidence. Secondary sources describe, discuss, interpret, comment upon, analyze, evaluate, summarize, and process primary sources. Secondary source materials can be articles in newspapers or popular magazines, book or movie reviews, or articles found in scholarly journals that discuss or evaluate someone else's original research.<ref name="cdp"/>

In a second sense "'''empirical'''" in science may be synonymous with "experimental."  In this sense, an empirical result is an experimental observation.  In this context, the term '''''semi-empirical''''' is used for qualifying theoretical methods that use, in part, basic [[axiom]]s or postulated scientific laws and experimental results. Such methods are opposed to theoretical ''[[ab initio]]'' methods, which are purely [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] and based on [[first principle]]s.  Typical examples of both ''ab initio'' and [[semi-empirical method]]s can be found in [[computational chemistry]].

In [[science]], empirical evidence is required for a [[hypothesis]] to gain acceptance in the [[scientific community]]. Normally, this validation is achieved by the [[scientific method]] of forming a hypothesis, [[design of experiments|experimental design]], [[peer review]], [[Reproducibility|reproduction of results]], conference presentation, and [[Scientific literature|journal publication]]. This requires rigorous communication of hypothesis (usually expressed in mathematics), experimental constraints and controls (expressed necessarily in terms of standard experimental apparatus), and a common understanding of measurement.

[[Statement (logic)|Statements]] and [[argument]]s depending on empirical evidence are often referred to as ''[[a posteriori]]'' ("following experience") as distinguished from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' (preceding it). ''A priori'' knowledge or justification is independent of experience (for example "All bachelors are unmarried"), whereas ''a posteriori'' knowledge or justification is dependent on experience or empirical evidence (for example "Some bachelors are very happy"). The notion that the distinction between ''a posteriori'' and ''a priori'' is tantamount to the distinction between empirical and non-empirical knowledge comes from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]].''<ref name=Craig2005>{{harvnb|Craig|2005|p=1}}</ref>

The standard [[positivism|positivist]] view of empirically acquired information has been that observation, experience, and experiment serve as neutral arbiters between competing theories. However, since the 1960s, a persistent critique most associated with [[Thomas Kuhn]],<ref>{{harvnb|Kuhn|1970}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2014}} has argued that these methods are influenced by prior beliefs and experiences. Consequently, it cannot be expected that two scientists when observing, experiencing, or experimenting on the same event will make the same theory-neutral observations. The role of observation as a theory-neutral arbiter may not be possible. Theory-dependence of observation means that, even if there were agreed methods of inference and interpretation, scientists may still disagree on the nature of '''empirical data'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Bird|2013}}</ref>
