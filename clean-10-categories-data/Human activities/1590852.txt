{{short description|United Nations program}}
'''Education for sustainable development''' ('''ESD''') was a United Nations program that defined as [[education]] that encourages changes in [[knowledge]], [[Skill|skills]], [[Value (ethics)|values]] and [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s to enable a more [[Sustainability|sustainable]] and just society for all.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Education for Sustainable Development|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-sustainable-development|last=https://plus.google.com/+UNESCO|date=2013-05-10|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref> ESD aims to [[Empowerment|empower]] and equip current and future generations to meet their needs using a balanced and integrated approach to the [[Economy|economic]], [[social]] and [[environmental]] dimensions of [[sustainable development]]. ESD is the term most used internationally and by the [[United Nations]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esdtoolkit.org/|title=Untitled Document|website=Esdtoolkit.org|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> [[Agenda 21]] was the first international document that identified education as an essential tool for achieving sustainable development and highlighted areas of action for education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261801|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Bernad-Cavero|first1=Olga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hwiQDwAAQBAJ&q=Agenda+21+was+the+first+international+document+that+identified+education+as+an+essential+tool+for+achieving+sustainable+development+and+highlighted+areas+of+action+for+education.&pg=PA27|title=New Pedagogical Challenges in the 21st Century: Contributions of Research in Education|last2=Llevot-Calvet|first2=Núria|date=2018-07-04|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|isbn=978-1-78923-380-3|language=en}}</ref>

ESD is a component of measurement in an indicator for [[Sustainable Development Goal 12]] (SDG) for "responsible consumption and production". SDG 12 has 11 targets and Target 12.8 is "By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature."<ref>United Nations (2017) Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 6 July 2017, [[:File:A RES 71 313 E.pdf|Work of the Statistical Commission pertaining to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] ([https://undocs.org/A/RES/71/313 A/RES/71/313])</ref>

== Concept and origin ==
One definition of Education for Sustainable Development is an "[[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] learning methodology covering the integrated social, economic, and environmental aspects of formal and informal curriculum". <ref>{{Cite web|title=Education for sustainable development {{!}} Higher Education Academy|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/education-sustainable-development-0|access-date=2018-07-04|website=www.heacademy.ac.uk|language=en}}</ref> This educational ideology recognizes modern-day environmental challenges and seeks to define new ways to adjust to a changing biosphere, as well as engage individuals to address societal issues that come with them <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/894509040|title=Schooling for sustainable development in Europe : concepts, policies and educational experiences at the end of the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development|others=Jucker, Rolf, 1963-, Mathar, Reiner|date=27 October 2014|isbn=978-3-319-09549-3|location=Cham [Switzerland]|oclc=894509040}}</ref> In the International Encyclopedia of Education, this approach to education is seen as an attempt to "shift consciousness toward an ethics of life-giving relationships that respects the interconnectedness of man to his natural world" in order to equip future members of society with environmental awareness and a sense of responsibility to sustainability.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/645208716|title=International encyclopedia of education|date=2010|publisher=Elsevier|others=Peterson, Penelope L.,, Baker, Eva L.,, McGaw, Barry|isbn=978-0-08-044894-7|edition=3rd|location=Oxford|oclc=645208716}}</ref> The [[Brundtland Commission]] defined sustainable development as meeting the needs of the present generation without putting at risk the capacity of generations to come in meeting their own requirements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sustainabledevelopment2015.org/AdvocacyToolkit/index.php/earth-summit-history/past-earth-summits/58-the-brundtland-commission|title=The Brundtland Commission|website=www.sustainabledevelopment2015.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref> This Agency used to be the World Commission on Environment and Development created in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.reset.org/knowledge/advancing-sustainable-development-through-education-india|title=Education for Sustainable Development {{!}} Development|website=RESET.to|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>  The idea of sustainable development originated from the United Nations Conference on Human Environment in Stockholm (Sweden 1972).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/milestones/humanenvironment|title=UN Conference on the Human Environment .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref>  There were two more global activities since then.

For [[UNESCO]], education for sustainable development involves:

{{quote|integrating key sustainable development issues into teaching and learning. This may include, for example, instruction about [[climate change]], [[disaster risk reduction]], [[biodiversity]], and [[poverty reduction]] and [[sustainable consumption]]. It also requires participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviours and take action for sustainable development. ESD consequently promotes competencies like critical thinking, imagining future scenarios and making decisions in a collaborative way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-sustainable-development|title=Education for Sustainable Development|website=UNESCO|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233030e.pdf|title=Unleashing the Potential: Transforming Technical and Vocational Education and Training|last1=Marope|first1=P.T.M|last2=Chakroun|first2=B.|last3=Holmes|first3=K.P.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100091-1|pages=9, 23, 25–26}}</ref>}}
The Thessaloniki Declaration, presented at the "International Conference on Environment and Society: Education and Public Awareness for Sustainability" by [[UNESCO]] and the Government of Greece (December 1997), highlights the importance of sustainability not only with regards to the natural environment, but also with "poverty, health, food security, democracy, human rights, and peace".<ref>{{Cite book|date=2010|title=Education for Sustainable Development: Challenges, Strategies, and Practices in a Globalizing World Education for sustainable development: Challenges, strategies, and practices in a globalizing world|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9788132108023|doi=10.4135/9788132108023|isbn=9788132102939}}</ref> 

== Sustainable Development Goals ==
The [[Sustainable Development Goals]] are 17 goals that were established by the UN in 2015. <ref>UN Sustainable Development Goals, https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/</ref> [[SDG 4]] focuses on Education and target 4.7 aims to make sure that people are given the knowledge and skills to promote [[sustainable development]].<ref>UN Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education, https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/</ref> [[SDG 12]] concentrates on Responsible Consumption and Production and target 12.8 aims to make sure that everyone has the information and "awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature".<ref>UN Sustainable Development Goal 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production, https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/</ref> Target 12.B under [[Goal 12]] also aims to measure the impacts of [[sustainable development]] for [[sustainable tourism]] to create jobs and promote local culture and products.<ref>UN Sustainable Development Goal 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production, https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/</ref>
