A '''destination management company''' ('''DMC''') is a [[professional services]] company with local knowledge, expertise and resources, working in the design and implementation of events, activities, tours, transportation and program logistics.

There are very few destination ''management'' organizations. Management implies control, and rarely does a tourism organisation have control over the destination's resources, such as in the case of the New Zealand government's development of the resort town of Rotorua in the first half of the 20th Century.<ref>Pike, S.(2016). Destination Marketing Essentials. (Second Edition). Oxford: Routledge.</ref> The majority of these entities are regarded as destination ''marketing'' organizations See<ref>Pike, S., & Page, S. (2014). Destination marketing organizations and destination marketing: A narrative analysis of the literature. Tourism Management. 41:202-227. 10.1016/j.tourman.2013.09.009</ref>

A DMC provides a ground service based on local knowledge of their given destinations. These services can be [[transportation]], [[hotel]] accommodation, restaurants, activities, excursions, conference venues, themed events, gala dinners and logistics, meetings, incentive schemes as well as helping with overcoming [[language barrier]]s. By acting as [[Group purchasing organization|purchasing consortia]], DMCs can provide preferential rates based on the buying power they have with their preferred suppliers.
