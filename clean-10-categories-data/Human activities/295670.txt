'''Urban ecology''' is the scientific study of the relation of living organisms with each other and their surroundings in the context of an [[urban environment]]. The urban environment refers to environments dominated by [[population density|high-density]] residential and commercial buildings, [[Impervious surface|paved surfaces]], and other urban-related factors that create a unique landscape dissimilar to most previously studied environments in the field of [[ecology]].<ref name="Niemela">{{cite journal |last1=Niemelä |first1=Jari |title=Ecology and urban planning |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |date=1999 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=119–131 |doi=10.1023/A:1008817325994 |s2cid=36775732 }}</ref> The goal of urban ecology is to achieve a balance between human culture and the natural environment.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

Urban ecology is a recent field of study compared to ecology as a whole. The methods and studies of urban ecology are similar to and comprise a subset of ecology. The study of urban ecology carries increasing importance because more than 50% of the world's population today lives in urban areas.<ref name="UrbanEcology">{{cite web |first=Govind |last=Singh |title=Urban Ecology & Ecosystem Inputs – Need of the Urban Era |url=http://urbanecology.in/2014/10/05/urban-ecology-inputs-need-of-the-urban-era/ |website=Urban Ecology |date=5 October 2014 }}</ref> At the same time, it is estimated that within the next forty years, two-thirds of the world's population will be living in expanding urban centers.<ref name="UN">{{cite book |publisher=United Nations |year=2007 |title=World urbanization prospects: the 2007 revision }}{{page needed|date=May 2019}}</ref> The ecological processes in the urban environment are comparable to those outside the urban context. However, the types of urban [[habitats]] and the species that inhabit them are poorly documented. Often, explanations for phenomena examined in the urban setting as well as predicting changes because of urbanization are the center for scientific research.<ref name="Niemela" />

== History ==
[[File:Plan d'Eau 2.jpg|thumb|The creation of an important stream water garden in [[Metz]]'s centre during the early 70s was one of the materializations of [[Jean-Marie Pelt]]'s works on urban ecology.]]
Ecology has historically focused on "pristine" natural environments, but by the 1970s many ecologists began to turn their interest towards ecological interactions taking place in, and caused by urban environments. [[Jean-Marie Pelt]]'s 1977 book ''The Re-Naturalized Human'',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pelt |first1=JM |year=1977 |title=L'Homme re-naturé |trans-title=The man re-educated |language=fr |isbn=978-2-02-004589-6 }}</ref> Brian Davis' 1978 publication ''Urbanization and the diversity of insects'',<ref name="Davis">{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=BNK |chapter=Urbanisation and the diversity of insects |editor1-last=Mound |editor1-first=L A |editor2-last=Walo |editor2-first=N |title=Diversity of Insect Faunas |series=Symposia of the Royal Entomological Society of London |year=1978 |volume=9 |pages=126–38 |publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications |location=Oxford }}</ref> and Sukopp et al.'s 1979 article "The soil, flora and vegetation of Berlin's wastelands"<ref name="Sukopp">{{cite book |last1=Sukopp |first1=H |last2=Blume |first2=HP |last3=Kunick |first3=W |year=1979 |chapter=The soil, flora and vegetation of Berlin's wastelands |editor1-last=Laurie |editor1-first=I C |title=Nature in Cities |pages=115–32 |publisher=John Wiley |location=Chichester }}</ref> are some of the first publications to recognize the importance of urban ecology as a separate and distinct form of ecology the same way one might see [[landscape ecology]] as different from [[population ecology]]. Forman and Godron's 1986 book ''Landscape Ecology''<ref name="Forman">{{cite book |last1=Forman |first1=R.T.T. |first2=M. |last2=Godron |title=Landscape ecology |year=1986 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |page=619 }}</ref> first distinguished urban settings and landscapes from other landscapes by dividing all landscapes into five broad types. These types were divided by the intensity of human influence ranging from pristine [[natural environment]]s to [[urban centers]].

Urban ecology is recognized as a diverse and complex concept which differs in application between North America and Europe. The European concept of urban ecology examines the [[biota (ecology)|biota]] of urban areas, the North American concept has traditionally examined the social sciences of the urban landscape,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wittig |first1=R. |first2=H. |last2=Sukopp |chapter=Was ist Stadtökologie? |trans-chapter=What is urban ecology? |language=de |title=Stadtökologie |year=1993 |pages=1–9 |publisher=Gustav Fischer Verlag |location=Stuttgart }}</ref> as well as the ecosystem fluxes and processes,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pickett |first1=Steward T.

== Methods ==

Since urban ecology is a subfield of ecology, many of the techniques are similar to that of ecology. Ecological study techniques have been developed over centuries, but many of the techniques use for urban ecology are more recently developed. Methods used for studying urban ecology involve chemical and biochemical techniques, temperature recording, heat mapping [[remote sensing]], and long-term ecological research sites.

===Chemical and biochemical techniques ===

Chemical techniques may be used to determine [[pollutant]] concentrations and their effects. Tests can be as simple as dipping a manufactured test strip, as in the case of pH testing, or be more complex, as in the case of examining the spatial and temporal variation of [[heavy metal contamination]] due to industrial runoff.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Furness |first1=R. W. |last2=Thompson |first2=D. R. |last3=Becker |first3=P. H. |title=Spatial and temporal variation in mercury contamination of seabirds in the North Sea |journal=Helgoländer Meeresuntersuchungen |date=March 1995 |volume=49 |issue=1–4 |pages=605–615 |doi=10.1007/BF02368386 |bibcode=1995HM.....49..605F |doi-access=free }}</ref> In that particular study, livers of birds from many regions of the [[North Sea]] were ground up and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] was extracted. Additionally, mercury bound in feathers was extracted from both live birds and from museum specimens to test for mercury levels across many decades. Through these two different measurements, researchers were able to make a complex picture of the spread of mercury due to industrial runoff both spatially and temporally.

Other chemical techniques include tests for [[nitrate]]s, [[phosphate]]s, [[sulfate]]s, etc. which are commonly associated with urban [[pollutant]]s such as [[fertilizer]] and industrial byproducts. These biochemical fluxes are studied in the atmosphere (e.g. [[greenhouse gas]]ses), [[aquatic ecosystem]]s and [[soil vegetation]].<ref name="grim2008"/> Broad reaching effects of these biochemical fluxes can be seen in various aspects of both the urban and surrounding rural ecosystems.

===Temperature data and heat mapping===

[[Temperature]] data can be used for various kinds of studies. An important aspect of temperature data is the ability to correlate temperature with various factors that may be affecting or occurring in the environment. Oftentimes, temperature data is collected long-term by the [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR), and made available to the scientific community through the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).<ref name="Gallo">{{cite journal |last1=Gallo |first1=K. P. |last2=McNab |first2=A. L. |last3=Karl |first3=T. R. |last4=Brown |first4=J. F. |last5=Hood |first5=J. J. |last6=Tarpley |first6=J.

These heat maps can be used to view trends and distribution over time and space.<ref name="Gallo" /><ref name="Roth">{{cite journal |last1=ROTH |first1=M. |last2=OKE |first2=T.

=== Remote sensing ===
[[File:Boston forest cover 460.gif|thumb|Remote sensing allows collection of data using satellites. This map shows urban tree canopy in Boston.]]

[[Remote sensing]]  is the technique in which data is collected from distant locations through the use of satellite imaging, [[radar]], and aerial photographs. In urban ecology, remote sensing is used to collect data about terrain, weather patterns, light, and vegetation. One application of remote sensing for urban ecology is to detect the productivity of an area by measuring the photosynthetic wavelengths of emitted light.<ref name="Schochat">{{cite journal |last1=Shochat |first1=E. |last2=Stefanov |first2=W. L. |last3=Whitehouse |first3=M. E. A. |last4=Faeth |first4=S.

=== LTERs and long-term data sets ===

[[Long Term Ecological Research Network|Long-term ecological research]] (LTER) sites are research sites funded by the government that have collected reliable long-term data over an extended period of time in order to identify long-term climatic or ecological trends. These sites provide long-term temporal and spatial data such as average temperature, rainfall and other ecological processes. The main purpose of LTERs for urban ecologists is the collection of vast amounts of data over long periods of time. These long-term data sets can then be analyzed to find trends relating to the effects of the urban environment on various ecological processes, such as species diversity and abundance over time.<ref name="Schochat" /> Another example is the examination of temperature trends that are accompanied with the growth of urban centers.<ref name="brazel">{{cite journal |last1=Brazel |first1=A |last2=Selover |first2=N |last3=Vose |first3=R |last4=Heisler |first4=G |title=The tale of two climates-Baltimore and Phoenix urban LTER sites |journal=Climate Research |date=2000 |volume=15 |pages=123–135 |doi=10.3354/cr015123 |bibcode=2000ClRes..15..123B |doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Urban effects on the environment ==

Humans are the driving force behind urban ecology and influence the environment in a variety of ways, such as modifying land surfaces and waterways, introducing foreign species, and altering biogeochemical cycles. Some of these effects are more apparent, such as the reversal of the [[Chicago River]] to accommodate the growing pollution levels and trade on the river.<ref name="Hill">Hill, L. The Chicago River: A Natural and Unnatural History. Lake Claremont Press. 2000.{{page needed|date=May 2019}}</ref> Other effects can be more gradual such as the change in global climate due to urbanization.<ref name="Changnon">{{cite journal |last1=Changnon |first1=Stanley A. |title=Inadvertent Weather Modification in Urban Areas: Lessons for Global Climate Change |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |date=May 1992 |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=619–627 |doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1992)073<0619:IWMIUA>2.0.CO;2 |bibcode=1992BAMS...73..619C |doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Modification of land and waterways ===
[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The "fishbone pattern" is a result of the roads in the forest created by loggers.]]Humans place high demand on land not only to build urban centers, but also to build surrounding suburban areas for housing. Land is also allocated for agriculture to sustain the growing population of the city. Expanding cities and suburban areas necessitate corresponding deforestation to meet the land-use and resource requirements of urbanization. Key examples of this are [[Deforestation in the United States]] and [[Brazil]].<ref name="Rudel">{{cite journal |last1=Rudel |first1=Thomas K. |last2=Defries |first2=Ruth |last3=Asner |first3=Gregory P. |last4=Laurance |first4=William F. |title=Changing Drivers of Deforestation and New Opportunities for Conservation |journal=Conservation Biology |date=December 2009 |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=1396–1405 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01332.x |pmid=20078640 }}</ref>

Along with manipulation of land to suit human needs, natural water resources such as rivers and streams are also modified in urban establishments. Modification can come in the form of dams, artificial canals, and even the reversal of rivers. Reversing the flow of the Chicago River is a major example of urban environmental modification.<ref name="Hill" /> Urban areas in natural desert settings often bring in water from far areas to maintain the human population and will likely have effects on the local desert climate.<ref name="Schochat" /> Modification of aquatic systems in urban areas also results in decreased stream diversity and increased pollution.<ref name="Paul">{{cite journal |last1=Paul |first1=Michael J. |last2=Meyer |first2=Judy L. |title=Streams in the Urban Landscape |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |date=November 2001 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=333–365 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.32.081501.114040 }}</ref>

=== Trade, shipping, and spread of invasive species ===
[[File:Clyde shipping.jpg|thumb|right|A ship navigates through the Firth of Clyde in Scotland, potentially carrying invasive species.]]
[[File:Kudzu on trees in Atlanta, Georgia.jpg|thumb|left|Invasive [[kudzu]] vines growing on trees in Atlanta, Georgia, USA]]

Both local shipping and long-distance trade are required to meet the resource demands important in maintaining urban areas. [[Carbon dioxide]] emissions from the transport of goods also contribute to accumulating greenhouse gases and nutrient deposits in the soil and air of urban environments.<ref name="grim2008">{{cite journal |last1=Grimm |first1=N. B. |author-link1=Nancy Grimm|last2=Faeth |first2=S. H. |last3=Golubiewski |first3=N. E. |last4=Redman |first4=C. L. |last5=Wu |first5=J. |last6=Bai |first6=X. |last7=Briggs |first7=J.

Introduced or [[alien species]] are populations of organisms living in a range in which they did not naturally evolve due to intentional or inadvertent human activity. Increased transportation between urban centers furthers the incidental movement of animal and plant species. Alien species often have no natural predators and pose a substantial threat to the dynamics of existing ecological populations in the new environment where they are introduced. Such invasive species are numerous and include [[house sparrow]]s, [[ring-necked pheasant]]s, [[European starling]]s, [[brown rat]]s, [[Asian carp]], [[American bullfrog]]s, [[emerald ash borer]], [[kudzu]] vines, and [[zebra mussels]] among numerous others, most notably domesticated animals.<ref name="Ewel">{{cite journal |last1=Ewel |first1=John J. |last2=O'Dowd |first2=Dennis J. |last3=Bergelson |first3=Joy |last4=Daehler |first4=Curtis C. |last5=D'Antonio |first5=Carla M. |last6=Gómez |first6=Luis Diego |last7=Gordon |first7=Doria R. |last8=Hobbs |first8=Richard J. |last9=Holt |first9=Alan |last10=Hopper |first10=Keith R. |last11=Hughes |first11=Colin E. |last12=LaHart |first12=Marcy |last13=Leakey |first13=Roger R.

Although, there seems to be a density threshold in which too much Lantana (thus homogeneity in vegetation cover) can lead to a decrease in bird species richness or abundance .

=== Human effects on biogeochemical pathways ===

Urbanization results in a large demand for chemical use by industry, construction, agriculture, and energy providing services. Such demands have a substantial impact on [[biogeochemical cycles]], resulting in phenomena such as [[acid rain]], [[eutrophication]], and [[global warming]].<ref name="grim2008"/> Furthermore, natural biogeochemical cycles in the urban environment can be impeded due to impermeable surfaces that prevent nutrients from returning to the soil, water, and atmosphere.<ref name="Kaye">{{cite journal |last1=Kaye |first1=J |last2=Groffman |first2=P |last3=Grimm |first3=N |last4=Baker |first4=L |last5=Pouyat |first5=R |title=A distinct urban biogeochemistry? |journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution |date=April 2006 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=192–199 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.12.006 |pmid=16701085 }}</ref>
[[File:Carbon cycle-cute diagram.svg|thumb|right|Graphical representation of the [[carbon cycle]].]]

Demand for fertilizers to meet agricultural needs exerted by expanding urban centers can alter chemical composition of soil. Such effects often result in abnormally high concentrations of compounds including sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen, and heavy metals. In addition, nitrogen and phosphorus used in fertilizers have caused severe problems in the form of agricultural runoff, which alters the concentration of these compounds in local rivers and streams, often resulting in adverse effects on native species.<ref name="Roach">{{cite journal |last1=Roach |first1=W. John |last2=Grimm |first2=Nancy B. |title=Nutrient Variation in an Urban Lake Chain and its Consequences for Phytoplankton Production |journal=Journal of Environmental Quality |date=2009 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=1429–40 |doi=10.2134/jeq2008.0191 |pmid=19465718 }}</ref> A well-known effect of agricultural runoff is the phenomenon of eutrophication. When the fertilizer chemicals from agricultural runoff reach the ocean, an [[algal bloom]] results, then rapidly dies off.<ref name="Roach" /> The dead algae biomass is decomposed by bacteria that also consume large quantities of oxygen, which they obtain from the water, creating a "dead zone" without oxygen for fish or other organisms. A classic example is the dead zone in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] due to agricultural runoff into the [[Mississippi River]].

Just as pollutants and alterations in the biogeochemical cycle alter river and ocean ecosystems, they exert likewise effects in the air. Some stems from the accumulation of chemicals and pollution and often manifests in urban settings, which has a great impact on local plants and animals. Because urban centers are often considered point sources for pollution, unsurprisingly local plants have adapted to withstand such conditions.<ref name="grim2008"/>

== Urban effects on climate ==

Urban environments and outlying areas have been found to exhibit unique local temperatures, [[precipitation]], and other characteristic activity due to a variety of factors such as pollution and altered geochemical cycles. Some examples of the urban effects on climate are [[urban heat island]], [[oasis effect]], [[greenhouse gases]], and [[acid rain]]. This further stirs the debate as to whether urban areas should be considered a unique [[biome]]. Despite common trends among all urban centers, the surrounding local environment heavily influences much of the climate. One such example of regional differences can be seen through the urban heat island and oasis effect.<ref name="brazel"/>

=== Urban heat island effect ===
[[File:HeatIsland Kanto en.png|thumb|right|Graphical representation of the rising temperature in Kanto, Japan due to urban heat island.]]

The [[urban heat island]] is a phenomenon in which central regions of urban centers exhibit higher mean temperatures than surrounding urban areas.<ref name="bornstein2000">{{cite journal |last1=Bornstein |first1=Robert |last2=Lin |first2=Qinglu |title=Urban heat islands and summertime convective thunderstorms in Atlanta: three case studies |journal=Atmospheric Environment |date=February 2000 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=507–516 |doi=10.1016/S1352-2310(99)00374-X |bibcode=2000AtmEn..34..507B }}</ref> Much of this effect can be attributed to low city [[albedo]], the reflecting power of a surface, and the increased surface area of buildings to absorb solar radiation.<ref name="brazel"/> Concrete, cement, and metal surfaces in urban areas tend to absorb heat energy rather than reflect it, contributing to higher urban temperatures. Brazel et al.<ref name="brazel"/> found that the urban heat island effect demonstrates a positive correlation with population density in the city of Baltimore. The heat island effect has corresponding ecological consequences on resident species.<ref name="grim2008"/> However, this effect has only been seen in temperate climates.

=== Greenhouse gases ===

Greenhouse gas emissions include those of carbon dioxide and methane from the combustion of [[fossil fuels]] to supply energy needed by vast urban metropolises. Other greenhouse gases include water vapor, and [[nitrous oxide]]. Increases in [[greenhouse gases]] due to urban transport, construction, industry and other demands have been correlated strongly with increase in temperature. Sources of methane are agricultural dairy cows <ref name="Benchaar">{{cite journal |last1=Benchaar |first1=C |last2=Rivest |first2=J |last3=Pomar |first3=C |last4=Chiquette |first4=J |title=Prediction of methane production from dairy cows using existing mechanistic models and regression equations. |journal=Journal of Animal Science |date=1998 |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=617–27 |doi=10.2527/1998.762617x |pmid=9498373 }}</ref><ref name="Moe P">{{cite journal |last1=Moe |first1=P.W. |last2=Tyrrell |first2=H.F. |title=Methane Production in Dairy Cows |journal=Journal of Dairy Science |date=October 1979 |volume=62 |issue=10 |pages=1583–1586 |doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(79)83465-7 |doi-access=free }}</ref> and landfills.<ref name="Daley">{{cite journal |last1=Daley |first1=E.

=== Acid rain and pollution ===
[[File:AlfedPalmersmokestacks.jpg|thumb|right|Smokestacks from a wartime production plant releasing pollutants into the atmosphere.]]

== Biodiversity and urbanization ==

Research thus far indicates that, on a small scale, urbanization often increases the [[biodiversity]] of non-native species while reducing that of native species. This normally results in an overall reduction in [[species richness]] and increase in total biomass and species abundance. Urbanization also reduces diversity on a large scale.<ref name="McKinney">{{cite journal |last1=McKinney |first1=Michael L. |title=Urbanization as a major cause of biotic homogenization |journal=Biological Conservation |date=January 2006 |volume=127 |issue=3 |pages=247–260 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.09.005 }}</ref>

=== Changes in diversity ===

Diversity is normally reduced at intermediate-low levels of urbanization but is always reduced at high levels of urbanization. These effects have been observed in vertebrates and invertebrates while plant species tend to increase with intermediate-low levels of urbanization<ref name="McKinney2">{{cite journal |last1=McKinney |first1=Michael L. |title=Effects of urbanization on species richness: A review of plants and animals |journal=Urban Ecosystems |date=29 January 2008 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=161–176 |doi=10.1007/s11252-007-0045-4 |s2cid=23353943 }}</ref><ref name="Marzluff">{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-1531-9_2 |chapter=Worldwide urbanization and its effects on birds |title=Avian Ecology and Conservation in an Urbanizing World |pages=19–47 |year=2001 |last1=Marzluff |first1=John M. |isbn=978-1-4613-5600-4 }}</ref> but these general trends do not apply to all organisms within those groups. For example, McKinney’s (2006)<ref name="McKinney2"/> review did not include the effects of urbanization on fishes and of the 58 studies on invertebrates, 52 included insects while only 10 included spiders. There is also a geographical bias as most of the studies either took place in North America or Europe.

The effects of urbanization also depend on the type and range of resources used by the organism.<ref name="McKinney"/><ref name="Devictor">{{cite journal |last1=Devictor |first1=Vincent |last2=Julliard |first2=Romain |last3=Jiguet |first3=Frédéric |title=Distribution of specialist and generalist species along spatial gradients of habitat disturbance and fragmentation |journal=Oikos |pages=080211051304426–0 |date=11 February 2008 |doi=10.1111/j.2008.0030-1299.16215.x |url=http://biobio-indicator.org/information/Devictor_2007.pdf }}</ref><ref name="Grimm2">{{cite journal |last1=Grimm |first1=N.

A study of 463 bird species reported that urban species share dietary traits. Specifically, urban species were larger, consumed more vertebrates and carrion, and fed more frequently on the ground or aerially, and also had broader diets than non‐urban species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palacio|first=Facundo Xavier|date=2020|title=Urban exploiters have broader dietary niches than urban avoiders|journal=Ibis|language=en|volume=162|issue=1|pages=42–49|doi=10.1111/ibi.12732|issn=1474-919X}}</ref>

=== Cause of diversity change ===

The urban environment can decrease diversity through [[Habitat destruction|habitat removal]] and [[species homogenization]]—the increasing similarity between two previously distinct biological communities. [[Habitat degradation]] and [[habitat fragmentation]]<ref name="Grimm2"/> reduces the amount of suitable habitat by urban development and separates suitable patches by inhospitable terrain such as [[road]]s, neighborhoods, and open parks.<ref name="Reed2">{{cite journal |last1=Reed |first1=David H. |last2=Hobbs |first2=Gayla R. |title=The relationship between population size and temporal variability in population size |journal=Animal Conservation |date=February 2004 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1017/S1367943004003476 }}</ref> Although this replacement of suitable habitat with unsuitable habitat will result in [[extinction]]s of native species, some shelter may be artificially created and promote the survival of non-native species (e.g. [[house sparrow]] and [[house mice]] nests).<ref name="McKinney"/> Urbanization promotes species homogenization through the extinction of native [[endemic species]] and the introduction of non-native species that already have a widespread abundance.<ref name="McKinney"/> Changes to the habitat may promote both the extinction of native endemic species and the introduction of non-native species.<ref name="Rahel">{{cite journal |last1=Rahel |first1=Frank J. |title=Homogenization of Freshwater Faunas |journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics |date=November 2002 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=291–315 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150429 }}</ref> The effects of habitat change will likely be similar in all urban environments as urban environments are all built to cater to the needs of humans.<ref name="McKinney"/>

Wildlife in cities are more susceptible to suffering ill effects from exposure to toxicants (such as heavy metals and pesticides).<ref name=":32">{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Maureen H.|last2=Sánchez|first2=Cecilia A.|last3=Becker|first3=Daniel J.|last4=Byers|first4=Kaylee A.|last5=Worsley‐Tonks|first5=Katherine EL|last6=Craft|first6=Meggan E.|date=2019|title=City sicker? A meta-analysis of wildlife health and urbanization|url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fee.2126|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=17|issue=10|pages=575–583|doi=10.1002/fee.2126|issn=1540-9309}}</ref> In China, fish that were exposed to industrial wastewater had poorer body condition; being exposed to toxicants can increase susceptibility to infection.<ref name=":32" /> Humans have the potential to induce patchy food distribution, which can promote animal aggregation by attracting a high number of animals to common food sources; “this aggregation may increase the spread of [[Parasitism|parasites]] transmitted through close contact; parasite deposition on soil, water, or artificial feeders; and stress through inter‐ and intraspecific competition.”<ref name=":32" /> The results of a study performed by Maureen Murray (et. al.), in which a phylogenetic meta-analysis of 516 comparisons of overall wildlife condition reported in 106 studies was performed, confirmed these results; “our [[Meta-analysis|meta‐analysis]] suggests an overall negative relationship between urbanization and wildlife health, mainly driven by considerably higher toxicant loads and greater parasite abundance, greater parasite diversity, and/or greater likelihood of infection by parasites transmitted through close contact.”<ref name=":32" />

The urban environment can also increase diversity in a number of ways. Many foreign organisms are introduced and dispersed naturally or artificially in urban areas. Artificial introductions may be intentional, where organisms have some form of human use, or accidental, where organisms attach themselves to [[transportation]] vehicles.<ref name="McKinney"/> Humans provide food sources (e.g. [[birdfeeder]] seeds, trash, garden [[compost]])<ref name="McKinney2"/> and reduce the numbers of large natural [[predator]]s in urban environments,<ref name="Grimm2"/> allowing large populations to be supported where food and predation would normally limit the population size. There are a variety of different habitats available within the urban environment as a result of differences in land use<ref name="McKinney2"/> allowing for more species to be supported than by more uniform habitats.

== Ways to improve urban ecology: civil engineering and sustainability ==

Cities should be planned and constructed in such a way that minimizes the urban effects on the surrounding environment (urban heat island, precipitation, etc.) as well as optimizing ecological activity. For example, increasing the [[albedo]], or reflective power, of surfaces in urban areas, can minimize urban heat island,<ref name="Rosenfeld">{{cite web |last1=Rosenfeld |first1=Arthur H. |title=Paint the Town White--and Green |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/400033/paint-the-town-white-and-green/ |website=MIT Technology Review }}</ref><ref name="Rosenfeld2">{{cite journal |last1=Rosenfeld |first1=Arthur H. |last2=Akbari |first2=Hashem |last3=Romm |first3=Joseph J. |last4=Pomerantz |first4=Melvin |title=Cool communities: strategies for heat island mitigation and smog reduction |journal=Energy and Buildings |date=August 1998 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=51–62 |doi=10.1016/S0378-7788(97)00063-7 }}</ref> resulting in a lower magnitude of the urban heat island effect in urban areas.

=== Need for remediation ===

Urbanization has indeed had a profound effect on the environment, on both local and global scales. Difficulties in actively constructing [[habitat corridor]] and returning biogeochemical cycles to normal raise the question as to whether such goals are feasible. However, some groups are working to return areas of land affected by the urban landscape to a more natural state.<ref name="Blum">{{cite web |last1=Blum |first1=Andrew |title=The Long View: Urban Remediation through Landscape & Architecture |url=https://www.metropolismag.com/ceu/the-long-view-urban-remediation-through-landscape-architecture/ |website=Metropolis |date=24 November 2008 }}</ref> This includes using landscape architecture to model natural systems and restore rivers to pre-urban states.<ref name="Blum" />

It is becoming increasingly critical that conservation action be enabled within urban landscapes. Space in cities is limited; urban infill threatens the existence of [[Urban open space|green spaces]]. Green spaces that are in close proximity to cities are also vulnerable to [[urban sprawl]]. It is common that urban development comes at the cost of valuable land that could host wildlife species. Natural and financial resources are limited; a larger focus must be placed on conservation opportunities that factor in feasibility and maximization of expected benefits.<ref name=":06">{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Zhenzhen|last2=Meerow|first2=Sara|last3=Newell|first3=Joshua P.|last4=Lindquist|first4=Mark|date=2019-02-01|title=Enhancing landscape connectivity through multifunctional green infrastructure corridor modeling and design|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1618866717307343|journal=Urban Forestry & Urban Greening|language=en|volume=38|pages=305–317|doi=10.1016/j.ufug.2018.10.014|issn=1618-8667}}</ref> Since the securing of land as a [[protected area]] is a luxury that cannot be extensively implemented, alternative approaches must be explored in order to prevent mass extinction of species.

The need to pursue conservation outcomes in urban environments is most pronounced for species whose global distribution is contained within a human-modified landscape.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last=Soanes|first=Kylie|last2=Lentini|first2=Pia E.|date=2019|title=When cities are the last chance for saving species|url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fee.2032|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=225–231|doi=10.1002/fee.2032|issn=1540-9309}}</ref> The fact is that many threatened wildlife species are prevalent among land types that were not originally intended for conservation.<ref name=":12"/> Of Australia’s 39 urban-restricted threatened species, 11 species occur at roadsides, 10 species occur in private lands, 5 species occur in military lands, 4 species in schools, 4 species in golf courses, 4 species at utility easements (such as railways), 3 species at airports and 1 species at hospitals.<ref name=":12"/> The spiked rice flower species [[Pimelea spicata]] persists mainly at a golf course, while the guinea-flower hibbertia puberula glabrescens is known mainly from the grounds of an airport.<ref name=":12"/> Unconventional landscapes as such are the ones that must be prioritized. The goal in the management of these areas is to bring about a “win-win” situation where conservation efforts are practiced while not compromising the original use of the space. While being near to large human populations can pose risks to endangered species inhabiting urban environments, such closeness can prove to be an advantage as long as the human community is conscious and engaged in local conservation efforts.

=== Species reintroduction ===
Reintroduction of species to urban settings can help improve the local biodiversity previously lost; however the following guidelines should be followed in order to avoid undesired effects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Monge-Nájera|first=Julián|date=2018-02-28|title=An ethical decalogue for the reintroduction of species to urban habitats|journal=UNED Research Journal|volume=10|issue=1|doi=10.22458/urj.v10i1.2048|issn=1659-441X|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

# No predators capable of killing children will be reintroduced to urban areas.
# There will be no introduction of species that significantly threaten human health, pets, crops or property.
# Reintroduction will not be done when it implies significant suffering to the organisms being reintroduced, for example stress from capture or captivity.
# Organisms that carry pathogens will not be reintroduced.
# Organisms whose genes threaten the genetic pool of other organisms in the urban area will not be reintroduced.
# Organisms will only be reintroduced when scientific data support a reasonable chance of long term survival (if funds are insufficient for the long term effort, reintroduction will not be attempted).
# Reintroduced organisms will receive food supplementation and veterinary assistance as needed.
# Reintroduction will be done in both experimental and control areas to produce reliable assessments (monitoring must continue afterwards to trigger interventions if necessary).
# Reintroduction must be done in several places and repeated over several years to buffer for stochastic events.
# People in the areas affected must participate in the decision process, and will receive education to make reintroduction sustainable (but final decisions must be based on objective information gathered according to scientific standards).

=== Sustainability ===
[[File:Biogas.jpg|thumb|right|Pipes carrying biogas produced by anaerobic digestion or fermentation of biodegradable materials as a form of carbon sequestration.]]

With the ever-increasing [[resource demand|demands for resources]] necessitated by urbanization, recent campaigns to move toward sustainable energy and [[resource consumption]], such as [[LEED certification]] of buildings, [[Energy Star]] certified appliances, and [[zero emission]] vehicles, have gained momentum. Sustainability reflects techniques and consumption ensuring reasonably low resource use as a component of urban ecology. Techniques such as carbon recapture may also be used to [[Carbon Sequestration|sequester]] carbon compounds produced in urban centers rather continually emitting more of the [[greenhouse gas]].<ref name="Nowak">{{cite journal |last1=Nowak |first1=David J. |last2=Crane |first2=Daniel E. |title=Carbon storage and sequestration by urban trees in the USA |journal=Environmental Pollution |date=March 2002 |volume=116 |issue=3 |pages=381–389 |doi=10.1016/S0269-7491(01)00214-7 |pmid=11822716 }}</ref>

'''Green Infrastructure Implementation'''

Urban areas can be converted to areas that are more conducive to hosting wildlife through the application of [[green infrastructure]]. Although the opportunities of green infrastructure (GI) to benefit human populations have been recognized, there are also opportunities to conserve wildlife diversity. Green infrastructure has the potential to support wildlife robustness by providing a more suitable habitat than conventional, “grey” infrastructure as well as aid in stormwater management and air purification.<ref name=":06"/><ref name=":23">{{Cite journal|last=Filazzola|first=Alessandro|last2=Shrestha|first2=Namrata|last3=MacIvor|first3=J.

In a study performed by Alessandro Filazzola (et. al.), 1,883 published manuscripts were examined and meta-analyzed in reference to 33 relevant studies in order to determine the effect of GI on wildlife. Although there was variability in the findings, it was determined that the implementation of GI improved [[biodiversity]] compared to conventional infrastructure.<ref name=":23"/> In some cases, GI even preserved comparable measures of biodiversity to natural components.<ref name=":23"/>

=== Urban green space ===
{{Excerpt|Urban green space}}'''Increasing Wildlife Habitat Connectivity'''

The implementation of wildlife corridors throughout urban areas (and in between wildlife areas) would promote wildlife habitat [[Landscape connectivity|connectivity]]. Habitat connectivity is critical for ecosystem health and wildlife conservation yet is being compromised by increasing [[urbanization]]. Urban development has caused green spaces to become increasingly fragmented and has caused adverse effects in genetic variation within species, population abundance and species richness. Urban green spaces that are linked by [[Wildlife corridor|ecosystem corridors]] have higher ecosystem health and resilience to global environmental change.<ref name=":06"/> Employment of corridors can form an ecosystem network that facilitates movement and dispersal.<ref name=":06"/> However, planning these networks requires a comprehensive spatial plan.

One approach is to target “shrinking” cities (such as [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], USA) that have an abundance of vacant lots and land that could be repurposed into greenways to provide ecosystem services (although even cities with growing populations typically have vacant land as well).<ref name=":06"/> However, even cities with high vacancy rates sometimes can present social and environmental challenges. For instance, vacant land that stands on [[Soil contamination|polluted soils]] may contain heavy metals or construction debris; this must be addressed before the repurposing.<ref name=":06"/> Once land has been repurposed for ecosystem services, avenues must be pursued that could allow this land to contribute to structural or functional connectivity.

Structural connectivity refers to parts of the landscape that are physically connected.<ref name=":06"/> Functional connectivity refers to species-specific tendencies that indicate interaction with other parts of the landscape.<ref name=":06"/> Throughout the City of Detroit, spatial patterns were detected that could promote structural connectivity.<ref name=":06"/> The research performed by Zhang “integrates [[landscape ecology]] and [[graph theory]], spatial modeling, and [[landscape design]] to develop a methodology for planning multifunctional green infrastructure that fosters social-ecological sustainability and resilience”.<ref name=":06"/> Using a functional connectivity index, there was found to be a high correlation between these results (structural and functional connectivity), suggesting that the two metrics could be indicators of each other and could guide green space planning.<ref name=":06"/>

Although urban wildlife corridors could serve as a potential mitigation tool, it is important that they are constructed so as to facilitate wildlife movement without restriction. As humans may be perceived as a threat, the success of the corridors is dependent on human population density proximity to roads.<ref name=":42">{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Tempe S. F.|last2=Chase|first2=Michael J.|last3=Rogers|first3=Tracey L.|last4=Leggett|first4=Keith E.

The study was performed in three different urban-dominated land use types (in [[Botswana]], South Africa) over a span of two years.

The results of the study indicated that elephants tended to move through unprotected areas more quickly, spending less time in those areas.<ref name=":42"/> Using vehicular traffic as a measure of human activity, the study indicated that elephant presence was higher during times when human activity was at a minimum.<ref name=":42" /> It was determined that “formal protection and designation of urban corridors by the relevant governing bodies would facilitate coexistence between people and wildlife at small spatial scales.”<ref name=":42" /> However, the only way this co-existence could be feasible is by creating structural connectivity (and thus promoting functional connectivity) by implementing proper wildlife corridors that facilitate easy movement between habitat patches.<ref name=":06"/><ref name=":42" /> The usage of [[green infrastructure]] that is connected to natural habitats has been shown to reap greater biodiversity benefits than GI implemented in areas far from natural habitats. GI close to natural areas may also increase functional connectivity in natural environments.<ref name=":23"/>

'''Roadkill Mitigation'''

In the United States, roadkill takes the lives of hundreds of thousands to hundreds of millions of mammals, birds and amphibians each year.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Spanowicz|first=Ariel G.|last2=Teixeira|first2=Fernanda Zimmermann|last3=Jaeger|first3=Jochen A.

The optimal situation would be to avoid constructing roads next to these natural habitats, but other preventative measures can be pursued to reduce animal mortality. One way these effects could be mitigated is through implementation of wildlife fencing in prioritized areas. Many countries utilize underpasses and overpasses combined with wildlife fencing to reduce roadkill mortality in an attempt to restore habitat connectivity. It is unrealistic to try to fence entire road networks because of financial constraints. Therefore, areas in which the highest rates of mortality occur should be focused on.<ref name=":5" />

== Summary ==

Urbanization results in a series of both local and far-reaching effects on [[biodiversity]], [[biogeochemical cycle]]s, [[hydrology]], and [[climate]], among many other stresses. Many of these effects are not fully understood, as urban ecology has only recently emerged as a scientific discipline and much more research remains to be done. Research on cities outside the US and Europe remains limited. Observations on the impact of urbanization on biodiversity and species interactions are consistent across many studies but definitive mechanisms have yet to be established. Urban ecology constitutes an important and highly relevant subfield of ecology, and further study must be pursued to more fully understand the effects of human urban areas on the environment.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}
