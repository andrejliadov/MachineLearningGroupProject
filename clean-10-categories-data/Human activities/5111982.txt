'''Agricultural chemistry''' is the study of [[chemistry]], especially [[organic chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]], as they relate to [[agriculture]]—agricultural [[production (economics)|production]], the [[food processing|processing of raw products into foods and beverages]], and environmental [[Environmental monitoring|monitoring]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]]. These studies emphasize the relationships between plants, [[animals]] and [[bacteria]] and their [[Natural environment|environment]]. As a branch of [[agricultural science]], agricultural chemistry studies the chemical compositions and reactions involved in the production, protection, and use of [[crop]]s and [[livestock]]. Its [[basic research|basic science]] aspects embrace, in addition to test-tube chemistry, all the life processes through which humans obtain food and fiber for themselves and feed for their animals. Its [[applied science]] and [[technology]] aspects are directed toward control of those processes to increase yields, improve quality, and reduce costs. One important branch of it, [[chemurgy]], is concerned chiefly with utilization of agricultural products as chemical [[raw material]]s.

==Sciences==

The goals of agricultural chemistry are to expand understanding of the causes and effects of biochemical reactions related to plant and animal growth, to reveal opportunities for controlling those reactions, and to develop chemical products that will provide the desired assistance or control. Every scientific discipline that contributes to agricultural progress depends in some way on chemistry. Hence agricultural chemistry is not a distinct discipline, but a common thread that ties together [[genetics]], [[physiology]], [[microbiology]], [[entomology]], and numerous other sciences that impinge on agriculture.

Chemical materials developed to assist in the production of food, feed, and fiber include scores of [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, and other [[pesticide]]s, plant growth regulators, [[fertilizer]]s, and animal feed supplements. Chief among these groups from the commercial point of view are manufactured fertilizers, synthetic pesticides (including herbicides), and supplements for feeds. The latter include both nutritional supplements (for example, [[mineral nutrients]]) and medicinal compounds for the prevention or control of disease.

Agricultural chemistry often aims at preserving or increasing the [[fertility (soil)|fertility of soil]], maintaining or improving the [[agricultural yield]], and improving the quality of the crop.

When agriculture is considered with [[ecology]], the [[sustainablility]] of an operation is considered. Modern agrochemical industry has gained a reputation for its [[profit maximization|maximising profits]] while violating sustainable and ecologically viable agricultural principles. [[Eutrophication]], the prevalence of [[genetically modified crops]] and the increasing concentration of chemicals in the food chain (e.g. [[persistent organic pollutant]]s) are only a few consequences of naive [[industrial agriculture]].
