The Dynamic Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation (DMM) is a transdisciplinary model describing the effect attachment relationships can have on human development and functioning.  It is especially focused on the effects of relationships between children and parents and between reproductive couples. It developed initially from attachment theory as developed by [[John Bowlby]] and [[Mary Ainsworth]], and many other theories, into a comprehensive model of adaptation to life's many dangers. The DMM was initially created by developmental psychologist [[Patricia McKinsey Crittenden]] and her colleagues including David DiLalla, Angelika Claussen, Andrea Landini, Steve Farnfield, and Susan Spieker.

A main tenant of the DMM is that exposure to danger drives neural development and adaptation to promote survival.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Crittenden|first1=Patricia M.|title=Assessing adult attachment: A dynamic-maturational approach to discourse analysis|last2=Landini|first2=Andrea|publisher=W.

== History ==
From the [[history of attachment theory]], British psychiatrist [[John Bowlby]] coalesced a coherent theory and is generally credited with creating the foundation for modern attachment theory. [[Mary Ainsworth]], an American psychologist who worked with Bowlby, developed the first scientific method to assess attachment, called the [[strange situation]]. Ainsworth initially assumed that parents and children fell into two basic attachment categories, secure and insecure. The results of her assessments led to the dramatic discovery that there are three patterns, one secure pattern and two completely different insecure patterns. She labeled these with the letters A, B, and C, with B representing the secure pattern.

Ainsworth's graduate students, including [[Mary Main]] and Patricia “Pat” Crittenden, made important developments to attachment science and theory. Both Main and Crittenden realized that the criteria Ainsworth was using did not allow for the attachment classification of a significant number of children. Main initially described most of this group as being disorganized, unable to organize an attachment strategy to help them gain physical proximity to their mothers.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Duschinsky|first=Robbie|date=2015|title=The Emergence of the Disorganized/Disoriented (D) Attachment Classification|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2015-04666-003.html|journal=History of Psychology|volume=18:1|issue=1|pages=32–46|doi=10.1037/a0038524|pmid=25664884|pmc=4321742|s2cid=13288083|via=APA}}</ref> Main and Solomon later redefined disorganized attachment.<ref name=":2" /> Decades of research were dedicated to exploring the concept of disorganized attachment, but ultimately the concept proved almost completely unhelpful.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last1=Granqvist|first1=Pehr|last2=Sroufe|first2=L.

Crittenden studied under Ainsworth in the 1980s, 10 years after Main. Because Crittenden initially focused on danger and survival, she rejected the idea that a significant portion of children could fail to organize an attachment strategy to survive.<ref name=":10">{{Cite journal|last1=Landa|first1=Sophie|last2=Duschinsky|first2=Robbie|date=2013|title=Letters from Ainsworth: Contesting the 'Organization' of Attachment|journal=Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=22|issue=2|pages=172–177|issn=1719-8429|pmc=3647635|pmid=23667365}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last1=Crittenden|first1=Patricia M.|title=Child maltreatment and attachment theory|date=1989-06-30|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cbo9780511665707.015|work=Child Maltreatment|pages=432–463|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37969-4|access-date=2020-11-20|last2=Ainsworth|first2=Mary D.

She also started her work after [[John Bowlby]] wrote the third book in his Attachment and Loss trilogy in 1980, Loss: Sadness and Depression.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|last=Bowlby, John|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24186|title=Attachment and loss|year=1982|isbn=0-465-00543-8|location=New York|oclc=24186}}</ref> In Chapter 4 of that book, Bowlby outlined his view that attachment was intimately connected with information processing and the defensive exclusion of information. He argued that common psychological defense mechanisms were actually efforts to keep certain types of information out of one's mind while considering issues and making decisions. Crittenden centered her work on these ideas.<ref name=":3" /> In a sense, she began where Bowlby and Ainsworth left off.

== DMM-attachment ==

=== Basic definition of DMM-attachment ===
Attachment is a system which involves a person's need to be protected from danger, and comforted especially after exposure to danger and a relationship with an attachment figure who can provide protection from danger and comfort. As a model centered on survival, it also involves a person's need to increase reproductive opportunities and protection of progeny.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crittenden|first=Patricia M.|date=2006|title=A dynamic-maturational model of attachment|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264219795|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy|volume=27|issue=2|pages=105–115|doi=10.1002/j.1467-8438.2006.tb00704.x}}</ref>

Particularly when the attachment system involves a caregiver and child, the relational interactions related to attachment needs shapes neural development and emotional and biological regulation processes in children, which has lifelong impacts.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last1=Kozlowska|first1=Kasia|url=https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9783030461836|title=Functional Somatic Symptoms in Children and Adolescents: A Stress-System Approach to Assessment and Treatment|last2=Scher|first2=Stephen|last3=Helgeland|first3=Helene|date=2020|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-3-030-46183-6|series=Palgrave Texts in Counselling and Psychotherapy|language=en}}</ref>

An attachment figure may be a parent, other close caregiver, or romantic partner, and has the qualities of having an affectively charged relationship, providing assistance in regulating emotions, protecting the person from being forced to handle something outside their developmental ability (Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)).<ref name=":1" />

Teachers, helping professionals and other people may function as an auxiliary attachment figure<ref name=":1" /> or transitional attachment figure to help get through a difficult experience.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" />

Danger can be objective (deep water, cliff edges, snakes) or subjective and relevant to only particular attachment patterns. For people who tend to use self-protective A-strategies, danger can include aggressive or dismissive parental responses, not doing the right thing, doing the wrong thing, expressing feelings especially if negative, and relying on others to meet needs. For people who tend to use self-protective C-strategies, danger can include lack of parental response, not expressing and satisfying feelings especially if negative, following someone else's rules which don't satisfy feelings, compromising, relying on the self to meet needs.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=McKinsey Crittenden|first=Patricia|date=1999|title=Chapter VII.

=== DMM contributions to the development of attachment theory ===
Crittenden and colleagues have developed a comprehensive set of attachment assessments to cover the lifespan. Since theory leads to scientific inquiry, and scientific findings add to theory, the DMM has advanced attachment knowledge in numerous ways. Crittenden and Landini describe many of these in there 2011 book ''Assessing adult attachment: A dynamic-maturational approach to discourse analysis''.

'''Maturational.''' DMM-attachment recognizes that humans are able to utilize more and more sophisticated self-protective attachment strategies as they age. Hence, attachment patterns can become increasingly complex with age. Infants begin with instinctive strategies such as smiling and reaching, and through behavioral learning develop an increasing array of ways to gain protection from danger from their caregivers. Thought and communication patterns are eventually added to a person's available strategies.

'''Strategies.''' Self-protective strategies are not diagnoses or mental health disorders. Strategies are the ways people get their needs met. The strategies may be quite functional in certain types of relationships, and dysfunctional in other relationships if not adjusted. Selecting a specific response in a specific situation is not necessarily dictated by a strategy preference, it is situation and context driven, which Crittenden describes as a dispositional representation (DR).

'''Dimensional.''' Strategies are described as dimensional rather than categorical. As demonstrated on the DMM Circumplex, they range from exposing people to more or less risk (around the outside of the Circumplex), and more or less intensity (from the center of the Circumplex to the outer rim). The DMM eschews the terms secure and insecure, although it is used in various DMM literature.

'''Function of behavior.''' Attachment behaviors and communication styles do not necessarily define the strategy pattern, because they are seen as being functional. That is, behaviors seek to achieve a self-protective purpose which needs to be understood to understand how it fits into the pattern. For example, bright smiling can serve several self-protective purposes. In A-strategies it can function to hide pain. In C-strategies it can function to disarm prior or following aggression.

=== DMM foundations and support ===
The DMM has and continues to incorporate all relevant disciplines. It incorporates all the disciplines Bowlby utilized, including psychoanalytic, ethology, general systems theory, evolutionary biology, cognitive information processing, and cognitive neurosciences. It incorporates all the disciplines Ainsworth utilized, including naturalistic observation, and empirical grounding of attachment theory. DMM additions include genetics, epigenetics, neurobiology, sociology, developmental psychology, behavioral learning theory, Piaget cognitive development, Eriksonian development, social learning theory, theory of mind, cognitive psychology, Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development, Vygotsky and Bronfenbrenner's social ecology, transactional theory, family systems theory, polyvagal theory, mindfulness theory, and Functional Somatic Symptom theory.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Crittenden|first=Patricia M.|title=A new perspective on personality disorders|url=https://familyrelationsinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/personality_disorders.pdf|access-date=8 November 2020|website=familyrelationsinstitute.org}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

The DMM is supported by the International Association for the Study of Attachment (IASA). The Family Relations Institute (FRI) is the primary organization teaching DMM theory and assessments. The Attachment Studies programme at Roehampton University, U.K., includes the DMM and some of its assessments.

IASA maintains a [https://familyrelationsinstitute.org/materials/publications/ list of publications] describing the DMM. There are over 500 such publications.

== DMM attachment patterns ==
DMM attachment patterns can viewed several different ways.

In its simplest form, the DMM offers a 3-part model using the A, B, C patterns.

Some populations of clients tend to be heavily oriented to either a cognitive or affective information process orientation, such as clinical populations.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last1=Crittenden|first1=Patricia M|last2=Robson|first2=Katrina|last3=Tooby|first3=Alison|last4=Fleming|first4=Charles|date=2017-07-01|title=Are mothers' protective attachment strategies related to their children's strategies?|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1359104517704027|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=358–377|doi=10.1177/1359104517704027|pmid=28429614|s2cid=4824676|issn=1359-1045}}</ref> In these contexts, the DMM offers a basic 2-part model.

The DMM Circumplex graphically depicts 22 adult patterns. There are some sub-patterns, such as A3- and A4-, and A and C patterns can be combined, such as A4/C5-6 or A3-4/C2.

== Information processing and transformation ==
The DMM is fundamentally an information processing model, and self-protective attachment strategies are built around two primary sources of information available to humans: cognitive and affective.<ref name=":0" />

Cognitive information is described as temporally sequenced, as illustrated with “if/then” statements. Affective information is described as being emotionally intense experiences. Attachment A-strategies tend to emphasize cognitive information and de-emphasize or exclude affective information. Attachment C-strategies do the opposite, emphasizing affective information and de-emphasizing or excluding cognitive information. Attachment B-strategies tend to blend both types of information as they process experiences in the world, although they can emphasize one or the other. [yellow]

Crittenden describes information processing as involving four main steps:

# Perceive the information, or not;
# Interpret the information in some way, or not;
# Select response of some sort, or not; and
# Implement behavior of some sort, or not.

An example to illustrate is a child who is feeling a strong emotion. Will the parent 1) perceive their child's emotion? If so, will they 2) interpret it as them being weak, overly-needy, or interrupting what they are doing? Will the parent 3) consider selecting a response, and if so which one? Will the parent implement it, or decide to ignore their child's emotional experience?

=== Transformation of information ===
At each stage of information processing, information is transformed as it is converted from what it is, to a representation of what it is in the mind. A test result, a smile, and divorce papers, come to mean something in the mind through a neural process. The DMM<ref name=":0" /> currently identifies seven ways information can be transformed, each of which represents increased transformation:

'''Truly, erroneously, distorted, omitted, falsified, denied, delusively'''

A child's strong negative emotion, continuing with that example, could be seen:

# '''Truly''', and provide information with which to ease the child's distress
# '''Erroneously''', over or under-interpreted, such that a parental response might be non-productive, such as giving too much or not enough attention to the distress
# '''Distorted''', where some portion of the information is emphasized and the other de-emphasized, such as acknowledging the distress but emphasizing that it will go away on its own
# '''Omitted''', so that some portion of the information is discarded
# '''Falsified''', where the emotion is changed from distressed to hungry
# '''Denied''', where the emotion is actively avoided
# '''Delusionally''', where new and incorrect information is created to replace the true information, such as thinking the child is laughing or is signaling a desire to play

=== Memory Systems ===
DMM assessments look for memory system function as described by memory researchers such as [[Endel Tulving]] and [[Daniel Schacter]]. The memory systems assessed by the DMM method are somatic, procedural, semantic, imaged, connotative, episodic, and reflective integration.<ref name=":0" />

== DMM attachment assessments ==
[[Attachment measures]], or assessments, assess the self-protective strategy of a person. In infancy and early childhood, it is assessed with respect to specific attachment figures whereas beginning in the school years a generalized strategy is assessed. Assessments generally use a video-recorded interaction or an audio-recorded interview. In observed assessments behavior is assessed, and with interviews the discourse, or manner of speech, is primarily assessed. Crittenden and others have developed a range of DMM assessments intended to cover the lifespan.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Farnfield|first1=Steve|last2=Hautamäki|first2=Airi|last3=Nørbech|first3=Peder|last4=Sahhar|first4=Nicola|date=2010-07-01|title=DMM assessments of attachment and adaptation: Procedures, validity and utility|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1359104510364315|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=313–328|doi=10.1177/1359104510364315|pmid=20603420|s2cid=206707459|issn=1359-1045}}</ref><ref name=":11">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/841895216|title=The Routledge handbook of attachment : assessment|others=Farnfield, Steve, Holmes, Paul|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-53824-4|location=London|oclc=841895216}}</ref> Assessments generally assess individuals, caregivers (usually parents) and/or children, and can assess non-primary caregivers such as close grandparents and foster parents. Some DMM assessments are considered valid and reliable, and others are still in a development and validation phase which generally takes at least 10 years. IASA considers an assessment valid and reliable if it has a minimum of five published studies supporting it, including studies that the author of the assessment did not author, and that address several of the following:

* Concurrent validity
* Longitudinal validity
* Face validity
* Predictive validity
* Clinical utility.

IASA’s [https://www.iasa-dmm.org/family_court_protocol/ Family Court Protocol] requires that assessments in a development phase should not be used forensically, particularly in court cases where children and parents could lose access to each other. IASA also argues that individual assessments are only reliable if the assessor (coder) is qualified by having passed a standardized reliability test and maintained their qualification.

=== Infant Care-Index (ICI) ===
The ICI consists of a 3-minute interaction of a caregiver and child (a 2-person, or dyadic, relationship) aged from birth to 15 months.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last=Hautamäki|first=Airi|title=Screening for maternal relationships at risk with the CARE-index|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-53825-1|editor-last=Farnfield and Holmes|location=London|chapter=3}}</ref> The ICI assesses interaction, not attachment (which does not develop until 9–11 months of age).  The ICI assesses a dyad's interpersonal functioning under non-threatening play conditions and clusters dyads as  sensitive to good enough, at mild risk of parenting difficulties, or at high risk of parenting difficulties, including infant neglect and maltreatment. It was developed by Crittenden with input from Ainsworth and Bowlby.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crittenden|first=Patricia M.|date=1981|title=Abusing, neglecting, problematic, and adequate dyads: Differentiating by patterns of interaction|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23083982?origin=JSTOR-pdf&seq=1|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly of Behavior and Development|volume=27|issue=3|pages=201–218|jstor=23083982|via=JSTOR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Crittenden|first1=Patricia M.|last2=DiLalla|first2=David L.|date=1988|title=Compulsive compliance: The development of an inhibitory coping strategy in infancy|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF00914268|journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology|language=en|volume=16|issue=5|pages=585–599|doi=10.1007/BF00914268|pmid=3235749|s2cid=30494458|issn=0091-0627}}</ref> The ICI is considered a valid and reliable assessment and has more than 60 published studies.<ref name=":8" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Forcada-Guex|first1=M.|last2=Pierrehumbert|first2=B.|last3=Borghini|first3=A.|last4=Moessinger|first4=A.|last5=Muller-Nix|first5=C.|date=2006-07-01|title=Early Dyadic Patterns of Mother-Infant Interactions and Outcomes of Prematurity at 18 Months|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2005-1145|journal=Pediatrics|volume=118|issue=1|pages=e107–e114|doi=10.1542/peds.2005-1145|pmid=16818525|s2cid=9258568|issn=0031-4005}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Parfitt|first1=Ylva|last2=Pike|first2=Alison|last3=Ayers|first3=Susan|date=2013-11-21|title=Infant Developmental Outcomes: A Family Systems Perspective|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/icd.1830|journal=Infant and Child Development|volume=23|issue=4|pages=353–373|doi=10.1002/icd.1830|issn=1522-7227}}</ref>

=== Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) ===
The [[Strange situation|SSP]] is the classic assessment of attachment developed by Ainsworth. Almost all other assessments of attachment are validated against it. The SSP consists of eight episodes over 21–23 minutes. Unlike the ICI which assesses only dyadic synchrony under the favorable condition of play, the SSP uses threat to elicit the infant’s pattern of attachment. Threat, or relationship danger, comes in several forms such as the stranger coming into the observation room with parent and child (episode 3), the parent leaving the child in the room with the stranger (episode 4), the parent later leaving the child in the room alone (episode 6), and the stranger re-entering the room without the parent (episode 7). The parent returns and the stranger leaves in the eighth and final episode. The infant’s behavior on the parent's return is the primary basis for classification into one of three major strategies, labeled A, B, and C.

The SSP was developed for 11-month-old infants. It has been used for older infants, but, as infants age, their tolerance for separation increases and the behavioral markers defined by Ainsworth fit less well, resulting in higher proportions of infants classified as secure, including maltreated infants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crittenden|first=Patricia M.|date=1985|title=Maltreated Infants: Vulnerability and Resilience|url=https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7610.1985.tb01630.x|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=85–96|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1985.tb01630.x|pmid=3972934|issn=1469-7610}}</ref> In the DMM, this problem was resolved by limiting the age range to 11–15 months,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Farnfield|first=Steve|last2=Hautamäki|first2=Airi|last3=Nørbech|first3=Peder|last4=Sahhar|first4=Nicola|date=2010|title=DMM assessments of attachment and adaptation: Procedures, validity and utility|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45094456_DMM_assessments_of_attachment_and_adaption_Procedures_validity_and_utility|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=313–328|doi=10.1177/1359104510364315|issn=1359-1045}}</ref> and developing, with Ainsworth’s assistance, an alternating A/C classification and pre-compulsive and pre-coercive patterns.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crittenden|first=Patricia M.|date=1985|title=Social Networks, Quality of Child Rearing, and Child Development|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1130245|journal=Child Development|volume=56|issue=5|pages=1299–1313|doi=10.2307/1130245|jstor=1130245|issn=0009-3920|via=JSTOR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Pleshkova|first1=Natalia L.|last2=Muhamedrahimov|first2=Rifkat J.|date=2010-07-01|title=Quality of attachment in St Petersburg (Russian Federation): A sample of family-reared infants|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1359104510365453|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=355–362|doi=10.1177/1359104510365453|pmid=20603423|s2cid=38297269|issn=1359-1045}}</ref> These include A1-2 or C1-2 patterns, and clear evidence for A+ or C+ patterns (which involves more intense use of self-protective strategies).

=== School-age Assessment of Attachment (SAA) ===
The SAA involves an audio recorded interview which is transcribed and analyzed with discourse analysis techniques, for children aged 6–13 years. In the assessment, a child is given story cards which represent increasing levels of danger, and they are asked to make up a story that describes what is depicted on the card, and then, if they had any similar experience in their life, asked a series of exploratory questions. It assesses the child's generalized attachment pattern, self-protective strategies, pattern of information processing, and possible unresolved trauma and loss.  It was initially developed in 1997 by Crittenden, has been tested in eight research studies, and is considered to provide discriminate validity.<ref name=":6" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Crittenden|first1=Patricia|last2=Kozlowska|first2=Kasia|last3=Landini|first3=Andrea|date=2010-02-22|title=Assessing attachment in school-age children|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1359104509356741|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume=15|issue=2|pages=185–208|doi=10.1177/1359104509356741|pmid=20176770|s2cid=11582111|issn=1359-1045}}</ref> The SAA was the subject of a special section of Clinical Child Psychology & Psychiatry, [https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/ccp/22/3 Volume 22 Issue 3, July 2017].

=== Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) ===
The DMM-AAI is considered one of the most comprehensive attachment assessments, and is well validated. It was initially created by Nancy George and Carol Kaplan in, and later developed with Mary Main in 1985.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=George|first1=Carol|title=The Adult Attachment Interview [protocol], unpublished manuscript|last2=Kaplan|first2=Nancy|last3=Main|first3=Mary|publisher=University of California at Berkeley|year=1985}}</ref> Crittenden and Landini slightly modified it with DMM theory in 2011.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|last1=Baldoni|first1=Franco|last2=Minghetti|first2=Mattia|last3=Craparo|first3=Giuseppe|last4=Facondini|first4=Elisa|last5=Cena|first5=Loredana|last6=Schimmenti|first6=Adriano|date=2018-01-08|title=Comparing Main, Goldwyn, and Hesse (Berkeley) and Crittenden (DMM) coding systems for classifying Adult Attachment Interview transcripts: an empirical report|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14616734.2017.1421979|journal=Attachment & Human Development|volume=20|issue=4|pages=423–438|doi=10.1080/14616734.2017.1421979|pmid=29308700|hdl=11379/501534|s2cid=205815474|issn=1461-6734}}</ref> It assesses self-protective attachment strategies, patterns of information processing, a possible unresolved trauma and loss which distort behavior and information processing, an over-riding condition which causes information distortion such as depression and triangulation in childhood, memory system usage, and reflective function. The assessment involves asking a person a series of structured questions, transcribing the audio recording, and applying a complex set of discourse analysis techniques. The interview takes 60–90 minutes, and it can take hours or days to analyze. Learning to code reliably generally takes several years.

''Assessing adult attachment: A dynamic-maturational approach to discourse analysis (2011)'' is the coding manual for the DMM-AAI, and is publicly available.

=== DMM Assessments undergoing the validation process ===
The following assessments have not been validated and are not considered by IASA to be acceptable for use forensically.

'''Toddler Care-Index (TCI)'''

The TCI video records a 5-minute interaction of a caregiver and child aged from 15 to 72 months. It assesses the general attachment characteristics of a specific dyad, such as mother and child or father and chid. The TCI is considered a useful assessment, but has not been validated by research. It was developed by Crittenden.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crittenden|first=Patricia M.|title=Toddler CARE-Index (TCI) Manual, unpublished training manual|publisher=Family Relations Institute|year=2014|location=Miami, FL}}</ref>

'''Transition to Adulthood Attachment Interview (TAAI)'''

The TAAI is a modified version of the AAI for adolescents aged about 14–25 years old. It was modified from the AAI by Crittenden in 2005 and 2020.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crittenden|first=Patricia M.|title=Transition to Adulthood Attachment Interview (TAAI), unpublished training manual|publisher=Family Relations Institute|year=2005|location=Miami, FL}}</ref><ref>Landini, A. , Kozlowska, K., Davies, F., & Chudleigh, K.

Gießen: Psychosozial-Verlag.</ref>

'''Meaning of the Child interview (MotC)'''

The MotC is an interview of a parent which is transcribed and assessed with discourse analysis techniques. It is similar to the AAI, but differs in important ways. The MotC assesses a parent's general pattern of attachment, sensitivity and level of responsiveness to their child, the degree and forms of control a parent may utilize, and self-reflective function (mentalization). It was developed by Benjamin Grey and Steve Farnfield in 2017, and uses DMM theory and methods.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Grey|first1=Ben|last2=Farnfield|first2=Steve|date=2017|title=The Meaning of the Child Interview: A new procedure for assessing and understanding parent–child relationships of 'at-risk' families|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1359104516633495|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=204–218|doi=10.1177/1359104516633495|pmid=26940120|s2cid=206708220|issn=1359-1045}}</ref>

'''Child Attachment and Play Assessment (CAPA)'''

The CAPA assesses the attachment and exploration systems of children aged 7–11. It uses an interview process similar to the SAA. It was developed by Steven Farnfield, and uses DMM theory and methods.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Farnfield|first=Steve|date=2016|title=The Child Attachment and Play Assessment (CAPA): Validation of a new approach to coding narrative stems with children ages 3–11 years.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0038726|journal=International Journal of Play Therapy|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=217–229|doi=10.1037/a0038726|issn=1939-0629}}</ref>

== Applications ==

=== Law ===
The DMM and it's methods are useful for discourse and argument analysis, client counseling, forensic purposes, and conflict management. At its heart, attachment theory involves the conflict of contradictory information, and information processing involves a conflict between the emphasis and de-emphasis of information.<ref name=":7" />

Because information processing involves the defensive exclusion and inclusion of information, it can affect how people make decisions and communicate. The DMM-AAI discourse analysis method is specifically designed to “understand the meanings behind unclear communication * * * distorted communication and dysfunctional behavior.”<ref name=":0" /> (Crittenden and Landini, p.&nbsp;1, 2011.)

Attachment assessments can be used in court cases<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Main|first1=Mary|last2=Hesse|first2=Erik|last3=Hesse|first3=Siegfried|date=July 2011|title=Attachment theory and research: overview with suggested applications to child custody|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-1617.2011.01383.x|journal=Family Court Review|volume=49|issue=3|pages=426–463|doi=10.1111/j.1744-1617.2011.01383.x|issn=1531-2445}}</ref> and forensically if done by a trained and reliable coder.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Spieker|first1=Susan J.|last2=Crittenden|first2=Patricia M.|date=2018|title=Can Attachment Inform Decision-Making in Child Protection and Forensic Settings?|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/imhj.21746|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|language=en|volume=39|issue=6|pages=625–641|doi=10.1002/imhj.21746|pmid=30395356|issn=1097-0355}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=George|first1=Carol|last2=Isaacs|first2=Marla B.|last3=Marvin|first3=Robert S.|date=July 2011|title=Incorporating Attachment Assessment into Custody Evaluations: the Case of a 2-year-old and Her Parents|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-1617.2011.01386.x|journal=Family Court Review|volume=49|issue=3|pages=483–500|doi=10.1111/j.1744-1617.2011.01386.x|issn=1531-2445}}</ref> [Spieker & Crittenden, 2018] The IASA [https://www.iasa-dmm.org/family_court_protocol/ Family Court Protocol] is designed to promote attachment information in a way that is as comprehensive and reliable as attachment assessments can allow, and which also supplements other information about individuals, family members, and family systems. FRI's Family Functional Formula is comprehensive and valuable, if expensive, method to assess a family system.

=== Research ===
The DMM theory and assessment methods are useful for conducting attachment assessments. Because there are DMM assessments to cover the lifespan,<ref name=":11" /> they can be used to assess a family system.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crittenden|first=Patricia|title=Attachment and family therapy|last2=Dallos|first2=Rudi|last3=Landini|first3=Andrea|last4=Kozlowska|first4=Kasia|publisher=Open University Press|year=2014|isbn=9780335235902|location=London}}</ref> The DMM approach appears to provide more precise results with populations of people whose childhood involved adverse childhood experiences or parents who consistently used cold, inconsistent, harsh or controlling parenting techniques or engaged in parental conflict or failed to protect or comfort their children.<ref name=":6" /> It appears that between the DMM and Berkeley assessment methods, the DMM method can better delineate between secure and insecure attachment classifications, and also the quantity of A, C, and mixed AC patterns.<ref name=":12" /> This is likely because the DMM is focused on a person’s response to danger and fear, and describes the attachment system’s primary purpose as being to organize self-protective responses.<ref name=":12" /><ref name=":10" />

== Comparison to other attachment models ==
Ainsworth developed the ABC model in the 1960's and 1970's. It was the foundation for the ABC+D (sometimes called Berkeley) model<ref name=":13" /> and the DMM.<ref name=":9" />

The newer ABC+D and DMM models both describe the attachment system, use Ainsworth's basic ABC patterns, and use the SSP and AAI attachment assessments. Ainsworth's ABC model ultimately described 9 subcategories, A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, C1, and C2. The newer models went on to identify additional basic subcategories, 24 in the adult version of the ABC+D model and 29 in the DMM, and each describe additional AC combinations.<ref name=":12" />

While they both describe the effect of the attachment system on information processing and memory function, and both describe the impacts of trauma and loss, the DMM provides more focus and detail on these elements. The DMM utilizes more memory systems and considers more types of trauma. In the ABC+D model meaning is assigned to behavior, whereas the DMM looks for the function of behavior to define its meaning.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":12" />

The ABC+D model is focused on safety, is categorical, describes linear developmental trajectories, describes attachment with different concepts and terms for children and adults, and uses Bowlby's “internal working model” concept. The DMM is focused on danger, is dimensional, describes potentially branching developmental pathways, describes the maturational development of self-protective strategies, and neurobiological systems and processes.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":0" />

Landa and Duschinsky describe the historical development of both models to offer an explanation about why and how they differ.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":3" /> The ABC+D model initially relied on normative (average) research populations. Initial DMM research utilized both normative and maltreated populations, so it had a richer data set to work from. Each model also make different foundational assumptions. The DMM assumes, as did Bowlby and Ainsworth, that a primary purpose of the attachment system for children is to maintain a the attachment figure's availability. In the ABC+D model, as defined by Mary Main and Judith Solomon, the purpose is to maintain proximity. (Not all attachment theorists who use the ABC+D model use the same definitions as Mary Main. Some use a definition identical, or nearly so to Crittenden's.)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cicchetti|first=Dante|last2=Serafica|first2=Felicisima C.|date=1981|title=Interplay among behavioral systems: Illustrations from the study of attachment, affiliation, and wariness in young children with Down's syndrome.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.17.1.36|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=36–49|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.17.1.36|issn=0012-1649}}</ref>

The DMM rejects the concept of disorganized attachment, instead arguing that people can organize a response to almost all forms of danger, even if the response is increased aggression or ignoring physical and psychological pain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spieker|first=Susan J.|last2=Crittenden|first2=Patricia M.|date=2010|title=Comparing the validity of two approaches to attachment theory: Disorganization versus danger-informed organization in the preschool years|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|volume=15|pages=97–120}}</ref> Granqvist and 42 other attachment experts agreed that the concept of disorganized attachment, as understood in 2017, has little or no utility, and may not be used clinically.<ref name=":5" /> However, Duschinsky points out that it is unclear why the disorganized concept did not live up to its promise, nor what the significance is of the different definitions described above, and it may be that Main's definitions have utility for some purpose which has yet to be discovered.<ref name=":10" />

The ABC+D model was widely accepted by the research community from about 1990-2017, although Main was calling for caution in the use of disorganized attachment in clinical and forensic settings by at least 2011.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Main|first=Mary|last2=Hesse|first2=Erik|last3=Hesse|first3=Siegfried|date=2011|title=ATTACHMENT THEORY AND RESEARCH: OVERVIEW WITH SUGGESTED APPLICATIONS TO CHILD CUSTODY|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-1617.2011.01383.x|journal=Family Court Review|volume=49|issue=3|pages=426–463|doi=10.1111/j.1744-1617.2011.01383.x|issn=1531-2445}}</ref> In 2018 van IJzendoorn et al. pointed out the [[replication crisis]] of ABC+D-based attachment assessments, and called for the attachment community to revisit its foundations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Ijzendoorn|first=Marinus H.|last2=Steele|first2=Miriam|last3=Granqvist|first3=Pehr|date=2018|title=ON EXACTITUDE IN SCIENCE: A MAP OF THE EMPIRE THE SIZE OF THE EMPIRE|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/imhj.21751|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|volume=39|issue=6|pages=652–655|doi=10.1002/imhj.21751|issn=0163-9641}}</ref>

== Criticisms ==
After Granqvist, and 42 other authors (2017),<ref name=":5" /> clearly identified the limits and misapplication of the disorganized attachment category, Van IJzendoorn, et al., and Crittenden and Spieker exchanged a series of comments and criticisms about the ABC+D and DMM attachment models in the November/December issue of Infant Mental Health ([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/10970355/2018/39/6 volume 39, number 6, 2018]). Van IJzendoorn criticized the DMM for having too many classifications, 29 basic patterns, compared to the ABC+D model which has 24. While conceding that assessments using the ABC+D attachment model cannot be used forensically, he argued neither could DMM assessments since they did not meet the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard required in court.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Van Ijzendoorn|first1=Marinus H.|last2=Bakermans|first2=Jacob J.W.|last3=Steele|first3=Miriam|last4=Granqvist|first4=Pehr|date=2018-10-17|title=Diagnostic use of crittenden's attachment measures in family court is not beyond a reasonable doubt|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/imhj.21747|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|volume=39|issue=6|pages=642–646|doi=10.1002/imhj.21747|pmid=30329168|issn=0163-9641}}</ref> However, “more likely than not” is the correct standard in civil (non-criminal) court cases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Crittenden|first1=Patricia M.|last2=Spieker|first2=Susan J.|date=2018|title=Dynamic Maturational Model of Attachment and Adaptation versus ABC+D assessments of attachment in child protection and treatment: reply to Van IJzendoorn, Bakermans, Steele, & Granqvist|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/imhj.21750|journal=Infant Mental Health Journal|volume=39|issue=6|pages=647–651|doi=10.1002/imhj.21750|pmid=30394537|issn=0163-9641}}</ref>  Van IJzendoorn argued DMM assessments lack validity as much as ABC+D assessments do, which Crittenden disputed. Van IJzendoorn found fault with Crittenden's position that the DMM is still developing. Crittenden responded that a complex and transdisciplinary model of human development must always continue to add new information and develop.

Other people echo Van Ijzendoorn's point about complexity in terms of becoming a reliable coder and being able to use a DMM-assessment to testify forensically about a particular person's self-protective strategies in a particular context. The PAA and SAA can take a year or more to learn, and the AAI can take several years. In fact, there are few people in the world who can use DMM-assessments forensically, particularly under the requirements of IASA's Family Court Protocol.

David Pocock found the DMM useful, and powerful, and at the same raising the risk of reductionism and reification. The DMM attempts to make it clear that people are not reduced to "a C3" or "an A4", instead they are described as using strategies from those patterns. Reification involves making something abstract concrete, turning an attachment strategy used in one situation into what completely defines the person. He echoes common concerns that attachment, and the DMM in particular, is such a powerful model it is potentially easy to fall into the use of counterproductive shortcuts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pocock|first=David|date=2010|title=The DMM - wow!
