'''Backcasting''' is a planning method that starts with defining a desirable future and then works backwards to identify policies and programs that will connect that specified future to the present.<ref>Page 12.

[[University of Victoria]], Victoria BC.</ref> The fundamentals of the method were outlined by John B. Robinson from the [[University of Waterloo]] in 1990.<ref name="Robinson 1990">Robinson, John B. 1990.

While [[forecasting]] involves predicting the future based on current trend analysis, backcasting approaches the challenge of discussing the future from the opposite direction; it is "a method in which the future desired conditions are envisioned and steps are then defined to attain those conditions, rather than taking steps that are merely a continuation of present methods extrapolated into the future".<ref>Holmberg & Robèrt (2000), p.294.</ref>

In statistics and data analysis, backcasting can be considered to be the opposite of forecasting; thus:
* ''forecasting'' involves the prediction of the future (''unknown'') values of the [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variables]] based on ''known'' values of the [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]].
* ''backcasting'' involves the prediction of the ''unknown'' values of the independent variables that '''''might''''' have existed, in order to explain the ''known'' values of the dependent variable.<ref name="Stan Development Team">{{cite book |last=Stan Development Team |date=2014-07-20 |title=Stan Modeling Language: User's Guide and Reference Manual |url=http://mc-stan.org/manual.html |location=pg. 39 |publisher=Stan |access-date=2014-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084023/http://mc-stan.org/manual.html |archive-date=2014-08-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Backcasting vs. Forecasting ==
[[File:Backcasting.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of backcasting.<ref>Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.147.</ref>]]
Backcasting, a term first coined by John B. Robinson in 1982,<ref>See Robinson (1982, 1988, 2003).</ref> involves establishing the description of a very definite and very specific future situation. It then involves an imaginary moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the future to the present to reveal the mechanism through which that particular specified future could be attained from the present.<ref>Robinson's backcasting approach is very similar to the ''anticipatory scenarios'' of Ducot and Lubben (1980), and Bunn and Salo (1993).</ref>

Backcasting is not concerned with predicting the future:
::The major distinguishing characteristic of backcasting analyses is the concern, not with likely energy futures, but with how desirable futures can be attained. It is thus explicitly [[normative]], involving "working backwards" from a particular future end-point to the present to determine what policy measures would be required to reach that future.<ref>Derborg (1996), p.814.</ref>

According to Jansen (1994, p.&nbsp;503):
::Within the framework of technological development, “forecasting” concerns the extrapolation of developments towards the future and the exploration of achievements that can be realized through technology in the long term. Conversely, the reasoning behind “backcasting” is: on the basis of an interconnecting picture of demands technology must meet in the future — “sustainability criteria” — to direct and determine the process that technology development must take and possibly also the pace at which this development process must take effect.
::Backcasting [is] both an important aid in determining the direction technology development must take and in specifying the targets to be set for this purpose. As such, backcasting is an ideal search toward determining the nature and scope of the technological challenge posed by sustainable development, and it can thus serve to direct the search process toward new — sustainable — technology.

==Practical applications==
Backcasting is increasingly used in urban planning and resource management of water and energy. It was used by [[Peter Gleick]] and colleagues at the [[Pacific Institute]] in a 1995 study on California water policy, as an alternative to traditional California water planning approaches.<ref>Gleick, P.H., P. Loh, S.V. Gomez, J. Morrison. 1995. California Water 2020: A Sustainable Vision. Pacific Institute, Oakland, California (May 1995)</ref> In 2006, the [[Capital Regional District]] Water Services, which services the greater [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] area in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], committed to backcasting to the year 2050 as a formal element of all future strategic water planning initiatives.<ref>http://www.crd.bc.ca/minutes/wateradvisorycommitt_/2006_/dec12/dec12.pdf</ref>

Backcasting is a key component of the [[soft energy path]], a concept developed by [[Amory Lovins]] after the shock of the [[1973 energy crisis]] in the United States.<ref>"Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?" published in Foreign Affairs, in October 1976</ref>

Backcasting from Sustainability Principles, or [[System conditions of sustainability]] is a key concept of the '[[Strategic sustainable development|Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development]]' pioneered by [[Karl-Henrik Robèrt]], founder of [[The Natural Step]], an international nonprofit organization dedicated to applied research for sustainability, in cooperation with a global academic [http://www.alliance-ssd.org Alliance for Strategic Sustainable Development ] which links universities which cooperate with businesses, and other NGOs. It has been refined and tested by peer-review and application within businesses (widely known examples are: Interface, Nike, Whistler).

Backcasting is used in climate reconstruction or cosmology to determine the conditions (i.e., values of unknown independent variables) that existed in the distant past based on ''known'' (more accurately estimated) values of past dependent variables.<ref name="Stan Development Team"/>
