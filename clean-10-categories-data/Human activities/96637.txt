A '''confidence trick''' is an attempt to [[defraud]] a person or group after first gaining their [[trust (emotion)|trust]]. Confidence tricks exploit victims using their [[credulity]], [[naïveté]], [[compassion]], [[vanity]], [[Moral responsibility|irresponsibility]], and [[greed]]. Researchers have defined confidence tricks as "a distinctive species of fraudulent conduct ... intending to further voluntary exchanges that are not mutually beneficial", as they "benefit con operators ('con men') at the expense of their victims (the 'marks')".<ref name=Huang18>{{cite journal |first1=Lindsey |last1=Huang |first2=Barak |last2=Orbach |title=Con Men and Their Enablers: The Anatomy of Confidence Games |journal=Social Research: An International Quarterly |year=2018 |volume=85 |issue=4 |pages=795–822  |url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3228077}}</ref>

==Terminology==
Synonyms include '''con''', '''confidence game''', '''confidence scheme''', '''ripoff''', '''scam''', and '''stratagem'''. The perpetrator of a confidence trick (or "con trick") is often referred to as a confidence (or "con") man, con-artist, or a "[[wikt:grifter|grifter]]". [[William Thompson (confidence man)|Samuel Thompson]] (1821–1856) was the original "confidence man". Thompson was a clumsy swindler who asked his victims to express confidence in him by giving him money or their watch rather than gaining their confidence in a more nuanced way. A few people trusted Thompson with their money and watches.<ref name=Braucher15>{{cite journal |first1=Jean |last1=Braucher |first2=Barak |last2=Orbach  |title=Scamming: The Misunderstood Confidence Man |journal=Yale Journal of Law & Humanities |year=2015 |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=249–292  |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2314071 |s2cid=148270133 }}</ref> Thompson was arrested in July 1849.

Reporting about this arrest, James Houston, a reporter for the ''[[New York Herald]]'', publicized Thompson by naming him the "Confidence Man".<ref name=Braucher15/> Although Thompson was an unsuccessful scammer, he gained the reputation as a genius operator mostly because Houston's satirical tone was not understood as such.<ref name=Braucher15 /> The ''National Police Gazette'' coined the term "confidence game" a few weeks after Houston first used the name "confidence man".<ref name=Braucher15 />

A confidence trick is also known as a con game, a con, a scam, a grift, a hustle, a bunko (or bunco), a swindle, a flimflam, a gaffle, or a bamboozle. The intended victims are known as marks, suckers, stooges, mugs, rubes, or gulls (from the word ''gullible''). When accomplices are employed, they are known as [[shill]]s.

===Short and long cons===
{{Anchor|short con|Short con|small con|Small con}}A short con or "small con" is a fast swindle which takes just minutes. It typically aims to rob the victim of everything in his wallet.<ref>{{harvnb|Maurer|1999|loc=Ch. 8. Short-Con Games}}</ref>

{{Anchor|long con|Long con|big con|Big con|long game|Long game}}A "long con" or "big con" (also, chiefly {{lang-en-GB|long game}})<ref name="NOOB">{{cite web|url=http://britishisms.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/the-long-game/|title=The long game|last=Yagoda|first=Ben|work=Not One-off Britishisms|date=June 5, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707084040/http://britishisms.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/the-long-game/|archive-date=July 7, 2014}} This language blog, while not a reliable etymological source, provides statistically gathered usage data that demonstrates neutral as well as critical usage, and that it is of British origin, only recently making notable inroads into American English.</ref> is a scam that unfolds over several days or weeks; it may involve a team of swindlers, and even props, sets, extras, costumes, and scripted lines. It aims to rob the victim of huge sums of money or valuables, often by getting him or her to empty out banking accounts and borrow from family members.<ref>{{harvnb|Reading|2012|loc=Ch. 1. Confidence}}</ref>

==Stages of the con==
In ''Confessions of a Confidence Man'', Edward H. Smith lists the "six definite steps or stages of growth" of a confidence game.<ref name="smith">{{cite book |first=Edward H. |last=Smith |title=Confessions of a Confidence Man: A Handbook for Suckers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cyq8QAAACAAJ |year=1923 |publisher=Scientific American Publishing |pages=35–37}}</ref> He notes that some steps may be omitted.

;Foundation work
:Preparations are made in advance of the game, including the hiring of any assistants required and studying the background knowledge needed for the role.
;Approach
:The victim is approached or contacted.
;Build-up
:The victim is given an opportunity to profit from participating in a scheme. The victim's greed is encouraged, such that their rational judgment of the situation might be impaired.
;Pay-off or convincer
:The victim receives a small payout as a demonstration of the scheme's purported effectiveness. This may be a real amount of money or faked in some way. In a [[gambling]] con, the victim is allowed to win several small bets. In a [[stock market]] con, the victim is given fake [[dividend]]s.
;The "hurrah"
:A sudden manufactured crisis or change of events forces the victim to act or make a decision immediately. This is the point at which the con succeeds or fails. With a financial scam, the con artist may tell the victim that the "window of opportunity" to make a large investment in the scheme is about to suddenly close forever.
;The in-and-in
:A conspirator (in on the con, but assumes the role of an interested bystander) puts an amount of money into the same scheme as the victim, to add an appearance of legitimacy. This can reassure the victim, and give the con man greater control when the deal has been completed.

In addition, some games require a "[[corroboration]]" step, particularly those involving a fake, but purportedly "rare item" of "great value". This usually includes the use of an accomplice who plays the part of an uninvolved (initially skeptical) third party, who later confirms the claims made by the con man.<ref name="smith"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Rossi |first1=Richard |title=Canaan Land |date=April 16, 2020 |publisher=Amazon |isbn=979-8634762654 |page=43 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Canaan-Land-Richard-Rossi/dp/B0875YZD9W/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr= |access-date=30 April 2020}}</ref>

==Vulnerability factors==
Confidence tricks exploit typical [[human nature|human characteristics]] such as [[Greed (emotion)|greed]], [[dishonesty]], [[vanity]], [[opportunism]], [[lust]], [[compassion]], [[credulity]], [[moral responsibility|irresponsibility]], [[panic|desperation]], and [[naïvety]]. As such, there is no consistent profile of a confidence trick victim; the common factor is simply that the victim relies on the good faith of the con artist. Victims of [[securities fraud|investment scams]] tend to show an incautious level of greed and gullibility, and many con artists target the elderly and other people thought to be vulnerable, using various forms of confidence tricks.<ref>[http://www.crimes-of-persuasion.com/Victims/victims.htm Crimes-of-persuasion.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415230029/http://www.crimes-of-persuasion.com/Victims/victims.htm |date=2007-04-15 }} ''Fraud Victim Advice / Assistance for Consumer Scams and Investment Frauds''</ref> Researchers Huang and Orbach argue:<ref name=Huang18/>
{{blockquote|Cons succeed for inducing judgment errors—chiefly, errors arising from [[Asymmetric information|imperfect information]] and [[cognitive bias]]es. In popular culture and among professional con men, the human vulnerabilities that cons exploit are depicted as 'dishonesty,' 'greed,' and 'gullibility' of the marks. Dishonesty, often represented by the expression 'you can't cheat an honest man,' refers to the willingness of marks to participate in unlawful acts, such as rigged gambling and embezzlement. Greed, the desire to 'get something for nothing,' is a shorthand expression of marks' beliefs that too-good-to-be-true gains are realistic. Gullibility reflects beliefs that marks are 'suckers' and 'fools' for entering into costly voluntary exchanges. Judicial opinions occasionally echo these sentiments.}}

Accomplices, also known as [[shill]]s, help manipulate the mark into accepting the perpetrator's plan. In a traditional confidence trick, the mark is led to believe that he will be able to win money or some other prize by doing some task. The accomplices may pretend to be strangers who have benefited from performing the task in the past.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}}
