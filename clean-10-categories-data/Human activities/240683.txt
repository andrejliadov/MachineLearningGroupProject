{{Short description|Type of provisional or temporary government}}
A '''caretaker government''' is a temporary ''[[ad hoc]]'' [[government]] that performs some governmental duties and functions in a country until a regular government is elected or formed.<ref>https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/caretaker-government</ref><ref>https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/caretaker-government</ref> Depending on specific practice, it usually consists of either randomly selected or approved [[member of parliament|members of parliament]] or outgoing members until their dismissal.

Caretaker governments in [[representative democracies]] are usually limited in their function, serving only to maintain the ''[[status quo]]'', rather than truly govern and propose new [[legislation]]. Unlike the government it is meant to temporarily replace, a caretaker government does not have a legitimate [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] (electoral approval) to exercise aforementioned functions.

== Definition ==
Caretaker governments may be put in place when a government in a [[parliamentary]] system is defeated in a [[motion of no confidence]], or in the case when the house to which the government is responsible is dissolved, to be in place for an interim period until an election is held and a new government is formed. In this sense, in some countries which use a [[Westminster system]] of government, the caretaker government is simply the incumbent government, which continues to operate in the interim period between the normal dissolution of parliament for the purpose of holding an election and the formation of a new government after the election results are known. Unlike in ordinary times, the caretaker government's activities are limited by custom and convention.

In systems where [[coalition government]]s are frequent a caretaker government may be installed temporarily while negotiations to form a new coalition take place. This usually occurs either immediately after an election in which there is no clear victor or if one coalition government collapses and a new one must be negotiated.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hasanuzzaman |first=Al Masud |year=2012 |chapter=Caretaker Government |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Caretaker_Government |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Caretaker governments are expected to handle daily issues and prepare budgets for discussion, but are not expected to produce a [[government platform]] or introduce controversial bills.

A caretaker government is often set up following a war until stable [[democracy|democratic]] rule can be restored, or installed, in which case it is often referred to as a [[provisional government]].

==Caretaker governments associated with elections==
Many countries are administered by a caretaker government during election periods, such as:
*[[Caretaker government of Australia]]
*[[Caretaker government of Bangladesh]]
*[[Demissionary cabinet]], a Dutch caretaker cabinet.
Other countries that use similar mechanisms include [[Pakistan]] and [[Elections in New Zealand|New Zealand]].

Heads of caretaker governments are often referred to as a "caretaker" head, for example "caretaker prime minister".

Similarly, but chiefly in the [[United States]], '''caretakers''' are individuals who fill seats in government temporarily without ambitions to continue to hold office on their own. This is particularly true with regard to [[United States Senate|United States senators]] who are appointed to office by the [[Governor (United States)|governor]] of their [[U.S. state|state]] following a vacancy created by the death or resignation of a sitting senator.  Sometimes governors wish to run for the seat themselves in the next election but do not want to be accused of unfairness by arranging their own appointments in the interim. Also, sometimes they do not wish to be seen as taking sides within a group of party factions or prejudicing of a [[primary election]] by picking someone who is apt to become an active candidate for the position. At one time, [[widow]]s of politicians were often selected as caretakers to succeed their late husbands; this custom is rarely exercised today, as it could be viewed by some as [[nepotism]].

In [[Canada]] and most other English-speaking countries, the more widely accepted term in this context is ''interim'', as in [[Interim leader (Canada)|interim leader]]. In Italy, this kind of premier is the President of [[Government of Experts]].
