'''Existential phenomenology''' encompasses a wide range of thinkers who take up the view that philosophy must begin from experience like phenomenology, but argues for the inability of philosophers to themselves exit existence in order to view the human condition universally. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|title=Being and Time|publisher=Harper|year=2008|isbn=978-0061575594|location=New York}}</ref>

==Overview==
In contrast with his former mentor [[Edmund Husserl]], Heidegger (in his ''[[Being and Time]]'') put [[ontology]] before [[epistemology]] and thought that phenomenology would have to be based on an observation and analysis of ''[[Dasein]]'' ("being-there"), human being, investigating the fundamental ontology of the ''Lebenswelt'' ([[lifeworld]], Husserl's term) underlying all so-called regional ontologies of the special sciences. In Heidegger's philosophy, people are thrown into the world in a given situation, but they are also a project towards the future, possibility, freedom, wait, hope, anguish.<ref>Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50–62.</ref> In contrast with the philosopher [[Kierkegaard]], Heidegger wanted to explore the problem of ''Dasein'' existentially (''{{lang|de|existenzial}}''), rather than [[existentiell]]y (''{{lang|de|existenziell}}'') because Heidegger argued Kierkegaard had already described the latter with "penetrating fashion".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Most existentialist phenomenologists were concerned with how we are constituted by our experiences and yet how we are also free in some respect to modify both ourselves and the greater world in which we live. 

In Heidegger's language that we are "[[Being and Time|thrown into the world]]" Jean-Paul Sartre's that "existence precedes essence."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm|title=Existentialism is a Humanism}}</ref> Both of these point out that who any individual is, is a matter of the social, historical, political, and economic situation into which he or she is born. This frees phenomenology from needing to find a universal ground to all experience, since it will always be partial and influenced by the philosopher's own situation. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] argued that the lesson of Husserl's reduction is that "[[Phenomenology of Perception|there is no complete reduction]]" because even phenomenologists cannot resist how they have been shaped by their history, culture, society, and language.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Merleau-Ponty|first=Maurice|title=Phenomenology of Perception|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0415834339|location=New York}}</ref> [[Simone de Beauvoir]] explored how greatly norms of gender shapes the very sense of self that women have, in distinction from men, in her work [[The Second Sex]]. [[Hannah Arendt]] discusses how totalitarian regimes in the 20th century presented entirely new regimes of terror that shaped how people understand political life in her work [[The Human Condition]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Arendt|first=Hannah|title=The Human Condition|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2018|isbn=978-0226586601}}</ref> [[Frantz Fanon]] explored the legacy of racism and colonialism on the psyches' of black men.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|title=Black Skin, White Masks|publisher=Grove Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0802143006}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|last=Fanon|first=Frantz|title=The Wretched of the Earth|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=978-0802141323}}</ref>However, they all in different ways also stressed the freedom which humans have to alter their experiences through rebellion, political action, writing, thinking, and being. If we are constituted by the human social world, then it is only humans that created it and can create a new world if they take up this task.

==Development==
Besides Heidegger, other existential phenomenologists were [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Enzo Paci|it}} and [[Samuel Todes]].

==Other disciplines==
Existential phenomenology extends also to other disciplines. For example, [[Leo Steinberg]]'s essay "[[The Philosophical Brothel]]" describes Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' in a perspective that is existential-phenomenological. It has also impacted [[architectural theory]], especially in the phenomenological and Heideggerian approaches to space, place, dwelling, technology, etc.<ref>This is evident in the works of [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], as for example is the case with his book: ''Genius Loci, Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture'' (New York: Rizzoli, 1980), or more recently with the numerous papers of [[Nader El-Bizri]] such as his paper: 'On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology', ''Studia UBB Philosophia'' Volume 60 (2015): 5–30. This is also felt with the practices of architects in the [[Phenomenology (architecture)]] movement</ref> In literary theory and criticism, [[Robert Magliola]]'s ''Phenomenology and Literature: An Introduction'' (Purdue UP, 1977; rpt. 1978) was the first book<ref>See review by W. Wolfgang Holdheim, ''Diacritics'', Vol. 9, No. 2 (summer, 1979): https://www.jstor.org/stable/464782.</ref> to explain to Anglophonic academics--systematically and comprehensively--the range of literary theories and practices identified with "phenomenological literary criticism" on the Continent. The practices of the francophonic [[Geneva School]] (-of literary criticism), those of the Swiss-German theorist and critic Emil Staiger, and those of several other theorists/critics, are explained in detail. The influences of the phenomenological theorist [[Roman Ingarden]], of the early-phase (existentialist-) [[Martin Heidegger]], and of [[Mikel Dufrenne]] receive a treatment over 100 pages long all-told. The polemics involving phenomenology and its opponents are addressed in separate chapters, entitled respectively "Phenomenology Confronts Parisian Structuralism," and "The Problem of Validity in [[E. D. Hirsch]] and [[Husserl]]. The 1978 rpt. of Magliola's book features on its back cover very strong endorsements from [[Robert Scholes]], [[Eugene Kaelin]], [[Monroe Beardsley]] and Ralph Freedman.
