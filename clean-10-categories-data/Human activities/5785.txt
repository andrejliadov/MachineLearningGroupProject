The notion that acts such as [[murder]], [[rape]], and [[theft]] are to be prohibited exists worldwide.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news |last=Easton |first=Mark |title=What is crime? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/06/what_is_crime.html |access-date=10 June 2013 |newspaper=BBC News |date=17 June 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227042428/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/markeaston/2010/06/what_is_crime.html |archive-date=27 February 2013 }}</ref> What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by [[criminal law]] of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the [[criminal code]], in some [[Common law (legal system)|common law]] countries no such comprehensive statute exists.

The state ([[Forms of government|government]]) has the power to severely restrict one's [[liberty]] for committing a crime. In [[Contemporary society|modern societies]], there are [[Criminal procedure|procedures]] to which investigations and [[trial]]s must adhere. If found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]], an offender may be [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] to a form of reparation such as a [[community sentence]], or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo [[imprisonment]], [[life imprisonment]] or, in some [[jurisdiction]]s, [[Capital punishment|execution]].

Usually, to be classified as a crime, the "act of doing something criminal" (''[[actus reus]]'') must{{snd}}with [[Strict liability|certain exceptions]]{{snd}}be accompanied by the "intention to do something criminal" (''[[mens rea]]'').<ref name="oxdic"/>

While every crime violates the law, not every [[violation of the law]] counts as a crime. Breaches of [[private law]] ([[tort]]s and [[breach of contract|breaches of contract]]) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through [[civil procedure]]. The world of crime and criminals is often called "the underworld."<ref>

== Overview ==

When informal relationships prove insufficient to establish and maintain a desired [[social order]], a government or a state may impose more formalized or stricter systems of [[social control]]. With institutional and legal machinery at their disposal, agents of the state can compel [[population]]s to conform to codes and can opt to punish or attempt to reform those who do not conform.

Authorities employ various mechanisms to regulate (encouraging or discouraging) certain behaviors in general. Governing or administering agencies may for example codify rules into laws, police citizens and visitors to ensure that they comply with those laws, and implement other policies and practices that legislators or administrators have prescribed with the aim of discouraging or [[crime prevention|preventing crime]]. In addition, authorities provide [[Legal remedy|remedies]] and [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], and collectively these constitute a [[criminal justice]] system. Legal sanctions vary widely in their severity; they may include (for example) incarceration of temporary character aimed at reforming the [[convict]]. Some jurisdictions have penal codes written to inflict permanent harsh punishments: legal [[mutilation]], [[capital punishment]], or [[life imprisonment|life without parole]].

Usually, a [[natural person]] perpetrates a crime, but [[legal personality|legal persons]] may also commit crimes. Historically, several premodern societies believed that non-human [[animal]]s were capable of committing crimes, and prosecuted and punished them accordingly.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Girgen|first1=Jen|title=The Historical and Contemporary Prosecution and Punishment of Animals|journal=Animal Law Journal|date=2003|volume=9|pages=97|url=https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/26566-9cgirgen|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref>

The sociologist [[Richard Quinney]] has written about the relationship between society and crime. When Quinney states "crime is a [[social phenomenon]]" he envisages both how individuals conceive crime and how populations perceive it, based on [[Social norm|societal norms]].<ref>Quinney, Richard, "Structural Characteristics, Population Areas, and Crime Rates in the United States," ''The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology and Police Science'', 57(1), pp. 45–52</ref>

== Etymology ==

The word ''crime'' is derived from the [[Latin]] root {{Lang-la|cernō|label=none}}, meaning "I decide, I give judgment". Originally the Latin word ''[[wiktionary:crimen#Latin|crīmen]]'' meant "[[criminal charge|charge]]" or "cry of distress."<ref>Ernest Klein, [https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Etymological-Dictionary-English-Language/dp/0444409300 ''Klein's Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322101740/http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Etymological-Dictionary-English-Language/dp/0444409300 |date=2016-03-22 }}</ref> The [[Ancient Greek]] word {{Lang-grc|κρίμα|label=none|translit=krima}}, from which the Latin [[cognate]] derives, typically referred to an intellectual mistake or an offense against the community, rather than a private or moral wrong.<ref>Bakaoukas, Michael. "The conceptualisation of 'Crime' in Classical Greek Antiquity: From the ancient Greek 'crime' (krima) as an intellectual error to the christian 'crime' (crimen) as a moral sin." ERCES ( European and International research group on crime, Social Philosophy and Ethics). 2005. {{cite web |url=http://www.erces.com/journal/articles/archives/volume2/v02/v02.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928085421/http://www.erces.com/journal/articles/archives/volume2/v02/v02.htm |archive-date=2011-09-28 }}</ref>

In 13th century [[English language|English]] ''crime'' meant "sinfulness", according to the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]. It was probably brought to England as Old French {{lang|fro|crimne}} (12th century form of [[French language|Modern French]] ''crime''), from Latin ''crimen'' (in the genitive case: ''criminis''). In Latin, ''crimen'' could have signified any one of the following: "[[Criminal charge|charge]], [[indictment]], [[Criminal accusation|accusation]]; crime, [[fault (legal)|fault]], offense".

The word may derive from the Latin ''cernere'' – "to decide, to sift" (see [[crisis]], mapped on [[Kairos]] and [[Chronos]]). But [[Ernest Klein]] (citing [[Karl Brugmann]]) rejects this and suggests *cri-men, which originally would have meant "cry of distress". Thomas G. Tucker suggests a root in "[[crying|cry]]" words and refers to English [[plaintiff|plaint]], [[plaintiff]], and so on. The meaning "offense punishable by law" dates from the late 14th century. The Latin word is [[Gloss (annotation)|glossed]] in Old English by ''facen'', also "deceit, fraud, treachery", [cf. fake]. ''Crime wave'' is first attested in 1893 in [[American English]].

== Definition ==

=== England and Wales ===

Whether a given act or [[Omission (law)|omission]] constitutes a crime does not depend on the nature of that act or omission; it depends on the nature of the legal consequences that may follow it.<ref>''Seaman v Burley'' [1896] 2 QB, per Lord Esher MR at 346</ref> An act or omission is a crime if it is capable of being followed by what are called [[criminal proceedings]].<ref name="Law, Eleventh Edition 1982, page 3">[[Glanville Williams]], ''Learning the Law'', Eleventh Edition, Stevens, 1982, p. 3</ref><ref>Chapter 1 of "Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law" (13th Ed by Ormerod) discusses the various proposed definitions of "crime" in more detail.</ref>

'''History'''

The following definition of ''crime'' was provided by the Prevention of Crimes Act 1871, and applied<ref>The [[Prevention of Crime Act 1908]], section 10(6) and Schedule</ref> for the purposes of section 10 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1908:

{{Blockquote|The expression "crime" means, in England and Ireland, any [[felony]] or the offence of [[uttering]] false or counterfeit coin, or of possessing counterfeit gold or silver coin, or the offence of obtaining goods or money by [[false pretences]], or the offence of [[conspiracy to defraud]], or any [[misdemeanour]] under the fifty-eighth section of the [[Larceny Act 1861|Larceny Act, 1861]].}}

=== Scotland ===

For the purpose of section 243 of the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]], a crime means an offence punishable on [[indictment]], or an offence punishable on [[summary conviction]], and for the commission of which the offender is liable under the [[statute]] making the offence punishable to be imprisoned either absolutely or at the discretion of the court as an alternative for some other punishment.<ref>The [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/52/section/243 section 243(2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111200051/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/52/section/243 |date=2012-01-11 }}</ref>

=== Sociology ===

A [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] [[definition]] views crime as [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] that violates prevailing [[norm (sociology)|norms]]{{spaced ndash}}[[culture|cultural]] standards prescribing how humans ought to behave normally. This approach considers the complex realities surrounding the concept of crime and seeks to understand how changing [[society|social]], [[politics|political]], [[psychology|psychological]], and [[economics|economic]] conditions may affect changing definitions of crime and the form of the legal, [[Police|law-enforcement]], and penal responses made by society.

These [[structuralism|structural]] realities remain fluid and often contentious. For example: as cultures change and the political environment shifts, societies may [[criminalisation|criminalise]] or [[decriminalisation|decriminalise]] certain behaviours, which directly affects the [[statistics|statistical]] [[crime rate]]s, influence the allocation of resources for the enforcement of laws, and (re-)influence the general [[public opinion]].

Similarly, changes in the collection and/or calculation of data on crime may affect the public perceptions of the extent of any given "crime problem". All such adjustments to [[crime statistics]], allied with the experience of people in their everyday lives, shape attitudes on the extent to which the state should use law or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] to enforce or encourage any particular [[social norm]]. Behaviour can be controlled and influenced by a society in many ways without having to resort to the criminal justice system.

Indeed, in those cases where no clear [[consensus]] exists on a given norm, the drafting of [[criminal law]] by the group in [[power (sociology)|power]] to prohibit the behaviour of another group may seem to some observers an improper limitation of the second group's [[Political freedom|freedom]], and the ordinary members of society have less respect for the law or laws in general{{snd}}whether the authorities actually enforce the disputed law or not.

=== Other definitions ===

[[Legislature]]s can pass laws (called [[Malum prohibitum|''mala prohibita'']]) that define crimes against social norms. These laws vary from time to time and from place to place: note variations in [[gambling]] laws, for example, and the prohibition or encouragement of [[duelling]] in history. Other crimes, called [[Malum in se|''mala in se'']], count as outlawed in almost all societies, ([[murder]], [[theft]] and [[rape]], for example).

[[English criminal law]] and the related criminal law of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries can define offences that the courts alone have developed over the years, without any actual legislation: [[common law offence]]s. The courts used the concept of ''[[malum in se]]'' to develop various common law offences.<ref>''Canadian Law Dictionary'', John A. Yogis, Q.C., Barrons: 2003
</ref>

== Criminalization ==
{{Main| Criminalization}}
[[File:Traitors heads on old london bridge.jpg|thumb|The spiked heads of executed criminals once adorned the gatehouse of the medieval [[London Bridge]].]]
One can view criminalization as a procedure deployed by society as a preemptive harm-reduction device, using the threat of punishment as a [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrent]] to anyone proposing to engage in the behavior causing harm. The state becomes involved because governing entities can become convinced that the costs of not criminalizing (through allowing the harms to continue unabated) outweigh the costs of criminalizing it (restricting individual liberty, for example, to minimize harm to others).{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

States control the process of criminalization because:
* Even if [[victimology|victims]] recognize their own role as victims, they may not have the resources to investigate and seek legal redress for the injuries suffered: the enforcers formally appointed by the state often have better access to expertise and resources.
* The victims may only want compensation for the injuries suffered, while remaining indifferent to a possible desire for [[deterrence (psychology)|deterrence]].<ref>See Polinsky & Shavell (1997) on the fundamental divergence between the private and the social motivation for using the legal system.</ref>
* Fear of [[retaliate|retaliation]] may deter victims or witnesses of crimes from taking any action. Even in policed societies, fear may inhibit from reporting incidents or from co-operating in a [[Trial (law)|trial]].
* Victims, on their own, may lack the economies of scale that could allow them to administer a penal system, let alone to collect any fines levied by a court.<ref>See Polinsky (1980) on the enforcement of fines</ref> Garoupa and Klerman (2002) warn that a [[rent-seeking]] government has as its primary motivation to maximize revenue and so, if offenders have sufficient wealth, a rent-seeking government will act more aggressively than a [[social welfare function|social-welfare]]-maximizing government in enforcing laws against minor crimes (usually with a fixed penalty such as parking and routine traffic violations), but more laxly in enforcing laws against major crimes.
* As a result of the crime, victims may die or become incapacitated.

== Labelling theory ==
{{further|Labeling theory#The "criminal"}}

The [[Labeling theory|label]] of "crime" and the accompanying [[social stigma]] normally confine their scope to those activities seen as injurious to the general population or to the state, including some that cause serious loss or damage to individuals. Those who apply the labels of "crime" or "criminal" intend to assert the [[hegemony]] of a dominant population, or to reflect a consensus of condemnation for the identified behavior and to justify any punishments prescribed by the state (in the event that [[due process|standard processing]] [[trial (law)|tries]] and [[conviction (law)|convicts]] an accused person of a crime).

== Natural-law theory ==

Justifying the state's use of [[coercion|force]] to coerce compliance with its laws has proven a consistent theoretical problem. One of the earliest justifications involved the theory of [[natural law]]. This posits that the nature of the world or of human beings underlies the standards of [[morality]] or constructs them. [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote in the 13th century: "the rule and measure of human acts is the [[reason]], which is the first principle of human acts".<ref>{{Cite book|title=On law, morality, and politics|last=Thomas, Aquinas, Saint, 1225?-1274.|date=2002|publisher=Hackett Pub|others=Regan, Richard J., Baumgarth, William P.|isbn=0872206637|edition= 2nd|location=Indianapolis|oclc=50423002}}</ref> He regarded people as by nature [[rationality|rational]] beings, concluding that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature. Thus, to be valid, any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable. In the 1760s, [[William Blackstone]] described the thesis:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Commentaries on the laws of England|last=Blackstone, William, 1723-1780.|date=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=William Blackstone Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=0226055361|location=Chicago|page=41|oclc=4832359}}</ref>

: "This law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original."

But [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin]] (1790–1859), an early [[Legal positivism|positivist]], applied [[utilitarianism]] in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence of an objective morality. He denied that the legal validity of a norm depends on whether its content conforms to morality. Thus in Austinian terms, a moral code can objectively determine what people ought to do, the law can embody whatever norms the legislature decrees to achieve social utility, but every individual remains free to choose what to do. Similarly, [[H. L. A. Hart|H.L.A. Hart]] saw the law as an aspect of [[sovereignty]], with lawmakers able to adopt any law as a means to a moral end.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The concept of law|last=Hart, H. L. A. (Herbert Lionel Adolphus), 1907-1992.|date=1994|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0198761228|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=31410701}}</ref>

Thus the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of a proposition of law simply involved internal [[logic]] and [[consistency]], and that the state's agents used state power with [[Social responsibility|responsibility]]. [[Ronald Dworkin]] rejects Hart's theory and proposes that all individuals should expect the equal respect and concern of those who govern them as a fundamental political right. He offers a theory of compliance overlaid by a theory of [[deference]] (the citizen's duty to obey the law) and a theory of enforcement, which identifies the legitimate goals of enforcement and punishment. Legislation must conform to a theory of legitimacy, which describes the circumstances under which a particular person or group is entitled to make law, and a theory of legislative justice, which describes the law they are entitled or obliged to make.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/takingrightsseri00dwor|title=Taking rights seriously : [with a new appendix, a response to critics]|last=Dworkin, Ronald.|date=1978|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674867114|location=Cambridge|oclc=4313351|url-access=registration}}</ref>

There are natural-law theorists who have accepted the idea of enforcing the prevailing morality as a primary function of the law.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-law-theories/|first=John|last=Finnis|department=3.2 Natural law & (purely) positive law as concurrent dimensions of legal reasoning|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|OUP]]|isbn=978-0199599141|title=Natural Law & Natural Rights|year=2015|access-date=2019-07-17|quote=The moral standards...which Dworkin (in line with natural law theory) treats as capable of being morally objective & true, thus function as a direct source of law and...as already law, except when their fit with the whole set of social-fact sources in the relevant community is so weak that it would be more accurate (according to Dworkin) to say that judges who apply them are applying morality not law.}}</ref> This view entails the problem that it makes any moral criticism of the law impossible: if conformity with natural law forms a necessary condition for legal validity, all valid law must, by definition, count as morally just. Thus, on this line of reasoning, the legal validity of a norm necessarily entails its moral justice.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bix|first=Brian H.|title=Kelsen, Hart, & legal normativity|date=August 2015|journal=Revus - OpenEdition Journals|doi=10.4000/revus.3984|volume=34|issue=34|department=3.3 Law and morality|quote=...it was part of the task of a legal theorist to explain the 'normativity' or 'authority' of law, by which they meant 'our sense that ‘legal’ norms provide agents with special reasons for acting, reasons they would not have if the norm were not a ‘legal’ one'...this may be a matter calling more for a psychological or sociological explanation, rather than a philosophical one.|doi-access=free}}</ref>

One can solve this problem by granting some degree of [[moral relativism]] and accepting that norms may evolve over time and, therefore, one can criticize the continued enforcement of old laws in the light of the current norms. People may find such law acceptable, but the use of state power to coerce citizens to comply with that law lacks moral justification. More recent conceptions of the theory characterise crime as the violation of [[individual and group rights|individual rights]].

Since society considers so many rights as natural (hence the term ''[[rights|right]]'') rather than man-made, what constitutes a crime also counts as natural, in contrast to laws (seen as man-made). [[Adam Smith]] illustrates this view, saying that a [[smuggling|smuggler]] would be an excellent citizen, "...had not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to be so."

Natural-law theory therefore distinguishes between "criminality" (which derives from human nature) and "illegality" (which originates with the interests of those in [[power (sociology)|power]]). Lawyers sometimes express the two concepts with the phrases ''[[malum in se]]'' and ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' respectively. They regard a "crime ''malum in se''" as inherently criminal; whereas a "crime ''malum prohibitum''" (the argument goes) counts as criminal only because the law has decreed it so.

It follows from this view that one can perform an illegal act without committing a crime, while a criminal act could be perfectly legal. Many [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers (such as Adam Smith and the American [[List of national founders|Founding Fathers]]) subscribed to this view to some extent, and it remains influential among so-called [[Liberalism#Classical and modern|classical liberals]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

== History ==
Some religious communities regard [[sin]] as a crime; some may even highlight the crime of sin very early in legendary or mythological accounts of origins{{snd}}note the tale of [[Adam and Eve]] and the theory of [[original sin]]. What one group considers a crime may cause or ignite war or conflict. However, the earliest known [[civilization]]s had codes of [[law]], containing both [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and penal rules mixed together, though not always in recorded form.

=== Ancient Near East ===
The [[Sumer]]ians produced the earliest surviving written codes.<ref>Oppenheim (1964)</ref> [[Urukagina]] (reigned {{Circa|2380 BC|2360 BC}}, [[short chronology timeline|short chronology]]) had an early code that has not survived; a later king, [[Ur-Nammu]], left the earliest extant written law system, the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] ({{c.|lk=no|2100|2050 BC}}), which prescribed a formal system of penalties for specific cases in 57 articles. The Sumerians later issued other codes, including the "code of [[Lipit-Ishtar]]". This code, from the 20th century BCE, contains some fifty articles, and scholars have reconstructed it by comparing several sources. {{quote|The Sumerian was deeply conscious of his personal rights and resented any encroachment on them, whether by his King, his superior, or his equal. No wonder that the Sumerians were the first to compile laws and law codes.| Kramer<ref>
Kramer (1971: 4)
</ref>}}

Successive legal codes in [[Babylon]], including the [[code of Hammurabi]] ({{c.|lk=no|1790 BC}}), reflected [[Mesopotamia]]n society's belief that law derived from the will of the [[deity|gods]] (see [[Babylonian law]]).<ref>

</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Babylonian laws|publisher=Wipf & Stock Pub|others=Driver, G. R. (Godfrey Rolles), 1892–1975; Miles, John C. (John Charles), Sir, 1870–1963|isbn=978-1556352294|location=Eugene, Oregon|oclc=320934300|date = April 2007}}</ref>
Many states at this time functioned as [[theocracy|theocracies]], with codes of conduct largely religious in origin or reference. In the Sanskrit texts of [[Dharmaśāstra]] ({{c.|lk=no|1250 BC}}), issues such as legal and religious duties, code of conduct, penalties and remedies, etc. have been discussed and forms one of the elaborate and earliest source of legal code.<ref>
Anuradha Jaiswal, ''Criminal Justice Tenets of Manusmriti – A Critique of the Ancient Hindu Code''
</ref><ref>Olivelle, Patrick. 2004. ''The Law Code of Manu''. New York: Oxford UP.</ref>

[[Sir Henry Maine]] studied the ancient codes available in his day, and failed to find any criminal law in the "modern" sense of the word.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancient law : its connection with the early history of society, and its relation to modern ideas|last=Maine, Henry Sumner, 1822–1888|year=1861|isbn=0816510067|location=Tucson|oclc=13358229}}</ref> While modern systems distinguish between offences against the "state" or "community", and offences against the "individual", the so-called penal law of ancient communities did not deal with "crimes" (Latin: ''crimina''), but with "wrongs" (Latin: ''delicta''). Thus the Hellenic laws treated all forms of [[theft]], [[assault]], [[rape]], and murder as private wrongs, and left action for enforcement up to the victims or their survivors. The earliest systems seem to have lacked formal courts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Early Greek law|last=Gagarin, Michael.|date=1986|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520909168|location=London|oclc=43477491}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Law & society in classical Athens|last=Garner, Richard, 1953-|date=1987|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=0312008562|location=New York|oclc=15365822}}</ref>

=== Rome and its legacy in Europe ===

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] systematized law and applied their system across the [[Roman Empire]]. Again, the initial rules of [[Roman law]] regarded assaults as a matter of private compensation. The most significant Roman law concept involved ''dominion''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Roman law: linguistic, social and philosophical aspects.|last=Daube, David.|date=1969|publisher=Edinburgh U.P|isbn=0852240511|location=Edinburgh|oclc=22054}}</ref> The ''[[pater familias]]'' owned all the family and its property (including slaves); the ''pater'' enforced matters involving interference with any property. The ''Commentaries'' of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] (written between 130 and 180 AD) on the [[Twelve Tables]] treated ''furtum'' (in modern parlance: "theft") as a [[tort]].

Similarly, assault and violent [[robbery]] involved [[trespass]] as to the ''pater's'' property (so, for example, the rape of a slave could become the subject of compensation to the ''pater'' as having trespassed on his "property"), and breach of such laws created a ''vinculum juris'' (an obligation of law) that only the payment of monetary compensation (modern "[[damages]]") could discharge. Similarly, the consolidated [[Germanic law|Teutonic laws]] of the [[Germanic tribes]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The principle of the personality of law in the Germanic kingdoms of western Europe from the fifth to the eleventh century|last=Guterman, Simeon L. (Simeon Leonard), 1907-|date=1990|publisher=P. Lang|isbn=0820407313|location=New York|oclc=17731409}}</ref> included a complex system of monetary compensations for what courts would {{As of| 2008 | alt = now}} consider the complete{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} range of criminal offences against the person, from murder down.

Even though Rome abandoned its [[Roman Britain|Britannic provinces]] around 400 AD, the Germanic mercenaries{{spaced ndash}}who had largely become instrumental in enforcing Roman rule in Britannia{{spaced ndash}}acquired ownership of land there and continued to use a mixture of Roman and Teutonic Law, with much written down under the early [[Anglo-Saxon kings]].<ref>Attenborough: 1963</ref> But only when a more centralized English monarchy emerged following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]], and when the kings of England attempted to assert power over the land and its peoples, did the modern concept emerge, namely of a crime not only as an offence against the "individual", but also as a wrong against the "state".<ref>
Kern: 1948; Blythe: 1992; and Pennington: 1993
</ref>

This idea came from [[common law]], and the earliest conception of a criminal act involved events of such major significance that the "state" had to usurp the usual functions of the civil tribunals, and direct a special law or ''privilegium'' against the perpetrator. All the earliest English criminal trials involved wholly extraordinary and arbitrary courts without any settled law to apply, whereas the civil (delictual) law operated in a highly developed and consistent manner (except where a king wanted to raise money by selling a new form of [[writ]]). The development of the idea that the "state" dispenses [[justice]] in a court only emerges in parallel with or after the emergence of the concept of [[sovereignty]].

In continental Europe, Roman law persisted, but with a stronger influence from the Christian Church.<ref>Vinogradoff (1909); Tierney: 1964, 1979
</ref>
Coupled with the more diffuse political structure based on smaller feudal units, various legal traditions emerged, remaining more strongly rooted in Roman [[jurisprudence]], but modified to meet the prevailing [[political climate]].

In Scandinavia the effect of Roman law did not become apparent until the 17th century, and the courts grew out of the ''[[thing (assembly)|things]]''{{snd}}the assemblies of the people. The people decided the cases (usually with largest freeholders dominating). This system later gradually developed into a system with a royal judge nominating a number of the most esteemed men of the parish as his board, fulfilling the function of "the people" of yore.

From the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] system onwards, the policy rationale for requiring the payment of monetary compensation for wrongs committed has involved the avoidance of [[feud]]ing between [[clan]]s and [[family|families]].<ref>
The concept of the ''pater familias'' acted as a unifying factor in extended kin groups, and the later practice of ''[[weregild|wergild]]'' functioned in this context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
</ref>
If compensation could mollify families' feelings, this would help to keep the peace. On the other hand, the institution of oaths also played down the threat of [[endemic warfare|feudal warfare]]. Both in archaic Greece and in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Scandinavia]], an accused person walked free if he could get a sufficient number of male relatives to swear him not guilty. (Compare the [[United Nations Security Council]], in which the [[veto]] power of the permanent members ensures that the organization does not become involved in crises where it could not enforce its decisions.)

These means of restraining private [[feud]]s did not always work, and sometimes prevented the fulfillment of justice. But in the earliest times the "state" did not always provide an independent policing force. Thus criminal law grew out of what 21st-century lawyers would call torts; and, in real terms, many acts and omissions classified as crimes actually overlap with civil-law concepts.

The development of [[sociology|sociological]] thought from the 19th century onwards prompted some fresh views on crime and criminality, and fostered the beginnings of [[criminology]] as a study of crime in society. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] noted a link between crime and [[creativity]]{{spaced ndash}}in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' he asserted<!-- in what context? -->:{{Context inline|date=November 2016}} "The best and brightest that man can acquire he must obtain by crime". In the 20th century, [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' made a study of [[criminalization]] as a coercive method of state control.

== Classification and categorisation ==

=== Categorisation by type ===

The following classes of offences are used, or have been used, as legal terms:
* [[Offence against the person]]<ref name="ReferenceA">For example, by the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]]</ref>
* [[Violent crime|Violent offence]]<ref name="ReferenceB">For example, by section 31(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]], and by the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]]</ref>
* [[Sex and the law|Sexual offence]]<ref name="ReferenceB"/>
* [[Property crime|Offence against property]]<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Researchers and commentators have classified crimes into the following categories, in addition to those above:
* [[Forgery]], [[personation]] and [[cheating (law)|cheating]]<ref>E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 22</ref>
* Firearms and offensive weapons<ref>E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 24</ref>
* Offences against the state/offences against the Crown and Government,<ref>E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 25</ref> or political offences<ref>E.g. ''[[Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law]]'', 12th ed, 1992, chapter 17</ref>
* [[Drug-related crime|Harmful or dangerous drugs]]<ref>E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 26</ref>
* Offences against [[religion]] and public worship<ref>E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 27</ref>
* Offences against public justice,<ref>E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 28</ref> or offences against the administration of public justice<ref>E.g. ''[[Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law]]'', 12th ed, 1992, chapter 16</ref>
* [[Public-order crime|Public order offence]]<ref>E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 29</ref>
* [[Corporate crime|Commerce]], [[financial market]]s and [[insolvency]]<ref>E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 30</ref>
* Offences against [[public morality|public morals]] and [[public policy]]<ref>E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 31</ref>
* [[Traffic code|Motor vehicle offences]]<ref>E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 32</ref>
* [[Conspiracy (criminal)|Conspiracy]], [[incitement]] and [[attempt]] to commit crime<ref>E.g. ''[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]]'', 1999, chapter 33</ref>
* [[Inchoate offense|Inchoate offence]]
* [[Juvenile delinquency]]
* [[Victimless crime]]

=== Categorisation by penalty ===

One can categorise crimes depending on the related punishment, with [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] [[tariff]]s prescribed in line with the perceived seriousness of the offence. Thus [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] and noncustodial sentences may address the crimes seen as least serious, with lengthy imprisonment or (in some jurisdictions) [[capital punishment]] reserved for the most serious.

=== Common law ===

Under the common law of England, crimes were classified as either [[treason]], [[felony]] or [[misdemeanour]], with treason sometimes being included with the felonies. This system was based on the perceived seriousness of the offence. It is still used in the United States but the distinction between felony and misdemeanour is abolished in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

=== Classification by mode of trial ===

The following classes of offence are based on [[mode of trial]]:
* [[Indictable-only offence]]
* [[Indictable offence]]
* [[Hybrid offence]], a.k.a. either-way offence in England and Wales
* [[Summary offence]], a.k.a. [[summary offence|infraction]] in the US

=== Classification by origin ===

In common law countries, crimes may be categorised into [[common law offences]] and [[statutory]] offences. In the US, Australia and Canada (in particular), they are divided into [[federal crime]]s and under state crimes.

=== Other classifications ===
* [[Arrestable offence]]

=== U.S. classification ===
[[File:Felony Sentences in State Courts.pdf|thumb|''Felony Sentences in State Courts'', study by the [[United States Department of Justice]].]]
In the United States since 1930, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has tabulated [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR) annually from crime data submitted by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] agencies across the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm |title=FBI: Uniform Crime Reports |publisher=Fbi.gov |access-date=2013-02-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024015252/https://www.fbi.gov//ucr/ucr.htm |archive-date=2004-10-24 }}</ref>
Officials compile this data at the city, county, and [[U.S. state|state]] levels into the UCR. They classify violations of laws based on [[common law]] as Part I (index) crimes in UCR data. These are further categorized as violent or property crimes. Part I violent crimes include murder and criminal homicide (voluntary manslaughter), forcible rape, aggravated assault, and robbery; while Part I property crimes include burglary, arson, larceny/theft, and motor-vehicle theft. All other crimes count come under Part II.

For convenience, such lists usually include [[summary offense|infractions]] although, in the U.S., they may come into the sphere not of the criminal law, but rather of the [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]]. Compare [[tort]]feasance.

Booking [[arrest]]s require detention for a time-frame ranging 1 to 24 hours.

==Reports, studies and organizations==
There are several national and International organizations offering studies and statistics about global and local crime activity, such as [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], the United States of America Overseas Security Advisory Council ([[OSAC]]) safety report or national reports generated by the law-enforcement authorities of EU state member reported to the [[Europol]].

== Offence in common law jurisdictions ==

In England and Wales, as well as in Hong Kong, the term ''offence'' means the same thing as, and is interchangeable with, the term ''[[#England and Wales|crime]]'',<ref name="Law, Eleventh Edition 1982, page 3"/> They are further split into:
* [[Summary offence]]s
* [[Indictable offence]]s

== Causes and correlates of crime ==
{{main|Causes and correlates of crime}}

Many different [[correlates of crime|causes and correlates of crime]] have been proposed with varying degree of empirical support. They include socioeconomic, psychological, biological, and behavioral factors. Controversial topics include [[media violence research]] and effects of [[gun politics]].

Emotional state (both chronic and current) have a tremendous impact on individual thought processes and, as a result, can be linked to criminal activities. The positive psychology concept of Broaden and Build posits that cognitive functioning expands when an individual is in a good-feeling emotional state and contracts as emotional state declines.<ref>Fredrickson, B.L. (2005). Positive Emotions broaden the scope of attention and though-action repertoires. Cognition and Emotion, 19: 313–332.</ref> In positive emotional states an individual is able to consider more possible solutions to problems, but in lower emotional states fewer solutions can be ascertained. The narrowed thought-action repertoires can result in the only paths perceptible to an individual being ones they would never use if they saw an alternative, but if they can't conceive of the alternatives that carry less risk they will choose one that they can see. Criminals who commit even the most horrendous of crimes, such as mass murders, did not see another solution.<ref>Baumeister, R.F. (2012). Human Evil: The myth of pure evil and the true causes of violence. In A.P. Association, M. Mikulincer, & P.R. Shaver (Eds.), The social psychology of morality: Exploring the causes of good and evil (pp. 367–380). Washington, DC</ref>

== Crimes in international law ==
{{Main|International criminal law}}
[[File:Kang Kek Iew (Kaing Guek Eav or Duch) before the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia - 20090720.jpg|thumb|[[Kang Kek Iew]] before the [[Cambodian Genocide Tribunal]] on July 20, 2009]]
Crimes defined by [[treaty]] as crimes against international law include:
* [[Crime against peace|Crimes against peace]]
* [[Crime of apartheid|Crimes of apartheid]]
* [[Forced disappearance]]
* [[Genocide]]
*[[Incitement to genocide]]
* [[Piracy]]
* [[Sexual slavery]]
* [[Slavery]]
* Waging a [[war of aggression]]
* [[War crime]]s

From the point of view of state-centric law, extraordinary procedures ([[international court]]s or national courts operating with [[universal jurisdiction]]) may prosecute such crimes. Note the role of the [[International Criminal Court]] at [[The Hague]] in the [[Netherlands]].{{cn|date=May 2020}}

== Religion and crime ==
{{main|Religious law}}
{{category see also|Crimes in religion}}
[[File:Hep-hep riots.jpg|thumb|alt= Two peasant women are assaulting a Jewish man with pitchfork and broom. A man wearing spectacles, tails, and a six-button waistcoat, perhaps a pharmacist or a schoolteacher, holds another Jewish man by the throat and is about to hit him with a stick, while a woman in a window above him throws the wet and solid contents of a basin at him, possibly the contents of a chamberpot. More chaos can be seen in the background, including a man with a raised sword and riding a horse towards the foreground.|[[Religious]] sentiment often becomes a contributory factor of crime. In the 1819 anti-Jewish riots in Frankfurt, rioters attacked Jewish businesses and destroyed property.]]

Different religious traditions may promote distinct norms of behaviour, and these in turn may clash or harmonise with the perceived interests of a state. Socially accepted or imposed religious morality has influenced secular jurisdictions on issues that may otherwise concern only an individual's conscience. Activities sometimes criminalized on religious grounds include (for example) [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption ([[prohibition]]), [[abortion]] and [[stem cell|stem-cell]] research. In various historical and present-day societies, institutionalized religions have established systems of earthly justice that punish crimes against the divine will and against specific devotional, organizational and other rules under specific codes, such as Roman Catholic [[canon law]].

== Military jurisdictions and states of emergency ==

In the [[military]] sphere, authorities can prosecute both regular crimes and specific acts (such as [[mutiny]] or [[desertion]]) under [[martial law|martial-law]] codes that either supplant or extend civil codes in times of (for example) war.

Many constitutions contain provisions to curtail freedoms and criminalize otherwise tolerated behaviors under a [[state of emergency]] in the event of war, natural disaster or civil unrest. Undesired activities at such times may include [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]] in the streets, violation of [[curfew]], or [[Gun politics|possession of firearms]].

== Employee crime ==
{{Main| Occupational crime}}

Two common types of [[employment|employee]] crime exist: [[embezzlement]] and [[wage theft]].

The complexity and anonymity of computer systems may help criminal employees camouflage their operations. The victims of the most costly [[confidence trick|scams]] include banks, brokerage houses, insurance companies, and other large financial institutions.<ref name="Computing1">
