==Early history==
[[File:DelawareCountryUGRR.png|thumb|200px|right|The River-to-Lake-Freedom Trail used for transporting slaves generally follows the present-day alignment of U.S. Route 23.]]

On August 5, 1846, the university's first president, [[Edward Thomson]], delivered his [[inauguration|inaugural address]]. He maintained that the college was a product of the [[classical liberalism|liberality]] of the people of [[Delaware, Ohio|Delaware]], and it was fortunate that Ohio Wesleyan was founded in a community divided in religious and political opinions; Thomson believed that the friction of a mixed society prevented [[dogma]]tism and developed energy. The spirit of the college, he said, is the spirit of liberty.<ref name="Hubbart22">Hubbart, p. 22</ref>

Thomson stated in the early days of Wesleyan that a college education should be a barrier to avarice by furnishing "the understanding, the taste, and the perspective that directs us to life's higher purposes ... It would serve political tranquillity, both by accrediting the truly apt candidates for office and by creating citizenry astutely able to assert its liberty against any government's tendency to encroach".<ref>Burtchaell, p. 300</ref>

Thomson was frequently vocal in the national political debates of his time, notably [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[Manifest Destiny|expansion]] of the United States.<ref name="1850issues">{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=231791077249253|title=Roots of Secession: Slavery and Politics in Antebellum Virginia|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|accessdate=2005-10-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413133931/http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=231791077249253|archive-date=2005-04-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1857 he denounced the argument that [[Southern United States|southern]] [[Christianity|Christians]]

[[Elizabeth Boynton Harbert]] (class of 1864), a [[women's suffrage]] activist, published several books on [[feminism|women's issues]] and suffrage, ''Out of Her Sphere'' and ''The Woman's Kingdom'', and was the chief editor of a women's suffrage newspaper, ''The New Era'', in 1885<ref>Rakow, Lana (1990).

==Early 20th century: the effect of wars and politics==

<!--commenting this out as the image is redlinked [[Image:RobinsonRickey.jpg|thumb|200px|right|On October 23, 1945, [[Branch Rickey]], an OWU grad, officially signed a contract with [[Jackie Robinson]] for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].]]-->

[[Branch Rickey]], a 1903 graduate of Ohio Wesleyan, is regarded as a significant figure in the history of professional [[baseball]] for breaking the sport's [[baseball color line|racial barrier]].<ref name="racialbarrier">{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/sports/special/barriers/rickey.html |title=Rickey's moral conviction to social progress was mightier than dollar |work=Houston Chronicle |accessdate=2006-12-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524170110/http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/sports/special/barriers/rickey.html |archivedate=May 24, 2006 }}</ref> An racial incident early in Rickey's life when he was as a baseball coach for Ohio Wesleyan in 1910 would play an important role in his decision thirty years later. Rickey's team visited a hotel in South Bend, Indiana, where the hotel manager refused to provide a room for Rickey's black baseball player Charley Thomas. Rickey eventually convinced the manager to allow him to share his own room with Thomas. Rickey recalled Thomas rubbing at his hands, ashamed of the color of his skin and vowed, "Charley, the day will come when they won't have to be white."<ref name="rickeyearlyOWU">{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/resources/lessonplans/hs_in_robinson_rickey.htm |title=Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson: Interview Essa |publisher=Jim Crow Gateway |accessdate=2007-02-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228095035/http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/resources/lessonplans/hs_in_robinson_rickey.htm |archivedate=2007-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1943 Rickey became president and [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].<ref name="racialbarrier2">{{cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/rickeybranch.shtml |title=Rickey, "Branch" (Wesley Branch) |publisher=Baseball Hall of Fame |accessdate=2006-12-07 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061030034113/http://www.hickoksports.com/biograph/rickeybranch.shtml |archivedate=2006-10-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Beginning with the 1946 signing of African American player [[Jackie Robinson]] for the Dodgers, Rickey became renowned for his role in the racial integration of the game.

In the [[World War I|war years]] of 1917–1919, the break between the United States and [[German Empire|Germany]] struck a military tone on campus. Individual students were volunteering in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], in the [[Canadian Forces]], and other forms of service.<ref>Hubbart, pp. 133–135</ref> As America entered World War I the [[United States Department of War|U.S. War Department]] inaugurated the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|Students' Army Training Corps]], a program designed to use existing colleges and universities as training facilities for new military personnel. On the morning of October 1, 1918, about 150,000 college boys on US campuses transformed into student soldiers. This was the induction into the Students' Army Training Corps. In Delaware, on campus, approximately 400 students were given the [[oath of allegiance]].<ref>Hubbart, p. 135</ref> The men received the regular army training and academic instruction prescribed by the Committee on Education and Special Training of the War Department. The mode of student activities changed: campus traditions were put aside, and athletic events were cancelled throughout the fall semester of 1918.<ref>Hubbart, p. 136</ref>

==Campus climate in the swinging sixties==
In 1966, students established an [[Upward Bound]] program, funded by the [[Economic Opportunity Act]] of 1964, to help prepare students from lower-income and poverty areas for college.<ref name="upwardbound">{{cite web |url=http://upward.owu.edu/ |title=Upward Bound Program |publisher=Upward Bound Office |accessdate=2005-01-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211191609/http://upward.owu.edu/ |archivedate=2004-12-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Arts Castle, the Early Childhood Center, the Big Pal/Little Pal Program, the Andrews House, the Office of Community Service, and the International Ambassador High School Program are among the many programs founded since the 1970s to provide services to the larger community in Delaware.

Elden Smith, Wesleyan's 11th president, appointed a commission in 1968 to study student life and to refine and further edit Wesleyan's previously too-broad Statement of Aims.<ref name="Burtchaell311">Burtchaell, p. 311</ref> The commission's report recommended four criteria that OWU's educators should foster: perception, critical judgement, enjoyment, and active responsibility for the problems of society.<ref name="Burtchaell311" /> On "active responsibility for the problems of society", the report stated, "A socially concerned individual who had no capacity for enjoyment, who exercised glib and trite rather than critical judgement, and who had no perception of reality, would be a public menace. Perhaps this is the meaning of 'do-gooder'. On the other hand, the absence of active responsibility for social problems might degenerate into obsession with self, and that perception might become dilettantism."<ref name="Burtchaell311" />

In 1969, the Commission on Student Life drafted a new form of student life.<ref name="Murchland74">Murchland, p. 74.</ref> It formed the Wesleyan Council of Student Affairs (WCSA) with the right to decide basic policies on matters related to student life.<ref name="Murchland74" /> The group was controversial from the start: more than two hundred students held a sit-in at the student union to gain faculty approval for issues-oriented representation.<ref name="Murchland74" /> WCSA became involved in the first major controversy on the Wesleyan campus in the 1960s: its representatives called for the elimination of academic credit and existence for [[ROTC]] and demanded access to the University's budget and general financial statements.<ref name="Murchland74" />

==Vietnam War and Wenzlau controversy==
The escalation of the [[Vietnam War]] in the early 1960s had a significant impact on Ohio Wesleyan students. A small minority had been concerned with the war for several years, but the bombing of [[North Vietnam]] and the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]] in August 1964 raised campus-wide awareness almost overnight.<ref>Murchland, p. 69.</ref> The Vietnam War, so distant, became a huge presence on campus, affected ideas of community, student power, and free speech, and influenced daily decisions like class choices and social interactions. The first stirrings of [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|protest against the war]] occurred in late 1964. In December, the Wesleyan Council of Student Affairs voted to send a letter to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] opposing the expansion of the war and advocating withdrawal. Opposing expansion was a fairly moderate position, but calling for withdrawal was much more radical.<ref>Murchland, pp. 69–77.</ref>

Wesleyan was the first college campus in the country to demonstrate against President [[Richard Nixon]]'s decision to invade [[Cambodia]] on April 30, 1970.<ref name="Murchland77">Murchland, p. 77</ref> Following the demonstration, two hundred students occupied the Air Force [[ROTC]] building on campus to protest both the war and the awarding of academic credit for ROTC participation.<ref name="Murchland77" /> The ROTC was seen as an extension of the "Pentagon's war machine."<ref name="Murchland77" />

President Wenzlau, then the president of OWU, attempted to disperse the protesters but was shouted down.<ref name="Murchland77" /> The students demanded that the school hold a campus referendum on the issue of ROTC campus disbandment and that the vote be binding on university policy.<ref name="Murchland77" />

Wenzlau called for an emergency faculty meeting on May 1, 1970.<ref name="Murchland77" /> The faculty body, surrounded by more than 300 students, decided to hold a faculty meeting later in the month when the entire faculty body would be present. The faculty meeting authorized sending a telegram to Nixon demanding an immediate unilateral cease-fire for all US troops in [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], and [[Vietnam]].<ref name="Murchland77" />

The student referendum was held on May 22, 1970. The student body was split on the issue of ROTC, while 67 percent voted to censure the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Murchland, p. 78</ref>

==Involvement in college affairs in the 1970s==
OWU students continued to demand more say in university affairs, in addition to making a strong stand on national issues.<ref name="Murchland79">Murchland, p. 79</ref> The Wesleyan Council for Student Affairs and the administration battled over appropriate wording for alcohol and visitation policies. Several hundred students staged a "drink-in" at the MUB (the student union) in 1971.<ref name="Murchland79" /> In the spring of 1971, students set up a tent community called "The People's Park" in front of Sturges Hall to protest housing policies.<ref name="Murchland79" /> Students became involved in decisions on several faculty tenure denials, the academic schedule, and plans for a new gymnasium. Starting in 1970, the Board of Trustees approved a student seat on its board, which was to be filled every three years.<ref name="Murchland79" />

==On racial equality again==
Mary King, class of 1963, worked alongside the Reverend Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in the U.S. [[civil rights movement]] when she was a young student, and was a member of the staff of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC).<ref name="maryking">{{cite web |url=http://news.owu.edu/2004/mlk.html|title=Mary King |publisher=Ohio Wesleyan University |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref>

The resurgence of campus activism regarding racism existing elsewhere in the world came in response to David Warren's, the 13th president, involvement in the issue.<ref name="Burtch312">Burtchaell, p. 312</ref> In his inauguration Warren stated: "If there is one phrase which I believe best characterizes our Wesleyan education, it is: 'Here I stand.' Within these three words of Martin Luther—'Here I stand'—is compressed the whole of our historical endeavor..."<ref name="Burtch312">Burtchaell, p. 312</ref>

In the 1980s the most organized campus movement was against investments in companies doing business in South Africa.<ref name="Murchland88">Murchland, p. 88</ref> By February 1987, student political action had brought Ohio Wesleyan to pledge to fully [[divestment|divest]] any holdings connected to South Africa.<ref>Tony Vellela(1988). ''New Voices: Student Political Activism in the '80s and '90s''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: South End Press. pp. 20-21, {{ISBN|0-89608-341-1}}.</ref> The OWU Committee on Divestment was organized in 1988 and funded many activities related to its cause. It sponsored an Anti-Apartheid Week, candlelight vigils, and protest marches. One event which drew a lot of media attention was the 1988 demonstration before the Board of Trustees.<ref name="Murchland88" /> Students carried a black and white paper chain as they climbed up the student union ballroom. As their leader announced "Divest!", students broke the symbolic paper chain.
