'''Looking''' is the act of intentionally focusing [[visual perception]] on someone or something, for the purpose of obtaining [[information]], and possibly to convey [[Interest (emotion)|interest]] or another sentiment.  A large number of [[Troponymy|troponyms]] exist to describe variations of looking at things, with prominent examples including the verbs "stare, gaze, gape, gawp, gawk, goggle, glare, glimpse, glance, peek, peep, peer, squint, leer, gloat, and ogle".<ref name="Higueras">Anne Poch Higueras and Isabel Verdaguer Clavera, "The rise of new meanings: A historical journey through English ways of ''looking at''", in Javier E. Díaz Vera, ed., ''A Changing World of Words: Studies in English Historical Lexicography, Lexicology and Semantics'', Volume 141 (2002), p. 563-572.</ref> Additional terms with nuanced meanings include viewing,<ref name="Caviness">[[Madeline H.

Smith"/> and scanning.<ref name="C.J. Smith"/> Looking is both a physical act of directing the focus of the [[eyes]], and a psychological act of interpreting what is seen and choosing whether to continue looking at it, or to look elsewhere. Where more than one person is involved, looking may lead to [[eye contact]] between those doing the looking, which raises further implications for the relationship established through that act.

==Looking versus seeing==
"Looking" and "seeing" are traditionally contrasted in a number of ways, although their usage often overlaps. Looking can be characterized as "the action precedent to seeing".<ref name="C.J. Smith"/> Any kind of looking or viewing actually implies "seeing" certain things within the range of view, while not "seeing" others, because they are unimportant at the moment. Thus, things that are within the range of view, but which are unimportant to the viewer, may be treated by the brain as if they are transparent, by being looked over, past, and around.<ref>Mark Changizi, ''The Vision Revolution: How the Latest Research Overturns Everything We Thought We Knew About Human Vision'' (2010), p. 75.</ref> The distinction between "looking" and "seeing" has been compared to the distinction between [[hearing]] and [[listening]], with one being a rote activity and the other requiring a conscious and thoughtful effort to understand what is being seen or heard.<ref>Jonathan Rée, ''I See a Voice: Deafness, Language and the Senses--A Philosophical History'' (1999). p. 52.</ref><ref name="Guerin">Frances Guerin, ''On Not Looking: The Paradox of Contemporary Visual Culture'' (2015), p. 35.</ref> Because of the breadth and flexibility of both words, different authors may reverse the relationship in contrasting them, with one suggesting that a person can "look at" something without truly "seeing" it, while another might suggest that a person might be "seeing" something, but not truly "look at" it.<ref>''See, e.g.'', Damian Hine, David Carson, ''Innovative Methodologies in Enterprise Research'' (2007), p. 19: "'''Looking but not seeing'''; hearing but not listening; speaking but not communicating; touching but not feeling; smelling but not detecting. In many ways our senses play tricks on us".</ref><ref>Frances Guerin, ''On Not Looking: The Paradox of Contemporary Visual Culture'' (2015), p. 35: "[James] Elkins bemoans the tendency to not look, to '''look without seeing''', and in its place proposes ways of looking".</ref><ref>R. G. Gordon, ''Personality'' (2005), p. 277: "Apart from the actual presence of the sensation, perception is markedly deficient or totally absent, the idiot '''sees but does not look''', hears but does not listen, and feels touch and pain but does not refer them in space and time".</ref><ref>Evan Marshall, ''Eye Language: Understanding the Eloquent Eye'' (1983), p. 82: "In simple terms, the schizophrenic '''sees but does not look''' — contrary to the popular belief that schizophrenics do not see their surroundings".</ref> Both arrangements suggest that the person is directing their vision towards the thing, but failing to give sufficient attention to notice specific characteristics or implications of what is in the visual field.

==Looking in intense, pronounced, or prolonged ways==
{{main|Staring|Gaze|Observation}}
A number of troponyms exist to illustrate kinds of looking that are either intentionally or unconsciously done in intense, pronounced, or prolonged ways.

"[[Staring]]" is an intense form of looking in which the eyes of the person looking remain fixed on the subject for an extended period, and is generally considered rude.<ref name="Higueras"/> "[[Gaze|Gazing]]" has historically implied intensity, but not aggressiveness, and may imply "wonder, fascination, awe, or admiration".<ref name="DeVinne">Pamela B. DeVinne, ''The Right Word III: A Concise Thesaurus'' (1990), p. 88.</ref> In the twentieth century, however, sociologists began to use the term to suggest a power relationship between the person who is gazing and the subject of the gaze, with the former exercising an ability to define the latter.<ref name="Caviness"/> By contrast, [[glaring]] does suggest aggressiveness and confrontation.<ref>Emil Coccaro, ''Aggression: Psychiatric Assessment and Treatment'' (2003), p. 98.</ref> "Eyeing" implies looking at something with some feeling involved, such as desire or wariness.<ref name="C.J. Smith"/>

"[[Observation|Observing]]" implies looking at a specific object or area for a prolonged period specifically for purposes of [[observation]], with the purpose of looking specifically being to obtain [[information]] about the thing being observed without necessarily either judging it or interfering with it.<ref name="Clement"/> "Watching" implies a similar prolonged focus, but can also imply looking at something in a distracted or absentminded manner, such as watching television.<ref name="Mowitt"/>

"Gaping" and "gawking" also indicate prolonged acts of looking, but suggest that the person doing the looking is so mentally distracted by the subject being observed that they become unaware of their own conduct. At the extreme, [[rubbernecking]] is the physical act of craning one's neck, performed in order to get a better view,<ref>{{cite book | editor-first = Rosalind | editor-last = Fergusson | first1 = Eric | last1 = Partridge | first2 = Paul | last2 = Beale | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hvxk4FiaATwC&pg=PA178&dq=rubbernecking&lr= | title = Shorter Slang Dictionary | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-415-08866-4 | page = 178}}</ref> and has been described as a human trait that is associated with morbid [[curiosity]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Daniel P. | last = Franklin | title = Politics and Film: The Political Culture of Film in the United States | publisher = Rowman & Littlefield Publishers | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7425-3808-5 | page = 96}}</ref> "Ogling" is an "impertinent" form of staring "often in a way that indicates improper interest".<ref name="DeVinne"/>

==Looking in quick, subtle, or hidden ways==
A number of troponyms exist to illustrate kinds of looking that are either intentionally or unconsciously done in a quick, subtle, or hidden way.

"Glancing" and "glimpsing" are terms that imply looking at things in a subtle way, or seeing things very briefly before they move out of the range of vision. Although the two are often confused, a glance is more commonly a quick movement of the eye, whereas a glimpse is more often a result of the object being watched quickly moving out of sight.<ref name="Steinmetz">Sol Steinmetz, ''Semantic Antics: How and Why Words Change Meaning'' (2009), p. 84-85.</ref> "Scanning" suggests quickly looking over an area "to get a general impression", accomplished "by rapidly noting one point after another".<ref name="C.J. Smith"/> ''Glance'' appeared as a word prior to 1450, from [[Old French]] ''glacer'' or ''glacier'', a reference to the quick movement of slipping on [[ice]], and was first recorded as appearing with its current meaning in 1582.<ref name="Steinmetz"/> ''Glimpse'' appeared as a noun with its current meaning in 1580, from [[Middle English]] ''glimsen'', and as a verb in 1779, although it was originally associated with seeing bright or shiny things.<ref name="Steinmetz"/> Playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]] was fond of using ''glance'' as a [[stage direction]].<ref name="Steinmetz"/>

"Peeking" and "peeping" suggest looking at something that one is not supposed to be looking at, and doing so in a way that is intended to hide the fact that the person doing the peeking or peeping is looking. There is "an illegitimacy associated with peeping".<ref name="Strong">Tracy B. Strong, "On Religion and the Strangeness of Speech", in Corey McCall, Tom Nurmi, ''Melville among the Philosophers'' (2017), p. 110.</ref> An aspect of the story of [[Lady Godiva]] is [[Peeping Tom]] — a tailor who spied on Godiva as she rode naked through her town to protest taxation — and subsequently was punished. Peeping "is in close relation to 'Peeking' — one peeps typically at sexual matters and 'peeks' when one wants surreptitiously to know what something is without being seen".<ref name="Strong"/>
