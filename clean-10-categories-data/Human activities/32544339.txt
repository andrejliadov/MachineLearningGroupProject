'''Hydraulic fracturing''', also called '''fracking''', '''fracing''', '''hydrofracking''', '''fraccing''', '''frac'ing''', and '''hydrofracturing''', is a [[well stimulation]] technique involving the fracturing of [[bedrock]] [[Formation (geology)|formations]] by a pressurized liquid. The process involves the high-pressure injection of 'fracking fluid' (primarily water, containing sand or other [[hydraulic fracturing proppants|proppants]] suspended with the aid of [[thickening agent]]s) into a [[wellbore]] to create cracks in the deep-rock formations through which [[natural gas]], [[petroleum]], and [[brine]] will flow more freely. When the [[hydraulic pressure]] is removed from the well, small grains of [[hydraulic fracturing proppants]] (either sand or [[aluminium oxide]]) hold the fractures open.<ref name="ECStimTech"/>

Hydraulic fracturing began as an experiment in 1947, and the first commercially successful application followed in 1950. As of 2012, 2.5 million "frac jobs" had been performed worldwide on oil and gas wells; over one million of those within the U.S.<ref>{{Citation | first=George E | last=King | url=http://www.kgs.ku.edu/PRS/Fracturing/Frac_Paper_SPE_152596.pdf | title=Hydraulic fracturing 101 | publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers | year=2012 | id=SPE 152596 | via=[[Kansas Geological Survey]]}}</ref><ref name="Fracmaps" /> Such treatment is generally necessary to achieve adequate flow rates in [[shale gas]], [[tight gas]], [[tight oil]], and [[coal seam gas]] wells.<ref name="Charlez"/> Some hydraulic fractures can form naturally in certain [[vein (geology)|veins]] or [[dike (geology)|dikes]].<ref name="Blundell et al">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4DZCHESg9R4C&pg=PA340 | title=Processes of tectonism, magmatism and mineralization: Lessons from Europe |author1=Blundell D. | journal=Ore Geology Reviews | year=2005 | volume=27 | issue=1–4 | page=340| isbn=9780444522337 | doi=10.1016/j.oregeorev.2005.07.003 }}</ref> Drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made the United States a major [[crude oil]] exporter as of 2019,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Clifford Krauss |title=The 'Monster' Texas Oil Field That Made the U.S. a Star in the World Market |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/business/energy-environment/texas-permian-field-oil.html |access-date=21 September 2019 |work=New York Times |date=3 February 2019 |quote=The shale-drilling frenzy in the Permian has enabled the United States not only to reduce crude-oil imports, but even to become a major exporter [...] New technologies for drilling and hydraulic fracturing helped bring the break-even price}}</ref> but leakage of [[methane]], a powerful [[greenhouse gas]], has dramatically increased.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Umair Irfan |title=The best case for and against a fracing ban |url=https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/9/12/20857196/fracking-ban-case-democrats-2020-president |access-date=21 September 2019 |work=[[Vox (website)]] |date=13 September 2019 |quote=During much of the fracing boom, the US economy grew and emissions declined.

There is considerable uncertainty about the scale of [[methane]] leakage associated with hydraulic fracturing, and even some evidence that leakage may cancel out the greenhouse gas emissions benefits of natural gas relative to other fossil fuels. For example, a report by Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) highlights this issue, focusing on the leakage rate in Pennsylvania during extensive testing and analysis was found to be approximately 10%, or over five times the reported figures.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Emissions Data: Highlights & Analysis|url=https://www.edf.org/pa-oil-gas/#/air-emissions|work=edf.org|publisher=Environmental Defense Fund|access-date=2 May 2018}}</ref> This leakage rate is considered representative of the hydraulic fracturing industry in the US generally.

Increases in [[seismic activity]] following hydraulic fracturing along dormant or previously unknown [[fault (geology)|faults]] are sometimes caused by the deep-injection disposal of hydraulic fracturing flowback (a byproduct of hydraulically fractured wells),<ref name="Kim"/> and produced formation brine (a byproduct of both fractured and nonfractured oil and gas wells).<ref>US Geological Survey, [http://energy.usgs.gov/EnvironmentalAspects/EnvironmentalAspectsofEnergyProductionandUse/ProducedWaters.aspx#3822110-overview Produced water, overview], accessed 8 November 2014.</ref> For these reasons, hydraulic fracturing is under international scrutiny, restricted in some countries, and banned altogether in others.<ref name="interpress08072013" /><ref name="Bweek 31.03.2011"/><ref name="Bweek 04.10.2011"/> The European Union is drafting regulations that would permit the controlled application of hydraulic fracturing.<ref name=recommendation/>

===Mechanics===
Fracturing rocks at great depth frequently becomes suppressed by [[pressure]] due to the weight of the overlying rock strata and the cementation of the formation. This suppression process is particularly significant in "tensile" ([[Fracture#Fracture modes and characteristics|Mode 1]]) fractures which require the walls of the fracture to move against this pressure. Fracturing occurs when [[effective stress]] is overcome by the pressure of fluids within the rock. The minimum [[principal stress]] becomes tensile and exceeds the [[tensile strength]] of the material.<ref name="Fjaer" /><ref name = "Price" /> Fractures formed in this way are generally oriented in a plane perpendicular to the minimum principal stress, and for this reason, hydraulic fractures in well bores can be used to determine the orientation of stresses.<ref name="Manthei"/> In natural examples, such as dikes or vein-filled fractures, the orientations can be used to infer past states of stress.<ref name="Zoback"/>

===Veins===
Most mineral [[vein (geology)|vein]] systems are a result of repeated natural fracturing during periods of relatively high [[pore fluid pressure]]. The impact of high pore fluid pressure on the formation process of mineral vein systems is particularly evident in "crack-seal" veins, where the vein material is part of a series of discrete fracturing events, and extra vein material is deposited on each occasion.<ref name="Laubach"/> One example of long-term repeated natural fracturing is in the effects of seismic activity. Stress levels rise and fall episodically, and earthquakes can cause large volumes of [[Connate fluids|connate]] water to be expelled from fluid-filled fractures. This process is referred to as "seismic pumping".<ref name="Sibson"/>

===Dikes===
Minor intrusions in the upper part of the [[crust (geology)|crust]], such as dikes, propagate in the form of fluid-filled cracks. In such cases, the fluid is [[magma]]. In sedimentary rocks with a significant water content, fluid at fracture tip will be steam.<ref name="Gill"/>

== History ==
=== Precursors ===
Fracturing as a method to stimulate shallow, hard rock oil wells dates back to the 1860s. Dynamite or nitroglycerin detonations were used to increase oil and natural gas production from petroleum bearing formations. On 24 April 1865, [[US Civil War]] veteran Col. Edward A. L. Roberts received a patent for an "[[Torpedo (petroleum)|exploding torpedo]]".<ref name="shooters"/> It was employed in [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Kentucky]], and [[West Virginia]] using liquid and also, later, solidified [[nitroglycerin]]. Later still the same method was applied to water and gas wells. Stimulation of wells with acid, instead of explosive fluids, was introduced in the 1930s. Due to [[acid etching]], fractures would not close completely resulting in further productivity increase.<ref name="petrowiki"/>

=== 20th century applications ===
[[Harold Hamm]], [[Aubrey McClendon]], [[Tom L. Ward|Tom Ward]] and [[George P. Mitchell]] are each considered to have pioneered hydraulic fracturing innovations toward practical applications.<ref>[https://mises.org/library/government-roads-subsidies-and-costs-fracking Khan, Salmaan A.] "Government Roads, Subsidies, and the Costs of Fracking", Mises Institute, 19 June 2014.

Retrieved 20 February 2018.</ref>

=== Oil and gas wells ===
The relationship between well performance and treatment pressures was studied by Floyd Farris of [[Stanolind Oil and Gas Corporation]]. This study was the basis of the first hydraulic fracturing experiment, conducted in 1947 at the [[Hugoton Natural Gas Area|Hugoton gas field]] in [[Grant County, Kansas|Grant County]] of southwestern [[Kansas]] by Stanolind.<ref name="Charlez"/><ref name="Montgomery"/> For the well treatment, {{convert|1000|USgal}} of gelled gasoline (essentially [[napalm]]) and sand from the [[Arkansas River]] was injected into the gas-producing limestone formation at {{convert|2400|ft}}. The experiment was not very successful as deliverability of the well did not change appreciably. The process was further described by J.B. Clark of Stanolind in his paper published in 1948. A patent on this process was issued in 1949 and exclusive license was granted to the Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company. On 17 March 1949, Halliburton performed the first two commercial hydraulic fracturing treatments in [[Stephens County, Oklahoma]], and [[Archer County, Texas]].<ref name="Montgomery"/> Since then, hydraulic fracturing has been used to stimulate approximately one million oil and gas wells<ref name="UT Study"/> in various geologic regimes with good success.

In contrast with large-scale hydraulic fracturing used in low-permeability formations, small hydraulic fracturing treatments are commonly used in high-permeability formations to remedy "skin damage", a low-permeability zone that sometimes forms at the rock-borehole interface. In such cases the fracturing may extend only a few feet from the borehole.<ref>A. J. Stark, A. Settari, J. R. Jones, [http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=PETSOC-98-71 Analysis of Hydraulic Fracturing of High Permeability Gas Wells to Reduce Non-darcy Skin Effects], Petroleum Society of Canada, Annual Technical Meeting, 8 – 10 June 1998, Calgary, Alberta. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016032801/http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=PETSOC-98-71 |date=16 October 2013 }}</ref>

In the [[Soviet Union]], the first hydraulic [[proppant]] fracturing was carried out in 1952. Other countries in Europe and Northern Africa subsequently employed hydraulic fracturing techniques including Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia(before 1989), Yugoslavia(before 1991), Hungary, Austria, France, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Tunisia, and Algeria.<ref name=Mader/>

=== Massive fracturing ===

Massive hydraulic fracturing (also known as high-volume hydraulic fracturing) is a technique first applied by [[Pan American Petroleum]] in [[Stephens County, Oklahoma]], USA in 1968. The definition of massive hydraulic fracturing varies, but generally refers to treatments injecting over 150 short tons, or approximately 300,000 pounds (136 metric tonnes), of proppant.<ref name="Ben E 1993, p.233-252">Ben E. Law and Charles W. Spencer, 1993, "Gas in tight reservoirs-an emerging major source of energy," ''in'' David G. Howell (ed.), ''The Future of Energy Gasses'', US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 1570, p.233-252.</ref>

American geologists gradually became aware that there were huge volumes of gas-saturated sandstones with permeability too low (generally less than 0.1 [[millidarcy]]) to recover the gas economically.<ref name="Ben E 1993, p.233-252"/> Starting in 1973, massive hydraulic fracturing was used in thousands of gas wells in the [[San Juan Basin]], [[Denver Basin]],<ref>C.R. Fast, G.B. Holman, and R. J. Covlin, "The application of massive hydraulic fracturing to the tight Muddy 'J' Formation, Wattenberg Field, Colorado," ''in'' Harry K. Veal, (ed.), ''Exploration Frontiers of the Central and Southern Rockies'' (Denver: [[Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists]], 1977) 293–300.</ref> the [[Piceance Basin]],<ref>Robert Chancellor, "Mesaverde hydraulic fracture stimulation, northern Piceance Basin – progress report," ''in'' Harry K. Veal, (ed.), ''Exploration Frontiers of the Central and Southern Rockies'' (Denver: [[Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists]], 1977) 285–291.</ref> and the [[Green River Basin]], and in other hard rock formations of the western US. Other tight sandstone wells in the US made economically viable by massive hydraulic fracturing were in the Clinton-Medina Sandstone (Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York), and Cotton Valley Sandstone (Texas and Louisiana).<ref name="Ben E 1993, p.233-252"/>

Massive hydraulic fracturing quickly spread in the late 1970s to western Canada, [[Rotliegend]] and [[Carboniferous]] gas-bearing sandstones in Germany, Netherlands (onshore and offshore gas fields), and the United Kingdom in the [[North Sea]].<ref name=Mader/>

[[Horizontal drilling|Horizontal oil or gas wells]] were unusual until the late 1980s. Then, operators in Texas began completing thousands of oil wells by drilling horizontally in the [[Austin Chalk]], and giving massive ''slickwater'' hydraulic fracturing treatments to the wellbores. Horizontal wells proved much more effective than vertical wells in producing oil from tight chalk;<ref>C.E Bell and others, [http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=00026582 Effective diverting in horizontal wells in the Austin Chalk], Society of Petroleum Engineers conference paper, 1993. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005046/http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/servlet/onepetropreview?id=00026582 |date=5 October 2013 }}</ref> sedimentary beds are usually nearly horizontal, so horizontal wells have much larger contact areas with the target formation.<ref name=Robbins2013/>

Hydraulic fracturing operations have grown exponentially since the mid-1990s, when technologic advances and increases in the price of natural gas made this technique economically viable.<ref name="McDermott-Levy 45–51">{{Cite journal|last1=McDermott-Levy|first1=By Ruth|last2=Kaktins|first2=Nina|last3=Sattler|first3=Barbara|date=June 2013|title=Fracking, the Environment, and Health|journal=American Journal of Nursing|volume=113|issue=6|pages=45–51|doi=10.1097/01.naj.0000431272.83277.f4|pmid=23702766|issn=0002-936X}}</ref>

=== Shales ===
Hydraulic fracturing of shales goes back at least to 1965, when some operators in the Big Sandy gas field of eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia started hydraulically fracturing the [[Ohio Shale]] and [[Cleveland Shale]], using relatively small fracs. The frac jobs generally increased production, especially from lower-yielding wells.<ref>E. O. Ray, [http://www.netl.doe.gov/kmd/cds/disk7/disk1/EGS%5CDevonian%20Shale%20Development%20in%20Eastern%20Kentucky.pdf Shale development in eastern Kentucky], US Energy Research and Development Administration, 1976.</ref>

In 1976, the United States government started the [[Eastern Gas Shales Project]], which included numerous public-private hydraulic fracturing demonstration projects.<ref>US Dept. of Energy, [http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/how_is_shale_gas_produced.pdf How is shale gas produced?], Apr. 2013.</ref> During the same period, the [[Gas Research Institute]], a gas industry research consortium, received approval for research and funding from the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]].<ref name="gri"/>

In 1997, Nick Steinsberger, an engineer of Mitchell Energy (now part of [[Devon Energy]]), applied the slickwater fracturing technique, using more water and higher pump pressure than previous fracturing techniques, which was used in East Texas in the [[Barnett Shale]] of north Texas.<ref name=Robbins2013/> In 1998, the new technique proved to be successful when the first 90 days gas production from the well called S.H.

As of 2013, massive hydraulic fracturing is being applied on a commercial scale to shales in the United States, Canada, and China. [[Hydraulic fracturing by country|Several additional countries are planning to use hydraulic fracturing]].<ref name=guardian010313/><ref name=nge070812/><ref name=reuters180213/>

== Process ==
According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), hydraulic fracturing is a process to stimulate a natural gas, oil, or geothermal well to maximize extraction. The EPA defines the broader process to include acquisition of source water, well construction, well stimulation, and waste disposal.<ref name="epa-ord" />

===Method===
A hydraulic fracture is formed by pumping [[fracturing fluid]] into a wellbore at a rate sufficient to increase pressure at the target depth (determined by the location of the well casing perforations), to exceed that of the fracture ''gradient'' (pressure gradient) of the rock.<ref name = "DOE primer"/> The fracture gradient is defined as pressure increase per unit of depth relative to density, and is usually measured in pounds per square inch, per square foot, or bars. The rock cracks, and the fracture fluid permeates the rock extending the crack further, and further, and so on. Fractures are localized as pressure drops off with the rate of frictional loss, which is relative to the distance from the well. Operators typically try to maintain "fracture width", or slow its decline following treatment, by introducing a [[proppant]] into the injected fluid{{spaced ndash}}a material such as grains of sand, ceramic, or other particulate, thus preventing the fractures from closing when injection is stopped and pressure removed. Consideration of proppant strength and prevention of proppant failure becomes more important at greater depths where pressure and stresses on fractures are higher. The propped fracture is permeable enough to allow the flow of gas, oil, salt water and hydraulic fracturing fluids to the well.<ref name="DOE primer" />

During the process, fracturing fluid leakoff (loss of fracturing fluid from the fracture channel into the surrounding permeable rock) occurs. If not controlled, it can exceed 70% of the injected volume. This may result in formation matrix damage, adverse formation fluid interaction, and altered fracture geometry, thereby decreasing efficiency.<ref name="Penny" />

The location of one or more fractures along the length of the borehole is strictly controlled by various methods that create or seal holes in the side of the wellbore. Hydraulic fracturing is performed in [[Casing (borehole)|cased]] wellbores, and the zones to be fractured are accessed by [[Perforation (oil well)|perforating]] the casing at those locations.<ref name="Arthur"/>

Hydraulic-fracturing equipment used in oil and natural gas fields usually consists of a slurry blender, one or more high-pressure, high-volume fracturing pumps (typically powerful triplex or quintuplex pumps) and a monitoring unit. Associated equipment includes fracturing tanks, one or more units for storage and handling of proppant, high-pressure treating iron{{clarify|date=August 2014}}, a chemical additive unit (used to accurately monitor chemical addition), low-pressure flexible hoses, and many gauges and meters for flow rate, fluid density, and treating pressure.<ref name="Chilingar"/> Chemical additives are typically 0.5% of the total fluid volume. Fracturing equipment operates over a range of pressures and injection rates, and can reach up to {{convert|100|MPa|psi}} and {{convert|265|L/s}} (100 barrels per minute).<ref name="Love"/>

===Well types===
A distinction can be made between conventional, low-volume hydraulic fracturing, used to stimulate high-permeability reservoirs for a single well, and unconventional, high-volume hydraulic fracturing, used in the completion of tight gas and shale gas wells. High-volume hydraulic fracturing usually requires higher pressures than low-volume fracturing; the higher pressures are needed to push out larger volumes of fluid and proppant that extend farther from the borehole.<ref name="bmp"/>

[[Horizontal drilling]] involves wellbores with a terminal drillhole completed as a "lateral" that extends parallel with the rock layer containing the substance to be extracted. For example, laterals extend {{convert|1500|to|5000|ft}} in the [[Barnett Shale]] basin in Texas, and up to {{convert|10000|ft}} in the [[Bakken formation]] in North Dakota. In contrast, a vertical well only accesses the thickness of the rock layer, typically {{convert|50|-|300|ft}}. Horizontal drilling reduces surface disruptions as fewer wells are required to access the same volume of rock.

Drilling often plugs up the pore spaces at the wellbore wall, reducing permeability at and near the wellbore. This reduces flow into the borehole from the surrounding rock formation, and partially seals off the borehole from the surrounding rock. Low-volume hydraulic fracturing can be used to restore permeability.<ref name="Renpu"/>

{{Main|Hydraulic fracturing proppants|List of additives for hydraulic fracturing}}

The main purposes of fracturing fluid are to extend fractures, add lubrication, change gel strength, and to carry proppant into the formation. There are two methods of transporting proppant in the fluid{{spaced ndash}}high-rate and high-[[viscosity]]. High-viscosity fracturing tends to cause large dominant fractures, while high-rate (slickwater) fracturing causes small spread-out micro-fractures.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Water-soluble gelling agents (such as [[guar gum]]) increase viscosity and efficiently deliver proppant into the formation.<ref name="CRO 2009"/>

[[File:Process of mixing water with fracking fluids to be injected into the ground.JPG|thumb|Example of high pressure manifold combining pump flows before injection into well]]

Fluid is typically a [[slurry]] of water, proppant, and [[List of additives for hydraulic fracturing|chemical additives]].<ref name=upenn/> Additionally, gels, foams, and compressed gases, including [[nitrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and air can be injected. Typically, 90% of the fluid is water and 9.5% is sand with chemical additives accounting to about 0.5%.<ref name="DOE primer"/><ref name="Hartnett"/><ref name="freeing"/> However, fracturing fluids have been developed using [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG) and propane in which water is unnecessary.<ref name=energyfuture>{{cite news |url=http://www.popsci.com/announcements/article/2013-05/june-2013-american-energy-independence |last=Brainard |first=Curtis |title=The Future of Energy |work=Popular Science Magazine |date=June 2013 |page=59 |access-date=1 January 2014}}</ref>

The proppant is a granular material that prevents the created fractures from closing after the fracturing treatment. Types of proppant include [[silica sand]], resin-coated sand, [[bauxite]], and man-made ceramics. The choice of proppant depends on the type of permeability or grain strength needed. In some formations, where the pressure is great enough to crush grains of natural silica sand, higher-strength proppants such as bauxite or ceramics may be used. The most commonly used proppant is silica sand, though proppants of uniform size and shape, such as a ceramic proppant, are believed to be more effective.<ref name="AutoZV-12"/>

The fracturing fluid varies depending on fracturing type desired, and the conditions of specific wells being fractured, and water characteristics. The fluid can be gel, foam, or slickwater-based. Fluid choices are tradeoffs: more viscous fluids, such as gels, are better at keeping proppant in suspension; while less-viscous and lower-friction fluids, such as slickwater, allow fluid to be pumped at higher rates, to create fractures farther out from the wellbore. Important material properties of the fluid include [[viscosity]], [[pH]], various [[rheology|rheological factors]], and others.

Water is mixed with sand and chemicals to create hydraulic fracturing fluid. Approximately 40,000 gallons of chemicals are used per fracturing.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=27 April 2015 | archive-date=3 July 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703142441/http://www.dangersoffracking.com/ | first1=Linda | last1=Dong | url=http://www.dangersoffracking.com | title=What goes in and out of Hydraulic Fracturing | url-status=dead | website=Dangers of Fracking}}</ref>
A typical fracture treatment uses between 3 and 12 additive chemicals.<ref name="DOE primer"/> Although there may be unconventional fracturing fluids, typical chemical additives can include one or more of the following:
* [[Acid]]s—[[hydrochloric acid]] or [[acetic acid]] is used in the pre-fracturing stage for cleaning the perforations and initiating fissure in the near-wellbore rock.<ref name="freeing"/>
* [[Sodium chloride]] (salt)—delays breakdown of gel [[polymer chain]]s.<ref name="freeing"/>
* [[Polyacrylamide]] and other friction reducers decrease turbulence in fluid flow and pipe friction, thus allowing the pumps to pump at a higher rate without having greater pressure on the surface.<ref name="freeing"/>
* [[Ethylene glycol]]—prevents formation of [[Fouling|scale deposits]] in the pipe.<ref name="freeing"/>
* [[Borate salts]]—used for maintaining fluid viscosity during the temperature increase.<ref name="freeing"/>
* [[Sodium carbonate|Sodium]] and [[Potassium carbonate|potassium]] carbonates—used for maintaining effectiveness of [[Cross-link|crosslinkers]].<ref name="freeing"/>
* Anaerobic, Biocide, BIO—[[Glutaraldehyde]] used as [[disinfectant]] of the water ([[bacteria]] elimination).<ref name="freeing"/>
* [[Guar gum]] and other water-soluble gelling agents—increases viscosity of the fracturing fluid to deliver proppant into the formation more efficiently.<ref name="CRO 2009"/><ref name="freeing"/>
* [[Citric acid]]—used for [[corrosion]] prevention.
* [[Isopropanol]]—used to winterize the chemicals to ensure it doesn't freeze.<ref name="freeing"/>

The most common chemical used for [[hydraulic fracturing in the United States]] in 2005–2009 was [[methanol]], while some other most widely used chemicals were [[isopropyl alcohol]], [[2-butoxyethanol]], and [[ethylene glycol]].<ref name="house1"/>

Typical fluid types are:
* Conventional linear gels. These gels are cellulose derivative ([[carboxymethyl cellulose]], [[hydroxyethyl cellulose]], [[carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose]], [[hydroxypropyl cellulose]], [[hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose]]), [[guar]] or its derivatives ([[hydroxypropyl guar]], [[carboxymethyl hydroxypropyl guar]]), mixed with other chemicals.{{Clarify|date = November 2015|reason = How is this list supposed to be parsed?}}
* Borate-crosslinked fluids. These are guar-based fluids cross-linked with [[boron]] ions (from aqueous [[borax]]/[[boric acid]] solution). These gels have higher viscosity at pH 9 onwards and are used to carry proppant. After the fracturing job, the pH is reduced to 3–4 so that the cross-links are broken, and the gel is less viscous and can be pumped out.
* Organometallic-crosslinked fluids – [[zirconium]], [[chromium]], [[antimony]], [[titanium]] salts – are known to crosslink guar-based gels. The crosslinking mechanism is not reversible, so once the proppant is pumped down along with cross-linked gel, the fracturing part is done. The gels are broken down with appropriate breakers.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}<ref name="CRO 2009" />
* Aluminium phosphate-ester oil gels. [[Aluminium phosphate]] and [[ester]] oils are slurried to form cross-linked gel. These are one of the first known gelling systems.

For slickwater fluids the use of sweeps is common. Sweeps are temporary reductions in the proppant concentration, which help ensure that the well is not overwhelmed with proppant.<ref name="Canada"/> As the fracturing process proceeds, viscosity-reducing agents such as [[oxidizer]]s and [[enzyme]] breakers are sometimes added to the fracturing fluid to deactivate the gelling agents and encourage flowback.<ref name="CRO 2009"/> Such oxidizers react with and break down the gel, reducing the fluid's viscosity and ensuring that no proppant is pulled from the formation. An enzyme acts as a catalyst for breaking down the gel. Sometimes [[Froth flotation#Modifiers|pH modifiers]] are used to break down the crosslink at the end of a hydraulic fracturing job, since many require a pH buffer system to stay viscous.<ref name="Canada"/> At the end of the job, the well is commonly flushed with water under pressure (sometimes blended with a friction reducing chemical.) Some (but not all) injected fluid is recovered. This fluid is managed by several methods, including underground injection control, treatment, discharge, recycling, and temporary storage in pits or containers. New technology is continually developing to better handle waste water and improve re-usability.<ref name="DOE primer"/>

===Fracture monitoring===
Measurements of the pressure and rate during the growth of a hydraulic fracture, with knowledge of fluid properties and proppant being injected into the well, provides the most common and simplest method of monitoring a hydraulic fracture treatment. This data along with knowledge of the underground geology can be used to model information such as length, width and conductivity of a propped fracture.<ref name="DOE primer"/>

Injection of [[radioactive tracer]]s along with the fracturing fluid is sometimes used to determine the injection profile and location of created fractures.<ref name="Reis iodine" /> [[radioactive tracer|Radiotracers]] are selected to have the readily detectable radiation, appropriate chemical properties, and a half life and toxicity level that will minimize initial and residual contamination.<ref name="IAEA 2003" /> Radioactive isotopes chemically bonded to glass (sand) and/or resin beads may also be injected to track fractures.<ref name="NRC"/> For example, plastic pellets coated with 10 GBq of Ag-110mm may be added to the proppant, or sand may be labelled with Ir-192, so that the proppant's progress can be monitored.<ref name="IAEA 2003" /> Radiotracers such as Tc-99m and I-131 are also used to measure flow rates.<ref name="IAEA 2003" /> The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] publishes guidelines which list a wide range of radioactive materials in solid, liquid and gaseous forms that may be used as tracers and limit the amount that may be used per injection and per well of each radionuclide.<ref name="NRC"/>

A new technique in well-monitoring involves fiber-optic cables outside the casing. Using the fiber optics, temperatures can be measured every foot along the well – even while the wells are being fracked and pumped. By monitoring the temperature of the well, engineers can determine how much hydraulic fracturing fluid different parts of the well use as well as how much natural gas or oil they collect, during hydraulic fracturing operation and when the well is producing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==== Microseismic monitoring ====
For more advanced applications, [[microseismic]] monitoring is sometimes used to estimate the size and orientation of induced fractures. Microseismic activity is measured by placing an array of [[geophone]]s in a nearby wellbore. By mapping the location of any small seismic events associated with the growing fracture, the approximate geometry of the fracture is inferred. [[Tiltmeter]] arrays deployed on the surface or down a well provide another technology for monitoring strain<ref name="Oilfield Review 2005/2006"/>

Microseismic mapping is very similar geophysically to [[seismology]]. In earthquake seismology, seismometers scattered on or near the surface of the earth record [[S-waves]] and [[P-waves]] that are released during an earthquake event. This allows for motion{{clarify|date=August 2014}} along the fault plane to be estimated and its location in the Earth's subsurface mapped. Hydraulic fracturing, an increase in formation stress proportional to the net fracturing pressure, as well as an increase in pore pressure due to leakoff.{{clarify|reason = Not only is this highly technical, it's not a sentence.|date=November 2015}}<ref name="Fehler 1989">{{cite journal |last=Fehler |first=Michael C. |title=Stress Control of seismicity patterns observed during hydraulic fracturing experiments at the Fenton Hill hot dry rock geothermal energy site, New Mexico |journal=International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences & Geomechanics Abstracts |year= 1989 |volume= 26 |issue=3–4 |series=3 |doi=10.1016/0148-9062(89)91971-2 |pages=211–219|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1258335 }}</ref> Tensile stresses are generated ahead of the fracture's tip, generating large amounts of [[shear stress]].

Different methods have different location errors{{clarify|date=August 2014}} and advantages. Accuracy of microseismic event mapping is dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio and the distribution of sensors. Accuracy of events located by [[seismic inversion]] is improved by sensors placed in multiple azimuths from the monitored borehole. In a downhole array location, accuracy of events is improved by being close to the monitored borehole (high signal-to-noise ratio).

Monitoring of microseismic events induced by reservoir{{clarify|date=August 2014}} stimulation has become a key aspect in evaluation of hydraulic fractures, and their optimization. The main goal of hydraulic fracture monitoring is to completely characterize the induced fracture structure, and distribution of conductivity within a formation. Geomechanical analysis, such as understanding a formations material properties, in-situ conditions, and geometries, helps monitoring by providing a better definition of the environment in which the fracture network propagates.<ref name="Cipolla 2010">{{cite journal |url=http://www.slb.com/resources/technical_papers/stimulation/133877.aspx |last=Cipolla |first=Craig |title=Hydraulic Fracture Monitoring to Reservoir Simulation: Maximizing Value |journal=SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition |year=2010 |access-date=1 January 2014|doi=10.2118/133877-MS }}</ref> The next task is to know the location of proppant within the fracture and the distribution of fracture conductivity. This can be monitored using multiple types of techniques to finally develop a reservoir model than accurately predicts well performance.

===Horizontal completions===
Since the early 2000s, advances in [[Oil well#Drilling|drilling]] and [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|completion]] technology have made horizontal wellbores much{{clarify|date=August 2014}} more economical. Horizontal wellbores allow far greater exposure to a formation than conventional vertical wellbores. This is particularly useful in shale formations which do not have sufficient permeability to produce economically with a vertical well. Such wells, when drilled onshore, are now usually hydraulically fractured in a number of stages, especially in North America. The type of wellbore completion is used to determine how many times a formation is fractured, and at what locations along the horizontal section.<ref name="AutoZV-13" />

In North America, shale reservoirs such as the [[Bakken formation|Bakken]], [[Barnett Shale|Barnett]], [[Montney Formation|Montney]], [[Haynesville Shale|Haynesville]], [[Marcellus Formation|Marcellus]], and most recently the [[Eagle Ford Formation|Eagle Ford]], [[Niobrara Formation|Niobrara]] and [[Utica Shale|Utica]] shales are drilled horizontally through the producing intervals, completed and fractured.{{Citation needed |date=December 2011}} The method by which the fractures are placed along the wellbore is most commonly achieved by one of two methods, known as "plug and perf" and "sliding sleeve".<ref name="undeerc"/>

The wellbore for a plug-and-perf job is generally composed of standard steel casing, cemented or uncemented, set in the drilled hole. Once the drilling rig has been removed, a [[Wireline (cabling)|wireline truck]] is used to [[Perforation (oil well)|perforate]] near the bottom of the well, and then fracturing fluid is pumped. Then the wireline truck sets a plug in the well to temporarily seal off that section so the next section of the wellbore can be treated. Another stage is pumped, and the process is repeated along the horizontal length of the wellbore.<ref name="AutoZV-14" />

The wellbore for the sliding sleeve{{clarify|date=August 2014}} technique is different in that the sliding sleeves are included at set spacings in the steel casing at the time it is set in place. The sliding sleeves are usually all closed at this time. When the well is due to be fractured, the bottom sliding sleeve is opened using one of several activation techniques{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}} and the first stage gets pumped. Once finished, the next sleeve is opened, concurrently isolating the previous stage, and the process repeats. For the sliding sleeve method, wireline is usually not required.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

[[File:Sleeves.JPG|thumb|Sleeves]]

These completion techniques may allow for more than 30 stages to be pumped into the horizontal section of a single well if required, which is far more than would typically be pumped into a vertical well that had far fewer feet of producing zone exposed.<ref name = "mooney" />

== Uses ==

Hydraulic fracturing is used to increase the rate at which fluids, such as petroleum, water, or natural gas can be recovered from subterranean natural reservoirs. Reservoirs are typically porous [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s or [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] rocks, but also include "unconventional reservoirs" such as [[shale]] rock or [[coal]] beds. Hydraulic fracturing enables the extraction of natural gas and oil from rock formations deep below the earth's surface (generally {{convert|5000|–|20000|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip|sigfig=1}}), which is greatly below typical groundwater reservoir levels. At such depth, there may be insufficient [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] or reservoir pressure to allow natural gas and oil to flow from the rock into the wellbore at high economic return. Thus, creating conductive fractures in the rock is instrumental in extraction from naturally impermeable shale reservoirs. Permeability is measured in the micro[[darcy (unit)|darcy]] to nanodarcy range.<ref name="AutoZV-2" /> Fractures are a conductive path connecting a larger volume of reservoir to the well. So-called "super fracking," creates cracks deeper in the rock formation to release more oil and gas, and increases efficiency.<ref name="BW 19.01.2012"/> The yield for typical shale bores generally falls off after the first year or two, but the peak producing life of a well can be extended to several decades.<ref name="Geosoc yield" />

While the main industrial use of hydraulic fracturing is in stimulating production from [[Oil well|oil and gas wells]],<ref name="Economides"/><ref name="AutoZV-3"/><ref name="AutoZV-4"/> hydraulic fracturing is also applied:
* To stimulate groundwater wells<ref name="AutoZV-6" />
* To precondition or induce rock cave-ins [[mining]]<ref name="AutoZV-7" />
* As a means of enhancing waste remediation, usually hydrocarbon waste or spills<ref name = "hazmat40.2" />
* To dispose waste by injection deep into rock<ref name="Bell" />
* To measure stress in the Earth<ref name="Aamodt" />
* For electricity generation in [[enhanced geothermal system]]s<ref name="AutoZV-8" />
* To increase injection rates for [[Geologic sequestration of CO2|geologic sequestration of {{CO2}}]]<ref name="Miller" />

Since the late 1970s, hydraulic fracturing has been used, in some cases, to increase the yield of drinking water from wells in a number of countries, including the United States, Australia, and South Africa.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = James | last1 = Waltz | first2 = Tim L | last2 = Decker | title = Hydro-fracturing offers many benefits | journal = Johnson Driller's Journal | issue = 2nd quarter | year = 1981 | pages = 4–9}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = WH | last = Williamson | contribution = The use of hydraulic techniques to improve the yield of bores in fractured rocks | title = Groundwater in Fractured Rock | publisher = Australian Water Resources Council | series = Conference Series | number = 5 | year = 1982}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first1 = C | last1 = Less | first2 = N | last2 = Andersen | title = Hydrofracture: state of the art in South Africa | journal = Applied Hydrogeology | date=Feb 1994 | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 59–63| doi = 10.1007/s100400050050 }}</ref>

==Economic effects==
{{see also|Shale gas|Tight oil|Price of oil|Hydraulic fracturing in the United States}}
[[File:US-EP-Cash-Burn-2009-2016.png|thumb|Production costs for unconventional oil and gas continue to outweigh profits]]

Hydraulic fracturing has been seen as one of the key methods of extracting [[unconventional oil]] and [[unconventional gas]] resources. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], the remaining technically recoverable resources of shale gas are estimated to amount to {{convert|208|e12m3|e12cuft|abbr=off}}, tight gas to {{convert|76|e12m3|e12cuft|abbr=off}}, and [[coalbed methane]] to {{convert|47|e12m3|e12cuft|abbr=off}}. As a rule, formations of these resources have lower permeability than conventional gas formations. Therefore, depending on the geological characteristics of the formation, specific technologies such as hydraulic fracturing are required. Although there are also other methods to extract these resources, such as conventional drilling or horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing is one of the key methods making their extraction economically viable. The multi-stage fracturing technique has facilitated the development of shale gas and light tight oil production in the United States and is believed to do so in the other countries with unconventional hydrocarbon resources.<ref name="WEO2012 Special"/>

A large majority of studies indicate that hydraulic fracturing in the United States has had a strong positive economic benefit so far. The Brookings Institution estimates that the benefits of Shale Gas alone has led to a net economic benefit of $48 billion per year. Most of this benefit is within the consumer and industrial sectors due to the significantly reduced prices for natural gas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2015/03/23/the-economic-benefits-of-fracking/|title=The economic benefits of fracking|last=Dews|first=Fred|work=Brookings|access-date=21 November 2017}}</ref> Other studies have suggested that the economic benefits are outweighed by the externalities and that the [[levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE) from less carbon and water intensive sources is lower.<ref>Phillips.

The primary benefit of hydraulic fracturing is to offset imports of natural gas and oil, where the cost paid to producers otherwise exits the domestic economy. However, shale oil and gas is highly subsidised in the US, and has not yet covered production costs<ref>{{cite web|title=Wall Street Tells Frackers to Stop Counting Barrels, Start Making Profits|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-streets-fracking-frenzy-runs-dry-as-profits-fail-to-materialize-1512577420|website=www.wsj.com|publisher=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2 May 2018}}</ref> – meaning that the cost of hydraulic fracturing is paid for in income taxes, and in many cases is up to double the cost paid at the pump.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Art|title=Shale Gas Is Not A Revolution|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/arthurberman/2017/07/05/shale-gas-is-not-a-revolution/|website=forbes.com|publisher=Forbes|access-date=2 May 2018}}</ref>

===Politics and public policy===
An [[anti-fracking movement]] has emerged both internationally with involvement of international [[environmental organization]]s and nations such as France and locally in affected areas such as [[Balcombe]] in Sussex where the [[Balcombe drilling protest]] was in progress during mid-2013.<ref name=Ecologist713>{{cite news|title=The UK's anti fracking movement is growing |url=http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2016997/the_uks_anti_fracking_movement_is_growing.html |access-date=29 July 2013 |work=The Ecologist|date=1 August 2013|author=Jan Goodey}}</ref> The considerable opposition against hydraulic fracturing activities in local townships in the United States has led companies to adopt a variety of [[public relations]] measures to reassure the public, including the employment of former military personnel with training in [[psychological warfare]] operations. According to Matt Pitzarella, the communications director at [[Range Resources]], employees trained in the Middle East have been valuable to Range Resources in Pennsylvania, when dealing with emotionally charged township meetings and advising townships on zoning and local ordinances dealing with hydraulic fracturing.<ref name="psyops"/><ref name="AutoZV-38"/>

There have been many protests directed at hydraulic fracturing. For example, ten people were arrested in 2013 during an anti-fracking protest near New Matamoras, Ohio, after they illegally entered a development zone and latched themselves to drilling equipment.<ref name="PalmerMike"/> In northwest Pennsylvania, there was a drive-by shooting at a well site, in which someone shot two rounds of a small-caliber rifle in the direction of a drilling rig, before shouting profanities at the site and fleeing the scene.<ref name="PhillyInq001"/> In [[Washington County, Pennsylvania]], a contractor working on a gas pipeline found a [[pipe bomb]] that had been placed where a pipeline was to be constructed, which local authorities said would have caused a "catastrophe" had they not discovered and detonated it.<ref name="DetrowScott"/>

In 2014 a number of European officials suggested that several major European protests against hydraulic fracturing (with mixed success in Lithuania and Ukraine) may be partially sponsored by [[Gazprom]], Russia's state-controlled gas company. The [[New York Times]] suggested that Russia saw its natural gas exports to Europe as a key element of its geopolitical influence, and that this market would diminish if hydraulic fracturing is adopted in Eastern Europe, as it opens up significant [[shale gas]] reserves in the region. Russian officials have on numerous occasions made public statements to the effect that hydraulic fracturing "poses a huge environmental problem".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/world/russian-money-suspected-behind-fracking-protests.html | title=Russian Money Suspected Behind Fracking Protests | work=New York Times | date=30 November 2014 | access-date=4 December 2014 | author=Andrew Higgins}}</ref>

Hydraulic fracturing is currently taking place in the United States in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Other states, such as Alabama, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio, are either considering or preparing for drilling using this method. Maryland<ref>https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2017/04/04/with-governors-signature-maryland-becomes-third-state-to-ban-fracking/</ref> and Vermont have permanently banned hydraulic fracturing, and New York and North Carolina have instituted temporary bans. New Jersey currently has a bill before its legislature to extend a 2012 moratorium on hydraulic fracturing that recently expired. Although a hydraulic fracturing moratorium was recently lifted in the United Kingdom, the government is proceeding cautiously because of concerns about earthquakes and the environmental impact of drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is currently banned in France and Bulgaria.<ref name="McDermott-Levy 45–51"/>

In December 2016 the Environmental Protection Agency issued the "Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States (Final Report)."

The movie presented problems with groundwater contamination near well sites in Pennsylvania, Wyoming, and Colorado.<ref name="AutoZV-25"/> ''Energy in Depth'', an oil and gas industry lobbying group, called the film's facts into question.<ref name=indepth/> In response, a rebuttal of ''<nowiki>Energy in Depth'</nowiki>''s claims of inaccuracy was posted on ''Gasland's'' website.<ref name="AutoZV-27"/> The Director of the [[Colorado Department of Natural Resources|Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission]] (COGCC) offered to be interviewed as part of the film if he could review what was included from the interview in the final film but Fox declined the offer.<ref name=COGCC/> [[Exxon Mobil]], [[Chevron Corporation]] and [[ConocoPhillips]] aired advertisements during 2011 and 2012 that claimed to describe the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas and argue that hydraulic fracturing was safe.<ref name="Promised Land" />

The 2012 film ''[[Promised Land (2012 film)|Promised Land]]'', starring [[Matt Damon]], takes on hydraulic fracturing.<ref name=progressive/> The gas industry countered the film's criticisms of hydraulic fracturing with informational flyers, and [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] posts.<ref name="Promised Land" />

In January 2013, [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] journalist and filmmaker [[Phelim McAleer]] released a crowdfunded<ref>Kickstarter, FrackNation by Ann and Phelim Media LLC, 6 April 2012</ref> documentary called ''[[FrackNation]]'' as a response to the statements made by Fox in ''Gasland'', claiming it "tells the truth about fracking for natural gas". ''FrackNation'' premiered on [[Mark Cuban]]'s [[AXS TV]]. The premiere corresponded with the release of ''Promised Land''.<ref>The Hollywood Reporter, Mark Cuban's AXS TV Picks Up Pro-Fracking Documentary 'FrackNation', 17 December 2012</ref>

In April 2013, Josh Fox released ''Gasland 2'', his "international odyssey uncovering a trail of secrets, lies and contamination related to hydraulic fracking". It challenges the gas industry's portrayal of natural gas as a clean and safe alternative to oil as a myth, and that hydraulically fractured wells inevitably leak over time, contaminating water and air, hurting families, and endangering the earth's climate with the potent greenhouse gas methane.

In 2014, Scott Cannon of Video Innovations released the documentary ''The Ethics of Fracking''. The film covers the politics, spiritual, scientific, medical and professional points of view on hydraulic fracturing. It also digs into the way the gas industry portrays hydraulic fracturing in their advertising.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ethics of Fracking|url=http://www.greenplanetfilms.org/product/the-ethics-of-fracking/|website=Green Planet Films}}</ref>

In 2015, the Canadian documentary film ''[[Fractured Land]]'' had its world premiere at the [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thetyee.ca/Video/2015/09/09/Fractured-Land-VIFF/ |work=The Tyee |date=9 September 2015 |title='Fractured Land' Doc Coming to VIFF |access-date=20 October 2015}}</ref>

===Research issues===
Typically the funding source of the research studies is a focal point of controversy. Concerns have been raised about research funded by foundations and corporations, or by environmental groups, which can at times lead to at least the appearance of unreliable studies.<ref name="Deller"/><ref name="SoraghanMike"/> Several organizations, researchers, and media outlets have reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on hydraulic fracturing due to industry<ref name="Urbina 03Mar2011" /> and governmental pressure,<ref name="interpress08072013" /> and expressed concern over possible censoring of environmental reports.<ref name = "Urbina 03Mar2011" /><ref name="NYT lobbying docs" /><ref name="NYT Docs" /> Some have argued there is a need for more research into the environmental and health effects of the technique.<ref name=fh2013>{{cite journal | last1 = Finkel | first1 = M.L. | last2 = Hays | first2 = J. |title=The implications of unconventional drilling for natural gas: a global public health concern |journal=Public Health |volume=127 |issue=10 |pages=889–893 | date=October 2013 |pmid=24119661 |doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2013.07.005 |type=Review}}</ref><ref name=PHE2014/><ref name="Bloomberg 11.01.2012" /><ref name="BW 04Jan2012" />

There is concern over the possible adverse [[public health]] implications of hydraulic fracturing activity.<ref name=fh2013/> A 2013 review on shale gas production in the United States stated, "with increasing numbers of drilling sites, more people are at risk from accidents and exposure to harmful substances used at fractured wells."<ref name=Centner2013>{{cite journal|last1=Centner|first1=Terence J.|title=Oversight of shale gas production in the United States and the disclosure of toxic substances|journal=Resources Policy|date=September 2013|volume=38|issue=3|pages=233–240 |doi=10.1016/j.resourpol.2013.03.001 }}</ref> A 2011 hazard assessment recommended full disclosure of chemicals used for hydraulic fracturing and drilling as many have immediate health effects, and many may have long-term health effects.<ref name=Colborn2011>{{cite journal|last1=Colborn|first1=Theo|s2cid=53996198|title=Natural Gas Operations from a Public Health Perspective|journal=Human and Ecological Risk Assessment|date=20 September 2011|volume=17|issue=5|pages=1039–1056|doi=10.1080/10807039.2011.605662|url=http://cce.cornell.edu/EnergyClimateChange/NaturalGasDev/Documents/PDFs/fracking%20chemicals%20from%20a%20public%20health%20perspective.pdf|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

In June 2014 [[Public Health England]] published a review of the potential public health impacts of exposures to chemical and radioactive pollutants as a result of shale gas extraction in the UK, based on the examination of literature and data from countries where hydraulic fracturing already occurs.<ref name=PHE2014/> The executive summary of the report stated: "An assessment of the currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health from exposure to the emissions associated with shale gas extraction will be low if the operations are properly run and regulated. Most evidence suggests that [[Groundwater pollution|contamination of groundwater]], if it occurs, is most likely to be caused by leakage through the vertical borehole. Contamination of groundwater from the underground hydraulic fracturing process itself (i.e. the fracturing of the shale) is unlikely. However, surface spills of hydraulic fracturing fluids or wastewater may affect groundwater, and emissions to air also have the potential to impact on health. Where potential risks have been identified in the literature, the reported problems are typically a result of operational failure and a poor regulatory environment."<ref name=PHE2014/>{{rp|iii}}

A 2012 report prepared for the European Union Directorate-General for the Environment identified potential risks to humans from air pollution and ground water contamination posed by hydraulic fracturing.<ref name=aea2012/> This led to a series of recommendations in 2014 to mitigate these concerns.<ref>{{cite journal|title=EU Commission minimum principles for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons (such as shale gas) using high-volume hydraulic fracturing|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014H0070|publisher=EUR LEX|date=8 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Energy and environment|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/energy/unconventional_en.htm|publisher=EUR LEX}}</ref> A 2012 guidance for pediatric nurses in the US said that hydraulic fracturing had a potential negative impact on public health and that pediatric nurses should be prepared to gather information on such topics so as to advocate for improved community health.<ref name=lauver2012>{{cite journal |author=Lauver LS |title=Environmental health advocacy: an overview of natural gas drilling in northeast Pennsylvania and implications for pediatric nursing |journal=J Pediatr Nurs |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=383–9 | date=August 2012 |pmid=22703686 |doi=10.1016/j.pedn.2011.07.012 }}</ref>

A 2017 study in ''[[The American Economic Review]]'' found that "additional well pads drilled within 1 kilometer of a community water system intake increases shale gas-related contaminants in drinking water."<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Elaine|first1=Hill|last2=Lala|first2=Ma|date=1 May 2017|title=Shale Gas Development and Drinking Water Quality|journal=American Economic Review|volume=107|issue=5|doi=10.1257/aer.p20171133|pmid=29430021|pmc=5804812|issn=0002-8282|pages=522–525}}</ref>

Statistics collected by the U.S. Department of Labor and analyzed by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] show a correlation between drilling activity and the number of occupational injuries related to drilling and motor vehicle accidents, explosions, falls, and fires.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2008|title=Fatalities among oil and gas extraction workers – United States, 2003–2006|doi=10.1037/e458082008-002}}</ref> Extraction workers are also at risk for developing pulmonary diseases, including lung cancer and silicosis (the latter because of exposure to silica dust generated from rock drilling and the handling of sand).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=McDonald|first1=J.

Additionally, the extraction workforce is at increased risk for radiation exposure. Fracking activities often require drilling into rock that contains naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM), such as radon, thorium, and uranium.<ref name="dx.doi.org">{{Cite journal|date=1 June 1993|title=Office of radiation and indoor air: Program description|doi=10.2172/10115876|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1272587/}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter=Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|doi=10.1007/springerreference_32156|title=Springer ''Reference''|year=2011}}</ref>

Another report done by the Canadian Medical Journal reported that after researching they identified 55 factors that may cause cancer, including 20 that have been shown to increase the risk of leukemia and lymphoma. The Yale Public Health analysis warns that millions of people living within a mile of fracking wells may have been exposed to these chemicals.<ref>{{cite journal| pmc=5235941 | pmid=27956395 | doi=10.1503/cmaj.109-5358 | volume=189 | issue=2 | title=Fracking tied to cancer-causing chemicals | year=2017 | journal=CMAJ | pages=E94–E95 | last1 = Vogel | first1 = L}}</ref>
