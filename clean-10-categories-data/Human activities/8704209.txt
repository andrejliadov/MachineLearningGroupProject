The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of a topical guide to design:

'''Design''' (as a verb: to design) is the intentional creation of a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process. 
Design (as a noun: a design) can refer to such a plan or specification (e.g. a drawing or other document) or to the created object, etc., and features of it such as aesthetic, functional, economic or socio-political.<ref>See dictionary meanings in the [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/results.asp?searchword=design&x=64&y=13&= Cambridge Dictionary of American English], at [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/design Dictionary.com] (esp. meanings 1-5 and 7-8) and at [http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/design?view=uk AskOxford] (esp. verbs).</ref>

* [[Wicked problem]] &ndash; problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. The use of term "wicked" here has come to denote resistance to resolution, rather than evil. Moreover, because of complex interdependencies, the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems.
