'''Balasore Roads''' is a [[roadstead]] (a sheltered anchorage), on the [[India|Indian]] coast near [[Balasore]]. It was the location of the [[List of vessels of the Bengal Pilot Service to 1834|Bengal Pilot Service]] pilot boarding station (see chart). It was considered to be a generally safe anchorage, with depths varying from 5 to 15 fathoms, and with the sea bottom consisting of mud and sand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Directory for the Navigation of the Indian Ocean, with descriptions of its Coasts, Islands, Etc., from the Cape of Good Hope to the Strait of Sundas and Western Australia; including also the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf; the Winds, Monsoons, and Currents, and the Passages from Europe to its Various Ports|last=Findlay|first=Alexander George|publisher=Richard Holmes Laurie|year=1866|isbn=|location=|pages=874 - 875}}</ref>

The entrance to the [[Hooghly River]] was considered to be the most difficult of any river in India,<ref>{{Cite book|title=A New Nautical Directory for the East-India and China Navigation (7th Ed.)|last=Wright|first=Gabriel (Editor)|publisher=S.

During the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] French privateer captains such as [[Jean-François Hodoul]] and [[Robert Surcouf]] would cruise the mouth of the Hooghly River hoping to capture vessels anchored in the Roads, or proceeding to or from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. The French captured both pilot vessels such as {{ship||Cartier|1787 ship|2}}, and large [[East Indiamen]] such as {{ship||Triton|1787 EIC ship|2}}.
