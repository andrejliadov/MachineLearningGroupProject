{{See also|Casualty recording}}

In [[armed conflict]]s, the '''civilian casualty ratio''' (also '''civilian death ratio''', '''civilian-combatant ratio''', etc.) is the [[ratio]] of [[civilian casualties]] to [[combatant]] [[casualties]], or total casualties. The measurement can apply either to casualties inflicted by or to a particular [[belligerent]], casualties inflicted in one aspect or arena of a conflict or to casualties in the conflict as a whole. Casualties usually refer to both dead and injured. In some calculations, deaths resulting from [[famine]] and [[epidemics]] are included.

Starting in the 1980s, it was often claimed that 90 percent of the victims of modern wars were [[civilians]],<ref>Kahnert, M., D. Pitt, et al., Eds. (1983). ''Children and War: Proceedings of Symposium at Siuntio Baths, Finland, 1983.'' Geneva and Helsinki, [[Geneva International Peace Research Institute]], IPB and Peace Union of Finland, p. 5, which states: "Of the human victims in the First World War only 5% were civilians, in the Second World War already 50%, in Vietnam War between 50 - 90 % and according to some information in Lebanon 97%. It has been appraised that in a conventional war in Europe up to 99% of the victims would be civilians."</ref><ref>[[Graça Machel]], [http://www.unicef.org/graca/a51-306_en.pdf "The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children,''  Report of the expert of the Secretary-General, 26 Aug 1996, p. 9.]</ref><ref>[[Mary Kaldor]], [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&id=XVgVstFi0XUC&dq=mary+kaldor&q=90+per+cent#v=snippet&q=90%20per%20cent&f=false ''New and Old Wars: Organized Violence in a Global Era'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 1999, p. 107.]</ref><ref>[[Howard Zinn]], Moises Samam, Gino Strada.

The most comprehensive examination of civilian war deaths throughout history is by [[William Eckhardt (law)|William Eckhardt]],<ref>[http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/20/1/89.full.pdf Eckhardt, W. "Civilian deaths in wartime." ''Security Dialogue'' 20(1): 89-98.] Also at [http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/20/1/89.extract]</ref> in which Eckhardt states:

<blockquote>On the average, half of the deaths caused by war happened to civilians, only some of whom were killed by famine associated with war...The civilian percentage share of war-related deaths remained at about 50% from century to century. (p. 97)</blockquote>

==Mexican Revolution (1910–20)==
Although it is estimated that over 1 million people died in the [[Mexican Revolution]], most died from disease and hunger as an indirect result of the war. Combat deaths are generally agreed to have totaled about 250,000. According to Eckhardt, these included 125,000 civilian deaths and 125,000 combatant deaths, creating a civilian-combatant death ratio of 1:1 among combat deaths.<ref>[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat2.htm Twentieth Century Atlas&nbsp;– Death Tolls].

==World War I==
{{see also|World War I casualties}}
Some 7 million combatants on both sides are estimated to have died during [[World War I]], along with an estimated 10 million non-combatants, including 6.6 million civilians.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The civilian casualty ratio in this estimate would be about 59%. Boris Urlanis notes a lack of data on civilian losses in the Ottoman Empire, but estimates 8.6 million military killed and dead and 6 million civilians killed and dead in the other warring countries.<ref>Urlanis, Boris, ''War and Population'', pp. 209 and 268, rounded off.</ref> The civilian casualty ratio in this estimate would be about 42%. Most of the civilian fatalities were due to famine, [[typhus]], or [[Spanish flu]] rather than combat action. The relatively low ratio of civilian casualties in this war is due to the fact that the front lines on the main battlefront, the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]], were static for most of the war, so that civilians were able to avoid the combat zones.

[[Chemical weapons in World War I|Chemical weapons were widely used by all sides during the conflict]] and wind frequently carried poison gas into nearby towns where civilians did not have access to [[gas masks]] or warning systems. An estimated 100,000-260,000 civilian casualties were affected by the use of chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands more died from the effects of such weapons in the years after the conflict ended.<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, Second Edition |author=D.

Germany suffered 750,000 civilian dead during and after the war due to famine caused by the [[blockade of Germany|Allied blockade]]. [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]] suffered civilian casualties in the millions in the [[Russian Civil War]] and invasion of [[Anatolia]] respectively.<ref name=neiberg_pp68-70/> [[Armenia]] suffered up to 1.5 million civilians dead in the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref>Urlanis, Boris, ''War and Population'', p. 278</ref>

==World War II==
{{see also|World War II casualties}}
According to most sources, [[World War II]] was the most lethal war in world history, with some 70 million killed in six years. The civilian to combatant fatality ratio in World War II lies somewhere between 3:2 and 2:1, or from 60% to 67%.<ref name=sadowski_p134>Sadowski, p. 134. See the [[World War II casualties]] article for a detailed breakdown of casualties.</ref> The high ratio of civilian casualties in this war was due in part to the increasing effectiveness and lethality of strategic weapons which were used to target enemy industrial or population centers, and [[famines]] caused by economic disruption. An estimated 2.1–3 million Indians died in the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] in [[British Raj|India]] during World War II. A substantial number of civilians in this war were also deliberately killed by [[Axis Powers]] as a result of racial policies (for example, the [[Holocaust]]) or [[ethnic cleansing]] campaigns.<ref name=neiberg_pp68-70>[[Michael S. Neiberg|Neiberg, Michael S.]] (2002): ''Warfare in World History'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=PLQ9N1f7HnAC&pg=PA68&dq=%22civilian+casualties%22+%22world+war+i%22&hl=en&ei=c50ATabrFs2HcbmYxasH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=28&ved=0CLMBEOgBMBs#v=onepage&q=%22civilian%20casualties%22%20%22world%20war%20i%22&f=false pp. 68-70], Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-22954-8}}.</ref>

==Korean War==
The median total estimated Korean civilian deaths in the [[Korean War]] is 2,730,000. The total estimated North Korean combatant deaths is 213,000 and the estimated Chinese combatant deaths is over 400,000. In addition to this the Republic of Korea combatant deaths is around 134,000 dead and the combatant deaths for the [[United Nations]] side is around 49,000 dead and missing (40,000 dead, 9,000 missing). The estimated total Korean war military dead is around 793,000 deaths. The civilian-combatant death ratio in the war is approximately 2:1 or 67%. One source estimates that 20% of the total population of North Korea perished in the war.<ref name=deane_p149>Deane, p. 149.</ref>

==Vietnam War==
The Vietnamese government has estimated the number of Vietnamese civilians killed in the [[Vietnam War]] at two million, and the number of [[North Vietnamese Army|NVA]] and [[Viet Cong]] killed at 1.1 million—estimates which approximate those of a number of other sources.<ref name=shenon>[http://www.virtual.vietnam.ttu.edu/star/images/232/2322414020.pdf "20 Years After Victory"]{{Dead link|date=July 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Philip Shenon, clipping from the Vietnam Center and Archive website.</ref> This would give a civilian-combatant fatality ratio of approximately 2:1, or 67%. These figures do not include civilians killed in [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]]. However, the lowest estimate of 411,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.TAB6.1A.GIF |title=Table 6.1A - Vietnam Democide Estimates Sources and Calculations |publisher=University of Hawaii |access-date=2014-01-05}}</ref> civilians killed during the war (including civilians killed in [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]]) would give a civilian-combatant fatality ratio of approximately 1:3, or 25%. Using the lowest estimate of Vietnamese military deaths, 400,000, the ratio is about 1:1.

==Chechen wars==
During the [[First Chechen War]], 4,000 separatist fighters and 40,000 civilians are estimated to have died, giving a civilian-combatant ratio of 10:1. The numbers for the [[Second Chechen War]] are 3,000 fighters and 13,000 civilians, for a ratio of 43:10. The combined ratio for both wars is 76:10. Casualty numbers for the conflict are notoriously unreliable. The estimates of the civilian casualties during the First Chechen war range from 20,000 to 100,000, with remaining numbers being similarly unreliable.<ref>{{cite book | first = Christoph | last = Zürcher |author-link=Christoph Zuercher| title = The post-Soviet wars: rebellion, ethnic conflict, and nationhood in the Caucasus | page = 100 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C0DTtKEktdEC| isbn = 9780814797099 | date = November 2007 }}</ref> The tactics employed by Russian forces in both wars were heavily criticized by human rights groups, which accused them of indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilian areas and other crimes.<ref name=hrw1996>[https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1996/WR96/Helsinki-16.htm "Russian Federation - Human Rights Developments"], [[Human Rights Watch]] report, 1996.</ref><ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/web/ar2001.nsf/webeurcountries/RUSSIAN+Federation?OpenDocument Russian Federation 2001 Report]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114184928/http://www.web.amnesty.org/web/ar2001.nsf/webeurcountries/RUSSIAN%2BFEDERATION?OpenDocument |date=November 14, 2007 }} [[Amnesty International]]</ref>

==NATO in Yugoslavia==
{{see also|Civilian casualties during Operation Allied Force}}

In 1999, [[NATO]] intervened in the [[Kosovo War]] with a bombing campaign against Yugoslav forces, who were alleged to be conducting a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]]. The bombing lasted about 2½ months, until forcing the withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from Kosovo.

Estimates for the number of casualties caused by the bombing vary widely depending on the source. NATO unofficially claimed a toll of 5,000 enemy combatants killed by the bombardment; the Yugoslav government, on the other hand, gave a figure of 638 of its security forces killed in Kosovo.<ref name=larson_p71>Larson, p. 71.</ref> Estimates for the civilian toll are similarly disparate. [[Human Rights Watch]] counted approximately 500 civilians killed by the bombing; the Yugoslav government estimated between 1,200 and 5,000.<ref name=larson_p65>Larson, p. 65.</ref>

If the NATO figures are to be believed, the bombings achieved a civilian to combatant kill ratio of about 1:10, on the Yugoslav government's figures, conversely, the ratio would be between 4:1 and 10:1. If the most conservative estimates from the sources cited above are used, the ratio was around 1:1.

According to military historian and Israeli Ambassador to the United States [[Michael Oren]], for every [[Serbia]]n soldier killed by [[NATO]] in 1999 (the period in which [[Operation Allied Force]] took place), four civilians died, a civilian to combatant casualty ratio of 4:1. Oren cites this figure as evidence that "even the most moral army can make mistakes, especially in dense urban warfare".<ref>Michael Oren, [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/09/24/un_report_a_victory_for_terror/ UN report a victory for terror], Boston Globe 24-09-2009</ref>

==Afghanistan War==
{{see also|Civilian casualties in the war in Afghanistan (2001–present)}}
According to the Watson Institute for International & Public Affairs, as of January 2015 roughly 92,000 people had been killed in the Afghanistan war, of which over 26,000 were civilians, for a civilian to combatant ratio of 0.4:1.<ref>[http://costsofwar.org/article/afghan-civilians "Afghan Civilians | Costs of War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616010655/http://costsofwar.org/article/afghan-civilians |date=2013-06-16 }}</ref>

==Iraq War==
{{see also|Casualties of the Iraq War}}
According to a 2010 assessment by John Sloboda of [[Iraq Body Count]], a United Kingdom-based organization, American and Coalition forces had killed at least 28,736 combatants as well as 13,807 civilians in the [[Iraq War]], indicating a civilian to combatant casualty ratio inflicted by coalition forces of 1:2.<ref name=katz>{{cite news |first=Yaakov |last=Katz |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?ID=193196&R=R1 |title=Analysis: Lies, leaks, death tolls & statistics |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=2010-10-29}}</ref> However, overall, figures by the [[Iraq Body Count]] from 20 March 2003 to 14 March 2013 indicate that of 174,000 casualties only 39,900 were combatants, resulting in a civilian casualty rate of 77%.<ref>{{cite web|title=The War in Iraq: 10 years and counting|url=https://www.iraqbodycount.org/analysis/numbers/ten-years/|website=Iraq Body Count|access-date=13 July 2014}}</ref>

==US drone strikes in Pakistan==
{{main|Drone attacks in Pakistan#Civilian casualties}}
The civilian casualty ratio for [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan]] is notoriously difficult to quantify. The U.S. itself puts the number of civilians killed from drone strikes in the last two years at no more than 20 to 30, a total that is far too low according to a spokesman for the [[NGO]] [[Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict|CIVIC]].<ref name=mcclatchy_10dec2010>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/12/10/105104/pakistanis-protest-civilian-deaths.html "Pakistanis protest civilian deaths in U.S. drone attacks"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212135429/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/12/10/105104/pakistanis-protest-civilian-deaths.html |date=2010-12-12 }}, Saeed Shah, mcclatchy.com, 2010-12-10.</ref> At the other extreme, Daniel L. Byman of the [[Brookings Institution]] suggests that drone strikes may kill "10 or so civilians" for every militant killed, which would represent a civilian to combatant casualty ratio of 10:1. Byman argues that civilian killings constitute a humanitarian tragedy and create dangerous political problems, including damage to the legitimacy of the Pakistani government and alienation of the Pakistani populace from America.<ref>Daniel L. Byman, [http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2009/07/14-targeted-killings-byman Do Targeted Killings Work?], Brookings 14-07-2009</ref> An ongoing study by the [[New America Foundation]] finds non-militant casualty rates started high but have declined steeply over time, from about 60% (3 out of 5) in 2004–2007 to less than 2% (1 out of 50) in 2012. The study puts the overall non-militant casualty rate since 2004 at 15–16%, or a 1:5 ratio, out of a total of between 1,908 and 3,225 people killed in Pakistan by drone strikes since 2004.<ref>[http://counterterrorism.newamerica.net/drones "The Year of the Drone: An Analysis of U.S. Drone Strikes in Pakistan, 2004-2012"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830213657/http://counterterrorism.newamerica.net/drones |date=August 30, 2011 }}, New America Foundation.

==Israeli–Palestinian conflict==
Estimates of civilian casualties from the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] differ. A 2007 report by the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)]] found that, from the beginning of the second intifada in September 2000 until the end of July 2007, at least 5,848 people were killed in the conflict, over half of whom were civilians. Amongst those killed in that period, 69% of Israelis were civilians, while the report estimated 59% of Palestinian casualties were civilians.<ref name="Ocha report">{{cite web|title=Israeli-Palestinian Fatalities Since 2000 - Key Trends|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/BE07C80CDA4579468525734800500272|publisher=[[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]]|access-date=2 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=statspage>[http://212.150.54.123/casualties_project/stats_page.cfm "ICT Middleastern Conflict Statistics Project"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703000000/http://212.150.54.123/casualties_project/stats_page.cfm |date=July 3, 2007 }}.

in May 2012 B'Tselem decided to stop addressing the question of participation in combat, with respect to Palestinians killed in the West Bank, stating that, "while in the past there were complicated incidents in the West Bank that might have met the definition of "combat incidents," in recent years the incidents meeting that definition have been almost nil."<ref name=BTselem_explanation /> B'Tselem does not address or count the number of Israelis killed or maimed by Palestinians or Palestinian forces. B'Tselem has also established a separate category for recording Palestinian police officers killed by Israel; according to B'Tselem, Israel counts the Gaza police force as a non-civilian when calculating the civilian casualty ratio, and states that such a definition is not compatible with the ICRC interpretation of international law.<ref name=BTselem_explanation>B'Tselem, [http://www.btselem.org/statistics/casualties_clarifications ''Explanation of statistics on fatalities''].

===Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip===
The head of the [[Shin Bet]] reported to the Israeli Cabinet that of the 810 Palestinians killed in Gaza in 2006 and 2007, 200 were civilians (a ratio of approximately 1:3). ''[[Haaretz]]'' assessed this to be an underestimation of civilian casualties. Using figures from Israeli human rights organisation [[B'Tselem]], they calculated that 816 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza during the two-year period, 360 of whom were civilians.<ref name=HzBR>{{cite news|title=Haaretz probe: Shin Bet count of Gaza civilian deaths is too low

He attributed this to an [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF) practice of attacking militants even when they had deliberately located themselves in densely populated areas. The ratio improved to 1:28 ratio in late 2005, meaning one civilian killed for every 28 combatants. It lowered, however, to 1:10 in 2006. In 2007, the ratio was at its lowest ever, more than 1:30.<ref name=Harel_pinpoint>[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/pinpoint-attacks-on-gaza-more-precise-1.236163 "Pinpoint attacks on Gaza more precise"].

Journalist Yaakov Katz states in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' that the ratio is 1:3 according to the Israeli figures and 60% civilians (3:2) according to B'Tselem's figures. Katz describes the IDF's civilian casualty ratio in the Gaza War and in the year preceding it as low.<ref name=katz/>

Katz says that over 81 percent of the 5,000 missiles the IDF dropped in the Gaza Strip during the operation were [[smart bombs]], a percentage which he states is unprecedented in modern warfare.<ref name=katz/> Journalist and commentator Evelyn Gordon writes in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' that the civilian casualty ratio in the 2008–09 Gaza War was 39 percent (2:3), using however only the preliminary Israeli estimates, but that 56 or 74 percent were civilians according to B'Tselem's figures, depending on whether 248 Hamas policemen are considered combatants or civilians; and 65 or 83 percent according to the figures of the [[Palestinian Centre for Human Rights]]. Gordon says that all of these ratios, even if the worse were correct, are lower than the normal civilian-to-combatant wartime fatality ratio in wars elsewhere, as given by the Red Cross, and states that the comparison shows that the IDF was unusually successful at minimizing civilian casualties.<ref>{{cite web |first=Evelyn |last=Gordon |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/evelyn-gordon/377631 |title=WikiLeaks and the Gaza War |work=Commentary |date=2010-10-25}}</ref>

13 Israelis were killed during the conflict, including 10 IDF soldiers (4 killed by [[friendly fire]]),<ref name=btselem /> giving a civilian casualty ratio for Palestinian forces of 24% or 3:10.

==1982 Lebanon War==
In 1982, [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel invaded Lebanon]] with the stated aim of driving the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]] away from its northern borders.<ref name=" Sorenson">{{cite book|last= Sorenson|first=David S. |title=Global Security Watch--Lebanon: A Reference Handbook|year=2010|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-0-313-36578-2|pages=22–23}}</ref>  The war culminated in a seven-week-long Israeli naval, air and artillery bombardment of Lebanon's capital, [[Beirut]], where the PLO had retreated. The bombardment eventually came to an end with an internationally brokered settlement in which the PLO forces were given safe passage to evacuate the country.<ref name=hartley_pp91-92>Hartley ''et all'', pp. 91-92.</ref>

According to the [[International Red Cross]], by the end of the first week of the war alone, some 10,000 people, including 2,000 combatants, had been killed, and 16,000 wounded—a civilian-combatant fatality ratio of 5:1.<ref name=layoun_p134>Layoun ''et al'', p. 134.</ref> Lebanese government sources later estimated that by the end of the siege of Beirut, a total of about 18,000 had been killed, an estimated 85% of whom were civilians.<ref>Washington Post, November 16, 1984</ref><ref name="The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon">{{cite journal|title=The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon: the casualties |doi=10.1177/030639688302400404 |date=1983-04-01 |volume=24 |issue=4 |journal=Race & Class |pages=340–343}}</ref> This gives a civilian to military casualty ratio of about 6:1.

According to Richard A. Gabriel between 1,000 and 3,000 civilians were killed in the southern campaign.<ref name=Gabriel>Gabriel, Richard , A, ''Operation Peace for Galilee, The Israeli-PLO War in Lebanon'', New York: Hill & Wang. 1984, p. 164, 165, {{ISBN|0-8090-7454-0}}</ref> He states that an additional 4,000 to 5,000 civilians died from all actions of all sides during the siege of Beirut,<ref name=Gabriel/> and that some 2,000 Syrian soldiers were killed during the Lebanon campaign and a further 2,400 PLO guerillas were also killed.<ref name=Gabriel/> Of these, 1,000 PLO guerrillas were killed during the siege.<ref name=Gabriel/> According to Gabriel the ratio of civilian deaths to combatants during the siege was about 6 to 1 but this ratio includes civilian deaths from all actions of all sides.<ref name=Gabriel/>
