'''Edible art''' refers to food created to be art. It is distinguished from [[Edible Arrangements]] (which predominantly consist of fruit) because it is usually more elaborate [[dessert]] food. A common form of edible art is [[wedding]] cakes, but options for artistic confections range far beyond marital celebrations. Cakes made into art include [[birthday]] cakes, cakes for [[baby showers]], for [[graduation]] celebrations, and many other types of event.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.swipely.com/blog/marketing-cakes-how-bakeries-can-promoting-custom-cake-designs-even-better/|title=Marketing Cakes: How Bakeries Can Promote Custom Cake Designs Even Better|website=Swipely.com|date=2012-03-09|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref> Each piece looks unique, even if created for the same event, because each creator has their own idea in mind when creating their food art. Such pieces of art can be created using a cake base onto which the decorations are placed on, or they can be made purely out of fondant or sugar, while edible, is not created with consumption intended, such as Mexican [[Calavera]]

== As an art ==
Each [[graphic art]]ist has their own set of skills in creating their work, but there are several basic starting points for edible dessert art. Most edible art franchises have [[Sheet cake|sheet cakes]], cut-out sheet cakes, [[Layer cake|layered cakes]], sculpted cakes, and tiered cakes to choose from as a foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://confectionarychalet.com/docs/?page_id=146|title=History of Cake Decorating|author=Flinn, Christine|website=ConfectionaryChalet.com|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref> One common technique is to [[airbrush]] the piece with [[sugar]] to enhance its features. Many artists in this field have a degree in [[fine arts]],{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} and participate in [[freelance]] decorating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://learningpath.org/articles/Becoming_a_Cake_Artist_Job_Description_Salary_Information.html|title= Becoming a Cake Artist: Job Description & Salary Information|website=LearningPath.org|accessdate=11 September 2015}}</ref>
