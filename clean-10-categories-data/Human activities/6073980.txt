'''Fermentation in food processing''' is the process of converting [[carbohydrate]]s to [[alcohol]] or organic acids using [[microorganisms]]—[[yeast]]s or [[bacteria]]—under [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] conditions. [[Fermentation]] usually implies that the action of microorganisms is desired. The science of fermentation is known as [[zymology]] or zymurgy.

The term fermentation sometimes refers specifically to the chemical conversion of [[sugar]]s into [[ethanol]], producing alcoholic drinks such as [[wine]], [[beer]], and [[cider]]. However, similar processes take place in the [[leavening]] of [[bread]] (CO<sub>2</sub> produced by yeast activity), and in the preservation of sour foods with the production of [[lactic acid]], such as in  [[sauerkraut]] and [[yogurt]].

Other widely consumed fermented foods include [[vinegar]], [[olives]], and [[cheese]]. More localised foods prepared by fermentation may also be based on beans, grain, vegetables, fruit, honey, dairy products, and fish.

Natural fermentation precedes human history. Since ancient times, humans have exploited the fermentation process. The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation is 13,000-year-old residues of a beer, with the consistency of gruel, found in a cave near [[Haifa]] in Israel.<ref>{{cite web |title='World's oldest brewery' found in cave in Israel, say researchers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-45534133 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=15 September 2018 |date=15 September 2018}}</ref> Another early alcoholic drink, made from fruit, rice, and honey, dates from 7000-6600 BC, in the [[Neolithic China|Neolithic Chinese]] village of [[Jiahu]],<ref name="mcgovern">{{Cite journal | last1=McGovern | first1=P.

The French chemist [[Louis Pasteur]] founded [[zymology]], when in 1856 he connected yeast to fermentation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fermentation |url=http://www.coe.uga.edu/ttie/documents/biotech.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530081705/http://www.coe.uga.edu/ttie/documents/biotech.pdf |archive-date=2012-05-30 }}</ref>
When studying the fermentation of sugar to [[alcohol]] by [[yeast]], Pasteur concluded that the fermentation was catalyzed by a vital force, called "[[Vitalism|ferments]]", within the yeast cells.  The "ferments" were thought to function only within living organisms.  "Alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells, not with the death or putrefaction of the cells",<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dubos, J. |year= 1951 |title= Louis Pasteur: Free Lance of Science, Gollancz.

Nevertheless, it was known that yeast extracts can ferment sugar even in the absence of living yeast cells. While studying this process in 1897, the German chemist and zymologist [[Eduard Buchner]] of [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], [[Germany]], found that sugar was fermented even when there were no living yeast cells in the mixture,<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1907/buchner-bio.html Nobel Laureate Biography of Eduard Buchner at http://nobelprize.org]</ref> by an enzyme complex secreted by yeast that he termed ''[[zymase]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1929/press.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1929|access-date=2007-01-28}}</ref>  In 1907 he received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his research and discovery of "cell-free fermentation".

One year earlier, in 1906, [[ethanol fermentation]] studies led to the early discovery of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD<sup>+</sup>]].<ref>{{cite journal | first=A. | last=Harden |author2=Young, W.J. | title=The Alcoholic Ferment of Yeast-Juice | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London | edition=Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character | volume=78 |date=October 1906 | pages=369–375 | issue=526| doi=10.1098/rspb.1906.0070 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

[[File:Beer and bread.jpg|thumb|Beer and bread, two major uses of fermentation in food]]

Food fermentation is the conversion of sugars and other [[carbohydrate]]s into [[alcohol]] or preservative [[organic acid]]s and [[carbon dioxide]]. All three products have found human uses. The production of alcohol is made use of when fruit [[juice]]s are converted to [[wine]], when grains are made into [[beer]], and when foods rich in starch, such as [[potato]]es, are fermented and then distilled to make spirits such as [[gin]] and [[vodka]]. The production of [[carbon dioxide]] is used to [[leavening agent|leaven]] bread. The production of organic acids is exploited to preserve and flavor vegetables and dairy products.<ref name="HuiMeunier-Goddik2004">{{cite book  |vauthors=Hui YH, Meunier-Goddik L, Josephsen J, Nip WK, Stanfield PS |title=Handbook of Food and Beverage Fermentation Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PC_O7u1NPZEC&pg=PA27 |year=2004 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-5122-7 |pages=27 and passim}}</ref>

Food fermentation serves five main purposes: to enrich the diet through development of a diversity of flavors, aromas, and textures in food substrates; to preserve substantial amounts of food through [[lactic acid]], [[alcohol]], [[acetic acid]], and [[alkaline]] fermentations; to enrich food substrates with protein, [[essential amino acids]], and vitamins; to eliminate [[antinutrients]]; and to reduce cooking time and the associated use of fuel.<ref name=Steinkraus>{{cite book |editor=Steinkraus, K.H. |date=1995 |title=Handbook of Indigenous Fermented Foods |publisher=Marcel Dekker}}</ref>

==Risks==
[[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilization]] is an important factor to consider during the fermentation of foods. Failing to completely remove any [[Microorganism|microbes]] from equipment and storing vessels may result in the multiplication of harmful organisms within the ferment, potentially increasing the risks of food borne illnesses like botulism.  The production of off smells and discoloration may be indications that harmful bacteria may have been introduced to the food.

[[Alaska]] has witnessed a steady increase of cases of [[botulism]] since 1985.<ref name="Alaska">{{cite web |url=http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/phtn/botulism/alaska/alaska.asp |title=Why does Alaska have more botulism |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. federal agency) |access-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060807175105/http://www.phppo.cdc.gov/phtn/botulism/alaska/alaska.asp |archive-date=7 August 2006 }}</ref> It has more cases of botulism than any other state in the United States of America. This is caused by the traditional [[Eskimo]] practice of allowing animal products such as whole fish, fish heads, [[walrus]], [[sea lion]], and [[whale]] flippers, [[beaver]] tails, seal oil, and birds, to ferment for an extended period of time before being consumed. The risk is exacerbated when a [[plastic container]] is used for this purpose instead of the old-fashioned, traditional method, a grass-lined hole, as the ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' bacteria thrive in the anaerobic conditions created by the air-tight enclosure in plastic.<ref name="Alaska" />

The [[World Health Organization]] has classified pickled foods as possibly [[carcinogen]]ic, based on epidemiological studies.<ref name="IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans">{{cite web |url=http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/ClassificationsAlphaOrder.pdf |title=Agents Classified by the IARC Monographs, Volumes 1–105 |publisher=International Agency for Research on Cancer (United Nations World Health Organization agency) |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> Other research found that fermented food contains a carcinogenic by-product, [[Ethyl carbamate|ethyl carbamate (urethane)]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/03/070307152917.htm |title=New Link Between Wine, Fermented Food And Cancer |publisher=ScienceDaily |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref> "A 2009 review of the existing studies conducted across Asia concluded that regularly eating pickled vegetables roughly doubles a person's risk for [[Esophageal cancer|esophageal squamous cell carcinoma]]."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/06/the_who_says_cellphonesand_picklesmay_cause_cancer.html |title=The WHO Says Cellphones—and Pickles—May Cause Cancer |publisher=Slate |access-date=10 October 2012}}</ref>
