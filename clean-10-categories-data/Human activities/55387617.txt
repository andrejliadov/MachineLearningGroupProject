'''Child Friendly Spaces''' ('''CFS''') are [[Safety|safe]] spaces set up in [[emergency]] settings to help support and protect [[child]]ren. Their objective is to restore a sense of normality and continuity to children whose lives have been disrupted by [[war]], [[natural disaster]], or other emergencies.<ref name=":1" /> They provide children with opportunities to [[Child development|develop]], [[Play (activity)|play]], [[Learning|learn]], and strengthen [[Psychological resilience|resiliency]] either after a [[crisis]] or during a protracted emergency in a safe, [[Age appropriateness|child friendly]], and stimulating environment.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/system/files/documents/files/CFS%20Literature%20Review%20final%20Aug%202012.pdf|title=Child Friendly Spaces: A Structured Review of the Current Evidence-Base|last=World Vision|date=August 2012|access-date=September 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012002/https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/system/files/documents/files/CFS%20Literature%20Review%20final%20Aug%202012.pdf|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] or [[government]]s design and operate CFS in a participatory manner, often relying on community support.

CFS give children an opportunity to escape the crowded living conditions they may be subject to during crises. As they are supervised, they also provide parents child-free time that can be necessary for fetching water, earning a living, or other activities. Given that [[Psychological stress|stress]] levels and incidents of [[Child abuse|abuse]] rise during emergencies, providing children with this space and parents with time can mitigate risks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/child-friendly-spaces/|title=In troubled countries, 'child-friendly spaces' offer some relief|work=PBS NewsHour|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en-US}}</ref> CFC can be adapted to support young children or [[Adolescence|adolescents]], who are often neglected in emergencies.<ref name=":2" />

== Background ==
CFS have been used widely since 1999.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/protection/A_Practical_Guide_to_Developing_Child_Friendly_Spaces_-_UNICEF_(1).pdf|title=A Practical Guide for Developing Child Friendly Spaces|last=UNICEF|access-date=September 27, 2017}}</ref> They began as a rights-based approach developed by [[UNICEF]] to guarantee children's rights to survival, development, participation and protection, especially at times of crisis or instability. UNICEF launched the first CFC during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo crisis]] in [[Albania]] in April 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/FA1830A25B25810BC125757F0037FA8E-UNICEF_dec04.pdf|title=Child Friendly Spaces/Environments (CFS/E): An Integrated Services Response For Emergencies and Their Aftermath|last=UNICEF|date=2004|access-date=September 29, 2017}}</ref> Subsequently, CFS were used in the camps for the survivors of a [[1999 Düzce earthquake|1999 earthquake in Turkey]].<ref name=":2" /> They then became a common part of the [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian response]] and have since been used in [[Angola]], [[Chad]], [[Colombia]], [[Denmark]], [[East Timor]], [[El Salvador]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Russia]], [[Palestinian territories|Occupied Palestinian Territories]], [[Pakistan]], [[Paraguay]], [[Philippines]], [[Serbia]], [[Somalia]], [[Spain]], [[Syria]], [[Tanzania]], [[Turkey]], and [[Uganda]], among other countries.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.caritas.org/2014/03/providing-child-friendly-spaces-syrian-refugee-children-turkey/|title=Providing child-friendly spaces for Syrian refugee children in Turkey - Caritas|date=2014-03-04|work=Caritas|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://savethechildreninternational.exposure.co/children-on-the-move-in-europe|title=Save the Children - Children on the Move in Europe|website=Exposure|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206003626/https://savethechildreninternational.exposure.co/children-on-the-move-in-europe|archive-date=2017-12-06|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://plan-international.org/publications/child-friendly-spaces-provding-protection-and-education-mali|title=Child friendly spaces: Provding protection and education in Mali|work=Plan International|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/echo/field-blogs/photos/child-friendly-spaces-burundian-refugees-tanzania_fr|title=Child-friendly spaces for Burundian Refugees in Tanzania - Protection Civile et Operations d'Aide Humanitaire Européennes - European Commission|website=Protection Civile et Operations d'Aide Humanitaire Européennes|language=fr|access-date=2017-09-30}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Evaluation%20of%20CFS_Final%20Research%20Report_0.pdf|title=Evaluation of Child Friendly Spaces: An inter-agency series of impact evaluations in humanitarian emergencies|last=World Vision International|date=2015|access-date=September 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://plan-international.org/paraguay/child-friendly-spaces-el-nino-floods|title=Child-Friendly Spaces for Children Affected by Floods|work=Plan International|access-date=2017-09-30|language=en}}</ref>

== Activities ==
CFC are integrated programs that provide children with access to a range of services or activities that may vary by context. These include structured recreational opportunities, [[Pre-school playgroup|play groups]], [[peer support]] services, and remedial classes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcoo.com/pt/projects/emergency-relief-child-friendly-spaces/|title=Emergency Relief: Child friendly spaces|website=www.worldcoo.com|language=pt|access-date=2017-09-30}}</ref> Some programs involve [[Religion|religious]] and spiritual activities.<ref name=":2" />

== Effectiveness ==
[[World Vision International|World Vision]] and [[Columbia University]], along with [[Save the Children]], UNICEF and others, engaged in a three-year collaborative project to document the outcomes and impacts of CFS.<ref name=":3" />  They found that CFS can benefit children, but the extent of their impact varies widely. In many contexts, CFS provide a foundation for positive impact on children's lives, but their impact is small. They also found that younger children tended to attend the CFS more and show greater impact. There have not been [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] to evaluate the long-term effects of CFS interventions on children.<ref name=":3" />
