The notion of '''affective design''' emerged from the field of [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI)<ref>Norman, D. A. (1986). Design principles for human-computer interfaces. In D. E. Berger, K. Pezdek, & W. P. Banks (Eds.). Applications of cognitive psychology: Problem solving, education, and computing. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.</ref> and more specifically from the developing area of [[affective computing]].<ref name = 'picard'>Reynolds, C. and Picard, R. (2001) Designing for Affective Interactions. In Proceedings of 9th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, 5–10 August 2001, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. [online], available: http://vismod.media.mit.edu/pub/tech-reports/TR-541.pdf</ref> Affective design involves designing interfaces to enable human-computer interactions where emotional information is communicated by the user in a natural and comfortable way - the computer processes the emotional information and may adapt or respond to try to improve the interaction in some way.<ref name = 'picard' /> Affective design, along with the traditional HCI usability and accessibility, constitutes the important qualities of [[user experience]] (UX) as it contributes in the improvement of the user's personal condition in relation with the computing system.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Universal Access in Human-Computer Interaction: Design Methods, Tools, and Interaction Techniques for e-Inclusion|last=Stephanidis|first=Constantine|last2=Margherita|first2=Antona|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9783642391873|location=Dordrecht|pages=567}}</ref> 

The [[ambient intelligence]] is one of the technologies where affective design is applied. These electronic environments address human emotional responses and aspirations to create an aesthetic appreciation and pleasurable experience by enhancing human-product-ambience interactions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constructing Ambient Intelligence|last=Mühlhäuser|first=Max|last2=Ferscha|first2=Alois|last3=Aitenbichler|first3=Erwin|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2008|isbn=3540853782|location=Berlin|pages=301}}</ref>

==Aims==
Affective computing aims to deliver affective interfaces<ref name = 'picard' /> capable of eliciting certain [[Emotions|emotional experiences]] from users.<ref>McCarthy, J. and Wright, P. (2004). What is enjoyment doing to HCI? In ECCE'12: Proceedings of the 11th European Conference on Cognitive. European Association of Cognitive Ergonomics, Le Chesney, France.  pp.&nbsp;11–12</ref> Similarly, affective design attempts to define the subjective emotional relationships between consumers and [[Product (business)|products]] and to explore the affective properties that products intend to communicate through their physical attributes.<ref>Carliner, S. (2000) "Physical, Cognitive, and Affective: A Three-Part Framework for Information Design” [online], available: https://web.archive.org/web/20061231230832/http://saulcarliner.home.att.net/id/newmodel.htm [accessed 10 January 2007]</ref> It aims to deliver [[Virtual artifact|artefacts]] capable of eliciting maximum [[physio-psychological]] pleasure consumers may obtain through all of their [[senses]].

The key challenge for affective design involves the accurate understanding of the user's affective needs and, subsequently, the design of products that would address those needs.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Human-Computer Interaction: Users and Applications: 14th International Conference, HCI International 2011, Orlando, FL, USA, July 9-14, 2011, Proceedings, Part 4|last=Jacko|first=Julie|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=9783642216183|location=Heidelberg|pages=257}}</ref> Current research focuses on the measurement and analysis of human interactions towards affective design and the assessment of the corresponding affective design features.<ref name=":0" />
