An important part of communicating in a bias-free manner is by making sure you are engaging in meaningful conversations, using bias-free language. The writer's word choice is vital in terms of effectively communicating in ways that do not offend the receiver. According to Locker, "Bias-free language is language that is sensitive to people's sex, race, age, physical condition and many other categories. Bias-free language does not discriminate and therefore includes all readers in a fair and friendly manner."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/CC3BFEEB-C364-E1A1-A5390F221AC0FD2D/bias-free_language.pdf|title=Bias-free Language}}</ref>
