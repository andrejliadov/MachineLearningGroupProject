The '''Sacco chair''', also called '''bean bag chair''', is a large fabric bag, filled with [[polystyrene]] beans, designed by [[Piero Gatti]], [[Cesare Paolini]] and [[Franco Teodoro]]. The product is an example of an anatomic chair,<ref name="Vitra Design Museum">{{cite web|last=Vitra Design Museum|title=Sacco|url=http://www.design-museum.de/en/collection/100-masterpieces/detailseiten/sacco-gatti-paolini-teodoro.html|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref> as the shape of the object is set by the user.

== History ==
Sacco was introduced in 1968 by three Italian designers: [[Piero Gatti]], [[Cesare Paolini]] and [[Franco Teodoro]].<ref name="Vitra Design Museum"/> The object was created in the Italian Modernism movement.<ref>{{Cite web|last=MOMA|first=Museum of Modern Art, New York|date=|title=Object lesson: Paola Antonelli|url=https://www.christies.com/features/Object_lesson_Paolo_Antonelli-5621-1.aspx|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-17|website=Museum of Modern Art, New York|language=en-US}}</ref> Being a post war era phenomenon, Italian modernism’s design was highly inspired with new available technology. Post war technology allowed an increase in the processes of production, by introducing new materials such as polystyrene. The idea of mass-produced goods made within an inexpensive price range appealed to consumers. It therefore created the need for a revolution in the creative and manufacturing process. ‘The designer was an integral member of a process that included marketing as well as engineering’. The inspiration left by Corradino D’Ascano’s [[Vespa]] design for the [[Piaggio]] Corporation in 1946, added value to the essence of the designer. With successful designs, brands could sell more products, and therefore the identity of the designer played an important advertising role. Another important figure of the Italian modernism period was [[Gio Ponti]]. Inspired by modernism's art movements, Ponti created new forms of objects. His asymmetrically balanced designs freed the Italian objects form their classic representations. The designer promoted Italian designs on famous exhibitions called 'Milan [[Triennale]]': "These exhibitions, organized as early as the 1920s … were responsible for increasing the visibility of Italian design in an international setting". After becoming an editor of the [[Domus (magazine)]] in 1947, Ponti contributed to not only Italian design of that time, but also : “the human and creative element in modern industrial design as well as its practical, economic and social benefits."<ref name=Raizman>{{cite book |last=Raizman |first=David |editor-last=May |editor-first=Susie |title=History of Modern Design Second Edition |publisher=Laurence King Publishing |date=2010 |pages=256–306 |chapter=Part V: Humanism and Luxury: International Modernism and Mass Culture after World War II (1945-1960) |isbn=978-1-85669-694-4}}</ref>
[[File:Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro, authors of Sacco.jpg|thumb|320x320px|Pietro Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro, authors of Sacco]]
Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro, inspired by their designer predecessors, came up in 1968 with the design of Sacco the ‘shapeless chair’.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ma.as/78800|title='Sacco' beanbag designed by Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro|last=|first=|date=|website=Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences, Australia|access-date=}}</ref> Although it was not the first design of an amorphous chair in Italian history, Sacco was the first successful product created in partnership with [[Zanotta (company)|Zanotta]]. The predecessor of the product had a major design flaw of not being able to sustain its form and therefore never reached production. Sacco picked up that flaw and with the use of leather for exterior and right placed stitching. It is worth mentioning that the use of leather was not coincidental as at that time the textile was an Italian national pride product.<ref name=Raizman/> The target user of the chair was the lax, hippie community and their non-conformist household. "In an era characterized by the hippie culture, apartment sharing and student demonstrations, the thirty-something designers created a nonpoltrona (non-chair) and thus launched an attack on good bourgeois taste."<ref name="Vitra Design Museum"/>

Sacco is part of the permanent collection of the most important museums of contemporary art throughout the world, such as the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, the [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London. Sacco was part of the 1972 exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York ''Italy: The New Domestic Landscape - Achievements and Problems of Italian Design''<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Italy: The New Domestic Landscape|url=https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1783|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-17|website=MOMA, Museum of Modern Art, New York}}</ref> and was awarded, in 1973, the BIO 5 at the [[Biennale of Design]] in Ljubljana. In 2020 Sacco received the prestigious [[Compasso d'Oro|Compasso d'Oro Award]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The winners of the 2020 Compasso d'Oro Awards |url=https://www.domusweb.it/en/design/gallery/2020/09/09/the-winners-of-the-compasso-doro-awards.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-11-17|website=Domus}}</ref>      

Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro established their architecture firm in [[Turin]] in 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collection.maas.museum/object/78800|title="'Sacco' beanbag designed by Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro".|last=|first=|date=|website=Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences, Australia.|access-date=}}</ref>

== Sacco in the media ==

Sacco often appears in the strips [[Peanuts]] by [[Charles M. Schulz]].    

==Other bean bag chair products inspired by Sacco==
Other designers have followed the "shapeless" chair design, creating a range of inspired products that take after Sacco.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/02/beanbag-chair-make-your-own# | title=How to bag a beanbag chair | work=The Guardian | date=2 June 2009 | accessdate=10 January 2014 | author=Griffiths, Sally}}</ref> Amongst many, the most successful contemporary model would be [[Jukka Setala]]’s Fatboy. The product launched in 2002 brought the Finnish designer global recognition. The new form of the bean bag chair has less stitching and a more geometrical take in the means of shape. It also has an [[Expanded polystyrene|EPS]] filling which is more durable than [[PVC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatboy.com/nl/bean-bags/original# |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910125932/https://www.fatboy.com/nl/bean-bags/original |url-status=dead |archive-date=2017-09-10 |title=Fatboy original |publisher=Fatboy |date=2002 |accessdate=16 October 2014 |author=Fatboy }}</ref>
