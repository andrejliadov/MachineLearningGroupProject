A '''black market''', '''underground economy''' or '''shadow economy''', is a [[Secrecy|clandestine]] [[Market (economics)|market]] or series of transactions that has some aspect of illegality or is characterized by some form of noncompliant behavior with an institutional set of rules. If the rule defines the set of goods and services whose production and distribution is prohibited by law, non-compliance with the rule constitutes a black market trade since the transaction itself is illegal. Parties engaging in the production or distribution of prohibited goods and services are members of the illegal economy. Examples include the drug trade, [[prostitution]] (where prohibited), illegal currency transactions and human trafficking.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Risky business: Harlem pimps’ work decisions and economic returns |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/A_Horning/publication/329875237_Risky_Business_Harlem_Pimps%27_Work_Decisions_and_Economic_Returns/links/5d01543c92851c874c62340d/Risky-Business-Harlem-Pimps-Work-Decisions-and-Economic-Returns.pdf|year=2019|author1=A.

Typically the totality of such activity is referred to with the definite article as a complement to the official economies, by market for such goods and services, e.g. "the black market in bush meat".

The black market is distinct from the [[grey market]], in which commodities are distributed through channels that, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer, and the [[white market]], in which trade is legal and official.

'''Black money''' is the proceeds of an illegal transaction, on which income and other [[Tax|taxes]] have not been paid, and which can only be legitimised by some form of [[money laundering]]. Because of the clandestine nature of the black economy it is not possible to determine its size and scope.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Black Money in India {{!}} LawJi |work=LawJi.in : one-stop destination for all law students |url=https://www.lawji.in/2018/09/black-money-in-india.html |url-status=dead |access-date=2018-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918160749/https://www.lawji.in/2018/09/black-money-in-india.html |archive-date=September 18, 2018}}</ref>

==Background==
[[File:Mercado Negro, La Paz, Bolivia.JPG|thumbnail|right|Mercado Negro, so called "Black Market", in [[La Paz]], Bolivia.]]

The literature on the black market has not established a common terminology and has instead offered many synonyms including: subterranean; hidden; [[Grey market|grey]]; shadow; informal; clandestine; illegal; unobserved; unreported; unrecorded; second; parallel and black.<ref name=Feige />

There is no single underground economy; there are many. These underground economies are omnipresent, existing in market oriented as well as in centrally planned nations, be they developed or developing. Those engaged in underground activities circumvent, escape or are excluded from the institutional system of rules, rights, regulations and enforcement penalties that govern formal agents engaged in production and exchange. Different types of underground activities are distinguished according to the particular institutional rules that they violate. Four major underground economies can be identified:<ref name=Feige /><ref name="Feige 2016">{{Cite journal |last=Feige |first=Edgar L. |date=2016 |title=The Meaning and Measurement of Unobserved Economies: What do we really know about the "Shadow Economy"? |journal=Journal of Tax Administration |issue=30/1}}</ref>

# the illegal economy
# the unreported economy
# the unrecorded economy
# the informal economy

The "illegal economy" consists of the income produced by those economic activities pursued in violation of legal statutes defining the scope of legitimate forms of commerce. Illegal economy participants engage in the production and distribution of prohibited [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]], such as [[drug trafficking]], [[arms trafficking]], and [[prostitution]].<ref name="Feige 2016" />

The "unreported economy" consists of those economic activities that circumvent or evade the institutionally established fiscal rules as codified in the tax code. A summary measure of the unreported economy is the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authority but is not so reported. A complementary measure of the unreported economy is the "[[tax gap]]", namely the difference between the amount of tax revenues due the fiscal authority and the amount of tax revenue actually collected. In the U.S. unreported income is estimated to be $2 trillion resulting in a "tax gap" of $450–$600 billion.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Feige, Edgar L. |last2=Cebula, Richard |date=January 2011 |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S. |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |access-date=2012-03-05 |name-list-style=amp}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Feige, Edgar L. |date=September 2009 |title=New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the "Tax Gap" |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html |access-date=2012-03-05}}</ref>

The "unrecorded economy" consists of those economic activities that circumvent the institutional rules that define the reporting requirements of government statistical agencies.<ref name="Feige 2016" /> A summary measure of the unrecorded economy is the amount of unrecorded income, namely the amount of income that should (under existing rules and conventions) be recorded in national accounting systems (e.g. [[National Income and Product Accounts]]) but is not. Unrecorded income is a particular problem in [[transition countries]] that switched from a [[Socialist economics|socialist]] accounting system to [[United Nations System of National Accounts|UN standard national accounting]]. New methods have been proposed for estimating the size of the unrecorded (non-observed) economy.<ref>OECD (2002) Measuring the Non-Observed Economy A Handbook, Paris France.</ref> But there is still little consensus concerning the size of the unreported economies of transition countries.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Feige |first=Edgar L. |last2=Urban |first2=Ivica |year=2008 |title=Measuring underground (unobserved, non-observed, unrecorded) economies in transition countries: Can we trust GDP? |journal=[[Journal of Comparative Economics]] |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=287–306 |citeseerx=10.1.1.519.8803 |doi=10.1016/j.jce.2008.02.003 |s2cid=53489014}}</ref>

The "[[informal economy]]" comprises those economic activities that circumvent the costs and are excluded from the benefits and rights incorporated in the laws and administrative rules covering property relationships, commercial licensing, labor contracts, torts, financial credit and social security systems.<ref name="Feige 2016" /> A summary measure of the informal economy is the income generated by economic agents that operate informally.<ref>De Soto, Hernando, ''The Other Path: The Invisible Revolution in the Third World''.

This is hidden from the state for tax, social security or labour law purposes but is legal in all other aspects.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Colin C.

==Pricing==
Goods and services acquired illegally and/or transacted for in an illegal manner may exchange above or below the price of legal market transactions:
* They may be cheaper than legal market prices. The [[Fence (criminal)|supplier]] does not have to pay for production costs and/or taxes. This is usually the case in the underground economy. Criminals steal goods and sell them below the legal market price, but there is no receipt, guarantee, and so forth. When someone is hired to perform work and the client is unable to write off the expense (particularly common for work such as [[home renovation]]s or [[Cosmetology|cosmetological]] services), the client may be inclined to request a lower price (usually paid in cash) in exchange for foregoing a receipt, which enables the service provider to avoid reporting the income on his or her tax return.
* They may be more expensive than legal market prices. For example, the product is difficult to acquire or produce, dangerous to handle, is strictly rationed, or not easily available legally if at all. If exchange of goods are made illegal by some sort of [[state (polity)|state]] sanction, such as is often seen with certain pharmaceutical drugs, their prices will tend to rise as a result of that sanction.

Even when the underground market offers lower prices, consumers still have an incentive to buy on the legal market when possible, because:
* They may prefer legal suppliers, as they are easier to contact and can be held accountable for faults;
* In some jurisdictions, such as the [[United States]], customers may be charged with a [[criminal offense]] if they knowingly participate in the black economy, even as a consumer;<ref>{{Cite web |date=2009-08-03 |title=Jury orders student to pay $675,000 for illegally downloading music |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=8226751&page=1 |access-date=24 May 2018 |website=ABCnews.com |publisher=ABC}}</ref>
* They may have a moral dislike of black marketing;
* In some jurisdictions (such as [[England]] and [[Wales]]), consumers found to be in possession of stolen goods will have them taken away if they are traced, even if they did not know they were stolen. Though they themselves will not usually face criminal prosecution, they are still left without the goods they paid for and with little if any recourse to get their money back. This risk may make some averse to buying goods that they think may be from the underground market, even if in fact they are legitimate (for example, items sold at a [[car boot sale]]).

However, in some limited situations, consumers conclude that they are actually better off using black market services, particularly when government regulations hinder what would otherwise be a legitimate competitive service. For example:
* Unlicensed [[taxicab]]s. In [[Baltimore]], it has been reported that many consumers actively prefer illegal taxis, citing that they are more available, convenient, and priced fairly.<ref name="Baltimore">{{Cite news |last=Christina Royster-Hemby |date=April 21, 2004 |title=Feature: A Baltimore Way of Life |work=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |url=http://www2.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=6264 |url-status=dead |access-date=2012-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214183721/http://www2.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=6264 |archive-date=February 14, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Traded goods and services==
Some examples of underground economic activities include:

===Sexual exploitation and forced labor===
{{Main|Human trafficking}}
[[Prostitution]] is illegal or highly regulated in many countries across the world. These places form a classic study of the underground economy, because of consistent high demand from customers, relatively high pay, but labor-intensive and low skilled work, which attracts a continual supply of workers. While prostitution exists in every country, studies show that it tends to flourish more in poorer countries, and in areas with large numbers of unattached men, such as around military bases.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Lena Edlund |last2=Evelyn Korn |year=2002 |title=A Theory of Prostitution |url=http://the-idea-shop.com/papers/prostitution.pdf |url-status=dead |publisher=Journal of Political Economy |volume=110 |issue=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005081326/http://www.the-idea-shop.com/papers/prostitution.pdf |archive-date=October 5, 2013 |access-date=2012-03-06 |name-list-style=amp}}</ref> For instance, an empirical study showed that the supply of prostitutes rose abruptly in Denver and Minneapolis in 2008 when the Democratic and Republican National Conventions took place there.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cunningham |first=S. |last2=Kendall |first2=T. D. |year=2011 |title=The Economic Returns to Good Looks and Risky Sex in the Bangladesh Commercial Sex Market |journal=The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy |volume=11 |doi=10.1515/1935-1682.3059 |s2cid=1230622}}</ref>

Prostitutes in the black market generally operate with some degree of secrecy, sometimes negotiating prices and activities through [[Code word (figure of speech)|codewords]] and subtle gestures. In countries such as [[Germany]] or the [[Netherlands]], where prostitution is legal but regulated, illegal prostitutes exist whose services are offered cheaper without regard for the legal requirements or procedures—health checks, standards of accommodation, and so on.

In other countries, such as [[Nicaragua]], where legal prostitution is regulated, hotels may require both parties to identify themselves, to prevent the rise of [[child prostitution]].

===Personal information===
[[Personally identifying information]], financial information like credit card and bank account information, and [[Medical data breach|medical data]] is bought and sold, mostly in [[darknet market]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Holt |first=Thomas J. |title=Data thieves in action : examining the international market for stolen personal information |last2=Smirnova |first2=Olga |last3=Chua |first3=Yi-Ting |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-137-58904-0}}</ref> People increase the value of the stolen data by aggregating it with publicly available data, and sell it again for a profit, increasing the damage that can be done to the people whose data was stolen.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rossi |first=Ben |date=8 July 2015 |title=The ripple effect of identity theft: What happens to my data once it's stolen? |work=Information Age |url=https://www.information-age.com/ripple-effect-identity-theft-what-happens-my-data-once-its-stolen-123459795/}}</ref>

===Illegal drugs===
[[File:Yellow Cannabis strain.jpg|thumb|left|In the U.S., [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] has been termed as a [[cash crop]].]]
{{Main|Illegal drug trade}}
From the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many countries began to ban the keeping or using of some [[recreational drug]]s, such as the United States' [[war on drugs]]. Many people nonetheless continue to use illegal drugs, and a black market exists to supply them. Despite law enforcement efforts to intercept them, demand remains high, providing a large [[profit motive]] for [[organized crime|organized criminal groups]] to keep drugs supplied. The United Nations has reported that the retail market value of illegal drugs is US$321.6 billion.<ref>{{Cite web |title=World Drug Report 2005 |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720100713/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |archive-date=2006-07-20 |access-date=2012-03-05 |website=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime}}</ref>

Although law enforcement agencies intercept a fraction of the illegal drugs, and incarcerate hundreds of thousands of wholesale and retail sellers, the very stable demand for such drugs and the high profit margins encourages new distributors to enter the market without a decrease in the retail price. Many [[drug legalization]] activists draw parallels between the illegal drug trade and the [[Prohibition]] of alcohol in the United States in the 1920s.

===Weapons===
{{Main|Arms trafficking}}
[[Image:Gun pyre in Uhuru Gardens, Nairobi.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A tower of confiscated smuggled weapons about to be incinerated in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]]]
The [[legislatures]] of many countries forbid or restrict the personal [[ownership]] of [[weapon]]s. These restrictions can range from small [[combat knife|knives]] to [[firearms]], either altogether or by classification (e.g. [[caliber]], [[handgun]]s, [[automatic weapon]]s, and [[explosives]]). The black market supplies the demands for weaponry that can not be obtained legally, or may only be obtained legally after obtaining permits and paying fees. This may be by [[smuggling]] the arms from countries where they were bought legally or stolen, or by stealing from arms manufacturers within the country itself, using [[insider]]s. In cases where the underground economy is unable to smuggle firearms, they can also satisfy requests by [[gunsmith]]ing their own firearms. Those who may buy this way include [[criminals]] to use for illegal activities, gun collectors, and otherwise law-abiding citizens interested in protecting their dwellings, families or businesses.

In England and Wales, certain categories of weapons used for hunting may be owned by qualified residents but must be registered with the local police force and kept within a locked cabinet. Another segment of the population who may purchase weapons on the black market are individuals who are unable to pass the legal requirements for registration—convicted felons or those suffering from mental illness for example. In a few jurisdictions, collectors may legally keep antique weapons made incapable of being readily restored to a firing condition.

===Illegally logged timber===
{{Main|Illegal logging}}
The illegal logging of [[timber]] has posed as an issue. According to [[Interpol]], the illegal logging industry is worth almost as much as drug production industry, in some countries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Illegal logging news |url=http://www.illegal-logging.info/item_single.php?it_id=7076&it=news |access-date=September 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Illegal logging industry worth almost as much as drug production industry |url=http://www.illegal-logging.info/approach.php?a_id=109 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702142928/http://www.illegal-logging.info/approach.php?a_id=109 |archive-date=July 2, 2013 |access-date=January 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Animals and animal products===
{{Main|Ivory trade|Wildlife trade}}
In many developing countries, living animals are captured in the wild and sold as pets. Wild animals are also hunted and killed for their [[Bushmeat|meat]], hide, and organs, the latter of which and other animal parts are sold for use in traditional medicine.

In several of the states within the [[United States]], laws requiring the pasteurization of milk has created black market situations involving the transport and sale of [[raw milk]], and sometimes raw milk cheese which is legal in a number of EU countries but banned in the US if aged less than 60 days<ref>{{Cite web |title=Inside the World of Black Market Cheese |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/black-market-cheese-america |website=vogue.com}}</ref>

===Alcohol===
{{Main|Rum-running}}
[[File:Raid at elk lake.jpg|thumb|Broken barrels of liquor after a police raid in 1925, in [[Elk Lake, Ontario]]]]

[[Rum-running]], or bootlegging, is the illegal business of transporting ([[smuggling]]) [[alcoholic beverage]]s where such transportation is forbidden by law. Smuggling is usually done to circumvent [[tax]]ation or [[prohibition]] laws within a particular jurisdiction. The term ''rum-running'' is more commonly applied to smuggling over water; ''bootlegging'' is applied to smuggling over land. According to the [[PBS]] documentary ''[[Prohibition (miniseries)|Prohibition]]'', the term "bootlegging" was popularized when thousands of city dwellers would sell liquor from flasks they kept in their boot leg all across major cities and rural areas.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Murphy |first=Mary |year=1994 |title=Bootlegging Mothers and Drinking Daughters: Gender and Prohibition in Butte Montana |journal=[[American Quarterly]] |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=174–194 |doi=10.2307/2713337 |jstor=2713337}}</ref><ref>[[Prohibition (miniseries)]], Episode 1, "A Nation of Drunkards". Directed by [[Ken Burns]] & [[Lynn Novick]]. Distributed by PBS.</ref> The term "rum-running" most likely originated at the start of [[Prohibition in the United States]] (1920–1933), when ships from [[Bimini]] in the western Bahamas transported cheap Caribbean [[rum]] to Florida [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]]. But [[rum]]'s cheapness made it a low-profit item for the rum-runners, and they soon moved on to smuggling [[Canadian whisky]], French [[champagne]], and English [[gin]] to major cities like [[New York City]] and [[Boston]], where prices ran high. It was said that some ships carried $200,000 in contraband in a single run.

===Tobacco===
It has been reported that smuggling one truckload of cigarettes from a low-tax [[U.S. state|US state]] to a high-tax state can lead to a profit of up to $2 million.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Horiwitz |first=Sari |date=June 8, 2004 |title=Cigarette Smuggling Linked to Terrorism |page=A04 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A23384-2004Jun7.html |access-date=2012-03-05}}</ref> The low-tax states are generally the major tobacco producers, and have come under enormous criticism for their reluctance to increase taxes. [[North Carolina]] eventually agreed to raise its taxes from 5 cents to 35 cents per pack of 20 cigarettes, although this remains far below the national average.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Matthew L. Myers |date=August 5, 2005 |title=North Carolina's Cigarette Tax Increase Is A Small Step In The Right Direction But Kids and Taxpayers Will Miss Benefits of Greater Increase |url=http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/press_releases/post/id_0861 |access-date=2012-03-06 |website=Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids}}</ref> But [[South Carolina]] has so far refused to follow suit and raise taxes from seven cents per pack (the lowest in the USA).<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 1, 2010 |title=State Sales, Gasoline, Cigarette, and Alcohol Tax Rates by State, 2000–2010 |url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/research/show/245.html |access-date=2012-03-06 |website=Tax Foundation}}</ref>

===Racketeering===
{{Main|Racket (crime)}}
A [[racket (crime)|racket]] is a service that is [[fraud]]ulently offered to solve a problem, such as for a problem that does not actually exist, that will not be put into effect, or that would not otherwise exist if the racket did not exist. Conducting a racket is racketeering.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Racketeering |encyclopedia=Dictionary.com |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racketeering |accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> Particularly, the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it, although that fact may be concealed, with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party. An archetype is the [[protection racket]], wherein a person or group (e.g., a criminal gang) indicates to a store owner that they could protect her/his store from potential damage, damage that the same person or group would otherwise inflict, while the correlation of threat and protection may be more or less deniably veiled, distinguishing it from the more direct act of [[extortion]].
Racketeering is often associated with [[organized crime]], and the term was coined by the [[Employers' Association of Greater Chicago|Employers' Association of Chicago]] in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] union.<ref>David Witwer, "'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s", in {{Cite book |last=Kreike |first=Emmanuel, Ed. |title=Corrupt histories |last2=Jordan |first2=William Chester, Ed. |publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58046-173-3 |location=Rochester, New York}}</ref>

===Transportation providers===
{{main|illegal taxicab operation}}
Where taxicabs, buses, and other transportation providers are strictly regulated or monopolized by government, a black market typically flourishes to provide transportation to poorly served or overpriced communities. In the United States, some cities restrict entry to the taxicab market with a medallion system, i.e., taxicabs must get a special license and display it on a medallion in the vehicle. In most such jurisdictions it is legal to sell the medallions, but the limited supply and resulting high prices of medallions have led to a market in unlicensed [[carpooling]]/[[illegal taxicab operation]]. In [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], for example, it is not uncommon for private individuals to provide illegal taxicab service<ref name="Baltimore" /> for city residents.

===Housing rental===
In places where there is [[rent control]] there may be a black market for housing. For instance, in the UK there is illegal [[Lease#Sublease|subletting]] of [[social housing]] homes where the tenant illegally rents out the home at a higher rent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9474000/9474045.stm Tracking down England's council house sublet cheats], ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', BBC, May 4, 2011</ref> In Sweden, rental contracts with regulated rent can be bought on the black market,<ref>[http://www.thelocal.se/20100830/28666 'Egalitarian' Stockholm rents feed black market], ''[[The Local]]'', August 30, 2010</ref> either from the current tenant or sometimes directly from the property owner. Specialised black-market dealers assist the property owners with such transactions.<ref>[http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/svd-avslojar-systematisk-forsaljning-av-svartkontrakt_8146104.svd "Hyrestvåan är din för 300 000"] (in Swedish, "The rental one-bedroom [apartment] is yours for 300 000 [SEK]"), [[Svenska Dagbladet]], May 5, 2013</ref> In India, places like Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkotta and New Delhi, where students are coming from all over India, getting high rented paying guests or other forms of rented apartments without any taxation or regulations.

===Counterfeit medicine, essential aircraft and automobile parts===
{{Main|Counterfeit consumer goods}}
Medicines and essential aircraft and automobile parts (e.g. brakes, motor parts, etc.) are counterfeited on a large scale.

===Copyrighted media===
{{Main|Copyright infringement}}
{{Essay-like|section|date=April 2017}}
[[Street vendor]]s in countries where there is little enforcement of [[copyright law]], particularly in Asia and Latin America, often sell deeply discounted copies of [[film]]s, music [[CD]]s, and computer [[software]] such as [[video game]]s, sometimes even before the official release of the title. A determined counterfeiter with a few hundred dollars can make copies that are digitally identical to an original and face no loss in quality; innovations in consumer [[DVD]] and [[CD]] writers and the widespread availability of [[software cracking|cracks]] on the [[Internet]] for most forms of [[copy protection]] technology make this cheap and easy to do.

Copyright-holders and other proponents of copyright laws have found this phenomenon hard to stop through the courts, as the operations are distributed and widespread,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} transversing national borders and thus legal systems. Since digital information can be duplicated repeatedly with no loss of quality, and passed on electronically at little to no cost, the effective underground market value of media is zero, differentiating it from nearly all other forms of underground economic activity. The issue is compounded by widespread indifference to enforcing copyright law, both with governments and the public at large. To steal a car is seen as a crime in most people's eyes, but to obtain unauthorized copies of music or a game is not.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Charles W. Moore |date=August 8, 2003 |title=Is music piracy stealing? |url=http://www.applelinks.com/mooresviews/pirate.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401235246/http://www.applelinks.com/mooresviews/pirate.shtml |archive-date=April 1, 2012 |access-date=2012-03-06 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Additionally, [[Anti-copyright|not all people agree]] with 'copyright laws', as it unfairly criminalises competition, allowing the copyright-holder to effectively monopolise related industries. It also authorises copyright-holders to use [[DVD region codes|region-coding]] to discriminate against selected populations price-wise and availability-wise.

The comparison to car-theft, although common, is not truly analogous. Automobile theft results in an item being removed from the owner with the ownership transferred to a second party. Media piracy is a crime of duplication, with no physical property being stolen. Copyright infringement law goes as far as to deem illegal "[[mixtape]]s" and other such material copied to tape or disk. Copyright holders typically attest the act of theft to be in the profits forgone to the pirates. However, this makes the unsubstantiated assumption that the pirates would have bought the copyrighted material if it had not been available through [[file sharing]] or other means. Copyright holders also say that they did some work for creating their copyrighted material and they wish to get compensated for their work. No other system than copyright has been found to compensate the artists and other creators for their work,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and many artists do not have any alternative source of income or another job. Many artists and film producers have accepted the role of piracy in media distribution.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 14, 2009 |title=Documentary Filmmaker Supports BitTorrent Uploader |url=http://torrentfreak.com/documentary-filmmaker-supports-bittorrent-uploader-090514/ |access-date=2012-03-05 |website=TorrentFreak}}</ref> The spread of material through file sharing is a major source of publicity for artists and has been shown to build fan bases that may be more inclined to see the performer live<ref>{{Cite news |last=Verkaik |first=Robert |date=July 8, 2009 |title=Illegal downloading: What happens if you're caught? |work=The Independent |location=London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/illegal-downloading-what-happens-if-youre-caught-1736013.html |access-date=2012-03-05}}</ref> (live performances make up the bulk of successful artists' revenues,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cory Doctorow |date=November 13, 2009 |title=Labels may be losing money, but artists are making more than ever |url=http://boingboing.net/2009/11/13/labels-may-be-losing.html |access-date=2012-03-05}}</ref> however not all artists can make live performances, for example photographers typically only have a single source of income that is the licensing of their photos).

===Currency===
{{Main|Fixed exchange rate}}
Money itself is traded on the black market. This may happen for one or more of several reasons:
* The government sets ("pegs") the local currency at some arbitrary level to another currency that does not reflect its true market value.
* A government makes it difficult or illegal for its citizens to own much or any foreign currency.
* The government taxes exchanging the local currency with other currencies, either in one direction or both (e.g. foreigners are taxed to buy local currency, or residents are taxed to buy foreign currency).
* The currency is [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit]].
* The currency has been acquired illegally and needs to be [[money laundering|laundered]] before the money can be used.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oriana Zill |last2=Lowell Bergman |title=Drug Wars: Special Reports: The Black Peso Money Laudering System |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/special/blackpeso.html |access-date=2012-03-06 |website=PBS Frontline |name-list-style=amp}}</ref>

A government may officially set the rate of exchange of its currency with that of other currencies, typically the [[US dollar]]. When it does, the peg often overvalues the local currency relative to what its market value would be if it were a [[floating currency]]. Those in possession of the "harder" currency, for example [[expatriate]] workers, may be able to use the black market to buy the local currency at better exchange rates than they can get officially.

In situations of financial instability and inflation, citizens may substitute a foreign currency for the local currency. The U.S. dollar is viewed as a relatively stable and safe currency and is often used abroad as a second currency. In 2012, $340 billion, roughly 37 percent<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Feige |first=Edgar L. |author-link=Edgar L. Feige |date=April 2012 |title=New Estimates of U.S. Currency Abroad, the Underground Economy, and the "Tax Gap" |url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/34778/ |journal=Crime, Law and Social Change |doi=10.1007/s10611-011-9348-8 |access-date=March 17, 2014 |s2cid=153877115}}</ref> of all U.S. currency, was believed to be circulating abroad.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 8, 2011 |title=Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Z.1 Table 204 |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/ |access-date=2012-03-05 |website=U.S. Federal Reserve}}</ref> The most recent study of the amount of currency held overseas suggests that only 25 percent of U.S. currency is presently held abroad.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Feige, Edgar L. |date=February 2, 2012 |title=The myth of the "cashless society": How much of America's currency is overseas? |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/42169.html |access-date=September 14, 2014}}</ref> The widespread substitution of U.S. currency for local currency is known as ''[[de facto]] [[dollarisation]]'', and has been observed in transition countries such as Cambodia<ref>[[Edgar L. Feige]], "Dynamics of Currency Substitution, Asset Substitution and De facto Dollarisation and Euroisation in Transition Countries", ''Comparative Economic Studies'', September 2003, Vol. 45 #3 pp. 358–83.</ref> and in some Latin American countries.<ref>E. L. Feige et al. "Unofficial Dollarization in Latin America: Currency Substitution, Network Externalities and Irreversibility", in Dean, Salvatore and Willett (eds.) The Dollarization Debate, Oxford Press, 2003.</ref> Some countries, such as [[Ecuador]], abandoned their local currency and now use US dollars, essentially for this reason, a process known as [[de jure dollarization]]. See also the example of the [[Ghanaian cedi]] from the 1970s and 1980s.

If foreign currency is difficult or illegal for local citizens to acquire, they will pay a premium to acquire it. U.S. currency is viewed as a relatively stable store of value and since it does not leave a paper trail,{{Dubious|reason=serial numbers|date=March 2012}} it is also a convenient medium of exchange for both illegal transactions and for [[tax evasion|unreported income]] both in the U.S and abroad.<ref name="Cebula and Feige">{{Cite journal |last=Feige, Edgar L. |last2=Cebula, Richard |date=January 2011 |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S. |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |access-date=2012-03-05 |name-list-style=amp}}</ref>

More recently [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] such as [[bitcoin]] have been used as medium of exchange in black market transactions. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes favored over [[Central bank|centralized currency]] due to their anonymous nature and their ability to be traded over the internet.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Follow The Bitcoin: How We Got Busted Buying Drugs On Silk Road's Black Market |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/09/05/follow-the-bitcoins-how-we-got-busted-buying-drugs-on-silk-roads-black-market/}}</ref>

===Fuel===
In the EU, it is not illegal for a person or business to buy fuel in one EU state for their own use in another, but as with other goods the tax will generally be payable by the final customer at the physical place of making the purchase.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Between the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]], there has often been a black market in [[petrol]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Tom Peterkin |date=January 31, 2006 |title=IRA fuel smuggling 'drove oil giants to abandon Ulster' |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1509280/IRA-fuel-smuggling-drove-oil-giants-to-abandon-Ulster.html |access-date=2012-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501041920/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1509280/IRA-fuel-smuggling-drove-oil-giants-to-abandon-Ulster.html |archive-date=2011-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=May 3, 2001 |title=Fuel smuggling down say customs |publisher=[[BBC]] |location=Belfast |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1311445.stm |access-date=2012-03-06}}</ref>
The direction of smuggling can change depending on the variation of the taxes and the [[exchange rate]] between the [[Euro]] and [[Pound Sterling]]; indeed sometimes diesel will be smuggled in one direction and petrol the other.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In some countries, diesel fuel for agricultural vehicles or domestic use is taxed at a much lower rate than that for other vehicles. This is known as [[fuel dyes|dyed fuel]], because a coloured dye is added so it can be detected if used in other vehicles (e.g. a red dye in the UK, a green dye in Ireland). Nevertheless, the saving is attractive enough to make a black market in agricultural diesel. In 2007 it was estimated that £350 million was not gained in profit as a result of this phenomenon, in the UK.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=November 7, 2007 |title=Red diesel abuse costs UK millions |url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/red-diesel-abuse-costs-uk-millions/229086 |magazine=[[What Car?]] |publisher=[[Haymarket Group]] |access-date=2012-03-06}}</ref>

In countries like India and Nepal, the price of fuel is set by the government, and it is illegal to sell the fuel over the set price. Due to the petrol crisis in Nepal, black marketing in fuel has been a common trend, especially during mass petrol shortage. At times, people need to queue for hours or even sometimes overnight to get the fuel. On the other hand, the petrol pump operators are alleged to hoarding the fuel, and selling it to black marketers. Black marketing in vehicle/cooking fuel became widespread during the [[2015 Nepal blockade|2015 economic blockade]] imposed on Nepal. Even after the economic blockade was eased, and petrol imports resumed, people are not getting the fuel as they were supposed to and are resort to buying from the black market.

===Sex toys===
There are some countries where sex toys are illegal, such as Saudi Arabia, Thailand and India. The illegality has omitted certain clearing processes such as safety testing when they are sold by undercover independent vendors on the black market. Other black market platforms used to sell sex toys on the black market include consumer-to-consumer online auction websites, as well as private pages on social media websites.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 5, 2019 |title=The fight to legalise sex toys in Thailand |url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/politics/article/43936/1/the-fight-to-legalise-sex-toys-in-thailand-bangkok}}</ref> In black market venues in Cambodia, sex toys have been seized alongside aphrodisiac products.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 6, 2015 |title=Meeting a Dildo Dealer in Cambodia, Where Sex Toys Are Illegal |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypa7mg/meeting-a-dildo-dealer-in-cambodia-where-sex-toys-are-illegal}}</ref> Some analysts have argued that if efforts in North America to ban realistic-looking [[sexbot]]s succeed, it may result in a black market trade in sexbots.<ref>Klein, Wilhelm EJ, and Vivian Wenli Lin.

==Organized crime==
{{Main|Organized crime}}
People engaged in the black market usually run their business hidden under a [[Front organization|front]] business that is legal.

Often, certain types of illegal products are traded against one another, depending on the geographical location.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2011-01-31 |title=Organized Crime: The World's Largest Social Network |url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/01/ff_orgchart_crime/ |journal=WIRED |volume=19 |issue=2 |access-date=September 14, 2014}}</ref>

==Causes==

===Wars===
Black markets flourish in most countries during [[war]]time. States that are engaged in [[total war]] or other large-scale, extended [[war]]s often impose restrictions on home use of critical resources that are needed for the war effort, such as [[food]], [[gasoline]], [[rubber]], [[metal]], etc., typically through [[rationing]]. In most cases, a black market develops to supply rationed goods at exorbitant prices. The [[rationing]] and [[price controls]] enforced in many countries during [[World War II]] encouraged widespread black market activity.<ref name="TheHomeFront">{{Cite book |title=The Home Front |date=July 1945 |publisher=Imperial War Museum |isbn=978-1-904897-11-8 |edition=facsimile |location=London}}</ref> One source of black-market meat under wartime rationing was by farmers declaring fewer domestic animal births to the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] than actually happened. Another in Britain was supplies from the US, intended only for use in US army bases on British land, but leaked into the local native British black market.

For example, in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] on February 17, 1945,<ref>''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' February 17, 1945, reprinted on page 30 ''The Daily Telegraph'' February 17, 2015</ref> [[Member of parliament|members]] said that "the whole [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] production of [[East Anglia]] had gone to the black market" and "prosecutions [for black-marketing] were like trying to stop a leak in a battleship", and it was said that official prices of such foods were set so low that their producers often sold their produce on the black market for higher prices; one such route (seen to operate at the market at [[Diss]] in Norfolk) was to sell live poultry to members of the public, and each purchaser would sign a form promising that he was buying the birds to breed from, and then take them home for eating.

During the [[Vietnam war]], American soldiers would spend [[Military Payment Certificate]]s on [[maid]] service and [[Human sexuality|sexual]] entertainment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Also if a Vietnamese civilian wanted something that was hard to get, he would buy it at double the price from one of the soldiers, who had a monthly ration card and thus had access to the military stores.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The transactions ran through the on-base maids to the local populace. Although these activities were illegal, only flagrant or large-scale black-marketeers were prosecuted by the military.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===Laws and regulations===
A classic example of new regulation creating a black market is the [[prohibition]] of alcohol. Similarly, when the law disappears, so does the black market. Which is why one of the arguments for marijuana legalization is the elimination of the black market and thus taxes from that economy being used by the government.
