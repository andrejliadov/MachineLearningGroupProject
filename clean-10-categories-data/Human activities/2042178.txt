A '''ball pit''' (originally called "'''ball crawl'''" and also known as a '''ball pool''' or '''ball pond''') is a padded box or pool filled with small colorful hollow plastic balls generally no larger than {{convert|3|in|cm}} in diameter. Instead of balls, other spherical objects can be used, such as balloons. It is typically employed as a recreation and exercise for children.

Ball pits are often found at nurseries, [[carnival]]s, [[amusement park]]s, [[Family fun center|fun center]]s, [[fast-food restaurants]], and large [[video arcade]]s.  [[Chuck E. Cheese's]] and (now defunct) [[Discovery Zone]] formerly had ball pits and they were frequently incorporated into larger play structures, such as [[maze]]s, [[Playground slide|slide]]s, and [[jungle gym]]s.

Ball pits may be rented for [[party|parties]], and smaller versions are sold for use in the home. While ball pits are traditionally intended for children, some are large enough to accommodate [[adult]]s.

Ball pits may be used together with a [[trampoline]], or combining the two by filling a closed trampoline with the balls.
