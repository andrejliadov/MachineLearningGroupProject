==Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System==
The Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System uses inputs from terrain mapping, aircraft location, and automation to avoid ground collisions.  The Auto-GCAS system
detects imminent ground contact and warns the pilot.  If there is no pilot response, the Auto-GCAS takes control, maneuvering to avoid ground contact.  When on a safe trajectory, with pilot awareness, control returns to the pilot.<ref name="Lockheed Martin"> </ref> Pilot unresponsiveness can be attributed to many factors including: distraction, task saturation, incapacitation, and unconsciousness.  The Auto-GCAS system successfully reduced the leading cause of [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] pilot fatalities. <ref name="Lockheed Martin">{{cite web |title=Saving the Good Guys with Auto GCAS Technology |url=https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/autogcas.html |website=Lockheedmartin.com |publisher=Lockheed Martin |accessdate=30 May 2020}}</ref>

NASA started working on Auto-GCAS starting in 1997.  <ref name="NASA">{{cite web |title=NASA-Pioneered Automatic Ground-Collision Avoidance System Operational |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/Features/Auto-GCAS_Installed_in_USAF_F-16s.html |website=NASA.gov |publisher=NASA |accessdate=30 May 2020}}</ref> The system was then jointly developed at the [[Lockheed Martin]] <ref name="Lockheed Martin"> </ref>[[Skunk Works]] and at [[NASA]].    In July 2019, seven years ahead of schedule, Lockheed Martin started integration of Auto-GCAS into the F-35 fleet.  <ref name="airforce-technology.com">{{cite web |title=Lockheed Martin integrates ground collision avoidance system in F-35A |url=https://www.airforce-technology.com/news/lockheed-ground-collision-avoidance-f-35a/ |website=airforce-technology.com |publisher=airforce-technology.com |accessdate=30 May 2020}}</ref>
