'''Document 12-571-3570''' (also titled '''NASA No. 12 571-3570''') is a [[hoax]] document originally posted to the [[Usenet]] newsgroup [[alt.sex]] on November 28, 1989.<ref>Robert A. Freitas Jr., [http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/SexxxInSpace.htm Sex in Space], author's commentary on an article originally published in ''Sexology Today'' 48 (April 1983), 58–64</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130403040252/http://bill.wards.net/blosxom/humor/parody/space_sex.html Sex in Space?], reposted by Bill Ward, July 30, 2001 (this reposting preserves the original text and original posting date, unlike many other repostings)</ref> According to this document, astronauts aboard [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-75]] performed a variety of sex acts to determine which [[sex positions|positions]] are most effective in [[zero gravity]]. The document goes on to report that of the 10 positions tested, six required the use of a belt and an inflatable tunnel, while four were contingent on hanging on. The document also discusses a video record of the 10 one-hour sessions in the lower deck of the shuttle, and notes that the subjects added their own personal footnotes to help scientists.

The real STS-75 mission occurred in 1996, 7 years after the text was published, clearly indicating that the document is a hoax.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roach |first1=Mary |title=Packing For Mars |date=2011 |publisher=W.

In March 2000, NASA's director of media services Brian Welch referred to the document as a "fairly well-known '[[urban legend]]{{'"}}.<ref>David Schmader, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=3354 Last Days], ''The Stranger'', February 22, 2000</ref>

This fictional document was rediscovered and widely publicized by astronomer and scientific writer Pierre Kohler, who used it as a major source about sex experiments in space in his 2000 book, ''The Final Mission''.<ref>Pierre Kohler. ''La Dernière Mission'' (''The Final Mission'').
