==Etymology==
The term ''recreation'' appears to have been used in English first in the late 14th century, first in the sense of "refreshment or curing of a sick person",<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=recreation&searchmode=none Online Etymology Dictionary]</ref> and derived  turn from Latin (''re'': "again", ''creare'': "to create, bring forth, beget").

===Prerequisites to leisure===
Humans spend their time in [[activities of daily living]], [[Employment|work]], [[sleep]], social duties and leisure, the latter time being free from prior commitments to physiologic or social needs,<ref>Yurkic TS (1970) page 2</ref> a prerequisite of recreation. Leisure has increased with increased longevity and, for many, with decreased hours spent for physical and economic survival, yet others argue that time pressure has increased for modern people, as they are committed to too many tasks.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950883,00.html?internalid=ACA |title=Stress: Can We Cope? |author=Claudia Wallis |date=1983-06-06 |journal=Time |accessdate=October 31, 2010}}</ref> Other factors that account for an increased role of recreation are affluence, population trends, and increased commercialization of recreational offerings.<ref name=kraus>{{cite book |vauthors=McLean DD, Hurd AR, Rogers NB |title=Kraus' Recreation and Leisure in Modern Society, 7th Edition |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |year=2005 |page=1ff |isbn=978-0-7637-0756-9}}</ref> While one perception is that leisure is just "spare time", time not consumed by the necessities of living, another holds that leisure is a force that allows individuals to consider and reflect on the values and realities that are missed in the activities of daily life, thus being an essential element of personal development and civilization.<ref name=yukic/> This direction of thought has even been extended to the view that leisure is the purpose of work, and a reward in itself,<ref name=yukic/> and "leisure life" reflects the values and character of a nation.<ref name= kraus/> Leisure is considered a [[human right]] under the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].<ref>[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], [[s:Universal Declaration of Human Rights#Article 24|Article 24]] ([https://undocs.org/A/RES/217(III) Text of Resolution]), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (A/RES/217, 10 December 1948 at Palais de Chaillot, Paris)</ref>

===Play, recreation and work===
{{Main|Play (activity)}}
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 041b.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' (1560)]]
Recreation is difficult to separate from the general concept of [[Play (activity)|play]], which is usually the term for children's recreational activity. Children may playfully imitate activities that reflect the realities of adult life. It has been proposed that play or recreational activities are outlets of or expression of excess energy, channeling it into socially acceptable activities that fulfill individual as well as societal needs, without need for compulsion, and providing satisfaction and pleasure for the participant.<ref name=y3>Yukic TS, 1970, page 3f</ref> A traditional view holds that work is supported by  recreation, recreation being useful to "recharge the battery" so that work performance is improved. 

Work, an activity generally performed out of economic necessity and useful for society and organized within the economic framework, however can also be pleasurable and may be self-imposed thus blurring the distinction to recreation. Many activities in [[entertainment]] are work for one person and recreation for another. Over time, a recreational activity may become work, and vice versa. Thus, for a musician, playing an instrument may be at one time a profession, and at another a recreation. 

Similarly, it may be difficult to separate education from recreation as in the case of [[recreational mathematics]].<ref>Kulkarni, D.

===Health and recreation===
Recreation has many health benefits, and, accordingly, Therapeutic Recreation has been developed to take advantage of this effect. The National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification (NCTRC) is the nationally recognized credentialing organization for the profession of Therapeutic Recreation. Professionals in the field of Therapeutic Recreation who are certified by the NCTRC are called "Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialists". The job title "Recreation Therapist" is identified in the U.S. Dept of Labor's Occupation Outlook. Such therapy is applied in [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]], psychiatric facilities for youth and adults, and in the care of the elderly, the disabled, or people with chronic diseases. Recreational physical activity is important to reduce obesity, and the risk of osteoporosis<ref>{{Cite journal

==Forms and activities==
[[File:Mennonite Women Dressmaking Pennsylvania 1942.jpg|thumb|180px|Mennonite woman [[dressmaking]] (1942)]]
Recreation is an essential part of human life and finds many different forms which are shaped naturally by individual interests but also by the surrounding social construction.<ref name=daniels/> Recreational activities can be communal or solitary, active or passive, outdoors or indoors, healthy or harmful, and useful for society or detrimental. A significant section of recreational activities are designated as  [[hobbies]] which are activities done for pleasure on a regular basis. Some recreational activities – such as gambling, [[recreational drug use]], or delinquent activities – may violate societal norms and laws. A list of typical activities could be almost endless

===Bricolage===
{{Main|Do it yourself}}
[[Bricolage]] and DIY are some of the terms describing the building, [[wikt:modification|modifying]], or [[repair]]ing things without the direct aid of experts or professionals. Academic research has described DIY as behaviors where "individuals engage [[Raw material|raw]] and semi-raw materials and parts to produce, transform, or reconstruct material possessions, including those drawn from the natural environment (e.g., landscaping)".<ref>Wolf & McQuitty (2011). Understanding the Do-It-Yourself Consumer: DIY Motivation and Outcomes. ''Academy of Marketing Science Review''</ref> DIY [[behavior]] can be triggered by various motivations previously categorized as [[market economy|marketplace]] motivations (economic benefits, lack of product availability, lack of product quality, need for customization), and [[identity (social science)|identity]] enhancement ([[Workmanship|craftsmanship]], empowerment, community seeking, uniqueness).<ref>Wolf & McQuitty (2011)</ref> They could involve [[craft]]s that requires particular skills and knowledge of [[Skilled worker|skilled work]]. Typical interests enjoyed by the [[maker culture]] include engineering-oriented pursuits such as [[home improvement]], [[electronics]], [[robotics]], [[3D printing|3-D printing]], and the use of [[Numerical control|Computer Numeric Control]] tools, as well as more traditional activities such as [[metalworking]], [[woodworking]], and, mainly, its predecessor, traditional [[Handicraft|arts and crafts]]. The subculture stresses a cut-and-paste approach to standardized hobbyist [[technologies]], and encourages cookbook re-use of designs published on websites and maker-oriented publications.<ref>{{Cite news |title=On State Street, "Maker" Movement Arrives |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/make_haven/id_46594 |date=April 30, 2012 |author=Thomas MacMillan |work=New Haven Independent}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://startupeuropeclub.eu/makers-upv-making-locally-winning-globally/|title=Makers UPV: making locally, winning globally {{!}} Startup Europe|website=startupeuropeclub.eu|access-date=2016-08-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821050314/http://startupeuropeclub.eu/makers-upv-making-locally-winning-globally/|archive-date=2016-08-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> There is a strong focus on using and learning practical skills and applying them to reference designs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Invent To Learn|last=Martinez|first=Sylvia|publisher=Constructing Modern Knowledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9891511-0-8|location=Torrance, CA|pages=32–35}}</ref> There is also growing work on [[Hackerspace#Equity and justice-centered making|equity and the maker culture]].

{{Main|Game}}
Any structured form of [[play (activity)|play]] could become a game. Games are played sometimes purely for recreation, sometimes for achievement or monetary rewards as well. They are played for recreation alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs. Professionals can play as part of their work for entertainment of the audience. The games could be [[board games]], [[puzzles]], [[PC game|computer]] or [[video games]].

===Outdoor recreation===
{{Main|Outdoor recreation}}
[[File:Tompkins Square Park Central Knoll.jpg|thumb|A park in New York City where people sunbathe and relax.]]
[[Recreation]] engaged in out of doors, most commonly in natural settings. The activities themselves — such as [[fishing]], [[hunting]], [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], and [[horseback riding]] — characteristically dependent on the environment practiced in. While many of these activities can be classified as [[sports]], they do not all demand that a participant be an [[athlete]]. [[Competition]] generally is less stressed than in individual or team sports organized into opposing squads in pursuit of a trophy or championship. When the activity involves exceptional excitement, physical challenge, or risk, it is sometimes referred to as "adventure recreation" or "adventure training", rather than an [[extreme sport]].

Other traditional examples of outdoor recreational activities include [[hiking]], [[camping]], [[mountaineering]], [[cycling]], [[canoeing]], [[caving]], [[kayaking]], [[rafting]], [[rock climbing]], [[running]], [[sailing]], [[skiing]], [[sky diving]] and [[surfing]].  As new pursuits, often hybrids of prior ones, emerge, they gain their own identities, such as [[coasteering]], [[canyoning]], [[fastpacking]], and [[plogging]].

===Performing arts===
{{Main|Performing arts}}
====Dance====
{{Main|Dance}}
[[File:Peterborough Snow Ball 2008 silent video.ogg|thumb|[[Contra dance]]rs creating their own recreation at a ball in New Hampshire, United States (silent video)]]
Participatory dance whether it be a [[folk dance]], a [[social dance]], a [[group dance]] such as a [[Line dance|line]], [[Circle dance|circle]], [[Medieval dance#Other Chain Dances|chain]] or [[square dance]], or a [[partner dance]] such as is common in western [[Ballroom dance|Western ballroom dancing]], is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as entertainment, [[social interaction]] or [[exercise]], of participants rather than onlookers. The many forms of [[dance]] provide recreation for all age groups and cultures.

====Music Creation====
{{Main|Music}}
Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from recreation, religious or ceremonial purposes, or for entertainment. When music was only available through [[sheet music]] scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras in Europe, music lovers would buy the [[sheet music]] of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on their instruments.

===Visual arts===
{{Main|Visual arts}}
Woodworking, photography, [[moviemaking]], [[jewellery making|jewelry making]], software projects such as [[Photoshopping]] and home music or [[video production]], making [[friendship bracelets|bracelets]], [[art|artistic projects]] such as drawing, painting, Cosplay (design, creation, and wearing a costume based on an already existing creative property), creating models out of card stock or paper – called [[papercraft]] fall under the category [[visual arts]]. many of these are practised for recreation.

====Drawing====
{{Main|Drawing}}
Drawing goes back at least 16,000 years to [[Paleolithic]] [[Cave painting|cave representations]] of animals such as those at [[Lascaux]] in France and [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] in Spain. In [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]], ink drawings on [[papyrus]], often depicting people, were used as models for painting or sculpture. Drawings on [[pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]], initially geometric, later developed to the human form with [[black-figure pottery]] during the 7th century BC.<ref>[http://www.dibujosparapintar.com/english_activities/drawing_course_history.html History of Drawing. From Dibujos para Pintar.] Retrieved 23 October 2009.</ref>

With [[history of paper|paper]] becoming common in Europe by the 15th century, drawing was adopted by masters such as [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who sometimes treated drawing as an art in its own right rather than a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..dr085000.a |title=Drawing |date=2006 |website=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314224108/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..dr085000.a |archive-date=14 March 2009 |url-status=dead |access-date=23 October 2009 }}</ref>

====Literature====
Writing may involve letters, journals and weblogs.
In the US, about half of all adults read one or more books for pleasure each year.<ref name=":0" />  About 5% read more than 50 books per year.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/09/love-reading-books-leisure-pleasure/598315/|title=Why Some People Become Lifelong Readers|last=Pinsker|first=Joe|date=2019-09-19|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>

====Painting====
{{Main|Painting}}
[[File:Lascaux painting.jpg|thumb|Depiction of aurochs, horses and deer in Lascaux]]
Like drawing, painting has its documented origins in caves and on rock faces. The finest examples, believed by some to be 32,000 years old, are in the [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] and [[Lascaux]] caves in southern France. In shades of red, brown, yellow and black, the paintings on the walls and ceilings are of bison, cattle, horses and deer. Paintings of human figures can be found in the tombs of ancient Egypt. In the great temple of [[Ramses II]], [[Nefertari]], his queen, is depicted being led by [[Isis]].<ref>[http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=1320&HistoryID=ab20&gtrack=pthc History of Painting. From History World]. Retrieved 23 October 2009.</ref> Greek and Roman art like the Hellenistic [[Fayum mummy portraits]] and [[Battle of Issus]] at [[Pompeii]] contributed to [[Byzantine art]] in the 4th century BC, which initiated a tradition in icon painting. Models of aeroplanes, boats, cars, tanks, artillery, and even figures of soldiers and superheroes are popular subjects to build, paint and display.

====Photography====
{{Main|Photography}}
An amateur photographer practices photography as a [[hobby]]/[[Passion (emotion)|passion]] and not for monetary profit. The quality of some amateur work may be highly specialized or [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] in choice of subjects. Amateur photography is often pre-eminent in photographic subjects which have little prospect of commercial use or reward. Amateur photography grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the [[Hand-held camera]].<ref>{{Cite journal

==Organized recreation==
[[File:University of Auckland Recreation Centre.JPG|thumb|right|University of Auckland Recreation Centre]]
Many recreational activities are organized, typically by public institutions, voluntary group-work agencies, private groups supported by membership fees, and commercial enterprises.<ref>Yucik TS, 1970, page 62f</ref> Examples of each of these are the [[National Park Service]], the [[YMCA]], the [[Kiwanis]], and [[Walt Disney World]]. Public space such as [[park]]s and [[beach]]es are essential venues for many recreational activities and [[Tourism]] has recognized that many visitors are specifically attracted by recreational offerings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportrec.qld.gov.au/Industryinformation/Abouttheindustry/Whatisrecreation.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401035427/http://www.sportrec.qld.gov.au/Industryinformation/Abouttheindustry/Whatisrecreation.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 1, 2009 |author=Queensland Government |title=What is Recreation? |accessdate=October 31, 2010 }} </ref> In particular, beach and waterfront promenades such as the beach area of [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]] in California, the [[Promenade de la Croisette]] in Cannes, the [[Promenade des Anglais]] in Nice or the lungomare of [[Barcola]] with Miramare Castle in Trieste are important recreational areas for the city population on the one hand and on the other also important tourist destinations with all advantages and disadvantages for the locals. 

In support of recreational activities government has taken an important role in their creation, maintenance, and organization, and whole industries have developed merchandise or services. Recreation-related business is an important factor in the economy; it has been estimated that the outdoor recreation sector alone contributes $730 billion annually to the U.S. economy and generates 6.5 million jobs.<ref>{{cite web |author= Rechner |title=Letter to the Editor: Outdoor recreation stimulates the economy |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/11/outdoor-recreation-stimulates-the-economy/ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date= March 11, 2010 |accessdate=November 2, 2010}}</ref>

===Recreation center===
A recreation center is a place for recreational activities usually administered by a municipal government agency. Swimming, basketball, weightlifting, volleyball and kids' play areas are very common.<ref>[https://www.myclearwaterparks.com/facilities/recreation-centers Recreation Centers], Clearwater, FL</ref><ref>[https://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/recreationcenters Recreation Centers], New York City Department of Parks & Recreation</ref>

===Recreation as a career===
A recreation specialist would be expected to meet the recreational needs of a community or assigned interest group. Educational institutions offer courses that lead to a degree as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in recreation management. People with such degrees often work in parks and recreation centers in towns, on community projects and activities. Networking with instructors, [[budgeting]], and evaluation of continuing programs are common job duties.

In the United States, most [[U.S. state|states]] have a professional organization for [[continuing education]] and [[professional certification|certification]] in recreation management. The [[National Recreation and Park Association]] administers a certification program called the CPRP (Certified Park and Recreation Professional)<ref name="NRPA-CPRP">{{cite web |url=http://www.nrpa.org/CPRP/ |title=Certified Park and Recreation Professional (CPRP) Certification |publisher=[[National Recreation and Park Association]] |accessdate=6 November 2010}}</ref> that is considered a national standard for professional recreation specialist practices.

=== e-commerce ===
Since the beginning of the 2000s, there are more and more online booking / ticketing platforms for recreational activities that emerged. Many of them leveraged the ever-growing prevalence of internet, mobile devices and e-payments to build comprehensive online booking solutions. The first successful batch includes tourist recreation activities platform like [[TripAdvisor]] that went public. The emergence of these platforms infers the rising needs for recreation and entertainment from the growing urban citizens worldwide.
