{{transport}}
[[File:The How and Why Library 019.jpg|thumb]]'''Means of transport''' is a term used to distinguish between different ways of transportation or transporting people or goods. The different modes of transport are [[aviation|air]], [[ship transport|water]], and [[land transport]], which includes [[rail transport|Rails or railways]], [[road transport|road]] and [[off-road transport]]. Other modes also exist, including [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, [[cable transport]], and [[space transport]]. [[Human-powered transport]] and [[animal-powered transport]] are sometimes regarded as their own mode, but never fall into the other categories. In general, transportation is used for moving of people, animals, and other goods from one place to another. The means of transport, on the other hand, refers to the  ([[motor vehicle|motorized]]) [[vehicle]]s necessary for transport according to the chosen mode (car, airplane, ship, truck and rail). Each mode of transport has a fundamentally different technological solution, and some require a separate environment. Each mode has its own [[infrastructure]], vehicles, and [[business operations|operations]].

==Animal-powered==
{{Main|Animal-powered transport}}
Animal-powered transport is the use of [[working animal]]s for the transport of people and/or goods. Humans may use some of the animals directly, use them as [[pack animal]]s for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in [[team]]s, to pull [[sled]]s or wheeled [[vehicle]]s.

==Air==

A [[fixed-wing aircraft]], typically [[airplane]], is a heavier-than-air flying vehicle, in which the special geometry of the wings generates lift and then lifts the whole vehicle. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large [[airliner]]s and military [[cargo aircraft]]. For short distances or in places without runways, [[helicopters]] can be operable.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 281</ref> (Other types of aircraft, like [[autogyros]] and [[airships]], are not a significant portion of air transport.)

Air transport is the fastest method of transport, Commercial jets reach speeds of up to {{convert|955|km/h|mph}} and a considerably higher ground speed if there is a [[jet stream]] tailwind, while piston-powered general aviation aircraft may reach up to {{convert|555|km/h|mph}} or more. This celerity comes with higher cost and energy use,<ref name="guardian.co.uk">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to the US].

==Human-powered==
{{Main|Human-powered transport}}
[[File:Sherpa carrying woods.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Human-powered transport]] remains common in developing countries.]]
Human powered transport, a form of [[sustainable transportation]], is the transport of people and/or goods using [[human]] muscle-power, in the form of [[walking]], [[running]] and [[human swimming|swimming]]. Modern [[technology]] has allowed [[machine]]s to enhance human power. Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, [[leisure]], [[physical exercise]], and [[environmentalism]]; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.

Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as [[bicycle]]s and [[inline skates]]. Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by [[watercraft rowing]] and [[skiing]]; even the air can be entered with [[human-powered aircraft]].

==Land==
{{Main|Ground transportation}}
{{see also|Off-road transport }}

Land transport covers all land-based transportation systems that provide for the movement of people, goods and services. Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other. Land transport is a key factor in [[urban planning]]. It consists of 2 kinds, rail and road.

===Rail===
{{Main|Rail transport}}
[[File:ICE1 Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|German [[ICE 1]] on the [[Nuram–Munich high-speed railway]]]]

[[Rail transport]] is a means of conveyance of passengers and goods by way of wheeled vehicles running on [[track (rail transport)|rail track]], known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored perpendicular to railroad train [[consist]]s of one or more connected vehicles that run on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a [[locomotive]], that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by [[steam locomotive|steam]], [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] or by [[electric locomotive|electricity]] supplied by [[railway electrification system|trackside systems]]. Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a [[multiple unit]]. Also, a train can be powered by [[horsecar|horses]], [[funicular|cables]], gravity, [[pneumatics]] and [[gas turbine]]s. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]], though not as efficient as ships.

[[Inter-city rail|Intercity trains]] are long-haul services connecting cities;<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 279</ref> modern [[high-speed rail]] is capable of speeds up to {{convert|430|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but this requires a specially built track. [[Regional rail|Regional]] and [[commuter rail|commuter]] trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity [[tram]]ways and [[rapid transit]]s, often making up the backbone of a city's [[public transport]]. Freight trains traditionally used [[box car]]s, requiring manual loading and unloading of the [[cargo]]. Since the 1960s, container trains have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains.

===Road===
{{Main|Road transport}}

[[File:Minneapolis Critical Mass August 29, 2008 (2812714739).jpg|thumb|Bus, [[car]]s and bicycles]]
[[File:Chowringhee Square, Calcutta in 1945.jpg|thumb|Trams, lorries, cars, bicycles and rickshaws, 1945]]
A road is an identifiable route of travel, usually surfaced with gravel, asphalt or concrete, and supporting land passage by foot or by a number of vehicles.

The most common road vehicle in the developed world is the automobile, a wheeled passenger vehicle that carries its own [[car engine|motor]]. As of 2002, there were 591 million automobiles worldwide.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} Other users of roads include [[motorcar]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, [[bus]]es, trucks, [[bicycle]]s and [[pedestrians]], and special provisions are sometimes made for each of these. For example, the use of [[bus lane]]s give priority for public transport, and [[Cycling infrastructure|cycle lanes]] provide special areas of road for bicycles to use.

Motorcars offer high flexibility, but are deemed with high energy and area use, and the main source of [[noise pollution|noise]] and [[air pollution]] in cities;  buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.<ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 278</ref> Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport.

==Water==
{{Main|Ship transport}}
[[File:Jadrolinija supetar ferry.JPG|thumb|[[Roll-on/roll-off|Car ferry]] in [[Split, Croatia]]]]

Water  transport is the process of transport that a [[watercraft]], such as a [[barge]], boat, ship or [[sailboat]], makes over a body of water, such as a sea, ocean, lake, canal or river. If a boat or other vessel can successfully pass through a waterway it is known as a navigable waterway. The need for buoyancy unites watercraft, and makes the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance. When a boat is floating on the water the hull of the boat is pushing aside water where the hull now is, this is known as displacement.

In the 1800s, the first [[steamboat]]s were developed, using a [[steam engine]] to drive a [[paddle wheel]] or propeller to move the ship. The steam was produced using wood or coal. Now, most ships have an engine using a slightly refined type of petroleum called [[bunker fuel]]. Some ships, such as [[submarine]]s, use nuclear power to produce the steam. Recreational or educational craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use [[internal combustion engine]]s to drive one or more propellers, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft areas, [[hovercraft]] are propelled by large pusher-prop fans.

Although slow, modern sea transport is a highly effective method of transporting large quantities of non-perishable goods. Commercial vessels, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4&nbsp;billion tons of cargo in 2007.<ref>[[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] 2007, p. ''x'' and p. 32.</ref> Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental [[shipping]];<ref>Stopford, 1997: 4–6</ref> [[short sea shipping]] and ferries remain viable in coastal areas.<ref>Stopford, 1997: 8–9</ref><ref>Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 280</ref>

==Other modes==

[[Micromobility]] is the collective name for small electric powered vehicles.

[[File:Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Luca Galuzzi 2005.jpg|thumb|The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] conveys [[crude oil]] from the [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]] to [[Valdez, Alaska]]]]
[[Pipeline transport]] sends goods through a pipe, most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but [[pneumatic tube]]s can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For example liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for sewage, slurry water and beer, while long-distance networks are used for petroleum and natural gas.

[[Cable transport]] is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by cables instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep gradient. Typical solutions include [[aerial tramway]], [[elevator]]s, [[escalator]] and [[ski lift]]s; some of these are also categorized as [[conveyor belt|conveyor]] transport.

[[Spaceflight|Space transport]] is transport out of Earth's atmosphere into outer space by means of a [[spacecraft]]. While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific experiments. However, Man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to all the planets of the Solar System.

[[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] transport (drone transport) is being used for medicine transportation in least developed countries with inadequate infrastructure by an american based start-up Zipline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flyzipline.com/|title=Zipline - Lifesaving Deliveries by Drone|website=flyzipline.com|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref> [[Amazon.com]] and other transportation companies are currently testing the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in parcel delivery. This method will allow short-range small-parcel delivery in a short time frame.

==Components of a mode of transport==
A transport mode is a combination of the following:

*[[Transportation infrastructure]]: [[thoroughfare]]s, [[transport network|network]]s, [[transport hub|hubs]] ([[Train station|stations]], [[Bus terminus|bus terminals]], [[airport terminal]]s), etc.
*[[Vehicle]]s and [[container (cargo)|container]]s: [[motor vehicle]]s, [[automobile]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, [[truck]]s, [[wagon]]s, [[train]]s, [[ship]]s, and [[aircraft]]
*A stationary or mobile workforce
*Propulsion system and power supply ([[traction (engineering)|traction]])
*[[Business operations|Operation]]s: driving, management, traffic signals, [[railway signalling]], [[air traffic control]], etc.


'''Purpose of Transport''' : Freight & Passenger movement and mobility are core components of a transport system.
