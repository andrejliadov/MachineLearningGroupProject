'''Mos Teutonicus''' ({{lang-la|the Germanic custom}}) was a postmortem [[Funeral|funerary custom]] used in [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]] as a means of transporting, and solemnly disposing of, the bodies of high status individuals. Nobles would often undergo Mos Teutonicus since their burial plots were often located far away from their place of death.<ref name=":0" /> The process involved the removal of the flesh from the body, so that the bones of the deceased could be transported hygienically from distant lands back home.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Frost, Michael, 1961-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/872115351|title=Incarnate: the body of Christ in an age of disengagement|isbn=978-0-8308-8405-6|location=Downers Grove, IL|oclc=872115351}}</ref>

== Background ==

Nobles during the middle ages often had specific burial locations that were far away from their place of death due to the mobile nature of the middle ages. <ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Scorrano|first=Gabriele|last2=Mazzuca|first2=Claudia|last3=Valentini|first3=Federica|last4=Scano|first4=Giuseppina|last5=Buccolieri|first5=Alessandro|last6=Giancane|first6=Gabriele|last7=Manno|first7=Daniela|last8=Valli|first8=Ludovico|last9=Mallegni|first9=Francesco|last10=Serra|first10=Antonio|date=2017-09-01|title=The tale of Henry VII: a multidisciplinary approach to determining the post-mortem practice|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12520-016-0321-4|journal=Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences|language=en|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1215–1222|doi=10.1007/s12520-016-0321-4|issn=1866-9565}}</ref> They often wanted their hearts to be buried at their homes, thus their bodies had to travel far distances.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Mary E.|date=2008-03-01|title=A traitor's death?

During the [[Second Crusade|Second Crusade for the Holy Land]] it was not thought fit for [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] who fell in battle, or died of natural causes, to be buried away from their homeland in Muslim territory.<ref name="Keen">{{cite book |last=Keen |first=Maurice |title=Chivalry |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |date=September 10, 1986 |ISBN=0300033605 }}</ref> The transportation of the whole body back from foreign parts over long distances was impractical and unhygienic due to decomposition, which was often accelerated by the climate. Mos Teutonicus was especially important in warmer climates since the body was subject to faster decay. In the Mediterranean, bodies were often subject to Mos Teutonicus to preserve the body from decay because of warmer temperatures.<ref name=":0" />

German aristocrats were particularly concerned that burial should not take place in the Holy Land, but rather on home soil.<ref name=Schafer>{{cite journal |last=Scäfer |first=Von Dietrich |year=1920 |title=Mittelalter Brauch by Der Überführung von Leichen |journal=Sitzungsbrichte der preussischen Akademie der Wissenschafter |volume=XXVI |pages=478–489 |publisher=Akademie der Wissenschafter}}</ref> The [[Florence|Florentine]] chronicler [[Boncompagno da Signa|Boncompagno]] was the first to connect the procedure specifically with German aristocrats, and coins the phrase ''Mos Teutonicus'', meaning 'the Germanic custom'.{{NoteTag|Boncompagno refers to the practice in a derogatory manner, placing ''mos Teutonicus'' in a passage with [[Jewish]] and [[Rome|Roman]] burial customs designed to preserve the dignity and honour of the body. He claims the Germans (''teutonici'') [[dismember]] the bodies of their most eminent people.<ref name="Schafer" />}}
[[File:Human skeleton remains.jpg|thumb|This is what the bones would resemble as they were transported through the process of Mos Teutonicus.]]
English and French aristocrats generally preferred [[embalming]] to ''Mos Teutonicus'', involving the burial of the entrails and [[heart]] in a separate location from the corpse.<ref name="Westerhof">{{cite book|last=Westerhof |title=Death and the Noble Body in Medieval England |publisher=Boydell Press |date=October 16, 2008 |isbn=1843834162}}</ref> One of the advantages of ''Mos Teutonicus'' was that it was relatively economical in comparison with embalming, and was more hygienic.<ref name=Westerhof />
[[File:Results of Embalming.jpg|thumb|English and French nobles preferred embalming, which did not remove the flesh from the bones.  The picture above shows the flesh still on the bones compared to Mos Teutonicus which removed all organs and skin. ]]
Corpse preservation was very popular in mediaeval society.<ref name=Brown>{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Elizabeth A. R. |year=1981 |title=Death and the Human Body in the Late Middle Ages: The Legislation of Boniface VIII on the division of the Corpse |journal=Viator |volume=XII |pages=223 to 270 |publisher=UCLA: Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies}}</ref> The decaying body was seen  as a representative of something sinful and evil.<ref name=Westerhof />  Embalming and ''Mos Teutonicus'', along with tomb effigies, were a way of giving the corpse an illusion of stasis and removed the uneasy image of putrification and decay.<ref name=Westerhof />

In 1270, the body of [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX]], who died in [[Tunis]], which was [[Muslim]] territory, was subject to the process of ''Mos Teutonicus'' for its transportation back to France.<ref name=Westerhof />

== Process ==
The process of ''Mos Teutonicus'' began with the [[cadaver]] being [[dismembered]]<ref name=Westerhof /> to facilitate the next stage in the process, in which the body parts were [[boiled]] in water, wine, milk, or vinegar<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Kjellström|first=Anna|date=2017|title=TANGIBLE TRACES OF DEVOTION The Post-mortem Life of Relics|url=http://www.arkeologiskasamfundet.se/csa/Dokument/Volumes/csa_vol_25_2017/csa_vol_25_2017_s151-175_kjellstrom.pdf}}</ref> <ref name=Westerhof /> for several hours.<ref name=Schafer /> The boiling had the effect of separating the flesh from the [[Human skeleton|bone]]. The heart and intestines needed to be removed in order to allow for proper transfer of the bones. <ref name=":0" /> Any residual was scraped from the bones, leaving a completely clean [[skeleton]].<ref name=Schafer /> Both the flesh and [[Viscus|internal organs]] could be buried immediately, or [[Meat preservation|preserved]] with salt in the same manner as animal meat.<ref name=Westerhof /> The bones could then be sprinkled with perfumes or fragrances. <ref name=":2" />The bones, and any preserved flesh, would then be transported back to the deceased's home for ceremonial interment.<ref name=Schafer />

Mediaeval society generally regarded entrails as ignoble<ref name=Westerhof /> and there was no great solemnity attached to their disposal, especially among German aristocrats.<ref name=Schafer />

== Prohibition of the practice ==
Although the Church had a high regard for the practice, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] was known to have an especial repugnance of ''Mos Teutonicus'' because of his ideal of bodily integrity.<ref name=Westerhof /> In his bull of 1300, ''[[De Sepulturis]]'', Boniface forbade the practice.<ref name=Brown /> The [[papal bull]] issued which banned this practice was often misinterpreted as prohibition against human dissection. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=PARK|first=KATHARINE|date=1995|title=The Life of the Corpse: Division and Dissection in Late Medieval Europe|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24623559|journal=Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences|volume=50|issue=1|pages=111–132|issn=0022-5045}}</ref>This may have hindered anatomical research, if anatomists feared repercussions and punishment as a result of medical autopsies, but ''De Sepulturis'' only prohibited the act of ''Mos Teutonicus,'' not dissection in general (medieval physicians were known to have widely practiced dissection and autopsy, though most had an assistant perform the actual incisions and manipulations of cadavers<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=J. J.|date=January 1904|title=The Popes and the History of Anatomy|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18340817|journal=Medical Library and Historical Journal|volume=2|issue=1|pages=10–28|issn=0898-1868|pmc=1692152|pmid=18340817}}</ref>). The practice of Mos Teutonicus eventually stopped in the 15th century.<ref name=":0" />

== Bio-archeological Effects ==
The process of Mos Teutonicus often did not produce clean cuts during de-fleshing. As a result, it is noticed that nobles that had their bodies undergo Mos Teutonicus have cut marks on their bones from the de-fleshing process. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Carr|first=Gillian|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284046162_The_ritual_framework_of_excarnation_by_exposure_as_the_mortuary_practice_of_the_early_and_middle_Iron_Ages_of_central_southern_Britain|title=Reconstructing Iron Age Societies: New Approaches to British Iron Age|last2=Knüsel|first2=Christopher|publisher=Oxbow Monograph|year=1997}}</ref> Mos Teutonicus was also able to preserve the bones of higher class individuals better than lower class individuals.  The bones would not have been subject to outside elements so there is limited evidence of perhaps chew marking from animals.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jones|first=AG|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/40021151.pdf|title=Dealing with the Dead: Manipulation of the Body in the Mortuary Practices of Mesolithic North West Europe|year=2011}}</ref>  In addition, the bones were not subject to flesh decay and were boiled in either water of wine, preventing further degradation. <ref name=":0" /> Thus, the bones of higher class individuals were better preserved than lower class individuals.
