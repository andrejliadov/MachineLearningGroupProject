'''Observation''' is the active acquisition of [[information]] from a [[primary source]]. In living beings, observation employs the [[sense]]s. In [[science]], observation can also involve the [[perception]] and recording of [[data (information)|data]] via the use of [[scientific instrument]]s. The term may also refer to any data collected during the scientific activity. Observations can be [[qualitative property|qualitative]], that is, only the absence or presence of a property is noted, or [[quantitative data|quantitative]] if a numerical value is attached to the observed [[phenomenon]] by [[counting]] or [[measurement|measuring]].

# Ask a [[question]] about a natural [[phenomenon]]
# Make observations of the phenomenon

= Formulate a [[hypothesis]] that tentatively answers the question =
# [[prediction|Predict]] logical, observable [[consequent|consequences]] of the hypothesis that have not yet been investigated
# Test the hypothesis' predictions by an [[experiment]] , [[observational study]] , [[field research|field study]] , or [[simulation]]
# Draw a [[logical consequence|conclusion]] from [[data]] gathered in the experiment, or revise the hypothesis or form a new one and [[reproducibility|repeat]] the process
# Write a [[protocol (science)|descriptive method]] of observation and the [[result]]s or conclusions reached
# Have peers with experience researching the same phenomenon [[peer review|evaluate]] the results

Observations play a role in the second and fifth steps of the scientific method. However, the need for [[reproducibility]] requires that observations by different observers can be comparable. Human [[sense]] impressions are [[subjectivity|subjective]] and [[qualitative data|qualitative]], making them difficult to record or compare. The use of [[measurement]] developed to allow recording and comparison of observations made at different times and places, by different people. Measurement consists of using observation to compare the phenomenon being observed to a [[Standard (metrology)|standard unit]]. The standard unit can be an artifact, process, or definition which can be duplicated or shared by all observers.  In measurement the number of standard units which is equal to the observation is counted.  Measurement reduces an observation to a number which can be recorded, and two observations which result in the same number are equal within the [[measurement|resolution]] of the process.

Human senses are limited and subject to errors in perception, such as [[optical illusion]]s. [[Scientific instrument]]s were developed to aid human abilities of observation, such as [[weighing scale]]s, [[clock]]s, [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, [[thermometer]]s, [[camera]]s, and [[tape recorder]]s, and also translate into perceptible form events that are unobservable by the senses, such as [[pH indicator|indicator dyes]], [[voltmeter]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, [[infrared camera]]s, [[oscilloscope]]s, [[interferometer]]s, [[geiger counter]]s, and [[radio receiver]]s.

One problem encountered throughout scientific fields is that the observation may affect the process being observed, resulting in a different outcome than if the process was unobserved. This is called the ''[[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]]''. For example, it is not normally possible to check the air pressure in an automobile tire without letting out some of the air, thereby changing the pressure. However, in most fields of science it is possible to reduce the effects of observation to insignificance by using better instruments.

Considered as a physical process itself, all forms of observation (human or instrumental) involve [[amplifier|amplification]] and are thus thermodynamically [[irreversibility|irreversible processes]], increasing [[entropy]].

==Paradoxes==
In some specific fields of science the results of observation differ depending on factors which are not important in everyday observation.  These are usually illustrated with "[[paradox]]es" in which an event appears different when observed from two different points of view, seeming to violate "common sense".
* '''Relativity:''' In [[relativistic physics]] which deals with velocities close to the [[speed of light]], it is found that different observers may observe different values for the length, time rates, mass, and many other properties of an object, depending on the observer's velocity relative to the object.   For example, in the [[twin paradox]] one twin goes on a trip near the speed of light and comes home younger than the twin who stayed at home.  This is not a paradox: time passes at a slower rate when measured from a frame moving with respect to the object.  In relativistic physics, an observation must always be qualified by specifying the state of motion of the observer, its [[Frame of reference|reference frame]].
* '''Quantum mechanics:''' In [[quantum mechanics]], which deals with the behavior of very small objects, it is not possible to [[observer (quantum physics)|observe a system]] without changing the system, and the "observer" must be considered part of the [[system]] being observed. In isolation, quantum objects are represented by a [[wave function]] which often exists in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] or mixture of different [[quantum state|states]]. However, when an observation is made to determine the actual location or state of the object, it always finds the object in a single state, not a "mixture". The interaction of the observation process appears to "[[wave function collapse|collapse]]" the wave function into a single state. So any interaction between an isolated wave function and the external world that results in this wave function collapse is called an ''observation'' or ''measurement'', whether or not it is part of a deliberate observation process.

==Biases==
The human senses do not function like a video [[camcorder]], impartially recording all observations.<ref name="Shaw">{{cite web

What is kept and what is thrown away depends on an internal model or representation of the world, called by psychologists a ''[[schema (psychology)|schema]]'', that is built up over our entire lives.  The data is fitted into this schema.  Later when events are remembered, memory gaps may even be filled by "plausible" data the mind makes up to fit the model; this is called ''[[reconstructive memory]]''. How much attention the various perceived data are given depends on an internal value system, which judges how important it is to the individual. Thus two people can view the same event and come away with entirely different perceptions of it, even disagreeing about simple facts.  This is why [[eyewitness testimony]] is notoriously unreliable.

Several of the more important ways observations can be affected by human psychology are given below.

===Confirmation bias===
{{main|confirmation bias}}
Human observations are biased toward confirming the observer's conscious and unconscious expectations and view of the world; we "''see what we expect to see''".<ref name="Shermer">{{cite book

It can also result in erroneous scientific support for widely held cultural myths, on the other hand, as in the [[scientific racism]] that supported ideas of racial superiority in the early 20th century.<ref name="Gardner">{{cite book

 }}</ref> Correct scientific technique emphasizes careful recording of observations, separating experimental observations from the conclusions drawn from them, and techniques such as [[blind experiment|blind]] or [[double blind experiment]]s, to minimize observational bias.

===Processing bias===
Modern scientific instruments can extensively process "observations" before they are presented to the human senses, and particularly with computerized instruments, there is sometimes a question as to wherein the data processing chain "observing" ends and "drawing conclusions" begins. This has recently become an issue with [[digital image processing|digitally enhanced]] images published as experimental data in [[scientific paper|papers]] in [[scientific journal]]s. The images are enhanced to bring out features that the researcher wants to emphasize, but this also has the effect of supporting the researcher's conclusions. This is a form of bias that is difficult to quantify. Some [[scientific journal]]s have begun to set detailed standards for what types of [[image processing]] are allowed in research results. Computerized instruments often keep a copy of the "raw data" from sensors before processing, which is the ultimate defence against processing bias, and similarly, scientific standards require preservation of the original unenhanced "raw" versions of images used as research data.

==Philosophy==

{{quote|"Observe always that everything is the result of a change, and get used to thinking that there is nothing [[Nature]] loves so well as to change existing forms and to make new ones like them."|Meditations. iv. 36. – [[Marcus Aurelius]]}}

Observation in [[philosophical]] terms is the process of filtering [[sense|sensory]] [[information]] through the thought process. Input is received via [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[visual perception|sight]], [[olfaction|smell]], [[taste]], or [[Haptic perception|touch]] and then analyzed through either rational or irrational thought.


For example, let us suppose that an observer ''sees'' a parent beat their child; and consequently may observe that such an action is either good or bad. Deductions about what behaviors are good or bad may be based on preferences about building relationships, or study of the consequences resulting from the observed behavior. With the passage of time, impressions stored in the consciousness about many, together with the resulting relationships and consequences, permit the individual to build a construct about the moral implications of behavior.
