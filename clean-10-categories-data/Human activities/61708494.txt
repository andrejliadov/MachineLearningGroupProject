{{short description|Adverse effects of scuba diving on the marine environment}}
The '''environmental impact of recreational diving''' is the effects of diving tourism on the marine environment. Usually these are considered to be adverse effects, and include damage to reef organisms by incompetent and ignorant divers, but there may also be positive effects as the environment is recognised by the local communities to be worth more in good condition than degraded by inappropriate use, which encourages conservation efforts.

During the 20th century recreational scuba diving was considered to have generally low environmental impact, and was consequently one of the activities permitted in most marine protected areas. Since the 1970s diving has changed from an elite activity to a more accessible recreation, marketed to a very wide demographic. To some extent better equipment has been substituted for more rigorous training, and the reduction in perceived risk has shortened minimum training requirements by several training agencies. Training has concentrated on an acceptable risk to the diver, and paid less attention to the environment. The increase in the popularity of diving and in tourist access to sensitive ecological systems has led to the recognition that the activity can have significant environmental consequences.<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />

Scuba diving has grown in popularity during the 21st century, as is shown by the number of certifications issued worldwide, which has increased to about 23 million by 2016 at about one million per year.<ref name="Lucrezi 2016" /> Scuba diving tourism is a growth industry, and it is necessary to consider [[environmental sustainability]], as the expanding impact of divers can adversely affect the [[marine environment]] in several ways, and the impact also depends on the specific environment. Tropical coral reefs are more easily damaged by poor diving skills than some temperate reefs, where the environment is more robust due to rougher sea conditions and fewer fragile, slow-growing organisms. The same pleasant sea conditions that allow development of relatively delicate and highly diverse ecologies also attract the greatest number of tourists, including divers who dive infrequently, exclusively on vacation and never fully develop the skills to dive in an environmentally friendly way.<ref name="Dimmock et al 2013" /> [[Low impact diving]] training has been shown to be effective in reducing diver contact.<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />

== Types of impact ==

Research on the effects of divers on tropical coral reefs has shown reduced coral cover on heavily dived sites and a change in coral structure, with more resilient corals becoming dominant and a loss of species diversity over time. These reefs may be less resilient to other stressors like disease outbreaks and severe weather damage.<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />

There is persuasive evidence that reefs can be damaged and the amenity value of dive sites compromised by badly planned or over-intensive tourist use. Marine tourism affects reef communities directly through disturbance such as structural damage to corals, boats grounding on reefs and  damage by anchors, and indirectly through alteration of water quality by nutrient enrichment and pollution by toxic substances, waste water and increased turbidity. The level of degradation depends on the intensity, frequency, time and type of use and the specific environment.<ref name="Abidin and Mohamed 2014" />

Diver impact damage to corals includes skeletal breakage of branching species, tissue abrasion, possibly leading to infection by coral diseases, and an overall reduction of hard coral coverage on reefs. Diving related activities may also reduce the reef's resilience to reef stressors like climate change and bleaching events.<ref name="Roche et al 2016" />

In some frequently dived tropical coral reef sites recreational divers have caused negative ecological impacts by inadvertent impacts with live corals causing physical damage at a rate faster than compensated for by natural recovery. The long term result is reef degradation.<ref name="Toyoshima and Nadaoka 2015" /> One of the common challenges for local policy and management is maximising tourism benefits while also reducing environmental degradation to long-term sustainable levels.<ref name="Roche et al 2016" />

In the soft sediment bottomed "muck diving" environment, it was observed that photography causes greater environmental disturbances than effects caused by diving experience, certification level, gender or age. Divers came into contact with the substrate more often on soft sediment than on coral reefs, but environmental damage  was not greater. Divers tend to touch animals more frequently when observing or photographing cryptobenthic fauna, and spent up to five times linger in interactions when using dSLR-cameras. Long-term impacts  of this behaviour on cryptobenthic fauna and soft sediment habitats are unknown.<ref name="De Brauwer et al 2018" />

The impacts of photographer behaviour and photographic flashes on a small sample of benthic fish species was investigated. The study showed negligible effects beyond those caused by human presence alone. Flash photography caused no discernible ocular changes in seahorses and feeding success was not affected. Physical handling of animals produced strong stress responses.<ref name="De Brauwer et al 2019" />

Diver impact on subtropical, and particularly temperate reefs is less researched than tropical reefs. The perception is that these reefs are less vulnerable than tropical reefs and the sessile species are less exposed to diver impact. Research in the Mediterranean in Spain indicates that sessile organisms with fragile and brittle calcareous or corneous skeletons are not resilient to frequent disturbances by divers.<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />

Diver contact with the bottom is also prevalent on temperate reefs. One of the main forms mentioned is fin contact with the bottom sediment, raising particulate material into the water column and degrading visibility.<ref name="Luna et al" />

The impact of recreational scuba diving on recreational dive values and the cultural heritage of shipwrecks has been found to comprise four basic types:<ref name="Edney 2006" />
*The removal of artifacts and associated disturbance to wreck sites,
*Direct contact with wrecks and the benthic biota living on them by divers and their equipment, 
*Exhaled air bubbles trapped inside the wreckage,
*Impact damage by anchors of dive boats, considered by some researchers to be the most damaging form of impact associated with recreational wreck diving.

== Reasons for impact ==

Repetitive contact by divers and their equipment on the benthos is the general mechanism of reef degradation by recreational divers. Factors correlating with frequency of reef contact were found to be:<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />
*Interval since the previous dive
*Experience in terms of number of dives to date
*Location of certification training
*Awareness of marine park zoning
*Use of photographic equipment - photographers are more likely to contact the reef while their attention is focused on taking a photo.
*Depth of the dive
*Large groups of divers gathering at the beginning of a dive before they establish neutral buoyancy
Fin impacts have been identified as contributing the most to damage to reef biota, erect and branching hard corals are the most sensitive taxon to contact damage, and the severity of damage is influenced by habitat complexity.<ref name="Harriott et al 1997" /> This indicates that better diver trim, buoyancy and finning techniques, situational awareness of position relative to the reef, and awareness of the damage done by contact with corals in habitats where close proximity of fins to sensitive organisms is likely, are priorities for reducing damage. Training in low impact diving skills appears to significantly reduce contact with the benthos in divers of all certification and experience levels. This result can be extrapolated to other diving environments as a method to protect the environment and help to make recreational scuba diving more ecologically sustainable, and may enhance the diving experience.<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />

Several studies have found the main reason for contact by inexperienced divers to be poor buoyancy control.<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />
There appears to be little correlation between site topography and coral damage, but damage is related to coral morphology and structural strength. Most damage is to branching species which are inherently weaker against bending loads.<ref name="Rouphael and Inglis 1997" /><ref name="Roche et al 2016" />

Studies on recreational divers on tropical coral reefs have shown that the rate of contact between diver and environment varies significantly between divers who are able to maintain neutral buoyancy and those who are deficient in the skill, with divers who do not maintain neutral buoyancy contacting the reef more often. Briefing divers on the effects of contact with the reef reduced contact in divers with good buoyancy skills, but not in divers who lacked those skills. The problem appears to be one of competence. Without the necessary competence, divers are unable to modify their behaviour appropriately, and cannot produce the skills merely by being made aware of their necessity. The solution to reducing reef contact is in requiring the diver to have the skill before allowing them to dive in the environment where it is needed.<ref name="Toyoshima and Nadaoka 2015" />

There is evidence that the ability of dive guides to positively influence diver behaviour relating to reef contact is less for larger groups of divers, but the implementation of programmes which focus on dive industry operations can contribute to the reduction of anthropogenic reef damage.<ref name="Roche et al 2016" />

Some MPAs in the Mediterranean have prohibited scuba diving completely, or have restricted it to reefs near the boundaries of the MPA. Others have established diving trails which keep divers away from vulnerable areas. Another conservation strategy identified potentially vulnerable species and based the determination of sustainable numbers of visitors on this.<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />

Several studies have found that damage to coral reefs by divers can be minimized by modifying the behavior of those divers.<ref name="Abidin and Mohamed 2014" />

== Strategies for reducing diver impact ==
*Correct weighting - a prerequisite for good buoyancy control<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />
*Good buoyancy control - needed for level trim<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />
*Level trim - brings fins higher above benthos on most reefs<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />
*Reduction of dangling equipment - reduces risk of low-hanging items contacting reef when in close proximity<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />
*Awareness of proximity to surroundings - allows avoidance of movements which will result in reef contact, particularly high impact contact<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />
*Appropriate finning technique - finning technique should reduce risk of reef impact - select to suit lateral or vertical proximity<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />
*Understanding of ecological effects of reef contact - allows avoidance of particularly vulnerable organisms<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />
*Adjusting proximity to suit sea conditions - clearance between diver and benthos can be adjusted to allow acceptable risk of contact for variations in surge and current.

=== Low impact diving training ===
[[Low impact diving]] training has been shown to be effective in reducing diver contact.<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />

In 1989, Buoyancy Training Systems International, a company based in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], became the first organization in the world to create an internationally uniform, training and objective underwater test of skill  specifically designed to reduce diver impact upon the marine environment.<ref name="dive training">{{cite news|work=Dive Training|title=The Diamond Reef System|date=December 1992|author=Alex Brylske}}</ref><ref name="Justia patents">{{cite web|url=http://patents.justia.com/inventor/peter-a-wallingford|title=Patents by Inventor Peter A. Wallingford|last=Staff|year=2015|work=Justia patents website|publisher=Justia|accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref> The curriculum and mobile practice venue, now known as the [[Diamond Reef System]], used portable artificial reefs called ‘Diamond Reef Hover Stations' to raise the proficiency and awareness of divers at all stages of diver training including tropical resort acclimation dives.<ref name="dive training"/> This program remains in use by dive operators world-wide including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and [[Dutch Springs]], a commercial underwater recreation area in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] where divers can train and go on recreational dives.<ref name="global stamp news">{{cite news|work=The Global Stamp News|title=The World's First Marine Conservation Stamps|date=May 1995|author=Paul Enderle}}</ref><ref name="NJ Scuba">{{cite web|url=https://njscuba.net/reefs/chart_pa_dutch_springs.php|title=Dutch Springs Quarry|publisher=NJScuba.Net|accessdate= 10 December 2019}}</ref>

The specific PADI Low Impact Diver training program takes 2 days and appears to be effective for a large range of pre-existing skill and certification levels.<ref name="Hammerton 2014" /> Similar training from other providers should have similar results. Many of the skills are included in technical diver training, particularly cave and wreck diving,<ref name="Hammerton 2014" /> where they are also important for safety.

== Strategies for sustainable use management ==
Several methodologies have been developed with the intention of minimising the environmental impact of divers on coral reefs
*Carrying capacity approach.<ref name="Hammerton 2014" /> where the number of divers is restricted.<ref name="Roche et al 2016" /> This also limits tourism income from the region. Sustainable diver carrying capacity is influenced by factors which vary between sites. These include coral morphology, presence of vulnerable species, environmental awareness and competence of the divers, presence of other stressors, size of the dive site, reef topography, and sea conditions. Continuous adjustment may be necessary to account for changes, unknowns and inaccurate models.
*Limits of acceptable change. This model uses quantitative limits on change defined in specific management objectives for a site using an established baseline. It does not handle natural variation well if this is unknown, and cannot distinguish between causes of change, some of which may be unrelated to diving. In some cases an undisturbed baseline may not be available.<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />
*Percentile approach: This method considers a need for multiple reference sites and establishes trigger values quickly by comparing the extent of coral damage between dived sites and similar non-dived control sites. The trigger for management action is if the median abundance of damage to coral equals or exceeds the 80th percentile of damage at the reference sites. Limitations to this system include sensitivity to initial conditions - it does not work well if the reference sites are already significantly degraded, permanent moorings tend to concentrate damage to the region near the mooring, it may pick up false positives from damage from non-diver causes, and it is sensitive to conditions at the control sites.<ref name="Hammerton 2014" />
*Restricting recreational divers to delimited locations, which usually concentrates divers and damage along diving trails.<ref name="Roche et al 2016" /> This creates paths of degraded reef through the more pristine areas, and will cause customer dissatisfaction as the trail degrades further.
*Regulating the type of diving equipment allowed, generally accessories which are thought to increase reef contacts, such as gloves and cameras. These restrictions are understandably unpopular with photographers, and may be applied to both divers who manage to avoid contact and those who do not.<ref name="Roche et al 2016" /> Cost and complexity of photographic equipment does not correlate well with diving competence.
*Changing the methods by which the industry provides services: Closer supervision and intervention by dive guides can reduce diver contact rates where the divers are sufficiently skilled to modify their behaviour during the dive. It does not address basic incompetence, which is common. A pre-dive briefing on responsible behaviour, regulations and environmental values can reduce the rate of diver impacts where the divers are sufficiently competent to avoid contact. Experience was not found to be a strong indicator of competence, but inexperience and lack of regular or frequent practice are generally good indicators of poor buoyancy and trim skills. More effective interventions occur when the ratio of divers to guide is low.<ref name="Roche et al 2016" />

===Diver carrying capacity===
The number of dives over a time interval that results in an acceptable and stable level of degradation depends on a combination of factors that vary between sites. These include the presence of vulnerable organisms, and the stresses to which they are specifically vulnerable, the level of environmental awareness and responsibility of the divers, the diving skills and situational awareness of the divers, prevalent water conditions during dives, including currents and surge which increase difficulty of positional control, other anthropogenic stressors that may be present, and may combine their effects with diver impact, topographical details which affect diver maneuvering and risk of impact, and the size of the site. Continued periodical re-assessment will generally be necessary, even when there are no obvious large changes to external circumstances.<ref name="Abidin and Mohamed 2014" /> These factors may vary considerably even within a specific ecological zone, and may be expected to be very different between for example, a tropical coral reef dominated by branching stony corals on a gradually sloping bottom with persistent moderate wave action and continuous current, in an area far from major industry, and a high profile granite corestone temperate reef with deep gullies and steep ridges, dominated by kelp, ascidians and echinoderms, and with seasonal variations in prevailing wave direction near a large industrial city. The appropriate equipment and relevant skills will also vary, and unfamiliar rental equipment can require some practice before the diver can use it well. Divers in training can not be expected to perform at their best while distracted by learning new skills, and this is also a factor to be considered as a potential stressor if there is no separation between training sites and sites for qualified divers.
