In nautical [[navigation]] the '''absolute bearing''' is the [[clockwise]] angle between [[north]] and an object observed from the vessel.  If the north used as reference is the true geographical [[true north|north]] then the bearing is a ''true bearing'' whereas if the reference used is [[magnetic north]] then the bearing is a ''magnetic bearing''. 

An absolute bearing is measured with a [[bearing compass]].

The measurement of absolute bearings of fixed landmarks and other navigation aids is useful for the navigator because this information can be used on the [[nautical chart]] together with simple geometrical techniques to aid in determining the position of the vessel.
