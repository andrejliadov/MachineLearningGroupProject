British '''Entertainment in the 16th century''' included art, fencing, painting, the stocks and even executions.

While the 16th century and early 17th century squarely fall into the [[Renaissance]] period in Europe, that period was not only one of scientific and cultural advance, but also involved the development of changing forms of entertainment – both for the masses and for the elite.

Despite the great breadth of advancements in the arts during this time, the economic conditions of this period affected the types of entertainment available. There were three classes in society: A wealthy [[nobility]], a [[Bourgeoisie|merchant class]],  and the [[Peasant|peasantry]], who were typically poor.

==Aristocratic amusements==
The nobility could commission [[artisans]] to entertain them with works of art, music and theatre (Kareti, 1997).  They would also enjoy or participate in the sports of [[fencing]], [[falconry]], [[horse riding]] and [[hunting]]; they enjoyed extravagant parties and dances, attended the opera house, and had the best seats in the theater.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tudors: Entertainment|url=http://www.historyonthenet.com/Tudors/entertainment.htm|accessdate=24 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806073201/http://www.historyonthenet.com/Tudors/entertainment.htm|archive-date=6 August 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  At that time [[Cricket]] was also a game associated with the nobility.  In 1563, [[Lawrence Humphrey]] praised the five classic sports of Greece for the nobility – "whirling, leaping, casting the darte, wrestling, running" and derided "dauncing, fayninge to instrumentes, playe at dise, chesse, or tennes."<ref>[https://www.questia.com/read/109659971/sport-politics-and-literature-in-the-english-renaissance Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance]  Gregory M. Colón Semenza;  University of Delaware; 2003 229 pages pp 11 et seq</ref>

==Merchant merriment==
The middle class of [[merchants]], [[wright]]s, inn keepers and the like, would occasionally enjoy the fine arts, for example the theater. [[Blood sport]]s were popular – including [[bear baiting]], [[bull baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[Cockfight|cockfighting]]. Travelling troupes of actors entertained the masses. Enterprising [[bards]] would settle and build theaters – such as [[William Shakespeare]]’s [[Globe Theater]] (The Old Globe Theater History, 2005) in [[London, England|London]].

==Deprived diversions==
The poor could rarely afford the theater, generally having to stand as [[groundling]]s.  [[Executions]] were seen as a form of entertainment (Alchin, 2005), as was attending [[public humiliation]]s in the [[stocks]]. Another popular public event with spectators, was the [[Witch-hunt|witch trial]] by use of [[Trial by ordeal#Witch-hunts|water trial]].(Lambert, 2007).
