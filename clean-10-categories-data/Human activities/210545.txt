[[File:Industrialisation.jpg|thumb|Industrialisation]]
'''Industrialisation''' (or '''industrialization''') is the period of social and economic change that transforms a human group from an [[agrarian society]] into an [[industrial society]]. This involves an extensive re-organisation of an [[economy]] for the purpose of [[manufacturing]].<ref>{{cite book |last = O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |author-link = Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)|first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |title = Economics: Principles in Action |publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall |year = 2003 |location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458 |page = 472 |isbn = 0-13-063085-3 |oclc=50237774}}</ref> Historically industrialization is associated with increase of [[Pollution|polluting]] industries heavily dependent on [[fossil fuel]]s;  however, with the increasing focus on [[sustainable development]] and [[green industrial policy]] practices, industrialization increasingly includes [[Leapfrogging|technological leapfrogging]], with direct investment in more advanced, cleaner technologies.

The reorganization of the economy has many [[knock-on effect]]s both economically and socially. As industrial workers' incomes rise, markets for consumer goods and services of all kinds tend to expand and provide a further stimulus to industrial [[investment]] and [[economic growth]].  Moreover, family structures tend to shift as extended families tend to no longer live together in one household,location or place.

==Background==
{{Further|History of industrialisation}}
After the last stage of the [[Proto-industrialization]], the first transformation from an agricultural to an industrial economy is known as the [[Industrial Revolution]] and took place from the mid-18th to early 19th century in certain areas in [[Europe]] and North America; starting in Great Britain, followed by Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and France.<ref>Griffin, Emma, A short History of the British Industrial Revolution. In 1850 over 50 percent of the British lived and worked in cities. London: Palgrave (2010)</ref> Characteristics of this early industrialisation were technological progress, a shift from rural work to industrial labor, financial investments in new industrial structure, and early developments in class consciousness and theories related to this.<ref name=springer.com>{{Cite book |title=Sustainable Industrialization in Africa: Toward a New Development Agenda |doi=10.1007/978-1-137-56112-1_1b |publisher=Springer |date=2016}}{{Verify source|date=July 2019}}</ref> Later commentators have called this the First Industrial Revolution.<ref>Pollard, Sidney: Peaceful Conquest.The Industrialisation of Europe 1760–1970, Oxford 1981.</ref>

The "[[Second Industrial Revolution]]" labels the later changes that came about in the mid-19th century after the refinement of the [[steam engine]], the invention of the [[internal combustion engine]], the harnessing of [[electric power|electricity]] and the construction of canals, railways and electric-power lines. The invention of the [[assembly line]] gave this phase a boost.
Coal mines, steelworks, and textile factories replaced homes as the place of work.

== Industrialization in East Asia ==
Between the early 1960s and 1990s, the [[Four Asian Tigers]] underwent rapid industrialization and maintained exceptionally high growth rates.

==Social consequences==
The [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial revolution]] was accompanied with a great deal of changes on the social structure, the main change being a transition from farm work to factory related activities.<ref>{{Cite web|last=revolution|first=social|title=social effects of industrial revolution|url=https://www.google.com}}</ref> This resulted to creation of a class structure that differentiated the commoners from the well off and the working category.It distorted the family system as most people moved into cities and left the farm areas, consequently playing a major role in the transmission of diseases. The place of women in the society then shifted from being home cares to employed workers hence reducing the number of children per household. Furthermore industrialization contributed to increased cases of [[Child labour|child labor]] and thereafter education systems.<ref>{{Cite web|last=revolution|first=social|title=social effect of industrial revolution|url=https://abhiipedia.abhinamu.com}}</ref>

===Urbanisation===
{{Main|Urbanization|l1=Urbanisation}}
[[File:Guangzhou dusk panorama.jpg|thumb|Guangzhou dusk panorama]]
As the Industrial Revolution was a shift from the agrarian society, people migrated from villages in search of jobs to places where factories were established. This shifting of rural people led to urbanisation and increase in the population of towns. The concentration of labour in factories has increased urbanisation and the size of settlements, to serve and house the factory workers.

====Exploitation====
{{Main|Exploitation of labour|Exploitation of natural resources}}

==== China ====
China, along with many other areas of the world run by industrialization, has been affected by the world’s never ending rise of supply and demand. With the largest population in the world, China has become one of the main exporters of objects from household items to high technology appliances.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Lee|first=Robin|date=2016-09-26|title=Industrialization and Exploitation|url=https://medium.com/@robinlee_48716/industrialization-and-exploitation-b866cd5507e3|access-date=2020-06-30|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref>

===Changes in family structure===
Family structure changes with industrialisation. Sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] noted that in pre-industrial societies there is an [[extended family]] structure spanning many generations who probably remained in the same location for generations. In industrialised societies the [[nuclear family]], consisting of only parents and their growing children, predominates. Families and children reaching adulthood are more mobile and tend to relocate to where jobs exist. Extended family bonds become more tenuous.<ref>''[http://www.blacksacademy.net/content/3236.html The effect of industrialisation on the family, Talcott Parsons, the isolated nuclear family]'' {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120221546/http://blacksacademy.net/content/3236.html |date=20 November 2010 }} Black's Academy.

Nevertheless, repeated examples in history of apparently successful industrialisation (Britain, Soviet Union, South Korea, China, etc.) may make conventional industrialisation seem like an attractive or even natural path forward, especially as populations grow, [[consumerism|consumerist]] expectations rise and agricultural opportunities diminish.

The relationships among [[International Development#International Economic Inequality|economic growth, employment, and poverty reduction]] are complex. Higher [[productivity]], it is argued{{by whom|date=January 2018}}, may lead to lower [[employment rate|employment]] (see [[jobless recovery]]).<ref name=ODI2>Claire Melamed, Renate Hartwig and Ursula Grant 2011.

There are differences across [[economic sector|sector]]s, whereby manufacturing is less able than the [[tertiary sector]] to accommodate both increased productivity and employment opportunities; more than 40% of the world's employees are "[[working poor]]", whose incomes fail to keep themselves and their families above the $2-a-day [[poverty line]].<ref name=ODI2/> There is also a phenomenon of [[deindustrialisation]], as in the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]] countries' transition to market economies, and the [[agriculture sector]] is often the key sector in absorbing the resultant unemployment.<ref name=ODI2/>
