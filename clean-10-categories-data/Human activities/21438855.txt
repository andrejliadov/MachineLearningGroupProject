'''Mooning''' is the act of displaying one's bare [[buttocks]] by removing clothing, e.g., by lowering the backside of one's [[trousers]] and [[underpants]], usually bending over, whether also exposing the genitals or not. Mooning is used in the English speaking world <!-- see Talk:Mooning#geographic distribution --> to express [[protest]], [[Contempt|scorn]], [[disrespect]], or provocation, or can be done for [[shock value]], [[fun]], a [[joke]] or as a form of [[exhibitionism]]. 

Some jurisdictions regard mooning to be [[indecent exposure]], sometimes depending on the context.

==Word history==
''[[Moon]]'' has been a common shape metaphor for the [[buttocks]] in English since 1743, and the verb ''to moon'' has meant "to expose to (moon)light" since 1601.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nester |first=Daniel |title=How to be Inappropriate |publisher=Counterpoint Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-1593762537 |url=https://archive.org/details/howtobeinappropr00nest }}</ref> <!--, long before they were combined in US student slang in the verb(al expression) mooning "to flash the buttocks" in 1968. --> As documented by McLaren, "'mooning', or exposing one's butt to shame an enemy ... had a long pedigree in peasant culture" throughout the [[Middle Ages]], and in many nations.<ref name="McLaren">{{cite book|title=The Trials of Masculinity: Policing Sexual Boundaries, 1870-1930|first=Angus |last=McLaren |year=1997 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |page=186 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GHTeeteHH1UC&pg=PA186|isbn=9780226500690 }}</ref>
"Mooning" is also defined as "wandering idly" and "romantically pining".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=moon&searchmode=term |title=Moon |work=The Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref>

Although the practice of mooning was widespread by the 19th century, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates the use of "moon" and "mooning" to describe the act to student slang of the 1960s, when the gesture became increasingly popular among students at universities in the United States.<ref name=Slate>{{cite web|title=Mooning: A History|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/06/27/mooning_a_history_when_did_people_start_baring_their_butts_as_an_insult_.html|work=browbeat: Slate's culture blog|publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=July 11, 2012|author=Forrest Wickman|date=June 27, 2012}}</ref>

==Legal status==
The legal position related to mooning varies between [[Jurisdiction (area)|jurisdictions]]; some consider it [[indecent exposure]], while others classify it as legal self expression.

==In various countries and cultures==

===Australia===
====Victoria====
In January 2016, mooning in a public place in Victoria was made a criminal offence/something for which one could be punished.<ref>{{cite Legislation AU|Vic|num_act|caoa201647o2016349|Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2016|24}}.</ref>

===New Zealand===
'''{{lang|mi|Whakapohane}}''' is the [[Māori people|Māori]] practice of baring one's buttocks with the intent to offend. It symbolises the birthing act and renders the recipient ''[[Tapu (Polynesian culture)#Noa|noa]]'' ("base").<ref>{{cite web|title=Part 3 - A Collection of Behaviours, Philosophies, Emotions and Cultural Influences|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/publications-archived/2001/he-hinatore-ki-te-ao-maori-a-glimpse-into-the-maori-world/part-3-a-collection-of-behaviours-philosophies-emotions-and-cultural-influences/part-3-a-collection-of-behaviours-philosophies-emotions-and-cultural-influences|work=He Hinatore ki te Ao Maori: A Glimpse into the Maori World |date=March 2001|publisher=New Zealand Ministry of Justice|accessdate=17 September 2017}}</ref> In 1917, [[Mihi Kotukutuku Stirling]] stood on a [[marae]] (sacred area) at Rotorua and the chief of the [[Te Arawa]] tribes, [[Mita Taupopoki]], objected telling her that she must get off ''his'' marae as she was a woman. 

She stood her ground and when he had finished his objections she defended her position. She said that she was descended from a prior-born ancestor than the chief. She was not on ''his'' marae; she was on ''her'' marae. She exposed her genitals, telling the chief that that was where he came from. Those assembled were asked to gainsay her speech but no one came forward. The Maori gesture of {{lang|mi|whakapohane}} had countered the argument that was aimed at her.<ref name="Salmond2017">{{cite book|author=Anne Salmond|title=Tears of Rangi: Experiments Across Worlds|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXUsDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT526|date=24 July 2017|publisher=Auckland University Press|isbn=978-1-77558-923-5|pages=526–}}</ref>

===United States===

[[File:mooning.jpg|thumb|right|Students at [[Stanford University]] conduct a "mass mooning" in May 1995. This demonstration was in protest of [[censorship in the United States|censorship in the American media]].]]

In January 2006, a [[Maryland]] [[State court (United States)|state]] [[circuit court]] determined that mooning is a form of artistic expression protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as a form of [[freedom of speech|speech]].<ref name="Post">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/03/AR2006010301509.html |work=Washington Post |title=Mooning Deemed 'Disgusting' but No Crime in Md. |last=Londoño |first=Ernesto |page=B01 |publisher=The Washington Post Company |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|page=B6|title=Judge rules 'mooning' is not illegal in Md.|date=January 6, 2006|newspaper=[[Delaware News-Journal|The News Journal]], redistributed from the [[Associated Press]]}}</ref> 

The court ruled that [[indecent exposure]] relates only to exposure of the genitals, adding that even though mooning was a "disgusting" and "demeaning" act to engage in, and had taken place in the presence of a minor, "If exposure of half of the buttocks constituted indecent exposure, any woman wearing a [[thong]] at the beach at [[Ocean City, Maryland|Ocean City]] would be guilty."<ref name="Post"/>

Defense attorneys had cited a case from 1983 of a woman who was arrested after protesting in front of the [[United States Supreme Court building|U.S. Supreme Court building]] wearing nothing but a cardboard sign that covered the front of her body. In that case, the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] had ruled that indecent exposure is limited to a person's genitalia. No review of the case by a higher court took place since prosecutors dropped the case after the ruling.

In California, an appellate court found in December 2000 that mooning does not constitute indecent exposure (and, therefore, does not subject the defendant to [[sex offender]] registration laws) unless it can be proven beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct was sexually motivated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/california/caapp4th/85/937.html|title=In re Dallas W.
