Ishmael's mother was Agar, an Egyptian slave girl whom Sarah had as her maid and eventually donated to Abraham because this royal couple were aged and childless but they were unaware then of God's plan and Israel; in accordance with Mesopotamian law, the offspring of such a union would be credited to Sarah (Gn. 16:2). The name Yishma øe æl is known from various ancient Semitic cultures and means "God has hearkened," suggesting that a child so named was regarded as the answer to a request. Ishmael was circumcised at the age of thirteen by Abraham and expelled with his mother Agar at the instigation of Sarah, Abraham's wife, who wanted to ensure that Isaac would be Abraham's heir (Gn. 21). In the New Testament, Paul uses this incident to symbolize the relationship between Judaism and Christianity (Gal. 4:21‚Äì31). In the Genesis account, God blessed Ishmael, promising that he would be the founder of a great nation and a "wild ass of a man" always at odds with others (Gn. 16:12). So Abraham rose up in the morning, and taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee. [15] And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there.
Genesis chapter 21:
[16] And she went her way, and sat over against him a great way off as far as a bow can carry, for she said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting over against, she lifted up her voice and wept. [17] And God heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, saying: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not: for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is. [18] Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand: for I will make him a great nation. [19] And God opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink. [20] And God was with him: and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a young man, an archer.
[21] And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt. [22] At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army said to Abraham: God is with thee in all that thou dost. [23] Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger. [24] And Abraham said: I will swear. [25] And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water, which his servants had taken away by force.
[26] And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till today. [27] And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league. [28] And Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock. [29] And Abimelech said to him: What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set apart? [30] But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewe lambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this well.
[31] Therefore that place was called Bersabee: because there both of them did swear. [32] And they made a league for the well of oath. [33] And Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army arose and returned to the land of the Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee, and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal. [34] And he was a sojourner in the land of the Palestines many days.
[Genesis 21:1-34]Douay Rheims Bible.
He is credited with twelve sons, described as "princes according to their tribes" (Gn. 25:16), representing perhaps an ancient confederacy. The Ishmaelites, vagrant traders closely related to the Midianites, were apparently regarded as his descendants. The fact that Ishmael's wife and mother are both said to have been Egyptian suggests close ties between the Ishmaelites and Egypt. According to Genesis 25:17, Ishmael lived to the age of 137. Islamic tradition tends to ascribe a larger role to Ishmael than does the Bible. He is considered a prophet and, according to certain theologians, the offspring whom Abraham was commanded to sacrifice (although surah Judaism has generally regarded him as wicked, although repentance is also ascribed to him. According to some rabbinic traditions, his two wives were Aisha and Fatima, whose names are the same as those of Muhammad's wife and daughter Both Judaism and Islam see him as the ancestor of Arab peoples.

The Aramaic language, once dominant in the Fertile Crescent, survives in only a few remote villages and in the rituals of the Eastern churches. Coptic, the language of Christian Egypt before the Arab conquest, has been entirely replaced by Arabic except in the church liturgy.

{{Main|Pre-Islamic Arabia}}
{{History of the Arab States}}
Pre-Islamic Arabia refers to the Arabian Peninsula prior to the rise of Islam in the 630s. The study of Pre-Islamic Arabia is important to&nbsp;[[Islamic studies]] as it provides the context for the development of Islam. Some of the settled communities in the Arabian Peninsula developed into distinctive civilizations. Sources for these civilizations are not extensive, and are limited to archaeological evidence, accounts written outside of Arabia, and Arab oral traditions later recorded by Islamic scholars. Among the most prominent civilizations was [[Dilmun]], which arose around the 4th millennium BC and lasted to 538 BC, and [[Thamud]], which arose around the 1st millennium BC and lasted to about 300 CE. Additionally, from the beginning of the first millennium BC, [[South Arabia|Southern Arabia]] was the home to a number of kingdoms, such as the [[Sabaeans|Sabaean kingdom]], and the coastal areas of [[Eastern Arabia]] were controlled by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanians]] from 300 BC.

===Classical kingdoms===
{{main|Qedarites|Osroene|Nabataeans|Palmyra|Emesene dynasty|Kingdom of Hatra}}
[[File:Petra, Al-Khazneh 2.jpg|thumb| Fa√ßade of [[Al Khazneh]] in [[Petra]], Jordan, built by the [[Nabateans]].]]
Proto-Arabic, or [[Ancient North Arabian]], texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence. The earliest are written in variants of [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraphic]] south Arabian ''[[South Arabian alphabet|musnad]]'' script, including the 8th century BCE [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Hasaean]] inscriptions of eastern Arabia, the 6th century BCE [[Lihyanite]] texts of southeastern Saudi Arabia and the [[Thamudic]] texts found throughout the Arabian Peninsula and [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] (not in reality connected with [[Thamud]]).

The [[Nabataeans]] were nomads who moved into territory vacated by the [[Edomites]]&nbsp;‚Äì Semites who settled the region centuries before them. Their early inscriptions were in [[Aramaic]], but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The [[Nabataean alphabet]] was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by [[Safaitic]] inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from [[Qaryat al-Faw]] reveal a dialect no longer considered ''proto-Arabic'', but ''pre-classical Arabic''. Five [[Syriac language|Syriac]] inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at [[Sumatar Harabesi]], one of which dates to the 2nd century CE.

[[File:Temple of Bel, Palmyra 15.jpg|left|thumb|The ruins of Palmyra. The Palmyrenes were a mix of Arabs, [[Amorites]] and [[Arameans]].]]

[[File:NE 565ad.jpg|thumb|Near East in 565, showing the Lakhmids and their neighbors.]]
The [[Ghassanids]], [[Lakhmids]] and [[Kindites]] were the last major migration of pre-Islamic Arabs. The Ghassanids increased the Semitic presence in the then Hellenized [[Syria (Byzantine province)|Syria]], the majority of Semites were Aramaic peoples. They mainly settled in the [[Hauran]] region and spread to modern [[Lebanon]], Palestine and East Jordan.
[[File:Roman Empire 125 political map.svg|thumb|left|The [[imperial province]] of [[Arabia Petraea]] in 117‚Äì138 CE.]]
Greeks and Romans referred to all the nomadic population of the desert in the Near East as Arabi. The Romans called Yemen "[[Arabia Felix]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Dionysius Periegetes|url=http://www.cartographic-images.net/Cartographic_Images/117_Dionysius_Periegetes.html|website=www.cartographic-images.net}}</ref> The Romans called the vassal nomadic states within the [[Roman Empire]] ''[[Arabia Petraea]]'', after the city of [[Petra]], and called unconquered deserts bordering the empire to the south and east [[Arabia Magna]].

The [[Lakhmids]] as a dynasty inherited their power from the [[Tanukh]]ids, the mid Tigris region around their capital [[Al-Hira]]. They ended up allying with the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]] against the Ghassanids and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Lakhmids contested control of the Central Arabian tribes with the Kindites with the Lakhmids eventually destroying [[Kindah|Kinda]] in 540 after the fall of their main ally [[Himyar]]. The [[Persian people|Persian]] Sassanids dissolved the Lakhmid dynasty in 602, being under puppet kings, then under their direct control.<ref>Harold Bailey [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko_RafMSGLkC&pg=PR59 The Cambridge history of Iran: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods], Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 1983, {{ISBN|0-521-20092-X}} p. 59</ref>
The Kindites migrated from Yemen along with the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, but were turned back in Bahrain by the Abdul Qais [[Rabi`ah|Rabi'a]] tribe. They returned to Yemen and allied themselves with the Himyarites who installed them as a vassal kingdom that ruled Central Arabia from "Qaryah Dhat Kahl" (the present-day called Qaryat al-Faw). They ruled much of the Northern/Central Arabian peninsula, until they were destroyed by the Lakhmid king [[Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man|Al-Mundhir]], and his son [['Amr III ibn al-Mundhir|'Amr]].

After the death of [[Muhammad]] in 632, [[Rashidun army|Rashidun armies]] launched campaigns of conquest, establishing the [[Caliphate]], or Islamic Empire, one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. It was larger and lasted longer than the previous Arab empire of [[Mavia (queen)|Queen Mawia]] or the [[Arameans|Aramean]]-Arab [[Palmyrene Empire]]. The Rashidun state was a completely new state and unlike the Arab kingdoms of its century such as the [[Himyarite]], [[Lakhmids]] or [[Ghassanids]].

In 661, the Rashidun Caliphate fell into the hands of the [[Banu Umayya|Umayyad dynasty]] and [[Damascus]] was established as the empire's capital. The Umayyads were proud of their Arab identity and sponsored the poetry and culture of pre-Islamic Arabia. They established garrison towns at [[Ramla]], [[Raqqa]], [[Basra]], [[Kufa]], [[Mosul]] and [[Samarra]], all of which developed into major cities.<ref name="Lunde">{{Cite book|last=Lunde |first=Paul |title=Islam |year=2002 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishing |pages= 50‚Äì52 |location=New York |isbn=0-7894-8797-7 }}</ref>

[[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] established Arabic as the Caliphate's official language in 686.<ref>John Joseph Saunders, ''A history of medieval Islam'', Routledge, 1965, page 13</ref> This reform greatly influenced the conquered non-Arab peoples and fueled the [[Arabization]] of the region. However, the Arabs' higher status among non-Arab Muslim converts and the latter's obligation to pay heavy taxes caused resentment. Caliph [[Umar II]] strove to resolve the conflict when he came to power in 717. He rectified the disparity, demanding that all Muslims be treated as equals, but his intended reforms did not take effect, as he died after only three years of rule. By now, discontent with the Umayyads swept the region and an uprising occurred in which the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]s came to power and moved the capital to [[Baghdad]].

Umayyads expanded their Empire westwards capturing North Africa from the Byzantines. Before the Arab conquest, North Africa was conquered or settled by various people including [[Punics]], Vandals and Romans. After the [[Abbasid Revolution]], the Umayyads lost most of their territories with the exception of Iberia. Their last holding became known as the [[Emirate of C√≥rdoba]]. It wasn't until the rule of the grandson of the founder of this new emirate that the state entered a new phase as the [[Caliphate of C√≥rdoba]].  This new state was characterized by an expansion of trade, culture and knowledge, and saw the construction of masterpieces of [[al-Andalus]] architecture and the library of [[Al-·∏§akam II]] which housed over 400,000 volumes. With the collapse of the Umayyad state in 1031 AD, [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] was divided into small kingdoms.

The Abbasids were&nbsp;the descendants of&nbsp;[[Al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]], one of the youngest uncles of Muhammad and of the same&nbsp;[[Banu Hashim]]&nbsp;clan. The Abbasids led a revolt against the Umayyads and defeated them in the [[Battle of the Zab]] effectively ending their rule in all parts of the Empire with the exception of [[al-Andalus]]. In 762, the second Abbasid Caliph [[al-Mansur]] founded the city of [[Baghdad]] and declared it the capital of the Caliphate. Unlike the Umayyads, the Abbasids had the support of non-Arab subjects.<ref name="Lunde" />

The [[Islamic Golden Age]] was inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the Abbasid Caliphate and the transfer of the capital from [[Damascus]] to the newly founded city of [[Baghdad]]. The Abbassids were influenced by the [[Qur'an]]ic injunctions and [[hadith]] such as "The ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of martyrs" stressing the value of knowledge. During this period the [[Muslim world]] became an intellectual centre for science, philosophy, medicine and education as the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the "[[House of Wisdom]]" ({{Lang-ar|ÿ®Ÿäÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÉŸÖÿ©}}) in Baghdad. Rival dynasties such as the [[Fatimid]]s of [[Egypt]] and the [[Umayyad]]s of [[al-Andalus]] were also major intellectual centres with cities such as [[Cairo]] and [[C√≥rdoba, Spain|C√≥rdoba]] rivaling [[Baghdad]].<ref name="Vartan">Vartan Gregorian, "Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith", Brookings Institution Press, 2003, pg 26‚Äì38 {{ISBN|0-8157-3283-X}}</ref>

The Abbasids ruled for 200 years before they lost their central control when [[Wilayah|Wilayas]] began to fracture in the 10th century; afterwards, in the 1190s, there was a revival of their power, which was ended by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], who [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|conquered Baghdad]] in 1258 and killed the Caliph [[Al-Musta'sim]]. Members of the Abbasid royal family escaped the massacre and resorted to Cairo, which had broken from the Abbasid rule two years earlier; the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] generals taking the political side of the kingdom while Abbasid Caliphs were engaged in civil activities and continued patronizing science, arts and literature.

===Fatimid Caliphate (909‚Äì1171)===

The Fatimid caliphate was founded by [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah|al-Mahdi Billah]], a descendant of [[Fatimah]], the daughter of Muhammad, in the early 10th century. Egypt was the political, cultural, and religious centre of the Fatimid empire. The Fatimid state took shape among the [[Kutama]] Berbers, in the West of the North African littoral, in Algeria, in 909 conquering [[Raqqada]], the [[Aghlabid]] capital. In 921 the Fatimids established the Tunisian city of [[Mahdia]] as their new capital. In 948 they shifted their capital to [[Mansouria, Tunisia|Al-Mansuriya]], near [[Kairouan]] in Tunisia, and in 969 they conquered Egypt and established [[Cairo]] as the capital of their caliphate.

Intellectual life in Egypt during the Fatimid period achieved great progress and activity, due to many scholars who lived in or came to Egypt, as well as the number of books available. Fatimid Caliphs gave prominent positions to scholars in their courts, encouraged students, and established libraries in their palaces, so that scholars might expand their knowledge and reap benefits from the work of their predecessors.<ref name="imamreza.net">Shorter Shi'ite Encyclopaedia, By: Hasan al-Amin, http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=574 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616060639/http://imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=574 |date=2010-06-16 }}</ref> The Fatimids were also known for their exquisite arts. Many traces of [[Fatimid architecture]] exist in Cairo today; the most defining examples include the [[Al-Hakim Mosque]] and the [[Al-Azhar University]].

It was not until the 11th century that the [[Maghreb]] saw a large influx of ethnic Arabs. Starting with the 11th century, the Arab bedouin [[Banu Hilal]] tribes migrated to the West. Having been sent by the [[Fatimids]] to punish the Berber [[Zirids]] for abandoning [[Shia Islam|Shias]], they travelled westwards. The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring [[Hammadid]]s. According to some modern historians. their influx was a major factor in the arabization of the Maghreb.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&q=arabization+tribes+maghreb+banu+hilal&pg=PA668|title=Encyclopedia of African History 3-Volume Set|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|date=4 July 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135456702|location=|pages=668|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MVQlDQAAQBAJ&q=arabization+tribes+maghreb+banu+hilal&pg=PA42|title=Poems for the Millennium, Volume Four: The University of California Book of North African Literature|last1=Joris|first1=Pierre|last2=Tengour|first2=Habib|date=2012|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=9780520269132|location=|pages=42|language=en}}</ref> Although Berbers ruled the region until the 16th century (under such powerful dynasties as the [[Almoravids]], the [[Almohads]], [[Hafsids]], etc.).

From 1517 to 1918, much of the Arab world was under the suzerainty of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans defeated the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate. Arabs did not feel the change of administration because the Ottomans modeled their rule after the previous Arab administration systems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1911, Arab intellectuals and politicians from throughout the Levant formed [[al-Fatat]] ("the Young Arab Society"), a small Arab nationalist club, in Paris. Its stated aim was "raising the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations." In the first few years of its existence, al-Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire. Al-Fatat hosted the [[Arab Congress of 1913]] in Paris, the purpose of which was to discuss desired reforms with other dissenting individuals from the Arab world. However, as the Ottoman authorities cracked down on the organization's activities and members, al-Fatat went underground and demanded the complete independence and unity of the Arab provinces.<ref name="Choueiri166">Choueiri, pp.166‚Äì168.</ref>

After [[World War I]], when the [[Ottoman Empire]] was overthrown by the [[British Empire]], former Ottoman colonies were divided up between the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s.

==Modern period==
{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}
Arabs in modern times live in the Arab world, which comprises 22 countries in [[Western Asia]], [[North Africa]], and parts of the [[Horn of Africa]]. They are all modern states and became significant as distinct political entities after the fall and [[defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]].
