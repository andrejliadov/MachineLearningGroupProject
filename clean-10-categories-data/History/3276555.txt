{{short description|Aspect of history}}
The '''history of communication''' technologies (media and appropriate inscription tools) have evolved in tandem with shifts in political and economic systems, and by extension, systems of power. Communication can range from very subtle processes of exchange, to full conversations and mass communication. The history of communication itself can be traced back since the [[origin of speech]] circa 500,000 BCE{{fact| reason=see discussion|date=October 2020}}. The use of technology in communication may be considered since the first use of symbols about 30,000 years BCE. Among the symbols used, there are [[cave paintings]], [[petroglyphs]], [[pictograms]] and [[ideograms]]. [[History of writing|Writing]] was a major innovation, as well as [[History of printing|printing technology]] and, more recently, [[History of telecommunication|telecommunications]] and the [[History of the Internet|Internet]].

== Primitive times ==

Human communication was revolutionized with the [[origin of speech]] approximately 500,000 BCE{{fact|date=October 2020}}. Symbols were developed about 30,000 years ago. The imperfection of speech, which nonetheless allowed easier dissemination of ideas and eventually resulted in the creation of new forms of communications, improving both the range at which people could communicate and the longevity of the information. All of those inventions were based on the key concept of the symbol.

The oldest known  symbols created for the purpose of communication were [[cave paintings]], a form of [[rock art]], dating to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] age. The oldest known cave painting is located within [[Chauvet Cave]], dated to around 30,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]].<ref name="Paul Martin Lester"/> These paintings contained increasing amounts of information: people may have created the first [[calendar]] as far back as 15,000 years ago.<ref name="rappenglueck"/> The connection between drawing and writing is further shown by [[linguistics]]: in  [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Greece]] the concepts and words of drawing and writing were one and the same (Egyptian: 's-sh', Greek: 'graphein').<ref name="David Diringer BBP"/>

==Petroglyphs==
{{Details|Petroglyphs}}
[[File:Haljesta.jpg|thumb|right|92x92px|Petroglyphs from [[Häljesta]], Sweden. Nordic [[Bronze Age]] ]]

The next advancement in the history of communications came with the production of [[petroglyph]]s, carvings into a rock surface. It took about 20,000 years for homo sapiens to move from the first cave paintings to the first petroglyphs, which are dated to approximately the Neolithic and late Upper Paleolithic boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.

It is possible that Homo sapiens (humans) of that time used some other forms of communication, often for [[mnemonic]] purposes - specially arranged stones, symbols carved in wood or earth, [[quipu]]-like ropes, [[tattoo]]s, but little other than the most durable carved stones has survived to modern times and we can only speculate about their existence based on our observation of still existing 'hunter-gatherer' cultures such as those of [[Africa]] or [[Oceania]].<ref name="David Diringer HotA"/>

==Pictograms==
{{Details|Pictograms}}
[[File:Piktograf1.png|thumb|right|150px|Pictograph from 1510 telling a story of coming of [[missionaries]] to [[Hispaniola]] ]]

A [[pictogram]] (pictograph) is a [[symbol]] representing a [[concept]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], activity, place or event by [[illustration]]. Pictography is a form of [[proto-writing]] whereby [[idea]]s are transmitted through [[drawing]]. Pictographs were the next step in the evolution of communication: the most important difference between petroglyphs and pictograms is that petroglyphs are simply showing an event, but
pictograms are telling a story about the event, thus they can for example be ordered [[chronological]]ly.

Pictograms were used by various ancient [[culture]]s all over the world since around 9000&nbsp;BC, when tokens marked with simple pictures began to be used to label basic farm produce, and become increasingly popular around 6000–5000&nbsp;BC.

They were the basis of [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] <ref name="Linguistics 201: The Invention of Writing"/> and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]], and began to develop into [[logogram|logographic]] [[writing system]]s around 5000&nbsp;BC.

==Ideograms==
{{Details|Ideograms}}
[[File:Our Father in heaven - Mikmaq hierogl.gif|frame|right|The beginning of the Lord's Prayer in [[Míkmaq hieroglyphic writing]]. The text reads ''Nujjinen wásóq'' – "Our father / in heaven".]]

Pictograms, in turn, evolved into ideograms, graphical symbols that represent an [[idea]]. Their ancestors, the pictograms, could represent only something resembling their form: therefore a pictogram of a circle could represent a sun, but not concepts like 'heat', 'light', 'day' or 'Great God of the Sun'. Ideograms, on the other hand, could convey more abstract concepts, so that for example an ideogram of two sticks can mean not only 'legs' but also a verb 'to walk'.

Because some ideas are universal, many different cultures developed similar ideograms. For example, an eye with a tear means 'sadness' in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ideograms in [[California]], as it does for the [[Aztec]]s, the early [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Ideograms were precursors of [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] such as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and [[Chinese character]]s. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Examples of ideographical proto-writing systems, thought not to contain language-specific information, include the [[Vinca script]] (see also [[Tărtăria tablets]]) and the early [[Indus script]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In both cases there are claims of decipherment of linguistic content, without wide acceptance. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Writing==
{{Details|History of writing}}

===Early scripts===
The oldest-known forms of writing were primarily [[logogram|logographic]] in nature, based on [[pictogram|pictographic]] and [[ideogram|ideographic]] elements. Most writing systems can be broadly divided into three categories: ''logographic'', ''syllabic'' and ''alphabetic'' (or ''segmental''); however, all three may be found in any given writing system in varying  proportions, often making it difficult to categorise a system uniquely.

The invention of the first [[writing system]]s is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]] of the late 4000&nbsp;BC. The first writing system is generally believed to have been invented in pre-historic [[Sumer]] and developed by the late [[3rd millennium BC|3000's&nbsp;BC]] into [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]]. [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], and the undeciphered [[Proto-Elamite]] writing system and [[Indus script|Indus Valley script]] also date to this era, though a few scholars have questioned the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] script's status as a writing system.

The original Sumerian writing system was derived from a system of [[clay]] [[Token coin|tokens]] used to represent [[commodities]]. By the end of the 4th millennium&nbsp;BC, this had evolved into a method of keeping [[Account (accountancy)|accounts]], using a round-shaped [[stylus]] impressed into soft clay at different angles for recording [[number]]s. This was gradually augmented with pictographic writing using a sharp stylus to indicate what was being counted. Round-stylus and sharp-stylus writing was gradually replaced about 2700–2000&nbsp;BC by writing using a wedge-shaped stylus (hence the term [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]]), at first only for [[logogram]]s, but developed to include [[phonetic]] elements by the 2800&nbsp;BC. About 2600&nbsp;BC cuneiform began to represent syllables of spoken [[Sumerian language]].

Finally, cuneiform writing became a general purpose writing system for [[logogram]]s, [[syllable]]s, and numbers. By the 26th century&nbsp;BC, this script had been adapted to another Mesopotamian language, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], and from there to others such as [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]. Scripts similar in appearance to this writing system include those for [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]].

The [[Chinese script]] may have originated independently of the Middle Eastern scripts, around the 16th century&nbsp;BC (early [[Shang Dynasty]]), out of a late neolithic Chinese system of proto-writing dating back to c. 6000&nbsp;BC. The pre-Columbian writing systems of the [[Americas]], including [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script|Mayan]], are also generally believed to have had independent origins.

===Alphabet===
{{Details|History of the alphabet}}
[[File:A Specimen by William Caslon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A Specimen'' of typeset fonts and languages, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''.]]

The first pure [[alphabet]]s (properly, "[[abjad]]s", mapping single symbols to single phonemes, but not necessarily each [[phoneme]] to a symbol) emerged around 2000&nbsp;BC in [[Ancient Egypt]], but by then alphabetic principles had already been incorporated into [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s for a millennium (see [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets]]).

By 2700&nbsp;BC, Egyptian writing had a set of some [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Uniliteral signs|22 hieroglyphs]] to represent syllables that begin with a single [[consonant]] of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. These [[glyph]]s were used as pronunciation guides for [[logogram]]s, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names.

However, although seemingly alphabetic in nature, the original Egyptian uniliterals were not a system and were never used by themselves to encode Egyptian speech. In the [[Middle Bronze Age]] an apparently "alphabetic" system is thought by some to have been developed in central [[Egypt]] around 1700&nbsp;BC for or by [[Semitic people|Semitic]] workers, but we cannot read these early writings and their exact nature remains open to interpretation.

Over the next five centuries this Semitic "alphabet" (really a [[syllabary]] like [[Phoenician writing]]) seems to have spread north. All subsequent alphabets around the world{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} with the sole exception of Korean [[Hangul]] have either descended from it, or been inspired by one of its descendants.

Scholars agree that there is a relationship between the West-Semetic alphabet and the creation of the Greek alphabet. There is debate between scholars regarding  the earliest uses of the Greek alphabet because of the changes that were made to create the Greek alphabet.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Naveh|first=Joseph|date=1973|title=Some Semitic Epigraphical Considerations on the Antiquity of the Greek Alphabet|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=77|issue=1|pages=1–8|jstor=503227|doi=10.2307/503227}}</ref>

The Greek alphabet had the following characteristics:

# The Greek lettering we know of today traces back to the eighth century B.C.
# Early Greek scripts used the twenty-two West-Semetic letters, and included five supplementary letters.
# Early Greek was not uniform in structure, and had many local variations. 
# The Greek lettering was written using a lapidary style of writing.
# Greek was written in a [[boustrophedon]] style.

Scholars believe that at one point in time, early Greek scripts were very close to the West-Semetic alphabet. Over time, the changes that were made to the Greek alphabet were introduced as a result of the need for the Greeks to find a better way to express their spoken language in a more accurate way.<ref name=":1" />

=== Storytelling ===
Verbal communication is one of the earliest forms of human communication, the oral tradition of storytelling has dated back to various times in history. The development of communication in its oral form can be categorized based on certain historical periods. The complexity of oral communication has always been reflective based on the circumstance of the time period. Verbal communication was never bound to one specific area, instead, it had and continues to be a globally shared tradition of communication.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Oral communication: short history and some rules|journal = Giornale Italiano di Nefrologia |volume = 32|issue = 2|last=Panini, et al. Fiorini|first=R, et al. F|date=March–April 2015|pmid = 26005935}}</ref> People communicated through song, poems, and chants, as some examples. People would gather in groups and pass down stories, myths, and history. Oral poets from Indo-European regions were known as "weavers of words" for their mastery over the spoken word and ability to tell stories.<ref>{{Cite book|title=http://worldcat.org/oclc/875096147|last=Woodward|first=Roger|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107731905}}</ref> Nomadic people also had oral traditions that they used to tell stories of the history of their people to pass them on to the next generation.

Nomadic tribes have been the torch bearers oral storytelling. Nomads of Arabia are one example of the many nomadic tribes that have continued through history to use oral storytelling as a tool to tell their histories and the story of their people. Due to the nature of nomadic life, these individuals were often left without architecture and possessions to call their own, and often left little to no traces of themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=aa94|title=History of the Arabs|website=History World}}</ref> The richness of the nomadic life and culture is preserved by early Muslim scholars who collect the poems and stories that are handed down from generation to generation. Poems created by these Arabic nomads are passed down by specialists known as [[sha'ir]]. These individuals spread the stories and histories of these nomadic tribes, and often in times of war, would strengthen moral within members of given tribes through these stories.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In its natural form, oral communication was, and has continued to be one of the best ways for humans to spread their message, history, and traditions to the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}
