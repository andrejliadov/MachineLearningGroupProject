On that Tuesday morning, 19 [[terrorism|terrorists]] from the [[Islamist]] militant group [[al-Qaeda]] [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] four passenger jets. The hijackers intentionally crashed two planes, [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and [[United Airlines Flight 175]], into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in New York City; both towers collapsed within two hours. Hijackers crashed [[American Airlines Flight 77]] into [[the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]]. The fourth jet, [[United Airlines Flight 93]], crashed into a field near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], after passengers attempted to take control before it could reach the hijacker's intended target in Washington, D.C. [[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|Nearly 3,000 died in the attacks]], and the [[9/11 attacks]] have had broad and lasting consequences to military policy, politics, and foreign relations.
