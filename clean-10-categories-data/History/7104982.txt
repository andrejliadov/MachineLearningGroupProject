[[File:Auschwitz 1.jpg|thumb|First young Austrian started in [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum|Auschwitz]] on [[Invasion of Poland|September 1]] 1992]]
The prize is annually conferred to a person or an institution, which has shown special endeavors for the memory of the [[The Holocaust|Shoa]].

== Background ==
Since 1992 Austria has annually sent young Austrians abroad to serve in form of [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service | Austrian Holocaust Memorial Servants]] in many places around the world remembering the crimes of [[Nazism]] and commemorating its victims. Example partner institutions are the [[Auschwitz Jewish Center]] in Poland, [[Yad Vashem]] in Israel, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Centre]] in the United States, the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]] in Germany, the [[Jewish Holocaust Centre]] in Australia, the [[Russian Research and Educational Holocaust Center]] in Russia and the [[Center of Jewish Studies Shanghai]] in China. This service is rooted in responsibility for the crimes committed by the Austrian [[Nazism|National Socialists]].
