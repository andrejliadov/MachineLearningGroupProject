{{short description|Anti-Islamic pseudohistorical claim}}
The postulation that '''[[Allah]]''' (the name of [[God in Islam]]) historically originates as the [[moon deity]] [[Al-Lat]] (who was worshipped in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]]) originates in early 20th-century scholarship, most prominently advocated by [[Evangelicalism in the United States|American evangelicals]] from the 1990s.<ref>Judith Mendelsohn Rood, [http://neareastupdate.blogspot.my/2008/03/response-to-richard-john-neuhaus-public.html A Response to Richard John Neuhaus, Public Square Comment “Islam and Christianity: Changing the Subject” ''First Things'' (February 2008){{unreliable source?|date=August 2018}}] in ''Near East Update'', retrieved July 10, 2017</ref><ref>Danios, [http://www.loonwatch.com/2011/06/my-god-is-better-than-yours-ii-robert-morey-the-fake-doctor-behind-the-allah-is-the-moon-god-theory/ My God is Better Than Yours (II): Robert Morey, The Fake Doctor Behind the “Allah is the Moon-God” Theory{{unreliable source?|date=August 2018}}] in ''Loon Watch'', retrieved July 10, 2017</ref>

The idea was proposed by archeologist [[Hugo Winckler]] in 1901.
It was widely propagated in the United States in the 1990s, first via the publication of [[Robert Morey (pastor)|Robert Morey]]'s pamphlet ''The Moon-god Allah: In Archeology of the Middle East'' (1994),  eventually followed by his book ''The Islamic Invasion: Confronting the World's Fastest-Growing Religion'' (2001). 
Morey's ideas were popularised by cartoonist and publisher [[Jack Chick]], who drew a fictionalised cartoon story entitled "Allah Had No Son" in 1994.<ref>Jack T. Chick, [http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0042/0042_01.asp "Allah Had No Son"], Chick Publications (1994)</ref>{{or inline|Reason=This is just a link to the cartoon, it doesn't specify that it was the source of the popularity|date=August 2018}}

Morey argues that "Allah" was the name of a moon goddess in pre-Islamic [[Arabic mythology]], the implication being that "Allah" as the term for [[God in Islam]] implies that Muslims worship a different deity than the Judeo-Christian one. The use of a [[lunar calendar]] and the prevalence of crescent moon imagery in Islam is said by some to be the origin of this hypothesis.<ref>''A History of Pagan Europe''.

==Evidence adduced==
{{synthesis|date=May 2018}}

===Etymology===
{{main|Allah}}
The word ''Allah'' predates Islam. As Arthur Jeffrey states:
{{blockquote|The name ''Allah'', as the Quran itself is witness, was well known in pre-Islamic [[Arabia]]. Indeed, both it and its feminine form, [[Allat]], are found not infrequently among the theophorous names in inscriptions from North Arabia.<ref>A. Jeffrey, ''Islam: Mohammed and His Religion'', Liberal Arts Press. 1958.
ASIN: B000IXMTE4 pp. 85</ref>}} The 19th-century scholar [[Julius Wellhausen]] also viewed the concept of ''Allah'' (''al-ilah'', the god)" to be "a form of abstraction" originating from Mecca's local gods.<ref>''Studies on Islam''. Merlin L. Swartz. University Press, 1981. {{ISBN|0-19-502716-7}} pp.12</ref>

Hebrew words for God include [[El (deity)|El]] and [[Eloah]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Maimonides|title=Mishneh Torah, Yesodei ha-Torah §6:2|url=http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1106.htm}}</ref> [[SOAS]] Professor [[Alfred Guillaume]] notes that the term ''al-ilah'' (the god) ultimately derives from the Semitic root used as a generic term for divinity.
{{blockquote|The oldest name for a god used in the Semitic world consists of but two letters, the consonant 'L' preceded by a smooth breathing, which was pronounced 'IL' in ancient Babylonia, 'El' (Eloh, Elohim) in ancient Israel. The relation of this name, which in Babylonia and Assyria (Alaha, Eloah) in Aramaic Syriac became a generic term simply meaning 'god', to the Arabian ''Ilah'' familiar to us in the form ''Allah'', which is compounded of ''al'', the definite article, and ''Ilah'' by eliding the vowel 'i', is not clear.}}

Guillaume notes that some scholars have argued that the epithet "the god" was first used as a title of a moon god, but this is purely "antiquarian" in the same sense as the origins of the English word "god":

{{blockquote|Some scholars trace the name to the South Arabian Ilah, a title of the Moon god, but this is a matter of antiquarian interest...It is clear from Nabataean and other inscriptions that Allah meant 'the god'.<ref>Alfred Guillaume. ''Islam''. Penguin 1990 {{ISBN|0-14-013555-3}} pp.7</ref>}}

The word "Allah" was used by [[Arabic-speaking Christians]] and [[Arab Jews|Jews in Arabia]] before the lifetime of [[Muhammad]] and is the translation of the phrase "The God" as used in their Greek scriptures to mean God.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allah |title=Allah |author=Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-Webster |access-date=25 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420121231/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allah |archive-date=2014-04-20 }}</ref> It was also used by pre-Muslim Arab monotheists known as [[hanif]]s.<ref>Timothy C. Tennent, ''Theology in the Context of World Christianity'', Zondervan, 2009.</ref>

===Lunar calendar===
{{see|Islamic calendar}}
The moon plays a significant role in Islam because of the use of a lunar [[Islamic calendar]] to determine the date of [[Ramadan]]. The crescent moon, known as [[Hilal (crescent moon)|Hilal]], defines the start and end of Islamic months as it did for the [[Babylonian calendar]]. The need to determine the precise time of the appearance of the hilal was one of the inducements for Muslim scholars to study astronomy.<ref>[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e845?_hi=10&_pos=1 ''Hilal''] - Oxford Islamic Studies Online</ref> The [[Quran]] emphasises that the moon is a sign of God, not itself a god.<ref>Mohd Elfie Nieshaem Juferi, [https://www.bismikaallahuma.org/polemical-rebuttals/what-is-the-significance-of-the-crescent-moon-in-islam/ What is the Significance of the Crescent Moon in Islam?], in ''Bismika Allahuma'', October 12, 2005</ref>

===Crescent moon imagery===
{{see|Crescent|Star and crescent}}
[[File:Flag of Turkey.svg|thumb|The [[Flag of Turkey]] with a white star and crescent against a red background]]

The crescent moon symbol used as a form of [[blazon]] is not a feature of early Islam, as would be expected if it were linked to Pre-Islamic pagan roots. The use of the crescent symbol on Muslim flags originates during the later Middle Ages.<ref name="Star and crescent">[[Star and crescent]]</ref> 14th-century Muslim flags with an upward-pointing crescent in a monocolor field included the flags of [[Gabes]], [[Tlemcen]] (Tilimsi), [[Damas and Lucania]], [[Cairo]], [[Mahdia]], [[Tunis]] and [[Buda]].<ref>Znamierowski ''Flags through the ages: A guide to the world of flags, banners, standards and ensigns'', (2000) section 'the Muslim crescent', cited by Ivan Sache, [http://www.allstates-flag.com/fotw/flags/tn-hist.html#14th FOTW] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322065301/http://www.allstates-flag.com/fotw/flags/tn-hist.html#14th |date=2016-03-22 }},  11 March 2001</ref>

[[Franz Babinger]] alludes to the possibility that the crescent was adopted from the [[Eastern Romans]], noting that the crescent alone has a much older tradition also with Turkic tribes in the interior of Asia.<ref>"It seems possible, though not certain, that after the conquest [[Mehmed]]{{siadn|date=October 2020}} took over the crescent ''and'' star as an emblem of sovereignty from the Byzantines. The half-moon alone on a blood red flag, allegedly conferred on the [[Janissaries]] by [[Orhan|Emir Orhan]], was much older, as is demonstrated by numerous references to it dating from before 1453. But since these flags lack the star, which along with the half-moon is to be found on [[Sassanid]] and Byzantine municipal coins, it may be regarded as an innovation of Mehmed. It seems certain that in the interior of Asia tribes of Turkish nomads had been using the half-moon alone as an emblem for some time past, but it is equally certain that crescent and star ''together'' are attested only for a much later period. There is good reason to believe that old Turkish and Byzantine traditions were combined in the emblem of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and, much later, present-day Republican Turkish sovereignty." Franz Babinger (William C. Hickman Ed., Ralph Manheim Trans.), ''Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time'', Princeton University Press, 1992, p 108</ref> [[John Denham Parsons|Parsons]] considers this unlikely, as the star and crescent was not a widespread motif in the Eastern Roman Empire at the time of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=John Denham|title=The Non-Christian Cross|publisher=BiblioBazaar|year=2007|p=69|quote=Moreover, the question is what the symbol of Constantinople was at the time it was captured by the Turks. And an inspection of the coins issued by the Christian rulers of that city during the thousand years and more it was in their hands, will reveal to the enquirer that though the crescent with a cross within its horns appears occasionally upon the coins of the Emperors of the East, and in one or two instances we see a cross of four equal arms with each extremity piercing a crescent, it is doubtful if a single example of the so-called "star and crescent" symbol can be found upon them.}}
</ref>

Turkish historians tend to stress the antiquity of the crescent (not star-and-crescent) symbol among the early Turkic states in Asia.<ref>"It is clear, however, that, whatever the origin, the crescent was used by Turkish states in various regions of Asia, and there is absolutely no reason to claim that it passed to the Ottomans from Byzantium" [[Mehmet Fuat Köprülü]], Gary Leiser (trans.), ''Some Observations On The Influence Of Byzantine Institutions On Ottoman Institutions'', Türk Tarih Kurumu, 1999, p 118</ref> In Turkish tradition, there is an Ottoman legend of a dream of the eponymous founder of the Ottoman house, [[Osman I]], in which he is reported to have seen a moon rising from the breast of a Muslim judge whose daughter he sought to marry. "When full, it descended into his own breast. Then from his loins there sprang a tree, which as it grew came to cover the whole world with the shadow of its green and beautiful branches." Beneath it Osman saw the world spread out before him, surmounted by the crescent.<ref>Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire'', Morrow Quill Paperbacks, 1977, pp 23-24</ref>

[[Islamic flags]] containing the calligraphy of the Quran were commonly used by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Emperor Akbar]], it was the Mughal Emperor [[Shah Jahan]], who is known to have inlaid the Crescent and Star symbol upon his personal shield, his son Aurangzeb is also known to have used similar shields and flags containing an upward Crescent and Star symbol. Various [[Nawab]]s, such as the Nawab of the [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]], also used the Crescent and Star symbols.<ref name="Star and crescent"/>

===Arabian idol Hubal===
{{main|Hubal}}

Before Islam, the [[Kaaba]] contained a statue representing the god [[Hubal]], which was thought by the locals to have powers of divination.<ref>F. Hommel, ''First Encyclopedia of Islam'', eds. M.T. Houtsma, [[T.W. Arnold]], R. Basset, and R. Hartmann, Vol. 1, pp. 379-380</ref><ref>C. Glassé, The New Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 185</ref> The claim draws on historical secular scholarship about the origins of the Islamic view of Allah and the polytheism of pre-Islamic Arabia, which date back to the nineteenth century. These concern the evolution and etymology of "Allah" and the mythological identity of Hubal.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Scholarly views==
On the basis that the Kaaba was Allah's house, but the most important idol within it was that of Hubal, [[Julius Wellhausen]] considered Hubal to be an ancient name for Allah.<ref>J. Wellhausen, ''Reste Arabischen Heidenthums''. pp.75</ref><ref>''The idea of idolatry and the emergence of Islam: from polemic to history. Cambridge studies in Islamic civilization''. Gerald R. Hawting. Cambridge University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-521-65165-4}} pp.112</ref><ref>also mentioned in ''Meccan trade and the rise of Islam'', Patricia Crone, Gorgias Press LLC, 2004, {{ISBN|1-59333-102-9}} pp.185-195</ref>

The claim that Hubal is a moon god derives from the early twentieth century German scholar [[Hugo Winckler]].<ref>Hugo Winckler: "Arabisch, Semitisch, Orientalisch: Kulturgeschichtlich-Mythologische Untersuchung", 1901, W. Peiser: Berlin, p. 83.</ref> David Leeming describes him as a warrior and rain god,<ref name = "dave"/> as does [[Mircea Eliade]].<ref>Eliade, Adams, ''The Encyclopedia of religion'', Volume 1, Macmillan, 1987, p.365.</ref>

More recent authors emphasise the [[Nabataean]] origins of Hubal as a figure imported ''into'' the shrine, which may have already been associated with Allah.<ref name = "dave">[[David Adams Leeming]], ''Jealous gods and chosen people: the mythology of the Middle East'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p.121.</ref> [[Patricia Crone]] argues that "If Hubal and Allah had been one and the same deity, Hubal ought to have survived as an epithet of Allah, which he did not. And moreover there would not have been traditions in which people are asked to renounce the one for the other."<ref>Patricia Crone, "Meccan Trade And The Rise Of Islam", 1987, pp. 193-194."</ref>

No iconic representation or idol of Allah is known to have existed.<ref>{{Citation|last=Peters|first=Francis E.|title=Muhammad and the Origins of Islam|year=1994b|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1875-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/muhammadorigins00pete/page/107 107]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/muhammadorigins00pete/page/107}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Zeitlin|first=Irving M.|title=The Historical Muhammad|year=2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-3999-4|page=33}}</ref>

==Christian proponents==
[[Robert Morey (pastor)|Robert Morey]]'s book ''The Moon-god Allah in the Archeology of the Middle East'' claims that [[Al-‘Uzzá]] is identical in origin to [[Hubal]], whom he asserts to be a [[lunar deity]].<ref>''The Moon-god Allah in the Archeology of the Middle East''. Newport, PA : Research and Education Foundation, 1994</ref> This teaching is repeated in the [[Chick tract]]s "Allah Had No Son" and "The Little Bride". In 1996 [[Janet Parshall]], in syndicated radio broadcasts, asserted that Muslims worship a moon god.<ref>Jack G. Shaheen, ''Arab and Muslim Stereotyping in American Popular Culture'', Centre For Muslim-Christian Understanding, Georgetown University Occasional Papers, p. 8.</ref> [[Pat Robertson]] said in 2003, "The struggle is whether Hubal, the Moon God of [[Mecca]], known as Allah, is supreme, or whether the Judeo-Christian [[Jehovah]] God of the Bible is Supreme."<ref>Donald E. Schmidt, ''The folly of war: American foreign policy, 1898-2005'', Algora, 2005, p.347.</ref>

However, recent research from various sources have proven that the "evidence" used by Morey was of the statue retrieved from an [[Tel Hazor|excavation site at Hazor]], of which there is no connection to "Allah" at all.<ref>Mohd Elfie Nieshaem Juferi, [https://www.bismikaallahuma.org/islam/allah-hazor-statue/ "The Mysterious Statue at Hazor: The “Allah” of the Muslims?], in ''Bismika Allahuma'', October 15, 2005</ref>  In fact, Bible scholar and mission strategist Rick Brown openly disagrees with this approach and said:

<blockquote>Those who claim that Allah is a pagan deity, most notably the moon god, often base their claims on the fact that a symbol of the crescent moon adorns the tops of many mosques and is widely used as a symbol of Islam. It is in fact true that before the coming of Islam many "gods" and idols were worshipped in the Middle East, but the name of the moon god was Sîn, not Allah, and he was not particularly popular in Arabia, the birthplace of Islam. The most prominent idol in Mecca was a god called Hubal, and there is no proof that he was a moon god. It is sometimes claimed that there is a temple to the moon god at Hazor in Palestine. This is based on a representation there of a supplicant wearing a crescent-like pendant. It is not clear, however, that the pendant symbolizes a moon god, and in any case this is not an Arab religious site but an ancient Canaanite site, which was destroyed by Joshua in about 1250 BC. ... If the ancient Arabs worshipped hundreds of idols, then no doubt the moon god Sîn was included, for even the Hebrews were prone to worship the sun and the moon and the stars, but there is no clear evidence that moon-worship was prominent among the Arabs in any way or that the crescent was used as the symbol of a moon god, and Allah was certainly not the moon god's name.<ref>R. Brown, [http://contextualization.info/sites/www.contextualization.info/files/Brown_2006_IJFM_Who_Is_Allah.pdf "Who Is "Allah"?"], ''International Journal of Frontier Missions'', 2006, Volume 23, No. 2, p. 79.</ref></blockquote>

Michael Abd El Massih, the Director of Arabic Bible Outreach, echoes the same point and asserts that:

<blockquote>It is an unproven theory, so it may well be false. Even if it turns out to be true, it has little bearing on the Muslim faith since Muslims do not worship a moon god. That would be blasphemy in Islamic teachings. If we use the moon-god theory to discredit Islam, we discredit the Christian Arabic speaking churches and missions throughout the Middle East. This point should not be discounted lightly because the word Allah is found in millions of Arabic Bibles and other Arabic Christian materials. The moon-god theory confuses evangelism. When Christians approach Muslims, they do not know whether they need to convince them that they worship the wrong deity, or to present them the simple Gospel message of our Lord Jesus Christ.<ref>Michael Abd El Massih, [https://www.arabicbible.com/for-christians/1810-the-word-allah-and-islam.html "The word Allah and Islam"], in ''Arabic Bible Outreach Ministries''</ref></blockquote>

==Islamic tradition==
In 8th-century Arab historian [[Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi]]'s ''Book of Idols'', the idol Hubal is described as a human figure with a gold hand (replacing the original hand that had broken off the statue). He had seven [[Belomancy|arrows that were used for divination]].<ref>Francis E. Peters, Muhammad and the origins of Islam, SUNY Press, 1994, p.109.</ref>

Some Islamic scholars argue that Muhammad's role was to restore the purified Abrahamic worship of Allah by emphasising his uniqueness and separation from his own creation, including phenomena such as the moon.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The alleged miracle of the [[splitting of the moon]] shows that God is not the moon, but has power over it.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Whether or not Hubal was even associated with the moon, both Muhammad and his enemies clearly identified Hubal and Allah as different gods, their supporters fighting on opposing sides in the [[Battle of Badr]]. [[Ibn Hisham]] notes that [[Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], leader of the defeated anti-Islamic army, called to Hubal for support to gain victory in their next battle:

{{Blockquote|When Abu Sufyan wanted to leave he went to the top of the mountain and shouted loudly saying, "You have done a fine work; victory in war goes by turns. Today in exchange for the day (of Badr). Show your superiority, Hubal", i.e. vindicate your religion. The apostle told ‘Umar to get up and answer him and say, Allah is most high and most glorious. We are not equal. Our dead are in paradise; your dead are in hell.<ref>A. Guillaume, The Life Of Muhammad: A Translation Of Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah, 2004 (18th Impression), op. cit., p. 386. [http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Sources/Allah/hubal.html]</ref>}}

The [[Sahih al-Bukhari]], a written tradition from 9th-century compiler al-Bukhari, clearly differentiates between the worshippers of Allah, and the worshippers of Hubal, referring to the same event.

{{Blockquote|Abu Sufyan ascended a high place and said, "Is Muhammad present amongst the people?" The Prophet said, "Do not answer him." Abu Sufyan said, "Is the son of Abu Quhafa present among the people?" The Prophet said, "Do not answer him." Abu Sufyan said, "Is the son of Al-Khattab amongst the people?" He then added, "All these people have been killed, for, were they alive, they would have replied." On that, 'Umar could not help saying, "You are a liar, O enemy of Allah! Allah has kept what will make you unhappy." Abu Sufyan said, "Superior may be Hubal!" On that the Prophet said (to his companions), "Reply to him." They asked, "What may we say?" He said, "Say: Allah is More Elevated and More Majestic!" Abu Sufyan said, "We have (the idol) al-‘Uzza, whereas you have no ‘Uzza!" The Prophet said (to his companions), "Reply to him." They said, "What may we say?"

==Muslim views and response==
{{main|God in Islam}}

Most branches of Islam teach that Allah is the name in the Quran used for God,<ref>Under the [http://corpus.quran.com/concept.jsp?id=allah "Allah"] entry, ''Ontology of Quranic Concepts'' in [http://corpus.quran.com/ The Quranic Arabic Corpus], retrieved July 16, 2017</ref> and is the same god worshipped by the members of other [[Abrahamic religion]]s such as [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] ({{cite quran|29|46|style=nosup|expand=no}}).<ref name="Peters1">F.E. Peters, ''Islam'', p.4, Princeton University Press, 2003</ref> Mainstream Islamic thought holds that the worship of Allah was passed down through [[Abraham]] and other prophets, but it became corrupted by pagan traditions in pre-Islamic Arabia. Before Muhammad, Allah was not considered the sole divinity by Meccans; however, Allah was considered the creator of the world and the giver of rain. The notion of the term may have been vague in the Meccan religion.<ref name="EoI">L.

The Quran itself condemns moon worship. Muslim scholars cite the 37th verse of [[Sura]] [[Fussilat]] as proof against the moon god claim:

<blockquote>
:وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ

In 2009, anthropologist Gregory Starrett wrote, "a recent survey by the [[Council on American–Islamic Relations|Council for American Islamic Relations]] reports that as many as 10% of Americans believe Muslims are pagans who worship a moon god or goddess, a belief energetically disseminated by some Christian activists."<ref>Gregory Starrett, "Islam and the Politics of Enchantment", ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', May 2009, vol. 15.

[[Farzana Hassan]] sees these views as an extension of long-standing Christian evangelical claims that Muhammad was an impostor and deceiver: 
 
<blockquote>Literature circulated by the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] perpetuates the popular Christian belief about Islam being a pagan religion, borrowing aspects of Judeo-Christian monotheism by elevating the moon god Hubal to the rank of Supreme God, or Allah. Muhammad, for fundamentalist Christians, remains an impostor who commissioned his companions to copy words of the Bible as they sat in dark inaccessible places, far removed from public gaze.<ref>Farzana Hassan Shahid, Farzana Hassan, ''Prophecy and the fundamentalist quest: an integrative study of Christian and Muslim apocalyptic religion'', McFarland, 2008, p.17</ref></blockquote>
