{{short description|Claims and debunked claims of African-American heritage}}
This article includes information on the African heritage of presidents of the United States, together with information on unsubstantiated claims that certain presidents of the United States had African ancestry. 

== Presidents with African ancestry ==

=== Barack Obama ===
President [[Barack Obama]], who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017, had a Kenyan father and an American mother of mostly European ancestry.<ref>Scott, Janny, ''A Singular Woman'' (2011).</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/us/obamas-mother-had-african-forebear-study-suggests.html</ref> His father, [[Barack Obama Sr.]] (1936–1982),<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2008-06-01-0806010145-story.html|title=Kenyans Enthusiastic About Obama|work=Baltimore Sun|last=Kipkemboi|first=Andrew|date=June 1, 2008|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> was a [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo Kenyan]]<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/19/the-fascinating-tribal-tradition-that-gave-obama-his-last-name/</ref> from [[Nyang'oma Kogelo]], Kenya.<ref>{{cite web|author=David R Arnott |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/photo/obamas-old-school-his-ancestral-village-world-reacts-us-presidential-flna1C6912948 |title=From Obama's old school to his ancestral village, world reacts to US presidential election |publisher=Nbcnews.com |access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> In July 2012, drawing on a combination of historical documents and [[Y-DNA]] analysis, [[Ancestry.com]] found a strong likelihood that Obama—through his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham—is an eleventh great-grandson of the African [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]].

== Unsubstantiated claims that presidents have/had African ancestry ==
Claims that certain U.S. presidents other than Barack Obama had African or African-American ancestry have been made by the historian [[William Estabrook Chancellor]], amateur historian [[J. A. Rogers]], [[ophthalmologist]] Leroy William Vaughn,<ref>[http://www.computerhealth.org/ebook/ Dr. Leroy Vaughn, ''Black People & Their Place in History''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124021521/http://www.computerhealth.org/ebook/ |date=January 24, 2009 }}</ref> and Auset BaKhufu. All but Chancellor base their theories chiefly on the work of J. A. Rogers, who apparently self-published a pamphlet in 1965 claiming that five presidents of the United States, widely accepted as white, also had African ancestry.<ref>Rogers, J. A., ''The Five Negro Presidents: According to What White People Said They Were'' (St. Petersburg, Fla.: Helga M.

Historians' and biographers' studies of these presidents have not supported such claims, nor have the claims been published in any peer-reviewed journal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Barack Obama is Not the First "Black President"

Roger's book titled ''Five Black Presidents'' and William Herndon's book titled ''The Hidden Lincoln''. These sources together claim six American Presidents who were believed to have had "Black blood": Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Dwight David Eisenhower. These sources, however, do not offer compelling empirical evidence to support their claims. A more empirically grounded source is the article titled "Harding was first 'black president'" that appeared in the ''Baltimore Sun'' on October 7, 1998 (p.2A) written by Theo Lippman. The following is a retelling of Lippman's findings. |work=[[All Africa]] |year=2008 |access-date=2009-01-29 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090126224642/http://allafrica.com/stories/200811181205.html| archive-date= 26 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> These authors are generally ignored by scholars.

=== Thomas Jefferson ===
Vaughn and others claim [[early life and career of Thomas Jefferson#Jeffersons of Virginia|Thomas Jefferson]]'s mother [[Jane Randolph Jefferson]] was of mixed-race ancestry.<ref name=haynes/><ref name="Hussain">{{cite news |first=Aysha  |last=Hussain |title=Obama Won't Be First Black President |url=http://northdallasgazette.com/archives/2009/01-15-09_edition.pdf |quote=Were there other "black" presidents? Some historians have reason to believe people don't really understand the genealogy of past U.S. Presidents. Research shows at least five U.S. presidents had black ancestors and Thomas Jefferson, the nation's third president, was considered the first black president, according to historian Leroy Vaughn, author of ''Black People and Their Place in World History''. Vaughn's research shows Jefferson was not the only former black U.S. president. Who were the others? Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge. But why was this unknown? How were they elected president? All five of these presidents never acknowledged their black ancestry. |work=North Dallas Gazette (published from Diversity original from 2008) |year=2009 |access-date=2016-01-29 }}</ref> The academic consensus does not support such claims. In her recent analyses of historical evidence about the Hemings and Jeffersons, for example, the scholar Annette Gordon-Reed makes no claim of African descent in the Randolph family.<ref>Annette Gordon-Reed, ''The Hemingses of Monticello'' and ''Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings''.</ref>

Specifically, Vaughn says, "The chief attack on Jefferson was in a book written by Thomas Hazard in 1867 called ''The Johnny Cake Papers''.  Hazard interviewed Paris Gardiner, who said he was present during the 1796 presidential campaign, when one speaker states that Thomas Jefferson was a mean-spirited son of a half-breed Indian squaw and a Virginia mulatto father."<ref>{{cite book |author=Leroy William Vaughn |title=Black People and Their Place in History |year=2002 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=0-9715920-0-4 |page=142}}</ref> An overlapping claim is that, in an 18th-century Presidential campaign, someone speaking against Jefferson's candidacy and in favor of that of [[John Adams]] accused Jefferson of being "half Injun, half nigger, half Frenchman"<ref name="Nock-Jefferson-p141">[[Albert Jay Nock|Nock, Albert Jay]], ''Jefferson'' (N.Y.: Hill & Wang (American Century ser.), 1st Am.

The [[Thomas Jefferson Foundation]], which owns and operates [[Monticello]], the major public history site on Jefferson, characterizes Jefferson's parents this way: "His father [[Peter Jefferson]] was a successful planter and surveyor and his mother Jane Randolph a member of one of Virginia's most distinguished families."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/jefferson/biography.html |title=Brief Biography of Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) |access-date=2009-01-31 |publisher=Monticello Foundation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801045437/http://www.monticello.org/jefferson/biography.html |archive-date=2008-08-01 |url-status=live }}</ref> They describe the quote in ''The Johnny Cake Papers'' as one frequently repeated, but it is attributed in written sources to the 1800 rather than the 1796 election campaign and clearly is one made by political opponents.

=== Abraham Lincoln ===
[[Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln#Family|Abraham Lincoln]]'s mother [[Nancy Hanks]] was claimed to be of African descent (Ethiopian).<ref name=chideya/><ref name="Mlynar" /><ref name="Hussain" />

According to historian [[William E.

=== Warren G. Harding ===
[[Warren G. Harding#African-American lineage contention|Warren G. Harding]] was said to have African ancestry; one claim was by his political opponent, a controversial and racist historian, [[William Estabrook Chancellor]]. Chancellor said Harding's father was a [[mulatto]]<ref name="chideya"/><ref name="Gage">{{cite news |first= Beverly|last= Gage|title=Our First Black President?  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/magazine/06wwln-essay-t.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 6, 2008 |access-date=2009-01-20 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210223839/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/magazine/06wwln-essay-t.html| archive-date=December 10, 2008| url-status= live}}</ref><ref name="Mlynar" /> and Harding's great-grandmother was black.<ref name="Gage" /> During Harding's campaign, Democratic opponents spread rumors that Harding's great-great-grandfather was a [[West Indian]] [[black person|black]] and that other blacks might be found in his family tree.<ref>[[Francis Russell (author)|Russell, Francis]], ''The Shadow of Blooming Grove–Warren G. Harding In His Times'' (Easton Press, 1962; {{ISBN|0-07-054338-0}}), p.&nbsp;372.</ref> Chancellor publicized rumors, based on supposed family research, but perhaps reflecting no more than local gossip.<ref>Russell, Francis, ''The Shadow of Blooming Grove'', ''op. cit.'', pp.&nbsp;403–405.</ref> In an era when the "one-drop rule" would classify a person with any African ancestry as black, and black people in [[Southern United States|the South]] had been effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchised]], Harding's campaign manager responded, "no family in the state (of Ohio) has a clearer, a more honorable record than the Hardings', a blue-eyed stock from New England and Pennsylvania, the finest pioneer blood."<ref>Russell, Francis, ''The Shadow of Blooming Grove'', ''op. cit.'', p.&nbsp;404.</ref> "Many biographers have dismissed the rumors of Harding's mixed-race family as little more than a political scandal and Chancellor himself as a Democratic mudslinger and racist ideologue."<ref name="Gage" /> According to Chancellor, Harding got his only academic degree from [[Ohio Central College|Iberia College]], which had been "founded to educate fugitive slaves."<ref name="Hussain" /><ref name="Murphy">Murphy, P. (1993), ''Making the Connections: Women, Work, and Abuse.'' PMD Press, p. xxxi.</ref> The college was founded by abolitionist supporters in the [[Presbyterian Church]] in [[Ohio]] for students of both genders and all races. 
<blockquote>When asked directly about Chancellor's account, Harding did not make any effort to deny that he may have had an African-American ancestor. He said he did not know and demonstrated that it was not a significant issue.<ref name="Gage"/></blockquote>

The rumors may have been sustained by a statement Harding allegedly made to newspaperman [[James W. Faulkner]] on the subject, which he perhaps meant to be dismissive: "How do I know, Jim? One of my ancestors may have jumped the fence."<ref>Adams, Samuel Hopkins, ''Incredible Era: The Life and Times of Warren Gamaliel Harding'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1939; {{ISBN|0-374-90051-5}}), p.&nbsp;280.</ref> However, while there are gaps in the historical record, studies of his family tree have not found evidence of an African-American ancestor.<ref>[http://blog.cleveland.com/pdopinion/2008/02/warren_g_hardings_roots_and_ra.html Millner, Gloria, ''Warren G. Harding''], Cleveland Live, February 4, 2008, retrieved December 23, 2010.</ref>

In 2015 [[genetic testing]] of Harding's descendants determined, with more than a 95% percent chance of accuracy, that he lacked sub-Saharan African forebears within four previous generations.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|first=Peter|last=Baker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/us/politics/dna-that-confirmed-one-warren-harding-rumor-refutes-another.html|title=DNA Shows Warren Harding Wasn’t America’s First Black President|date=August 18, 2015|access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref>

=== Calvin Coolidge ===
[[Calvin Coolidge]]'s mother Victoria Moor was claimed to be of a mixed-race family in [[Vermont]].<ref name=chideya/><ref name="Hussain" /><ref name="Murphy" /> Vaughn noted that her surname was derived from "Moor", a European term for people of [[North Africa]]. He did not note that another meaning of her surname is the landscape feature of moor or [[bog]]. People's surnames were often based on such landscape features when surnames became generally adopted in 14th century England. Moor/Moore is a common name in England, Scotland, and Ireland.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Patrick Hanks]], ed. |title=Dictionary of American Family Names |year=2003 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=Moor is a variant of Moore. Moore Name Meaning and History:  1. English: from Middle English more 'moor', 'marsh', 'fen', 'area of uncultivated land' (Old English mor), hence a topographic name for someone who lived in such a place or a habitational name from any of the various places named with this word, as for example Moore in Cheshire or More in Shropshire.  2. English: from Old French more 'Moor' (Latin maurus). The Latin term denoted a native of northwestern Africa, but in medieval England the word came to be used informally as a nickname for any swarthy or dark-skinned person. |isbn= 0-19-508137-4}}</ref>

=== Dwight D. Eisenhower ===
[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s mother was said to be of mixed blood from Africa and mulatto.<ref name=haynes/><ref name=chideya/><ref name="Mlynar" /> However, historians and biographers of Eisenhower had documented his parents' German, Swiss and English ancestry and long history in America. Some of his immigrant ancestors settled in Pennsylvania in 1741 and after, migrated west to Kansas.<ref>[http://www.dwightdeisenhower.com/library-museum.html Eisenhower Presidential Library & Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223124853/http://www.dwightdeisenhower.com/library-museum.html |date=February 23, 2009 }}, includes Home and Tomb, and photo of parents, Official website, accessed 30 January 2009.</ref>
