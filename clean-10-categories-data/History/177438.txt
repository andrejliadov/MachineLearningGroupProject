'''Philosophy of history''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] study of [[history]] and its [[academic discipline|discipline]]. The term was coined by French philosopher [[Voltaire]].<ref>[[Voltaire]], ''La philosophie de l'histoire'', Changuion, 1765.</ref>

In [[contemporary philosophy]] a distinction has developed between ''speculative'' philosophy of history and ''critical'' philosophy of history, now referred to as ''analytic''. The former questions the meaning and purpose of the historical process whereas the latter studies the foundations and implications of history and the [[historical method]].<ref>The Continuing Relevance of Speculative Philosophy of History, Journal of the Philosophy of History</ref><ref>Philosophy of History, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref> The names of these are derived from [[C. D. Broad]]'s distinction between [[critical philosophy]] and speculative philosophy.<ref>E.g. W. H. Walsh, ''Introduction to the Philosophy of History'' (1951) ch. 1 p. 2.</ref><ref>Rolf Gruner, "The concept of speculative philosophy of history," ''Metaphilosophy'' '''3'''(4).</ref>{{Verify source|date=November 2019}}

== Origins ==
In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) maintained the superiority of poetry over history because poetry speaks of what ''ought'' or ''must'' be [[truth|true]] rather than merely what ''is'' true.

[[Herodotus]], a fifth-century BCE contemporary of [[Socrates]], broke from the [[Homer|Homeric tradition]] of passing [[narrative]] from generation to generation in his work "Investigations" (Ancient Greek: Ἱστορίαι; Istoríai), also known as [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']]. Herodotus, regarded by some{{who|date=June 2016}} as the first systematic historian, and, later, [[Plutarch]] (46–120 CE) freely invented [[discourse|speeches]] for their historical figures and chose their historical subjects with an eye toward [[moral]]ly improving the reader. History was supposed to teach good examples for one to follow.{{Attribution needed|date=November 2019}} The assumption that history "should teach good examples" influenced how writers produced history. Events of the past are just as likely to show bad examples that one should not follow,{{According to whom|date=November 2019}} but classical historians would either not record such examples or would re-interpret them to support their assumption of history's purpose.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

From the Classical period to the [[Renaissance]], historians alternated between focusing on subjects designed to improve mankind and on a devotion to fact. History was composed mainly of [[hagiography|hagiographies]] of [[sovereignty|monarchs]] or of [[epic poetry]] describing [[hero]]ic gestures (such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]''—about the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (778) during [[Charlemagne]]'s first campaign to conquer the [[Iberian peninsula]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

In the fourteenth century, [[Ibn Khaldun]], who is considered one of the fathers of the philosophy of history,{{who|date=May 2020}} discussed his philosophy of history and society in detail in his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377). His work represents a culmination of earlier works by [[Social theory#Sociology in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic sociologists]] in the spheres of [[Islamic ethics]], [[political science]], and [[Historiography of early Islam|historiography]], such as those of [[al-Farabi]] (c. 872 – c. 950), [[Ibn Miskawayh]], al-Dawani, and [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] (1201–1274).<ref name=Mowlana>H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.</ref> Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data". He introduced a [[scientific method]] to the philosophy of history (which Dawood<ref>

By the eighteenth century historians had turned toward a more [[positivist]] approach—focusing on [[fact]] as much as possible, but still with an eye on telling histories that could instruct and improve. Starting with [[Fustel de Coulanges]] (1830–1889) and [[Theodor Mommsen]] (1817–1903), historical studies began to move towards a more modern scientific form.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In the [[Victorian era]], historiographers debated less whether history was intended to improve the [[Reading (process)|reader]], and more on what causes turned history and how one could understand historical change.

== Concepts ==
=== Philosophy of chronology ===

Many ancient cultures held [[mythical]] and [[theological]] concepts of history and of [[time]] that were not [[linear]]. Such societies saw history as cyclical, with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. [[Plato]] taught the concept of the [[Great Year]], and other Greeks spoke of [[aeon]]s. Similar examples include the ancient doctrine of [[eternal return]], which existed in [[Ancient Egypt]], in the [[Indian religions]], among the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Pythagoreans]]' and in the [[Stoics]]' conceptions. In his ''[[Works and Days]]'', [[Hesiod]] described five [[Ages of Man]]: the [[Golden Age]], the [[Silver Age]], the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age]], which began with the [[Dorian invasion]]. Some scholars{{which|date=July 2018}} identify just four ages, corresponding to the four metals, with the Heroic age as a description of the Bronze Age. A four-age count would match the [[Vedic time keeping|Vedic]] or Hindu ages known as [[Satya Yuga]], [[Treta Yuga]], [[Dvapara Yuga]] and [[Kali Yuga]], which together make one [[Yuga Cycle]] that repeats. According to [[Jainism]], this world has no beginning or end but goes through cycles of upturns (utsarpini) and downturns (avasarpini) constantly. Many Greeks believed that just as mankind went through four stages of character during each rise and fall of history so did [[government]]. They considered [[democracy]] and [[monarchy]] as the healthy régimes of the higher ages; and [[oligarchy]] and [[tyranny]] as corrupted régimes common to the lower ages.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}}

In the East, [[Social cycle theory|cyclical theories of history]] developed in China (as a theory of [[dynastic cycle]]) and in the Islamic world in the work <sup>[''name needed]''</sup> of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406).

During the [[Renaissance]], cyclical conceptions of history would become common, with proponents illustrating decay and rebirth by pointing to the [[decline of the Roman Empire]]. [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' (1513–1517) provide an example. The notion of [[Empire]] contained in itself ascendance and [[decadence]],{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} as in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) (which the Roman Catholic Church placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'').

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], history began to be seen as both linear and irreversible. [[Condorcet]]'s interpretations of the various "stages of humanity" and [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[positivism]] were among the most important formulations of such conceptions of history, which trusted [[social progress]]. As in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'' (1762) treatise on education (or the "art of training men"), the Enlightenment conceived the human species as perfectible: [[human nature]] could be infinitely developed through a well-thought [[pedagogy]].

[[Social cycle theory|Cyclical conceptions]] continued in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the works of authors such as [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936), [[Nikolay Danilevsky]] (1822–1885), and [[Paul Kennedy]] (1945– ), who conceived the human past as a series of repetitive rises and falls. Spengler, like [[Herbert Butterfield|Butterfield]], when writing in reaction to the carnage of the [[First World War]] of 1914–1918, believed that a civilization enters upon an era of [[Caesarism]]<ref>
Compare [https://books.google.com/books?id=XDWcLHxfthMC Oswald Spengler and History as Destiny], page 93: "[...] the closing years of the First World War, when Spengler was completing his work, had witnessed the passing of the feudal rule of landed aristocracy in Germany and its merging into budding forms of parliamentary plutocracy - soon to be followed by the rise of 'mobocracy' and then Caesarism."
</ref>
after its soul dies.{{citation needed|date= February 2016}} Spengler thought that the soul of the West was dead and that Caesarism was about to begin.

=== Philosophy of causality ===

Narrative and causal approaches to history have often been contrasted or even opposed to one another, yet they can also be viewed as complementary.<ref>Hewitson, M. (2014) ''History and Causality'', 127-48.</ref> Some philosophers of history such as Arthur Danto have claimed that "explanations in history and elsewhere" describe "not simply an event—something that happens—but a change".<ref>Danto, A. (1968) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 233.</ref> Like many practicing historians, they treat causes as intersecting actions and sets of actions which bring about "larger changes", in Danto's words: to decide "what are the elements which persist through a change" is "rather simple" when treating an individual's "shift in attitude", but "it is considerably more complex and metaphysically challenging when we are interested in such a change as, say, the break-up of feudalism or the emergence of nationalism".<ref>Danto, A. (1968) ''Analytical Philosophy of History'', 249.</ref>

Much of the historical debate about causes has focused on the relationship between communicative and other actions, between singular and repeated ones, and between actions, structures of action or group and institutional contexts and wider sets of conditions.<ref>Hewitson, M. (2014) ''History and Causality'', 86-116.</ref> John Gaddis has distinguished between exceptional and general causes (following Marc Bloch) and between "routine" and "distinctive links" in causal relationships: "in accounting for what happened at Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, we attach greater importance to the fact that President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb than to the decision of the Army Air Force to carry out his orders."<ref>Gaddis, J. L. (2002) ''The Landscape of History: How Historians Map the Past'', 64.</ref> He has also pointed to the difference between immediate, intermediate and distant causes. For his part, Christopher Lloyd puts forward four "general concepts of causation" used in history: the "metaphysical idealist concept, which asserts that the phenomena of the universe are products of or emanations from an omnipotent being or such final cause"; "the empiricist (or Humean) regularity concept, which is based on the idea of causation being a matter of constant conjunctions of events"; "the functional/teleological/consequential concept", which is "goal-directed, so that goals are causes"; and the "realist, structurist and dispositional approach, which sees relational structures and internal dispositions as the causes of phenomena".<ref>Lloyd, C. (1993) ''Structures of History'', 159.</ref>

There is disagreement about the extent to which history is ultimately [[historical determinism|deterministic]]. Some argue that geography, economic systems, or culture prescribe laws that determine the events of history. Others see history as a sequence of consequential processes that act upon each other. Even determinists do not rule out that, from time to time, certain cataclysmic events occur to change course of history. Their main point is, however, that such events are rare and that even apparently large shocks like wars and revolutions often have no more than temporary effects on the evolution of the society.

=== Philosophy of neutrality ===

The question of neutrality concerns itself foremost with analysis of historiography and the biases of historical sources. One prominent manifestation of this analysis is the idea that "history is written by the victors". This phrase appears to have been coined by [[George Graham Vest]] to explain the [[Lost Cause]] of the losing side of the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84029386/1891-08-27/ed-1/seq-1/|title=Abilene weekly reflector. (Abilene, Kan.) 1888-1935, August 27, 1891, Image 1|first=National Endowment for the|last=Humanities|date=August 27, 1891|via=chroniclingamerica.loc.gov}}</ref>

In his ''Society must be Defended'', [[Michel Foucault]] posits that the victors of a social struggle use their political dominance to suppress a defeated adversary's version of historical events in favor of their own [[propaganda]], which may go so far as [[historical revisionism (political)|historical negationism]]. [[Wolfgang Schivelbusch]]'s ''Culture of Defeat'' takes an opposing approach that defeat is a major driver for the defeated to reinvent himself, while the victor, confirmed in his attitudes and methods, dissatisfied by the high losses and paltry gains made, may be less creative and fall back.

For [[G. W. F. Hegel]], the history of the world is also the Last Judgement. Hegel adopts the expression "Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht" ("World history is a tribunal that judges the World"; a quote from [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s poem ''Resignation'' published in 1786) and asserts that history is what judges men, their actions and their opinions.<ref>Janez Juhant, Bojan Žalec (eds.), ''Reconciliation: The Way of Healing and Growth'', LIT Verlag Münster, 2012, p. 98.</ref> Since the twentieth century, Western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide a judgement of history.<ref name="Curran2000p413">Curran, Vivian Grosswald (2000) ''Herder and the Holocaust: A Debate About Difference and Determinism in the Context of Comparative Law'' in F.

== Operative theories ==

=== Teleological approaches ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}

Early teleological approaches to history can be found in [[theodicies]], which attempted to reconcile the [[problem of evil]] with the existence of God—providing a global explanation of history with belief in a progressive directionality organized by a superior power, leading to an [[eschatological]] end, such as a [[Messianic Age]] or [[Apocalypse]]. However, this transcendent teleological approach can be thought as [[immanent]] to human history itself. [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]], in his 1679 ''Discourse On Universal History'', and [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who coined the term, formulated such philosophical theodicies. Leibniz based his explanation on the [[principle of sufficient reason]], which states that anything that happens, does happen for a specific reason. Thus, if one adopts God's perspective, seemingly evil events in fact only take place in the larger [[divine plan]]. In this way theodicies explained the necessity of evil as a relative element that forms part of a larger plan of history. However, Leibniz's principles were not a gesture of [[fatalism]]. Confronted with the antique [[problem of future contingents]], Leibniz developed the theory of [[compossible worlds]], distinguishing two types of necessity, in response to the problem of [[determinism]].

[[G. W. F. Hegel]] may represent the epitome of teleological philosophy of history. Hegel's teleology was taken up by [[Francis Fukuyama]] in his ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''. Thinkers such as [[Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]], or [[Deleuze]] deny any teleological sense to history, claiming that it is best characterized by discontinuities, ruptures, and various time-scales,{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} which the [[Annales School]] had demonstrated.{{Fact or opinion|date=November 2019}}

Schools of thought influenced by Hegel also see history as progressive, but they  see progress as the outcome of a [[dialectic]] in which factors working in opposite directions are over time reconciled. History was best seen as directed by a {{lang|de|[[Zeitgeist]]}}, and traces of the {{lang|de|Zeitgeist}} could be seen by looking backward. Hegel believed that history was moving man toward [[civilization]], and some also claim he thought that the [[Prussia]]n state incarnated the ''[[end of history]]''. In his ''Lessons on the History of Philosophy'', he explains that each epochal philosophy is in a way the whole of philosophy; it is not a subdivision of the Whole but this Whole itself apprehended in a specific modality.

=== Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel ===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|200px|thumb|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], philosopher of [[absolute idealism]] who developed a [[dialectic]] conception of history]]

[[G. W. F. Hegel]] developed a complex theodicy in his 1807 ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', which based its conception of history on [[dialectics]]. The negative was conceived by Hegel as the motor of history. Hegel argued that history is a constant process of dialectic clash, with each [[thesis]] encountering an opposing idea or event [[antithesis]]. The clash of both was "superated" in the [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]], a conjunction that conserved the contradiction between thesis and its antithesis while [[Aufheben|sublating]] it. As [[Marx]] famously explained afterwards, concretely that meant that if [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]'s monarchic rule in France was seen as the thesis, the [[French Revolution]] could be seen as its antithesis. However, both were sublated in [[Napoleon]], who reconciled the revolution with the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''; he conserved the change. Hegel thought that [[reason]] accomplished itself, through this dialectical scheme, in History. Through [[Manual labour|labour]], man transformed nature so he could recognize himself in it; he made it his "home." Thus, reason spiritualized nature. Roads, fields, fences, and all the modern infrastructure in which we live is the result of this spiritualization of nature. Hegel thus explained social progress as the result of the labour of reason in history. However, this dialectical reading of history involved, of course, contradiction, so history was also conceived of as constantly conflicting: Hegel theorized this in his famous [[Slave-master dialectic|dialectic of the lord and the bondsman]].

According to Hegel,
{{quotation|One more word about giving instruction as to what the world ought to be. Philosophy in any case always comes on the scene too late to give it... When philosophy paints its gray in gray, then has a shape of life grown old. By philosophy's gray in gray it cannot be rejuvenated but only understood. The [[owl of Minerva]] spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk.<ref>Hegel, [[Philosophy of Right]] (1820), "Preface"</ref>}}

Thus, philosophy was to explain ''Geschichte'' (history) afterward. Philosophy is always late, it is only an interpretation of what is rational in the real—and, according to Hegel, only what is recognized as rational is real. This idealist understanding of philosophy as interpretation was famously challenged by [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Theses on Feuerbach|11th thesis on Feuerbach]]'' (1845): "''Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.''"

=== Thomas Carlyle ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}
[[File:Century Mag Thomas Carlyle.png|200px|thumb|left|[[Thomas Carlyle]], Scottish historian and philosopher of the [[great man theory]]]]

After Hegel, who insisted on the role of ''[[Great man theory|great men]]'' in history, with his famous statement about [[Napoleon]], "I saw the Spirit on his horse", [[Thomas Carlyle]] argued that history was the biography of a few central individuals, [[hero]]es, such as [[Oliver Cromwell]] or [[Frederick the Great]], writing that "The history of the world is but the biography of great men." His view of heroes included not only political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states, but artists, poets, theologians and other cultural leaders. His history of great men, of geniuses good and evil, sought to organize change in the advent of [[greatness]].

Explicit defenses of Carlyle's position have been rare since the late twentieth century. Most philosophers of history contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one he used for his portraits. A.C. Danto, for example, wrote of the importance of the individual in history, but extended his definition to include ''social individuals'', defined as "individuals we may provisionally characterize as containing individual human beings amongst their parts. Examples of social individuals might be social classes [...], national groups [...], religious organizations [...], large-scale events [...], large-scale social movements [...], etc." (Danto, "The Historical Individual", 266, in ''Philosophical Analysis and History,'' edited by Williman H. Dray, Rainbow-Bridge Book Co., 1966). The great man theory of history was most popular with professional historians in the nineteenth century; a popular work of this school is the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' (1911), which contains lengthy and detailed biographies about the great men of history.{{notetag|See, for example, the biography of [[Attila the Hun]] of the [[Migrations Period]].}}

After [[Marx]]'s [[historical materialism|conception of a materialist history]] based on the [[class struggle]], which raised attention for the first time to the importance of social factors such as economics in the unfolding of history, [[Herbert Spencer]] wrote "You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him."

=== Social evolutionism ===
{{main|Sociocultural evolution|l1=Sociocultural evolutionism}}
{{Off topic|date=November 2019}}
Inspired by the Enlightenment's ideal of progress, social evolutionism became a popular conception in the nineteenth century. [[Auguste Comte]]'s (1798–1857) [[positivism|positivist]] conception of history, which he divided into the theological stage, the metaphysical stage and the positivist stage, brought upon by modern science, was one of the most influential doctrines of progress. The [[Whig interpretation of history]], as it was later called, associated with scholars of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] eras in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], such as [[Henry Maine]] or [[Thomas Macaulay]], gives an example of such influence, by looking at human history as progress from savagery and ignorance toward peace, prosperity, and science. Maine described the direction of progress as "from status to contract," from a world in which a child's whole life is pre-determined by the circumstances of his birth, toward one of mobility and choice.

The publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859 introduced [[human evolution]]. However, it was quickly transposed from its original biological field to the social field, in [[social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] theories. [[Herbert Spencer]], who coined the term "[[survival of the fittest]]", or [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] in ''[[Ancient Society]]'' (1877) developed evolutionist theories independent from Darwin's works, which would be later interpreted as social Darwinism. These nineteenth-century [[unilineal evolution]] theories claimed that societies start out in a primitive state and gradually become more [[civilisation|civilised]] over time, and equated the culture and technology of Western civilisation with progress.

[[Ernst Haeckel]] formulated his [[recapitulation theory]] in 1867, which stated that "[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]": the evolution of each individual reproduces the species' evolution, such as in the development of [[embryos]]. Hence, a child goes through all the steps from primitive society to modern society. This was later discredited.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Haeckel did not support Darwin's theory of [[natural selection]] introduced in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859), rather believing in a [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]].

Progress was not necessarily, however, positive. [[Arthur Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–55) was a [[decadence|decadent]] description of the evolution of the [[Aryan race]] which was disappearing through [[miscegenation]].{{Fact or opinion|date=November 2019}} Gobineau's works had a large popularity in the so-called [[scientific racism]] theories that developed during the [[New Imperialism]] period.

After the [[World War I|first world war]], and even before [[Herbert Butterfield]] (1900–1979) harshly criticized it, the Whig interpretation had gone out of style. The bloodletting of that conflict had indicted the whole notion of linear progress. [[Paul Valéry]] famously said: "We civilizations now know ourselves mortal."

However, the notion itself didn't completely disappear. ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) by [[Francis Fukuyama]] proposed a similar notion of progress, positing that the worldwide adoption of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] as the single accredited political system and even modality of human consciousness would represent the "[[End of History]]". Fukuyama's work stems from a [[Alexandre Kojève|Kojevian]] reading of Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807).

Unlike [[Maurice Godelier]] who interprets history as a process of transformation, [[Tim Ingold]] suggests that history is a movement of [[autopoiesis]]<ref>Ingold, T. On the Distinction between Evolution and History. Social Evolution & History,. Vol. 1, num. 1. 2002. Pp. 5-24. P. 9, [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/130380/ socionauki.ru]</ref>

A key component to making sense of all of this is to simply recognize that all these issues in social evolution merely serve to support the suggestion that how one considers the nature of history will impact the interpretation and conclusions drawn about history. The critical under-explored question is less about history as content and more about history as process.

In 2011 [[Steven Pinker]] wrote a history of violence and humanity from an evolutionary perspective in which he shows that violence has declined statistically over time.<ref>" The better angels of our nature, a history of violence and humanity ", by [[Steven Pinker]], published 2012 by Penguin books {{ISBN|978-0-141-03464-5}}</ref>{{Importance inline|date=November 2019}}

== Contextual theories ==

As early as the 18th century, philosophers began focusing on contextual factors contributing to the course of history. Historians of the [[Annales School]], founded in 1929 by [[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Marc Bloch]], were a major landmark in the shift from a history centered on individual [[subject (philosophy)|subjects]] to studies concentrating in [[geography]], economics, [[demography]], and other social forces. [[Fernand Braudel]]'s studies on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as "hero" of history and [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]]'s history of [[climate]] were inspired by this School.

=== Karl Marx ===
[[File:Karl Marx photo from a book by Lenin.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Karl Marx]], founder of [[Marxism]] and [[historical materialism]]]]

[[Karl Marx]] is perhaps the most famous exponent of [[economic determinism]]. For him social institutions like religion, culture and the [[political system]] were merely by-products of the underlying [[economic system]].<ref>[http://economics.mit.edu/files/9658 Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo. Under the Thumb of History? Political institutions and the Scope for Action]</ref> However, he did not see history as completely deterministic. His essay ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'' contains the most famous formulation of Marx's view of the role of the individual in history:

{{quote|Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under given circumstances directly encountered and inherited from the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marx2mao.com/M&E/EBLB52.html|title=The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte|work=marx2mao.com}}</ref>}}

=== Michel Foucault ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}

The historico-political [[discourse]] analyzed by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''Society Must Be Defended'' (1975–76) considers [[truth]] as the fragile product of a historical struggle, first conceptualized as [[race struggle]]—understood not in the modern sense of [[biological race]] but closer to that of a [[people]] or [[nation]]. [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], for example, was an exponent of nobility rights. He claimed that the French nobility were the racial descendants of the Franks who invaded France (while the Third Estate was descended from the conquered Gauls), and had right to power by virtue of [[right of conquest]]. He used this approach to formulate a historical thesis of the course of French political history—a critique of both the monarchy and the Third Estate. Foucault regards him as the founder of the historico-political discourse as political weapon.

In Great Britain, this historico-political discourse was used by the bourgeoisie, the people and the aristocracy as a means of struggle against the monarchy—cf. [[Edward Coke]] or [[John Lilburne]]. In France, [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], [[Nicolas Fréret]], and then [[Sieyès]], [[Augustin Thierry]], and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]] reappropriated this form of discourse. Finally, at the end of the nineteenth century, this discourse was incorporated by racialist biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of race and, even more, transformed this popular discourse into a [[state racism]] in [[Nazism]]. Foucault also presents that [[Marxist]]s too seized this discourse and took it in a different direction, transforming the [[essentialist]] notion of race into the historical notion of [[class struggle]], defined by socially structured position. This displacement of discourse constitutes one of the bases of Foucault's thought—that discourse is not tied to the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], rather the subject is a construction of discourse. Moreover, discourse is not the simple [[ideological]] and mirror reflexion of an economic [[infrastructure]], but is a product and the battlefield of multiples forces—which may not be reduced to the simple dualist [[contradiction]] of two energies.

Foucault shows that what specifies this discourse from the juridical and philosophical discourse is its conception of truth—that truth is no longer absolute, it is the product of race struggle. History itself, which was traditionally the sovereign's science, the [[legend]] of his glorious feats and monument building, ultimately became the discourse of the people, thus a political stake. The subject is not any more a neutral [[arbitrator]], judge, or [[legislator]], as in [[Solon]]'s or Kant's conceptions. Therefore, what became the historical subject must search in history's furor, under the "juridical code's dried blood", the multiple [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingencies]] from which a fragile [[rationality]] temporarily finally emerged. This may be, perhaps, compared to the [[sophist]] discourse in Ancient Greece. Foucault warns that it has nothing to do with [[Machiavelli]]'s or [[Hobbes]]'s discourse on war, for to this popular discourse, the sovereign is nothing more than "an illusion, an instrument, or, at the best, an enemy. It is a discourse that beheads the king, anyway that dispenses itself from the sovereign and that denounces it".

== Other approaches ==

=== Narrative history ===
A current popular conception{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} considers the value of narrative in the writing and experience of history. Important thinkers in this area include [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Louis Mink]], [[W.B. Gallie]], and [[Hayden White]]. Some have doubted this approach because it draws fictional and historical narrative closer together, and there remains a perceived "fundamental bifurcation between historical and fictional narrative" (Ricœur, vol. 1, 52). In spite of this, most modern historians, such as [[Barbara Tuchman]] or [[David McCullough]], consider narrative writing important to their approaches. The theory of narrated history (or historicized narrative) holds that the structure of lived experience, and such experience narrated in both fictional and non-fictional works (literature and historiography) have in common the figuration of "temporal experience." In this way, narrative has a generously encompassing ability to "'grasp together' and integrate ... into one whole and complete story" the "composite representations" of historical experience (Ricœur x, 173). Louis Mink writes that, "the significance of past occurrences is understandable only as they are locatable in the ensemble of interrelationships that can be grasped only in the construction of narrative form" (148). Marxist theorist [[Fredric Jameson]] also analyzes historical understanding this way, and writes that "history is inaccessible to us except in textual form ... it can be approached only by way of prior (re)textualization" (82).

== Education and propaganda ==
{{importance section|date=May 2020}}
{{see also|Philosophy of education|Pedagogy}}

Since [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', civic education and instruction has had a central role in politics and the constitution of a common identity. History has thus sometimes become the target of [[propaganda]], for example in [[historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionist]] attempts. Plato's insistence on the importance of education was relayed by Rousseau's ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'' (1762), a counterpart to ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762). [[Public education]] has been seen by republican regimes and the Enlightenment as a prerequisite of the masses' progressive emancipation, as conceived by Kant in ''[[What is Enlightenment?|Was Ist Aufklärung?]]'' (''What Is Enlightenment?'', 1784).

The creation of modern education systems, instrumental in the construction of [[nation states]], also passed by the elaboration of a common, national history. [[History textbooks]] are one of the many ways through which this common history was transmitted. ''[[Le Tour de France par deux enfants]]'', for example, was the [[French Third Republic]]'s classic textbook for elementary school: it described the story of two French children who, following the German annexation of the [[Alsace-Lorraine]] region in 1870, go on a ''tour de France'' during which they become aware of France's diversity and the existence of the various ''[[patois]]''.
