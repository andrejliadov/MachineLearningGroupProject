The '''history of the [[Jews]] in [[Moldova]]''' reaches back several centuries. [[History of the Jews in Bessarabia|Bessarabian Jews]] have been living in the area for some time. Today, the Jewish community living in Moldova number less than 4,000 according to one estimate<ref name=JVLMd/> while local estimates put the number at 15–20,000 Jews and their family members.<ref name=JMMd>{{cite web |title={{sic|Intoduction|nolink=y}} and History of the Jews in Moldova |url=http://jewishmemory.md/en/}}</ref>

==Bessarabian Jews==
{{main|History of the Jews in Bessarabia}}

===Early history===
[[File:Torah scrolls.JPG|thumb|left|[[Torah]] scrolls presented by Jewish community of [[Chișinău]] to [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] in 1914]]
* 1889: There were 180,918 Jews of a total population of 1,628,867 in Bessarabia
* 1897: The Jewish population had grown to 225,637 of a total of 1,936,392<ref>[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php?reg=31 Первая всеобщая перепись населения Российской Империи 1897 г.

* 1903: [[Chișinău]] (Kishinev) in [[Russian Empire|Russian]] Bessarabia had a Jewish population of 50,000, or 46%, out of a total of approximately 110,000. While almost non-existent in the countryside, Jews had been present in all major towns since the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th. Jewish life flourished with 16 [[Hebrew school|Jewish schools]] and over 2,000 pupils in Chișinău alone.
* 16 February 1903: [[Kishinev pogrom]]
* 1920: The Jewish population had grown to approximately 267,000
* 1930: Romanian census registers 270,000 Jews<ref>{{cite book | work = Recensământul populaţiei din 1930 | pages = XXIV | title = Populaţia pe Neamuri | publisher = Institutul Central de Statistică | url = http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ro/3/3d/Recensamant1930-II-XXIV.jpg | access-date = 2008-07-20 | language = ro }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Kishinev pogrom===
{{main|Kishinev pogrom}}
In 1903, a young [[Christians|Christian]] Russian boy, Mikhail Rybachenko, was found murdered in the town of [[Dubăsari]] (Dubossary), 37&nbsp;km northeast of Chișinău. A [[Russian language]] [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] newspaper "Bessarabian" began to disseminate rumors about the [[Blood libel|murder being part of a Jewish ritual]]. Although the official investigation had determined the lack of any ritualism in the murder and eventually discovered that the boy had been killed by a relative (who was later found), the unrest caused by these and other rumors had resulted in a major [[pogrom]] during the [[Easter]] holidays. The pogrom lasted for three days, without the intervention of the police. Forty seven (some say 49) Jews were killed, 92 severely wounded, 500 slightly wounded and over 700 houses destroyed.<ref name="Judge1995">{{cite book |title=Easter in Kishinev: Anatomy of a Pogrom |last=Judge |first=Edward H. |year=1995 |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=0814742238 |pages=42–47 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_mQhzI-nfHsC&pg=PA48 }}</ref>

Many of the younger Jews, including [[Mendel Portugali]], made an effort to defend the community. There was outcry from prominent Russian writers [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Maksim Gorky]], as well as protests from Jews and non-Jews in Europe and the [[United States]]. [[Haim Nachman Bialik]] wrote about the pogrom in his poem, "The City of Slaughter", and [[Vladimir Korolenko]] in his book, ''House No. 13''.<ref name="bh.org.il">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Kishinev |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/kishinev |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref>

===The Holocaust===
[[File:EvRoMare1930.PNG|thumb|left|Jewish population per county in [[Greater Romania]], according to the 1930 census]]
Up to two-thirds of Bessarabian Jews fled before the retreat of the Soviet troops. 110,033 people from Bessarabia and Bukovina (the latter included at the time the counties of Cernăuţi, Storojineţ, Rădăuţi, Suceava, Câmpulung, and Dorohoi – approximately 100,000 Jews) – all except a small minority of the Jews that did not flee in 1941 – were deported to the [[Transnistria Governorate]], a region which was under Romanian military control during 1941–44.

* 1941: The [[Einsatzkommando]]s, [[Germany|German]] mobile killing units drawn from the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-[[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) and commanded by [[Otto Ohlendorf]] entered Bessarabia. They were instrumental in the massacre of many Jews in Bessarabia, who did not flee in face of the German advancement.
* July 8, 1941: [[Ion Antonescu]], Romania's ruler at the time, made a declaration in front of the Ministers' Council:

:''... With the risk of not being understood by some traditionalists which may be among you, I am in favour of the [[forced migration]] of the entire Jew element from Bessarabia and [[Bukovina]], which must be thrown over the border. Also, I am in favor of the forced migration of the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] element, which does not belong here at this time. I don't care if we appear in history as [[barbarian]]s. The [[Roman Empire]] has made a series of barbaric acts from a contemporary point of view and, still, was the greatest political settlement. There has never been a more suitable moment. If necessary, shoot with the machine gun.''<ref>Quote from "The Stenograms of the Ministers' Council, Ion Antonescu's Government", vol. IV, July–September 1941 period, Bucharest, year 2000, page 57 (''Stenogramele şedinţelor Consiliului de Miniştri, Guvernarea Ion Antonescu'', vol. IV, perioada iulie-septembrie 1941, București, anul 2000, pagina 57.</ref>

The killing squads of [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]], together with special non-military units attached to the German [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[Romania in World War II|Romanian army]] were involved in many massacres in Bessarabia (over 10,000 in a single month of war, in June–July 1941), while deporting other thousands to Transnistria.

In Nazi ghettos organized in several towns, as well as in Nazi concentration camps (there was also a comparable number of Jews from Transnistria in those camps) many people died from starvation or bad sanitation, or were shot by special Nazi units right before the arrival of Soviet troops in 1944. The Romanian military administration of Transnistria kept very poor records of the people in the ghettos and camps. The only exact number found in Romanian sources is 59,392 died in the ghettos and camps from the moment those were open until mid-1943<ref>[http://www.worldwar2.ro/generali/?language=ro&article=96 Maresal Ion Antonescu]. {{in lang|ro}}</ref> This number includes all internees regardless of their origin, but does not include those that perished on the way to the camps, those that perished between mid-1943 and spring 1944, as well as those that perished in the immediate aftermath of the Romanian army's occupation of Transnistria (see for example the [[1941 Odessa massacre|Odessa massacre]]).

==The Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic==
After World War II, the number of Jews in Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic increased significantly, peaking at 98,001 in 1970.<ref>[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_70.php?reg=9 Всесоюзная перепись населения 1970 года. Национальный состав населения по республикам СССР] {{in lang|ru}}</ref> During the 1970s Soviet Union aliyah and especially in the late 1980s, many of them emigrated to Israel. The last [[Soviet Census (1989)|Soviet census of 1989]] registered 65,672 Jews in the Soviet Republic.<ref>[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php?reg=9 Всесоюзная перепись населения 1989 года. Национальный состав населения по республикам СССР.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125044608/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php?reg=9 |date=25 January 2016 }} {{in lang|ru}}</ref>

==Contemporary situation==
As of 2014, there are an estimated 15,000 Jews in Moldova, including over 10,000 in Chișinău alone. At the same time, there are 75,492 Moldovan Jews living in Israel, and also small communities in other parts of the world, such as Russia, the US, the UK, Germany, Romania, Australia etc.

However, antisemitism is still commonplace; several churches and political organisations still refer to antisemitic rhetoric. In addition, far right and neo-Nazi groups are active in the country. Because religion was heavily restricted in Soviet times, it is likely that there are many more people of ethnic Jewish heritage in Moldova than those who practice the religion, but many simply may not know about it.
