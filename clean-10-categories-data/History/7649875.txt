{{Other uses|Hat (disambiguation)}}
The '''History Aptitude Test''' ('''HAT''') is a [[standardized test]] used as part of the admissions process to [[Oxford University]] for undergraduates applying to read History, or a subject including history, for example English with History.

The two-hour test is currently only employed by Oxford University, though other universities are considering adopting a similar examination as part of admissions.

==Criticism==
In 2004 John Dunford, the general secretary of the [[Secondary Heads Association]] complained that the language used in the test could be seen as favouring those from independent schools.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/oct/11/accesstouniversity.highereducation</ref>
