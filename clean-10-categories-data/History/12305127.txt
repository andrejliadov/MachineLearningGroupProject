{{Evolutionary biology}}
The '''history of life''' on [[Earth]] traces the processes by which living and [[fossil]] [[organism]]s evolved, from the earliest emergence of life to the present. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago (abbreviated as Ga (for gigaannum)) and evidence suggests life emerged prior to 3.7 Ga. ago<ref name="Pearce 343–364">{{Cite journal|last1=Pearce|first1=Ben K.D.|last2=Tupper|first2=Andrew S.|last3=Pudritz|first3=Ralph E.|last4=Higgs|first4=Paul G.|date=2018-03-01|title=Constraining the Time Interval for the Origin of Life on Earth|journal=Astrobiology|language=en|volume=18|issue=3|pages=343–364|doi=10.1089/ast.2017.1674|pmid=29570409|bibcode=2018AsBio..18..343P|arxiv=1808.09460|s2cid=4419671}}</ref><ref name="Rosing 674–676">{{Cite journal|last=Rosing|first=Minik T.|date=1999-01-29|title=13C-Depleted Carbon Microparticles in &gt;3700-Ma Sea-Floor Sedimentary Rocks from West Greenland|journal=Science|language=en|volume=283|issue=5402|pages=674–676|doi=10.1126/science.283.5402.674|issn=0036-8075|pmid=9924024|bibcode=1999Sci...283..674R}}</ref><ref name="Ohtomo 25–28">{{Cite journal|last1=Ohtomo|first1=Yoko|last2=Kakegawa|first2=Takeshi|last3=Ishida|first3=Akizumi|last4=Nagase|first4=Toshiro|last5=Rosing|first5=Minik T.|date=January 2014|title=Evidence for biogenic graphite in early Archaean Isua metasedimentary rocks|journal=Nature Geoscience|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=25–28|doi=10.1038/ngeo2025|issn=1752-0908|bibcode=2014NatGe...7...25O}}</ref> (Although there is some evidence of life as early as 4.1 to 4.28 Ga, it remains controversial due to the possible non-biological formation of the purported fossils.<ref name="Pearce 343–364"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Papineau|first1=D.|last2=Gregorio|first2=B.

=== Independent emergence on Earth ===
{{main|Abiogenesis}}
Life on Earth is based on [[carbon]] and [[water]]. Carbon provides stable frameworks for complex chemicals and can be easily extracted from the environment, especially from [[carbon dioxide]].<ref name="PiP" /> There is no other chemical element whose properties are similar enough to carbon's to be called an analogue; [[silicon]], the element directly below carbon on the [[periodic table]], does not form very many complex stable molecules, and because most of its compounds are water-insoluble and because [[silicon dioxide]] is a hard and abrasive solid in contrast to [[carbon dioxide]] at temperatures associated with living things, it would be more difficult for organisms to extract. The elements [[boron]] and [[phosphorus]] have more complex chemistries, but suffer from other limitations relative to carbon. Water is an excellent [[solvent]] and has two other useful properties: the fact that ice floats enables aquatic organisms to survive beneath it in winter; and its molecules have [[electric charge|electrically negative]] and positive ends, which enables it to form a wider range of compounds than other solvents can.

Research on how life might have emerged from non-living chemicals focuses on three possible starting points: [[self-replication]], an organism's ability to produce offspring that are very similar to itself; metabolism, its ability to feed and repair itself; and external [[cell membrane]]s, which allow food to enter and waste products to leave, but exclude unwanted substances.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Peretó |first=Juli |year=2005 |title=Controversies on the origin of life |url=http://www.im.microbios.org/0801/0801023.pdf |journal=[[International Microbiology]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=23–31 |pmid=15906258 |accessdate=2007-10-07 }}</ref> Research on abiogenesis still has a long way to go, since theoretical and [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] approaches are only beginning to make contact with each other.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Szathmáry |first=Eörs |author-link=Eörs Szathmáry |date=February 3, 2005 |title=Life: In search of the simplest cell |journal=Nature |volume=433 |issue=7025 |pages=469–470 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..469S |doi=10.1038/433469a |pmid=15690023 |s2cid=4360797 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Luisi |first1=Pier Luigi |author-link1=Pier Luigi Luisi |last2=Ferri |first2=Francesca |last3=Stano |first3=Pasquale |date=January 2006 |title=Approaches to semi-synthetic minimal cells: a review |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |bibcode=2006NW.....93....1L |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0056-z |pmid=16292523 |s2cid=16567006 }}</ref>

==== Replication first: RNA world ====
{{main|Last universal ancestor|RNA world hypothesis}}
Even the simplest members of the [[Three-domain system|three modern domains]] of life use [[DNA]] to record their "recipes" and a complex array of [[RNA]] and [[protein]] molecules to "read" these instructions and use them for growth, maintenance and self-replication.

In 2003, it was proposed that porous metal sulfide [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitates]] would assist RNA synthesis at about {{convert|100|°C|°F}} and ocean-bottom pressures near [[hydrothermal vent]]s.

==== Metabolism first: Iron–sulfur world ====
{{main|Iron–sulfur world theory}}
A series of experiments starting in 1997 showed that early stages in the formation of proteins from inorganic materials including [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] could be achieved by using [[iron(II) sulfide|iron sulfide]] and [[nickel sulfide]] as [[catalyst]]s. Most of the steps required temperatures of about {{convert|100|°C|°F}} and moderate pressures, although one stage required {{convert|250|°C|°F}} and a pressure equivalent to that found under {{convert|7|km|mi}} of rock. Hence it was suggested that self-sustaining synthesis of proteins could have occurred near hydrothermal vents.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wächtershäuser |first=Günter |author-link=Günter Wächtershäuser |date=August 25, 2000 |title=Life as We Don't Know It |journal=Science |volume=289 |issue=5483 |pages=1307–1308 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5483.1307 |pmid=10979855 }}</ref>

==== The clay hypothesis ====
{{main|Graham Cairns-Smith#Clay hypothesis|RNA world hypothesis}}
RNA is complex and there are doubts about whether it can be produced non-biologically in the wild.<ref name="RNANaturalSynthesisProblems" /> Some [[clay]]s, notably [[montmorillonite]], have properties that make them plausible accelerators for the emergence of an RNA world: they grow by self-replication of their [[crystal]]line pattern; they are subject to an analog of natural selection, as the clay "species" that grows fastest in a particular environment rapidly becomes dominant; and they can catalyze the formation of RNA molecules.<ref>{{harvnb|Cairns-Smith|1968|pp=57–66}}</ref> Although this idea has not become the scientific consensus, it still has active supporters.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ferris |first=James P. |date=June 1999 |title=Prebiotic Synthesis on Minerals: Bridging the Prebiotic and RNA Worlds |journal=[[The Biological Bulletin]] |volume=196 |issue=3 |pages=311–314 |doi=10.2307/1542957 |jstor=1542957 |pmid=10390828 }} "This paper was originally presented at a workshop titled ''Evolution: A Molecular Point of View''."</ref>

Research in 2003 reported that montmorillonite could also accelerate the conversion of [[fatty acid]]s into "bubbles," and that the "bubbles" could encapsulate RNA attached to the clay. These "bubbles" can then grow by absorbing additional lipids and then divide. The formation of the earliest cells may have been aided by similar processes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hanczyc |first1=Martin M. |last2=Fujikawa |first2=Shelly M. |last3=Szostak |first3=Jack W. |author-link3=Jack W.

===Chromatin, nucleus, endomembrane system, and mitochondria===
Eukaryotes may have been present long before the oxygenation of the atmosphere,<ref name="GlansdorffXuLabedan2008LUCA" /> but most modern eukaryotes require oxygen, which their [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] use to fuel the production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the internal energy supply of all known cells.<ref name="HedgesBlairEtAl2004molecularTimescaleOfEukaryoteEvolution" /> In the 1970s it was proposed and, after much debate, widely accepted that eukaryotes emerged as a result of a sequence of endosymbiosis between [[prokaryote]]s. For example: a [[predator]]y microorganism invaded a large prokaryote, probably an [[archaea]]n, but the attack was neutralized, and the attacker took up residence and evolved into the first of the mitochondria; one of these [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]]s later tried to swallow a photosynthesizing cyanobacterium, but the victim survived inside the attacker and the new combination became the ancestor of [[plant]]s; and so on. After each endosymbiosis began, the partners would have eliminated unproductive duplication of genetic functions by re-arranging their genomes, a process which sometimes involved transfer of genes between them.<ref>{{harvnb|Margulis|1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vellai |first1=Tibor |last2=Vida |first2=Gábor |date=August 7, 1999 |title=The origin of eukaryotes: the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=266 |issue=1428 |pages=1571–1577 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0817 |pmc=1690172 |pmid=10467746 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Selosse |first1=Marc-André |last2=Abert |first2=Béatrice |last3=Godelle |first3=Bernard |date=March 1, 2001 |title=Reducing the genome size of organelles favours gene transfer to the nucleus |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Ecology & Evolution]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=135–141 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(00)02084-X |pmid=11179577 }}</ref> Another hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were originally [[sulfur]]- or [[hydrogen]]-metabolising endosymbionts, and became oxygen-consumers later.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pisani |first1=Davide |last2=Cotton |first2=James A. |last3=McInerney |first3=James O. |date=August 2007 |title=Supertrees Disentangle the Chimerical Origin of Eukaryotic Genomes |journal=[[Molecular Biology and Evolution]] |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=1752–1760 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msm095 |pmid=17504772 |doi-access=free }}</ref> On the other hand, mitochondria might have been part of eukaryotes' original equipment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=Michael W. |last2=Burger |first2=Gertraud |last3=Lang |first3=B.

=== Plastids ===
[[Plastid]]s, the superclass of [[organelle]]s of which [[chloroplast]]s are the best-known exemplar, are thought to have originated from [[Endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic]] cyanobacteria. The symbiosis evolved around 1.5 Ga and enabled eukaryotes to carry out [[Carbon fixation#Oxygenic photosynthesis|oxygenic photosynthesis]].<ref name="HedgesBlairEtAl2004molecularTimescaleOfEukaryoteEvolution" /> Three evolutionary lineages have since emerged in which the plastids are named differently: chloroplasts in [[green algae]] and plants, [[rhodoplast]]s in [[red algae]] and [[cyanelle]]s in the [[glaucophyte]]s.

== Sexual reproduction and multicellular organisms ==

=== Evolution of sexual reproduction ===
{{Main|Evolution of sexual reproduction|Sexual reproduction}}
The defining characteristics of [[sexual reproduction]] in eukaryotes are [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]]. There is much [[genetic recombination]] in this kind of reproduction, in which offspring receive 50% of their genes from each parent,<ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /> in contrast with [[asexual reproduction]], in which there is no recombination. Bacteria also exchange DNA by [[bacterial conjugation]], the benefits of which include resistance to [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotic]]s and other [[toxin]]s, and the ability to utilize new [[metabolite]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|Jobling|1996}}</ref> However, conjugation is not a means of reproduction, and is not limited to members of the same species&nbsp;– there are cases where bacteria transfer DNA to plants and animals.<ref name="Christie, P.

On the other hand, bacterial transformation is clearly an adaptation for transfer of DNA between bacteria of the same species. Bacterial transformation is a complex process involving the products of numerous bacterial genes and can be regarded as a bacterial form of sex.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Michod |first1=Richard E. |last2=Bernstein |first2=Harris |last3=Nedelcu |first3=Aurora M. |date=May 2008 |title=Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens |url=http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf |journal=[[Infection, Genetics and Evolution]] |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=267–285 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 |pmid=18295550 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Bernstein |first2=Carol |date=July 2010|title=Evolutionary Origin of Recombination during Meiosis |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=498–505 |doi=10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5  |s2cid=86663600 }}</ref> This process occurs naturally in at least 67 prokaryotic species (in seven different phyla).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Johnsborg |first1=Ola |last2=Eldholm |first2=Vegard |last3=Håvarstein |first3=Leiv Sigve |date=December 2007 |title=Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function |journal=Research in Microbiology |volume=158 |issue=10 |pages=767–778 |doi=10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.004 |pmid=17997281 }}</ref> Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes may have evolved from bacterial transformation.<ref name="novapublishers.com">{{harvnb|Bernstein|Bernstein|Michod|2012|pp=1–50}}</ref> (Also see [[Evolution of sexual reproduction#Origin of sexual reproduction]].)

The disadvantages of sexual reproduction are well-known: the genetic reshuffle of recombination may break up favorable combinations of genes; and since males do not directly increase the number of offspring in the next generation, an asexual population can out-breed and displace in as little as 50 generations a sexual population that is equal in every other respect.<ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage">{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Neiman |first1=Maurine |last2=Jokela |first2=Jukka |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Life Sciences]] |year=2010 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-0-470-01617-6 |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0001716.pub2|chapter=Sex: Advantage }}</ref> Nevertheless, the great majority of animals, plants, fungi and [[protist]]s reproduce sexually.

The [[Red Queen hypothesis]] suggests that sexual reproduction provides protection against [[parasite]]s, because it is easier for parasites to evolve means of overcoming the defenses of genetically identical [[cloning|clone]]s than those of sexual species that present moving targets, and there is some experimental evidence for this. However, there is still doubt about whether it would explain the survival of sexual species if multiple similar clone species were present, as one of the clones may survive the attacks of parasites for long enough to out-breed the sexual species.<ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /> Furthermore, contrary to the expectations of the Red Queen hypothesis, Kathryn A. Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hanley |first1=Kathryn A. |last2=Fisher |first2=Robert N. |last3=Case |first3=Ted J. |date=June 1995 |title=Lower Mite Infestations in an Asexual Gecko Compared With Its Sexual Ancestors |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=418–426 |doi=10.2307/2410266 |jstor=2410266 |pmid=28565091 }}</ref> In addition, biologist Matthew Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in the host.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Matthew A. |date=September 1994 |title=Pathogens and sex in plants |journal=Evolutionary Ecology |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=560–584 |doi=10.1007/bf01238258 |s2cid=31756267 }}</ref>

[[Alexey Kondrashov]]'s ''deterministic mutation hypothesis'' (DMH) assumes that each organism has more than one harmful mutation and the combined effects of these mutations are more harmful than the sum of the harm done by each individual mutation. If so, sexual recombination of genes will reduce the harm that bad mutations do to offspring and at the same time eliminate some bad mutations from the [[gene pool]] by isolating them in individuals that perish quickly because they have an above-average number of bad mutations. However, the evidence suggests that the DMH's assumptions are shaky because many species have on average less than one harmful mutation per individual and no species that has been investigated shows evidence of [[synergy]] between harmful mutations.<ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /> (Further criticisms of this hypothesis are discussed in the article [[Evolution of sexual reproduction#Removal of deleterious genes]])

The random nature of recombination causes the relative abundance of alternative traits to vary from one generation to another. This [[genetic drift]] is insufficient on its own to make sexual reproduction advantageous, but a combination of genetic drift and natural selection may be sufficient. When chance produces combinations of good traits, natural selection gives a large advantage to lineages in which these traits become genetically linked. On the other hand, the benefits of good traits are neutralized if they appear along with bad traits. Sexual recombination gives good traits the opportunities to become linked with other good traits, and mathematical models suggest this may be more than enough to offset the disadvantages of sexual reproduction.<ref name="OttoGerstein2006WhySex" /> Other combinations of hypotheses that are inadequate on their own are also being examined.<ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" />

Birdsell and [[Christopher Wills]].<ref>{{harvnb|Birdsell|Wills|2003|pp=27–137}}</ref> The hypotheses discussed above all depend on the possible beneficial effects of random genetic variation produced by genetic recombination. An alternative view is that sex arose and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that the genetic variation produced is an occasionally beneficial byproduct.<ref name="novapublishers.com" /><ref>{{harvnb|Bernstein|Hopf|Michod|1987|pp=323–370}}</ref>

=== Multicellularity ===

The simplest definitions of "multicellular," for example "having multiple cells," could include [[Colony (biology)|colonial]] cyanobacteria like ''[[Nostoc]]''.

Multicellularity with differentiated cells is beneficial to the organism as a whole but disadvantageous from the point of view of individual cells, most of which lose the opportunity to reproduce themselves. In an asexual multicellular organism, rogue cells which retain the ability to reproduce may take over and reduce the organism to a mass of undifferentiated cells. Sexual reproduction eliminates such rogue cells from the next generation and therefore appears to be a prerequisite for complex multicellularity.<ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" />

The available evidence indicates that eukaryotes evolved much earlier but remained inconspicuous until a rapid diversification around 1 Ga. The only respect in which eukaryotes clearly surpass bacteria and archaea is their capacity for variety of forms, and sexual reproduction enabled eukaryotes to exploit that advantage by producing organisms with multiple cells that differed in form and function.<ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" />

By comparing the composition of transcription factor families and regulatory network motifs between unicellular organisms and multicellular organisms, scientists found there are many novel transcription factor families and three novel types of regulatory network motifs in multicellular organisms, and novel family transcription factors are preferentially wired into these novel network motifs which are essential for multicullular development. These results propose a plausible mechanism for the contribution of novel-family transcription factors and novel network motifs to the origin of multicellular organisms at transcriptional regulatory level.<ref name="MBE_1767">{{cite journal |last1=Jin JP|display-authors=etal| title= An Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory map reveals distinct functional and evolutionary features of novel transcription factors|journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution | date=July 2015 |volume=32 |issue=7|doi=10.1093/molbev/msv058 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/7/1767.full |pmid=25750178 |pmc=4476157 |pages=1767–1773}}</ref>

=== Evolution of terrestrial antioxidants ===
Oxygen is a potent [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] whose accumulation in terrestrial atmosphere resulted from the development of [[photosynthesis]] over 3 Ga, in cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), which were the most primitive oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Brown algae accumulate inorganic mineral [[antioxidant]]s such as [[rubidium]], [[vanadium]], [[zinc]], iron, [[copper]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[iodine]] which is concentrated more than 30,000 times the concentration of this element in seawater. Protective endogenous antioxidant enzymes and exogenous dietary antioxidants helped to prevent oxidative damage. Most marine mineral antioxidants act in the cells as essential [[trace element]]s in [[redox]] and antioxidant [[Metalloprotein|metalloenzymes]].

When plants and animals began to enter rivers and land about 500 Ma, environmental deficiency of these marine mineral antioxidants was a challenge to the evolution of terrestrial life.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Venturi |first=Sebastiano |date=September 2011 |title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine |journal=Current Chemical Biology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=155–162 |doi=10.2174/187231311796765012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Crockford |first=Susan J. |date=August 2009 |title=Evolutionary roots of iodine and thyroid hormones in cell-cell signaling |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=155–166 |doi=10.1093/icb/icp053 |pmid=21669854 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of “new” endogenous antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]], [[polyphenol]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, [[tocopherol]]s, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in last 200–50 Ma, in [[fruit]]s and [[flower]]s of [[angiosperm]] plants.

In fact, angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the [[Late Jurassic]] period. Plants employ antioxidants to defend their structures against [[reactive oxygen species]] produced during photosynthesis.

In aquatic algae, almost all cells are capable of photosynthesis and are nearly independent. Life on land required plants to become internally more complex and specialized: photosynthesis was most efficient at the top; roots were required in order to extract water from the ground; the parts in between became supports and transport systems for water and nutrients.<ref name="CowenHistLifeEd3P120To122" /><ref name="KenrickCrane1997EvolutionOfLandPlants" />

[[Tetrapod]]s, vertebrates with four limbs, evolved from other [[rhipidistia]]n fish over a relatively short timespan during the Late Devonian ({{ma|370|360|Ma|Devonian}}).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Malcolm S. |last2=Graham |first2=Jeffrey B. |last3=Wang |first3=Tobias |date=September–October 2004 |title=Introduction to the Special Collection: Revisiting the Vertebrate Invasion of the Land |journal=[[Physiological and Biochemical Zoology]] |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=697–699 |doi=10.1086/425182 |s2cid=83750933 }}</ref> The early groups are grouped together as [[Labyrinthodontia]]. They retained aquatic, fry-like [[tadpole]]s, a system still seen in [[Lissamphibia|modern amphibians]].

Iodine and T4/T3  stimulate the amphibian metamorphosis and the [[evolution of nervous systems]] transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into  a “more evoluted” terrestrial, carnivorous frog with better neurological, visuospatial, olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine|journal=Current Chemical Biology|volume=5 |pages=155–162|year=2011|doi=10.2174/187231311796765012|issue=3}}</ref>
The new hormonal action of T3 was made possible by the formation of T3-receptors in the cells of vertebrates. Firstly, about 600-500 million years ago, in primitive Chordata appeared the alpha T3-receptors with a metamorphosing action and then, about 250-150 million years ago, in the Birds and Mammalia appeared the beta T3-receptors with metabolic and thermogenetic actions.<ref name=Venturi>{{cite book | last = Venturi | first = S |author2=Bégin ME | year = 2010 | chapter = Thyroid Hormone, Iodine and Human Brain Evolution | title= Environmental Influences on Human Brain Evolution |editor= Cunnane S |editor2=Stewart K | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=gfkRnv20GtsC&pg=PA105#v=onepage&q&f=false 105–124] | isbn = 978-0-470-45268-4}}</ref>

From the 1950s to the early 1980s it was thought that tetrapods evolved from fish that had already acquired the ability to crawl on land, possibly in order to go from a pool that was drying out to one that was deeper. However, in 1987, nearly complete fossils of ''[[Acanthostega]]'' from about {{ma|363|Ma|Devonian}} showed that this Late Devonian [[Transitional fossil|transitional]] animal had [[leg]]s and both [[lung]]s and [[gill]]s, but could never have survived on land: its limbs and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight; its fish-like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground. The current hypothesis is that ''Acanthostega'', which was about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long, was a wholly aquatic predator that hunted in shallow water<!-- , using its limbs to hold on to vegetation while it lay in ambush -->. Its skeleton differed from that of most fish, in ways that enabled it to raise its head to breathe air while its body remained submerged, including: its jaws show modifications that would have enabled it to gulp air; the bones at the back of its skull are locked together, providing strong attachment points for muscles that raised its head; the head is not joined to the [[shoulder girdle]] and it has a distinct neck.<ref name="Clack2005GettingLegUp">{{cite journal |last=Clack |first=Jennifer A. |author-link=Jenny Clack |date=December 2005 |title=Getting a Leg Up on Land |journal=Scientific American |volume=293 |issue=6 |pages=100–107 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1205-100 |pmid=16323697|bibcode=2005SciAm.293f.100C }}</ref>

The Devonian proliferation of land plants may help to explain why air breathing would have been an advantage: leaves falling into streams and rivers would have encouraged the growth of aquatic vegetation; this would have attracted grazing invertebrates and small fish that preyed on them; they would have been attractive prey but the environment was unsuitable for the big marine predatory fish; air-breathing would have been necessary because these waters would have been short of oxygen, since warm water holds less [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] than cooler marine water and since the decomposition of vegetation would have used some of the oxygen.<ref name="Clack2005GettingLegUp" />

Later discoveries revealed earlier transitional forms between ''Acanthostega'' and completely fish-like animals.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Daeschler |first1=Edward B. |author-link1=Ted Daeschler |last2=Shubin |first2=Neil H. |author-link2=Neil Shubin |last3=Jenkins |first3=Farish A., Jr. |author-link3=Farish Jenkins |date=April 6, 2006 |title=A Devonian tetrapod-like fish and the evolution of the tetrapod body plan |url=http://courses.washington.edu/bio354/Paper%203.pdf |journal=Nature |volume=440 |pages=757–763 |issue=7085 |bibcode=2006Natur.440..757D |doi=10.1038/nature04639 |pmid=16598249 |s2cid=4413217 |accessdate=2015-02-12 }}</ref> Unfortunately, there is then a gap ([[Romer's gap]]) of about 30 Ma between the fossils of ancestral tetrapods and Middle Carboniferous fossils of vertebrates that look well-adapted for life on land.

== Social insects ==
[[File:Termite cathedral mounds in a bushfire blackened tropical savanna.jpg|thumb|right|upright|These [[termite]] mounds have survived a bush fire.]]
{{main|Eusociality}}
The social insects are remarkable because the great majority of individuals in each colony are sterile. This appears contrary to basic concepts of evolution such as natural selection and the [[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]. In fact, there are very few [[Eusociality|eusocial]] insect species: only 15 out of approximately 2,600 living [[family (biology)|families]] of insects contain eusocial species, and it seems that eusociality has evolved independently only 12 times among arthropods, although some eusocial lineages have diversified into several families. Nevertheless, social insects have been spectacularly successful; for example although [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s account for only about 2% of known insect species, they form over 50% of the total mass of insects. Their ability to control a territory appears to be the foundation of their success.<ref name="WilsonHölldobler2005EusocialityOriginConsequences">{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Edward O. |author-link1=E. O. Wilson |last2=Hölldobler |first2=Bert |author-link2=Bert Hölldobler |date=September 20, 2005 |title=Eusociality: Origin and consequences |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The sacrifice of breeding opportunities by most individuals has long been explained as a consequence of these species' unusual [[Haplodiploidy|haplodiploid]] method of [[sex-determination system|sex determination]], which has the paradoxical consequence that two sterile worker daughters of the same queen share more genes with each other than they would with their offspring if they could breed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=William O.

O. Wilson]] and [[Bert Hölldobler]] argue that this explanation is faulty: for example, it is based on [[kin selection]], but there is no evidence of [[nepotism]] in colonies that have multiple queens. Instead, they write, eusociality evolves only in species that are under strong pressure from predators and competitors, but in environments where it is possible to build "fortresses"; after colonies have established this security, they gain other advantages through co-operative [[foraging]]. In support of this explanation they cite the appearance of eusociality in [[Blesmol|bathyergid]] mole rats,<ref name="WilsonHölldobler2005EusocialityOriginConsequences" /> which are not haplodiploid.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lovegrove |first=Barry G. |date=January 1991 |title=The evolution of eusociality in molerats (Bathyergidae): a question of risks, numbers, and costs |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=37–45 |doi=10.1007/BF00172137 |s2cid=36466393 }}</ref>

The earliest fossils of insects have been found in Early Devonian rocks from about {{ma|400|Ma|Devonian}}, which preserve only a few varieties of flightless insect. The [[Mazon Creek fossil beds|Mazon Creek lagerstätten]] from the Late Carboniferous, about {{ma|300|Ma|Carboniferous}}, include about 200 species, some gigantic by modern standards, and indicate that insects had occupied their main modern ecological niches as [[herbivore]]s, [[detritivore]]s and insectivores. Social termites and ants first appear in the Early Cretaceous, and advanced social bees have been found in Late Cretaceous rocks but did not become abundant until the Middle [[Cenozoic]].<ref>{{harvnb|Labandeira|Eble|1999}}</ref>

Life on Earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since {{ma|542|Ma}}. Although they were disasters at the time, mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on Earth. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is "superior" to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.<ref name="Van Valkenburgh 1999 463–493"/><ref>{{harvnb|Benton|2005a|loc=Chapter 6: "Tetrapods of the Triassic"}}</ref>

* The oceans may have become more hospitable to life over the last 500&nbsp;Ma and less vulnerable to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of [[eutrophication]] and anoxic events; and marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains were less likely to be disrupted.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Ronald E. |date=June 1995 |title=Cyclic and secular variation in microfossil biomineralization: clues to the biogeochemical evolution of Phanerozoic oceans |journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]] |volume=11 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1016/0921-8181(94)00011-2 |bibcode=1995GPC....11....1M }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Ronald E. |date=June 1996 |title=Secular Increase in Nutrient Levels through the Phanerozoic: Implications for Productivity, Biomass, and Diversity of the Marine Biosphere |journal=PALAIOS |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=209–219 |doi=10.2307/3515230 |jstor=3515230 |bibcode=1996Palai..11..209M }}</ref>
* Reasonably complete fossils are very rare, most extinct organisms are represented only by partial fossils, and complete fossils are rarest in the oldest rocks. So paleontologists have mistakenly assigned parts of the same organism to different genera, which were often defined solely to accommodate these finds—the story of ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' is an example of this. The risk of this mistake is higher for older fossils because these are often both unlike parts of any living organism and poorly conserved. Many of the "superfluous" genera are represented by fragments which are not found again and the "superfluous" genera appear to become extinct very quickly.<ref name="MacLeod2001Extinction" />

[[Biodiversity]] in the fossil record, which is "...the number of distinct genera alive at any given time; that is, those whose first occurrence predates and whose last occurrence postdates that time"<ref name="RohdeMuller2005" /> shows a different trend: a fairly swift rise from {{ma|542|400|Ma}}; a slight decline from {{ma|400|200|Ma}}, in which the devastating Permian–Triassic extinction event is an important factor; and a swift rise from {{ma|200|Ma}} to the present.<ref name="RohdeMuller2005">{{cite journal |last1=Rohde |first1=Robert A. |author-link1=Robert Rohde |last2=Muller |first2=Richard A. |author-link2=Richard A.
