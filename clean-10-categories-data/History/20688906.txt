In the '''aftermath of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]]''', there were multiple and far-ranging events that were observed. Besides the immediate impact on the [[Casualties of the November 2008 Mumbai attacks|victims]] and their families, the attacks caused [[Reactions to the November 2008 Mumbai attacks|widespread anger among the Indian public]], and condemnations from countries throughout the world.

The immediate impact was felt on Mumbai and Maharashtra state, and throughout urban India. There were also after-effects on the Indian government, centre-state relations within India, [[Indo-Pakistani relations]], domestic impact within [[Pakistan]], the [[United States]]'s relationships with both countries, the US-led NATO war in Afghanistan, and on the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terror]].
There was also impact on the region of [[Kashmir]] and this also led to the [[2010 Kashmir Unrest]].

Mumbai police have sent a proposal to the Home Ministry, stating the need to establish direct contact with the FBI, to facilitate investigation in the Mumbai terror attacks.

===Centre-State relations===
The ''National Investigation Agency Bill, 2008'', sets up a central agency for investigating terrorism related crimes. However, law and order is a state subject in the [[Constitution of India]], which had made such a law difficult to pass in the past.

Union Home Minister [[P. Chidambaram]] assured parliament that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) did not usurp the States' right in any manner. The central government would make use of its power only under "extraordinary" circumstances, and depending on the gravity of the situation, he said. "The agency will also have the powers to return the investigations to the State, if it so thinks. We have struck a balance between the right of the States and duties of the Centre to investigate."<ref name="HinduBalance">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/18/stories/2008121856661000.htm |title=Aim is to strike a balance between rights and tough laws: Chidambaram, Aarti Dhar, The Hindu, 17-Dec-2008 |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref>

India handed over two [[demarche]]s to Pakistan – one was submitted at the Foreign Office in Islamabad by Indian High Commissioner Satyabrata Pal. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs also summoned Pakistan High Commissioner Shahid Malik on 1 December 2008, to lodge a formal protest against Pakistan's inaction against terrorist groups operating within the country.<ref name="ndtv.com" />

The Indian foreign ministry released a statement, describing the actions it expects Islamabad to take. "It was conveyed to the Pakistan high commissioner that Pakistan's actions needed to match the sentiments expressed by its leadership, that it wishes to have a qualitatively new relationship with India," the statement said. "He was informed that the recent terrorist attack on Mumbai was carried out by elements from Pakistan. Government expects that strong action would be taken against those elements, whosoever they may be, responsible for this outrage," it said.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-36793420081201?pageNumber=1&virtualBrandChannel=0

The [[CNN-IBN]] reported that India had asked Pakistan to hand over Mumbai Underworld Don [[Dawood Ibrahim]], [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]] chief [[Hafiz Muhammad Saeed]] and [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]] leader [[Maulana Masood Azhar]] for their suspected involvement in the Mumbai terror attack.

Dawood, India's most wanted criminal, is suspected to have helped the LeT terrorists who attacked Mumbai on 26 November. Azhar, founder of the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad, is on India's most wanted list of people it accuses of terrorism. India freed Azhar from prison in exchange for passengers on a hijacked [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://ibnlive.in.com/news/india-asks-for-dawood-masood-azhars-head/79482-3-1.html

''Times of India'', quoting Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, reported: "Now, we have in our demarche asked (for) the arrest and handover of those persons who are settled in Pakistan and who are fugitives of Indian law"

"...there are lists of about 20 persons. (These) lists are sometimes altered and this exercise is going on and we have renewed it in our demarche", Mukherjee said, adding that India "will await" Pakistan's response in the Indian-Arab forum.<ref name="Demarche_to_Pakistan" />

In an interview with [[NDTV]], Pranab Mukherjee had not ruled out the option of military strikes against terror camps in Pakistan. Mukherjee said that every country has the right to protect its territorial integrity, and take appropriate action when necessary. He also said that it has become difficult to continue the peace process with Pakistan in this.<ref name="CNN-IBN" />

====Denials from Pakistan====
Pakistan claimed<ref name="HinduPakDenials">{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/18/stories/2008121856681000.htm |title=No letter from Ajmal: Pakistan, Hindu, 18-Dec-2008 |work=The Hindu |location=India |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref> that it had not received any letter from Mohammad Ajmal Amir, the lone terrorist arrested for the Mumbai attacks, seeking legal aid. It also repeated its denial on his Pakistani nationality, saying it needed "incontrovertible" evidence.<ref name="HinduPakDenials" />

The Mumbai police had said that the captured terrorist Ajmal Amir had written a letter to the Pakistan High Commission in India, asking for help, and that the letter had been given to India's central government. But the Pakistan High Commissioner to India, Shahid Malik, told Karan Thapar in the "India Tonight" program of CNBC TV-18, that no such letter had been received.<ref name="HinduPakDenials" />

According to Pakistan's ''Dawn'' newspaper, Ajmal's father in Pakistan had admitted that the man seen in photographs at the CST railway station was indeed his son. But the High Commissioner said they needed "something which is incontrovertible, which cannot be challenged in a court of law".<ref name="HinduPakDenials" />

Pakistan was also not contemplating giving Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, access to the FBI for investigation.<ref name="HinduPakDenials" />{{clarify|date=January 2019}}

====Interpol involvement====

===Trials in Pakistan===
Indian and Pakistani police had exchanged DNA evidence, photographs, and items found with the attackers, to piece together a detailed portrait of the Mumbai plot. Police in Pakistan had arrested seven people, including Hammad Amin Sadiq, a homoeopathic pharmacist, who arranged bank accounts and secured supplies, and he and six others began their formal trial on 3 October 2009, in Pakistan, though Indian authorities say the prosecution stopped well short of top Lashkar leaders.<ref name="nytfearnewmumbai">{{cite news|last=Polgreen |first=Lydia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/world/asia/30mumbai.html |title=Officials Fear New Mumbai-Style Attack, Lydia Polgreen and Souad Mekhennet, New York Times, 30 September 2009 |location=Pakistan;Mumbai (India) |work=The New York Times |date=3 October 2009 |accessdate=31 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119160509/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/world/asia/30mumbai.html |archivedate=19 January 2012 }}</ref>

===Impact on the United States===
US officials feared that should the firm evidence emerge that the Mumbai terror attacks were planned and directed from within Pakistan, it would certainly escalate tension between the neighbouring countries, and could also provoke an Indian military response, even strikes against terrorists, a media report said on Saturday.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Mumbai-attack-may-trigger-Indian-military-response/392202/| title= Mumbai attack may trigger Indian military response'| date= 29 November 2008| accessdate= 1 December 2008| work= Indian Express| location= India| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202112806/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Mumbai-attack-may-trigger-Indian-military-response/392202/| archivedate= 2 December 2008| url-status= dead| df= dmy-all}}</ref> US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], on Monday, urged Pakistan to give its "absolute, total" cooperation in finding those responsible for last week's attacks on Mumbai.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-36810120081201

Bush, in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. She said that there is need for "direct and tough action" by Islamabad, even if the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks were "non-state actors".<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075131&type=News| title= Rice urges Pakistan for 'direct and tough action' against Mumbai attackers| date= 3 December 2008| accessdate= 5 December 2008| publisher= [[NDTV]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206033521/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/mumbaiterrorstrike/Story.aspx?ID=NEWEN20080075131&type=News| archivedate= 6 December 2008| url-status= dead| df= dmy-all}}</ref>
"Secretary Rice's visit to India is a further demonstration of the United States' commitment to stand in solidarity with the people of India, as we all work together to hold these extremists accountable", White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said in a statement.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed2/idUSTRE4B005O20081201

After visiting India, Condoleezza Rice travelled to Pakistan on 4 December 2008, to talk with the Pakistani government. She is quoted as saying, "We talked at length about the importance of Pakistan taking its responsibility to deal with those who may use Pakistan territory even if they are non-state actors".<ref>{{cite news

However, some of the most wanted names on the list continue to operate openly in Pakistan. No action has been taken against them by the government of Pakistan.<ref name="HafizOpen">[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-pakistan-militants_barkerdec07,0,706488.story Mumbai suspect lives freely in Pakistan, Kim Barker, Chicago Tribune, 07-Dec-2008]</ref>

Police forces in places like New York and Boston practised handling of similar situations, should they occur in the US.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Impact on the United Kingdom===
In the wake of the attacks, a new system of compensation for British citizens caught up in terrorist attacks is being considered. However, "currently the UK government does not guarantee compensation for people injured in attacks abroad".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8059148.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Battle to compensate terror victims | date=22 May 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010 | first=Tom | last=Warren}}</ref>

British police feared similar attacks could occur in the country.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Citizens' movements===
The Mumbai attack also triggered a chain of citizens' movements across India. People from all walks of life hit the streets with candles and placards to pay tributes to the victims of the tragedy almost every weekend after the 26/11 incident. While NSG commandos, Mumbai police officials, hotel staffers, etc. who participated in the operation to eliminate the terrorists became overnight heroes, the wrath of the citizens was directed towards the Government's inability to ensure adequate security to its citizens, and soon led to the chain of resignations, including that of the Indian Home Minister, [[Shivraj Patil]]. The gathering of citizens at the [[Gateway of India]] in Mumbai was unprecedented and historic. From [[India Gate]] and [[Jantar Mantar]] in [[New Delhi]] to marketplaces and street corners all across the country, India witnessed candlelight vigils by the common people. Some organised initiatives to carry forward the citizens' movement included a [[Hindustan Times]]-[[CNN-IBN]] Initiative, [[India Today]] Group's War Against Terror, and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716100610/http://www.hindustanhamara.org/ Hindustan Hamara Citizens' Initiative], besides a large number of blogs on the issue.

===February 2009 video release===
On 25 February 2009, new videos were released off of CCTV, displaying the inside of the hotel where the Mumbai siege took place.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}
