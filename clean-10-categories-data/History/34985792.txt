==International Committee of the Blue Shield (ICBS)==
Following the second World War ''([[World War II]])'', UNESCO adopted the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|Hague Convention]] (1954) creating rules to protect cultural goods during armed conflicts. This Convention was the first international treaty aimed at protecting [[Cultural heritage]] in the context of war and which highlighted the concept of [[Common heritage]]. The International Committee of the Blue Shield (ICBS) is stated in the protocol of the Hague Convention and was created as the equivalent for Heritage of what the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) represents for Humanitarian actions. ICBS incorporated museums and archives, audiovisual supports, libraries, and monuments and sites. It brings together the knowledge, experience and international networks of the following non-governmental organisations dealing with cultural heritage: ICA, [[International Council on Archives]], ICOM, International Council of Museums, IFLA, [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]], ICOMOS, [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] and CCAAA, Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations.
Julien Anfruns was President of the International Committee of the Blue Shield (ICBS) between 2009 and 2013. In 2016, ICBS amalgamated with the Association of National Committees of the Blue Shield (ANCBS) to become [[Blue Shield International|The Blue Shield]].
