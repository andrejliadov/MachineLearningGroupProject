[[File:A history of the world in 100 objects book cover.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of ''A History of the World in 100 Objects'', the companion book by Neil MacGregor]]
'''''A History of the World in 100 Objects''''' was a joint project of [[BBC Radio 4]] and the [[British Museum]], comprising a 100-part radio series written and presented by British Museum director [[Neil MacGregor]]. In 15-minute presentations broadcast on weekdays on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]], MacGregor used objects of ancient art, industry, technology and arms, all of which are in the British Museum's collections, as an introduction to parts of human history.
The series, four years in planning, began on 18 January 2010 and was broadcast over 20 weeks.<ref name=grouplead>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article6718556.ece |publisher=Times Online |title=British Museum and BBC reveal history of world in 100 objects |date=18 July 2009 |author=Ben Hoyle }}

The British Museum won the 2011 [[Art Fund Prize]] for its role in hosting the project.

In 2016, a touring exhibition of several items depicted on the radio program, also titled ''A History of the World in 100 Objects'', travelled to various destinations, including [[Abu Dhabi]] (Manarat Al Saadiyat), Taiwan ([[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei), Japan ([[Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum]] in Tokyo, [[Kyushu National Museum]] in Daizafu, and [[Kobe City Museum]] in Kobe), Australia ([[Western Australian Museum]] in [[Perth]] and [[National Museum of Australia]] in [[Canberra]]), and China ([[National Museum of China]] in Beijing and [[Shanghai Museum]] in Shanghai).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-life/new-exhibition-opening-at-the-national-museum-of-australia-in-canberra-tells-the-history-of-two-million-years-in-100-objects-20160823-gqz91p.html |newspaper=The Canberra Times |publisher=Fairfax Media |title=New exhibition opening at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra tells the history of two million years in 100 objects |first=Sally |last=Pryor |date=26 August 2016 |accessdate=18 January 2017 |archivedate=18 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118113902/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-life/new-exhibition-opening-at-the-national-museum-of-australia-in-canberra-tells-the-history-of-two-million-years-in-100-objects-20160823-gqz91p.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-08/two-million-years-of-human-history-national-museum-canberra/7826960 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 September 2016 |first=Tom |last=Lowrey |title=A History of the World in 100 Objects explored in National Museum of Australia exhibition |url-status=live |accessdate=18 January 2017 |archivedate=18 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218203354/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-08/two-million-years-of-human-history-national-museum-canberra/7826960 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Wang |first=Jie |url=https://archive.shine.cn/metro/society/Big-queues-for-fascinating-world-story-told-through-100-objects/shdaily.shtml |title=Big queues for fascinating world story told through 100 objects |work=[[Shanghai Daily]] |date=29 June 2017 |accessdate=21 June 2019}}</ref>

The programme series, described as "a landmark project",<ref name=DTR>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7020901/A-History-of-the-World-in-100-Objects-Radio-4-review.html |title=A History of the World in 100 Objects, Radio 4, review |author=Gillian Reynolds|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 January 2010 | location=London}}</ref> is billed as 'A history of humanity' told through a hundred objects from all over the world in the British Museum's collection.

{{quote|In these programmes, I'm travelling back in time, and across the globe, to see how we humans over 2 million years have shaped our world and been shaped by it, and I'm going to tell this story exclusively through the things that humans have made: all sorts of things, carefully designed, and then either admired and preserved, or used, broken and thrown away. I've chosen just a hundred objects from different points on our journey, from a cooking pot to a golden galleon, from a Stone Age tool to a credit card.<ref name="auto">Neil MacGregor, Programme 1, broadcast 18 January 2010</ref>}}

{{quote|Telling history through things, whether it's an Egyptian mummy or a credit card, is what museums are for, and because the British Museum has collected things from all over the globe, it's not a bad place to try to tell a world history. Of course, it can only be "a" history of the world, not "the" history. When people come to the museum they choose their own objects and make their own journey round the world and through time, but I think what they will find is that their own histories quickly intersect with everybody else's, and when that happens, you no longer have a history of a particular people or nation, but a story of endless connections.<ref name="auto"/>}}

Accompanying the series is a website, described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "even more ambitious [than the radio series itself] that encourages users to submit items of their own for a place in world history", along with much interactive content, detailed information on all the objects featured in the radio programmes and links to 350 other museum collections across the UK.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/jan/18/100-objects-bbc-online-history | work=The Guardian| location=London | title=Beyond 100 objects: exploring the BBC's online history of the world | date=19 January 2010 | accessdate=23 April 2010 | first=Mercedes | last=Bunz}}</ref> The radio programmes are available on the website permanently for listening or downloading.

The museum has adapted exhibitions for the series by including additional easily identifiable plaques for the 100 objects with text based on the programme and adding a section to the gallery maps showing the location and numbers of the 100 objects.

On 18 January 2010, an hour-long special of ''[[The Culture Show]]'' on [[BBC2]] was dedicated to the launch of the project.<ref name=CS>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00q9xsc |publisher=BBC The Culture Show|date=18 January 2010 |title= History of the World: Culture Show Special}}</ref>

The first part of the series was broadcast on weekdays over six weeks between 18 January and 26 February 2010. After a short break, the series returned with the seventh week being broadcast in the week beginning 17 May 2010.<ref>{{cite news|author=Elisabeth Mahoney |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/may/18/history-of-the-world-100-objects |title=A History of the World in 100 Objects |work=The Guardian|date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2010-06-10 | location=London}}</ref> It then took another break in the middle of July and returned on 13 September 2010, running until the 100th object was featured on Friday 22 October 2010.

==Reception==
[[Maev Kennedy]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the programme as "a broadcasting phenomenon", while Tim Davie, head of music and audio at BBC radio, commented that "the results have been nothing short of stunning", exceeding the BBC's wildest hopes for the programme. At the time of the writing of Kennedy's article, just before the start of the last week of the series, the radio broadcasts regularly had up to four million listeners, while the podcast downloads had totalled 10,441,884. Of these, just over half, 5.7 million, were from the UK.  In addition, members of the public had uploaded 3,240 objects with the largest single contribution coming from Glasgow historian Robert Pool who submitted 120 objects all relating to the City of Glasgow, and other museums a further 1,610, and 531 museums and heritage sites across the UK had been mounting linked events – an unprecedented partnership, MacGregor said. Museums all over the world are now copying the formula, as thousands of visitors every day set out to explore the British Museum galleries equipped with the leaflet mapping the objects.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/14/radio-4-history-world-objects|work=The Guardian|date=14 October 2010 |author=Maev Kennedy |title=Radio 4's A History of the World in 100 Objects draws to a close}}</ref>

Writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', [[Philip Hensher]] described the series as "perfect radio", saying "Has there ever been a more exciting, more unfailingly interesting radio series than the Radio 4/British Museum venture, A History of the World in 100 Objects? It is such a beautifully simple idea, to trace human civilisations through the objects that happen to have survived. Each programme, just 15 minutes long, focuses on just one thing, quite patiently, without dawdling. At the end, you feel that you have learnt something, and learnt it with pleasure and interest.  For years to come, the BBC will be able to point to this wonderful series as an example of the things that it does best. It fulfils, to a degree that one thought hardly possible any more, the BBC's [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith#Reithianism|Reithian]] agenda of improvement and the propagation of learning and culture."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/philip-hensher/philip-hensher-the-objects-of-my-affection-2106649.html|work=The Independent|date=15 October 2010 |author=Philip Hensher |title=Philip Hensher: The objects of my affection
}}</ref>

[[Dominic Sandbrook]] in ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' said that the "joyously highbrow" series "deserves to take its place alongside television classics such as [[Kenneth Clark]]'s ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' and [[Jacob Bronowski]]'s ''[[The Ascent of Man]]''."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8057212/An-object-lesson-in-history-from-Radio-Four.html|work=The Telegraph|date=11 October 2010 |author=Dominic Sandbrook|title=An object lesson in history from Radio Four}}</ref>

== Special edition ==
A special radio programme on Radio 4, first broadcast on 18 May 2011, featured one of the many thousands of items nominated on the BBC website by members of the public as an object of special significance.<ref name="telegraph-2011-05-12">{{cite news | author=Gillian Reynolds | title=A History of the World Special, Radio 4, preview | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=12 May 2011 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8509588/A-History-of-the-World-Special-Radio-4-preview.html }}</ref> The object chosen to be featured on the programme was an oil painting depicting a young woman that was nominated by Peter Lewis.  The painting, which belonged to Lewis' uncle, Bryn Roberts, was painted from a postcard photograph of Roberts' girlfriend (and later wife), Peggy Gullup, by an anonymous Jewish artist for Roberts whilst he was a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in Poland.<ref name="special">{{cite web | title=A History of the World Special | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b010y36c/A_History_of_the_World_Special/ | publisher=BBC Radio 4 }}</ref><ref name="thejc">{{cite news | author=Jessica Elgot | title=He put colour in her cheeks: did her smile save his life? | publisher=[[Jewish Chronicle]] | date=19 May 2011 | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/49167/he-put-colour-her-cheeks-did-her-smile-save-his-life }}</ref>

== Art Fund Prize ==
The British Museum won the 2011 [[Art Fund Prize]] for museums and galleries for its part in the ''A History of the World in 100 Objects'' series.  The prize, worth £100,000, was presented to the museum by [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]], Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, in a ceremony at London on 15 June 2011.<ref name="guardian-2011-06-15">{{cite news | author=Mark Brown | title=British Museum wins Arts Fund prize | work=The Guardian| date=15 June 2011 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jun/15/british-museum-wins-arts-fund-prize }}</ref>

The chairman of the panel of judges, [[Michael Portillo]], noted that the judges were "particularly impressed by the truly global scope of the British Museum's project, which combined intellectual rigour and open heartedness, and went far beyond the boundaries of the museum's walls".<ref name="artfund">{{cite web | title=British Museum scoops £100,000 Art Fund Prize and is crowned 'Museum of the Year' | publisher=[[The Art Fund]] | url=http://www.artfundprize.org.uk/art-fund-prize-winner-announced.php | access-date=15 June 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619203824/http://www.artfundprize.org.uk/art-fund-prize-winner-announced.php | archive-date=19 June 2011 | url-status=dead}}</ref> The judges were also very impressed by the way that the project used digital media in ground-breaking and novel ways to interact with audiences.<ref name="artfund"/>

==Touring exhibition==
During 2016 and 2017 a touring exhibition of many of the one hundred objects, also titled ''History of the World in 100 Objects'', was held in a number of countries and territories, including Australia, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Taiwan, and China (first at the [[National Museum of China]] in Beijing, and then at [[Shanghai Museum]]).<ref>{{Cite web | title=International exhibitions: A History of the World in 100 Objects | url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/tours_and_loans/international_exhibitions/history_of_the_world.aspx | publisher=British Museum | accessdate=29 January 2018 }}</ref><ref name="china-daily-2018">{{Cite web | last=Zhao | first=Xu | title=Global treasures on the Chinese stage | url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201801/27/WS5a6be5cea3106e7dcc1371d0_1.html | publisher=[[China Daily]] | date=27 January 2018 | accessdate=29 January 2018 }}</ref> Due to the conditions encountered while touring different countries some exhibits had to be returned to the British Museum for maintenance during tour, and were replaced by other objects from the British Museum collections. Some controversial exhibits were excluded from the exhibition in some countries. Object 90 (Jade bi with poem) was not included in the exhibition held in China because it may have been looted from the [[Old Summer Palace]] in Beijing. In addition, a piece of Chinese brocade that had been included in the touring exhibition elsewhere was not included in the exhibition in China because it was collected from the [[Mogao Caves]] by [[Aurel Stein]] under controversial circumstances.<ref name="china-daily-2018"/>
