The '''Jefferson–Hemings controversy''' is a historical debate over whether there was a sexual relationship between [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] and his slave, [[Sally Hemings]], and whether he fathered some or all of her six recorded children. For more than 150 years, most historians denied rumors from Jefferson's presidency that he had a slave [[concubine]]. Based on his grandson's report, they said that one of his nephews had been the father of Hemings' children. Before changing his mind following the results of DNA analysis in 1998, Jefferson biographer [[Joseph J. Ellis]] had said, "The alleged liaison between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings may be described as the longest-running miniseries in American history."<ref>[http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/jefferson/ Edward J. Gallagher, About], ''The Jefferson-Hemings Controversy'' website, History on Trial, Digital Library at Lehigh University, accessed 3 September 2014</ref>  In the 21st century, most historians agree that Jefferson is the father of one or more of Sally's children.<ref name=NationalExpansion>{{cite web|title=Thomas Jefferson|url=http://www.nps.gov/jeff/historyculture/thomas-jefferson.htm|work=Jefferson National Expansion Memorial|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=May 2, 2012}}</ref><ref name=MillerCenter>{{cite web|title=Thomas Jefferson|url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/jefferson/essays/biography/1|work=American President A Reference Resource|publisher=Miller Center – University of Virginia|access-date=May 2, 2012|page=1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505114527/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/jefferson/essays/biography/1|archive-date=May 5, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Beginning in 1953, new documentation related to this issue was published and studied by historians. In a 1972 article in ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''<ref name="Brody, Am Heritage">{{cite journal |last1=Brody |first1=Fawn |title=The Great Jefferson Taboo |journal=American Heritage Magazine |volume= 23, No 4 |issue=June 1972 |url=https://www.americanheritage.com/great-jefferson-taboo}}</ref> and later in her bestselling 1974 biography of Jefferson, [[Fawn M. Brodie]] suggested Jefferson had been the father of Hemings' children.

In 1997 the controversy was reopened when [[Annette Gordon-Reed]] published an analysis of the historiography on this issue, deconstructing previous versions and detailing oversights and bias.<ref name="ep12">[http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/jefferson/episodes/list/12_1 Gallagher, "Episode 12: Overview"], ''Jefferson-Hemings Controversy''</ref> That year [[Ken Burns]] released his documentary on Jefferson as a PBS series. African-American historian [[John Hope Franklin]] noted all the [[mulatto]]s and mixed-race slaves of the period and said, "These things [interracial liaisons] were part of the natural landscape in Virginia, and Mr. Jefferson was as likely as any others to have done this because it's in character with the times—and indeed, with him, who believed in exploiting these people that he controlled completely."<ref name="ep12"/>

Historically, in the 1850s Jefferson's eldest grandson, [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]], told historian Henry Randall that the late [[Peter Carr (Virginia politician)|Peter Carr]], a married nephew of Jefferson's (the son of his sister), had fathered Hemings' children; Randolph asked Randall to refrain from addressing the issue in his biography. Randall passed on this information to James Parton, another historian. Parton published the Carr story, and major historians of Jefferson generally denied Jefferson's paternity for nearly 150 years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Looney|first1=J. Jefferson|title=Peter Carr (1770–1815)|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Carr_Peter_1770-1815|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Virginia]]|access-date=13 July 2015}}</ref>

While some historians challenged the denial, a changed consensus did not emerge until after a [[Y chromosome]] DNA analysis was done in 1998. The DNA study showed a match between a descendant of the Jefferson male line, a descendant of Field Jefferson, and a descendant of [[Eston Hemings]], Sally's youngest son. It showed no match between the Carr line and the Hemings descendant.

In 2000, a consensus, generated by the DNA study titled "Jefferson Fathered Slave's Last Child," emerged among historians. In the majority view, the DNA evidence is consistent with Jefferson being the father of Eston Hemings, plus the historical evidence favors Jefferson's paternity for all of Hemings' children.<ref name="PBS">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/true/ ''Jefferson's Blood''], PBS Frontline, 2000, accessed March 10, 2012. Quote: "Now, the new scientific evidence has been correlated with the existing documentary record, and a consensus of historians and other experts who have examined the issue agree that the question has largely been answered: Thomas Jefferson fathered at least one of Sally Hemings' children, and quite probably all six."</ref> The [[Monticello]] Foundation commissioned its study, which in 2001 concluded Jefferson was likely the father of Eston Hemings and the other children. Since then the organization has reflected this change in its exhibits, as well as publications about Jefferson and his times. The revelations have stimulated works by a variety of scholars, who have used the consensus as a basis for studies into Jefferson, the Hemings family, and interracial American society. In June 2018, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, with introduction of the new exhibit on Sally Hemings, asserted the relationship is "settled historical matter".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/blog-and-community/monticello-affirms-thomas-jefferson-fathered-children-sally-hemings|title=Monticello Affirms Thomas Jefferson Fathered Children with Sally Hemings|website=monticello|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref>

==Background==
Jefferson became a widower at age 39 in 1782. He never remarried and died in 1826. Sally Hemings, a “[[quadroon]]” (3/4 white), was his much younger slave and a likely half-sister of his wife. She accompanied his daughter Maria to France in 1787, when Hemings was 14, where they are believed to have started a sexual relationship at some time before 1789, when she returned with him to Monticello. Most historians now believe that this relationship lasted nearly four decades, until Jefferson's death, and that he fathered six children by Hemings.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.monticello.org/site/plantation-and-slavery/thomas-jefferson-and-sally-hemings-brief-account | title=Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account | publisher=Thomas Jefferson Foundation | access-date=December 30, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/president/biography/jefferson-life-in-brief |title = Thomas Jefferson | publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia |author = Peter Onuf, editor | access-date=December 31, 2015}}</ref>

Four of Hemings' children survived to adulthood. In the [[antebellum period]], hers would have been called a "shadow family".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Jan|title=Sally Hemings & Thomas Jefferson: History, Memory, and Civic Culture|page=14}}</ref> Sally Hemings was also the child of a shadow family. Historians believe her father to have been [[John Wayles]], Jefferson's father-in-law, who as a widower had a 12-year liaison with his [[mulatto]] slave [[Betty Hemings]] and fathered six children with her. These [[quadroon]] children had three-quarters European, one-quarter African ancestry, and were half-siblings to Jefferson's wife [[Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson]].<ref>{{cite web|title=John Wayles|url=http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/john-wayles|website=monticello.org|access-date=September 23, 2014}}</ref> [[Sally Hemings]] is the youngest child of this shadow family.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gordon-Reed|title=The Hemings of Monticello|page=80}}</ref>  [[Issac Jefferson]] described Sally as "mighty near white ... very handsome, long straight hair down her back."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/thomas-jefferson-s-enslaved-mistress-sally-hemings-living-quarters-found-n771261|title=Historians uncover slave quarters of Sally Hemings at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello|website=nbcnews.com|access-date=July 12, 2017}}</ref>

Of the four Hemings children who survived to adulthood: William Beverley, [[Harriet Hemings|Harriet]], [[Madison Hemings|Madison]] and [[Eston Hemings]]—all but Madison Hemings eventually identified as white and lived as adults in white communities. Under the Virginia law of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]],'' because Sally Hemings was a slave, her children were also born enslaved. But the children were seven-eighths European, one-eighth African by ancestry. If free, they would have been considered legally white in Virginia of the time.<ref name="Kolchin17">Kolchin, Peter ''American Slavery, 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 17</ref><ref name="Banks">[http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/fac_pubs/52/ Taunya Lovell Banks, "Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit -Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth-Century Colonial Virginia"], 41 ''Akron Law Review'' 799 (2008), Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School, accessed Apr 21, 2009</ref>

==Controversy==
===Early claims===
[[File:Cock ca1804 attrib to JamesAkin AmericanAntiquarianSociety.png|thumb|right|Caricature of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Sally Hemings]], ca.1804, attributed to [[James Akin (artist)|James Akin]] (American Antiquarian Society)]]
In 1802 the journalist [[James T. Callender]], after being refused an appointment to a [[Postmaster]] position by Jefferson and issuing veiled threats of "consequences," reported that Jefferson had fathered several children with a slave [[concubine]] named Sally. His family denied the allegation. Others privately or publicly made the claim.<ref>Annette Gordon-Reed, ''[[The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family]]'', New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2008, pp. 555, 616–17</ref>  [[Elijah Fletcher]], the headmaster of the New Glasgow Academy ([[Amherst County, Virginia]]) visited Jefferson in 1811 and wrote in his diary:

{{quote|The story of black Sal is no farce—That he cohabits with her and has a number of children by her is a sacred truth—and the worst of it is he keeps the same children slaves—an unnatural crime which is very common in these parts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ed. Thos. Jefferson Loony|title="Elijah Flecther's Account of a Visit to Monticello" May 8, 1811|year=2006|publisher=Princeton|location=Thos. Jefferson Papers, Retirement Series, Vol. 3|page=610|display-authors=etal}}</ref>}}

Jefferson made no public comment on the matter, although most historians interpret his cover letter from 1805 to Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith as a denial alluding to a fuller reply, which has been lost.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/cron/ "Chronology": ''Jefferson's Blood''], PBS Frontline, 2000</ref>

The Jefferson-Wayles descendants and most historians denied for nearly 200 years that he was the father of Hemings' children. Since the mid-20th century, there have been challenges to that denial, as historians have re-examined some of the evidence and thought to interpret it differently. Disagreements have arisen since the late 20th century over how to interpret historical evidence related to the issue. According to an 1868 letter by Jefferson biographer [[Henry S. Randall]] to the historian [[James Parton]], Jefferson's grandson, [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]], said that Jefferson's surviving daughter Martha stated on her deathbed that Jefferson had been away from Monticello for 15 months before one of Hemings' children was born, so could not be the father. But historian [[Dumas Malone]] later documented that Jefferson had been at Monticello nine months before the birth of each of Hemings' children.<ref name="auto">Gordon-Reed, ''An American Controversy'', 1997, pp.&nbsp;80–83</ref>

Randolph also said: 
 
{{quote|[S]he [Hemings] had children which resembled Mr. Jefferson so closely that it was plain that they had his blood in their veins&nbsp;... He [Randolph] said in one instance, a gentleman dining with Mr. Jefferson, looked so startled as he raised his eyes from the latter to the servant behind him, that his discovery of the resemblance was perfectly obvious to all.<ref name="Randall"/>}}

Randolph told Randall that the late [[Peter Carr (Virginia politician)|Peter Carr]], Jefferson's nephew by his sister and a married man at the time, had fathered Hemings' children, as an explanation for the "startling" close resemblance that every visitor to Monticello could see. According to legal professor [[Annette Gordon-Reed]], by this act, he was violating a strong social taboo against naming a white man as the father of slave children, to explain the strong physical resemblance seen by visitors. She suggested he would only have done so for the more compelling reason of protecting his grandfather.<ref name="Gordon-Reed, pp. 80–83">Gordon-Reed, ''American Controversy,'' pp.&nbsp;80–83</ref>

Because of the social taboos about this topic, Randolph requested, and Randall agreed, to omit any mention of Hemings and her children in Randall's three-volume biography, ''Life of Thomas Jefferson'' (1858).<ref name="Randall">{{cite web|title=Letter from Henry Randall to James Parton, June 1, 1868|work=Jefferson's Blood|publisher=PBS Frontline| year=2000| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/cron/1868randall.html|access-date=September 18, 2011}}</ref> But Randall passed on the Randolph oral history in a letter to the historian [[James Parton]]. He also suggested that he had personally seen records supporting it – but no such record has been found. Randall's 1868 letter relating Randolph's family account of the Peter Carr paternity was a "pillar" of later historians' assertions that Carr was the father of Hemings' children, and Jefferson was not.<ref name="Gordon-Reed, pp. 80–83" />

===Claims of Madison Hemings===
[[File:The Liberator - Jefferson's son.jpg|thumb|200px|left|19 December 1845 article in ''The Liberator'' reporting on the lack of rights for Eston or Madison in Ohio]]
In November 1845, Ohio newspapers reported that one of Jefferson's sons by Sally Hemings living in a central Ohio county was not allowed to vote or testify in court due to Ohio laws regarding his race.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Jefferson injured in the person of his descendants|date=19 November 1845|work=Cleveland American|page=2}}</ref> The story was subsequently reported by [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jaoC2BtS4OIC|title=Sally Hemings & Thomas Jefferson: History, Memory, and Civic Culture|last1=Lewis|first1=Jan|last2=Onuf|first2=Peter S.|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=1999|isbn=9780813919195|location=Charlottesville|pages=165, 182n6|language=en}}</ref>

On July 7, 1870, [[Chillicothe, Ohio]] census taker William Weaver noted in his official census book beside the entry for "Hemmings, Madison", recording "This man is the son of Thomas Jefferson."<ref name="madisoncensus">{{cite web|url=http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/files/2012/11/1870UnitedStatesFederalCensus.jpg|title=1870 census page|website=encyclopediavirginia.org|access-date=July 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216214521/http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/files/2012/11/1870UnitedStatesFederalCensus.jpg|archive-date=February 16, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1873, the issue received renewed, widespread attention after publication of an interview with [[Madison Hemings]], who asserted that Jefferson was his father. He was interviewed about his life as a slave at Monticello, and his account was published in an Ohio newspaper. Then age 68, Hemings claimed Jefferson as his and his siblings' father. He said that when Jefferson and Sally Hemings were still in Paris, she became pregnant with his child. Slaves could petition for their freedom in France, and Hemings initially demurred when Jefferson asked her to return with him to Virginia.  Based on Jefferson's promise to free her children when they came of age, she returned with him to the United States from France.<ref name="madisonstatement">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/cron/1873march.html ''The Memoirs of Madison Hemings''], Thomas Jefferson: ''Frontline'', PBS-WGBH</ref> [[Israel Jefferson]], also a former slave of Monticello, confirmed the account of Jefferson's paternity of Hemings' children in his own interview published that year by the same Ohio newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|title=The memoirs of Israel Jefferson|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/cron/1873israel.html|publisher=pbs.org|access-date=September 23, 2014}}</ref> Critics attacked the newspaper account as politically motivated and the former slaves as mistaken, or worse.<ref name="attacks">{{cite news|last1=Gordon-Reed|first1=Annette|title=Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy|url=http://www.cnn.com/books/beginnings/9903/thomas.jefferson/|access-date=September 25, 2014|publisher=cnn|date=March 3, 1999}}</ref>

In 1874, James Parton published his biography of Jefferson, in which he attributed the content of Madison Hemings' memoir to the political motives of a journalist who interviewed him. He and other critics essentially discounted Madison's memoir, while attributing to him a range of negative motives for telling his story. In his work, Parton repeated the Jefferson family's oral history about a Carr paternity and the claim that Jefferson was absent during the conception period of one of Hemings' children.<ref>Gordon-Reed, ''American Controversy,'' pp. 24, 81</ref><ref>Allison, Andrew, K. DeLynn Cook, M. Richard Maxfield, W. Cleon Skousen, ''The Real Thomas Jefferson'', pp.&nbsp;232–33, National Center for Constitutional Studies, Washington, D.C.</ref>

===Modern historians===
Succeeding 20th-century historians, such as [[Merrill Peterson]] and [[Douglass Adair]], relied on Parton's book as it related to the controversy.<ref>Gordon-Reed, ''American Controversy,'' p. 81</ref> In turn, [[Dumas Malone]] adopted their position. In the 1970s, as part of his six-volume biography of Jefferson, Malone was the first to publish a letter by Ellen Randolph Coolidge, Randolph's sister that added to the Carr paternity story. But she claimed that the late Samuel Carr, brother to Peter and also a nephew of Jefferson's through his sister, had fathered Hemings' children. Like Peter, Samuel was married when Hemings' children were born. Neither of the Randolphs named Jefferson's nephews as putative fathers of Hemings' children until after the men had died.<ref>Gordon-Reed, ''American Controversy,'' pp.&nbsp;81–83</ref>

The above 20th-century historians and other major biographers of the late 20th century, such as [[Joseph Ellis]] and [[Andrew Burstein]], "defended" Jefferson based on the Jefferson/Randolph family testimony: saying that he was absent at the conception of one Hemings child, and the family identified Peter or Samuel Carr as father(s) of Hemings' children.<ref>Gordon-Reed, ''American Controversy'', pp.&nbsp;83–84</ref> Also, the historians concluded from their interpretations of Jefferson's personality and views that he would not have had such a relationship. They noted he had expressed antipathy to blacks and [[miscegenation]] in his writings, and he was thought to have a "high" moral character.<ref name="Gordon-Reed, pp. 14-22">Gordon-Reed, ''American Controversy,'' pp.&nbsp;14–22</ref>

The manuscripts for ''Thomas Jefferson's Farm Books'' were rediscovered and published for the first time in 1953, edited by Edwin M. Betts. They provided extensive data about slaves and slave births, including all of Sally Hemings' children, and have been used extensively by researchers.

Black oral history preserved the account of the Jefferson-Hemings relationship and the place of African Americans at the center of United States history. Black historians began to publish material related to the mixed-race Hemings descendants. [[Lerone Bennett]], in his article, "Thomas Jefferson's Negro Grandchildren," published in ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' in November 1954, examined the current lives of individuals claiming descent from this union.<ref name="bennett">Lerone Bennett, "Thomas Jefferson's Negro Grandchildren," ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', Vol. X (November 1954), pp.&nbsp;78–80</ref>

In 1961, historian Pearl M. Graham published an article in the ''[[Journal of Negro History]]'' on Jefferson and Hemings. It was based on material from the ''Farm Books,'' as well as a detailed timeline of Jefferson's activities developed by historian [[Dumas Malone]] in his extensive biography. This was published in several volumes beginning in the 1940s. Graham noted that Hemings conceived her children only when Jefferson was in residence at Monticello, during a time when he traveled frequently and was away for lengthy periods. Graham also provided biographical information on Sally's children; she supported accounts that Hemings and Jefferson had several children together.<ref>Graham, Pearl M. "Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings," ''[[Journal of Negro History]]'' 46, Vol. XLIX, No. 2 (April 1961): 89–103.</ref>

In 1972, [[Fawn M. Brodie]] published "The Great Jefferson Taboo" in ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' magazine.<ref name="Brody, Am Heritage" /> She addressed the rumors of Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemings, his [[quadroon]] slave, conducted extensive research, and concluded that they had a long relationship.<ref name="brodie"/> Anticipating "inevitable controversy", the magazine broke with its usual practice and published Brodie's extensive footnotes for her article.<ref name="brodie">Brodie, Fawn D., ''[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/great-jefferson-taboo?page=show The Great Jefferson Taboo],'' ''American Heritage'' Magazine, June 1972, Volume 23.</ref><ref>PBS.org, ''Frontline'', "[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/cron/ The History of a Secret]."</ref>

==Evidence ==
In 1953, ''Thomas Jefferson's Farm Book'' was published in an edited version, after having been rediscovered. Its records of slave births, deaths, purchases and sales, and other information has provided researchers with considerable data about the lives of slaves at Monticello, including the births of all Sally Hemings' known children.<ref name="Farm Book">{{cite web | url=http://www.masshist.org/thomasjeffersonpapers/farm/index.html | title=Thomas Jefferson Farm Book, [manuscript], 1774–1824 | publisher=Massachusetts Historical Society | work=Thomas Jefferson Papers: An Electronic Archive | access-date=April 12, 2013}}</ref>

[[Dumas Malone]] documented Jefferson's activities and residencies through the years. His documentation in his multi-volume biography (published 1948–1981) provided the details that Pearl Graham analyzed to show Jefferson was at Monticello for the conception of each of Hemings' children. She never conceived when he was not there. Martha Randolph, Jefferson's daughter with Martha Wayles Jefferson, had made a deathbed claim that Jefferson was away for a 15-month period during which one of the Hemings children was conceived. Gordon-Reed shows this claim is not supported by Malone's documentation; Jefferson was at Monticello at the time of conception of each child.<ref name="auto"/><ref>Halliday (2001), ''Understanding Thomas Jefferson'', pp.&nbsp;162–67</ref>

In 1968 the historian [[Winthrop Jordan]] said that Jefferson was at Monticello "nine months prior to each birth" of Hemings' children, during a 13-year period when he was often away for months at a time. He acknowledged that the relationship was possible.<ref>Winthrop Jordan, ''White over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550–1812'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1968.</ref> Fawn Brodie also used this information in her biography of Jefferson, which contributed to her conclusion that he had fathered Hemings' children.<ref name="Brodie">Fawn McKay Brodie, ''Thomas Jefferson, An Intimate History'' (1974).</ref> The source for the birth dates of the children is Jefferson's Farm Book.<ref name="appleby">Appleby, Joyce Oldham and Arthur Schlesinger. ''Thomas Jefferson''. New York: Macmillan, 2003, pp.&nbsp;75–77.</ref>

In 2000, a statistical analysis of the conception data and Jefferson's residencies concluded it was 99 percent likely that he was the father of her children, and that there was only a 1 percent chance that he was not the father of all her children. This analysis, commonly referred to as a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]], was done by Fraser D. Neiman, head of archaeology at Monticello.<ref name="Neiman">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2674366 Fraser D. Neiman, "No Access Coincidence or Causal Connection?

The Hemings children were named for people in the Randolph-Jefferson family or who were important to Jefferson, rather than for people in the Hemings family. When mixed-race children were sired by the master, they were frequently named after people from his family.<ref name="Annette Gordon-Reed 1997 pp. 210-223">Annette Gordon-Reed (1997), ''American Controversy'', pp.&nbsp;210–23</ref> Jefferson gave the Hemings family special treatment: the three boys while young had very light household duties. At working age, they were each apprenticed to the master carpenter of the estate, the most skilled artisan, who was also their uncle. This would provide them with skills to make a good living as free adults.<ref name="Annette Gordon-Reed 1997 pp. 210-223"/>

According to Annette Gordon-Reed, Thomas Jefferson's treatment of Sally Hemings children is a good indication that he could have fathered the children. Harriet Hemings did not begin working as a weaver until she was fourteen years old.<ref>Gordon-Reed, ''An American Controversy'', p.&nbsp;218</ref>  Many of Jefferson's slaves would have started at ten. Another example is that unlike other slaves, Madison Hemings stated that until they were put to work, they would run errands with Sally. This was very uncommon.

Most importantly, Gordon-Reed notes that Jefferson freed all the Hemings children. Theirs was the only slave family to all go free from Monticello; they were the only slaves freed in their youth and as they came of age, and Harriet Hemings was the only female slave he ever freed.<ref name="monticello.org">[http://www.monticello.org/site/plantation-and-slavery/thomas-jefferson-and-sally-hemings-brief-account "Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account"], Monticello, accessed March 4, 2011</ref> He allowed Beverley (male) and Harriet to "escape" in 1822 at ages 23 and 21, although Jefferson was already struggling financially and would be $100,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100,000|1826}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in debt at his death.<ref name="Annette Gordon-Reed 1997 pp. 210-223"/> He gave his overseer money to give to Harriet for her journey. Jefferson avoided publicity this way, but the gentry at the time noted the Hemingses' absences; Monticello overseer Edmund Bacon noted in his memoir (published after Jefferson's death) that people were talking about Harriet's departure, saying that she was Jefferson's daughter.<ref name="monticello.org"/><ref>Gordon-Reed, ''American Controversy,'' p. 34</ref>

In his 1826 will, Jefferson freed the younger brothers Madison and Eston Hemings, who were approaching the age of 21. To enable them to stay in Virginia, Jefferson's will petitioned the legislature for permission for them to stay in the state with their families. (Such legislative approval was required by laws related to manumission and free blacks.) Jefferson also freed three older males from the extended [[Elizabeth Hemings]] family; they had each served him for decades. His will also requested that they be allowed to stay in the state.<ref>Gordon-Reed, ''An American Controversy'', pp.&nbsp;38–43</ref> Jefferson's daughter Martha Randolph gave Sally Hemings "her time" after Jefferson's death, an informal freedom, and the former slave lived with her two younger sons, Madison and Eston, in nearby [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] for nearly a decade before her death.<ref name="monticello.org" />

==1998 DNA study==
According to an initial report on the findings of a 1998 DNA study which tested the Y-chromosome of direct male-line descendants of Eston Hemings, and other related tests, there is a high probability that Thomas Jefferson was the biological father of Eston Hemings, with a nearly perfect match between the DNA of Jefferson's paternal uncle and the descendants of Eston Hemings.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Foster, Eugene A.|author2=Jobling, M.

In the Monticello Commission's report on the paternity question, Dr. David Page, one of the committee's scientific case reviewers, recommended that additional research needed to be done into "the local population structure around Monticello two hundred years ago, as respects the Y chromosome," before entirely ruling out the possibility of the paternity of any of the other 7 potential paternity candidates.<ref>[http://www.monticello.org/site/plantation-and-slavery/appendix-b-opinions-scientists-consulted Monticello Commission: Appendix B: Opinions of Scientists Consulted] 2000, Jan, downloaded 15-04-10</ref>

==Historical consensus==
With the Eston Hemings descendant found consistent with the Jefferson male line, and inconsistent with the Carr male line, formerly skeptical biographers, such as [[Joseph Ellis]] and Andrew Burstein, publicly said they had changed their opinions and concluded that Jefferson had fathered Hemings' children.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://hnn.us/articles/13102.html Richard Shenkman, "The Unknown Jefferson: An Interview with Andrew Burstein"], ''History News Network'', July 25, 2005, accessed March 14, 2011.</ref><ref name="OnlineLegacy">[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/white_house/july-dec98/jefferson_11-2.html "Thomas Jefferson's Legacy"], ''Online Newshour'', PBS, November 2, 1998, accessdate August 4, 2006</ref> As Burstein said in 2005,<blockquote>[T]he white Jefferson descendants who established the family denial in the mid-nineteenth century cast responsibility for paternity on two Jefferson nephews (children of Jefferson's sister) whose DNA was not a match. So, as far as can be reconstructed, there are no Jeffersons other than the president who had the degree of physical access to Sally Hemings that he did.<ref name="autogenerated2" /></blockquote>In 2000, the [[Thomas Jefferson Foundation]], which operates Monticello, issued a report of its own investigation, which concluded by accepting Jefferson's paternity.<ref name="Study" />  Dr. Daniel P. Jordan, president of the foundation, committed at the time to incorporate "the conclusions of the report into Monticello's training, interpretation, and publications." This included new articles and monographs on the Hemings descendants reflecting the new evidence, as well as books on the interracial communities of Monticello and Charlottesville. New exhibits at Monticello show Jefferson as the father of the Sally Hemings children.<ref name="Study">[http://www.monticello.org/site/plantation-and-slavery/vi-conclusions "Conclusions"], ''Report of the Research Committee on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings'', Monticello, January 2000, accessed March 9, 2011.

In its January 2000 issue, the ''[[William and Mary Quarterly]]'' published ''Forum: Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings Redux,'' a total of seven articles noting the changed consensus and the developing new views on Jefferson.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/i326101 ''Forum: Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings Redux''], accessed January 11, 2012</ref> One article had the results of an analysis by Fraser D. Neiman, who studied the statistical significance of the relationship between Jefferson's documented residencies at Monticello and Hemings' conceptions.<ref name="Neiman"/> He concluded that there was a 99 percent chance that Jefferson was the father of Hemings' children.<ref name="Neiman"/>

In May 2000, [[PBS]] ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' produced, ''Jefferson's Blood,'' a program about the issues related to the DNA test and historical controversy. It stated in its overview:

<blockquote>More than 20 years after CBS executives were pressured by Jefferson historians to drop plans for a mini-series on Jefferson and Hemings, the network airs ''Sally Hemings: An American Scandal.''

In the fall of 2001, the [[National Genealogical Society]] published a special issue of its quarterly devoted to the Jefferson–Hemings controversy. In several articles, its specialists concluded that, as the genealogist Helen M. Leary wrote, the "chain of evidence": historical, genealogical, and DNA, supported the conclusion  that Thomas Jefferson was the father of all of Hemings' children.<ref name="Leary">''National Genealogical Society Quarterly'', Vol. 89, No. 3, September 2001, pp. 207, 214–18</ref>

==Dissenting views==
In 1999, the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society (TJHS) commissioned its own report. Its founder and Director Emeritus Herbert Barger,<ref>[http://www.tjheritage.org/directors.html "Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society – Directors"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929113852/http://www.tjheritage.org/directors.html |date=September 29, 2011 }})</ref> a family historian, had assisted Eugene Foster by finding descendants of the Jefferson male line, Woodsons and Carrs for testing for the DNA study. Foster later said that Barger was "fantastic" and "of immense help to me".<ref name=EMarshall>Eliot Marshall, ''Which Jefferson Was the Father'', ''Science'' 8, January 1999</ref> The TJHS Scholars Commission included [[Lance Banning]], Robert F. Turner and Paul Rahe, among others. In 2001 the group published its report, in which the majority concluded there was insufficient evidence to determine that Jefferson was the father of Hemings' children. The report states that it is a matter about which reasonable people can disagree but the majority of the authors' conclusions, "range from serious skepticism about the charge to a conviction that it is almost certainly false". Their report suggested that his younger brother Randolph Jefferson, or one of his sons, was the father, and that Hemings may have had multiple partners. They emphasized that more than 20 Jefferson males lived in Virginia, eight within 20 miles of Monticello. Their report summary goes on to state "The most important results from the DNA testing may well have been the determination that Thomas Woodson, long thought by many to be the Tom 
referred to by James Callender in 1802 as having been conceived by Sally Hemings in Paris, and having a strong physical resemblance to the President could not have been the son of Thomas Jefferson. Subsequent DNA testing of descendants of a third Woodson son confirmed the earlier results. Most of us believe this goes far towards undermining any remaining credibility of the original Callender allegations."  Paul Rahe published a minority view, saying he thought Jefferson's paternity of Eston Hemings was more likely than not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tjheritage.org/documents/SCReport1.pdf |title=Jefferson-Hemings Scholars Commission, Report on the Jefferson-Hemings Matter'&#39 |publisher=Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society |date=April 2001 |access-date=June 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008063811/http://www.tjheritage.org/documents/SCReport1.pdf |archive-date=October 8, 2010 }}</ref>

But the Monticello Jefferson-Hemings Report, examining Randolph Jefferson as a candidate, found that he made only four recorded visits to Monticello (in September 1802, September 1805, May 1808, and sometime in 1814), and none coincided with possible dates of Sally Hemings' conceptions.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.monticello.org/site/plantation-and-slavery/appendix-j-possible-paternity-other-jeffersons-summary-research | title = Appendix J: The Possible Paternity of Other Jeffersons, A Summary of Research | access-date = 2013-10-29 | date = January 2000 | work = Report of the Research Committee on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings | publisher = Thomas Jefferson Foundation}}</ref> In August 1807, a probable conception time for Eston Hemings, Thomas Jefferson wrote to his brother about visiting, but there is no evidence that the younger man arrived.

John H. Works, Jr., a Jefferson-Wayles descendant and a past president of the [[Monticello Association]], a Jefferson lineage society, wrote that DNA tests indicated that any one of eight Jeffersons could have been the father of Eston. The team had concluded that Jefferson's paternity was the simplest explanation and consistent with historic evidence, but the DNA study could not identify Thomas Jefferson exclusively of other Jefferson males because no sample of his DNA was available.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/true/primer.html "Is It True? A Primer On Jefferson DNA"], ''Frontline: Jefferson's Blood'', February 2000, PBS</ref>

In the fall of 2001, articles in the ''National Genealogical Society Quarterly'' criticized the TJHS Scholars Commission Report for poor scholarship and failure to follow accepted historical practices of analysis, or to give sufficient weight to the body of evidence.<ref name="Leary"/> In the same year, historian Alexander Boulton wrote that Randolph Jefferson had never been seriously proposed as a candidate by historians before the 1998 DNA study. He noted "previous testimony had agreed" that Hemings had only one father for her children, and criticized the idea that she had multiple partners for her children.<ref name="wm">[http://oieahc.wm.edu/wmq/Oct01/boulton.pdf Alexander Boulton, "The Monticello Mystery-Case Continued": reviews of ''The Jefferson-Hemings Myth: An American Travesty''; ''A President in the Family: Thomas Jefferson, Sally Hemings and Thomas Woodson''; and ''Free Some Day: African American Families at Monticello''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720115728/http://oieahc.wm.edu/wmq/Oct01/boulton.pdf |date=July 20, 2011 }}; in ''William & Mary Quarterly'', Third Series, Vol. 58, No. 4, October 2001. Quote: "Past defenses of Jefferson having proven inadequate, the TJHS advocates have pieced together an alternative case that preserves the conclusions of earlier champions but introduces new "evidence" to support them. Randolph Jefferson, for example, had never seriously been considered as a possible partner of Sally Hemings until the late 20th century, when DNA evidence indicated that a Jefferson was unquestionably the father of Eston."</ref> Jeanette Daniels, Marietta Glauser, Diana Harvey and Carol Hubbell Ouellette conducted research and in 2003 concluded that Randolph Jefferson had been an infrequent visitor to Monticello.<ref name = "genealogy_edu">[http://www.genealogy.edu/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=3543 Jeanette K.

===Monticello Association===
In 1999, [[Lucian Truscott IV]], a Wayles-Jefferson descendant and member of the Monticello Association, the Jefferson lineage society, invited Hemings' descendants to that year's annual meeting.<ref name="Lucian">[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/children-monticello Lucian K. Truscott IV, "Children Of Monticello"], ''American Heritage'', February/March 2001| Volume 52, Issue 1, accessed April 19, 2012</ref> The Association decided to commission its own report to determine whether it would admit Hemings' descendants to the lineage society (termed the MAC report or Membership Advisory Committee Report). The report was to determine whether the Hemings descendants could satisfy the society's requirements for documentation of lineage. The 2002 report to the Monticello Association concluded the evidence was insufficient to establish Jefferson's paternity. The majority of members voted against admitting the Hemings descendants as members of the group.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jefferson Heirs Plan Cemetery for Slave's Kin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/21/us/jefferson-heirs-plan-cemetery-for-slave-s-kin.html|access-date=September 25, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=April 21, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Kate|title=Did Thomas Jefferson Father a Child With Sally Hemings?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2002/05/did_thomas_jefferson_father_a_child_with_sally_hemings.html|access-date=September 25, 2014|publisher=Slte.com|date=May 8, 2002}}</ref>

Truscott noted in ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' magazine that the Association had not had such strict documentation standards before the DNA study results were published in 1998.  He checked the previous membership rules and found the following:

<blockquote>ARTICLE III — Membership&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Any lineal descendant of Thomas Jefferson who applies for membership, and annually pays dues as stated in the By-Laws of this Association, shall be a Regular Member of the Association.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." Only those 33 of the 93 words in that section of the article address membership criteria; the rest of the paragraph was largely concerned with the payment of dues.<ref name="Lucian"/></blockquote>

Shay Banks-Young, a descendant of Madison Hemings, had grown up with a family tradition of descent from Jefferson. David Works had originally resisted the new DNA evidence, but after he read the commissioned reports, he became convinced of Jefferson's paternity.<ref name=Martin/> Julia Jefferson Westerinen is descended from Eston Hemings.<ref name="Westerinen">[http://www.monticello.org/getting-word/people/julia-jefferson-westerinen?back=%2Fgetting-word%2Fpeople%3Fpage%3D1%26theme%3D1907 "Julia Jefferson Westerinen"], ''Getting Word'', Monticello, accessed May 8, 2012</ref> After Hemings moved his family to [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in 1852, they took the surname Jefferson and entered the white community. His descendants married and identified as white from then on.

In the 1940s, Julia's father and his brothers changed the family oral tradition and told their children they were descended from an uncle of Jefferson, as they were trying to protect them from potential racial discrimination related to their descent from Sally Hemings. In the 1970s, a cousin read [[Fawn McKay Brodie]]'s biography of Jefferson and recognized Eston Hemings' name from family stories. She contacted Brodie and learned the truth about their descent.<ref name="Westerinen"/> Their family was later contacted to recruit a male descendant for the 1998 DNA testing. Julia's brother, John Weeks Jefferson, was the Eston Hemings' descendant whose DNA matched that of the Jefferson male line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/03/nyregion/03JEFF.html|title=A Founding Father and his Family Ties|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Madison J.|last=Gray|date=March 1, 2003|access-date=April 27, 2008}}</ref>

==Changing scholarship==
In his last book before the DNA test results were published, Andrew Burstein wrote that Jefferson could not have been the father of Hemings' children.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Since then he published ''Jefferson's Secrets: Death and Desire at Monticello'' (2005), in which he concluded that Jefferson did have a long-term sexual relationship with Sally Hemings.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5627-2005Mar3.html Susan Dunn, "Doubting Thomas": Review], ''The Washington Post'', March 6, 2005, accessed April 19, 2012</ref>

Burstein said in an interview about his 2005 book,

<blockquote>On Jefferson's isolated mountaintop, sex took place as part of a hierarchy that everyone involved understood. Jefferson, and those of his class, did not share our current understanding of sexual morality. Sally Hemings was his servant, and had little power. She was dependent economically, though this does not mean her feelings were irrelevant. But it does mean that he had extraordinary power, and she very little, and so, as his [[concubine]], she had probably replicated her mother's relationship with Jefferson's father-in-law; for she was, in fact, Jefferson's late wife's half-sister, and I have described the Hemings family as a parallel, subordinate family to the all-white Jeffersons.<ref name=autogenerated2 /></blockquote>

In 2005 [[Christopher Hitchens]] published a new biography of Jefferson, whom he had always admired and praised. While continuing that praise, he assessed the president and his views. In an interview on [[NPR]] about the book, Hitchens discussed Jefferson's pessimistic views of the possibility of the co-existence of whites and blacks in the United States. He said,

<blockquote>Then there's the odd, of course, fact that he had a very long love affair with a woman who he owned, who he inherited from his father-in-law, who was his wife's half-sister, and produced several children by her, whose descendants have mainly been brought up on the white side of the color line. So in a strange way, his own patrimony disproves his own belief that there couldn't be coexistence between black and white Americans.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4675418 Christopher Hitchens, "Living in Thomas Jefferson's Fictions"] NPR, 1 June 2005, accessed 7 May 2012</ref></blockquote>

In her [[Pulitzer Prize for History|Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family]]'' (2008), [[Annette Gordon-Reed]] recounts the history and biography of four generations of the enslaved Hemings family, focusing on their African and Virginian origins and interrelationships with the Jefferson-Wayles families, until the death in 1826 of Thomas Jefferson.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon-Reed|first=Annette|title=The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family|year=2008|publisher=[[W.

Gordon-Reed is frequently asked about the emotional relationship between Jefferson and Hemings when giving talks. She writes, "In all the venues I have visited, from Houston to Stockholm, one question always arises: Did they love each other?" The question brings up many thorny issues in the context of a master-slave relationship. "Rape and the threat of it blighted the lives of countless enslaved women," she notes. "At the same time, some black women and white men did form bonds quite different in character than from those resulting from sexual coercion."<ref name="Gordon-Reed, American Heritage">{{cite journal |last1=Gordon-Reed |first1=Annette |title=Did Sally Hemings And Thomas Jefferson Love Each Other? |journal=American Heritage Magazine |volume= 58, No 5 |issue=Fall 2008 |url=https://www.americanheritage.com/did-sally-hemings-and-thomas-jefferson-love-each-other}}</ref>

William G. Hyland, Jr., a trial lawyer, published ''In Defense of Thomas Jefferson: The Sally Hemings Sex Scandal'' (2009), in which he argues that Jefferson's younger brother Randolph, who had a reputation for socializing with the Monticello slaves (in contrast to Thomas, who, Hyland argues, did not) is the most likely of several possible candidates for the father of Sally Hemings' children. He repeats the poor reputation of James Callendar, who had first reported allegations of Jefferson's relationship with a slave.<ref>William G.

In 2012, the [[Thomas Jefferson Foundation]] (which operated Monticello as a [[house museum]] and archive) and the [[Smithsonian Institution]] collaborated on a major exhibit held at the [[National Museum of American History]], ''Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello: The Paradox of Liberty'' (January–October 2012). Described as a "groundbreaking exhibit", it was the first on the national Mall to address Jefferson as slaveholder and the family lives of slaves at Monticello.<ref name="trescott">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/exhibits/slavery-at-jeffersons-monticello-paradox-of-liberty,1222311/critic-review.html  Jacqueline Trescott, "Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello: The Paradox of Liberty"], ''The Washington Post'', January 27, 2012, accessed April 21, 2012</ref> Members and descendants of six families, including the Hemings, were documented and the strength of the enslaved families was shown.  The exhibit also noted that "evidence strongly support[s] the conclusion that Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings' children."<ref name=AmHist>[http://americanhistory.si.edu/exhibitions/exhibition.cfm?key=38&exkey=1669 ''Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello: The Paradox of Liberty''], January 27, 2012 – October 14, 2012, Smithsonian Institution, accessed March 23, 2012. Quote: "The [DNA] test results show a genetic link between the Jefferson and Hemings descendants: A man with the Jefferson Y chromosome fathered Eston Hemings (born 1808). While there were other adult males with the Jefferson Y chromosome living in Virginia at that time, most historians now believe that the documentary and genetic evidence, considered together, strongly support the conclusion that Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings's children."</ref> More than one million visitors saw the exhibit. Following the Washington run, the exhibit toured the US, being held at museums in [[Atlanta]], [[St. Louis]] and other venues. Both the [[United States National Park Service]] and the University of Virginia's [[Miller Center of Public Affairs]] note in their online biographies that Jefferson's paternity of Hemings' children has been widely accepted.<ref name=NationalExpansion/><ref name=MillerCenter/>

==Representation in media==

In 1979, [[Barbara Chase-Riboud]] published a novel on Hemings that gave her a voice, portraying her as both an independent woman and Jefferson's concubine.<ref>Gallagher, "Episodes", ''The Jefferson-Hemings Controversy''</ref> Jefferson historians succeeded in suppressing a planned CBS [[television film]] based on this novel.<ref name="CBS" /> In 1995, the film ''[[Jefferson in Paris]]'' was released, which portrayed a Jefferson-Hemings liaison. CBS aired the television film ''Sally Hemings: An American Scandal'' (1999), also portraying this relationship; it was not challenged by any major historian.<ref name="CBS"/>

While historians have discussed the issue, numerous artists, writers and poets have grappled with the meaning of Jefferson's paternity in American history, as in these selections from a list of resources listed in a Lehigh University student project of "History on Trial": ''The Jefferson-Hemings Controversy'':<ref>[http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/trial/jefferson/resources/ Resources: ''The Jefferson-Hemings Controversy''], History on Trial, Lehigh University, 2009–2012</ref>
