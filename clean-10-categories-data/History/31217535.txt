'''Memory''' is the faculty of the [[brain]] by which [[data]] or [[information]] is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed. It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lauralee Sherwood|title=Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_i5BBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT189|date=1 January 2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-305-44551-2|pages=157–162}}</ref> If [[Foresight (psychology)|past event]]s could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or [[personal identity]] to develop.<ref name="Eysenck 2012">{{cite book | last=Eysenck | first=Michael | title=Attention and Arousal : Cognition and Performance | publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg | location=Berlin, Heidelberg | year=2012 | isbn=978-3-642-68390-9 | oclc=858929786 }}</ref> Memory loss is usually described as [[Forgetting|forgetfulness]] or [[amnesia]].<ref name="Staniloiu Markowitsch 2012 p.">{{cite journal|last1=Staniloiu|first1=Angelica|last2=Markowitsch|first2=Hans J.|date=2012-11-01|title=Towards Solving the Riddle of Forgetting in Functional Amnesia: Recent Advances and Current Opinions|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|publisher=Frontiers Media SA|volume=3|pages=403|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00403|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3485580|pmid=23125838}}</ref><ref name="Smith 2014 pp. 959–972">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Christine N.|date=2014-07-28|title=Retrograde memory for public events in mild cognitive impairment and its relationship to anterograde memory and neuroanatomy.|journal=Neuropsychology|publisher=American Psychological Association (APA)|volume=28|issue=6|pages=959–972|doi=10.1037/neu0000117|issn=1931-1559|pmc=4227913|pmid=25068664}}</ref><ref name="Ortega-de San Luis Ryan p=dmm035055">{{cite journal|last1=Ortega-de San Luis|first1=Clara|last2=Ryan|first2=Tomás J.|date=2018-05-01|title=United states of amnesia: rescuing memory loss from diverse conditions|journal=Disease Models & Mechanisms|publisher=The Company of Biologists|volume=11|issue=5|page=dmm035055|doi=10.1242/dmm.035055|issn=1754-8403|pmc=5992608|pmid=29784659}}</ref><ref name="Staniloiu Markowitsch pp. 101–129">{{cite journal|last1=Staniloiu|first1=Angelica|last2=Markowitsch|first2=Hans J.|date=2012-04-10|title=The Remains of the Day in Dissociative Amnesia|journal=Brain Sciences|publisher=MDPI AG|volume=2|issue=2|pages=101–129|doi=10.3390/brainsci2020101|issn=2076-3425|pmc=4061789|pmid=24962768}}</ref><ref name="Spiegel Smith Wade Cherukuru 2017 pp. 2691–2703">{{cite journal|last1=Spiegel|first1=David R|last2=Smith|first2=Justin|last3=Wade|first3=Ryan R|last4=Cherukuru|first4=Nithya|last5=Ursani|first5=Aneel|last6=Dobruskina|first6=Yuliya|last7=Crist|first7=Taylor|last8=Busch|first8=Robert F|last9=Dhanani|first9=Rahim M|date=2017-10-24|title=Transient global amnesia: current perspectives|journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment|publisher=Dove Medical Press Ltd.|volume=13|pages=2691–2703|doi=10.2147/ndt.s130710|issn=1178-2021|pmc=5661450|pmid=29123402|last10=Dreyer|first10=Nicholas}}</ref><ref name="Bauer Larkina pp. 907–924">{{cite journal|last1=Bauer|first1=Patricia J.|last2=Larkina|first2=Marina|date=2013-11-18|title=The onset of childhood amnesia in childhood: A prospective investigation of the course and determinants of forgetting of early-life events|journal=Memory (Hove, England)|publisher=Informa UK Limited|volume=22|issue=8|pages=907–924|doi=10.1080/09658211.2013.854806|issn=0965-8211|pmc=4025992|pmid=24236647}}</ref>

Memory is often understood as an [[information processing|informational processing]] system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a [[sensory processor]], [[short-term memory|short-term]] (or [[working memory|working]]) memory, and [[long-term memory]].<ref name="Baddeley 2007" /> This can be related to the [[neuron]].
The sensory processor allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli and attended to various levels of focus and intent. Working memory serves as an encoding and retrieval processor. Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions by the working memory processor. The working memory also retrieves information from previously stored material.  Finally, the function of long-term memory is to store data through various categorical models or systems.<ref name="Baddeley 2007">{{cite book | last=Baddeley | first=Alan | title=Working Memory, Thought, and Action | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2007-03-15 | isbn=978-0-19-852801-2 | doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198528012.001.0001 | s2cid=142763675 | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fbb0aa52c0be173553e0cecea4c77a5457079049 }}</ref>

Memory is not a perfect processor, and is affected by many factors. The ways by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved can all be corrupted. The amount of attention given new stimuli can diminish the amount of information that becomes encoded for storage.<ref name="Eysenck 2012" /> Also, the storage process can become corrupted by physical damage to areas of the brain that are associated with memory storage, such as the hippocampus.<ref name="Squire pp. 12711–12716">{{cite journal|last=Squire|first=L.

==Sensory memory==
{{Main|Sensory memory}}
Sensory memory holds information, derived from the senses, less than one second after an item is perceived. The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem to "see" more than they can actually report. The first precise experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by [[George Sperling]] (1963)<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/001872086300500103|pmid = 13990068|title = A Model for Visual Memory Tasks|journal = Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society|volume = 5|pages = 19–31|year = 1963|last1 = Sperling|first1 = George|s2cid = 5347138}}</ref>  using the "partial report paradigm." Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments, Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly (within a few hundred milliseconds). Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items (12 in the "whole report" procedure) before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal.

Three types of sensory memories exist. [[Iconic memory]] is a fast decaying store of visual information, a type of sensory memory that briefly stores an image that has been perceived for a small duration. [[Echoic memory]] is a fast decaying store of auditory information, also a sensory memory that briefly stores sounds that have been perceived for short durations.<ref name="Carlson 2010">{{cite book |author=Carlson, Neil R. |title=Psychology: the science of behavior |publisher=Allyn & Bacon |location=Boston, Mass |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-205-68557-8 |oclc=268547522}}</ref> [[Haptic memory]] is a type of sensory memory that represents a database for touch stimuli.

==Short-term memory==
{{Main|Short-term memory}}
Short-term memory is also known as '''working memory'''. Short-term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal. Its capacity, however, is very limited. In 1956, [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]] (1920-2012), when working at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]], conducted experiments showing that the store of short-term memory was 7±2 items. (Hence, the title of his famous paper, [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|"The Magical Number 7±2."]]) Modern estimates of the capacity of short-term memory are lower, typically of the order of 4–5 items;<ref name="Cowan 2019">{{cite journal |author=Cowan, N |title=The magical number 4 in short-term memory: a reconsideration of mental storage capacity |journal=Behav Brain Sci |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=87–114; discussion 114–85 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11515286 |url=http://langint.pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ai/intra_data/NobuyukiKawai/Kawai-Matsuzawa-Magical_number_5_in_a_chimpanzee.pdf |doi=10.1017/S0140525X01003922 |access-date=2013-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413104340/http://langint.pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ai/intra_data/NobuyukiKawai/Kawai-Matsuzawa-Magical_number_5_in_a_chimpanzee.pdf |archive-date=2018-04-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> however, memory capacity can be increased through a process called [[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]].<ref name="Miller 1956">{{cite journal |author=Miller, G.A. |title=The magical number seven plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=81–97 |date=March 1956 |pmid=13310704 |doi=10.1037/h0043158|citeseerx=10.1.1.308.8071 }}</ref> For example, in recalling a ten-digit [[telephone number]], a person could chunk the digits into three groups: first, the area code (such as 123), then a three-digit chunk (456), and, last, a four-digit chunk (7890). This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers. This is reflected in some countries'  tendencies to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers.

Short-term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information, and to a lesser extent on a visual code. Conrad (1964)<ref name="Conrad (1964)">{{Cite journal | author = Conrad, R. | year = 1964 | title = Acoustic Confusions in Immediate Memory | url = http://step.psy.cmu.edu/articles/Conrad64.doc | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 55 | pages = 75–84 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8295.1964.tb00899.x | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628193757/http://step.psy.cmu.edu/articles/Conrad64.doc | archive-date = 2007-06-28 }}</ref> found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of letters that were acoustically similar, e.g., E, P, D. Confusion with recalling acoustically similar letters rather than visually similar letters implies that the letters were encoded acoustically. Conrad's (1964) study, however, deals with the encoding of written text; thus, while memory of written language may rely on acoustic components, generalizations to all forms of memory cannot be made.

==Long-term memory==
{{Main|Long-term memory}}
[[File:Memory-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|150px|[[Olin Levi Warner]], ''Memory'' (1896). Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
The storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that information is not retained indefinitely. By contrast, long-term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration (sometimes a whole life span). Its capacity is immeasurable. For example, given a random seven-digit number, one may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting, suggesting it was stored in short-term memory. On the other hand, one can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition; this information is said to be stored in long-term memory.

While short-term memory encodes information acoustically, long-term memory encodes it semantically: Baddeley (1966)<ref name="Baddeley 1966">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/14640746608400047 | author = Baddeley, A.D. | year = 1966 | title = The influence of acoustic and semantic similarity on long-term memory for word sequences | journal = Q.

Short-term memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication, dependent on regions of the [[frontal lobe]] (especially dorsolateral [[prefrontal cortex]]) and the [[parietal lobe]]. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain. The [[hippocampus]] is essential (for learning new information) to the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory, although it does not seem to store information itself. It was thought that without the hippocampus new memories were unable to be stored into long-term memory and that there would be a very short [[attention span]], as first gleaned from patient [[Henry Molaison]]<ref>{{cite journal|year=1957|title=Loss of Recent Memory After Bilateral Hippocampal Lesions|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry|volume=20|issue=1|pages=11–21|doi=10.1136/jnnp.20.1.11|pmc=497229|pmid=13406589|author1=Scoville W.B.|author2=Milner B.}}</ref> after what was thought to be the full removal of both his hippocampi. More recent examination of his brain, post-mortem, shows that the hippocampus was more intact than first thought, throwing theories drawn from the initial data into question. The hippocampus may be involved in changing neural connections for a period of three months or more after the initial learning.

===Multi-store model===
{{See also|Memory consolidation}}
[[File:multistore model.png|right]]
The multi-store model (also known as [[Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model]]) was first described in 1968 by [[Richard C. Atkinson|Atkinson]] and [[Richard Shiffrin|Shiffrin]].

The multi-store model has been criticised for being too simplistic. For instance, long-term memory is believed to be actually made up of multiple subcomponents, such as episodic and [[procedural memory]]. It also proposes that rehearsal is the only mechanism by which information eventually reaches long-term storage, but evidence shows us capable of remembering things without rehearsal.

The model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently. For example, short-term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information. In a study by Zlonoga and Gerber (1986), patient 'KF' demonstrated certain deviations from the Atkinson–Shiffrin model. Patient KF was [[brain damage]]d, displaying difficulties regarding short-term memory. Recognition of sounds such as spoken numbers, letters, words and easily identifiable noises (such as doorbells and cats meowing) were all impacted. Visual short-term memory was unaffected, suggesting a dichotomy between visual and audial memory.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=3952419 | volume=75 | issue=7 | title=A case from practice (49).

===Working memory===
{{Main|Working memory}}
[[File:Working memory model.svg|frame|right|The working memory model]]
In 1974 Baddeley and Hitch proposed a "working memory model" that replaced the general concept of short-term memory with an active maintenance of information in the short-term storage. In this model, working memory consists of three basic stores: the central executive, the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad.

The central executive essentially acts as an attention sensory store. It channels information to the three component processes: the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer.

The phonological loop stores auditory information by silently rehearsing sounds or words in a continuous loop: the articulatory process (for example the repetition of a telephone number over and over again). A short list of data is easier to remember.

The [[visuospatial sketchpad]] stores visual and spatial information. It is engaged when performing spatial tasks (such as judging distances) or visual ones (such as counting the windows on a house or imagining images).

The episodic buffer is dedicated to linking information across domains to form integrated units of visual, spatial, and verbal information and chronological ordering (e.g., the memory of a story or a movie scene). The episodic buffer is also assumed to have links to long-term memory and semantical meaning.

The working memory model explains many practical observations, such as why it is easier to do two different tasks (one verbal and one visual) than two similar tasks (e.g., two visual), and the aforementioned word-length effect.  Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought. It is the section of memory where we carry out thought processes and use them to learn and reason about topics.<ref name="Baddeley 2000"/>

==Types==
Researchers distinguish between '''recognition''' and '''recall''' memory.  Recognition memory tasks require individuals to indicate whether they have encountered a stimulus (such as a picture or a word) before.  Recall memory tasks require participants to retrieve previously learned information.  For example, individuals might be asked  to produce a series of actions they have seen before or to say a list of words they have heard before.

==== Declarative ====
{{Main|Declarative memory}}
[[Declarative memory]] requires [[conscious]] [[recollection|recall]], in that some conscious process must call back the information. It is sometimes called ''[[explicit memory]]'', since it consists of information that is explicitly stored and retrieved.

Declarative memory can be further sub-divided into [[semantic memory]], concerning principles and facts taken independent of context; and [[episodic memory]], concerning information specific to a particular context, such as a time and place. Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract [[knowledge]] about the world, such as "Paris is the capital of France". Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time. Episodic memories often reflect the "firsts" in life such as a first kiss, first day of school or first time winning a championship. These are key events in one's life that can be remembered clearly. Research suggests that declarative memory is supported by several functions of the medial temporal lobe system which includes the hippocampus.<ref name=":3" /> [[Autobiographical memory]] – memory for particular events within one's own life – is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. [[Visual memory]] is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a [[mental image]]. Visual memory can result in [[priming (psychology)|priming]] and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.<ref name=":3">{{cite journal | author = Tulving E., Markowitsch H. J. | year = 1998 | title = Episodic and declarative memory: role of the hippocampus | journal = Hippocampus | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 198–204 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1098-1063(1998)8:3<198::aid-hipo2>3.0.co;2-g | pmid = 9662134 }}</ref>

==== Procedural ====
In contrast, [[procedural memory]] (or ''[[implicit memory]]'') is not based on the conscious recall of information, but on [[implicit learning]]. It can best be summarized as remembering how to do something. Procedural memory is primarily used in learning [[motor skill]]s and can be considered a subset of implicit memory. It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition – no new explicit memories have been formed, but one is [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]] accessing aspects of those previous experiences. Procedural memory involved in [[motor learning]] depends on the [[cerebellum]] and [[basal ganglia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Doyon|first1=Julien|last2=Bellec|first2=Pierre|last3=Amsel|first3=Rhonda|last4=Penhune|first4=Virginia|last5=Monchi|first5=Oury|last6=Carrier|first6=Julie|last7=Lehéricy|first7=Stéphane|last8=Benali|first8=Habib|date=April 2009|title=Contributions of the basal ganglia and functionally related brain structures to motor learning|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|volume=199|issue=1|pages=61–75|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2008.11.012|pmid=19061920|s2cid=7282686|issn=0166-4328}}</ref>

A characteristic of procedural memory is that the things remembered are automatically translated into actions, and thus sometimes difficult to describe. Some examples of procedural memory include the ability to ride a bike or tie shoelaces.<ref name="Schacter 2011">{{cite book |author1=Schacter, Daniel L |author2=Gilbert, Daniel T |author3=Wegner, Daniel M |title= Implicit Memory and Explicit Memory |work=Psychology |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=238 |isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2 |oclc=755079969 }}</ref>

===By temporal direction===
Another major way to distinguish different memory functions is whether the content to be remembered is in the past, [[retrospective memory]], or in the future, [[prospective memory]]. Thus, retrospective memory as a category includes semantic, episodic  and autobiographical memory. In contrast, prospective memory is memory for future intentions, or ''remembering to remember'' (Winograd, 1988). Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering. Time-based prospective memories are triggered by a time-cue, such as going to the doctor (action) at 4pm (cue). Event-based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues, such as remembering to post a letter (action) after seeing a mailbox (cue). Cues do not need to be related to the action (as the mailbox/letter example), and lists, sticky-notes, knotted handkerchiefs, or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory.

==Study techniques==
===To assess infants===

Infants do not have the language ability to report on their memories and so verbal reports cannot be used to assess very young children's memory.  Throughout the years, however, researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both infants' recognition memory and their recall memory.  [[Habituation]] and [[operant conditioning]] techniques have been used to assess infants' recognition memory and the deferred and elicited imitation techniques have been used to assess infants' recall memory.

Techniques used to assess infants' recognition memory include the following:
* '''Visual paired comparison procedure (relies on habituation)''': infants are first presented with pairs of visual stimuli, such as two black-and-white photos of human faces, for a fixed amount of time; then, after being familiarized with the two photos, they are presented with the "familiar" photo and a new photo.  The time spent looking at each photo is recorded.  Looking longer at the new photo indicates that they remember the "familiar" one.  Studies using this procedure have found that 5- to 6-month-olds can retain information for as long as fourteen days.<ref name="Fagan 1974">{{cite journal |author=Fagan, J.F. |title=Infant recognition memory: the effects of length of familiarization and type of discrimination task |journal=Child Dev |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=351–356 |date=June 1974 |pmid=4837713 |jstor=1127955 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1974.tb00603.x }}</ref>
* '''Operant conditioning technique''': infants are placed in a crib and a ribbon that is connected to a mobile overhead is tied to one of their feet.  Infants notice that when they kick their foot the mobile moves – the rate of kicking increases dramatically within minutes.  Studies using this technique have revealed that infants' memory substantially improves over the first 18-months.  Whereas 2- to 3-month-olds can retain an operant response (such as activating the mobile by kicking their foot) for a week, 6-month-olds can retain it for two weeks, and 18-month-olds can retain a similar operant response for as long as 13 weeks.<ref name="Rovee-Collier 1999">{{cite journal|last1=Rovee-Collier|first1=Carolyn|title=The Development of Infant Memory|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=8| issue=3|year=1999| pages=80–85| issn=0963-7214|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00019 |s2cid=12167896|url=http://bernard.pitzer.edu/~dmoore/psych199s03articles/R-Collier_memory.pdf}}</ref><ref name="Rovee-Collier 1993">{{cite book |author=Rovee-Collier, C.K., Bhatt, R.S. | title=Evidence of long-term retention in infancy |work=Annals of Child Development |editor= Ross Vasta |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Pub |location=London |volume=9 |year=1993 |pages=1–45 |isbn=978-1-85302-219-7 |oclc=827689578}}</ref><ref name="Hartshorn 1998">{{cite journal |author1=Hartshorn, K. |author2=Rovee-Collier, C. |author3=Gerhardstein, P. |title=The ontogeny of long-term memory over the first year-and-a-half of life |journal=Dev Psychobiol |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=69–89 |date=March 1998 |pmid=9526683 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2302(199803)32:2<69::AID-DEV1>3.0.CO;2-Q |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

Techniques used to assess infants' recall memory include the following:
* '''Deferred imitation technique''': an experimenter shows infants a unique sequence of actions (such as using a stick to push a button on a box) and then, after a delay, asks the infants to imitate the actions.  Studies using deferred imitation have shown that 14-month-olds' memories for the sequence of actions can last for as long as four months.<ref name="Meltzoff 1995">{{cite journal |author=Meltzoff, A.N. |title=What infant memory tells us about infantile amnesia: long-term recall and deferred imitation |journal=J Exp Child Psychol |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=497–515 |date=June 1995 |pmid=7622990 |pmc=3629912 |doi=10.1006/jecp.1995.1023 }}</ref>
* '''Elicited imitation technique''': is very similar to the deferred imitation technique; the difference is that infants are allowed to imitate the actions before the delay.

===To assess children and older adults===
Researchers use a variety of tasks to assess older children and adults' memory. Some examples are:
* '''Paired associate learning''' – when one learns to associate one specific word with another. For example, when given a word such as  "safe" one must learn to say another specific word, such as "green". This is stimulus and response.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 1">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/438701/paired-associate-learning |title=Paired-associate learning |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica }}</ref><ref name="Kesner 2013">{{cite journal |author=Kesner RP |title=A process analysis of the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus |journal=Front Cell Neurosci |volume=7 |pages=78 |year=2013 |pmid=23750126 |pmc=3664330 |doi=10.3389/fncel.2013.00078 }}</ref>
* '''Free recall''' – during this task a subject would be asked to study a list of words and then later they will be asked to recall or write down as many words that they can remember, similar to free response questions.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 2">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/493353/recall |title=Recall (memory) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica }}</ref> Earlier items are affected by retroactive interference (RI), which means the longer the list, the greater the interference, and the less likelihood that they are recalled. On the other hand, items that have been presented lastly suffer little RI, but suffer a great deal from proactive interference (PI), which means the longer the delay in recall, the more likely that the items will be lost.<ref name="Baddeley 1976">Baddeley, Alan D., "The Psychology of Memory", pp. 131–132, Basic Books, Inc., Publishers, New York, 1976, {{ISBN|0465067360}}</ref>
* '''Cued recall''' – one is given a significant hints to help retrieve information that has been previously encoded into the person's memory; typically this can involve a word relating to the information being asked to remember.<ref>Goldstein, E. B. (2014). ''Cognitive psychology: Connecting mind, research and everyday experience''. Nelson Education.</ref> This is similar to fill in the blank assessments used in classrooms.
* '''Recognition''' – subjects are asked to remember a list of words or pictures, after which point they are asked to identify the previously presented words or pictures from among a list of alternatives that were not presented in the original list.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica 3">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/493614/recognition |title=Recognition (memory) |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica }}</ref> This is similar to multiple choice assessments.
* '''Detection paradigm''' – individuals are shown a number of objects and color samples during a certain period of time. They are then tested on their visual ability to remember as much as they can by looking at testers and pointing out whether the testers are similar to the sample, or if any change is present.
* '''Savings method''' – compares the speed of originally learning to the speed of relearning it. The amount of time saved measures memory.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Introduction to Psychology|last = Kalat|first = James W.|publisher = Wadsworth Cengage Learning|isbn = 978-1-133-95660-0|location = Canada|year= 2013}}</ref>
* '''Implicit-memory tasks''' – information is drawn from memory without conscious realization.

==Failures==
[[Image:Garten des Vergessens.jpg|thumb|200px|The garden of oblivion, illustration by [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]].]]
* '''Transience''' – memories degrade with the passing of time. This occurs in the storage stage of memory, after the information has been stored and before it is retrieved. This can happen in sensory, short-term, and long-term storage. It follows a general pattern where the information is rapidly forgotten during the first couple of days or years, followed by small losses in later days or years.
* '''Absent-mindedness''' – Memory failure due to the lack of [[attention]]. Attention plays a key role in storing information into long-term memory; without proper attention, the information might not be stored, making it impossible to be retrieved later.

== Physiology ==
Brain areas involved in the [[neuroanatomy of memory]] such as the [[hippocampus]], the [[amygdala]], the [[striatum]], or the [[mammillary bodies]] are thought to be involved in specific types of memory. For example, the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and [[declarative learning]], while the amygdala is thought to be involved in [[Emotion and memory|emotional memory]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=LaBar K.S. |author2=Cabeza R. |title=Cognitive neuroscience of emotional memory |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=7 |pages=54–64 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/nrn1825 |pmid=16371950 |issue=1|s2cid=1829420 }}</ref>

Damage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information. However, rather than implicating a specific area, it could be that damage to adjacent areas, or to a pathway ''traveling'' through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit. Further, it is not sufficient to describe memory, and its counterpart, [[learning]], as solely dependent on specific brain regions. Learning and memory are usually attributed to changes in neuronal [[synapse]]s, thought to be mediated by [[long-term potentiation]] and [[long-term depression]].

In general, the more emotionally charged an event or experience is, the better it is remembered; this phenomenon is known as the '''memory enhancement effect'''.  Patients with amygdala damage, however, do not show a memory enhancement effect.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Adolphs R. |author2=Cahill L. |author3=Schul R. |author4=Babinsky R. |title=Impaired declarative memory for emotional material following bilateral amygdala damage in humans |journal=Learning & Memory |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=291–300 |year=1997 |doi=10.1101/lm.4.3.291|pmid=10456070 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Cahill L.|author2=Babinsky R.|author3=Markowitsch H.J.|author4=McGaugh J.L.|author-link3=Hans Markowitsch| title=The amygdala and emotional memory |journal=Nature |volume=377 |pages=295–296 |year=1995 |doi=10.1038/377295a0 |pmid=7566084|issue=6547|bibcode=1995Natur.377..295C|s2cid=5454440}}</ref>

Hebb distinguished between short-term and long-term memory. He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later research showed this to be false. Research has shown that direct injections of [[cortisol]] or [[epinephrine]] help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress (with prolonged cortisol) may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionally charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. Hippocampal damage may also cause [[memory loss]] and problems with memory storage.<ref>{{cite book| last =Kalat| first =J.W.| title =Biological psychology (7th ed.)| publisher = Wadsworth Publishing| year =2001   | location =Belmont, CA }}</ref> This memory loss includes retrograde amnesia which is the loss of memory for events that occurred shortly before the time of brain damage.<ref name=":0" />

==Cognitive neuroscience==
Cognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention, reactivation, and reconstruction of the experience-independent internal representation. The term of internal [[Mental representation|representation]] implies that such a definition of memory contains two components: the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level, and the underpinning physical neural changes (Dudai 2007). The latter component is also called [[engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] or memory traces (Semon 1904). Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory, broadly conceiving all persisting after-effects of experiences as memory; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought (Moscovitch 2007).

One question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain. Scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity, but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits; it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory, particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events (Byrne 2007). [[Convergence-divergence zone]]s might be the neural networks where memories are stored and retrieved. Considering that there are several kinds of memory, depending on types of represented knowledge, underlying mechanisms, processes functions and modes of acquisition, it is likely that different brain areas support different memory systems and that they are in mutual relationships in neuronal networks: "components of memory representation are distributed widely across different parts of the brain as mediated by multiple neocortical circuits".<ref name="crossingdialogues.com">{{cite journal | author = Ofengenden Tzofit | year = 2014 | title = Memory formation and belief | url = http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-03.pdf | journal = Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 34–44 }}</ref>
* [[Encoding (memory)|Encoding]]. Encoding of [[working memory]] involves the spiking of individual neurons induced by sensory input, which persists even after the sensory input disappears (Jensen and Lisman 2005; Fransen et al. 2002). Encoding of [[episodic memory]] involves persistent changes in molecular structures that alter [[synaptic transmission]] between neurons. Examples of such structural changes include [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) or [[spike-timing-dependent plasticity]] (STDP).  The persistent spiking in working memory can enhance the synaptic and cellular changes in the encoding of episodic memory (Jensen and Lisman 2005).
* Working memory. Recent functional imaging studies detected working memory signals in both [[medial temporal lobe]] (MTL), a brain area strongly associated with [[long-term memory]], and [[prefrontal cortex]] (Ranganath et al. 2005), suggesting a strong relationship between working memory and long-term memory. However, the substantially more working memory signals seen in the prefrontal lobe suggest that this area play a more important role in working memory than MTL (Suzuki 2007).
* [[Memory consolidation|Consolidation]] and [[reconsolidation]]. [[Short-term memory]] (STM) is temporary and subject to disruption, while long-term memory (LTM), once consolidated, is persistent and stable. Consolidation of STM into LTM at the molecular level presumably involves two processes: synaptic consolidation and system consolidation. The former involves a protein synthesis process in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), whereas the latter transforms the MTL-dependent memory into an MTL-independent memory over months to years (Ledoux 2007). In recent years, such traditional consolidation dogma has been re-evaluated as a result of the studies on reconsolidation. These studies showed that prevention after [[recall (memory)|retrieval]] affects subsequent retrieval of the memory (Sara 2000). New studies have shown that post-retrieval treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors and many other compounds can lead to an amnestic state (Nadel et al. 2000b; Alberini 2005; Dudai 2006).  These findings on reconsolidation fit with the behavioral evidence that retrieved memory is not a carbon copy of the initial experiences, and memories are updated during retrieval.

==Genetics==
{{see also|Long-term potentiation|Eric Kandel}}
Study of the genetics of human memory is in its infancy though many genes have been investigated for their association to memory in humans and non-human animals. A notable initial success was the association of [[Apolipoprotein E|APOE]] with memory dysfunction in [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The search for genes associated with normally varying memory continues. One of the first candidates for normal variation in memory is the protein ''[[KIBRA]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/2006/10/20/20650.aspx |title=Gene called Kibra plays an important role in memory |publisher=News-medical.net |date= 2006-10-20|access-date=2012-11-08}}</ref>'' which appears to be associated with the rate at which material is forgotten over a delay period. There has been some evidence that memories are stored in the nucleus of neurons.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180514151920.htm | title=Biologists 'transfer' a memory through RNA injection: Research in marine snails could lead to new treatments to restore memories and alter traumatic ones}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=June 2018}}

===Genetic underpinnings===

Several genes, proteins and enzymes have been extensively researched for their association with memory. Long-term memory, unlike short-term memory, is dependent upon the synthesis of new proteins.<ref>{{cite book | author = Costa-Mattioli M, Sonenberg N | year = 2008 | title = Translational control of gene expression: a molecular switch for memory storage | journal = Prog Brain Res | volume = 169 | pages = 81–95 | pmid = 18394469 | doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(07)00005-2| last2 = Sonenberg | series = Progress in Brain Research | isbn = 9780444531643 }}</ref> This occurs within the cellular body, and concerns the particular transmitters, receptors, and new synapse pathways that reinforce the communicative strength between neurons. The production of new proteins devoted to synapse reinforcement is triggered after the release of certain signaling substances (such as calcium within hippocampal neurons) in the cell. In the case of hippocampal cells, this release is dependent upon the expulsion of magnesium (a binding molecule) that is expelled after significant and repetitive synaptic signaling. The temporary expulsion of magnesium frees NMDA receptors to release calcium in the cell, a signal that leads to gene transcription and the construction of reinforcing proteins.<ref>Neihoff, Debra (2005) "The Language of Life 'How cells Communicate in Health and Disease'" Speak Memory, 210–223.</ref> For more information, see [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP).

One of the newly synthesized proteins in LTP is also critical for maintaining long-term memory. This protein is an autonomously active form of the enzyme [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), known as [[PKMζ]]. PKMζ maintains the activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic strength and inhibiting [[PKMζ]] erases established long-term memories, without affecting short-term memory or, once the inhibitor is eliminated, the ability to encode and store new long-term memories is restored. Also, [[BDNF]] is important for the persistence of long-term memories.<ref>{{Cite journal

===[[DNA methylation]] and [[DNA demethylation|demethylation]]===

Rats exposed to an intense [[learning]] event may retain a life-long memory of the event, even after a single training session.  The long-term memory of such an event appears to be initially stored in the [[hippocampus]], but this storage is transient.  Much of the long-term storage of the memory seems to take place in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Frankland PW, Bontempi B, Talton LE, Kaczmarek L, Silva AJ | year = 2004 | title = The involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex in remote contextual fear memory | journal = Science | volume = 304 | issue = 5672| pages = 881–3 | pmid = 15131309 | doi = 10.1126/science.1094804 | bibcode = 2004Sci...304..881F | s2cid = 15893863 }}</ref>  When such an exposure was experimentally applied, more than 5,000 differently methylated DNA regions appeared in the [[hippocampus]] [[neuron]]al [[genome]] of the rats at one and at 24 hours after training.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Duke CG, Kennedy AJ, Gavin CF, Day JJ, Sweatt JD | date = Jun 2017 | title = Experience-dependent epigenomic reorganization in the hippocampus | journal = Learn.

Furthermore, many other genes were [[downregulation and upregulation|upregulated]], likely often due to hypomethylation.  Hypomethylation often results from the removal of methyl groups from previously existing [[5-methylcytosine]]s in DNA.  Demethylation is carried out by several proteins acting in concert, including the [[TET enzymes]] as well as enzymes of the DNA [[base excision repair]] pathway (see [[Epigenetics in learning and memory]]).  The pattern of induced and repressed genes in brain neurons subsequent to an intense learning event likely provides the molecular basis for a long-term memory of the event.

===Epigenetics===
{{Main|Epigenetics in learning and memory}}
Studies of the molecular basis for memory formation indicate that [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] mechanisms operating in [[brain]] [[neuron]]s play a central role in determining this capability.  Key epigenetic mechanisms involved in memory include the [[DNA methylation|methylation]] and [[DNA demethylation|demethylation]] of neuronal DNA, as well as modifications of [[histone]] proteins including [[histone methylation|methylations]], [[histone acetylation and deacetylation|acetylations and deacetylations]].

Stimulation of brain activity in memory formation is often accompanied by the generation of [[DNA damage|damage in neuronal DNA]] that is followed by repair associated with persistent epigenetic alterations. In particular the DNA repair processes of [[non-homologous end joining]] and [[base excision repair]] are employed in memory formation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removal of citation to content from predatory publisher}}

In fact, the term 'infantile amnesia' refers to the phenomenon of accelerated forgetting during infancy. Importantly, infantile amnesia is not unique to humans, and preclinical research (using rodent models) provides insight into the precise neurobiology of this phenomenon. A review of the literature from behavioral neuroscientist [[Jee Hyun Kim|Dr Jee Hyun Kim]] suggests that accelerated forgetting during early life is at least partly due to rapid growth of the brain during this period.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Ontogeny of memory: An update on 40 years of work on infantile amnesia|journal = Behavioural Brain Research|date = 2016-02-01|pages = 4–14|volume = 298|issue= Part A|series = Developmental Regulation of Memory in Anxiety and Addiction|doi = 10.1016/j.bbr.2015.07.030|first1 = Heather Bronwyn|last1 = Madsen|first2 = Jee Hyun|last2 = Kim|pmid=26190765|s2cid = 30878407}}</ref>

==Aging==
{{Main|Memory and aging}}
One of the key concerns of older adults is the experience of [[memory loss]], especially as it is one of the hallmark symptoms of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. However, memory loss is qualitatively different in normal [[aging]] from the kind of memory loss associated with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's (Budson & Price, 2005).  Research has revealed that individuals' performance on memory tasks that rely on frontal regions declines with age.  Older adults tend to exhibit deficits on tasks that involve knowing the temporal order in which they learned information;<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Parkin A.J. |author2=Walter B.M. |author3=Hunkin N.M. |title=Relationships between normal aging, frontal lobe function, and memory for temporal and spatial information |journal=Neuropsychology |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=304–312 |year=1995 |doi=10.1037/0894-4105.9.3.304}}</ref> source memory tasks that require them to remember the specific circumstances or context in which they learned information;<ref>{{cite journal |author1=McIntyer J.S. |author2=Craik F.I.M. |title=Age differences in memory for item and source information |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=175–192 |year=1987 |doi=10.1037/h0084154 |pmid=3502895}}</ref> and prospective memory tasks that involve remembering to perform an act at a future time.  Older adults can manage their problems with prospective memory by using appointment books, for example.

Gene [[transcription (biology)|transcription]] profiles were determined for the human [[frontal lobe|frontal cortex]] of individuals from age 26 to 106 years.  Numerous genes were identified with reduced expression after age 40, and especially after age 70.<ref name="pmid15190254">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lu T, Pan Y, Kao SY, Li C, Kohane I, Chan J, Yankner BA |title=Gene regulation and DNA damage in the ageing human brain |journal=Nature |volume=429 |issue=6994 |pages=883–91 |date=June 2004 |pmid=15190254 |doi=10.1038/nature02661 |bibcode=2004Natur.429..883L |s2cid=1867993 }}</ref>  Genes that play central roles in memory and [[learning]] were among those showing the most significant reduction with age.

It was suggested  that DNA damage may reduce the expression of selectively vulnerable genes involved in memory and learning.<ref name="pmid15190254" />

==Disorders==
{{Main|Memory disorder}}
Much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying ''memory disorders'', particularly amnesia. Loss of memory is known as [[amnesia]]. Amnesia can result from extensive damage to: (a) the regions of the medial temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subiculum, amygdala, the parahippocampal, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortices<ref>{{cite journal |author=Corkin S, Amaral DG, Gonzalez RG, Johnson KA, Hyman, BT |title=H.M.'s medial temporal lobe lesion: Findings from magnetic resonance imaging |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=3964–3979 |year=1997|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.17-10-03964.1997 |pmid=9133414 |doi-access=free }}</ref> or the (b) midline diencephalic region, specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zola-Morgan S, Suire LR |title=Neuroanatomy of memory |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |volume=16 |pages=547–563 |year=1993 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.16.030193.002555 |pmid=8460903|s2cid=16569263 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/23d0c1c2b78c4fd73a5004a95bfe36697fdd6c87 }}</ref>  There are many sorts of amnesia, and by studying their different forms, it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain's memory systems, and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain. Other [[neurology|neurological]] disorders such as [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol21/vol21_iss22/record2122.15.html |title=Memory of Time May Be Factor in Parkinson's |publisher=Columbia.edu |date=1996-04-05 |access-date=2012-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122051413/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol21/vol21_iss22/record2122.15.html |archive-date=2019-01-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> can also affect memory and cognition.
[[Hyperthymesia]], or hyperthymesic syndrome, is a disorder that affects an individual's autobiographical memory, essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg19726431.600-forgetfulness-is-key-to-a-healthy-mind.html Forgetfulness is the Key to a Healthy Mind]. [[New Scientist]], February 16. 2008.</ref>  [[Korsakoff's syndrome]], also known as Korsakoff's psychosis, amnesic-confabulatory syndrome, is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex.<ref name=":0" />

While not a disorder, a common ''temporary'' failure of word retrieval from memory is the [[Tip of the tongue|tip-of-the-tongue]] [[phenomenon]]. Sufferers of [[Anomic aphasia]] (also called Nominal aphasia or Anomia), however, do experience the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon on an ongoing basis due to damage to the frontal and parietal [[lobes of the brain]].

==Influencing factors==
Interference can hamper memorization and retrieval. There is [[Interference theory|retroactive interference]], when learning new information makes it harder to recall old information<ref>{{cite journal |author=Underwood BJ |title=Interference and forgetting |journal=Psychological Review |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=49–60 |year=1957 |doi=10.1037/h0044616|pmid=13408394 }}</ref> and '''proactive interference''', where prior learning disrupts recall of new information.  Although interference can lead to forgetting, it is important to keep in mind that there are situations when old information can facilitate learning of new information.  Knowing Latin, for instance, can help an individual learn a related language such as French – this phenomenon is known as positive transfer.<ref name="Perkins Salomon 1992">{{cite encyclopedia |vauthors=Perkins DN, Salomon G |title=Transfer of learning |editor1=Postlethwaite, T.

==Stress==
Stress has a significant effect on memory formation and learning.  In response to stressful situations, the brain releases hormones and neurotransmitters (ex. glucocorticoids and catecholamines) which affect memory encoding processes in the hippocampus.  Behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces adrenal hormones which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Conrad C.D. | s2cid = 41414240 | year = 2010 | title = A critical review of chronic stress effects on spatial learning and memory | journal = [[Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry]] | volume = 34 | issue = 5| pages = 742–755 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2009.11.003 | pmid = 19903505 }}</ref>  An experimental study by German cognitive psychologists L. Schwabe and O. Wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabe|first1=L.|last2=Wolf|first2=O.T.|s2cid=38765943|title=Learning under stress impairs memory formation|journal=Neurobiology of Learning and Memory|year=2010|volume=93|issue=2|pages=183–188|doi=10.1016/j.nlm.2009.09.009|pmid=19796703}}</ref>  In this study, 48 healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group.  Those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water (the reputable SECPT or 'Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test') for up to three minutes, while being monitored and videotaped.   Both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memorize.  Twenty-four hours later, both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember (free recall) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words (recognition performance). The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group, who recalled 30% fewer words than the control group.  The researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process.

However, memory performance can be enhanced when material is linked to the learning context, even when learning occurs under stress.  A separate study by cognitive psychologists Schwabe and Wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task (i.e., in the same room), memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabe|first1=L.|last2=Wolf|first2=O.T.|title=The context counts: Congruent learning and testing environments prevent memory retrieval impairment following stress|journal= Cognitive, Affective, & Behavioral Neuroscience|year=2009|volume=9|issue=3|pages=229–236|doi=10.3758/CABN.9.3.229|pmid=19679758|doi-access=free}}</ref> Seventy-two healthy female and male university students, randomly assigned to the [[SECPT stress test]] or to a control group, were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards – a computerized version of the card game "Concentration" or "Memory".  The room in which the experiment took place was infused with the scent of vanilla, as odour is a strong cue for memory.  Retention testing took place the following day, either in the same room with the vanilla scent again present, or in a different room without the fragrance.    The memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object-location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent (an incongruent context);  however, the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the original room with the vanilla scent (a congruent context).   All participants in the experiment, both stressed and unstressed, performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwabe|first1=L.|last2=Bohringer|first2=A.|last3=Wolf|first3=O.T.|title=Stress disrupts context-dependent memory|journal=[[Learning and Memory]]|year=2009|volume=16|issue=2|pages=110–113|doi=10.1101/lm.1257509|pmid=19181616|doi-access=free}}</ref>

This research on the [[effects of stress on memory]] may have practical implications for education, for eyewitness testimony and for psychotherapy:  students may perform better when tested in their regular classroom rather than an exam room, eyewitnesses may recall details better at the scene of an event than in a courtroom, and persons suffering from [[post-traumatic stress]] may improve when helped to situate their [[memories of a traumatic event]] in an appropriate context.

Stressful life experiences may be a cause of memory loss as a person ages. [[Glucocorticoids]] that are released during stress, damage neurons that are located in the [[hippocampal]] region of the brain. Therefore, the more stressful situations that someone encounters, the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on. The [[CA1 neurons]] found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of [[glutamate]]. This high level of extracellular glutamate allows calcium to enter [[NMDA receptors]] which in return kills neurons. Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind.<ref name=":0" /> This directly relates to traumatic events in one's past such as kidnappings, being prisoners of war or sexual abuse as a child.

The more long term the exposure to stress is, the more impact it may have. However, short term exposure to stress also causes impairment in memory by interfering with the function of the hippocampus. Research shows that subjects placed in a stressful situation for a short amount of time still have blood glucocorticoid levels that have increased drastically when measured after the exposure is completed. When subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they often have difficulties. Prenatal stress also hinders the ability to learn and memorize by disrupting the development of the hippocampus and can lead to unestablished long term potentiation in the offspring of severely stressed parents. Although the stress is applied prenatally, the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=N.|year=2013|title=Physiology of Behavior, eleventh edition|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson}}</ref>

==Sleep==
Making memories occurs through a three-step process, which can be enhanced by [[sleep]]. The three steps are as follows:
# Acquisition which is the process of storage and retrieval of new information in memory
# [[Memory consolidation|Consolidation]]
# [[Recall (memory)|Recall]]
Sleep affects memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brain's abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep (SWS).<ref name="Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss">{{cite web|last1=Karriem-Norwood|first1=Varnada|title=Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss|url=http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-deprivation-effects-on-memory|website=Web MD|publisher=Web MD LLC|access-date=November 20, 2014}}</ref> This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesn't enhance every memory.  It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. During sleep, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, which moves them into long-term memory. When one does not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning.<ref name="Sleep Deprivation and Memory Loss"/> Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory.
One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test.<ref name="Ellenbogen 2006">{{cite journal|author1=Ellenbogen, J.M. |author2=Hulbert, J.C. |author3=Stickgold, R. |author4=Dinges, D.F. |author5=Thompson-Schill, S.L. |title=Interfering with theories of sleep and memory: sleep, declarative memory, and associative interference |journal=Curr.

==Construction for general manipulation==
Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, this is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime.<ref>Schwarzel. M.& Mulluer. U.,  "Dynamic Memory Networks", "Cellular and Molecular Life Science", 2006</ref> In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed: "current hypotheses suggest that constructive processes allow individuals to simulate and imagine future episodes,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jonathan L. C.|date=2009-08-01|title=Reconsolidation: maintaining memory relevance|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|volume=32|issue=8|pages=413–420|doi=10.1016/j.tins.2009.05.002|pmid=19640595|pmc=3650827|issn=0166-2236}}</ref> happenings, and scenarios. Since the future is not an exact repetition of the past, simulation of future episodes requires a complex system that can draw on the past in a manner that flexibly extracts and recombines elements of previous experiences – a constructive rather than a reproductive system."<ref name="crossingdialogues.com"/> People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them.  To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer (1974)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Loftus EF, Palmer JC|title=Reconstruction of automobile destruction: An example of the interaction between language and memory |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning & Verbal Behavior |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=585–589 |year=1974 |doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(74)80011-3}}</ref> in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw.  The researchers found that the people who were asked, "How fast were the cars going when they ''smashed'' into each other?" gave higher estimates than those who were asked, "How fast were the cars going when they ''hit'' each other?"  Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they had seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with ''smashed'' were twice more likely to report that they had seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with ''hit''.  There was no broken glass depicted in the film.  Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers' memories of the event.  Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event – those who were asked the question with ''smashed'' recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen.  The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the [[misinformation effect]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Loftus GR |title=When a lie becomes memory's truth: Memory distortion after exposure to misinformation |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=121–123 |year=1992 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10769035|s2cid=12793048 }}</ref>

Research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories.  For instance, Goff and Roediger<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Goff LM, Roediger HL|title=Imagination inflation for action events: Repeated imaginings lead to illusory recollections |journal=Memory and Cognition |volume=26 |pages=20–33 |year=1998 |issue=1 |doi=10.3758/bf03211367|pmid=9519694 |doi-access=free }}</ref> (1998) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act (e.g., break a toothpick) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing.  Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment.  Similarly, Garry and her colleagues (1996)<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Garry M, Manning CG, Loftus EF, Sherman SJ |title=Imagination inflation: Imagining a childhood event inflates confidence that it occurred |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=208–214 |year=1996 |doi=10.3758/bf03212420|pmid=24213869 |doi-access=free }}</ref> asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children (e.g., broke a window with their hand) and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events.  The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children.  That is, when asked to imagine the events they were more confident that they experienced the events.

Research reported in 2013 revealed that it is possible to artificially stimulate prior memories and artificially implant false memories in mice. Using [[optogenetics]], a team of RIKEN-MIT scientists caused the mice to incorrectly associate a benign environment with a prior unpleasant experience from different surroundings. Some scientists believe that the study may have implications in studying false memory formation in humans, and in treating PTSD and [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=BBC20130725>{{cite news |title=Scientists can implant false memories into mice |first=Melissa |last=Hogenboom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23447600 |newspaper=BBC News |date=July 25, 2013 |access-date=July 26, 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/steve_ramirez_and_xu_liu_a_mouse_a_laser_beam_a_manipulated_memory.html "A mouse.

Memory reconsolidation is when previously consolidated memories are recalled or retrieved from long-term memory to your active consciousness. During this process, memories can be further strengthened and added to but there is also risk of manipulation involved. We like to think of our memories as something stable and constant when they are stored in long-term memory but this isn't the case. There are a large number of studies that found that consolidation of memories is not a singular event but are put through the process again, known as reconsolidation.<ref name=":03">{{Cite journal|last1=Tronson|first1=Natalie C.|last2=Taylor|first2=Jane R.|date=April 2007|title=Molecular mechanisms of memory reconsolidation|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=4|pages=262–275|doi=10.1038/nrn2090|pmid=17342174|s2cid=1835412|issn=1471-003X}}</ref> This is when a memory is recalled or retrieved and placed back into your working memory. The memory is now open to manipulation from outside sources and the misinformation effect which could be due to misattributing the source of the inconsistent information, with or without an intact original memory trace (Lindsay and Johnson, 1989).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Schiller|first1=Daniela|last2=Phelps|first2=Elizabeth A.|date=2011|title=Does Reconsolidation Occur in Humans?|journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=5|pages=24|doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2011.00024|pmid=21629821|pmc=3099269|issn=1662-5153}}</ref> One thing that can be sure is that memory is malleable.

This new research into the concept of reconsolidation has opened the door to methods to help those with unpleasant memories or those that struggle with memories. An example of this is if you had a truly frightening experience and recall that memory in a less arousing environment, the memory will be weaken the next time it is retrieved.<ref name=":03" />  "Some studies suggest that over-trained or strongly reinforced memories do not undergo reconsolidation if reactivated the first few days after training, but do become sensitive to reconsolidation interference with time."<ref name=":03" /> This, however does not mean that all memory is susceptible to reconsolidation. There is evidence to suggest that memory that has undergone strong training and whether or not is it intentional is less likely to undergo reconsolidation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Nader|first1=Karim|last2=Einarsson|first2=Einar Örn|date=March 2010|title=Memory reconsolidation: an update|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1191|issue=1|pages=27–41|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05443.x|pmid=20392274|issn=0077-8923|bibcode=2010NYASA1191...27N}}</ref> There was further testing done with rats and mazes that showed that reactivated memories were more susceptible to manipulation, in both good and bad ways, than newly formed memories.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sara|first=S.

Because the study of reconsolidation is still a newer concept, there is still debate on whether it should be considered scientifically sound.

A UCLA research study published in the June 2008 issue of the ''American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry'' found that people can improve [[Cognition|cognitive function]] and brain efficiency through simple lifestyle changes such as incorporating memory exercises, [[healthy eating]], [[physical fitness]] and [[Stress management|stress reduction]] into their daily lives. This study examined 17 subjects, (average age 53) with normal memory performance.
Eight subjects were asked to follow a "brain healthy" diet, relaxation, physical, and mental exercise (brain teasers and verbal memory training techniques). After 14 days, they showed greater word fluency (not memory) compared to their baseline performance. No long-term follow-up was conducted; it is therefore unclear if this intervention has lasting effects on memory.<ref name="Small 2006">{{cite journal |author1=Small, G.W. |author2=Silverman, D.H. |author3=Siddarth, P. |title=Effects of a 14-day healthy longevity lifestyle program on cognition and brain function |journal=Am J Geriatr Psychiatry |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=538–45 |date=June 2006 |pmid=16731723 |doi=10.1097/01.JGP.0000219279.72210.ca |s2cid=10975990 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3f400d6baa803e94a85cabe82133d076ef96078a|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

There are a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques that can be used to vastly improve memory known as the [[art of memory]].

The [[International Longevity Center]] released in 2001 a report<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilcusa.org/_lib/pdf/isoa.pdf |title=International Longevity Center report on memory |access-date=1 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070719053600/http://www.ilcusa.org/_lib/pdf/ISOA.pdf |archive-date=19 July 2007 }}</ref> which includes in pages 14–16 recommendations for keeping the mind in good functionality until advanced age. Some of the recommendations are to stay intellectually active through learning, training or reading, to keep physically active so to promote blood circulation to the brain, to socialize, to reduce stress, to keep sleep time regular, to avoid depression or emotional instability and to observe good nutrition.

[[Memorization]] is a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim. [[Rote learning]] is the method most often used. Methods of memorizing things have been the subject of much discussion over the years with some writers, such as [[Cosmos Rossellius]] using visual [[alphabets]]. The [[spacing effect]] shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time. In contrast to this is [[Cram school|cramming]]: an intensive memorization in a short period of time. the spacing effect is exploited to improve memory in [[spaced repetition]] flashcard training. Also relevant is the [[Zeigarnik effect]] which states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. The so-called [[Method of loci]] uses spatial memory to memorize non-spatial information.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Olsson Henrik, Poom Leo, Treisman Anne | year = 2005 | title = Visual memory needs categories | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 24| pages = 8776–8780 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0500810102 | pmid = 15937119 | pmc = 1150822 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.8776O }}</ref>

== In plants ==
Plants lack a specialized organ devoted to memory retention, so plant memory has been a controversial topic in recent years. New advances in the field have identified the presence of [[neurotransmitter]]s in plants, adding to the hypothesis that plants are capable of remembering.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last1=Baluška|first1=František|last2=Mancuso|first2=Stefano|date=2009-02-01|title=Plant neurobiology: from sensory biology, via plant communication, to social plant behavior|journal=Cognitive Processing|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=3–7|doi=10.1007/s10339-008-0239-6|pmid=18998182|s2cid=9880214|issn=1612-4782}}</ref> [[Action potential]]s, a physiological response characteristic of [[neuron]]s, have been shown to have an influence on plants as well, including in wound responses and [[photosynthesis]].<ref name=":02" /> In addition to these homologous features of memory systems in both plants and animals, plants have also been observed to encode, store and retrieve basic short-term memories.

One of the most well-studied plants to show rudimentary memory is the [[Venus flytrap]]. Native to the subtropical wetlands of the eastern United States, Venus Fly Traps have evolved the ability to obtain meat for sustenance, likely due to the lack of nitrogen in the soil.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Hedrich|first1=Rainer|last2=Neher|first2=Erwin|year=2018|title=Venus Flytrap: How an Excitable, Carnivorous Plant Works|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=23|issue=3|pages=220–234|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2017.12.004|pmid=29336976|issn=1360-1385}}</ref> This is done by two trap-forming leaf tips that snap shut once triggered by a potential prey. On each lobe, three triggers hairs await stimulation. In order to maximize the benefit to cost ratio, the plant enables a rudimentary form of memory in which two trigger hairs must be stimulated within 30 seconds in order to result in trap closure.<ref name=":1" /> This system ensures that the trap only closes when potential prey is within grasp.

The time lapse between trigger hair stimulations suggests that the plant can remember an initial stimulus long enough for a second stimulus to initiate trap closure. This memory isn't encoded in a brain, as plants lack this specialized organ. Rather, information is stored in the form of cytoplasmic calcium levels. The first trigger causes a subthreshold cytoplasmic calcium influx.<ref name=":1" /> This initial trigger isn't enough to activate trap closure, so a subsequent stimulus allows for a secondary influx of calcium. The latter calcium rise superimposes on the initial one, creating an action potential that passes threshold, resulting in trap closure.<ref name=":1" /> Researchers, to prove that an electrical threshold must be met to stimulate trap closure, excited a single trigger hair with a constant mechanical stimulus using Ag/AgCl electrodes.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Volkov|first1=Alexander G.|last2=Carrell|first2=Holly|last3=Baldwin|first3=Andrew|last4=Markin|first4=Vladislav S.|date=2009|title=Electrical memory in Venus flytrap|journal=Bioelectrochemistry|volume=75|issue=2|pages=142–147|doi=10.1016/j.bioelechem.2009.03.005|pmid=19356999|issn=1567-5394}}</ref> The trap closed after only a few seconds. This experiment gave evidence to demonstrate that the electrical threshold, not necessarily the number of trigger hair stimulations, was the contributing factor in Venus Fly Trap memory. It has been shown that trap closure can be blocked using uncouplers and inhibitors of [[Voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-gated channels]].<ref name=":2" /> After trap closure, these electrical signals stimulate glandular production of [[jasmonic acid]] and [[hydrolase]]s, allowing for digestion of the prey.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stokstad|first=Erik|date=2016-05-13|title=How the Venus flytrap acquired its taste for meat|journal=Science|language=en|volume=352|issue=6287|pages=756|doi=10.1126/science.352.6287.756|issn=0036-8075|pmid=27174967|bibcode=2016Sci...352..756S}}</ref>

The field of plant neurobiology has gained a large amount of interest over the past decade, leading to an influx of research regarding plant memory. Although the Venus flytrap is one of the more highly studied, many other plants exhibit the capacity to remember, including the ''[[Mimosa pudica]]'' through an experiment conducted by Monica Gagliano and colleagues in 2013.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gagliano|first1=Monica|last2=Renton|first2=Michael|last3=Depczynski|first3=Martial|last4=Mancuso|first4=Stefano|date=2014-05-01|title=Experience teaches plants to learn faster and forget slower in environments where it matters|journal=Oecologia|language=en|volume=175|issue=1|pages=63–72|doi=10.1007/s00442-013-2873-7|pmid=24390479|issn=0029-8549|bibcode=2014Oecol.175...63G|s2cid=5038227}}</ref> To study the ''[[Mimosa pudica]],'' Gagliano designed an appartus with which potted mimosa plants could be repeatedly dropped the same distance and at the same speed. It was observed that the plants defensive response of curling up its leaves decreased over the 60 times the experiment was repeated per plant. To confirm that this was a mechanism of memory rather than exhaustion, some of the plants were shaken post experiment and displayed normal defensive responses of leaf curling. This experiment also demonstrated long term memory in the plants, as it was repeated a month later and the plants were observed to remain unfazed by the dropping. As the field expands, it is likely that we will learn more about the capacity of a plant to remember.
