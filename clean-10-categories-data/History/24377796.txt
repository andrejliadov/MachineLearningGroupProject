==Effects on life==
{{Life timeline}}
The Great Oxygenation Event had the first major effect on the course of evolution. Due to the rapid buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere, many organisms that didn't rely on oxygen to live died.<ref name="Butterfield2009"/>
The concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere is often cited as a possible contributor to large-scale evolutionary phenomena, such as the origin of the [[Multicellularity|multicellular]] [[Ediacara biota]], the [[Cambrian explosion]], trends in animal body size, and other extinction and diversification events.<ref name="Butterfield2009"/>

The large size of insects and amphibians in the [[Carboniferous period]], when the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere reached 35%, has been attributed to the limiting role of diffusion in these organisms' metabolism.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Polet | first1 = Delyle | title = THE BIGGEST BUGS: AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE FACTORS CONTROLLING THE MAXIMUM SIZE OF INSECTS|volume=2|issue=1|pages=43–46|year = 2011|url = https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/eureka/index.php/eureka/article/download/10299/8000}}</ref> But Haldane's essay<ref>{{citation |first=J.B.S. |last=Haldane |title=On being the right size |at=paragraph&nbsp;7}}</ref> points out that it would only apply to insects. However, the biological basis for this correlation is not firm, and many lines of evidence show that oxygen concentration is not size-limiting in modern insects.<ref name= "Butterfield2009"/> There is no significant correlation between atmospheric oxygen and maximum body size elsewhere in the geological record.<ref name="Butterfield2009"/> Ecological constraints can better explain the diminutive size of post-Carboniferous dragonflies - for instance, the appearance of flying competitors such as [[pterosaur]]s, birds and bats.<ref name="Butterfield2009"/>

Rising oxygen concentrations have been cited as one of several drivers for evolutionary diversification, although the physiological arguments behind such arguments are questionable, and a consistent pattern between oxygen concentrations and the rate of evolution is not clearly evident.<ref name="Butterfield2009"/> The most celebrated link between oxygen and evolution occurs at the end of the last of the [[Snowball Earth|Snowball]] glaciations, where complex multicellular life is first found in the fossil record. Under low oxygen concentrations and before the evolution of [[nitrogen fixation]], biologically-available nitrogen compounds were in limited supply <ref name="Navarro-González">{{cite journal |first1=Rafaell |last1=Navarro-González |first2=Christopher P. |last2=McKay |first3=Delphine |last3=Nna Mvondo |title=A possible nitrogen crisis for Archaean life due to reduced nitrogen fixation by lightning |journal=Nature |volume=412|pages=61–64 |issue=5 July 2001 |doi=10.1038/35083537 |pmid=11452304 |date=Jul 2001 |hdl=10261/8224|url=https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/8224/3/Post_print_Navarro%20Gonzalez%20et%20al_2001.pdf |bibcode=2001Natur.412...61N |s2cid=4405370 }}</ref> and periodic "nitrogen crises" could render the ocean inhospitable to life.<ref name="Butterfield2009"/> Significant concentrations of oxygen were just one of the prerequisites for the evolution of complex life.<ref name="Butterfield2009"/> Models based on uniformitarian principles (i.e. extrapolating present-day ocean dynamics into deep time) suggest that such a concentration was only reached immediately before [[metazoa]] first appeared in the fossil record.<ref name="Butterfield2009"/> Further, anoxic or otherwise chemically "nasty" oceanic conditions that resemble those supposed to inhibit macroscopic life re-occur at intervals through the early Cambrian, and also in the late Cretaceous &ndash; with no apparent effect on lifeforms at these times.<ref name="Butterfield2009"/> This might suggest that the geochemical signatures found in ocean sediments reflect the atmosphere in a different way before the Cambrian - perhaps as a result of the fundamentally different mode of nutrient cycling in the absence of planktivory.<ref name="Butterfield2007"/><ref name="Butterfield2009"/>

An oxygen-rich atmosphere can release phosphorus and iron from rock, by weathering, and these elements then become available for sustenance of new species whose metabolisms require these elements as oxides.<ref name="NYT-20131003" />
