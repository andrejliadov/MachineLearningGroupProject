'''Living history''' is an activity that incorporates historical tools, activities and dress into an interactive presentation that seeks to give observers and participants a sense of stepping back in time. Although it does not necessarily seek to reenact a specific event in history, living history is similar to, and sometimes incorporates, [[historical reenactment]]. Living history is an educational medium used by [[living history museums]], [[historic site]]s, [[heritage interpretation|heritage interpreters]], schools and historical reenactment groups to educate the public or their own members in particular areas of history, such as clothing styles, pastimes and handicrafts, or to simply convey a sense of the everyday life of a certain period in history.

== Background ==

Living history's approach to gain [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] is less about replaying a certain event according to a planned script as in other reenactment fields. It is more about an immersion of players in a  certain [[era]], to catch, in the sense of [[Walter Benjamin]] the 'spiritual message expressed in every monument's and every  the site's own "trace" and "aura"', even in the [[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|Age of Mechanical Reproduction]].<ref name= MP>Michael Petzet: "In the full richness of their authenticity" - The Test of Authenticity and the New Cult of Monuments, Nara Conference on Authenticity in Relation to the World Heritage 1994.</ref>

An early example of the spiritual and futuristic side of living history can be found in [[Guido von List]]'s book ''Der Wiederaufbau von Carnuntum'' (1900),<ref Name="Ban">Karl Banghard: ''Unter dem Häkelkreuz. Germanische Living History und rechte Affekte: Ein historischer Überblick in drei Schlaglichtern.'' In: Hans-Peter Killguss: ''Die Erfindung der Deutschen. Rezeption der Varusschlacht und die Mystifizierung der Germanen.'' Verlag NS-Dokumentationszentrum, Köln 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-938636-12-1}}. (Mit Beiträgen von Professor Reinhard Wolters, Dr. Tilmann Bendikowski, Dirk Mellies, Michael Fehrenschild, Karl Banghard, Alexander Häusler, Jan Raabe, Dr. Michael Zelle)</ref> which suggested rebuilding the Roman [[Carnuntum]] military camp in Vienna's neighborhood as a sort of [[amusement park]] (compare ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]''). List, himself a right wing neopagan, asked his staff of landlords, waiters and rangers to be dressed in historical gear. He also asked to have any visitors redressed in costumes and described rituals to signify "in-game" and "out-game" status to enhance the immersion experience. E.g. the role of the garment is of interest till today.<ref Name="Ban" />

The term 'living history' describes the performance of bringing history to life for the general public in a rather freewheeling manner. The players are less confined in their actions, but often have to stay at a certain place or building. Historical presentation includes a continuum from well researched attempts to recreate a known historical event for educational purposes, through representations with theatrical elements, to competitive events for purposes of entertainment. The line between amateur and professional presentations at [[living history museum]]s can be blurred, same as the border to [[Live action role-playing game]]s.

While the pros latter routinely use museum professionals and trained interpreters to help convey the story of history to the public, some museums and historic sites employ living history groups with high standards of authenticity for the same role at special events. Such events do not necessarily include a mock battle but aim at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of people of the period. This often includes both military and civilian impressions. Occasionally, storytelling or acting sketches take place to involve or explain the everyday life or military activity to the viewing public. More common are craft and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. Combat training or duels can also be encountered even when larger combat demonstrations are not present.

In the United States, on the [[National Park Service]] land, NPS policy "does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property."<ref>{{cite web | title=Wilson's Creek National Battlefield FAQ | date=23 April 2017| publisher=National Park Service | url=http://www.nps.gov/wicr/faqs.htm}}</ref>  There are exceptions i.e. Saylors Creek, Gettysburg.  These are highly controlled with exacting safety factors, as well as, exacting historical truths.

In [[Germany]] medieval reenactment is usually associated with living history and renaissance fairs and festivals, which are found in nearly each city. So e.g. the Peter and Paul festival in [[Bretten]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.landsknechte-bretten.de/galerie/der-tross-1-tag/|title=Der Tross 10. – 14. Juni 2004|access-date=2014-09-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513165828/http://www.landsknechte-bretten.de/galerie/der-tross-1-tag/|archive-date=2016-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> the [[Landshut Wedding]] or the [[Schloss Kaltenberg]] knights tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ritterturnier.de/|title=Home}}</ref> The majority of combat reenactment groups are battlefield reenactment groups, some of which have become isolated to some degree because of a strong focus on authenticity.

Events with the professional reenactment-group [[Ulfhednar]] lead to a controversy in German archaeology. The German Polish living history group was supported by large museums and scholars and, since 2000 has largely coined the image of early history in Germany and international. Among others, a paper with the programmatic title ''Under the crocheted Swastika, Germanic Living History and rightwing affects''<ref Name="Ban" /> started the dispute 2009. On the other hand, communist Eastern German had some problems with accepting "indianistic" living history reenactors, a widespread variety in Eastern Germany, which were closely monitored by the security forces.<ref>Borries/ Fischer: Sozialistische Cowboys. Der Wilde Westen Ostdeutschlands, Frankfurt/ Main: 2008, S. 35–39.</ref><ref>Friedrich von Borries, Jens-Uwe Fischer: ''Sozialistische Cowboys. Der Wilde Westen Ostdeutschlands''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt/ Main 2008.</ref>
That sort of 'second hand' living history<ref name=gf>Volkskultur aus fremder Hand - Indianer- und Westernhobby in Deutschland zwischen Amerikanisierung, " Anti-Imperialismus" und popularisierter Ethnologie, doctorate Albert - Ludwigs - Universität zu Freiburg i. Br, Gabriele Wilczek 1997</ref> is as well part of western Germany folklore and tries for a high level of authenticity.<ref>[http://www.dw.de/zu-besuch-bei-deutschen-indianern/a-16716293 Zu Besuch bei deutschen "Indianern"] Deutsche Welle 07.05.2013, Ananda Grade</ref>

==Activities==

Activities may be confined to wearing period dress and perhaps explaining relevant historical information, either in role (also called [[first-person interpretation]]) or  out of character (also called [[third-person interpretation]]).  While many museums allow their staff to move in and out of character to better answer visitor questions, some encourage their staff to stay in role at all times.

Living history portrayal often involves demonstrating everyday activities such as cooking, cleaning, medical care, or particular skills and [[handicrafts]]. Depending on the [[List of time periods#Historical periods|historical period]] portrayed, these might include [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[sewing]], [[loom]] [[weaving]], [[tablet weaving]], [[inkle weaving]] or [[tapestry]] weaving, [[cloth]] [[dyeing]], [[basket weaving]], [[rope]] making, [[Leather crafting|leather-working]], [[shoemaking]], [[metalworking]], [[glassblowing]], [[woodworking]] or other crafts. Considerable research is often applied to identifying authentic techniques and often recreating replica tools and equipment.

==Presentation==

Historical reenactment groups often attempt to organize such displays in an [[Campsite|encampment]] or display area at an event, and have a separate area for [[combat reenactment]] activities. While some such exhibits may be conducted in character as a representation of typical everyday life, others are specifically organized to inform the public and so might include an emphasis on handicrafts or other day-to-day activities, which are convenient to stage and interesting to watch, and may be explained out of character. During the 1990s, reenactment groups, primarily [[American Civil War]] groups, began to show interest in this style of interpretation and began using it at their reenactments.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}

As David Thelen has written, many Americans use the past in their daily lives, while simultaneously viewing the place where they often encounter history – the school – with varying levels of distrust and disconnectedness.<ref>Thelen, David. "Learning from the Past: Individual Experience and Re-Enactment." Indiana Magazine of History, Jun 2003, Vol. 99 Issue 2, p. 155</ref>  Living history can be a tool used to bridge the gap between school and daily life to educate people on historical topics. Living history is not solely an objective retelling of historical facts. Its importance lies more in presenting visitors with a sense of a way of life, than in recreating exact events, accurate in every detail.

Many factors contribute to creating a setting in which visitors to living history sites can become active participants in their historical education. Two of the most important are the material culture and the interpreters. Material culture both grounds the audience in the time and place being portrayed, and provides a jumping-off point for conversation.<ref>Peers, Laura. ''Playing Ourselves; Interpreting Native Histories at Historic Reconstructions''. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007. p. 91</ref>  “Interpreters” are the individuals who embody historical figures at living history sites. It is their responsibility to take the historical research that has been done on the sites and decide what meaning it has.<ref>Peers, Laura. ''Playing Ourselves; Interpreting Native Histories at Historic Reconstructions.'' Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2007. p. xiv</ref>  These meanings are often a melding of fact and [[folklore]].

Folklore is an important aspect of living histories because it provides stories which visitors relate to. Whether it is an interpreter embodying a past individual's personal story or discussing a superstition of the time, these accounts allow the audience to see these past figures not as names on a page, but as actual people. However, folklore is also more than stories. Objects, such as dolls or handmade clothing, among others, are considered “folk artifacts,” which are grouped under the heading of “material culture.”<ref>[[Folklore]], "Artifacts"</ref>

Individuals can participate in living histories as a type of [[experiential learning]] in which they make discoveries firsthand, rather than reading about the experience of others.<ref>[[Experiential learning]], "About"</ref>  Living history can also be used to supplement and extend formal education. Collaborations between professional historians who work at living history sites and teachers can lead to greater enthusiasm about studying history at all grade levels.<ref>Vanderstel, David G. ""And I Thought Historians Only Taught": Doing History Beyond the Classroom." OAH Magazine of History; Jan2002, Vol. 16 Issue 2, p.7.</ref>  Many living history sites profess a dedication to education within their mission statements. For instance, the motto of [[Colonial Williamsburg]], “That the Future May Learn from the Past,” proclaims the site's commitment to public edification, as does the portion of the website created for the sole purpose of  aiding teachers in instruction on the village.<ref>Colonial Williamsburg. "[http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm Our Mission.]" Retrieved 2010-10-18.</ref>

Certain educators, such as James Percoco in his Springfield, Virginia high school class, have chosen to integrate [[public history]] into their curricula.<ref>Vanderstel, David G. ""And I Thought Historians Only Taught": Doing History Beyond the Classroom." OAH Magazine of History; Jan2002, Vol. 16 Issue 2, p. 7.</ref>  Since 1991, Percoco has led a class entitled “Applied History,” in which his students have contributed over 20,000 hours of service to various institutions of public history.<ref>James Percoco. "[http://www.jamespercoco.com/bio.htm Biography.]" Retrieved 2010-10-18.</ref>  Formal education can help visitors interpret what they see at living history sites. By providing a structured way of looking at living histories, as well as questions to think about during visits, formal education can enrich the experience, just as living histories can enrich learning in the classroom.

Some museums such as [[Middelaldercentret]] in [[Denmark]] provides living history for school children as a part of their education.<ref>[http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/Born%20og%20skoler/skoletjenesten.html Skoletjenesten] (in Danish)</ref>
