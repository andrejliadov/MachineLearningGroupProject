'''Historicity''' is the historical actuality of persons and events, meaning the quality of being part of [[history]] as opposed to being a historical [[myth]], [[legend]], or [[fiction]]. The historicity of a claim about the past is its factual status.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Margolis|first=Joseph|title=History, Historicity and Science|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1-351-93058-1|location=Oxon|language=en}}</ref> Historicity denotes historical actuality, authenticity, factuality and focuses on the true value of knowledge claims about the past.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wandersee | first1 = J.

Some theoreticians characterize historicity as a dimension of all natural phenomena that take place in space and time. Other scholars characterize it as an attribute reserved to certain human phenomena, in agreement with the practice of [[historiography]].<ref name="Blaga">Jones, Michael S., "[http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/phil_fac_pubs/1 Lucian Blaga, The Historical Phenomenon: An Excerpt from The Historical Being]" (2012). Faculty Publications and Presentations. Paper 1.</ref> [[Herbert Marcuse]] explained historicity as that which "defines history and thus distinguishes it from 'nature' or from the 'economy'" and "signifies the meaning we intend when we say of something that is 'historical'."<ref>Herbert Marcuse, ''Hegel’s Ontology and the Theory of Historicity'', trans. by Seyla Benhabib (Cambridge, MA; London: The MIT Press, 1987), 1.</ref> The ''Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy'' defines historicity as "denoting the feature of our human situation by which we are located in specific concrete temporal and historical circumstances".<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Bunnin|first=Nicholas|title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy|last2=Yu|first2=Jiyuan|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2004|isbn=1405106794|location=Malden, MA|pages=308}}</ref> For [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], historicity identifies human beings as unique and concrete historical beings.<ref name=":0" /> 

Questions regarding historicity concern not just the issue of "what really happened", but also the issue of how modern observers can come to know "what really happened".<ref>[[William J. Hamblin]], professor of history at Brigham Young University. Two part article on historicity, [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/enigmaticmirror/2014/04/22/dh-19-historicity-1/] and [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/enigmaticmirror/2014/04/23/dh-20-historicity-2/]</ref> This second issue is closely tied to historical research practices and methodologies for analyzing the reliability of [[primary sources]] and other evidence. Because various methodologies thematize historicity differently, it's not possible to reduce historicity to a single structure to be represented. Some methodologies like [[historicism]] can make historicity subject to constructions of history based on submerged value commitments.<ref name="Hall1">Hall, J. (2007). ''Historicity and Sociohistorical Research.'' In W. Outhwaite, & S. Turner (Eds.), ''The Sage Handbook of Social Science Methodology.'' (pp. 82–102).

London: Sage Publications Ltd. {{DOI|10.4135/9781848607965.n9}}</ref> The historiographer [[François Hartog]] introduced the notion of regime of historicity to describe a society that considers its past and attempts to deal with it, a process that is also cited as "a method of self-awareness in a human community".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allred|first=Mason Kamana|title=Weimar Cinema, Embodiment, and Historicity: Cultural Memory and the Historical Films of Ernst Lubitsch|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2017|isbn=9780415349185|location=New York|pages=3}}</ref> The historicity of a reported event may be distinct from the historicity of persons involved in the event. For example, a popular story says that as a child, [[George Washington]] chopped down a cherry tree, and when confronted about it, honestly took responsibility for the act. Although there is no doubt that Washington existed as an historical figure, the historicity of this specific account has been found lacking,<ref>D.R. Woolf, ''A Global Encyclopedia of Historical Writing - Volume 2'' (2014), p. 642-43.</ref>
 
Questions of historicity are particularly relevant to partisan or poetic accounts of past events. For example, the [[historicity of the Iliad|historicity of the ''Iliad'']] has become a topic of debate because later archaeological finds suggest that the work was based on some true event.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Haywood|first=Jan|title=Homer’s Iliad and the Trojan War: Dialogues on Tradition|last2=Sweeney|first2=Naoise Mac|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2018|isbn=978-1-350-01270-7|location=London|pages=108}}</ref>

Questions of historicity arise frequently in relation to historical studies of religion. In these cases, value commitments can influence the choice of research methodology.<ref name="Hall2" />
