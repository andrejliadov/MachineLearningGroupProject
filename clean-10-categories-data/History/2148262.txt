{{Politics of Sri Lanka}}
{{Communism sidebar}}

The '''1987–1989 JVP insurrection''' (also known as the ''1989 Revolt'' or the ''JVP Kalabala'') was the second unsuccessful armed revolt which was conducted by the [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] against the [[Government of Sri Lanka]] under [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] [[Junius Richard Jayewardene|J. R. Jayewardene]]. Unlike the first unsuccessful [[1971 JVP Insurrection|JVP insurrection]] of 1971, the second insurrection was not an open revolt, instead, it appeared to be a [[Low-intensity conflict|low intensity conflict]] that lasted from 1987 to 1989 with the JVP resorting to [[subversion]], [[List of people assassinated by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna|assassinations]], raids and attacks on military and civilian targets with the government undertaking [[counter-insurgency]] operations to suppress the JVP.

==Background==
===Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna===
{{main|Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna|Ceylonese protests against the Vietnam War}}
Founded by communist [[Rohana Wijeweera]]. JVP is known for its revolutionary youth background. The organization was banned more than once and the first incident was when the group was involved in riots, [[Ceylonese protests against the Vietnam War|Anti-American riots of 1970s]]. Since then the movement was named ''Che Guevara clique'' (which the JVP didn't claim for itself) by the [[Government of Sri Lanka|Ceylonese Government]] and international media.

Over 410 members were arrested in March and over 20,000 rebels were arrested. The group was registered as a political party internationally in Havana, Cuba in 1978. The pro-western government didn't want it to be a mainstream political party so they banned the party in 1983 following the beginning of the [[Sri Lankan civil war]] blaming they were involved.

=== 1971 JVP insurgency ===
{{main|1971 JVP Insurrection}}
[[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] (JVP) launched an open revolt against the government under Prime Minister [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] in April 1971. Caught off guard the government was able to subdue the insurgency in a matter of weeks. The insurgency lead to the death of 4-5000 (unofficial) people and over 20,000 suspected rebels, mostly youth, were arrested in the amnesty period that followed. The arrested youth were released after rehabilitation.

Rohana Wijeweera and the other major leaders of the insurgency were sentenced to prison terms and the JVP banned. However, all of them were released in 1977 by J. R. Jayewardene after the [[United National Party|UNP]] formed a government after they won the general election under a general amnesty issued for those prosecuted under the infamous Criminal Justice Commission.

=== Civil war ===
During the early 1980s, as the [[Sri Lankan Civil War|Tamil insurgency]] to the north became more intense, there was a marked shift in the ideology and goals of the JVP. Initially Marxist in orientation, and claiming to represent the oppressed of both the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] communities, the group emerged increasingly as a Sinhalese nationalist organization opposing any compromise with the Tamil insurgency.

Rohana Wijeweera came third in the [[1982 Sri Lankan presidential election|presidential elections in 1982]] and the Jayawardene government did not like their rise. There are no convincing evidence as to say whether JVP was involved in 1983 ethnic riots, but it was once again banned with several other left wing parties and its leadership went underground. It is highly suspected that this ban was due to [[J.R Jayawardene|J.R Jayawardene's]] fear of losing the presidential election to somewhat pro socialist Rohana Wijeweera in near future. It is also to be noted that he highly downgraded the diplomatic relations with socialist countries like Cuba,Soviet Union and meny European countries.

== Preparation ==
Having been banned and driven underground, the JVP began preparing to topple the government. They began targeting opponents, carried out robberies to collect funds and began acquiring weapons. Usually collecting pistols and shotguns from owners who had gained gun licences from the government. Thereafter they planned to raid armories of the government, who had deployed its forces to the north and east of the country to counter the Tamil militancy.

==Prelude to open insurrection==
{{see also|Assassination of Daya Pathirana}}
On 15 December 1986, the JVP abducted and murdered Daya Pathirana, leader of the Independent Students Union (ISU) of University of Colombo, which was a rival of the [[Socialist Students Union]], the student's wing of the JVP. By this time JVP was already designated as a terrorist organization by [[J.R Jayawardene]].

===Attacks on politicians===
In 1979 JVP opposed the usage of military to fight the [[LTTE]] and other groups like [[Tamil Eelam Liberation Army|TELA]]. They changed the decision of opposing the war against [[LTTE]] and it was shortly after its ban. Lionel Bopage left the party due to this change of decisions.

====Grenade attacks on the Mahajana Party====
{{main|Vijaya Kumaratunga|United Socialist Alliance}}
[[Mahajana party]] was a close ally of the Tamil Militant groups. In 1986 JVP conducted a grenade attack on the buildings of the Mahajana Party and assassinated [[Vijaya Kumaratunga]] in 1988 when the insurgency came to the peak.

Vijaya Kumaratunga was alleged for being a [[Naxalite]] alongside the [[United Socialist Alliance]].

Kumaratunga was shot in the head with a [[Type 56 assault rifle]] outside his home on the outskirts of [[Colombo]] on 16 February 1988 by Lionel Ranasinghe, alias Gamini. Ranasinghe confessed to the murder under questioning by the [[Criminal Investigation Department (Sri Lanka)|Criminal Investigation Department]]. In a 141-page statement, he said he had been carrying out orders given to him by the [[Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya]] (Patriotic People's Movement), the military arm of the JVP, which was responsible for multiple assassinations in the late 1980s.<ref>[http://www.lankalibrary.com/pol/vijaya2.htm Confessions of Vijaya's killer by Sunday Leader -Frederica Jansz (Virtual Library SL Web)]</ref> However, a presidential commission report concluded that President [[Ranasinghe Premadasa]] of the UNP and two government ministers, [[Gamini Lokuge]] and [[Ranjan Wijeratne]], were behind the Kumaranatunga assassination.<ref>[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2004/03/21/new03.html Vijaya Kumaratunga assassination was a UNP conspiracy: Gamini Lokuge's gun alleged death weapon (Sunday Observer, 21 March 2004)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112040/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2004/03/21/new03.html |date=24 September 2015 }}</ref>

Kumaratunga's funeral, on 21 February 1988, attracted huge crowds and was the first funeral to be broadcast live on Sri Lankan television (by the [[Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation]]). It was held at Independence Square in Colombo as a [[state funeral]], even though he represented the opposition to the UNP government. The day of his assassination is widely known as "The Horrible Tuesday" or "The Darkest Tuesday in Sri Lankan History" (He was assassinated on a Tuesday).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} His death is still mourned by many people in Sri Lanka.<ref name="vijaya-20-years-bbc">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2008/02/080219_chandrika_vijaya.shtml|title=Devolution only solution – CBK (Vijaya's 20th Death Anniversary)|work=BBC News|date=19 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Years of Terror|author=C.A Chandreprema|pages=97–98}}</ref>

==Insurgency==
=== Early attacks===
{{see also|Pallekele Army Camp attack}}
On 15 April 1987, JVP attacked the Pallekele Army Camp in [[Kandy]]. Led by a former soldier, Mahinda, under the directions of Shantha Bandara, the JVP seized 12 [[Type 56 assault rifle]]s, seven sub-machine guns and ammunition. In May 1987, the Sri Lanka Armed Forces launched the [[Vadamarachchi Operation]] (Operation Liberation) with the objective of defeating the [[LTTE]] militarily and re-establishing government control in areas dominated by Tamil militants. However, the second phase of Operation Liberation was abandoned with the Indian intervention by [[Operation Poomalai]], which led to the signing of the [[Indo-Sri Lanka Accord]] in Colombo on 29 July 1987 and arrival of the first troops in the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF) on 30 July.<ref name="DN1">[http://archives.dailynews.lk/2009/08/08/fea01.asp Icon of unparalleled bravery and commitment]</ref>

The prospect of Tamil autonomy in the north together with the presence of Indian troops stirred up a wave of Sinhalese nationalism and a sudden growth of anti-government violence by a new group that emerged as an offshoot of the JVP—the Patriotic Liberation Organization (Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya—DJV) led by [[Saman Piyasiri Fernando]]. On 7 June 1987, Sri Lanka Air Force Base, [[SLAF Katunayake]] and the [[Kotelawala Defence Academy]] were attacked and weapons and ammunition were stolen, while four of the attackers were killed. DJV claimed responsibility and the [[Criminal Investigation Department (Sri Lanka)|Criminal Investigation Department]] investigation resulted in 13 JVP members arrested. On 18 August, when the first parliamentary group meeting took place after the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, [[1987 grenade attack in the Sri Lankan Parliament|assassination attempt]] was made on the president and prime minister, resulting in the deaths of two, including a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP). [[Lalith Athulathmudali]], the Minister National Security and Deputy Minister of Defence, was severely wounded.<ref>[https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/the-jvp-towards-a-second-comeback/ 132 Demonstrators were shot Dead and 712 Arrested During Island -wide Protests Against the Indo – Lanka Accord of July 29th 1987]</ref> The investigation into the raid on the Pallekelle army camp in April 1987 resulted in the discharge of thirty-seven soldiers suspected of having links with the JVP.

===Murder and intimidation===
The DJV thereafter launched a campaign of intimidation against the government and the ruling [[United National Party]] (UNP) party, killing more than seventy members of parliament between July and November 1989.<ref name=rg>{{cite book|last=Gunaratna|first=Rohan|title=Sri Lanka, a lost revolution?: The inside story of the JVP|publisher=Institute of Fundamental Studies|year=1990|isbn=978-955-26-0004-3}}</ref> Organised in cells of three people and based around [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]] in the south, the JVP murdered probably thousands of people and crippled the country with violently-enforced [[hartal]]s (general strikes) for two years. Individuals or organizations were warned or intimidated with messages dropped in the night to homes or posters or graffiti that appeared over night.

Those that did not cooperate were brutally killed, with the repercussions extended to their family members. Executions were mostly carried out at night with armed groups coming to the homes of the victims and carrying them away to be tortured, executed and left as an example, while occasional bombings took place. In most cases the funerals of these victims were not allowed by the JVP, traditional final rights were not allowed and the caskets were to be carried below knee level as a mark of disrespect. With these techniques of fear and intimidation, the JVP was able to bring the country to stand still. Acts of sabotage were common, with destruction of government property, electric transformers were a common target. Killings took place in both urban and rural areas and the government seemed powerless in the face of it. One of the key police officers leading the effort to counter the JVP, [[Senior Superintendent of Police]] Terrence Perera, Director of Counter Subversive Unit was killed by the JVP gunmen in [[Battaramulla]] on 3 December 1987 and Harsha Abhayawardene, UNP General Secretary was killed by the JVP gunmen in [[Wellawatte]] on 23 December 1987. Killings continued into 1987, on 7 February Mervyn Cooray, Member of Parliament for [[Panadura]] survived an assassination attempt, on 1 May; Nandalal Fernando the new UNP General Secretary was killed; G.V.S. de Silva, Galle District Minister was shot dead that month; [[Lionel Jayatilleke]], Minister of Relief and Rehabilitation was shot dead on 26 September 1988 and on 21 October Tudor Keerthinanda, UNP Working Committee Member was killed. 1989 saw the killing of Senior Superintendent of Police Bennet Perera, former Director - [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]], who was gunned down, at Mount Lavinia on 1 May 1989, [[Assistant Superintendent of Police]] Shahabdeen, Security Officer - Minister of Transport was killed on 23 August 1989, Captain B. M. Perera of the military police was shot dead in Moratuwa on 12 September 1989. Close to 50 school principals were killed, along with tea planters (Tea estate superintendents), public servants and clergy between 1988 and 1989 for defying JVP orders sent via short memos known as ''chits''.

Many professionals were also killed for defying JVP orders these included Dr [[Gladys Jayawardene]], Chairperson, State Pharmaceuticals Corporation; D. C. Athukorale, Chief Engineer, Colombo Port Authority; Liayana Pathirana, Working Director, Salt Corporation. 102 Sri Lanka Freedom Party supporters and 64 United Socialist Alliance supporters were also killed. over 30 Buddhist monks were killed. Many businessmen were killed, including the Shanmugam brothers, K. Gunaratnam and Shabeer Hussain. Several Indian expats were also killed, including Mr. and Mrs. Banshall working at the Pelwatta Sugar Factory, D. K. Sundaram, P. Nadar Weeramuni and Ann Herchoi.<ref name="nation1">{{cite news |title=JVP – A never-ending power struggle |url=https://www.nation.lk/2008/05/18/newsfe1.htm |access-date=12 September 2019 |publisher=The Nation}}</ref>

In 1989, the government accused the JVP of having caused the death of over 35,000 people, mostly government supporters<ref>"President of Sri Lanka Pins Hopes on Consensus", ''The Globe and Mail'', 5 May 1989, p. A12</ref> Another report, however, states that the JVP and its militia, the [[Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya]] (DJV), were responsible for "more than 10,000" deaths thus supporting the evidence of the certain amount of deaths were caused by the government.<ref>"Insurgents: Tigers North, Marxists South", Asiaweek, 30 June 1989, p. 20</ref><ref>Nowak M. and T.

A7</ref> A successful strike by transportation and health workers was called by the JVP in mid-August 1989, thus showing the extent of JVP unionist support. At the end of August 1989, the JVP threatened to target soldiers' families if they did not resign from governmental forces. The threats were carried out soon after, in the context of another strike organized by the JVP on 28 August<ref>"Massacre of 14 Civilians Seen as Retaliatory", ''The Globe and Mail'', 30 August 1989, p.

===Notable attacks ===
{{more|Patriotic People's Front (Sri Lanka)}}
Although much of the insurgency was a low-intensity conflict, with targeted assassinations and intimidation. Major attacks include the [[1987 grenade attack in the Sri Lankan Parliament]] and [[1989 Temple of the Tooth attack]]. In addition the militant wing of the JVP led by [[Saman Piyasiri Fernando]] staged several major attacks on military installations in the south of the island and a minority on the North led by [[Premakumar Gunaratnam]]. These included;

In many of these attacks, the JVP targeted the armories capturing weapons and ammunition that it claimed to use against Indian Peace Keeping Forces.<ref>[http://island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=70955 Missed opportunities, War on terror revisited]</ref> In total the JVP killed 342 police personnel, 209 armed forces personnel and 98 [[Sri Lankan home guards]].<ref name="nation1"/>

===Insurgency in Kallar===
An [[Indian Peacekeeping Force]] base came under attack in 1988. Ammunitions were stolen and some mortars were missing too.<ref>C.A Chandraprema. 1991. p. 180</ref> 26 Indian soldiers were killed by a group named 'Patriotic People's Red Army' and their ammunition were stolen as well. 50 members of the JVP raided the camp in Trincomalee and some Tamil groups assisted the JVP through the links [[Premakumar Gunaratnam]] established to certain [[Maoist]] groups active in 
[[Tamil Eelam]] who too were at combat with the Government authorities and the [[LTTE]]. The most significant of them at the time was the Tamil Eelam National Liberation Army. The second was PLFTA led by [[Douglas Devananda]]. Wijeweera and Premakumar visited the EPRLF - Marxist Sector camps to get training for the JVP cadre. [[Inter-university Students' Union]] also helped the JVP establish friendly relations to the Tamil militants through Tamil universities.<ref>Gunaratna, (1990). p. 45-47</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Indian Intervention in Sri Lanka|pages=228, 318}}</ref>{{efn|''for cited info see'' [[List of Sri Lankan Tamil militant groups]]}}

===Brutal counter insurgency operations===
{{more|Sri Lanka and state terrorism}}
Ranasinghe Premadasa called for an anti-communist death squad named the 'Black Cats' who are a state terrorist group. Premadasa used any means possible to control the Tamil separatist and the Communist insurgencies. He did not think that the LTTE could stand the treat JVP was compatible of. He saw communists as organising a 'Mass Movement' to topple his government.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Human rights in developing nations|page=357}}</ref><ref>Uyangoda. 1993.</ref>

Ranasinghe Premadasa openly supported the LTTE to end the other groups like the [[Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front]] and more importantly the interventionist [[IPKF]] which was seen to be invading the country by both [[Sri Lankan Tamil]]s and the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] majority the [[Indo-Lanka accord]] was signed.

When the JVP offensive came to peak, government paramilitaries such as the 'Yellow Cats', 'Scorpions', '[[Eagles of the Hill Country]]' and 'Shra' were used in order resist the insurgency. Some points, none of these paramilitaries were official and they often got into combat with the police forces. With the insurgency, however, government recognized many as possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sri Lanka, a Lost Revolution?: The Inside Story of the JVP|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BFDAAAAYAAJ|author=Rohan Gunaratna|year = 1990|page=295|isbn = 9789552600043}}</ref>

As a reaction to an attack by the DJV on military personnel which killed 15 soldiers. Eagle's of the Hill Country launched an attack killing over 82 suspected JVP supporters. The killed also included children. Every suspect was unarmed. This included [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]] who make a living by the tee estate of Kandy also known as the Hill country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/17/world/gunmen-kill-82-sinhalese-in-sri-lanka.html|title=Gunmen Kill 82 Sinhalese in Sri Lanka|work= The New York Times}}</ref><ref name="latimes">{{cite news |title= Sri Lanka Gunmen Massacre 82 Civilians in Village Rampages |url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-17/news/mn-501_1_sri-lanka |access-date= 17 August 2018 |agency= Associated Press  |work= Los Angeles Times |date= 17 September 1989 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180401165212/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-17/news/mn-501_1_sri-lanka |archive-date= 1 April 2018 |url-status= live}}</ref> On 5 October, 'The Eagles' shot or beheaded fourteen workers at a Peradeniya University residential complex for custodial and clerical staff. Police later received a message from these vigilantes, claiming responsibility for the murders and that the victims were JVP supporters who had engineered the murder of T. E. Nagahawatte, an assistant registrar at the university and a captain in the local army volunteer reserve force. It is noted that the police took similar means of terrorism against the JVP supporters.<ref>{{Cite book|title=UN Human Rights Committee Decisions on Communications from Sri Lanka|page=46,52}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Sri Lanka: Extrajudicial Executions, 'Disappearances' and Torture, 1987 to 1990|location=United Kingdom|publisher=Amnesty International}}</ref>

===Detention ftom state===
The government replied brutally showing no mercy and the government has been accused of using detention camps in several places including Batalanda to quell the JVP uprising. These were said to be run by anti-subversive units of the police who were tasked with disarming the rebels.<ref name="wsws">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/08/sri-a26.html|publisher=wsws.org|title=Sri Lankan government exploits allegations of murder and torture against opposition - World Socialist Web Site|access-date=11 November 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/04234216454178AFC12576B20038FF61-Full_Report.pdf Commissions of inquiry in Sri Lanka]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tchr.net/civil_and_pol_jvp_army_deserters.htm|title=Atrocities of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) or|website=www.tchr.net|access-date=28 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2014/06/01/pol03.asp|title=Anura Kumara apologises in London for JVP's 1988-89 terror|website=www.sundayobserver.lk|access-date=28 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001182426/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2014/06/01/pol03.asp|archive-date=1 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onlanka.com/news/jvp-says-matale-mass-grave-has-remains-of-200-torture-victims.html|title=JVP says Matale mass grave has remains of 200 torture victims ::.

Batalanda commission was appointed by the government of [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]] to look into the violations of human rights and crimes committed at Batalanda torture and detention center. In its report the commission recommended the government to take legal action against then opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. However no legal action was taken against him by any government to date and several who were arrested for their involvement in alleged killings have been revealed to be from organizations such as the [[Sri Lanka Mahajana Party]] which was established by [[Vijaya Kumaranatunga]] who himself was assassinated .<ref>{{cite web|title=Vijaya assassination: Politics kills police professionalism|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/120212/News/nws_28.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lalith Athulathmudali's Assassination –Fact or Fiction?|url=http://www.ceylontoday.lk/print20170401CT20170630.php?id=20301}}</ref>

===Government mass killings and investigation===
It was alleged by both the [[LTTE]] and JVP that government-sponsored death squads were responsible for more deaths than they did. United Nations investigations were not seen as satisfactory to the groups. The government mostly targeted tee state workers for their allegiances to the communist parties.

Police brutality came to peak and it targeted the homeless for their involvement in the attacks on the rich businessmen and tee state owners.

In 1994, after a request by the [[United Nations]] (UN) regarding the mass graves, the Government reported that an excavation of the graves had been carried out on 14 September 1994 under the supervision of the [[High Court of Sri Lanka|High Court]] and it resulted in the discovery of an unspecified number of [[skeletal]] remains.

The reports also indicated that a team of [[forensic]], investigative and legal experts helped the court, in order to ensure a proper and scientific excavation and to assist in the further discovery and identification of bodies and the investigation of the circumstances in which they were buried at Sooriyakanda.<ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/8609717f849d1a5b802566b10041bb43?OpenDocument UNHCHR Report on mass graves in Sri Lanka]</ref> The Government also reported that it has started to investigate newly discovered graves, including one at [[Ankumbura mass grave|Ankumbura]] which may contain the bodies of 36 people killed by the police in 1989.<ref>[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/democracy/1994_hrp_report/94hrp_report_sasia/SriLanka.html TITLE:  SRI LANKA HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES, 1994]</ref>

===Assassination of rivals===
JVP-CPSL rivalry began since the 1970s when the [[IMCWP]] was held in Havanna. Both sought to be favored by the people who supports [[Marxism-Leninism]]. During the insurgency, JVP assassinated a total of 117 members of the United Socialist Alliance<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/archive/20040222/spotlight-1.htm|title=Bloody betrayal, by Dilrukshi Handunnetti (The Sunday Leader, 22 February 2004)}}</ref> which includes the [[Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front|EPRLF]], [[Nava Sama Samaja Party]], [[Communist Party of Sri Lanka|CPSL]] and the [[Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya]].

==Anti-India Campaign==
In 1986 JVP started delivering posters warning about a possible Indian invasion. Since the 1970s Wijeweera have been aware of [[India]]n [[expansionism]] due to the border conflict with [[China]]. JVP attacked an Indian armory in Kallar to steal weapons. The attack was led by the Trincomalee cell leader [[Premakumar Gunaratnam]] of the DJV. JVP conducted massive protest strikes to enforce both the Tamil and Sinhalese groups to fight against the Indian forces. Although with the anti-Indian sentiment, JVP denied any violence against the [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indian Intervention in Sri Lanka|first=Rohan|last=Gunaratne|chapter=JVP's Anti-India Campaign|year=1993|publisher=South Asian Network on Conflict Research, Colombo, 1994|isbn=955-95199-0-5}}</ref>

Ideology of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna rapidly changed from believing in mass movement to believing in militarism against both National and Ethnic enemies. Many criticized this as the [[Far-right politics|ultra-right]] turn from the party that was once considered the [[Far-left politics|Ultra-left]] party of Sri Lanka. South-Asian Terrorism expert [[Rohan Gunaratna]] criticized the JVP as it was once in class struggle later in ultranationalism.<ref>[[Rohan Gunaratna|Gunaratna, Rohan]] 1990, p.81-83</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=The JVP and Tamil militancy|year=2011|url=http://www.thebottomline.lk/2007/11/28/B34.htm|author=T.

==American and British involvement==
By early 1970s the government of Sri Lanka had strengthened the diplomatic connections with UK and the US and heavily banned the practice of anti-capitalist ideologies. The government later banned the Communist Party of Sri Lanka and Nava Samaja Party which is a Troskyte party. In early 1980s the government got private training from the British military contract group [[Keenie Meenie Services]]. India had established strong connections to all of these groups got their help the fight the [[LTTE]] in the late 1980s.<ref>[https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2020/feb/06/india-used-british-mercenary-pilots-in-fight-against-ltte-in-1980s-book-2099790.html]</ref><ref>C.A Chandrepema, p.28</ref> The ban on the CPSL was lifted after the Soviet Embassy did an investigation on the causes. It was revealed that this was a part of aggression by the SL government against communist parties as a result of CIA influence within Sri Lankan politics. The JVP which was banned the same year as the CPSL started heading towards a militarist solution against the government.<ref>Gunasekera 1998, pp. 237-239</ref>

A former JVP and DJV member Sanath explains:
{{quote|When the party got banned we lost a lot. But it gave us a favor. We knew we were heading towards a militarist solution.<ref>[http://jvpthesis.weebly.com/uploads/2/6/9/5/26951649/jvp_thisis_final_1.pdf]</ref>}}

===Opposition===
A decade prior the [[DPRK|North Korean]] embassy which had maintained contacts to the JVP was closed by the government. Like the Soviet embassy and the North Korean embassy, Cuban embassy also had involvement and highly sided with the JVP cadre and [[Communist Party of Sri Lanka|CPSL]] cadre against the pro-Capitalist government of [[J.R Jayawardene]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strengthening Solidarity With Cuba|url=https://www.jvpsrilanka.com/english/download/1156}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The story of a North Korea-backed rebellion in Sri Lanka|url=https://www.nknews.org/2017/10/the-story-of-a-north-korea-backed-rebellion-in-1971-sri-lanka|publisher=NK News}}</ref> JVP didn't attack the [[LTTE]] or any other North Sri Lankan group as Sanath further explains how the state of Sri Lanka was the actual enemy of the people. DJV sometimes formed alliances between Sinhalese and Tamil militants in order to fight against the opposition of the regimes.

== Further brutality ==
{{see also|Sooriyakanda mass grave|Necklacing}}
The JVP made a serious misjudgment when, through the DJV, it called for the killing of members of the families of the security personal. This destroyed the small but significant amount of support that it enjoyed among the lower ranks of the armed forces, and made it possible for the government to justify its [[State terrorism in Sri Lanka|campaign of terror]].<ref>[https://www.lankanewsweb.net/67-general-news/2052-a-bribery-case-against-raththaran Gotabaya Rajapaksha]</ref>

Most notable of the attacks on families of the security personal, was the attack on family of [[Deputy Inspector General of Police]] Premadasa c. On 24 July 1988, his ancestral home in [[Bope-Poddala Divisional Secretariat|Poddala]] was surrounded and set ablaze by suspected members of the JVP, Udugampola's mother, brother, sister-in-law and two small children were killed in the fire. Following this Udugampola began a ruthless crackdown of the JVP in the Southern and Central provinces.<ref name="nation1"/><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Island of Blood|author=[[Anita Pratap]]}}</ref>

As a means of pacifying the support base of JVP, a wide range of acts of cruelty, including the [[torture]] and [[mass murder]] of school children, who were allegedly JVP supporters, was carried out by the state.<ref>

"The 'time of dread' was roughly 1985-89, when ethnic Sinhalese youth took over vast areas of the country and practiced enormous atrocities; they were only eliminated by equally dreadful state terrorism."</ref> In one case, security forces allegedly opened fire on a rally convened by the JVP on 28 July 1989, killing 129 people.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Sri Lanka Correspondent|date=5 August 1989|title=Sri Lanka: Time For Tea, P 33|work=The Economist}}</ref>

The practice of Necklacing was at peak in the country since the late 1970s. Even the [[LTTE]] used these mechanics at the time. The [[LTTE]] however didn't need further violence in their enemies except the [[IPKF]]. Many alleged supporters of the JVP were killed on streets with the message tagged in their heads "This is what happens when you join the JVP". Anybody who spoke against the police were sentenced to death. With the violence at peak with the LTTE Insurgency and the JVP insurgency, Sri Lanka would be internationally tagged for countries that practices cannibalism.<ref name=cannibalism/><ref name="Niestat2008">{{cite book|author=Anna Niestat|title=Recurring Nightmare: State Responsibility for "disappearances" and Abductions in Sri Lanka|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSTnNbcSIIkC&pg=PA19|accessdate=10 April 2013|year=2008|publisher=Human Rights Watch|pages=19–|id=GGKEY:UXWF05XJ0X5}}</ref>

===Personel feuds===
The death squads like 'Black Cats' and 'Yellow Cats' were formed by conservative politicians. [[Private military|Private militaries]] were initially formed to protect the certain politician but when a JVP treat could not be seen, they
were equally attacked by the police, their predominant role was to assassinate the certain politician's enemies. Not only did the JVP personnel die from this process, but also the [[LTTE]], UNP and [[IPKF]]. Businessmen died over personel feuds.<ref>SL: ALR, p. 332-336</ref>

===Sinhalese Nationalism===
A vigilante group named [[Patriotic Sinhala Youth Front]] emerged as an anti-communist group. It was pro-Sri Lanka but not necessarily pro-UNP, or pro-US like the UNP. The group used an infamous "Ape ekata thopee dolahak" meaning "Twelve of Yours, for that one of us!" Soon it emerged in bloody combat against the Patriotic People's Front.<ref>Sri Lanka: The Years of Terror, p. 296-297</ref>

A death treat reads:

{{quote|Dear Grandfather/Grandmother/Mother/Sister, we know that your son/brother/husband is engaged in brutal murder under the pretence of patriotism. Your son/brother/husband, the so-called patriot, has cruelly taken the lives of mothers like you, of sisters, of innocent little children. In addition he has started killing the family members of the heroic Sinhalese soldiers who fought with the Tamil Tigers and sacrificed their lives, in order to protect the motherland. "It is not amongst us, ourselves, the Sinhalese people, that your son/brother/husband has launched the conflict in the name of patriotism? Is it then right that you, the wife/mother/sister of this person who engages in human murder of children should be free to live? Is it not justified to put you to death? From this moment, you and all your family members must be ready to die. May you attain peace in the afterlife! - Patriotic Sinhala Youth Front.}}

==End of the Insurgency==
{{main|Operation Combine}}
Government forces attached to [[Operation Combine]] captured JVP leader [[Rohana Wijeweera]] in [[Ulapane]] and brought to Colombo, where the government claimed 13 November 1989 that Wijeweera was shot and killed by [[H.B. Herath]] during a search operation. Although the Government won a decisive military victory there were credible accusations of brutality and extrajudicial killings.<ref name=PFTCOV>{{cite news |last1=Ferdinando |first1=Shamindra |title=President fails to capitalize on victory over JVP War on terror revisited |url=http://island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page=article-details&code_title=74944 |access-date=5 September 2019 |publisher=Island}}</ref><ref>''Political Killings in Southern Sri Lanka'', [[International Alert]], [[London]] 1989</ref>

===Saman Piyasiri's death and decline of the Insurgency===

After Wijeweera died in late 1989, the leader of the DJV - Saman Piyasiri Fernando seized power within the Major groups of the JVP but within the end of OPS Combine, [[Special Task Force|STF]] were able to capture and execute him and his successor Lalith Wijeratne seized the power of the JVP party.

====Post-Insurgency combat====
Within early 1990; the government reported deaths of all three major leaders and the insurgent party that consisted of over 15,000 troops were almost defeated and gave up the arms. The government had a decisive victory over the JVP, which returned to democratic politics under the leadership of [[Somawansa Amarasinghe]] when its 12-year-long ban got lifted in 1994.<ref name=PFTCOV/>

== Fatalities ==
{{further|List of assassinations of the Second JVP Insurrection}}
According to international [[terrorism]] expert [[Doctor (title)|Dr.]] [[Rohan Gunaratna]]'s research, JVP killed 30 politicians, 23 academics, 1 clergy, 2 government officials, 89 civilians and 61 service personnel, from July 1987 to January 1990. Rest of the killings (21 armed fighters) are attributed to state or state-sponsored death squads.{{Ref label|a|a|none}} A European delegation estimated the total death toll to be 60,000, while more conservative estimates have placed the death toll at 35,000, with the vast majority being perpetrated by state-sponsored death squads.<ref name="casualties-hrw">{{cite web |title=SRI LANKA |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1990/WR90/ASIA.BOU-11.htm#P731_163022 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |access-date=2018-06-24}}</ref> Three members of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID) of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights visited Sri Lanka from 7 to 17 October 1991, and paid a follow-up visit from 5 to 15 October 1992, at the invitation of the Sri Lankan government. Prior to the 1992 visit, the WGEID had transmitted 4,932 cases of "disappearances" to the Government of Sri Lanka and had received reports from various reliable sources about approximately 9,000 cases that had not been processed. The WGEID considers only cases of "disappearances" in which the government is involved; thus, although the WGEID acknowledged it received information about people who disappeared at the hands of the JVP and the LTTE, it could not consider these cases in its report. The WGEID reported its findings to the Commission in February 1993, issuing a series of recommendations, including one that the PCIIRP expand its mandate to investigate the thousands of cases reported prior to its establishment.<ref>AI Feb. 1998, 2-5</ref><ref>United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Sri Lanka: Information on the current status of the People's Liberation Front ([[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna]] - JVP) in the south of [[Sri Lanka]], 2 December 1998</ref>

== Legacy ==
Following the insurrection, the JVP was relaunched and participated in electoral politics. At the [[2004 Sri Lankan parliamentary election|parliamentary elections held on 2 April 2004]], the party was part of the [[United People's Freedom Alliance]] that won 45.6% of the popular vote and 105 out of 225 seats. As the second partner in this alliance it became part of the government. It also supported the winning candidate [[Mahinda Rajapakse]] in the [[2005 Sri Lankan presidential election|2005 parliamentary election]]. Along with the UNP it supported General [[Sarath Fonseka]] in the [[2010 Sri Lankan presidential election|2010 presidential election]].

==In popular media==
The documentary film of the Second JVP insurgency titled ''[[Udugan Yamaya]]'' was made in 2006. It was screened in The Times London film festival the same year.

A movie based on Wijeweera's backstory [[Ginnen Upan Seethala]] was released in 2017 featuring many events that took place between 1977 and 1987.

[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Predator]] is loosely based on the insurgencies of [[Sri Lanka]], It features combat with a group named 'People's Action Front' making a close reference to the 'People's Liberation Front'.
