{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}
This '''list of preserved historic blast furnaces''' contains decommissioned [[blast furnace]]s, of which substantial remains survive. The furnaces are preserved in a [[park]] or museum, or as a site otherwise open to visitors, or intended to become such.

While pre-20th-century blast furnaces already have a long history of monument preservation, the perception of 20th century mass production blast furnace installations as [[industrial heritage]] is a comparably new trend. For a long time, it has been normal procedure for such a blast furnace to be demolished after being decommissioned and either be replaced with a newer, improved one, or to have the entire site demolished to make room for follow-up use of the area. It has only been in recent years{{When|date=January 2011}} that numerous countries have realized the value of blast furnaces as a part of their [[industrial history]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Historically, the first such blast furnace not to be demolished stands in [[Starachowice]], [[Poland]] (decommissioned in 1968), followed by the last blast furnace of Yahata Steel Works in [[Yahatahigashi-ku, Kitakyūshū]], [[Japan]] (decommissioned in 1972) and the "Carrie Furnaces" in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania|Homestead]], [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]] (decommissioned in 1978). One of the two blast furnaces in [[Neunkirchen, Saarland|Neunkirchen]] in [[Germany]] (decommissioned in 1982) was the first blast furnace worldwide to be not just preserved, but actively refurbished for the purpose of preservation.

For 20th-century mass production blast furnaces, the degree of accurate preservation versus integration into new structures, or even re-purposing, differs between the various sites. Colorful illumination installations at night are common.

|Spiš
|Jakubany
|Jakubany (49°13’02’’N; 20°40’56’’E),  Jakubján, Szépesjakobfalva, Jakobsau, Spiš county. The first director of copper smeltery “Nicolaus” in Slovinky near Krompachy Probstner leased and  bought after the time primarily exchequer  ironworks with Slovak furnace (since 1760) and blast furnace (since 1776)  in 1820s. The pig iron was refined in three hearts. The part of the plant was hammer in near Nová Ľubovňa and the rolling mill in Jakubany since 1855. The work  became extinct in the 1860s.  The blast furnace (inaccessible in consequence of  irregular ownerships between  state and  restitutors at the present time) is in  fairish condition.

The furnace was used to [[Smelting|smelt]] locally mined iron ore; the resulting [[Pig iron|iron pigs]] were transported to [[Elizabethtown, Illinois]], where they were shipped elsewhere along the [[Ohio River]].  The surrounding area is a picnic site and  visitor information center narrating the history of the furnace and Illinois' iron industry.

==List of preserved industrial mass production blast furnaces around the world==
These installations all date from the 20th century. They are supported by outer frames made of metal, were supplied with pre-heated blast air from external Cowper stoves, were typically part of large industrial compounds where, at one point, multiple blast furnaces were typically standing and operating side by side for efficiency reasons, raw materials were delivered by external elevating mechanisms, and the entire site was accessible by [[Freight rail transport|freight trains]] which delivered the raw materials and carried off the freshly smelted [[pig iron]] in [[Ladle (metallurgy)|ladles]].

In many cases, the preserved sites have been deliberately stripped down to minimize maintenance costs; namely, some blast furnaces and related installations have been demolished. The goal was to only retain one or two blast furnaces including the relevant related installations (such as Cowper stoves, cast house, winch house etc.), which are considered sufficient to explain the blast furnace process and all related functions to visitors.

The first such decommissioned blast furnace that wasn't demolished and has been preserved to this very day stands in [[Starachowice]], [[Poland]], and has ceased operation as early as 1968.
