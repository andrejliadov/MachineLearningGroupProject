'''Conjectural history''' is a type of [[historiography]] isolated in the 1790s by [[Dugald Stewart]], who termed it "theoretical or conjectural history", as prevalent in the historians and early social scientists of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. As Stewart saw it, such history makes space for speculation about causes of events, by postulating natural causes that could have had such an effect. His concept was to be identified closely with the French terminology ''histoire raisonnée'', and the usage of "natural history" by [[David Hume]] in his work ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]''. It was related to "philosophical history", a broader-based kind of historical theorising, but concentrated on the early history of man in a type of [[rational reconstruction]] that had little contact with evidence.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects : With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith': With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&pg=PA293|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=293}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon MacIntyre|title=Dugald Stewart: The Pride and Ornament of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOFVh-i3Z04C&pg=PA253|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-903900-34-5|page=253}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Palmeri|title=Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665–1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZrp6ZZQmiYC&pg=PA232|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2003|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-829-0|pages=231–2}}</ref>

Such conjectural history was the antithesis of the [[narrative history]] being written at the time by [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]].

==Early Modern context==
There was nothing new in the idea of stages of society on its own, but social thinking itself was changing in [[Early Modern Europe]], particularly on [[civil society]] in its components, [[civility]] and "society".

===Models and the "savage"===
{{main article|Noble savage}}
Hodgen comments, in a chapter ''From Hierarchy to History'', on the widespread use of "conjectural series" for historical explanation in the Early Modern period. The [[great chain of being]] was a static idea. "Stage series" had roots in classical thought, but might be associated with cyclic models, or incorporate ideas of decline with those of progress. She writes that in time

<blockquote>...&nbsp;it seems certain that hierarchical ideas, temporalized to suit the needs of the conjectural historian of culture, were mixed with historical assumptions concerning the savage as a conjectural first member of these conjectural series.<ref>Hodgen, p. 467.</ref> </blockquote>

===Early Modern natural history===
While the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] was a classical Roman encyclopedic work, "natural history" had several different meanings in the Early Modern period. The one relevant in this article is the [[Baconian natural history]], i.e. a systematic collection of observable information on natural phenomena. A natural history did not belong to [[natural philosophy]], which was theoretical.<ref>{{cite book|author1=G. N. Cantor|author3=J. R. R. Christie|author2=M. J. S. Hodge, R. C. Olby|title=Companion to the History of Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC&pg=PT260|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=6 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-97751-2|page=260}}</ref>

===''Histoire raisonnée''===
The ''histoire raisonnée'' was a genre of historical writing developed in France in the 17th century, with concerns for the individual in social context, and the description of culture and customs as integral to history. It grew out of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] historiography with its close relationship to classical Roman and Greek models, but brought to the surface social matters, in particular as they could explain the motivations of individuals. With [[Géraud de Cordemoy]] there came an interest in causality as playing a part in historical movement, as distinct from the humanist acceptance of personal fates being subject to [[Fortuna|Fortune]].<ref>Leffler, pp. 223–9.</ref>

===Stadial history===
Contemporary terminology is '''stadial history''', or in other words the discussion of stages of society by theoretical means (see [[sociocultural evolution#Stadial theory]]). Stadial theory as an innovation is attributed to the jurist [[Samuel Pufendorf]].<ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004">{{cite book|author1=Martin Fitzpatrick|author2=Peter Jones|author3=Christa Knellwolf|author4=Iain McCalman|title=Enlightenment World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSFy4wZ6Bz0C&pg=PT258|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=22 July 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-60784-6|pages=258–9}}</ref> [[Grotius]] had already used conjectural history to discuss [[Aquinas]] on [[private property]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Istvan Hont|title=Jealousy Of Trade: International Competition and the Nation State in Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHu6kBLV4CUC&pg=PA422|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01038-3|pages=422–3}}</ref>

Some basic conjectural history on [[human civilization]] was therefore discussed in the 17th century. Later [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] rejected the concept of the [[state of nature]], and with [[Count Buffon]] debated the rise of civilization. The Scottish contribution then took the theory to a new level, with its [[anthropocentrism]] and detailed explanations of human manipulation of nature.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nathaniel Wolloch|title=History and Nature in the Enlightenment: Praise of the Mastery of Nature in Eighteenth-Century Historical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWYe2DZbYskC&pg=PA92|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 May 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2115-3|pages=92–4}}</ref> It laid emphasis on a typical society at its beginnings, regarding evidence from contemporary reports (particularly of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]) as valid.<ref>Hopfl, pp. 24–5.</ref>

==Conjectural histories of language and writing==
Adam Smith in lectures on rhetoric, given from 1748,<ref>{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|page=80|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}</ref> advanced a speculative history of language; he wrote that he had been prompted by a 1747 work of [[Gabriel Girard (priest)|Gabriel Girard]]. He was then interested in our awareness of literary style.<ref>{{cite book|title=Adam Smith: The Rhetoric of Propriety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_MODA0NVjQC&pg=PA83|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8262-9|page=83|year=2006}}</ref> This is the example that Dugald Stewart took up in coining the phrase "conjectural history". Elements would have been recognised at the time as drawing on the Bible, and in classical literature [[Lucretius]]; it is now considered Smith was influenced by [[Montesquieu]] on law and government. The theory on language and its typology over time has been seen as typical of Smith's historical approach; and even the foundation of his later well-known work on [[political economy]]. Caveats have also been entered, by David Raphael: it cannot be stretched to Smith's [[history of astronomy]]; and the term can be seen as a misnomer.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|pages=85–7|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon Bigelow|title=Fiction, Famine, and the Rise of Economics in Victorian Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BLIwbbcbuKcC&pg=PA50|date=20 November 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44085-1|page=50}}</ref>

Monboddo, on the other hand, wrote at length a conjectural history of language because he emphasised the history of [[manners]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://archive.org/details/societysentiment0000phil|url-access=registration|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/societysentiment0000phil/page/151 151]}}</ref> [[William Warburton]] had proposed a stadial conjectural history of writing in his ''[[Divine Legation of Moses]]'', a work supporting [[biblical authority]], around 1740. It was taken up in France after the translation in ''[[Essai sur les hiéroglyphes des Égyptiens]]''. Where writing moved from [[pictogram]]s to [[alphabet]]s, he saw language use as having moved analogously from [[gesture]]s to forms and figures of speech.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra|title=How to Write the History of the New World: Histories, Epistemologies, and Identities in the Eighteenth-century Atlantic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzIGYxOC1oUC&pg=PA109|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4693-9|pages=109–111}}</ref>

==The four stages theory==
The term "conjectural history" was not generally accepted in Stewart's time.<ref name="O'Brien">{{cite book|author=Karen O'Brien|title=Narratives of Enlightenment: Cosmopolitan History from Voltaire to Gibbon|url=https://archive.org/details/narrativesofenli0000obri|url-access=registration|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=5 June 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-46533-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/narrativesofenli0000obri/page/132 132]–3}}</ref> There was an orthodox '''four stages theory''' of society, the stages being:

# [[hunter-gatherer|hunting]];
# [[pasturage]];
# [[agriculture]]; and 
# [[commerce]].

This ladder-like ordering was taken to be a strict, linear progression, or [[unilineal evolution]]. Some [[economic determinism]] applied, in the sense that the baseline of subsistence was assumed to have a serious effect on social matters. The stages were supposed to represent progress on a moral level, as well as that of economic complexity. French as well as Scottish Enlightenment writers subscribed to such a pattern.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Rosen|title=On Voluntary Servitude: False Consciousness and the Theory of Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBBEWlGOhSMC&pg=PA117|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-63779-5|page=117}}</ref>

The invention of this type of theory (three or four stages) is attributed to a number of European writers from the 1750s onwards, such as Adam Smith, [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Ter Ellingson|title=The Myth of the Noble Savage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqE3IhkeWToC&pg=PA159|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=17 December 2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92592-2|page=159}}</ref> In the Scottish context it appears in works from 1758 by [[David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes|David Dalrymple]] and [[Lord Kames]]; it has been argued that their source was the Edinburgh lectures of Smith on [[jurisprudence]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge Companion to Adam Smith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6bhhU3iyhIC&pg=PA225|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=6 March 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77924-1|page=225 note 18}}</ref> In France it was published at much the same time, also, by [[Claude Pierre Goujet]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], and [[François Quesnay]].<ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004"/> Smith's "[[natural progress of opulence]]" is a closely related theory.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Noggle|title=The Temporality of Taste in Eighteenth-Century British Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUT8187WaxkC&pg=PA165|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=9 February 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964243-4|page=165}}</ref>

==Representative works==
Besides Adam Smith, prominent Scottish authors in the field of conjectural history included [[Adam Ferguson]], David Hume, Lord Kames, [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], and [[Lord Monboddo]], writing from the later 1750s to later 1770s.<ref>{{cite book |author=William Zachs |title=Without Regard to Good Manners: A biography of Gilbert Stuart (1743–1786) |year=1992 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-0319-0 |page=12}}</ref> Smith, Kames and Millar were content to adhere to the four stage theory.<ref>{{cite book|author=Porscha Fermanis|title=John Keats and the Ideas of the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhfJN8IzDOgC&pg=PA67|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3780-5|page=67}}</ref> Monboddo's stadial history was more complex, and very much more controversial.

===Lord Kames, ''Sketches of the History of Man'' (1774)===
Kames has been called the leader of Scottish conjectural history, and had objections he expressed in correspondence to both Rousseau and the approach of [[Montesquieu]], as reducing the role of human nature, which he thought was not a constant but the goal of the investigation.<ref name="Carhart2007"/> The connection was that conjectural history was to be used as a framework of a discussion of [[natural law]].<ref name="O'Brien"/> In writing to [[Basel]] in search of a suitable opponent to Rousseau, Kames prompted a work from [[Isaak Iselin]], ''Ueber die Geschichte der Menschheit'' (1764), which is also a conjectural history.<ref name="Carhart2007"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6ExSHrknywC&pg=PA1140|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86743-6|page=1140 note 62}}</ref>

==Later developments==

===The tradition comes to an end===
Mainstream conjectural and philosophical history, in the Scottish style, hardly survived as a living tradition into the 1790s. Works went out of print; younger authors such as [[John Adams (writer)|John Adams]], [[William Alexander (physician)|William Alexander]] and [[John Logan (minister)|John Logan]] failed to renew the ideas, with Alexander's ''History of Women'' (1779) being criticised as shallow.<ref name="Broich">{{cite book|author=Ulrich Broich|title=Reactions to Revolutions: The 1790s and Their Aftermath|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLvLPSwF-bIC&pg=PA232|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=2007|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7427-8|pages=232–3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://archive.org/details/societysentiment0000phil|url-access=registration|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/societysentiment0000phil/page/163 163]}}</ref> Dugald Stewart's formulation of conjectural history was published in 1794, in his ''Account'' of Adam Smith for the ''Transactions'' of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects: With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&pg=PA268|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=268}}</ref> The question has been raised as to Stewart's intention then in describing the tradition in that way, and [[John Burrow]] has argued that he wished to dissociate Smith from political radicalism.<ref name="Burrow1966">{{cite book|author=John Wyon Burrow|title=Evolution and Society: A Study in Victorian Social Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUM4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA54|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=1966|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-04393-9|page=54}}</ref>

The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Second Edition|second edition]] but particularly in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Third Edition|third edition]] (1797), attacked the premises of conjectural history from a biblical angle. In the second edition [[James Tytler]] opposed the polygenist approach of Kames. The third edition, under the editorship of [[George Gleig]], featured "Savage" as a new topic, and expanded articles "Society" and "Moral philosophy". Cross-referenced to theological and biblical topics, and to articles by [[David Doig]] who had answered Kames with ''Two Letters on the Savage State'' from 1775/6, these articles in particular argued the orthodox Christian case. [[Robert Heron (writer)|Robert Heron]] contributed to the article "Society", and took aim at the four stages theory, claiming polygenism followed from it (in contradiction to the Bible). Further, the assumption of a baseline state of savagery also seemed to Heron to be implicated with polygenism; and he with Doig attacked the assumption as echoing [[Lucretius]] and [[Democritus]], and godless materialist [[spontaneous generation]] of humankind, implicit in the whole idea of conjectural history.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aa.vv.|title=Storia della Storiografia.

===Relationship to antiquarianism===
Conjectural argument had a bad name in 18th century British [[antiquarian]] circles. An austere and sceptical approach centred on facts, as adopted by [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Richard Gough]] and [[James Douglas (antiquary)|James Douglas]], was favoured in the second half of the century.<ref name="Sweet">Sweet, pp. 20–3.</ref> On the other hand, the interpretations of the stadial theory were quite welcome, and while popularised by the Scottish school, did not seem innovative in the sense of a break with Early Modern historiography, and concerns with natural law and [[civic humanism]]. The urban history of [[John Trussel]] was a precursor. The discussion of the breakdown of the [[feudal system]] was a topic of considerable antiquarian interest.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&pg=PA143|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–8}}</ref> The stadial history was embraced by [[Thomas Pownall]].<ref name="Sweet"/>

===Conjectural history of peoples===
[[Charles Athanase Walckenaer]] in 1798 took up the four stage theory, augmented to five stages, by dividing "hunting" into "gathering" followed by a pure hunting stage. This was an effort to classify peoples of the world by development.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin S. Staum|title=Labeling People: French Scholars on Society, Race, and Empire, 1815–1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJfz4ptLD0kC&pg=PA13|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=20 August 2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-7124-2|pages=13–4}}</ref> Early anthropology carried into the 19th century assumptions about the search for origins of civilisation, and unilineal evolution, as appropriate tools for investigating societies. It was widely assumed, further, that current "peoples" were a window into the past. These approaches were seen in [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. Eventually, in the 20th century, field work and [[structural functionalism]] led to a rejection of the whole paradigm.<ref>{{cite book|author=Giorgio Ausenda|title=After Empire: Towards an Ethnology of Europe's Barbarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqvhYaHrryEC&pg=PA96|accessdate=5 March 2013|date=1 February 2003|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=978-0-85115-853-2|pages=96–7}}</ref>
