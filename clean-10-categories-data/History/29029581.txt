{{short description|A Mesozoic land mass separated from Laramidia to the west by the Western Interior Seaway}}
[[File:Cretaceous seaway.png|thumb|Appalachia, circa 100 mya]]

During most of the [[Late Cretaceous]] (100.5 to 66 million years ago) the eastern half of [[North America]] formed '''Appalachia''' (named for the [[Appalachian Mountains]]), an island land mass separated from [[Laramidia]] to the west by the [[Western Interior Seaway]]. This seaway had split North America into two massive landmasses due to a multitude of factors such as tectonism and sea-level fluctuations for nearly 40 million years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nielsen |first1=Karsten Schjødt |last2=Schröder-Adams |first2=Claudia J. |last3=Leckie |first3=Dale A. |last4=Haggart |first4=James W. |last5=Elberdak |first5=Khalifa |title=Turonian to Santonian paleoenvironmental changes in the Cretaceous Western Interior Sea: The Carlile and Niobrara formations in southern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan, Canada |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |date=December 2008 |volume=270 |issue=1–2 |pages=64–91 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.08.018 |bibcode=2008PPP...270...64N }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bertog |first1=Janet |title=Stratigraphy of the Lower Pierre Shale (Campanian): Implications for the Tectonic and Eustatic Controls on Facies Distributions |journal=Journal of Geological Research |date=2010 |volume=2010 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.1155/2010/910243 |doi-access=free }}</ref> The seaway eventually expanded, divided across [[the Dakotas]], and by the end of the Cretaceous,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Erickson |first1=J.

==Geography==

Appalachia stretched from [[Quebec]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] all the way down to the [[Eastern United States]] and west to the [[Midwestern United States]]. Fossils found in these regions indicate that the area was covered in [[coastal plain]]s and [[Alluvial plain|coastal lowlands]] during the Cretaceous period.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brownstein |first1=Chase D. |title=The biogeography and ecology of the Cretaceous non-avian dinosaurs of Appalachia |journal= Palaeontologia Electronica|volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=1–56 |date=February 2018 |doi=10.26879/801 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Some scientists have proposed the idea that an archipelago of islands had formed during the time that the Western Interior Seaway had divided Laramidia and Appalachia apart until the near end of the Cretaceous. This would allow dinosaurs to migrate into the Gulf Coast and why it would possibly explain why there are some noticeable distinctions with the fauna in the two assemblages of Appalachia. For instance, the southeastern assemblage (which consists of the Carolinas and the Gulf Coast sites) has some tyrannosauroids such as ''Appalachiosaurus'', some hadrosauroids such as ''Eotrachodon'' and ''Lophorhothon'', nodosaurs, dromaeosaurs, and new leptoceratopsian while the northern assemblage (which consists of New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland) has some tyrannosauroids such as ''Dryptosaurus'', hadrosauroids such as ''Hadrosaurus'', smaller theropods, and a possible [[lambeosaur]] in the area.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schwimmer |first1=David R. |title=Was There a Southeastern Dinosaur Province in the Late Cretaceous? |journal=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs |date=1 April 2016 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=22–3 |doi=10.1130/abs/2016SE-271634 }}</ref>

==Range==

Vertebrate fossils have been found along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Seaboard]] as well as other states like Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Minnesota. Parts of Canada that were a part of Appalachia during the Cretaceous include, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nunavut, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=King Jr. |first1=David T. |title=Late Cretaceous Dinosaurs of the Southeastern United States |url=http://www.auburn.edu/~kingdat/dinosaur_webpage.htm |website=auburn.edu |publisher=Auburn University |access-date=9 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://webhome.auburn.edu/~kingdat/dino_fig_1.jpg}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://webhome.auburn.edu/~kingdat/dino_fig_2.jpg}}</ref>

==Fauna==

===Dinosaurs===
From the Cenomanian to the Maastrichtian, Appalachia was inhabited by various groups of dinosaurs including, [[Hadrosauroidea|hadrosauroids]], [[Hadrosauridae|hadrosaurs]], [[Nodosauridae|nodosaurs]], [[Leptoceratopsidae|leptoceratopsians]], [[Ornithopoda|indeterminate ornithopods]], [[Tyrannosauroidea|tyrannosauroids]], [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs]], [[Ornithomimidae|ornithomimids]], and [[Maniraptora|indeterminate maniraptors]] lived in the area. There is also fossil evidence of possible [[Chasmosaurinae|chasmosaurs]], [[Lambeosaurinae|lambeosaurs]], [[Sauropodomorpha|sauropods]], [[Allosauroidea|allosaurs]], [[Caenagnathidae|caenagnathids]], and [[Troodontidae|troodontids]] that might have inhabited the area.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Thomas |title=New Data on Mid- Cretaceous Ecosystems and Faunal Diversity in Appalachia: Insights from the Woodbine Formation (Cenomanian) of North Texas |journal=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs |date=13 March 2017 |volume=49 |issue=1 |doi=10.1130/abs/2017SC-289203 }}</ref><ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite journal |last1=Drumheller |first1=Stephanie K. |title=Fleshing Out a Lost World: Mid-Cretaceous Diversity in Appalachia with Insights from the Arlington Archosaur Site |journal=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs |date=13 April 2018 |volume=50 |issue=3 |doi=10.1130/abs/2018SE-312397 }}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brownstein |first1=Chase D. |title=A Tyrannosauroid Metatarsus from the Merchantville Formation of New Jersey increases the diversity of nonTyrannosaurid Tyrannosauroids on Appalachia |journal=PeerJ |date=November 2017 |volume=5 |issue=e4123 |pages=e4123 |doi=10.7717/peerj.4123 |pmid=29204326 |pmc=5712462 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=King |first1=James L. |title=DINOSAURIAN FAUNA OF THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES |journal=Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs |date=18 October 2009 |volume=41 |issue=7 |page=106 |url=https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2009AM/finalprogram/abstract_164563.htm |access-date=16 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200423132038/https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2009AM/finalprogram/abstract_164563.htm |archive-date=23 April 2020 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Tyrannosaurs====
In Late Cretaceous North America, the dominant predators were the [[Tyrannosauroidea|tyrannosaurs]], huge predatory [[Theropoda|theropods]] with proportionately massive heads built for ripping flesh from their prey. Tyrannosaurs were the dominant predators in Appalachia too, but rather than the massive [[Tyrannosauridae]], like ''[[Gorgosaurus]]'', ''[[Albertosaurus]]'' and ''[[Lythronax]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Loewen|first1=Mark A.|last2=Irmis|first2=Randall B.|last3=Setrich|first3=Joseph J.

Laurel Formation]] and [[Merchantville Formation]] respectively, have revealed that the primitive tyrannosauroids were much more diverse than expected, and some of them grew to lengths of 8 to 9 meters long, making them around the same size as some of the more advanced tyrannosaurs found in Laramidia.<ref name=Brownstein2018>{{cite journal |last1=Brownstein |first1=Chase |title=LARGE BASAL TYRANNOSAUROIDS FROM THE MAASTRICHTIAN AND TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATE DIVERSITY IN THE SHADOW OF THE K-PG EXTINCTION |journal=The Mosasaur |date=December 2018 |volume=X |pages=105–110 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329687124 |access-date=7 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brownstein |first1=Chase |title=A tyrannosauroid metatarsus from the Merchantville Formation of Delaware increases the diversity of non-tyrannosaurid tyrannosauroids on Appalachia |journal=PeerJ |date=30 November 2017 |volume=5 |issue=e4123 |pages=e4123 |doi=10.7717/peerj.4123 |pmid=29204326 |pmc=5712462 }}</ref> Fossils in Cenomanian deposits further indicate tyrannosauroids had been a constant presence in Appalachia since the middle cretaceous.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.3374/014.058.0210|title = A Tyrannosauroid from the Lower Cenomanian of New Jersey and Its Evolutionary and Biogeographic Implications|journal = Bulletin of the Peabody Museum of Natural History|volume = 59|pages = 95–105|year = 2018|last1 = Brownstein|first1 = Chase Doran|s2cid = 90633156}}</ref>

====Dromaeosaurs====
The dryptosaurs weren't the only predatory dinosaurs in Appalachia. Indeterminate [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaur]] fossils, possibly belonging to [[Velociraptorinae]] and [[Saurornitholestinae]], and teeth, most closely matching those of ''[[Saurornitholestes]]'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kiernan|first1=Caitlin R.|last2=Schwimmeri|first2=David R.|title=First Record of a Velociraptorine Theropod (Tetanurae, Dromaeosauridae) from the Eastern Gulf Coastal United States|pages=89–93|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277954680|journal=The Mosasaur|volume= 7|access-date=7 May 2004|date=January 2004}}</ref> have also been unearthed in Appalachia as well; mostly in the southern states like Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Westfall|first1=Aundrea|title=Dromaeosaurs|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-3684|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|publisher=Encyclopedia of Alabama|access-date=18 May 2016}}</ref> Finds from the Campanian Tar Heel Formation in North Carolina indicate that there may have been dromaeosaurids of considerable size; intermediate between genera such as ''Saurornitholestes'' and ''[[Dakotaraptor]]''.

====Ornithomimids====
Various [[Ornithomimidae|ornithomimid]] bones, such as ''[[Coelosaurus antiquus|Coelosaurus]]'', have also been reported from Appalachia from Missouri, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and as far north in states like Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware, but it is now believed that some of these are the bones of juvenile dryptosaurs while others belong to various undescribed species of ornithomimids. As of 2019, no distinct species of ornithomimosaurs have been identified yet, mostly due to the fact that no complete skeleton has been unearthed yet. However, it can be assumed that most of them were around the same size of their Laramidian relatives, though there is one specimen that could have reached a large size similar ''[[Gallimimus]]'' or ''[[Beishanlong]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baird | first1 = D. | last2 = Horner | first2 = J. | year = 1979 | title = Cretaceous dinosaurs of North Carolina | journal = Brimleyana | volume = 2 | pages = 1–28 }}</ref><ref name="brownstein">{{cite journal | last1 = Brownstein | first1 = C.D. | title = Theropod specimens from the Navesink Formation and their implications for the Diversity and Biogeography of Ornithomimosaurs and Tyrannosauroids on Appalachia | journal = PeerJ Preprints | volume = 5 | page = e3105v1 | doi = 10.7287/peerj.preprints.3105v1 | date = 2017-07-24 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="Geological Society of America"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brownstein |first1=Chase Doran |title=Theropod specimens from the Navesink Formation and their implications for the Diversity and Biogeography of Ornithomimosaurs and Tyrannosauroids on Appalachia |journal=PeerJ Preprints |date=24 July 2017 |volume=e3105v1 |url=https://peerj.com/preprints/3105/ |access-date=23 December 2019}}</ref>

====Lambeosaurs====
Indeterminate [[lambeosaurinae]] remains, mostly similar to ''[[Corythosaurus]]'', have been reported from New Jersey's [[Navesink Formation]], [[Bylot Island]] and [[Nova Scotia, Canada]]. It cannot yet be explained how lambeosaurines might have reached Appalachia though some have theorized that a land bridge must have formed sometime during the [[Campanian]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chase|title=A response to The Tetrapod Zoology Podcast #45: Why Lambeosaurines did, in fact, persist into the Maastrichtian|url=https://thetetanuraeguy.wordpress.com/2015/07/30/a-response-to-the-tetrapod-zoology-podcast-45-why-lambeosaurines-did-in-fact-persist-into-the-maastrichtian/|website=An Odyssey of Time|publisher=Anonymous|access-date=30 July 2015|date=2015-07-30}}</ref>

====Nodosaurs====
The [[Nodosauridae|nodosaurids]], a group of large, herbivorous [[Ankylosauria|armored dinosaur]]s resembling [[armadillo]]s, are another testament to Appalachia's difference from Laramidia. During the early Cretaceous, the nodosaurids prospered and were one of the most widespread dinosaurs throughout North America. However, by the latest Cretaceous, nodosaurids were scarce in western North America,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bakker|first1=Robert T.|title=Review of the Late Cretaceous nodosauroid Dinosauria: Denversaurus schlessmani, a new armor-plated dinosaur from the Latest Cretaceous of South Dakota, the last survivor of the nodosaurians, with comments on Stegosaur-Nodosaur relationships|journal=Hunteria|date=1988|volume=1|issue=3|pages=1–23}}</ref> limited to forms like ''[[Edmontonia]]'', ''[[Denversaurus]]'' and ''[[Panoplosaurus]]''; perhaps due to competition from the [[ankylosauridae]]; though they did thrive in isolation, most notably in Appalachia, as mentioned earlier and in the case of ''[[Struthiosaurus]]'',<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Garcia | first1 = G. | last2 = Pereda-Suberbiola | first2 = X. | year = 2003 | title = A new species of ''Struthiosaurus'' (Dinosauria: Ankylosauria) from the Upper Cretaceous of Villeveyrac (southern France) | journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 156–165 | doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2003)23[156:ansosd]2.0.co;2}}</ref> Europe as well. Nodosaurid [[scute]]s have been commonly found in eastern North America, while fossil specimens are very rare. Often the findings are not diagnostic enough to identify the species, but the remains attest to a greater number of these armored dinosaurs in Appalachia.

While leptoceratopsid remains, the few that have been discovered in recent years, have been unearthed in the southern part of Appalachia, they appear to be completely absent from the northern part of Appalachia, states like New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland.

Schwimmer, that there was a possible providence during the Late Cretaceous.<ref>{{cite web|last1=David R.|first1=Schwimmer|title=Was There a Southeastern Dinosaur Province in the Late Cretaceous?|url=https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2016SE/webprogram/Paper271634.html|website=1 April 2016|publisher=Geological Society of America|access-date=12 September 2016}}</ref> It is not completely understood how the leptoceratopsians were able to reach Appalachia, however, the most commonly accepted theory was that they [[Island hopping|island hopped]] during the time that the Western Interior Seaway split the North American continent into two different land masses in a way that some species of leptoceratopsids, most notably ''[[Ajkaceratops]]'', were able to reach Europe.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Osi |first1=Attila |last2=Butler |first2=Richard J. |last3=Weishampel |first3=David B. |title=A Late Cretaceous ceratopsian dinosaur from Europe with Asian affinities |journal=Nature |date=27 May 2010 |volume=465 |issue=7297 |pages=466–468 |doi=10.1038/nature09019 |pmid=20505726 |bibcode=2010Natur.465..466O |s2cid=205220451 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=LINDGREN |first1=JOHAN |title=The First Neoceratopsian Dinosaur Remains from Europe |last2=CURRIE |first2=PHILIP J. |last3=SIVERSON |first3=MIKAEL |last4=REESS |first4=JAN |last5=LINDGREN |first5=FILIP |journal=Palaeontology |date=2007 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=929–937 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2007.00690.x }}</ref> It should also be noted that there is a distinct difference with how the leptoceratopsians evolved in Appalachia and Laramida.

===Non-dinosaur herpetofauna===

====Amphibians====
Through the [[Ellisdale Fossil Site]], a good picture of Appalachia's non-dinosaurian fauna is present. Amidst [[lissamphibia]]ns, there is evidence for [[Sirenidae|sirenids]] (including the large ''[[Habrosaurus]]''), the batrachosauroidid salamander ''[[Parrisia]]'', [[Hylidae|hylids]], possible representatives of ''[[Eopelobates]]'' and ''[[Discoglossus]]'', showing close similarities to European faunas, but aside from ''[[Habrosaurus]]'' (which is also found on Laramidia) there is a high degree of endemism, suggesting no interchanges with other landmasses throughout the Late Cretaceous.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Le Loeuff | first1 = J | year = 1991 | title = The Campano-Maastrichtian vertebrate faunas of southern Europe and their relationship with other faunas in the world; paleobiogeographic implications | journal = Cretaceous Res. | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 93–114 | doi = 10.1016/s0195-6671(05)80019-9 }}</ref>

====Lizards====
There is also a high degree of endemism in regards to its reptilian fauna: among squamates, the [[Teiidae|teiid]] Prototeius is exclusive to the landmass, and native representatives of [[Iguanidae]], [[Helodermatidae]], and [[Necrosauridae]].

====Turtles====
Amidst [[turtle]]s, which are rather common finds in Appalachia, ''[[Adocus]]'', ''[[Apalone]]'', and ''[[Bothremydidae|Bothremys]]'' are well represented, the latter in particular more common in Appalachian sites than Laramidian ones.

====Crocodiles====
Crocodiles were rather abundant in Appalachia with nine local [[crocodilian]] genera belonging to several confirmed families, with the possibility of much more undiscovered crocodiles waiting to be unearthed.

===Marine life===

Such examples of fossil sites that have preserved the remains of marine life from that period include the Niobrara Formation, the Demopolis Chalk Formation, and the Mooreville Chalk Formation are just a few examples of the fossil sites that have successfully preserved the skeletal remains of various marine creatures from the Cretaceous.<ref>{{cite web |title=OCEANS OF KANSAS PALEONTOLOGY Fossils from the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Sea |url=http://oceansofkansas.com/ |access-date=12 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Everhart |first1=Mike |title=A Field Guide to Fossils of the Smoky Hill Chalk Part 2: Sharks and Bony Fish |url=http://oceansofkansas.com/FieldGuide2.html |website=Oceans of Kansas |access-date=12 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Everhart |first1=Mike |title=A Field Guide to the Smoky Hill Chalk Part 1: Invertebrates |url=http://oceansofkansas.com/FieldGuide1.html |website=Oceans of Kansas |access-date=12 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Everhart |first1=Mike |title=A Field Guide to Fossils of the Smoky Hill Chalk Part 3: Marine Reptiles |url=http://oceansofkansas.com/FieldGuide3.html |website=Oceans of Kansas |access-date=12 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Everhart |first1=Mike |title=A Field Guide to Fossils of the Smoky Hill Chalk Part 4: Pteranodons, Birds, and Dinosaurs |url=http://oceansofkansas.com/FieldGuide4.html |website=Oceans of Kansas |access-date=12 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Everhart |first1=Mike |title=A Field Guide to Fossils of the Smoky Hill Chalk Part 5: Coprolites, pearls, fossilized wood and other remains. |url=http://oceansofkansas.com/FieldGuide5.html |website=Oceans of Kansas |access-date=12 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Everhart |first1=Mike |title=M.

=== Arthropods ===
Many species of arthropods are known from the Turonian aged [[New Jersey amber]], situated on the Atlantic coast of Appalachia. Arthropods are also known from the Cenomanian aged [[Redmond Formation]] of Labrador, Canada.

==Flora==
While the fossil sites from the southern part in Appalachia, places like Alabama and the Carolinas, have a very scant amount of Cretaceous plant fossils with the exception of Georgia, the northern parts of Appalachia, such as New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware have a much better record in terms of plant species being unearthed there, especially with fossils sites like the [[Ellisdale Fossil Site]], and have given us a better glimpse into a forgotten world. In the Ellisdae Fossil Site, excavations have revealed that plants like ''[[Picea]]'', ''[[Metasequoia]]'', ''[[Liriodendron]]'', and possibly ''[[Rhizophora]]'' inhabited the region during the late Cretaceous period, implying that the environment during that time period was a coastal forest with a few types of marine environments as well including [[Estuary|estuarine]], [[lagoon]]al, marine, and terrestrial. Plant fossils found in neighboring states such as Delaware and Maryland have revealed that ''[[fern]]s'', ''[[gymnosperm]]s'', and ''[[Flowering plant|angiosperms]]'' did indeed inhabit the area.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lauginiger |first1=Edward M. |title=Cretaceous Fossils from the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal |journal=Delaware Geological Survey |date=September 1988 |pages=61 |url=https://www.dgs.udel.edu/sites/default/files/publications/SP18.pdf}}</ref> Angiosperm fossils were unearthed in the Dakota Formation in Nebraska.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lidgard |first1=Scott |last2=Crane |first2=Peter R. |title=Angiosperm Diversification and Cretaceous Floristic Trends: A Comparison of Palynofloras and Leaf Macrofloras |journal=Paleobiology |date=Winter 1990 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=77–93 |jstor=2400934 |doi=10.1017/S009483730000974X }}</ref> As mentioned earlier, Georgia has a rich fossil record of plant life dating back to the Cretaceous.
