{{short description|Overview of historical claims of the Book of Mormon}}
{{Book of Mormon}}
Many members of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] believe that the Book of Mormon is historically accurate.  Most, but not all, Mormons hold the book's connection to ancient American history as an article of their faith. This view finds no acceptance outside of Mormonism in the broader scientific community.<ref name="Duffy 2004 37">{{Harvnb|Duffy|2004|p=37}}</ref><ref>Simon G. Southerton. 2004. ''Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books).</ref>  Mormon [[Apologetics|apologists]] have proposed multiple theories to explain apparent inconsistencies with the archaeological, genetic, linguistic and other records.

The Book of Mormon purports to give an account of two civilizations formed by families who migrated to the [[Americas]]. One group of families came from Jerusalem in 600 BC and afterward separated into two nations, known as the [[Nephite]]s and the [[Lamanites]]. Another group came much earlier, when God confounded the tongues at the [[Tower of Babel]]; that group is known as the [[Jaredite]]s. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites. Latter Day Saints believe that Lamanites are among the ancestors of the Native Americans.

==Latter Day Saint views==
The dominant and widely accepted view among Latter Day Saints is that the Book of Mormon is a true and accurate account of these ancient American civilizations whose religious history it documents. [[Joseph Smith]], whom most Latter Day Saints believe to have translated the work, stated, "I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book."<ref name="LDS BoM Intro">[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/introduction/1 Introduction], [[Book of Mormon]], LDS Church (2013)</ref> Unresolved issues of the book's historicity and the lack of supporting archaeological evidence have led some adherents to adopt the position that the Book of Mormon may have been the creation of Smith, but that it was nevertheless divinely inspired.<ref>{{citation |author-link= Grant H.

==Archaeology==
{{Main|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon}}
Discussion regarding the historicity of the Book of Mormon often focuses on [[archaeology|archaeological]] issues, some of which relate to the large size and the long time span of the civilizations mentioned in the book. A contemporary Mormon view is that these civilizations rose and fell in [[Mesoamerica]].<ref name=autogenerated2>{{citation |title= Sacred Sites: Searching for Book of Mormon Lands |first= Joseph L. |last= Allen |year= 2003 |place= American Fork, Utah |publisher= [[Covenant Communications]] |isbn= 978-1591562726 |oclc= 54031905 }}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref> Civilizations of their magnitude and duration would be expected to leave extensive archaeological records.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Crusading against straw men: an alternative view of alternative archaeologies: response to Holtorf (2005)|first1=Garrett G.|last1=Fagan|first2=Kenneth L.|last2=Feder|date=1 December 2006|journal=World Archaeology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=718–729|doi=10.1080/00438240600963528}}</ref> Several Mesoamerican civilizations did exist in the time period covered by the Book of Mormon, including the [[Olmec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]].

===LDS-funded archaeology===
In 1955, [[Thomas Stuart Ferguson]], a Latter Day Saint and the founder of the New World Archaeological Foundation (NWAF), with five years of funding from [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), began to dig throughout Mesoamerica for evidence of the veracity of the Book of Mormon claims. In a 1961 newsletter, Ferguson predicted that although nothing had been found, the Book of Mormon cities would be found within ten years.<ref>Larson, S. (2004). Quest for the gold plates: Thomas Stuart Ferguson's archaeological search for the Book of Mormon. Salt Lake City, UT: Freethinker Press in association with Smith Research Associates. page 68</ref> In 1972, Christian scholar Hal Hougey wrote to Ferguson questioning the progress made, given the stated timetable in which the cities would be found.<ref name= "Larson 1990">{{citation |first= Stan |last= Larson |title= The Odyssey of Thomas Stuart Ferguson |journal= [[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]] |date= Spring 1990 |pages= 76, 79 }}</ref> Replying to Hougey as well as secular and non-secular requests, Ferguson wrote in a letter dated June 5, 1972: "Ten years have passed . ... I had sincerely hoped that Book-of-Mormon cities would be positively identified within 10 years—and time has proved me wrong in my anticipation."<ref name= "Larson 1990"/>

During the period of 1959–61, NWAF colleague Dee Green was editor of the ''BYU Archaeological Society Newsletter'' and had an article from it published in the summer of 1969 edition of ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', pp 76–78 in which he acknowledged that the NWAF findings did not back up the veracity of the Book of Mormon claims. After this article and another six years of fruitless search, Ferguson published a 29-page paper in 1975 entitled, "Written Symposium on Book-of-Mormon Geography: Response of Thomas S. Ferguson to the Norman & Sorenson Papers" in which he concluded, "I'm afraid that up to this point, I must agree with Dee Green, who has told us that to date there is no Book-of-Mormon geography".<ref>"Written Symposium on Book-of-Mormon Geography: Response of Thomas S. Ferguson to the Norman & Sorenson Papers", p. 29</ref> Referring to his own paper, Ferguson wrote a 1976 letter in which he stated: "The real implication of the paper is that you can't set the Book-of-Mormon geography down anywhere—because it is fictional and will never meet the requirements of the dirt-archeology. I should say—what is in the ground will never conform to what is in the book."<ref name= "Larson 1990"/>

The archaeological investigations of NWAF-sponsored projects have contributed towards the documentation and understanding of pre-Columbian societies, particularly in Mesoamerica.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} Currently, BYU maintains 86 documents on the work of the NWAF at the BYU NWAF website<ref>[http://www.lib.byu.edu/dlib/spc/nwaf/ BYU NWAF website]</ref> and these documents are used outside both BYU and the LDS Church by researchers.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

==Linguistics==
{{Main|Linguistics and the Book of Mormon}}
An additional criticism of the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon concerns linguistics. According to the text, the Nephites and the Lamanites initially spoke [[Hebrew]] (600 BC) and might have spoken a modified Semitic language until at least 400 AD, when the Book of Mormon ends.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The non-canonized introductory paragraph to the LDS Church 1981 edition of the Book of Mormon stated that the Lamanites were the "principal ancestors of the American Indians". No Semitic language is spoken natively in the Americas today, however, and there is no evidence that any Native American language has been influenced by any Semitic language at any point in its history. Historical linguists who specialize in the languages of Native America are in agreement that the languages of Native America cannot be proven to be related to each other within the last eight to ten thousand years, let alone within the last thousand.<ref>Lyle Campbell. 1997. ''American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America''. Oxford University Press.; Ives Goddard. 1996. "Introduction," ''Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 17, Languages''. Ed. Ives Goddard. Washington: Smithsonian Institution; Marianne Mithun. 1999. ''The Languages of Native North America''. [[Cambridge University Press]].</ref> A common counterargument is that the Book of Mormon mentions contact with other civilizations<ref>{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|24|1|4}}</ref> that might have had their own non-Semitic languages that influenced or supplanted any Semitic language being spoken. Apologists{{which|date=August 2013}} point out that the introduction merely stated that the peoples mentioned in the Book of Mormon are the primary ancestors of the Native Americans; it did not claim that they are the sole ancestors.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The original 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon did not make this claim.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} In 2007, the introduction to the Book of Mormon was changed{{by who?|date=October 2020}} to state that the Lamanites are "among the ancestors of the American Indians."<ref>Introduction, Book of Mormon, LDS Church (2013)</ref> The 1981 edition of the Book of Mormon states that the Lamanites are "the principal ancestors of American Indians."<ref>Book of Mormon, LDS Church (1981)</ref>

==Anthon Transcript==
{{Main|Anthon Transcript}}

The "[[Anthon Transcript]]" is a small piece of paper on which Joseph Smith wrote several lines of characters. According to Smith, these characters were from the [[golden plates]] (the ancient record from which Smith claims to have translated the Book of Mormon) and represent the [[reformed Egyptian]] writing that was on the plates. This paper was then delivered to professor [[Charles Anthon]], a well-known classical scholar of [[Columbia College, Columbia University]], for an expert opinion on the authenticity of the characters and the translation. Adherents to the Book of Mormon claim that Anthon attested to the characters' authenticity in writing to [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] but then ripped up his certification after hearing the story of Smith and the plates.<ref name="JS-H">{{cite book |title=''Joseph Smith–History'' |last=Smith |first=Joseph |author-link=Joseph Smith |publisher=[[LDS Church]] |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.64-65?lang=eng |access-date=2009-11-29}} See also: [[Joseph Smith–History]].</ref> Critics, and Anthon himself, claim that Anthon believed any idea of reformed Egyptian was a hoax all along and that Harris was being duped.<ref>{{cite book |chapter= Chapter XVIII |chapter-url= https://archive.org/stream/mormonismunvaile00howe#page/269/mode/1up |title= Mormonism Unvailed |author= Eber D.

==Population genetics==
{{Main|Genetics and the Book of Mormon}}
The Book of Mormon tells of the [[Jaredite|people of Jared]], consisting of several families from the [[Tower of Babel]], who migrated to America from the Old World before Abraham's time; a group including Lehi's family<!--Ishmael's family, Zoram, and possibly others--> who migrated to America from Jerusalem around 600 BC; and another group (the [[Mulekite|people of Mulek]]) who migrated to America from Jerusalem about eight years later. Although the Book of Mormon makes no overt assertions regarding the migration or non-migration of other groups to America, an introductory paragraph added to the 1981 edition identifies the Lamanites as the "principal ancestors of the American Indians."<ref name = principal/> In 2007, this statement was changed to "among the ancestors".<ref name="LDS BoM Intro"/>

==Smithsonian Institution statement on the Book of Mormon==
The [[Smithsonian Institution]] issues a standard reply to requests for their opinion regarding the Book of Mormon as an archaeological or scientific guide.<ref name="missingauthor"/> Prior to 1998, the statement denied any evidence for pre-Columbian contact between Old and New Worlds: "Certainly there was no contact with the ancient Egyptians, Hebrews or other peoples of Western Asia or the Near East." In 1998, the Smithsonian began issuing a shorter letter without the detailed response found in the first letter, and limited its comment to briefly deny any use of the Book of Mormon as an archaeological guide by the institution.

==Limited geography model==
[[File:Book of Mormon Lands and Sites2.jpg|right|550px|thumb|Map showing the possible lands and sites of the Book of Mormon in Mesoamerica]]
{{See also|Limited geography model (Book of Mormon)}}
Since the time of its publication, most Latter Day Saints have viewed and explained the Book of Mormon as a comprehensive history of all [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]];<ref>{{Harvnb|Mauss|2003|p= }}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref> this understanding of the Book of Mormon is referred to as the "hemispheric model." Other Latter Day Saints, however, believe that the hemispheric model is an assumption not supported by a close reading of the text. [[B. H. Roberts]] states the inadequacy of the hemispheric model in ''Studies of the Book of Mormon'':

<blockquote>[C]ould the people of Mulek and of Lehi ... part of the time numbering and occupying the land at least from Yucatan to Cumorah ... live and move and have their being in the land of America and not come in contact with other races and tribes of men, if such existed in the New World within Book of Mormon times? To make this seem possible the area occupied by the Nephites and Lamanites would have to be extremely limited, much more limited, I fear, than the Book of Mormon would admit our assuming.<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1985|p=93}}</ref>
</blockquote>

The cities mentioned in the Book of Mormon have not been identified. Several groups of Mormon scholars and apologists, including the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research]] (FAIR) and the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), have proposed that the city [[Zarahemla]] is located somewhere within Central America because of the description given in {{lds|Alma|alma|22|27}} as a narrow neck of land bordering sea on the west and on the east. This approach, often referred to as the "[[Limited Geography Model (Book of Mormon)|Limited Geography Model]]," argues for a more limited view of the Book of Mormon, suggesting that the book is a history of only a small group of Native Americans in Central America. This theory has been gaining substantial support among LDS scholars since the mid-1980s because it more accurately represents the descriptions given within the text itself. For instance, the populations and civilizations described in the Book of Mormon were likely too small (only a few million) to fill entire continents; moreover, there is much evidence that one common assumption of the past—that Book of Mormon civilizations were alone in America—is probably incorrect. Most LDS authors hold the belief that the Book of Mormon events took place within a limited region in Mesoamerica, and that others were present on the continent at the time of Lehi's arrival.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|p=264}}</ref> This geographical and population model was formally published in an official church magazine, ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', in a two-part series by [[John L. Sorenson]] published in September and October 1984.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Sorenson |first= John L |author-link= John L.

== Other defenses of historicity ==
The Gospel Topics essays section of the LDS official website hosts two essays entitled "Book of Mormon and DNA Studies"<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-and-dna-studies?lang=eng "Book of Mormon and DNA Studies"]</ref> and "Book of Mormon Translation".<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng "Book of Mormon Translation."]</ref> These are some of the few official Church statements with regard to such historical issues.
