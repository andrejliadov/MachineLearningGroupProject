'''''Kappalottiya Thamizhan''''' ({{trans|The [[Tamils|Tamilian]] who launched a ship}}) is a 1961 Indian [[Tamil language|Tamil]]-language [[historical drama]] film directed by [[B. R. Panthulu]]. The film stars [[Sivaji Ganesan]], [[Gemini Ganesan]] and [[Savitri (actress)|Savitri]]. It is based on the book of the same name by [[M. P. Sivagnanam]], a biography of [[V. O. Chidambaram Pillai]] who founded the Swadeshi Stream Navigation Company to break the monopoly of the [[British Raj|British]] over maritime trade out of India.

''Kappalottiya Thamizhan'' was released on 7 November 1961. The film received critical acclaim, and won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil]] at the [[9th National Film Awards]]. Though it performed poorly at the box office during its initial release, it fared better after receiving tax exemption during its re-release 1967.

== Plot ==
[[V. O. Chidambaram Pillai]] has devoted himself to the cause of [[Indian independence movement|India's freedom]] from the [[British Raj]]. Chidambaram, appearing for the peasant Madasami, wins a case filed by an agent of a British proprietor. Chidambaram's father, who appeared for the agent, sends his son to [[Thoothukudi]] lest the British proprietor should give him any trouble. Madasami who accompanies Chidambaram, looks after the latter's salt-pan. At Thoothukudi, Chidambaram meets [[Subramaniya Siva]], a freedom fighter and works for the Swadeshi movement.

Chidambaram receives a complaint from some of the local merchants that the British Shipping Company had refused to load their goods. Against great odds, Chidambaram starts the National Shipping Company with Indian Capital to free Indian trade from dependence on foreign liners. The company prospers despite attempts by the British Company to sabotage the ship of the Indian firm. Chidambaram incurs the displeasure of the Government by organising a strike for getting the grievances of the local coral mill workers redressed and by organising public celebrations to mark the release of [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] in contravention of a prohibitory order.

Chidambaram, along with Siva, is invited to Tirunelveli by the District Collector, Winch. The collector directs them not to engage in political activity and also orders them out of the District. They defy the orders and are arrested. In the trial which ensues, Chidambaram is sentenced to 20 years life imprisonment and Siva to 10 years. Chidambaram's sentence is reduced to six years on appeal. The imprisonment of these two leaders sparks off mass unrest which is put down ruthlessly. Some time later, the new [[Robert Ashe (administrator)|District Collector Ashe]] is shot dead by a patriotic [[Vanchinathan]], who commits suicide before the police can reach him.

The news of the unrelenting struggle outside gives much consolation to Chidambaram and Siva who are treated barbarously in the prison. Chidambaram emerges from the prison a broken man only to witness a series of disappointments&nbsp;– Chidambaram's brother has become insane, Siva is a victim of [[leprosy]] contracted during his term in prison, people have forgotten him and his role in the Indian independence movement, the National Shipping Company is bought by its British rival and leaders like [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] and [[Subramania Bharati]] die one after another. Chidambaram devotes the last years of his life to the study of literature and dies still dreaming of the day when India would be free.

== Production ==
''Kappalottiya Thamizhan'' is based on the 1944 book of the same name by [[M. P. Sivagnanam]], a biography of [[V. O.

The film was not targeted for the masses, who at that time did not want to be "stirred" by the Nationalist Spirit.{{sfn|Ganesan|Narayanaswamy|2007|pp=148–149}}

According to film historian [[S. Theodore Baskaran]], there is no evidence of any research undertaken for making the film. He stated that the film had no [[theatrical property|props]], apart from the character's costumes and the female character's ear-lobes, which were done to create a "period effect".{{Sfn|Baskaran|1996|pages=131–132}} The film was partly coloured using [[Gevacolor]], and the colour sequences were processed at the Film Centre, [[Mumbai]].

=== Reception ===
Following Ganesan's death in 2001, S. Viswanathan of ''[[Frontline (magazine)|The Frontline]]'' praised his performance, saying "Critics list several films as his best in terms of performance. However, according to the actor, his career best was ''Kappalottiya Thamizhan''."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Viswanathan |first=S. |date=2001 |title=Tamil cinema's lodestar |url=https://frontline.thehindu.com/other/obituary/article30159761.ece |url-access=subscription |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819114238/https://frontline.thehindu.com/other/obituary/article30159761.ece |archive-date=19 August 2020 |access-date=19 September 2020 |magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|The Frontline]] |volume=18 |issue=16}}</ref> Tamil film historian [[S. Theodore Baskaran]] said, "Though Sivaji Ganesan's portrayal of Chidambaram Pillai is affected in the earlier part of the film, later in the prison sequences and during the trauma of disillusionment, his acting is natural."{{Sfn|Baskaran|1996|pages=131–132}} On Ganesan's performance, Chidambaram's son Subramaniam said it was like seeing his father alive on the screen, a statement Ganesan considered his "highest award".<ref name="TEAR" />

He also stated that he was not upset for losing money making the film to kindle the national spirit, but rather happy that he could harness the medium to remind people of the Indian freedom fighters of the bygone era.{{Sfn|Ganesan|Narayanaswamy|2007|pages=148–149}}
