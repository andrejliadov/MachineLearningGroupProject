'''Human zoos''', also known as '''ethnological expositions''', were 19th- and 20th-century public exhibitions of humans, usually in an erroneously labeled "natural" or "primitive" state.

== Human zoos in Germany ==
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2018}}
In the late 19th century, German ethnographic museums<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Objects of Culture Ethnology and Ethnographic Museums in Imperial Germany|last=H. Glenn|first=Penny|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2002}}</ref> were an attempt at empirical study of human culture. They contained artifacts from cultures around the world organized by continent allowing visitors to see the similarities and differences between the groups and form their own ideas. The ethnographic museums of Germany were explicitly designed to steer away from projecting certain principles or instructing its viewers to interpret the material in a particular manner. They were instead left open for museum guests to form their own opinions. The directors of Germany's ethnographic museums intended to create a unifying history of mankind,<ref name=":0" /> to show how humans had progressed to the cosmopolitan creatures that walked the halls of these museums.

Ethnology studies in Germany took a new approach in the 1870s as human displays were incorporated into zoos. These exhibits were lauded as educational to the general population by the scientific community of the time, because they were informative of the way that people lived across the world. Very quickly, the exhibits were used as a way to show that Europeans had evolved into a superior cosmopolitan life.

As Ethnogenic expositions were discontinued in Germany around 1931,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/human-zoos-when-people-were-the-exhibits/a-37748193|title=Human zoos: When people were the exhibits &#124; DW &#124; 10.03.2017|first=Deutsche|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM|accessdate=Aug 7, 2020}}</ref> there were many repercussions for the performers. Many of the people brought from their homelands to work in the exhibits had created families in Germany, and there were many children that had been born in Germany. Once they no longer worked in the zoos or for performance acts, these people were stuck living in Germany where they had no rights and were harshly discriminated against. During the rise of the Nazi party, the foreign actors in these stage shows were typically able to stay out of concentration camps because there were so few of them that the Nazis did not see them as a real threat.<ref name=":1">“‘You Better Go Back to Africa’| Interview.” ''"You Better Go Back to Africa"| Interview'', DW English, 18 June 2017, www.youtube.com/watch?v=baGXUsOKBcU.</ref> Although they were able to avoid concentration camps, they were not able to participate in German life as citizens of ethnically German origin could. The [[Hitler Youth]] did not allow children of foreign parents to participate, and adults were rejected as German soldiers.<ref name=":1" /> Many ended up working in war industry factories or foreign laborer camps.<ref name=":1" /> After [[World War II]] ended, racism in Germany became more concealed or invisible, but it did not go away. Many people of foreign descent intended to leave after the war, but because of their German nationality, it was difficult for them to emigrate.<ref name=":1" />

=== Key influences ===
[[Carl Hagenbeck]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Savages and Beasts: The Birth of the Modern Zoo|last=Rothfels|first=Nigel|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2012}}</ref> was a German exotic animal businessman who became famous for his dominating the animal trade market during the mid- to late 1800s. Due to the costs of acquiring and keeping animals, the financial implications started to worry Hagenbeck, and he began looking for other ways to alleviate the company’s monetary strains. [[Heinrich Leutemann]], an old friend of Hagenbeck's, suggested bringing along the people from the foreign lands to accompany the animals. The idea struck Hagenbeck as brilliant and he had a group of [[Sami people|Laplander]]s accompany his next shipment of [[reindeer]]. They set up traditional houses and went about their business as usual on the Hagenbeck property. The display was so successful that Carl was organizing his second show before the first one was over. Although the concept of parading peoples captured from conquered lands goes back to the Romans, Hagenbeck claimed to have the first shows displaying “cultures” from foreign lands. Carl Hagenbeck continued to bring indigenous people along with the animals that he was importing from across the globe. The people would come with their hunting equipment, homes, and other facets of their daily life. Hagenbeck’s displays evolved in complexity as the years went by. In 1876, Hagenbeck had a group of 6 [[Sami people|Sami]] accompany a herd of reindeer, and by 1874 his acts included close to 67 men, women, and children in his ''Ceylon'' show performing with 25 elephants. The performances also expanded from showing everyday activities such as milking reindeer and building huts, to displaying some of the more extravagant parts of the cultures such as magicians, jugglers, and devil dancers.

The notion of the human curiosity has a history at least as long as [[History of colonialism|colonialism]]. In the [[Western Hemisphere]], one of the earliest-known [[zoo]]s, that of [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] in Mexico, consisted not only of a vast collection of animals, but also exhibited humans, for example, dwarves, albinos and hunchbacks.<ref>Mullan, Bob and Marvin Garry, ''Zoo culture: The book about watching people watch animals'', [[University of Illinois Press]], [[Urbana, Illinois]], Second edition, 1998, p.32. {{ISBN|0-252-06762-2}}</ref>

During the [[Renaissance]], the [[Medici]] developed a large [[menagerie]] in the Vatican.
In the 16th century, Cardinal [[Ippolito de' Medici|Hippolytus Medici]] had a collection of people of different races as well as exotic animals.
He is reported as having a troupe of so-called Savages, speaking over twenty languages; there were also Moors, Tartars, Indians, Turks and Africans.<ref>Mullan, Bob and Marvin Garry, ''Zoo culture: The book about watching people watch animals'', [[University of Illinois Press]], [[Urbana, Illinois]], Second edition, 1998, p.98. {{ISBN|0-252-06762-2}}</ref> In 1691, Englishman [[William Dampier]] exhibited a tattooed native of [[Miangas]] who he bought when he was in [[Mindanao]].

Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire, director of the [[Jardin d'acclimatation]], decided in 1877 to organize two ethnological spectacles that presented Nubians and [[Inuit]]. That year, the audience of the Jardin d'acclimatation' doubled to one million. Between 1877 and 1912, approximately thirty ethnological exhibitions were presented at the ''Jardin zoologique d'acclimatation''.

Both the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878]] and the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Parisian World's Fair]] presented a Negro Village (''village nègre''). Visited by 28 million people, the 1889 World's Fair displayed 400 indigenous people as the major attraction. The 1900 World's Fair presented the famous [[diorama]] living in [[Madagascar]], while the [[Colonial exhibition|Colonial Exhibitions]] in [[Marseille]]s (1906 and 1922) and in Paris (1907 and 1931) also displayed humans in cages, often nude or semi-nude. The [[Paris Colonial Exposition|1931 exhibition in Paris]] was so successful that 34 million people attended it in six months, while a smaller counter-exhibition entitled ''The Truth on the Colonies'', organized by the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]], attracted very few visitors—in the first room, it recalled [[Albert Londres]] and [[André Gide]]'s critiques of [[unfree labour|forced labour]] in the colonies. Nomadic [[Senegal|Senegalese Villages]] were also presented.

In 1883, native people of [[Suriname]] were displayed in the [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|International Colonial and Export Exhibition]] in Amsterdam, held behind the [[Rijksmuseum]].

In 1886, the Spanish displayed natives of the [[Philippines]] in an exhibition, where ''pinunsulares'', or Spanish people born in [[Spain]], gawked at the natives who they perceived as people who they "civilized". This event added flame to the 1896 Philippine revolution.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42633263?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents|jstor = 42633263|title = The Enlightenment and the Philippine Revolution|last1 = Arcilla|first1 = Jose S.|journal = Philippine Studies|year = 1991|volume = 39|issue = 3|pages = 358–373}}</ref>

In the late 1800s, Hagenbeck organized exhibitions of indigenous populations from various parts of the globe. He staged a public display in 1886 of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] autochthones from the [[Sri Lanka]]. In 1893/1894, he also put together an exhibition of [[Sami people|Sami]]/Lapps in [[Hamburg]]-Saint Paul.

1903 saw one of the first widespread protests against human zoos, at the "Human Pavilion" of a 1903 exposition in Osaka, Japan. The exhibition of Koreans and Okinawans in "primitive" housing incurred protests from the governments of Korea and Okinawa, and a Taiwanese woman wearing Chinese dress angered a group of Chinese students studying abroad in Tokyo. An Ainu schoolteacher was made to exhibit himself in the zoo in order to raise money for his schoolhouse, as the Japanese government refused to pay. The fact that the schoolteacher made eloquent speeches and fundraised for his school while wearing traditional dress confused the spectators. An anonymous front-page column in a Japanese magazine condemned these examples and the "Human Pavilion" in total, calling it inhumane to exhibit people as spectacles.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=ZIOMEK |first1=KIRSTEN L. |title=The 1903 Human Pavilion: Colonial Realities and Subaltern Subjectivities in Twentieth-Century Japan |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |date=2014 |volume=73 |issue=2 |pages=493–516 |doi=10.1017/S0021911814000011 |jstor=43553298 |issn=0021-9118}}</ref>

In 1896, to increase the number of visitors, the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]] invited one hundred Sioux Native Americans to establish a village at the site.

In 1906, [[Madison Grant]]—socialite, [[eugenics|eugenicist]], amateur [[anthropology|anthropologist]], and head of the [[New York Zoological Society]]—had [[Congo Pygmies|Congolese pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] put on display at the Bronx Zoo in New York City alongside [[ape]]s and other animals. At the behest of Grant, the zoo director [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]] placed Benga displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an [[orangutan]] named Dohong, and a parrot, and labeled him ''The Missing Link'', suggesting that in [[evolution]]ary terms Africans like Benga were closer to apes than were Europeans. It triggered protests from the city's clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see it.<ref name=NYTBenga/><ref>Bradford, Phillips Verner and Blume, Harvey. ''Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo''.

Benga shot targets with a bow and arrow, wove twine, and wrestled with an orangutan. Although, according to ''The New York Times'', "few expressed audible objection to the sight of a human being in a cage with monkeys as companions", controversy erupted as black clergymen in the city took great offense. "Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes", said the Reverend James H. Gordon, superintendent of the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn. "We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls."<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/nyregion/thecity/06zoo.html?ex=1155009600&en=c2cc9b84edc068cd&ei=5087%0A|title=The Scandal at the Zoo|last=Keller|first=Mitch|date=2006-08-06|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref>

[[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] [[George B. McClellan Jr.]] refused to meet with the clergymen, drawing the praise of Hornaday, who wrote to him: "When the history of the Zoological Park is written, this incident will form its most amusing passage."<ref name="nytimes" />

As the controversy continued, Hornaday remained unapologetic, insisting that his only intention was to put on an ethnological exhibition. In another letter, he said that he and Grant—who ten years later would publish the racist tract ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]''—considered it "imperative that the society should not even seem to be dictated to" by the black clergymen.<ref name="nytimes" />

On Monday, September 8, 1906, after just two days, Hornaday decided to close the exhibition, and Benga could be found walking the zoo grounds, often followed by a crowd "howling, jeering and yelling."<ref name="nytimes" />

Between 1 May and 31 October 1908 the [[Scottish National Exhibition]], opened by one of Queen Victoria’s grandsons, [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]], was held in Saughton Park, [[Edinburgh]].

By the 1930s, a new kind of human zoo appeared in America, nude shows masquerading as education. These included the [[Zoro Garden Nudist Colony]] at the Pacific International Exposition in San Diego, California (1935-6) and the Sally Rand Nude Ranch at the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in San Francisco (1939). The former was supposedly a real [[nudist colony]], which used hired performers instead of actual nudists. The latter featured nude women performing in western attire. The Golden Gate fair also featured a "Greenwich Village" show, described in the Official Guide Book as “Model artists’ colony and revue theatre.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/bio/rand.html|title=Sally Rand - The Music Box and Sally Rand Nude Ranch at Treasure Island - 1939|website=www.sfmuseum.org|accessdate=Aug 7, 2020}}</ref>

Critics argued that presenting African culture in the context of a zoo contributed to exoticizing and stereotyping Africans, thus laying the ground work for racial discrimination.<ref name="Schiller">{{cite web |last1=Schiller |first1=Nina Glick |last2=Dea |first2=Data |last3=Höhne |first3=Markus |title=African Culture and the Zoo in the 21st Century: The "African Village" in the Augsburg Zoo and Its Wider Implications |url=http://www.eth.mpg.de/events/current/pdf/1120750934-01.pdf |publisher=Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104161839/http://www.eth.mpg.de/events/current/pdf/1120750934-01.pdf |archive-date=4 January 2006 |date=4 July 2005 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In August 2005, [[London Zoo]] displayed four human volunteers wearing fig leaves (and bathing suits) for four days.<ref>[http://www.zsl.org/london-zoo/whats-on/the-human-zoo,94,EV.html London Zoo official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116015505/http://www.zsl.org/london-zoo/whats-on/the-human-zoo,94,EV.html |date=2006-01-16 }};{{cite news | title=Humans strip bare for zoo exhibit | publisher=BBC News | date=August 25, 2005 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4184466.stm | accessdate=January 5, 2010 }};{{cite news | title=Humans On Display At London's Zoo | publisher=CBS News | date=August 26, 2005 | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/08/26/world/main798423.shtml }};{{cite news|title=The human zoo? by Debra Saunders (a bit more critical)|publisher=[[Townhall]]|date=September 1, 2005|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/DebraJSaunders/2005/09/01/the_human_zoo}}</ref>

In 2007, [[Adelaide Zoo]] ran a Human Zoo exhibition which consisted of a group of people who, as part of a study exercise, had applied to be housed in the former ape enclosure by day, but then returned home by night.<ref>{{cite news|title=Humans on display at Adelaide Zoo |publisher=[[tvnz]] |date=January 12, 2007 |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/957918/3362663.xhtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222070938/http://tvnz.co.nz/content/957918/3362663.xhtml |archive-date=February 22, 2014}}</ref> The inhabitants took part in several exercises, and spectators were asked for donations towards a new ape enclosure.

Also in 2007, pygmy performers at the Festival of Pan-African Music (Fespam) were housed at a zoo in [[Brazzaville]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].  Although members of the group of 20 people—among them an infant, age three months—were not officially on display, it was necessary for them to "collect firewood in the zoo to cook their food, and [they] were being stared at and filmed by tourists and passers-by".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6898241.stm|title=Pygmy artists housed in Congo zoo|author=BBC News|date=2007-07-13|accessdate=2008-08-22|author-link=BBC News}}</ref>

In August 2014, as part of the [[Edinburgh International Festival]], South African theatre-maker [[Brett Bailey|Brett Bailey's]] show ''Exhibit B'' was performed in the Playfair Library Hall, [[University of Edinburgh]]; then in September at [[Barbican Centre|The Barbican]] in [[London]].  This explored the nature of Human Zoos and raised much controversy both amongst the performers and the audiences.<ref>{{Cite web|last=O'Mahony|first=John|date=11 August 2014|title=Edinburgh's most controversial show: Exhibit B, a human zoo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/11/-sp-exhibit-b-human-zoo-edinburgh-festivals-most-controversial|access-date=7 June 2020|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

With a view to tackling the morality of Human Zoo exhibits, 2018 saw the poster exhibition, ''Putting People on Display'', tour [[Glasgow School of Art]], the [[University of Edinburgh]], the [[University of Stirling]], the [[University of St Andrews]] and the [[University of Aberdeen]].  Additional posters were added to a selection from the French ACHAC's exhibition, ''Human Zoos: the Invention of the Savage'', in relation to the Scottish dimension in hosting such shows.<ref>{{Cite web|date=14 June 2018|title=ACHAC's 'Human Zoos' Exhibition: Scottish University Tour|url=https://frenchatstirling.wordpress.com/2018/06/14/achacs-human-zoos-exhibition-scottish-university-tour/|access-date=7 June 2020|website=French at Stirling}}</ref>
