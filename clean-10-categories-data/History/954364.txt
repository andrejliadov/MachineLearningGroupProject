{{nihongo|'''Mount Asama'''|浅間山|Asama-yama}} is an active [[complex volcano]] in central [[Honshū]], the main island of [[Japan]]. The volcano is the most active on Honshū.<ref name="Smithsonian" /> The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] classifies Mount Asama as rank A.<ref name="qvoj-list"/> It stands {{convert|2568|m|ft}} above [[sea level]] on the border of [[Gunma prefecture|Gunma]] and [[Nagano prefecture]]s.

Scientists from the [[University of Tokyo]] and [[Nagoya University]] completed their first successful imaging experiment of the interior of the volcano in April 2007. By detecting sub-atomic particles called [[muons]] as they passed through the volcano after arriving from space, the scientists were able gradually to build up a picture of the interior, creating images of cavities through which lava was passing deep inside the volcano.<ref>{{cite journal | bibcode = 2007E&PSL.263..104T | title=High resolution imaging in the inhomogeneous crust with cosmic-ray muon radiography: The density structure below the volcanic crater floor of Mt.

A University of Tokyo [[vulcanology|volcano observatory]] is located on the mountain's east slope.

A Swiss research team found Mount Asamayama's volcanic eruption could have contributed to extreme weather that caused severe famine, torrential rain and consecutive cold summers in Europe. They studied ice cores in [[Greenland]] which had increased sulfate deposition in 1108 CE. In the late [[Heian Period]] (794–1185) the diary of the court noble [[Fujiwara no Munetada]] reported that Mount Asamayama erupted on 29 August 1108. He wrote that a local report described rice paddies and fields could not be farmed due to being covered by a thick layer of ash.<ref name="Swiss-study">{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13421025 |title=Mt.
