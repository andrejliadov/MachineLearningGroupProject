This list includes all the main '''Antarctic exploration ships''' that were employed in the seventeen expeditions that took place in the era between 1897 and 1922, known as the '''[[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]]'''. A subsidiary list gives details of support and relief vessels that played significant roles in the expeditions they were commissioned to support.

The tables do not include the regular whaling voyages that took place during this period, or [[Valdivia Expedition|expeditions such as that of Carl Chun]] in 1898–99 in the German vessel ''[[Valdiva]]'', which did not penetrate the [[Antarctic circle]].{{sfn|Chun Collection}} The abortive Cope Expedition of 1920–22, which collapsed through lack of funding without finding an expedition ship, is likewise excluded, though two men were landed from a Norwegian whaler and spent a year on the [[Antarctic peninsula]].{{sfn|Cope Expedition 1920–22}}

Of the ships listed, three survived into the 21st century and are serving as museums: ''[[RRS Discovery|Discovery]]'' in [[Dundee]], ''[[Fram]]'' in [[Oslo]], and ''[[ARA Uruguay|Uruguay]]'' in [[Buenos Aires]].  Two ships – ''[[Antarctic (ship)|Antarctic]]'' and ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'' – were lost in the course of their expeditions; two more – ''[[Gauss (ship)|Gauss]]'' and ''[[Yelcho (1906)|Yelcho]]'' – were scrapped when their useful lives were over. The fate the Japanese ''[[Kainan Maru (Antarctic expedition ship)|Kainan Maru]]'' is unknown.  The others, twelve ships in all, continued their maritime duties and were wrecked or sunk in the years between 1907 and 1962.

| After her Antarctic voyage, ''Belgica'' was employed by a succession of owners in various capacities. Following several years as a research vessel in the [[Kara Sea|Kara]] and [[Greenland Sea]]s{{sfn|Ships of the Polar Explorers}} in 1916 she was renamed ''Isjford'' and became a coal freighter.{{sfn|''Belgica'': Polar Record}}  Subsequently she was converted into a floating fish factory. After the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] she was seized by the British and used as an ammunition depot, before being sunk by the Germans during an air raid on 19 May 1940.

|[[Carsten Borchgrevink]]

Then, while returning to Newfoundland from the [[Gulf of St Lawrence]], she was lost with her entire complement of 173, in the [[SS Newfoundland#1914 Newfoundland Sealing Disaster|1914 Newfoundland Sealing Disaster]].  The precise details of the loss of ''Southern Cross'' are unclear; one theory is that its overloaded cargo of seal pelts shifted during a storm and caused the ship to capsize. The loss of life was the heaviest in Newfoundland and Labrador sealing history.{{sfn|1914 sealing disaster}}

''Fram'' was left for many years to deteriorate at her berth in [[Horten]]. In 1925 a committee for the ship's preservation was formed, under [[Otto Sverdrup]]; in 1929 restoration work began in the shipyard at [[Sandefjord]]. Finally, in 1935, the restored ''Fram'' was brought to [[Oslo]] under the charge of [[Oscar Wisting]], and placed in specially-erected housing.
