{{short description|Pseudoscholarship that attempts to distort or misrepresent the historical record}}
'''Pseudohistory''' is a form of [[pseudoscholarship]] that attempts to distort or misrepresent the [[Recorded history|historical record]], often using methods resembling those used in legitimate [[History|historical research]]. The related term '''cryptohistory''' is applied to a pseudohistory based upon or derived from the superstitions inherent to [[occultism]]. Pseudohistory is related to [[pseudoscience]] and [[pseudoarchaeology]] and usage of the terms may occasionally overlap. Although pseudohistory comes in many forms, scholars have identified many features that tend to be common in pseudohistorical works. One such feature is that pseudohistory is nearly always motivated by a contemporary political, religious, or personal agenda. Pseudohistory also frequently presents a [[big lie]] or sensational claims about historical facts which would require the radical [[Historical revisionism|revision]] (re-writing) of the historical record.

Another very common feature of pseudohistory is the assumption that there is a conspiracy among scholars to suppress the "true" history in favor of "mainstream history", which is commonly corroborated by elaborate [[conspiracy theories]]. Works of pseudohistory often rely exclusively on sources that appear to support the thesis being promoted while ignoring sources that contradict it. Many works of pseudohistory treat myths, legends, and other unreliable sources as literal historical truth while ignoring or dismissing evidence to the contrary. Sometimes a work of pseudohistory may adopt a position of extreme skepticism, sometimes insisting that there is really no such thing as historical truth and that any hypothesis is just as good as any other. Many works of pseudohistory conflate mere possibility with actuality, assuming that if something ''could'' have happened, then it did.

==Definition and etymology==
The term ''pseudohistory'' was coined in the early nineteenth century, which makes the word older than the related terms ''[[wikt:pseudo-scholarship|pseudo-scholarship]]'' and ''[[wikt:pseudo-science|pseudoscience]]''.<ref>

Writers [[Michael Shermer]] and [[Alex Grobman]] define pseudohistory as "the rewriting of the past for present personal or political purposes".<ref name="Shermer">{{cite book|last1=Shermer|first1=Michael|last2=Grobman|first2=Alex|title=Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uACijKy-cbgC&q=Holocaust+denial+pseudohistory&pg=PA237|location=Oakland, California|publisher=University of California Press|date=2009|isbn=978-0-520-26098-6}}</ref>{{rp|2}} Other writers take a broader definition; Douglas Allchin, a historian of science, contends that when the history of scientific discovery is presented in a simplified way, with drama exaggerated and scientists romanticized, this creates wrong stereotypes about how science works, and in fact constitutes pseudohistory, despite being based on real facts.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Allchin|first=D.|date=2004|url=http://www.tc.umn.edu/~allch001/papers/pseudo.pdf|title=Pseudohistory and pseudoscience|volume=1|journal=Science & Education|issue=13|pages=179–95|doi=10.1023/B:SCED.0000025563.35883.e9|bibcode=2004Sc&Ed..13..179A|s2cid=7378302|access-date=2007-02-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512082518/http://www.tc.umn.edu/~allch001/papers/pseudo.pdf|archive-date=2008-05-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
[[Robert Todd Carroll]] has developed a list of criteria to identify pseudo-historic works. He states that:
"Pseudohistory is purported history which:
* Treats myths, legends, sagas and similar literature as literal truth
* Is neither critical nor skeptical in its reading of ancient historians, taking their claims at face value and ignoring empirical or logical evidence contrary to the claims of the ancients
* Is on a mission, not a quest, seeking to support some contemporary political or religious agenda rather than find out the truth about the past
* Often denies that there is such a thing as historical truth, clinging to the extreme skeptical notion that only what is absolutely certain can be called 'true' and nothing is absolutely certain, so nothing is true
* Often maintains that history is nothing but mythmaking and that different histories are not to be compared on such traditional academic standards as accuracy, empirical probability, logical consistency, relevancy, completeness, fairness, honesty, etc., but on moral or political grounds
* Is selective in its use of ancient documents, citing favorably those that fit with its agenda, and ignoring or interpreting away those documents which don't fit
* Considers the possibility of something being true as sufficient to believe it is true if it fits with one's agenda
* Often maintains that there is a conspiracy to suppress its claims because of racism, atheism or ethnocentrism, or because of opposition to its political or religious agenda"<ref>Carroll, Robert Todd. [http://www.skepdic.com/pseudohs.html ''The skeptic's dictionary'']. Hoboken: John Wiley & Sons (2003), p. 305.</ref>

[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] prefers the term "cryptohistory." He identifies two necessary elements as "a complete ignorance of the primary sources" and the repetition of "inaccuracies and wild claims".<ref>Goodrick-Clarke 1985: 224,225</ref><ref>Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, ''The Occult Roots of Nazism'', p. 225 (Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2005 edition). {{ISBN|978-1-86064-973-8}}</ref>

Other common characteristics of pseudohistory are:
* The arbitrary linking of disparate events so as to form – in the theorist's opinion – a pattern.  This is typically then developed into a [[conspiracy theory]] postulating a hidden agent responsible for creating and maintaining the pattern. For example, the pseudohistorical ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' links the [[Knights Templar]], the medieval [[Holy Grail|Grail Romances]], the [[Merovingian]] Frankish dynasty and the artist [[Nicolas Poussin]] in an attempt to identify lineal descendants of Jesus.
* Hypothesising the consequences of unlikely events that "could" have happened, thereby assuming tacitly that they did.
* [[Sensationalism]], or [[shock value]]
* [[Cherry picking]] evidence that helps the historical argument being made and suppressing evidence that hurts it.<ref>Ellis, Joseph J.  ''American Dialogue: The Founders and Us''.  New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2018. p. 168.</ref>

==Categories and examples==
{{Further|Historical negationism|Pseudoarchaeology}}
The following are some common categories of pseudohistorical theory, with examples.  Note that not all theories in a listed category are necessarily pseudohistorical; they are rather categories that seem to attract pseudohistorians.

===Ancient aliens, ancient technologies, and lost lands===
{{main|Ancient astronauts}}

[[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s books ''[[Worlds in Collision]]'' (1950), ''[[Ages in Chaos]]'' (1952), and ''Earth in Upheaval'' (1955), which became "instant bestsellers",<ref name="Fritze"/> demonstrated that pseudohistory based on ancient mythology held potential for tremendous financial success<ref name="Fritze"/> and became models of success for future works in the genre.<ref name="Fritze"/>

In 1968, [[Erich von Däniken]] published ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', which claims that ancient visitors from outer space constructed the pyramids and other monuments. He has since published other books in which he makes similar claims. These claims have all been categorized as pseudohistory.<ref name="Fritze"/>{{rp|201}} Similarly, [[Zechariah Sitchin]] has published numerous books claiming that a race of extraterrestrial beings from the [[Nibiru cataclysm#Origins|Planet Nibiru]] known as the [[Anunnaki]] visited Earth in ancient times in search of gold, and that they genetically engineered humans to serve as their slaves. He claims that memories of these occurrences are recorded in [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian mythology]], as well as other mythologies all across the globe. These speculations have likewise been categorized as pseudohistory.<ref name=heiser>{{cite web|title=The Myth of a Sumerian 12th Planet|url=http://www.michaelsheiser.com/nibiru.pdf|author=Michael S.

The author [[Graham Hancock]] has sold over four million copies of books promoting the pseudohistorical thesis that all the major monuments of the ancient world, including [[Stonehenge]], the [[Egyptian pyramids]], and the [[moai]] of [[Easter Island]], were built by a single ancient supercivilization,<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheiko|first=Konstantin|date=2012|title=Nationalist Imaginings of the Russian Past: Anatolii Fomenko and the Rise of Alternative History in Post-Communist Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74s0DwAAQBAJ&q=Graham+Hancock+Pseudohistory&pg=PA83|series=Soviet and Post-Soviet Politics and Society|location=Stuttgart, Germany|publisher=Ibidem-Verlag|volume=86|page=83|isbn=9783838259154}}</ref> which Hancock claims thrived from 15,000 to 10,000 BC and possessed technological and scientific knowledge equal to or surpassing that of modern civilization.<ref name=Fritze/> He first advanced the full form of this argument in his 1995 bestseller ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'',<ref name=Fritze/> which won popular acclaim, but scholarly disdain.<ref name=Fritze/> [[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]] has published numerous books, including ''[[Uriel's Machine]]'' (2000), expounding pseudohistorical assertions that ancient civilizations possessed technology far more advanced than the technology of today.<ref>Merriman, Nick, editor, ''Public Archaeology'', Routledge, 2004 p. 260</ref><ref>Tonkin, S., 2003, [http://www.astunit.com/astrocrud/uriel.htm Uriel's Machine – a Commentary on some of the Astronomical Assertions.]</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter=The comforts of unreason: the importance and relevance of alternative archaeology|editor-last=Merriman|editor-first=Nick|title=Public Archaeology|url=https://archive.org/details/publicarchaeolog00merr_661|url-access=limited|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|date=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/publicarchaeolog00merr_661/page/n274 260]|isbn=9780415258890}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tonkin|first=Stephen|date=2003|url=http://astunit.com/astrocrud.php?topic=uriel|title=Uriel's Machine – a Commentary on some of the Astronomical Assertions|work=The Astronomical Unit|access-date=21 November 2013}}</ref>

===Antisemitic pseudohistory===
[[File:1934 Protocols Patriotic Pub.jpg|thumb|upright|American edition of the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' from 1934]]

The [[Khazar theory]] is an academic [[fringe theory]] that postulates that the bulk of European Jewry are of [[Central Asia]]n (Turkic) origin.

===Alternative chronologies===
An alternative [[chronology]] is a revised sequence of events that deviates from the standard timeline of world history accepted by mainstream scholars. An example of an "alternative chronology" is [[Anatoly Fomenko]]'s [[New Chronology (Fomenko)|New Chronology]], which claims that recorded history actually began around the year 800 AD and all events that allegedly occurred prior to that point either never really happened at all or are simply inaccurate retellings of events that happened later.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Novikov|first=S.

A large number of nationalist pseudohistorical theories deal with the legendary [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of ancient Israel.

===Matriarchy===
{{main|Matriarchy}}
The consensus among academics is that no strictly matriarchal society is known to have existed. <ref>Goldberg, Steven, ''The Inevitability of Patriarchy'' (William Morrow & Co., 1973).</ref><ref>{{harvp|Eller|2000}}</ref> Anthropologist [[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]]'s list of [[cultural universal|human cultural universals]] (''viz.'', features shared by nearly all current human societies) includes men being the "dominant element" in public political affairs,<ref>Brown, Donald E., ''Human Universals'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1991), p.&nbsp;137.</ref> which is the contemporary opinion of mainstream [[anthropology]].<ref name=":0" />  
Some societies that are [[matrilineal]] or [[matrifocal]], but in fact have [[patriarchal]] power structures may be misidentified as matriarchal.
The idea that matriarchal societies existed and they preceded patriarchal societies was first raised in the 19th-century among Western academics, but it has since been discredited.<ref name=":0">"The view of matriarchy as constituting a stage of cultural development now is generally discredited. Furthermore, the consensus among modern anthropologists and sociologists is that a strictly matriarchal society never existed." ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (2007), entry ''Matriarchy''.</ref> 

Despite this however, [[second-wave feminist]]s have asserted the supposed existence of a matriarchy that preceded the patriarchy. The [[Goddess Movement]] 
and Riane Eisler's [[The Chalice and the Blade]] cite [[Venus figurines]] as evidence that societies of [[paleolithic]] and [[neolithic]] Europe  were matriarchies that worshipped a goddess. This belief is not supported by mainstream academics. <ref name="Nelson">Ruth Whitehouse.

===Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories===
{{main|Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact}}
Most theories of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact, excluding the [[Norse colonization of the Americas]], and other reputable scholarship, have been classified as pseudohistory, including claims that the Americas were actually discovered by Arabs or Muslims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/article/23662|title=Did Muslims Visit America Before Columbus?|website=hnn.us}}</ref> [[Gavin Menzies]]' book ''[[1421: The Year China Discovered the World]]'', which argues for the idea that Chinese sailors discovered America, has also been categorized as a work of pseudohistory.<ref name="Fritze"/>{{rp|11}}

===Psychohistory===
{{main|Psychohistory}}
Psychohistory is an amalgam of psychology, history, and related social sciences and the humanities.<ref>Paul H. Elovitz, Ed., ''Psychohistory for the Twenty-First Century'' (2013) p. 1-3. Note that there are varying definitions by accomplished and often distinguished psychohistorians such as Peter Loewenberg (UCLA), Charles B. Strozier (CUNY Graduate School), George Kren (Kansas State University), Bruce Mazlish (MIT), Paul Roazen (York University--Canada), J. Donald Hughes (University of Denver), Vamik Volkan (University of Virginia Medical School), Henry Lawton (Author of ''The Psychohistorians Handbook'', 1988), Jacques Szaluta (US Merchant Marine Academy) and others.</ref> It examines the "why" of history, especially the difference between stated intention and actual behavior. It works to combine the insights of psychology, especially [[psychoanalysis]], with the research methodology of the [[social sciences]] and humanities to understand the emotional origin of the behavior of individuals, groups and nations, past and present.
