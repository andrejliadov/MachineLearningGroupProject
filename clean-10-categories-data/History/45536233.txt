The term '''''Années folles''''' ("crazy years" in French) refers to the decade of the 1920s in [[France]]. It was coined to describe the rich social, artistic, and cultural collaborations of the period.<ref>Andrew Lamb (2000). [https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_c3i0/page/195 ''150 Years of Popular Musical Theatre'']. Yale University Press, p. 195.</ref> The same period is also referred to as the [[Roaring Twenties]] or the [[Jazz Age]] in the [[United States]]. In Germany, it is sometimes referred to as the [[Golden Twenties]] because of the economic boom that followed [[World War I]].

== Precursors ==
[[File:Poster Expo 1925.JPG|upright|thumb|Paris Expo 1925]]

The [[Utopia]]n [[positivism]] of the 19th century and its progressive creed led to unbridled [[individualism]] in France. [[Art nouveau]] extravagance began to evolve into [[Art Deco]] geometry after [[World War I|the First World War]].

[[André Gide]], who founded the ''[[Nouvelle Revue Française]]'' literary review in 1908, influenced [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]]. [[Tristan Tzara]]'s 1918 Dada manifesto and the resulting Dada movement were very much a product of the [[Interwar period|interbellum]]: "Dadaists both embraced and critiqued modernity, imbuing their works with references to the technologies, newspapers, films, and advertisements that increasingly defined contemporary life".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/dada|title=World War I and Dada |series=MoMaLearning|publisher=Museum of Modern Art}}</ref> All these served as the precursors for the ''Années folles.''

== Café society ==

[[File:LaCloseriedesLilas.jpg|thumb|The Closerie des Lilas in 1909.]]

Cafés around Paris became places where artists, writers, and others gathered.  On the [[Rive Gauche]] (left bank) the scene centered around cafés in Montparnasse while on the [[Rive Droite]] (right bank), the Montmartre area.

=== Left bank ===
The ''Années folles'' in [[Montparnasse Quarter|Montparnasse]] featured a thriving art and literary scene centered on cafés such as {{ILL|Brasserie La Coupole|fr|La Coupole (brasserie)}}, [[Le Dôme Café]], [[Café de la Rotonde]], and {{ILL|La Closerie des Lilas|fr}} as well as salons like [[Gertrude Stein]]'s in the {{ILL|Rue de Fleurus|fr|Rue de Fleurus (Paris)|lt=rue de Fleurus}}.

The [[Rive Gauche]], or left bank, of the [[Seine]] in [[Paris]], was and is primarily concerned with the arts and the sciences.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Poirier|first=Agnès|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kR0tDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|title=Left Bank: Art, Passion, and the Rebirth of Paris, 1940-50|date=2018-02-13|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-62779-025-3|language=en}}</ref> Many artists settled there and frequented cabarets like ''[[Le Boeuf sur le Toit]]'' and the large [[brasserie]]s in Montparnasse. American writers of the [[Lost Generation]], like [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]], met and mingled in Paris with exiles from dictatorships in Spain and [[Yugoslavia]].

The painters of the [[School of Paris]] for example included among others [[Chaim Soutine]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Marc Chagall]], Lithuanian, Italian, and Russian, respectively. Later the American [[Henry Miller]], like many other foreigners, gravitated to the {{ILL|Rue Vavin|fr|lt=rue Vavin}} and [[Boulevard Raspail]]. Montparnasse was, he said, "the navel of the world".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bonjourparis.com/history/paris-photographers-brassai-the-transylvanian-eye/|title=Paris Photographers: Brassaï, The Transylvanian Eye|author=Sue Aron|date=6 December 2016|access-date=12 December 2016|publisher=France Media|work=Bonjour Paris}}</ref> [[Gertrude Stein]] also lived in Montparnasse during this period.

===Right bank===
Montmartre was a major center of Paris nightlife and had been famous for its cafés and dance halls since the 1890s. Trumpeter [[Arthur Briggs (musician)|Arthur Briggs]] played at ''L'Abbaye'' and transvestites frequented ''La Petite Chaumière''.<ref>{{cite book|title=La France de 1919 à 1939|author=Fabrice Abbad|publisher=Armand Colin|date=1996|isbn=2200279361}}</ref> After World War I, the artists who had inhabited the [[guinguette]]s and cabarets of Montmartre, invented [[post-Impressionism]] during the ''[[Belle Époque]]''.

In 1926, the facade of the [[Folies Bergère]] building was redone in [[Art Deco]] style by the artist {{ILL|Maurice Pico|fr}}, adding it to the many Parisian theatres of the period in this architectural style.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paris, the Birthplace of Art Deco| url=http://www.minorsights.com/2016/11/France-Paris-art-deco.html|work=Minor Sights|access-date= 12 December 2016}}</ref>

== Art ==

=== Surrealism ===
<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Ubu Imperator.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Max Ernst - ''Ubu Imperator'']] -->
[[File:The Elephant Celebes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[The Elephant Celebes]]'', [[Max Ernst]] 1921.  The [[Tate]], London.]]
[[Surrealism]] came to the forefront in the 1920s cultural scene, bringing new forms of expression to poetry with authors like [[André Breton]], whose ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]'' appeared in 1924, [[Louis Aragon]], [[Paul Éluard]], and [[Robert Desnos]]. Émigré artists had created [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Fauvism]] in Paris before World War I, and included [[Pablo Picasso]], Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani, and [[Piet Mondrian]], along with French artists [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jean Metzinger]], and [[Albert Gleizes]].

Surrealists also included artists like [[Max Ernst]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Salvador Dalí]], and [[Francis Picabia]], sculptors like [[Jean Arp]], [[Germaine Richier]] and even early film-makers, like [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[René Clair]].

=== Avant-garde ===

[[Jean Cocteau]], while he denied belonging to the surrealists, was unquestionably avant-garde and collaborated with many of its members.

== Entertainment ==
[[File:Baker Charleston.jpg| thumb | right | upright | Josephine Baker dancing the Charleston at the [[Folies-Bergere]] in Paris – ''Negro Dance Revue '' (1926).]]
In the 1920s, Parisian nightlife was greatly influenced by American culture. One of its greatest influences was the [[ragtime]] called [[jazz]], which became very popular in Paris. "Ragtimitis" came to Paris with a rendition of "[[The Memphis Blues]]" by a U.S. Army band led by New York Army National Guard Lieutenant [[James Reese Europe]]. The band, known as the [[Harlem Hellfighters]] of the [[369th Infantry Regiment]], "...&nbsp;started ragtimitis in France".<ref name=Scott>

</ref> According to band member [[Noble Sissle]]. It was very successful in 1925 at the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] where the ''Revue Nègre'' also was playing, led first by [[Florence Mills]], known by her stage name as Flossie Mills, and later by [[Josephine Baker]].

In 1926, Baker, an African-American expatriate singer, dancer, and entertainer, caused a sensation at the [[Folies Bergère]]. In a new revue, ''La Folie du Jour'', in which she danced the number "Fatou" wearing a costume revealing all but a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas. Wearing only her [[loincloth]] of bananas, Baker suggestively performed "[[danse sauvage]]" to a [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston tempo]] – a genre still new to Europe. Her French producer Jacques-Charles produced her dance numbers with French preconceptions of eroticized savages in mind.<ref>{{cite book|page=113

</ref> This dance inspired a 1929 [[tempera]] painting titled ''Josephine Baker'', first shown by the painter [[Ivanhoe Gambini]] in an exhibition of the ''Radiofuturista Lombardo'' group he founded.<ref>{{cite book|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rGxhWDcmLGgC&pg=PA138|author=Silvia Vaca|title=The Thirties - The Arts in Italy Beyond Fascism: Cataloghi mostre|editor1=Paolo Rusconi|editor2=Giorgio Zanchetti |publisher=Giunti Editore|isbn=978-8809781443|year=2012}}</ref>

The scandal which erupted over Baker's dancing gave way to enthusiasm and quickly generated excitement among Parisians for [[jazz]] and [[black music]]. The Charleston can be danced solo, in pairs or in groups, to the rhythms of jazz. It is based on the movements of the body weight from one leg to the other, with the feet turned inward and knees slightly bent.

Of all the fashionable [[cabaret]]s, the most famous was called [[Le Boeuf sur le Toit (cabaret)|Le Boeuf sur le Toit]] where the pianist and French composer [[Jean Wiener]] played. Such entertainment reached only a tiny part of the French population, the elite. Nevertheless, it gave the impulse, created the event.

===American influence===
{{see also|Negrophilia}}
American culture of the [[Roaring Twenties]] had a substantial influence on France, which imported jazz, the [[charleston (dance)|Charleston]], and the [[shimmy]], as well as [[cabaret]] and [[nightclub]] dancing.<!-- clarify whether these were imported from the US --> Interest in American culture increased in the Paris of the 1920s, and shows and stars of [[Broadway theatre]] introduced as innovations for the élite and were imitated thereafter.

This was the case for the famous ''Revue Nègre'' in 1925 at the [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]]. [[Josephine Baker]] danced the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] almost naked, with provocative gestures set to music by [[Sidney Bechet]]. Important Paris designers like [[Paul Poiret]] fought to design clothes for her.<ref>{{cite web|page=3|title=Josephine Baker: Image and Icon |publisher=The Sheldon Art Galleries|place=St. Louis|url=http://www.sheldonconcerthall.org/pdf/Baker_Ed_Packet.pdf}}</ref> Inspired and influenced by the [[Second French colonial empire|French Colonial Empire]], Josephine Baker put on ''La Folie du Jour'' in 1926,{{clarify|date=December 2016}} and from the [[café-chantant|cafés chantants]], also successfully picked up popular songs such as {{ILL|La Petite Tonkinoise|fr}} by [[Vincent Scotto]]. In 1927 she starred in the silent film ''[[Siren of the Tropics]]'', which opened to rave reviews. The 1930 song {{ILL|J'ai deux amours|fr}} enshrined Baker as a full-featured star of Parisian nightlife, who not only danced, but also commented on the music and did comedy.

While she appeared at the [[Folies Bergère]], Baker opened her own nightclub, called "Chez Joséphine", in the rue Fontaine.

===Dance===
[[File:Amedeo Modigliani - Paul Guillaume, Novo Pilota - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright |left|Amadeo Modigliani - Paul Guillaume]]

[[Paul Guillaume]] in 1919 organized a "Negro festival" at the Théatre des Champs-Élysées. Six years later, he also produced the Paris ''{{ILL|Revue nègre|fr}}''. On rue Blomet, the ''Bal Nègre'' [[cabaret]] attracted both aesthetes and the curious.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==== Ballets suédois ====
The 1920s also marked a renewal in ballet. The [[Ballets Russes]] were based in Paris during this time. In 1921 the [[Ballets suédois]] offered ''[[L'Homme et son désir]]'' by [[Paul Claudel]], with music by [[Darius Milhaud]]. The company then presented ''[[Les mariés de la tour Eiffel]]'', written by Jean Cocteau. Alas, it did not meet with public success. In 1923 another ballet was born, ''[[La création du monde]]''; [[Darius Milhaud]] wrote the music, and [[Blaise Cendrars]] the scenario. [[Fernand Léger]] designed the costumes and put onto the stage gigantic animals, birds, insects and totemic gods.

The adventure of the [[Ballets suédois]] ended in 1924 with a ballet called ''[[Relâche (ballet)|Relâche]]'' written by [[Erik Satie]] and sets by [[Francis Picabia]].

[[salon (gathering)|Salon gatherings]] were Another important form of entertainment. [[Winnaretta Singer|Princess de Polignac]]'s gatherings continued to be important to avant-garde music. The circles of Madame de [[Anna de Noailles|Noailles]] included Proust, [[Francis Jammes]], [[Colette]], Gide, [[Frédéric Mistral]], [[Robert de Montesquiou]], [[Paul Valéry]], Cocteau, [[Pierre Loti]], [[Paul Hervieu]], and [[Max Jacob]].<!-- needs research: The Count of Beaumont -->

===Music===
[[File:Louis Gaudin - Casino de Paris - Josephine Baker 1930.jpg|upright|right|thumb]]
During this period the [[music hall]] permanently replaced the [[café-chantant]]. People often went to the [[Casino de Paris]], the Paris concert, the [[concert Mayol]] and the theater; spectacles, attractions, and songs occurred at a rapid pace. Artistic productions had a meteoric rise. Some of the best-known examples were American-influenced shows at the [[Casino de Paris]] -- ''Paris qui dance'' (1919), ''Cach' ton piano'' (1920), and ''Paris qui jazz'' (1920–21), ''Mon homme'' and  ''Dans un fauteuil'' gave rise to stardom for [[Maurice Chevalier]] and [[Mistinguett]]. American influences such as [[Musical theatre|musicals]] underlay the success of the [[Folies Bergère]], the famous "Mad Berge", inaugurated with ''Les Folies raging'' in 1922.

A number of classical music composers, such as those of the [[School of Paris]] and [[Les Six]], also flourished at this time. "The musical influence of Paris, dominated first by Debussy and then by Stravinsky, seems to have been almost inescapable for composers in the first four decades of the century."<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgemusicgu0000unse/page/458 458]|title=The Cambridge Music Guide|editor1=Stanley Sadie|editor2=Alison Latham|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521399424|year=2000|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgemusicgu0000unse/page/458}}</ref>

=== Operetta ===

[[Operetta]] had a turning point on {{date | 12 November 1918}} with the premiere of [[Phi-Phi]] by [[Henri Christiné]] and [[Albert Willemetz]]. Up to a thousand performances were played in just two years. <!-- Another great success, [[In life must not do]], (dans la vie faut pas) is not giving an hits --> The popular [[Dédé (opérette)|Dédé]] was staged<!-- ? --> in 1921 by [[Maurice Chevalier]].

Operetta attracted talented composers such as [[Marseille]]'s [[Vincent Scotto]], and also [[Maurice Yvain]] (a composer of Mistinguett's signature song ''[[Mon Homme]]''), and author [[Sacha Guitry]], who wrote the [[libretto]] for ''[[L'amour masqué]]''.

In the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] at the [[Bobino]], the [[Théâtre de la Gaîté-Montparnasse]] showcased [[Marie Dubas]] and [[Georgius]], who inaugurated the Singing Theatre by staging popular songs. From 1926, American titles such as [[No, No, Nanette]], [[Rose-Marie]] and [[Show Boat]] began to be adapted for French viewers.

=== Sports ===
[[File:Desgrange-1892.jpg|thumb| Cyclist [[Henri Desgrange]] in 1922]]
Sports spectacles were also popular during the ''Années folles''. Attendance at sporting venues increased significantly in the years following the war and the press gave sporting events an audience and growing popularity. The newspapers played a significant role in promoting sports through dedicated sports pages, giving popularity to the [[Tour de France]], [[association football|football]] and [[Rugby Union|rugby]]. Moreover, sports, which previously had been limited only to those of affluent backgrounds, now began to extend to the masses. The major sporting event during this decade was [[1924 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games in Paris in 1924]], in which 3,092 athletes from 44 countries participated, and no fewer than {{formatnum: 625000}} spectators attended.

=== Film ===
Silent film, called "cinéma", rose to popularity in the 1920s. Scientists of the time were predicting little future for it.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Silent film is considered by some as the carefree innocence of years or 7th Art.{{clarify|huh?|date=December 2016}} [[Max Linder]], after being discovered by [[Charles Pathé]], became integral in making the film a cultural phenomenon.

European film production almost completely stopped during World War I, as most actors were drafted into the war. The public took refuge in theaters trying to forget the horrors of the front with films such as [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[A Dog's Life]]''. [[Hollywood]] films saw massive growth in demand thanks to a sharp decline in European production; it exported an increasing number of films. In 1919, films from the United States accounted for about 90% of films screened in Europe.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Some films showed the influence of surrealism, with director [[Luis Buñuel]] collaborating with Salvador Dalí on his first short film, ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]''. [[René Clair]]'s silent films blended comedy and fantasy.

=== Theatre ===
In the Paris of the 1920s, the theater was essentially dominated by four directors -- [[Louis Jouvet]], [[Georges Pitoëff]], [[Charles Dullin]] and [[Gaston Baty]]. They decided in 1927 to join efforts to create the "Cartel of Four." However, they had much less success than [[Sacha Guitry]] in [[Théâtre des Variétés]]. There are also parts of [[Alfred Savoir]], comedies of [[Édouard Bourdet]] and those of [[Marcel Pagnol]] that met with some success.

Specifically, the theatrical performance was a great success with audiences and had an undeniable renewal in 1920, first at the stage performance. Around the "Cartel" develops a creative effort to bring in staging the concerns and aspirations of the time. The change is also reflected in the choice of themes and atmosphere that emerges from the works presented. But parallel to this, the educated public is interested elites increasingly to authors and works that combine classical in the form and the opposition reality/dream at the theatrical atmosphere. Also, the theater [[Jean Cocteau]], the first pieces of [[Jean Giraudoux]] such as ''[[Siegfried (play)|Siegfried]]'' in 1928 and the works of Italian [[Luigi Pirandello]] are famous examples that were very successful.{{clarify|date=October 2018}}

In 1920 post-impressionist painter [[Nils Dardel]] and de Maré together created [[Ballets suédois]] at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. In the autumn of 1924, [[Giorgio de Chirico]] curated the scenography and costumes for [[Luigi Pirandello|Pirandello]]'s [[La Giara]].{{where|date=December 2016}}

== The birth of a popular culture ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Along with the elite culture that characterized the 1920s, there arose at the same time in Paris, a popular culture. The [[First World War]] upset many things, even in song.{{clarify|reason=what is meant here?|date=July 2017}} After four years without ''[[Belle Époque]]'', new artists emerged in fashionable places. The music hall, for example, while attracting artists and intellectuals in search of novelty, also gives the popular media. There certainly has the exotic big fees journals [[Moulin Rouge]].

In the same period were the beginnings of [[Maurice Chevalier]], the ultimate illustration of good French mood through one of his songs, "[[Valentine (Maurice Chevalier song)|Valentine]]". The lead dancer [[Mistinguett]], nicknamed'' La Miss,'' had successful popular tunes such as '' Always on the grind'', '' I'm fed up''. <!-- a lot more than this --> All shows, however, does not reduce as the [[Review (theater)|review]].{{clarify|reason=what is meant here?  Sounds like machine translation.|date=July 2017}}

== Fashion and style ==
[[File:Joancrawford3.jpg|thumb|upright| Women's fashion of the year 1927]]

=== The emancipated look ===
The ''garçonne'' ([[flapper]]) look in women's fashion emerged in Paris, promoted especially by [[Coco Chanel]]. The boyish look was characterized by a loose, streamlined, androgynous silhouette where neither the bust nor the waist are evident, accompanied by a short hairdo. It became the symbol of the emancipated woman: free and autonomous, and expressing a new social freedom for a woman—she goes out on the town, smokes, dances, engages in sports or outdoor activities, drives a car, goes on trips—and, flying in the face of moral conventions of the day, she flaunts an extra-marital liaison, perhaps even her homo- or bisexuality, or cohabits openly with a partner.

Also by Chanel, the celebrated [[little black dress]] came out in 1926. A straight sheath with 3/4 sleeves and no collar, the [[crêpe de Chine]] tube all in black (a color previously reserved for bereavement) was the perfect evocation of ''garçonne'' style, erasing the forms of the female body. Copied many times over, this "Ford signed 'Chanel'" as [[Vogue magazine]] dubbed it, referring to the mass-produced American car, would become a classic item of [[1920s in Western fashion|womenswear of the 1920s]] and beyond.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.fidmmuseum.org/museum/2015/06/fundraising-friday-chanels-little-black-dress.html |title=Fundraising Friday: Chanel's Little Black Dress |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=5 June 2015 |website=FIDM Museum |publisher=[[FIDM]] |access-date=2017-02-21 }}</ref>

==Economic growth==
The ''Années folles'' were also a period of strong economic growth. New products and services in booming markets boost the economy: radio, automobile, aviation, oil, electricity. French production of [[hydropower]] increases eightfold during the decade.<ref>[http://www.philisto.fr/cours-82-l-economie-de-guerre-et-ses-consequences-1914-1929.html "The war economy and its consequences (1914–1929)" by Belisaire]</ref> Cheaper electricity favored industrial companies, which in 1928 had three of the top five highest [[market capitalization]]s on the [[Paris stock exchange]] and five out of the top ten, in a decade where total stock market [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] soared by a factor of 4.4.<ref>{{cite book |language=French |title= Histoire de la Bourse |trans-title=History of the Stock Exchange |first1= Paul |last1= Lagneau-Ymonet |first2=Angelo |last2= Riva |publisher=[[La Découverte]] |year= 2011 |page=72 |oclc=779734404 |isbn= 9782707157058}}</ref> The 6th is a young innovative company, which is only fifteen [[Air Liquide]], already has a global stature.

It took 6 years to clear the [[shortage]] of energy caused by the reconstruction of the northern mines, that the Germans had drowned during the [[World War I]].

==Radio==
{{Main|History of Radio}}
[[Broadcasting|Radio]] played a leading role, becoming a preferred vehicle for the new [[mass culture]]. It provided greater information on news and culture to an increasing number of people, especially the working classes. Radio quickly propelled [[Mistinguett]] and [[Maurice Chevalier]] to the rank of national and international stardom, and they quickly become icons of Parisian lifestyle.

==End of an era==
{{Related article | 1930 in France}}
The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] brought an end to the exuberant zeitgeist in the United States, although the crisis didn't actually reach Europe until 1931. In 1928, the Parisian theater [[La Cigale]], then the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] and the [[Moulin Rouge]] suffered the same fate in 1929, being torn down at the end of the decade. Although production was intended for a wide audience, most people attended music halls and other dance halls. Their world of song was primarily that of the street, the [[Java (dance)|javas]] and tangos of [[Ball (dance)|dances]], weddings, and banquets and not of the Parisian high society. Parallel to this culture of elites, at the same time in Paris, existed a popular culture that was increasingly successful and came to dominate the late 1920s and early 1930s through artists such as Maurice Chevalier or Mistinguett.
