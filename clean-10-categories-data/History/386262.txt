{{short description|alleged peace treaty}}
The '''Peace of Callias''' is a purported [[peace treaty]] established around 449 BC between the [[Delian League]] (led by [[Athens]]) and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], ending the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. The peace was agreed as the first compromise treaty between Achaemenid Persia and a Greek city.

The peace was negotiated by [[Callias]], an Athenian politician. Persia had continually lost territory to the [[Greece|Greeks]] after the end of [[Xerxes I]]'s invasion in 479 BC. The exact date of the treaty is debated, although it is usually placed after the [[Battle of the Eurymedon]] in 469 or 466 or the [[Wars of the Delian League|Battle of Cypriot Salamis]] in 450. The Peace of Callias gave autonomy to the [[Ionia]]n states in [[Asia Minor]], prohibited the encroachment of Persian [[satrap]]ies within three days march of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast, and prohibited Persian ships from the Aegean. Athens also agreed not to interfere with Persia's possessions in Asia Minor, [[Cyprus]], [[Libya]] or [[Egypt]]<ref>Diodorus Siculus 12.4</ref> (Athens at that time lost a fleet aiding an Egyptian revolt against Persia<ref>Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, i. 104, and 109-10</ref>).

== Doubts about the existence ==

Our knowledge of the Peace of Callias comes from references by the 4th century BC orators [[Isocrates]] and [[Demosthenes]] as well as the historian [[Diodorus]].<ref>Britannica Online Encyclopedia: ancient Greece (historical region, Eurasia): Peace with Persia</ref> The ancient historian [[Theopompus]] deemed it a fabrication arguing that the inscription of the treaty was a fake – the lettering used hadn't come into practice until half a century after the treaty was purported to have been agreed. It is possible that the treaty never officially existed, and if it was concluded, its importance is disputed. [[Thucydides]] did not mention it, but [[Herodotus]]<ref>Histories, 7.151</ref> says something that may reasonably be construed as supporting its existence, as does [[Plutarch]], who thought it had either been signed after the [[Battle of the Eurymedon]] in 466 BC, or that it had never been signed at all.<ref>Plutarch, Cimon, 13.</ref> In any case, there seems to have been some agreement reached ending hostilities with Persia after 450/449, which allowed Athens to deal with the new threats from the other Greek states such as [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]] and [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], as well as Euboea which rebelled from the Delian League shortly after this. These conflicts may have arisen when Athenian 'allies' felt there was no longer a justification for the [[Delian League]] (which had developed from the [[Sparta]]n-led Hellenic League that defeated Xerxes' invasion), as Persia was apparently no longer a threat. As Athens demanded more and more tribute and exerted more political and economic control over its allies, the League became more of a true empire, and many of Athens' allies began to rebel. Although Callias was also responsible for a peace (the [[Thirty Years' Peace]]) with Sparta in 446&ndash;445 BC, the growing Athenian threat would eventually lead to the [[Peloponnesian War]].

Fighting between the Greeks and the Persians subsided after 450, but Persia continued to meddle in Greek affairs and was to become instrumental in securing a [[Sparta]]n victory in the Peloponnesian War. Nonetheless, it remains a controversial topic among historians and scholars today.
