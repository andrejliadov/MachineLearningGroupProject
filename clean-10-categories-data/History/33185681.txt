'''Centuriation''' (in Latin ''centuriatio'' or, more usually, ''limitatio''<ref>O. A. W. Dilke ''The Roman Land Surveyors'', p. 134, 1992 (1971), {{ISBN|90-256-1000-5}}</ref>), also known as '''Roman grid''', was a method of land measurement used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. In many cases land divisions based on the survey formed a [[field system]], often referred to in modern times by the same name. According to [[O. A. W. Dilke]],<ref>O.A.W.Dilke ''The Roman Land Surveyors'', p. 34, 1992 (1971), {{ISBN|90-256-1000-5}}</ref> centuriation combined and developed features of land surveying present in Egypt, Etruria, Greek towns and Greek countryside.

Centuriation is characterised by the regular layout of a square [[grid plan|grid]] traced using [[Surveying|surveyors']] instruments. It may appear in the form of [[Roman roads|roads]], canals and agricultural plots. In some cases these plots, when formed, were allocated to [[Roman army]] veterans in a new [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], but they might also be returned to the indigenous inhabitants, as at Orange (France).<ref>A. Piganiol, ''Les documents cadastraux de la colonie romaine d'Orange'', XVIe supplément à ''Gallia'', Paris, 1962.</ref>

The study of centuriation is very important for reconstructing [[landscape history]] in many former areas of the [[Roman empire]].

==History==
The Romans began to use centuriation for the foundation, in the fourth century BCE, of new [[Roman colony|colonies]] in the ''ager Sabinus'', northeast of Rome. The development of the geometric and operational characteristics that were to become standard came with the founding of the Roman colonies in the [[Po valley]], starting with ''Ariminum'' ([[Rimini]]) in 268 BCE.<ref>Umberto Laffi ''Studi di storia romana e di diritto'', p. 415, 2001, {{ISBN|88-87114-70-6}}</ref>

The agrarian law introduced by [[Tiberius Gracchus]] in 133 BCE, which included the privatisation of the ''[[ager publicus]]'', gave a great impetus to land division through centuriation.<ref>Umberto Laffi ''op. cit.,'' p. 416, 2001</ref>

Centuriation was used later for [[land reclamation]] and the foundation of new colonies as well as  for the allocation of land to veterans of the many civil wars of the late Republic and early Empire, including the [[battle of Philippi]] in 42 BCE. This is mentioned by [[Virgil]], in his [[Eclogues]], when he complains explicitly about the allocation of his lands near [[Mantua]] to the soldiers who had participated in that battle.

Centuriation was widely used throughout [[Italy]] and also in some provinces. For example, careful analysis has identified, in the area between [[Rome]] and [[Salerno]], 80 different centuriation systems created at different times.<ref>Giacinto Libertini, ''Persistenza di luoghi e toponimi nelle terre delle antiche città di Atella e Acerrae'', 1999</ref>

==System and procedure==
Various land division systems were used, but the most common was known as the ''ager centuriatus'' system.

The surveyor first identified a central viewpoint, the ''umbilicus agri'' or ''umbilicus soli''. He then took up his position there and, looking towards the west, defined the territory with the following names:
* ''ultra'', the land he saw in front of him;
* ''citra'', the land behind him;
* ''dextera'', the land to his right;
* ''sinistra'', the land to his left.

He then traced the grid using an instrument known as a [[Groma surveying|groma]], tracing two road axes  perpendicular to each other:
* the first, generally oriented east-west, was called ''[[decumanus maximus]]'', which was traced taking as reference the place where the sun rose in order to know exactly where east was;<ref>{{cite web | last=Bell | first=Anders | title=Castra et urbs romana: An Examination of the Common Features of Roman Settlements in Italy and the Empire and a System to aid in the Discovery of their Origins. | work=CAC Undergraduate Essay Contest for 2000-2001 | publisher=Classical Association of Canada | year=2001 | url=http://cac-scec.ca/concours_essais/01Bell.html | access-date=2011-10-01 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706170344/http://cac-scec.ca/concours_essais/01Bell.html | archive-date=2011-07-06 | url-status=dead }}</ref>
* the second, with a north-south orientation, was called ''[[cardo maximus]]''.

==Measurement instruments==
* [[Groma surveying|Groma]]
* [[Chorobates]] for levels
* [[Dioptra]] for levels and angles of slopes

==Orientation==

[[File:Centurisation.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Centuriation near [[Cesena]], [[Italy]], in a late nineteenth century Italian military map – Roman grid system]]
It has been suggested that the Roman centuriation system inspired [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s proposal to  create a grid of [[Survey township|townships]] for survey purposes, which ultimately led to the [[United States]] [[Public Land Survey System]]. The similarity of the two systems is empirically obvious in certain parts of Italy, for example, where traces of centuriation have remained.<ref>http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=1451</ref>

However, Thrower points out that, unlike the later US system, ''"not all Roman centuriation displays consistent orientation"''.<ref>Norman Joseph William Thrower, "Maps & civilization: cartography in culture and society", The University of Chicago Press,  Chicago, 1972, p. 25</ref>

This is because, for practical reasons, the orientation of the axes did not always coincide with the four cardinal points and followed instead the orographic features of the area, also taking into account the slope of the land and the flow of rainwater along the drainage channels that were traced (centuriation of [[Florentia]] ([[Florence]]). In other cases, it was based on the orientation of existing lines of communication (centuriation along the [[Via Emilia]]) or other geomorphological features.

Centuriation is typical of flat land, but centuriation systems have also been documented in hilly country.

== Centuriation of the surrounding territory ==
Sometimes the ''umbilicus agri'' was located in a city or a [[castrum]]. This central point was generally referred to as ''groma'', from the name of the instrument used by the ''[[gromatici]]'' (surveyors).

In such cases, the grid was traced by extending the urban ''cardo maximus'' and  the ''decumanus maximus'' through the gates of the city into the surrounding agricultural land.

Parallel secondary roads (''limites quintarii'') were then traced on both sides of the initial axes at intervals of 100 ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|actus]]'' (about 3.5&nbsp;km). The territory was thus divided into square areas.

The road network density was then increased with other roads parallel to those already traced at a distance from each other of 20 ''actus'' (710.40 m). Each of the square areas – 20 × 20 ''actus'' – resulting from this further division was called a ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|centuria]]'' or ''century''.

This dimension of the ''centuria'' became prevalent in the period when the large areas of the Po Valley were delimited, while smaller centuries of 10&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10 ''actus'', as the name ''centuria'' suggests, had formerly been used.<ref>Umberto Laffi ''op. cit.,'' page 415, 2001</ref>

The land was divided after the completion of the roads.

Each century was divided into 10 strips, lying parallel to the ''cardo'' and the ''decumanus'', with  a distance between them of 2 ''actus'' (71.04 m), thus forming 100 squares (''heredia'') of about 0.5 hectares each: 100 ''heredia'' =  1 ''centuria''.

Each ''[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|heredium]]'' was divided in half along the north-south axis thus creating two ''jugera'': one ''[[jugerum]]'', from ''jugum'' (yoke), measured 2523 square metres, which was the amount of land that could be ploughed in one day by a pair of oxen.

==Regions where centuriation was used==
Even today, in some parts of Italy, the landscape of the plain is determined by the outcome of Roman centuriation, with the persistence of straight elements (roads, drainage canals, property divisions) which have survived territorial development and are often basic elements of urbanisation, at least until the twentieth century, when the human pressure of urban growth and infrastructures destroyed many of the traces scattered throughout the agricultural countryside.

===Significant examples of centuriation in Italy===

* [[Cesena]], and in particular the country to the north-east and north-west of the city;
* Central [[Romagna]];
* [[Padua]], eastern area of the province; in this area of [[Veneto|Venetia]], the geometrical layout of the landscape is known as the ''Graticolato Romano'';
* ''Ager Campanus'' (Acerra, Capua, Nola, Atella);
* [[Florence]] ([[Florentia]]), first century CE, in the plain to the west  to [[Prato]] and beyond.
*[[Province of Bergamo]]: There are still several easily identifiable traces, from the low plain almost to the foot of the hills, for example, the straight road of about ten [[kilometre]]s between [[Spirano]]  and [[Stezzano]], through [[Comun Nuovo]]; there are also traces of agricultural centuriation identifiable in the street network of [[Treviglio]].<ref>Maps with text in Italian: http://www.provincia.bergamo.it/provpordocs/D0_02_05.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031703/http://www.provincia.bergamo.it/provpordocs/D0_02_05.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}</ref>
