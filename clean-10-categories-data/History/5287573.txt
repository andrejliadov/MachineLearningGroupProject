'''Adolf Hitler's religious beliefs''' have been a matter of debate. His opinions regarding religious matters changed considerably over time. During the beginning of his political life, Hitler publicly expressed his highly favorable opinions towards Christianity, but progressively distanced himself from it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Steigmann-Gall|first=Richard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RreXLeUG_AIC|title=The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919-1945|date=2003-04-21|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82371-5|language=en|quote=During the Kampfzeit and into the first years of the Third Reich, he maintained - both publicly and privately - that the movement bore some fundamental relationship to Christianity, as witnessed by his repeated intonations of positive Christianity and his repeated reference to the relevance, even priority, of Christian social ideas to his own movement.

Rather, it seems to me that Hitler's religious stance underwent a significant evolution over time, particularly in an external-historical sense but quite possibly internally as well. Before the Beerhall Putsch, Hitler made public statements of devotion to his “Lord and Savior” that would never have been made— either publicly or privately—at a later date. […] At the same time, a shift is already visible in the pages of Mein Kampf away from energetic and open advocacy to a much more subdued tolerance of Christianity, a respect for the institutional strength of the Catholic Church, and a practical desire to avoid interconfessional squabbles within the movement.}}</ref> Some historians describe his later posture as being potentially "anti-Christian".<ref name="Bundle62">* [[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler: a Study in Tyranny''; Harper Perennial Edition 1991; p. 219: "Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organization and power of the Church...

* [[Hitler's Table Talk]]: "The dogma of Christianity gets worn away before the advances of science. Religion will have to make more and more concessions. Gradually the myths crumble. All that's left is to prove that in nature there is no frontier between the organic and the inorganic. When understanding of the universe has become widespread, when the majority of men know that the stars are not sources of light but worlds, perhaps inhabited worlds like ours, then the Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity."</ref> He also criticized atheism.<ref name="weikart22">{{cite book|last=Weikart|first=Richard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnJIDQAAQBAJ|title=Hitler's Religion: The Twisted Beliefs that Drove the Third Reich|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=2016|isbn=978-1621575511|location=[[New York City|New York]]|page=unpaginated|quote=It's true that Hitler's ''public'' statements opposing atheism should not be given too much weight, since they obviously served Hitler's political purposes to tar political opponents. However, in his private monologues, he likewise rejected atheism, providing further evidence that this was indeed his personal conviction. In July 1941, he told his colleagues that humans do not really know where the laws of nature come from. He continued, "Thus people discovered the wonderful concept of the Almighty, whose rule they venerate. We do not want to train people in atheism." He then maintained that every person has a consciousness of what we call God. This God was apparently not the Christian God preached in the churches, however, since Hitler continued, "In the long run National Socialism and the church cannot continue to exist together." The monologue confirms that Hitler rejected atheism, but it also underscores the vagueness of his conception of God. [...] While confessing faith in an omnipotent being of some sort, however, Hitler denied we could know anything about it. [...] Despite his suggestion that God is inscrutable and unfathomable, Hitler did sometimes claim to know something about the workings of Providence. [...] Perhaps even more significantly, he had complete faith that Providence had chosen him to lead the German people to greatness.|author-link=Richard Weikart}}</ref>

Hitler's regime launched an effort toward coordination of German Protestants under a unified [[Protestant Reich Church]] (but this was resisted by the [[Confessing Church]]), and moved early to eliminate [[political Catholicism]].<ref name="Ian Kershaw p.290">Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler a Biography''; 2008 Edn; W.

==Historiography==
[[Alan Bullock]] wrote that Hitler had been raised Catholic, whom though impressed by its organizational powers, repudiated Christianity on what he considered to be rational and moral grounds.<ref name="Hitler p219">[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; Harper Perennial Edition, 1991; p. 219."</ref> Bullock wrote that Hitler believed neither in "God nor conscience", but found both "justification and absolution" in a view of himself echoing [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s view that heroes were above conventional morality, and that the role of "world-historical individuals" as the agents by which the "Will of the World Spirit", the plan of Providence is carried out. Following his early military successes, Hitler "abandoned himself entirely to [[megalomania]]" and the "sin of ''[[Hubris|hybris]]''", an exaggerated self-pride, believing himself to be more than a man.<ref name="auto">[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'', Harper Perennial Edition 1991, p. 216.</ref> Once the war was over, wrote Bullock, Hitler wanted to root out and destroy the influence of the churches, though until then he would be circumspect for political reasons:<ref name="Hitler p219"/>

{{quotation|In Hitler's eyes, Christianity was a religion fit only for slaves; he detested its ethics in particular. Its teaching, he declared, was a rebellion against the natural law of selection by struggle and the survival of the fittest.|[[Alan Bullock]], ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]''}}

At the turn of the century, leading Hitler expert<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2045979.stm Sir Ian Kershaw: Dissecting Hitler]; BBC News; 14 June 2002.</ref> [[Ian Kershaw]] wrote an influential biography of Hitler which used new sources to expound on Hitler's religious views. He too concluded that Hitler was anti-Christian but spiritual:

{{quotation|...making the German Army ‘into the first army in the world, in training, in the raising of units, in armaments, and, above all, in spiritual education (in der geistigen Erziehung)’ was vital. If this did not happen,
then ‘Germany will be lost,’ [Hitler] declared.|[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler 1936–1945: Nemesis''<ref name="Ian Kershaw pp.20">Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler 1936–1945 Nemesis''; WW Norton & Company; 2000; pp. 20</ref>}}

{{quotation|However much Hitler on some occasions claimed to want a respite in the conflict [with the churches], his own inflammatory comments gave his underlings all the license they needed to turn up the heat on the 'Church Struggle', confident that they were working towards the Fuhrer...Hitler's impatience with the churches prompted frequent outbursts of hostility. In early 1937, he was declaring that 'Christianity was ripe for destruction' (''Untergang''), and that the churches must therefore yield to the 'primacy of the state', railing against 'the most horrible institution imaginable'|[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler 1936–1945: Nemesis''<ref name="Ian Kershaw pp.39-40">Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler 1936–1945 Nemesis''; WW Norton & Company; 2000; pp. 39–40</ref>}}

British historian [[Richard J. Evans]], who writes primarily on Nazi Germany and World War II, noted Hitler claiming that Nazism is founded on science: "Science, he declared, would easily destroy the last remaining vestiges of superstition' Germany could not tolerate the intervention of foreign influences such as the Pope and 'Priests', he said, were 'black bugs', 'abortions in black cassocks'."<ref>Richard J. Evans; ''The Third Reich at War''; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p. 547</ref>

British historian [[Richard Overy]], biographer of Hitler, sees Hitler as having been a skeptic of religion: "Both Stalin and Hitler wanted a neutered religion, subservient to the state, while the slow programme of scientific revelation destroyed the foundation of religious myth."<ref>[[Richard Overy|Overy, Richard]] (2004) ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''. Allen Lane/Penguin. pp. 281, 287</ref> Overy writes of Hitler as skeptical of all religious belief, but politically prudent enough not to "trumpet his scientific views publicly", partly in order to maintain the distinction between his own movement and the godlessness of Soviet Communism .<ref name="The Third Reich p.99">[[Richard Overy]]; ''The Third Reich, A Chronicle''; Quercus; 2010; p. 99</ref>  In 2004, he wrote:<ref>[[Richard Overy|Overy, Richard]] (2004)''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''. Allen Lane/Penguin. pp. 280–281</ref>

{{quotation|He was not a practising Christian but had somehow succeeded in masking his own religious skepticism from millions of German voters. Though Hitler has often been portrayed as a neo-pagan, or the centrepiece of a political religion in which he played the Godhead, his views had much more in common with the revolutionary iconoclasm of the Bolshevik enemy. His few private remarks on Christianity betray a profound contempt and indifference&nbsp;... Hitler believed that all religions were now 'decadent'; in Europe it was the 'collapse of Christianity that we are now experiencing'. The reason for the crisis was science. Hitler, like Stalin took a very modern view of the incompatibility of religious and scientific explanation.|[[Richard Overy]], ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''}}

Historian [[Percy Ernst Schramm]], describes Hitler's personal religious creed, after his rejection of the Christian beliefs of his youth, as "a variant of the [[monism]] so common before the First World War".<ref name=schramm /> According to Schramm, these views were indirectly influenced by the work of [[Ernst Haeckel]] and his disciple, Wilhelm Bölsche.<ref name=schramm2 />

Schramm quotes Dr. Hanskarl von Hasselbach, one of Hitler's personal physicians, as saying that Hitler was a "religious person, or at least one who was struggling with religious clarity". According to von Hasselbach, Hitler did not share [[Martin Bormann]]'s conception that Nazi ceremonies could become a substitute for church ceremonies, and was aware of the religious needs of the masses. "He went on for hours discussing the possibility of bridging the confessional division of the German people and helping them find a religion appropriate to their character and modern man's understanding of the world."<ref name=schramm2 />

Hitler's personal conception of God was as "Providence" ([[divine providence]]).  For instance, when he survived the assassination attempt of [[20 July plot|July 20, 1944]], he ascribed it to Providence saving him to pursue his tasks. In fact, as time went on, Hitler's conception of Providence became more and more intertwined with his belief in his own inability to make an error of judgment. [[Alfred Jodl]] stated at Nuremberg that Hitler had "an almost mystical conviction of his infallibility as leader of the nation and of the war". Another of his physicians, Dr. Karl Brandt, said that Hitler saw himself as a "tool of Providence.  He was&nbsp;... consumed by the desire to give the German people everything and to help them out of their distress. He was possessed by the thought that this was his task and that only he could fulfill it."<ref name=schramm2 />

BBC historian [[Laurence Rees]] characterises Hitler's relationship to religion as one of opportunism and pragmatism: "his relationship in public to Christianity—indeed his relationship to religion in general—was opportunistic. There is no evidence that Hitler himself, in his personal life, ever expressed any individual belief in the basic tenets of the Christian church".<ref name="ReferenceB">Laurence Rees; ''The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler''; Ebury Press; 2012; p. 135.</ref> Considering the religious allusions found in ''Mein Kampf'', Rees writes that "the most coherent reading of ''Mein Kampf''" is that Hitler was prepared to believe in an initial creator God, but did "not accept the conventional Christian vision of heaven and hell, nor the survival of an individual 'soul'."<ref name="auto3">Laurence Rees; ''The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler''; Ebury Press; 2012; p. 135</ref>

[[Max Domarus]] has written that Hitler replaced belief in the Judeo-Christian God with belief in a peculiarly German "god".<ref name="p. 21"/> He promoted the idea of this god as the creator of Germany, but Hitler "was not a Christian in any accepted meaning of that word."<ref name="HitlerDomarus2007_427">Domarus, 2007, p. 427</ref> Domarus writes that Hitler neither believed in organized religion nor saw himself as a religious reformer.<ref name="HitlerDomarus2007_427"/> Hitler had fully discarded belief in the Judeo-Christian conception of God by 1937, writes Domarus, but continued to use the word "God" in speeches&nbsp;— but it was not the God "who has been worshiped for millennia", but a new and peculiarly German "god" who "let iron grow". Thus Hitler told the British journalist Ward Price in 1937: "I believe in God, and I am convinced that He will not desert 67 million Germans who have worked so hard to regain their rightful position in the world."<ref name="p. 21"/>

Although Hitler did not "abide by its commandments", Domarus believed that he retained elements of the Catholic thinking of his upbringing even into the initial years of his rule: "As late as 1933, he still described himself publicly as a Catholic. Only the spreading poison of his lust for power and self idolatry finally crowded out the memories of childhood beliefs and in 1937 he jettisoned the last of his personal religious convictions, declaring to comrades, 'Now I feel as fresh as a colt in the pasture'".<ref name="p. 21">Max Domarus (2007).

Knopf, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_v59p5CDNa8C&pg=PA100 p. 100.]</ref> Derek Hastings considers it "eminently plausible" that Hitler was a believing Catholic as late as his trial in 1924, but writes that "there is little doubt that Hitler was a staunch opponent of Christianity throughout the duration of the Third Reich".<ref>Hastings, Derek (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XfQFr0TiLJcC Catholicism and the Roots of Nazism]''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 181.</ref>

The biographer [[John Toland (author)|John Toland]], recounts that in the aftermath of an attempted assassination in 1939, Hitler told dinner guests that [[Pope Pius XII]] would rather have seen the "plot succeed" and "was no friend of mine", but also writes that in 1941 Hitler was still "a member in good standing of the Church of Rome despite his detestation of its hierarchy"<ref>John Toland. (1976). ''Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography''. New York: Anchor Books, pp. 589, 703.</ref> According to [[Guenter Lewy]], Hitler was not [[excommunication|excommunicated]] from the Catholic Church prior to his [[death of Adolf Hitler|death]].<ref>[[Guenter Lewy]]; ''[[Guenter Lewy#The Catholic Church and Nazi Germany|The Catholic Church And Nazi Germany]]''; 1964; p. 303</ref> Yet, these authors seem to have missed the fact that Hitler was in fact excommunicated, along with all other Nazi leaders, in 1931.<ref>Scholder, Klaus, ''The Churches and the Third Reich''. 2 vols. Fortress Press, 1988 pp. 150-162</ref> Although he had received the Catholic sacraments of Baptism, and Confirmation as an infant, there is little evidence he considered himself subject to the teaching of the Church from adolescence onward, whatever cultural affiliation he claimed, and the excommunication would have meant nothing to him.

[[Samuel Koehne]] of [[Deakin University]] wrote in 2012: "Was Hitler an atheist? Probably not. But it remains very difficult to ascertain his personal religious beliefs, and the debate rages on." While Hitler was emphatically not "Christian" by the traditional or orthodox notion of the term, he did speak of a deity whose work was nature and natural laws, "conflating God and nature to the extent that they became one and the same thing" and that "For this reason, some recent works have argued Hitler was a Deist".<ref name="Koehne"/> In his writings on Hitler's recurrent religious images and symbols, [[Kenneth Burke]] concluded that "Hitler's modes of thought are nothing more than perverted or caricatured forms of religious thought".<ref name="McKnightHughes2001">{{cite book|author1=Stephen McKnight|author2=Glenn Hughes|author3=Geoffrey Price|title=Politics, Order and History: Essays on the Work of Eric Voegelin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NeorjnI4VBcC&q=friedrich%20heer%20hitler%20political%20religiosity&pg=PA86|date=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-84127-159-0|page=86}}</ref>

==Hitler's contemporaries on his religious beliefs==

===Speer on Hitler's religious beliefs===

In his memoirs, Hitler's confidant, personal architect, and Minister of Armaments [[Albert Speer]], wrote: "Amid his political associates in Berlin, Hitler made harsh pronouncements against the church", yet "he conceived of the church as an instrument that could be useful to him":<ref name="pp 95–96">''[[Inside the Third Reich|Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs]]''. New York: Simon and Schuster, [https://archive.org/details/insidethirdreich00albe/page/96 pp. 95–96.]</ref>

{{quotation|Around 1937, when Hitler heard that at the instigation of the party and the SS vast numbers of his followers had left the church because it was obstinately opposing his plans, he nevertheless ordered his chief associates, above all Goering and Goebbels, to remain members of the church. He too would remain a member of the Catholic Church he said, although he had no real attachment to it. And in fact he remained in the church until his [[death of Adolf Hitler|suicide]].|Extract from ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'', the memoir of [[Albert Speer]]}}

The [[Goebbels Diaries]] also remark on this policy. Goebbels wrote on 29 April 1941 that though Hitler was "a fierce opponent" of the Vatican and Christianity, "he forbids me to leave the church. For tactical reasons."<ref name="Fred Taylor Translation p.340"/>

According to Speer, Hitler's private secretary, [[Martin Bormann]], relished recording any harsh pronouncements by Hitler against the church.<ref name="p. 95">Speer, Albert (1971). ''Inside the Third Reich: Memoirs''. New York: Simon and Schuster. [https://archive.org/details/insidethirdreich00albe/page/96 p. 95.] {{ISBN|978-0-684-82949-4}}.</ref> Speer considered Bormann to be the driving force behind the regime's campaign against the churches.

Hitler, wrote Speer, viewed Christianity as the wrong religion for the "Germanic temperament":<ref name="pp 95–96"/> Speer wrote that Hitler would say: "You see, it's been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn't we have [[Shinto|the religion]] of the [[Japanese people|Japanese]], who regard sacrifice for the fatherland as the highest good? The [[Islam]] too would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?"<ref>Speer, Albert (1971).

===Bormann on Hitler's religious beliefs===

[[Martin Bormann]], who was serving as Hitler's private secretary, persuaded Hitler to allow a team of specially picked officers to record in [[shorthand]] his private conversations for posterity.<ref name="Trevor-Roper2000vii">Trevor-Roper, H.R.

The widespread consensus among historians is that the views expressed in [[Trevor-Roper]]'s translation of ''Table Talk'', are credible and reliable, although as with all historical sources, a high level of critical awareness about its origins and purpose are advisable.<ref name="Kershaw">{{cite book|title=Hitler 1889-1936: Hubris|last=Kershaw|first=Ian|publisher=Penguin|year=2001|isbn=978-0-14-013363-9|location=London|pages=xiv}}</ref> The remarks from ''Table Talk'' accepted as genuine include such quotes as "Christianity is the prototype of Bolshevism: the mobillization by the Jew of the masses of slaves with the object of undermining society."<ref>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|title=The Third Reich at War: How the Nazis led Germany from conquest to disaster|year=2008|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-101548-4|pages=547 (546–9)}}</ref> Alan Bullock's seminal biography ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]'' quotes Hitler as saying, "Taken to its logical extreme, Christianity would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure"; found also in ''Table Talk'',{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=55}} and repeats other views appearing in ''Table Talk'' such as: the teachings of Christianity are a rebellion against the natural law of selection by struggle and survival of the fittest.<ref name="Hitler p.216 & 219">See Alan Bullock; [[Hitler: a Study in Tyranny]]; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219 & {{harvnb|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=51}}</ref>

[[Michael Burleigh]] contrasted Hitler's public pronouncements on Christianity with those in ''Table Talk'', suggesting that Hitler's real religious views were "a mixture of materialist biology, a faux-[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] contempt for core, as distinct from secondary, Christian values, and a visceral anti-clericalism."<ref>{{cite book|last=Burleigh|first=Michael|title=The Third Reich - A New History|year=2001|publisher=Pan Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-330-48757-3|pages=716–717}}</ref> Richard Evans also reiterated the view that Nazism was secular, scientific and anti-religious in outlook in the last volume of his trilogy on Nazi Germany: "Hitler's hostility to Christianity reached new heights, or depths, during the war;" his source for this was the 1953 English translation of ''Table Talk''.<ref name="Evans 2008 547–8">{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|title=The Third Reich at War: How the Nazis led Germany from conquest to disaster|year=2008|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-101548-4|pages=547–8}}</ref> ''Table Talk'' has the dictator often voicing stridently negative views of Christianity, such as: "The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. [[Bolshevism]] is Christianity's illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew. The deliberate lie in the matter of religion was introduced into the world by Christianity."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=8}}

Transcripts contained in ''Table Talk'' have Hitler expressing favor towards science over Christianity. On 14 October 1941, in an entry concerning the fate of Christianity, Hitler says: "Science cannot lie, for it's always striving, according to the momentary state of knowledge, to deduce what is true. When it makes a mistake, it does so in good faith. It's Christianity that's the liar. It's in perpetual conflict with itself."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=48}} Religion will crumble before scientific advances, says Hitler: "The dogma of Christianity gets worn away before the advances of science. Religion will have to make more and more concessions. Gradually the myths crumble. All that's left is to prove that in nature there is no frontier between the organic and the inorganic. When understanding of the universe has become widespread, when the majority of men know that the stars are not sources of light but worlds, perhaps inhabited worlds like ours, then the Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|pp=59–61}}

Hitler feared the collapse of the pact with churches, leading to conversion to atheism, which he equates to "the state of the animal": "I'm convinced that any pact with the Church can offer only a provisional benefit, for sooner or later the scientific spirit will disclose the harmful character of such a compromise. Thus the State will have based its existence on a foundation that one day will collapse. An educated man retains the sense of the mysteries of nature and bows before the unknowable. An uneducated man, on the other hand, runs the risk of going over to atheism (which is a return to the state of the animal) as soon as he perceives that the State, in sheer opportunism, is making use of false ideas in the matter of religion, whilst in other fields it bases everything on pure science. That's why I've always kept the Party aloof from religious questions."<ref name="tabletalktrevorroper2000">Trevor-Roper, Hugh, ed (2000). ''Hitler's Table Talk 1941–1944''. Trans. N. Cameron and R.

According to ''Table Talk'', Hitler believed that Jesus' true Christian teachings had been corrupted by the [[apostle (Christian)|apostle]] [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]], who had transformed them into a kind of Jewish [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]], which Hitler believed preached "the equality of all men amongst themselves, and their obedience to an only god. This is what caused the death of the Roman Empire."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=76}}{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|pp=721–722}}

In ''Table Talk'', Hitler praised [[Julian the Apostate]]'s ''[[Libri tres contra Galileos|Three Books Against the Galilaeans]]'', an anti-Christian tract from [[Anno Domini|AD]] 362, in the entry dated 21 October 1941, stating: "When one thinks of the opinions held concerning Christianity by our best minds a hundred, two hundred years ago, one is ashamed to realise how little we have since evolved. I didn't know that Julian the Apostate had passed judgment with such clear-sightedness on Christianity and Christians. ... Originally, Christianity was merely an incarnation of Bolshevism the destroyer. Nevertheless, the Galilean, who later was called the Christ, intended something quite different. He must be regarded as a popular leader who took up His position against Jewry.... and it's certain that Jesus was not a Jew. The Jews, by the way, regarded Him as the son of a whore—of a whore and a Roman soldier. The decisive falsification of Jesus's doctrine was the work of St. Paul. He gave himself to this work with subtlety and for purposes of personal exploitation. For the Galilean's object was to liberate His country from Jewish oppression. He set Himself against Jewish capitalism, and that's why the Jews liquidated Him. Paul of Tarsus (his name was Saul, before the road to Damascus) was one of those who persecuted Jesus most savagely."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=76}}

Richard Carrier made some isolated comparisons of passages from the German, French and English editions of Table Talk, and found in each case that the English edition by Trevor-Roper was a translation of the French edition by Francois Genoud, rather than from the German editions; and also that the French translation contained significant distortions, which generally heightened the impression of Hitler's hatred for Christianity. Carrier concluded that "the Trevor-Roper edition is to be discarded as worthless." However, Carrier found that three German versions "have a common ancestor, which must be the actual bunker notes themselves", and recommended that scholars needed to work directly with the German editions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carrier|first=Richard|date=2003|title=Hitler's Table Talk: Troubling Finds|jstor=1432747|journal=German Studies Review|volume=26|issue=3|pages=561–576|doi=10.2307/1432747}}</ref>

In his introduction to a 2013 edition of Trevor-Roper's ''Table Talk'', Gerhard Reinberg agreed that the Trevor-Roper edition "derives from Genoud's French edition and not from either of the German texts."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIbqZ_F5UhkC|title=Hitler's Table Talk 1941-1944: Secret Conversations|last1=Trevor-Roper|first1=Hugh Redwald|last2=Weinberg|first2=Gerhard L.|date=2013-10-18|publisher=Enigma Books|isbn=9781929631667|page=xi|language=en}}</ref> After examining Trevor-Roper's personal correspondence and papers, Mikael Nilsson concluded that Trevor-Roper was fully aware of the fact that his edition was based on the French text, but failed to reveal the problems in public.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nilsson|first=Mikael|date=2016-03-10|title=Hugh Trevor-Roper and the English editions of Hitler's Table Talk and Testament|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-260927|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=51|issue=4|language=en|pages=788–812|doi=10.1177/0022009415619689|issn=0022-0094|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Goebbels on Hitler's religious beliefs===

The ''[[Goebbels Diaries]]'', written by Hitler's Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]], provide important insights into Hitler's thinking and actions.<ref>Ian Kershaw; Hitler 1889-1936 Hubris; Allen Lane/Penguin Press; 1998 p. xii</ref> In a diary entry of 28 December 1939, Goebbels wrote that "the Fuhrer passionately rejects any thought of founding a religion.

In 1937, Goebbels noted that Hitler's impatience with the churches "prompted frequent outbursts of hostility. In early 1937 he was declaring that 'Christianity was ripe for destruction', and that the Churches must yield to the "primacy of the state", railing against any compromise with "the most horrible institution imaginable".<ref name="Ian Kershaw pp. 295–297">Ian Kershaw; 'Hitler: a Biography''; Norton; 2008 ed; pp. 295–297:  "In early 1937 [Hitler] was declaring that 'Christianity was ripe for destruction', and that the Churches must yield to the 'primacy of the state', railing against any compromise with 'the most horrible institution imaginable'"</ref> In his entry for 29 April 1941, Goebbels noted long discussions about the Vatican and Christianity, and wrote: "The Fuhrer is a fierce opponent of all that humbug".<ref name="Fred Taylor Translation p.340"/>

In 1939, Goebbels wrote that the Fuhrer knew that he would "have to get around to a conflict between church and state" but that in the meantime "The best way to deal with the churches is to claim to be a 'positive Christian'."<ref name="Fred Taylor Translation p.76"/>

In another entry, Goebbels wrote that Hitler was "deeply religious but entirely anti-Christian".<ref>Bonney, Richard (2009).

Otto Strasser was a German politician and an early member of the Nazi Party, he together with his brother Gregor Strasser, was a leading member of the party's left-wing faction. "Despite the fact that Hitler never renounced his membership in the Catholic Church, before he seized power in 1933 and for about two months thereafter", wrote Weikart, during the conversation with his brother in 1920, Strasser stated that he was disappointed with Hitler because:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hitler's Religion|last=Weikart|first=Richard|publisher=Regenery History|year=2016|isbn=9781621575009|pages=XI}}</ref>

The [[Anschluss]] saw the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in early 1938. The Austrian chancellor, [[Kurt von Schuschnigg]], had traveled to Germany to meet Hitler, who, according to Schuschnigg's later testimony, went into a threatening rage against the role of Austria in German history, saying, "Every national idea was sabotaged by Austria throughout history; and indeed all this sabotage was the chief activity of the Habsburgs and the Catholic Church." This ended in Hitler's ultimatum to end Austrian independence and hand the nation to the Nazis.<ref>William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; pp. 325–329.</ref>

Following the 1944 assassination attempt in the "[[20 July plot]]", Hitler credited his survival to fate in a radio broadcast the following day. German deputy press chief [[Helmut Suendermann]] declared, "The German people must consider the failure of the attempt on Hitler's life as a sign that Hitler will complete his tasks under the protection of a divine power".<ref>BBC News (1944-07-20) Hitler survives assassination attempt. http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/20/newsid_3505000/3505014.stm</ref>

Following a meeting with Hitler, Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]], a man who had "courageously criticized the Nazi attacks on the Catholic Church—went away convinced that Hitler was deeply religious", noted Kershaw.<ref name="Ian Kershaw p. 373"/> In November 1936 the Roman Catholic prelate met Hitler at [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] for a three-hour meeting. He left the meeting and wrote "The Reich Chancellor undoubtedly lives in belief in God. He recognises Christianity as the builder of Western culture".<ref>Hitler, Ian Kershaw, p. 373, 2008, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0-14-103588-8}}</ref> 
Kershaw cites Faulhaber's case as an example of Hitler's ability to "pull the wool over the eyes of even hardened critics", demonstrating Hitler's "evident ability to simulate, even to potentially critical church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity".<ref name="Kershaw109">Kershaw, Ian (2001).

Adolf Hitler was raised in a Roman Catholic family in Habsburg Austria. However, reliable historical details on his childhood are scarce. According to Hitler historian [[Ian Kershaw]], the reflections Hitler provided on his own life in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' are "inaccurate in detail and coloured in interpretation", while information that was given during the Nazi period is "dubious", as can be the postwar recollections of family and acquaintances.<ref name="Ian Kershaw p.3">Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler a Biography''; 2008 ed; Norton; London; p. 3</ref>

===Adulthood and political career===

====Hitler's public rhetoric and writings about religion====

Hitler's public utterances were peppered with references to "God" and "Spirit".<ref>Richard Overy: The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004.p.281</ref><ref>"Hitler wusste selber durch die ständige Anrufung des Herrgotts oder der Vorsehung den Eindruck gottesfürchtiger Denkart zu machen." J. C. Fest. ''Hitler''. (German edition), p. 581.</ref>  In ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]'', Bullock wrote that Hitler, like [[Napoleon]] before him, frequently employed the language of "[[divine providence]]" in defence of his own personal myth, but ultimately shared with the Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]] "the same materialist outlook, based on the nineteenth century rationalists' certainty that the progress of science would destroy all myths and had already proved Christian doctrine to be an absurdity":<ref name="Stalin pp.413">[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''; Fontana Press; 1993; p. 412-413</ref>

{{quotation|Hitler's own myth had to be protected, and this led him, like Napoleon, to speak frequently of Providence, as a necessary if unconscious projection of his sense of destiny which provided him with both justification and absolution. 'The Russians', he remarked on one occasion 'were entitled to attack their priests, but they had no right to assail the idea of a supreme force. It's a fact that we're feeble creatures and that a creative force exists'".|Excerpt from ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]'' by Alan Bullock}}

Hitler had an "ability to simulate, even to potentially critical Church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity [from Bolshevism]" wrote Kershaw, which served to deflect direct criticism of him from Church leaders, who instead focused their condemnations on the known "anti-Christian party radicals".<ref>{{Harvnb|Kershaw|1987|p=109}}{{quote|"Hitler's evident ability to simulate, even to potentially critical Church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity was crucial to the mediation of such an image to the church-going public by influential members of both major denominations. It was the reason why church-going Christians, so often encouraged by their 'opinion-leaders' in the Church hierarchies, were frequently able to exclude Hitler from their condemnation of the anti-Christian Party radicals, continuing to see in him the last hope of protecting Christianity from Bolshevism."}}</ref>

=====Religion in ''Mein Kampf''=====
''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1924–25), written while Hitler was in prison after his failed 1923 putsch, contains numerous references to "God", "the Creator", "Providence" and "the Lord".<ref name="Mein Kampf pp. 307"/><ref name="Mein Kampf pp. 65">Hitler, Adolf (1999) ''Mein Kampf''. Trans. Ralph Manheim. New York: Mariner Books, p. 65.</ref><ref name="Mein Kampf pp. 562"/><ref name="MeinKampf"/>

[[Laurence Rees]] described the thrust of the work as "bleak [[nihilism]]" revealing a cold universe with no moral structure other than the fight between different people for supremacy: "What's missing from ''Mein Kampf''", wrote Rees—"and this is a fact that has not received the acknowledgement it should—is any emphasis on Christianity"—though Germany, Rees noted, had been Christian for a thousand years. So, concluded Rees, "the most coherent reading of ''Mein Kampf'' is that whilst Hitler was prepared to believe in an initial creator God, he did not accept the conventional Christian vision of heaven and hell, nor the survival of an individual "soul"&nbsp;... we are animals and just like animals we face the choice of destroying or being destroyed."<ref name="auto3"/>

Paul Berben wrote that insofar as the Christian denominations were concerned, Hitler declared himself to be neutral in Mein Kampf—but argued for clear separation of church and state, and for the church not to concern itself with the earthly life of the people, which must be the domain of the state.<ref name="Paul Berben p. 138"/> According to [[William Shirer]], Hitler "inveighed against political Catholicism in ''Mein Kampf'' and attacked the two main Christian churches for their failure to recognise the racial problem", while also warning that no political party could succeed in "producing a religious reformation".<ref name="William L. Shirer p. 234"/>

In ''Mein Kampf'' Hitler wrote that Jesus "made no secret of his attitude toward the Jewish people, and when necessary he even took the whip to drive from the temple of the Lord this adversary of all humanity, who then as always saw in religion nothing but an instrument for his business existence. In return, Christ was nailed to the cross."<ref name="Mein Kampf pp. 307">Hitler, Adolf (1998). ''Mein Kampf''. Trans. Ralph Manheim. New York: Houghton Mifflin, p. 307.</ref>

Hitler wrote of the importance of a definite and uniformly accepted ''Weltanschauung'' (world view), and noted that the diminished position of religion in Europe had led to a decline in necessary certainties—"yet this human world of ours would be inconceivable without the practical existence of religious belief". The various substitutes hitherto offered could not "usefully replace the existing denominations".<ref name="Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf">{{cite web|title=Mein Kampf|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200601.txt|website=gutenberg.net.au|publisher=Project Gutenberg Australia|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref>

{{quotation|The political leader should not estimate the worth of a religion by taking some of its shortcomings into account, but he should ask himself whether there be any practical substitute in a view which is demonstrably better. Until such a substitute be available, only fools and criminals would think of abolishing existing religion.|Adolf Hitler, ''[[Mein Kampf]]''}}

Examining how to establish a new order, Hitler argued that the greatness of powerful organizations was reliant on intolerance of all others, so that the greatness of Christianity arose from the "unrelenting and fanatical proclamation and defence of its own teaching". Hitler rejected a view that Christianity brought civilization to the Germanic peoples, however: "It is therefore outrageously unjust to speak of the pre-Christian Germans as barbarians who had no civilization. They never have been such." Foreshadowing his conflict with the Catholic Church over [[euthanasia in Nazi Germany]], Hitler wrote that the churches should give up missionary work in Africa, and concentrate on convincing Europeans that is more pleasing to God if they adopt orphans rather than "give life to a sickly child that will be a cause of suffering and unhappiness to all".<ref name="Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf"/> The Christian churches should forget about their own differences and focus on the issue of "racial contamination", he declared.<ref name="Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf"/>

{{quotation|The two Christian denominations look on with indifference at the profanation and destruction of a noble and unique creature who was given to the world as a gift of God's grace. For the future of the world, however, it does not matter which of the two triumphs over the other, the Catholic or the Protestant. But it does matter whether Aryan humanity survives or perishes.|Adolf Hitler, ''Mein Kampf''}}

When he arrived in [[Vienna]] as a young man, Hitler claimed, he was not yet anti-Semitic: "In the Jew I still saw only a man who was of a different religion, and therefore, on grounds of human tolerance, I was against the idea that he should be attacked because he had a different faith."<ref>Hitler, Adolf (1999) ''Mein Kampf''. Trans. Ralph Manheim. New York: Mariner Books, p. 52.</ref> He thought that anti-Semitism based on religious, rather than racial grounds, was a mistake: "The anti-Semitism of the Christian-Socialists was based on religious instead of racial principles." Instead, Hitler argued that Jews should be deplored on the basis of their "race".<ref>[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200601.txt Mein Kampf]</ref>

In an attempt to justify Nazi aggression, Hitler drew a parallel between [[militant (word)|militantism]] and Christianity's rise to power as the [[Roman Empire]]'s official [[state religion]]:

{{quote|"The individual may establish with pain today that with the appearance of Christianity the first spiritual terror entered into the far freer ancient world, but he will not be able to contest the fact that since then the world has been afflicted and dominated by this coercion, and that coercion is broken only by coercion, and terror only by terror. Only then can a new state of affairs be constructively created. Political parties are inclined to compromises; philosophies never. Political parties even reckon with opponents; philosophies proclaim their infallibility."<ref>Hitler, Adolf (1969). ''Mein Kampf''. McLeod, MN: Hutchinson, p. 562.</ref>}}

Elsewhere in ''Mein Kampf,'' Hitler speaks of the "creator of the universe" and "eternal Providence".<ref name="MeinKampf"/><ref>{{cite book |title=''Mein Kampf'' |author1=Ralph Manheim, ed. |author2=Adolf Hitler |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1998 |isbn=0395951054 |page=[https://archive.org/details/meinkampf00adol/page/65 65] |quote=Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord. |title-link=Mein Kampf }}</ref>  He also states that the Aryan race was created by God, and that it would be a sin to dilute it through racial intermixing:

{{quote|"The völkisch-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in his own denomination, of making people stop just talking superficially of God's will, and actually fulfill God's will, and not let God's word be desecrated.

=====Hitler on Christianity and "Positive Christianity"=====

Article 24 of Hitler's [[National Socialist Programme]] of 1920 had endorsed what it termed "[[Positive Christianity]]", but placed religion below party ideology by adding the caveat that it must not offend "the moral sense of the German race".<ref name="Richard Overy 2004. p.285">Richard Overy; ‘’The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia’’; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. p. 285</ref> Non-denominational, the term could be variously interpreted, but allayed fears among Germany's Christian majority as to the oft expressed anti-Christian convictions of large sections of the Nazi movement.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> It further proposed a definition of a "[[positive Christianity]]" which could combat the "Jewish-materialistic spirit".<ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005206 United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]; ''The German Churches and the Nazi State''; web 25 April 2013</ref>

In 1922, a decade before Hitler took power, former [[Prime Minister]] of [[Bavaria]] Count [[Hugo Graf von und zu Lerchenfeld auf Köfering und Schönberg|von Lerchenfeld-Köfering]] stated in a speech before the [[Landtag of Bavaria]] that his beliefs "as a man and a Christian" prevented him from being an anti-Semite or from pursuing anti-Semitic public policies. Hitler turned Lerchenfeld's perspective of Jesus on its head, telling a crowd in Munich:

{{quotation|"I would like here to appeal to a greater than I, Count Lerchenfeld. He said in the last session of the Landtag that his feeling 'as a man and a Christian' prevented him from being an anti-Semite. I say: My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded only by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was his fight against the Jewish poison. Today, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed his blood upon the Cross. As a Christian, I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice."<ref name="Speech Munich 1922">Speech delivered at Munich 12 April 1922; from Norman H. Baynes, ed. (1942). ''The Speeches of Adolf Hitler: April 1922 – August 1939''. Vol. 1. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.</ref>}}

In a 1928 speech, he said: "We tolerate no one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity&nbsp;... in fact our movement is Christian."<ref>Speech in Passau 27 October 1928 Bundesarchiv Berlin-Zehlendorf; from Richard Steigmann-Gall (2003). ''Holy Reich: Nazi conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 60–61</ref>

In light of later developments, Rees notes, "The most persuasive explanation of [Hitler's] statements is that Hitler, as a politician, simply recognised the practical reality of the world he inhabited&nbsp;... Had Hitler distanced himself or his movement too much from Christianity it is all but impossible to see how he could ever have been successful in a free election. Thus his relationship in public to Christianity—indeed his relationship to religion in general—was opportunistic. There is no evidence that Hitler himself, in his personal life, ever expressed any individual belief in the basic tenets of the Christian church".<ref name="ReferenceB" /> Richard Evans considers that the gap between Hitler's public and private pronouncements was due to a desire not to cause a quarrel with the churches that might undermine national unity.<ref name="Evans 2008 547–8" />

In 1932, Hitler came up with the name German Christians (''Deutsche Christen'') for a pro-Nazi group within Protestantism. "Hitler saw the relationship in political terms. He was not a practicing Christian, but had somehow succeeded in masking his own religious skepticism from millions of German voters", wrote [[Richard Overy|Overy]], who considered that Hitler found the arrangement useful for a time, but ultimately expected Christianity to wilt and die before "the advances of science".<ref>Richard Overy; ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. p. 281</ref> In this early period, the "German Christian" movement sought to make the Protestant churches in Germany an instrument of Nazi policy.<ref name="Christian Church 1960 pp. 235">"Confessing Church" in ''Dictionary of the Christian Church'', F.

Hitler's movement was not united on questions of religion.

Samuel Koehne, a Research Fellow at the [[Deakin University|Alfred Deakin Research Institute]], working on the official Nazi views on religion, answers the question ''Was Hitler a Christian?'' thus: "Emphatically not, if we consider Christianity in its traditional or orthodox form: Jesus as the son of God, dying for the redemption of the sins of all humankind. It is nonsense to state that Hitler (or any of the Nazis) adhered to Christianity of this form.[...] However, it is equally true that there were leading Nazis who adhered to a form of Christianity that had been 'aryanised.'" and "Was Hitler an atheist? Probably not."<ref name="Koehne">Koehne, Samuel, [http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/04/18/3480312.htm Hitler's faith: The debate over Nazism and religion], ABC Religion and Ethics, 18 Apr. 2012</ref>

=====Nazi seizure of power=====
[[File:Hitler with Catholic dignitaries.jpg|thumb|Hitler shaking hands with Catholic dignitaries in Germany in the 1930s]]
Prior to the Reichstag vote for the [[Enabling Act]] of 1933, under which Hitler gained the "temporary" dictatorial powers with which he went on to permanently dismantle the [[Weimar Republic]], Hitler promised the German Parliament that he would not interfere with the rights of the churches. However, with power secured in Germany, Hitler quickly broke this promise.<ref>Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W. W. Norton & Company; London; pp. 281–283</ref><ref>Alan Bullock; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; pp. 146–149</ref>

Through 1933 and into 1934, the Nazi leader required a level of support from groups like the German conservatives and the [[Catholic Centre Party]] in the Reichstag, and of the conservative [[Paul von Hindenburg|President von Hindenburg]], in order to achieve his takeover of power with the "appearance of legality".<ref>Alan Bullock; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991</ref> In a proclamation on February 1, 1933, Hitler stated, "The National Government will regard it as its first and foremost duty to revive in the nation the spirit of unity and co-operation. It will preserve and defend those basic principles on which our nation has been built. It regards Christianity as the foundation of our national morality, and the family as the basis of national life."<ref>Adolf Hitler. (1941). ''My New Order''. New York: Reynal & Hitchcock, p. 144.</ref>

On 21 March 1933, the Reichstag assembled in the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Potsdam Garrison Church]], to show the "unity" of National Socialism with the old conservative Germany of President von Hindenburg. Two days later, the Nazis secured passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], granting Hitler dictatorial powers. Less than three months later all non-Nazi parties and organizations, including the Catholic Centre Party had ceased to exist.<ref name="auto7"/>

Hitler sought to gain the votes of the [[Catholic Centre Party]] and German conservatives for the Enabling Act with a mix of intimidation, negotiation and conciliation.<ref>Alan Bullock; ''Hitler: A Study in Tyranny''; Harper Perennial 1991; ch ''The Months of Opportunity''</ref> On 23 March 1933, just prior to the vote for the [[Enabling Act]], he described the Christian faiths as "essential elements for safeguarding the soul of the German people" and "We hold the spiritual forces of Christianity to be indispensable elements in the moral uplift of most of the German people."<ref name="William L. Shirer p. 234"/><ref>Dennis Barton. (2006). ''[http://www.churchinhistory.org/pages/booklets/rise(n)-1.htm Hitler's Rise to Power]''. www.churchinhistory.org.</ref> "With an eye to the votes of the Catholic Centre Party", wrote Shirer, he added that he hoped to improve relations with the Holy See.<ref name="William L. Shirer p. 234"/>

The Centre Party asked for guarantees of the rights of the churches. Hitler promised that the institutions of the [[Weimar Republic]] and churches would be protected, and said his government saw the churches as "the most important factors for upholding our nationhood". Amid threats and talk of civil war, the Centre Party voted for the Act.<ref name="Ian Kershaw 1998, p.467">Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler 1889–1936: Hubris''; Allen Lane/Penguin Press; 1998, p.467</ref><ref name="Bullock, 1991, pp. 147-48">Bullock, 1991, pp. 147–148</ref> Hitler's false promises of protection for the churches and institutions of the republic were never kept.<ref name="Ian Kershaw 1998, p.467"/><ref name="Bullock, 1991, pp. 147-48"/>

In January 1934, Hitler angered the churches by appointing the neo-pagan [[Alfred Rosenberg]] as official Nazi ideologist. The Fuhrer launched an effort toward [[Gleichschaltung|coordination]] of German Protestants under a unified [[Protestant Reich Church]] under the ''[[Deutsche Christen]]'' movement, but the attempt failed—resisted by the [[Confessing Church]]. In ''The Aryan Jesus: Christian Theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany'', [[Susannah Heschel]] noted that the ''Deutsche Christens'' differed from traditional Christians by rejecting the Hebrew origins of Christianity. In public statements made during his rule, Hitler continued to speak positively about a Nazi vision of [[Christianity|Christian]] German culture,<ref name="Speeches">Baynes, Norman H., ed. (1969). ''The Speeches of Adolf Hitler: April 1922 – August 1939''. New York: Howard Fertig. pp. 19–20, 37, 240, 370, 371, 375, 378, 382, 383, 385–388, 390–392, 398–399, 402, 405–407, 410, 1018, 1544, 1594.</ref> and his belief in an [[Aryan]] [[Christ]]. Hitler added that [[Saint Paul]], as a Jew, had falsified Jesus' message—a theme Hitler repeated in private conversations, including,  in October 1941, when he made the decision to murder the Jews.<ref name="Susannah Heschel 2008. pp 1&ndash;10">Susannah Heschel, ''The Aryan Jesus: Christian Theologians and the Bible in Nazi Germany'', Princeton University Press, 2008. pp. 1–10</ref>

Ian Kershaw said that Hitler had lost interest in supporting the ''[[Deutsche Christen]]'' from around 1934.<ref name="Ian Kershaw pp. 295–297"/> However, in a speech 26 June 1934, Hitler stated:

{{quote|The National Socialist State professes its allegiance to positive Christianity. It will be its honest endeavour to protect both the great Christian Confessions in their rights, to secure them from interference with their doctrines (''Lehren''), and in their duties to constitute a harmony with the views and the exigencies of the State of today.<ref>Baynes, Norman H. ed. (1969). ''The Speeches of Adolf Hitler: April 1922 – August 1939''. Vol. 1. New York: Howard Fertig. p. 385.</ref>}}

In 1937, [[Hans Kerrl]], Hitler's Minister for Church Affairs, explained "Positive Christianity" as not "dependent upon the [[Apostle's Creed]]", nor in "faith in Christ as the son of God", upon which Christianity relied, but rather, as being represented by the [[Nazi Party]]: "The Fuehrer is the herald of a new revelation", he said.<ref name="William L. Shirer pp 238">William L. Shirer; ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich''; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; pp. 238–239</ref>

During negotiations leading to the [[Reichskonkordat]] with the Vatican, Hitler said, "Secular schools can never be tolerated because such schools have no religious instruction, and a general moral instruction without a religious foundation is built on air; consequently, all character training and religion must be derived from faith."<ref name="The German Churches Under Hitler">Ernst Helmreich, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=I6DYAAAAMAAJ The German Churches Under Hitler]''. Detroit: Wayne State Univ. Press, 1979, p. 241.</ref> However, as Hitler consolidated his power, schools became a major battleground in the Nazi [[kirchenkampf|campaign against the churches]]. In 1937, the Nazis banned any member of the [[Hitler Youth]] from simultaneously belonging to a religious youth movement. Religious education was not permitted in the Hitler Youth and by 1939, clergymen teachers had been removed from virtually all state schools.<ref name="The Third Reich p.157">[[Richard Overy]]; ''The Third Reich, A Chronicle''; Quercus; 2010; p. 157</ref> Hitler sometimes allowed pressure to be placed on German parents to remove children from religious classes to be given ideological instruction in its place, while in elite Nazi schools, Christian prayers were replaced with Teutonic rituals and sun-worship.<ref name="britannica.com">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/202210/fascism/219389/Identification-with-Christianity Encyclopedia Online – ''Fascism – Identification with Christianity''] web 20 Apr 2013</ref> By 1939 all Catholic denominational schools had been disbanded or converted to public facilities.<ref name="Evans, Richard J. 2005 pp. 245">Evans, Richard J.

====Hitler on mysticism and occultism====

{{Main|Nazism and occultism}}

According to Bullock, as an adolescent in Vienna, Hitler read widely, including books on [[Occult]]ism, [[Hypnosis|Hypnotism]], [[Astrology]]. However, his interest in these subjects was fleeting, and there is no evidence that he ever subscribed to any of these schools of thought.<ref name="Alan Bullock p11" /> Bullock found "no evidence to support the once popular belief that Hitler resorted to astrology" and wrote that Hitler ridiculed those like Himmler in his own party who wanted to re-establish pagan mythology, and Hess who believed in Astrology.<ref name="Stalin pp.412">[[Alan Bullock]], ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]'', Fontana Press 1993, p. 412.</ref><ref>Alan Bullock; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p. 219</ref> Albert Speer wrote that Hitler had a negative view toward Himmler and Rosenberg's mystical notions. Speer quotes Hitler as having said of Himmler's attempt to mythologize the SS:<ref name="p. 94"/>

{{quotation|What nonsense! Here we have at last reached an age that has left all mysticism behind it, and now [Himmler] wants to start that all over again. We might just as well have stayed with the church. At least it had tradition. To think that I may, some day, be turned into an SS saint! Can you imagine it? I would turn over in my grave&nbsp;...|Adolf Hitler quoted in [[Albert Speer]]'s ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]''}}

In a 1938 speech in Nuremberg Hitler rejected any form of mysticism, but expressed his belief in God, and that the Nazis' work was to fulfill a divine will:

{{Quotation|We will not allow mystically-minded occult folk with a passion for exploring the secrets of the world beyond to steal into our Movement. Such folk are not National Socialists, but something else&nbsp;– in any case, something which has nothing to do with us. At the head of our program there stand no secret surmisings but clear-cut perception and straightforward profession of belief. But since we set as the central point of this perception and of this profession of belief the maintenance and hence the security for the future of a being formed by God, we thus serve the maintenance of a divine work and fulfill a divine will - not in the secret twilight of a new house of worship, but openly before the face of the Lord.<ref>Speech in Nuremberg on 6 September 1938. ''The Speeches of Adolf Hitler, April 1922 – August 1939, Volume 1'' Edited by Norman Hepburn Baynes. University of Michigan Press, p. 396.</ref>}}

According to [[Ron Rosenbaum]], some scholars believe the young Hitler was strongly influenced, particularly in his racial views, by an abundance of occult works on the mystical superiority of the Germans, like the occult and anti-Semitic magazine ''[[Ostara (magazine)|Ostara]]'', and give credence to the claim of its publisher [[Lanz von Liebenfels]] that Hitler visited him in 1909 and praised his work.<ref>Rosenbaum, Ron ''Explaining Hitler'' pp. xxxvii, 282 (citing Yehuda Bauer's belief that Hitler's racism is rooted in occult groups like Ostara), p. 333, 1998 Random House</ref> John Toland wrote that evidence indicates Hitler was a regular reader of ''Ostara''.<ref>Toland, John [Adolf Hitler] p. 45, 1976 Anchor Books.</ref> Toland also included a poem that Hitler allegedly wrote while serving in the German Army on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1915.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toland|1992}}</ref>

The seminal work on [[Ariosophy]], ''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'' by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], devotes its last chapter the topic of ''Ariosophy and Adolf Hitler''. Not at least due to the difficulty of sources, historians disagree about the importance of Ariosophy for Hitler's religious views. As noted in the foreword of ''The Occult Roots of Nazism'' by [[Rohan Butler]], Goodrick-Clarke is more cautious in assessing the influence of Lanz von Liebenfels on Hitler than [[Joachim Fest]] in his biography of Hitler.<ref>{{Harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|p=x}}</ref>

Comparing him to [[Erich Ludendorff]], Fest writes: "Hitler had detached himself from such affections, in which he encountered the obscurantism of his early years, Lanz v. Liebenfels and the [[Thule Society]], again, long ago and had, in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', formulated his scathing contempt for that [[völkish]] [[romanticism]], which however his own cosmos of imagination preserved rudimentarily."<ref><!--"Hitler selber hatte sich von solchen Neigungen, in denen er dem Obskurantismus seiner frühen Jahre, Lanz v. Liebenfels und den Wahnbildern der Thulegesellschaft wiederbegegente, längst gelößt und in >>Mein Kampf<< seine beißende Verachtung für jenen völkischen Romantizismus formuliert, den seine eigene Vorstellungswelt gleichwohl rudimentär bewahrte."-->{{Harvnb|Fest|1973|p=320}}</ref>
Fest refers to the following passage from ''Mein Kampf'':
{{quote|"The characteristic thing about these people [modern-day followers of the early Germanic religion] is that they rave about the old Germanic heroism, about dim prehistory, stone axes, spear and shield, but in reality are the greatest cowards that can be imagined. For the same people who brandish scholarly imitations of old German tin swords, and wear a dressed bearskin with bull's horns over their heads, preach for the present nothing but struggle with spiritual weapons, and run away as fast as they can from every [[Communist]] blackjack.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hitler|1926|loc=ch. 12}}</ref>}}

It is not clear if this statement is an attack at anyone specific. It could have been aimed at [[Karl Harrer]] or at the [[Strasserism|Strasser group]]. According to Goodrick-Clarke, "In any case, the outburst clearly implies Hitler's contempt for conspiratorial circles and occult-racist studies and his preference for direct activism."<ref>{{Harvnb|Goodrick-Clarke|1985|p=202}}</ref> Hitler also said something similar in public speeches.<ref>"We will not allow mystically-minded occult folk with a passion for exploring the secrets of the world beyond to steal into our Movement. Such folk are not National Socialists, but something else—in any case something which has nothing to do with us." (Speech in Nuremberg on 6 September 1938)</ref>

Older literature states that Hitler had no intention of instituting worship of the [[Germanic paganism|ancient Germanic gods]] in contrast to the beliefs of some other Nazi officials.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gunther|1938|p=10}}</ref> In ''[[Hitler's Table Talk]]'' one can find this quote:
{{quote|"It seems to me that nothing would be more foolish than to re-establish the worship of [[Wodan|Wotan]]. Our old mythology ceased to be viable when Christianity implanted itself. Nothing dies unless it is moribund.}}

[[Jackson Spielvogel]] and David Redles in an article published by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] assert alleged influences of various portions of the teachings of [[H.P. Blavatsky]], the founder of The Theosophical Society with doctrines as expounded by her book "The Secret Doctrine", and the adaptations of her ideas by her followers, through Ariosophy, the [[Germanenorden]] and the Thule Society, constituted a popularly unacknowledged but decisive influence over the developing mind of Hitler.<ref name="motlc.wiesenthal.com">Jackson Spielvogel and David Redles: [http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=gvKVLcMVIuG&b=395043 ''Hitler's Racial Ideology: Content and Occult Sources''], The Simon Wiesenthal Center, 1997</ref> The scholars state that Hitler himself may be responsible for turning historians from investigating his occult influences.<ref name="motlc.wiesenthal.com" /> While he publicly condemned and even persecuted occultists, Freemasons, and astrologers, his nightly private talks disclosed his belief in the ideas of these competing occult groups—demonstrated by his discussion of [[reincarnation]], [[Atlantis]], [[Welteislehre|world ice theory]], and his belief that esoteric myths and legends of cataclysm and battles between gods and titans were a vague collective memory of monumental early events.<ref name="motlc.wiesenthal.com" />

In his childhood, Hitler had admired the pomp of Catholic ritual and the hierarchical organization of the clergy. Later he drew on these elements, organizing his party along hierarchical lines and including [[Liturgy|liturgical]] forms into events or using phraseology taken from hymns.<ref>Rissmann, Michael (2001). ''Hitlers Gott''. Zurich, p. 96.</ref> Because of these liturgical elements, Daim's claim of Hitler's Messiah-like status and the ideology's totalitarian nature, the Nazi movement, like other [[fascist]] movements and [[Communism]], is sometimes termed a "[[political religion]]" that is anti-ecclesiastical and anti-religious.<ref>Voegelin, Eric (1986).

Although Hitler expressed negative views towards the mystical notions of some of his senior Nazi underlings in private, he nevertheless appointed [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] to senior positions in the Nazi movement.<ref name="p. 94"/><ref name="auto1"/> [[William Shirer]] wrote that, "under the leadership of Rosenberg, Bormann and Himmler—backed by Hitler—the Nazi regime intended to destroy Christianity in Germany, if it could, and substitute the old paganism of the early tribal Germanic gods with the new paganism of the Nazi extremists".<ref name="books.google.com">[[William L. Shirer|Shirer, William L.]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=sY8svb-MNUwC&dq ''Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany''], p. 240, Simon and Schuster, 1990.</ref>  The regime launched an effort toward coordination of German Protestants under a unified [[Protestant Reich Church]] (but this was resisted by the [[Confessing Church]]), and moved early to eliminate [[political Catholicism]].<ref name="Ian Kershaw p.290"/> Blainey wrote: "Nazism itself was a religion, a pagan religion, and Hitler was its high priest&nbsp;... Its high altar [was] Germany itself and the German people, their soil and forests and language and traditions".<ref name="Christianity pp. 495&ndash;6"/>

In 1924,  during his imprisonment, Hitler had chosen [[Alfred Rosenberg]] to lead the Nazi movement in his absence.<ref>Laurence Rees; ''The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler''; Ebury Press 2012; p. 66</ref> In his seminal 1930 work ''[[The Myth of the 20th Century]]'', Rosenberg wrote: "We now realize that the central supreme values of the Roman and the Protestant Churches [-] hinder the organic powers of the peoples determined by their Nordic race, [-] they will have to be remodeled". Hitler had called his book "derivative, pastiche, illogical rubbish!"<ref>The Face of the Third Reich, Joachim Fest, p. 255</ref> But in January 1934, Hitler appointed Rosenberg as the cultural and educational leader of the Reich - the official Nazi philosopher and ideologist. Rosenberg was notoriously anti-Christian.<ref>Richard Bonney; ''Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936–1939''; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 {{ISBN|978-3-03911-904-2}}; pp. 122</ref> Church officials were perturbed by Hitler's appointment of Rosenberg as Nazi philosopher as it apparently endorsed Rosenberg's anti-church and neo-pagan philosophy. The Vatican banned  ''Myth of the Twentieth Century'' in February, 1934.<ref>Gill, 1994, see Chronology</ref> During the War, Rosenberg outlined the future he envisioned for religion in Germany. Among its articles: the National Reich Church of Germany was to claim exclusive control over all churches; publication of the Bible was to cease; crucifixes, Bibles and saints were to be removed from altars; and Mein Kampf was to be placed on altars as "to the German nation and therefore to God the most sacred book"; and the Christian Cross was to be removed from all churches and replaced with the swastika. But Rosenberg was in the end, a marginalised figure in the Hitler regime.<ref>The Face of the Third Reich, Joachim Fest, pp. 247–264</ref>
 
Hitler selected [[Heinrich Himmler]] to head the Nazi ''[[Schutzstaffel]]''  (SS) security forces. Himmler saw the main task of the SS to be that of "acting as the vanguard in overcoming Christianity and restoring a 'Germanic' way of living" in order to prepare for the coming conflict between "humans and subhumans":<ref name="Peter Longerich p.265">Peter Longerich; ''Heinrich Himmler''; Translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe; Oxford University Press; 2012; p. 265</ref> He set about making his SS the focus of a "cult of the Teutons".<ref>Peter Longerich; ''Heinrich Himmler''; Translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe; Oxford University Press; 2012; p. 269</ref> In 1937 he wrote that it was "the mission of the SS to give the German people in the next half century the non-Christian ideological foundations on which to lead and shape their lives. This task does not consist solely in overcoming an ideological opponent but must be accompanied at every step by a positive impetus: in this case that means the reconstruction of the German heritage in the widest and most comprehensive sense."<ref>Peter Longerich; ''Heinrich Himmler''; Translated by Jeremy Noakes and Lesley Sharpe; Oxford University Press; 2012; p. 270</ref>

====Hitler on atheism====
{{Further|Discrimination against atheists in Nazi Germany}}

Hitler viewed atheists as uneducated, and atheism as the state of the animals.<ref name="tabletalktrevorroper2000" /> He associated [[atheism]] with [[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]], [[Communism]], and "Jewish materialism".<ref name="The Speeches of Adolf Hitler">Norman H. Baynes, ed., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PxZoAAAAMAAJ The Speeches of Adolf Hitler, April 1922 – August 1939]''. Vol. 1. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1942, pp. 240, 378, 386.</ref> Richard Overy cited Hitler's belief in racial biology as evidence of scientific views and atheism, but stated that Hitler was not a thorough atheist in that sense because of his theistic and spiritual ideologies:<ref>Richard Overy; ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. pp 281</ref>

{{Quotation|"Truth lay in natural science, and for Hitler that meant the truths of racial biology - natural selection, racial struggle, 'identity of kind'. Hitler was politically prudent enough not to trumpet his scientific views publicly, not least because he wanted to maintain the distinction between his own movement and the godlessness of Soviet Communism. Nor was he a thorough atheist. His public utterances are peppered with references to 'God' and 'Spirit'. For Hitler the eschatological truths that he found in his perception of the race represented the real 'eternal will that rules the universe'; in the infinite value of the race and the struggle to sustain it men find what they might call God, an inner sense of the unity and purposiveness of nature and history&nbsp;...Such views could be detected in the development of critical theology in Germany before the First World War, which suggested that God should be experienced as inner feeling rather than as external morality... What Hitler could not accept was that Christianity could offer anything other than false 'ideas' to sustain its claim to moral certitude."|Excerpt from ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'' by [[Richard Overy]] <ref>[[Richard Overy|Overy, Richard]] (2004) ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin. p. 281</ref>}}

The historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that Hitler courted and benefited from fear among German Christians of militant Communist atheism.<ref name="Christianity pp. 495&ndash;6"/> "The aggressive spread of atheism in the Soviet Union alarmed many German Christians", wrote Blainey, and with the National Socialists becoming the main opponent of Communism in Germany: "[Hitler] himself saw Christianity as a temporary ally, for in his opinion 'one is either a Christian or a German'. To be both was impossible."<ref name="Christianity pp. 495&ndash;6"/> In early 1933, Hitler publicly defended National Socialism against charges that it was anti-Christian. Responding to accusations by [[Eugen Bolz]], the Catholic Centre Party [[List of Ministers-President of Baden-Württemberg|Staatspräsident]] of [[Württemberg]], that the National Socialist movement threatened the Christian faith, he said:

{{quotation|And now Staatspräsident [[Eugen Bolz|Bolz]] says that Christianity and the Catholic faith are threatened by us. And to that charge I can answer: In the first place it is Christians and not international atheists who now stand at the head of Germany. I do not merely talk of Christianity, no, I also profess that I will never ally myself with the parties which destroy Christianity. If many wish today to take threatened Christianity under their protection, where, I would ask, was Christianity for them in these fourteen years when they went arm in arm with atheism? No, never and at no time was greater internal damage done to Christianity than in these fourteen years when a [[Catholic Centre Party|party]], theoretically Christian, sat with those who denied God in one and the same Government.|[[Adolf Hitler]], ''Speech delivered at Stuttgart, 15 February 1933" <ref name="Norman H.

In a radio address October 14, 1933 Hitler stated, "For eight months we have been waging a heroic battle against the Communist threat to our Volk, the decomposition of our culture, the subversion of our art, and the poisoning of our public morality. We have put an end to denial of God and abuse of religion. We owe Providence humble gratitude for not allowing us to lose our battle against the misery of unemployment and for the salvation of the German peasant."<ref name="Norman H.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1942, pp. 369–370.</ref>

In a speech delivered in Berlin, October 24, 1933, Hitler stated: "We were convinced that the people needs and requires this faith. We have therefore undertaken the fight against the [[Communist Party of Germany|atheistic movement]], and that not merely with a few theoretical declarations: we have stamped it out."<ref name="Norman H.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1942, p. 378.</ref> In a speech delivered at [[Koblenz]], August 26, 1934 Hitler said: "There may have been a time when even parties founded on the ecclesiastical basis were a necessity. At that time [[Liberalism]] was opposed to the Church, while [[Marxism]] was anti-religious. But that time is past. National Socialism neither opposes the Church nor is it anti-religious, but on the contrary, it stands on the ground of a real Christianity. The Church's interests cannot fail to coincide with ours alike in our fight against the symptoms of degeneracy in the world of today, in our fight against the Bolshevist culture, against an atheistic movement, against criminality, and in our struggle for the consciousness of a community in our national life, for the conquest of hatred and disunion between the classes, for the conquest of civil war and unrest, of strife and discord. These are not anti-Christian, these are Christian principles."<ref name="Norman H. Baynes 1939. p. 386">Norman H.

====Hitler on Hinduism====

Hitler's choice of the [[Swastika]] as the Nazis' main and official symbol was linked to the belief in the [[Aryan]] cultural descent of the German people. They considered the early [[Aryan]]s to be the prototypical white invaders and the sign of the Swastika to be a symbol of the Aryan [[master race]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4183467.stm|title=Origins of the swastika|date=2005-01-18|accessdate=2008-04-28|work=[[BBC]]}}</ref> The theory was inspired by the German archaeologist [[Gustaf Kossinna]],<ref name="opqa">{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/indusrivercivilizations/a/aryans.htm|title=Who Were the Aryans?|author=K.

====Hitler on Islam====
{{see also|Relations between Nazi Germany and the Arab world}}

Hitler's views on Islam are a matter of controversy. On the one hand, Hitler privately demeaned ethnic groups he associated with Islam, notably Arabs, as racially inferior. On the other hand, he also made private and public statements expressing admiration for what he perceived to be the militaristic nature of Islam and the political sharpness of the [[Prophet Muhammad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/fall-2014-the-great-wars/the-swastika-and-the-crescent/|title=The Swastika and the Crescent}}([https://web.archive.org/web/20191022055457/https://www.wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/fall-2014-the-great-wars/the-swastika-and-the-crescent/ Archived] at the [[WayBack Machine]])</ref>

Among [[eastern religions]], Hitler described religious leaders such as "[[Confucius]], [[Buddha]], and [[Muhammad]]" as providers of "spiritual sustenance".<ref>{{Harvnb|Angebert|1974|p=246}}</ref> In this context, Hitler's connection to [[Mohammad Amin al-Husseini]], who served as the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] until 1937&nbsp;– which included his asylum in 1941, with the honorary rank of an [[SS]] Major-General, and recognition as an "[[honorary Aryan]],"&nbsp;–

During a meeting with a delegation of distinguished Arab figures, Hitler learned of how Islam motivated the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] during the [[Islamic invasion of Gaul]]. According to Minister of Armaments and War Production [[Albert Speer]], Hitler wished that the Caliphate had won the [[Battle of Tours]] against the Franks in 732: "The Mohammedan religion would have been much more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?"<ref name="Speer1997">{{cite book|author=Albert Speer|title=Inside the Third Reich: memoirs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XLSa_RIDHMUC&pg=PA96|accessdate=2010-09-15|date=1 April 1997|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-82949-4|pages=96–}}</ref> "Had [[Charles Martel]] not been victorious at Poitiers — already, you see, the world had fallen into the hands of the Jews, so gutless a thing was Christianity ! — then we should in all probability have been converted to Mohammedanism, that cult which glorifies heroism and which opens the seventh Heaven to the bold warrior alone. Then the Germanic races would have conquered the world. Christianity alone prevented them from doing so."{{sfn|Cameron|Stevens|Weinberg|Trevor-Roper|2007|p=667}} According to Speer, Hitler was convinced that had Islam taken root in central Europe at this time, the Germanic people would have become the "heirs of that religion" with Islam being "perfectly suited to the Germanic temperament". Hitler said that while the Arabs, on account of their "racial inferiority", would have been unable to handle the harsh climate and conditions of the region, and that instead the Islamized Germans would have "stood at the head of this Mohammedan Empire". A "religion that believed in spreading the faith by the sword and in subjugating all nations to that faith".<ref name="Speer1997"/>

Notwithstanding Hitler's apparent admiration for Islam and Muhammad, and his willingness to work with Arab political leaders, he viewed Arabic people as racial and social inferiors. Speer acknowledged that in private, Hitler regarded Arabs as an inferior race<ref name="Speer1997" /> and that the relationship he had with various Muslim figures was more political than personal.<ref name="Speer1997" />

Hitler was also quoted in the early war years stating, "We shall continue to make disturbances in the [[Far East]] and in [[Arabia]].

====Hitler on Judaism====

National Socialist ideology developed a racial hierarchy which placed minority groups&nbsp;– most especially the Jews&nbsp;– as subhuman. The categorization was based on the Nazi conception of race, and not on religion, thus Slavs and Poles (who were overwhelmingly Christian) were also grouped as inferior to the so-called "Aryan" peoples. Hitler espoused a ruthless policy of "negative eugenic selection", believing that world history consisted of a struggle for survival between races, in which the Jews plotted to undermine the Germans, and inferior groups like Slavs and defective individuals in the German gene pool, threatened the Aryan "master race".<ref name="Richard J pp. 55–57">[[Richard J. Evans]]; ''In Search of German Social Darwinism: The History and Historiography of a Concept''; a chapter from ''Medicine & Modernity: Public Health & Medical Care in 19th and 20th Century Germany''; Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge; 1997; pp. 55–57</ref> However, Hitler also had ideological objections to Judaism as a faith, and some of Hitler's antipathy towards Christianity flowed from its Jewish origins, as he saw Christianity as "indelibly Jewish in origin and character" and a "prototype of Bolshevism", which "violated the law of natural selection".<ref name="Richard J 2009, p. 547">[[Richard J. Evans]]; ''The Third Reich at War''; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p. 547</ref>

Writing for the public in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Hitler described the Jews as enemies of all civilization and as materialistic, unspiritual beings: "His life is only of this world, and his spirit is inwardly as alien to true Christianity as his nature two thousand years previous was to the great founder of the new doctrine."<ref name="auto4">Adolf Hitler, ''Mein Kampf'', Ralph Mannheim, ed., New York: Mariner Books, 1999, p. 65.</ref> In the work, he also described a supposedly divine mandate for his anti-Semitism: "Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord."<ref name="auto4"/>

During negotiations for the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] between the Catholic Church and Germany in 1933, Hitler said to Bishop Wilhelm Berning: "I have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in [[ghetto]]s, etc, because it recognised the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognised. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognise the representatives of this race as pestilant for the state and for the church and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions".<ref>Nazi Germany & the Jews: The Years of Persecution 1933–39, [[Saul Friedländer]], p. 47, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-297-81882-3}}</ref>

====Secular versus religious influences====

Scholarly interest continues on the extent to which inherited, long-standing, cultural-religious notions of anti-Judaism in Christian Europe contributed to Hitler's personal racial anti-Semitism, and what influence a pseudo-scientific "primitive version of social-Darwinism", mixed with 19th century imperialist notions, brought to bear on his psychology. While Hitler's views on these subjects have often been called "[[social Darwinist]]", Hitler's grasp of the subject has been argued to have been incomplete,<ref>Zalampas, Sherree Owens. (1990).

According to historian [[Lucy Dawidowicz]], anti-Semitism has a long history within Christianity, and the line of "anti-Semitic descent" from Luther to Hitler is "easy to draw". In her ''[[The War Against the Jews]], 1933–1945'', she writes that Luther and Hitler were obsessed by the "[[demonology|demonologized]] universe" inhabited by Jews. Dawidowicz states that the similarities between Luther's anti-Semitic writings and modern anti-Semitism are no coincidence, because they derived from a common history of ''Judenhass'' which can be traced to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman's]] advice to [[Ahasuerus]], although modern German anti-Semitism also has its roots in German [[nationalism]].<ref>''The War Against the Jews, 1933–1945''.

{{quote|There is, of course, a long tradition of anti-Semitism in all of the Christian churches. [...] There is little question that the Holocaust had its origin in the

Sánchez, ''Pius XII and the Holocaust; Understanding the Controversy'' (Washington, D.C: Catholic University of American Press, 2002), p. 70.</ref>}}

[[Laurence Rees]] in contrast, notes that there is little emphasis on Christianity in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', which presents a view of the universe conspicuously at odds with traditional Christian notions long established in Germany. Hitler's vision is ordered instead around principles of struggle between weak and strong.<ref name="auto3"/> Rees argues that Hitler's "bleak and violent vision" and visceral hatred of the Jews had been influenced by sources outside the Christian tradition. The notion of life as struggle Hitler drew from [[Social Darwinism]], the notion of the superiority of the "Aryan race" he drew from [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''The Inequality of the Human Races''; from events following Russia's surrender in World War One when Germany seized agricultural lands in the East he formed the idea of colonising the Soviet Union; and from [[Alfred Rosenberg]] he took the idea of a link between Judaism and Bolshevism, writes Rees.<ref>Laurence Rees; ''The Dark Charisma of Adolf Hitler''; Ebury Press 2012; pp. 61–62</ref>

[[Richard J. Evans]] notes that Hitler "used his own version of the language of social Darwinism as a central element in the discursive practice of extermination...", and the language of Social Darwinism, in its Nazi variant, helped to remove all restraint from the directors of the "terroristic and exterminatory" policies of the regime, by "persuading them that what they were doing was justified by history, science and nature".<ref>[[Richard J. Evans]]; ''In Search of German Social Darwinism: The History and Historiography of a Concept'', 1997 – (quoted by [[Richard Weikart]] in ''Hitler's Religion: The Twisted Beliefs that Drove the Third Reich''; Regnery; USA 2016; {{ISBN|978-1621575009}}; p. 352)</ref> Fest considers that Hitler simplified de Gobineau's elaborate ideas of [[Survival of the fittest|struggle for survival]] among the different races, from which the Aryan race, guided by providence, was supposed to be the torchbearers of civilization.<ref>Fest, Joachim (1974).

In his rhetoric{{when|date=April 2017}} Hitler fed on the old accusation of Jewish [[deicide]]. It has been speculated that Christian anti-Judaism influenced Hitler's ideas, especially such works as [[Martin Luther]]'s essay ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies]]'' and the writings of [[Paul de Lagarde]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Others disagree with this view.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shirer|1960|pp=91–236}} <!-- Was cited earlier as the 1990 edition, if the information exists in the 1960 edition correct the pages, if not put the 1990 edition in references and correct the other reference --> argues that Luther's essay was influential.

The extermination, therefore, could be done without a twinge of [[conscience]] since he was merely acting as the avenging hand of God&nbsp;..."<ref name="John Toland 1976 p. 703"/> Toland wrote that in 1941 Hitler was still "a member in good standing of the Church of Rome despite his detestation of its hierarchy" and "he carried within himself its teaching that the [[Jewish deicide|Jew was the killer of God]]. The extermination, therefore, could be done without a twinge of [[conscience]] since he was merely acting as the avenging hand of God—so long as it was done impersonally, without cruelty."<ref name="John Toland 1976 p. 703"/>

==Hitler's policies towards religion==
{{Main|Religion in Nazi Germany|}}

===Role of religion in the Nazi state===
[[Nazi ideology]] could not accept an autonomous establishment whose legitimacy did not spring from the government. It desired the subordination of church to state.<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; {{ISBN|0-674-63680-5}}; p. 196</ref> Nevertheless, Nazi Germany was not formally atheist, and other than for Jews and Jehovah's Witnesses, religious observance was permitted.<ref name="auto5">Richard Overy; ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004.p278</ref> [[Julian Baggini]] wrote that Hitler's Germany was not a "straightforwardly atheist state", but one which "sacrilized" notions of blood and nation.<ref name="auto6">[[Julian Baggini]]; ''Atheism a Very Short Introduction''; Oxford University Press, 2003, pp. 85–87</ref>

Hitler feared the results of overt attacks on the deep-rooted German churches, as around two thirds of Germans were Protestant and most of the rest were Roman Catholic.<ref>Richard Overy; ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. pp. 278–285</ref> German conservative elements, such as the officer corps of the army, opposed Nazi efforts against the churches, and Hitler needed to show caution.<ref name="Hitler p218">[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]''; Harper Perennial Edition 1991; p. 218</ref><ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler: A Study in Tyranny]]''; Harper Perennial Edition 1991; p. 236</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Miner|2003|p=54}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Thomsett|1997|pp=54–55}}</ref><ref name="Christianity pp. 495&ndash;6">[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; pp. 495–496</ref> The Hitler regime responded to the ideological challenge of Christian morality using political repression and persecution and by challenging Christian teachings through education and propaganda.<ref name="Richard Overy 2004. p.285"/>

Hitler possessed radical instincts in relation to the Nazi conflict with the Churches, and though he occasionally spoke of wanting to delay a struggle and was prepared to restrain his anti-clericalism out of political considerations, Kershaw considers that his "own inflammatory comments gave his immediate underlings all the license they needed to turn up the heat in the 'Church Struggle{{'"}}.<ref name="Ian Kershaw pp. 381&ndash;382">Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W. W. Norton & Company; London; pp. 381–382</ref>

Hitler "wanted to neutralise any political threat from organised religion", wrote Overy. "The first step was to reach agreement with the Roman Catholic Church, whose theology was not susceptible to the new nationalist trends&nbsp;..." Hitler dispatched the Catholic conservative [[Franz von Papen]] to negotiate a [[Reich concordat|Concordat]] with the Vatican. He obtained an agreement that clergy would refrain from politics, in return for guarantees of Church rights.<ref name="Richard Overy 2004. p 283-5">Richard Overy; ''The Dictators Hitler's Germany Stalin's Russia''; Allen Lane/Penguin; 2004. pp. 283–285</ref><ref name="Ian Kershaw p.290"/> Hitler was delighted, and received the congratulations of German Catholic leaders.<ref>Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler 1889–1936 Hubris''; Allen Lane/Penguin Press; 1998, p.467</ref> However, violations of the treaty began almost as soon as it was signed.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; [[A Short History of Christianity]]; pp. 495–6</ref><ref>Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W. W. Norton & Company; London; p. 295.</ref> Hitler promulgated the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring|sterilization law]], and began work to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders began to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or "immorality".<ref name="William L. Shirer p234-5">William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; pp 234-235</ref> Catholic publications were shut down.

As Hitlers genocidal plans began to manifest, Catholic priests and bishops held no public protests. Instead, they prayed in support of Germany's cause, seeking to show that their support for Hitler was undiminished.<ref>Complicity in the Holocaust, Robert P. Ericksen Cambridge University Press Pg. 109-110</ref>

By early 1937, the church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate with Hitler, had become highly disillusioned and [[Pope Pius XI]] issued the ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical—accusing Germany of violations of the Concordat and of sowing the tares of "open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church", and denounced the pagan myth of "blood and soil".<ref name="William L. Shirer p. 234"/> Hitler's invasion of the predominantly Catholic Poland in 1939 ignited the [[Second World War]].

On Protestantism, Hitler proposed to unite Germany's 28 Protestant churches into one [[German Evangelical Church|Reich Church]]. Steigmann-Gall wrote that Hitler demonstrated a preference for [[Protestantism]] over Catholicism, as Protestantism was more liable to reinterpretation and a non-traditional readings, more receptive to "[[positive Christianity]]", and because some of its liberal branches had held similar views.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steigmann-Gall|2003|p=84}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Nazis' 'Positive Christianity': a Variety of 'Clerical Fascism'?|author=Steigmann-Gall, Richard|journal=[[Kent State University]]|date=2007-06-01}}</ref> Hitler's interest was opportunistic: "From Hitler's point of view, a national church was of interest purely from a point of view of control and manipulation", wrote Kershaw.<ref name="Ian Kershaw 1998, p.489-90">Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler 1889–1936: Hubris''; Allen Lane/Penguin Press; 1998, pp. 489–490</ref> He installed his friend [[Ludwig Müller]] as leader of the movement and sought to establish a pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic unified Reich Church.<ref>William L.

IV ''The Twentieth Century in Europe'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1961), p. 259 f.</ref>

When ''German Christians'' called for rejection of the Bible as "Jewish superstition" and of the Christian calling to "love thy neighbour", the movement lost still further support. Hitler's move to have Müller elected Bishop failed&nbsp;– despite intimidation. He then abandoned his efforts to unite the Protestant churches, appointed [[Hans Kerrl]] as Minister for Church Affairs in December 1934, and distanced himself permanently from the so-called "German Christians".<ref name="Richard Overy 2004. p 283-5"/><ref>Poewe, Karla (2006).

Overy wrote that Christianity was ultimately as incompatible with National Socialism as it was with Soviet Communism and that "Hitler expected the end of the disease of Christianity to come about by itself once the falsehoods were self-evident.

According to Kershaw, in 1937 Goebbels noted Hitler was becoming more radical on the 'Church Question', and indicated that, though current political circumstances required waiting, his long term plan was to eventually dissolve the Reich concordat with Rome, detach the church entirely from the state and turn the entire force of the party to 'the destruction of the clerics', and end the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in a 'great world showdown'.<ref>Ian Kershaw; Hitler 1936-1945 Nemesis; WW Norton & Company; 2000; pp.40-41</ref> In 1941, when Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Galen]] protested against Nazi Euthanasia and seizures of church properties, although Hitler's sympathies lay with the radicals who wanted Galen dead and church properties seized, he calculated that this would turn Catholic areas still further against the regime. "Only the need for peace in relation with the churches to avoid deteriorating morale on the home front determined his stance", wrote Kershaw, "Events in the Warthegau (where by 1941 94% of churches and chapels in the Posen-Gnesen diocese were closed, 11 % of the clergy were murdered, and most of the remainder thrust into prisons and concentration camps) showed the face of the future."<ref>Ian Kershaw; Hitler 1936-1945 Nemesis; WW Norton & Company; 2000; pp.428</ref>

The National Socialist movement was not formally atheist, and generally allowed religious observance.<ref name="auto5"/> [[Julian Baggini]] wrote that Hitler's Germany was not a "straightforwardly atheist state", but one which "sacrilized" notions of blood and nation.<ref name="auto6"/> On October 13, 1933, [[Deputy Führer]] [[Rudolf Hess]] issued a decree stating: "No National Socialist may suffer any detriment on the ground that he does not profess any particular faith or confession or on the ground that he does not make any religious profession at all."<ref>Baynes, Norman H. ed. (1969). ''The Speeches of Adolf Hitler: April 1922 – August 1939''. 1. New York: Howard Fertig, p.&nbsp;378.</ref> However, "The aggressive spread of atheism in the Soviet Union alarmed many German Christians", wrote [[Geoffrey Blainey]] and Hitler saw Christianity as a "temporary ally" against Bolshevism, and courted and benefited from fear among German Christians of militant Communist atheism.<ref name="Christianity pp. 495&ndash;6"/> In that same year the regime banned most atheistic and [[Freethought|freethinking]] groups in Germany—other than those that supported the Nazis.<ref name="may">{{cite book |last= Bock| first= Heike | chapter= Secularization of the modern conduct of life?

When criticised for anti-Christian sentiments in February 1933, Hitler claimed that it was the Nazis not the Catholic Centre Party that had taken on atheist politics.<ref name="Norman H. Baynes 1969 p. 240"/> When negotiating the concordat with the Catholic Church, Hitler said he supported religious education in schools.<ref name="The German Churches Under Hitler"/> Once in office however, Hitler then pursued a policy of suppression of denominational schools and church youth organizations.<ref name="Nazi trial documents made public">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1753469.stm Nazi trial documents made public], BBC, 11 January 2002</ref> Clergymen teachers were removed from virtually all state schools.<ref name="The Third Reich p.157"/> By 1939 all denominational schools had been disbanded or converted to public facilities.<ref name="Evans, Richard J. 2005 pp. 245"/> In that year, Evans notes, some 95% of Germans still called themselves Protestant or Catholic, while only 3.5% "Deist" (''[[gottgläubig]]'') and 1.5% atheist. Most in these latter categories were "convinced Nazis who had left their Church at the behest of the Party, which had been trying since the mid 1930s to reduce the influence of Christianity in society".<ref name="Richard J 2009, p. 546">[[Richard J. Evans]]; ''The Third Reich at War''; Penguin Press; New York 2009, p. 546</ref>

[[John S. Conway (historian)|John Conway]] notes that the majority of the three million Nazi Party members continued to pay their church taxes and register as either [[Roman Catholic]] or [[German Evangelical Church Confederation|Protestant Christians]], "despite all Rosenberg's efforts."<ref name="Churches p. 232">The Nazi Persecution of the Churches, 1933–1945, by John S. Conway p. 232; Regent College Publishing</ref> Aggressive anti-Church radicals like [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Martin Bormann]] saw the ''[[kirchenkampf]]'' campaign against the Churches as a priority concern, and anti-church and [[anticlerical]] sentiments were strong among grassroots party activists.<ref name="Ian Kershaw p.381-382">Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler: A Biography''; 2008 Edn; W. W. Norton & Co; London; pp. 381–82</ref> From 1938, writes Overy, "Martin Bormann, head of the Party Chancellery and a prominent party atheist, took a leading role in trying to sever all state financial support for the churches, and to limit their legal status and activities, but the need to mobilise church support for the war effort from September 1939 led, as it did in the Soviet Union after 1941, to a limited political truce between church and state."<ref name="Richard Overy 2004. p.286"/> Speer considered Bormann to be the driving force behind the regime's campaign against the churches and thought that Hitler approved of his aims, but wanted to "postpone this problem to a more favourable time":<ref name="Albert Speer p.123"/>

====Jehovah's Witnesses====

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] numbered around 30,000 at the start of Hitler's rule in Germany. For refusing to declare loyalty to the Reich, and refusing conscription into the army, they were declared to be enemies of Germany and [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany|persecuted]]. About 6,000 were sent to the concentration camps.<ref>Geoffrey Blainey; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p. 496</ref>

====Judaism====
{{See also|The Holocaust|}}

Anti-Judaism as well as racial anti-Semitism were central planks of Hitler's philosophy. His regime perpetrated the [[Final Solution]] an effort to exterminate the Jews, which resulted in the largest-scale genocide in history. Hitler's ideology presented the Jews as a biological challenge to the "purity" of German blood.

*[[Richard J.
