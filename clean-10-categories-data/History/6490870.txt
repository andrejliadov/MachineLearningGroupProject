The '''Archduchy of Austria''' ({{lang-de|Erzherzogtum Österreich}}) was a major [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|principality]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the nucleus of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. With its capital at [[Vienna]], the archduchy was centered at the Empire's southeastern periphery.

Its present name originates from the Frankish term ''Oustrich'' - Eastern Kingdom (east of the Frankish kingdom). The Archduchy developed out of the Bavarian [[Margraviate of Austria]], elevated to the [[Duchy of Austria]] according to the 1156 ''[[Privilegium Minus]]'' by Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]]. The [[House of Habsburg]] came to the Austrian throne in [[Vienna]] in 1282 and in 1453 Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]], also Austrian ruler, officially adopted the [[archducal]] title. From the 15th century onwards, all [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s but [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|one]] were Austrian archdukes and with the acquisition of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Hungarian]] crown lands in 1526, the [[Habsburg hereditary lands]] became the centre of a major European power.<ref name="Writer.)1761">{{cite book|author=John BANKS (Miscellaneous Writer.)|title=A Compendious History of the House of Austria, and the German Empire, etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JR9bAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA398|year=1761|publisher=H. Serjeant|pages=398–}}</ref>

The Archduchy's history as an [[imperial state]] ended with the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]] in 1806. It was replaced with the [[Lower Austria|Lower]] and [[Upper Austria]] crown lands of the [[Austrian Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

{{History of Austria}}
Located in the [[Danube]] basin, the ancient Roman province [[Pannonia Superior]], Austria bordered on the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] beyond the [[Morava (river)|March]] and [[Leitha]] rivers in the east. In the south it was confined by the [[Duchy of Styria]], with the border at the historic [[Semmering Pass]], while in the north the [[Bohemian Forest]] and the [[Thaya]] river marked the border with [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]].<ref name="Writer.)1761"/>

In the west, the Upper Austrian part bordered on the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] stem duchy. The adjacent [[Innviertel]] region belonged to the Bavarian dukes, until it was occupied by Austrian forces during the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]] in 1778 and incorporated into the archducal lands according to the [[Treaty of Teschen|Peace of Teschen]]. In the course of the [[German mediatisation]] in 1803, the Austrian archdukes also acquired the rule over the [[Electorate of Salzburg]] and the [[Berchtesgaden Provostry]].<ref name="Goodrich1851">{{cite book|author=S.G Goodrich|title=History of all nations, from the earliest periods to the present time; or, Universal History: in which the history of every nation, ancient and modern, is separately given|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgi-i1oljjcC&pg=PA985|year=1851|pages=985–}}</ref>

==History==

After Austria was detached from Bavaria and established as an Imperial estate in 1156, the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg]] dukes also acquired the neighbouring [[Duchy of Styria]] in 1192. After the extinction of the line in 1246 and the occupation by King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]], it was seized by the Habsburg king [[Rudolf I of Germany]], who defeated Ottokar in the 1278 [[Battle on the Marchfeld]] and enfeoffed his son [[Albert I of Germany|Albert I]].<ref name="Tucker2009">{{cite book|author=Spencer C. Tucker|title=A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East &#91;6 volumes&#93;: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_tSnygvbIC&pg=RA4-PR4|date=23 December 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-672-5|pages=287–}}</ref>

In 1358/59 the Habsburg duke [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria|Rudolf IV]], in response to the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], already claimed the [[Archduke|archducal]] title by forging the ''[[Privilegium Maius]]''. Rudolf aimed to achieve a status comparable to the Empire's seven [[prince-elector]]s, the holders of the traditional Imperial 'arch'-offices (cf. [[Archchancellor]]); however, his attempts failed as the elevation was rejected by the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. By the 1379 [[Treaty of Neuberg]], his heirs divided the Habsburg lands, whereafter the Austrian duchy remained under the rule of the [[Albertinian line]].<ref name="BerengerSimpson2014">{{cite book|author1=Jean Berenger|author2=C.A.

===From Duchy to Archduchy===
On Epiphany 1453 Emperor Frederick III, regent of Austria for his minor Albertinian cousin [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]], finally acknowledged the archducal title. It was then conferred to all Habsburg emperors and rulers, as well as to the non-ruling princes of the dynasty, however, it still did not carry the right to vote in the [[Imperial election]].

Frederick further promoted the rise of the Habsburg dynasty into European dimensions with the arrangement of the marriage between his son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary the Rich]], heiress of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in 1477. After Maximilian's son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] in 1496 had married [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna the Mad]], Queen of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and the [[Crown of Aragon]], his son [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] could come into an inheritance "[[The empire on which the sun never sets|on which the sun never sets]]".<ref name="Judson2016"/>

Nevertheless, Charles' younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] claimed his rights and became Archduke of Austria according to an estate distribution at the 1521 [[Diet of Worms]], whereby he became regent over the Austrian archduchy and the adjacent [[Inner Austria]]n lands of [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniola]] and [[County of Gorizia|Gorizia]] (Görz). By marrying Princess [[Anna of Bohemia and Hungary]], Ferdinand inherited both kingdoms in 1526. Also [[King of the Romans]] from 1531, he became the progenitor of the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg ([[House of Lorraine|Habsburg-Lorraine]] from 1745 on), which as Archdukes of Austria and Kings of Bohemia ruled as Holy Roman Emperors until the Empire's dissolution in 1806.<ref name="Goodrich1851"/>

===Austrian Empire===
In 1804, Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II of Habsburg]] who was also ruler of the lands of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] promoted his territories within the Holy Roman Empire together with his [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] to the [[Austrian Empire]] in reaction to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]]'s proclamation of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]; two years later Francis formally dissolved the Holy Roman Empire. The Archduchy of Austria continued to exist as a constituent [[crown land]] (''Kronland'') within the empire, although it was divided into Upper and Lower Austria for administrative purposes. Hungary preserved its earlier status as ''Regnum Independens''. The title of archduke continued to be used by members of the imperial family and the archduchy was only formally dissolved in 1918 with the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]] and the creation of the separate [[States of Austria|federal states]] of [[Lower Austria|Lower]] and [[Upper Austria]] in the new Republic of [[German Austria]].<ref name="Judson2016">{{cite book|author=Pieter M.
