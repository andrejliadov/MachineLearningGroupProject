'''Hebraization''' (or '''Judaization''') '''of Palestinian place names''' refers to the replacement of [[Arabic-language]] [[Place names of Palestine|place names]] with [[Hebrew-language]] place names throughout different periods: under the British [[Mandatory Palestine]] regime; after the establishment of [[Israel]] following the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]] and [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]; and subsequently in the [[Palestinian territories]] occupied by Israel in 1967.<ref name="Kadman2015">{{cite book|author=Noga Kadman|title=Erased from Space and Consciousness: Israel and the Depopulated Palestinian Villages of 1948|date=7 September 2015|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-01682-9|pages=91–|chapter=Naming and Mapping the Depopulated Village Sites|ref=none|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIdNCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA100}}</ref>{{sfn|Benvenisti|2000|p=11}} A 1992 study counted {{circa}}2,780 historical locations whose names were Hebraized, including 340 villages and towns, 1,000 Khirbat (ruins), 560 wadis and rivers, 380 springs, 198 mountains and hills, 50 caves, 28 castles and palaces, and 14 pools and lakes.<ref>Study by Palestinian geographer [[:ar: شكري عراف |Shukri Arraf]] (1992), "The Palestinian locations between two eras/maps" (Arabic).

Many of the place names surviving in the [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian dialect]] of Arabic can be traced to [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the major language spoken  by the predominantly Christian peasantry<ref>[[Nur Masalha]],[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cb2rDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT46  ''Palestine: A Four Thousand Year History,''] [[Zed Books]]  2018 {{isbn|978-1-786-99275-8}}p.46:'Latin remained the official language of the government in the 6th century, whereas the prevalent language of merchants, farmers, seamen and ordinary citizens was Greek. Also, Aramaic -closely related to Arabic - was a prevalent language among the (predominantly Christian) Palestinian peasantry which constituted the  majority of population in the country. . Greek, however, became the [[lingua franca]] of late Byzantine Palestine, shortly before the advent of Islam. Consequently, the [[Hellenisation]] of Palestinian toponyms was not uncommon in Late Antiquity. A well known example of Hellenisation from Late Antiquity is the work of the 1st-century Romano-Jewish historian and translator Josephus who spoke Aramaic and Greek and who became a Roman citizen. Both he and Greco-Roman Jewish writer [[Philo of Alexandria]] used the toponym Palestine . .He listed local Palestinian toponyms and rendered them familiar to Graeco-Roman audiences.  .  Medieval Muslims and modern Palestinians preserved Greco-Roman toponyms such as [[Nablus]] (Greek: Neapolis/Νεάπολις), Palestine, Qaysariah ([[Caesaria]]/Καισάρεια), but not [[Amman|Philadelphia]].'</ref> in that region at the time of the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|advent of Islam]].<ref>Mila Neishtadt. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lai8CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA282  'The Lexical Substrate of Aramaic in Palestinian Arabic,'] in Aaron Butts (ed.) ''Semitic Languages in Contact,'' [[Brill Publishers|BRILL]] 2015  pp.281-282:'As in other cases of language shift, the supplanting language (Arabic) was not left untouched by the supplanted language (Aramaic) and the existence of an Aramaic substrate in Syro-Palestinian colloquial Arabic has been widely accepted. The influence of the Aramaic substrate is especially evidence in many Palestinian place names, and in the vocabularies of traditional life and industrials: agriculture, flora, fauna, food, tools, utensils etc.' </ref>

[[C.&nbsp;R. Conder]] (1848–1910) of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] was among the first to recognize the importance of analyzing Arabic place names in order to determine a site's more ancient Hebrew name. Conder's contribution was unique in that he did not eradicate the Arabic place names in his [[Survey of Western Palestine]] maps, but preserved their names intact, rather than attribute a site to a dubious identification.<ref name= "Hopkins1968">Hopkins, I.W.J. (1968), p. 34. '''Quote:''' "Conder collected the current Arabic names for the places on his [P.E.F.] maps, which on the face of it makes them appear to be less useful, compared with [[Pierre Jacotin|Jacotin]]'s [map]. In fact, this makes the P.E.F. map even more useful as evidence of the current Arab place name, and the sheets are not cluttered up with doubtful identifications. The Arabic name is often a corruption of the ancient name and this fact has helped enormously in locating Biblical, Classical and Byzantine sites."</ref> In his memoirs, he mentions that the Hebrew and Arabic traditions of place names are often consonant with each other:   

<blockquote>The names of the old towns and villages mentioned in the Bible remain for the most part almost unchanged... The fact that each name was carefully recorded in Arabic letters made it possible to compare with the Hebrew in a scientific and scholarly manner... When the Hebrew and the Arabic are shown to contain the same radicals, the same gutturals, and often the same meanings, we have a truly reliable comparison... We have now recovered more than three-quarters of the Bible names, and are thus able to say with confidence that the Bible topography is a genuine and actual topography, the work of Hebrews familiar with the country.<ref>[[C. R. Conder|Conder, Major C. R.]] (n.d.), pp. 218–219</ref></blockquote>

==First modern Hebraization efforts==
Modern Hebraization efforts began from the time in the [[First Aliyah]] in 1880.<ref name="Fields2017">{{cite book|last=Fields|first=Gary|title=Enclosure: Palestinian Landscapes in a Historical Mirror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3UpDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA222|date=5 September 2017|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-29104-1|pages=222|ref=none}}</ref> In the early 1920s, the [[HeHalutz]] youth movement began a Hebraization program for newly established settlements in [[Mandatory Palestine]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Boaz Neumann|title=Land and Desire in Early Zionism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jIcSHW1hpeEC&pg=PA167|year=2011|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-58465-968-6|page=167|ref=none}}</ref> These names, however, were applied only to sites purchased by the [[Jewish National Fund]] (JNF), as they had no sway over the names of other sites in Palestine. 

Seeing that directional signposts were frequently inscribed only in the Arabic language with their English transliterations (excluding their equivalent Hebrew names), the Jewish community in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], led by prominent Zionists such as [[David Yellin]], tried to influence the naming process initiated by the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s (RGS's) Permanent Committee on Geographical Names,<ref name="Fields2017"/>{{sfn|Bitan|1992|p=366}} so as to make the naming more inclusive.{{sfn|Maisler|Ben-Zvi|Klein|Press|1932|pp=3-5 (Preface)}} Despite these efforts, well-known cities and geographical places, such as Jerusalem, Jericho, Nablus, Hebron, the Jordan River, etc. carried names in both Hebrew and Arabic writing (e.g. [[Jerusalem]] / Al Quds / ''Yerushalayim'' and [[Hebron]] / Al Khalil / ''Ḥevron''),<ref>[[Elkan Nathan Adler|Adler, Elkan Nathan]] (2014), pp. 225, et al.</ref> but lesser-known classical Jewish sites of antiquity (e.g. [[Jish]] / ''Gush Halab''; [[Beisan]] /''Beit She'an''; [[Shefa-'Amr|Shefar-amr]] / ''Shefarʻam''; [[Kafr 'Inan]] / ''Kefar Hananiah''; [[Beit Jibrin]] / ''Beit Gubrin'', etc.) remained inscribed after their Arabic names, without change or addition.<ref name= "EGleichen1925">[[Lord Edward Gleichen|Gleichen, Edward]], ed. (1925). '''Quote:''' (Preface) "The following List of Names in Palestine, having been submitted through H.M.

'''Quote:''' (p. 2) "The list of geographical names has presented many difficulties. Many place names in Palestine are of Arabic origin while others are of Hebrew, Phoenician, Greek, Latin, or Frankish ancestry –– to mention only the most important sources –– but, as most places are inhabited by Arabic-speaking people, local usage has given them names in Arabicised forms or in colloquial Arabic. To adopt the colloquial forms in transliterating names was not considered consistent with the end in view, and as a general rule an effort has been made to put the names in as literary a garb as possible. In most names of Arabic origin this was comparatively easy; but in some the Arab experts recommended the retention of forms not usually admitted in Arabic grammatical word construction."</ref>{{sfn|Maisler|Ben-Zvi|Klein|Press|1932|pp=3-5 (Preface)}} The main objection to adding additional spellings for ancient Hebrew toponymy was the fear that it would cause confusion to the postal service, when long accustomed names were given new names, as well as be totally at variance with the names already inscribed on maps. Therefore, British officials sought to ensure unified forms of place names.<ref>[[Lord Edward Gleichen|Gleichen, Edward]] (1920), p. 309</ref>

One of the motivating factors behind members of the [[Yishuv]] to apply Hebrew names to old Arabic names, despite attempts to the contrary by the RGS Committee for Names,{{sfn|Maisler|Ben-Zvi|Klein|Press|1932|pp=3-5 (Preface)}} was the belief by [[historical geographers]], both Jewish and non-Jewish, that many Arabic place names were mere "corruptions" of older Hebrew names<ref>[[Meron Benvenisti|Benvenisti, M.]] (2000), pp. 47–48. Quote: "The Arab conquerors who colonized the land following the conquest of 638 C.E. settled among its Jewish, Samaritan, and Christian natives. They easily assimilated the Hebrew-Aramaic geographical and topographical names, and, their language being closely related to the Semitic languages spoken there, they made only slight changes in spelling and pronunciation. They had no difficulty finding Arabic forms for names such as Ashkelon –– which they transformed into ''Asqalan'' –– Beit Horon to ''Beit Ghur'', Beersheba to ''Bir Saba'a'', and Eilat to ''Aila''."</ref> (e.g. ''Khirbet Shifat'' = [[Yodfat]]; ''Khirbet Tibneh'' = [[Timnah]];<ref>[[Clermont-Ganneau]] (1896), pp. 67–68, 214, where he wrote: (p. 214) "''Tibneh'', 'chopped straw', one would swear was Arabic, but it is beyond a doubt that it is the name of the town ''Timnah'', brought into that shape by one of those popular etymologies which are as dear to the peasantry of Palestine as to those of our European countries." On pp. 67–68 he wrote: "One has to beware, however, of these appellations that appear to be of purely Arabic origin, they are often ancient Hebrew names converted by a process of popular etymology into words familiar to the Arabs. In many cases slight phonetic changes assist the process. These , by the bye, are not arbitrary, but are subject to real laws. Thus, for instance, the name of the Bible town of Thimnah has become in ''[[Peasant|fellâh]]'' speech ''Tibneh'', 'chopped straw'."</ref><ref>[[Edward Robinson (scholar)|Robinson, E.]] (1860), p. [https://archive.org/details/biblicalresearc08smitgoog/page/n38/mode/2up 17]. See alao [[John William McGarvey]] (1829–1911) who quotes [[C. R.

At other times, the history of assigning the "restored Hebrew name" to a site has been fraught with errors and confusion, as in the case of the ruin ''[[Iraq al-Manshiyya|ʻIrâq el-Menshiyeh]]'', situated where [[Kiryat Gat]] now stands. Initially, it was given the name ''Tel Gath'', based on [[W.F. Albright|Albright]]'s identification of the site with the biblical Gath. When this was found to be a misnomer, its name was changed to ''[[Tel Erani]]'', which, too, was found to be an erroneous designation for what was thought to be the old namesake for the site.{{sfn|Press|2014|pp=181–182}}

According to Professor [[Virginia Tilley]], "[a] body of scientific, linguistic, literary, historical, and biblical authorities was invented to foster impressions of Jewish belonging and natural rights in a Jewish homeland reproduced from a special Jewish right to this land, which clearly has been occupied, through the millennia, by many peoples."<ref name="Tilley2005">[[Virginia Tilley|Tilley]] (2005), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4-Mun0HBek4C&pg=PP190 190]</ref> 

As early as 1920, a Hebrew sub-committee was established by the British government in Palestine with the aim of advising the government on the English transcript of names of localities and in determining the form of the Hebrew names for official use by the government.{{sfn|Bitan|1992|p=366}}

==JNF Naming Committee==
In 1925, the [[Jewish National Fund]] established the ''Names Committee for the Settlements'', led directly by the head of the JNF, [[Menachem Ussishkin]].{{sfn|Benvenisti|2000|p=26}}

[[Meron Benvenisti]] writes that the Arabic geographical names upset the new Jewish community, for example on 22 April 1941 the [[Zevulun Regional Council|Emeq Zevulun Settlements Committee]] wrote to the head office of the JNF:{{sfn|Benvenisti|2000|p=30}}
<blockquote>Such names as the following are displayed in all their glory: Karbassa, al- Sheikh Shamali, Abu Sursuq, Bustan al-Shamali – all of them names that the JNF has no interest in immortalizing in the Z'vulun Valley.... We recommend to you that you send a circular letter to all of the settlements located on JNF land in the Z'vulun Valley and its immediate vicinity and warn them against continuing the above-mentioned practice [i.e., the use of] old maps that, from various points of view, are dangerous to use.</blockquote>

Between 1925 and 1948, the JNF Naming Committee gave names to 215 Jewish communities in Palestine.<ref name="Fields2017"/> Although sweeping changes had come over the names of old geographic sites, a record of their old names is preserved on the old maps.<ref>A British Mandate map, contained at the [[National Library of Israel]] ([https://web.nli.org.il/sites/nlis/en/maps/pages/default.aspx Eran Laor Cartographic Collection], Jaffa: Survey of Palestine 1928 – 1947, "Palestine" (Pal 1157)); an Ottoman period map, the [[PEF Survey of Palestine|Palestine Exploration Fund Map]], published by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] [http://www.iaa-archives.org.il/zoom/zoom.aspx?folder_id=93&type_id=6&id=8363 SWP web-site], and which is chiefly studied by archaeologists and historical geographers when trying to determine what Arabic place names are representative of ancient Hebrew toponymy.

===Arabic language preeminence===
By 1931, the destinational listings at post offices, signs at train stations and place names listed in the telephone directory, had removed any mention in Hebrew of "Shechem" (''Nablus''), "Nazareth,"  and "[[Nahal Sorek|Naḥal Sorek]]" (''Wadi es-Sarar''), which aroused the concern of the [[Jewish National Council]] that the British Government of Palestine was being prejudicial towards its Jewish citizens.{{sfn|Maisler|Ben-Zvi|Klein|Press|1932|p=6}} Naḥal Sorek, was a major route and thoroughfare when commuting by train from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Hartuv]].

==1949: Committee for the Designation of Place-Names in the Negev==
In late 1949, after the [[1947–1949 Palestine war]], the new Israeli government created the Committee for the Designation of Place-Names in the Negev Region, a group of nine scholars whose job was to assign Hebrew names to towns, mountains, valleys, springs, roads, etc., in the [[Negev]] region.{{sfn|Benvenisti|2000|p=12}} Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] had decided on the importance of renaming in the area earlier in the year, writing in his diary in July: "We must give Hebrew names to these places – ancient names, if there are, and if not, new ones!";<ref name="Masalha2012">{{cite book|author=Nur Masalha|title=The Palestine Nakba: Decolonising History, Narrating the Subaltern, Reclaiming Memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=px1jDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT72|date=9 August 2012|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|isbn=978-1-84813-973-2|pages=72–|ref=none}}</ref> he subsequently established the committee's objectives with a letter to the chairman of the committee:{{sfn|Benvenisti|2000|p=12}}
<blockquote>We are obliged to remove the Arabic names for reasons of state. Just as we do not recognize the Arabs' political proprietorship of the land, so also do we not recognize their spiritual proprietorship and their names.</blockquote>

In the Negev, 333 of the 533 new names which the committee decided upon were transliterations of, or otherwise similar-sounding to, the Arabic names.{{sfn|Benvenisti|2000|p=17}} According to Bevenisti, some members of the committee had objected to the eradication of Arabic place names, but in many cases they were overruled by political and nationalistic considerations.{{sfn|Benvenisti|2000|p=17}}

==1951: Governmental Naming Committee==
In March 1951, the JNF committee and the Negev committee were merged to cover all of Israel.{{sfn|Benvenisti|2000|p=24}} The new merged committee stated their belief that the "Judaization of the geographical names in our country [is] a vital issue".{{sfn|Benvenisti|2000|p=24}} The work was ongoing as of 1960; in February&nbsp;1960 the director of the [[Survey of Israel]], Yosef Elster, wrote that "We have ascertained that the replacement of Arabic names with Hebrew ones is not yet complete. The committee must quickly fill in what is missing, especially the names of ruins."{{sfn|Benvenisti|2000|p=40}} In April&nbsp;1951, [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] and Dr. [[Benjamin Maisler]] were appointed to the [[Government Naming Committee]].<ref>{{Citation |contribution=State of Israel Records |title=Collection of Publications, no. 152 |publisher=Government of Israel|place=Jerusalem|year=1951 |page=845|url=https://www.nevo.co.il/Law_word/law10/yalkut-0152.pdf |language=he }}</ref>  

Between 1920 and 1990, the different committees had set Hebrew names for some 7,000 natural elements in the country, of which more than 5,000 were geographical place names, several hundred were names of historical sites, and over a thousand were names given to new settlements.{{sfn|Bitan|1992|p=367}} [[Zev Vilnay|Vilnay]] has noted that, since the 19th&nbsp;century, biblical words, expressions and phrases have provided names for many urban and rural settlements and neighborhoods in Modern Israel.{{sfn|Vilnay|1983|p=Abstract}}

Palmer]] describes the site ''Khŭrbet Jurfa'' as "the ruin of the perpendicular bank (cut out by the torrent in the ''débris'' of a valley)."</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Avner|first=Rina |title=Rogelit |journal=Hadashot Arkheologiyot: Excavations and Surveys in Israel |publisher=[[Israel Antiquities Authority]]|volume=118 |date=2006|url=http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=355&mag_id=111|language=en}}</ref> [[Allar, Jerusalem|Allar]] becoming [[Mata, Israel|Mata]]; [[Al-Tira, Ramle|al-Tira]] becoming ''Kfar Halutzim'', which is now [[Bareket]], etc.), leaving no traces of their former designations, [[Meron Benvenisti|Benvenisti]] has shown that the memorial of these ancient places had not been utterly lost through hegemonic practices:
<blockquote>Approximately one-quarter of the 584 Arab villages that were standing in the 1980s, had names whose origins were ancient – biblical, Hellenistic, or Aramaic.{{sfn|Benvenisti|2000|p=49}}</blockquote>

{{As of|1992|post=,}} the Israeli Government Naming Committee prohibits giving a name to a new settlement if its name cannot be shown to be connected in some way to the immediate area or region.{{sfn|Bitan|1992|p=369}}

==Modern trends==
In certain areas of Israel, particularly mixed Jewish–Arab cities, there is a growing trend to restore the original Arabic street names which were Hebraized after 1948.<ref name=Rekhess/><ref name=OA/>
