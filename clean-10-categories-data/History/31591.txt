'''Time travel''' is the concept of movement between certain points in [[time]], [[analogy|analogous]] to movement between different points in [[space]] by an object or a person, typically with the use of a hypothetical device known as a '''time machine'''. Time travel is a widely recognized concept in [[philosophy of space and time|philosophy]] and sci-[[time travel in fiction|fiction]]. The idea of a time machine was popularized by [[H. G. Wells]]'s 1895 novel ''[[The Time Machine]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Astounding Wonder: Imagining Science and Science Fiction in Interwar America|edition=illustrated|first1=John|last1=Cheng|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-8122-0667-8|page=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GoyzFw9UR8IC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=GoyzFw9UR8IC&pg=PA180 Extract of page 180]</ref>

It is uncertain if time travel to the past is physically possible. Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of [[time perception|the perception of time]], is an extensively observed phenomenon and well-understood within the framework of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology. As for backward time travel, it is possible to find [[exact solutions in general relativity|solutions in general relativity]] that allow for it, such as a rotating [[black hole]]. Traveling to an arbitrary point in spacetime has very limited support in [[theoretical physics]], and is usually connected only with [[quantum mechanics of time travel|quantum mechanics]] or [[wormhole]]s.

=== Shift to science fiction ===
Early science fiction stories feature characters who sleep for years and awaken in a changed society, or are transported to the past through supernatural means. Among them ''L'An 2440, rêve s'il en fût jamais'' (1770) by [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]], ''[[Rip Van Winkle]]'' (1819) by [[Washington Irving]], ''[[Looking Backward]]'' (1888) by [[Edward Bellamy]], and ''[[The Sleeper Awakes|When the Sleeper Awakes]]'' (1899) by H.G. Wells. Prolonged sleep, like the more familiar [[#Early time machines|time machine]], is used as a means of time travel in these stories.<ref>{{citation|title=The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature|chapter=Utopia, dystopia, and science fiction|author=Peter Fitting|editor=Gregory Claeys|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|pages=138–139}}</ref> The degree to which a literary device such as a greatly prolonged sleep constitutes time travel is disputed.<ref>''See'', ''e.g.'', Lucy Pollard-Gott, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RZPCg5QW564C&pg=PA350 The Fictional 100: Ranking the Most Influential Characters in World Literature and Legend]'' (2010), p. 350: "Rip Van Winkle was, in fact, a time traveler.

The earliest work about backwards time travel is uncertain.

== Time travel in physics ==
Some theories, most notably [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], suggest that suitable geometries of [[spacetime]] or specific types of motion in [[space]] might allow time travel into the past and future if these geometries or motions were possible.<ref name="Thorne1994">{{cite book|last=Thorne|first=Kip S.|author-link=Kip Thorne|title=Black Holes and Time Warps|publisher=W.

There are known to be solutions to the equations of general relativity that describe spacetimes which contain closed timelike curves, such as [[Gödel metric#Closed timelike curves|Gödel spacetime]], but the physical plausibility of these solutions is uncertain.

Many in the scientific community believe that backward time travel is highly unlikely. Any theory that would allow time travel would introduce potential problems of [[causality (physics)|causality]].<ref name="Bolonkin">{{cite book|title=Universe, Human Immortality and Future Human Evaluation|first1=Alexander|last1=Bolonkin|publisher=Elsevier|year=2011|isbn=978-0-12-415810-8|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFZWTf93KwgC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=IFZWTf93KwgC&pg=PA32 Extract of page 32]</ref> The classic example of a problem involving causality is the "[[grandfather paradox]]": what if one were to go back in time and kill one's own grandfather before one's father was conceived?

=== General relativity ===
Time travel to the past is theoretically possible in certain general relativity spacetime geometries that permit traveling [[faster-than-light|faster than the speed of light]], such as [[cosmic string]]s, transversable [[wormhole]]s, and [[Alcubierre drive]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccrg.rit.edu/files/FasterThanLight.pdf|title=Warp Drives, Wormholes, and Black Holes|author=Miguel Alcubierre|date=June 29, 2012|access-date=January 25, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Gott">{{cite book|author=J.

==== Different spacetime geometries ====
The theory of [[general relativity]] describes the universe under a system of [[Einstein field equations|field equations]] that determine the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], or distance function, of spacetime. There exist exact solutions to these equations that include [[closed time-like curve]]s, which are [[world line]]s that intersect themselves; some point in the causal future of the world line is also in its causal past, a situation that can be described as time travel. Such a solution was first proposed by [[Kurt Gödel]], a solution known as the [[Gödel metric]], but his (and others') solution requires the universe to have physical characteristics that it does not appear to have,<ref name="Thorne1994"/>{{rp|499}} such as [[Mach's principle|rotation]] and lack of [[Hubble expansion]]. Whether general relativity forbids closed time-like curves for all realistic conditions is still being researched.<ref name="Hawking">S. W. Hawking, ''Introductory note to 1949 and 1952'' in Kurt Gödel, ''Collected works'', Volume II (S. Feferman et al., eds).</ref>

==== Wormholes ====
{{main|Wormhole}}
Wormholes are a hypothetical warped spacetime permitted by the [[Einstein field equations]] of general relativity.<ref name="Visser1996">{{cite book|last=Visser|first=Matt|author-link=Matt Visser|title=Lorentzian Wormholes|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1996|isbn=978-1-56396-653-8}}</ref>{{rp|100}} A proposed time-travel machine using a [[wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]] would hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced [[vehicle propulsion|propulsion system]], and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both these methods, [[time dilation]] causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become "younger", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently ''through'' the wormhole than ''outside'' it, so that [[synchronization|synchronized]] clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.<ref name="Thorne1994" />{{rp|502}} This means that an observer entering the "younger" end would exit the "older" end at a time when it was the same age as the "younger" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside. One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine;<ref name="Thorne1994" />{{rp|503}} in essence, it is more of a path through time than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.

According to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as "[[exotic matter]]". More technically, the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various [[energy condition]]s, such as the null energy condition along with the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. However, it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition,<ref name="Visser1996" />{{rp|101}} and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the [[Casimir effect]] in quantum physics.<ref name="casimir">{{cite web|url=http://www.npl.washington.edu/av/altvw69.html|title=NASA Goes FTL Part 1: Wormhole Physics|work=Analog Science Fiction & Fact Magazine|year=1994|accessdate=December 2, 2006|last1=Cramer|first1=John G.|author-link=John G.

In 1993, [[Matt Visser]] argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other.<ref name="visser_1">{{cite journal|first=Matt|last=Visser|author-link=Matt Visser|title=From wormhole to time machine: Comments on Hawking's Chronology Protection Conjecture|journal=Physical Review D|volume=47|year=1993|issue=2|pages=554–565|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.47.554|pmid=10015609|arxiv=hep-th/9202090|bibcode=1993PhRvD..47..554V|s2cid=16830951}}</ref> Because of this, the two mouths could not be brought close enough for [[causality (physics)|causality]] violation to take place. However, in a 1997 paper, Visser hypothesized that a complex "[[Roman ring]]" (named after Tom Roman) configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine, although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible.<ref name="visser_2">{{cite journal|first=Matt|last=Visser|author-link=Matt Visser|title=Traversable wormholes: the Roman ring|journal=Physical Review D|volume=55|year=1997|issue=8|pages=5212–5214|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5212|arxiv=gr-qc/9702043|bibcode=1997PhRvD..55.5212V|s2cid=2869291}}</ref>

If a cylinder is infinitely long and spins fast enough about its long axis, then a spaceship flying around the cylinder on a spiral path could travel back in time (or forward, depending on the direction of its spiral). However, the density and speed required is so great that ordinary matter is not strong enough to construct it. A similar device might be built from a [[cosmic string]], but none are known to exist, and it does not seem to be possible to create a new cosmic string. Physicist [[Ronald Mallett]] is attempting to recreate the conditions of a rotating black hole with ring lasers, in order to bend spacetime and allow for time travel.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.connecticutmag.com/health-and-science/uconn-professor-seeks-funding-for-time-machine-feasibility-study/article_6f20c86e-7bf1-5796-a214-eb1bea3ed98f.html|title=UConn Professor Seeks Funding for Time Machine Feasibility Study|author=Erik Ofgang|date=August 13, 2015|work=Connecticut Magazine|accessdate=May 8, 2017}}</ref>

A more fundamental objection to time travel schemes based on rotating cylinders or cosmic strings has been put forward by Stephen Hawking, who proved a theorem showing that according to general relativity it is impossible to build a time machine of a special type (a "time machine with the compactly generated Cauchy horizon") in a region where the [[weak energy condition]] is satisfied, meaning that the region contains no matter with negative energy density ([[exotic matter]]).

But Hawking points out that because of his theorem, "it can't be done with positive energy density everywhere!

One can define geometrical quantities that measure the Lorentz boost and area increase on going round these closed null geodesics. If the causality violation developed from a noncompact initial surface, the averaged weak energy condition must be violated on the Cauchy horizon."<ref name="chronology protection" /> This theorem does not rule out the possibility of time travel by means of time machines with the non-compactly generated Cauchy horizons (such as the Deutsch-Politzer time machine) or in regions which contain exotic matter, which would be used for traversable wormholes or the [[Alcubierre drive]] and [[black hole]].

When a signal is sent from one location and received at another location, then as long as the signal is moving at the speed of light or slower, the mathematics of [[relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity]] in the theory of relativity show that all reference frames agree that the transmission-event happened before the reception-event.

Quantum-mechanical phenomena such as [[quantum teleportation]], the [[EPR paradox]], or [[quantum entanglement]] might appear to create a mechanism that allows for faster-than-light (FTL) communication or time travel, and in fact some interpretations of quantum mechanics such as the [[Bohm interpretation]] presume that some information is being exchanged between particles instantaneously in order to maintain correlations between particles.<ref name="Bohm">{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/|title=Bohmian Mechanics|date=March 27, 2017|accessdate=April 26, 2017|last1=Goldstein|first1=Sheldon}}</ref> This effect was referred to as "[[action at a distance (physics)#Quantum mechanics|spooky action at a distance]]" by Einstein.

Nevertheless, the fact that causality is preserved in quantum mechanics is a rigorous result in modern [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]], and therefore modern theories do not allow for time travel or [[superluminal communication|FTL communication]]. In any specific instance where FTL has been claimed, more detailed analysis has proven that to get a signal, some form of classical communication must also be used.<ref name="Nielsen and Chuang">{{cite book|last1=Nielsen|last2=Chuang|first1=Michael|first2=Isaac|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information|url=https://archive.org/details/quantumcomputati00niel_056|url-access=limited|publisher=Cambridge|year=2000|page=[https://archive.org/details/quantumcomputati00niel_056/page/n55 28]|isbn=978-0-521-63235-5}}</ref> The [[no-communication theorem]] also gives a general proof that quantum entanglement cannot be used to transmit information faster than classical signals.

==== Interacting many-worlds interpretation ====
A variation of [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]] (MWI) of quantum mechanics provides a resolution to the grandfather paradox that involves the time traveler arriving in a different universe than the one they came from; it's been argued that since the traveler arrives in a different universe's history and not their own history, this is not "genuine" time travel.<ref>{{citation|title=Time Travel and Modern Physics|date=December 23, 2009|author1=Frank Arntzenius|author2=Tim Maudlin|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel-phys/|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> The accepted many-worlds interpretation suggests that all possible quantum events can occur in mutually exclusive histories.<ref name="many-worlds">{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/|title=Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics|date=January 17, 2014|accessdate=April 26, 2017|last1=Vaidman|first1=Lev}}</ref> However, some variations allow different universes to interact.

=== Experimental results ===
Certain experiments carried out give the impression of reversed [[causality]], but fail to show it under closer examination.

The [[delayed choice quantum eraser]] experiment performed by [[Marlan Scully]] involves pairs of [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] [[photon]]s that are divided into "signal photons" and "idler photons", with the signal photons emerging from one of two locations and their position later measured as in the [[double-slit experiment]]. Depending on how the idler photon is measured, the experimenter can either learn which of the two locations the signal photon emerged from or "erase" that information. Even though the signal photons can be measured before the choice has been made about the idler photons, the choice seems to retroactively determine whether or not an [[interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]] is observed when one correlates measurements of idler photons to the corresponding signal photons. However, since interference can be observed only after the idler photons are measured and they are correlated with the signal photons, there is no way for experimenters to tell what choice will be made in advance just by looking at the signal photons, only by gathering classical information from the entire system; thus causality is preserved.<ref name=Greene2004>{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Brian|title=The Fabric of the Cosmos|url=https://archive.org/details/fabricofcosmossp00gree|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=Alfred A.

The experiment of Lijun Wang might also show causality violation since it made it possible to send packages of waves through a bulb of caesium gas in such a way that the package appeared to exit the bulb 62 nanoseconds before its entry, but a wave package is not a single well-defined object but rather a sum of multiple waves of different frequencies (see [[Fourier analysis]]), and the package can appear to move faster than light or even backward in time even if none of the pure waves in the sum do so. This effect cannot be used to send any matter, energy, or information faster than light,<ref name="gauthier">{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Laura|title=Score Another Win for Albert Einstein|magazine=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]|date=November 6, 2003|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2003/nov/score-another-win-for-einstein1106}}</ref> so this experiment is understood not to violate causality either.

The physicists [[Günter Nimtz]] and Alfons Stahlhofen, of the [[University of Koblenz]], claim to have violated Einstein's theory of relativity by transmitting photons faster than the speed of light. They say they have conducted an experiment in which [[microwave]] photons traveled "instantaneously" between a pair of prisms that had been moved up to {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} apart, using a phenomenon known as [[quantum tunneling]]. Nimtz told ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine: "For the time being, this is the only violation of special relativity that I know of." However, other physicists say that this phenomenon does not allow information to be transmitted faster than light. Aephraim Steinberg, a quantum optics expert at the [[University of Toronto]], Canada, uses the analogy of a train traveling from Chicago to New York, but dropping off train cars at each station along the way, so that the center of the train moves forward at each stop; in this way, the speed of the center of the train exceeds the speed of any of the individual cars.<ref name="nimtz">{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Mark|title=Light seems to defy its own speed limit|magazine=[[New Scientist]]|volume=195|issue=2617|page=10|date=August 18–24, 2007|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-08/ns-lst081607.php}}</ref>

[[Shengwang Du]] claims in a peer-reviewed journal to have observed single photons' [[precursor (physics)|precursor]]s, saying that they travel no faster than ''[[speed of light|c]]'' in a vacuum. His experiment involved [[slow light]] as well as passing light through a vacuum. He generated two single [[photon]]s, passing one through rubidium atoms that had been cooled with a laser (thus slowing the light) and passing one through a vacuum. Both times, apparently, the precursors preceded the photons' main bodies, and the precursor traveled at ''c'' in a vacuum. According to Du, this implies that there is no possibility of light traveling faster than ''c'' and, thus, no possibility of violating causality.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ust.hk/eng/news/press_20110719-893.html|publisher=The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology|accessdate=September 5, 2011|title=HKUST Professors Prove Single Photons Do Not Exceed the Speed of Light|date=July 17, 2011}}</ref>

=== Absence of time travelers from the future ===
[[File:WelcomeKrononauts Artforum Jan1980 p.90 800x600.png|thumb|Krononauts]]
The absence of time travelers from the future is a variation of the [[Fermi paradox]]. As the absence of extraterrestrial visitors does not prove they do not exist, so the absence of time travelers fails to prove time travel is physically impossible; it might be that time travel is physically possible but is never developed or is cautiously used. [[Carl Sagan]] once suggested the possibility that time travelers could be here but are disguising their existence or are not recognized as time travelers.<ref name="sagan-nova" /> Some versions of general relativity suggest that time travel might only be possible in a region of [[spacetime]] that is warped a certain way, and hence time travelers would not be able to travel back to earlier regions in spacetime, before this region existed. [[Stephen Hawking]] stated that this would explain why the world has not already been overrun by "tourists from the future".<ref name="Hawking warp">{{cite web|url=https://www.hawking.org.uk/in-words/lectures/space-and-time-warps|title=Space and Time Warps|year=1999|accessdate=September 23, 2020|last1=Hawking|first1=Stephen}}</ref>

Several experiments have been carried out to try to entice future humans, who might invent time travel technology, to come back and demonstrate it to people of the present time. Events such as Perth's Destination Day or [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[Time Traveler Convention]] heavily publicized permanent "advertisements" of a meeting time and place for future time travelers to meet.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.wired.com/2005/05/time-travelers-welcome-at-mit/|title=Time Travelers Welcome at MIT|author=Mark Baard|date=September 5, 2005|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> In 1982, a group in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], identifying itself as the Krononauts, hosted an event of this type welcoming visitors from the future.<ref>{{cite news|last=Franklin|first=Ben A.|date=March 11, 1982|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E13FD395F0C728DDDAA0894DA484D81|title=The night the planets were aligned with Baltimore lunacy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206170526/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E13FD395F0C728DDDAA0894DA484D81|archive-date=2008-12-06|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>"Welcome the People from the Future.

For two identical clocks moving relative to each other without accelerating, each clock measures the other to be ticking slower. This is possible due to the [[relativity of simultaneity]]. However, the symmetry is broken if one clock accelerates, allowing for less proper time to pass for one clock than the other. The [[twin paradox]] describes this: one twin remains on Earth, while the other undergoes acceleration to [[relativistic speed]] as they travel into space, turn around, and travel back to Earth; the traveling twin ages less than the twin who stayed on Earth, because of the time dilation experienced during their acceleration. General relativity treats the effects of acceleration and the effects of gravity as [[equivalence principle|equivalent]], and shows that time dilation also occurs in [[gravity well]]s, with a clock deeper in the well ticking more slowly; this effect is taken into account when calibrating the clocks on the satellites of the [[Global Positioning System]], and it could lead to significant differences in rates of aging for observers at different distances from a large gravity well such as a [[black hole]].<ref name="Gott"/>{{rp|33–130}}

A time machine that utilizes this principle might be, for instance, a spherical shell with a diameter of five meters and the [[Jupiter mass|mass of Jupiter]].

{{main|Philosophy of space and time}}
Philosophers have discussed the nature of time since at least the time of [[ancient Greece]]; for example, [[Parmenides]] presented the view that time is an illusion. Centuries later, [[Isaac Newton]] supported the idea of [[absolute time and space|absolute time]], while his contemporary [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] maintained that time is only a relation between events and it cannot be expressed independently. The latter approach eventually gave rise to the [[spacetime]] of [[theory of relativity|relativity]].<ref>{{citation|title=The Dictionary of Philosophy|editor=Dagobert D.

[[Presentism (philosophy of time)|Presentism]] is a school of philosophy that holds that the future and the past exist only as changes that occurred or will occur to the present, and they have no real existence of their own. In this view, time travel is impossible because there is no future or past to travel to.<ref name="Crisp" /> Keller and Nelson have argued that even if past and future objects do not exist, there can still be definite truths about past and future events, and thus it is possible that a future truth about a time traveler deciding to travel back to the present date could explain the time traveler's actual appearance in the present;<ref name="Presentism">{{cite journal|first=Simon|last=Keller|author2=Michael Nelson|title=Presentists should believe in time-travel|url=http://people.bu.edu/stk/Papers/Timetravel.pdf|journal= Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=79|issue=3|pages=333–345|date=September 2001|doi=10.1080/713931204|s2cid=170920718|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028211537/http://people.bu.edu/stk/Papers/Timetravel.pdf|archive-date=October 28, 2008}}</ref> these views are contested by some authors.<ref name="Bourne">{{cite book|author=Craig Bourne|title=A Future for Presentism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJMSDAAAQBAJ|date=7 December 2006|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-921280-4}}</ref>

Presentism in classical spacetime deems that only the present exists; this is not reconcilable with special relativity, shown in the following example: Alice and Bob are simultaneous observers of event{{nbsp}}''O''. For Alice, some event{{nbsp}}''E'' is simultaneous with{{nbsp}}''O'', but for Bob, event{{nbsp}}''E'' is in the past or future. Therefore, Alice and Bob disagree about what exists in the present, which contradicts classical presentism. "Here-now presentism" attempts to reconcile this by only acknowledging the time and space of a single point; this is unsatisfactory because objects coming and going from the "here-now" alternate between real and unreal, in addition to the lack of a [[preferred frame|privileged "here-now"]] that would be the "real" present. "Relativized presentism" acknowledges that there are infinite frames of reference, each of them having a different set of simultaneous events, which makes it impossible to distinguish a single "real" present, and hence either all events in time are real—blurring the difference between presentism and eternalism—or each frame of reference exists in its own reality.

==== Compossibility ====
According to the philosophical theory of [[compossibility]], what ''can'' happen, for example in the context of time travel, must be weighed against the context of everything relating to the situation. If the past ''is'' a certain way, it's not possible for it to be any other way. What ''can'' happen when a time traveler visits the past is limited to what ''did'' happen, in order to prevent logical contradictions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=David|title=The paradoxes of time travel|journal=[[American Philosophical Quarterly]]|volume=13|pages=145–52|year=1976|url=http://www.csus.edu/indiv/m/merlinos/Paradoxes%20of%20Time%20Travel.pdf|bibcode=1996gr.qc.....3042K|arxiv=gr-qc/9603042}}</ref>

==== Self-consistency principle ====
The [[Novikov self-consistency principle]], named after [[Igor Dmitrievich Novikov]], states that any actions taken by a time traveler or by an object that travels back in time were part of history all along, and therefore it is impossible for the time traveler to "change" history in any way. The time traveler's actions may be the ''cause'' of events in their own past though, which leads to the potential for [[causal loop|circular causation]], sometimes called a predestination paradox,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry J.|last2=Hutzel|first2=Gary|title=Star Trek: The Magic of Tribbles|date=2001|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=978-0-7434-4623-5|page=31}}</ref> ontological paradox,<ref name="smeenk">{{citation|last1=Smeenk|first1=Chris|last2=Wüthrich|first2=Christian|editor-last=Callender|editor-first=Craig|contribution=Time Travel and Time Machines|title=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Time|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929820-4|page=581}}</ref> or bootstrap paradox.<ref name="smeenk" /><ref>{{citation|last=Krasnikov|first=S.|year=2001|title=The time travel paradox|journal=Phys.

The philosopher Kelley L. Ross argues in "Time Travel Paradoxes"<ref>{{citation|first1=Kelley L.|last1=Ross|url=http://www.friesian.com/paradox.htm|title=Time Travel Paradoxes|year=2016|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref> that in a scenario involving a physical object whose world-line or history forms a closed loop in time there can be a violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Ross uses "[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]" as an example of such an ontological paradox, where a watch is given to a person, and 60 years later the same watch is brought back in time and given to the same character. Ross states that [[entropy]] of the watch will increase, and the watch carried back in time will be more worn with each repetition of its history. The second law of thermodynamics is understood by modern physicists to be a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] law, so [[fluctuation theorem|decreasing entropy or non-increasing entropy]] are not impossible, just improbable. Additionally, entropy statistically increases in systems which are isolated, so non-isolated systems, such as an object, that interact with the outside world, can become less worn and decrease in entropy, and it's possible for an object whose world-line forms a closed loop to be always in the same condition in the same point of its history.<ref name="Gott" />{{rp|23}}

Daniel Greenberger and [[Karl Svozil]] proposed that [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] gives a model for time travel where the past must be self-consistent.<ref name="greenberger">{{cite book|doi=10.1007/3-540-26669-0_4|title=Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics?|year=2005|arxiv=quant-ph/0506027|bibcode=2005qvqm.book...63G|chapter=Quantum Theory Looks at Time Travel|series=The Frontiers Collection|last1=Greenberger|first1=Daniel M.|last2=Svozil|first2=Karl|isbn=978-3-540-22188-3|page=63|s2cid=119468684}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kettlewell|first=Julianna|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4097258.stm|title=New model 'permits time travel'|work=BBC News|date=June 17, 2005|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>

{{further|Time travel in fiction}}
Time travel themes in [[science fiction]] and the media can generally be grouped into three categories: immutable timeline; mutable timeline; and alternate histories, as in the interacting-[[many-worlds interpretation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grey|first=William|title=Troubles with Time Travel|journal=Philosophy|volume=74|issue=1|pages=55–70|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/S0031819199001047}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Rickman|first=Gregg|title=The Science Fiction Film Reader|publisher=Limelight Editions|year=2004|isbn=978-0-87910-994-3|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780879109943}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=Susan|title=Science Fiction and Philosophy: From Time Travel to Superintelligence|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4051-4907-5}}</ref> Frequently in fiction, ''timeline'' is used to refer to all physical events in history, so that in time travel stories where events can be changed, the time traveler is described as creating a new or altered timeline.<ref name="Prucher">Prucher, Jeff (2007) ''Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=iYzi8m8FbEsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA230 p. 230].</ref> This usage is distinct from the use of the term [[timeline]] to refer to a type of chart that illustrates a particular series of events, and the concept is also distinct from a [[world line]], a term from Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] which refers to the entire history of a ''single'' object.
