The '''historicity of Jesus''' relates to whether [[Jesus of Nazareth]] was a [[historical figure]]. Virtually all scholars who have investigated the history of the Christian movement find that the [[historicity]] of Jesus is effectively certain,<ref name="Stanton">{{cite book |last1=Stanton |first1=Graham |title=The Gospels and Jesus (Oxford Bible Series) |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199246168 |page=145 |edition=2nd |quote=Today nearly all historians, whether Christians or not, accept that Jesus existed and that the gospels contain plenty of valuable evidence which has to be weighed and assessed critically.

Just to read the ancient sources requires expertise in a range of ancient languages: Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and often Aramaic, Syriac, and Coptic, not to mention the modern languages of scholarship (for example, German and French). And that is just for starters. Expertise requires years of patiently examining ancient texts and a thorough grounding in the history and culture of Greek and Roman antiquity, the religions of the ancient Mediterranean world, both pagan and Jewish, knowledge of the history of the Christian church and the development of its social life and theology, and, well, lots of other things. It is striking that virtually everyone who has spent all the years needed to attain these qualifications is convinced that Jesus of Nazareth was a real historical figure."}} and standard historical criteria have aided in reconstructing his life.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Bock |editor1-first=Darrell |editor2-last=Webb |editor2-first=Robert |title=Key Events in the Life of the Historical Jesus : A Collaborative Exploration of Context and Coherence |date=2009 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |location=Tübingen |isbn=978-3161501449}}</ref><ref name="Blomberg 2011">{{cite book |last1=Blomberg |first1=Craig |editor1-last=Köstenberger |editor1-first=Andreas J. |editor2-last=Yarbrough |editor2-first=Robert W. |title=Understanding The Times: New Testament Studies in the 21st Century |date=2011 |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1-4335-0719-9 |page=282 |chapter=New Testament Studies in North America |quote=The fruit of a decade of work by the IBR Historical Jesus Study Group, Key Events in the Life of the Historical Jesus: A Collaborative Exploration of Context and Coherence [Ed.

This is the position I have argued in my books of 1996, 1999, and 2004, although the titles of the first two of these-The Jesus Legend and The Jesus Myth-may mislead potential readers into supposing that I still denied the historicity of the gospel Jesus.}}</ref>

Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly [[Quest for the historical Jesus|quests for the historical Jesus]] have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during that phase.<ref name=BenQ9>Ben Witherington, ''The Jesus Quest: The Third Search for the Jew of Nazareth'' (8 May 1997) {{ISBN|0830815449}} pp. 9–13</ref><ref name=AlanP19>''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' by Mark Allan Powell (1 Jan 1999) {{ISBN|0664257038}} pp. 19–23</ref> Various [[Historical Jesus#Methods|criteria of authenticity]] are developed and employed to distinguish early oral elements from later literary elements in the Gospel stories, regarding those early elements as original elements of Jesus' teachings and biography. 

Currently modern scholarly research on the historical Jesus focuses on what is historically probable, or plausible about Jesus.<ref>''John, Jesus, and History'' Volume 1 by Paul N.

{{Main article|Historical Jesus|Portraits of the historical Jesus}}

There is widespread disagreement among scholars on the historicity of specific episodes described in the biblical accounts of Jesus,{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=181}} the details of the life of Jesus mentioned in the gospel narratives, and on the meaning of his teachings.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=168–173}} Many scholars have questioned the [[historicity of the Bible|authenticity]] and [[criticism of the Bible|reliability]] of these sources, and few events mentioned in the gospels are universally accepted.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=181}}

===Baptism and crucifixion===
The only two events subject to "almost universal assent" are that [[Baptism of Jesus|Jesus was baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|was crucified]] by order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate.{{sfn|Herzog|2005|p=1–6}}{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=168–173}}{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}}{{sfn|Crossan|1994|p=145}}{{refn|group=note|name="certain_facts"|Certain facts of Jesus life:
* James Dunn states of "baptism and crucifixion", these "two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent".{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}}
* Crossan: "That he was crucified is as sure as anything historical can ever be, since both [[Josephus]] and [[Tacitus]]&nbsp;... agree with the Christian accounts on at least that basic fact."{{sfn|Crossan|1994|p=45}}}}

According to New Testament scholar [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]], nearly all modern scholars consider the baptism of Jesus and his crucifixion to be historically certain.{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}} He states that these "two facts in the life of Jesus command almost universal assent" and "rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical 'facts' they are obvious starting points for an attempt to clarify the what and why of Jesus' mission."{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=339}} [[John P. Meier]] views the crucifixion of Jesus as historical fact and states that based on the ''[[criterion of embarrassment]]'' Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.<ref name=JMeier126>John P. Meier "How do we decide what comes from Jesus" in ''The Historical Jesus in Recent Research'' by James D. G. Dunn and Scot McKnight 2006 {{ISBN|1-57506-100-7}} pp. 126–128</ref>
The criterion of embarrassment is also used to argue in favor of the historicity of the baptism of Jesus by [[John the Baptist]] as it is a story which the [[early Christianity|early Christian Church]] would have never wanted to invent.<ref name="Powell47" /><ref name=Whois31 >''Who Is Jesus?'' by John Dominic Crossan, Richard G.

[[Amy-Jill Levine]] has summarized the situation by stating that "there is a consensus of sorts on the basic outline of Jesus' life" in that most scholars agree that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, and over a period of one to three years debated Jewish authorities on the subject of God, gathered followers, and was crucified by [[Roman governor|Roman prefect]] Pontius Pilate who officiated 26–36 AD.<ref name=AmyJill4>{{cite book|author1=Amy-Jill Levine|author2=Dale C.

===Other episodes===
There is much in dispute as to his previous life, childhood, family and place of residence, of which the [[canonical gospels]] are almost completely silent.<ref>Eisenmann, Robert, (2001), "James the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls"</ref><ref>Butz, Jeffrey (2005), "The Brother of Jesus and the Lost Traditions of Christianity" (Inner Traditions)</ref><ref>Tabor, James (2012), "Paul and Jesus: How the Apostle Transformed Christianity" (Simon & Schuster)</ref>

Scholars attribute varying levels of certainty to other episodes. [[E. P. Sanders]] proposed eight "indisputable facts" about Jesus's life as a framework for biographical discussion:{{sfn|Herzog|2005|p=1–6}}<ref name=Evans37>''Authenticating the Activities of Jesus'' by Bruce Chilton and Craig A.

==Christ myth theory==

{{Main article|Christ myth theory}}

The [[Christ myth theory]] is the view that "the story of [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] is a piece of [[mythology]]," possessing no "substantial claims to historical fact."{{sfn|Bromiley|1982|p=1034}} Alternatively, in terms given by [[Bart D. Ehrman|Bart Ehrman]] paraphrasing [[Earl Doherty]], "the historical Jesus did not exist. Or if he did, he had virtually nothing to do with the [[Origins of Christianity|founding of Christianity]]."{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|p=12, 347, n. 1}} 

Most [[biblical scholar]]s and [[Classical antiquity|classical historians]] see the theories of his non-existence as effectively refuted,<ref name=Ehrman285/><ref name=Burridge34/><ref name=DunnPaul35>[[James D.

Robert Banks, ed., Carlisle: The Paternoster Press, pp. 125–141, Citing G.A. Wells (''The Jesus of the Early Christians'' (1971)): "Perhaps we should also mention that at the other end of the spectrum Paul’s apparent lack of knowledge of the historical Jesus has been made the major plank in an attempt to revive the nevertheless thoroughly dead thesis that the Jesus of the Gospels was a mythical figure." An almost identical quotation is included in Dunn, James DG (1998) ''The Christ and the Spirit: Collected Essays of James D.G. Dunn, Volume 1'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Pub. Co., p. 191, and Sykes, S.
