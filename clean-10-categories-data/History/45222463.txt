Towns and [[city|cities]] have a long history, although opinions vary on which [[Ancient history|ancient]] settlements are truly cities. The benefits of dense settlement included reduced transport costs, exchange of ideas, sharing of natural resources, large local markets, and in some cases amenities such as [[running water]] and [[sewage]] disposal. Possible costs would include higher rate of crime, higher mortality rates, higher cost of living, worse pollution, traffic and high commuting times. Cities grow when the benefits of proximity between people and firms are higher than the cost.

[[File:Çatalhöyük after the first excavations by James Mellaart and his team..jpg|thumb|Excavated foundations of [[Çatalhöyük]], an Anatolian town dated to 7000 BC.]]
There is not enough [[evidence]] to assert what conditions gave rise to the first cities. Some theorists have speculated on what they consider suitable pre-conditions and basic mechanisms that might have been important driving forces.

The conventional view holds that cities first formed after the [[Neolithic revolution]]. The Neolithic revolution brought agriculture, which made denser human populations possible, thereby supporting city development.<ref>{{Harv |Bairoch|1988| pp=3–4}}</ref> Whether farming immigrants replaced foragers or foragers began farming is not clear. The increased food production per unit of land supported higher population density and more city-like activities. In his book, ''Cities and Economic Development'', [[Paul Bairoch]] takes up this position in his argument that agricultural activity appears necessary before true cities can form.<ref>Bassett, California</ref>

According to [[Vere Gordon Childe]], for a settlement to qualify as a city, it must have enough surplus of raw materials to support trade and a relatively large population.<ref>{{Harv |Pacione|2001| p=16}}</ref> Bairoch points out that, due to sparse population densities that would have persisted in pre-Neolithic, hunter-gatherer societies, the amount of land that would be required to produce enough food for subsistence and trade for a large population would make it impossible to control the flow of trade. To illustrate this point, Bairoch offers an example: "Western Europe during the pre-Neolithic, [where] the density must have been less than 0.1 person per square kilometre".<ref name="Bairoch 1988 13">{{Harv |Bairoch|1988| p=13}}</ref> Using this population density as a base for calculation, and allotting 10% of food towards surplus for trade and assuming that city dwellers do no farming, he calculates that "...to maintain a city with a population of 1,000, and without taking the cost of transport into account, an area of 100,000 square kilometres would have been required. When the cost of transport is taken into account, the figure rises to 200,000 square kilometres&nbsp;...".<ref name="Bairoch 1988 13"/> Bairoch noted that this is roughly the size of [[Great Britain]]. The urban theorist [[Jane Jacobs]] suggests that city formation preceded the birth of agriculture, but this view is not widely accepted.<ref name="Jacobs 1969 23">{{Harv |Jacobs|1969| p=23}}</ref>

In his book ''City Economics'', Brendan O'Flaherty asserts "Cities could persist—as they have for thousands of years—only if their advantages offset the disadvantages".<ref>{{Harv |O'Flaherty|2005| p=12}}</ref> O'Flaherty illustrates two similar attracting advantages known as [[increasing returns to scale]] and [[economies of scale]], which are concepts usually associated with [[business]]es. Their applications are seen in more basic economic systems as well. Increasing returns to scale occurs when "doubling all inputs more than doubles the output [and] an activity has economies of scale if doubling output less than doubles cost".<ref>{{Harv |O'Flaherty|2005| pp=572–573}}</ref> 

Similarly, "Are Cities Dying?", a paper by Harvard economist [[Edward Glaeser|Edward L. Glaeser]], delves into similar reasons for city formation: reduced transport costs for goods, people and ideas. Discussing the benefits of proximity, Glaeser claims that if a city is doubled in size, workers get a ten percent increase in earnings. Glaeser furthers his argument by stating that bigger cities do not pay more for equal productivity than in a smaller city, so it is reasonable to assume that workers become more productive if they move to a city twice the size as they initially worked in. The workers do not benefit much from the ten percent wage increase, because it is recycled back into the higher cost of living in a larger city. They do gain other benefits from living in cities, though.{{which|date=February 2014}}

=== Childe’s ten criteria ===
{{Main|Urban revolution}}

The first true towns are sometimes considered large settlements where the inhabitants were no longer simply farmers of the surrounding area, but began to take on specialized occupations, and where trade, food storage and power were centralized. In 1950 [[Gordon Childe]] attempted to define a historic city with ten general metrics.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 40102108|title = The Urban Revolution|journal = The Town Planning Review|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 3–17|last1 = Childe|first1 = V.

# Size and density of the population should be above normal.
# Differentiation of the population. Not all residents grow their own food, leading to specialists.
# Payment of taxes to a deity or king.
# Monumental public buildings.
# Those not producing their own food are supported by the king.
# Systems of recording and practical science.
# A system of writing.
# Development of symbolic art.
# Trade and import of raw materials.
# Specialist craftsmen from outside the kin-group.
This categorisation is descriptive, and it is used as a general touchstone when considering ancient cities, although not all have each of its characteristics.

==Ancient times==
[[File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld Bibel in Bildern 1860 014.png|left|thumb|Cain founding the city of Enoch]]
The more complex human societies, called the [[first civilization]]s emerged around 3000 BC in the river valleys of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Minoan]], [[India]], [[China]], and [[Egypt]]. An increase in [[food production]] led to the significant growth in human population and the rise of cities. The peoples of [[Southwest Asia]] and Egypt laid the foundations of [[Western civilization]], they developed cities and struggled with the problems of organised states as they moved from individual communities to larger territorial units and eventually to [[empire]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Spielvogel |first=Jackson |date=2014 |title=Western Civilization: Volume A: To 1500 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LceiAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT65 |publisher=Cengage Learning |pages=65– |isbn=978-1-285-98299-1 |accessdate=11 July 2015}}</ref> Among these early civilizations, Egypt is exceptional for its apparent lack of big cities.<ref name=Smith2002>Michael E.

The growth of the population of ancient civilizations, the formation of ancient empires concentrating political power, and the growth in commerce and manufacturing led to ever greater capital cities and centres of commerce and industry, with [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]] and [[Seleucia on the Tigris|Seleucia]] of the [[Hellenistic civilization]], [[Pataliputra]] (now [[Patna]]) in India, [[Chang'an]] (now [[Xi'an]]) in China, [[Carthage]], [[ancient Rome]], its eastern successor Constantinople (now [[Istanbul]]).

The roster of early urban traditions is notable for its diversity. Excavations at early urban sites show that some cities were sparsely populated political capitals, others were trade centers, and still other cities had a primarily religious focus. Some cities had large dense populations, whereas others carried out urban activities in the realms of politics or religion without having large associated populations. Theories that attempt to explain ancient urbanism by a single factor, such as economic benefit, fail to capture the range of variation documented by archaeologists.<ref>Smith 2002</ref>

The earliest known city is [[Çatalhöyük]], a settlement of some 10000 people in southern Anatolia that existed from approximately 7100 BC to 5700 BC. Hunting, agriculture and animal domestication all played a role in the society of Çatalhöyük.

Ancient [[Mesopotamia]], the area of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] within modern day [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]], was home to numerous cities by the third millennium BC. These cities formed the basis of the [[Sumer]]ian and subsequent cultures.<ref>Adams (1981), p. 2. "Southern Mesopotamia was a land of cities. It became one precociously, before the end of the fourth millennium B.C. Urban traditions remained strong and virtually continuous through the vicissitudes of conquest, internal upheaval accompanied by widespread economic breakdown, and massive linguistic and population replacement. The symbolic and material content of civilization obviously changed, but its cultural ambience remained tied to cities."</ref> Cities such as [[Jericho]], [[Uruk]], [[Ur]], [[Nineveh]], and [[Babylon]], made legendary by the [[Bible]], have been located and excavated, while others such as [[Damascus]] and [[Jerusalem]] have been continuously populated.

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] and ancient China are two other areas with major indigenous urban traditions.

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
Agriculture was practiced in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] since the third millennium BC. Because of this, cities could develop as centers of non-agricultural activity, well before the influence of Arab [[urban culture]]. One of the oldest sites documented thus far, [[Jenné-Jeno]] in what is today Mali, has been dated to the third century BC. According to Roderick and Susan McIntosh, Jenné-Jeno did not fit into traditional Western conceptions of urbanity as it lacked monumental architecture and a distinctive elite social class, but it should indeed be considered a city based on a functional redefinition of urban development. In particular, Jenné-Jeno featured settlement mounds arranged according to a horizontal, rather than vertical, power hierarchy, and served as a center of specialized production and exhibited functional interdependence with the surrounding hinterland.<ref>McIntosh, Roderic J., McIntosh, Susan Keech.

In the [[Pre-Columbian era|ancient Americas]], early [[Mesoamerican architecture|urban traditions]] developed in the [[Andes]] and [[Mesoamerica]]. In the Andes, the first urban centers developed in the [[Norte Chico civilization]] (also [[Caral]] or Caral-Supe civilization), [[Chavín culture|Chavin]] and [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] cultures, followed by major cities in the [[Huari culture|Huari]], [[Chimu]] and [[Inca]] cultures. The Norte Chico civilization included as many as 30 major population centers in what is now the [[Norte Chico (Peruvian region)|Norte Chico region]] of north-central coastal [[Peru]].

Teotihuacan, flourishing from 200 BC to AD 750, was the largest American city of the [[pre-Columbian era]], possibly reaching a population of 125,000 in AD 200.

Every other major street, and even the river running through the city, was laid out either parallel or perpendicular to this grand avenue."</ref> Beyond its [[Pyramid of the Sun|ceremonial center]] the city featured religious buildings (23 temple complexes) and myriad workshops. Although its religious system was clearly expansive and significant, details of its political and economic functioning remain matters of speculation.<ref>Southall (1998), 48–50.</ref>

During the [[European Middle Ages]], a town was as much a political entity as a collection of [[house]]s. City residence brought freedom from customary rural obligations to lord and community: ''"[[Stadtluft macht frei]]"'' ("City air makes you free") was a saying in Germany. In [[Continental Europe]] cities with a legislature of their own were not unheard of, the laws for towns as a rule other than for the countryside, the lord of a town often being another than for surrounding land. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], some cities had no other lord than the emperor. Some planned towns were created, in Britain by [[King Edward I]] to colonize [[Wales]] and in France, ''[[bastide]]s'', fortified cities designed on a regular plan.<ref name=Kaplan2004p52>Kaplan et al. (2004), p. 52. "Many cities were constructed with fortifications, or ''bastides'', in mind. These fortifications would often take the form of a regular geometric shape, with towers laid out a[t] regular intervals, and gates allowing entrance into the city itself. The streets within the Bastide city were likewise regularly placed, intended to connect logically to each other, to the central market square, and to the town gates. The placement and pattern of streets was also intended to facilitate the movement of armaments and men to the city defenses. Building took place after the layout had been imposed, creating a more orderly landscape."</ref>

By the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries some cities become powerful states, taking surrounding areas under their control or establishing extensive maritime empires. In Italy [[medieval commune]]s developed into [[Italian city-states|city-states]] including the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Republic of Genoa]]. These cities, with populations in the tens of thousands, amassed enormous wealth by means of extensive trade in eastern [[luxury goods]] such as [[Spice trade|spices]] and [[silk]], as well as [[iron]], [[timber]], and [[slave]]s. Venice [[Venetian Ghetto|introduced]] the ''[[ghetto]]'', a specially regulated neighborhood for [[Jew]]s only. In Northern Europe, cities including [[Lübeck]] and [[Bruges]] formed the [[Hanseatic League]] for collective defense and commerce. Their power was later [[Dutch–Hanseatic War|challenged]] and eclipsed by the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Dutch]] commercial [[History of urban centers in the Low Countries|cities]] of [[Ghent]], [[Ypres]], and [[Amsterdam]].

While the [[city-state]]s, or [[polis|poleis]], of the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Baltic Sea]] languished from the 16th century, [[Western Europe]]'s larger capitals grew again as commercial hubs, especially following the emergence of an [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] trade. By the early 19th century, [[London]] had become the largest city in the world with a population of over a million, while [[Paris]] rivaled the well-developed regionally traditional capital cities of Baghdad, Beijing, Istanbul and [[Kyoto]]. [[Bastion fort]]s arose in an attempt to make cities defensible against strengthening military firepower.<ref name=Kaplan2004p52 />

The Aztec city of [[Tenochtitlan]], in present-day Mexico, had an estimated population between 200,000 and 300,000 when the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés arrived in 1519. During the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] the old Roman city concept was extensively used. Cities were founded in the middle of the newly conquered territories, and were bound to several laws about administration, finances and urbanism.

Most towns remained small, so that in 1500 only some two dozen places in the world contained more than 100,000 inhabitants. As late as 1700, there were fewer than forty, a figure that rose to 300 in 1900.

==Industrial revolution==
[[File:Close No. 101 High Street (-8) LACMA M.2008.40.98.8.jpg|thumb|[[Glasgow]] [[slum]] in 1871]]

The [[industrial revolution|growth of modern industry]] from the late 18th century onward led to massive [[urbanization]] and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas. England led the way as [[London]] became the capital of a [[British empire|world empire]] and cities across the country grew in locations strategic for [[manufacturing]].<ref>Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 53–54. "England was clearly at the center of these changes. London became the first truly global city by placing itself within the new global economy. English colonialism in North America, the Caribbean, South Asia, and later Africa and China helped to further fatten the wallets of many of its merchants. These colonies would later provide many of the raw materials for industrial production. England's hinterland was no longer confined to a portion of the world; it effectively became a global hinterland."</ref> In the United States from 1860 to 1910, the [[History of rail transport|introduction of railroads]] reduced transportation costs, and large manufacturing centers began to emerge, fueling migration from rural to city areas.

Industrialized cities became deadly places to live, due to health problems resulting from [[overcrowding]], [[occupational hazard]]s of industry, contaminated water and air, [[History of water supply and sanitation#Modern age|poor sanitation]], and communicable diseases such as [[typhoid]] and [[cholera]]. [[Factories]] and [[slum]]s emerged as regular features of the urban landscape.<ref>Kaplan et al. (2004), pp. 54–55.</ref>

===Infrastructure===
The 19th century saw the rise of [[public transportation]], such as [[horsebus]]es, followed by [[horse tram]]s. At the end of the 19th century, electric [[urban rail transport]] (including [[tram]]s and [[rapid transit]]) began to replace them, later completed with [[bus]]es and other [[motor vehicles]].

[[Street light]]s were uncommon until [[gas lighting]] became widespread in Europe in the early 19th century. [[Fuel gas]] was also used for heating and cooking. From the 1880s, [[electrification]] began, making electricity the main energy medium in cities until present day.

Modern [[water supply network]]s began to expand during the 19th century.

==20th century==
Growth of cities continued through the twentieth century and increased dramatically in the [[Third World]] (including [[Urbanisation in India|India]], [[Urbanization in China|China]], and [[Urbanization in Africa|Africa]]), due to [[industrialization]], active promotion of urbanization, and other factors.

[[Urban planning]] became widespread and professionalized. At the turn of the century, the "[[Garden city movement|garden city]]" model became the icon of a self-contained, comprehensively designed, residential and commercial settlement. Professional [[urban planner]]s appeared in large numbers, not only to design cities, but to provide technical expertise to their administration.

[[Cities in the great depression]] of the 1930s, especially those with a base in heavy industry, were hard hit by [[unemployment]]. In the U.S. urbanization rate increased forty to eighty percent during 1900–1990. Today the world's population is slightly over half urban,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ncsu.edu/releases/2007/may/104.html |title=Mayday 23: World Population Becomes More Urban Than Rural |publisher=News.ncsu.edu |accessdate=2009-02-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107023453/http://news.ncsu.edu/releases/2007/may/104.html |archivedate=7 January 2009 }}</ref> and continues to urbanize, with roughly a million people moving into cities every 24 hours worldwide.

During the 20th century, [[car]] ownership has increased steady, parallel with [[suburban sprawl]], [[highway]]s and other development for the car. Awareness of [[ecology]] in the mid-20th century created the [[environmental movement]], which has addressed the need for [[sustainable development]].

In the second half of the twentieth century, [[deindustrialization]] (or "[[economic restructuring]]") in the West led to [[poverty]], [[homelessness]], and [[urban decay]] in formerly prosperous cities. America's "Steel Belt" became a "[[Rust Belt]]" and cities such as [[Decline of Detroit|Detroit]], Michigan, and [[Gary, Indiana]] began to [[Shrinking cities|shrink]], contrary to the global trend of massive urban expansion.<ref>Steven High, ''[https://archive.org/details/industrialsunset0000high/page/5 Industrial Sunset: The Making of North America's Rust Belt, 1969-1984]''; University of Toronto Press, 2003; {{ISBN|0-8020-8528-8}}. "It is now clear that the deindustrialization thesis is part myth and part fact. Robert Z. Lawrence, for example, uses aggregate economic data to show that manufacturing employment in the United States did not decline but actually increased from 16.8 million in 1960, to 20.1 million in 1973, and 20.3 million in 1980. However, manufacturing employment was in relative decline. Barry Bluestone noted that manufacturing represented a decreasing proportion of the U.S. labour force, from 26.2 per cent in 1973 to 22.1 per cent in 1980. Studies in Canada have likewise shown that manufacturing employment was only in relative decline during these years. Yet mills and factories did close, and towns and cities lost their industries. John Cumbler submitted that 'depressions do not manifest themselves only at moments of national economic collapse' such as in the 1930s, but 'also recur in scattered sites across the nation in regions, in industries, and in communities.'"</ref> Under the [[Great Leap Forward]] and subsequent [[Five-year plans of China|five-year plans]] continuing today, the [[People's Republic of China]] has undergone concomitant [[urbanization in China|urbanization]] and [[Chinese industrialization|industrialization]] to become the world's leading [[manufacturing|manufacturer]].<ref>James Xiaohe Zhang, "Rapid urbanization in China and its impact on the world economy"; 16th Annual Conference on Global Economic Analysis, "New Challenges for Global Trade in a Rapidly Changing World", Shanhai Institute of Foreign Trade, June 12–14, 2013.</ref><ref>Ian Johnson, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/world/asia/chinas-great-uprooting-moving-250-million-into-cities.html?pagewanted=all China’s Great Uprooting: Moving 250 Million Into Cities]"; ''New York Times'', 15 June 2013.</ref>

==21st century==

There is a debate about whether [[high technology|technology]] and instantaneous communications are making cities obsolete, or reinforcing the importance of big cities as centres of the [[knowledge economy]].<ref>Castells, M. (ed) (2004). ''The network society: a cross-cultural perspective''. London: Edward Elgar. (ebook)</ref><ref>Flew, T. (2008).

London: Little, Brown.</ref> Knowledge-based development of cities, globalization of innovation networks, and broadband services are driving forces of a new city planning paradigm towards [[Smart city|smart cities]] that use technology and communication to create more efficient agglomerations in terms of competitiveness, innovation, environment, energy, utilities, governance, and delivery of services to the citizen. Some companies are building brand new [[land use planning|masterplanned]] cities from scratch on [[greenfield land|greenfield]] sites.
