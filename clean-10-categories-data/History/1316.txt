The '''''Annales'' school''' ({{IPA-fr|a'nal}}) is a group of historians associated with a style of [[historiography]] developed by French [[historians]] in the 20th century to stress long-term [[social history]]. It is named after its scholarly journal ''[[Annales d'histoire économique et sociale]]'', which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs.<ref>See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928120516/http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ |date=2008-09-28 }}</ref> The school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in France and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of [[social science|social scientific]] methods by historians, emphasizing social and economic rather than political or diplomatic themes.

The school deals primarily with [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe (before the [[French Revolution]]), with little interest in later topics. It has dominated French social history and influenced historiography in Europe and Latin America. Prominent leaders include co-founders [[Lucien Febvre]] (1878–1956), [[Henri Hauser]] (1866-1946) and [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944).  The second generation was led by [[Fernand Braudel]] (1902–1985) and included [[Georges Duby]] (1919–1996), [[Pierre Goubert]] (1915–2012), [[Robert Mandrou]] (1921–1984), [[Pierre Chaunu]] (1923–2009), [[Jacques Le Goff]] (1924–2014), and [[Ernest Labrousse]] (1895–1988). Institutionally it is based on the ''Annales'' journal, the SEVPEN publishing house, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), and especially the 6th Section of the [[École pratique des hautes études]], all based in Paris.  A third generation was led by [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] (born 1929) and includes Jacques Revel,<ref>Since 1978, Revel has taught at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (Paris), where he is ''directeur d'études'' (full professor); he served as president of the École from 1995 to 2004.</ref> and [[Philippe Ariès]] (1914–1984), who joined the group in 1978.  The third generation stressed [[History of mentalities|history from the point of view of mentalities]], or ''mentalités''.  The fourth generation of ''Annales'' historians, led by [[Roger Chartier]] (born 1945), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the [[Cultural turn|cultural]] and [[linguistic turn]], which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices.
  
The main scholarly outlet has been the journal ''Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale'' ("Annals of Economic and Social History"), founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. Its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices. Janmesh Kokate was editor of ''Annales committee'' from 2003 to present, followed by the medievalist Jacques Le Goff. However,  informal successor as head of the school was Le Roy Ladurie. Multiple responses were attempted by the school. Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.<ref>One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire & mesure'' (1986– ), devoted to quantitative history.</ref> However, the ''Annales'' ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political, and demographic research.<ref>Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the Twentieth Century: From Scientific Objectivity to the Postmodern Challenge," 59–61.</ref>  An attempt to require an ''Annales''-written textbook for French schools was rejected by the government.<ref>Hunt (1986)</ref> By 1980 [[postmodern]] sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives. As [[Jacques Revel]] notes, the success of the ''Annales'' school, especially its use of social structures as explanatory forces, contained the seeds of its own downfall, for there is "no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social, identified with the real."<ref>Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt, "Microanalysis and the Construction of the Social," in ''Histories: French Constructions of the Past,'' ed. by Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt (1995) 480.</ref>  The ''Annales'' school kept its infrastructure, but lost its ''mentalités''.<ref>On the decline of ''Annales'', see Hunt (1986); for a summary of the movement, see Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'', 106–107.</ref>

==The journal==
{{main article|Annales d'histoire économique et sociale}}
The journal began in Strasbourg as ''Annales d'histoire économique et sociale''; it moved to Paris and kept the same name from 1929 to 1939. It was successively renamed ''Annales d'histoire sociale'' (1939–1942, 1945), ''Mélanges d'histoire sociale'' (1942–1944), ''Annales. Economies, sociétés, civilisations'' (1946–1994), and ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'' (1994– ).<ref name="journal names">P. Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution. The Annales School 1929–89'', p. 116 n. 2.</ref>

In 1962 Braudel and Gaston Berger used Ford Foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death. In 1970 the 6th Section and the ''Annales'' relocated to the FMSH building.  FMSH set up elaborate international networks to spread the ''Annales'' gospel across Europe and the world. In 2013 it began publication of an English language edition, with all the articles translated.

The scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental—there is a search for total history and new approaches. The emphasis is on social history, and very long-term trends, often using quantification and paying special attention to geography<ref>See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'évolution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).</ref> and to the intellectual world view of common people, or "mentality" (''mentalité''). Little attention is paid to political, diplomatic, or military history, or to biographies of famous men.  Instead the ''Annales'' focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.

==Origins==
The ''Annales'' was founded and edited by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]] in 1929, while they were teaching at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and later in Paris. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the ''[[Année Sociologique]]'' (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue durée]]'') over events and political transformations.<ref>Colin Jones, "Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue durée in French Revolutionary Historiography," ''Past & Present,'' 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178–203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]</ref>  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalités,'' or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the Annales was to undo the work of the Sorbonnistes, to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.<ref>J.H. Hexter, "Fernand Braudel and the Monde Braudellien," '' Historians,'' pp. 61</ref>

Co-founder [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944) was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite École Normale Supérieure, and in Germany, serving as a professor at the University of Strasbourg until he was called to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history.  Bloch's interests were  highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (1845–1918)<ref>Jason Hilkovitch & Max Fulkerson, "Paul Vidal de la Blache: A biographical sketch" at

}}</ref>  and the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917).  His own ideas, especially those expressed in his masterworks, ''French Rural History'' (''Les caractères originaux de l'histoire rurale française,'' 1931) and ''Feudal Society'', were incorporated by the second-generation Annalistes, led by [[Fernand Braudel]].

==Precepts==
[[Georges Duby]], a leader of the school, wrote that the history he taught:
:relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strove on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society and civilisation.<ref>Georges Duby, ''Le dimanche de Bouvines'' (1973), forward</ref>
The Annalistes, especially [[Lucien Febvre]], advocated a ''histoire totale'', or ''histoire tout court'', a complete study of a historic problem.

==Postwar==
Bloch was shot by the [[Gestapo]] during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]] in World War II for his active membership of the [[French Resistance]], and Febvre carried on the ''Annales'' approach in the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this time that he mentored Braudel, who would become one of the best-known exponents of this school. Braudel's work came to define a "second" era of ''Annales'' historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of [[Philip II of Spain]]. 
Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (the quasi motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue durée]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.

While authors such as [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Marc Ferro]] and [[Jacques Le Goff]] continue to carry the ''Annales'' banner, today the ''Annales'' approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in [[cultural history]], [[political history]] and [[economic history]].

==''Mentalités''==
Bloch's ''Les Rois Thaumaturges'' (1924)<ref>Translated as ''The Royal Touch: Monarchy and Miracles in France and England'' (1990)</ref> looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure [[scrofula]] by his [[royal touch|thaumaturgic touch]].  The kings of France and England indeed regularly practiced the ritual.  Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch—he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long durations ("longue durée") studies spanning several centuries, even up to a thousand years, downplaying short-term events.  Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities, or ''mentalités'', resonated with scholars who were reading [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]. In the 1960s, [[Robert Mandrou]] and [[Georges Duby]] harmonized the concept of ''mentalité'' history with [[Fernand Braudel]]'s structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions. A flood of ''mentalité'' studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, however, ''mentalité'' history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation, but still lacked a solid theoretical basis. While not explicitly rejecting ''mentalité'' history, younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches.

==Braudel==
Fernand Braudel became the leader of the second generation after 1945. He obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and founded the 6th Section of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences.  It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1975 under the name [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS).  Braudel's followers admired his use of the longue durée approach to stress slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue durée. Special attention was paid to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions. In turn the Marxists called them conservatives.<ref>Olivia Harris, "Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity." ''History Workshop Journal'' (2004) (57): 161–174. {{ISSN|1363-3554}} Fulltext: [[OUP]]. Only Ariès was a true conservative—indeed a royalist.</ref>

Braudel's first book, ''La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'Epoque de Philippe II'' (1949) (''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'') was his most influential.  This vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences, employed effectively the technique of the longue durée, and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals.  It stressed geography but not ''mentalité''. It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School.

==Regionalism==
Before ''Annales,'' French history supposedly happened in Paris. Febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in 1912, with his sweeping doctoral thesis on ''[[Philip II of Spain|Philippe II]] et la [[Franche-Comté]].'' The geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the king's policies.

The ''Annales'' historians did not try to replicate Braudel's vast geographical scope in ''La Méditerranée.'' Instead they focused on regions in France over long stretches of time. The most important was the study of the ''Peasants of Languedoc'' by Braudel's star pupil and successor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie.<ref>Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, ''The Peasants of Languedoc,'' (1966, translated 1977) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0252006356 excerpt and text search]</ref>  The regionalist tradition flourished especially in the 1960s and 1970s in the work of Pierre Goubert in 1960 on Beauvais and René Baehrel on Basse-Provence. ''Annales'' historians in the 1970s and 1980s turned to urban regions, including Pierre Deyon (Amiens), Maurice Garden (Lyon), Jean-Pierre Bardet (Rouen), Georges Freche (Toulouse), [[Gregory Hanlon]] (Agen<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lcdpu.fr/livre/?GCOI=27000100251460|title=L'univers des gens de bien, Culture et comportements des élites urbaines en Agenais-Condomois au 17e siècle|website=www.lcdpu.fr|language=FR|access-date=2019-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130162037/http://www.lcdpu.fr/livre/?GCOI=27000100251460|archive-date=2019-01-30|url-status=live}}</ref> and Layrac<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdBz0I9Irl8C|title=Confession and Community in Seventeenth-century France: Catholic and Protestant Coexistence in Aquitaine|last=Hanlon|first=Gregory|last2=Hanlon|first2=University Research Professor Gregory|date=1993|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812232059|language=en|access-date=2019-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130110403/https://books.google.ca/books/about/Confession_and_Community_in_Seventeenth.html?id=WdBz0I9Irl8C&redir_esc=y|archive-date=2019-01-30|url-status=live}}</ref>), and Jean-Claude Perrot (Caen). By the 1970s the shift was underway from the earlier economic history to cultural history and the history of mentalities.<ref>Ernst Hinrichs, "Provinzen, Landschaften, Regionen in Der Modernen Französischen Geschichtswissenschaft – Ein Essay," ''Blätter Für Deutsche Landesgeschichte'' 1994 130: 1–12. {{ISSN|0006-4408}} Fulltext: [http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/bdlg/Blatt_bsb00000334,00007.html online edition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722091520/http://periodika.digitale-sammlungen.de/bdlg/Blatt_bsb00000334,00007.html |date=2011-07-22 }}</ref>

==Impact outside France==
The ''Annales'' school systematically reached out to create an impact on other countries.  Its success varied widely.<ref>Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990) ch 5.</ref> The ''Annales'' approach was especially well received in [[Italy]] and [[Poland]]. [[Franciszek Bujak]] (1875–1953) and [[Jan Rutkowski]] (1886–1949), the founders of modern economic history in Poland and of the journal ''Roczniki Dziejów Spolecznych i Gospodarczych'' (1931– ), were attracted to the innovations of the Annales school. Rutkowski was in contact with Bloch and others, and published in the ''Annales.'' After the Communists took control in the 1940s Polish scholars were safer working on the Middle Ages and the early modern era rather than contemporary history. After the "[[Polish October]]" of 1956 the Sixth Section in Paris welcomed Polish historians and exchanges between the circle of the ''Annales'' and Polish scholars continued until the early 1980s. The reciprocal influence between the French school and Polish historiography was particularly evident in studies on the Middle Ages and the early modern era studied by Braudel.<ref>Anita Krystyna Shelton, ''The Democratic Idea in Polish History and Historiography'' (1989). Even the Marxist journal ''Kwartalnik Historii Kultury Materialnej,'' founded in 1953, had an ''Annales'' flavor.</ref>

In South America the ''Annales'' approach became popular. From the 1950s [[Federico Brito Figueroa]] was the founder of a new Venezuelan historiography based largely on the ideas of the Annales School. Brito Figueroa carried his conception of the field to all levels of university study, emphasizing a systematic and scientific approach to history and placing it squarely in the social sciences.  Spanish historiography was influenced by the "Annales School" starting in 1950 with Jaime Vincens Vives (1910–1960).<ref>Nil Santiáñez-Tió, "Temporalidad y discurso histórico: Propuesta de una renovación metodológica de la historia de la literatura española moderna." [Temporality and Historical Discourse: Proposal of a Methodological Renewal of the History of Modern Spanish Literature]. ''Hispanic Review'' 1997 65(3): 267–290. {{ISSN|0018-2176}} Fulltext: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/474948  in Jstor]</ref>   In Mexico, exiled Republican intellectuals extended the Annales approach, particularly from the Center for Historical Studies of El Colegio de México, the leading graduate studies institution of Latin America.

British historians, apart from a few Marxists, were generally hostile. Academic historians decidedly sided with [[Geoffrey Elton]]'s ''[[The Practice of History]]'' against [[Edward Hallett Carr]]'s ''[[What Is History?]]'' One of the few British historians who were sympathetic towards the work of the ''Annales'' school was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]. American, German, Indian, Russian and Japanese scholars generally ignored the school{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}. The Americans developed their own form of "new social history" from entirely different roots. Both the American and the ''Annales'' historians picked up important family reconstitution techniques from French demographer [[Louis Henry]].<ref>Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990), pp 56, 96–100.</ref>

The [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen]] school centered on [[Bernard Slicher van Bath]] was viewed internationally as a Dutch counterpart of the Annales school, although Slicher van Bath himself vehemently rejected the idea of a quantitative "school" of historiography.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |first=Jan |last=Kuys |title=Bernard Hendrik Slicher van Bath |encyclopedia=Biografisch Woordenboek Gelderland |publisher=Verloren |year=2006 |url=http://www.biografischwoordenboekgelderland.nl/bio/6_Bernard_Hendrik_Slicher_van_Bath |access-date=2015-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020164930/http://www.biografischwoordenboekgelderland.nl/bio/6_Bernard_Hendrik_Slicher_van_Bath |archive-date=2016-10-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Current==
The current leader is [[Roger Chartier]], who is Directeur d'Études at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] in Paris, Professeur in the [[Collège de France]], and Annenberg Visiting Professor of History at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He frequently lectures and teaches in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. His work in Early Modern European History focuses on the history of education, the history of the book and the history of reading.  Recently, he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature (particularly theatrical plays) for France, England and Spain. His work in this specific field (based on the criss-crossing between literary criticism, bibliography, and sociocultural history) is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology.

Chartier's typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making, remaking, dissemination, and reading of texts in early modern Europe and America. Under the heading of "practices," his class considers how readers read and marked up their books, forms of note-taking, and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts. Under the heading of "materials," his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces (including stone, wax, parchment, paper, walls, textiles, the body, and the heart), writing implements (including styluses, pens, pencils, needles, and brushes), and material forms (including scrolls, erasable tables, codices, broadsides and printed forms and books). Under the heading of "places," his class explores where texts were made, read, and listened to, including monasteries, schools and universities, offices of the state, the shops of merchants and booksellers, printing houses, theaters, libraries, studies, and closets. The texts for his course include the ''Bible'', translations of Ovid, ''Hamlet'', ''Don Quixote'', Montaigne's essays, Pepys's diary, Richardson's ''Pamela'', and Franklin's autobiography.

The '''''Annales'' school''' ({{IPA-fr|a'nal}}) is a group of historians associated with a style of [[historiography]] developed by French [[historians]] in the 20th century to stress long-term [[social history]]. It is named after its scholarly journal ''[[Annales d'histoire économique et sociale]]'', which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs.<ref>See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928120516/http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ |date=2008-09-28 }}</ref> The school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in France and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of [[social science|social scientific]] methods by historians, emphasizing social and economic rather than political or diplomatic themes.

The school deals primarily with [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] and [[Early modern period|early modern]] Europe (before the [[French Revolution]]), with little interest in later topics. It has dominated French social history and influenced historiography in Europe and Latin America. Prominent leaders include co-founders [[Lucien Febvre]] (1878–1956), [[Henri Hauser]] (1866-1946) and [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944).  The second generation was led by [[Fernand Braudel]] (1902–1985) and included [[Georges Duby]] (1919–1996), [[Pierre Goubert]] (1915–2012), [[Robert Mandrou]] (1921–1984), [[Pierre Chaunu]] (1923–2009), [[Jacques Le Goff]] (1924–2014), and [[Ernest Labrousse]] (1895–1988). Institutionally it is based on the ''Annales'' journal, the SEVPEN publishing house, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), and especially the 6th Section of the [[École pratique des hautes études]], all based in Paris.  A third generation was led by [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] (born 1929) and includes Jacques Revel,<ref>Since 1978, Revel has taught at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (Paris), where he is ''directeur d'études'' (full professor); he served as president of the École from 1995 to 2004.</ref> and [[Philippe Ariès]] (1914–1984), who joined the group in 1978.  The third generation stressed [[History of mentalities|history from the point of view of mentalities]], or ''mentalités''.  The fourth generation of ''Annales'' historians, led by [[Roger Chartier]] (born 1945), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the [[Cultural turn|cultural]] and [[linguistic turn]], which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices.
  
The main scholarly outlet has been the journal ''Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale'' ("Annals of Economic and Social History"), founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. Its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices. Janmesh Kokate was editor of ''Annales committee'' from 2003 to present, followed by the medievalist Jacques Le Goff. However,  informal successor as head of the school was Le Roy Ladurie. Multiple responses were attempted by the school. Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.<ref>One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire & mesure'' (1986– ), devoted to quantitative history.</ref> However, the ''Annales'' ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political, and demographic research.<ref>Georg G. Iggers, ''Historiography in the Twentieth Century: From Scientific Objectivity to the Postmodern Challenge," 59–61.</ref>  An attempt to require an ''Annales''-written textbook for French schools was rejected by the government.<ref>Hunt (1986)</ref> By 1980 [[postmodern]] sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives. As [[Jacques Revel]] notes, the success of the ''Annales'' school, especially its use of social structures as explanatory forces, contained the seeds of its own downfall, for there is "no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social, identified with the real."<ref>Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt, "Microanalysis and the Construction of the Social," in ''Histories: French Constructions of the Past,'' ed. by Jacques Revel and Lynn Hunt (1995) 480.</ref>  The ''Annales'' school kept its infrastructure, but lost its ''mentalités''.<ref>On the decline of ''Annales'', see Hunt (1986); for a summary of the movement, see Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'', 106–107.</ref>

==The journal==
{{main article|Annales d'histoire économique et sociale}}
The journal began in Strasbourg as ''Annales d'histoire économique et sociale''; it moved to Paris and kept the same name from 1929 to 1939. It was successively renamed ''Annales d'histoire sociale'' (1939–1942, 1945), ''Mélanges d'histoire sociale'' (1942–1944), ''Annales. Economies, sociétés, civilisations'' (1946–1994), and ''Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales'' (1994– ).<ref name="journal names">P. Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution. The Annales School 1929–89'', p. 116 n. 2.</ref>

In 1962 Braudel and Gaston Berger used Ford Foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the {{Lang|fr|Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme}} (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death. In 1970 the 6th Section and the ''Annales'' relocated to the FMSH building.  FMSH set up elaborate international networks to spread the ''Annales'' gospel across Europe and the world. In 2013 it began publication of an English language edition, with all the articles translated.

The scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental—there is a search for total history and new approaches. The emphasis is on social history, and very long-term trends, often using quantification and paying special attention to geography<ref>See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'évolution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).</ref> and to the intellectual world view of common people, or "mentality" (''mentalité''). Little attention is paid to political, diplomatic, or military history, or to biographies of famous men.  Instead the ''Annales'' focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.

==Origins==
The ''Annales'' was founded and edited by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]] in 1929, while they were teaching at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and later in Paris. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the ''[[Année Sociologique]]'' (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue durée]]'') over events and political transformations.<ref>Colin Jones, "Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue durée in French Revolutionary Historiography," ''Past & Present,'' 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178–203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]</ref>  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalités,'' or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the Annales was to undo the work of the Sorbonnistes, to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.<ref>J.H. Hexter, "Fernand Braudel and the Monde Braudellien," '' Historians,'' pp. 61</ref>

Co-founder [[Marc Bloch]] (1886–1944) was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite École Normale Supérieure, and in Germany, serving as a professor at the University of Strasbourg until he was called to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history.  Bloch's interests were  highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (1845–1918)<ref>Jason Hilkovitch & Max Fulkerson, "Paul Vidal de la Blache: A biographical sketch" at

}}</ref>  and the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917).  His own ideas, especially those expressed in his masterworks, ''French Rural History'' (''Les caractères originaux de l'histoire rurale française,'' 1931) and ''Feudal Society'', were incorporated by the second-generation Annalistes, led by [[Fernand Braudel]].

==Precepts==
[[Georges Duby]], a leader of the school, wrote that the history he taught:
:relegated the sensational to the sidelines and was reluctant to give a simple accounting of events, but strove on the contrary to pose and solve problems and, neglecting surface disturbances, to observe the long and medium-term evolution of economy, society and civilisation.<ref>Georges Duby, ''Le dimanche de Bouvines'' (1973), forward</ref>
The Annalistes, especially [[Lucien Febvre]], advocated a ''histoire totale'', or ''histoire tout court'', a complete study of a historic problem.

==Postwar==
Bloch was shot by the [[Gestapo]] during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]] in World War II for his active membership of the [[French Resistance]], and Febvre carried on the ''Annales'' approach in the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this time that he mentored Braudel, who would become one of the best-known exponents of this school. Braudel's work came to define a "second" era of ''Annales'' historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of [[Philip II of Spain]]. 
Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (the quasi motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue durée]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.

While authors such as [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]], [[Marc Ferro]] and [[Jacques Le Goff]] continue to carry the ''Annales'' banner, today the ''Annales'' approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in [[cultural history]], [[political history]] and [[economic history]].

==''Mentalités''==
Bloch's ''Les Rois Thaumaturges'' (1924)<ref>Translated as ''The Royal Touch: Monarchy and Miracles in France and England'' (1990)</ref> looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure [[scrofula]] by his [[royal touch|thaumaturgic touch]].  The kings of France and England indeed regularly practiced the ritual.  Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch—he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long durations ("longue durée") studies spanning several centuries, even up to a thousand years, downplaying short-term events.  Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities, or ''mentalités'', resonated with scholars who were reading [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]. In the 1960s, [[Robert Mandrou]] and [[Georges Duby]] harmonized the concept of ''mentalité'' history with [[Fernand Braudel]]'s structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions. A flood of ''mentalité'' studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, however, ''mentalité'' history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation, but still lacked a solid theoretical basis. While not explicitly rejecting ''mentalité'' history, younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches.

==Braudel==
Fernand Braudel became the leader of the second generation after 1945. He obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and founded the 6th Section of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences.  It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1975 under the name [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS).  Braudel's followers admired his use of the longue durée approach to stress slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue durée. Special attention was paid to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions. In turn the Marxists called them conservatives.<ref>Olivia Harris, "Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity." ''History Workshop Journal'' (2004) (57): 161–174. {{ISSN|1363-3554}} Fulltext: [[OUP]]. Only Ariès was a true conservative—indeed a royalist.</ref>

Braudel's first book, ''La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'Epoque de Philippe II'' (1949) (''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'') was his most influential.  This vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences, employed effectively the technique of the longue durée, and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals.  It stressed geography but not ''mentalité''. It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School.

==Regionalism==
Before ''Annales,'' French history supposedly happened in Paris. Febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in 1912, with his sweeping doctoral thesis on ''[[Philip II of Spain|Philippe II]] et la [[Franche-Comté]].'' The geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the king's policies.

The ''Annales'' historians did not try to replicate Braudel's vast geographical scope in ''La Méditerranée.'' Instead they focused on regions in France over long stretches of time. The most important was the study of the ''Peasants of Languedoc'' by Braudel's star pupil and successor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie.<ref>Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, ''The Peasants of Languedoc,'' (1966, translated 1977) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0252006356 excerpt and text search]</ref>  The regionalist tradition flourished especially in the 1960s and 1970s in the work of Pierre Goubert in 1960 on Beauvais and René Baehrel on Basse-Provence. ''Annales'' historians in the 1970s and 1980s turned to urban regions, including Pierre Deyon (Amiens), Maurice Garden (Lyon), Jean-Pierre Bardet (Rouen), Georges Freche (Toulouse), [[Gregory Hanlon]] (Agen<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lcdpu.fr/livre/?GCOI=27000100251460|title=L'univers des gens de bien, Culture et comportements des élites urbaines en Agenais-Condomois au 17e siècle|website=www.lcdpu.fr|language=FR|access-date=2019-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130162037/http://www.lcdpu.fr/livre/?GCOI=27000100251460|archive-date=2019-01-30|url-status=live}}</ref> and Layrac<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdBz0I9Irl8C|title=Confession and Community in Seventeenth-century France: Catholic and Protestant Coexistence in Aquitaine|last=Hanlon|first=Gregory|last2=Hanlon|first2=University Research Professor Gregory|date=1993|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812232059|language=en|access-date=2019-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190130110403/https://books.google.ca/books/about/Confession_and_Community_in_Seventeenth.html?id=WdBz0I9Irl8C&redir_esc=y|archive-date=2019-01-30|url-status=live}}</ref>), and Jean-Claude Perrot (Caen).

==Impact outside France==
The ''Annales'' school systematically reached out to create an impact on other countries.  Its success varied widely.<ref>Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990) ch 5.</ref> The ''Annales'' approach was especially well received in [[Italy]] and [[Poland]]. [[Franciszek Bujak]] (1875–1953) and [[Jan Rutkowski]] (1886–1949), the founders of modern economic history in Poland and of the journal ''Roczniki Dziejów Spolecznych i Gospodarczych'' (1931– ), were attracted to the innovations of the Annales school. Rutkowski was in contact with Bloch and others, and published in the ''Annales.'' After the Communists took control in the 1940s Polish scholars were safer working on the Middle Ages and the early modern era rather than contemporary history. After the "[[Polish October]]" of 1956 the Sixth Section in Paris welcomed Polish historians and exchanges between the circle of the ''Annales'' and Polish scholars continued until the early 1980s. The reciprocal influence between the French school and Polish historiography was particularly evident in studies on the Middle Ages and the early modern era studied by Braudel.<ref>Anita Krystyna Shelton, ''The Democratic Idea in Polish History and Historiography'' (1989). Even the Marxist journal ''Kwartalnik Historii Kultury Materialnej,'' founded in 1953, had an ''Annales'' flavor.</ref>

In South America the ''Annales'' approach became popular. From the 1950s [[Federico Brito Figueroa]] was the founder of a new Venezuelan historiography based largely on the ideas of the Annales School. Brito Figueroa carried his conception of the field to all levels of university study, emphasizing a systematic and scientific approach to history and placing it squarely in the social sciences.  Spanish historiography was influenced by the "Annales School" starting in 1950 with Jaime Vincens Vives (1910–1960).<ref>Nil Santiáñez-Tió, "Temporalidad y discurso histórico: Propuesta de una renovación metodológica de la historia de la literatura española moderna." [Temporality and Historical Discourse: Proposal of a Methodological Renewal of the History of Modern Spanish Literature]. ''Hispanic Review'' 1997 65(3): 267–290. {{ISSN|0018-2176}} Fulltext: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/474948  in Jstor]</ref>   In Mexico, exiled Republican intellectuals extended the Annales approach, particularly from the Center for Historical Studies of El Colegio de México, the leading graduate studies institution of Latin America.

British historians, apart from a few Marxists, were generally hostile. Academic historians decidedly sided with [[Geoffrey Elton]]'s ''[[The Practice of History]]'' against [[Edward Hallett Carr]]'s ''[[What Is History?]]'' One of the few British historians who were sympathetic towards the work of the ''Annales'' school was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]. American, German, Indian, Russian and Japanese scholars generally ignored the school{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}. The Americans developed their own form of "new social history" from entirely different roots. Both the American and the ''Annales'' historians picked up important family reconstitution techniques from French demographer [[Louis Henry]].<ref>Burke, ''French Historical Revolution'' (1990), pp 56, 96–100.</ref>

The [[Wageningen University and Research Centre|Wageningen]] school centered on [[Bernard Slicher van Bath]] was viewed internationally as a Dutch counterpart of the Annales school, although Slicher van Bath himself vehemently rejected the idea of a quantitative "school" of historiography.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |first=Jan |last=Kuys |title=Bernard Hendrik Slicher van Bath |encyclopedia=Biografisch Woordenboek Gelderland |publisher=Verloren |year=2006 |url=http://www.biografischwoordenboekgelderland.nl/bio/6_Bernard_Hendrik_Slicher_van_Bath |access-date=2015-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020164930/http://www.biografischwoordenboekgelderland.nl/bio/6_Bernard_Hendrik_Slicher_van_Bath |archive-date=2016-10-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Current==
The current leader is [[Roger Chartier]], who is Directeur d'Études at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] in Paris, Professeur in the [[Collège de France]], and Annenberg Visiting Professor of History at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He frequently lectures and teaches in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. His work in Early Modern European History focuses on the history of education, the history of the book and the history of reading.  Recently, he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature (particularly theatrical plays) for France, England and Spain. His work in this specific field (based on the criss-crossing between literary criticism, bibliography, and sociocultural history) is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology.

Chartier's typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making, remaking, dissemination, and reading of texts in early modern Europe and America. Under the heading of "practices," his class considers how readers read and marked up their books, forms of note-taking, and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts. Under the heading of "materials," his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces (including stone, wax, parchment, paper, walls, textiles, the body, and the heart), writing implements (including styluses, pens, pencils, needles, and brushes), and material forms (including scrolls, erasable tables, codices, broadsides and printed forms and books). Under the heading of "places," his class explores where texts were made, read, and listened to, including monasteries, schools and universities, offices of the state, the shops of merchants and booksellers, printing houses, theaters, libraries, studies, and closets. The texts for his course include the ''Bible'', translations of Ovid, ''Hamlet'', ''Don Quixote'', Montaigne's essays, Pepys's diary, Richardson's ''Pamela'', and Franklin's autobiography.
