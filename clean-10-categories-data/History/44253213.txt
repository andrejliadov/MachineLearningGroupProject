The '''''Conservation Plan''''' is an important publication written by [[James Semple Kerr]] in 1982, and revised many times. It was a landmark in Australian conservation. The document "...outlines the logical processes of the Burra Charter, and how to prepare a Conservation Plan to guide and manage change to a heritage item appropriately''. Subtitled, "a guide to the preparation of conservation plans for places of European cultural significance'' it has guided building conservation in Australia and around the world.<ref>[http://australia.icomos.org/publications/the-conservation-plan/ Australia ICOMOS > Publications > The Conservation Plan]</ref>

The Conservation Plan is widely used by heritage practitioners and property owners in Australia, and worldwide as a primary guide to the process of researching, documenting and managing historic places in accordance with the [[Burra Charter]], through a logical process. First published by the [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW) in 1982, it has subsequently been reprinted in expanded form over seven editions and twelve printing impressions.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Kerr, James Semple | author2=Hanna, Bronwyn J.
