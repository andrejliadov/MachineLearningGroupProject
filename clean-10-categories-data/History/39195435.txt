The '''Association of Personal Historians''' ('''APH''') was an international [[non-profit]] [[trade association]] dedicated to developing, supporting and marketing the work of self-employed writers and small businesses who are engaged in  preparing print, video, and audio memoirs recording the lives of individuals, families, and communities. Formed in the United States in 1995, it had a global membership of over 650 at its peak,<ref name=themonthly/><ref name=aph_about>{{cite web| url=http://www.personalhistorians.org/about/about_aph_the_life_story_people.php  |website=Association of Personal Historians|title= About APH — The Life Story People'| accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref>  before dissolving in May 2017, due to "financial constraints and membership trends".<ref>[https://truestorieswelltold.com/2017/05/17/when-aph-died-doves-cried/  Sarah White, "When APH Died, Doves Cried", May 17, 2017].

The APH's mission statement was to "support... its members in recording, preserving and sharing life stories of people, families, communities and organizations around the world."<ref name=aph_goals>{{cite web| url= http://www.personalhistorians.org/about/vision_mission_goals.php |website=APH|title= Vision, Mission & Goals|accessdate= April 23, 2013}}</ref>  According to the organization, its members "help other people create personal histories, including memoirs, video tributes, autobiographies, biographies, family histories, heritage cookbooks, community histories, corporate and organizational histories, legacy letters, and ethical wills."<ref name=aph_about/>

Personal historians have been described as comprising "journalists, psychotherapists, social workers, nurses, videographers, gerontologists, and people from other helping or writing professions",<ref name=kunzsoltys>{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2gRGXy5VhRMC&pg=PT194&dq=%22personal+historians%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ebV1Udq3A-q90QWbr4DoDw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA  |author1=Kunz, John A. |author2=Soltys, Florence Gray |title=Transformational Reminiscence: Life Story Work|publisher= Springer Publishing Company|date= 2007}}</ref> as "retired teachers, journalists, genealogists, and therapists..."<ref name=phoenix/> and as "social workers, journalists and others involved in communications... retirees who want to embark on a second career."<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/jobs/12starts.html |author=Olsen, Patricia R. |title=Tales From the Past, Preserved for Families|work= New York Times| date= October 11, 2008|accessdate= April 23, 2013}}</ref>  In each case they form "&nbsp;[g]enerally a one-person conglomerate of ghostwriter, editor, and publishing house...".<ref name=phoenix/>

All APH members are expected to abide by the organization's [[code of ethics]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.personalhistorians.org/about/code_ethics.php |website= APH|title=Code of ethics| accessdate= April 23, 2013}}</ref>  Practitioners often have training in skills such as [[interviewing]] techniques, [[desktop publishing]], video and/or audio production, as well as some knowledge of [[geriatrics]] or other disciplines.<ref name=nyt/>

==Governance and dissolution==
The APH was governed by an elected, all-volunteer board of directors with overlapping two-year terms. The organization held an annual conference for its members. 

The 2017 Board of Directors cited decreasing membership and a growing trend towards online networking and collaboration as reasons for dissolution. In a letter to members, the 2017 Board wrote, 
<blockquote>"...APH has achieved its purpose many times over, which, as stated in our Bylaws, was to 'advance the profession of helping individuals, organizations, and communities preserve their histories, memories, and life stories.' APH has helped launch more than a thousand personal history businesses, and its members have produced many thousands of personal history works that will be part of our world’s historical record. APH leaves the field at a time when a broader recognition of the importance of saving life stories has emerged and is flourishing—and is widely known and communicated through the work of many other organizations and media outlets. APH has had a significant role in advancing that conversation. And it was our members, as individual practitioners of personal history, who achieved this in countless ways in countless communities, and we know you will continue to do so."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.personalhistorians.org|title=Letter to Membership: Dissolution of APH, Inc.|last=APH Board of Directors|first=2017|date=May 9, 2017|work=Constant Contact alluded to under Announcements on this page.|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2017}}</blockquote>

==Resources==
Former members of APH and current personal historians are encouraged to use the phrase "personal history" and "personal historian" in search engines in order to find relevant social media groups. Trade associations exist for genealogists, photo archivists, ghostwriters, editors, and biographers, among others.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
