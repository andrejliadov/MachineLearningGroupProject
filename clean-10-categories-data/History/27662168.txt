The '''Areni-1 shoe''' is a 5,500-year-old [[leather]] shoe that was found in 2008 in excellent condition in the [[Areni-1 cave]] located in the [[Vayots Dzor Province|Vayots Dzor]] province of [[Armenia]].<ref name="National Geographic">{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/06/09/worlds-oldest-leather-shoe-found-in-armenia-2/ |title=World's Oldest Leather Shoe Found—Stunningly Preserved |last=Dindar |first=Shereen |work=National Post |location=Canada  |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 11, 2010}}</ref> It is a one-piece leather-hide shoe, the oldest piece of leather footwear in the world known to contemporary researchers.<!-- the range of accuracy in dating methods may have quite a large variable, depending upon what is stated for this dating, it could make little difference that a few hundred years difference is claimed and make the find merely contemporary with that found in Germany --> The discovery was made by an international team led by  [[Boris Gasparyan]], an archaeologist from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Armenia]] (co-directors of the project are [[Ron Pinhasi]] from [[University College Cork]] in [[Ireland]], and [[Gregory Areshian]] from [[UCLA]]).<ref>{{cite news |title=Ancient shoe steps out of cave and into limelight |author=Bruce Bower |newspaper=Science News |date=July 3, 2010 |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/60099/title/Ancient_shoe_steps_out_of_cave_and_into_limelight |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}</ref>

==Discovery==
An Armenian post-graduate student, [[Diana Zardaryan]], discovered the leather shoe in the course of excavations by a team of archeologists from Armenia’s [[Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography]], Ireland and the United States.<ref name="ArmLib-June12-2010">[http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2069047.html ''Oldest Leather Shoe A ‘Dream’ Find For Armenian Scientist''], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), June 12, 2010.</ref> The shoe was found upside down at the base of a shallow, rounded, and plastered pit that was {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} deep and {{convert|44|–|48|cm|abbr=on}} wide, beneath an overturned broken [[Chalcolithic]] ceramic bowl.<ref name="First Direct Evidence of Chalcolithic Footwear from the Near Eastern Highlands">{{cite news |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010984 |title=First Direct Evidence of Chalcolithic Footwear from the Near Eastern Highlands |work=PLOS One |first1=Ron |last1=Pinhasi |first2=Boris |last2=Gasparian |first3=Gregory |last3=Areshian |first4=Diana |last4=Zardaryan |first5=Alexia |last5=Smith |first6=Guy |last6=Bar-Oz |first7=Thomas |last7=Higham |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}</ref> A broken pot and goat horns also were found nearby.

The research was funded by the [[National Geographic Society]], the [[Chitjian Foundation]], the [[Gfoeller Foundation]], the [[Steinmetz Family Foundation]], the [[Boochever Foundation]] and the [[Cotsen Institute of Archaeology]] at [[UCLA]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/10/oldest-leather-shoe-steps_n_607264.html |title=Oldest Leather Shoe Steps Out After 5,500 Years |work=Huffington Post}}</ref> The team's findings were published on June 9, 2010, in the journal ''[[PLOS One]]''.

==Analysis==
The shoe was found in near-perfect condition due to the cool and dry conditions in the cave and a thick layer of sheep dung which acted as a solid seal. Large storage containers were found in the same cave, many of which held well-preserved wheat, barley, and [[apricot]]s, as well as other edible plants.<ref name="Fox"/> The shoe contained grass and the archaeologists were uncertain as to whether this was because the grass was used as insulation to keep the foot warm, or used to preserve the shape of the shoe while not being worn. Lead archaeologist Ron Pinhasi could not determine whether the shoe belonged to a man or a woman. While small, approximately a woman's U.S. and Canada size 7, European size 37, or UK size 6, he stated that "the shoe could well have fitted a man from that era".<ref name="Fox"/> The [[shoe laces]] were preserved as well.<ref name="Fox"/>

Major similarities exist between the manufacturing technique and style of one-piece leather-hide shoes discovered across Europe and the one reported from Areni-1 Cave, suggesting that shoes of this type were worn for millennia across a large and environmentally diverse geographic region.<ref name="First Direct Evidence of Chalcolithic Footwear from the Near Eastern Highlands"/> According to Pinhasi, the Areni-1 shoe is similar to the Irish ''[[pampootie]]'', a shoe style worn in the [[Aran Islands]] up to the 1950s.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i8KRXbqACR1CdoIW6YN9-GE4GjxQ | title = 5,500-year leather mocassin world's oldest shoe |agency=AFP | date = June 10, 2010 | accessdate = June 12, 2010}}</ref> The shoes are very similar to the traditional shoes of the Balkans, still seen today in festivals, known as [[Opanci]] (''Opanke'').<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/06/100609-worlds-oldest-leather-shoe-armenia-science/ National Geographic: ''World's Oldest Leather Shoe Found—Stunningly Preserved'']</ref>

When the material was dated by the two radiocarbon laboratories in [[Oxford]] and California, it was established that the shoe dates back to 3,500&nbsp;B.C.<!-- the variable should be given as =/- xxx years -->  This date is a few hundred years older than the date given for the leather shoe found on [[Ötzi the Iceman]], 400 years older than those found at [[Stonehenge]], and 1,000 years older than those found at the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].<ref name="Fox">{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/06/09/oldest-leather-shoe-archaeology/ |title=What's Older Than the Pyramids and Smells Worse Than a Mummy? |publisher=Fox News |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613034904/http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2010/06/09/oldest-leather-shoe-archaeology/ |archive-date=June 13, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
