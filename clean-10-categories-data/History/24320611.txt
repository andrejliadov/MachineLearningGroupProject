The '''Tweed Run''' is a group [[bicycle]] [[living history]] ride through the centre of [[London]], in which the cyclists are expected to dress in [[retro style]] traditional British cycling attire, particularly [[Tweed (cloth)|tweed]] [[plus four]] suits. Any bicycle is acceptable on the Tweed Run, but classic vintage bicycles are encouraged. Some effort to recreate the spirit of a bygone era is always appreciated.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.cyclelicio.us/2009/01/tweed-run.html|title=A critical mass of well dressed cyclists|author=Cyclelicious|date=27 January 2009|publisher=www.cyclelicio.us|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122044328/http://www.cyclelicio.us/2009/01/tweed-run.html|archive-date=22 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The ride dubs itself "A Metropolitan Cycle Ride With a Bit of Style."

==Inspirations==

Among the inspirations for the Tweed Run was Jack Thurston's now disbanded Tweed Cycling Club, and several vintage attire-themed rides which were held in the north of England in the 1990s.

==First Tweed Run==
Although previous cycling clubs have hosted vintage-themed rides before, the very first Tweed Run  was held on 24 January 2009,<ref>{{citation |url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG8909321/On-your-bike-for-Rubgy-Ralph-Laurens-first-London-Tweed-Run.html |title= On your bike for Rugby Ralph Lauren's first London Tweed Run |date=23 November 2011 |journal=[[The Daily Telegraph]] }}</ref> and organised via London Fixed Gear and Single Speed, an online cycling forum.  The second run was held on 10 April 2010, for 500 registered riders.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/apr/13/doctor-who-tweed-run-cyclists | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Doctor Who does nothing for tweed that cyclists haven't planned for months | first=Matthew | last=Sparkes | date=13 April 2010}}</ref>

Since then the Tweed Run has become an annual event with major sponsors. Participants were limited to 500 (due to health and safety rules) but by 2018 the numbers had increased to 1000 and due to high and popular demand a ticket ballot system had been in place but are now sold on a first come first served basis often selling out very quickly.

==Later tweed rides==
Following the Tweed Run, various places have copied the format, including [[Stanford Le Hope]],  [[Birmingham]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Manchester]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tweedride.co.uk/ |title=www.tweedride.co.uk |accessdate=2015-06-18}}</ref> [[United Kingdom]];<ref>[http://www.thebirminghampress.com/2013/06/11/are-you-all-dutch-brums-big-vintage-cycle-ride-pedals-confusion/ "Are you all Dutch?" – Brum’s Big Vintage Cycle ride pedals confusion.] The Birmingham Press.com, 11 June 2013.</ref> [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]; [[Alpena, Michigan]]; [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]; [[Athens, Georgia]]; [[Bloomington, Indiana]];  [[Boston]]; [[Chicago]]; [[Chico, California]]; [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]];  [[Curitiba]]; [[Des Moines]], [[Iowa]]; [[Quad Cities]] ;[[Durango, Colorado]]; [[Flagstaff, Arizona]]; [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]] and [[St Petersburg, Florida]], [[Fremantle]], [[Western Australia]]; [[Helsinki]]; [[Lexington, Kentucky]]; [[Louisville, Kentucky]]; [[Minneapolis]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Moscow]]; [[Paris]]; [[Pescara]], [[Italy]]; [[Philadelphia]]; [[Portsmouth, N.H.]]; [[Riga]], [[Latvia]]; [[Rochester, New York]]; [[Sacramento, California]]; [[San Francisco]]; [[São Paulo]]; [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]]; [[Sydney]]; [[Tokyo]]; [[Toronto]]; [[Traverse City, Michigan]]; [[Washington, D.C.]]; [[Oakland, CA]];<ref>[https://www.ebbc.org/tweed "East Bay Tweed Ride"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002173853/https://www.ebbc.org/tweed |date=2 October 2013 }} https://www.ebbc.org {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209103328/https://www.ebbc.org/ |date=9 February 2014 }}, 8 August 2013.</ref> [[Oldenburg (city)|Oldenburg]], Osnabrück 2015 [[Berlin]] and [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]; [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]]; [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]; [[Victoria, British Columbia]]; [[Windsor, Ontario]]; [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}; [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]; [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]]; [[Stockholm]] and [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]]; [[Spetses]], [[Greece]]; [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://24tv.ua/u_harkovi_vidbuvsya_retrozayizd_na_velosipedah_n738025|title=У Харкові відбувся ретро-заїзд на велосипедах - Телеканал новин 24|last=24tv.ua|first=|date=|website=Телеканал новин 24|publisher=|language=Ukrainian|access-date=2016-10-16}}</ref>  Many of these rides take place annually.
