'''History according to the Catholic Church''' is the theological interpretation of humanity's and Israel's past as recorded in the [[Bible]], the present times, and the future of the world by the [[Catholic Church]]. It is not the same as a [[timeline of the Catholic Church]] or an [[ecclesiastical history of the Catholic Church]], but the church's perspective on history - in other words, a combination of Catholic [[origin myth]] and [[eschatology]]. The church believes its foundation by Jesus marks the [[end-times]], because Judaism believes that the messiah will come in the end-times. While the church accepts much of the Jewish interpretation of the [[Old Testament]] - the [[existence of God]], [[divine inspiration]], the exodus to the promised land, [[Babylonian captivity]], etc. - the church does not agree with everything Judaism believes. The church interprets many scriptural events literally (whereas Judaism interprets them symbolically), applies the [[messianic prophecies]] to Jesus (whereas Judaism discounts certain scriptural verses as messianic prophecies and rejects Jesus' claims to messiahship and divinity), and applies Jewish self-identity to the church. For example, where Judaism believes that the world was created for the sake of Israel, the church teaches that the world was created for the sake of the New Israel (the church itself); and where Judaism is centered on God and his [[Torah]], the church is [[Christocentric]] (since Christ is believed to be God and his Word). This article divides Catholic perspectives into two pieces: ''official interpretations'', as presented in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], and ''unofficial interpretations'', as presented by certain [[Media (communication)|media]].

==Official interpretation==

===Past===

====Pre-Creation====
Before creation, God predestined [[Jesus]]<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/602.htm CCC 602]</ref> and his whole life,<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/600.htm CCC 600]</ref> the [[Virgin Mary]] his mother,<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/488.htm CCC 488]</ref> the church,<ref name="CCC 760">[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/760.htm CCC 760]</ref> each person to enjoy the [[beatific vision]],<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1711.htm CCC 1711]</ref> the [[universal destination of goods]],<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2452.htm CCC 2452]</ref> and all of creation to be renewed.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1047.htm CCC 1047]</ref> God did not predestine man to die,<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1008.htm CCC 1008]</ref> and "predestines no one to go to hell."<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p123a12.htm#1037 CCC 1037]</ref>

====Creation====
The world was created in a "state of journeying" to its predestined renewal,<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/302.htm CCC 302]</ref> and its creation is the first step toward [[God]] making a covenant with his people.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/288.htm CCC 288]</ref> After the sin and fall of the [[angels]],<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/392.htm CCC 392]</ref> [[Satan]] tempts [[Adam and Eve]] to sin and fall; but God promises mankind a redeemer.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/410.htm CCC 410-411]</ref> God only permitted the fall of the angels and men to display his power and love.<ref name="CCC 760" /> That said, the church interprets the creation accounts in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] symbolically.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/362.htm CCC 362]</ref>

=====Salvation history=====
{{Expand section|date=July 2020}}
Salvation history is the history of revelation.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/234.htm CCC 234]</ref> God progressively revealed to his people creation,<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c1p4.htm#287 CCC 287]</ref> himself<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/204.htm CCC 204]</ref> and the resurrection.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/992.htm CCC 992]</ref> By his promise to Abraham to make him the father of believers, God redirects human history from death to life.<ref name="CCC 1080">[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c1a1.htm#1080 CCC 1080]</ref> By accepting God's promise, Abraham inaugurates the salvation history<ref name="CCC 1080" /> that will culminate in [[Jesus]].<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/280.htm CCC 280]</ref> The [[passover]], the exodus from [[Egypt]], the giving of the [[Torah]], and the covenant with his people begin to fulfill God's promise to Abraham.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p4s1c1a1.htm#2574 CCC 2574]</ref> Salvation history includes a number of blessings - the "birth of Isaac, the escape from Egypt (Passover and Exodus), the gift of the promised land, the election of David, the presence of God in the Temple, the purifying exile, and return of a 'small remnant'"<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c1a1.htm#1081 CCC 1081]</ref> - that reveal how, from the beginning to the end of time, God's work is a blessing.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p2s1c1a1.htm#1079 CCC 1079]</ref>  

======Times of the promises and preparations======
The times of the promises and preparations is the time when God promised to send his people a redeemer and prepared his people for said redeemer.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c3a8.htm#702 CCC 702]</ref> God spoke through the prophets,<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/64.htm CCC 64]</ref> who summoned his people to [[repentance]],<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2595.htm CCC 2595]</ref> and, unlike the other [[mitzvot]] that were written by [[Moses]], God wrote the [[Decalogue]].<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2056.htm CCC 2056]</ref>

======Fullness of time======
The fullness of time is the time of fulfillment of God's promises to and preparations of his people.

======Hour of glory======
The hour of glory is the hour of Jesus<ref name="CCC 729">[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/729.htm CCC 729]</ref> and the hour of the New Covenant:<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2618.htm CCC 2618]</ref> the [[Paschal Mystery]].

===Present===

====Age of the church====
The age of the church is the age of the resurrection of Jesus<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1168.htm CCC 1168]</ref> and the age of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2819.htm CCC 2819]</ref>  The church is the beginning of the [[kingdom of God]]<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/567.htm CCC 567]</ref> that will come in its fullness at the [[second coming]].<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1042.htm CCC 1042]</ref> The second coming is hastened every time the Eucharist is celebrated,<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/1107.htm CCC 1107]</ref> and every time a [[Christians|Christian]] prays for Jesus to come<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/671.htm CCC 671]</ref> and lives according to the mind of Jesus.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2046.htm CCC 2046]</ref> The [[Assumption of Mary]] is an anticipation of the future resurrection.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/966.htm CCC 966]</ref>

=====Times of the gentiles=====
The times of the gentiles is the time when the church preaches the gospel to [[gentiles]] so that they recognize Jesus.<ref name="CCC 674">[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/674.htm CCC 674]</ref> The Noahide covenant is in force during this time, until the gospel has been preached everywhere.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/58.htm CCC 58]</ref> After the "full inclusion of the gentiles" will come the "full inclusion of the Jews."<ref name="CCC 674" />

===Future===

====Signs that proceed the second coming====
The second coming is suspended until Jesus is recognized by "all of Israel,"<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c2a7.htm#674 CCC 674]</ref> and until the church undergoes a final test by the [[antichrist]].<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c2a7.htm#675 CCC 675-677]</ref> 

=====Sign of the antichrist=====
The antichrist will be the supreme pseudo-messianism that claims to solve everyone's problems at the cost of [[apostasy]]. It will cause the final persecution of the church. The antichrist is foreshadowed throughout history by secular messianisms and [[millenarianism]].<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s2c2a7.htm#675 CCC 675-676]</ref>

====Second coming of Jesus====

==Unofficial interpretation==

===Past===
====Calculation of creation and Christmas====
The [[Anno Mundi]] is sometimes used by [[Catholics]] to determine the date of [[Christmas]].<ref>[https://www.catholic.com/magazine/online-edition/why-december-25 Catholic Answers: Why is Christmas on December 25?]</ref> 

====Deicide====
[[Jewish deicide]] is not accepted by the church. The church teaches that not Jews, but all sinners, are "the authors and the ministers" of Jesus' passion and death.<ref>[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p122a4p2.htm#597 CCC 597-598]</ref>

===Present===
====Chastisement====
Certain alleged [[private revelations]], such as [[Our Lady of Akita]] and [[Our Lady of Medjugorje]], claim mankind is undergoing a chastisement for its sins.<ref>[https://www.ncregister.com/blog/joseph-pronechen/at-akita-our-lady-gave-dire-warnings-on-todays-crisis National Catholic Register: Our Lady of Akita, Japan, and Today's Crisis]</ref><ref>[https://jkmi.worldsecuresystems.com/is-the-covid-19-pandemic-a-chastisement-prelude-to-medjugorje-s-ten-secrets Dan Lynch Apostolates: Is the Covid-19 Pandemic a Chastisement Prelude to Medjugorje's Ten Secrets?]</ref> 

====Six Ages of the World====
[[Augustine of Hippo]] believed the world is divided into six ages, with the fifth age being the contemporary age and the sixth age beginning at the second coming.<ref>[https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1303.htm New Advent: Augustine, On the Catechising of the Uninstructed, chapter 22]</ref> 

===Future===
====Signs that will proceed the second coming====
According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [[Judgment Day]] will be proceeded by the return of [[Elijah]] and [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], a number of natural disasters, and a supernatural fire that will renew creation.<ref>[https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08552a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: General Judgment]</ref> 

====Identity of the antichrist====
Some [[church fathers]], such as [[Irenaeus]] and [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], taught that the Antichrist will be a [[Jew]] from the tribe of Dan. [[Thomas Ice]] argues that the Antichrist will be a [[gentile]].<ref>[https://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1092&context=pretrib_arch The Ethnicity of the Antichrist by Thomas Ice]</ref>
