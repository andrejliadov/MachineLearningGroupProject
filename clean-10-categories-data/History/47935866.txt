== History ==

The scope of the project included compiling a list of oral history projects<ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-WomensOralHist-2001>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Kai Alexis|title=Wayback Links: Women's Oral History Collection Links|url=http://activistwomen.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2013/03/27/wayback-links/|website=Activist Women's Voices, [[Graduate Center, CUNY|The Graduate Center Library, CUNY]]: Special Collections|accessdate=September 26, 2015|date= March 27, 2013}}</ref> as well as a now-defunct searchable database of oral history collections.<ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-Consortium>{{cite web|title=Activist Women's Voices: Consortium|url=https://activistwomen.commons.gc.cuny.edu/about/consortium/|website=Activist Women's Voices, [[Graduate Center, CUNY|The Graduate Center Library, CUNY]]: Special Collections|accessdate=September 26, 2015|date=March 2013}}</ref><ref name=UWI-OralHistWomen>{{cite web|last1=The Office of the Gender and Women's Studies Librarian|title=Oral Women's History in the United States|url=https://www.library.wisc.edu/gwslibrarian/research-help/wkdl/subject-areas/history/oralhis/|website=[[University of Wisconsin Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries]]|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}</ref>

=== Methods ===
Graduate students from different concentrations within [[Graduate Center, CUNY|CUNY Graduate Center]] completed weekly internships as part of their degree programs, working at the organization that was the focus of the oral history project. Through this process they identified and interviewed leaders in the organization in a fieldwork environment within the metropolitan area of New York City.<ref name=OralHistReview-Roundtable-1998 /> After receiving training on conducting oral history interviews, the graduate students went into the field and interviewed their subjects.<ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-Overview /><ref name=OxfordHandbookOralHist-2011>{{cite book|last1=Armitage|first1=Sue|editor1-last=Ritchie|editor1-first=Donald A.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Oral History|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-195-33955-0|pages=180–181|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNkL6T8Zx4cC&lpg=PA185&ots=Wfu_uojtS2&dq=%22activist%20women's%20voices%22&pg=PA180#v=onepage&q=activist%20women's%20voices&f=false|accessdate= September 26, 2015|oclc=827753920|chapter=The Stages of Women's Oral History}}</ref>

The main focus of the interviews was on biographical experiences that shaped their community-based work, and on challenges, achievements, motivations, and methodologies used to effect changes within their communities.<ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-Overview /> The project was categorized into a subject map.<ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-SubjectMap-2013>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Kai Alexis|title=Wayback: Subject Map|url=http://activistwomen.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2013/03/27/wayback-subject-map/|website=Activist Women's Voices, [[Graduate Center, CUNY|The Graduate Center Library, CUNY]]: Special Collections|accessdate=September 26, 2015|date= March 27, 2013}}</ref>

=== Processing ===
In 2011, a finding aid was completed. In 2013, digitization of the 77 audio cassettes and 2,300 pages of interview transcripts was completed, with clips of some of the oral histories made available online in 2014.<ref name=CUNYGradCtr-AWV-FindingAid-2011>{{cite book|last1=Handis|first1=Michael W.|url=http://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=gc_arch|title=Activist Women's Voices Oral History Collection, 1995-2000, Finding Aid (Archives and Special Collections.
