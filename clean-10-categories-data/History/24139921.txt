The World Monuments Watch is a flagship advocacy program of the [[New York City|New York]]-based private [[non-profit organization]] [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) that calls international attention to [[cultural heritage]] around the world that is threatened by [[neglect]], [[vandalism]], [[war|conflict]], or [[natural disaster|disaster]].<ref name=press_release>{{cite web|author1=World Monuments Fund |title=2008 World Monuments Watch List Of 100 Most Endangered Sites |url=http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Watch_2008_site_descriptions_0.pdf |website=World Monuments Fund |publisher=World Monuments Fund |accessdate=27 July 2015 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320161546/http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/Watch_2008_site_descriptions_0.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2013 }}</ref>

==Selection process==
Every two years, it publishes a select list known as the Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites that are in urgent need of [[Historic preservation|preservation]] funding and protection. The sites are nominated by governments, conservation professionals, site caretakers, [[non-government organization]]s (NGOs), concerned individuals, and others working in the field.<ref name=press_release /> An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the sites, the urgency of the threat, and the viability of both advocacy and conservation solutions.<ref name=press_release /> For the succeeding two-year period until a new Watch List is published, these 100 sites can avail grants and funds from the WMF, as well as from other foundations, private donors, and corporations by capitalizing on the publicity and attention gained from the inclusion on the Watch List.<ref>{{cite web|author1=World Monuments Fund|title=2006 World Monuments Watch List Of 100 Most Endangered Sites|url=http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/press_releases/WMW_2006_release.pdf|website=World Monuments Fund|publisher=World Monuments Fund|accessdate=27 July 2015|format=PDF}}</ref> Since [[1996 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites|the Watch List was launched in 1996]], more than 75 percent of the enlisted threatened sites have been saved.<ref name=press_release />

==2008 Watch List==
The 2008 World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites was announced on June 6, 2007 by WMF President Bonnie Burnham.<ref name=press_release /><ref>{{cite web|title=2008 Panelists Bios |publisher=World Monuments Fund |url=http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_panel.pdf |accessdate=3 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513042550/http://wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_panel.pdf |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}</ref> The 2008 Watch List highlights three critical man-made threats affecting the world's cultural heritage: political conflict, unchecked [[Urban planning|urban]] and [[industrial development]], and [[global climate change]].<ref name=press_release />
{{cquote|On this list, man is indeed the real enemy. But, just as we caused the damage in the first place, we have the power to repair it, by taking our responsibility as caretakers of the world’s cultural heritage seriously. So today we are sounding the alarm, using the World Monuments Watch List to demonstrate, through the vivid examples of beloved places around the world, the importance of working together to meet these challenges and join forces to protect our world’s shared architectural heritage.|200px||Bonnie Burnham, WMF president|launch of 2008 Watch List<ref name=press_release />}}
