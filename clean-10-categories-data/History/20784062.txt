{{other uses|Neutral (disambiguation)}}

'''Neutrality''' is the tendency not to ''side'' in a conflict (physical or ideological),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/neutral|title=the definition of neutral|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neutrality|title=Definition of NEUTRALITY|author=|date=|website=www.Merriam-Webster.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref><ref name="IFRC">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/who-we-are/vision-and-mission/the-seven-fundamental-principles/neutrality/|title=Neutrality - IFRC|author=|date=|website=www.IFRC.org|access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref> which may not suggest neutral parties do not have a side or are not a side themselves.
In colloquial use ''neutral'' can be synonymous with ''unbiased''. However, bias is a favoritism for some side,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bias|title=the definition of bias|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bias|title=Definition of BIAS|author=|date=|website=www.Merriam-Webster.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref> distinct of the tendency to act on that favoritism.

Neutrality is distinct (though not exclusive) from [[apathy]], [[ignorance]], indifference, [[doublethink]], equality,<ref name="ASM">{{cite web|url=http://www.asm.wisc.edu/viewpoint-neutrality-in-funding-decisions.html|title=Associated Students of Madison, Viewpoint Neutrality in Funding Decisions|author=|date=|website=Wisc.edu|access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref> [[Consensus|agreement]], and [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]]. Apathy and indifference each imply a level of carelessness about a subject, though a person exhibiting neutrality may feel bias on a subject but choose not to act on it. A neutral person can also be well-informed on a subject and therefore need not be ignorant. Since they can be biased, a neutral person need not feature doublethink (i.e. accepting both sides as correct), equality (i.e. viewing both sides as equal), or agreement (a form of group decision-making; here it would require negotiating a solution on everyone's opinion, including one's own which may not be unbiased). Objectivity suggests siding with the more reasonable position (except [[journalistic objectivity]]), where reasonableness is judged by some common basis between the sides, such as logic (thereby avoiding the problem of [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]]). Neutrality implies tolerance regardless of how disagreeable, deplorable, or unusual a perspective might be.<ref name="ASM" />

In moderation and mediation, neutrality is often expected to make judgments or facilitate dialog independent of any bias, putting emphasis on the process rather than the outcome.<ref name="ASM"/> For example, a neutral party is seen as a party with no (or a fully disclosed) [[conflict of interest]] in a conflict,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/neutral-party.html|title=What is neutral party? definition and meaning|author=|date=|website=BusinessDictionary.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref> and is expected to operate as if it has no bias.
Neutral parties are often perceived as more trustworthy, reliable, and safe.<ref name="IFRC"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emotional-neutrality.asp|title=Emotional Neutrality|first=Investopedia|last=Staff|date=21 May 2008|website=Investopedia.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref>

Alternative to acting without a bias, the bias of neutrality itself is the expectation upon the Swiss government (in [[armed neutrality]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/specials/switzerland_how_to/politics/Armed_neutrality.html?cid=29289102|title=Armed neutrality|author=|date=|website=SwissInfo.ch|access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref> and the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (in [[non-interventionism]]).<ref name="IFRC"/>

==Criticisms and views==
Neutrality implies not judging the validity of an opinion.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
Thus, a neutral position will provide a platform for all opinions, including irrational or malicious ones.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In classical periods of enlightenment, neutrality has been looked down upon as a character vice, an escape from one's duty to think and to act,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} as opposed to the modern trend of esteeming neutrality as a virtue.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

We are not trying to keep out of trouble; we are trying to preserve the foundations on which peace may be rebuilt."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/woodrowwil401895.html|title=Woodrow Wilson Quotes|author=|date=|website=BrainyQuote.com|access-date=16 July 2017}}</ref>
