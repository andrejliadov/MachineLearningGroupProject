The '''Baby Scoop Era''' was a period in [[anglosphere]] history starting after the end of [[World War II]] and ending in the early 1970s,<ref>[http://www.babyscoopera.com The Baby Scoop Era Research Initiative]</ref> characterized by an increased rate of [[Premarital sex|pre-marital pregnancies]] over the preceding period, along with a higher rate of newborn [[adoption]].

==History==

===In the United States===
From 1945 to 1973, it is estimated that up to 4 million parents in the [[United States]] had children placed for adoption, with 2 million during the 1960s alone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adoption/topics/adoptionstatistics.htm |title=Adoption Statistics |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=The Adoption History Project |publisher=University of Oregon |accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref> Annual numbers for non-relative adoptions increased from an estimated 33,800 in 1951 to a peak of 89,200 in 1970, then quickly declined to an estimated 47,700 in 1975.<ref>Pelton, L.

This period of history has been documented in scholarly books such as ''Wake Up Little Susie'' and ''Beggars and Choosers'', both by historian [[Rickie Solinger]], and social histories such as the book ''[[The Girls Who Went Away]]'' and the documentary, ''[[A Girl Like Her]]'', based on the book by Ann Fessler.  Fessler is a professor of photography at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] who exhibited an [[art installation]] titled ''The Girls Who Went Away''.  It is also the theme of the documentary "Gone To A Good Home" by [[Film Australia]].

Beginning in the 1940s and 1950s, [[illegitimacy]] began to be defined in terms of psychological deficits on the part of the mother.<ref>Solinger, R. (2000). ''Wake Up Little Susie: Single Pregnancy and Race Before Roe v. Wade.'' (p. 88)</ref>  At the same time, a liberalization of sexual morals combined with restrictions on access to [[birth control]] led to an increase in premarital pregnancies.<ref>Petrie, A. (1998). ''Gone to an Aunt's: Remembering Canada's Homes for Unwed Mothers.'' (pp. 7–8)</ref>  The dominant psychological and social work view was that the large majority of unmarried mothers were better off being separated by adoption from their newborn babies.<ref>O'Shaughnassy, T. (1994). ''Adoption, [[Social Work]], and Social Theory'' (p. 115)</ref>  According to Mandell (2007), "In most cases, adoption was presented to the mothers as the only option and little or no effort was made to help the mothers keep and raise the children".<ref>[http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue42/Mandell42.htm Mandell, B. (2007). "Adoption."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519045842/http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue42/Mandell42.htm |date=2007-05-19 }} ''New Politics'', Vol. 11, No. 2, Winter 2007, Whole No. 42</ref>

Solinger describes the social pressures that led to this unusual trend, explaining that women who had no control over their reproductive lives were defined by psychological theory as "not-mothers", and that because they had no control over their reproductive lives, they were subject to the ideology of those who watched over them. As such, for unmarried pregnant girls and women in the pre-''[[Roe v. Wade|Roe]]'' era, the main chance for attaining home and marriage rested on their acknowledging their alleged shame and guilt, and this required relinquishing their children, with more than 80% of unwed mothers in maternity homes acting in essence as "breeders" for adoptive parents.<ref>Solinger, R. (2000). ''Wake Up Little Susie: Single Pregnancy and Race Before Roe v. Wade.'' (p. 95)</ref> According to Ellison, from 1960 to 1970, 27 percent of all births to married women between the ages of 15 and 29 were conceived [[Premarital Sex#United States|premaritally]]. This problem was thought to be caused by female [[neurosis]], and those who could not procure an [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]], legally or otherwise, were encouraged to put up their children for adoption.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ellison, M.|year=2003|title=Authoritative Knowledge and Single Women's Unintentional Pregnancies, Abortions, Adoption and Single Motherhood: Social Stigma and Structural Violence|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|volume=17|issue=3|pages=322–47|pmid=12974201|doi=10.1525/maq.2003.17.3.322}}</ref>

In popular usage, singer Celeste Billhartz uses the term "baby scoop era" on her website to refer to the era covered by her work "The Mothers Project."<ref>{{cite web|title=About The Mothers Project ...|author=Celeste Billhartz|work=The Mothers Project|url=http://www.themothersproject.com/about/aboutTMP.html|access-date=2007-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905160022/http://themothersproject.com/about/aboutTMP.html|archive-date=2008-09-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>  A letter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billfinch.org/blog/archive/2006_04_09_archive.html |title=More Adoption Support |date=April 15, 2006 |work=BillFinch.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016172238/http://billfinch.org/blog/archive/2006_04_09_archive.html |archivedate=2007-10-16 }}</ref> on Senator [[Bill Finch (politician)|Bill Finch]]'s website uses the term as well.

"World of Adoption; Forced to Give Up Her Baby, She Now Opposes Adoption," ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]'', November 21, 2004, p. G-1.</ref>

Infant adoptions began declining in the early 1970s, a decline often attributed to the decreasing birth rate, but which also partially resulted from social and legal changes that enabled  middle-class mothers to have an alternative [[single mother]]hood.

The decline in the fertility rate is associated with the introduction of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] in 1960, the completion of legalization of [[birth control|artificial birth control]] methods, the introduction of [[Title X|federal funding]] to make [[family planning]] services more available to the young and low income, and the legalization of abortion.

Brozinsky (1994) speaks of the decline in newborn adoptions as reflecting a freedom of choice embraced by youth and the women's movement of the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in an increase in the number of unmarried mothers who parented their babies as opposed to having them taken for adoption purposes. "In 1970, approximately 80% of the infants born to single mothers were [...] [taken for adoption purposes], whereas by 1983 that figure had dropped to only 4%."<ref>Brozinsky, A. (1994). "Surrendering an Infant for Adoption:  The Birthmother Experience".  In ''The Psychology of Adoption'', D. Brozinsky and M. Schechter (Eds.).  New York:  Oxford University Press. (p. 297)</ref>  

In contrast to numbers in the 1960s and 1970s, from 1989 to 1995 fewer than 1% of children born to never-married women were surrendered for adoption.<ref>Chandra, A., Abma, J., Maza, P., & Bachrach, C.

====In Canada====
Canada's "Baby Scoop Era" refers to the postwar period from 1945 to 1988, when over 400,000 unmarried pregnant girls, mostly aged 15–19, were targeted for their yet-to-be-born infants, because they were unmarried with a child. A large number of these young women were housed in maternity group homes, which were managed by religious orders, such as the [[The Salvation Army, Canada|Salvation Army]], the [[Catholic Church in Canada|Catholic Church]], the [[United Church of Canada|United Church]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican Church]] etc. These maternity "homes" were heavily funded by the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]]. There were over 70 maternity homes in Canada which housed between 20 and 200 pregnant women at a time. In Canadian maternity "homes" and hospitals, up to 100% of newborns were removed from their legal mothers after birth and given up for adoption purposes. These newborns were taken under a Health and Welfare protocol.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Leigh Ann|title=Taken|journal=Anglican Journal|date=May 13, 2014|url=http://www.anglicanjournal.com/articles/taken|accessdate=July 20, 2014}}</ref>

Some professionals of the era considered that the punishment of the mother for her transgression was an important part of the process. Dr. Marion Hilliard of [[Women's College Hospital]] was quoted in 1956 saying: <blockquote>The father plays absolutely no part in this. That is part of her rehabilitation. When she renounces her child for its own good, the unwed mother has learned a lot. She has learned an important human value. She has learned to pay the price of her misdemeanor, and this alone, if punishment is needed, is punishment enough...We must go back to a primary set of values and the discipline that starts with the very small child.<ref>Dorothy Howarth, “Mothers not all unhappy”, ''The Toronto Telegram'', November 22, 1956.</ref></blockquote>The term Baby Scoop Era is similar to the term [[Sixties Scoop]], which was coined by Patrick Johnston, author of ''Native Children and the Child Welfare System''.<ref>[http://research2.csci.educ.ubc.ca/indigenation/Indian_ReACTions/Indian_ReACTions/SixtiesScoop.htm Reder, D. (2007). ''Indian re:ACT(ions)''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021111031/http://research2.csci.educ.ubc.ca/indigenation/Indian_ReACTions/Indian_ReACTions/SixtiesScoop.htm |date=2007-10-21 }} University of British Columbia</ref> "Sixties Scoop" refers to the Canadian practice, beginning in the 1960s and continuing until the late 1980s, of apprehending unusually high numbers of Native children over the age of 5 years old from their families and fostering or adopting them out.<ref>[http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_01.13.00/news/nation.php Lyons, T. (2000). "Stolen Nation,"] in ''Eye Weekly'', January 13, 2000. Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.</ref> A similar event happened in Australia where Aboriginal children, sometimes referred to as the [[Stolen Generation]], were removed from their families and placed into internment camps, orphanages and other institutions.

====In Australia====
A similar period of [[forced adoption in Australia|forced adoption]], also known as the "White Stolen Generations", also occurred in Australia. It is generally understood that a decline of adoption during the 1970s was linked to a 1973 law providing for financial assistance to single parents.<ref>Parliamentary Paper No. 366, Standing Committee on Social Issues, Report on Adoption Practices, Second Interim Report, Transcripts of Evidence, 16 June 1999 – 25 October 1999</ref>
