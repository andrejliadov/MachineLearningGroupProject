{{Human history}}
'''Ancient history''' as a term refers to the aggregate of past events<ref name="wordnet">[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn WordNet Search – 3.0], "History" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050917065532/http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn |date=2005-09-17 }}</ref> from the beginning of writing and [[History of writing|recorded]] [[History of the world|human history]] and extending as far as [[post-classical history]]. The phrase may be used either to refer to the period of time or the academic discipline.

The span of [[recorded history]] is roughly 5,000 years, beginning with the [[Sumer]]ian [[cuneiform]] script, with the oldest coherent texts from about 2600 BC.<ref>See also ''The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of Writing'', [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], ''Thirty Nine Firsts In Recorded History'', pp. 381–383.</ref> Ancient history covers all continents inhabited by humans in the period 3000 BC – AD 500.

The broad term "ancient history" is not to be confused with "classical antiquity". The term [[classical antiquity]] is often used to refer to [[Western world#Historical divisions|Western history]] in the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Ancient Mediterranean]] from the beginning of recorded Greek history in 776 BC (first [[Olympiad]]). This roughly coincides with the traditional date of the [[founding of Rome]] in 753 BC, the beginning of the history of [[ancient Rome]], and the beginning of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] in [[Ancient Greece]].

The academic term "history" is not to be confused with colloquial references to times past. History is fundamentally the study of the past, and can be either scientific ([[archaeology]]) or [[Humanistic historiography|humanistic]] (history through language).

Although the ending date of ancient history is disputed, some [[Western culture|Western]] scholars use the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD (the most used),<ref>Clare, I.S. (1906).

Outside of Europe the 450–500 time frame for the end of ancient times has had difficulty as a transition date from ancient to post-classical times.

During the time period of ancient history (starting roughly from 3000 BC), the [[world population]] was already exponentially increasing due to the [[Neolithic Revolution]], which was in full progress. According to HYDE estimates from the Netherlands, world population increased exponentially in this period. In 10,000 BC in [[prehistory]], the world population had stood at 2 million, rising to 45 million by 3,000 BC.  By the rise of the [[Iron Age]] in 1,000 BC, the population had risen to 72 million. By the end of the period in 500 AD, the world population is thought to have stood at 209 million. In 3,500 years, the world population increased by 100 times.<ref name="mnp.nl">[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0959683609356587 Data] from [http://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/index.html History Database of the Global Environment.]  K.

==Study==
Historians have two major avenues which they take to better understand the ancient world: [[archaeology]] and the study of [[source text]]s. [[Primary source]]s are those sources closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/guides/primary-sources.html |title=Primary, secondary and tertiary sources |publisher=Lib.umd.edu |date=2008-05-23 |access-date=2010-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230070606/http://www.lib.umd.edu/guides/primary-sources.html |archive-date=2009-12-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |title=Primary, secondary and tertiary sources |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |archive-date= 2005-02-12}}</ref> Primary sources have been distinguished from [[secondary sources]], which often cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources.<ref>Oscar Handlin et al., ''Harvard Guide to American History'' (1954) p. 118-246</ref>

{{Main|Source text}}

Most of what is known of the ancient world comes from the accounts of antiquity's own historians. Although it is important to take into account the bias of each ancient author, their accounts are the basis for our understanding of the ancient past. Some of the more notable ancient writers include [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Arrian]], [[Plutarch]], [[Polybius]], [[Sima Qian]], [[Sallust]], [[Livy]], [[Josephus]], [[Suetonius]], and [[Tacitus]].

A fundamental difficulty of studying ancient history is that [[recorded history|recorded histories]] cannot document the entirety of human events, and only a fraction of those documents have survived into the present day.<ref name="GardnerP">Gardner, P. (1892). New chapters in Greek history, historical results of recent excavations in Greece and Asia Minor. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. pp. 1–.</ref> Furthermore, the reliability of the information obtained from these surviving records must be considered.<ref name="GardnerP" /><ref>Smith, M.S. (2002). The early history of God: Yahweh and the other deities in ancient Israel. The Biblical resource series. Grand Rapids, Mich: William B. Eerdmans Pub. pp. xxii–xxiii</ref> Few people were capable of writing histories, as literacy was not widespread in almost any culture until long after the end of ancient history.<ref>Nadin, M. (1997). The civilization of illiteracy. Dresden: Dresden University Press.</ref>

The earliest known systematic historical thought emerged in [[ancient Greece]], beginning with [[Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484–c. 425 BC). [[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta,<ref name="Cochrane, Charles Norris 1929. p. 179">Cochrane, Charles Norris. ''Thucydides and the Science of History'', Oxford University Press, 1929. p. 179.</ref> establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event.<ref name="Cochrane, Charles Norris 1929. p. 179" />

The [[Roman Empire]] was an ancient culture with a relatively high literacy rate,<ref>Harris, W.V. (1989). Ancient literacy. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. p. 175.</ref> but many works by its most widely read historians are lost. For example, [[Livy]], a Roman historian who lived in the 1st century BC, wrote a history of Rome called ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' (''From the Founding of the City'') in 144 volumes; only 35 volumes still exist, although short summaries of most of the rest do exist. Indeed, no more than a minority of the work of any major Roman historian has survived.

===Timeline of ancient history===
{{Main|Timeline of ancient history}}
{{Ancient chronology}}
This gives a listed timeline, ranging from 3300 BC to 600 AD, that provides an overview of ancient history.

==Chronology==

===Prehistory===
{{Main|Prehistory|Neolithic Revolution}}

Prehistory is the period before [[Recorded history|written history]]. The [[early human migration]]s<ref>H. Liu, F. Prugnolle, A. Manica, [[Francois Balloux|F. Balloux]], ''A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History.'' The American Journal of Human Genetics, Volume 79, Issue 2, pp. 230–237</ref> in the [[Lower Paleolithic]] saw ''[[Homo erectus]]'' spread across Eurasia 1.8 million years ago. The controlled use of fire first occurred 800,000 years ago in the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. 250,000 years ago, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' (modern humans) [[Human evolution|emerged]] in [[Africa]]. 60–70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens migrated out of Africa along a coastal route to [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and reached [[Australia]]. 50,000 years ago, modern humans spread from [[Asia]] to the [[Near East]]. [[Europe]] was first reached by modern humans 40,000 years ago. Humans [[migration to the New World|migrated to the Americas]] about 15,000 years ago in the [[Upper Paleolithic]].

The 10th millennium BC is the earliest given date for the [[Neolithic revolution|invention of agriculture]] and the beginning of the ancient era. [[Göbekli Tepe]] was erected by [[hunter-gatherer]]s in the [[10th millennium BC]] (c. 11,500 years ago), before the advent of [[sedentism]]. Together with [[Nevali Cori|Nevalı Çori]], it has revolutionized understanding of the Eurasian [[Neolithic]]. In the 7th millennium BC, [[Jiahu]] culture began in [[China]]. By the 5th millennium BC, the late Neolithic civilizations saw the invention of the [[wheel]] and the spread of [[proto-writing]]. In the 4th millennium BC, the [[Cucuteni culture|Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] in the [[Ukraine]]-[[Moldova]]-[[Romania]] region develops. By 3400 BC, "proto-literate" [[cuneiform]] is spread in the Middle East.<ref>{{Harvnb|Diamond|1999|p=218}}</ref> The 30th century BC, referred to as the [[Early Bronze Age II]], saw the beginning of the literate period in [[Mesopotamia]] and ancient Egypt. Around the 27th century BC, the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]] and the First Dynasty of [[Uruk]] are founded, according to the earliest reliable [[regnal era]]s.

The [[Bronze Age]] forms part of the [[three-age system]]. It follows the [[Neolithic Age]] in some areas of the world. In most areas of civilization bronze smelting became a foundation for more advanced societies. There was some contrast with New World societies, who often still preferred stone to metal for utilitarian purposes. Modern historians have identified five original civilizations which emerged in the time period.<ref name="Haviland 2013">{{cite book |last1=Haviland |first1=William |display-authors=etal |title=Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2013 |page=250 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DfEWAAAAQBAJ&q=%22civilization+refers+to+societies%22|isbn=978-1-285-67530-5 }}</ref><ref>''Understanding Early Civilizations: A Comparative Study'', Trigger, Bruce G., Cambridge University Press, 2007</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}

* [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]] in the [[Andes]]
* [[Olmecs|Olmec]] in [[Mesoamerica]]

The first civilization emerged in Sumer in the southern region of [[Mesopotamia]], now part of modern-day Iraq. By 3000 BC, Sumerian city states had collectively formed [[civilization]], with government, religion, division of labor and writing. Among the city states [[Ur]] was among the most significant.

In the 24th century BC, the [[Akkadian Empire]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/nt/Gilgamesh/akkadian.html|title=Akkadian Empire|work=angelfire.com}}</ref><ref>Wells, H.G. (1921). [https://archive.org/details/outlinehistoryb08wellgoog The outline of history, being a plain history of life and mankind] New York: Macmillan company. p. 137.</ref> was founded in Mesopotamia. From Sumer, civilization and bronze smelting spread westward to Egypt, the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] and the [[Hittites]].

The [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]] of the 22nd century BC was followed by the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] between the 21st to 17th centuries BC. The [[Sumerian Renaissance]] also developed c. the 21st century BC in [[Ur]]. Around the 18th century BC, the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt]] began. Egypt was a superpower at the time. By 1600 BC, [[Mycenaean Greece]] developed and invaded the remains of Minoan civilization. The beginning of Hittite dominance of the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] region is also seen in the 1600s BC. The time from the 16th to the 11th centuries BC around the Nile is called the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Between 1550 BC and 1292 BC, the [[Amarna Period]] developed in Egypt.

East of the Iranian world, was the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus River Valley civilization]] which organized cities neatly on grid patterns.<ref>{{Cite book|title=World History Cultures, States and Society to 1500|last1=Berger|first1=Eugene|last2=Israel|first2=George|last3=Miller|first3=Charlotte|last4=Parkinson|first4=Brian|last5=Reeves|first5=Andrew|last6=Williams|first6=Nadejda|publisher=University of North Georgia, Press|isbn=978-1-940771-10-6|location=Dahlonega, Georgia|page=79|date=2016-09-30}}</ref>
However the Indus River Valley civilization diminished after 1900 BC and was later replaced with [[Indo-Aryan peoples]] who established [[Vedic period|Vedic culture]].

The beginning of the [[Shang dynasty]] emerged in China in this period, and there was evidence of a fully developed [[Chinese writing system]]. The Shang Dynasty is the first Chinese regime recognized by western scholars though Chinese historians insist that the [[Xia dynasty]] preceded it. The Shang dynasty practiced forced labor to complete public projects. There is evidence of massive ritual burial.

Across the ocean, the earliest known civilization of the Americas appeared in the river valleys of the desert coast of central modern day Peru. The Norte Chico civilization's first city flourished around 3100 BC.  The Olmecs are supposed to appear later in Mesoamerica between the 14th and 13th century.

====Early Iron Age====
{{Main|Iron Age}}{{More citations needed section|date=July 2018}}

The [[Iron Age]] is the last principal period in the three-age system, preceded by the Bronze Age. Its date and context vary depending on the country or geographical region. The Iron Age over all was characterized by the prevalent smelting of iron with [[ferrous metallurgy]] and the use of [[carbon steel]]. Smelted iron proved more durable than earlier metals such as [[copper]] or [[bronze]] and allowed for more productive societies. The Iron Age took place at different times in different parts of the world, and comes to an end when a society began to maintain historical records.[[File:Bronze Age End.svg|thumb|500x500px|Map of the [[late Bronze Age collapse]], c. 1200 BC|alt=|center]]During the 13th to 12th centuries BC, the [[Ramesside Period]] occurred in Egypt. Around 1200&nbsp;BC, the [[Trojan War]] was thought to have taken place.<ref>Strauss, Barry S. (2006) The Trojan War: A New History. Simon & Schuster {{ISBN|978-0-7432-6441-9}}</ref> By around 1180&nbsp;BC, the disintegration of the [[Hittite Empire]] was under way. The collapse of the Hitties was part of the larger scale Bronze Age Collapse which took place in the Ancient Near East around 1200&nbsp;BC. In Greece the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenae]] and [[Minoan civilization|Minona]] both disintegrated. A wave of [[Sea Peoples]] attacked many countries, only Egypt survived intact. Afterwards some entirely new successor civilizations arose in the Eastern Mediterranean.

In 1046 BC, the Zhou force, led by [[King Wu of Zhou]], overthrew the last king of the Shang dynasty. The [[Zhou dynasty]] was established in China shortly thereafter. During this Zhou era China embraced a feudal society of decentralized power. Iron Age China then dissolved into the [[Warring States period|warring states period]] where possibly millions of soldiers fought each other over feudal struggles.

[[Pirak]] is an early iron-age site in [[Balochistan]], [[Pakistan]], going back to about 1200&nbsp;BC. This period is believed to be the beginning of the [[Iron Age India|Iron Age in India]] and the subcontinent.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4s-YsP6vcIC&pg=PA311|title=The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan|last1=Allchin|first1=Bridget|last2=Allchin|first2=Raymond|date=1982-07-29|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-28550-6|pages=311|language=en}}</ref> Around the same time came the [[Vedas]], the oldest sacred texts for the [[Hinduism|Hindu religion]].

In 1000&nbsp;BC, the [[Mannaeans|Mannaean]] Kingdom began in [[Western Asia]]. Around the 10th to 7th centuries BC, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] developed in Mesopotamia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Neo-Assyrian_Empire/|title=Neo-Assyrian Empire|website=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331043835/https://www.ancient.eu/Neo-Assyrian_Empire/|archive-date=2019-03-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 800&nbsp;BC, the rise of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-states began.

==== Axial Age ====
{{Main|Axial Age}}
The preceding [[Iron Age]] is often thought to have ended in the Middle East around 550 BC due to the rise of [[historiography]] (the historical record). The [[Axial Age]] is used to describe history between 800 and 200 BC of Eurasia, including [[ancient Greece]], [[History of Iran|Iran]], [[Middle kingdoms of India|India]] and [[History of China|China]]. Widespread trade and communication between distinct regions in this period, including the rise of the [[Silk Road]]. This period saw the rise of [[philosophy]] and proselytizing religions.

Philosophy, religion and science were diverse in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] producing thinkers such as [[Confucius]], [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]] and [[Mozi]] during the sixth century BC. Similar trends emerged throughout Eurasia in India with the rise of [[Early Buddhism|Buddhism]], in the Near East with [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Judaism]] and in the west with [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. In these developments religious and philosophical figures were all searching for human meaning.<ref name = "Neville">{{cite book | last = Neville | first = Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&q=%22Axial+Age&pg=PA104 | year = 2002 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn =978-0-7914-5424-4 | page = 104}}</ref>

The Axial Age and its aftermath saw large wars and the formation of large empires that stretched beyond the limits of earlier Iron Age Societies. Significant for the time was the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peter|first=Turchin|date=14 April 2012|title=Religion and Empire in the Axial Age|url=http://peterturchin.com/PDF/Bellah_RBB.pdf|journal=Religion, Brain & Behavior|page=3|access-date=27 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604213741/http://peterturchin.com/PDF/Bellah_RBB.pdf|archive-date=4 June 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> The empire's vast territory extended from modern day [[Egypt]] to [[Xinjiang]]. The empire's legacy include the rise of commerce over land routes through Eurasia as well as the spreading of Persian culture through the middle east. The [[Royal Road]] allowed for efficient trade and taxation.  Though Macedonian [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in its entirety, the unity of Alexander's conquests did not survive past his lifetime. Greek culture, and technology spread through West and South Asia often synthesizing with local cultures.

====Formation of empires and fragmentation====

Separate [[Diadochi|Greek Kingdoms]] Egypt and Asia encouraged trade and communication like earlier Persian administrations.<ref>"Mastering World History" by Philip L. Groisser, New York, 1970, p.17</ref> Combined with the expansion of the [[Han dynasty]] westward the Silk Road as a series of routes made possible the exchange of goods between the Mediterranean Basin, South Asia and East Asia.  In South Asia, the Mauryan empire briefly annexed much of the Indian Subcontinent though short lived, its reign had the legacies of spreading Buddhism and providing an inspiration to later Indian states.

Supplanting the warring Greek Kingdoms in the western world came the growing [[Roman Republic]] and the Iranian [[Parthian Empire]].  As a result of empires, urbanization and literacy spread to locations which had previously been at the periphery of civilization as known by the large empires. Upon the turn of the millennium the independence of tribal peoples and smaller kingdoms were threatened by more advanced states. Empires were not just remarkable for their territorial size but for their administration and the dissemination of culture and trade, in this way the influence of empires often extended far beyond their national boundaries. Trade routes expanded by land and sea and allowed for flow of goods between distant regions even in the absence of communication. Distant nations such as Imperial Rome and the Chinese Han Dynasty [[Sino-Roman relations|rarely communicated]] but trade of goods did occur as evidenced by archaeological discoveries such as Roman coins in Vietnam. At this time most of the world's population inhabited only a small part of the earth's surface. Outside of civilization large geographic areas such as [[Siberia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub Saharan Africa]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]] remained sparsely populated. The [[New World]] hosted a variety of separate civilizations in the but its own trade networks were smaller due to the lack of draft animals and the wheel.

Empires with their immense military strength remained fragile to civil wars, economic decline and a changing political environment internationally. In 220 AD Han China collapsed into [[Three Kingdoms|warring states]] while the European Roman Empire began to suffer from turmoil in the [[Crisis of the Third Century|Third Century Crisis]]. In Persia regime change took place from [[Parthia|Parthian Empire]] to the more centralized [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian Empire]]. The land based Silk Road continued to deliver profits in trade but came under continual assault by nomads all on the northern frontiers of Eurasian nations. Safer sea routes began to gain preference in the early centuries AD

Proselytizing religions began to replace [[polytheism]] and [[folk religion]]s in many areas. [[History of Christianity|Christianity]] gained a wide following in the Roman Empire, Zoroastrianism became the state enforced religion of Iran and [[History of Buddhism|Buddhism]] spread to East Asia from South Asia. Social change, political transformation as well as ecological events all contributed to the end of Ancient Times and the beginning of the Post Classical era in Eurasia roughly around the year 500.

[[File:Museo Barracco - Giove Ammone 1010637.JPG|alt=Jupiter Ammon|thumb|Roman cast [[terracotta]] of ram-horned ''Jupiter Ammon'', a form of [[Zeus]] 1st century AD. Gods, could sometimes be transferred or adopted by many civilizations, and then adjusted for local conditions.]]
The rise of civilization corresponded with the institutional sponsorship of belief in gods, supernatural forces and the afterlife. During the [[Bronze Age]], many civilizations adopted their own form of [[Polytheism]]. Usually, polytheistic Gods manifested human personalities, strengths and failings.  Early religion was often based on location, with cities or entire countries selecting a deity, that would grant them preferences and advantages over their competitors. Worship involved the construction of representation of deities, and the granting of sacrifices. Sacrifices could be material goods, food, or in extreme cases human sacrifice to please a deity. New [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[religions]] arose in both east and west, particularly about the 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with some of the earliest major ones being [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]] in [[India]], and [[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]. The [[Abrahamic religion]]s trace their origin to [[Judaism]], around 1800 BC.

The ancient [[Indian philosophy]] is a fusion of two ancient traditions: [[Sramana]] tradition and [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic tradition]]. Indian philosophy begins with the ''[[Vedas]]'' where questions related to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. Jainism and Buddhism are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic world view of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like [[Ahimsa]], [[Karma]], [[Jnana]], [[Saṃsāra|Samsara]] and [[Moksha|Moksa]]. While there are ancient relations between the Indian [[Vedas]] and the Iranian [[Avesta]], the two main families of the [[Iranian philosophy|Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions]] were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view on the role of man in the universe.

In the east, three schools of thought were to dominate [[China|Chinese]] thinking until the modern day. These were [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Confucianism]]. The Confucian tradition, which would attain dominance, looked for [[political]] [[morality]] not to the force of law but to the power and example of tradition. Confucianism would later spread into the [[Korean peninsula]] and [[Goguryeo]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skkok.com/?_page=43 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081713/http://www.skkok.com/?_page=43 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-16 |script-title=ko:자랑스런 성균관 꽃피우는 유교문화 올바른 인성교육 성균관 예절교실  |publisher=Skkok.com |access-date=2010-01-09|language=ko}}</ref> and toward [[Japan]].

In the west, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophical tradition, represented by [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], was diffused throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] in the 4th century BC by the conquests of [[Alexander III of Macedon]], more commonly known as [[Alexander the Great]]. After the [[Bronze and Iron Age religion]]s formed, the rise and spread of [[Christianity]] through the Roman world marked the end of [[Hellenistic]] philosophy and ushered in the beginnings of [[Medieval philosophy]].

===Science and technology===

[[File:Pont Du Gard.jpg|thumb|The [[Pont du Gard]], a Roman aqueduct in France.]]

In the [[history of technology]] and [[ancient science]] during the growth of the ancient civilizations, [[ancient technology|ancient technological]] advances were produced in [[engineering]]. These advances stimulated other societies to adopt new ways of living and governance. Sometimes, technological development was sponsored by the state.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

The characteristics of [[Ancient Egyptian technology]] are indicated by a set of artifacts and customs that lasted for thousands of years. The Egyptians invented and used many basic machines, such as the ramp and the lever, to aid construction processes. The Egyptians also played an important role in developing Mediterranean maritime technology including ships and lighthouses.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Water managing [[Qanat]]s which likely emerged on the [[Iran]]ian plateau and possibly also in the [[Arabian peninsula]] sometime in the early 1st millennium BC spread from there slowly west- and eastward.<ref>[[Andrew Wilson (classical archaeologist)|Andrew Wilson]]: "Hydraulic Engineering and Water Supply", in: [[John Peter Oleson]]: ''Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2008 (editor), {{ISBN|978-0-19-973485-6}}, pp. 291f.</ref>

The [[history of Science and Technology in India|history of science and technology in India]] dates back to ancient times. The Indus Valley civilization yields evidence of [[hydrography]],  and sewage collection and disposal being practiced by its inhabitants. Among the fields of science and technology pursued in India were [[History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent|metallurgy]], [[Indian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Ayurveda]]. Some ancient [[List of Indian inventions|inventions]] include [[plastic surgery]], [[cataract surgery]], [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] and [[Wootz steel]].
The [[history of science and technology in China]] show significant advances in science, technology, mathematics, and astronomy. The first recorded observations of comets and [[SN 185|supernovae]] were made in China. Traditional [[Chinese medicine]], [[acupuncture]] and herbal medicine were also practiced.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

[[Ancient Greek technology]] developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks such as the gear, screw, bronze casting techniques, water clock, water organ, torsion catapult and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. [[Roman technology]] is the engineering practice which supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years. The Roman Empire had the most advanced set of technology of their time, some of which may have been lost during the turbulent eras of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Roman technological feats of many different areas, like civil engineering, construction materials, transport technology, and some inventions such as the mechanical reaper went unmatched until the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===Maritime activity===
{{Main|Ancient maritime history}}

The history of ancient navigation began in earnest when men took to the sea in [[Plank (wood)|planked]] boats and ships propelled by [[sail]]s hung on [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], like the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Khufu ship]] from the mid-3rd millennium BC. According to the [[Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]], [[Necho II]] sent out an expedition of [[Phoenicians]], which in three years sailed from the [[Red Sea]] around [[Africa]] to the mouth of the [[Nile]]. Many current historians tend to believe Herodotus on this point, even though Herodotus himself was in disbelief that the Phoenicians had accomplished the act.

[[Hannu]] was an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[exploration|explorer]] (around 2750 BC) and the first explorer of whom there is any knowledge. He made the first recorded exploring expedition, writing his account of his exploration in stone. Hannu travelled along the Red Sea to [[Punt (region)|Punt]], and sailed to what is now part of eastern [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]]. He returned to Egypt with great treasures, including precious [[myrrh]], [[metals|metal]] and [[wood]].

===Warfare===
[[File:Ballista (PSF) vector.svg|left|thumb|Technical drawing of Roman [[Ballista]] mechanism. ]]
{{Main|Ancient warfare}}

[[Ancient warfare]] is war as conducted from the beginnings of recorded history to the end of the ancient period. In Europe, the end of antiquity is often equated with the fall of Rome in 476. In China, it can also be seen as ending in the 5th century, with the growing role of mounted warriors needed to counter the ever-growing threat from the north.

The difference between [[prehistoric warfare]] and ancient warfare is less one of technology than of organization. The development of the first [[city-state]]s, and then [[empire]]s, allowed warfare to change dramatically. Beginning in [[Mesopotamia]], states produced sufficient agricultural surplus that full-time ruling elites and military commanders could emerge. While the bulk of military forces were still farmers, the society could support having them campaigning rather than working the land for a portion of each year. Thus, organized armies developed for the first time.

These new armies could help states grow in size and became increasingly centralized, and the first empire, that of the [[Sumer]]ians, formed in Mesopotamia. Early ancient armies continued to primarily use [[bow and arrow|bows]] and [[spear]]s, the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting. Early armies in [[Egypt]] and [[China]] followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears.

===Artwork and music===
{{Ancient art history}}

{{Main|Ancient art history|Ancient music|Ancient art}}

[[Ancient music]] is music that developed in literate cultures, replacing prehistoric music. Ancient music refers to the various musical systems that were developed across various geographical regions such as Persia, India, China, Greece, Rome, Egypt and Mesopotamia (see [[music of Mesopotamia]], [[music of ancient Greece]], [[music of ancient Rome]], [[music of Iran]]). Ancient music is designated by the characterization of the basic audible tones and scales. It may have been transmitted through oral or written systems. [[Ancient art|Arts of the ancient world]] refers to the many types of art that were in the cultures of ancient societies, such as those of ancient China, Egypt, Greece, India, Persia, Mesopotamia and Rome.

The [[Ancient Near East]] is considered the [[cradle of civilization]]. It was the first to practice intensive year-round [[agriculture]]; created the first [[history of writing|coherent writing system]], invented the [[potter's wheel]] and then the vehicular- and mill [[wheel]], created the first [[centralized government]]s, [[law code]]s and [[empire]]s, as well as introducing [[social stratification]], [[slavery]] and organized [[warfare]], and it laid the foundation for the fields of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]].

====Mesopotamia====
{{further|Mesopotamia|History of Iraq}}

[[Mesopotamia]] is the site of some of the earliest known [[civilization]]s in the world. Early settlement of the alluvial plain lasted from the [[Ubaid period]] (late 6th millennium BC) through the [[Uruk period]] (4th millennium BC) and the Dynastic periods (3rd millennium BC) until the rise of [[Babylon]] in the early 2nd millennium BC. The surplus of storable foodstuffs created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating after crops and herds. It also allowed for a much greater population density, and in turn required an extensive labor force and [[division of labor]]. This organization led to the necessity of record keeping and the development of [[history of writing|writing]] (c. 3500 BC).

[[Babylonia]] was an [[Amorite]] state in lower [[Mesopotamia]] (modern southern [[Iraq]]), with Babylon as its capital. Babylonia emerged when [[Hammurabi]] (fl. c. 1728–1686 BC, according to the [[short chronology]]) created an empire out of the territories of the former kingdoms of [[Sumer]] and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]. The Amorites being [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]], Babylonia adopted the written [[Akkadian language]] for official use; they retained the [[Sumerian language]] for religious use, which by that time was no longer a spoken language. The Akkadian and Sumerian cultures played a major role in later Babylonian culture, and the region would remain an important cultural center, even under outside rule. The earliest mention of the city of [[Babylon]] can be found in a tablet from the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]], dating back to the 23rd century BC.

The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], or [[Chaldea]], was Babylonia under the rule of the 11th ("Chaldean") dynasty, from the revolt of [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC until the invasion of [[Cyrus the Great]] in 539 BC. Notably, it included the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], who conquered the [[Kingdom of Judah]] and [[Jerusalem]].

Akkad was a city and its surrounding region in central Mesopotamia. Akkad also became the capital of the [[Akkadian Empire]].<ref name="WebsterNinthNewCollege">Mish, Frederick C., Editor in Chief. "Akkad." ''[[Webster's Dictionary#The Collegiate Dictionary|Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary]]''. 9th ed. Springfield, MA: [[Merriam-Webster]] Inc., 1985. {{ISBN|978-0-87779-508-7|978-0-87779-509-4}} (indexed), and {{ISBN|978-0-87779-510-0}} (deluxe).</ref> The city was probably situated on the west bank of the [[Euphrates]], between [[Sippar]] and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] (in present-day Iraq, about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of the center of [[Baghdad]]). Despite an extensive search, the precise site has never been found. Akkad reached the height of its power between the 24th and 22nd centuries BC, following the conquests of king Sargon of Akkad. Because of the policies of the Akkadian Empire toward linguistic assimilation, Akkad also gave its name to the predominant Semitic dialect: the Akkadian language, reflecting use of ''akkadû'' ("in the language of Akkad") in the Old Babylonian period to denote the Semitic version of a Sumerian text.

[[Assyria]] was originally (in the [[Middle Bronze Age]]) a region on the Upper [[Tigris]], named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[Assur]]. Later, as a nation and empire that came to control all of the [[Fertile Crescent]], [[Egypt]] and much of [[Anatolia]], the term "Assyria proper" referred to roughly the northern half of Mesopotamia (the southern half being Babylonia), with [[Nineveh]] as its capital. The Assyrian kings controlled a large kingdom at three different times in history. These are called the ''Old'' (20th to 15th centuries BC), ''Middle'' (15th to 10th centuries BC), and ''[[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]]'' (911–612 BC) kingdoms, or periods, of which the last is the most well known and best documented.

The [[Medes]] were an [[Ancient Iranian peoples|ancient Iranian people]]. They had established their own empire by the 6th century BC, having defeated the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] with the [[Chaldea]]ns. They overthrew [[Urartu]] later on as well. The Medes are credited with the foundation of the first Iranian empire, the largest of its day until [[Cyrus the Great]] established a unified Iranian empire of the Medes and [[Persian people|Persian]], often referred to as the [[Achaemenid Empire]], by defeating his grandfather and overlord, [[Astyages]] the king of Media.[[File:Achaemenid Empire at its greatest extent according to Oxford Atlas of World History 2002.jpg|thumb|533x533px|The [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]] at its greatest extent, c. 500 BC|alt=|center]]The [[Achaemenid Empire]] was the largest and most significant of the [[Persian Empire]]s, and followed the [[Median Empire]] as the second great empire of the Iranians. It is noted in western history as the foe of the [[Greek city states]] in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], for freeing the [[Israelites]] from their [[Babylonian captivity]], for its successful model of a centralized bureaucratic administration, the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] (one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]), and for instituting [[Aramaic]] as the empire's [[official language]]. Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, Persian influence upon the language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law and government of nations around the world lasts to this day. At the height of its power, the Achaemenid dynasty encompassed approximately 8.0&nbsp;million square kilometers, held the greatest percentage of world population to date, stretched three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa) and was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.

[[Parthia]] was an Iranian civilization situated in the northeastern part of modern Iran. Their power was based on a combination of the guerrilla warfare of a mounted nomadic tribe, with organizational skills to build and administer a vast empire – even though it never matched in power and extent the Persian empires that preceded and followed it. The [[Parthian Empire]] was led by the Arsacid dynasty, which reunited and ruled over significant portions of the [[Near East]] and beyond, after defeating and disposing the Hellenistic [[Seleucid Empire]], beginning in the late 3rd century BC. It was the third native dynasty of ancient Iran (after the [[Medes|Median]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] dynasties). Parthia had many wars with the [[Roman Republic]] (and subsequently the [[Roman Empire]]), which marked the start of what would be over 700 years of frequent [[Roman-Persian Wars]].

The [[Sassanid Empire]], lasting the length of the [[Late Antiquity]] period, is considered to be one of Iran's most important and influential historical periods.

====Armenia====
{{Main|History of Armenia}}
[[File:Maps of the Armenian Empire of Tigranes.gif|thumb|Largest expansion of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] under [[Tigranes the Great]]]]
The early history of the [[Hittite empire]] is known through tablets that may first have been written in the 17th century BC but survived only as copies made in the 14th and 13th centuries BC. These tablets, known collectively as the [[Anitta]] text,<ref>ed. [[StBoT]] 18</ref> begin by telling how [[Pithana]] the king of [[Kussara]] or Kussar (a small [[city-state]] yet to be identified by archaeologists) conquered the neighbouring city of [[Neša]] ([[Kanesh]]). However, the real subject of these tablets is [[Pithana]]'s son [[Anitta]], who conquered several neighbouring cities, including [[Hattusa]] and [[Zalpuwa]] ([[Zalpa]]).

Assyrian inscriptions of [[Shalmaneser I]] (c. 1270 BC) first mention ''[[Urartu|Uruartri]]'' as one of the states of [[Nairi (people)|Nairi]] – a loose confederation of small kingdoms and tribal states in the [[Armenian Highland]] from the 13th to 11th centuries BC. Uruartri itself was in the region around [[Lake Van]]. The Nairi states were repeatedly subjected to attacks by the Assyrians, especially under Tukulti-Ninurta I (c. 1240 BC), [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (c. 1100 BC), Ashur-bel-kala (c. 1070 BC), [[Adad-nirari II]] (c. 900), [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (c. 890), and [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883–859 BC).

The [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] was an independent kingdom from 321 BC to 428 AD, and a client state of the Roman and Persian empires until 428. Between 95 and 55 BC under the rule of [[Tigranes the Great|King Tigranes the Great]], the kingdom of Armenia became a large and powerful empire stretching from the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]s. During this short time it was considered to be the most powerful state in the Roman East.<ref>''Time Almanac'', p. 724 by Editors of Time Magazine</ref><ref>''The New Review''. p. 208 edited by Archibald Grove, William Ernest Henley</ref>

Israel had emerged by the middle of the 9th century BC, when the Assyrian king [[Shalmaneser III]] names "[[Ahab]] the Israelite" among his enemies at the [[battle of Qarqar]] (853). Judah emerged somewhat later than Israel, probably during the 9th century BC, but the subject is one of considerable controversy.<ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Grabbe|editor-first=Lester L.|title=Israel in Transition: From Late Bronze II to Iron IIa (c. 1250–850 B.C.E.)|publisher=T&T Clark International|year=2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tR0Qpz2zRogC|isbn=978-0-567-02726-9|pages=225–226}}</ref> Israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding [[neo-Assyrian empire]], which first split its territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital, Samaria (722). A series of campaigns by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] between 597 and 582 led to the destruction of Judah.

Followed by the fall of Babylon to the [[Persian empire]], Jews were allowed, by [[Cyrus the Great]], to [[Return to Zion|return to Judea]]. The [[Hasmonean Kingdom]] (followed by the [[Maccabean revolt]]) had existed during the Hellenistic period and then the [[Herodian kingdom]] during the Roman period.

====Others====
{{Main|Pre-Islamic Arabia|Ancient history of Yemen}}

The history of [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] before the rise of [[Islam]] in the 630s is not known in great detail. Archaeological exploration in the [[Arabian peninsula]] has been sparse; indigenous written sources are limited to the many inscriptions and coins from southern Arabia. Existing material consists primarily of written sources from other traditions (such as [[Egypt]]ians, [[Greece|Greeks]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], etc.) and [[oral tradition]]s later recorded by Islamic scholars. Many small kingdoms prospered from Red sea and [[Indian Ocean trade]]. Major kingdoms included the [[Sabaeans]], [[Kingdom of Awsan|Awsan]], [[Lakhmids|Lahkimid]] [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyar]] and the [[Nabataeans|Nabateans]]. Arab kingdoms are occasionally mentioned in the Hebrew [[Old Testament]] under the name of [[Edom]].
Though the [[Ugarit]]ic site is thought to have been inhabited earlier, [[Neolithic]] Ugarit was already important enough to be fortified with a wall early on. The first written evidence mentioning the city comes from the nearby city of [[Ebla]], c. 1800 BC. [[Ugarit]] passed into the sphere of influence of Egypt, which deeply influenced its art. On the Mediterranean coast of modern-day Israel, Palestine and Lebanon, Canaanite peoples became wealth through trade inspiring Phoenicians.

[[Phoenicia]] was an ancient civilization centered in the north of ancient [[Canaan]], with its heartland along the coastal regions of modern-day [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Israel]]. Phoenician civilization was an enterprising [[thalassocracy|maritime trading culture]] that spread across the [[Mediterranean]] between the period of 1550 to 300 BC. One Phoenician colony, [[Carthage]], became a powerful nation in its own right.

==== Carthage ====

{{Main|Carthage}}
[[Carthage]] was founded in 814 BC by [[Phoenicia]]n settlers from the city of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], bringing with them the [[tutelary deity|city-god]] [[Melqart]].<ref>As recounted by Timaeus, FrGrH 566, fr. 60. Archaeological attestation for so early a date is still wanting, though recent discoveries in situ may point nearly as far back in time.</ref> [[Ancient Carthage]] was an informal [[hegemony]] of [[Phoenicia]]n [[city-state]]s throughout North Africa and modern [[Spain]] from 575 BC until 146 BC. It was more or less under the control of the city-state of [[Carthage]] after the fall of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] to [[Babylonia]]n forces. At the height of the city's influence, its empire included most of the western Mediterranean. The empire was in a constant state of struggle with the [[Roman Republic]], which led to a series of conflicts known as the [[Punic Wars]]. After the third and [[Third Punic War|final Punic War]], Carthage was destroyed then occupied by Roman forces. Nearly all of the territory held by Carthage fell into Roman hands.

==== Egypt ====
{{Main|Ancient Egypt|Outline of ancient Egypt}}

[[File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Khafre's Pyramid]] ([[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th dynasty]]) and [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] (c. 2500 BC or perhaps earlier)|alt=|left]] [[Ancient Egypt]] was a long-lived [[civilization]] geographically located in north-eastern [[Africa]]. It was concentrated along the middle to lower reaches of the [[Nile River]] reaching its greatest extension during the 2nd millennium [[Before Christ|BC]], which is referred to as the [[New Kingdom]] period. It reached broadly from the [[Nile Delta]] in the north, as far south as [[Jebel Barkal]] at the [[Fourth Cataract]] of the Nile. Extensions to the geographical range of ancient Egyptian civilization included, at different times, areas of the southern [[Levant]], the Eastern Desert and the [[Red Sea]] coastline, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]] (focused on the several [[oasis|oases]]).

Ancient Egypt developed over at least three and a half [[millennia]]. It began with the incipient unification of Nile Valley polities around 3500 BC and is conventionally thought to have ended in 30 BC when the early [[Roman Empire]] conquered and absorbed [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] as a province. (Though this last did not represent the first period of foreign domination, the Roman period was to witness a marked, if gradual transformation in the political and religious life of the Nile Valley, effectively marking the termination of independent civilisational development).

The civilization of ancient Egypt was based on a finely balanced control of natural and human resources, characterised primarily by controlled [[irrigation]] of the fertile Nile Valley; the mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions; the early development of an independent [[writing|writing system]] and [[literature]]; the organisation of collective projects; [[trade]] with surrounding regions in east / central Africa and the eastern [[Mediterranean]]; finally, [[military]] ventures that exhibited strong characteristics of imperial hegemony and territorial domination of neighbouring cultures at different periods. Motivating and organizing these activities were a socio-political and economic [[elite]] that achieved social consensus by means of an elaborate system of [[religion|religious belief]] under the figure of a (semi)-divine ruler (usually male) from a succession of ruling [[dynasty|dynasties]] and which related to the larger world by means of [[polytheism|polytheistic beliefs]].

==== Nubia ====
[[File:Rulers of Kush, Kerma Museum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pharaoh]]s of Nubia]]

The [[Kushite]] civilization, which is also known as Nubia, was formed before a period of Egyptian incursion into the area. The first cultures arose in what is now [[Sudan]] before the time of a unified [[Egypt]], and the most widespread culture is known as the [[Kerma culture|Kerma civilization]]. Egyptians referred to Nubia as "Ta-Seti," or "The Land of the Bow," since the Nubians were known to be expert archers. The two civilization shared an abundance of peaceful cultural interchange and cooperation, including mixed marriages and even the same gods. In the New Kingdom, Nubians became indistinguishable in the archaeological record from Egyptians. The Kingdom of Kush survived longer than that of Egypt and at its greatest extent Nubia ruled over Egypt (under the leadership of king [[Piye]]), and controlled Egypt during the 8th century BC as the [[Kushite Empire|25th Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientsudan.org/history_06_nubconegypt.htm|title=Ancient Sudan~ Nubia: History: The Kushite Conquest of Egypt|work=ancientsudan.org}}</ref>

It is also referred to as [[Aethiopia|Ethiopia]] in ancient Greek and Roman records. According to Josephus and other classical writers, the Kushite Empire covered all of Africa, and some parts of Asia and Europe at one time or another. In contrast to the Egyptians the Nubians had an unusually high number of ruling queens also known as [[Kandake]], especially during the golden age of the Meroitic Kingdom. Unlike the rest of the world at the time, women in Nubia exercised significant control in society.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kneller |first=Tara L. |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Role_Women.html |title=Role of Women in Nubia [Kneller] |website=africa.upenn.edu |access-date=2018-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915201333/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Role_Women.html |archive-date=2018-09-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Kushites are also famous for having buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves. The Kushites also built burial mounds and pyramids, and shared some of the same gods worshipped in Egypt, especially [[Amun|Amon]] and [[Isis]].[[File:Relief of Hatshepsut's expedition to the Land of Punt by Σταύρος.jpg|thumb|Egyptian soldiers from Hatshepsut's expedition to the Land of Punt as depicted from her temple at [[Deir el-Bahri]].|alt=|left]]

[[Macrobia]] was an ancient kingdom situated in the Horn of Africa (present day Somalia) it is mentioned in the 5th century BC. According to Herodotus' account, the [[Persian Emperor]] [[Cambyses II]] upon his [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|conquest of Egypt]] (525 BC) sent ambassadors to Macrobia, bringing luxury gifts for the Macrobian king  to entice his submission. The Macrobian ruler, who was elected based at least in part on stature, replied instead with a challenge for his  Persian counterpart in the form of an unstrung [[Bow and arrow|bow]]: if the Persians could manage to string it, they would have the right to invade his country; but until then, they should thank the gods that the Macrobians never decided to invade their empire .<ref>Wheeler pg 526</ref> <ref name="Kitto2">John Kitto, James Taylor, ''The popular cyclopædia of Biblical literature: condensed from the larger work'', (Gould and Lincoln: 1856), p.302.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=White|first=John S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PuFRDwAAQBAJ&q=Macrobians+unstrung+bow&pg=PA115|title=The Boys ́ and Girls ́ Herodotus|date=2018-04-05|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|isbn=978-3-7326-5420-8|language=en}}</ref>

After the collapse of Macrobia, several wealthy ancient city-states, such as [[Opone]], [[Essina]], [[Sarapion]], [[Nikon (Somalia)|Nikon]], [[Malao (ancient)|Malao]], [[Damo, Somalia|Damo]] and [[Mosylon]] near [[Cape Guardafui]] would emerge from the 1st millennium BC–500 AD to compete with the [[Sabaeans]], [[Parthia]]ns and [[Aksumite Empire|Axumites]] for the wealthy [[South Asia|Indo]]-[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] trade and flourished along the Somali coast. They developed a lucrative trading network under a region collectively known in the Peripilus of the Erythraean Sea as [[Barbaria (East Africa)|Barbaria]] <ref>Oman in history By Peter Vine Page 324</ref>

The [[Nok culture]] appeared in Nigeria around 1000 BC and mysteriously vanished around 200 AD. The civilization's social system is thought to have been highly advanced. The Nok civilization was considered to be the earliest sub-Saharan producer of life-sized Terracotta which have been discovered by archaeologists.<ref name="archaeology">''Shaw, Thurstan, Nigeria: Its Archaeology and early history.

The provinces of Sindh and Panjab were said to be the richest ''satraps'' of the Persian Empire and contributed many soldiers to various Persian expeditions. It is known that an ''Indian'' contingent fought in Xerxes' army on his expedition to Greece. Herodotus mentions that the Indus satrapy supplied cavalry and chariots to the Persian army. He also mentions that the Indus people were clad in armaments made of cotton, carried bows and arrows of cane covered with iron. Herodotus states that in 517 BC Darius sent an expedition under Scylax to explore the Indus. Under Persian rule, much irrigation and commerce flourished within the vast territory of the empire. The Persian empire was followed by the invasion of the Greeks under [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s army. Since Alexander was determined to reach the easternmost limits of the Persian Empire he could not resist the temptation to conquer India (i.e. the Punjab region), which at this time was parcelled out into small chieftain-ships, who were feudatories of the Persian Empire. Alexander amalgamated the region into the expanding Hellenic empire.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} The ''[[Rigveda]]'', in [[Sanskrit]], goes back to about 1500 BC.

The largest of these nations were [[Magadha]], [[Kosala]], [[Kuru (India)|Kuru]] and [[Gandhara]]. Notably, the great epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] are rooted in this classical period.

Amongst the sixteen Mahajanapadas, the kingdom of [[Magadha]] rose to prominence under a number of dynasties that peaked in power under the reign of [[Ashoka]] [[Maurya]] one of India's most legendary and famous emperors. During the reign of [[Ashoka]], the four dynasties of [[Chola dynasty|Chola]], [[Chera dynasty|Chera]], and [[Pandya]] were ruling in the South, while the King [[Devanampiya Tissa]] was controlling the Anuradhapura Kingdom (now [[Sri Lanka]]).

The period between AD 320–550 is known as the Classical Age, when most of [[North India]] was reunited under the [[Gupta Empire]] (c. AD 320–550). This was a period of relative peace, law and order, and extensive achievements in religion, education, mathematics, arts, Sanskrit literature and drama. Grammar, composition, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, medicine, and [[astronomy]] became increasingly specialized and reached an advanced level. The Gupta Empire was weakened and ultimately ruined by the raids of [[Huna people|Hunas]] (a branch of the [[Hephthalite]]s emanating from Central Asia). Under [[Harsha]] (r. 606–47), North India was reunited briefly.

The educated speech at that time was [[Sanskrit]], while the dialects of the general population of northern India were referred to as [[Prakrit]]s. The South Indian [[Malabar Coast]] and the [[Tamil people]] of the [[Sangam period|Sangam]] age traded with the [[Graeco-Roman]] world. They were in contact with the [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Greeks]], [[Arabs]], [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]], [[Jew]]s, and the [[China|Chinese]].<ref name="Blandstrom">(Bjorn Landstrom, 1964; Miller, J.

[[File:Shang dynasty inscribed scapula.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Oracle bone script]] from the [[Shang dynasty|Shang Dynasty]].]]
Chinese Civilization that emerged within the [[Yellow River|Yellow River Valley]] is one of five original civilizations in the world. Prior to the formation of civilization neolithic cultures such as the [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] and [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] dating to 5,000 BC lived in wall cities and likely had social organizations of complex chiefdoms. The practice of rice cultivation was vital to settled life in China.

Chinese history records such as the ''Records of the Grand Historian'' claim of the existence of the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]]. However, as the Xia left behind no written record themselves, the time and location of their civilization has been in doubt. Some historians believe that the neolithic Erlitou culture (1900–1600 BC) is the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]] but whether archaeological discoveries in the area Xia Dynasty or a different culture remains in doubt.

The early part of the [[Shang dynasty]] described in traditional histories (c. 1600–1300 BC) is commonly identified with archaeological finds at [[Erligang culture|Erligang]], [[Zhengzhou]] and [[Yanshi]], south of the [[Yellow River]] in modern-day [[Henan]] province.
The last capital of the Shang (c. 1300–1046 BC) at [[Anyang]] (also in Henan) has been directly confirmed by the discovery there of the earliest Chinese texts, inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animals&nbsp;– the so-called "[[oracle bones]]".

Towards the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Shang were overrun by the [[Zhou dynasty]] from the [[Wei River]] valley to the west. The death of [[King Wu of Zhou]] soon after the conquest triggered a succession crisis and civil war that was suppressed by Wu's brother, the [[Duke of Zhou]], acting as regent. The Zhou rulers at this time invoked the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize their rule, a concept that would be influential for almost every successive dynasty. The Zhou initially established their capital in the west near modern [[Xi'an]], near the Yellow River, but they would preside over a series of expansions into the [[Yangtze River]] valley. This would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in Chinese history.
[[File:01 terracottawarriorsgroup.jpg|left|thumb|[[Terracotta Army|Terracotta Warriors]] from the time of [[Qin Shi Huang]]]]
In the 8th century BC, power became decentralized during the [[Spring and Autumn period]], named after the influential ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''. In this period, local military leaders used by the Zhou began to assert their power and vie for hegemony. The situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest, such as the [[Quanrong]], forcing the Zhou to move their capital east to [[Luoyang]]. This marks the second large phase of the Zhou dynasty: the Eastern Zhou. In each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose, local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the Zhou kings in name only. Local leaders for instance started using royal titles for themselves. The [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period, and such influential intellectual movements as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Mohism]] were founded, partly in response to the changing political world. The Spring and Autumn period is marked by a falling apart of the central Zhou power. China now consisted of hundreds of states, some only as large as a village with a fort.

After further political consolidation, seven prominent states remained by the end of the 5th century BC, and the years in which these few states battled each other is known as the [[Warring States period]]. Though there remained a nominal [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] king until 256 BC, he was largely a figurehead and held little power. As neighboring territories of these warring states, including areas of modern [[Sichuan]] and [[Liaoning]], were annexed, they were governed under the new local administrative system of [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] and [[prefecture]]. This system had been in use since the Spring and Autumn period and parts can still be seen in the modern system of [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|Sheng and Xian]] (province and county). The final expansion in this period began during the reign of Ying Zheng, the king of Qin. His unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of [[Zhejiang]], [[Fujian]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] in 214 BC enabled him to proclaim himself the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] (Qin Shi Huangdi).[[File:Han foreign relations CE 2.jpg|alt=Han Dynasty Map. 1 AD |center|thumb|500x500px|The Chinese [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] dominated the East Asia region at the beginning of the first millennium AD ]]

Qin Shi Huangdi ruled the unified China directly with absolute power. In contrast to the decentralized and feudal rule of earlier dynasties the Qin set up a number of 'commandries' around the country which answered directly to the emperor. Nationwide the philosophy of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]] was enforced and publications promoting rival ideas such as Confucianism were prohibited. In his reign unified China created the first continuous [[Great Wall]] with the use of forced labor. [[Qin's campaign against the Yue tribes|Invasions]] were launched southward to annex Vietnam.  After the emperor's death rebels rose against the Qin's brutal reign in new civil wars. Ultimately the Han Dynasty arose and ruled China for over four centuries in what accounted for a long period in prosperity, with a brief interruption by the [[Xin dynasty|Xin Dynasty]].  The Han Dynasty played a great role in developing the Silk Road which would transfer wealth and ideas for millennia, and also invented paper. Though the Han enjoyed great military and economic success it was strained by the rise of aristocrats who disobeyed the central government. Public frustration provoked the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] – though a failure it nonetheless accelerated the empire's downfall. After 208 AD the Han Dynasty broke up into [[Three Kingdoms period|rival kingdoms]]. China would remain divided until 581 under the Sui Dynasty, during the era of division Buddhism would be introduced to China for the first time.

The East Asian nations adjacent to China were all profoundly influenced by their interactions with [[East Asian cultural sphere|Chinese civilization]]. Mongolia, Korea and Vietnam often were at war with, [[Imperial Chinese Tributary System|paid tribute]] to, or annexed by Imperial Chinese states. [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] Japan, though not occupied, had interactions with Imperial China that shaped its cultural development.

Mongolia in ancient times was nomadic. The ethnicities, cultures and languages in modern Mongolian territory were fluid and changed frequently. The use of horses to herd and migrate started during the Iron Age. These were [[Tengriism|Tengriist]] horse-riding pastoral kingdoms that had close contact with the sedentary agrarian Chinese. To appease the aggressive nomads, local Chinese rulers often gave important hostages and arranged marriages. In 208 BC the Xiongnu emperor [[Modu Chanyu]], in his first major military campaign, defeated the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], who split into the new tribes [[Xianbei]] and [[Wuhuan]]. The [[Xiongnu]] were the largest nomadic enemies of the Han Dynasty fighting [[Han–Xiongnu War|wars]] for over three centuries with the Han Dynasty before dissolving. Afterwards the Xianbei returned to rule the Steppe north of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]. The titles of Khangan and Khan come from the [[Xianbei]].

According to the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] by the Chinese historian [[Sima Qian]], [[Wiman Joseon]] of Korea was founded by General [[Wei Man|Wiman]] from China who originally served but usurped the throne of [[Gojoseon]] (the name of ancient Korea) in 194 BC.<ref>[[Records of the Grand Historian]] Vol.55 Korea 史記 朝鮮列伝第五十五 "朝鮮王満者、故燕人也"</ref> In 108 BC, the [[Han dynasty]] of China destroyed Wiman Joseon and established four commanderies on the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies were shortly lost but the [[Lelang commandery]] remained on the northwestern Korean peninsula for about 400 years. The [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] of [[Baekje]], [[Goguryeo]] and [[Silla]] emerged after the fall of Gojoseon and eventually expelled the Chinese. The Three Kingdoms competed with each other both economically and militarily; Goguryeo and Baekje were the main players for much of the Three Kingdoms era and controlled most of the Korean peninsula. At times more powerful than neighboring Chinese dynasties, Goguryeo (where the name "Korea" comes from) was a regional power that defeated [[Goguryeo-Sui Wars|massive invasions]] by the [[Sui dynasty]] multiple times.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm#The%20Ko%20Choson|title=Korea's History (Ko-Choson, Three Kingdoms, Parhae Kingdom, Unified Shilla, Koryo Dynasty, Colonial Period, Independence Struggle, Provisional Government of Korea, Independence Army, Republic of Korea,)|publisher=Asianinfo.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128065300/http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history.htm|archive-date=28 January 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=2010-01-09}}</ref> Goguryeo and Baekje were eventually destroyed by a [[Tang dynasty]] and Silla alliance. Silla then drove out the Tang dynasty in 676 to control most of the Korean peninsula undisputed.

In Vietnam, archaeologists have pointed to the [[Phùng Nguyên culture]] as the beginning of the Vietnamese identity from around 2000 BC which engaged in early bronze smelting.
Eight hundred years later the [[Dong Son culture|Đông Sơn]] culture arose a prehistoric [[Bronze Age]] culture that was centered at the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] Valley of northern [[Vietnam]]. Large scale rice cultivation began around 1200 BC, onward. Pottery and Bamboo working became common in this time period as well as widespread trade and navigation on inland rivers. During this time Vietnam was allegedly ruled by the semi-mythical [[Hong Bang Dynasty]], the last Hong King was deposed by a Chinese Qin Invasion, in turn however a Chinese General declared independence and founded the [[Nanyue]] combining Chinese and Vietnamese traditions.

[[Nanyue|Nan Yue]], after a century of political maneuvers the country was annexed by the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] in 111 B.C Originally the Han were lenient governors and attempted to integrate the Vietnamese upper class into Chinese Patriarchy. However Chinese abuse of certain vassals led to the famous but futile revolt of the [[Trưng Sisters|Trung Sisters]]. Afterwards Chinese authorities ruled Vietnam directly and attempted to push Chinese culture upon the populace though peasants continued to speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Vietnam would be under Chinese domination for a millennium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/4.htm|title=Vietnam – The Chinese Millennium|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref> Meanwhile, South Vietnam held a completely different identity, populated mainly by [[Chams|Cham]] People. While Northern Vietnam came under Chinese Domination, the [[Champa|Champa Kingdom]] became closer to Indian kingdoms through trade and embraced [[Hinduism in Vietnam|Hinduism]].

[[History of Japan|Japan]] first appeared in written records in AD 57 with the following mention in China's ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'':<ref>後漢書, 會稽海外有東鯷人 分爲二十餘國</ref> "Across the ocean from [[Luoyang]] are the people of [[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]. Formed from more than one hundred tribes, they come and pay tribute frequently. The ''[[Book of Wei]]'', written in the 3rd century, noted the country was the unification of some 30 small tribes or states and ruled by a [[shaman]] queen named [[Himiko]] of [[Yamataikoku]]. During the [[Han dynasty]] and [[Cao Wei|Wei dynasty]], Chinese travelers to [[Kyūshū]] recorded its inhabitants and claimed that they were the descendants of the Grand Count (Tàibó) of the [[Wu (state)|Wu]]. The inhabitants also show traits of the pre-sinicized Wu people with tattooing, teeth-pulling and baby-carrying. The ''Book of Wei'' records the physical descriptions which are similar to ones on ''[[Haniwa]]'' statues, such men with braided hair, tattooing and women wearing large, single-piece clothing. Power was often decentralized until the creation of its first constitution in AD 600.

In [[pre-Columbian]] times, several large, centralized ancient civilizations developed in the [[Western Hemisphere]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C The Encyclopedia of world history] By Peter N. Stearns, William Leonard Langer. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C&pg=PA21 p. 21]. "Ancient and Classical Periods; 3500 BCE – 500 BCE."{{Dead link|date=March 2017}}</ref> both in [[Mesoamerica]] and western [[South America]]. Beyond these areas, the use of agriculture expanded East of the Andes Mountains in South America particularly with the [[Marajoara culture]], and in the continental United States with the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell culture]].

====Andean civilizations====
The Central [[Andes]] in [[South America]] was one of the original areas of civilization, spanning 4,500 years from the [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte chico]] otherwise known as Caral-Supe in 3500 BC to the final the [[Inca Empire]] after which the entire continent was transformed by the 16th century [[Columbian Exchange]]. Until the late 20th century, details about Norte Chico were unclear and often confused with later cultures such as the [[Chavín culture|Chavin]].

Ancient Andean Civilization began with the rise or organized fishing communities from 3,500 BC onwards. Along with a sophisticated maritime society came the construction of large monuments, which likely existed as community centers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fieldmuseum.org/science/research/area/cultural-heritage/cultural-heritage-surveys/proyecto-arqueologico-norte|title=Proyecto Arqueológico Norte Chico|last=jseagard|date=2011-02-02|website=Field Museum|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200310032308/https://www.fieldmuseum.org/science/research/area/cultural-heritage/cultural-heritage-surveys/proyecto-arqueologico-norte|archive-date=2020-03-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> The large ceremonial structures predated the Measoamerican Olmecs by 2,000 years making Norte Chico the first civilization in the western hemisphere.

[[File:Lascar Avenue of the Dead and the Pyramid of the Sun in the background (4566574277).jpg|thumb|The ruins of [[Mesoamerica]]n city [[Teotihuacan]]]]
Mesoamerican ancient civilizations included the [[Olmec]]s and [[Maya civilization|Mayans]]. Between 2000 and 300 BC, complex cultures began to form and many matured into advanced [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations such as the: Olmec, [[Izapa]], [[Teotihuacan]], Maya, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]], Which flourished for nearly 4,000 years before the first contact with Europeans. These civilizations' progress included pyramid-temples, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and theology.

The Zapotec emerged around 1500 years BC. They left behind the great city [[Monte Alban]]. Their writing system had been thought to have influenced the Olmecs but, with recent evidence, the Olmec may have been the first civilization in the area to develop a true writing system independently. At the present time, there is some debate as to whether or not Olmec symbols, dated to 650 BC, are actually a form of writing preceding the oldest Zapotec writing dated to about 500 BC.<ref>[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20021207/fob1.asp Script Delivery: New World writing takes disputed turn] ''Science News'' December 7th, 2002; Vol.162 #23</ref>

==== Northern America ====

Organized societies, in the ancient United States or Canada, were often mound builder civilizations. One of the most significant of these was the [[Poverty Point culture|Poverty Point Culture]] that existed in the U.S state of Louisiana, and was responsible for the creation of over 100 mound sites. The Mississippi River was a core area in the development of long-distance trade and culture. Following Poverty Point, successive complex cultures such as the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] emerged in the Southeastern United States in the [[Woodland period|Early Woodland period]].  Before 500 AD many mound builder societies, retained a hunter gatherer form of subsistence.

[[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] culture that is identifiably and certainly Etruscan developed in Italy in earnest by 900 BC approximately with the [[Iron Age]] [[Villanovan culture]], regarded as the oldest phase of Etruscan civilization.<ref>{{cite book|title =Gli etruschi tra VIII e VII secolo a.C. nel territorio di Castelfranco Emilia (MO) |author =Diana Neri |publisher =All'Insegna del Giglio |location =Firenze |year =2012 |language = it|chapter =1.1 Il periodo villanoviano nell’Emilia occidentale |page =9  |isbn =978-88-7814-533-7 |quote =Il termine “Villanoviano” è entrato nella letteratura archeologica quando, a metà dell ’800, il conte Gozzadini mise in luce le prime tombe ad incinerazione nella sua proprietà di Villanova di Castenaso, in località Caselle (BO).

The burial tombs, some of which had been fabulously decorated, promotes the idea of an aristocratic [[city-state]], with centralized power structures maintaining order and constructing public works, such as irrigation networks, roads, and town defenses.

[[Ancient Greece]] is the period in [[Greek history]] lasting for close to a millennium, until the rise of [[Christianity]]. It is considered by most historians to be the foundational culture of [[Western world|Western Civilization]]. Greek culture was a powerful influence in the [[Roman Empire]], which carried a version of it to many parts of [[Europe]].

The earliest known human settlements in Greece were on the island of [[Crete]], more than 9,000 years ago, though there is evidence of tool use on the island going back over 100,000 years.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/01/ancient-seafarers/|title=Hominids Went Out of Africa on Rafts|date=2010-01-08|journal=Wired|last1=News|first1=Bruce Bower}}</ref> The earliest evidence of a civilisation in ancient Greece is that of the [[Minoan civilisation|Minoans]] on Crete, dating as far back as 3600 BC. On the mainland, the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] civilisation rose to prominence around 1600 BC, superseded the Minoan civilisation on Crete, and lasted until about 1100 BC, leading to a period known as the [[Greek Dark Ages]].

The Archaic Period in Greece is generally considered to have lasted from around the eighth century BC to the invasion by Xerxes in 480 BC. This period saw the expansion of the Greek world around the Mediterranean, with the founding of Greek city-states as far afield as Sicily in the West and the Black sea in the East.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Boardman|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Hammond|editor2-first=N.G.L|title=The Cambridge Ancient History Volume III, Part 3: The Expansion of the Greek World, Eighth to Sixth Centuries B.C.|page=xiii|chapter=Preface|isbn=978-0-521-23447-4|year=1970}}</ref> Politically, the Archaic period in Greece saw the collapse of the power of the old aristocracies,<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|editor1-last=Boardman|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Hammond|editor2-first=N.G.L|title=The Cambridge Ancient History Volume III, Part 3: The Expansion of the Greek World, Eighth to Sixth Centuries B.C.|page=xv|chapter=Preface|isbn=978-0-521-23447-4|year=1970}}</ref> with democratic reforms in Athens and the development of Sparta's unique [[Spartan Constitution|constitution]]. The end of the Archaic period also saw the rise of Athens, which would come to be a dominant power in the Classical period, after the reforms of [[Solon]] and the tyranny of [[Pisistratus]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The Classical Greek world was dominated throughout the fifth century BC by the major powers of Athens and Sparta. Through the Delian League, Athens was able to convert Pan-hellenist sentiment and fear of the Persian threat into a powerful empire, and this, along with the conflict between Sparta and Athens culminating in the [[Peloponnesian war]], was the major political development of the first part of the Classical period.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Lewis|editor2-last=Boardman|editor3-last=Davies|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Ostwald|editor1-first=D.M.|editor2-first=John|editor3-first=J.K.|editor4-first=M.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History Volume V: The Fifth Century B.C.|chapter=preface|pages=xiii–xiv|isbn=978-0-521-23347-7}}</ref>

The period in Greek history from the death of [[Alexander the Great]] until the rise of the Roman empire and its conquest of Egypt in 30 BC is known as the [[Hellenistic period]]. The name derives from the Greek word ''Hellenistes'' ("the Greek speaking ones"), and describes the spread of Greek culture into the non-Greek world following the conquests of Alexander and the rise of his successors.

Following the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Battle of Corinth]] in 146 BC, Greece came under [[ancient Rome|Roman]] rule, ruled from the province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]. In 27 BC, Augustus organised the Greek peninsula into the province of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]]. Greece remained under Roman control until the [[Tetrarchy|break up]] of the Roman empire, in which it remained part of the Eastern Empire. Much of Greece remained under Byzantine control until the end of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]] in 1453 AD.{{Main|Ancient Rome}}[[File:RomanEmpire 117 recoloured 2.svg|center|thumb|Roman Empire 117 AD. The Senatorial provinces were acquired first under the [[Roman Republic]] and were under the [[Roman Senate]]'s control; the Imperial provinces were controlled directly by the Roman emperor. |500x500px]]<nowiki> </nowiki>[[Ancient Rome]] was a civilization that grew out of the city-state of Rome, originating as a small agricultural community founded on the Italian Peninsula in the 9th century BC. In its twelve centuries of existence, Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to an oligarchic republic to an increasingly autocratic empire.

Roman civilization is often grouped into "classical antiquity" with [[ancient Greece]], a civilization that inspired much of the [[culture of ancient Rome]]. Ancient Rome contributed greatly to the development of [[Roman law|law]], [[Roman military|war]], [[Roman art|art]], [[Roman literature|literature]], [[Roman architecture|architecture]], and [[Romance languages|language]] in the [[Western world]], and its [[history of Rome|history]] continues to have a major influence on the world today. The Roman civilization came to dominate Europe and the Mediterranean region through conquest and assimilation.

Throughout the territory under the control of ancient Rome, residential [[architecture]] ranged from very modest houses to [[Roman villa|country villas]]. A number of Roman founded cities had [[monument]]al structures. Many contained fountains with fresh drinking-water supplied by hundreds of kilometres of [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]], [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatres]], [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasiums]], [[thermae|bath complexes]] sometime with libraries and shops, marketplaces, and occasionally functional sewers. A number of factors led to the eventual [[decline of the Roman Empire]]. The western half of the empire, including [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]], and Italy, eventually broke into independent kingdoms in the 5th century; the Eastern Roman Empire, governed from [[Constantinople]], is referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]] after AD 476, the traditional date for the "fall of Rome" and subsequent onset of the [[post-classical age|Middle Ages]].

====Late Antiquity====
[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|center|thumb|400x400px|The [[Migration Period|Age of Migrations]] in Europe was deeply detrimental to the late [[Roman Empire]]. ]]
{{Main|Late Antiquity}}

The [[Roman Empire]] underwent considerable social, cultural and organizational change starting with reign of [[Diocletian]], who began the custom of splitting the Empire into [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves ruled by multiple emperors. Beginning with [[Constantine the Great]] the Empire was [[Christianization|Christianized]], and a new capital founded at [[Constantinople]]. [[Germanic migrations|Migrations]] of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes disrupted Roman rule from the late 4th century onwards, culminating in the eventual [[Decline of the Roman Empire|collapse of the Empire in the West]] in 476, replaced by the so-called [[Germanic monarchy|barbarian kingdoms]]. The resultant cultural fusion of [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and Christian traditions formed the cultural foundations of [[Europe]].

====Nomads and Iron Age Peoples====
{{Further|Anglo-Saxons|Celts|Viking|Norsemen|Viking Age|Barbarian}}
The Huns left practically no written records. There is no record of what happened between the time they left the [[Mongolian Plateau]] and arrived in Europe 150 years later. The last mention of the northern Xiongnu was their defeat by the Chinese in 151 at [[Lake Barkol]], after which they fled to the western steppe at [[Kangju]] (centered on the city of [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Turkistan]] in [[Kazakhstan]]). Chinese records between the 3rd and 4th centuries suggest that a small tribe called [[Yueban]], remnants of Northern Xiongnu, was distributed about the steppe of Kazakhstan.

The [[Huns|Hun-Xiongnu]] connection is controversial at best and is often disputed but is also not completely discredited.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wright | first=David Curtis | title=The history of China | year=2011 | publisher=Greenwood | location=Santa Barbara | isbn=978-0-313-37748-8 | edition=2nd|page=60}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The fall of the Roman Empire : a new history of Rome and the Barbarians|last=J.)|first=Heather, P.J.

The [[Celts]] were a diverse group of [[tribal societies]] in [[Iron Age Europe]]. [[Proto-Celtic]] culture formed in the [[Early Iron Age]] in [[Central Europe]] ([[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] period, named for the site in present-day Austria). By the later Iron Age ([[La Tène culture|La Tène]] period), Celts had expanded over wide range of lands: as far west as [[Ireland]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], as far east as [[Galatia]] (central [[Anatolia]]), and as far north as [[Scotland]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-209125/Turkey Britannica] (Turkey) People and Culture{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> By the early centuries AD, following the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Migration Period|Great Migrations]] of [[Germanic peoples]], Celtic culture had become

The term [[Late antiquity|Late Antiquity]] is the transitional centuries from Classical Antiquity to the Middle Ages in both mainland Europe and the Mediterranean world: generally from the end of the Roman Empire's [[Crisis of the Third Century|Crisis of the 3rd century]] (c. 284) to the Islamic conquests and the re-organization of the [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Heraclius]] that occurred in the seventh century. The beginning of the post-classical age (known as the [[Middle Ages]] for Europe)  following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] spanning roughly from A.D 500 to 1500. Aspects of continuity with the earlier classical period are discussed in greater detail under the heading "Late Antiquity".

There has been attempt by scholars to connect European Late Antiquity to other areas in Eurasia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Humphries|first=Mark|date=2017-02-01|title=Late Antiquity and World History: Challenging Conventional Narratives and Analyses|journal=Studies in Late Antiquity|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=8–37|doi=10.1525/sla.2017.1.1.8|issn=2470-6469|url=https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa30084/Download/0030084-16092016113558.pdf|access-date=2019-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102131637/https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa30084/Download/0030084-16092016113558.pdf|archive-date=2018-11-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> To an extent most centralized kingdoms within proximity to Steppe grasslands faced major challenges or in some cases complete destruction in the 5th–6th century in the case of nomadic invasions and political fragmentation. The [[Western Roman Empire]] in Europe and the [[Gupta Empire]] in India, and the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] in [[North China]] were overwhelmed by tribal invasions. Nomadic invasions along with worldwide natural climate change, the [[Plague of Justinian]] and the rise of proselytizing religions changed the face of the Old World. Still disconnected was the New World who also built complex societies but at a separate and different pace. By 500 the world era of [[Post-classical history]] had begun. 
Despite being placed in different eras of history in an academic view of world history, Ancient and Post Classical eras are linked with each other in the case of the Old World. Land and coastal trade routes, often went on similar or the same directions, and many of the inventions and religions which were birthed prior to 500 A.D such as Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism grew to be even more important for societies and individuals.
