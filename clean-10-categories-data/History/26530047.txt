{{other people||Baduarius (disambiguation)}}

'''Baduarius''' is a figure of 6th century [[Constantinople]], known only from a single inscription in an [[epitaph]].<ref name="PLRE165">Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 165</ref>

The inscription is written in the [[Greek language]], mentioning the glorious memory of Baduarius and Theodora. His title is rendered in [[Latin]] as "[[curator]] domus rerum Areobindi" (caretaker of the house of [[Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus|Areobindus]]). The wording suggests that said house was no longer owned by anyone called Areobindus. It was probably an estate having passed to "imperial ownership". Baduarius either being a caretaker in imperial service or someone granted ownership at some point.<ref name="PLRE165"/>

The Theodora mentioned in the inscription could be Baduarius' wife. There are theories identifying this man with [[Baduarius]], son-in-law of [[Justin II]] and [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]]. However, the only known wife of the other Baduarius is called "Arabia", not Theodora.<ref name="PLRE165"/>
