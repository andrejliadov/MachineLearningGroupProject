The '''legacy of the Indo-Greeks''' starts with the formal end of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] from the 1st century, as the Greek communities of central Asia and northwestern India lived under the control of the [[Kushan]] branch of the Yuezhi, apart from a short-lived invasion of the [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom]].<ref>"Though the Indo-Greek monarchies seem to have ended in the first century BC, the Greek presence in India and Bactria remained strong", McEvilley, p. 379.</ref> The Kushans founded the [[Kushan Empire]], which was to prosper for several centuries. In the south, the Greeks were under the rule of the [[Western Kshatrapas]].

It is unclear how much longer the Greeks managed to maintain a distinct presence in the Indian sub-continent.

'''Politics'''

The 36 Indo-Greek kings known through epigraphy or through their coins belong to the period between 180&nbsp;BC to AD10–20.<ref>Boppearachchi, "Monnaies Indo-Grecques".</ref> There are a few hints of a later Indo-Greek political presence in the Indian subcontinent.

[[Theodamas]], known from an inscription on a signet, may have been an Indo-Greek ruler in the [[Bajaur]] area in the 1st century AD.

In the 3rd century, the Scythian [[Western Satraps]] seem to have relied on Greeks, such as [[Yavanesvara]] ("Lord of the Greeks"), who may have been organized in more or less independent ''[[poleis]]''.<ref>McEvilley, p. 385.</ref>

Some sort of Greek political organization is thought to have existed in the first half of the 4th century after the rule of the [[Satavahanas]].<ref>[[David Pingree]], "The Yavanajataka of Sphujidhvaja", p4. Quotes in McEvilley, p. 385.</ref> This is also suggested by the [[Puranas]] (the [[Matsya Purana]], the [[Vayu Purana]], the [[Brahmanda Purana]], the [[Vishnu Purana]], the [[Bhagavata Purana]]) which give a list of the dynasties who ruled following the decline of the [[Satavahanas]]: this list includes 8 [[Yavana]] kings, thought to be some dynasty of Greek descent, although they are not otherwise known.<ref>Comments given in Rapson "Catalogue of the Indian coins in the British Museum. Andhras etc...", Rapson, p LXVIII:<br />
"These must, no doubt, belong to some dynasty of Greek descent, but it is impossible to determine which dynasty this could have been"<br />The full list, with comments, is given in Rapson "Catalogue of the Indian coins in the British Museum. Andhras etc...", Rapson, p LXVIII:
:* 7 other Andhras kings (called "Andhrabhrytias", or "Servant of the Andhras", probably the [[Chutus]] in the Western and Southern districts.
:* 10 [[Abhiras|Abhira]] kings, who ruled in the area of [[Nasik]].
:* 7 [[Gardabhilas|Gardabhila]] kings, who ruled in the area of [[Ujjain]]
:* 18 [[Saka]] kings, probably the [[Western Satraps]].
:* 8 [[Yavana]] kings, thought to be some dynasty of Greek descent.
:* 14 [[Tusaras|Tusara]] kings (also called Tuhkara, Tuskara), thought to be the [[Kushans]] (who are called "Turuska" in the Rajatarangini).
:* 13 [[Murundas|Murunda]] or Gurunda kings.

'''Cities'''

Some Greek cities seem to have remained intact under Parthian rule: [[Isidorus of Charax]] in his 1st century AD "Parthian stations" itinerary described "[[Alexandria of the Arachosians|Alexandropolis]], the metropolis of [[Arachosia]]" as being Greek:
{{quote|"Beyond is Arachosia (Old Persian Hara[h]uvati, Avestan Haraxvaiti)). And the Parthians call this White India; there are the city of Biyt and the city of Pharsana and the city of Chorochoad (Haraxvat) and the city of Demetrias; then Alexandropolis, the metropolis of Arachosia; it is Greek, and by it flows the river Arachotus (Harahvati). As far as this place the land is under the rule of the Parthians."|"Parthians stations", 1st century AD. Original text in paragraph 19 of [http://www.parthia.com/doc/parthian_stations.htm#PARTHIAN_STATIONS Parthian stations]}}
Also, the city of [[Alexandria Bucephalus]] on the [[Jhelum River]] is still mentioned in the 1st century [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], as well as in the Roman [[Peutinger Table]].

'''Military'''

Greek mercenary soldiers from northwestern India are mentioned in the accounts of the [[Pandyan Kingdom]] in [[Madurai]], and described in admiring terms: "The valiant-eyed Yavanas, whose bodies were strong and of terrible aspect".<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=History of Indian Theatre|author1=Pande, L.V.|author2=Varadpande, M.L.|date=1987|volume=1|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=9788170172215|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SyxOHOCVcVkC|page=235|accessdate=2014-12-13}}</ref>

At the beginning of the 2nd century, the Central India [[Satavahana]] king [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] (r. 106–130) was described as the "Destroyer of [[Saka]]s (''[[Western Kshatrapas]]''), [[Yavana]]s (''[[Indo-Greek]]s'') and [[Pahlava]]s (''[[Indo-Parthians]]'')" in his inscriptions, suggesting a continued presence of the Indo-Greeks until that time.<ref>From Rapson, "Indian coins in the British Museum". Following the above quote, Rapson writes: "The Kashtriyas are the native Indian princes, the Rajputs of Rajputana, Gujarat and Central India; and the Sakas, Yavanas, and Pahavas are respectively Scythian, Greeks and Persian invaders from the north, who established kingdoms in various districts of Northern and Western India", p. xxxvii, Rapson.</ref>

[[File:MenInArm4.JPG|thumb|250px|Men in Greek uniform, [[Tillia Tepe]], 1st century CE.<ref>"Afghanistan, les trésors retrouvés", [[Guimet Museum]], item 79.</ref>]]
Around 200 AD, the [[Manu Smriti]] describes the downfall of the Yavanas, as well as many others:

''"43. But in consequence of the omission of the sacred rites, and of their not consulting [[Brahmana]]s, the following tribes of [[Kshatriya]]s have gradually sunk in this world to the condition of [[Shudra]]s;''<br />
''44. (Viz.) the [[Paundrakas]], the [[Chodas]], the [[Dravidas]], the [[Kambojas]], the [[Yavanas]], the [[Shakas]], the [[Paradas]], the [[Pahlavas]], the [[Chinas]], the [[Kiratas]], the [[Daradas]] and the [[Khashas]]."'' (Manusmritti, X.43–44)

There are important references to the warring Mleccha hordes of the Yavanas, Sakas, Kambojas, Pahlavas, etc. in the Bala Kanda of the [[Valmiki]] [[Ramayana]].<ref>(1.54.21-23; 1.55.2-3).

Indologists like Dr H. C. Raychadhury, Dr B. C. Law, Satya Shrava and others see, in these verses, the clear glimpses of the struggles of the Hindus with the mixed invading hordes of the barbaric Sakas, Yavanas, Pahlavas, Kambojas, etc. from north-west.<ref>The Śakas in India, 1981, p. 12, Satya Shrava; Journal, 1920, p. 175, University of Calcutta. Department of Letters; Political History of India from the Accession of Parikshit to the Coronation of Bimbisara, 1923, Page iii, Hemchandra Raychaudhuri;  Political History of Ancient India, 1996, p 4, Raychaudhury;  Indological Studies, 1950, p. 4, Dr B. C. Law.</ref> The time frame for these struggles is the 2nd century BCE downwards. Dr Raychadhury fixes the date of the present version of the Valmiki Ramayana around/after the 2nd century CE.<ref>Political History of Ancient India, 1996, pp. 3–4.</ref>

The invading [[Orda (organization)|horde]]s of the [[Saka]]s, [[Kambojas]], [[Yavana]]s, [[Pahlava]]s, [[Abhira]]s, etc. from the north-west had entered Punjab, ''United Province'', [[Sindhu]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Gujarat]] in large numbers, wrested political control of northern India from the [[Indo-Aryans]] and had established their respective kingdoms and principalities in the land of the Indo-Aryans.<ref>Cf also: 'Numerous Hindu references show, that there was a great inflow of foreign nations into India in the centuries before and after the Christian. The incorporation of foreign nations -- the Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Pahlavas & the Paradas is mentioned in the [[Vishnu Purana]] (Indian Antiquary, IV, 166; Bombay Gazetteer, 1882, p 413, Bombay (India : State), Bombay  (Presidency),  [[Harivamsa]], [[Vayu Purana]]  and numerous other Puranic texts. The invading hordes referenced in the Gazetteer are the Yavanas, Kambojas, Sakas, Pahlavas, etc. (See: Bombay Gazett. Presidency, 1901, p 448). Mahabharata mentions the great hordes of the Sakas and Yavanas helping the Kambojas (See: Bombay Gazett. Presidency, 1901, p 461, fn 2). In the Army of Nahapana (130 CE), the great Pahlava conqueror of Malwa and north Daccan, the supporting military hordes were the Kshaharatas (i.e. the Kambojas per Dr T. L. Shah), Pahlavas, Sakas and Yavanas' (Cf: Bombay Gazett, 1901, p 461, fn 2; Journal B.B. R.A., Soc., VIII, p 236).</ref>

There is also a distinct [[prophecy|prophetic]] statement in the [[Mahabharata]] which says that the Mlechha (Barbaric) kings of the Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Bahlikas, Abhiras, etc. will rule unrighteously in ''[[Kali Yuga]]''.<ref>

:viparite tada loke purvarupa.n kshayasya tat. 28.
:bahavo mechchha rajanah prithivyam manujadhipa.
:mithyanushasinah papa mrishavadaparayanah. 29.
:Andhrah ShakAh Pulindashcha Yavanashcha naradhipah.
:Kamboja Aurnikah Shudrastathabhira narottama. 30.
:: (MBH 23/187/28-30)</ref>

According to Dr H. C. Ray Chaudhury, ''this is too clear a statement to be ignored'' or explained away.

This statement, couched in the form of [[prophecy]] in true [[puranic]] style, alludes to a historical situation (2nd and 1st century BC downwards) which followed the collapse of [[Maurya]] and [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]] dynasties in North India.<ref>''"After the disintegration of Mauryan empire, the insecured frontier region of north-western part of India invited several foreign invaders i.e. Yavasnas, Sakas, Kambojas, Pahlavas from western and Central Asia who came in India through migrations and invasions. ...The moral and social degradation in the Indian society is indicated due to foreign invasions. Mahabharata states that Andhara, Sakas, Kambojas, Pulinda, Yavans, Vahlikas, Sudras, Abhiras, Mlechchas, will rule over the land and also will be addicted to falsehood"'' (Ref: Social Justice: Problems & Perspectives {Seminar Proceedings of March 5–7, 1995}, 1996, p. 173, Jhinkoo Yadav, Dr Suman Gupta, Chandrajeet Yadav); See also: ''Ancient Kamboja People and the Country'', 1981, Dr J. L. Kamboj.</ref>
'
This chaotic situation of [[Aryan]] India is said to have ended with the destruction of these Mlechcha [[Saka]], [[Kambojas|Kamboja]], [[Yavana]] and [[Pahlava|Parsika]] hordes by king [[Vikramaditya]] of [[Ujjain]]i (c. 60&nbsp;BC) as is related by Brihat-Katha-Manjari of the [[Kashmir]]i Pandit [[Kshemendra]] and [[Kathasaritsagara]] of Somadeva, and the establishment of the ''Vikrama era''.<ref>

'''Trade'''{{main|Roman trade with India}}
Although the political power of the Greeks had waned in the north, mainly due to nomadic invasions, trade relations between the Mediterranean and India continued for several centuries. The trade started by [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] in 130&nbsp;BCE kept on increasing, and according to [[Strabo]] (II.5.12), by the time of [[Augustus]], up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from [[Myos Hormos]] to India. So much gold was used for this trade, and apparently recycled by the Kushans for their own coinage, that [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (NH VI.101) complained about the drain of specie to India. In practice, this trade was still handled by Greek middlemen, as all the recorded names of ship captains for the period are Greek.

Also various exchanges are recorded between India and Rome during this period. In particular, embassies from India, as well as several missions from "[[Sramana]]s" to the Roman emperors are known (see [[Buddhism and the Roman world]]). Finally, Roman goods and works of art found their way to the Kushans, as archaeological finds in [[Begram]] have confirmed.

'''Genetics'''

[[File:HaddaTypes.JPG|thumb|200px|Portraits from the site of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], 3rd century CE.]]
Limited [[population genetics]] studies have been made on genetic markers such as [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|Y-DNA]] in the populations of the Indian subcontinent, to estimate the contribution of the Greeks to the genetic pool. Studies have not found the markers which are present in a large proportion of Greeks today.

{{quote|"The political influence of [[Seleucid]] and [[Greco-Bactrian|Bactrian dynastic Greeks]] over northwest India, for example, persisted for several centuries after the invasion of the army of [[Alexander the Great]] (Tarn 1951). However, we have not found, in Punjab or anywhere else in India, Y chromosomes with the M170 or M35 mutations that together account for 30% in [[Greeks]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonians]] today (Semino et al. 2000). Given the sample size of 325 Indian Y chromosomes examined, however, it can be said that the Greek homeland (or European, more generally, where these markers are spread) contribution has been 0%–3% for the total population or 0%–15% for Punjab in particular. Such broad estimates are preliminary, at best. It will take larger sample sizes, more populations, and increased molecular resolution to determine the likely modest impact of historic gene flows to India on its pre-existing large populations."|Kivisild et al.

Greek representations and artistic styles, with some possible admixtures from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world, continued to maintain a strong identity down to the 3rd–4th century, as indicated by the archaeological remains of such sites as [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]] in eastern [[Afghanistan]].<ref>Boardman, pp. 141–144.</ref>

The [[Greco-Buddhist]] image of the Buddha was transmitted progressively through Central Asia and China until it reached Japan in the 6th century.<ref>"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p. 19).</ref>

Numerous elements of Greek [[mythology]] and iconography, introduced in northwestern India by the Indo-Greeks through their coinage at the very least, were then adopted throughout Asia within a Buddhist context, especially along the [[Silk Road]]. The Japanese Buddhist deity [[Shukongoshin]], one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god [[Herakles]] to the Far-East along the Silk Road. The image of [[Herakles]] was introduced in India with the coinage of Demetrius and several of his successors, used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent [[Vajrapani]] the protector of the Buddha, and was then used in Central Asia, China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.<ref>"The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities ([[Nio]])." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p. 23).</ref>

'''Religion'''

{{main|Greco-Buddhism}}
[[File:VajrapaniAndMonks.jpg|thumb|The [[Zeus]]-like [[Vajrapani]] was chosen as a protector of the Buddha, art of [[Gandhara]], [[Guimet Museum]].]]
The impact of the Indo-Greeks on Indian thought and religion is unknown, although many influences have been suggested. Initially Greek settlers followed a [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of gods and goddesses assimilating with other deities. For example, [[Eucratides I]] depicted coinage with Zeus/[[Indra]] riding [[Airavata]]. Buddhism was spread to Greek communities by the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] Emperor [[Ashoka]]. Scholars believe that [[Mahayana Buddhism]] began around the 1st century BCE in the North-western Indian subcontinent, corresponding to the time and place of Indo-Greek florescence. Intense multi-cultural influences have indeed been suggested in the appearance of Mahayana. According to [[Richard Foltz]], "Key formative influences on the early development of the [[Mahayana]] and [[Pure Land]] movements, which became so much part of [[East Asia]]n [[civilization]], are to be sought in Buddhism's earlier encounters along the [[Silk Road]]".<ref>Foltz, "Religions of the Silk Road", p. 9.</ref> As [[Mahayana]] Buddhism emerged, it received "influences from popular Hindu devotional cults ([[bhakti]]), [[Persia]]n and [[Greco-Roman]] theologies which filtered into India from the northwest".<ref>[[Tom Lowenstein]], ''The Vision of the Buddha'', p. 63.</ref>

The "Avaca" Kharosthi inscription, found on a Buddhist relic casket, indicates that the old Greek military title of ''[[strategos]]'' ("commander") had apparently endured the Indo-Scythian invasion and was being used by the Apracarajas of [[Bajaur]] during the 1st century CE (the inscription mentions the dedication date of the casket as "the year 63 of the late Maharaja Aya", Aya being the Indo-Scythian ruler [[Azes I]], who started the [[Samvat (calendar eras)|Vikrama era]] in 58&nbsp;BCE, therefore suggesting a date around 5 CE). The dedication mentions "vaga stratego puyaite viyayamitro ya" i.e. "The Lord Commander (Stratego) Viyayamitra is honored too".<ref>Avaca inscription: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/601111 Journal of the American Oriental Society], Vol. 102, No. 1 (January–March, 1982), pp. 59–68.</ref>

The Greek philosopher [[Apollonius of Tyana]] is related by [[Philostratus]] in ''[[Life of Apollonius Tyana]]'' to have visited India, and specifically the city of [[Taxila]] around 46 CE. He describes constructions of the Greek type,<ref>Description of the Hellenistic urbanism of Taxila:

* "Taxila, they tell us, is about as big as Nineveh, and was fortified fairly well after the manner of Greek cities" [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_16.html#§20 (Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 20)]
* "I have already described the way in which the city is walled, but they say that it was divided up into narrow streets in the same irregular manner as in Athens, and that the houses were built in such a way that if you look at them from outside they had only one story, while if you went into one of them, you at once found subterranean chambers extending as far below the level of the earth as did the chambers above." [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_21.html#§23 (Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 23)]</ref>
probably referring to [[Sirkap]], and explains that the [[Indo-Parthian]] king of Taxila, named [[Phraotes]], received a Greek education at the court of his father and spoke Greek fluently:

[[File:AGAIGT.jpg|thumb|130px|"Ancient Indian and Indo-Greek theater" by M.L. Varadpande explores the Indo-Greek interaction in the theatrical arts.]]

:"Tell me, O King, how you acquired such a command of the Greek tongue, and whence you derived all your philosophical attainments in this place?"<ref name="livius">{{cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_26.html#§29|title=Flavius Philostratus: The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, II 29|author=Jona Lendering|publisher=livius.org|accessdate=2014-12-13}}</ref>
:[...]-"My father, after a Greek education, brought me to the sages at an age somewhat too early perhaps, for I was only twelve at the time, but they brought me up like their own son; for any that they admit knowing the Greek tongue they are especially fond of, because they consider that in virtue of the similarity of his disposition he already belongs to themselves."<ref name="livius2">{{cite web|url=https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_31.html#§31|title=Flavius Philostratus: The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, II 31|author=Jona Lendering|publisher=livius.org|accessdate=2014-12-13}}</ref>

Lastly, from the [[Rabatak inscription]] we have the following information, tending to indicate that Greek was still in official use until the time of [[Kanishka]] (c. 120 CE):

:"He (Kanishka) issued(?) an edict(?) in Greek and then he put it into the Aryan language". ...but when Kanishka refers to "the Aryan language" he surely means Bactrian, ..."By the grace of Auramazda, I made another text in Aryan, which previously did not exist". It is difficult not to associate Kanishka's emphasis here on the use of the "Aryan language" with the replacement of Greek by Bactrian on his coinage. The numismatic evidence shows that this must have taken place very early in Kanishka's reign, ..." — Prof. Nicholas Sims-Williams (University of London).

==Calendar==

'''Yona Era'''

A Greek "Yona" calendar era seems to have been in use in Northwestern Indian for several centuries following the foundation of the Indo-Greek kingdom. A recently discovered inscription in Kharoshthi on a Buddhist reliquary gives a relationship between several eras of the period:

:"In the twenty-seventh - 27 - year in the reign of Lord Vijayamitra, the King of the [[Apraca]]; in the seventy-third - 73 - year which is called "of Azes", in the two hundred and first - 201 - year of the Yonas (Greeks), on the eighth day of the month of Sravana; on this day was established [this] stupa by Rukhana, the wife of the King of Apraca, [and] by Vijayamitra, the king of Apraca, [and] by Indravarma (Indravasu?), the commander (stratega), [together] with their wives and sons."<ref>"Afghanistan, carrefour en l'Est et l'Ouest", p. 373. Also Senior, 2003.</ref>

The Yona era would correspond to 186&nbsp;BCE, which falls in the reign of [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]], although dates ranging from 186 to 150&nbsp;BCE are still debated.<ref>See [http://www.kushan.org/essays/chronology/azesvikrama.htm Chronology of Indian eras]</ref> The inscription would date to c. 15 CE.

The Yona Calendar was replaced by the [[Saka]] calendar, after their consolidation of power. The [[Indian national calendar]] is also called the Shalivahana Shaka (Saka) calendar due to its years being counted in the Saka era. Starting with the reign of [[Chashtana]] the Saka era is dated as year 0. The [[Azes era]] initiated by the Saka King [[Azes I]] was used alongside the [[Vikrama era]] starting in 58&nbsp;BCE,

A second inscription, called the Maghera inscription, found in the [[Mathura district]], is dated to the year 116 of the "Era of the Greeks" ("Yavanarajyasya sodasuttare varsasate 100 10 6), which would correspond to 70&nbsp;BCE.<ref>"Afghanistan, carrefour en l'Est et l'Ouest", p. 373.</ref>

'''Macedonian Calendar'''

[[File:TaxilaCopperPlate.JPG|thumb|The Indo-Scythian [[Taxila copper plate]] uses the Macedonian month of "[[Panemos]]" for calendrical purposes ([[British Museum]]).]]
The names of the months belonging to the [[Ancient Macedonian calendar]] remained in use under the [[Indo-Scythian]]s and the [[Kushan]]s until around the 2nd century CE. For example the Indo-Scythian [[Taxila copper plate]] inscription uses the Macedonian month of "[[Panemos]]".<ref>Tarn, p. 494.</ref> Later, the Dast-i Nawur inscription mentioning the Kushan king [[Vima Kadphises]] (reigned circa 90–100 CE) is dated to the 279th year (possibly in the Yona era, which would make it 93 CE, but alternatively in "the Great Arya era" mentioned by [[Kanishka]] in the [[Rabatak inscription]], possibly an era started by [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I]] which would give 108 CE), and the 15th day of the month of "[[Ancient Macedonian calendar|Gorpaios]]" (Γορπιαίος), which is the 11th month of the Macedonian calendar, corresponding to the moon of August.<ref>Mario Bussagli, "L'art du Gandhara", p. 187.</ref>

==Astronomy and astrology==

One of the earliest Indian writings on astronomy and astrology, titled the ''[[Yavanajataka]]'' or ''"The Saying of the Greeks"'', is a translation from Greek to Sanskrit made by "[[Yavanesvara]]" ("Lord of the Greeks") in 149–150 CE under the rule of the [[Indo-Scythians|Indo-Scythian]] king [[Rudrakarman I]] of the [[Western Satraps]]. The Yavanajataka contains instructions on calculating astrological charts (horoscopes) from the time and place of one's birth. Astrology flourished in the Hellenistic world (particularly Alexandria) and the Yavanajataka reflecting advancements in astrological techniques. Various astronomical and mathematical methods, such as the calculation of the 'horoskopos' (the zodiac sign on the eastern horizon), were used in the service of astrology.<ref>McEvilley, pp. 384–386.</ref>
<ref>Indian sources on Yavana learning:

* A comment in "[[Brihat-Samhita]]" by the mathematician [[Varahamihira]] says:<br />"The Greeks, though impure, must be honored since they were trained in sciences and therein, excelled others....." ("mleccha hi yavanah tesu samyak shastram kdamsthitam/ rsivat te 'p i pujyante kim punar daivavid dvijah" (Brihat-Samhita 2.15)).
* Also the [[Mahabharata]] compliments the Greeks as "the all-knowing Yavanas" (sarvajnaa yavanaa):<br />"The Yavanas, O king, are omniscient; the Suras are particularly so. The [[mleccha]]s are wedded to the creations of their own fancy." ("sarvajnaa yavanaa rajan shuraaz caiva vishesatah/ mlecchah svasamjnaa niyataanaanukta itaro janah (Mahabharata VIII ([[Karna Parva]]).[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m08/m08045.htm 45.35]))</ref> The Indo-Scythians would utilize astrology to form the [[Saka calendar]] and it's corresponding horoscopes, which is still used today as the Indian national calendar.

==Influence of Indo-Greek coinage==
{{Further|Post-Mauryan coinage|Post-Mauryan coinage of Gandhara}}

[[File:Western Satrap Coin of Rudrasimha I .jpg|thumb|Coin of the [[Western Kshatrapa]] ruler [[Bhratadarman]] (278–295), with corrupted Greek legend on the obverse and [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]] legend on the reverse.]]
[[File:Silver Coin of Kumaragupta I.jpg|thumb|A silver coin of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] King [[Kumara Gupta I]] (414–455) influenced by Indo-Greek coinage through the Western Kshatrapas, with profile of the ruler and obverse legend in pseudo Greek (succession of letters H and O), and reverse legend is in [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]].]]

Overall, the coinage of the Indo-Greeks remained extremely influential for several centuries throughout the Indian subcontinent:

*The Indo-Greek weight and size standard for silver [[drachm]]s was adopted by the contemporary Buddhist kingdom of the [[Kuninda]]s in [[Punjab region|Punjab]],{{citation needed|date=October 2007}}<!-- not in given ref this first part --> the first attempt by an Indian kingdom to produce coins that could compare with those of the Indo-Greeks.<ref>Tarn, pp. 324–325.</ref>
*In central India, the [[Satavahana]]s (2nd century BCE- 2nd century CE) adopted the practice of representing their kings in profile, within circular legends.<ref>Rapson, clxxxviFF.</ref>
*The direct successors of the Indo-Greeks in the northwest, the [[Indo-Scythians]] and [[Indo-Parthians]] continued displaying their kings within a legend in Greek, and on the obverse Greek deities.<ref>R. B. Whitehead, ''Indo-Greek Coins'', 1914, pp. 91–97.</ref>
*To the south, the [[Western Kshatrapas]] (1st-4th century) represented their kings in profile with circular legends in corrupted Greek.<ref>Rapson "A catalogue of Indian coins in the British Museum. p.cix</ref><ref>"It was their (the Indo-Greek's) commercial success that led the western Satraps to imitate them." Narain, ''The Indo-Greeks'', p. 115.</ref>
*The [[Kushans]] (1st-4th century) used the Greek language on their coinage until the first few years of the reign of [[Kanishka]], whence they adopted the [[Bactrian language]], written with the Greek script.<ref>Whitehead, pp. 171–177.</ref>
*The [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]] (4th-6th century), in turn imitating the [[Western Kshatrapas]], also showed their rulers in profile, within a legend in corrupted Greek, in the coinage of their western territories.<ref>"Evidence of the conquest of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurastra]] during the reign of [[Chandragupta II]] is to be seen in his rare silver coins which are more directly imitated from those of the [[Western Satraps]]... they retain some traces of the old inscriptions in Greek characters, while on the reverse, they substitute the Gupta type (a peacock) for the [[chaitya]] with crescent and star." in Rapson "A catalogue of Indian coins in the British Museum. The Andhras etc...", p. cli.</ref>

The latest use of the Greek script on coins corresponds to the rule of the [[Turk Shahis|Turkish Shahi]] of [[Kabul]], around 850.
