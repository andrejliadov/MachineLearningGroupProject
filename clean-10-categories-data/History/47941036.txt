The '''946 eruption of Paektu Mountain''' in Korea and China, also known as the '''Millennium Eruption''' or '''Tianchi eruption''', was one of the most powerful [[volcanic eruptions]] in [[recorded history]] and is classified as a [[VEI 7]] event. The [[Types of volcanic eruptions|eruption]] resulted in a brief period of significant [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]] in [[Manchuria]]. The year of the eruption has not been precisely determined, but a possible year is A.D. 946.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|title = Climatic impact of the Millennium eruption of Changbaishan volcano in China: New insights from high-precision radiocarbon wiggle-match dating|last = Xu|first = JD|date = 2013|journal = Geophysical Research Letters|doi = 10.1029/2012GL054246|bibcode=2013GeoRL..40...54X|volume=40|issue = 1|pages=54–59}}</ref>

=== 2013 {{SimpleNuclide|C|14}} wiggle-matching dating ===
Xu et al.,(2013)<ref name=":0" /> reported 27 best wiggle-match datings from a single partially charred 264-year-old tree, which is {{nowrap|946 ± 3 AD (1σ).}} Yin et al.,(2012) also reported 82 best wiggle-matched AMS {{SimpleNuclide|C|14}} ages of samples from four carbonized logs, which is 938/939. However, the result of Xu et al. (2013)<ref name=":0" /> used a "regional {{SimpleNuclide|C|14}} offset" in their ages to decrease the error, and their new date was obtained from the longer tree-ring sequence with the higher analytical precision of ±25 {{SimpleNuclide|C|14}} years, on a 260-year tree-ring sequence that covers three consecutive wiggles around A.D. 910, A.D. 785, and A.D. 730. Since longer dated tree-ring sequence, finer sample resolution, and higher {{SimpleNuclide|C|14}} analytical precision all facilitate more and tighter tie-points for better WM dating. The new date is believed to represent yet the best high-accuracy and high-precision {{SimpleNuclide|C|14}} WM chronology for the Millennium eruption.<ref name=":0" /> Xu's wood samples were cut from a tree growing in the area about 24&nbsp;km from the vent of Changbaishan volcano, it is not clear if volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> emission before the eruption could affect the samples and produce ages that are slightly too old.<ref name=":0" /> The best WM dates for the Millennium eruption use the outliers-removed subset of the original {{SimpleNuclide|C|14}} measurements and also account for the effect of possible regional {{SimpleNuclide|C|14}} offset, and yielded two nearly identical WM ages of {{nowrap|A.D. 945 ± 3}} and {{nowrap|A.D. 947 ± 3}}, where overall and combined agreement indices of the models reach their highest values.<ref name=":0" /> Therefore, the average of these two WM ages {{nowrap|(A.D. 946 ± 3)}} represents the best modeled WM age for the Millennium eruption.<ref name=":0" />

=== Historical records ===
The book ''[[Goryeosa]]'' (History of Goryeo) describes "是歳天鼓鳴赦" and "定宗元年天鼓鳴" (thunders from the heaven drum) in 946 A.D. Also, the book «興福寺年代記» (Annals of Kōfukuji) records "十月七日夜白灰散如雪" (3 November, white ash rain as snowing) on 3 Nov 946.<ref name=":3"/> The thunders may relate to the Millennium eruption, and white ash rain may relate to B-Tm ash.<ref name=":3"/> Three months later, on 7 February (947 A.D.), "十四日，空中有聲如雷鳴" (On the 14th, the air sounded like thunder) and "正月十四日庚子，此日空中有聲，如雷" (On the 14th of the first month of Gengzi, there was a sound in the sky, like thunder) were recorded in «貞信公記» and «日本紀略».<ref name=":3"/> Another similar record is on 19 Feb 944, in «日本紀略» "廿三日丙申，子刻，振動，聲在上" (On the 23rd of Bingshen, around midnight, shaking, sounds above).<ref name=":3"/> Based on the historical record, the eruption may have started on February 944 or November 946, reaching a climax in February 947.<ref name=":3"/>

A radiocarbon signal of 775 CE in a subfossil larch engulfed and killed during the initial explosive eruption, combined with glacial evidence from Greenland, dates the eruption to late 946 CE. This date rules out the Millennium Eruption contribution to the collapse of the [[Balhae]] in 926 CE. They also did not see a consequent cooling signal in tree-ring-based reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures.
The new date focuses attention on the chronicle from a temple in Japan that reports "white ash falling like snow" on 3 November 946 AD.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170129111657.htm#|title=Fossilized tree and ice cores help date huge volcanic eruption 1,000 years ago to within three months|website=www.sciencedaily.com|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref>

== Eruption volume ==
[[File:Millenium-Eruption-map.jpg|thumb|400px]]
The eruption volume has not been well constrained, from 70 to 160&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>. Machida et al. (1990)<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|title = The recent major eruption of changbai volcano and its environmental effects|last = Michida|date = 1990|hdl = 10748/3613}}</ref> roughly estimated the proximal volume (including [[ignimbrite]] and Plinian fall) no more than 20&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>, and the volume of distal B-Tm ashfall attains more than 50&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>. A low total bulk volume estimate is 70&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>. Horn and Schmincke (2000)<ref name=":1" /> used an [[exponential function|exponential]] method for minimum area/thickness and maximum area/thickness to obtain the volume of the Plinian ashfall as 82 ± 17&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>, and used the area-thickness method for ignimbrite to obtain 14.9 ± 2.6&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>. The total bulk volume estimate was 96 ± 19&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>. Liu et al.,(1998)<ref name=":2" /> also used same method with Horn and Schimincke to calculate the volume of Plinian ashfall, and obtained the similar value of 83&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>. However, Liu used a different area-thickness value for ignimbrite. Liu assumed a distribution of ignimbrite within 40&nbsp;km of the caldera, and an average ignimbrite thickness of 7.47m, yielding a volume of ignimbrite of 37.5&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>. The total bulk volume from this is 120&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>.

== Eruption dynamics ==
Base on the sequence of [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic]], the eruption began with [[pumice]] and ash falls, and then an [[eruption column]] collapse formed ignimbrite. The column collapse probably was a pulsing collapse, because the ignimbrite and pumice fall deposits are interleaved. Machida et al.,(1990)<ref name=":4" /> divided the Millennium eruption into 4 stages: Baegdu Plinian pumice fall, Changbai pyroclastic flow, Yuanchi tephra falls, and Baishan pyroclastic flow. But Baishan pyroclastic flow may related to post-caldera activity (?A.D.1668 eruption?).<ref name=":5" /> More recent study indicate that eruption include 2 stages: Plinian pumice fall and unwelded ignimbrite.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" />

=== Plinian stage ===
This stage formed a large area of white [[Rhyolitic|comenditic]] pumice and ash. The Plinian eruption column reached about 36&nbsp;km in height.<ref name=":2" /> B-Tm ash and "white ash rain" may related to this stage.<ref name=":3" /> Based on variations of grain-size and thickness of pumice, the Plinian stage can divided into 3 parts: early period, climax, and later period.<ref name=":2" />

==== Early period ====
In a Plinian pumice-fall section, the grain-size of pumice is reversely graded (coarse pumice on bottom and fine pumice on top). The variation of pumice size shows a major fluctuation in eruption column height during this Plinian event. Based on distribution of maximum lithics clasts in the early eruption, the eruption column probably reached 28&nbsp;km (H<sub>B</sub>=20&nbsp;km), and mass discharge rate attained 10<sup>8</sup> kg/s (10<sup>5</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/s). The Early period may have released 1.88–5.63 × 10<sup>19</sup> joule, and the eruption might have lasted for 33.5–115.5 hours.<ref name=":2" />

==== Climax period ====
Based on the distribution of crosswind of maximum lithics clasts, the top of eruption column might have reached 36&nbsp;km (H<sub>B</sub>=25&nbsp;km), with a mass discharge rate of around 3.6 × 10<sup>8</sup> kg/s (3.6 × 10<sup>5</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/s). The distribution of downwind of maximum lithics clasts showed the wind direction at the time to be SE120°, and the [[wind speed]] to be 30&nbsp;m/s. The height of eruption column (H<sub>B</sub>=25&nbsp;km), the water content of magma (1–2%), and the temperature of magma (1000 k) indicate that radius of the eruption vent was 200 m. The climax of the eruption may have released 4.18–12.43 × 10<sup>19</sup> joule, and the eruption might have lasted for 35–104 hours.<ref name=":2" />

==== Later period ====
This period eruption formed the upper part of the Plinian pumice fall, which is the fine pumice. The later Plinian pumice fall and pyroclastic flow occurred simultaneously, because some sections show that pumice fall and ignimbrite are interleaved. Combining the grain-size of pumice and thickness of pumice fall, the height of eruption column of later period was no higher than 14&nbsp;km (H<sub>B</sub>=10&nbsp;km), and the mass discharge rate was 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> kg/s (5 × 10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/s). The later period may released 8.76–26.16 × 10<sup>17</sup> joule for Plinian eruption and keeping eruption column.<ref name=":2" />

=== Ignimbrite stages ===
In many sections, a large grey [[Pyroclastic surge|ground-surge]] under an ignimbrite sheet, which might be from the front part of pyroclastic flow, and the unwelded ignimbrite always underlie a large [[Pyroclastic surge|ash-cloud surge]]. Ignimbrite was deposited within a 40&nbsp;km radius of the caldera, at an average thickness of 7.47 m. In many valleys, the thickness of ignimbrite may be 70–80 m. The Changbaishan ignimbrite has a low aspect ratio of 1.87 × 10<sup>−4</sup>. The speed of the initial pyroclastic flow might have been 170&nbsp;m/s (610&nbsp;km/h), and 50&nbsp;m/s (180&nbsp;km/h) at 50&nbsp;km away from the [[caldera]].<ref name=":2" />

=== Duration ===
The vent radius and water content of magma indicate that the average volume discharge rate of the Plinian eruption and ignimbrite was 1–3 × 10<sup>5</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/s (1–3 × 10<sup>8</sup> kg/s). A total bulk ejecta of 120&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> was derived from bulk volumes of pumice fall and ignimbrite of 83&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> and 37.5&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>, respectively. The ignimbrite-forming eruption may have lasted one and a half to four days (35–104 hours), while the Plinian eruption may have lasted three to nine and a half days (77–230 hours). The total duration of the eruption may have been four and a half to fourteen days (111–333 hours).<ref name=":2" />

== Volatiles ==
Plinian volcanic eruptions can inject a large amount of [[volatiles]] and [[aerosols]] into the atmosphere, leading to climate and environment changes.<ref name=":6" /> Chlorine concentrations in the [[Peralkaline rock|peralkaline]] from the Millennium eruption were postulated to have reached up to 2% and an average of 0.44%. The Millennium eruption was thus thought to have emitted an enormous mass of volatiles into the stratosphere, potentially resulting in a major climatic impact.<ref name=":1" />

=== Chlorine ===
McCurry used an [[electron microprobe]] to analyze the volatile in glass inclusion of [[feldspar]]. McCurry concluded that Millennium eruption may have released 2000 Mt Cl.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title = Volcanism and human environment|last = Liu|first = RX|publisher = Seismological Press|year = 1998|isbn = 978-7502812508|pages = 11}}</ref> Liu used [[chromatography]] to analyze the average of volatile of 5 whole-rock samples, and the contents of [[halogen]] is 0.08%–0.11%.<ref name=":7" /> A more recent and more detailed study by Horn and Schmincke (2000)<ref name=":1" /> used an ion probe to analyze the average of volatile in 6 of matrix glass and 19 melt inclusions, and the average of content of Cl in melt inclusions and matrix glass were found to be 0.4762% and 0.3853%, respectively. Horn and Schmincke concluded that the Millennium eruption may have released 45 ± 10 Mt of Cl. Another author, Guo,<ref name=":6" /> who studies [[petrology]] and [[geochemistry]], shows the average of contents of Cl in melt inclusions and matrix glass to be 0.45% and 0.33%, respectively.<ref name=":6" /> They concluded that Millennium eruption may have released 109.88 Mt of Cl, and 15.82 into the stratosphere.<ref name=":6" /> The Cl contents in the melt inclusions are similar to those of Mayor Island, and higher than those of Tambora (0.211%), Krakatau (0.238%) and Pinatubo (0.88–0.106%).<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":6" /> The large difference of results between Guo and Horn is because Guo used higher volume and density of magma.

=== Sulfur dioxide ===
Liu used chromatography to analyze the average of volatile content of five pumice and [[obsidian]] samples, finding the contents of sulfur to be 0.0415%, and Liu assumed the degassing efficiency factor of sulfur is 0.3. Liu estimated that the Millennium eruption may released 40 Mt of [[sulfur dioxide]].<ref name=":7" /> However, Horn and Schimincke<ref name=":1" /> calculated that only 20% of the sulfur in the magma had been degassed, because 80% of all analyses of inclusions and matrix fall below the detection limit of an [[ion probe]]. The results of average contents of sulfur in 19 of inclusions are 0.0455%, Horn assumed the contents of sulfur in matrix glass are 0.025% because 250 ppm is detection limit of the [[ion probe]].<ref name=":1" /> They concluded that the total sulfur dioxide released from eruption was only 4 ± 1.2 Mt, but Horn suggests that may be excess [[sulfur]] accumulated in the [[vapor]] phase.<ref name=":1" /> Guo calculated the average contents of sulfur in nine glass inclusions and one [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]] glass are 0.03% and 0.017%, respectively. The results of Guo are 23.14 Mt of sulfur dioxide released from eruption, and 3.33 Mt of sulfur dioxide input to stratosphere.<ref name=":6" /> The sulfur contents in glass inclusions show the reverse correlation with [[Silicon dioxide|SiO<sub>2</sub>]] concentrations, indicating that sulfur solubility in magma is controlled by magma differentiation process because of the occurrence of the S-rich fluid inclusions.<ref name=":6" />

=== Fluorine ===
Liu used chromatography to analyze the average of volatiles of five pumice and obsidian, finding the [[fluorine]] content to be 0.0158–0.0481%. Horn and Schimincke used an ion probe to find an average fluorine content in inclusions of 0.4294%, but fluorine concentrations in matrix glass show a significant bimodal distribution into F-rich (0.3992% F) and F-poor (0.2431% F).<ref name=":1" /> In order not to over-estimate syn-eruptive fluorine loss, they considered this bimodal distribution of fluorine for calculating the volatile difference between matrix glass and [[melt inclusions]] (4300 ppm F). The volatile loss is approximately 300 ppm F for melt inclusion and F-rich matrix glass (64% proportion of the comenditic magma), whereas it is 1900 ppm F for melt inclusion and F-poor matrix glass (36% proportion of the comenditic magma). Horn concluded that 42 ± 11 Mt of F was released by the eruption.<ref name=":1" /> Guo, based on less samples (9 inclusions and 3 matrix glass), calculated that F contents in inclusions and matrix glass are 0.42% and 0.21%, respectively.<ref name=":6" /> Guo concluded that 196.8 Mt of fluorine was released from eruption, with 28.34 Mt of F injected into the stratosphere.<ref name=":6" /> With magma evolving, halogen contents increase irregularly, parallel to the increase of SiO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in glass inclusions<ref name=":6" /> The large difference of results between Guo and Horn is because Guo used a higher volume and density of magma, and higher difference contents between matrix glass and inclusions.

=== Vapor phase ===
Sulfur is not strongly enriched during differentiation, in contrast to water, chlorine, and fluorine. The reason could be pre- or syn-eruptive degassing of a separate vapor phase, such as that postulated for the [[Mount Pinatubo|Pinatubo]] and [[Redoubt Mountain|Redoubt]] eruptions. The ultimate source for the excess volatile observed during the 1991 Pinatubo eruption is assumed to be sulfur-rich [[basaltic]] magmas underlying, and syn-eruptively intruded, into the overlying [[felsic]] magmas. The sulfur-rich [[trachytic]] and [[Trachyandesite|trachyandesitic]] magmas which underlay the [[Rhyolite|rhyolitic]] magma at Changbaishan may have been a possible source for excess sulfur accumulation. If this scenario is realistic, clearcut proxies for the environmental impact of the eruption would be expected.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":6" /> Millennium eruption magmas are predominantly [[phenocryst]]-poor (≤ 3 vol%) comendites plus a volumetrically minor late-stage, more phenocryst-rich (10–20 vol%) trachyte. Sizable (100–500&nbsp;µm diameter) glassy but bubble-bearing melt inclusions are widespread in [[anorthoclase]] and [[hedenbergite]] phenocrysts, as well as in rarer [[quartz]] and [[fayalite]] phenocrysts. Comparing the relative enrichments of incompatible volatile and nonvolatile elements in melt inclusions along a [[liquidus|liquid line]] of descent shows decreasing volatile/[[Zirconium|Zr]] ratios suggesting the partitioning of volatiles into a fluid phase. This suggests that current gas-yield estimates (Horn & Schminke, 2000<ref name=":1" />) for the Millennium eruption, based on the petrologic method (difference in volatiles between melt inclusions and matrix glass), could be severe underestimates.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Evidence of a Pre-eruptive Fluid Phase for the Millennium Eruption, Paektu Volcano, North Korea|last = Iacovino|first = K|date = 2014|journal = AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts|volume = 2014|pages = V24D–08|bibcode=2014AGUFM.V24D..08I}}</ref>

== Climate effects ==
The Millennium eruption is thought to have emitted an enormous mass of volatiles into the stratosphere, likely resulting in a major worldwide climatic impact, though more recent studies indicate that the Millennium eruption of Changbaishan volcano may have been limited to regional climatic effects.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":8" /><ref name=":9" /> However, there are some meteorological anomalies in A.D. 945–948 which may relate to the Millennium eruption.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The possible climatic impact in China of Iceland's Eldgja eruption inferred from historical sources|last = Fei|first = J|date = 2006|journal = Climatic Change|doi = 10.1007/s10584-005-9012-3|volume=76|issue = 3–4|pages=443–457|bibcode = 2006ClCh...76..443F|s2cid = 129296868}}</ref>
