The '''Décapole''' (''Dekapolis'' or {{lang-de|Zehnstädtebund}}) was an alliance formed in 1354 by ten [[Free imperial city|Imperial cities]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the [[Alsace]] region to maintain their rights. It was disbanded in 1679.

In 1354 Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV of Luxembourg]] ratified the treaty uniting the towns of [[Haguenau]], [[Colmar]], [[Wissembourg]], [[Turckheim]], [[Obernai]], [[Kaysersberg]], [[Rosheim]], [[Munster, Haut-Rhin|Munster]], [[Sélestat]] and [[Mulhouse]].<ref name="Köbler">G. Köbler, ''Historisches Lexikon der deutschen Länder'', 7th edition, C.H. Beck, Munich, 2007.</ref> Hagenau became its capital while the Imperial city of [[Strasbourg]], though venue of the league's diets, remained outside the alliance. The town of [[Seltz]] joined the league when it received [[Imperial immediacy|immediate]] status in 1357, but had to leave it after its [[mediatization]] to the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] in 1414.

The affiliation at first discontinued after Charles' death in 1378, it was, however, re-established in the next year. The ten cities joined the [[Upper Rhenish Circle]] in 1500. In 1515, Mulhouse pulled out of the alliance in order to associate with the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]]. It was replaced in 1521 by the city of [[Landau]] in northern Alsace.<ref name="Köbler"/>

The alliance was strongly shaken by the [[Thirty Years' War]] which ravaged the region, allowing [[Louis XIV of France]] to conquer the cities according to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. The signing of the [[Treaties of Nijmegen]] in 1679 finally brought an end to the Décapole, when Alsace was annexed by France. Mulhouse remained an independent city and exclave of the Swiss Confederation until in 1798 it was annexed to the [[French First Republic]]. Landau together with the Palatinate was given to [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] after the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]].
