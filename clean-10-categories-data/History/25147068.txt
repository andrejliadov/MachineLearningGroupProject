'''SM ''U-73''''' was one of 329 [[submarine]]s serving in the [[Imperial German Navy]] in [[World War I]]. She engaged in the [[Naval warfare of World War I|commerce war]] as part of the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|First Battle of the Atlantic]].  ''U-73'' has the distinction of being responsible for planting the underwater mine that later led to the sinking of the largest ship sunk during World War I, the 48,158 ton [[hospital ship]] [[HMHS Britannic#Last voyage|''Britannic'']].<ref>{{cite Uboat.net

== Operations ==
After completion at [[Danzig]] in November 1915, ''U-73'' was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] by ''[[Kapitänleutnant]]'' Gustav Sieß.<ref name=U73/> She joined the Kiel School, where she remained until February 1916, conducting trials and crew training. She then left for the North Sea and was attached to the 1st Half Flotilla. Her activities were monitored throughout the war by [[Room 40]], and most of her recorded movements are based on that information.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/displaycataloguedetails.asp?CATLN=6&CATID=3981615&j=1 National Archives, Kew: HW 7/3]</ref> Her first operational cruise began 1 April 1916, when she left [[Heligoland Bight]], bound for the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] by way of the [[North Sea]]. ''En route'', she attacked one steamer in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and laid [[naval mine|mine]]s off Lisbon and Malta. On 27 April 1916 she laid a minefield of 22 mines outside the [[Grand Harbour]] of [[Valletta]] in which four ships were sunk: the battleship {{HMS|Russell|1901|6}}; the sloop {{HMS|Nasturtium|1915|2}}; HMT Crownsin, sunk 4 May 1916 with the loss of 11 men{{cn|date=November 2020}}; and the yacht HMY ''Aegusa''.<ref>{{cite web|title=HMS Nasturtium (Flower Class Sloop - Arabis Type)|url=http://www.divesubway.com/nasturtium.html|website=Subway Dive Centre|accessdate=29 August 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822185045/http://divesubway.com/nasturtium.html|archivedate=22 August 2014}}</ref> On arriving in [[Cattaro]] on about 1 May (the date is uncertain), ''U-73'' joined the Pola-Cattaro Flotilla.

The minelaying cruises of ''U-73'' in the Mediterranean cannot be reconstructed. The battleship HMS ''Russell'' hit two of the mines and sank. On 7 October 1916 she is reported to have left [[Pula|Pola]] in [[Croatia]], and the French put down to her the mine sunk off Cape Male on 12 October, as well as a minefield in the Gulf of Salonika, and mines in the [[Gulf of Athens]] on which two Greek ships were blown up. It seems certain ''U-73'', still commanded by Sieß,<ref name=U73/> laid the mine by which the hospital ship [[HMHS Britannic|HMHS ''Britannic'']] (currently the largest passenger ship resting on the seafloor and the largest ship sunk during World War I) was lost, only one hour after ''U-73'' laid the mine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Carl|title=Interview with Carl Spencer (Leader 2003 Britannic Expedition)|url=http://www.hospitalshipbritannic.com:80/cs_interview.htm|website=Hopital Ship Britannic|accessdate=4 February 2018}}</ref> It is possible the hospital ship HMHS ''Braemar Castle'' was also damaged by one of her mines. ''U-73'' suffered from constant machinery trouble in common with her class. At the end of October 1918, now in the hands of Kptlt. Fritz Saupe,<ref name=U73/> she was [[scuttling|scuttled]] at Pola in Croatia.
