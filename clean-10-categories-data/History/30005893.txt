The '''Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training''' ('''ADST''') is a [[United States]] non-profit organization established in 1986 by retired Foreign Service officers. It produces and shares oral histories by American diplomats and facilitates the publication of books about diplomacy by diplomats and others. Its Foreign Affairs Oral History program has recorded over 2,500 oral histories and continues to grow; its book series includes over 100 books. ADST is located on the campus of the Foreign Service Institute in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]].

== Organizational mission ==
ADST promotes the importance of U.S. diplomacy by '''capturing, preserving, and sharing the experiences of America’s diplomats and other foreign affairs professionals''' to enrich diplomatic practitioners’ professional knowledge and strengthen public appreciation of diplomacy’s contribution to the national interest. ADST programs include:

* Recording the oral histories of diplomats, family members, and others;
* Facilitating the preparation and publication of books on diplomacy;
* Contributing to diplomatic case studies and educational materials;
* Supporting professional education at the [[Foreign Service Institute]].

=== Oral history project ===
ADST's major initiative is the '''Foreign Affairs Oral History Project'''. ADST interviews American diplomats after departure from government service about their career experiences and professional insights and assessments of leaders, successful and unsuccessful policies, and foreign conflicts.<ref name="loc">{{cite web|title=Frontline Diplomacy: The Foreign Affairs Oral History Collection of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/foreign-affairs-oral-history/about-this-collection/|website=loc.gov|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=February 21, 2017}}{{PD-notice}}</ref> The [[oral history]] project was begun in the 1980s by retired U.S. Foreign Service officer Charles “Stu” Kennedy, who, after listening to several eulogies given at an ambassador's funeral, became concerned that the historically valuable personal recollections of U.S. diplomats might be lost forever if not recorded.<ref>{{cite news|title=It happened to me: Diplomats recount stories of crisis and survival|url=http://federalnewsradio.com/management/2014/09/it-happened-to-me-diplomats-recount-stories-of-crisis-and-survival/|accessdate=February 21, 2017|work=[[WFED]]|date=September 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aldrich|first1=Richard|title=The Foreign Affairs Oral History Program|journal=Diplomacy & Statecraft|date=July 1993|volume=4|issue=2|pages=210–216|doi=10.1080/09592299308405882}}</ref> Originally sponsored by [[Georgetown University]]'s [[Lauinger Library]], ADST subsequently assumed ownership of the project.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=https://isd.georgetown.edu/history|website=Institute for the Study of Diplomacy|publisher=[[Georgetown University]]|accessdate=February 21, 2017}}</ref> The oral history collection is regularly referenced by scholars, authors, and media, including ''[[The Washington Post]]'''', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[C-SPAN]], [[RealClearPolitics]], and others.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Torry|first1=Jack|title=Don't Blame Nixon for Scuttled Peace Overture|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/08/09/dont_blame_nixon_for_scuttled_peace_overture_127667.html|accessdate=February 21, 2017|work=RealClearPolitics|date=August 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Langer|first1=Emily|title=Christian Chapman, U.S. diplomat who survived assassination attempt, dies at 95|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/christian-chapman-us-diplomat-who-survived-assassination-attempt-dies-at-95/2016/12/21/508ff284-c7a8-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html|accessdate=February 21, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The Diplomatic Life: It's Not All Striped Trousers and Sips of Tea|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/12/the-diplomatic-life-its-not-all-striped-trousers-and-polite-talks/383904/|accessdate=February 22, 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=December 18, 2014}}</ref>

Since 1986, ADST’s Foreign Affairs Oral History Program has recorded more than 2,500 interviews with former participants in the U.S. foreign affairs process. Collectively, these oral histories span over 80 years and provide first-person accounts of many dramatic incidents in U.S. diplomacy, such as the Iran hostage crisis, the Beirut and Nairobi bombings, accounts from World War II, the Vietnam War, and more recent narratives from 9/11, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Annually about 60 new interviews are added. The collection also contains significant oral histories dealing with U.S. diplomacy provided by universities and presidential libraries.

The oral history collection has become one of the largest in the country on any subject and the most significant archive on foreign affairs. Oral histories have been used as source material for several books, such as [[John Pomfret (journalist)|John Pomfret’s]] ''The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom: America and China, 1776 to the Present,'' Derek Leebaert's ''Grand Improvisation: America Confronts the British Superpower, 1945-1957'', Timothy Weiner's ''Legacy of Ashes'', and Margaret MacMillan's ''Nixon and Mao: The Week That Changed the World''.

The Oral History Collection is a part of the Library of Congress [[American Memory|American Memory collection]]. It is unclassified, available to the public, and can be found at the Library’s [https://www.loc.gov/collections/foreign-affairs-oral-history/about-this-collection/ Frontline Diplomacy website]. It is also available on ADST’s site under [https://adst.org/oral-history/oral-history-interviews/ Oral History Interviews].

Other ADST resources include the '''video series''' “[https://www.youtube.com/user/ADSTdiplomacy/videos Tales of American Diplomacy]”, podcasts, and articles highlighting “'''Moments in U.S. Diplomatic History'''”; several resources have overlapping content in different formats to increase accessibility. ADST’s education landing page features six model high school lesson plans on diplomacy, based on oral history primary source material for educators. Country readers and subject readers comprising excerpts from oral histories compiled by country or topic facilitate research and enhance background knowledge.

In order to honor and highlight the diversity of the Foreign Service, ADST has compiled a legacy collection of the oral histories of African American diplomats and diplomats of Latino descent.

=== Publications ===
