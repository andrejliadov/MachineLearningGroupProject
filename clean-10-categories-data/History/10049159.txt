==History of the prize==
The December 1968 issue of the Review carried a brief obituary of Professor T. S. Ashton (1889-1968) by A. H. John and a flier announcing the intention to establish the Prize, initially endowed by Mrs Ashton with the sum of £500. Further donations were sought from EHS members and an initial prize suggested of £50, to be awarded annually. The Prize was formally announced in the April 1970 issue of the Review. In 1981, the value of the Prize was raised to £150, with the intention of making an award every other year. The value was raised to its current value of £750 in 1998.

Note: The Economic History Society's archives at the [[London School of Economics]] include a file, 'Correspondence relating to the TS Ashton Prize, 1971-82.'
