'''Billy Mitchell''' is a [[volcano]] in the central part of the island of [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], just north-east of the [[Bagana|Bagana Volcano]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. It is a small [[pyroclastic shield]] truncated by a 2&nbsp;km wide [[caldera]] filled by a [[Volcanic crater lake|crater lake]].<ref name=global>{{cite gvp|vn=255011|name=Billy Mitchell|accessdate=}}</ref> It is named after [[Billy Mitchell]], a 20th-century [[United States]] [[United States Army|Army]] general who is regarded as the father of the [[United States Air Force]].

The last two major eruptions were in 1580 AD ± 20 years and about 1030 AD. They were among the largest [[Holocene]] eruptions in Papua New Guinea. Both were [[explosive eruption]]s with a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] of at least 5. The 1580 AD ± 20 years eruption produced [[pyroclastic flow]]s and probably formed its [[caldera]].<ref>[http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=0505-011&volpage=erupt The Billy Mitchell erupts] at the Global Volcanism Program website</ref> The [[ignimbrite]] deposit from that eruption, which had a VEI of 6, extends {{convert|22|km|mi}} from the caldera to the coast, and its volume is around {{convert|10|km3|mi3}}.<ref name=live/>
== Caldera lake ==
Billy Mitchell caldera lake is about 1,013 m above sea level, has total  surface area {{convert|3|km2|abbr=on}}, and the maximum depth  approximately 88.3  m. The only fish species  in the lake is  the eel [[Anguilla megastoma]]. <ref> Robert Schabetsberger, Ursula Sichrowsky, Alexander Scheck, Michael Schagerl, Barbara Mähnert, Bettina Sonntag, Karin Pall [https://bioone.org/journalArticle/Download?fullDOI=10.2984%2F71.1.3 First Limnological Characterization of Crater Lake Billy Mitchell (Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea)] Pacific Science, 71(1):29-44 (2017). https://doi.org/10.2984/71.1.3</ref>
