The '''1946 pacification of villages by ''PAS'' NZW''' was the killing that year of 79 Polish nationals of Belarusian ethnicity in the area of [[Bielsk County]], north-eastern Poland, by partisans, members of the Polish Extraordinary Special Actions unit of the National Military Union (NZW) (Polish: Pogotowie Akcji Specjalnej Narodowego Zjednoczenia Wojskowego (PAS NZW)). These murders took place in the aftermath of World War II. 

In January and February 1946, units of the PAS Special Forces (''Pogotowie Akcji Specjalnej'') from the [[National Military Union]] (''Narodowe Zjednoczenie Wojskowe'') burned down the villages of [[Zaleszany, Hajnówka County|Zaleszany]], [[Wólka Wygonowska]], [[Zanie, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Zanie]], [[Szpaki, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Szpaki]], and [[Końcowizna]].{{sfn|IPN|2005|pp=1–2}} They also executed 30 [[coachman|coachmen]] on 30 January 1945 near [[Puchały Stare]], and a similar number of armed resistors in Zanie on 2&nbsp;February 1946.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=14|loc=§: "Podczas rozprawy sądowej K. Chmielowski dodał, że we wsi Zanie ludność broniła się strzelając i dlatego 'nasze oddziały odpowiedziały ogniem'."}} 

Since 1995, this mass killing of civilians was the subject of official investigation by the government-affiliated [[Institute of National Remembrance]].{{sfn|IPN|2005|pp=1–2}} The inquiry resulted in the publication of a final report in June 2005, summarizing this case. The Commission interviewed a total of 169 persons,{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=8}} and analysed all documents and testimonies dating back to the 1949 [[show trial]] of Polish [[cursed soldiers]]: Captain [[Romuald Rajs]] of the PAS Special Forces, and his co-conspirator and deputy, Lieutenant Kazimierz Chmielowski from [[NZW]].{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=8}}

Among the individuals questioned by IPN were families of victims, as well as former soldiers of the 3rd Brigade of NZW responsible for the deaths of 79 Polish nationals of Belarusian ethnicity from several villages in [[Bielsk County]]. The IPN closed its official investigation without additional charges filed. Sentences from the Stalinist period had already been carried out. In addition, there had been [[extrajudicial killing]]s of partisans by governmental authorities during the [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–46)|Polish anti-Communist insurrection]]. No living perpetrators of the atrocities committed in early 1946 have been identified.{{sfn|IPN|2005|pp=1–2}} These postwar atrocities have continued to receive considerable press coverage by the media.<ref name=racyja>{{cite web |url=http://www.racyja.com/sumezhzha/dzen-praklyatykh-zhaunerau/ |title=Дзень выклятых жаўнераў |trans-title=Cursed Soldiers Day |last=Lajeuskaja |first=Valiancina |date=2015 |website=Racyja.com |publisher=Radio Racyja |access-date=11 October 2016 |language=be}}</ref><ref name=maksymiuk1>{{cite web |url=http://www.svaboda.org/a/24893741.html |title=Jakaja ž to pravda na sviêti? |trans-title=What's the truth in the world? |last=Maksymiuk |first=Jan |date=5 February 2013 |website=Svaboda.org |publisher=Radio Svaboda |access-date=11 October 2016 |language=be}}</ref> {{sfn|IPN|2005|p=19|loc=§: "są Polakami wyznania prawosławnego"}}

Captain Rajs ("Bury") was active in the area of [[Wilno]] during the [[German occupation of Poland]].<ref name=KrB/> Since 1943, he led the 1st Company of the 3rd Wilno Brigade of Armia Krajowa with the rank of Second Lieutenant.<ref name=KrB/> After the dissolution of the 5th Brigade, Rajs made contact with Commandant of the [[National Military Union]] ''[[Okręg]] III Białystok'', Major Jan Szklarek, and moved his [[Ludowe Wojsko Polskie|LWP]] [[platoon]] under his command.{{sfn|Pałka|2013|p=10|loc=§: "Największe, masowe opuszczanie szeregów wojska miało miejsce w latach 1944–1945, gdy dezerterowały i uciekały do lasu całe pododdziały"}} He was promoted to the rank of [[Captain]] and became leader of the PAS Special Forces (''Pogotowie Akcji Specjalnej'') within NZW ''Białystok''.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=3}} The process of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944–46)|unification of smaller underground units]] in the area of [[Wysokie Mazowieckie County]], commanded by Kazimierz Chmielowski ("Rekin"; meaning "Shark", in Polish) until December 1945, resulted in the gathering of the largest anti-Soviet partisan group in the region.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=3|loc=§: "W wyniku podjętych działań przez "Rekina" udało się skoncentrować znaczniejsze siły na terenie powiatu wysoko mazowieckiego"}}

==Assaults of January and February 1946==
[[File:01943 "Bury" Romuald Rajs.jpg|thumb|upright|Captain [[Romuald Rajs]]]]

By the end of 1945, the NZW ''III Białystok'' consolidated most of the local anti-communist underground by absorbing into its own command scattered units of [[National Armed Forces|NSZ]] and [[National Military Organization|NOW]].{{sfn|Poleszak|2002|p=4|loc=§: "Celem działań NZW było stopniowe skupianie w swoich szeregach wszystkich organizacji narodowych, a następnie przejęcie przewodnictwa w konspiracji antykomunistycznej."}} Many former members of resistance left the forest to begin a new life,{{sfn|Poleszak|2002|p=5}} although for some the return to civilian life was not possible. Both [[Milicja Obywatelska|MO]] and the [[NKVD]] had compiled [[Hitmen|hit lists]] of anti-communist conspirators from local sources.{{sfn|Poleszak|2002|p=3|loc=§: "na posterunkach Milicji Obywatelskiej i NKWD sporządzano listy członków podziemia, których miano aresztować w niedalekiej przyszłości"}} 

By early 1946, the NZW was the only underground organization still capable of active resistance. Their assaults included destruction of MO outposts and Communist Party bureaus, ambushes on special units of UBP, KBW, WP and NKWD; as well as various retaliatory actions. A few local towns were taken over by PAS NZW temporarily. Some police stations were destroyed repeatedly.{{sfn|Poleszak|2002|pp=9-10}}

In early January 1946, NZW headquarters called a meeting of local commanders. Rajs was given leadership of partisans enrolled by Chmielowski ("Rekin"). His unit, consisting of 228 soldiers, was renamed as the 3rd Wilno Brigade of the NZW PAS. A decision was made to move the entire force to an area around [[Bielsk Podlaski]] for further military training.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=3|loc=§: "Celem koncentracji i przemarszu było szkolenie całego oddziału nazwanego 3 Wileńską Brygadą NZW"}}

===Actions in Łozice and Hajnówka===
On 27 January 1946 the battalion entered [[Łozice, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Łozice village]] and approached a gathering of horse-drawn vehicles organized by the local authorities in need of conscripted labour. The partisans requisitioned around 40 carriages and ordered their drivers to go along.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=3|loc=§: "członkowie oddziału dokonali selekcji zgromadzonych zaprzęgów konnych, wybierając lepsze pod względem sprawności"}} Some [[Coachman|coachmen]] mistakenly believed that the uniformed soldiers have belonged to the communist forces.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=8|loc=§: "żołnierze ludowego wojska polskiego"}} The battalion boarded the carriages and in the same evening rode to the [[Hajnówka County|County of Hajnówka]].{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=3}} Rajs ordered the attack on [[Hajnówka]] where the Polish communist militia as well as some Red Army soldiers returning to the USSR, were stationing. The takeover of Hajnówka was unsuccessful. The farmers with horse-drawn carriages remained with the battalion throughout January as means of transportation even though several failed attempts were made by PAS NZW to replace them with new carriers.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=3}}

Contrary to opinions disseminated by politicized media in today's Belarus,<ref name=maksymiuk1/><ref name=backauscyna/> the single criterion used by PAS NZW in the selection of carriages was their durability and strength; it was not the alleged faith of the actual coachmen, nor their purported Belarusian roots, as revealed by research conducted by the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]]. The coachmen came to Łozice from about a dozen neighbouring villages because they were ordered to do so by the communist authorities attempting to transport nationalized wood to [[Orla, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Orla village]].{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=3}} Meanwhile, the relocation of the NZW battalion was planned well ahead.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=24|loc=§: "Nic nie wskazuje na to, że w Łozicach wybierano z góry upatrzone osoby, bowiem przy wyborze kierowano się tylko takimi kryteriami jak dobry koń, czy dobry wóz i to decydowało o tym, kto pojedzie z oddziałem"}}

===Pacification of Zaleszczany and Wólka Wygonowska===
On 29 January 1946 the battalion arrived in [[Zaleszany, Hajnówka County]], to feed the horses. During a routine document check by the partisans, a Red Army soldier and NKVD informer, Aleksander Zielinko was identified, serving as Communist Party secretary in nearby [[Suchowolce]].{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=11|loc=§: "Zielinko był sekretarzem partii w Suchowolcach"}} All inhabitants were ordered to report to a big house of Dymitr Sacharczuk where they were taken hostage. They were questioned on the whereabouts of suspected collaborator, and [[Sołtys]] of Zaleszany, Łukasz Demianiuk who vanished. His 16-year-old son Piotr (already a PPR member) was identified and executed together with Zielinko. Not a single hostage was killed from the gathering at Sacharczuk's house.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=4}} According to official report released in 2005 by the [[Institute of National Remembrance]], all hostages kept in Sacharczuk's house run out to safety and survived; they were not persecuted, but the PAS NZW set a number of buildings on fire, and 16 people died in Zaleszany while attempting to hide from the soldiers.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=4|loc=§: "Osoby, które zginęły w Zaleszach byli to wyłącznie ci, którzy nie poszli na zebranie"}} The final IPN investigation revealed that the later description of what happened there was falsified by the Stalinist functionaries.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=18|loc=§: "funkcjonariusze bezpieczeństwa podawali dane niezgodne z obiektywnym przebiegiem wydarzeń"}}

[[File:Cerkiew św. Michała Archanioła w Wólce Wygonowskiej 4.JPG|thumb|upright|Memorial plaque in [[Wólka Wygonowska]] ]]
The unit led by Rajs ("Bury") departed for the neighbouring village of [[Wólka Wygonowska]]. Some farm buildings were set ablaze for refusal to provide assistance. Two local men were shot dead while they were running away from the soldiers: Jan Zinkiewicz and Stefan Babulewicz. Many year later, Zinkiewicz's daughter rationalized that her father ran to save his farm equipment from burning, and that he was not fleeing from them.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=11}}

===Massacre in Puchały Stare===
On the following day of 30 January 1945 the command of NZW PAS Brigade arrived in [[Krasna Wieś]] village where they arranged the exchange of horse-drawn carriers.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=4}} Eye-witness Włodzimierz K. from Jagodniki later testified that they arrived in Krasna Wieś ahead of others. Most of the partisan group fell behind. The new coachmen were ordered to wait for them but instead, took their horse-drawn carriages and run away.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=9|loc=§: "nie czekali, lecz uciekli z Krasnej Wsi"}} They were chased through the forest by the platoon led by "Modrzew", caught around [[Puchały Stare]] village, arrested, taken away in two groups, and executed as traitors. Years later, the exhumations conducted by the authorities in Puchały on 27 April 1951 revealed that 27 farmers have been killed there and buried in two shallow graves. In 1997 the number was raised to 30.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=9}}<ref>[http://www.wspolczesna.pl/magazyn/art/5757809,romuald-rajs-bury-zolnierz-wyklety-i-morderca,id,t.html Romuald Rajs "Bury".

===Assault on Szpaki–Zanie===
At the end of January 1946 the soldiers of the 3rd Brigade came to [[Zanie, Podlaskie Voivodeship]], to requisition food. One of the partisans, Kazimierz Borkowski, was struck with an axe to the head by a farmer who refused to give in.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=18|loc=§: "uderzony przez gospodarza siekierą w głowę (k.&nbsp;1113)"}} Rajs, who had already received information in Hajnówka, that ethnic Belarusians who lived in Szpaki–Zanie served as [[Volksdeutsche]] under Nazi Germany,{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=14|loc=§: "za okupacji niemieckiej byli volksdeutschami"}} gave an order for the pacification of the two villages.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=5}} During his postwar interrogations Rajs informed that the actual order of burning down Zanie, [[Szpaki, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Szpaki]] and [[Końcowizna]] in retaliation for hostile attitude towards NZW, came from his superior Florian Lewicki ''[[nom de guerre]]'' "Lis" ("Kotwicz"),{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=16}} regional commandant of NZW (real name, Jan Szklarek).{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=14|loc=§: "Polecenie spalenia wymienionych wsi otrzymałam od "Kotowicza" ("Lisa")"}} The NZW PAS unit consisting of three platoons of about 30 men led by "Rekin" (Chmielowski), "Wiarus", and "Bitny" (J. Boguszewski), was sent to Szpaki–Zanie on 2&nbsp;February 1946. Rajs was not present. He went with his command to [[Końcowizna]] village,{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=5}} where no-one was killed.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=6|loc=§: "Mieszkańcy wsi uciekli i nikt nie zginął (k.&nbsp;1854)"}} According to postwar interrogation of Kazimierz Chmielowski ("Rekin"), the NZW troops were fired upon by the locals in Zanie. Later report by the Special Commission from [[Bielsk Podlaski]] confirmed that a submachine gun with ammunition was found in one of the burned out buildings.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=5}} A dozen farmhouses were set on fire and 36 men singled out for collaboration with the enemy were executed by the platoon led by "Rekin". The names of the men to be shot have been secretly obtained by the [[Armia Krajowa Obywatelska]] from [[Bielsk County]]. Subsequently, both "Wiarus" and "Bitny" (along with "Modrzew") were killed in action on 12 February 1946 in [[Gmina Ełk]].<ref name="IPN"/>

Chmielowski ("Rekin") is said to have attacked other villages in [[gmina]] [[Kleszczele]] as well, where some farmhouses where burned. According to Rajs, Chmielowski did it on his own accord, although Chmielowski himself insisted during questioning by the communist interrogators that bullets were fired up into the air.<ref name="IPN">{{cite journal |url=http://ipn.gov.pl/pl/dla-mediow/komunikaty/9989,Informacja-o-ustaleniach-koncowych-sledztwa-S-2802Zi-w-sprawie-pozbawienia-zycia.html |title=Informacja o ustaleniach końcowych śledztwa S 28/02/Zi w sprawie pozbawienia życia 79 osób – mieszkańców powiatu Bielsk Podlaski w tym 30 osób tzw. furmanów w lesie koło Puchał Starych, dokonanych w okresie od dnia 29 stycznia 1946 r. do dnia 2 lutego 1946 |date=2005-06-30 |publisher=[[Instytut Pamięci Narodowej]] |author=IPN |journal=Komunikaty}}</ref> Notably, as many as five alleged pacification actions by "Rekin" were fabricated by the UB interrogators, since the village of Mostek never existed in the [[Bielsk County]] as revealed by the IPN investigation.{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=18|loc=§: "zawarte informacje o spaleniu pozostałych 4 miejscowości to wytwór wyobraźni funkcjonariuszy UB"}}

==Trial==
On 17 November 1948, Romuald Rajs was captured in [[Karpacz]] by ''[[Urząd Bezpieczeństwa]]'' while on vacation. A month later, his co-conspirator Chmielowski was arrested on 13 December 1948. They were tried in a [[show trial]] held at the [[Białystok]] movie theatre "Ton",<ref name=KrB/> and charged with membership in AK and NZW aiming to overthrow the communist government of Poland, coupled with armed assaults on the Polish Army and the Red Army, the assassination of MO functionaries, attacks on the UB security outposts, the railway guard, as well as assassination of civilians during forced requisitions of property, and possession of assault weapons. Individually, Romuald Rajs was also charged with desertion from the Polish Army. They were executed on 30 December 1949 without material evidence of alleged civilian atrocities, which were obtained by the communist authorities well over a year later, in the spring of&nbsp;1951.<ref name=ASt>{{cite journal |publisher=Ciechanowiec OnLine - Subiektywny Niecodziennik |title=Śliwowo - w szczerym polu czarny krzyż... |author=Aleksander Staniszewski |url=http://www.ciechanowiec.info/news.php?readmore=506&amp%3Bc_start=0 |date=30 April 2008}}</ref>{{sfn|IPN|2005|p=7}}<ref name=EdB>{{cite book |author=Edmund Banasikowski |title=Na zew Ziemi Wileńskiej |year=1990 |publisher=Wydaw.
