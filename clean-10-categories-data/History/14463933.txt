The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to ancient history:

'''[[Ancient history]]''' &ndash; study of ''recorded'' human history from the beginning of [[writing]] at about 3000 BC until the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The times ''before [[writing]]'' belong either to [[protohistory]] or to [[prehistory]]. The span of recorded history is roughly 5,000 â€“ 5,500 years, beginning with [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]], the oldest form of writing discovered so far.  Although the ending date of ancient history is disputed, currently most [[Western culture|Western]] scholars use the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in  476 [[Anno Domini|AD]] or the coming of Islam in 632 AD as the end of ancient history.
