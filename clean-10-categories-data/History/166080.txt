{{short description|Relationship between historic and Biblical events}}
{{Bible related|expanded= studies}}

The '''historicity of the Bible''' is the question of the [[Bible]]'s relationship to [[history]]—covering not just the Bible's acceptability as history but also the ability to understand the [[literary form]]s of biblical [[narrative]].{{sfn|Thompson|2014|p=164}} One can extend biblical historicity to the evaluation of whether or not the Christian [[New Testament]] is an accurate record of the [[historical Jesus]] and of the [[Apostolic Age]]. This tends to vary depending upon the opinion of the scholar.

When studying the [[books of the Bible]], scholars examine the [[historical context]] of passages, the importance ascribed to events by the [[authors of the Bible|authors]], and the contrast between the descriptions of these events and other [[historical evidence]].

According to theologian [[Thomas L. Thompson]], a representative of the [[Biblical minimalism|Copenhagen School]], the archaeological record lends sparse and indirect evidence for the [[Old Testament]]'s narratives as history.{{efn|1={{quote|Biblical archaeology has helped us understand a lot about the world of the Bible and clarified a considerable amount of what we find in the Bible. But the archaeological record has not been friendly for one vital issue, Israel's origins: the period of slavery in Egypt, the mass departure of Israelite slaves from Egypt, and the violent conquest of the land of Canaan by the Israelites. The strong consensus is that there is at best sparse indirect evidence for these biblical episodes, and for the conquest there is considerable evidence against it.|Peter Enns.{{sfn|Enns|2013|p= unpaginated}}<!--end of quote-->}}<!--end efn-->}}<ref>

==Materials and methods==
===Manuscripts and canons===
The Bible exists in multiple manuscripts, none of them an [[autograph (manuscript)|autograph]], and multiple [[Biblical canon|canons]], which do not completely agree on which books have sufficient authority to be included or their order (see [[Books of the Bible]]). The early discussions about the exclusion or integration of various [[apocrypha]] involve an early idea about the historicity of the core.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fDd4dQek-DsC&q=historizit%25C3%25A4t+der+bibel+apokryphen&pg=PA6|title=Theologie des Kanons: der christliche Kanon, seine Hermeneutik und die Historizität seiner Aussagen; die Lehren der Kirchenväter als Grundlegung der Lehre von der Heiligen Schrift|last=Grosse|first=Sven|year=2011|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3643800787|pages=91–92|language=de}}</ref> The [[Ionian Enlightenment]] influenced early patrons like [[Justin Martyr]] and [[Tertullian]]—both saw the biblical texts as being different from (and having more historicity than) the myths of other religions. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] was aware of the difference between science and scripture and defended the historicity of the biblical texts, e.g., against claims of [[Faustus of Mileve]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fDd4dQek-DsC&q=historizit%25C3%25A4t+der+bibel+apokryphen&pg=PA6|title=Theologie des Kanons: der christliche Kanon, seine Hermeneutik und die Historizität seiner Aussagen; die Lehren der Kirchenväter als Grundlegung der Lehre von der Heiligen Schrift|last=Grosse|first=Sven|date=2011|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3643800787|page=94|language=de|quote=One does not read in the Gospel that the Lord said: "I will send you the Paraclete who will teach you about the course of the sun and moon." For He willed to make them Christians, not mathematicians. (Translation of the German Quote according wikiquote)}}</ref>

Historians hold that the Bible should not be treated differently from other historical (or literary) sources from the ancient world. One may compare doubts about the historicity of, e.g., [[Herodotus]]; the consequence of these discussions is not that we shall have to stop using ancient sources for historical reconstruction, but that we need to be aware of the problems involved when doing so.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqJxkKy-cMMC&q=herodotus+ancient+sources+barstad&pg=PA41|title=History and the Hebrew Bible: Studies in Ancient Israelite and Ancient Near Eastern Historiography|last=Barstad|first=Hans M.|date=2008|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3161498091|pages=40–42|language=en}}</ref>

Very few texts survive directly from antiquity: most have been copied—some, many times. To determine the accuracy of a copied manuscript, [[Textual criticism|textual critics]] examine the way the transcripts have passed through history to their extant forms. The higher the consistency of the earliest texts, the greater their textual reliability, and the less chance that the content has been changed over the years. Multiple copies may also be grouped into [[text types]], with some types judged closer to the hypothetical original than others. Differences often extend beyond minor variations and may involve, for instance, interpolation of passages central to issues of historicity and doctrine, such as the [[Mark 16#Mark 16:9–20 in the manuscripts and patristic evidence|ending of Mark 16]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Writing and reading history===
[[File:William Albright 1957.jpg|thumb|left|W.F. Albright, the doyen of biblical archaeology, in 1957]]

The meaning of the term "history" is itself dependent on social and historical context. Paula McNutt, for instance, notes that the Old Testament narratives "do not record 'history' ''in the sense that history is understood in the twentieth century.'' ...The past, for biblical writers as well as for twentieth-century readers of the Bible, has meaning only when it is considered in light of the present, and perhaps an idealized future."<ref name="isbn0-281-05259-X">{{cite book |last= McNutt |first= Paula M. |title= Reconstructing the society of ancient Israel |publisher= SPCK |location= London |year= 1999 |isbn= 978-0281052592 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hd28MdGNyTYC |page= 4, emphasis added}}</ref>

Even from the earliest times, students of religious texts had an awareness that parts of the scriptures could not be interpreted as a strictly consistent sequence of events. The [[Talmud]] cites a dictum ascribed to the third-century teacher [[Abba Arika]] that "there is no chronological order in the Torah".<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud |BT]] ''[[Pesachim (Talmud)|Pesachim]]'' [http://juchre.org/talmud/pesachim/pesachim1.htm#6b 6b]. Literally: ''no earlier or later in the Torah''</ref> Examples were often presented and discussed in later Jewish [[exegesis]] with, according to [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] (1907-1972), an ongoing discourse between those who would follow the views of [[Rabbi Ishmael]] (born 90 CE) that "the Torah speaks in human language", compared to the more mystical approach of [[Rabbi Akiva]] ({{circa}} 50 – 135 CE) that any such deviations should signpost some deeper order or purpose, to be divined.<ref>[[Abraham Joshua Heschel]] (1962 / translation 2006), ''Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations'', p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WAGK8GiNrQgC&pg=PA240 240]</ref>

During the modern era, the focus of Biblical history has also diversified. The project of [[Biblical archaeology school|biblical archaeology]] associated with [[W.F. Albright]] (1891-1971), which sought to validate the historicity of the events narrated in the Bible through the ancient texts and material remains of the [[Near East]],<ref name="isbn0-8446-0003-2">{{cite book |last= Albright |first= William Foxwell |title= Archaeology of Palestine |publisher= Peter Smith Pub Inc |year= 1985 |page= 128 |quote= Discovery after discovery has established the accuracy of innumerable details of the Bible as a source of history. |isbn= 978-0844600031}}</ref> has a more specific focus compared to the more expansive view of history described by archaeologist [[William G. Dever|William Dever]] (1933- ). In discussing the role of his discipline in interpreting the biblical record, Dever has pointed to multiple histories within the Bible, including the [[history of theology]] (the relationship between God and believers), [[political history]] (usually the account of [[Great man theory |"Great Men"]]), [[narrative history]] (the [[chronology]] of events), [[intellectual history]] (treating ideas and their development, context and evolution), [[social history |socio-cultural history]] (institutions, including their social underpinnings in family, clan, tribe and social class and the state), [[cultural history]] (overall [[cultural evolution]], [[demography]], socio-economic and political structure and ethnicity), [[history of technology |technological history]] (the techniques by which humans adapt to, exploit and make use of the resources of their environment), [[natural history]] (how humans discover and adapt to the [[ecological]] facts of their natural environment), and material history (artifacts as correlates of changes in human behaviour).<ref>Dever, William G. (2008), "[[Did God Have a Wife?]]: Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel" (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company)</ref>

Sharply differing perspectives on the relationship between narrative history and theological meaning present a special challenge for assessing the historicity of the Bible. Supporters of [[biblical literalism]] "deny that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual, religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of history and science. We further deny that scientific hypotheses about earth history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation and the flood."<ref name="isbn1-58134-056-7">{{cite book|last= Henry |first= Carl Ferdinand Howard |volume= 4 |chapter= The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy |title= God, Revelation and Authority |publisher= Crossway Books |location= Wheaton, Ill |year= 1999 |orig-year= 1979 |pages= 211–219 |isbn= 978-1581340563 |chapter-url= http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/chicago.htm |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061115025545/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/chicago.htm |archive-date=2006-11-15 }}</ref> "History", or specifically Biblical history, in this context appears to mean a definitive and finalized framework of events and actions—comfortingly familiar shared facts. But prominent scholars have expressed diametrically opposing views: 
<blockquote>
[T]he stories about the promise given to the patriarchs in Genesis are not historical, nor do they intend to be historical; they are rather historically determined expressions about Israel and Israel's relationship to its God, given in forms legitimate to their time, and their truth lies not in their facticity, nor in the historicity, but their ability to express the reality that Israel experienced.<ref name="Thompson">{{cite book |last= Thompson |first= Thomas |title= The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives: The Quest for the Historical Abraham |publisher= Trinity Press International |location= Valley Forge, Pa |year= 2002 |orig-year= 1974 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lwrzapZYqFAC |isbn= 978-1563383892}}</ref>
</blockquote>
Modern professional historians, familiar with the phenomenon of on-going [[historical revisionism]], allow new findings and ideas into their interpretations of "what happened", and scholars versed in the study of [[Text (literary theory) |text]]s (however sacred) see all [[narrative |narrator]]s as potentially unreliable<ref>

===Authorship===

{{main|Authorship of the Bible}}
A central pillar of the Bible's historical authority was the tradition that it had been composed by the principal actors or eyewitnesses to the events described—the [[Pentateuch]] was the work of Moses, Joshua was by Joshua, and so on. However, the [[Protestant Reformation]] had brought the actual texts to a much wider audience, which combined with the growing climate of intellectual ferment in the 17th century that was the start of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. This threw a harsh, sceptical spotlight on these traditional claims. In Protestant England, the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his major work ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) denied Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, and identified Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles as having been written long after the events they purported to describe. His conclusions rested on internal textual evidence, but in an argument that resonates with modern debates, he noted: "Who were the original writers of the several Books of Holy Scripture, has not been made evident by any sufficient testimony of other History, which is the only proof of matter of fact."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hobbes |first=Thomas |title=Leviathan|chapter=Chapter XXXIII.

[[File:Title page of the "Histoire critique du vieux testament" by Richard Simon.jpg|thumb|left|Title page of Simon's ''Critical history'', 1682.]]
The Jewish philosopher and pantheist [[Baruch Spinoza]] echoed Hobbes's doubts about the provenance of the historical books in his ''A Theologico-Political Treatise'' (published in 1670),<ref>{{cite book |last=Spinoza |first=Baruch |title=A Theologico-Political Treatise (Part II) |chapter=Chapter VIII. Of the authorship of the Pentateuch and the other historical books of the Old Testament |year=1670 |chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext97/2spnt10.txt}}</ref> and elaborated on the suggestion that the final redaction of these texts was post-exilic under the auspices of [[Ezra]] (Chapter IX). He had earlier been effectively excommunicated by the rabbinical council of [[Amsterdam]] for his perceived [[heresies]]. The French priest [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] brought these critical perspectives to the [[Catholic]] tradition in 1678, observing "the most part of the Holy Scriptures that are come to us, are but Abridgments and as Summaries of ancient Acts which were kept in the Registries of the Hebrews," in what was probably the first work of biblical textual criticism in the modern sense.<ref>{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Richard |title=A critical history of the Old Testament|year=1682|location=London|page=21|publisher=Walter Davis|url=https://archive.org/details/SimonRichard1638-1712ACriticalHistoryOfTheOldTestament1682}}</ref>

In response [[Jean Astruc]], applying to the Pentateuch [[source criticism]] methods common in the analysis of classical secular texts, believed he could detect four different manuscript traditions, which he claimed Moses himself had redacted (p.&nbsp;62–64).<ref name="isbn0-8308-2551-7"/> His 1753 book initiated the school known as [[higher criticism]] that culminated in [[Julius Wellhausen]] formalising the [[documentary hypothesis]] in the 1870s,<ref>{{cite book |last=Wellhausen |first=Julius |title=Prolegomena to the History of Israel |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Adam and Charles Black |year=1885 |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/cv/phai/index.htm }}</ref> which identifies these narratives as the [[Jahwist]], [[Elohist]], [[Deuteronomist]], and the [[Priestly source]]. While versions of the Documentary Hypothesis vary in the order in which they were composed, the circumstances of their composition, and the date of their redaction(s), their shared terminology continues to provide the framework for modern theories on the composite nature and origins of the Torah.<ref>[[Gordon Wenham|Wenham, Gordon]]. "[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_pentateuch_wenham.html Pentateuchal Studies Today]," ''[[Themelios]]'' 22.1 (October 1996)</ref>

By the end of the 19th century the scholarly consensus was that the Pentateuch was the work of many authors writing from 1000 BCE (the time of [[David]]) to 500 BCE (the time of Ezra) and redacted c. 450, and as a consequence whatever history it contained was more often polemical than strictly factual—a conclusion reinforced by the then fresh scientific refutations of what were at the time widely classed as biblical mythologies.

There is a Christian tradition of criticism of the creation narratives in Genesis dating back to at least [[St Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430), and Jewish tradition has also maintained a critical thread in its approach to biblical primeval history. The influential medieval philosopher [[Maimonides]] maintained a skeptical ambiguity toward creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' and considered the stories about [[Adam]] more as "philosophical anthropology, rather than as historical stories whose protagonist is the 'first man'."<ref name="isbn90-247-3439-8">{{cite book |last=Klein-Braslavy |first=Sara |editor=Pines, S. |editor2=Yovel, Y. |title=Maimonides and Philosophy (International Archives of the History of Ideas / Archives internationales d'histoire des idées) |chapter=The Creation of the world and Maimonides' interpretation of Gen. i–v |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1986 |pages=65–78 |isbn=978-9024734399 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SzymWqsNulMC }}</ref> Greek philosophers [[Aristotle]],<ref>''Physics'' I, 7</ref> [[Critolaus]]{{sfn|Dorandi|1999|p=50}} and [[Proclus]]{{sfn|Lang|2001|p=2}} held that the [[Eternity of the world|world was eternal]].

The publication of [[James Hutton]]'s ''[[Theory of the Earth]]'' in 1788 was an important development in the scientific revolution that would dethrone Genesis as the ultimate authority on primeval earth and [[prehistory]]. The first casualty was the Creation story itself, and by the early 19th century "no responsible scientist contended for the literal credibility of the Mosaic account of creation."<ref name="isbn0-674-34481-2">{{cite book |last=Gillispie |first=Charles Coulston |title=Genesis and geology: a study in the relations of scientific thought, natural theology, and social opinion in Great Britain, 1790–1850 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1996 |orig-year=1951 |isbn=978-0674344815 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PKERMZkA9A0C |page=224}}</ref> The battle between [[uniformitarianism]] and [[catastrophism]] kept the Flood alive in the emerging discipline, until [[Adam Sedgwick]], the president of the Geological Society, publicly recanted his previous support in his 1831 presidential address:<blockquote>We ought indeed to have paused before we first adopted the diluvian theory, and referred all our old superficial gravel to the action of the Mosaic Flood.

All of which left the "first man" and his putative descendants in the awkward position of being stripped of all historical context, until [[Charles Darwin]] naturalized the Garden of Eden with the publication of ''[[On The Origin of Species]]'' in 1859. Public acceptance of this scientific revolution was, at the time, uneven, but has since grown significantly. The mainstream scholarly community soon arrived at a consensus, which holds today, that Genesis 1–11 is a highly schematic literary work representing [[theology]]/symbolic [[mythology]] rather than actual history or science.<ref name="isbn0-8308-2551-7">{{cite book |last=Wenham |first=Gordon J. |title=Exploring the Old Testament: A Guide to the Pentateuch|chapter=Genesis 1–11 |publisher=InterVarsity Press |location=Downers Grove, Ill |year=2003 |isbn=978-0830825516 }}</ref>

====The Patriarchs====
{{main|Patriarchs (Bible)}}
In the following decades [[Hermann Gunkel]] drew attention to the mythic aspects of the Pentateuch, and [[Albrecht Alt]], [[Martin Noth]] and the [[tradition history]] school argued that although its core traditions had genuinely ancient roots, the narratives were fictional framing devices and were not intended as history in the modern sense. Though doubts have been cast on the historiographic reconstructions of this school (particularly the notion of oral traditions as a primary ancient source), much of its critique of biblical historicity found wide acceptance. Gunkel's position is that
{{quote|1=if, however, we consider figures like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to be actual persons with no original mythic foundations, that does not at all mean that they are historical figures. ...For even if, as may well be assumed, there was once a man call "Abraham," everyone who knows the history of legends is sure that the legend is in no position at the distance of so many centuries to preserve a picture of the personal piety of Abraham. The "religion of Abraham" is, in reality, the religion of the legend narrators which they attribute to Abraham.{{sfn|Gunkel|1997|p=lxviii}}
|sign=|source=|title=}} This has in various forms become a commonplace of contemporary criticism.{{efn|{{quote|BIBLICAL HISTORY AND ISRAEL'S PAST 
The Changing Views of Scholars in Their Own Words The dramatic shifts in the study of the patriarchs and matriarchs that occurred during and after the 1970s can be illustrated by quotations from two works on the history of Israel separated by several decades. In a history originally written in the 1950s, John Bright asserted, "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were clan chiefs who actually lived in the second millennium B.C.... The Bible's narrative accurately reflects the times to which it refers. But to what it tells of the lives of the patriarchs we can add nothing."<sup>1</sup> Assessing the situation in scholarship four decades later, William Dever in 2001 concluded, "After a century of exhaustive investigation, all respectable archaeologists have given up hope of recovering any context that would make Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob credible 'historical figures.'"<sup>2</sup>

... historical figures but as literary creations of this later period. Though the evidentiary underpinnings of this thesis were new, the thesis itself was quite similar to the views held by Alt and Noth. Thompson, Van Seters, and others had shown that the earlier scholarly consensus of a second-millennium date for the traditions depended upon coincidences and harmonization of evidence that could not be sustained. Thompson provided one of the most representative statements of this change in the study of Israel's past: "[N]ot only has 'archaeology' not proven a single event of the patriarchal traditions to be historical, it has not shown any of the traditions to be likely. On the basis of what we know of Palestinian history of the Second Millennium B.C., and of what we understand about the formation of the literary traditions of Genesis, it must be concluded that any such historicity as is commonly spoken of in both scholarly and popular works about the patriarchs of Genesis is hardly possible and totally improbable".<ref name="MooreKelle2011">{{cite book|author1=Megan Bishop Moore|author2=Brad E.

In the United States the [[biblical archaeology]] movement, under the influence of Albright, counterattacked, arguing that the broad outline within the framing narratives was also true, so that while scholars could not realistically expect to prove or disprove individual episodes from the life of Abraham and the other [[patriarchs]], these were real individuals who could be placed in a context proven from the archaeological record. But as more discoveries were made, and anticipated finds failed to materialise, it became apparent that archaeology did not in fact support the claims made by Albright and his followers. Today, only a minority of scholars continue to work within this framework, mainly for reasons of religious conviction.<ref name="isbn0-385-42590-2">{{harvnb|Mazar|1992|p={{page needed|date=March 2016}} }}</ref> William Dever stated in 1993 that

===Deuteronomistic history===
{{main|Deuteronomist}}
Many scholars believe that the "Deuteronomistic History" preserved elements of ancient texts and oral tradition, including geo-political and socio-economic realities and certain information about historical figures and events. However, large portions of it are legendary and it contains many anachronisms.<ref name=mazar/>

====The "Conquest Narrative" in Joshua and Judges====
A major issue in the historicity debate was the narrative of the Israelite conquest of Canaan, described in Joshua and Judges. The American Albright school asserted that the biblical narrative of conquest would be affirmed by archaeological record; and indeed for much of the 20th century archaeology appeared to support the biblical narrative, including excavations at Beitin (identified as Bethel), Tel ed-Duweir, (identified as Lachish), Hazor, and Jericho.<ref name=FinkelsteinSilberman2002/><ref name=OEANE>{{cite book |last=Holland |first=Thomas A.| title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East | chapter=Jericho | publisher=Oxford University Press | editor=Eric M. Meyers | year=1997 | pages=220–224}}</ref>

However, flaws in the conquest narrative appeared. The most high-profile example was the "fall of [[Tell es-Sultan|Jericho]]", excavated by [[John Garstang]] in the 1930s.<ref name=FinkelsteinSilberman2002/> Garstang originally announced that he had found fallen walls dating to the time of the biblical [[Battle of Jericho]], but later revised the destruction to a much earlier period.<ref name=OEANE/> [[Kathleen Kenyon]] dated the destruction of the walled city to the middle of the 16th century ({{circa}} 1550 BCE), too early to match the usual dating of the Exodus to Pharaoh Ramses, on the basis of her excavations in the early 1950s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kenyon |first=Kathleen M.| title=Digging up Jericho: The Results of the Jericho Excavations, 1952–1956 | publisher=Praeger | place=New York | year=1957 | page=229}}</ref> The same conclusion, based on an analysis of all the excavation findings, was reached by Piotr Bienkowski.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bienkowski |first=Piotr| title=Jericho in the Late Bronze Age | publisher=Warminster | year=1986 | pages=120–125}}</ref> By the 1960s it had become clear that the archaeological record did not, in fact, support the account of the conquest given in Joshua: the cities which the Bible records as having been destroyed by the Israelites were either uninhabited at the time, or, if destroyed, were destroyed at widely different times, not in one brief period.<ref name="FinkelsteinSilberman2002">{{cite book|author1=Israel Finkelstein|author2=Neil Asher Silberman|title=The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Sacred Texts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lu6ywyJr0CMC&pg=PA81|year=2001|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0743223386|pages=81–82}}</ref>
According to [[Israel Finkelstein]], the consensus for the conquest narrative was abandoned in the late 20th century.<ref name= FinkelsteinSilberman2002/>

In his view, the Book of Joshua conflates several independent battles between disparate groups over the centuries, and artificially attributes them to a single leader, Joshua.<ref name=Peakes>''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''</ref> However, there are a few cases where the biblical record is not contradicted by the archaeological record. For example, [[stratum]] in [[Tel Hazor]], found in a [[destruction layer]] from around 1200&nbsp;BCE, shows signs of catastrophic fire, and cuneiform tablets found at the site refer to monarchs named ''Ibni Addi'', where ''Ibni'' may be the [[etymology|etymological]] origin of ''Yavin'' (''Jabin''), the Canaanite leader referred to in the Hebrew Bible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early%20History%20-%20Archaeology/Hatzor%20-%20The%20Head%20of%20all%20those%20Kingdoms|title=Hatzor – The Head of all those Kingdoms|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref><ref name=Finkelstein>{{Harvnb|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001}}</ref> The city also shows signs of having been a magnificent Canaanite city prior to its destruction, with great temples and opulent palaces,<ref name=Finkelstein/> split into an upper [[acropolis]] and lower city; the town evidently had been a major Canaanite city. Finklestein theorized that the destruction of Hazor was the result of civil strife, attacks by the [[Sea Peoples]], and/or a result of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse|general collapse]] of civilization across the whole eastern Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age, rather than being caused by the Israelites.<ref name=Finkelstein/>

====Books of Samuel====
The Books of Samuel are considered to be based on both historical and legendary sources, primarily serving to fill the gap in Israelite history after the events described in [[Deuteronomy]]. The battles involving the destruction of the Canaanites are not supported by archaeological record, and it is now widely believed that the Israelites themselves originated as a sub-group of Canaanites.<ref name="Tubb 1998 13–14">{{harvnb|Tubb|1998|pp=13–14}}</ref><ref name=mcnutt47>McNutt 1999, p. 47.</ref><ref>K.

There is a gargantuan troop called up (2 Samuel 17:1), a battle with 20,000 casualties (2 Samuel 18:7), and a reference to Kushite paramilitary and servants, clearly giving evidence of a date in which [[Kushites]] were common, after the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|26th Dynasty of Egypt]], the period of the last quarter of the 8th century BCE.<ref name="isbn0-691-00086-7">{{cite book |last=Redford |first=Donald B. |title=Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in ancient times|url=https://archive.org/details/egyptcanaanisrae00redf |url-access=registration |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |year=1992 |page=[https://archive.org/details/egyptcanaanisrae00redf/page/305 305] |isbn=978-0691000862}}</ref>

====United Monarchy====
Much of the focus of modern criticism has been the historicity of the "United Monarchy" of Israel, which according to the Hebrew Bible ruled over both Judea and Samaria around the 10th century BCE.
[[Thomas L. Thompson]], a leading [[biblical minimalism|minimalist]] scholar for example, has written:

:There is no evidence of a United Monarchy, no evidence of a capital in Jerusalem or of any coherent, unified political force that dominated western Palestine, let alone an empire of the size the legends describe. We do not have evidence for the existence of kings named Saul, David or Solomon; nor do we have evidence for any temple at Jerusalem in this early period. What we do know of Israel and Judah of the tenth century does not allow us to interpret this lack of evidence as a gap in our knowledge and information about the past, a result merely of the accidental nature of archeology. There is neither room nor context, no artifact or archive that points to such historical realities in Palestine's tenth century. One cannot speak historically of a state without a population. Nor can one speak of a capital without a town. Stories are not enough.

In Iron Age IIa (corresponding to the Monarchal period) Judah seems to have been limited to small, mostly rural and unfortified settlements in the Judean hills.<ref name=mazar/> This contrasts to the upper [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samaria]] which was becoming urbanized. This archaeological evidence as well as textual criticism has led many modern historians to treat Israel/Samaria and Judah as arising separately as distinct albeit related entities centered at [[Shechem]] and [[Jerusalem]], respectively, and not as a united kingdom with a capital in Jerusalem.

Excavations at [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]], an Iron site located in Judah, support the biblical account of a United Monarchy. The [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] stated: "The excavations at Khirbat Qeiyafa clearly reveal an urban society that existed in Judah already in the late eleventh century BCE. It can no longer be argued that the Kingdom of Judah developed only in the late eighth century BCE or at some other later date."<ref>{{cite web|first1=Yossi|last1=Garfinkel|first2=Sa‘ar |last2=Ganor|first3=Michael |last3= Hasel |date=19 April 2012|url=http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=1989|title=Journal 124: Khirbat Qeiyafa Preliminary Report|publisher=Hadashot-esi.org.il|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516105045/http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=1989|archive-date=16 May 2012}}</ref>

Amihai Mazar contends that if the Iron I/Iron IIa dating of administrative structures in the City of David are correct (as he believes), "Jerusalem was a rather small town with a mighty citadel, which could have been a center of a substantial regional polity."<ref name=mazar/>

Since Jerusalem has been destroyed and then subsequently rebuilt approximately 15 to 20 times since the time of David and Solomon, some argue much of the evidence of 10th century habitation could easily have been eliminated. However, Israel Finkelstein notes that significant architecture from later in the Iron Age (Iron IIb) has been found.

==New Testament==

===Historicity of Jesus===
{{main|Historicity of Jesus}}
The historicity of some New Testament teachings of Jesus is also debated by biblical scholars. The "[[quest for the historical Jesus]]" began as early as the 18th century, and has continued to this day. The most notable recent scholarship came in the 1980s and 1990s, with the work of [[J. D. Crossan]],<ref>Crossan, J. D. "The Historical Jesus: A Mediterranean Jewish Peasant," HarperOne, 1993, {{ISBN|0060616296}}</ref> [[James D. G. Dunn]],<ref>James D. G. Dunn, "Jesus Remembered: Christianity in the Making, Vol. 1, Eerdmans, 2003"</ref> [[John P. Meier]],<ref>John P. Meier, "A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus, 3 vols., the most recent volume from Yale University Press, 2001"</ref> [[E. P. Sanders]]<ref>Sanders, E.P. "The Historical Figure of Jesus," Penguin, 1996, {{ISBN|0141928220}}</ref> and [[N. T. Wright]]<ref>Wright, N.T. "Jesus and the Victory of God: Christian Origins and the Question of God", Vol. 2, Augsburg Fortress Press, 1997, {{ISBN|0800626826}}</ref> being the most widely read and discussed. The earliest New Testament texts which refer to Jesus, [[Pauline epistles|Paul's letters]], are usually dated in the 50s CE. Since Paul records very little of Jesus' life and activities, these are of little help in determining facts about the life of Jesus, although they may contain references to information given to Paul from the eyewitnesses of Jesus.<ref name="A Marginal Jew">[[John P. Meier]], ''[[A Marginal Jew]]'' Volume I, Doubleday, 1991.</ref>

The discovery of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] has shed light into the context of [[Roman Judea|1st century Judea]], noting the diversity of Jewish belief as well as shared expectations and teachings. For example, the expectation of the coming [[messiah]], the beatitudes of the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and much else of the early Christian movement are found to have existed within apocalyptic Judaism of the period.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9d6gq_bR1AIC&pg=PA28 The Dead Sea scrolls and Christian origins], [[Joseph Fitzmyer]], pp. 28ff</ref> This has had the effect of centering [[Early Christianity]] much more within its Jewish roots than was previously the case. It is now recognised that [[Rabbinical Judaism]] and ''Early Christianity'' are only two of the many strands which survived until the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish revolt]] of 66 to 70 CE;<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E7DF1E3BF932A35757C0A96E958260 | work=The New York Times | title=BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Looking for Jesus and Jews in the Dead Sea Scrolls | first=Richard | last=Bernstein | date=April 1, 1998 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>Shanks, Hershel "[https://archive.org/details/understandingdea00shan Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls: A Reader From the Biblical Archaeology Review]", archive.org</ref> see also [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism]].

Almost all historical critics agree that a historical figure named Jesus taught throughout the Galilean countryside c. 30 CE, was believed by his followers to have performed supernatural acts, and was sentenced to death by the Romans, possibly for insurrection.<ref name="A Marginal Jew 2">Meier, John P.

===Historicity of the Gospels===
{{main|Historical reliability of the Gospels}}
Most modern scholars hold that the canonical [[Gospel]] accounts were written between 70 and 100 or 110 CE,<ref name=r2>Mack, Burton (1996), "Who Wrote the New Testament?: The Making of the Christian Myth", Harper One, {{ISBN|0060655186}}</ref> four to eight decades after the crucifixion, although based on earlier traditions and texts, such as "[[Q document|Q]]", [[Logia]] or ''sayings gospels'', the passion account or other earlier literature (See [[List of Gospels]]). Some scholars argue that these accounts were compiled by witnesses<ref>Bauckham, Richard [https://books.google.com/books?id=zcVVp_YD4w4C&printsec=frontcover "Jesus and the Eyewitnesses,"] Wm. B.

Many scholars have pointed out that the [[Gospel of Mark]] shows signs of a lack of knowledge of geographical, political and religious matters in Judea in the time of Jesus. Thus, today the most common opinion is that the author is unknown and both geographically and historically at a distance to the narrated events,<ref>Analecta Romana Instituti Danici, Danske selskab, Copenhagen, Denmark, 1998.</ref><ref>Nineham, Dennis, ''Saint Mark'', Westminster Press, 1978, {{ISBN|0664213448}}, p. 193</ref><ref>McDonald, Lee Martin and Porter, Stanley.

===Historicity of Acts===
{{main|Historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles}}

Archaeological inscriptions and other independent sources show that Acts contains some accurate details of 1st century society with regard to titles of officials, administrative divisions, town assemblies, and rules of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem. However, the historicity of the depiction of [[Paul the Apostle]] in Acts is contested. Acts describes Paul differently from how Paul describes himself, both factually and theologically.<ref name=Brit>{{cite book |last1=Cain |first1=Seymour |display-authors=etal |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |chapter-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature/73440/The-Acts-of-the-Apostles?anchor=ref598122 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |language=en |chapter=Biblical literature}}</ref> Acts differs with Paul's letters on important issues, such as the [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Law]], Paul's own [[Apostle (Christian)#The Apostle to the Gentiles: Paul of Tarsus|apostleship]], and his relation to the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem church]].<ref name=Brit/> Scholars generally prefer Paul's account over that in Acts.<ref name=Harris>{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Stephen|author-link=Stephen L Harris |title=Understanding the Bible: A Reader's Introduction |date=1985 |publisher=Mayfield Pub.

==Schools of archaeological and historical thought==

===Overview of academic views===
An educated reading of the biblical text requires knowledge of when it was written, by whom, and for what purpose. For example, many academics would agree that the [[Pentateuch]] was in existence some time shortly after the 6th century [[Common Era|BCE]], but they disagree about when it was written. Proposed dates vary from the 15th century BCE to the 6th century BCE. One popular hypothesis points to the reign of [[Josiah]] (7th century BCE). In this hypothesis, the events of, for example, [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] would have happened centuries before they were finally edited. This topic is expanded upon in [[dating the Bible]].

An important point to keep in mind is the [[documentary hypothesis]], which, using the biblical evidence itself, claims to demonstrate that our current version is based on older written sources that are lost. Although it has been modified heavily over the years, some scholars accept some form of this hypothesis. There have also been and are a number of scholars who reject it, for example [[Egyptologist]] [[Kenneth Kitchen]]<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kitchen|first1=Kenneth|title=On the Reliability of the Old Testament|date=2006|publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company|location=Grand Rapids, MI|page=492}}</ref><ref name="isbn0-8028-4960-1">

===Maximalist–minimalist dichotomy===
There is great scholarly controversy on the historicity of events recounted in the Biblical narratives prior to the [[Babylonian captivity]] in the 6th century BCE. There is split between scholars who reject the biblical account of Ancient Israel as fundamentally ahistorical, and those who accept it as a largely reliable source of history—termed [[biblical minimalism|biblical minimalists]] and biblical maximalism|biblical maximalists]], respectively. The major split of biblical scholarship into two opposing schools is strongly disapproved by non-fundamentalist biblical scholars, as being an attempt by conservative Christians to portray the field as a bipolar argument, of which only one side is correct.<ref>Spong, John Shelby (1992) ''Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism'' (Harper)</ref>

Recently the difference between the Maximalist and Minimalist has reduced, and a new school started with a work, ''The Quest for the Historical Israel: Debating Archaeology and the History of Early Israel'' by [[Israel Finkelstein]], [[Amihai Mazar]], and Brian B. Schmidt.<ref name=r1 /> This school argues that post-processual archaeology enables us to recognize the existence of a middle ground between minimalism and maximalism, and that both these extremes need to be rejected. Archaeology offers both confirmation of parts of the biblical record and also poses challenges to the interpretations made by some. The careful examination of the evidence demonstrates that the historical accuracy of the first part of the Old Testament is greatest during the reign of [[Josiah]]. Some feel that the accuracy diminishes the further backwards one proceeds from this date. This, they claim, would confirm that a major redaction of the texts seems to have occurred at about that date.

===Biblical minimalism===
{{Main|Biblical minimalism}}
The viewpoint sometimes called Biblical minimalism generally holds that the Bible is principally a [[theology|theological]] and [[apologetics|apologetic]] work, and all stories within it are of an [[aetiology|aetiological]] character.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The early stories are held to have a historical basis that was reconstructed centuries later, and the stories possess at most only a few tiny fragments of genuine historical memory, which by their definition are only those points which are supported by archaeological discoveries. In this view, all of the stories about the biblical patriarchs are fictional, and the patriarchs mere legendary eponyms to describe later historical realities. Further, biblical minimalists hold that the [[Israelites|twelve tribes of Israel]] were a later construction, the stories of King David and King Saul were modeled upon later Irano-Hellenistic examples, and that there is no archaeological evidence that the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united Kingdom of Israel—]]<nowiki/>where the Bible says that David and Solomon ruled over an empire from the Euphrates to [[Eilath]]—ever existed. Archaeological evidence suggesting otherwise, such as the [[Mesha Stele]], is often rejected as allegorical.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

:It is hard to pinpoint when the movement started but 1968 seems to be a reasonable date. During this year, two prize-winning essays were written in Copenhagen; one by [[Niels Peter Lemche]], the other by [[Heike Friis]], which advocated a complete rethinking of the way we approach the Bible and attempt to draw historical conclusions from it.<ref>George Athas, 'Minimalism': The Copenhagen School of Thought in Biblical Studies, edited transcript of lecture, 3rd ed., University of Sydney, April 29, 1999.</ref>

In published books, one of the early advocates of the current school of thought known as biblical minimalism is Giovanni Garbini, ''Storia e ideologia nell'Israele antico'' (1986), translated into English as ''History and Ideology in Ancient Israel'' (1988).{{sfn|Garbini|1988}} In his footsteps followed [[Thomas L. Thompson]] with his lengthy ''Early History of the Israelite People: From the Written & Archaeological Sources'' (1992) and,{{sfn|Thompson|1992}} building explicitly on Thompson's book, P. R. Davies' shorter work, ''In Search of 'Ancient Israel''' (1992).{{sfn|Davies|1995}} In the latter, Davies finds historical Israel only in archaeological remains, biblical Israel only in scripture, and recent reconstructions of "ancient Israel" to be an unacceptable amalgam of the two. Thompson and Davies see the entire Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) as the imaginative creation of a small community of Jews at Jerusalem during the period which the Bible assigns to after the return from the Babylonian exile, from 539 BCE onward. [[Niels Peter Lemche]], Thompson's fellow faculty member at the [[University of Copenhagen]], also followed with several titles that show Thompson's influence, including ''The Israelites in history and tradition'' (1998). The presence of both Thompson and Lemche at the same institution has led to the use of the term "[[The Copenhagen School (theology)|Copenhagen school]]". The effect of biblical minimalism from 1992 onward was debate with more than two points of view.{{sfn|Mykytiuk|2010|p=76}}{{sfn|Brettler|2003|pp=1–21}}<ref>{{harvnb|Mykytiuk|2012|pp=101–137}} see the section "Toward a Balanced View of Minimalism: A Summary of Published Critiques"</ref>

===Biblical maximalism===
{{main|Biblical maximalism}}
There is great scholarly controversy on the historicity particularly of those events recounted in the Biblical narratives prior to the [[Babylonian captivity]] in the 6th century BCE. Regarding the debate over the historicity of ancient Israel, the maximalist position holds that the accounts of the United Monarchy and the early kings of Israel, [[David]] and [[Saul]], are to be taken as largely historical.<ref>[https://www.livius.org/th/theory/theory-maximalists.html "Maximalists and Minimalists"], ''Livius.org''.</ref>

===Decreasing conflict===
In 2001, [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] published ''[[The Bible Unearthed|The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts]]'' which advocated a view midway toward biblical minimalism and caused an uproar among many conservatives.{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001}} In the 25th anniversary issue of ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' (March/April 2001 edition), editor [[Hershel Shanks]] quoted several biblical scholars who insisted that minimalism was dying,<ref>Jack Cargill [http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ht/34.3/cargill.html Ancient Israel in Western Civ Textbooks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905162327/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ht/34.3/cargill.html |date=2005-09-05 }}. Quoting Amy Dockster Marcus about the minimalists: "The bottom line is that when it comes to the big picture, they are often right. Many of their ideas, once considered far-fetched, are now solidly mainstream concepts".</ref> although leading minimalists deny this and a claim has been made "We are all minimalists now" (an allusion to [[We are all Keynesians now]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ajtp.iusb.edu/Back%20Issues/January1993CompleteIssue.PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930192250/http://ajtp.iusb.edu/Back%20Issues/January1993CompleteIssue.PDF|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-09-30|title=''American Journal of Theology & Philosophy'' Vol. 14, No. 1 January 1993|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref>

{{quote|The fact is that we are all minimalists—at least, when it comes to the patriarchal period and the settlement.

In 2003, [[Kenneth Kitchen]], a scholar who adopts a more maximalist point of view, authored the book ''[[On the Reliability of the Old Testament]]''. Kitchen advocated the reliability of many (although not all) parts of the Torah and in no uncertain terms criticizes the work of Finkelstein and Silberman, to which Finkelstein has since responded.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Jennifer Wallace describes archaeologist Israel Finkelstein's view in her article "Shifting Ground in the Holy Land", appearing in ''Smithsonian Magazine'', May 2006:
{{quote|He ([[Israel Finkelstein]]) cites the fact—now accepted by most archaeologists—that many of the cities [[Joshua]] is supposed to have sacked in the late 13th century B.C. had ceased to exist by that time. [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]] was destroyed in the middle of that century, [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]] was abandoned before 2000 B.C. Even Jericho ([[Tell es-Sultan]]), where Joshua is said to have brought the walls tumbling down by circling the city seven times with blaring trumpets, was destroyed in 1500 B.C. Now controlled by the Palestinian Authority, the Jericho site consists of crumbling pits and trenches that testify to a century of fruitless digging.{{sfn|Wallace|2006|p=unpaginated}}<!--end quote-->}}

However, despite problems with the archaeological record, some maximalists place Joshua in the mid-second millennium, at about the time the Egyptian Empire came to rule over Canaan, and not the 13th century as Finkelstein or Kitchen claim, and view the destruction layers of the period as corroboration of the biblical account. The destruction of Hazor in the mid-13th century is seen as corroboration of the biblical account of the later destruction carried out by Deborah and Barak as recorded in the [[Book of Judges]]. The location that Finkelstein refers to as "Ai" is generally dismissed as the location of the biblical Ai, since it was destroyed and buried in the 3rd millennium. The prominent site has been known by that name since at least Hellenistic times, if not before. Minimalists all hold that dating these events as contemporary are [[etiology|etiological]] explanations written centuries after the events they claim to report.

Both Finkelstein and Silberman do accept that David and Solomon were really existing persons (not kings but bandit leaders or hill country chieftains)<ref>[http://www.bol.com/nl/p/engelse-boeken/david-and-solomon/1001004002970474/index.html#product_description David and Solomon] Beschrijving.

{{quote|The Bible reports that Jehoshaphat, a contemporary of Ahab, offered manpower and horses for the northern kingdom's wars against the Arameans. He strengthened his relationship with the northern kingdom by arranging a diplomatic marriage: the Israelite princess Athaliah, sister or daughter of King Ahab, married Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat (2 Kings 8:18). The house of David in Jerusalem was now directly linked to (and apparently dominated by) the Israelite royalty of Samaria. In fact, we might suggest that this represented the north's takeover by marriage of Judah. Thus in the ninth century BCE—nearly a century after the presumed time of David—we can finally point to the historical existence of a great united monarchy of Israel, stretching from Dan in the north to Beer-sheba in the south, with significant conquered territories in Syria and Transjordan. But this united monarchy—a real united monarchy—was ruled by the Omrides, not the Davidides, and its capital was Samaria, not Jerusalem.|Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman<ref name=realunitedmonarchy>{{harvnb|Finkelstein|Silberman|2006|p=103}}</ref>}}

Others, such as [[David Ussishkin]], argue that those who follow the biblical depiction of a United Monarchy do so on the basis of limited evidence while hoping to uncover real archaeological proof in the future.<ref>Ussishkin, David, "Solomon's Jerusalem: The Texts and the Facts on the Ground", in Vaughn Andrew G. and Killebrew, Ann E. eds. (2003), ''Jerusalem in Bible and Archaeology: The First Temple Period'' (SBL Symposium Series 18; Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature)</ref> Gunnar Lehmann suggests that there is still a possibility that David and Solomon were able to become local chieftains of some importance and claims that Jerusalem at the time was at best a small town in a sparsely populated area in which alliances of tribal kinship groups formed the basis of society. He goes on further to claim that it was at best a small regional centre, one of three to four in the territory of Judah and neither David nor Solomon had the manpower or the requisite social/political/administrative structure to rule the kind of empire described in the Bible.<ref>Lehrmann, Gunnar, "The United Monarchy in the Countryside: Jerusalem, Judah, and the Shephelah during the Tenth Century BCE", in Vaughn Andrew G. and Killebrew, Ann E. eds. (2003), ''Jerusalem in Bible and Archaeology: The First Temple Period'' (SBL Symposium Series 18; Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature)</ref>

These views are strongly criticized by [[William G. Dever]],{{sfn|Dever|2001|p=160}} [[Helga Weippert]], [[Amihai Mazar]] and [[Amnon Ben-Tor]].

[[André Lemaire]] states in ''Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple''{{sfn|Shanks|1999|p=113}} that the principal points of the biblical tradition with Solomon as generally trustworthy, as does [[Kenneth Kitchen]], who argue that Solomon ruled over a comparatively wealthy "mini-empire", rather than a small city-state.

Recently, Finkelstein has joined with the more conservative [[Amihai Mazar]] to explore the areas of agreement and disagreement and there are signs the intensity of the debate between the so-called minimalist and maximalist scholars is diminishing.<ref name=r1>{{harvnb|Finkelstein|Mazar|Schmidt|2007|p={{page needed|date=March 2016}} }}</ref> This view is also taken by [[Richard S. Hess]],<ref>Hess, Richard S. (2007) ''Israelite Religions: An Archaeological and Biblical Survey'', Baker Academic, {{ISBN|0801027179}}</ref> which shows there is in fact a plurality of views between maximalists and minimalists. Jack Cargill<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ht/34.3/cargill.html |title=Jack Cargill – Ancient Israel in Western Civ Textbooks – The History Teacher, 34.3 |accessdate=5 October 2014 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629123325/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ht/34.3/cargill.html |archive-date=29 June 2012 |date=2001-12-12 }}</ref> has shown that popular textbooks not only fail to give readers up-to-date archaeological evidence, but that they also fail to correctly represent the diversity of views present on the subject. Megan Bishop Moore and Brad E. Kelle provide an overview of the respective evolving approaches and attendant controversies, especially during the period from the mid-1980s through 2011, in their book ''Biblical History and Israel's Past''.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011}}
