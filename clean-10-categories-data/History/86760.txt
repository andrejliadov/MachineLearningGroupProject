The categorization of the past into discrete, quantified named blocks of time is called [[periodization]].<ref name="Rabinowtz">Adam Rabinowitz. And king''[https://www.academia.edu/6647852/Temporal_Divides_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Major_Schemes_of_Periodization_in_Indian_History It’s about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data]''. Study of the Ancient universe Papers, 2014.</ref> This is a list of such '''named time periods''' as defined in various fields of study. Major categorization systems include '''[[Chronology of the universe|cosmological]]''' (time periods in the [[Big Bang|origin]] and mass evolution of the universe), '''[[Geological time scale|geological]]''' (time periods in the [[history of Earth|origin and evolution]] of the Earth), '''[[Biological anthropology|anthropological]]''' and '''[[History|historical]]''' (time periods in the origin and evolution of human civilization).

== Human time periods ==
{{main|History by period}}

These can be divided broadly into prehistorical (before history began to be recorded) and historical periods (when written records began to be kept).
{{further|List of archaeological periods}}

In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], [[prehistory]] is subdivided around the [[three-age system]], this list includes the use of the three-age system as well as a number of various designation used in reference to sub-ages within the traditional three.

The dates for each age can vary by region. On the [[geologic time scale]], the [[Holocene]] epoch starts at the end of the [[last glacial period|last glacial period of the current ice age]] (c. 10,000 BCE) and continues to the present. The beginning of the Mesolithic is usually considered to correspond to the beginning of the [[Holocene]] epoch.

=== General periods ===
{{Further|Universal history}}
* '''[[Prehistory|Pre-History]]''' –  Period between the appearance of ''[[Homo]]'' ("humans"; [[Oldowan|first stone tools]] <abbr>c.</abbr> three million years ago) and the invention of writing systems (for the [[Ancient Near East]]: <abbr>c.</abbr> five thousand years ago).
**'''[[Stone Age]]''' 
***[[Paleolithic]] – is the earliest period of the Stone Age 
****[[Lower Paleolithic]] &mdash; time of [[archaic human]] species, predates ''[[Homo sapiens]]''
****[[Middle Paleolithic]] &mdash; coexistence of archaic and [[anatomically modern human]] species
****[[Upper Paleolithic]] &mdash; [[Early human migrations|worldwide expansion]] of anatomically modern humans, the disappearance of archaic humans by extinction or [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|admixture]] with modern humans; earliest [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|evidence for pictorial art]].
*** [[Mesolithic]] ([[Epipaleolithic]]) – was a period in the development of human technology between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods.
*** [[Neolithic]] – a period of primitive [[technological]] and [[social]] development, beginning about 10,200 BCE in parts of the Middle East, and later in other parts of the world.
*** [[Chalcolithic]] (or "Eneolithic", "Copper Age") – this period was still largely Neolithic in and civilizations who had adopted or developed a writing system. 
** [[Protohistory]] – Period between prehistory and history, during which a culture or civilization has not yet developed writing but other cultures have already noted its existence in their own writings; the absolute time scale of "protohistory" varies widely depending on the region, from the late 4th millennium BCE in the Ancient Near East to the present in the case of [[uncontacted peoples]].
* '''[[Ancient history|Ancient History]]''' – Aggregate of past events from the beginning of recorded human history and extending as far as the Early Middle Ages or the Postclassical Era. The span of [[recorded history]] is roughly less than five thousand years, beginning with the earliest linguistic records in the third millennium BCE in [[Sumer|Mesopotamia]] and [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|China]]
**'''[[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]]''' –  Broad term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], collectively known as the [[Greco-Roman world]]. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
* '''[[Post-classical history|Post-Classical History]]''' – Period of time that immediately followed ancient history.  Depending on the continent, the era generally falls between the years CE 200–600 and CE 1200–1500. The major classical civilizations the era follows are [[Han dynasty|Han China]] (ending in 220), the [[Western Roman Empire]] (in 476), the [[Gupta Empire]] (in the 550s), and the [[Sasanian Empire]] (in 651). 
** '''[[Middle Ages]]''' – Lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 and is variously demarcated by historians as ending with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, merging into the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Discovery]].
*** [[Early Middle Ages]] (also called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]])
*** [[High Middle Ages]]
*** [[Late Middle Ages]]
* '''[[Modern history|Modern History]]''' – After the post-classical era
**'''[[Early modern period|Early Modern Period]]''' – The chronological limits of this period are open to debate. It emerges from the [[Late Middle Ages]] (c. 1500), demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, in forms such as the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the West, the [[Ming Dynasty]] in the East, and the rise of the [[Aztec]] in the New World. The period ends with the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]].
** [[Modern history#Late modern period|'''Late Modern Period''']] – Began approximately in the mid-18th century; notable historical milestones included the [[French Revolution]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[Great Divergence]]
** '''[[Contemporary history|Contemporary History]]''' – History within living memory. It shifts forward with the generations, and today is the span of historic events from approximately 1945 that are immediately relevant to the present time. For example, the [[Post-Modern]] movement (the Soviet Union and the United States, 1973–present)

== Geologic time periods ==
{{main|Geologic time scale|List of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points}}
The [[geologic time scale]] covers the extent of the existence of Earth, from about 4600 million years ago to the present day. It is marked by [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points]]. Geologic time units are (in order of descending specificity) eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages; and the corresponding [[Chronostratigraphy|chronostratigraphic]] units, which measure "rock-time", are eonothems, erathems, systems, series, and stages.

The second and third timelines are each subsection of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks. The Cenozoic is sometimes divided into the [[Quaternary]] and [[Tertiary]] periods, although the latter is no longer used officially.

The categorization of the past into discrete, quantified named blocks of time is called [[periodization]].<ref name="Rabinowtz">Adam Rabinowitz. And king''[https://www.academia.edu/6647852/Temporal_Divides_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Major_Schemes_of_Periodization_in_Indian_History It’s about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data]''. Study of the Ancient universe Papers, 2014.</ref> This is a list of such '''named time periods''' as defined in various fields of study. Major categorization systems include '''[[Chronology of the universe|cosmological]]''' (time periods in the [[Big Bang|origin]] and mass evolution of the universe), '''[[Geological time scale|geological]]''' (time periods in the [[history of Earth|origin and evolution]] of the Earth), '''[[Biological anthropology|anthropological]]''' and '''[[History|historical]]''' (time periods in the origin and evolution of human civilization).

== Human time periods ==
{{main|History by period}}

These can be divided broadly into prehistorical (before history began to be recorded) and historical periods (when written records began to be kept).
{{further|List of archaeological periods}}

In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], [[prehistory]] is subdivided around the [[three-age system]], this list includes the use of the three-age system as well as a number of various designation used in reference to sub-ages within the traditional three.

The dates for each age can vary by region. On the [[geologic time scale]], the [[Holocene]] epoch starts at the end of the [[last glacial period|last glacial period of the current ice age]] (c. 10,000 BCE) and continues to the present. The beginning of the Mesolithic is usually considered to correspond to the beginning of the [[Holocene]] epoch.

=== General periods ===
{{Further|Universal history}}
* '''[[Prehistory|Pre-History]]''' –  Period between the appearance of ''[[Homo]]'' ("humans"; [[Oldowan|first stone tools]] <abbr>c.</abbr> three million years ago) and the invention of writing systems (for the [[Ancient Near East]]: <abbr>c.</abbr> five thousand years ago).
**'''[[Stone Age]]''' 
***[[Paleolithic]] – is the earliest period of the Stone Age 
****[[Lower Paleolithic]] &mdash; time of [[archaic human]] species, predates ''[[Homo sapiens]]''
****[[Middle Paleolithic]] &mdash; coexistence of archaic and [[anatomically modern human]] species
****[[Upper Paleolithic]] &mdash; [[Early human migrations|worldwide expansion]] of anatomically modern humans, the disappearance of archaic humans by extinction or [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|admixture]] with modern humans; earliest [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|evidence for pictorial art]].
*** [[Mesolithic]] ([[Epipaleolithic]]) – was a period in the development of human technology between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods.
*** [[Neolithic]] – a period of primitive [[technological]] and [[social]] development, beginning about 10,200 BCE in parts of the Middle East, and later in other parts of the world.
*** [[Chalcolithic]] (or "Eneolithic", "Copper Age") – this period was still largely Neolithic in and civilizations who had adopted or developed a writing system. 
** [[Protohistory]] – Period between prehistory and history, during which a culture or civilization has not yet developed writing but other cultures have already noted its existence in their own writings; the absolute time scale of "protohistory" varies widely depending on the region, from the late 4th millennium BCE in the Ancient Near East to the present in the case of [[uncontacted peoples]].
* '''[[Ancient history|Ancient History]]''' – Aggregate of past events from the beginning of recorded human history and extending as far as the Early Middle Ages or the Postclassical Era. The span of [[recorded history]] is roughly less than five thousand years, beginning with the earliest linguistic records in the third millennium BCE in [[Sumer|Mesopotamia]] and [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|China]]
**'''[[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]]''' –  Broad term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], collectively known as the [[Greco-Roman world]]. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
* '''[[Post-classical history|Post-Classical History]]''' – Period of time that immediately followed ancient history.  Depending on the continent, the era generally falls between the years CE 200–600 and CE 1200–1500. The major classical civilizations the era follows are [[Han dynasty|Han China]] (ending in 220), the [[Western Roman Empire]] (in 476), the [[Gupta Empire]] (in the 550s), and the [[Sasanian Empire]] (in 651). 
** '''[[Middle Ages]]''' – Lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 and is variously demarcated by historians as ending with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, merging into the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Discovery]].
*** [[Early Middle Ages]] (also called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]])
*** [[High Middle Ages]]
*** [[Late Middle Ages]]
* '''[[Modern history|Modern History]]''' – After the post-classical era
**'''[[Early modern period|Early Modern Period]]''' – The chronological limits of this period are open to debate. It emerges from the [[Late Middle Ages]] (c. 1500), demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, in forms such as the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the West, the [[Ming Dynasty]] in the East, and the rise of the [[Aztec]] in the New World. The period ends with the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]].
** [[Modern history#Late modern period|'''Late Modern Period''']] – Began approximately in the mid-18th century; notable historical milestones included the [[French Revolution]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[Great Divergence]]
** '''[[Contemporary history|Contemporary History]]''' – History within living memory. It shifts forward with the generations, and today is the span of historic events from approximately 1945 that are immediately relevant to the present time. For example, the [[Post-Modern]] movement (the Soviet Union and the United States, 1973–present)

== Geologic time periods ==
{{main|Geologic time scale|List of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points}}
The [[geologic time scale]] covers the extent of the existence of Earth, from about 4600 million years ago to the present day. It is marked by [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points]]. Geologic time units are (in order of descending specificity) eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages; and the corresponding [[Chronostratigraphy|chronostratigraphic]] units, which measure "rock-time", are eonothems, erathems, systems, series, and stages.

The second and third timelines are each subsection of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks. The Cenozoic is sometimes divided into the [[Quaternary]] and [[Tertiary]] periods, although the latter is no longer used officially.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Time Period !! Duration !! Description
|-
| '''[[Planck epoch|Planck Epoch]]''' || ''From the start to 10<sup>−43</sup> seconds after the Big Bang'' || Very little concrete [confirmed] information is known about this epoch. Different theories propose different views on this particular time.
|-
| '''[[Grand unification epoch|Grand Unification Epoch]]''' || ''Between 10<sup>−43</sup> to 10<sup>−36</sup> seconds after the Big Bang'' || The result of the universe expanding and cooling down during the Planck epoch. All [[fundamental forces]] except gravity are unified.
|-
| '''[[Electroweak epoch|Electroweak Epoch]]''' || ''Between 10<sup>−36</sup> seconds to 10<sup>−12</sup> seconds after the Big Bang'' || The universe cools down to 10<sup>28</sup> [[kelvin]]. The fundamental forces are split into the [[strong force]] and the [[electroweak force]].
|-
| '''[[Inflationary epoch|Inflationary Epoch]]''' || ''Between 10<sup>−36</sup> seconds to 10<sup>−32</sup> seconds after the Big Bang'' || The shape of the universe flattens due to [[cosmic inflation]].
|-
| '''[[Quark epoch|Quark Epoch]]''' || ''Between 10<sup>−12</sup> seconds to 10<sup>−6</sup> seconds after the Big Bang'' || [[Cosmic inflation]] has ended. [[Quarks]] are present in the universe at this point. The electroweak force is divided again into the [[weak force]] and [[electromagnetic force]].
|-
| '''[[Hadron epoch|Hadron Epoch]]''' || ''Between 10<sup>−6</sup> seconds to 1 second after the Big Bang'' || The universe has cooled enough for [[quarks]] to form [[hadrons]], [[protons]], [[neutrons]].
|-
| '''[[Lepton epoch|Lepton Epoch]]''' || ''Between 1 second to 10 seconds after the Big Bang'' || Most [[hadrons]] and anti-hadrons annihilate each other, leaving behind [[leptons]] and anti-leptons.
|-
| '''[[Photon epoch|Photon Epoch]]''' || ''Between 10 seconds to 370,000 years after the Big Bang'' || Most [[leptons]] and anti-leptons annihilate each other. The universe is dominated by [[photons]].
|-
|'''[[Nucleosynthesis]]'''||''Between 3 minutes to 20 minutes after the Big Bang'' || The temperature of the universe has cooled down enough to allow [[atomic nuclei]] to form via [[nuclear fusion]].
|-
| '''[[Recombination (cosmology)|Recombination]]''' || ''About 377,000 years after the Big Bang'' || [[Hydrogen]] and [[helium]] atoms form.
|-
|'''[[Reionization]]'''||''Between 150 million and 1 billion years after the Big Bang'' || The first [[stars]] and [[quasars]] form due to [[gravitational collapse]].
