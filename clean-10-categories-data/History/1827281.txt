==By ideological classification (historiography)==
Although there is arguably some intrinsic [[bias]] in history studies (with [[nationalism|national]] bias perhaps being the most significant), history can also be studied from [[ideology|ideological]] perspectives, which practitioners feel are often ignored, such as:
*[[Marxist historiography]]
*[[Feminist history]] (also called ''herstory'').

A form of historical speculation known commonly as [[counterfactual history]] has also been adopted by some historians as a means of assessing and exploring the possible outcomes if certain events had not occurred or had occurred in a different way. This is somewhat similar to the [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] genre in fiction.

Lists of false or dubious historical resources and [[historical myths]] that were once popular and widespread, or have become so, have also been prepared.
