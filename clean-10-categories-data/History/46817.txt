Vesuvius has erupted many times since, and is the only volcano on the European mainland to have erupted within the last hundred years. Today, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the population of 3,000,000 people living near enough to be affected by an eruption, with 600,000 in the danger zone, making it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world, as well as its tendency towards violent, explosive eruptions of the [[Plinian eruption|Plinian]] type.<ref name=mcguire2003>{{cite news |first=Bill |last=McGuire |title=In the shadow of the volcano |date=16 October 2003 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/oct/16/research.highereducation2 |accessdate=8 May 2010 }}</ref>

==Mythology==
Vesuvius has a long historic and literary tradition. It was considered a divinity of the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]] type at the time of the eruption of AD 79: it appears under the inscribed name Vesuvius as a serpent in the decorative [[fresco]]s of many ''{{lang|la|lararia}}'', or household shrines, surviving from [[Pompeii]]. An inscription from [[Capua]]<ref>CIL x.1, 3806.</ref> to {{lang|la|IOVI VESVVIO}} indicates that he was worshipped as a power of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]; that is, ''Jupiter Vesuvius''.<ref>{{harvnb|Waldstein|1908|p=97}}</ref>

The Romans regarded Mount Vesuvius to be devoted to [[Hercules]].<ref>{{cite book |publisher=The Illustrated History of Natural Disasters |last1=Kozák |first1=Jan |last2=Cermák |title=The Illustrated History of Natural Disasters |first2=Vladimir |year=2010 |pages=45–54 |isbn=978-90-481-3325-3|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-3325-3_3 |chapter=Vesuvius-Somma Volcano, Bay of Naples, Italy }}</ref> The historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] relates a tradition that Hercules, in the performance of his labors, passed through the country of nearby [[Cumae]] on his way to [[Sicily]] and found there a place called "the Phlegraean Plain" ([[Phlegraean Fields|''Φλεγραῖον πεδίον'']], "plain of fire"), "from a hill which anciently vomited out fire ... now called Vesuvius."<ref>Book IV, Chapter 21.</ref> It was inhabited by bandits, "the sons of the Earth," who were giants. With the assistance of the gods he pacified the region and went on. The facts behind the tradition, if any, remain unknown, as does whether {{lang|la|[[Herculaneum]]}} was named after it. An [[epigram]] by the poet [[Martial]] in 88 AD suggests that both [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], patroness of Pompeii, and Hercules were worshipped in the region devastated by the eruption of 79.<ref>{{harvnb|Waldstein|1908|p=108}} re Epigram IV line 44.</ref>

==Etymology==
''{{lang|la|Vesuvius}}'' was a name of the volcano in frequent use by the authors of the late [[Roman Republic]] and the early [[Roman Empire]]. Its [[synonym|collateral forms]] were ''{{lang|la|Vesaevus}}'', ''{{lang|la|Vesevus}}'', ''{{lang|la|Vesbius}}'' and ''{{lang|la|Vesvius}}''.<ref name=Lewis>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Vesuvius |first=Charlton T. |last=Lewis |first2=Charles |last2=Short |location=Medford, MA |publisher=The Perseus Project, Tufts University |year=2010 |orig-year=1879 |encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=Vesuvius&highlight=vesuvius }}</ref> Writers in ancient Greek used {{lang|grc|Οὐεσούιον}} or {{lang|grc|Οὐεσούιος}}. Many scholars since then have offered an [[etymology]]. As peoples of varying ethnicity and language occupied [[Campania]] in the [[Roman Iron Age]], the etymology depends to a large degree on the presumption of what language was spoken there at the time. Naples was settled by Greeks, as the name ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Nea-polis}}'', "New City", testifies. The [[Oscans]], an [[Italic languages|Italic]] people, lived in the countryside. The [[Latin language|Latins]] also competed for the occupation of Campania. [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] settlements were in the vicinity. Other peoples of unknown provenance are said to have been there at some time by various ancient authors.

Some theories about its origin are:
* From Greek {{lang|grc|οὔ}} = "not" prefixed to a root from or related to the Greek word {{lang|grc|σβέννυμι}} = "I quench", in the sense of "unquenchable".<ref name=Lewis/><ref>{{cite book |title=Vesuvius |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.48517 |first=John |last=Phillips|pages=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.48517/page/n103 7]–9 |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1869 }}</ref>

==Appearance==

Vesuvius is a "humpbacked" peak, consisting of a large [[volcanic cone|cone]] (''Gran Cono'') partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit [[caldera]] caused by the collapse of an earlier (and originally much higher) structure called [[Mount Somma]].<ref name="OS storia">{{cite web | url = http://www.ov.ingv.it/inglese/vesuvio/storia/storia.htm | title = Summary of the eruptive history of Mt.

Vesuvius is still regarded as an active volcano, although its current activity produces little more than sulfur-rich steam from vents at the bottom and walls of the crater. Vesuvius is a stratovolcano at the [[convergent boundary]] where the [[African Plate]] is being [[subduction|subducted]] beneath the [[Eurasian Plate]].

==Formation==
Vesuvius was formed as a result of the collision of two [[tectonic plate]]s, the [[African Plate|African]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]]. The former was [[Subduction|subducted]] beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and lowered the melting point of the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]] enough to partially melt the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

The volcano is one of several which form the [[Campanian volcanic arc]]. Others include [[Campi Flegrei]], a large [[caldera]] a few kilometers to the north west, [[Mount Epomeo]], {{convert|20|km}} to the west on the island of [[Ischia]], and several undersea volcanoes to the south. The arc forms the southern end of a larger chain of volcanoes produced by the [[subduction]] process described above, which extends northwest along the length of Italy as far as [[Monte Amiata]] in Southern [[Tuscany]]. Vesuvius is the only one to have erupted within recent history, although some of the others have erupted within the last few hundred years. Many are either extinct or have not erupted for tens of thousands of years.

==Eruptions==
{{Decade Volcanoes Map}}
[[File:Procession des reliques de Saint Janvier en 1822.jpg|thumb|Procession of [[Januarius|Saint Januarius]] during an eruption of Vesuvius in 1822]]
Mount Vesuvius has erupted many times. The eruption in AD 79 was preceded by numerous others in prehistory, including at least three significantly larger ones, including the [[Avellino eruption]] around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and there may have been eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500.<ref name = "global volcanism"/>
The volcano erupted again in 1631, six times in the 18th century (including 1779 and 1794), eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929 and 1944. There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one.

The eruptions vary greatly in severity but are characterized by explosive outbursts of the kind dubbed [[Plinian Eruption|Plinian]] after [[Pliny the Younger]], a Roman writer who published a detailed description of the AD 79 eruption, including his uncle's death.<ref>Pliny the Younger, ''Letters'' [http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1065.html 6.16].</ref> On occasion, eruptions from Vesuvius have been so large that the whole of southern Europe has been blanketed by ash; in 472 and 1631, Vesuvian ash fell on [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]), over {{convert|1200|km}} away. A few times since 1944, landslides in the crater have raised clouds of ash dust, raising false alarms of an eruption.

Since 1750, seven of the eruptions of Vesuvius have had durations of more than 5 years, more than any other volcano except Etna. The two most recent eruptions of Vesuvius (1875–1906 and 1913–1944) both lasted more than 30 years.<ref name="GVPDatabase2020-12">{{cite web | url=https://volcano.si.edu/faq/index.cfm?question=longesteruptions | title=What volcanoes have had the longest eruptions? | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] | work=[[Global Volcanism Program]] — Volcanoes of the World (version 4.9.2) | editor-last=Venzke | editor-first=E. | date=10 December 2020 | doi=10.5479/si.GVP.VOTW4-2013 | accessdate=15 December 2020}}</ref>

Scientific knowledge of the geologic history of Vesuvius comes from [[core sample]]s taken from a {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} plus bore hole on the flanks of the volcano, extending into [[Mesozoic]] rock. Cores were dated by [[K–Ar dating|potassium–argon]] and [[argon–argon dating]].<ref>{{harvnb|Guest|2003|p=45}}</ref> The area has been subject to volcanic activity for at least 400,000 years; the lowest layer of eruption material from the Somma caldera lies on top of the 40,000 year‑old [[Campania]]n [[ignimbrite]] produced by the [[Campi Flegrei]] complex.
*25,000 years ago: Vesuvius started forming in the Codola [[Plinian eruption]].<ref name="OS storia"/>
*Vesuvius was then built up by a series of lava flows, with some smaller explosive eruptions interspersed between them.
*About 19,000 years ago: the style of eruption changed to a sequence of large explosive Plinian eruptions, of which the AD 79 one was the most recent. The eruptions are named after the [[tephra]] deposits produced by them, which in turn are named after the place where the deposits were first identified:<ref>{{harvnb|Guest|2003|p=47}}</ref>
* 18,300 years ago: the Basal Pumice (Pomici di Base) eruption, [[volcanic explosivity index|VEI]]&nbsp;6, the original formation of the Somma caldera. The eruption was followed by a period of much less violent, lava-producing eruptions.<ref name="OS Pomici di Base"/>
* 16,000 years ago: the Green Pumice (Pomici Verdoline) eruption, VEI 5.<ref name="OS storia"/>
* Around 11,000 years ago: the Lagno Amendolare eruption, smaller than the Mercato eruption.
* 8,000 years ago: the [[Mercato eruption]] (Pomici di Mercato) – also known as Pomici Gemelle or Pomici Ottaviano, [[volcanic explosivity index|VEI]] 6.<ref name="OS storia"/>
* Around 5,000 years ago: two explosive eruptions smaller than the Avellino eruption.
* 3,800 years ago: the [[Avellino eruption]] (Pomici di Avellino), VEI 6; its vent was apparently {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the current crater and the eruption destroyed several [[Bronze Age]] settlements of the [[Apennine culture]]. Several [[carbon dating|carbon dates]] on wood and bones offer a range of possible dates of about 500 years in the mid-2nd millennium BC. In May 2001, near [[Nola]], Italian archaeologists using the technique of filling every cavity with plaster or substitute compound recovered some remarkably well-preserved forms of perishable objects, such as fence rails, a bucket and especially in the vicinity thousands of human footprints pointing into the Apennines to the north. The settlement had huts, pots and goats. The residents had hastily abandoned the village, leaving it to be buried under [[pumice]] and [[Volcanic ash|ash]] in much the same way that Pompeii and Herculaneum were later preserved.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.meridies-nola.org/nola/villaggiopreistoricoing.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120618235308/http://www.meridies-nola.org/nola/villaggiopreistoricoing.htm | archive-date = 18 June 2012 | title = An ancient Bronze Age village (3500 bp) destroyed by the pumice eruption in Avellino (Nola-Campania) | first = Claude Albore | last = Livadie | publisher = Meridie | accessdate = 8 December 2006 | url-status=dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.buffalo.edu/news/fast-execute.cgi/article-page.html?article=78030009 | title = Vesuvius' Next Eruption May Put Metro Naples at Risk – Lesson from Katrina is need to focus on "maximum probable hazard" |work= State University of New York | accessdate = 8 December 2006 }}</ref> [[Pyroclastic surge]] deposits were distributed to the northwest of the vent, travelling as far as {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} from it, and lie up to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep in the area now occupied by [[Naples]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ov.ingv.it/inglese/vesuvio/storia/avellino.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100918021855/http://www.ov.ingv.it/inglese/vesuvio/storia/avellino.htm | archive-date = 18 September 2010 | title = Pomici di Avellino eruption | work = Osservatorio Vesuviano, Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology | accessdate= 8 December 2006}}</ref>

* The volcano was then quiet (for 295 years, if the 217 BC date for the last previous eruption is true) and was described by [[Roman literature|Roman]] writers as having been covered with gardens and [[vineyard]]s, except at the top, which was craggy. The volcano may have had only one summit at that time, judging by a wall painting, "Bacchus and Vesuvius", found in a Pompeian house, the [[House of the Centenary]] (''Casa del Centenario'').
Several surviving works written over the 200&nbsp;years preceding the AD 79 eruption describe the mountain as having had a volcanic nature, although Pliny the Elder did not depict the mountain in this way in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'':<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+toc|author=Pliny the Elder|title=The Natural History|translator-last1=Bostock|translator-first1=John|translator-last2=Riley|translator-first2=Henry Thomas|translator-link2=Henry Thomas Riley}}</ref>
* The Greek historian [[Strabo]] (ca 63 BC–AD 24) described the mountain in Book V, Chapter 4 of his ''[[Geographica]]''<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5D*.html|author=Strabo|title=Geography|volume=Book V|chapter=Chapter 4}}</ref> as having a predominantly flat, barren summit covered with sooty, ash-coloured rocks and suggested that it might once have had "craters of fire". He also perceptively suggested that the fertility of the surrounding slopes may be due to volcanic activity, as at Mount Etna.

===Eruption of AD 79===
{{main|Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD}}

In AD 79 Vesuvius erupted in one of the [[List of natural disasters by death toll|most catastrophic]] eruptions of all time. Historians have learned about the eruption from the [[Witness|eyewitness]] account of [[Pliny the Younger]], a Roman administrator and poet.<ref name= BBCportents /> In the surviving copies of the letters several dates are given.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.getty.edu/iris/when-did-vesuvius-erupt-august-october-24/|title=When Did Vesuvius Erupt?

====Precursors and foreshocks====
The AD 79 eruption was preceded by a [[62 Pompeii earthquake|powerful earthquake in 62]], which caused widespread destruction around the Bay of Naples, and particularly to Pompeii.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Martini |first=Kirk |title= Patterns of Reconstruction at Pompeii |date=September 1998 |publisher=Pompeii Forum Project, Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH), University of Virginia | chapter = 2: Identifying Potential Damage Events |chapter-url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/struct/pompeii/patterns/sec-02.html }}</ref> Some of the damage had still not been repaired when the volcano erupted.<ref name= VisitingPompeii /> The deaths of 600 sheep from "tainted air" in the vicinity of Pompeii indicates that the earthquake of AD 62 may have been related to new activity by Vesuvius.{{Sfn |Sigurdsson|2002|p=35 | ps = on Seneca the Younger, ''Natural Questions'', 6.1, 6.27.}}

The Romans grew accustomed to minor earth tremors in the region; the writer [[Pliny the Younger]] even wrote that they "were not particularly alarming because they are frequent in Campania". Small earthquakes started taking place four days before the eruption<ref name=VisitingPompeii>{{cite web | url = http://www.archaeology.co.uk/cwa-2/world-features/visiting-pompeii.htm | title = Visiting Pompeii – AD 79 – Vesuvius explodes | first = Rick | last = Jones | work = Current Archeology | year = 2004–2010 | publisher = Current Publishing | location = London | accessdate = 27 May 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120308100010/http://www.archaeology.co.uk/cwa-2/world-features/visiting-pompeii.htm | archive-date = 8 March 2012 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> becoming more frequent over the next four days, but the warnings were not recognized.{{Efn | The dates of the earthquakes and of the eruption are contingent on a final determination of the time of year, but there is no reason to change the relative sequence.}}

====Scientific analysis====
[[File:Mt Vesuvius 79 AD eruption.svg|left|thumb|Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as other cities affected by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The black cloud represents the general distribution of ash, pumice and cinders. Modern coast lines are shown.]]
Reconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In the middle of the day an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day [[pyroclastic surge]]s in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild [[tsunami]] in the Bay of Naples. By late afternoon of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.

The latest scientific studies of the ash produced by Vesuvius reveals a multi-phase eruption.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigurdsson|2002}}</ref> The initial major explosion produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between {{convert|15|and|30|km|ft}} high, which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind. The chief energy supporting the column came from the escape of steam superheated by the magma, created from seawater seeping over time into the deep faults of the region, that came into interaction with magma and heat.

Subsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases expanded and lost their capability to support their solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Plinian and Peléan six times. Surges 3 and 4 are believed by the authors to have buried Pompeii.<ref>{{harvnb|Sigurdsson|2002|pp=42–43}}</ref> Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.

Another study used the magnetic characteristics of over 200 samples of roof-tile and plaster fragments collected around Pompeii to estimate equilibrium temperature of the pyroclastic flow.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=5}}</ref> The magnetic study revealed that on the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to {{convert|3|cm|in}} fell for several hours.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=3}}</ref> It heated the roof tiles up to {{convert|140|C}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=12}}</ref> This period would have been the last opportunity to escape.

The collapse of the Plinian columns on the second day caused pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) that devastated Herculaneum and Pompeii. The depositional temperature of these pyroclastic surges ranged up to {{convert|300|C}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=13}}</ref> Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as {{convert|100|C}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zanella|2007|p=14}}</ref>

====The two Plinys====
The only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian [[Tacitus]].<ref name=epistularum>{{cite book|author=C. Plinii Caecilii Secundi|title= Epistularum|section=Liber Sextus; 16 & 20|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/pliny.ep6.html|publisher=The Latin Library}}</ref> Pliny the Younger describes, amongst other things, the last days in the life of his uncle, [[Pliny the Elder]]. Observing the first volcanic activity from [[Misenum]] across the Bay of Naples from the volcano, approximately {{convert|35|km}}, the elder Pliny launched a rescue fleet and went himself to the rescue of a personal friend. His nephew declined to join the party. One of the nephew's letters relates what he could discover from witnesses of his uncle's experiences.<ref name=Pliny1>{{cite journal|author=Pliny the Younger|editor=Charles W.

The two men saw an extraordinarily dense cloud rising rapidly above the peak. This cloud and a request by a messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous [[tsunami|wave action]] in the [[Bay of Naples]].

The early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to [[Lightning#Sheet lightning|sheet lightning]], but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia ([[Capri]]) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.

Pliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was in command of the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/pompeii/PlinyLetters.htm|title=Pliny Letter 6.16|access-date=11 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511070405/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/pompeii/PlinyLetters.htm|archive-date=11 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.

He set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back, he stated "Fortune favors the brave" and ordered him to continue on to [[Stabiae]] (about 4.5 kilometers from Pompeii).

Pliny the Elder and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://volcanology.geol.ucsb.edu/pliny.htm |authors=Richard V.

In the first letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger suggested that his uncle's death was due to the reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16&nbsp;km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of [[Castellammare di Stabia]] is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so it is more likely that the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/lecture19/lec19.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718082232/http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/history/lecture19/lec19.html |archive-date=18 July 2012 |title=Lecture 19: Greek, Carthaginian and Roman Agricultural Writers |work=History of Horticulture |year=2002 |first=Jules |last=Janick |publisher=Purdue University |accessdate=15 May 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.
====Casualties====
[[File:Pompeii&Vesuvius.JPG|thumb|Pompeii, with Vesuvius towering above]]

Along with Pliny the Elder, the only other noble casualties of the eruption to be known by name were Agrippa (a son of the Herodian Jewish princess [[Drusilla (daughter of Agrippa I)|Drusilla]] and the procurator [[Antonius Felix]]) and his wife.<ref>{{cite book|first=Flavius|last=Josephus|author-link=Josephus|title=Jewish Antiquities |section= xx.7.2|year=94<!-- 94 AD is the real date -->    |title-link=Jewish Antiquities}} Also known to have been mentioned in a section now lost.</ref>

By 2003, around 1,044&nbsp;casts made from impressions of bodies in the ash deposits had been recovered in and around Pompeii, with the scattered bones of another 100.<ref name="Episodes">{{cite journal |journal= Episodes |volume= 26 |date= September 2003 |url= http://vulcan.fis.uniroma3.it/lavori/episodes.pdf |title= The eruption of Vesuvius of 79 AD and its impact on human environment in Pompei |first1= Lisetta |last1= Giacomelli |first2= Annamaria |last2= Perrotta |first3= Roberto |last3= Scandone |first4= Claudio |last4= Scarpati |issue= 3 |pages= 235–238 |accessdate= 12 May 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110117200703/http://vulcan.fis.uniroma3.it/lavori/episodes.pdf |archive-date= 17 January 2011 |url-status=dead |df= mdy-all |doi= 10.18814/epiiugs/2003/v26i3/014 }}</ref> The remains of about 332 bodies have been found at Herculaneum (300 in arched vaults discovered in 1980).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fieldmuseum.org/pompeii/herculaneum_2.asp | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090318012551/http://www.fieldmuseum.org/pompeii/herculaneum_2.asp | archive-date = 18 March 2009 | title = Pompeii, Stories from an eruption: Herculaneum | year=2007|publisher = The Field Museum of Natural History |location=Chicago | work = Soprintendenza archeologica di Pompei| accessdate = 12 May 2010}}</ref> What percentage these numbers are of the total dead or the percentage of the dead to the total number at risk remain completely unknown.

Thirty-eight percent of the 1,044 were found in the ash fall deposits, the majority inside buildings. These are thought to have been killed mainly by roof collapses, with the smaller number of victims found outside of buildings probably being killed by falling roof slates or by larger rocks thrown out by the volcano. The remaining 62% of remains found at Pompeii were in the pyroclastic surge deposits,<ref name="Episodes" /> and thus were probably killed by them – probably from a combination of suffocation through ash inhalation and blast and debris thrown around. In contrast to the victims found at Herculaneum, examination of cloth, frescoes and skeletons show that it is unlikely that high temperatures were a significant cause. Herculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under {{convert |23|m}} of material deposited by pyroclastic surges. It is likely that most, or all, of the known victims in this town were killed by the surges.

People caught on the former seashore by the first surge died of thermal shock. The rest were concentrated in arched chambers at a density of as high as 3 persons per square metre. As only {{convert|85|m|ft}} of the coast have been excavated, casualties may be waiting to be excavated.

===Later eruptions from the 3rd to the 19th centuries===

[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby - Vesuvius from Portici.jpg|right|thumb|[[Vesuvius in Eruption (Wright painting)|An eruption of Vesuvius seen from Portici]], by [[Joseph Wright of Derby|Joseph Wright]] (ca. 1774-6)]]
Since the eruption of AD 79, Vesuvius has erupted around three dozen times.
* It erupted again in 203, during the lifetime of the historian [[Cassius Dio]].
* In 472, it ejected such a volume of ash that ashfalls were reported as far away as [[Constantinople]].
* The eruptions of 512 were so severe that those inhabiting the slopes of Vesuvius were granted exemption from taxes by [[Theodoric the Great]], the [[Goths|Gothic]] king of Italy.
* Further eruptions were recorded in 787, 968, 991, 999, 1007 and 1036 with the first recorded [[lava flows]].

The volcano became quiescent at the end of the 13th century and in the following years it again became covered with gardens and vineyards as of old. Even the inside of the crater was moderately filled with shrubbery.

* Vesuvius entered a new phase in December 1631, when a major eruption buried many villages under lava flows, killing around 3,000 people. Torrents of [[lahar]] were also created, adding to the devastation. Activity thereafter became almost continuous, with relatively severe eruptions occurring in 1660, 1682, 1694, 1698, 1707, 1737, 1760, 1767, 1779, 1794, 1822, 1834, 1839, 1850, 1855, 1861, 1868, 1872, 1906, 1926, 1929, and 1944.

===Future===

Large Vesuvian eruptions which emit volcanic material in quantities of about {{convert|1|km3}}, the most recent of which overwhelmed Pompeii and Herculaneum, have happened after periods of inactivity of a few thousand years. Sub-Plinian eruptions producing about {{convert|0.1|km3}}, such as those of 472 and 1631, have been more frequent with a few hundred years between them. From the 1631 eruption until 1944, there was a comparatively small eruption every few years, emitting 0.001–0.01&nbsp;km³ of magma. It seems that for Vesuvius, the amount of magma expelled in an eruption increases very roughly linearly with the interval since the previous one, and at a rate of around {{convert|0.001|km3}} for each year.<ref name="Italian Volcanoes">{{cite book| title=Italian Volcanoes| publisher=Terra Publishing| year=2001 |author1=Kilburn, Chris  |author2=McGuire, Bill |name-list-style=amp | isbn=978-1-903544-04-4}}</ref> This gives an approximate figure of {{convert|0.075|km3}} for an eruption after 75&nbsp;years of inactivity.

Magma sitting in an underground [[magma chamber|chamber]] for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as [[olivine]] crystallizing out. The effect is to increase the concentration of dissolved gases (mostly [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[carbon dioxide]]) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an [[eruption]], the huge drop in [[internal pressure]] caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of [[felsic]] components such as [[silicate]]s potentially making the magma more [[viscous]], adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.

[[File:Naplesbay01.jpg|thumb|left|The area around the volcano is now densely populated.]]
The government emergency plan for an eruption therefore assumes that the worst case will be an eruption of similar size and type to the 1631 [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] 4<ref>{{cite web | url= http://vulcan.fis.uniroma3.it/vesuvio/VESUVIO_1631-1944.html | title= Activity of Vesuvio between 1631 and 1799 | work= Esplora i Vulcani Italiani | date= 1996–2009 | author= Giacomelli, L. | author2= Scandone, R. | publisher= Dipartimento di Fisica E.

In this scenario, the slopes of the volcano, extending out to about {{convert|7|km}} from the vent, may be exposed to pyroclastic surges sweeping down them, whilst much of the surrounding area could suffer from tephra falls. Because of [[prevailing winds]], towns and cities to the south and east of the volcano are most at risk from this, and it is assumed that tephra accumulation exceeding {{convert|100|kg/m²}}—at which point people are at risk from collapsing roofs—may extend out as far as [[Avellino]] to the east or [[Salerno]] to the south-east. Towards Naples, to the north west, this tephra fall hazard is assumed to extend barely past the slopes of the volcano.<ref name = "Italian Volcanoes"/> The specific areas actually affected by the ash cloud depend upon the particular circumstances surrounding the eruption.

The plan assumes between two weeks' and 20 days' notice of an eruption and foresees the [[emergency evacuation]] of 600,000&nbsp;people, almost entirely comprising all those living in the ''[[Vesuvius red zone|zona rossa]]'' ("red zone"), i.e. at greatest risk from pyroclastic flows.<ref name=mcguire2003/><ref name = "USA today 21-10-03"/> The evacuation, by train, [[ferry]], [[car]], and bus, is planned to take about seven days, and the evacuees would mostly be sent to other parts of the country rather than to safe areas in the local [[Campania]] region, and may have to stay away for several months. However, the dilemma that would face those implementing the plan is when to start this massive evacuation: If it starts too late, thousands could be killed; whereas if it is started too early, the indicators of an eruption may turn out to be a [[false alarm]]. In 1984, 40,000&nbsp;people were evacuated from the [[Campi Flegrei]] area, another volcanic complex near Naples, but no eruption occurred.<ref name = "USA today 21-10-03"/>

Ongoing efforts are being made by the government at various levels (especially of [[Campania]]) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings<ref name="USA today 21-10-03">{{cite news | url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-10-20-vesuvius-usat_x.htm | title= Italians trying to prevent a modern Pompeii | first = Ellen | last = Hale | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | date = 21 October 2003 |accessdate = 8 May 2010 | publisher = Gannett Co.

The volcano is closely monitored by the [[Vesuvius Observatory|Osservatorio Vesuvio]] in Naples with extensive networks of seismic and gravimetric stations, a combination of a [[GPS]]-based geodetic array and [[satellite]]-based [[synthetic aperture radar]] to measure ground movement and by local [[geophysical survey|surveys]] and chemical analyses of gases emitted from [[fumarole]]s. All of this is intended to track magma rising underneath the volcano. No magma has been detected within 10&nbsp;km of the surface, and so the volcano is classified by the Observatory as at a Basic or Green Level.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.ov.ingv.it/inglese/vesuvio/vesuvio.htm | title= Vesuvius | location=Naples|publisher = Osservatorio Vesuviano, Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology | accessdate =8 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502075328/http://www.ov.ingv.it/inglese/vesuvio/vesuvio.htm <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archive-date=2 May 2010}}</ref>

The area around Vesuvius was officially declared a [[Vesuvius National Park|national park]] on 5 June 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title=The National Park|url=http://www.vesuvioinrete.it/e_parco.htm|publisher=Vesuvioinrete.it|date=2001–2010|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> The summit of Vesuvius is open to visitors and there is a small network of paths around the volcano that are maintained by the park authorities on weekends. There is access by road to within {{convert|200|m}} of the summit (measured vertically), but thereafter access is on foot only. There is a spiral walkway around the volcano from the road to the crater.

=="Funiculì, Funiculà"==

The first [[funicular]] cable car on Mount Vesuvius opened in 1880. It was later destroyed by the March 1944 eruption. "[[Funiculì, Funiculà]]", a [[Neapolitan language]] song with lyrics by journalist [[Peppino Turco]] set to music by composer [[Luigi Denza]], commemorates its opening.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Paul |title=Thomas Cook & Son's Vesuvius Railway |journal=Japan Railway & Transport Review |date=March 1998 |url=http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr15/pdf/f10_smi.pdf}}</ref>
