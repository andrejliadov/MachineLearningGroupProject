==Etymology==
[[File:Jack Hills detrital zircons BSE micrographs.jpg|thumb|left|Backscatter electron micrograph of detrital zircons from the Hadean (4.404 ± 0.008 Ga) [[metasediment]]s of the [[Jack Hills]], [[Narryer Gneiss Terrane]], [[Western Australia]]]]

{{Life timeline}}
"Hadean" (from [[Hades]], the Greek god of the underworld, and the underworld itself) describes the [[hell]]ish conditions then prevailing on Earth: the planet had just formed and was still very hot owing to its recent [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], the abundance of short-lived radioactive elements, and frequent collisions with other Solar System bodies.

==Subdivisions<!--'Paleohadean', 'Mesohadean' and 'Neohadean' redirect here-->==
{{see also|Geologic time scale#Proposed Precambrian timeline|label1=Proposed Precambrian timeline}}
Since few geological traces of this eon remain on Earth, there is no official subdivision. However, the [[Lunar geologic timescale]] embraces several major divisions relating to the Hadean, so these are sometimes used in an informal sense to refer to the same periods of time on Earth.

The [[Lunar geologic timescale|Lunar divisions]] are:
* [[Pre-Nectarian]], from the formation of the [[Moon]]'s crust ({{Ma|4533}}) up to about {{Ma|3920}}.
* [[Nectarian]] ranging from {{Ma|3920}} up to about {{Ma|3850}}, in a time when the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]], according to that theory, was declining.

In 2010, an alternative scale was proposed that includes the addition of the [[Chaotian (geology)|Chaotian]] and [[Prenephelean (geology)|Prenephelean]] Eons preceding the Hadean, and divides the Hadean into three eras with two periods each. The Paleohadean era consists of the Hephaestean ({{Gigaannum|4.5|4.4}}) and the Jacobian periods ({{Gigaannum|4.4|4.3}}).  The Mesohadean is divided into the Canadian  ({{Gigaannum|4.3|4.2}}) and the Procrustean periods ({{Gigaannum|4.2|4.1}}). The Neohadean is divided into the Acastan ({{Gigaannum|4.1|4.0}}) and the Promethean periods ({{Gigaannum|4.0|3.9}}).<ref name="Goldblatt10">{{cite news |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100036717_2010036774.pdf |work=Solid Earth |title=The eons of Chaos and Hades |date=26 January 2010}}</ref> {{As of|2017|02}}, this has not been adopted by the [[IUGS]].

==Hadean rocks==
{{further|Oldest dated rocks}}

In the last decades of the 20th century geologists identified a few Hadean rocks from western [[Greenland]], northwestern [[Canada]], and [[Western Australia]]. In 2015, traces of carbon minerals interpreted as "remains of [[Biotic material|biotic life]]" were found in 4.1-billion-year-old rocks in [[Western Australia]].<ref name="AP-20151019">{{cite news |last=Borenstein |first=Seth |title=Hints of life on what was thought to be desolate early Earth |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20151019/us-sci--earliest_life-a400435d0d.html |date=19 October 2015 |work=[[Excite]] |location=Yonkers, NY |publisher=[[Mindspark Interactive Network]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=2015-10-20}}</ref><ref name="PNAS-20151014-pdf">{{cite journal |last1=Bell |first1=Elizabeth A. |last2=Boehnike |first2=Patrick |last3=Harrison |first3=T.

In many other areas, [[xenocryst]] (or relict) [[Hadean zircon]]s enclosed in older rocks indicate that younger rocks have formed on older terranes and have incorporated some of the older material. One example occurs in the [[Guiana Shield|Guiana shield]] from the Iwokrama Formation of southern Guyana where zircon cores have been dated at 4.22 Ga.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Nadeau|first1=Serge|last2=Chen|first2=Wei|last3=Reece|first3=Jimmy|last4=Lachhman|first4=Deokumar|last5=Ault|first5=Randy|last6=Faraco|first6=Maria|last7=Fraga|first7=Leda|last8=Reis|first8=Nelson|last9=Betiollo|first9=Leandro|date=2013-12-01|title=Guyana: the Lost Hadean crust of South America?|journal=Brazilian Journal of Geology|volume=43|issue=4|pages=601–606|doi=10.5327/Z2317-48892013000400002|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Atmosphere and oceans==
A sizable quantity of [[water]] would have been in the material that formed the Earth.<ref>{{Citation |first=Michael J. |last=Drake |year=2005 |title=Origin of water in the terrestrial planets |journal=Meteoritics & Planetary Science |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=515–656 |url=http://cfcc.edu/martech/courses/msc160/Readings/Drake2005.pdf |bibcode=2005M&PS...40..515J |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2005.tb00958.x |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009044640/http://cfcc.edu/martech/courses/msc160/Readings/Drake2005.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-09 }}.</ref> Water molecules would have escaped Earth's gravity more easily when it was less massive during its formation. Hydrogen and helium are expected to continually escape (even to the present day) due to [[atmospheric escape]].

Part of the ancient planet is theorized to have been disrupted by the [[giant impact hypothesis|impact that created the Moon]], which should have caused melting of one or two large regions of the Earth. Earth's present composition suggests that there was not complete remelting as it is difficult to completely melt and mix huge rock masses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308165917/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=446 |archive-date=March 8, 2015 |title=Origin of the Earth and Moon |website=Solar System Exploration |publisher=NASA |last=Taylor |first=G. Jeffrey}}</ref> However, a fair fraction of material should have been vaporized by this impact, creating a ''rock vapor atmosphere'' around the young planet. The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a heavy {{chem|link=carbon dioxide|CO|2}} atmosphere with [[hydrogen]] and [[water vapor]]. Liquid water oceans existed despite the surface temperature of {{convert|230|C|F|abbr=on}} because at an atmospheric pressure of above 27 atmospheres, caused by the heavy {{chem|CO|2}} atmosphere, water is still liquid. As cooling continued, subduction and dissolving in ocean water removed most {{chem|CO|2}} from the atmosphere but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and mantle cycles appeared.<ref>{{Citation |first1=N.

If this is true, the time when Earth finished its transition from having a hot, molten surface and atmosphere full of carbon dioxide, to being very much like it is today, can be roughly dated to about 4.0 billion years ago. The actions of plate tectonics and the oceans trapped vast amounts of carbon dioxide, thereby reducing the [[greenhouse effect]] and leading to a much cooler surface temperature and the formation of solid rock, and possibly even life.<ref name=NYT/><ref name="AramovMojzsis08"/>
