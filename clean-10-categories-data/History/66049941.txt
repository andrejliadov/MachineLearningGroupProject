'''Encyclopaedistics''' or '''encyclopaedics'''  as a discipline, is the academic scholarship of [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] as sources of [[encyclopedic knowledge]] and cultural objects as well; in this sense, this discipline is also known as "encyclopaedia studies" and can be termed as "theoretical encyclopediography" by analogy with [[Lexicography|theoretical lexicography]]. Encyclopaedistics as a practical activity (profession or business) is the process of assembling encyclopaedias available to the public for sale or for free (encyclopaedia [[publishing]] or practical encyclopediography).

As a practical activity, encyclopaedistics originated in the [[Middle Ages]] in connection with the development of compendiums based on alphabetical structuring (e.g. first edition of Polyanthea by Dominicus Nanus Mirabellius). 

That's why encyclopaedistics is often defined as "the art and science of selecting and disseminating the information most significant to mankind".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Shores|first=Louis|title=Reference as the Promotion of Free Inquiry|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=1976|isbn=9780872871564}}</ref>
