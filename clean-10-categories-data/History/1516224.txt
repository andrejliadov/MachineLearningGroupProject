'''Birch bark manuscripts''' are documents written on pieces of the inner layer of [[birch bark]], which was commonly used for writing before the advent of mass production of [[paper]]. Evidence of birch bark for writing goes back many centuries and in various cultures.

The oldest dated birch bark manuscripts are numerous [[Gandhāran Buddhist texts]] from approximately the 1st century CE, which are believed to have created in Afghanistan, likely by the [[Dharmaguptaka]] sect. Translations of the texts, mostly in [[Kharosthi|Kharoṣṭhī]], have produced the earliest known versions of significant Buddhist scriptures, including a ''[[Dhammapada]]'', discourses of Buddha that include the ''[[Rhinoceros Sutra]]'',  [[Avadana]]s and [[Abhidharma]] texts. Sanskrit birch bark manuscripts written with [[Brahmi script]] have been dated to the first few centuries CE. Several early Sanskrit writers, such as [[Kālidāsa]] (c. 4th century CE), [[Sushruta]] (c. 3rd century CE), and [[Varāhamihira]] (6th century CE) mention the use of birch bark for manuscripts. The bark of ''[[Betula utilis]]'' (Himalayan Birch) is still used today in India and [[Nepal]] for writing sacred mantras.

Russian texts discovered in [[Veliky Novgorod]] have been dated to approximately the 9th to 15th century CE. Most of those documents are letters written by various people in the [[Old Novgorod dialect]].

The Irish language's native writing system [[Ogham]], sometimes called the "tree alphabet", was legendarily invented by [[Ogma]] who wrote a proscription on birch to Lugh, warning him; the text of this proscription can be found in the [[Book of Ballymote]]. The first letter of Ogham is ''beith''; ''beithe'' means "birch".

Buddhist manuscripts written in the [[Gāndhārī language]] are likely the oldest extant Indic texts, dating to approximately the 1st century CE. They were written on birch bark and stored in clay jars. The [[British Library]] acquired them in 1994. They were written in Kharoṣṭhī and were believed to have originated from [[Afghanistan]], because similar birch bark manuscripts had been discovered in eastern Afghanistan.<ref name="AOS">{{cite journal|last=Salomon|first=Richard|date=April 1, 1997|title=A preliminary survey of some early Buddhist manuscripts recently acquired by the British Library|journal=[[The Journal of the American Oriental Society]]|volume=117|issue=2|pages=353–358|publisher=American Oriental Society|doi=10.2307/605500|jstor=605500|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-19728985}}</ref> Since 1994, a similar collection of Gāndhārī texts from the same era, called the Senior collection, has also surfaced.<ref name="SalomonGlass2000">{{cite book|author1=Richard Salomon|author2=Andrew Glass|title=A Gāndhārī Version of the Rhinoceros Sūtra: British Library Kharoṣṭhī Fragment 5B|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTmN8Xs9xBkC&pg=PR11|access-date=15 July 2012|year=2000|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-98035-5|page=xi}}</ref>

The British Library birch bark manuscripts were in the form of scrolls. They were very fragile and had already been damaged. They measured five to nine inches wide, and consisted of twelve- to eighteen-inch long, overlapping rolls that had been glued together to form longer scrolls. A thread sewn through the edges helped to hold them together. The script was written in black ink. The manuscripts were written on both sides of the scrolls, beginning at the top on one side, continuing with the scroll turned over and upside down, so that the text concluded at the top and back of the scroll. The longest intact scroll from the British Library collection is eighty-four inches long.<ref name="AOS" />

The texts were likely compiled by the Dharmaguptaka sect and probably "represent a random but reasonably representative fraction of what was probably a much larger set of texts preserved in the library of a monastery of the Dharmaguptaka sect in [[Nagarāhāra]]", according to Richard Salomon.<ref>Richard Salomon.

The condition of the scrolls indicates that they were already in poor condition and fragments by the time they were stored in the clay jars. Scholars concluded that the fragmented scrolls were given a ritual interment, much like Jewish texts stored in a [[genizah]].<ref name="AOS" />

The bark of ''[[Betula utilis]]'' (Himalayan Birch) has been used for centuries in India for writing scriptures and texts in various scripts. Its use was especially prevalent in historical [[Kashmir]]. Use of bark as paper has been mentioned by early Sanskrit writers such as [[Kalidasa]] (c. 4th century CE), [[Sushruta]] (c. 3rd century CE), and [[Varahamihira]] (6th century CE). In Kashmir, early scholars recounted that all of their books were written on Himalayan birch bark until the 16th century.<ref name="Müller">{{cite book |author=Müller, Friedrich Max |title=Selected essays on language, mythology and religion, Volume 2 |publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co. |year=1881 |pages=335–336fn  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuZYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA335}}</ref>

A large collection of birch bark scrolls were discovered in Afghanistan during the civil war in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, possibly in the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan|Bamiyan Caves]]. The approximately 3,000 scroll fragments are in Sanskrit or Buddhist Sanskrit, in the Brāhmī script, and date to a period from the 2nd to 8th century CE.<ref name="Olivelle2006" />

The [[Bower Manuscript]] is one of the oldest Sanskrit texts on birch bark in the Brāhmī script. It includes several texts covering subjects including a medical treatise and proverbs.

On July 26, 1951, during excavations in [[Novgorod]], a Soviet expedition led by [[Artemiy Artsikhovsky]] found the first Russian birch bark writing in a layer dated to c. 1400. Since then, more than 1,000 similar documents were discovered in [[Staraya Russa]], [[Smolensk]], [[Torzhok]], [[Pskov]], [[Tver]], [[Moscow]], [[Ryazan]], and [[Vologda]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://vologdaregion.ru/news/2015/7/21/v-vologde-vpervye-v-istorii-goroda-naydena-berestyanaya-gramota|script-title=ru:В Вологде впервые в истории города найдена берестяная грамота|date=21 July 2015|publisher=Vologda-Region|language=ru|access-date=22 July 2015}}</ref> although Novgorod remains by far the most prolific source of them. In Ukraine, birch bark documents were found in [[Zvenyhorod]], [[Volynia]]. In [[Belarus]], several documents were unearthed in [[Vitebsk]] and [[Mstislavl]].

[[Image:beresta.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Birch-bark letter no.&nbsp;497, c.&nbsp;1340-90, [[Veliky Novgorod]]; photograph]]
The late discovery of birch documents, as well as their amazing state of preservation, is explained by a deep culture layer in Novgorod (up to eight meters, or 25 feet) and heavy waterlogged [[clay]] soil which prevents the access of [[oxygen]]. Serious excavations in Novgorod started only in 1932, although some attempts had been made in the 19th century.

Although their existence was mentioned in some old East Slavic [[manuscript]]s, the discovery of birch bark documents ({{lang-ru|берестяна́я гра́мота}}, ''berestyanáya grámota'', and also ''grámota'' in those documents) significantly changed the understanding of the cultural level and language spoken by the [[East Slavs]] between the 11th and 15th centuries. About a hundred [[stylus]]es have also been found, mostly made of [[iron]], some of [[bone]] or [[bronze]].

According to [[Valentin Yanin]] and [[Andrey Zaliznyak]], most documents are ordinary letters by various people written in what is considered to be [[Old Novgorod dialect|a vernacular dialect]]. The letters are of a personal or business character. A few documents include elaborate obscenities. Very few documents are written in [[Old Church Slavonic]] and only one in [[Old Norse]]. The school exercises and drawings by a young boy named [[Onfim]] have drawn much attention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://erikkwakkel.tumblr.com/post/67681966023/medieval-kids-doodles-on-birch-bark-heres|title=Medieval kids' doodles on birch bark|last=Kwakkel|first=Erik|date=November 2013|work=[[Tumblr]]|access-date=21 December 2013}}</ref><ref>*{{cite book|last=Schaeken|first=Jos|title=Stemmen Op Berkenbast: Berichten Uit Middeleeuws Rusland: Dagelijks Leven en Communicatie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSjrvm_c57kC&pg=RA1-PA103|year=2012|publisher=Amsterdam UP|pages=101–105|isbn=9789087281618}}</ref><ref>* [[Valentin Yanin|Yanin, Valentin L.]] (Feb 1990).

The document numbered 292 from the Novgorod excavations (unearthed in 1957) is the oldest known document in any [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] language. It is dated to the beginning of the 13th century. The language used in the document is thought to be an archaic form of the language spoken in [[Olonets Karelia]], a dialect of the [[Karelian language]]. For details and full text, see [[Birch bark letter no. 292]].

===Example===
Novgorod birch-bark letter №366, about 1360-1380 A.D. Case of trampled wheat, release.

Original text (with added word division):
<blockquote>
сь урѧдѣсѧ ѧковь съ гюргьмо и съ харѣтономъ по бьсудьнои грамотѣ цто былъ возѧлъ гюргѣ грамоту в ызьѣжьнои пьшьнѣцѣ а харѣтоно во проторѣхо своѣхъ и возѧ гюрьгѣ за вьсь то рубьль и трѣ грѣвоны и коробью пьшьнѣцѣ а харѣтонъ возѧ дьсѧть локотъ сукона и грѣвону а боль не надобѣ гюрьгю нѣ харѣтону до ѧкова нѣ ѧкову до гюргѧ нѣ до харитона а на то рѧдьцѣ и послусѣ давыдъ лукѣнъ сынъ и сьтьпанъ таишѣнъ
</blockquote>

Translation (with explanations in square brackets):
<blockquote>
Here, Yakov has settled with Gyurgiy and with [[Chariton (name)|Khariton]] by courtless deed Gyurgiy has gotten [''at court''] concerning trampled [''by horses''] wheat and Khariton concerning his loss. Gyurgiy got one rouble [''money''], three grivnas [''money''], and basket [''measure''] of wheat for all that, and Khariton got ten cubits of cloth and one grivna. And Gyurgiy and Khariton have no more concern to Yakov, nor Yakov to Gyurgiy and Khariton. And arrangers and perceivers to that are Davyd, son of Luka, and Stepan Taishin.
</blockquote>

==Soviet Union==
There are birch bark letters written in modern times, most notably by victims of the Soviet repressions. People in [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|Soviet forced settlements]] and [[GULAG]] camps in Siberia used strips of birch bark to write letters to their loved ones back home, due to  inaccessibility of paper. Examples of these letters from Latvian victims of the Soviet regime are currently being considered to be included in the UNESCO "Memory of the World" heritage list.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atmina.unesco.lv/page/78|title=In Siberia Written Letters on Brich Bark &#124;|website=www.atmina.unesco.lv}}</ref> During [[World War II]], propaganda newspapers and leaflets published by guerilla fighters were sometimes printed on birch bark due to shortage of paper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.milportal.ru/2014/04/partizanskaya-pechat-orlovskoj-oblasti-v-gody-vojny/|title=Guerilla press of the Oryol Region during the years of war|access-date=2017-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225051447/http://history.milportal.ru/2014/04/partizanskaya-pechat-orlovskoj-oblasti-v-gody-vojny/|archive-date=2017-02-25|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rg.ru/2003/10/07/vystavka.html|title=Гусман "просветил" Фетисова|website=Российская газета}}</ref>
