{{Genocide of Indigenous peoples}}

The process that has been described as the '''genocide of indigenous peoples in Brazil''' began with the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas]], when [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] made landfall in what is now the country of [[Brazil]] in 1500. This started the process that led to the depopulation of the [[indigenous peoples in Brazil]], because of disease and violent treatment by [[European emigration|European settlers]], and their gradual replacement with colonists from [[Europe]] and [[Africa]]. This process has been described as a [[genocide]], and continues into the modern era with the ongoing destruction of indigenous peoples of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian region]].<ref name="Churchill 2000 p433" /><ref name="Scherrer 2003 p294" />

Over eighty indigenous tribes were destroyed between 1900 and 1957, and the overall indigenous population declined by over eighty percent, from over one million to around two hundred thousand.<ref name="Hinton 2002 p57" />  The [[Constitution|1988 Brazilian Constitution]] recognises indigenous peoples' right to pursue their traditional ways of life and to the permanent and exclusive possession of their "traditional lands", which are demarcated as [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|Indigenous Territories]].<ref name="constitution">Federal Constitution of Brazil.

Since the 1980s there has been a boom in the exploitation of the Amazon Rainforest for mining, logging and cattle ranching, posing a severe threat to the region's indigenous population. Settlers illegally encroaching on indigenous land continue to destroy the environment necessary for indigenous peoples' traditional ways of life, provoke violent confrontations and spread disease.<ref name="US DoS" /> Peoples such as the [[Akuntsu]] and [[Kanoê]] have been brought to the brink of extinction within the last three decades.<ref name="ISA Akuntsu">{{cite web|title=Introduction > Akuntsu|url=http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/akuntsu|work=Povos Indígenas no Brasil|access-date=8 March 2011|author=Instituto Socioambiental (ISA)}}</ref><ref name="ISA Kanoe">{{cite web|title=Introduction > Kanoê|url=http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/kanoe|work=Povos Indígenas no Brasil|access-date=8 March 2011|author=Instituto Socioambiental (ISA)}}</ref> On 13 November 2012, the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) submitted to the [[United Nations]] a [[human rights]] document with complaints about new proposed laws in Brazil that would further undermine their rights if approved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthpeoples.org/blog/?p=2866 |title=English version of human rights complaint document submitted to the United Nations by the National Indigenous Peoples Organization from Brazil (APIB) |publisher=Earth Peoples |date=13 November 2012 |access-date=19 November 2012}}</ref>

Several [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) have been formed due to the ongoing persecution of the indigenous peoples in Brazil, and international pressure has been brought to bear on the state after the release of the [[Figueiredo Report]] which documented massive human rights violations.

The abuses have been described as genocide, [[ethnocide]] and [[cultural genocide]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Barbara|first=Vanessa|date=2017-05-29|title=Opinion {{!}} The Genocide of Brazil’s Indians (Published 2017)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/opinion/the-genocide-of-brazils-indians.html|access-date=2020-12-07|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-08|title=Brazil Experts: A 'Genocide Is Underway' Against Uncontacted Tribes|url=https://www.ecowatch.com/brazil-indigenous-genocide-2640883698.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1?rebelltitem=1|access-date=2020-12-07|website=EcoWatch|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Brazilian president accused of inciting genocide of Indigenous people {{!}} CBC News|language=en-US|work=CBC|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/brazilian-president-accused-inciting-genocide-1.5377622|access-date=2020-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Demetrio|first=André|last2=Kozicki|first2=Katya|last3=Demetrio|first3=André|last4=Kozicki|first4=Katya|date=January 2019|title=Transitional Injustice For Indigenous Peoples From Brazil|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S2179-89662019000100129&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en|journal=Revista Direito e Práxis|volume=10|issue=1|pages=129–169|doi=10.1590/2179-8966/2017/28186|issn=2179-8966}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Miotto|first=Tiago|date=2020-07-20|title=A ameaça de genocídio que paira sobre os povos indígenas isolados no Brasil {{!}} Cimi|url=https://cimi.org.br/2020/07/ameaca-genocidio-paira-povos-indigenas-isolados-brasil/|access-date=2020-12-07|language=pt-BR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Nuevatribuna|title=Bolsonaro y su "plan genocida" contra los pueblos originarios|url=https://www.nuevatribuna.es/articulo/global/bolsonaro-plangenocida-contraindigenas-agronegocio-brasil/20200207154014170885.html|access-date=2020-12-07|website=Nuevatribuna|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-11-06|title=Amazonie.

== Affected tribes ==
{{See|List of extinct indigenous peoples of Brazil}}

In the 1940s the state and the [[Indian Protection Service]] (Serviço de Proteção aos Índios, SPI) forcibly relocated the [[Aikanã]], [[Kanôc]], [[Kwaza people|Kwazá]] and [[Salamái]] tribes to work on rubber plantations. During the journey many of the indigenous peoples starved to death, those who survived the journey were placed in an IPS settlement called Posto Ricardo Franco. These actions resulted in the near extinction of the Kanôc tribe.<ref name="Van Der Voort 2004 p5" />

The ethnocide of the Yanomami has been well documented, there are an estimated nine thousand currently living in Brazil in the Upper Orinoco drainage and a further fifteen thousand in Venezuela.<ref name="Haviland 2013 p628" /> The NGO Survival International has reported that throughout the 1980s up to forty thousand gold prospectors entered Yanomami territory bringing diseases the Yanomami had no immunity to, the prospectors shot and destroyed entire villages, and Survival International estimates that up to twenty per cent of the people were dead within seven years.<ref name="Kopenawa Yanomami 2013" />

The [[Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau]], whose territory has been protected by law since 1991, saw an influx of an estimated 800 people in 2007. The tribal leaders met with the civil authorities and demanded the trespassers be evicted. This tribe, initially contacted in 1981, saw a severe decline in population after disease was introduced by settlers and miners. Their numbers are now estimated at a few hundred.<ref name="Survival International 2007" />

== Portuguese colonization ==
During the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas]], Cabral made landfall off the atlantic coast. Over the following decade the indigenous [[Tupí people|Tupí]], [[Tapuya]] and other tribes which lived along the coast suffered large depopulation due to disease and violence. A process of miscegenation between Portuguese settlers and indigenous women also occurred.<ref>Darcy Ribeiro – O Povo Brasileiro, Vol. 07, 1997 (1997), pp. 28 to 33; 72 to 75 and 95 to 101.</ref> It is estimated that of the 2.5 million indigenous peoples who had lived in the region which now comprises Brazil, less than 10 per cent survived to the 1600s.<ref name="Churchill 2000 p433" /> The primarily reason for depopulation was diseases such as smallpox that advanced far beyond movement of European settlers.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0122njp|title=Unnatural Histories - Amazon|publisher=BBC Four}}</ref>

== State reaction ==
In 1952 Brazil ratified the [[Genocide Convention|genocide convention]] and incorporated into their penal laws [[Genocide Convention#Definition of genocide|article II]] of the convention.<ref name="Quigley 2006 p48" /> While the statute was being drafted, Brazil argued against the inclusion of cultural genocide, claiming that some minority groups may use it to oppose the normal assimilation which occurs in a new country. According to professor of law at [[Vanderbilt University]] Larry May, the argument put forward by Brazil was significant, but cultural genocide should not be cast aside, and this type of genocide should be included within the definition of genocide.<ref name="May 2010 p103" />

In 1967 public prosecutor, Jader de Figueiredo Correia, submitted the [[Figueiredo Report]] to the [[Brazilian military government|dictatorship]] which was then ruling the country. The report, which ran to seven thousand pages, remained hidden for over forty years. Its release caused an international furore. The rediscovered documents were examined by the [[National Truth Commission]], which was tasked with the investigations of human rights violations which occurred in the periods 1947 through to 1988. The report reveals that the SPI had enslaved indigenous people, tortured children and stolen land. The Truth Commission was of the opinion that entire tribes in [[Maranhão]] were completely eradicated and in [[Mato Grosso]], an attack on thirty [[Cinta Larga people|Cinturão Largo]] left only two survivors (the "[[Massacre at 11th Parallel]]"). The report also states that landowners and members of the SPI had entered isolated villages and deliberately introduced [[smallpox]]. Of the one hundred and thirty four people accused in the report the state has as yet not tried a single one.<ref name="Watts 19 May 2013" /> The report also detailed instances of mass killings, rapes, and torture. Figueiredo stated that the actions of the SPI had left the indigenous peoples near extinction. The state abolished the SPI following the release of the report. The [[Red Cross]] launched an investigation after further allegations of [[ethnic cleansing]] were made after the SPI had been replaced.<ref name="Garfield 2001 p143" /><ref name="Warren 2001 p84" />

In 2014, Volume II, Chapter 5 of the official [http://cnv.memoriasreveladas.gov.br/textos-do-colegiado/586-epub.html Report] of the [[National Truth Commission]] acknowledged the deaths of at least 8,000 indigenous people during the period under investigation and made 13 recommendations to redress the situation, beginning with a public apology from the Brazilian State to the indigenous peoples, and including "creation of a specific truth commission for indigenous issues; a commemorative date for the events that occurred; the creation of museums; production of didactic and audiovisual material to be shared in schools, on television, and on the internet; the implementation of actions to preserve the culture of indigenous peoples; delivery of all kinds of documents from the dictatorship to these peoples; and the return of territories taken from them".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Demetrio|first=André|last2=Kozicki|first2=Katya|date=2019|title=A (In)Justiça de Transição para os Povos Indígenas no Brasil|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2179-89662019000100129&tlng=pt|journal=Revista Direito e Práxis|volume=10|issue=1|pages=129–169|doi=10.1590/2179-8966/2017/28186|issn=2179-8966|doi-access=free}}</ref><sup>:137</sup> Few, if any, of these recommendations have been implemented.

In 1992 a group who had been prospecting for gold were tried for the attempted genocide of the Yanomami tribe. A report from an anthropologist, which was submitted as evidence during the trial, stated that the prospectors' entry into Yanomami territory had an adverse effect on their lives, as the prospectors carried diseases. They had also contaminated the rivers which the Yanomami used as a source of food.<ref name="Quigley 2006 p48" /> The UN reported that thousands of the Yanomami have been killed as the Brazilian government failed to enforce the law and that, even after though the Yanomami peoples' territory had been demarcated, the state had not provided the necessary resources to stop the illegal incursion of gold prospectors. These prospectors have caused massive forest fires which have led to the destruction of extensive areas of both croplands and rainforest.<ref name="Travis 2013 pp147-148" />

== International reaction ==
At the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] in Brazil the [[Kari-Oka Declaration]] and the [[Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter]] were presented by the representatives of indigenous peoples from around the world. The Kari-Oka Declaration states "We continue to maintain our rights as peoples despite centuries of deprivation, assimilation and genocide". The declaration also asserted that the genocide convention must be amended so as to include the genocide of indigenous peoples.<ref name="Totten 2010 p4" /> The [[International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs]] (IWGIA) was founded in 1968 in response to the genocide of indigenous peoples in Brazil and [[Paraguay]], and in 1969 [[Survival International]] was founded in London as a response to the atrocities, theft of land and genocide occurring in the [[Amazônia Legal|Brazilian Amazon]]. In 1972 anthropologists from [[Harvard University]] founded [[Cultural Survival]].<ref name="Morgan 2011 p65" />

The World Bank has been subject to criticism over loans which have been used to help fund the dislocation of indigenous peoples and environmental destruction. The Polonoreste project caused  wholesale [[Deforestation in Brazil|deforestation]], ecological damage on a wide scale, as well as the forced relocation of indigenous communities. The project led to an international campaign that resulted in the World Bank suspending loans.<ref name="Hinton 2002 p57" />
