The '''U. S. Centennial of Flight Commission ("CoFC" or "CofF Commission")''' was created in 1999, by the U.S. Congress, to serve as a national and international source of information about activities commemorating the [[centennial]] of the [[Wright brothers|Wright Brothers']] first powered flight on December 17, 1903 (purportedly the first fully controlled, sustained, powered flight of a heavier-than-air man-carrying [[airplane]]).<ref name="uscofc_review_ncase">Review: [http://aviationeducation.org/government/item/u-s-centennial-of-flight-commission "U.

There were centennial commemorations and celebrations planned in 2003 to occur in both:
* [[North Carolina]] (the Wrights' 1903 powered flights took place on the sands at [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]]);<ref name="uscofc_review_ncase" /><ref name="release_01_227_cof_nasa_2001_11_20" /> and 
* [[Dayton, Ohio]], hometown of the Wright brothers.<ref name="uscofc_review_ncase" />

In addition, the commission anticipated numerous historical and educational projects about aviation and aeronautics nationally and internationally, and sought to be a shaping force in those events.<ref name="release_01_227_cof_nasa_2001_11_20" /><ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net">{{cite web|title=Commission Roles and Responsibilities|url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/about/roles.htm|publisher=US Centennial of Flight Commission|accessdate=5 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009204541/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/about/roles.htm|archivedate=9 October 2012}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

The Commission coordinated a national outreach campaign, ''"Centennial of Flight: Born of Dreams — Inspired by Freedom,"'' "to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Wright brothers’ first powered flight and the century of accomplishments that followed." The Commission also advised the President, Congress and federal agencies on the most effective ways to encourage and promote national and international participation in the commemoration.<ref name="release_03_129_cof_nasa_2003_04_02" /> The CoFC also undertook additional efforts to support Centennial commemorations and celebrations, and related educational and cultural programs, through its alliance with "Centennial Partners" who were "planning everything from cross-country tours to air shows and exhibitions, seminars and television specials." It also sponsored a large educational Centennial website.<ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net" />

==Authorization and mission==
In 1998, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Centennial of Flight Commemoration Act]], Public Law 105-389, [[105th Congress]] (Nov. 13, 1998), as amended by Public Law 106-68, [[106th Congress]] (Oct. 6, 1999).<ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net" /><ref name="bill_hr5077_19940922_congress_gov">Hall, Tony P.

From FY1999 through FY2001, the Commission was funded through specific line-items in the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] operations appropriations. In subsequent years, the Commission was funded through general agency appropriations. The Centennial of Flight Commission, are provided with the authority to accept only nonmonetary donations. In that instance, the statutory language stated,

* The [[Challenger Center]]—which uses space as a theme to excite, inspire and encourage students in the study of mathematics and science, and the application of technology. CofC's alliance was to have the Challenger Center, via [[Space Day]] 2003(SM), challenge students, in grades four through eight, "to design and build models of aircraft using the ingenuity and creativity of the Wrights as inspiration."<ref name="release_01_176_cof_nasa_2002_09_17" />

==Programs and Events==
In addition to the programs and events noted in the [[#Members and Participants]] section, the CoFC was involved with numerous other activities.

The '''National Centennial of Flight Kick-off''' event, was held December 17, 2002—a year before the 100th anniversary of the Wright flight—at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]], in [[Washington, D.C.]]. It included a Presidential proclamation and the recognition of numerous aviation and aerospace pioneers, with presentations from Chairman Dailey, actor/aviator [[John Travolta]], FAA Administrator [[Marion Blakey]], and NASA Administrator [[Sean O'Keefe]]. On the same day, in North Carolina, a commemoration was held near Kitty Hawk—a daylong anniversary tribute at the site of the Wrights' first flight, the Wright Brothers National Memorial, at Kill Devil Hills. Speakers included North Carolina Governor [[Michael F. Easley]] and [[U.S. Air Force]] Gen. Ralph E. Eberhart, commander of [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] and [[U.S. Northern Command]]<ref name="cof_calendar_kickoff_cof_net" /><ref name="centennial_kickoff_2002_12_17_cspan_org">VIDEO: [https://www.c-span.org/video/?174275-1/centennial-flight ''Centennial of Flight,'']"...a ceremony..."

Numerous other commemoration events, and related projects, were urged, planned or supported throughout the nation, throughout the "centennial year" (December 17, 2002 to December 17, 2003), particularly in [[Ohio]] and [[North Carolina]].<ref name="release_01_227_cof_nasa_2001_11_20" /><ref name="cof_calendar_cof_net" />

The principal, and "grand finale," '''First Flight Centennial Celebration''' was held December 12–17, 2003, at the [[Wright Brothers National Memorial]] at the approximate site of their first powered flight at [[Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina]]. President [[George W. Bush]] was present, and numerous military and civilian aircraft performed. The event was marred by foul weather, and failed attempts to fly a replica of the [[1903 Wright Flyer]].<ref name="centennial_ceremony_2003_12_17_cspan_org">VIDEO: [https://www.c-span.org/video/?179551-1/flight-centennial-ceremony ''First Flight Centennial Ceremony,''] December 17, 2003, [[C-SPAN]], retrieved December 2017</ref><ref name="first flight_2003_12_18_washpost">Ruane.

==Website==
One of the Centennial of Flight Commission's principal efforts was the development of the organization's ''Centennial of Flight'' website<ref name="release_01_227_cof_nasa_2001_11_20" />—a 17,000-page online encyclopedia of aviation history (chiefly U.S. aviation history), with hundreds of articles, and thousands of illustrations. The Commission claimed the website provided "the most up-to-date information on celebration activity, as well as the most comprehensive collection of outstanding educational essays, multimedia and links regarding the history of flight."<ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net" /><ref name="aahs_moves_2013_3rd_qtr_aahs_flightline" />

The site's development and operation consumed about four-million dollars, of mostly federal funds, but became very popular during the Centennial year, peaking at over 4 million visitors per month by December 2003 (the 100th Anniversary month).<ref name="aahs_moves_2013_3rd_qtr_aahs_flightline" />

The site was maintained at the internet domain '''centennialofflight.gov'''<ref name="release_01_227_cof_nasa_2001_11_20" /> by NASA. Following the closing of the CoFC in April 2004, responsibility for the site transferred to the NASA History Office, who maintained the site online, basically unchanged, until budget cutbacks and server-computer problems motivated its abandonment by NASA in September 2012. Various parties salvaged parts of the site, including the [[American Aviation Historical Society]] (AAHS), who acquired copies of the computer code for the site from NASA. In 2013, a member of AAHS donated the domain name '''[http://centennialofflight.net/ centennialofflight.net]'''to AAHS, to accommodate an archive—maintained by AAHS—of the original official Centennial of Flight website. AAHS made structural "clean-ups" to the site (removing broken [[hyperlinks|links]] and obsolete calendar data), and initiating other edits, highlighted with dark red lettering.<ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net" /><ref name="aahs_moves_2013_3rd_qtr_aahs_flightline" /><ref name="uscofc_review_ncase" />

==Termination==
The Commission closed in 2004, following the end of its scheduled functions. As part of the Commission's charter, there were provisions for certain material to be preserved, particularly the large website, which was assigned to the NASA History Office.<ref name="about_the_commission_cof_net" /><ref name="aahs_moves_2013_3rd_qtr_aahs_flightline" />
