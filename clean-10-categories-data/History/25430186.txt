'''Aztec influence in Spain''' can be seen in both the cuisine of [[Spain]] and in its architecture.

==Food==
[[Guacamole]], an [[avocado]]-based [[dip (food)|dip]] that was popular in [[Aztec cuisine]] as early as the 16th century, was brought back to Spain by the [[Conquistadors]].<ref name="zeldes">{{Cite web | last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | title = Eat this!

The stone work of sun pattern, snakes, panther and birds above the main entrance to the church of Nuestra Señora de Regla, [[Pájara]], [[Fuerteventura]] in the [[Canary Islands]], is thought by some specialists to show Aztec influence.<ref>[http://www.gobcan.es/boc/2006/130/009.html Government of the Canary Island page] gobcan.es, retrieved 14 December 2009</ref><ref>Noel Rochford, ''Fuerteventura'', Sunflower Books, 2007, p. 19</ref>
