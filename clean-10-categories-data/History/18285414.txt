{{short description|Mythical South American underground city}}
'''Akakor''' is the name of a mythological ancient underground city, located somewhere between [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]].

It was described by German journalist [[Karl Brugger]], based on interviews with a self-proclaimed Brazilian Indian chieftain [[Tatunca Nara]] in his book ''The Chronicle of Akakor'' (1976). Although Brugger was apparently convinced, the information's only source Tatunca Nara was later exposed by activist and adventurer [[Rüdiger Nehberg]] as being Günther Hauck, a German.

Elements of the story from ''The Chronicle of Akakor'' were used in the film
''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', where they were conflated with [[El Dorado]], although references are to "Akator".<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/05/10/film-preview-part-one-indiana-jones-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull/  Film Preview (Pt.
