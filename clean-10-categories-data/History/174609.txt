The '''Chicxulub crater''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|iː|k|ʃ|ᵿ|l|uː|b}}; {{IPA-myn|tʃʼikʃuluɓ|lang}}) is an [[impact crater]] buried underneath the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in [[Mexico]].<ref name="eid">{{Cite Earth Impact DB | name = Chicxulub | accessdate = December 30, 2008 }}</ref> Its center is located offshore near the town of [[Chicxulub, Yucatán|Chicxulub]], after which the crater is named.<ref name="Penfield">{{cite journal |last1=Penfield |first1=Glen |title=Unlikely Impact |journal=AAPG Explorer |date=2019 |volume=40 |issue=12 |pages=20–23 |url=https://explorer.aapg.org/story?articleid=55293 |accessdate=12 December 2019}}</ref> It was formed when a large [[asteroid]] or [[comet]] about {{convert|11|to|81|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter,<ref name=DMCT2014/> known as the [[Chicxulub impactor]], struck the Earth.

The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, [[geophysics|geophysicists]] who had been looking for [[petroleum]] in the Yucatán Peninsula during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with [[Alan Hildebrand]] in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature.

In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain [[rock core]] samples from the impact itself.

In 1978, geophysicists Glen Penfield and Antonio Camargo were working for the Mexican state-owned oil company [[Pemex|Petróleos Mexicanos]], or Pemex, as part of an airborne magnetic survey of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] north of the Yucatán Peninsula.<ref name=verschuur>Verschuur, 20–21.</ref> Penfield's job was to use geophysical data to scout possible locations for oil drilling.<ref name=bates>Bates.</ref> In the offshore magnetic data, Penfield noted anomalies whose depth he estimated, and mapped. He then obtained onshore [[Gravity anomaly|gravity data]] from the 1940s.  According to Penfield, "The old data showed a large concentric set of onshore gravity anomalies.  When I laid it next to my No. 2 pencil mapping of the offshore magnetic anomalies, the fit was perfect: a shallow, 180-kilometer diameter gravity-magnetic bullseye on the almost non-magnetic, uniform carbonate background of the Yucatan platform!  We recognized the crater as the likely Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary event."<ref name=Penfield/><ref name=bates/> A decade earlier, the same map suggested an impact feature to contractor Robert Baltosser, but he was forbidden to publicize his conclusion by Pemex corporate policy of the time.<ref>Verschuur, 20.</ref>

[[Image:Chicxulub shockedquartz.png|thumb|Penfield with the sample of [[shocked quartz]] found at Well #2, Chicxulub]]
Pemex disallowed release of specific data but let Penfield and company official Antonio Camargo present their results at the 1981 [[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]] conference.<ref>Weinreb.</ref> That year's conference was underattended and their report attracted scant attention. Coincidentally, many experts in [[impact crater]]s and the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary|K–Pg (Cretaceous–Paleogene) boundary]] were attending a separate conference on Earth impacts. Although Penfield had plenty of geophysical data sets, he had no rock cores or other physical evidence of an impact.<ref name=bates/>

He knew Pemex had drilled exploratory wells in the region. In 1951, one bored into what was described as a thick layer of [[andesite]] about {{convert|1.3|km|ft|sp=us}} down. This layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an Earth impact, but at the time of the borings it was dismissed as a [[lava dome]]—a feature uncharacteristic of the region's geology. Penfield tried to secure site samples, but was told such samples had been lost or destroyed.<ref name=bates/> When attempts at returning to the drill sites and looking for rocks proved fruitless, Penfield abandoned his search, published his findings and returned to his Pemex work.

At the same time, in 1980, geologist [[Walter Alvarez]] and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist [[Luis Walter Alvarez]], put forth [[Alvarez hypothesis|their hypothesis]] that a large extraterrestrial body had struck Earth at the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. In 1981, unaware of Penfield's discovery, [[University of Arizona]] graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth-impact theory and sought a candidate crater.<ref>Mason.</ref> Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus [[iridium]] containing [[shocked quartz]] grains and small weathered [[glass]] beads that looked to be [[tektite]]s.<ref>Hildebrand, Penfield, et al.</ref> Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, thought to have been scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a [[megatsunami]] resulting from an Earth impact.<ref name=alanhild2/> Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the [[Caribbean Basin|Caribbean basin]] at the K–Pg boundary.<ref name=alanhild2>Hildebrand interview: 'Similar deposits of rubble occur all across the southern coast of North America […] indicate that something extraordinary happened here.'</ref> So when Haitian professor Florentine Morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on [[Haiti]], Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby impact.<ref name=moras>Morás.</ref> Tests on samples retrieved from the K–Pg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield [[nuclear weapon|nuclear detonations]].<ref name=moras />

In 1990, ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' reporter Carlos Byars told Hildebrand of Penfield's earlier discovery of a possible impact crater.<ref name=Frankel>Frankel, 50.</ref> Hildebrand contacted Penfield in April 1990 and the pair soon secured two drill samples from the Pemex wells, stored in [[New Orleans]].<ref name=alanhild>Hildebrand interview.</ref> Hildebrand's team tested the samples, which clearly showed [[Shock metamorphism|shock-metamorphic]] materials.

A team of California researchers including [[Kevin O. Pope|Kevin Pope]], [[Adriana Ocampo]], and Charles Duller, surveying regional satellite images in 1996, found a [[cenote]] ([[sinkhole]]) ring centered on Chicxulub that matched the one Penfield saw earlier; the cenotes were thought to be caused by [[subsidence]] of [[bolide]]-weakened [[lithostratigraphy]] around the impact crater wall.<ref>Pope, Baines, et al.</ref> More recent evidence suggests the crater is {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} wide, and the 180&nbsp;km ring is an inner wall of it.<ref>Sharpton & Marin.</ref>

The [[Chicxulub impactor]] had an estimated diameter of {{convert|11-81|km|sp=us}}, and delivered an estimated energy of 21–921&nbsp;billion [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]] A-bombs (between 1.3×10{{sup|24}} and 5.8×10{{sup|25}}&nbsp;[[joule]]s, or 1.3–58&nbsp;[[Yotta-|yottajoules]]).<ref name=DMCT2014/> For comparison, this is ~100&nbsp;million times the energy released by the [[Tsar Bomba]], a [[Thermonuclear weapon|thermonuclear device]] ("H-bomb") that remains the most powerful human-made explosive ever detonated, which released 210&nbsp;[[peta-|peta]]joules (2.1×10{{sup|17}}&nbsp;joules, or 50&nbsp;[[TNT equivalent|megatons TNT]]).<ref>Adamsky and Smirnov, 19.</ref> The impact created a hole {{convert|100|km|sp=us}} wide and {{convert|30|km|sp=us}} deep, leaving a crater mainly under the sea and covered by {{convert|600|m|sp=us}} of [[sediment]] by the 21st century.<ref name="amos">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39922998 |title=Dinosaur asteroid hit 'worst possible place' |author=Amos, Jonathan |date=May 15, 2017 |work=BBC News |department=Science and Environment |access-date=August 19, 2017}}</ref> In addition, the impact created winds in excess of 1000 kilometers per hour near the blast's center.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lpi.usra.edu/science/kring/Chicxulub/regional-effects/|title=Chicxulub Impact Event: Regional Effects|website=Lunar and Planetary Institute|access-date=1 June 2020}}</ref>

The emission of dust and particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things.

In February 2008, a team of researchers led by Sean Gulick at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]'s [[Jackson School of Geosciences]] used seismic images of the crater to determine that the impactor landed in deeper water than previously assumed. They argued that this would have resulted in increased sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere. According to the press release, that "could have made the impact deadlier in two ways: by altering climate (sulfate aerosols in the upper atmosphere can have a cooling effect) and by generating [[acid rain]] (water vapor can help to flush the lower atmosphere of sulfate aerosols, causing acid rain)."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2008/01/seismic-images-show-dinosaur-killing-meteor-made-bigger-splash/ |title=Seismic Images Show Dinosaur-Killing Meteor Made Bigger Splash |date=January 1, 2008 |author=Marc Airhart}}</ref> This was borne out by the results of a drilling project in 2016 which found that sulfate-containing rocks found in the area were not found in the peak ring (the rocks found were from deep within the earth's crust instead), the interpretation being that they had been vaporized by the impact and dispersed into the atmosphere.

A long-term local effect of the impact was the creation of the Yucatán sedimentary basin which "ultimately produced favorable conditions for human settlement in a region where surface water is scarce."<ref>{{cite conference|conference=ASPRS 2007 Annual Conference|url=http://www.asprs.org/a/publications/proceedings/tampa2007/0080.pdf |title=The Chicxulub meteor impact and ancient locational decisions on the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico: The application of remote sensing, GIS, and GPS in settlement pattern Studies |last=Winemiller |first=Terance L. |publisher=[[American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing]] |place=Tampa, Florida |date=2007 |access-date=October 2, 2012}}</ref>

===Geology and morphology===
[[Image:Iridium clay layer.png|thumb|right|The piece of clay, held by Walter Alvarez, that sparked research into the impact theory. The greenish-brown band in the center is extremely rich in [[iridium]].]]
In their 1991 paper, Hildebrand, Penfield and company described the geology and composition of the impact feature.<ref>Hildebrand, Penfield, ''et al.''; 1.</ref> The rocks above the impact feature are layers of [[marl]] and [[limestone]] reaching to a depth of almost {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}.

Along the edge of the crater are clusters of [[cenote]]s or sinkholes,<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNRTtLLuNM8 |type=video |title=Meteor impact site |series=Earth: The biography |magazine=National Geographic |date=July 11, 2008 |access-date=August 19, 2015}}</ref> which suggest that there was a water basin inside the feature during the [[Neogene]] period, after the impact.<ref name=ppg4/> The [[groundwater]] of such a basin would have dissolved the [[limestone]] and created the caves and cenotes beneath the surface.<ref>Kring, "Discovering the Crater".</ref> The paper also noted that the crater seemed to be a good candidate source for the [[tektite]]s reported at [[Haiti]].<ref>Sigurdsson.</ref>

===Astronomical origin of asteroid===
In September 2007, a report published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' proposed an origin for the asteroid that created the Chicxulub crater.<ref name=perlman/> The authors, [[William F. Bottke]], David Vokrouhlický, and [[David Nesvorný]], argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the [[Baptistina family]] of asteroids, the largest surviving member of which is [[298 Baptistina]]. They proposed that the "Chicxulub asteroid" was also a member of this group. The connection between Chicxulub and Baptistina is supported by the large amount of carbonaceous material present in microscopic fragments of the impactor, suggesting the impactor was a member of an uncommon class of asteroids called [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s, like Baptistina.<ref name=Bottke/> According to Bottke, the Chicxulub impactor was a fragment of a much larger parent body about {{convert|170|km|abbr=on|0}} across, with the other impacting body being around {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=Bottke>Bottke, Vokrouhlicky, Nesvorny.</ref><ref>Ingham.</ref>

In 2011, new data from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] revised the date of the collision which created the [[Baptistina family]] to about 80 million years ago. This makes an asteroid from this family highly improbable to be the asteroid that created the Chicxulub crater, as typically the process of [[Orbital resonance|resonance]] and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years.<ref name="Universe Today">{{cite news | first=Tammy | last=Plotner | title=Did Asteroid Baptistina Kill the Dinosaurs?

===Chicxulub and mass extinction===
{{Main|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event }}

The Chicxulub Crater lends support to the theory postulated by the late [[physicist]] [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and his son, [[geologist]] [[Walter Alvarez]], that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups, including non-avian [[dinosaur]]s, may have resulted from a [[bolide]] impact (the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]). Luis and Walter Alvarez, at the time both faculty members at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], postulated that this enormous extinction event, which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the Chicxulub crater, could have been caused by just such a large impact.<ref>Alvarez, W. interview.</ref> The age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago, the end of the [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]], and the start of the [[Paleogene]] period. It coincides with the K–Pg boundary, the geological boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene. The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], including the worldwide extinction of non-avian [[dinosaur]]s. This conclusion has been the source of controversy.

In March 2010, forty-one experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: 20 years' worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the [[mass extinction]]s at the K–Pg boundary.<ref name="science">Schulte, et al., 2010</ref><ref>Rincon.</ref> In 2013 a study compared [[isotope]]s in [[impact glass]] from the Chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the [[extinction event]] occurred in the [[fossil record]]; the study concluded that the impact glasses were dated at 66.038 ± 0.049 Ma, and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66.019 ± 0.021 Ma, the two dates being within 19,000 years of each other, or almost exactly the same within experimental error.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|last1=Renne|first1=Paul|url=https://eps.harvard.edu/files/eps/files/renne.kt_.science.2013.pdf|title=Time Scales of Critical Events Around the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary|journal=Science|date=February 8, 2013|volume=339|issue=6120|pages=684–7|bibcode=2013Sci...339..684R|doi=10.1126/science.1230492|pmid=23393261|s2cid=6112274}}</ref>

The theory is now widely accepted by the [[scientific community]]. Some critics, including [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Robert T.

The main evidence of such an impact, besides the crater itself, is contained in a thin layer of clay present in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary|K–Pg boundary]] across the world. In the late 1970s, the Alvarezes and colleagues reported that it contained an abnormally high concentration of [[iridium]].<ref name=alvarez>Alvarez.</ref> Iridium levels in this layer reached 6 parts per billion by weight or more compared with 0.4 for the Earth's crust as a whole;<ref>Web Elements.</ref> in comparison, meteorites can contain around 470 parts per billion of this element.<ref>Quivx.</ref> It was hypothesized that the iridium was spread into the atmosphere when the impactor was vaporized and settled across the Earth's surface among other material thrown up by the impact, producing the layer of iridium-enriched clay.<ref>Mayell.</ref> Similarly, an [[iridium anomaly]] in core samples from the [[Pacific Ocean]] suggested the [[Eltanin impact]] of about 2.5 million years ago.<ref name="Kyte1981">{{cite journal|last=Kyte|first=Frank T.|author2=Zhiming Zhou|authorlink3=John T.

A more recent discovery is believed to demonstrate evidence of the scope of the destruction from the impact. In a March 2019 article in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]], an international team of twelve scientists revealed the contents of the [[Tanis (fossil site)|Tanis fossil site]] discovered near [[Bowman, North Dakota]] that appeared to show the destruction of an ancient lake and its inhabitants at the time of the Chicxulub impact. In the paper, the group claims that the geology of the site is strewn with [[fossil]]ized trees and remains of fish and other animals. The lead researcher, Robert A. DePalma of the [[University of Kansas]], was quoted in the ''New York Times'' as stating that "you would be blind to miss the carcasses sticking out... It is impossible to miss when you see the outcrop."  Evidence correlating this find to the Chicxulub impact included [[tektites]] bearing "the unique chemical signature of other tektites associated with the Chicxulub event" found in the gills of fish fossils and embedded in [[amber]], an iridium-rich top layer that is considered another signature of the event, and an atypical lack of scavenging of the dead fish and animals that suggested few other species survived the event to feed off the mass death. The exact mechanism of the site's destruction has been debated as either an impact-caused [[tsunami]] or lake and river [[seiche]] activity triggered by post-impact earthquakes; there has yet been no firm conclusion upon which researchers have settled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.ku.edu/2019/03/29/stunning-discovery-offers-glimpse-minutes-following-%E2%80%98dinosaur-killer%E2%80%99-chicxulub-impact|title=Stunning discovery offers glimpse of minutes following 'dinosaur-killer' Chicxulub impact|date=March 29, 2019|access-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/science/dinosaurs-extinction-asteroid.html|title=Fossil Site Reveals Day That Meteor Hit Earth and, Maybe, Wiped Out Dinosaurs|date=March 29, 2019|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Broad|first1=William J.|last2=Chang|first2=Kenneth}}</ref>

==Multiple impact hypothesis==
In recent years, several other craters of around the same age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20°N and 70°N. Examples include the disputed [[Silverpit crater]] in the [[North Sea]], and the [[Boltysh crater]] in [[Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Geoscientist/Archive/December-2009/Silverpit-not-crater#|title=Silverpit "not crater"|last=Riddle|first=Dawne|date=December 2009|publisher=[[Geological Society of London]]|accessdate=April 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>Stewart, Allen.</ref><ref>Kelley, Gurov.</ref> Both are much smaller than Chicxulub, but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across striking the Earth.<ref>Stewart.</ref> This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time.<ref name=multiple/> Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger [[Shiva crater]], though the structure's status as an impact crater is contested.<ref name=Economist1009>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14698363|title=Mass extinctions: I am become Death, destroyer of worlds|date=October 22, 2009|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=October 24, 2009}}</ref><ref>Mullen, "Shiva".</ref>

The collision of [[Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9]] with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the [[gas giant]]s, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past.<ref name=Economist1009/><ref name=Weisstein>Weisstein.</ref> This scenario may have occurred on Earth at the end of the Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart.<ref name=multiple>Mullen, "Multiple Impacts".</ref><ref name=Economist1009/>

In late 2006, Ken MacLeod, a [[geology]] professor from the [[University of Missouri]], completed an analysis of [[sediment]] below the ocean's surface, bolstering the single-impact theory. MacLeod conducted his analysis approximately {{convert|4500|km|sp=us}} from the Chicxulub crater to control for possible changes in soil composition at the impact site, while still close enough to be affected by the impact. The analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment, which indicated there was only one impact.<ref>Than.</ref> Multiple-impact proponents such as [[Gerta Keller]] regard the results as "rather hyper-inflated" and do not agree with the conclusion of MacLeod's analysis, arguing that there might only be gaps of hours to days between impacts in a multiple-impact scenario (cf. Shoemaker-Levy 9) which would not leave a detectable gap in deposits.<ref>Dunham.</ref>

[[Gypsum]], a [[sulfate]]-containing rock usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and likely vaporized to enter the atmosphere, an event immediately followed by a [[megatsunami]] sufficient to lay down the largest-known layered bed of sand, around {{cvt|100|m|||}} deep and separated by grain size, directly above the peak ring.<ref name=sciam/> These types of sand deposits are caused by extreme water movement, where the larger and heavier sand grains settle first, followed by lighter and smaller grains.

Taken together, analyses indicate that the impactor was large enough to create a {{convert|120|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip||||sp=us}} peak ring, to melt, shock and eject granite from many kilometers within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted over years to decades.<ref name="nyt1" /><ref name="sciam">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/updated-drilling-dinosaur-killing-impact-crater-explains-buried-circular-hills|title=Updated: Drilling of dinosaur-killing impact crater explains buried circular hills|author=Hand, Eric|magazine=Scientific American|date=November 17, 2016|accessdate=November 4, 2017}}</ref> This global dispersal of dust and sulfates would have led to a sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature drops, and devastated the [[food chain]]. The researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life, but it also induced a vast subsurface [[Hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal system]] that became an oasis for the recovery of life.<ref name=kring/><ref>[https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/1212.pdf Probing the impact-generated hydrothermal system in the peak ring of the Chicxulub crater and its potential as a habitat].

A program on British television in 2017<ref>''The Day the Dinosaurs Died'', [[BBC2]] television, July 1, 2017, 6 to 7 pm</ref> described that the drilling revealed, from top down: thick Cenozoic limestone, about {{convert|600|m|abbr=on}}; a graded sediment deposit from the megatsunami, over {{cvt|100|m|||}} thick; the impact melted basement [[granite]] from the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|midcrust]] with [[shocked quartz]]. The peak ring itself did not contain the [[calcium sulfate]] that the rocks in the area around contain, leading the program makers to conclude that all the calcium sulfate in the crater area had been vaporized into the atmosphere and had become a dense [[sulfur dioxide]] veil stopping the sunlight. As additional clues of the resulting megatsunami found in a New Jersey, US quarry, a dense marine [[bone bed]] was found on the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary containing a mixture of dead sea animals with little or no damage from scavengers or predators. Also related to this tsunami was a dense dinosaur bone bed on the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary found in [[Patagonia]].

A 2020 study mentioned that Expedition 364 drilled to a depth of {{convert|1335|m|abbr=on}} below the sea floor to reach the peak ring, and discovered a massive hydrothermal system filled with magma, which modified ~1.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> km<sup>3</sup> of Earth’s crust and lasted for hundreds of thousands of years; in addition, those hydrothermal system might support the impact origin of life hypothesis for the [[Hadean]],<ref>{{cite news<!--|authors=David A.
