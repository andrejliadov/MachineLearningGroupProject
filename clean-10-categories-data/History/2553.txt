'''''Ab urbe condita''''' ({{IPA-la|ab ˈʊrbɛ ˈkɔndɪtaː|lang}}; 'from the [[founding of Rome|founding of the City]]'), or '''''Anno urbis conditae''''' ({{IPA-la|ˈan.n<sup>o̯</sup>‿ʊrbɪs ˈkɔndɪtae̯|lang}};  'in the year since the City's founding'),{{NoteTag|In literal grammar translation, ''ab urbe condita'' becomes English "from the founded city", and ''anno urbis conditae'' becomes "in the year of the founded city". While this produces odd-sounding English syntax, in Latin this manner of expression is valid, and in particular usual for the word ''condo'' ("to found", etc.) in the [[Classical Latin|Classical]] language; it conveys a tone that is somewhat more archaic and lofty.}} often abbreviated as '''AUC''', is an expression used in antiquity and by [[Classicist|classical historians]] to refer to a given year in [[Ancient Rome]]. In reference to the traditional year of the foundation of Rome, the year [[1 BC]] would be written AUC 753, whereas [[AD 1|1 AD]] would be AUC 754. The foundation of the [[Roman Empire]] in [[27 BC]] would be AUC 727.

Usage of the term was more common during the [[Renaissance]], when editors sometimes added AUC to Roman manuscripts they published, giving the false impression that the convention was commonly used in antiquity. In reality, the dominant method of identifying years in Roman times was to name the two [[Roman consul|consul]]s who held office that year. In late antiquity, [[regnal years]] were also in use, as in Roman Egypt during the [[Diocletian era]] after [[293|293 AD]], and in the [[Byzantine Empire]] from AD 537, following a decree by [[Justinian]].

==Significance==
The traditional date for the founding of Rome, 21 April 753 BC, is due to [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] (1st century BC). Varro may have used the consular list (with its mistakes) and called the year of the first consuls "''ab urbe condita'' 245," accepting the 244-year interval from [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] for the kings after the foundation of Rome. The correctness of this calculation has not been confirmed, but it is still used worldwide.

From the time of [[Claudius]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] AD 41 to AD 54) onward, this calculation superseded other contemporary calculations. Celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial [[propaganda]]. Claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honor of the anniversary of the city, in AD 48, the eight hundredth year from the founding of the city.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} [[Hadrian]], in AD 121, and [[Antoninus Pius]], in AD 147 and AD 148, held similar celebrations respectively.

In AD 248, [[Philip the Arab]] celebrated Rome's first [[millennium]], together with [[Ludi saeculares]] for Rome's alleged tenth [[saeculum]]. [[Coin]]s from his reign commemorate the celebrations. A coin by a contender for the imperial throne, [[Pacatianus]], explicitly states "[y]ear one thousand and first," which is an indication that the citizens of the empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a ''Sæculum Novum''.

The [[Anno Domini]] (AD) year numbering was developed by a monk named [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in Rome in AD 525, as a result of his work on calculating the date of Easter. Dionysius did not use the AUC convention, but instead based his calculations on the [[Diocletian era]]. This convention had been in use since AD 293, the year of the [[tetrarchy]], as it became impractical to use regnal years of the current emperor.<ref>[[J. David Thomas|Thomas, J. David]]. 1971. "On Dating by Regnal Years of Diocletian, Maximian and the Caesars." ''Chronique d'Égypte'' 46(91):173&#x2013;79. {{Doi|10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234}}.</ref> In his Easter table, the year AD 532 was equated with the 248th [[regnal year]] of  [[Diocletian]]. The table counted the years starting from the presumed birth of Christ, rather than the accession of the emperor [[Diocletian]] on 20 November AD 284 or, as stated by Dionysius: ''"sed magis elegimus ab incarnatione Domini nostri Jesu Christi annorum tempora praenotare"'' ("but rather we choose to name the times of the years from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ").<ref>[[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne, Jacques-Paul]]. 1865.

The year AD 1 corresponds to AUC 754, based on the epoch of [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]. Thus:

* AUC 1 = 753 BC ([[Foundation of Rome|Foundation of the Kingdom of Rome]])
* AUC 244 = 510 BC ([[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy]])
* AUC 490 = 264 BC ([[Punic Wars]]) 
* AUC 709 = 45 BC (First year of the [[Julian Calendar]]) 
* AUC 710 = 44 BC (The [[Assassination of Julius Caesar]])
* AUC 727 = 27 BC ([[Augustus]] became the first [[Roman Emperor]], starting the [[Principate]])
* AUC 753 = 1 BC
* AUC 754 = AD 1 
* AUC 1000 = AD 247
* AUC 1037 = AD 284 ([[Diocletian]] became Roman Emperor, starting the [[Dominate]])
* AUC 1229 = AD 476 ([[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] by the armies of [[Odoacer]])
* AUC 1246 = AD 493 (Establishment of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]])
* AUC 1306 = AD 553 (Italy under [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman control]])
* AUC 1507 = AD 754 (foundation of the [[Papal States]])
* AUC 1930 = AD 1177 (Papal States became independent from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]) 
* AUC 2000 = AD 1247
* AUC 2206 = AD 1453 ([[Fall of Constantinople]])
* AUC 2247 = AD 1494 ([[Italian Wars]])
* AUC 2542 = AD 1789 ([[French Revolution]])
* AUC 2556 = AD 1803 ([[Napoleonic Wars]])
* AUC 2601 = AD 1848 ([[Italian unification]])
* AUC 2623 = AD 1870 (Foundation of the [[Kingdom of Italy]])
* AUC 2699 = AD 1946 (Proclamation of the [[Italian Republic]])
* AUC 2753 = AD 2000
* AUC {{#expr:{{LASTYEAR}}+753}} = AD {{LASTYEAR}}
* AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} = AD {{CURRENTYEAR}}
* AUC {{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+753}} = AD {{NEXTYEAR}}
