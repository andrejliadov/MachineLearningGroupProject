The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to sinology:

'''[[Sinology]]''' is the study of China and things related to China. In today's usage, the term most often refers to work by non-Chinese or Chinese living outside China. ''Sino-'' is derived from [[Latin]] ''Sinae'' or ''[[Sinim]]'' ("the Chinese"), the origin of which is debatable. In the context of [[area studies]], sinology is usually known as '''Chinese studies'''.
