'''Algerism''' may refer to:

==Algerism as literary and political statement==

Refers to statements or remarks made about politics or sociology, extolling what the authors see as virtues of the fiction of [[Horatio Alger]], whose "[[rags-to-riches]]" [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] narratives of usually white, young, Christian men of good character, but poor circumstances, who pull themselves up from poverty to prosperity, were a quintessential tale of American [[Capitalism|capitalist]] prosperity that was a hallmark of 19th century [[Industrial Revolution|industrialist]] culture.  ''See also: [[Horatio Alger myth]]''

==Algerism as military scandal==

Refers to [[Secretary of War]] [[Russell A. Alger]] and the [[United States Army beef scandal]] during the [[Spanishâ€“American War]] in specific, but thereafter became common parlance in military circles for any military financial scandal that, through short-cuts or substitutions of shoddy material, brings harm to a nation's own military personnel and/or results in political scandal.
