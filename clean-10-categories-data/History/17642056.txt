[[Bantus (Somalia)|Bantus]] are a minority ethnic group in [[Somalia]], a country largely inhabited by [[Somali people|ethnic Somalis]]. They are the descendants of people from various Bantu ethnic groups originating from what are modern-day [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]] and [[Mozambique]] who were brought to Somalia as slaves in the 19th century. Bantus are ethnically, physically, and culturally distinct from Somalis, and have remained marginalized since their arrival in Somalia.<ref>L.

During the [[Somali Civil War]], which first began with the overthrow of the central government in 1991, many Bantus were evicted from their lands by various armed factions of Somali clans. Being visible minorities and possessing little in the way of firearms, the Bantus were particularly vulnerable to violence and looting by militiamen. Tens of thousands of Bantus fled to refugee camps in neighboring Kenya.<ref name="Refugees"/>

In the year 2000, the United States classified the Bantu as a priority and began preparations to resettle an estimated 12,000 Bantu refugees in select cities throughout the U.S.<ref name="SBCMALA">[http://www.sbcmala.org/index.html Somali Bantu Community Mutual Assistance Association of Lewiston/Auburn Maine]</ref> Most of the early arrivals in the United States settled in [[Clarkston, Georgia|Clarkston]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], a city adjacent to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. However, they were mostly assigned to low rent, poverty-stricken inner city areas, so many began to look to resettle elsewhere in the US, including Maine.<ref name="Bates">[http://www.bates.edu/pix/PerceivedBarriers09Jan20.pdf Perceived Barriers to Somali Immigrant Employment in Lewiston - A Supplement to Maineâ€™s Department of Labor Report]</ref>

In 2006, KPMG International released a study identifying the best places to do business around the world and ranked Lewiston as the best in New England.<ref name="Gstlabos">{{cite web|title=Global Study Touts Lewiston as a Business Opportunity Standout |url=http://ci.lewiston.me.us/news/2006/08-03-06b.htm |publisher=City of Lewiston |accessdate=4 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829033358/http://ci.lewiston.me.us/news/2006/08-03-06b.htm |archivedate=August 29, 2006 }}</ref>

In June 2011, the ''[[Lewiston Sun Journal]]'' reported a growing number of Bantu recent immigrants earning high school diplomas, with more enrolling in local community colleges. The university students consist of both adult undergraduate and continuing education pupils, as well as high school graduates.<ref name="Frctcag">[http://www.sunjournal.com/city/story/1044493 From refugee camp to cap and gown] - ''[[Lewiston Sun Journal]]''</ref><ref name="Mssgfs">[http://www.sunjournal.com/city/story/1040259 More Somali students graduate, find success] - ''[[Lewiston Sun Journal]]''</ref>
