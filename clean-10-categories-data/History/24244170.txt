Atterbury has written or edited over thirty books, mostly on [[ceramic]]s. He has published books of old postcards showing [[Eype]] and [[West Bay, Dorset|West Bay]], two [[Dorset]] villages. He is also known for his travel writing, and has written books on railways and canals. When [[British Waterways]] commissioned Robert Nicholson Publications to produce a series of guides to their waterways in the early 1970s, Atterbury and Andrew Darwin were supplied with a chartered boat and a student to drive it, in which they toured the canal network, producing the material for what became the first edition of the [[Nicholson Guides]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Fifty years of Nicholson's |first=Jonathan |last=Mosse |work=Waterways World |date=July 2019 |issn=0309-1422 |p=103}}</ref>
