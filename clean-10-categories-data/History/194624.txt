'''Afrocentrism''' (also '''Afrocentricity''') is an approach to the study of world history that focuses on the history of people of recent [[Africa]]n descent.<ref>"Recent" here means in the last few thousand years, as opposed to in the [[Stone Age]], for example [[Recent African origin of modern humans|70,000 years ago]]</ref> It is in some respects a response to global ([[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]]) attitudes about [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]] and their historical contributions; it seeks to correct what it sees as mistakes and ideas perpetuated by the racist philosophical underpinnings of western academic disciplines as they developed during and since Europe's [[Early Renaissance]] as justifying rationales for the enslavement of other peoples, in order to enable more accurate accounts of not only African but all people's contributions to world history.<ref>CC Verharen, "Molefi Asante...”, The Western Journal of Black Studies, (24)4, 2000, pp. 223–238</ref> Afrocentricity deals primarily with [[self-determination]] and African agency and is a [[Pan-African]] point of view for the study of culture, [[philosophy]], and history.<ref>[http://www.asante.net/articles/1/afrocentricity/ Asante on Afrocentricity].</ref><ref name="Africana">[[Henry Louis Gates|Gates, Henry Louis]], and [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] (eds), ''[[Encyclopedia Africana|Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African-American]]'' Volume 1, p. 111, Oxford University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-517055-5}}</ref>

Afrocentrism is a scholarly movement that seeks to conduct research and education on global history subjects, from the perspective of historical African peoples and polities. It takes a critical stance on Eurocentric assumptions and myths about world history, in order to pursue methodological studies of the latter. Some of the critics of the movement believe that it often denies or minimizes European, [[Near East]]ern, and [[Asian culture|Asian]] cultural influences while exaggerating certain aspects of historical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on the history of [[Africa]] and its role in contemporary African-American culture among others.

What is today broadly called Afrocentrism evolved out of the work of African-American intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but flowered into its modern form due to the activism of African-American intellectuals in the U.S. [[civil rights movement]] and in the development of [[African-American Studies]] programs in universities. However, following the development of universities in African colonies in the 1950s, African scholars became major contributors to African historiography.<ref>General History of Africa, Vol 1, p41, UNESCO, 1981</ref> A notable pioneer is the professor [[Kenneth Dike]] of the [[University of Ibadan]], who became chairman of the Committee on African Studies at Harvard in the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/obituaries/kenneth-o-dike-dies-in-a-nigerian-hospital.html|title=Kenneth O.

Afrocentrists led by Molefe Asante have organised their critics into three categories, Capitulationists, Europeanised Loyalists, and Maskers.

<blockquote>Capitulationists condemn Afrocentricity because they are uncomfortable with themselves and do not believe that Africans should be considered agents. They include amongst black scholars Anthony Appiah and Stanley Crouch. The functioning element for these critics is self-hatred, accompanied by the belief that these African critics are really nothing but whites in black skin. Their rejection of Afrocentricity is tied to their rejection of themselves. Europeanised Loyalists include many Marxists and integrationists such as Mary Lefkowitz, [[Stanley Crouch]], and Wilson Moses (staunch critics of Afrocentricity), who believe that blacks can do no good. These critics are strangers to the Afrocentric idea because they have immersed themselves in alien canon of knowledge without knowing African history. The last type, the Maskers, are the critics who are ashamed of Afrocentricity and therefore do all they can to conceal their identities. Their tragedy is that they seek to please the master so they attack Afrocentrists to prove to whites that they are like them. They fear that they may lose their careers<ref>MK Asante, Afrocentricity: The theory of social change..., p. 7; MK Asante</ref><ref>"Afrocentricity and its critics…” (available at http://science.jrank.org/pages/8216/Afrocentricity-Afrocentricity-Its-Critics.html, as accessed on 2 April 2016)</ref> </blockquote>

Afrocentrism has its origins in the work of [[Africa]]n and [[African diaspora]] intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, following social changes in the United States and Africa due both to the end of [[slavery]] and the decline of [[colonialism]]. Following the [[American Civil War]], African Americans in the [[Southern United States|South]] gathered together in communities to evade white control, established their own church congregations, and worked hard to gain education. They increasingly took more active public roles despite severe racial discrimination and segregation.<ref>Du Bois, W. E. B., ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880''.

In 1987, [[Martin Bernal]] published his ''[[Black Athena]]'', in which he claims that ancient Greece was colonized by northern invaders mixing with a colony established by [[Phoenicia]] (modern Lebanon). A major theme of the work is the alleged denial by Western academia of the African and (western) Asiatic influence on ancient Greek culture.

==Aspects==

===Afrocentricity book===
{{main|Afrocentricity (book)}}
In 2000, [[Molefi Kete Asante]], chair of the Department of African American Studies at [[Temple University]] gave a lecture at the [[University of Liverpool]] entitled "Afrocentricity: Toward a New Understanding of African Thought in this Millennium,"<ref>Kete Asante, Molefi, [http://www.asante.net/articles/Liverpool-Address.html "Afrocentricity: Toward a New Understanding of African Thought in this Millennium"], University of Liverpool, 2 August 2000, accessed 11 February 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302025412/http://www.asante.net/articles/Liverpool-Address.html |date=2 March 2009 }}.</ref> in which he presented many of his ideas:
* Africa has been betrayed by international commerce, by [[missionaries]] and [[imams]], by the structure of knowledge imposed by the Western world, by its own leaders, and by the ignorance of its own people of its past.
* [[Philosophy]] originated in Africa and the first philosophers in the world were Africans.
* Afrocentricity constitutes a new way of examining data, and a novel orientation to data; it carries with it assumptions about the current state of the African world.
* His aim is "to help lay out a plan for the recovery of African place, respectability, accountability, and leadership."
* Afrocentricity can stand its ground among any ideology or religion: Marxism, [[Islam]], Christianity, Buddhism, or [[Judaism]]. Your Afrocentricity will emerge in the presence of these other ideologies because it is from you.
* Afrocentrism is the only ideology that can liberate African people.

Asante also stated:
{{quote|As a cultural configuration, the Afrocentric idea is distinguished by five characteristics:
# an intense interest in psychological location as determined by symbols, motifs, rituals, and signs.
# a commitment to finding the subject-place of Africans in any social, political, economic, or religious phenomenon with implications for questions of sex, gender, and class.
# a defence of African cultural elements as historically valid in the context of art, music, and literature.
# a celebration of centeredness and agency and a commitment to lexical refinement that eliminates pejoratives about Africans or other people.
# a powerful imperative from historical sources to revise the collective text of African people.}}
However, Wilson J. Moses, said of Asante: "His second book, ''The Afrocentric Idea'' (1987), was a creative and in some respects brilliant but rambling theoretical work, much influenced by the revolution in "[[critical theory]]" that occurred in American intellectual life during the late 1970s and early 1980s." Some also assert that the definition of Afrocentricity has never sat still long enough to be properly described and accurately critiqued.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Afrocentric education===
{{Main|Afrocentric education}}
Afrocentric education is education designed to empower peoples of the African diaspora. A central premise behind it is that many Africans have been subjugated by limiting their awareness of themselves and indoctrinating them with ideas that work against them.<ref>Woodson, Dr. Carter G. (1933). ''The Mis-Education of the Negro''. Khalifah's Booksellers & Associates.</ref> To control a people's culture is to control their tools of self-determination in relationship to others.<ref>Akbar, Dr. Na'im (1998).</ref> Like [[Paulo Freire|educational leaders of other cultures]], proponents assert that what educates one group of people does not necessarily educate and empower another group–so they assert educational priorities distinctly for the Africans in a given context.

===Afrocentric theology===
{{Further|Black theology|Black church}}
The [[black church]] in the United States developed out of the [[creolization]] of African spirituality and European-American [[Christianity]]; early members of the churches made certain stories their own{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. During the [[American Civil War|antebellum]] years, the idea of deliverance out of [[slavery]], as in the story of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], was especially important{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. After [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the restoration of white supremacy, their hope was based on deliverance from segregation and other abuses{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. They found much to respond to in the idea of a personal relationship with [[Jesus]], and shaped their churches by the growth of music and worship styles that related to African as well as European-American traditions.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Twentieth-century "Africentric approaches" to Christian [[theology]] and preaching have been more deliberate. Writers and thinkers emphasize "Black presence" in the [[Christian Bible]], including the idea of a "[[Race of Jesus|Black Jesus]]".<ref>Peters, Ronald Edward (ed.), ''Africentric Approaches to Christian Ministry: Strengthening Urban Congregations in African American Communities'', University Press of America (2006), {{ISBN|978-0-7618-3264-5}}.</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

Afrocentrists have condemned what they consider to be attempts at dividing African peoples into racial clusters as new versions of discredited theories, such as the [[Hamitic#Hamitic hypothesis|Hamitic hypothesis]] and the [[Dynastic Race Theory]]. These theories, they contend, attempted to identify certain African ethnicities, such as Nubians, Ethiopians and Somalis, as "Caucasoid" groups that entered Africa to bring civilization to the natives. They believe that Western academics have traditionally limited the peoples they defined as "Black" Africans to those south of the [[Sahara]], but used broader "Caucasoid" or related categories to classify peoples of Egypt or North Africa. Afrocentrists also believe strongly in the work of certain anthropologists who have suggested that there is little evidence to support that the first North African populations were closely related to "Caucasoids" of Europe and western Asia.<ref name="Hiernaux"/>

In 1964 Afrocentric scholar [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] expressed a belief in such a double standard:
{{quote|But it is only the most gratuitous theory that considers the Dinka, the Nouer and the Masai, among others, to be Caucasoids. What if an African ethnologist were to persist in recognising as white only the blond, blue-eyed Scandinavians, and systematically refused membership to the remaining Europeans, and Mediterraneans in particular—the French, Italians, Greek, Spanish, and Portuguese? Just as the inhabitants of Scandinavia and the Mediterranean countries must be considered as two extreme poles of the same anthropological reality, so should the Negroes of East and West Africa be considered as the two extremes in the reality of the Negro world. To say that a Shillouk, a Dinka, or a Nouer is a Caucasoid is for an African as devoid of sense and scientific interest as would be, to a European, an attitude that maintained that a Greek or a Latin were not of the same race.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}}}

French historian Jean Vercoutter has claimed that [[archaeological]] workers routinely classified Negroid remains as Mediterranean, even though they found such remains in substantial numbers with ancient artefacts.<ref>Jean Vercoutter, ''The Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering Meroitic Script''. Paris: UNESCO, 1978, pp. 15–36.</ref>

Some Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} have adopted a [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africanist]] perspective that people of color are all "African people" or "[[diaspora|diasporic]] Africans," citing physical characteristics they exhibit in common with Black Africans. Afrocentric scholar [[Runoko Rashidi]] writes that they are all part of the "global African community." Some Afrocentric writers include in the [[African diaspora]] the [[Dravidians]] of India, "[[Negrito]]s" of Southeast Asia ([[Thailand]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Malaysia]]); and the [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] peoples of Australia and Melanesia.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas theories===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas contact theories}}
In the 1970s, [[Ivan van Sertima]] advanced the theory that the complex civilizations of the Americas were the result of trans-oceanic influence from the Egyptians or other African civilizations. Such a claim is his primary thesis in ''They Came Before Columbus'', published in 1978. The few [[Trans-cultural diffusion|hyper-diffusionist]] writers seek to establish that the [[Olmec]] people, who built the first highly complex civilization in [[Mesoamerica]] and are considered by some to be the mother civilization for all other civilizations of Mesoamerica, were deeply influenced by Africans. Van Sertima said that the Olmec civilization was a hybrid one of Africans and Native Americans. His theory of pre-Columbian American-African contact has since met with considerable and detailed opposition by scholars of Mesoamerica. Van Sertima has been accused of "doctoring" and twisting data to fit his conclusions, inventing evidence, and ignoring the work of respected Central and South American scholars in the advance of his own theory.<ref name="Ortiz1997"/>

Scholars have challenged the various assertions of Afrocentrists on the cultural and biological characteristics of Ancient Egyptian civilization and its people. At a [[UNESCO]] Symposium in the 1970s, the vast majority of the delegates repudiated the Afrocentric assertions.<ref>UNESCO, "Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script; Proceedings", (Paris, 1978), pp. 3–134.</ref> [[Zahi Hawass]] has gone on record as saying that the Ancient Egyptians were not black and Ancient Egypt was not a Black African Civilization.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Despite contestations, [[UNESCO]] decided to include his "Origin of the ancient Egyptians" in the General History of Africa, with an editorial comment mentioning the disagreement. 
The ancient world did not employ racial categories such as "Black" or "White" as they had no conception of "race", but rather labeled groups according to their land of origin and cultural traits. However, [[S. O. Y. Keita]], a biological anthropologist studying the controversy, finds simplistic political appellations (in the negative or affirmative) describing ancient populations as "black" or "white" to be inaccurate and instead focuses on the ancestry of ancient Egypt as being a part of the native and diverse biological variation of Africa, which includes a variety of phenotypes and skin gradients.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/an.2007.48.9.19 | volume=48 | title=Advancing Biocultural Perspectives: Optimism from a Workshop | year=2007 | journal=Anthropology News | pages=19–20 | last1 = AgustÃ | issue=9 }}; see also "Forensic Misclassification of Ancient Nubian Crania: Implications for Assumptions About Human Variation", Frank L'Engle Williams, Robert L.

===Hamitic hypothesis===
Stephen Howe summarizes the development of the Hamitic hypothesis in the 19th and 20th centuries as Eurocentric. He further describes how some Afrocentric writers adopted 'their version' of it. Howe distinguishes three clusters of controversies related to the history of [[Ancient Egypt]]. About the third cluster he says that these are "controversies that have been especially salient in relation to the United States, have interacted heavily with sensitive issues of current public policy, and involve questions both wide and fundamentally about the United States."<ref>{{cite book|author=Howe, Stephen|title=Afrocentrism: mythical pasts and imagined homes|url=https://archive.org/details/afrocentrism00step|url-access=registration|publisher=Verso|location=London|year=1998}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

==Criticism==
Within Afrocentrism, claims were forwarded involving the contention that African civilizations were founding influences on such distant civilizations as the American [[Olmec]] and the Chinese [[Xia Dynasty|Xia]] cultures.<ref name=Ortiz1997/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dcn.davis.ca.us/~gizmo/2001/clarence.html |title=Clarence Walker encourages black Americans to discard Afrocentrism |accessdate=13 November 2007 |last=Sherwin |first=Elisabeth |publisher=Davis Community Network | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071017065428/http://dcn.davis.ca.us/~gizmo/2001/clarence.html| archivedate= 17 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

[[Yaacov Shavit]], a critic of the movement, summarises its goals in the preface to his book ''[[History in Black]]'',<ref name="ReferenceA">Yaacov Shavit, ''History in Black: African-Americans in Search of an Ancient Past'', Frank Cass Publishers, 2001, pp. vii.</ref> in which he states:
{{quote|Thus, if historical myths and legends, or an invented history, play such a major role in the founding of every national reconstruction, the question that should concern us here is the nature of the distinct style in which black Americans imagine their past. The answer to this question is that radical Afrocentrism, the subject of this study, which plays a central role in shaping the modern historical world-view of a large section of the African-American (or Afro-American) community, is far more than an effort to follow the line taken by many [[ethnic]] groups and nations in modern rewriting, inventing or developing collective identity and national history. Rather, it is a large-scale historical project to rewrite the history of the whole of humankind from an Afrocentric point of view. The result is a new reconstruction of world history: it is a universal history.}}

Other critics{{Who|date=October 2015}} contend that some Afrocentric historical research is grounded in [[identity politics]] and [[mythology|myth]] rather than scholarship.<ref name="Lefkowitz1996">{{cite book

[[Mary Lefkowitz]], Professor Emerita of Classical Studies at [[Wellesley College]] in Massachusetts, has rejected [[George James (writer)|George James]]'s theories about Egyptian contributions to Greek civilization as being faulty scholarship. She notes that he used sources that predated the deciphering of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. He failed to acknowledge that many of his theories were overturned by the evidence of later findings. She contends that ancient Egyptian texts show little similarity to Greek philosophy. Lefkowitz also pointed out that [[Aristotle]] could not have stolen his ideas from the great [[Library at Alexandria]] as James suggested, because the library was founded ''after'' Aristotle's death. Because of such fundamental errors of fact, Lefkowitz has criticized Afrocentrism as "an excuse to teach myth as history."<ref name="Lefkowitz1996"/>{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1994, the Manhattan Institute, a public policy forum, published ''Alternatives to Afrocentrism'', a collection of highly critical essays by, among others, Lefkowitz, [[Gerald Early]], Stanley Crouch, Wilson Moses, and Frank Yurco. Early, an African American, has been especially critical and dismisses Afrocentrism as just another North American experiment in "group therapy," a kind of "intellectual [[fast food]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 2002, Ibrahim Sundiata noted in the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' that 
{{quote|The word "Afrocentric" has been traced by Derrick Alridge to the American historian W.E.B. Du Bois, who employed it in the early 1960s. During the 1970s, Molefi Kete Asante appropriated the term, insisting that he was the only person equipped to define it, and asserting that even the holy archangels Du Bois and [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] had an imperfect and immature grasp of a concept that finds ultimate expression in his own pontifications. Subsequently, it became a catchall "floating signifier," nebulous, unstable, and infinitely mutable.<ref>[http://way.net/dissonance/sundiata.html Ibrahim Sundiata, "The Argument We Are Really Having"], ''American Historical Review'', (1996).</ref>}}

[[Cain Hope Felder]], a Professor of [[New Testament]] Language and Literature at [[Howard University]] and supporter of Afrocentric ideas, has warned Afrocentrists to avoid certain pitfalls,<ref name="cain">{{cite journal | last1 = Hope Felder | first1 = Cain | year = 1994 | title = Afrocentrism, the Bible, and the Politics of Difference | url = http://www.nathanielturner.com/twoscholarsdiscussafrocentrism.htm | journal = The Princeton Seminary Bulletin | volume = XV | issue = 2 }}</ref> including:
* Demonizing categorically all white people, without careful differentiation between persons of goodwill and those who consciously perpetuate racism.
* Adopting [[multiculturalism]] as a curricular alternative that eliminates, marginalizes, or vilifies European heritage to the point that Europe epitomizes all the evil in the world.
* Gross over-generalizations and using factually or incorrect material is bad history and bad scholarship.<ref name="cain"/>

[[Nathan Glazer]] writes that although Afrocentricity can mean many things, the popular press has generally given most attention to its most outlandish theories.<ref name="Glazer1997">Nathan Glazer, ''We Are All Multiculturalists Now'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-674-94836-X}}.</ref> Glazer agrees with many of the findings and conclusions presented in Lefkowitz's book ''Not Out of Africa''. Yet he also argues that Afrocentrism often presents legitimate and relevant scholarship.<ref name="Glazer1997"/> The late [[Manning Marable]] was also a critic of Afrocentrism. He wrote:<ref name="autogenerated192"/>
{{Quote|Populist Afrocentrism was the perfect social theory for the upwardly mobile black petty bourgeoisie. It gave them a sense of ethnic superiority and cultural originality, without requiring the hard, critical study of historical realities. It provided a philosophical blueprint to avoid concrete struggle within the real world.... It was, in short, only the latest theoretical construct of a politics of racial identity, a world-view designed to discuss the world but never really to change it.|Manning Marable|''Beyond Black and White: Transforming African American Politics''}}

Some Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} agree in rejecting those works which critics have characterized as examples of bad scholarship. Adisa A. Alkebulan notes that the work of Afrocentric scholars is not fully appreciated because critics use the claims of "a few non-Afrocentrists" as "an indictment against Afrocentricity."<ref name="DefendingtheParadigm">Adisa A. Alkebulan, "Defending the Paradigm", ''Journal of Black Studies'', Vol. 37, No. 3, pp. 410–427 (2007).</ref>

In 1996, the historian [[August Meier]] critically reviewed the new work of Mary Lefkowitz on Afrocentrism as "Eurocentric". He criticized her book ''Not out of Africa: How Afrocentrism became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History'' for what he saw as her neglect of the African-American historic literature of the 19th and 20th centuries. Meier believes she fails to take the African-American experiences into account, to the extent that she "fails to answer the question raised in this book's subtitle".<ref>Meier, August, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2945660 "Review: Mary Lefkowitz, ''Not out of Africa: How Afrocentrism became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History''"], ''Journal of American History'', December 1996.</ref>

[[Maghan Keita]] describes the controversy over Afrocentrism as a [[cultural war]]. He believes certain "epistemologies" are warring with each other: the "epistemology of blackness" argues for the "responsibilities and potential of black peoples to function in and contribute to the progress of civilization."<ref>Maghan Keita, ''Race and the Writing of History: Riddling the Sphinx'', p. 7.</ref>
