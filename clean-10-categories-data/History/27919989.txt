This '''timeline of European exploration''' lists major geographic discoveries and other firsts credited to or involving Europeans during the [[Age of Discovery]] and [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|the following centuries]], between the years AD 1418 and 1957.

Despite several significant transoceanic and transcontinental explorations by European civilizations in the preceding centuries, the precise geography of the Earth outside of [[Europe]] was largely unknown to Europeans before the 15th century, when technological advances (especially in [[seafaring|sea travel]]) as well as the rise of [[colonialism]], [[mercantilism]], and a host of other social, cultural, and economic changes made it possible to organize large-scale exploratory expeditions to uncharted parts of the globe.

The [[Age of Discovery]] arguably began in the early 15th century with the rounding of the feared [[Cape Bojador]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] exploration of the west coast of [[Africa]], while in the last decade of the century the [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish]] sent expeditions far across the Atlantic, where the [[Americas]] would eventually be reached, and the Portuguese found a sea route to [[India]]. In the 16th century, various European states funded expeditions to the interior of both North and South America, as well as to their respective west and east coasts, north to [[California]] and [[Labrador]] and south to [[Chile]] and [[Tierra del Fuego]]. In the 17th century, [[Russian Empire|Russian]] explorers conquered [[Siberia]] in search of sables, while the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] contributed greatly to the charting of [[Australia]]. The 18th century witnessed the first extensive explorations of the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] and [[Oceania]] and the exploration of [[Alaska]], while the 19th was dominated by exploration of the [[polar region]]s and excursions into the heart of Africa. By the early 20th century, the poles themselves had been reached.
