'''Achaemenes''' ({{lang-peo|'''Hakhāmaneš'''}}) was the [[apical ancestor]] of  the [[Achaemenid dynasty]] of rulers of [[Persia]].

Other than his role as an apical ancestor, nothing is known of his life or actions. It is quite possible that Achaemenes was only the mythical ancestor of the [[Persis|Persian]] royal house, but if Achaemenes was a historical person, he would have lived around the end of the 8th century and the beginning of the 7th century BC.<ref name=dandamayev>{{citation|last=Dandamayev|first=M.

== Name ==
The name used in European languages ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀχαιμένης}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|Achaiménēs}}''), {{lang-la|Achaemenes}}) ultimately derives from [[Old Persian]] ''{{lang|peo-Latn|Haxāmaniš}}'' ({{lang|peo|𐏃𐎧𐎠𐎶𐎴𐎡𐏁}}), as found together with [[Elamite]] {{lang|elx|𒄩𒀝𒋡𒉽𒉡𒆜}} (''Ha-ak-ka-man-nu-iš'' or ''Hâkamannuiš'') and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] {{lang|akk|𒀀𒄩𒈠𒉌𒅖𒀪}} (''A-ḫa-ma-ni-iš-ʾ'') in the non-contemporaneous trilingual [[Behistun Inscription]] of [[Darius I]]. The Old Persian proper name is traditionally derived from ''{{lang|peo-Latn|haxā-}}'' "friend" and ''{{lang|peo-Latn|manah}}'' "thinking power", yielding  "having a friend's mind."<ref name="schmitt" /> A more recent interpretation reads ''{{lang|peo-Latn|haxā-}}'' as "follower", giving "characterized by a follower's spirit."<!-- both in schmitt --><ref name="schmitt">{{citation|last=Schmitt|first=Rüdiger|chapter=Achaemenid dynasty|title=Encyclopædia Iranica|series=vol. I, fasc. 4|year=1983|pages=414–426|location=Costa Mesa|publisher=Mazda|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/achaemenid-dynasty}}.</ref> The name is spelled {{lang|fa|هخامنش}} (Haxâmaneš) in [[Persian language|Modern Persian]].

== Historicity ==
In the [[Behistun inscription]] (''c.'' 490 BC), [[Darius I]] portrays Achaemenes as the father of [[Teispes]], ancestor of [[Cyrus II]] (Cyrus the Great) and [[Darius I]].<ref name=dandamayev /> The mid-5th century BC ''Histories'' (7.11) of Herodotus has essentially the same story, but fuses two parallel lines of descent from "Teispes son of Achaemenes". Beyond such brief mentions of the name, nothing is known of the figure behind it, neither from indigenous sources nor from historiographic ones. It may be that Achaemenes was just a mythical ancestor, not a historical one.<ref name=dandamayev /><ref>Bourke, Stephen (ed.) ''The Middle East: The Cradle of Civilization Revealed'' p. 216</ref> Many scholars believe he was a ruler of [[Parsua|Parsumash]], a vassal state of the [[Medes|Median Empire]], and that from there he led armies against the [[Assyria]]n king [[Sennacherib]] in 681 BC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Achaemenes-Persian-ruler-of-Parsumash|title=Achaemenes {{!}} Persian ruler of Parsumash|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}</ref>

=== Behistun inscription ===
It may be that the [[Behistun inscription]]'s claim of descent from Achaemenes was an invention of Darius I, in order to justify the latter's seizure of the throne. Cyrus II does not mention Achaemenes at all in the detailed genealogy given in the [[Cyrus cylinder]].<ref name=dandamayev /> While the patronym ''haxāmanišiya''&mdash;"of [the clan of] Achaemenes"&mdash;does appear in an inscription at [[Pasargadae]] attributed to Cyrus II, this inscription may have been written on the order of Darius I after Cyrus' death.<ref name=dandamayev /><ref name=Bruce>Bruce Lincoln. Religion, empire, and torture: the case of Achaemenian Persia, 2007, University of Chicago Press, Page 4–5</ref> As such, Achaemenes could be a retrograde creation of Darius the Great,<ref name=enc>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East, Volume 1|author=Jamie Stokes|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2009|pages=2–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&q=origin+of+achaemenid+empire+origin&pg=PA2|isbn=978-0-8160-7158-6}}</ref> made in order to legitimize a dynastic relationship to Cyrus the Great. Darius certainly had much to gain in having an ancestor shared by Cyrus and himself (however, Teispes was already one), and may have felt the need for a stronger connection than that provided by his subsequent marriage to Cyrus' daughter [[Atossa]].

=== Greek writers ===
The Greek writers of antiquity preserve several legends surrounding the figure:<ref>{{citation|last=Tavernier|first=Jan| title=Iranica in the Achaemenid Period (ca. 550–330 B.C.): Linguistic Study of Old Iranian Proper Names and Loanwords, Attested in Non-Iranian Texts |publisher=Peeters|year=2007|isbn=978-90-429-1833-7}}.</ref> The late 4th-century BC ''[[First Alcibiades|Alcibiades]]'' (120e) of (Pseudo-)Plato<!-- do not link: Pseudo-Plato is not Plato--> portrays Achaemenes as the hero-founder of the Persái in the same way that the Greeks are descended from [[Heracles]], and that both Achaemenes and Hercules were sons of [[Perseus]], son of [[Zeus]]. This is generally assumed to be an identification of Achaemenes with [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]] (i.e. the son of Perseus and [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]) who in Greek mythology was imagined to be the ancestor of the "Persians". Another version of the tale makes Achaemenes the son of [[Aegeus]], yet another founder-hero of legend. The 3rd-century [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelianus]] (''De nat. anim.'' 12.21) has Achaemenes being bred by an eagle.<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Achaemenes|volume=1|page=142}}</ref>
