'''Lake Ilopango''' is a [[Volcanic crater lake|crater lake]] which fills an 8 by 11&nbsp;km (72&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or 28 sq mi) volcanic [[caldera]] in central [[El Salvador]], on the borders of the [[San Salvador Department|San Salvador]], [[La Paz Department (El Salvador)|La Paz]], and [[Cuscatlán Department|Cuscatlán]] departments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lake Ilopango|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/283182/Lake-Ilopango|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=13 July 2012}}</ref>  The caldera, which contains the second largest lake in the country and is immediately east of the capital city, [[San Salvador]], has a scalloped {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} high rim.<ref name=gvp/> Any surplus drains via the [[Jiboa River]] to the Pacific Ocean. An eruption of the Ilopango volcano is considered a possible source for the [[extreme weather events of 535–536]]. The local military airbase, [[Ilopango International Airport]], has annual airshows where international pilots from all over the world fly over San Salvador City and Ilopango lake.

Four major [[dacite|dacitic]]–[[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] eruptions occurred during the late [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]], producing [[pyroclastic flow]]s and [[tephra]] that blanketed much of the country.<ref name="gvp"/>

The caldera collapsed most recently<ref name=gvp>{{cite gvp | vnum=343060 | title=Ilopango: Eruptive History}}</ref> sometime between 410 and 535 AD (based on radiocarbon dating of plant life directly related to the eruption),<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dull |first=Robert A. |author2=Southon, John R. |author3=Sheets, Payson  |year=2001 |title=Volcanism, Ecology and Culture: A Reassessment of the Volcan Ilopango Tbj eruption in the Southern Maya Realm |journal=Latin American Antiquity |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=25–44 |doi=10.2307/971755|publisher=Latin American Antiquity, Vol. 12, No. 1 |jstor= 971755 }}, esp. p.27.</ref> which produced widespread [[pyroclastic flow]]s and devastated [[Maya civilization|Mayan cities]]; however, a team of scientists concluded that the volcanic eruption might have happened in 431 AD ±2, based on volcanic shards taken from ice cores in [[Greenland]], levels of [[sulphur]] recorded in ice cores from [[Antarctica]], and radiocarbon dating of a charred tree found in volcanic ash deposits.<ref name=":0">{{cite news |author=Victoria C.

The "ash-cloud fallout ... blanketed an area of at least 10,000 square kilometers waist-deep in pumice and ash", which would have stopped all agricultural endeavor in the area for decades.

It was hypothesized that this eruption caused the [[extreme weather events of 535–536]] in Europe and Asia, but this is unlikely given the research published in 2020 that dates the eruption to 431 AD.<ref name=":0" />

Later eruptions formed several [[lava dome]]s within the lake and near its shore.
