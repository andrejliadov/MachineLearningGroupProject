==Eruption==
[[File:010607-0930-17 - Nea Kameni - Krater.jpg|alt=Small figures of people can be seen at the top looking into craters strewn with grey rocks.|thumb|250px|right|Volcanic craters on Santorini, June 2001]]

===Background===
{{Main|Santorini caldera}}
Geological evidence shows the Thera volcano erupted numerous times over several hundred thousand years before the Minoan eruption. In a repeating process, the volcano would violently erupt, then eventually collapse into a roughly circular seawater-filled [[caldera]], with numerous small islands forming the circle. The caldera would slowly refill with magma, building a new volcano, which erupted and then collapsed in an ongoing cyclical process.<ref name="Friedrich Book">{{cite book|author=Friedrich, WL|year=1999|title=Fire in the Sea, the Santorini Volcano: Natural History and the Legend of Atlantis|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-65290-1}}</ref>

Immediately before the Minoan eruption, the walls of the caldera formed a nearly continuous ring of islands, with the only entrance between Thera and the tiny island of [[Aspronisi]].<ref name="Friedrich Book"/> This cataclysmic eruption was centered on a small island just north of the existing island of [[Nea Kameni]] in the centre of the then-existing caldera. The northern part of the caldera was refilled by the [[volcanic ash]] and lava, then collapsed again.

===Magnitude===
Research by a team of international scientists in 2006 revealed that the Santorini event was much larger than the original estimate of {{convert|39|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} of [[dense-rock equivalent]] (DRE) that was published in 1991.<ref name=URI2006>{{cite news|url=http://www.uri.edu/news/releases/?id=3654|title=Santorini eruption much larger than originally believed|date=23 August 2006|newspaper=University of Rhode Island|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>  With an estimated DRE in excess of {{convert|60|km3|cumi|abbr=on}},<ref name=URI2006/><ref name="Sigurdsson"/> the volume of [[ejecta]] was approximately {{convert|100|km3|cumi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=GVP>{{cite gvp | vnum=0102-04=&volpage=erupt | title = Santorini – Eruptive history | accessdate= 2009-01-01}}</ref> If so, the eruption's [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] was 7. The volcano ejected up to four times as much as the well-recorded eruption by [[Krakatoa]] in 1883. The Thera volcanic events and subsequent ashfall probably destroyed all indigenous life, as occurred on Krakatoa. Only the [[1815 eruption of Mount Tambora|Mount Tambora]] volcanic eruption of 1815, [[1257 Samalas eruption|Mount Samalas eruption of 1257]], Lake Taupo's [[Hatepe eruption]] around 180&nbsp;CE, and perhaps the [[946 eruption of Paektu Mountain|Paektu Mountain]] eruption of 946&nbsp;CE released more material into the atmosphere during historic times.<ref name="Oppenheimer2003"/><ref name="McCoy2002"/>

===Sequence===
On [[Santorini]], there is a {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick layer of white [[tephra]] that overlies the soil clearly delineating the ground level before the eruption. This layer has three distinct bands that indicate the different phases of the eruption.<ref>{{cite conference|author=Davidson, DA |title=Aegean Soils During the Second Millennium B.C. with Reference to Thera |book-title=Thera and the Aegean World I.

The thinness of the first ash layer, along with the lack of noticeable erosion of that layer by winter rains before the next layer was deposited, indicate that the volcano gave the local population a few months' warning. Since no human remains have been found at the [[Akrotiri (prehistoric city)|Akrotiri site]], this preliminary volcanic activity probably caused the island's population to flee. It is also suggested that several months before the eruption, Santorini experienced one or more earthquakes, which damaged the local settlements.<ref name="McCoy">{{cite book |title=Geoinformation Technologies for Geocultural Landscapes |editor1-last=Vassilopoulos |editor1-first=Andreas|last1=Gournelos |first1=Theodoros |last2=Evelpidou |first2=Niki|last3=Vassilopoulos |first3=Andreas|last4=Chartidou |first4=Konstantia |year=2008 |publisher=CRC Press|chapter=Geomorphological Study of Thera |isbn=978-0-415-46859-6|page=247}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference| first1=G |last1=Heiken |author2=McCoy, F|title=Precursory Activity to the Minoan Eruption, Thera, Greece|book-title=Thera and the Aegean World III, Vol 2|pages=79–88|publisher=The Thera Foundation|year=1990|location=London}}</ref><ref name="Sivertsen">{{cite book |title=The Parting of the Sea: How Volcanoes, Earthquakes, and Plagues Shaped the Story of the Exodus |last=Sivertsen |first=Barbara J. |year=2009 |publisher=Princeton University Press |chapter=The Minoan Eruption |isbn=978-0-691-13770-4 |page=25}}</ref>

==Geomorphology==
[[File:Santoryn-Ia 4.jpg|alt=Enclave of structures built into the side of a steep cliff. Swimming pools are visible.|thumb|250px|Mansions and hotels on the steep cliffs.]]
Although the fracturing process is not yet known, the altitudinal statistical analysis indicates that the caldera had formed just before the eruption. The area of the island was smaller, and the southern and eastern coastlines appeared regressed. During the eruption, the landscape was covered by the pumice sediments. In some places, the coastline vanished under thick [[tuff]] depositions. In others, recent coastlines were extended towards the sea. After the eruption, the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the pumice was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones.<ref name="Gournelos">{{cite book | last1 = Gournelos | first1 = T | last2 = Evelpidou | first2 = N | last3 = Vassilopolous | first3 = A | last4 = Konstantia | first4 = C | title = Geoinformation technologies for geocultural landscapes: European perspective | chapter = Geomorphological Study of Thera and the Akrotiri Archeological Site |editor1= A Vassilopoulos |editor2=N Evelpidou |editor3=O Bender |editor4=A Krek | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2008 | pages = 237–54 | isbn = 978-0-415-46859-6}}</ref>

==Volcanology==
The eruption was of the [[Plinian eruption|Ultra Plinian type]], and it resulted in an estimated {{convert|30|to|35|km|abbr=on}} high [[eruption column]] which reached the [[stratosphere]]. In addition, the [[magma]] underlying the volcano came into contact with the shallow marine [[embayment]], resulting in violent [[Phreatomagmatic eruption|phreatomagmatic blasts]].

The eruption also generated {{convert|35|to|150|m|abbr=on}} high [[tsunami]]s that devastated the northern coastline of [[Crete]], {{convert|110|km|abbr=on}} away. The tsunami affected coastal towns such as [[Amnisos]], where building walls were knocked out of alignment. On the island of [[Anafi]], {{convert|27|km|abbr=on}} to the east, ash layers {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}} deep have been found, as well as [[pumice]] layers on slopes {{convert|250|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

Elsewhere in the Mediterranean are pumice deposits that could have been sent by the Thera eruption. Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from lakes in [[Turkey]], however, show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of [[Santorini]]. The ash found on Crete is now known to have been from a precursory phase of the eruption, some weeks or months before the main eruptive phases, and it would have had little impact on the island.<ref name="Keenan"/> Santorini ash deposits were at one time claimed to have been found in the [[Nile delta]],<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Stanley, DJ  |author2=Sheng, H |name-list-style=amp |year=1986|title=Volcanic shards from Santorini (Upper Minoan ash) in the Nile Delta, Egypt|journal=Nature|volume=320, 1986|pages=733–35|doi=10.1038/320733a0|issue=6064|bibcode = 1986Natur.320..733S |s2cid=4043371 }}</ref> but this is now known to be a misidentification.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Guichard, F | year = 1993 | title = Tephra from the Minoan eruption of Santorini in sediments of the Black Sea | journal = Nature | volume = 363 | issue = 6430 | pages= 610–12 | doi = 10.1038/363610a0 |bibcode = 1993Natur.363..610G | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Carey | first2 = S. | last3 = Arthur | first3 = M.

==Eruption dating==
The Minoan eruption is an important [[marker horizon]] for the [[Bronze Age]] chronology of the Eastern Mediterranean realm. It provides a fixed point for aligning the entire chronology of the second millennium BCE in the Aegean, as evidence of the eruption is found throughout the region. Despite the evidence, the exact date of the eruption has been difficult to determine. Archaeologists have traditionally placed it at approximately 1500&nbsp;BCE.<ref name="Sivertsen"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Warren P.M.|title=Timelines: Studies in Honour of Manfred Bietak (Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta 149)|veditors=Czerny E, Hein I, Hunger H, Melman D, Schwab A |publisher=Peeters |location=Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium |year=2006|pages=2: 305–21 |isbn=90-429-1730-X}}</ref> Radiocarbon dates, including analysis of an [[olive|olive branch]] buried beneath a lava flow from the volcano that gave a date between 1627&nbsp;BCE and 1600&nbsp;BCE (95% [[confidence interval]]), suggest an eruption date more than a century earlier than suggested by archaeologists.<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Friedrich|first1=Walter L|author2= Kromer, B, Friedrich, M, Heinemeier, J, Pfeiffer, T, and Talamo, S|title=Santorini Eruption Radiocarbon Dated to 1627–1600 B.C.|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5773|page=548|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=2006|doi=10.1126/science.1125087|accessdate=2007-03-10| pmid=16645088|s2cid=35908442| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5773/548}}</ref><ref name="Manning">{{cite journal| last1=Manning|first1=Sturt W|author2=Ramsey, CB, Kutschera, W, Higham, T, Kromer, B, Steier, P, and Wild, EM|title=Chronology for the Aegean Late Bronze Age 1700–1400 B.C.|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5773|pages=565–69|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|year=2006|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;312/5773/565|doi=10.1126/science.1125682|accessdate=2007-03-10| pmid=16645092|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..565M |s2cid=21557268}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | first = SW | last = Manning | contribution = Clarifying the "high" v.

In 2012,  Felix Höflmayer argued that archaeological evidence could be consistent with a date as early as 1570 BCE, reducing the discrepancy to around 50 years.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Felix|last=Höflmayer|title=The Date of the Minoan Santorini Eruption: Quantifying the "Offset"|journal=Radiocarbon|date=2012|number=3–4|volume=54|page=444|doi=10.1017/S0033822200047196|doi-access=free}}</ref> He reviews the various archaeological and technical dating results to conclude: 
"(1) Short-Lived Samples from Akrotiri (Thera)...resulting in a date between 1664 and 1651 cal BCE (20.1% probability) or between 1642 and 1616 cal BCE (48.1% probability);
(2) (Branch of an Olive Tree) A wiggle-match for these 4 dates based on the published results  indicates a date between 1621 and 1605 cal BCE (68.2% probability); 
(3) (Palaikastro Tsunami Deposits) The result for this comes down to a possible date between 1657 and 1546 BCE (68.2% probability), in agreement with the data from the settlement of Akrotiri, the olive tree, and the sequence of Aegina Kolonna....: 
(4) Cypriot White Slip pottery ..... provides no convincing argument against an eruption date of~1600 BCE or shortly before."

===Relative chronology===
Archaeologists developed the Late Bronze Age chronologies of eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] cultures by analysing the origin of artifacts (for example, items from [[Crete]], mainland [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]] or [[Canaan]]) found in each archaeological layer.<ref name="Warren"/> If an artifact's origin can be accurately dated, it gives a reference date for the layer in which it is found. If the Thera eruption could be associated with a given layer of Cretan (or other) culture, chronologists could use the date of that layer to date the eruption itself. Since Thera's culture at the time of destruction was similar to the [[Minoan civilization|Late Minoan IA]] (LMIA) culture on Crete, LMIA is the baseline to establish chronology elsewhere. The eruption also aligns with [[Cycladic civilization|Late Cycladic I]] (LCI) and [[Late Helladic|Late Helladic I]] (LHI) cultures, but predates [[Peloponnesian]] LHI.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lolos |first=YG |year=1989 |url=http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/chronololy/onthelatehelladiciofakrotirithera |title=On the Late Helladic I of Akrotiri, Thera |publisher=The Thera Foundation |accessdate=2007-03-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313172340/http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/chronololy/onthelatehelladiciofakrotirithera |archive-date=2007-03-13 }}</ref> Archeological digs on Akrotiri have also yielded fragments of nine Syro-Palestinian [[Bronze Age|Middle Bronze II]] (MBII) [[gypsum]] vessels.<ref name="Warren">{{cite book|author=Warren PM|url=http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/chronololy/summaryofevidencefortheabsolutechronologyoftheearlypartoftheaegeanlatebronzeagederivedfromhistoricalegyptiansources|title=Summary of Evidence for the Absolute Chronology of the Early Part of the Aegean Late Bronze Age Derived from Historical Egyptian Sources in: Thera and the Aegean World III, Hardy, DA (ed)|year=1989|publisher=The Thera Foundation|pages=24–26|accessdate=2007-03-10|isbn=0-9506133-6-3|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321114002/http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/chronololy/summaryofevidencefortheabsolutechronologyoftheearlypartoftheaegeanlatebronzeagederivedfromhistoricalegyptiansources|archive-date=2007-03-21}}</ref>

The Aegean prehistorians felt so confident about their calculations that they rejected early [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] in the 1970s for LMI/LCI Thera, as radiocarbon suggested a date about a century earlier than the traditional dates.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Betancourt |first1=P.P. |year=1984 |title=Dating The Aegean Late Bronze Age with Radiocarbon |journal= Archaeometry |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=45–49 |url=http://www.informath.org/apprise/a4106/b300/c1987.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1987.tb00396.x}}</ref>

Pumice found at [[Avaris|Tell el Dab'a]] in Egypt that matches the composition of the Thera eruption has been dated to 1540 BCE, closer to the traditionally-accepted date of Thera's eruption.<ref name="Schofield">{{cite book |last1=Schofield |first1=Louise |year=2007 |title=The Mycenaeans |page=69}}</ref> This pumice has been contentious since the 1990s, as it represents the most prominent supported date to differ from the old chronology.

A 2010 study has used radiocarbon levels in bristlecone pines and Irish oak dated from 1700 BCE to 1500 BCE to develop a new calibration curve which is more accurate for this period.

===Climatic effects===
Hydrogeologist Philip LaMoreaux asserted in 1995 that the eruption caused significant climatic changes in the eastern [[Mediterranean]] region, [[Aegean Sea]] and much of the [[Northern Hemisphere]],<ref name="LaMoreaux">{{cite journal|author=LaMoreaux, PE|year=1995|title=Worldwide environmental impacts from the eruption of Thera|journal=Environmental Geology|volume=26|issue=3|pages=172–81|doi=10.1007/BF00768739|bibcode=1995EnGeo..26..172L|s2cid=129161967}}</ref> but that was forcefully rebutted by volcanologist David Pyle a year later.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pyle, DM|year=1997|title=The global impact of the Minoan eruption of Santorini, Greece|journal=Environmental Geology|volume=30|issue=1/2|pages=59–61|doi=10.1007/s002540050132|s2cid=129249697}}</ref>

Around the time of the radiocarbon-indicated date of the eruption, there is evidence for a significant climatic event in the Northern Hemisphere, including failure of crops in China (see below) and evidence from [[Dendrochronology|tree rings]], cited above: [[bristlecone pines]] of [[California]]; bog [[oak]]s of Ireland, England, and Germany; and other trees in Sweden.

The eruption devastated the nearby Minoan settlement at [[Akrotiri (prehistoric city)|Akrotiri]] on Santorini, which was entombed in a layer of [[pumice]].<ref name="Vergano">{{cite web |title=Ye gods!

Significant Minoan remains have been found above the Thera ash layer and tsunami level dating from the [[Minoan civilization|Late Minoan I]] era, and it is unclear whether the effects of the ash and tsunami were enough to trigger the downfall of the Minoan civilization. Some sites were abandoned or settlement systems significantly interrupted in the immediate aftermath of the eruption.<ref name="B. Molloy, F. McCoy 2014"/> As the Minoans were a sea power and depended on ships for their livelihood, the Thera eruption likely caused significant economic hardship to the Minoans. Whether the effects were enough to trigger the downfall of the civilization is intensely debated. The [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] conquest of the Minoans occurred in the [[Minoan civilization|Late Minoan II]] period (1450–1400 BC). The Mycenaeans were a military civilization. Using their functional navy and a well-equipped army, they were capable of an invasion. Mycenaean weaponry has been found in burials on Crete. This demonstrates Mycenaean military influence not many years after the eruption.<ref>Bruce Bowen: [http://bruceowen.com/worldprehist/3250s13.htm ''Mycenae and Minoan Crete''], 2000,</ref> Many archaeologists speculate that the eruption caused a crisis in Minoan civilization, making them vulnerable to conquest by the Mycenaeans.<ref name="Antonopoulos "/>

===Chinese records===
A [[volcanic winter]] from an eruption in the late 17th century BCE has been claimed by some researchers to correlate with entries in later Chinese records documenting the collapse of the semi-legendary [[Xia dynasty]] in [[China]]. According to the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'', the collapse of the dynasty and the rise of the [[Shang dynasty]], approximately dated to 1618 BCE, were accompanied by "yellow fog, a dim sun, then [[sun dogs|three suns]], frost in July, famine, and the withering of all [[five cereals]]".<ref name="Foster">{{cite journal|author=Foster, KP, Ritner, RK, and Foster, BR|year=1996|title=Texts, Storms, and the Thera Eruption|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=55|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1086/373781|s2cid=162024484}}</ref>

===Effect on Egyptian history===
Apocalyptic rainstorms, which devastated much of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and were described on the [[Tempest Stele]] of [[Ahmose I]], have been attributed to short-term climatic changes caused by the Theran eruption.<ref name="Foster"/><ref name="Davis">{{cite web|first1=Davis|last1=EN|title=A Storm in Egypt during the Reign of Ahmose|work=Thera and the Aegean World III|publisher=Thera Foundation|year=1990|url=http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/chronololy/astorminegyptduringthereignofahmose|accessdate=2007-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314174726/http://www.therafoundation.org/articles/chronololy/astorminegyptduringthereignofahmose|archive-date=14 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Goedicke|first=Hans|title=Studies about Kamose and Ahmose|publisher=David Brown Book Company|year=1995|location=Baltimore|isbn= 0-9613805-8-6|chapter=Chapter 3}}</ref> The difficulty with this interpretation is that in the conventional but disputed Egyptian chronology, Ahmose I ruled from c. 1539–1514 BCE, whilst the eruption is thought to have occurred somewhere between 1642–1540 BCE.

Alternatively, if the eruption occurred in the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], the absence of Egyptian records of the eruption could be caused by the general disorder in Egypt around that time.

While it has been argued that the damage attributed to these storms may have been caused by an earthquake following the Thera eruption, it has also been suggested that it was caused during a war with the [[Hyksos]], and the storm reference is merely a metaphor for chaos upon which the Pharaoh was attempting to impose order.<ref name="Wiener">{{cite journal| last1=Wiener|first1=MH|author2=Allen, JP|title=Separate Lives: The Ahmose Tempest Stela and the Theran Eruption|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=57|pages=1–28|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1998|doi=10.1086/468596|s2cid=162153296}}</ref> Documents such as [[Hatshepsut]]'s [[Speos Artemidos]] depict storms, but are clearly figurative, not literal. Research indicates that the Speos Artemidos stele is a reference to her overcoming the powers of chaos and darkness.<ref name="Wiener"/>

===Greek traditions===

====The Titanomachy====
The eruption of Thera and volcanic fallout may have inspired the myths of the [[Titanomachy]] in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]''.<ref name="Greene">{{cite book|author=Greene, MT|year=2000|title=Natural Knowledge in Preclassical Antiquity|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6371-4}}{{Page needed|date=December 2019}}</ref> The Titanomachy could have picked up elements of western [[Anatolia]]n folk memory, as the tale spread westward. [[Hesiod]]'s lines have been compared with volcanic activity, citing [[Zeus]]'s thunderbolts as [[volcanic lightning]], the boiling earth and sea as a breach of the [[magma chamber]], immense flame and heat as evidence of [[phreatic explosion]]s, among many other descriptions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luce|first=John Victor|title=The end of Atlantis: New light on an old legend (New Aspects of Antiquity) |publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=1969|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-39005-4}}{{Page needed|date=December 2019}}</ref>

====Atlantis====

Geologist Barbara J. Sivertsen seeks to establish a link between the eruption of Santorini (c. 1600 BCE) and the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] of the [[Israelites]] from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in the [[Bible]].<ref name="Sivertsen" />

====Other settlements====

The occupation (1742–1640 BCE) of the Minoan (?) palace at [[Tel Kabri]] in the Galilee ended around 1640 BCE.<ref>Cline, E. H., Yasur-Landau, A., Koh, A., (2013). "Absolute Chronology of the Middle Bronze Age Palace at Tel Kabri:Implications for Aegean-style Paintings in the Eastern Mediterranean". ''Journal of Ancient Egyptian Interconnections''.</ref>

===Bicameralism===
In the controversial [[bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]] hypothesis, [[Julian Jaynes]] has argued that the Minoan eruption was a crucial event in the development of human [[consciousness]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Jaynes|first=Julian|title=The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind|year=1976|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co.|location=Boston, MA|pages=479|isbn=0547527543|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3eQd-x-cxPwC}}</ref> since the displacements that it caused led to new and important interactions among communities.
