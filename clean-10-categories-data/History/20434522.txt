Charges of ahistoricism are frequently critical, implying that the subject is historically inaccurate or ignorant (for example, an ''ahistorical'' attitude).  It can also describe a person's failure to frame an argument or issue in a historical context or to disregard historical fact or implication.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pepper|first=David|title=Eco-socialism: From Deep Ecology to Social Justice|url=https://archive.org/details/ecosocialismfrom00pepp|url-access=limited|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ecosocialismfrom00pepp/page/n157 143]–144|isbn=978-0-415-09719-2}}</ref> An example of that would be films including [[dinosaur]]s and prehistoric human beings living side by side, but they were, in reality, millions of years apart.

The term can also describe a view that history has no relevance or importance in the decision making of modern life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.defineonline.com/Definition.aspx?Word=ahistoricism |title=ahistoricism |publisher=Define Online |accessdate=2008-11-27 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

In philosophy, some criticism has arisen because "the dominant school of philosophy in the English speaking world, [[analytic philosophy]]... has been trenchantly ahistorical, and indeed anti-historical". However, few view that to be a problem.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Akehursta|first=Thomas|title=Writing history for the ahistorical: Analytic philosophy and its past|journal=History of European Ideas|volume=35|pages=116–121|year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.histeuroideas.2008.09.002}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Who is Thomas Akehursta (the author in the citation) and why is his opinion on this subject relevant?|date=February 2016}}

A more abstract definition of ahistoricism is simply independence from time: removed from history.
An example is the idea that some concepts are not governed by what is learned or has happened, but they come from an ahistoric power that is independent of what has gone before.
