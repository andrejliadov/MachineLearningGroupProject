==Political reactions==
'''{{EST}}'''&nbsp;— President [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] appealed for calm and denounced the rioters as criminals due to the damage they had caused:
<blockquote>"All this had nothing to do with the inviolability of graves or keeping alive the memory of men fallen in World War II"...  "The common denominator of last night's criminals was not their nationality, but their desire to riot, vandalize and plunder".<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/27/AR2007042700165.html?hpid=sec-world Estonia Removes Soviet War Memorial] by Jari Tanner, in the Washington Post, April 27, 2007.

'''{{RUS}}''' – Belittling the World War II heroes' feats and desecrating monuments erected in their memory leads to discord and mistrust between countries and peoples, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said on Victory Day. "Those who try to belittle that priceless experience and desecrate monuments to war heroes today insult their own nations as well and sow discord and new mistrust between countries and peoples", Putin said at a parade on Red Square marking the 62nd anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.<ref>[http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11730593 Putin criticizes attempts to belittle WWII heroes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513141843/http://www.interfax.ru/e/B/politics/28.html?id_issue=11730593 |date=May 13, 2007 }} [[Interfax]] May 9, 2007</ref>

'''[[Council of Europe]]:'''
On April 27, the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) René van der Linden expressed his regrets on the decision of the Estonian authorities to remove the Bronze Soldier memorial as this act is widening the rift between the country's citizens of Estonian and Russian origin. "I understand that the monument is controversial as it symbolises, although in different ways, painful moments of Estonia and Russia's past. Precisely because of this, the soldiers that this memorial commemorates should have been left to rest in peace rather than being used as a political tool." The President expressed his disappointment that Estonia had not heeded the appeals for a common understanding over the issue of the Bronze Soldier that he made earlier this year to the Estonian and Russian delegations to PACE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Press/StopPressView.asp?ID%3D1900 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606221943/http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Press/StopPressView.asp?ID=1900 |archivedate=2011-06-06 }} Press release - 268(2007)</ref>

'''[[Council of Europe]]:'''
On May 5, the Council of Europe Secretary General Terry Davis called on all sides involved to use the occasion of the 62nd anniversary of the victory against the Nazis to bring an end to the dispute about the moving of the Monument to fallen Soviet soldiers in Tallinn. Davis expressed his understanding for the reasons why the Estonian authorities have decided to move the remains of these soldiers, but also reservations about the way it has been done. He called on politicians and public in Estonia to draw conclusions from these events and accept that on such delicate and potentially divisive matters, even the best intentioned initiatives may backfire if they are not prepared, discussed and implemented with appropriate sensitivity. Davis called on the Russian authorities to be more respectful and less emotional in the way they express their opinions on such a sensitive issue. In conclusion, he welcomed the decision to commemorate the Monument at its new location on the occasion of the ceremonies marking the end of World War II. He underlined that this choice of date places the symbol of the Bronze Soldier in its proper context – the liberation of Europe and provides an ideal opportunity to end this dispute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/secretarygeneral/sg/oped/04052007-bronzesoldier_en.asp? |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904170057/http://www.coe.int/t/secretarygeneral/sg/oped/04052007-Bronzesoldier_en.asp |archivedate=2007-09-04 }} Press release - 289(2007)</ref>

'''{{RUS}}''' – First Deputy Prime Minister [[Sergei Ivanov]] said that adequate measures, primarily, economic ones, should be taken against Estonia:
<blockquote>"In particular, Russia must speed up the construction of modern ports on Russian territory on the Baltic Sea, in the towns of [[Ust-Luga]], [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Primorsk]] and [[Vysotsk]].

'''{{SRB}}''' – On May 3, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Serbia issued a statement:

<blockquote>"The future of Europe is also based on full commitment to shared and best pages of European history, whereas the victory over Nazism and fascism more than half a century ago undoubtedly ranks among those pages deserving lasting admiration among all in Europe and in the world."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Condemning the unilateral action by Estonian authorities on the eve of 9 May as contrary to this commitment, it states: "The highest respect for such monuments in today's Germany is noteworthy.

'''{{EU}}''' –  On May 9 (Europe Day), the Estonia-Russia relations were discussed at the [[European Parliament]].
Several members of the Parliament expressed their support for Estonia. E.g. [[Brian Crowley]] said

<blockquote>I would like to join my colleagues in firstly giving our solidarity and support to the Estonian Government and to the Estonian people and, secondly, in denouncing the bully-boy tactics of the Russian Government in what they have attempted to create - the uncertainty and instability, not only within Estonia but in all the Baltic States.

In many ways what we are witnessing is a new form of totalitarianism or authoritarianism by utilisation of mobs in Moscow to attack an Embassy, by utilising the power or strength of energy to try to make people kneel to the influence of the Russian Government and, most importantly of all, by a continuing desire to keep imposing symbols of domination and of subjugation in areas that have gained their independence from totalitarian regimes.  Finally, may I say, a most ardent call should go out to the citizens of Estonia to show them that now that they are part of the European Union, they will not be abandoned as they were abandoned previously.

The riots in Tallinn and other Estonian cities have served to highlight remaining problems relating to the integration of the country's Russian-speaking minority, which constitutes about one third of the 1.4 million residents. Despite a number of important legislative reforms since the first years of independence, this minority is still not officially recognized as a [[linguistic minority]] and continues to face discrimination and exclusion in everyday life, thus fostering frustration and resentment among its members.

The secretary of the [[Estonian Anti-Fascist Committee]] and at the same time the chairman of the [[Constitution Party (Estonia)|Constitution Party]] [[Andrei Zarenkov]] claimed that as detention centers are overcrowded many of the detainees were taken to a cargo terminal in Tallinn seaport. "People were forced to [[Squatting position|squat]] for hours or lie on the concrete floor with their hands tied behind their backs. The police used plastic handcuffs which caused great pain", he said. "The security men selectively beat the detainees including women and teenagers. We have an account that they beat a 12-year-old girl lying on the floor for attempting to stand up. We have pictures of a toilet which is stained with the blood of the injured detainees", Zarenkov said.

In the days following the relocation, the [[Embassy of Estonia in Moscow]] was besieged by protesters, including pro-Kremlin youth organisations ''[[Nashi (Ours)|Nashi]]'' and the ''[[Young Guard of United Russia]]''.

On Monday, April 30, Estonia's foreign minister Urmas Paet reported that "the situation had become much worse in the previous<!--was: last--> night.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/257966.php|title=Paet: ööga muutus olukord saatkonna juures hullemaks - Eesti uudised - Postimees.ee|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120910164444/http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/257966.php|archivedate=2012-09-10}}</ref> The building is by now completely blocked."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/258003.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915213205/http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/258003.php |archivedate=2007-09-15 |language=et}}</ref> Paet says that Estonia's foreign ministry had sent a [[Note verbale|note]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/258005.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502032938/http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/siseuudised/258005.php |archivedate=2007-05-02 |language=et}}, also reported by Russian media: {{cite web |url=http://rian.ru/world/relations/20070430/64681928.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009214052/http://www.rian.ru/world/relations/20070430/64681928.html |archivedate=2007-10-09 |language=ru}}</ref> to Russia's foreign ministry, due to Russia's apparent unwillingness and impotency to defend the embassy building and its staff (which violates [[diplomatic immunity|Diplomatic law]], especially the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]]). Estonia's foreign ministry claims that the life and health of the diplomats and their family members residing in Moscow have been directly threatened.<ref>http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/384003 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235937/http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/384003 |date=2007-09-26 }} {{in lang|et}}</ref>

Estonia's president [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] expressed his astonishment that Russia has – despite the promises of foreign minister Lavrov – not taken actions to protect the diplomatic personnel. In Ilves' opinion, the ostensible powerlessness of Russia's defense services (e.g. [[OMON]]) is especially surprising, given their quick work when dispersing meetings of Russian opposition forces.<ref>As images show, the protesters have entered into embassy territory.

On the same day,<!--2007-04-30--> members of the crowd protesting before the embassy declared that if Estonian authorities would not set a date for the restoration of the Bronze Soldier statue in its former prominent place, they would begin demolishing the Estonian embassy building on May 1 (traditionally also Labour Day, important in Russia and the former [[Soviet Union]]). The building itself was covered with graffiti and stones were thrown at it.

During the night, protesters, both from pro-[[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] and [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist]] parties, were playing and singing aloud famous [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Eastern Front (World War II)|war marches]] of the [[Red Army]].<ref name=autogenerated3 /> They called the Estonians [[Fascist]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

On May 3, the ambassador Kaljurand left Moscow on a two-week vacation.
The protesters ended their blockade the same day. There has been speculation that the vacation
was suggested by
Germany's Foreign Minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] (by means of behind-the-scenes [[realpolitik]])
to soothe Russian-Estonian tensions.

===Threatened and alleged sanctions===
On May 3, 2007, Russia suddenly announced plans for repairs to railway lines to Estonia, disrupting oil and coal exports to Estonia. As a result, oil companies scurried to secure alternative export routes. Normally Estonia's ports handle about a quarter of such shipments from Russia to world markets. Although Russia denied it was imposing economic sanctions or taking politically inspired action against Estonia, it is suspected that the sudden railway repair plan is connected to the row over the war memorial.<ref>S.

The police are treating the riots as disorderly conduct (a [[misdemeanor]] under Estonian law) or severe disorderly conduct committed in a group (a [[felony]] under Estonian law), depending on the circumstances of any particular incident, and are proceeding accordingly.  About 1,000 suspected rioters were arrested.  Acts of vandalism and looting are treated separately, and processed as criminal incidents separate from the rioting.

Since the riots took place in the centre of the city, after hours of tension, many thousands of frames of photographic and video material of the events are available, both from journalists and security cameras and from witnesses among general public (who usually used cellphone cameras).  The police have gathered a number of such photographs depicting unidentified suspects on a website at [https://web.archive.org/web/20071014002826/http://tuvasta.politsei.ee/ Identification of Persons] (not available from outside Estonia while a foreign [[DDoS]] attack on Estonian government servers is underway<ref>Government Communication Office Briefing Room: [http://www.valitsus.ee/brf/index.php?id=282992&tpl=1007&external=&search=&aasta= Malicious cyber attacks against Estonia come from abroad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025711/http://www.valitsus.ee/brf/index.php?id=282992&tpl=1007&external=&search=&aasta= |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>F-Secure Web log: [http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/#00001181 Large attacks against websites run by the Estonian government]</ref>) and asked the public to identify such unidentified people.

On June 27, 2007, the media reported of the first batch of [[trial]]s involving the prosecutors requesting non-suspended sentences.<ref>Postimees June 27, 2007: [https://archive.today/20130821023732/http://postimees.ee/270607/esileht/krimi/267676.php Massirahutuste telekangelasi ähvardab reaalne vangistus] {{in lang|et}}</ref>  Jevgeni Kazakov, 21, who was infamously pictured as the gleeful looter clutching a half-liter bottle of Sprite, a pack of Orbit chewing gum and two packs of Libresse female sanitary pads, was convicted through the ''negotiation procedure'' (comparable to [[plea bargain]] of [[common law]] legal systems) on June 27, 2007 and sentenced to one year in prison, with two months to be served immediately and the rest suspended for 18 months.<ref>Postimees June 28, 2007: [http://postimees.ee/280607/esileht/krimi/268931.php Kohus saatis pronksööl rüüstamas käinud koka vangi]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{in lang|et}}</ref>

On June 26, 2007, the media reported that Artur Kivik, 19, was sentenced to 2 month "shock incarceration". Sven Anniko, 18, was sentenced to one year in prison suspended for 3 years.

A vandal, Sergei Dolgov, who has no Estonian citizenship but had been convicted before, was convicted in the felony of ''violation of public order during rioting'', over throwing rocks at policemen and vandalising lawn in front of [[Estonian National Library]].  He was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, suspended for 18 months.<ref>[[Postimees]] 27 August 2007: [http://www.postimees.ee/270807/esileht/krimi/279167.php Pronksööl politseinikele vastu hakanud mees sai tingimisi karistuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830045605/http://www.postimees.ee/270807/esileht/krimi/279167.php |date=2007-08-30 }}</ref>

As of August 2007, the harshest sentence has been that of [[Vjatšeslav Zjunin]], who was sentenced to a year of real imprisonment for looting and had an outstanding suspended sentence from an earlier conviction.

===Activists' Trial===

Four [[Nochnoy Dozor (advocacy group)|Nochnoy Dozor]] activists have gone on trial in Estonia in January 2008, charged with fomenting unrest during the removal of a [[Bronze Soldier]] war memorial. [[Dmitri Linter]], [[Maksim Reva]], [[Mark Sirők]] and [[Dmitri Klenski]] could face up to five years in prison.<ref name=BBCTrial>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7187437.stm|title=Estonia trial of Russia activists|date=14 January 2008|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

On 5 January 2009 the 4 activists, charged with organization of riots during Bronze Night, were found not guilty by the District Court of Harjumaa.  The prosecutor has appealed the ruling, citing numerous legal deficiencies. The acquittal, however, was upheld.<ref>V. Pettai M. Molder [https://www.webcitation.org/5vj55wWCv?url=http://www.freedomhouse.hu/images/Reports/NIT-2010-Estonia-final-final.pdf Estonia p. 207]// Nations in Transit. [[Freedom House]] 2010</ref>

===Statistics===

In relation to the rioting, 1200 people were arrested and 491 declared suspects of particular crimes.  As of 11 January 2009, 125 people have been convicted.  For 283 suspects, the criminal cases were ended without charges.

On most of the trials, the charges pressed were plundering during riots, vandalism during riots, arson during riots and disobedience of lawful police orders.  125 people so charged were convicted, one acquitted, and 10 are pending (including Linter, Reva, Sirők and Klenski).

Most of the damages caused by rioting were compensated by the government's reserve fund.  While the Ministry of Treasury undertook gathering and combining the debts so as to collect on them from the convicts, collection on many of them is unlikely due to the different focus of the investigations.  In particular, the Ministry of Treasury has paid out 25.6 million crowns of compensation; so far, 66 convicts have been billed for a total of 2.1 million crowns of damages.  As of mid-December 2008, less than 85 000 crowns of damages had been paid by the guilty.<ref>[[ERR Uudised]] 11 January 2009 21:43: [http://uudised.err.ee/index.php?06150684 Pronksiöö mässuga seoses on süüdi mõistetud 125 inimest]</ref>
