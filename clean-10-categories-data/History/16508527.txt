{{short description|One's unique set of traceable digital activities}}
'''Digital footprint''' or '''digital shadow''' refers to one's unique set of traceable digital activities, actions, contributions and communications manifested on the [[Internet]] or on digital devices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dictionary.com: digital footprint|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/digital-footprint|access-date=13 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is Digital Footprint?

The former is composed of a user's web-browsing activity and information stored as [[HTTP cookie|cookie]]s, while the latter is often released deliberately by a user with the intent of sharing information on websites or social media.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|last=Madden, Fox, Smith & Vitak|first=Mary, Susannah, Aaron, Jessica|date=2007|title=Digital Footprints|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2007/12/16/digital-footprints/|website=Pew Research Center}}</ref> While the term usually applies to an individual person, digital footprint can also refer to a business, organization or corporation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-07/01/digital-shadows-alastair-paterson|title=Monitoring digital footprints to prevent reputation damage and cyber attacks|last=COLLINS|first=KATIE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812132756/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-07/01/digital-shadows-alastair-paterson|archive-date=12 August 2013|url-status=dead|access-date=8 August 2013}}</ref>

The use of a digital footprint has both positive and negative consequences. On one hand, it is the subject of many privacy issues.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Owning Your Privacy by Managing Your Digital Footprint|url=https://staysafeonline.org/blog/owning-your-privacy-by-managing-your-digital-footprint/|access-date=2020-11-08|website=Stay Safe Online}}</ref> For example, without an individual’s authorization, strangers are able to piece together information about that individual by simply using [[Search engine|search engines]], and corporations are also able to produce customized ads based on browsing history. On the other hand, others can reap the benefits by profiting off their digital footprint as social media influencers. Furthermore, employers use a candidate’s digital footprint for [[online vetting]] and assessing fit due to its reduced cost and accessibility—between two equal candidates, a candidate with a positive digital footprint may have an advantage. As technology usage becomes more widespread, even children are generating larger digital footprints with potential positive and negative consequences such as college admissions. Since it is hard to not have a digital footprint, it is in one’s best interest to create a positive one.  

== Types of digital footprints ==
'''Passive''' digital footprints can be stored in many ways depending on the situation. In an online environment, a footprint may be stored in an online data base as a "hit". This footprint may track the user [[IP address]], when it was created, and where they came from; with the footprint later being analyzed. In an [[offline]] environment, a footprint may be stored in files, which can be accessed by [[System administrator|administrators]] to view the actions performed on the machine, without seeing who performed them.

'''Active''' digital footprints can also be stored in many ways depending on the situation. In an online environment, a footprint can be stored by a user being logged into a site when making a post or change, with the registered name being connected to the edit. In an offline environment a footprint may be stored in files, when the owner of the computer uses a [[keylogger]], so logs can show the actions performed on the machine, and who performed them. One feature of [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]] monitors the clipboard for any changes. This may be problematic as the user may copy passwords or take screenshots of sensitive information which is then logged.

== Privacy issues ==
Digital footprints are not a [[digital identity]] or [[passport]], but the content and [[meta data]] collected impacts [[internet privacy]], [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[security]], digital [[reputation]], and [[recommender system|recommendation]].  As the digital world expands and integrates with more aspects of life, ownership and rights with regard to data become important.  Digital footprints are controversial in that privacy and openness are in competition.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/4339771/Threat-to-privacy-under-data-law-campaigners-warn.html | title=Threat to privacy under data law, campaigners warn | work=Telegraph | date=26 January 2009 | access-date=22 March 2014 | location=London | first=Duncan | last=Gardham}}</ref> [[Scott McNealy]], CEO of [[Sun Microsystems]], said in 1999 ''Get Over It'' when referring to privacy on the Internet.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://archive.wired.com/politics/law/news/1999/01/17538 | title=Sun on Privacy: 'Get Over It' | work=Wired | date=26 January 1999 | access-date=22 March 2014 | author=Sprenger, Polly}}</ref> This later became a commonly used quote in relation to private data and what companies do with it.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2016-01-10|title=Digital Footprint: Part 2 {{!}} Hueya: Securing Your Digital World|url=https://www.hueya.io/digital-footprint-part-2/|access-date=2020-10-10|website=Hueya - Online Privacy Software|language=en-US}}</ref> Digital footprints are a privacy concern because they are a set of traceable actions, contributions, and ideas shared by users.

Internet footprints are used by interested parties for several reasons; including ''cyber-vetting'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.wayne.edu/informationpolicy/2012/12/07/cybervetting-the-hiring-process-in-the-digital-age-2/|title=Cybervetting: The Hiring Process in the Digital Age|last=Dalgord|first=Chelsea|date=2012-12-07|access-date=2013-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223140/http://blogs.wayne.edu/informationpolicy/2012/12/07/cybervetting-the-hiring-process-in-the-digital-age-2/|archive-date=2013-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref> where interviewers could research applicants based on their online activities.

''Social networking systems'' may record activities of individuals, with data becoming a ''[[Lifestreaming|life stream]]''.  Such usage of [[social media]] and roaming services allow digital tracing data to include individual interests, social groups, behaviors, and location. Such data is gathered from sensors within devices, and collected and analyzed without user awareness.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What a digital footprint? - Knowledgebase - ICTEA|url=https://www.ictea.com/cs/knowledgebase.php?action=displayarticle&id=2235&language=english|access-date=2020-10-10|website=www.ictea.com}}</ref> When many users choose to share personal information about themselves through social media platform, including places they visited, timelines and their connections, they are unaware of the privacy setting choices as well as the security consequences associated with them.<ref name=":0">Ball, Albert; Ranim, Michelle; Levy, Yair (January 1, 2015).

== Effects on workforce ==
As technology becomes ubiquitous, an increasing number of employers are also evaluating applicants by their digital footprint through their interaction on social media due to its reduced cost and easy accessibility<ref>Broughton, A., Foley, B., Ledermaier, S., & Cox, A.

Job seekers thus prefer to create a social media presence that would be viewed positively from a professional point of view.

In some professions, maintaining a digital footprint is important. In the age of technology, people will search the internet for specific doctors and their reviews. In fact, half of the search results for a specific physician link to third-party rating websites.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Christopher|last2=Gupta|first2=Raghav|last3=Shah|first3=Aakash|last4=Madill|first4=Evan|last5=Prabhu|first5=Arpan V.|last6=Agarwal|first6=Nitin|date=May 2018|title=Digital Footprint of Neurological Surgeons|journal=World Neurosurgery|volume=113|pages=e172–e178|doi=10.1016/j.wneu.2018.01.210|pmid=29427816}}</ref> This means that prospective patients may unknowingly choose their physicians based on their digital footprint in addition to online reviews. Furthermore, a generation relies on social media for livelihood as [[Internet celebrity|influencers]] by using their digital footprint. These influencers have dedicated fan bases that may be eager to follow recommendations. As a result, marketers pay influencers to promote their products among their followers, since this medium may yield better returns than traditional advertising.<ref>{{Citation|last=Gretzel|first=Ulrike|title=Influencer marketing in travel and tourism|date=2017-07-20|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315565736-13|work=Advances in Social Media for Travel, Tourism and Hospitality|pages=147–156|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-315-56573-6|access-date=2020-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Twenge|first=Jean M.|last2=Martin|first2=Gabrielle N.|last3=Spitzberg|first3=Brian H.|date=2019-10-01|title=Trends in U.S. Adolescents’ media use, 1976–2016: The rise of digital media, the decline of TV, and the (near) demise of print.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/ppm0000203|journal=Psychology of Popular Media Culture|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=329–345|doi=10.1037/ppm0000203|issn=2160-4142}}</ref> Consequently, one’s career may be reliant on their digital footprint.

== Effect on Children ==
[[File:Automotive_Social_Media_Marketing.jpg|thumb|Children's digital footprint may traverse the internet beyond the intended audiences]]
[[Generation Alpha]] will be the first generation that won’t exist without the technology era. As such, children’s digital footprint is becoming bigger than ever before and their consequences may be unclear. Due to parenting enthusiasm, an increasing amount of parents will create social media accounts for their children at a young age, sometimes even before they are born.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2010-10-06|title=Digital Birth: Welcome to the Online World|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20101006006722/en/Digital-Birth-Welcome-to-the-Online-World|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en}}</ref> In their celebratory state, parents may post up to 13,000 photos of a child on social media before their teen years<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=2018-11-08|title=Children’s Commissioner’s report calls on internet giants and toy manufacturers to be transparent about collection of children’s data|url=https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/2018/11/08/childrens-commissioners-report-calls-on-internet-giants-and-toy-manufacturers-to-be-transparent-about-collection-of-childrens-data/|access-date=2020-11-03|website=Children's Commissioner for England|language=en-GB}}</ref> of everyday life or birthday celebrations. Furthermore, these children are predicted to post 70,000 times online on their own by the age of 18.<ref name=":1" /> The advent of posting on social media creates many opportunities to gather data from minors. Since the basic components of an identity contain name, birthdate, and address, these children are susceptible to [[identity theft]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Internet safety for children {{!}} Keeping kids safe online {{!}} Barclays|url=https://www.barclays.co.uk/moments/helping-younger-generations/Internet-safety-for-children/|access-date=2020-11-03|website=www.barclays.co.uk|language=en}}</ref> While parents may assume that privacy settings may prevent children’s photos and data from being exposed, they also have to trust that their followers will not be compromised as well. Outsiders may take the images to pose as these children’s parents or post the content publicly.<ref>Steinberg, S. B. (2016). Sharenting: Children's privacy in the age of social media.

Due presence of children on social media, their privacy may be at risk.

== Effects on teens ==
Not only do those entering the workforce need to consider the effect of their digital footprint, but also those who provides relevant information to teens.<ref name=":3" /> Having a digital footprint may be dangerous for students, as affiliations such as college admissions staff and potential employers may decide to research into prospective students and employee's online profiles, leading to a large impact on the students' futures.<ref name=":3">{{cite web |title=10 Things Your Students Should Know About Their Digital Footprints |url=http://www.teachhub.com/10-things-your-students-should-know-about-their-digital-footprints |website=TeachHUB }}</ref> Teens will be set up for more success if they consider the kind of impact they are making along with how it can affect their future.

== Build a positive digital footprint ==
The negative impact of a digital footprint could be daunting and make one flee from social media in attempt to not have a digital footprint at all, yet this can be beneficial if thought about carefully and not carelessly. Experts advise people '''not''' to delete their accounts in an attempt to go off the map;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2377-social-media-hiring.html|title=Social Media Screenings Increase for Job Seekers|website=www.businessnewsdaily.com|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> instead, experts advise doing the following actions in order to create an appealing digital footprint:

# '''Research yourself:''' By doing this one can see what type of information follows them and is a part of their digital footprint.<ref name="Purdue Global 3 Tips">{{cite web|title=3 Tips to Protect Your Online Reputation|url=https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/student-life/3-tips-protect-online-reputation-digital-footprint/|website=Purdue Global}}</ref><ref name=Bates2018/>
# '''Think before posting:''' This will allow for time to consider whether or not this is something that should be a part of one's digital footprint. Sources say that those who do not consider all possible implications of what they post on the internet may be negatively affected when looking for employment.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Osborne |first1=Nicola |last2=Connelly |first2=Louise |title=Managing your digital footprint: possible implications for teaching and learning |url={{Google books|VDU7CgAAQBAJ|page=354|plainurl=yes}} |pages=354–361 |editor1-last=Peres |editor1-first=Paula |editor2-last=Mesquita |editor2-first=Anabela |conference=Proceedings of the 2nd European Conference on Social Media 2015 |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-910810-31-6 }}</ref>
# '''Highlight attractive traits and qualities''': Using the Internet and social media outlets to highlight one's greatest attributes and qualities will allow the person to be seen in a positive light. Since it is already known that digital footprints are evaluated by potential job employers and universities in the application process then applicants should use that to their benefit and to make them look attractive.<ref name="Van Ouytsel et al 2014"/>
