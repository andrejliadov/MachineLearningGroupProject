===History===
[[Samuel F. Morrison]], while director of the Broward County Libraries Division, was inspired to build an ethnically-focused library after a visit to the [[Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History]].<ref name="story">{{cite web|title=Story of AARLCC|url=https://www.broward.org/LIBRARY/AARLCCSPECIALCOLLECTIONS/Pages/AArlccStory.aspx|publisher=Broward County Library|access-date=2019-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623114144/http://www.broward.org/Library/AARLCCSpecialCollections/Pages/AArlccStory.aspx|archive-date=2018-06-23|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref> At that time, the Auburn Avenue Research Library and the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]] in New York City were the only two research libraries in African-American culture in the nation. Morrison, however, was determined to "build a library in the African-American area, with county funds."<ref name="AARLCC">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=H. M.|title=The African-American Research Library and Cultural Center of the Broward County Library: Building Bridges and Beyond|journal=Reference & User Services Quarterly|date=2002|volume=42|issue=1|pages=21–25}}</ref>

===Funding===
Between 1990 and 1995, Morrison engaged in numerous conversations and negotiations with county officials on the construction of the library.<ref name="AARLCC"/> Funds had already been saved to replace the smaller [[Von Delany Mizell|Von D. Mizell]] Branch Library in Fort Lauderdale. The Broward County Commission had provided the land and $5 million towards the new library. Morrison, however, had plans for a much larger library and research facility and needed and additional $7 million to complete his vision.<ref name="story"/>

The remaining funds were received largely through fundraising. A $600,000 grant was issued by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and was matched by other organizations and philanthropists, such as the ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'', [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Entertainment Group]], and Dianne and Michael [[Bienes Museum of the Modern Book|Bienes]]. $50,000 was donated by The Links and $250,000 donated by [[Publix Super Markets, Inc.|Publix]] Charities. Businessman, [[Wayne Huizenga]] donated $1 million towards the library. Additional funds were raised from churches, clubs, and other interested organizations.<ref name="AARLCC"/>

===Construction===
The groundbreaking ceremony occurred on October 23, 1999. After additional fundraising, construction of the building began in April 2001.<ref name="story"/> PAWA Complex International – the largest African-American owned architectural company in Florida – created the architectural design of the facility. Cecil Hayes – the first African American listed in the [[Architectural Digest]] top 100 – created the building's interior design and the artistic designer was Gary Moore. According to Morrison, over 50 percent of the construction contracts were done by African-American corporations.<ref name="AARLCC"/> On October 26, 2002, construction of the AARLCC was complete and finally opened to the public.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Henrietta M.|title=The African-American Research Library and Cultural Center of the Broward County Library: Building Bridges and Beyond|journal=Reference and User Services Quarterly|date=Fall 2002|page=21}}</ref>
