'''African-American <!-- "African American" or "Black History" is a noun, "African-American" is an adjective -->history''' is the part of [[History of the United States|American history]] that looks at the history of [[African Americans]] or Black Americans.

Of the 10.7 million Africans who were brought to the Americas by white Europeans until the 1880s, 450 thousand were shipped to what is now the United States.<ref>{{cite web

==Enslavement==

===African origins===
The majority of African Americans are the descendants of Africans that were forced into slavery after being captured during African wars or raids. They were purchased and brought to America as part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Westbury|first=Susan|date=1985|title=Slaves of Colonial Virginia: Where They Came From|journal=The William and Mary Quarterly|volume=42|issue=2|pages=228–237|doi=10.2307/1920429|issn=0043-5597|jstor=1920429}}</ref> African Americans are descended from various ethnic groups, mostly from ethnic groups that lived in [[West Africa|Western]] and [[Central Africa]], including the [[Sahel]]. A smaller number of African Americans are descended from ethnic groups that lived in [[East Africa|Eastern]] and [[Southeast Africa|Southeastern Africa]]. The major ethnic groups that the enslaved Africans belonged to included the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Bakongo]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Mandé]], [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Akan people|Akan]], [[Fon people|Fon]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], and [[Makua (people)|Makua]], among many others. Although these different groups varied in customs, religious theology and language, what they had in common was a way of life which was different from that of the Europeans.<ref name="Carson, Clayborne 2011">Carson, Clayborne, Emma Lapsansky-Werner, and Gary Nash.

==== Regions of Africa ====
Studies of contemporary documents reveal seven regions from which Africans were sold or taken during the Atlantic slave trade. These regions were:
* [[Senegambia]], encompassing the coast from the [[Senegal River]] to the [[Casamance River]], where captives as far away as the Upper and Middle [[Niger River]] Valley were sold;
* The [[Sierra Leone]] region included territory from the [[Casamance River|Casamance]] to the [[Assinie-Mafia|Assinie]] in the modern countries of [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Guinea]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]];
* The [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]] region consisted of mainly modern [[Ghana]];
* The [[Bight of Benin]] region stretched from the [[Volta River]] to the [[Benue River]] in modern [[Togo]], [[Benin]] and southwestern [[Nigeria]];
* The [[Bight of Biafra]] extended from southeastern [[Nigeria]] through [[Cameroon]] into [[Gabon]];
* West Central Africa, the largest region, included the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]] and [[Angola]]; and
* East and Southeast Africa, the region of Mozambique-Madagascar included the modern countries of [[Mozambique]], parts of [[Tanzania]] and [[Madagascar]].<ref>Gomez, Zahkeem A: ''Exchanging Our Country Marks: The Transformation of African Identities in the Colonial and Antebellum South'', p. 27. Chapel Hill, 1998.</ref>

The largest source of slaves transported across the Atlantic Ocean for the New World was West Africa. Some West Africans were skilled iron workers and were therefore able to make tools that aided in their agricultural labor. While there were many unique tribes with their own customs and religions, by the 10th century many of the tribes had embraced Islam. Those villages in West Africa that were lucky enough to be in good conditions for growth and success, prospered. They also contributed their success to the slave trade.<ref name="Carson, Clayborne 2011"/>

===The Middle Passage===
{{Main|Middle Passage}}
Before the [[Atlantic slave trade]] there were already people of African descent in America. A few countries in Africa would buy, sell, and trade other enslaved Africans, who were often prisoners of war, with the Europeans. The people of [[Mali]] and [[Benin]] are known for partaking in the event of selling their prisoners of war and other unwanted people off as slaves.<ref name="Carson, Clayborne 2011" />

===Transport===
In the account of [[Olaudah Equiano]], he described the process of being transported to the colonies and being on the slave ships as a horrific experience. On the ships, the enslaved Africans were separated from their family long before they boarded the ships.<ref name="white">{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Deborah Gray|last2=Bay|first2=Mia|last3=Martin Jr.|first3=Waldo E.|title=Freedom on My Mind: A History of African Americans|date=2013|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martin's|location=Boston/ New York|isbn=9780312648831|page=27}}</ref> Once aboard the ships the captives were then segregated by gender.<ref name="white" /> Under the deck, the enslaved Africans were cramped and did not have enough space to walk around freely. Enslaved males were generally kept in the ship's hold, where they experienced the worst of crowding.<ref name="white" /> The captives stationed on the floor beneath low-lying bunks could barely move and spent much of the voyage pinned to the floorboards, which could, over time, wear the skin on their elbows down to the bone.<ref name="white" /> Due to the lack of basic hygiene, malnourishment, and dehydration diseases spread wildly and death was common.

The women on the ships often endured rape by the crewmen.<ref name="Carson, Clayborne 2011" /> Women and children were often kept in rooms set apart from the main hold. This gave crewmen easy access to the women which was often regarded as one of the perks of the trade system.<ref name="white" /> Not only did these rooms give the crewmen easy access to women but it gave enslaved women better access to information on the ship's crew, fortifications, and daily routine, but little opportunity to communicate this to the men confined in the ship's hold.<ref name="white" /> As an example, women instigated a 1797 insurrection aboard the [[slave ship]] ''Thomas'' by stealing weapons and passing them to the men below as well as engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the ship's crew.<ref name="white" />

In the midst of these terrible conditions, enslaved Africans plotted mutiny. Enslaved males were the most likely candidates to mutiny and only at times they were on deck.<ref name="white" /> While rebellions did not happen often, they were usually unsuccessful. In order for the crew members to keep the enslaved africans under control and prevent future rebellions, the crews were often twice as large and members would instill fear into the enslaved Africans through brutality and harsh punishments.<ref name="white" /> From the time of being captured in Africa to the arrival to the plantations of the European masters, took an average of six months.<ref name="Carson, Clayborne 2011" /> Africans were completely cut off from their families, home, and community life.<ref>Clayborne Carson, ed., ''The Struggle For Freedom'' (Prentice Hall, 2011), 38.</ref> They were forced to adjust to a new way of life.

==Early African-American history==
{{Main|Slavery in the United States}}

[[File:1670 virginia tobacco slaves.jpg|thumb|250px|''"Slaves working in 17th-century Virginia"'', by an unknown artist, 1670.]]

Africans assisted the Spanish and the Portuguese during their early exploration of the Americas. In the 16th century some black explorers settled in the Mississippi valley and in the areas that became South Carolina and New Mexico. The most celebrated black explorer of the Americas was Estéban, who traveled through the Southwest in the 1530s.
The uninterrupted history of blacks in the United States began in 1619, when [[First Africans in Virginia|"twenty and odd" Africans ]]were landed in the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]]. These individuals were not enslaved but indentured servants—persons bound to an employer for a limited number of years—as were many of the settlers of European descent (whites). By the 1660s large numbers of Africans were being brought to the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. In 1790 Black people numbered almost 760,000 and made up nearly one-fifth of the population of the United States.

In 1619, the [[First Africans in Virginia|first enslaved Africans were brought to Point Comfort]] on a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[slave ship]],<ref>https://aaregistry.org/story/african-slaves-arrive-at-point-comfort-hampton-va/</ref> today's Fort Monroe in [[Hampton, Virginia]], 30 miles downstream from [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. They were kidnapped by [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] slave traders.<ref>https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-african-slave-ship-arrives-jamestown-colony</ref> The Virginian settlers treated these captives as [[Indentured servitude|indentured servants]] and released them after a number of years. This practice was gradually replaced by the system of chattel slavery used in the [[Caribbean]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1narr2.html|title=New World Exploration and English Ambition |work=The Terrible Transformation |publisher=PBS |access-date=June 14, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070614105621/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1narr2.html| archive-date=June 14, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>  As servants were freed, they became competition for resources. Additionally, released servants had to be replaced.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1narr3.html |title=From Indentured Servitude to Racial Slavery |work=The Terrible Transformation |publisher=PBS |access-date=June 14, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070604113622/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1narr3.html| archive-date=June 4, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

This, combined with the still ambiguous nature of the social status of Black people and the difficulty in using any other group of people as forced servants, led to the relegation of Black people into slavery. [[Massachusetts]] was the first colony to legalize slavery in 1641. Other colonies followed suit by passing laws that passed slavery on to the children of slaves and making non-Christian imported servants slaves for life.<ref name="auto"/>

Africans first arrived in 1619, when a Dutch ship sold 19 blacks to Virginian settlers at [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] (today's [[Fort Monroe]]), thirty miles downstream from Jamestown, Virginia. In all, about 10–12 million Africans were transported to the Western Hemisphere. The vast majority of these people came from that stretch of the West African coast extending from present-day Senegal to Angola; a small percentage came from Madagascar and East Africa. Only 5% (about 500,000) went to the American colonies. The vast majority went to the West Indies and Brazil, where they died quickly. Demographic conditions were highly favorable in the American colonies, with less disease, more food, some medical care, and lighter work loads than prevailed in the sugar fields.<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Kolchin |title=American Slavery, 1619–1877 |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |year=2003 |isbn=978-0809016303 }}</ref>

At first the Africans in the South were outnumbered by white indentured servants, who came voluntarily from Europe. They avoided the plantations. With the vast amount of good land and the shortage of laborers,  plantation owners turned to lifetime enslavement of African peoples who worked for their keep but were not paid wages and could not easily escape. Enslaved Africans had some legal rights (it was a crime to kill an enslaved person, and a few whites were hanged for it.) Generally the enslaved Africans developed their own family system, religion and customs in the slave quarters with little interference from owners, who were only interested in work outputs. Before the 1660s, the North American mainland colonies were expanding, but still fairly small in size and did not have a great demand for labour, so the colonists did not import large numbers of enslaved Africans at this point.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

=== The Black population in the 1700s ===
By 1700 there were 25,000 enslaved Black people in the North American mainland colonies, about 10% of the population. Some enslaved Black people had been directly shipped from Africa (most of them were from 1518 to the 1850s), but initially, in the very early stages of the [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization of North America]], occasionally they had been shipped via the West Indies in small cargoes after spending time working on the islands.<ref name="books.google.co.uk">John Murrin, Paul Johnson, James McPherson, Alice Fahs, Gary Gerstle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CRwJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT151  "Expansion, Immigration, and Regional Differentiation"], in ''Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People, Volume 1: To 1877'', Cengage Learning, 2011, p. 108.</ref> At the same time, many were native born due to the fact that they were born on the North American mainland. Their legal status was now clear: they were enslaved for life and so were the children of enslaved mothers. As white colonizers began to claim and clear more land for large-scale farming and the building of plantations, the number of enslaved Africans who were directly imported from Africa began to rapidly increase from the 1660s to the 1700s and thereafter, since the trade in enslaved people who were coming in from the West Indies was much too small to meet the huge demand for the now fast-growing North American mainland slave market. Additionally, most North American buyers of enslaved people no longer wanted to purchase enslaved people who were coming in from the West Indies—by now they were either harder to obtain, too expensive, undesirable, or more often, they had been exhausted in many ways by the very brutal regime that existed on the island's sugar plantations. By the end of the seventeenth century, drastic changes in colonial tax laws, and [[the Crown]]'s removal of [[Monopoly|monopolies]] that had earlier been granted to a very small number of slave-trading companies such as the [[Royal Africa Company|Royal African Company]], had made the direct slave trade with Africa much easier for other slave traders. As a result, freshly imported young, strong, and healthy Africans were now much more affordable, cheaper in price, and more readily available in large numbers to the North American slave buyers, who by now had preferred to purchase them—even if they were distraught for a while and needed time to adjust to a new life enslaved at a plantation. From about 1700 to 1859, the majority of enslaved people who were imported to the North American mainland came directly from Africa in huge cargoes that were much-needed in order to fill the massive spike in demand for the heavy labour required to work the continually expanding plantations in the Southern colonies  (that later became part of the present-day United States), with most enslaved people heading to Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and French or Spanish Louisiana.<ref name="books.google.co.uk"/> Unlike the colonies in the South, the Northern colonies developed into much more urbanized and industrialized societies, and they relied less on agriculture as the main source of survival and growth for the economy, so therefore, they did not import many enslaved Africans, and the Black population which lived there remained fairly low for a very long time. However, big Northern cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, had relatively large Black populations (both enslaved and free) for most of the colonial period and thereafter.

From the 1750s, American-born enslaved people of African descent already began to outnumber African-born enslaved people. By the time of the American Revolution, a few of the Northern states had begun to consider abolishing slavery. Some Southern states, such as Virginia, had produced such large and self-sustaining locally-born enslaved Black populations by natural increase that they stopped taking in direct imports of enslaved Africans altogether. However, other Southern states, such as Georgia and South Carolina, still relied on constant, fresh supplies of the labour of enslaved people in order to keep up with the demand for it which accompanied their burgeoning plantation economies. These states continued to allow the direct importation of enslaved Africans until 1808, only stopping for a few years in the 1770s due to a temporary lull in the trade which was brought on by the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The continuing direct importation of enslaved Africans ensured that for most of the eighteenth century, South Carolina's Black population remained very high, with Black people outnumbering whites three to one. In contrast, Virginia maintained a white majority despite its significant Black enslaved population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/ethnography/aah/aaheritage/lowCountryA.htm|title=NPS Ethnography: African American Heritage & Ethnography|website=Nps.gov|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref> It was said that in the eighteenth century, the [[Province of South Carolina|colony South Carolina]] resembled an "extension of [[West Africa]]". All legal, direct importation of enslaved Africans had stopped by 1808, when the now, newly formed United States finally banned its citizens from participating in the international slave trade altogether by law. Despite the ban, small to moderate cargoes of enslaved Africans were occasionally and illegally shipped into the United States directly from Africa for many years, as late as 1859.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slave-ships.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/clotilde.html|title=Clotilde|website=Slave-ships.blogspot.co.uk|access-date= August 28, 2017|date=February 2, 2011}}</ref>

Slowly a free Black population emerged, concentrated in port cities along the Atlantic coast from Charleston to Boston. Enslaved people who lived in the cities and towns had more privileges than enslaved people who did not, but the great majority of enslaved people lived on southern tobacco or rice plantations, usually in groups of 20 or more.<ref>Ira Berlin, ''Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America'' (2000).</ref> Wealthy plantation owners eventually became so reliant on slavery that they devastated their own lower class.<ref>Egerton, Douglas R. "Slaves to the Marketplace: Economic Liberty and Black Rebelliousness in the Atlantic World." ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 26, no. 4 (Winter 2006): 617–639. America: History & Life, EBSCOhost (accessed October 24, 2012).</ref> In the years to come, the institution of slavery would be so heavily involved in the South's economy that it would divide America.

The most serious slave rebellion was the 1739 [[Stono Uprising]] in South Carolina. The colony had about 56,000 enslaved people, who outnumbered whites two to one. About 150 enslaved people rose up, seizing guns and ammunition to kill twenty whites before [[Fort Mose Historic State Park|heading for Spanish Florida]]. The local militia soon intercepted and killed most of the enslaved people involved in the uprising.<ref>Peter H. Wood, ''Black majority: Negroes in colonial South Carolina from 1670 through the Stono Rebellion'' (1975)</ref>

At this time, slavery existed in all American colonies. In the North, 2% of people owned enslaved people, most of whom were personal servants. In the south, 25% of the population relied on the labour of enslaved people. Southern slavery usually took the form of field hands who lived and worked on plantations.<ref>Michael Gomez, ''Exchanging Our Country Marks: The Transformation of African Identities in the Colonial and Antebellum South'' (1998)</ref> These statistics show the early imbalance that would eventually tip the scale and rid the United States of slavery.<ref>Michael Woods E.

==The Revolution and early America==
{{See also|American Revolution|History of the United States (1776–1789)|African Americans in the Revolutionary War}}
The later half of the 18th century was a time of political upheaval in the United States. In the midst of cries for independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] rule, people pointed out the apparent hypocrisies of slave holders' demanding freedom. The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], a document that would become a [[manifesto]] for human rights and personal freedom, was written by [[Thomas Jefferson]], who owned over 200 enslaved people. Other Southern statesmen were also major slaveholders. The [[Second Continental Congress]] did consider freeing enslaved people to assist with the war effort. They removed language from the Declaration of Independence that included the promotion of slavery amongst the offenses of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. A number of free Black people, most notably [[Prince Hall]]—the founder of [[Prince Hall Freemasonry]], submitted [[petitions]] for the end of slavery. But these petitions were largely ignored.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2narr3.html |title=Declarations of Independence, 1770–1783 |work=Revolution |publisher=PBS |access-date=June 14, 2007}}</ref>

This did not deter Black people, free and enslaved, from participating in the Revolution. [[Crispus Attucks]], a free Black tradesman, was the first casualty of the [[Boston Massacre]] and of the ensuing [[American Revolutionary War]]. 5,000 Black people, including Prince Hall, fought in the [[Continental Army]]. Many fought side by side with [[White people|White]] soldiers at the [[battles of Lexington and Concord]] and at [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]]. But when [[George Washington]] took command in 1775, he barred any further recruitment of Black people.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

Approximately 5000 free African-American men helped the American Colonists in their struggle for freedom. One of these men, Agrippa Hull, fought in the American Revolution for over six years. He and the other African-American soldiers fought in order to improve their white neighbor's views of them and advance their own fight of freedom.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=Gary B.|journal=Phi Kappa Phi Forum|date=Summer 2006|volume=83|issue=3|pages=1–2|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&hid=103&sid=724d124b-75dd-44b9-a32f-b519ad6de8a8%40sessionmgr110|title=African-American}}</ref>

By contrast, the British and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] offered [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation]] to any enslaved person owned by a [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] who was willing to join the Loyalist forces. [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], the [[Governor of Virginia]], recruited 300 African-American men into his [[Ethiopian regiment]] within a month of making this proclamation. In South Carolina 25,000 enslaved people, more than one-quarter of the total, escaped to join and fight with the British, or fled for freedom in the uproar of war.  Thousands of slaves also escaped in Georgia and Virginia, as well as New England and New York.  Well-known African-Americans who fought for the British include [[Colonel Tye]] and [[Boston King]].{{cn|date=August 2020}}

The Americans eventually won the war. In the provisional treaty, they demanded the return of property, including enslaved people. Nonetheless, the British helped up to 3,000 documented African Americans to leave the country for [[Nova Scotia]], [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]], and Britain rather than be returned to slavery.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2narr4.html |title=The Revolutionary War |work=Revolution |access-date=2007-06-15| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070610005854/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2narr4.html| archive-date=June 10, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>

Thomas Peters was one of the large numbers of African Americans who [[Black Loyalist|fought for the British]]. Peters was born in present-day Nigeria and belonged to the Yoruba tribe, and ended up being captured and sold into slavery in [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learnquebec.ca/en/content/curriculum_elem/socialsciences/cycle3_resources/loyalists/background/loybkgr_peters.html|title="Who Were the Loyalists?".|website=learnquebec.ca|access-date=28 August 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073848/http://www.learnquebec.ca/en/content/curriculum_elem/socialsciences/cycle3_resources/loyalists/background/loybkgr_peters.html|archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> Sold again, he was enslaved in [[North Carolina]] and escaped his master's farm in order to receive Lord Dunmore's promise of freedom. Peters had fought for the British throughout the war. When the war finally ended, he and other African Americans who fought on the losing side were taken to Nova Scotia. Here, they encountered difficulty farming the small plots of lands they were granted. They also did not receive the same privileges and opportunities as the white [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] had. Peters sailed to London in order to complain to the government. "He arrived at a momentous time, when [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|English abolitionists]] were pushing a bill through Parliament to charter the Sierra Leone Company and to grant it trading and settlement rights on the West African coast." Peters and the other African Americans on Nova Scotia left for Sierra Leone in 1792. Peters died soon after they arrived but the other members of his party lived on in their new home.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=Gary B.|journal=Phi Kappa Phi Forum|date=Summer 2006|volume=83|issue=3|pages=2–3|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&hid=103&sid=724d124b-75dd-44b9-a32f-b519ad6de8a8%40sessionmgr110|title=African-American}}</ref>

The [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787 sought to define the foundation for the government of the newly formed United States of America. The [[US Constitution|constitution]] set forth the ideals of freedom and equality while providing for the continuation of the institution of slavery through the [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Extradition of slaves|fugitive slave clause]] and the [[three-fifths compromise]]. Additionally, free Black people's rights were also restricted in many places. Most were denied the right to vote and were excluded from public schools. Some Black people sought to fight these contradictions in court. In 1780, [[Elizabeth Freeman (Mum Bett)|Elizabeth Freeman]] and [[Quock Walker]] used language from the new [[Massachusetts]] constitution that declared all men were born free and equal in [[freedom suits]] to gain release from slavery. A free Black businessman in Boston named [[Paul Cuffe]] sought to be excused from paying taxes since he had no voting rights.<ref name="new_nation">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part2/2narr5.html |title=The Constitution and the New Nation |work=Revolution |access-date=June 15, 2007}}</ref>

In the Northern states, the revolutionary spirit did help African Americans. Beginning in the 1750s, there was widespread sentiment during the American Revolution that slavery was a social evil (for the country as a whole and for the whites) that should eventually be abolished.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} All the Northern states passed emancipation acts between 1780 and 1804; most of these arranged for gradual emancipation and a special status for [[freedmen]], so there were still a dozen "permanent apprentices" into the 19th century. In 1787 Congress passed the [[Northwest Ordinance]] and barred slavery from the large Northwest Territory.<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, paperback, 1994, pp. 78–79.</ref> In 1790, there were more than 59,000 free Black people in the United States. By 1810, that number had risen to 186,446. Most of these were in the North, but Revolutionary sentiments also motivated Southern slaveholders.

For 20 years after the Revolution, more Southerners also freed enslaved people, sometimes by manumission or in wills to be accomplished after the slaveholder's death.  In the Upper South, the percentage of free Black people rose from about 1% before the Revolution to more than 10% by 1810. [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] worked to persuade slaveholders to free families. In Virginia the number of free Black people increased from 10,000 in 1790 to nearly 30,000 in 1810, but 95% of Black people were still enslaved. In Delaware, three-quarters of all Black people were free by 1810.<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, paperback, 1994, p. 78.</ref> By 1860 just over 91% of Delaware's Black people were free, and 49.1% of those in Maryland.<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619–1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, paperback, 1994, pp. 82–83.</ref>

Among the successful free men was [[Benjamin Banneker]], a [[Maryland]] astronomer, mathematician, almanac author, surveyor and farmer, who in 1791 assisted in the initial survey of the boundaries of the future [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bedini|first=Silvio A.|year=1999|title=The Life of Benjamin Banneker: The First African-American Man of Science|edition=2nd|publisher=Maryland Historical Society|isbn=978-0-938420-59-0|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi}}</ref> Despite the challenges of living in the new country, most free Black people fared far better than the nearly 800,000 enslaved Blacks. Even so, many considered [[emigrating]] to Africa.<ref name="new_nation"/>

==Religion==
{{main| Religion in Black America|Black church}}
By 1800 a small number of slaves had joined Christian churches. Free Black people in the North set up their own networks of churches and in the South the slaves sat in the upper galleries of white churches. Central to the growth of community among blacks was the [[Black church]], usually the first communal institution to be established. The Black church was both an expression of community and unique African-American spirituality, and a reaction to discrimination. The churches also served as neighborhood centers where free Black people could celebrate their African heritage without intrusion from white detractors.  The church also served as the center of education. Since the church was part of the community and wanted to provide education; it educated the freed and enslaved Black people. Seeking autonomy, some black people like [[Richard Allen (bishop)]] founded separate Black denominations.<ref>Albert J. Raboteau, ''Canaan Land: A Religious History of African Americans'' (2001).</ref>

The [[Second Great Awakening]] (1800–1830s) has been called the "central and defining event in the development of Afro-Christianity."<ref>James H. Hutson, ''Religion and the founding of the American Republic'' (1998), p. 106.</ref><ref>Albert J. Raboteau,''Slave religion: the "invisible institution" in the antebellum South'' (1978) [https://books.google.com/books?id=C3AQUK-6A2cC online]</ref>

==The antebellum period==
{{See also|History of the United States (1789–1849)|Origins of the American Civil War}}
As the United States grew, the institution of slavery became more entrenched in the [[Southern United States|southern states]], while northern states began to [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolish]] it. [[Pennsylvania]] was the first, in 1780 passing an act for gradual abolition.<ref>Edward Raymond Turner, "The Abolition of Slavery in Pennsylvania." ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'' (1912): 129–142. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20085586 in JSTOR]</ref>

A number of events continued to shape views on slavery. One of these events was the [[Haitian Revolution]], which was the only slave revolt that led to an independent country. Many slave owners fled to the United States with tales of horror and massacre that alarmed Southern whites.<ref>Franklin W. Knight, "The Haitian Revolution," ''American Historical Review'' (2000), 105#1, pp. 103–115; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2652438 in JSTOR]</ref>

The invention of the [[cotton gin]] in the 1790s allowed the cultivation of short staple cotton, which could be grown in much of the Deep South, where warm weather and proper soil conditions prevailed. The industrial revolution in Europe and New England generated a heavy demand for cotton for cheap clothing, which caused an exponential demand for slave labor to develop new [[cotton plantation]]s. There was a 70% increase in the number of slaves in the United States in only 20 years. They were overwhelmingly concentrated on plantations in the [[Deep South]], and moved west as old cotton fields lost their productivity and new lands were purchased. Unlike the Northern States who put more focus into manufacturing and commerce, the South was heavily dependent on agriculture.<ref>Douglas R, Egerton, "Slaves to the Marketplace: Economic Liberty and Black Rebelliousness in the Atlantic World." ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 26, no. 4 (Winter 2006): 617–639.</ref> Southern political economists at this time supported the institution by concluding that nothing was inherently contradictory about owning slaves and that a future of slavery existed even if the South were to industrialize.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carlander|first=Jay|author2=Elliot Brownlee|title=Antebellum Southern Political Economists and the Problem of Slavery|journal=American Nineteenth Century History|date=September 2006|volume=7|issue=3|pages=393 |doi=10.1080/14664650600956585|s2cid=145385967}}</ref>  Racial, economic, and political turmoil reached an all-time high regarding slavery up to the events of the Civil War.

In 1807, at the urging of President [[Thomas Jefferson]], Congress abolished the importation of enslaved workers. While American Black people celebrated this as a victory in the fight against slavery, the ban increased the internal trade in enslaved people. Changing agricultural practices in the Upper South from tobacco to mixed farming decreased labor requirements, and enslaved people were sold to traders for the developing Deep South. In addition, the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]] allowed any Black person to be claimed as a runaway unless a White person testified on their behalf. A number of free Black people, especially [[indentured servants|indentured]] children, were [[kidnap]]ped and sold into slavery with little or no hope of rescue. By 1819 there were exactly 11 free and 11 slave states, which increased [[sectionalism]]. Fears of an imbalance in Congress led to the 1820 [[Missouri Compromise]] that required states to be admitted to the union in pairs, one slave and one free.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3narr6.html |title=Growth and Entrenchment of Slavery |work=Brotherly Love |publisher=PBS |access-date=June 16, 2007}}</ref>

In 1850, after winning the [[Mexican-American War]], a problem gripped the nation: what to do about the territories won from Mexico. Henry Clay, the man behind the [[compromise of 1820]], once more rose to the challenge, to craft the [[compromise of 1850]]. In this compromise the territories of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada would be organized but the issue of slavery would be decided later. Washington D.C. would abolish the slave trade but not slavery itself. California would be admitted as a free state but the South would receive a new [[fugitive slave act]] which required Northerners to return enslaved people who escaped to the North to their owners. The compromise of 1850 would maintain a shaky peace until the election of Lincoln in 1860.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2951.html|publisher=PBS|access-date=April 12, 2012}}</ref>

In 1851 the battle between enslaved people and slave owners was met in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]]. [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania#Slavery and the Christiana incident|The Christiana Riot]] demonstrated the growing conflict between [[states' rights]] and Congress on the issue of slavery.<ref>Carson, Clayborne, Emma J. Lapsansky-Werner, and Gary B. Nash, "A Prelude to War: The 1850s," in ''The Struggle for Freedom: A History of African Americans'' (Boston: Prentice Hall, 2011), 206–207.</ref>

===Abolitionism===
[[Abolitionism|Abolitionists]] in Britain and the United States in the 1840–1860 period developed large, complex propaganda campaigns against slavery. Stampp says that, "Though abolitionists never argued that the physical treatment of slaves had any decisive bearing on the issue of the morality of slavery, their propaganda emphasized (and doubtless exaggerated) cruelties and atrocities for the purpose of winning converts."<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth M. Stampp|title=The Imperiled Union: Essays on the Background of the Civil War|url=https://archive.org/details/imperileduniones00stam_0|url-access=registration|year=1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/imperileduniones00stam_0/page/85 85]|isbn=9780199878529}}</ref> Blight says,
:"The authenticity of these reports about southern atrocity is questionable. I know of no verification for them. The propaganda uses of such stories, though, were not lost on abolitionist editors such as [[Frederick Douglass|Douglass]]."<ref>{{cite book|author=David W. Blight|title=Frederick Douglass' Civil War: Keeping Faith in Jubilee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABWQVKj00-8C&pg=PA86|year=1991|publisher=LSU Press|pages=86–87|isbn=9780807117248}}</ref>

Kennicott argues that the largest and most effective abolitionist speakers were Black people who spoke before the countless local meetings of the [[Colored Conventions Movement|National Negro Conventions]]. They used the traditional arguments against slavery, protesting it on moral, economic, and political grounds. Their role in the antislavery movement not only aided abolitionist propaganda but also was a source of pride to the Black community.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kennicott | first1 = Patrick C. | year = 1970 | title = Black Persuaders in the Antislavery Movement | journal = Journal of Black Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 5–20 | doi=10.1177/002193477000100102| s2cid = 143734647 }}</ref>

In 1852, [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] published a novel that changed how the North would view slavery. ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' tells the story of the life of a enslaved person and the brutality that is faced by that life day after day. It would sell over 100,000 copies in its first year. The popularity of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' would solidify the North in its opposition to slavery. Lincoln would later invite Stowe to the White House in honor of this book that changed America.

In 1856 [[Charles Sumner]]! a Massachusetts congressmen and antislavery leader, [[Caning of Charles Sumner|was assaulted and nearly killed]] on the House floor by Preston Brooks of South Carolina. Brooks received praise in the South for his actions while Sumner became an iconic martyr in the North. Sumner later returned to the Senate, where he was a leader of the [[Radical Republicans]] in ending slavery and legislating equal rights for freed slaves.<ref>Williamjames Hull Hoffer, ''The Caning of Charles Sumner'' (2010) [https://www.amazon.com/Caning-Charles-Witness-History-ebook/dp/B003X4L554/ excerpt and text search]</ref>

Over 1 million enslaved people were moved from the older seaboard slave states, with their declining economies, to the rich cotton states of the southwest; many others were sold and moved locally.<ref>Adam Rothman, ''Slave Country: American Expansion and the Origins of the Deep South'' (2005).</ref> Berlin (2000) argues that this [[Second Middle Passage]] shredded the planters' paternalist pretenses in the eyes of Black people and prodded enslaved people and free Black people to create a host of oppositional ideologies and institutions that better accounted for the realities of endless deportations, expulsions! and flights that continually remade their world.<ref>Ira Berlin, ''Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America'' (2000).32</ref> Benjamin Quarles' work ''Black Abolitionists'' provides the most extensive account of the role of Black abolitionists in the American anti-slavery movement.<ref>Benjamin Quarles, ''Black Abolitionists'' (London, [[Oxford University Press]], 1969).</ref>

===The Black community===
<ref>The number of free Blacks grew during this time as well. By 1830 there were 319,000 free Blacks in the United States. About 150,000 lived in the northern states.</ref> Black people generally settled in cities, creating the core of Black community life in the region. They established churches and fraternal orders.  Many of these early efforts were weak and they often failed, but they represented the initial steps in the evolution of Black communities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Quintard|title=The Emergence of Black communities in the Pacific Northwest: 1865–1910.|year=1979|volume=64|issue=4|pages=342–354|doi=10.2307/2716942|jstor=2716942|journal=The Journal of Negro History}}</ref>

During the early Antebellum period, the creation of free Black communities began to expand, laying out a foundation for African Americans' future. At first, only a few thousand African Americans had their freedom. As the years went by, the number of blacks being freed expanded tremendously, building to 233,000 by the 1820s. They sometimes sued to gain their freedom or purchased it. Some slave owners freed their bondspeople and a few state legislatures abolished slavery.<ref name="Carson 2007"/>

African Americans tried to take the advantage of establishing homes and jobs in the cities. During the early 1800s free Black people took several steps to establish fulfilling work lives in urban areas.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Rowman & Littlefield | isbn = 978-0-8476-9701-4 | last = Meyer | first = Stephen Grant | title = As long as they don't move next door: segregation and racial conflict in American neighborhoods | location = Lanham, Md. | year = 2001 }}</ref> The rise of industrialization, which depended on power-driven machinery more than human labor, might have afforded them employment, but many owners of textile mills refused to hire Black workers. These owners considered whites to be more reliable and educable. This resulted in many Black people performing unskilled labor. Black men worked as [[stevedore]]s, [[construction worker]], and as cellar-, well- and grave-diggers. As for Black women workers, they worked as servants for white families. Some women were also cooks, seamstresses, basket-makers, midwives, teachers, and nurses.<ref name="Carson 2007"/> Black women worked as washerwomen or domestic servants for the white families. Some cities had independent Black seamstresses, cooks, basketmakers, confectioners, and more.

While the African Americans left the thought of slavery behind, they made a priority to reunite with their family and friends. The cause of the Revolutionary War forced many Black people to migrate to the west afterwards, and the scourge of poverty created much difficulty with housing. African Americans competed with the Irish and Germans in jobs and had to share space with them.<ref name="Carson 2007"/>

While the majority of free Black people lived in poverty, some were able to establish successful businesses that catered to the Black community. [[Racial discrimination]] often meant that Black people were not welcome or would be mistreated in White businesses and other establishments. To counter this, Black people like [[James Forten]] developed their own communities with Black-owned businesses. Black doctors, lawyers, and other businessmen were the foundation of the Black [[middle class]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3narr1.html |title=Philadelphia |work=Brotherly Love |access-date=June 17, 2007}}</ref>

Many Black people organized to help strengthen the Black community and continue the fight against slavery. One of these organizations was the American Society of Free Persons of Colour, founded in 1830. This organization provided social aid to poor Black people and organized responses to political issues. Further supporting the growth of the Black Community was the [[Black church]], usually the first community institution to be established. Starting in the early 1800s<ref>{{Cite journal | volume = 90 | issue = 4 | pages = 205‒236 | last = Hopkins | first = Leroy T. | title = Bethel African Methodist Church in Lancaster: Prolegomenon to a Social History | journal = Journal of the Lancaster County Historical Society | year = 1986 }}</ref> with the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] and other churches, the Black church grew to be the focal point of the Black community. The Black church was both an expression of community and unique African-American spirituality, and a reaction to European American discrimination. The church also served as neighborhood centers where free black people could celebrate their African heritage without intrusion by white detractors.<ref name="Carson 2007">{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = Prentice Hall | isbn = 9780205832408 | last = Carson | first = Clayborne | author-link = Clayborne Carson | title = The Struggle for Freedom: A History of African Americans | location = Boston | series = Penguin academics | year = 2011 }}</ref> The church was the center of the Black communities, but it was also the center of education.

Free Black people also established Black churches in the South before 1800. After the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]], many Black people joined the [[Baptist Church]], which allowed for their participation, including roles as elders and preachers. For instance, [[First Baptist Church (Petersburg, Virginia)|First Baptist Church]] and [[Gillfield Baptist Church (Petersburg, Virginia)|Gillfield Baptist Church]] of [[Petersburg, Virginia]], both had organized congregations by 1800 and were the first Baptist churches in the city.<ref>{{Cite book | edition = Updated | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0195174137 | last = Raboteau | first = Albert J. | title = Slave religion: the "invisible institution" in the antebellum South | location = Oxford; New York | year = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C3AQUK-6A2cC&q=Gillfield+Baptist+Church,+Petersburg,+VA&pg=PA188 | access-date =December 27, 2008}}</ref> Petersburg, an industrial city, by 1860 had 3,224 free Black people (36% of Black people, and about 26% of all free persons), the largest population in the South.<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = University of Virginia Press | isbn = 978-0813925707 | last = Greene | first = A.

===Haiti's effect on slavery===
{{Main|Haitian Revolution}}
The revolt of enslaved Hatians against their white slave owners, which began in 1791 and lasted until 1801, was a primary source of fuel for both enslaved people and abolitionists arguing for the freedom of Africans in the U.S. In the 1833 edition of [[Hezekiah Niles|''Nile's Weekly Register'']] it is stated that freed Black people in Haiti were better off than their Jamaican counterparts, and the positive effects of [[Emancipation Proclamation|American Emancipation]]  are alluded to throughout the paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlanticslaverydebate.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/shared/ASD/Module3/FreeNgrosandSlves1833.pdf|title=''Nile's Weekly Register''.|website=stanford.edu|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref> These anti-slavery sentiments were popular among both white abolitionists and African-American slaves. Enslaved people rallied around these ideas with rebellions against their masters as well as white bystanders during the [[Denmark Vesey|Denmark Vesey Conspiracy of 1822]] and the [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|Nat Turner Rebellion of 1831]]. Leaders and plantation owners were also very concerned about the consequences Haiti's revolution would have on early America. Thomas Jefferson, for one, was wary of the "instability of the West Indies", referring to Haiti.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlanticslaverydebate.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/shared/ASD/Module3/JffrsnToRufusKing1802.pdf|title=''The Works of thomas Jefferson''.|website=stanford.edu|access-date= August 28, 2017}}</ref>

===The Dred Scott decision===
{{Main|Dred Scott v. Sandford}}
[[File:Cicatrices de flagellation sur un esclave.jpg|thumb|200px|Peter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historylink101.com/bw/American_Image/slides/4-j-IMG_1583.html|title=Ten days from today I left the plantation|website=historylink101.com|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref> aka [[Gordon (slave)|Gordon]], a former enslaved person displays the telltale criss-cross, [[keloid]] scars from being [[bullwhip]]ped, 1863.]]
[[Dred Scott]] was an enslaved person whose owner had taken him to live in the free state of Illinois. After his owner's death, Dred Scott sued in court for his freedom on the basis of his having lived in a free state for a long period. The Black community received an enormous shock with the Supreme Court's "Dred Scott" decision in March 1857.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dred Scott's fight for freedom 1846–1857|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2932.html|access-date=June 12, 2012}}</ref> Black people were not American citizens and could never be citizens, the court said in a decision roundly denounced by the Republican Party as well as the abolitionists. Because enslaved people were "property, not people", by this ruling they could not sue in court. The decision was finally reversed by the Civil Rights Act of 1865.<ref>Don Fehrenbacher, ''The Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in American Law and Politics'' (2001).</ref> In what is sometimes considered mere [[obiter dictum]] the Court went on to hold that Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in federal territories because enslaved people are personal property and the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the Constitution protects property owners against deprivation of their property without due process of law. Although the Supreme Court has never explicitly overruled the Dred Scott case, the Court stated in the [[Slaughter-House Cases]] that at least one part of it had already been overruled by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868, which begins by stating, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."<ref>[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]</ref>

==The American Civil War, Emancipation==
{{See also|American Civil War|Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War|Emancipation Proclamation}}
The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was an executive order issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million enslaved people in designated areas of the Confederacy from "slave" to "free." It had the practical effect that as soon as an enslaved person escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the enslaved person became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their enslaved people as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated enslaved people.<ref>Michael Vorenberg, ed. ''The Emancipation Proclamation: A Brief History with Documents'' (2010)</ref>

About 200,000 free Black people and former enslaved people served in the Union Army and Navy, thus providing a basis for a claim to full citizenship.<ref>Hondon B. Hargrove, ''Black Union Soldiers in the Civil War'' (2003).</ref> The severe dislocations of war and Reconstruction had a severe negative impact on the Black population, with a large amount of sickness and death.<ref>Jim Downs, ''Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2015)</ref>

==Reconstruction==
[[File:EmancipationProclamationPage1.jpg|thumb|left|The Emancipation Proclamation.]]
The [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]] made Black people full U.S. citizens (and this repealed the Dred Scott decision). In 1868, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] granted full U.S. citizenship to African-Americans. The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]], ratified in 1870, extended the right to vote to Black males. The [[Freedmen's Bureau]] was an important institution established to create social and economic order in southern states.<ref name="Carson, Clayborne 2011" />

After the Union victory over the Confederacy, a brief period of Southern Black progress, called Reconstruction, followed. During the Reconstruction the entire face of the South changed because the remaining states were readmitted into the Union.<ref>{{cite web|last=Authors|first=Various|title=The Reconstruction Period, an Overview|url=http://history-world.org/reconstruction_period.htm|access-date=December 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122085159/http://history-world.org/reconstruction_period.htm|archive-date=January 22, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> From 1865 to 1877, under protection of Union troops, some strides were made toward equal rights for African-Americans. Southern Black men began to vote and were elected to the [[United States Congress]] and to local offices such as sheriff.  The safety provided by the troops did not last long, and white Southerners frequently terrorized Black voters. Coalitions of white and Black Republicans passed bills to establish the first public school systems in most states of the South, although sufficient funding was hard to find.  Black people established their own churches, towns, and businesses.  Tens of thousands migrated to Mississippi for the chance to clear and own their own land, as 90% of the bottomlands were undeveloped. By the end of the 19th century, two-thirds of the farmers who owned land in the [[Mississippi Delta]] bottomlands were Black.<ref>{{cite book |first=John C. |last=Willis |title=Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War |location=Charlottesville |publisher=University of Virginia |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8139-1971-3 }}</ref>

[[Hiram Rhodes Revels|Hiram Revels]] became the first African-American senator in the U.S. Congress in 1870. Other African Americans soon came to Congress from South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. These new politicians supported the Republicans and tried to bring further improvements to the lives of African Americans.

==Jim Crow, disenfranchisement and challenges==
{{See also|Civil rights movement (1865–1896)}}
The Jim Crow laws were state and local laws in the United States enacted between 1876 and 1965. They mandated de jure segregation in all public facilities, with a supposedly "separate but equal" status for Black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were usually inferior to those provided for white Americans, systematizing a number of economic, educational and social disadvantages.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

In the face of years of mounting violence and intimidation directed at blacks as well as whites sympathetic to their cause, the U.S. government retreated from its pledge to guarantee constitutional protections to freedmen and women. When President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] withdrew Union troops from the South in 1877 as a result of a national compromise on the election, Black people lost most of their political power. Men like [[Benjamin "Pap" Singleton]] began speaking of leaving the South. This idea culminated in the 1879–80 movement of the [[Exodusters]], who migrated to Kansas, where blacks had much more freedom and it was easier to acquire land.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

When Democrats took control of Tennessee in 1888, they passed laws making voter registration more complicated and ended the most competitive political state in the South. Voting by Black people in rural areas and small towns dropped sharply, as did voting by poor whites.<ref>[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=380 Connie L. Lester, "Disenfranchising Laws", Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture], accessed 17 April 2008.</ref><ref>[https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon", ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, p. 27], accessed March 10, 2008.</ref>

From 1890 to 1908, starting with Mississippi and ending with Georgia, ten of eleven Southern states adopted new constitutions or amendments that effectively [[disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most black people and many poor whites. Using a combination of provisions such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency requirements and [[literacy tests]], states dramatically decreased Black voter registration and turnout, in some cases to zero.<ref name="papers.ssrn.com">[https://ssrn.com/abstract=224731 Richard H. Pildes, "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon"], ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, pp. 12–13, accessed March 10, 2008.</ref> The [[grandfather clause]] was used in many states temporarily to exempt illiterate white voters from literacy tests. As power became concentrated under the Democratic Party in the South, the party positioned itself as a private club and instituted [[white primaries]], closing Black people out of the only competitive contests. By 1910 one-party white rule was firmly established across the South.

Although African Americans quickly started litigation to challenge such provisions, early court decisions at the state and national level went against them. In ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'' (1898), the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld state provisions. This encouraged other Southern states to adopt similar measures over the next few years, as noted above. [[Booker T. Washington]], of [[Tuskegee Institute]] secretly worked with Northern supporters to raise funds and provide representation for African Americans in additional cases, such as ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903) and ''[[Giles v. Teasley]]'' (1904), but again the Supreme Court upheld the states.<ref name="papers.ssrn.com"/>

Segregation for the first time became a standard legal process in the South; it was informal in Northern cities. Jim Crow limited black access to transportation, schools, restaurants and other public facilities. Most southern blacks for decades continued to struggle in grinding poverty as agricultural, domestic and menial laborers. Many became [[sharecropper]]s, sharing the crop with the white land owners..

===Racial terrorism===
In 1865, the [[Ku Klux Klan]], a secret white supremacist [[criminal]] organization dedicated to destroying the Republican Party in the South, especially by terrorizing Black leaders, was formed. Klansmen hid behind masks and robes to hide their identity while they carried out violence and property damage. The Klan used [[terrorism]], especially murder and threats of murder, arson and intimidation. The Klan's excesses led to the passage of legislation against it, and with Federal enforcement, it was destroyed by 1871.<ref>Allen W. Trelease, '' White Terror: The Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction'' (1995)</ref>

The anti-Republican and anti-freedmen sentiment only briefly went underground, as violence arose in other incidents, especially after Louisiana's disputed state election in 1872, which contributed to the [[Colfax massacre|Colfax]] and [[Coushatta massacre]]s in [[Louisiana]] in 1873 and 1874. Tensions and rumors were high in many parts of the South. When violence erupted, African Americans consistently were killed at a much higher rate than were European Americans. Historians of the 20th century have renamed events long called "riots" in southern history. The common stories featured whites heroically saving the community from marauding Black people. Upon examination of the evidence, historians have called numerous such events "massacres", as at Colfax, because of the disproportionate number of fatalities for Black people as opposed to whites. The mob violence there resulted in 40–50 Black people dead for each of the three whites killed.<ref name="ftp.rootsweb.com">[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/state/history/military/uncat/colfaxr.txt "Military Report on Colfax Riot, 1875", from the ''Congressional Record''], accessed 6 April 2008. A state historical marker erected in 1950 noted that 150 blacks died and three whites.</ref>

While not as widely known as the Klan, the [[paramilitary organizations]] that arose in the South during the mid-1870s as the white Democrats mounted a stronger insurgency, were more directed and effective than the Klan in challenging Republican governments, suppressing the Black vote and achieving political goals. Unlike the Klan, paramilitary members operated openly, often solicited newspaper coverage, and had distinct political goals: to turn Republicans out of office and suppress or dissuade Black voting in order to regain power in 1876. Groups included the [[White League]], that started from white militias in Grant Parish, Louisiana, in 1874 and spread in the [[Deep South]]; the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], that started in [[Mississippi]] in 1875 but had chapters arise and was prominent in the 1876 election campaign in [[South Carolina]], as well as in [[North Carolina]]; and other White Line organizations such as rifle clubs.<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2007, pp. 70–76.</ref>

[[File:Robert McDaniels.jpg|thumb|left|Robert McDaniels lynched. Apr. 13, 1937]]

The [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era accompanied the most cruel wave of "racial" suppression that America has yet experienced.  Between 1890 and 1940, millions of African Americans were disenfranchised, killed, and brutalized. According to newspaper records kept at the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]], about 5,000 men, women, and children were murdered in documented extrajudicial mob violence—called "[[lynchings]]."  The journalist [[Ida B. Wells]] estimated that lynchings not reported by the newspapers, plus similar executions under the veneer of "[[due process]]", may have amounted to about 20,000 killings.<ref>{{Cite book|last=History|first=Adeyemi College of Education Dept of|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGw8AQAAIAAJ&q=lynching+ida+b+wells+20,000+killings+veneer|title=Themes in humanities and African experience|date=2008|publisher=Dept. of History, Adeyemi College of Education|language=en}}</ref>

Of the tens of thousands of lynchers and onlookers during this period, it is reported that fewer than 50 whites were ever indicted for their crimes, and only four were sentenced. Because Black people were disenfranchised, they could not sit on juries or have any part in the political process, including local offices. Meanwhile, the lynchings were used as a weapon of terror to keep millions of African-Americans living in a constant state of anxiety and fear.<ref>For the story of the lynchings, see Philip Dray, ''At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America'' (New York: Random House, 2002). For the systematic oppression and terror inflicted, see Leon F. Litwack, ''Trouble in Mind: Black Southerners in the Age of Jim Crow'' (New York, 1998).</ref>
Most Black people were denied their [[right to keep and bear arms]] under Jim Crow laws, and they were therefore unable to protect themselves or their families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guncite.com/journals/cd-recon.html|title=The Second Amendment: Toward an Afro-Americanist Reconsideration|first=Robert J.

==Civil rights==
In response to these and other setbacks, in the summer of 1905, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and 28 other prominent, African-American men met secretly at [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]. There, they produced a manifesto calling for an end to racial discrimination, full civil liberties for African Americans and recognition of human brotherhood. The organization they established came to be called the [[Niagara Movement]]. After the notorious [[Springfield, Illinois]] race riot of 1908, a group of concerned Whites joined with the leadership of the Niagara Movement and formed the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) a year later, in 1909. Under the leadership of Du Bois, the NAACP mounted legal challenges to segregation and lobbied legislatures on behalf of Black Americans.

While the NAACP use the court system to promote equality, at the local level African Americans adopted a self-help strategy. They pooled their resources to create independent community and institutional lives for themselves. They established schools, churches, social welfare institutions, banks, [[African-American newspapers]] and small businesses to serve the needs of their communities.<ref>August Meier, "Booker T. Washington and the Negro Press: With Special Reference to the Colored American Magazine." ''Journal of Negro History'' (1953): 67–90.

Washington]].<ref>Robert Norrell, ''Up From History: the life of Booker T. Washington'' (Harvard University Press, 2009).</ref>

[[Progressive Era]] reformers were often concerned with the Black condition.  In 1908 after the [[Atlanta race riot|1906 Atlanta Race Riot]] got him involved, [[Ray Stannard Baker]] published the book ''Following the Color Line: An Account of Negro Citizenship in the American Democracy'', becoming the first prominent journalist to examine America's racial divide; it was extremely successful.  Sociologist Rupert Vance says it is:
:the best account of race relations in the South during the period—one that reads like field notes for the future historian. This account was written during the zenith of Washingtonian movement and shows the optimism that it inspired among both liberals and moderates. The book is also notable for its realistic accounts of Negro town life.<ref>Rupert Vance, "The 20th-century South as Viewed by English-speaking Travelers, 1900–1955" in Thomas D.

==The Great Migration and the Harlem Renaissance==
{{Main|Great Migration (African American)}}
[[File:GreatMigration1910to1970-UrbanPopulation.png|thumb|The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] shown through changes in African American share of population in major US cities, 1910–1940 and [[Second Great Migration (African American)|1940–1970]]]] During the first half of the 20th century, the largest internal population shift in U.S. history took place. Starting about 1910, through the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] over five million African Americans made choices and "voted with their feet" by moving from the South to northern and western cities in hopes of escaping political discrimination and hatred, violence, finding better jobs, voting and enjoying greater equality and education for their children.<ref>Steven A. Reich, ed. ''The Great Black Migration: A Historical Encyclopedia of the American Mosaic'' (2014)</ref>

In the 1920s, the concentration of Black people in New York led to the cultural movement known as the [[Harlem Renaissance]], whose influence reached nationwide.  Black intellectual and cultural circles were influenced by thinkers such as [[Aimé Césaire]] and [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], who celebrated blackness, or [[négritude]]; and arts and letters flourished.  Writers [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Nella Larsen]], [[Claude McKay]] and [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]; and artists [[Lois Mailou Jones]], William H. Johnson, [[Romare Bearden]], [[Jacob Lawrence]] and [[Archibald Motley]] gained prominence.<ref>Nathan Irvin Huggins, ''Harlem renaissance'' (Oxford University Press, 2007).</ref>

The [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side of Chicago]], a destination for many on the trains up from Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana, joined Harlem as a sort of Black capital for the nation. It generated flourishing businesses, music, arts and foods. A new generation of powerful African-American political leaders and organizations also came to the fore, Typified by Congressman [[William L. Dawson (politician)|William Dawson]] (1886–1970). Membership in the NAACP rapidly increased as it mounted an anti-lynching campaign in reaction to ongoing southern white violence against blacks. [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]], the [[Nation of Islam]], and union organizer [[A. Philip Randolph]]'s [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]] (part of the American Federation of labor) all were established during this period and found support among African Americans, who became urbanized.<ref>Allan H.

===Women in the beauty business===
Although most prominent [[African-American businesses]] have been owned by men, women played a major role especially in the area of beauty. Standards of beauty were different for whites and Black people, and the Black community developed its own standards, with an emphasis on hair care. Beauticians could work out of their own homes, and did not need storefronts. As a result, Black beauticians were numerous in the rural South, despite the absence of cities and towns. They pioneered the use of cosmetics, at a time when rural white women in the South avoided them. As Blain Roberts has shown, beauticians offered their clients a space to feel pampered and beautiful in the context of their own community because, "Inside Black beauty shops, rituals of beautification converged with rituals of socialization." Beauty contests emerged in the 1920s, and in the white community they were linked to agricultural county fairs. By contrast in the Black community, beauty contests were developed out of the homecoming ceremonies at their high schools and colleges.<ref>Blain Roberts, ''Pageants, Parlors, and Pretty Women: Race and Beauty in the Twentieth-Century South'' (2014), quote p. 96.

===Soldiers===
The U.S. armed forces remained segregated during World War I. Still, many African Americans eagerly volunteered to join the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] cause following America's entry into the war. More than two million African American men rushed to register for the draft. By the time of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice with Germany]] in November 1918, over 350,000 African Americans had served with the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front.[https://books.google.com.gh/books?id=grbkAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=By+the+time+of+the+armistice+with+Germany+in+November+1918,+over+350,000+African+Americans+had+served+with+the+American+Expeditionary+Force+on+the+Western+Front&source=bl&ots=DzuzOWPbIi&sig=ACfU3U3S_LIPKMsfpU2MZn7MWpVudU4mtQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjk3uT31M3pAhUNYxoKHUGxB0sQ6AEwCnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=By%20the%20time%20of%20the%20armistice%20with%20Germany%20in%20November%201918%2C%20over%20350%2C000%20African%20Americans%20had%20served%20with%20the%20American%20Expeditionary%20Force%20on%20the%20Western%20Front&f=false]<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Price of Freedom: Printable Exhibition|url=https://amhistory.si.edu/militaryhistory/printable/section.asp?id=8|website=amhistory.si.edu|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Commemorating the Great War – World War I Centennial|url=https://www.worldwar1centennial.org/index.php/educate/places/why-commemorate.html|website=www.worldwar1centennial.org|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Jordan|first=John|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=grbkAwAAQBAJ&q=The+U.S.+armed+forces+remained+segregated+during+World+War+I.+Still,+many+African+Americans+eagerly+volunteered+to+join+the+Allied+cause+following+America's+entry+into+the+war.+More+than+two+million+African+American+men+rushed+to+register+for+the+draft.+By+the+time+of+the+armistice+with+Germany+in+November+1918,+over+350,000+African+Americans+had+served+with+the+American+Expeditionary+Force+on+the+Western+Front&pg=PA129|title=Born Black in the U.S.A.|date=2014|publisher=Dorrance Publishing|isbn=978-1-4349-1484-2|language=en}}</ref>

Most African American units were relegated to support roles and did not see combat. Still, African Americans played a significant role in America's war effort. Four African American regiments were integrated into French units because the French suffered heavy losses and badly needed men after three years of a terrible war. One of the most distinguished units was the [[369th Infantry Regiment]], known as the "Harlem Hellfighters", which was on the front lines for six months, longer than any other American unit in the war. 171 members of the 369th were awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

From May 1918 to November 1918, the 371st and 372nd African American Regiments were integrated under the 157th Red Hand Division<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/602_redhandflag.html|title=Red Hand Flag – History Detectives |website=Pbs.org|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref> commanded by the French General [[Mariano Goybet]]. They earned glory in the decisive final offensive in Champagne region of France. The two Regiments were decorated by the French [[Croix de Guerre]] for their gallantry in the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].

Corporal [[Freddie Stowers]] of the [[371st Infantry Regiment (United States)|371st Infantry Regiment]] was posthumously awarded a [[Medal of Honor]]—the only African American to be so honored for actions in World War I. During action in [[France]], Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, continuing to lead and encourage his men even after being wounded twice. Stowers died from his wounds, but his men continued the fight on a German machine gun nest near Bussy farm in Champagne, and eventually defeated the [[Reichswehr|German troops]].

Stowers was recommended for the Medal of Honor shortly after his death, but according to the Army, the nomination was misplaced. Many believed the recommendation had been intentionally ignored due to [[Racism against African Americans in the U.S. military|institutional racism in the Armed Forces]]. In 1990, under pressure from [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] launched an investigation. Based on findings from this investigation, the Army Decorations Board approved the award of the Medal of Honor to Stowers. On April 24, 1991—73 years after he was killed in action—Stowers' two surviving sisters received the Medal of Honor from President [[George H. W. Bush]] at the White House.

=== Home front and postwar ===
{{Further|United States home front during World War I|Great Migration (African American)}}
With an enormous demand for expansion of the defense industries, the new draft law in effect, and the cut off of immigration from Europe, demand was very high for underemployed farmers from the South. Hundreds of thousands of African-Americans took the trains to Northern industrial centers in a dramatic historical event known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns in western Pennsylvania between 1890 and 1930 faced racial discrimination and limited economic opportunities. The Black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910.  Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's Black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the Black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities.<ref>Joe W. Trotter, "Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania."

''African Americans in Pennsylvania: Shifting Historical Perspectives'' (Penn State Press, 2010).</ref>
Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process:
:Although African-Americans often expressed their views of the Great Migration in biblical terms and received encouragement from northern black newspapers, railroad companies, and industrial labor agents, they also drew upon family and friendship networks to help in the move to Western Pennsylvania. They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.<ref>Trotter, "Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania," p. 154.</ref>

After the war ended and the soldiers returned home, tensions were very high, with serious labor union strikes and inter-racial riots in major cities. The summer of 1919 was known as the [[Red Summer]] with outbreaks of racial violence killing about 1,000 people across the nation, most of whom were Black.<ref>Jam Voogd, ''Race Riots & Resistance: The Red Summer of 1919'' (Peter Lang, 2008).</ref><ref>David F. Krugler, ''1919, The Year of Racial Violence'' (Cambridge UP, 2014).</ref>

Nevertheless, the newly established Black communities in the North nearly all endured. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area:
:Black churches, fraternal orders, and newspapers (especially the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]''); organizations such as the NAACP, Urban League, and Garvey Movement; social clubs, restaurants, and baseball teams; hotels, beauty shops, barber shops, and taverns, all proliferated.<ref>Trotter, "Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania," pp. 156–157.</ref>

==New Deal==

The Great Depression hit Black America hard. In 1930, it was reported that 4 out of 5 Black people lived in the South, the average life expectancy for Black people was 15 years less than whites, and the Black infant mortality rate at 12% was double that of whites.<ref>Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 18</ref> In Chicago, Black people made up 4% of the population and 16% of the unemployed while in Pittsburgh blacks were 8% of the population and 40% of the unemployed.<ref>Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 87</ref> In January 1934, the journalist [[Lorena Hickok]] reported from rural Georgia that she had seen "half-starved Whites and Blacks struggle in competition for less to eat than my dog gets at home, for the privilege of living in huts that are infinitely less comfortable than his kennel".<ref name="Kennedy-p193">Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 193</ref> She also described most Southern Black people who made worked as sharecroppers as living under a system very close to slavery.<ref name="Kennedy-p193"/> A visiting British journalist wrote she "had traveled over most of Europe and part of Africa, but I have never seen such terrible sights as I saw yesterday among the sharecroppers of Arkansas".<ref>Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 208</ref>

The New Deal did not have a specific program for Black people only, but it sought to incorporate them in all the relief programs that it began.<ref>Roger Biles, '' A New Deal for the American People'' (1991), pp. 172–193.</ref><ref>Christopher G. Wye, The New Deal and the Negro community: Toward a broader conceptualization." The Journal of American History 59.3 (1972): 621–639. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1900661 in JSTOR]</ref> The most important relief agencies were the [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]] for young men (who worked in segregated units), the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|FERA]] relief programs in 1933–35 (run by local towns and cities), and especially the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], which employed 2,000,000 or more workers nationwide under federal control, 1935–42. All races had had the same wage rates and working conditions in the WPA.<ref>Raymond Wolters, "The New Deal and the Negro." in John Braeman, ed. ''The New Deal: The National Level'' (1975) 1:170–217.</ref>

A rival federal agency was the [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), headed by long-time civil rights activist [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]]. It set quotas for private firms hiring skilled and unskilled Black people in construction projects financed through the PWA, overcoming the objections of labor unions. In this way, the New Deal ensured that blacks were 13% of the unskilled PWA jobs in Chicago, 60% in Philadelphia and 71% in Jacksonville, Florida; their share of the skilled jobs was 4%, 6%, and 17%, respectively.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kruman | first1 = Mark S. | year = 1975 | title = Quotas for Blacks: The Public Works Administration and the Black Construction Worker | journal = Labor History | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 37–51 | doi=10.1080/00236567508584321}}</ref> In the Department of Agriculture, there was a lengthy bureaucratic struggle in 1933–35 between one faction which favored rising prices for farmers vs. another faction which favored reforms to assist sharecroppers, especially Black ones.  When one Agriculture Department official, [[Alger Hiss]], in early 1935 wrote up a directive to ensure that Southern landlords were paying sharecroppers for their labor (which most of them did not), Senator [[Ellison D. Smith]] stormed into his office and shouted: "Young fella, you can't do this to my niggers, paying checks to them".<ref>Kennedy, ''Freedom From Fear'', p. 212</ref> The Agriculture Secretary, [[Henry A. Wallace]], sided with Smith and agreed to cancel the directive.<ref>Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 213</ref> As it turned out, the most effective way for Black sharecroppers to escape a life of poverty in the South was to move to the North or California.

An immediate response was a shift in the Black vote in Northern cities from the GOP to the Democrats (blacks seldom voted in the South.)<ref>Harvard Sitkoff, ''A New Deal for Blacks: The Emergence of Civil Rights as a National Issue: The Depression Decade'' (1978) ch. 3, 4 [https://www.amazon.com/New-Deal-Blacks-Emergence-Depression/dp/B005K5VYS2/ excerpt and text search].</ref> In Southern states where few Black people voted, Black leaders seized the opportunity to work inside the new federal agencies as social workers and administrators, with an eye to preparing a new generation who would become leaders of grass-roots constituencies that could be mobilized at some future date for civil rights.<ref>Karen Ferguson, ''Black Politics in New Deal Atlanta'' (2001).</ref> President [[Franklin D.

In Chicago the Black community had been a stronghold of the Republican machine, but in the Great Depression the machine fell apart. Voters and leaders moved en masse into the Democratic Party as the New Deal offered relief programs and the city Democratic machine offered suitable positions in the Democratic Party for leaders such as [[William L. Dawson (politician)|William Dawson]], who went to Congress.<ref>Christopher Robert Reed. "Black Chicago Political Realignment during the Great Depression and New Deal."

Militants demanded a federal anti-lynching bill, but President Roosevelt knew it would never pass Congress but would split his New Deal coalition.<ref>{{cite book|author=Conrad Black|title=Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion Of Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYVCi70HaigC&pg=PA437|year=2005|publisher=PublicAffairs|pages=437–438|isbn=9781586482824}}</ref> Because conservative white Southerners tended to vote as a bloc for the Democratic Party with all of the Senators and Congressmen from the South in the 1930s being Democrats, this tended to pull the national Democratic Party to the right on many issues while Southern politicians formed a powerful bloc in Congress.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 341">Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 341</ref> When a Black minister, [[Marshall L.

In November 1936, the American duo [[Buck and Bubbles]] became the first Black people to appear on television, albeit [[First day of television programmes|on a British television channel]].<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/20/obituaries/john-bubbles-the-dancer-is-dead-at-84.html |title=John Bubbles, The Dancer, Is Dead at 84 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=20 May 1986}}</ref>

In April 1937, Congressman [[Earl C. Michener]] read out on the floor of the House of Representatives an account of the [[lynching of Roosevelt Townes and Robert McDaniels]] in [[Duck Hill, Mississippi]] on 13 April 1937, describing in much detail how a white mob tied two Black men to a tree, tortured them with blowtorches, and finally killed them.<ref>Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 342</ref> Michener introduced an anti-lynching bill that passed the House, but which was stopped in the Senate as Southern senators filibustered the bill until it was withdrawn on 21 February 1938.<ref>Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 pp. 342–343</ref> Both civil rights leaders and the First Lady, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], pressed President Roosevelt to support the anti-lynching bill, but his support was half-hearted at best.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 343">Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 343</ref> Roosevelt told [[Walter Francis White]] of the NAACP that he personally supported the anti-lynching bill, but that: "I did not choose the tools with which I must work. Had I been permitted to choose them I would have selected quite different ones. But I've got to get legislation passed to save America. The Southerners by reason of the seniority rule in Congress are chairmen or occupy strategic places on most of the Senate and House committees. If I came out for the antilynching bill now, they will block every bill I ask Congress to pass to keep America from collapsing. I just can't take the risk".<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 343"/>

Through Roosevelt was sympathetic, and his wife even more so towards the plight of African-Americans, but the power of the Southern Democratic bloc in Congress, whom he did not wish to take on, limited his options.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 343"/> Through not explicitly designed to assist Black Americans, Roosevelt supported the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which imposed a national minimum wage of 40 cents per hour and a forty-hour work week while banning child labor, which was intended to assist poorer Americans.<ref>Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 pp. 344–346</ref> The Southern congressional bloc were vehemently opposed to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which they saw as an attack on the entire Southern way of life, which was based upon extremely low wages (for example the minimum wage was 50 cents per day in South Carolina), and caused some of them to break with Roosevelt.<ref>Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 pp. 345–346</ref> In 1938, Roosevelt campaigned in the Democratic primaries to defeat three conservative Southern Democratic senators, [[Walter F. George]], [[Millard Tydings]] and [[Ellison D. Smith|Ellison "Cotton Ed" Smith]], whom were all returned.<ref>Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 347</ref>  Later in 1938, the conservative Southern Democrats allied themselves with conservative Republicans, forming an alliance in Congress which sharply limited Roosevelt's ability to pass liberal legislation.<ref>Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 pp. 348–349</ref>

After Congress passed the Selective Service Act in September 1940 establishing the draft, [[A. Philip Randolph]], the president of all black [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]] union had his union issue a resolution calling for the government to desegregate the military.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 764">Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 764</ref> As the First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] had attended the meeting of the brotherhood that passed the resolution, it was widely believed that the president was supportive.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 764"/> Randolph subsequently visited the White House on 27 September 1940, where President Roosevelt seemed to be equally sympathetic.<ref>Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 764 & 766</ref> Randolph felt very betrayed where he learned the military was to remain segregated after all despite the president's warm words.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 766">Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 766</ref> Roosevelt had begun a program of rearmament, and feeling the president was not to be trusted, Randolph formed the [[March on Washington Movement]], announcing plans for a huge civil rights march in Washington DC that would demand desegregation of the military and the factories in the defense industry on 1 July 1941.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 766"/>

In June 1941 as the deadline for the march approached, Roosevelt asked for it to be cancelled, saying that 100, 000 Black people demonstrating in Washington would create problems for him.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 766"/> On 18 June 1941, Randolph met with Roosevelt with the mayor of New York, [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]] serving as a mediator, where in a compromise it was agreed that the march would be cancelled in exchange for [[Executive Order 8802]], which banned discrimination in factories making weapons for the military.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 767">Kennedy, David ''Freedom From Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 767</ref> In 1941, the Roosevelt administration, through officially neutral, was leaning in very Allied direction with the United States providing weapons to Great Britain and China (to be joined by the Soviet Union after 22 June 1941), and the president needed the co-operation of Congress as much possible, where isolationist voices were frequently heard. Roosevelt argued to Randolph that he could not antagonize the powerful bloc of conservative Southern Democrats in Congress, and desegregation of the military was out of the question as the Southern Democrats would never accept it; by contrast, as La Guardia pointed out, most of the factories in the defense industry were located in California, the Midwest and the Northeast.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 767"/>

===Cotton===
The largest group of Black people worked in the cotton farms of the Deep South as sharecroppers or tenant farmers; a few owned their farms. Large numbers of whites also were tenant farmers and [[sharecroppers]]. [[Tenant farmer|Tenant farming]] characterized the cotton and tobacco production in the post-Civil War South. As the agricultural economy plummeted in the early 1930s, all farmers in all parts of the nation were badly hurt. Worst hurt were the tenant farmers (who had relatively more control) and sharecroppers (who had less control), as well as daily laborers (mostly Black, with least control).<ref>Anthony J. Badger, ''The New Deal'' (1989), pp. 147–189.</ref>

The problem was very low prices for farm products and the New Deal solution was to raise them by cutting production. It accomplished this in the South by the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act|AAA]], which gave landowners acreage reduction contracts, by which they were paid to ''not'' grow cotton or tobacco on a portion of their land. By law, they were required to pay the tenant farmers and sharecroppers on their land a portion of the money, but some cheated on this provision, hurting their tenants and croppers. The farm wage workers who worked directly for the landowner were mostly the ones who lost their jobs. For most tenants and sharecroppers the AAA was a major help. Researchers at the time concluded, "To the extent that the AAA control-program has been responsible for the increased price [of cotton], we conclude that it has increased the amount of goods and services consumed by the cotton tenants and croppers." Furthermore, the landowners typically let their tenants and croppers use the land taken out of production for their own personal use in growing food and feed crops, which further increased their standard of living. Another consequence was that the historic high levels of turnover from year to year declined sharply, as tenants and coppers tend to stay with the same landowner. Researchers concluded, "As a rule, planters seem to prefer Negroes to whites as tenants and coppers."<ref>Fred C. Frey and T. Lynn Smith, "The Influence of the AAA Cotton Program Upon the Tenant, Cropper, and Laborer," ''Rural Sociology'' (1936), 1#4, pp. 483–505 at pp. 501, 503 [https://archive.is/20130626174638/http://chla.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=chla;idno=5075626_4287_004 online.]</ref>

Once mechanization came to cotton (after 1945), the tenants and sharecroppers were largely surplus; they moved to towns and cities.

===A call for "The Double Victory"===
The African-American newspaper [[Pittsburgh Courier|''The Pittsburgh Courier'']] called for the "double victory" or "[[Double V campaign]]" campaign in a 1942 editorial, saying that all Black people should work for "victory over our enemies at home and victory over our enemies on the battlefield abroad".<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 768">Kennedy, David ''Freedom from Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 768.</ref> The newspaper argued that a victory of the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany, would be a disaster for African-Americans while at the same time the war presented the opportunity "to persuade, embarrass, compel and shame our government and our nation...into a more enlightened attitude towards a tenth of its people".<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 768"/> The slogan of a "double victory" over fascism abroad and racism at home was widely taken up by African-Americans during the war.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 768"/>

Through the Army was reluctant to send Black units into combat, famous segregated units, such as the [[Tuskegee Airmen]] and the [[U.S. 761st Tank Battalion]] proved their value in combat.<ref>Kennedy, David ''Freedom from Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 pp. 772–773</ref> Approximately 75 percent of the soldiers who served in the European theater as truckers for the [[Red Ball Express]] and kept Allied supply lines open were African-American.<ref>Williams, Rudi.[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=43934 "African Americans Gain Fame as World War II Red Ball Express Drivers]."

The distinguished service of these units was a factor in President [[Harry S.

[[File:Rosie the Riveter (Vultee) DS.jpg|thumb|Rosie the Riveter]]
Due to massive shortages as a result of the American entry into World War II, defense employers from Northern and Western cities went to the South to convince blacks and whites there to leave the region in promise of higher wages and better opportunities. As a result, African-Americans left the South in large numbers to munitions centers in the North and West to take advantage of the shortages caused by the war, sparking the [[Second Great Migration]]. While they somewhat lived in better conditions than the South (for instance, they could vote and send children to better schools), they nevertheless faced widespread discrimination due to bigotry and fear of competition of housing and jobs among white residents.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

When Roosevelt learned that many companies in the defense industry were violating the spirit, if not the letter of Executive Order 8802 by only employing Black people in menial positions such as janitors and denying them the opportunity to work as highly paid skilled laborers, he significantly strengthened the [[Fair Employment Practice Committee]] (FEPC) with orders to fine the corporations that did not treat their Black employees equally.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 775">Kennedy, David ''Freedom from Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p. 775</ref> In 1943, Roosevelt gave the FEPC a budget of half-million dollars and replaced the unpaid volunteers who had previously staffed the FEPC with a paid staff concentrated in regional headquarters across the nation with instructions to inspect the defense industry's factories to ensure the spirit and letter of Executive Order 8802 was being obeyed.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 775"/> Roosevelt believed that having Black men and women employed in the defense industry working as skilled laborers would give them far higher wages than what they ever had before, and ultimately form the nucleus of a Black middle class.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 775"/> When the president learned that some unions were pushing for black employees to be given menial "auxiliary" jobs in the factories, he instructed the [[National Labor Relations Board]] to decertify those unions.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 775"/> In 1944, when the union for trolley drivers in Philadelphia went on strike to protest plans to hire African-Americans as trolley drivers, Roosevelt sent in troops to break the strike.<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 775"/> In 1942, Black people made up 3% of the workforce in the defense industry; by 1945 Black people made up 8% of the workforce in defense industry factories (Black people made up 10% of the population).<ref name="Kennedy, David p. 775"/>

== Second Great Migration ==
{{Main|Second Great Migration (African American)}}
The Second Great Migration was the [[Human migration|migration]] of more than 5 million African Americans from [[Southern United States|the South]] to the other three regions of the United States. It took place from 1941, through [[World War II]], and lasted until 1970.<ref name=AAME>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/topic.cfm?migration=9&topic=1|title=In Motion: African American Migration Experience, The Second Great Migration|access-date=March 18, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070416164205/http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/topic.cfm?migration=9&topic=1| archive-date=April 16, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> It was much larger and of a different character than the first [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] (1910–1940). Some historians prefer to distinguish between the movements for those reasons.

In the Second Great Migration, more than five million African Americans moved to cities in states in the Northeast, Midwest, and West, including the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where many skilled jobs in the defense industry were concentrated. More of these migrants were already urban laborers who came from the cities of the South. They were better educated and had better skills than people who did not migrate.<ref name="AAME"/>

Compared to the more rural migrants of the period 1910–40, many African Americans in the South were already living in urban areas and had urban job skills before they relocated. They moved to take jobs in the burgeoning industrial cities and especially the many jobs in the defense industry during World War II. Workers who were limited to segregated, low-skilled jobs in Southern cities were able to get highly skilled, well-paid jobs at West Coast shipyards.<ref name="AAME"/>  The effect of racially homogeneous communities composed largely of Black immigrants that formed because of spatial segregation in destination cities was that they were largely influenced by the Southern culture they brought with them. The food, music and even the discriminatory white police presence in these neighborhoods were all imported to a certain extent from the collective experiences of the highly concentrated African American migrants.<ref>Rutkoff, Peter M., and William B. Scott. ''Fly Away: The Great African American Cultural Migrations''. (Johns Hopkins UP, (2010)</ref>  Writers have often assumed that Southern migrants contributed disproportionately to changes in the African-American family in the inner city. However, census data for 1940 through 1990 show that these families actually exhibited more traditional family patterns—more children living with two parents, more ever-married women living with their spouses, and fewer never-married mothers.<ref>Stewart E.  Tolnay, "The great migration and changes in the northern black family, 1940 to 1990." ''Social Forces'' 75.4 (1997): 1213–1238. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580669 online]</ref>

By the end of the Second Great Migration, African Americans had become an urbanized population. More than 80 percent lived in cities. Fifty-three percent remained in the Southern United States, while 40 percent lived in the Northeast and North Central states and 7 percent in the West.<ref name="AAME"/>

==Civil Rights Movement==
{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] handed down a landmark decision in the case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]. This decision applied to public facilities, especially public schools. Reforms occurred slowly and only after concerted activism by African Americans. The ruling also brought new momentum to the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. [[Boycott]]s against segregated public transportation systems sprang up in the South, the most notable of which was the [[Montgomery bus boycott]].{{cn|date=August 2020}}

Civil rights groups such as the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) organized across the South with tactics such as boycotts, voter registration campaigns, [[Freedom Rides]] and other nonviolent direct action, such as marches, pickets and sit-ins to mobilize around issues of equal access and voting rights. Southern segregationists fought back to block reform. The conflict grew to involve steadily escalating physical violence, bombings and intimidation by Southern whites. Law enforcement responded to protesters with batons, electric cattle prods, fire hoses, attack dogs and mass arrests.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

In [[Virginia]], state legislators, school board members and other public officials mounted a campaign of obstructionism and outright defiance to integration called [[Massive Resistance]]. It entailed a series of actions to deny state funding to integrated schools and instead fund privately run "segregation academies" for white students. [[Farmville, Virginia]], in [[Prince Edward County, Virginia|Prince Edward County]], was one of the plaintiff African-American communities involved in the 1954 ''Brown v. Board of Education'' Supreme Court decision. As a last-ditch effort to avoid court-ordered desegregation, officials in the county shut down the county's entire public school system in 1959 and it remained closed for five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercyseatfilms.com/filmcredits.html|title=Mercy Seat Films – 'THEY CLOSED OUR SCHOOLS' – Film Credits|website=Mercyseatfilms.com|access-date=28 August 2017}}</ref> White students were able to attend private schools established by the community for the sole purpose of circumventing integration. The largely Black rural population of the county had little recourse.  Some families were split up as parents sent their children to live with relatives in other locales to attend public school; but the majority of Prince Edward's more than 2,000 black children, as well as many poor whites, simply remained unschooled until federal court action forced the schools to reopen five years later.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] delivers his famous "[[I have a dream|I Have a Dream]]" speech during the March on Washington]]
Perhaps the high point of the Civil Rights Movement was the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which brought more than 250,000 marchers to the grounds of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], to speak out for an end to southern racial violence and police brutality, equal opportunity in employment, equal access in education and public accommodations. The organizers of the march were called the "[[Big Six (activists)|Big Six]]" of the Civil Rights Movement: [[Bayard Rustin]] the strategist who has been called the "invisible man" of the Civil Rights Movement; labor organizer and initiator of the march, A. Phillip Randolph; [[Roy Wilkins]] of the NAACP; [[Whitney Young|Whitney Young, Jr.]], of the [[National Urban League]]; [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC); [[James Farmer]] of the [[Congress on Racial Equality]] (CORE); and [[John Lewis]] of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). Also active behind the scenes and sharing the podium with Dr. King was [[Dorothy Height]], head of the [[National Council of Negro Women]]. It was at this event, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, that King delivered his historic "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

This march, the 1963 [[Birmingham campaign|Birmingham Children's Crusade]], and other events were credited with putting pressure on President [[John F. Kennedy]], and then [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], that culminated in the passage the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg|thumb|250px|right|President Johnson signs the historic [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].]]
The "Mississippi Freedom Summer" of 1964 brought thousands of idealistic youth, black and white, to the state to run "freedom schools", to teach basic literacy, history and civics. Other volunteers were involved in voter registration drives. The season was marked by harassment, intimidation and violence directed at civil rights workers and their host families. The disappearance of three youths, [[James Chaney]], [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner]] in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], captured the attention of the nation. Six weeks later, searchers found the savagely beaten body of Chaney, a Black man, in a muddy dam alongside the remains of his two white companions, who had been shot to death. There was national outrage at the escalating injustices of the "Mississippi Blood Summer", as it by then had come to be known, and at the brutality of the murders.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

In 1965 the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma Voting Rights Movement]], its [[Selma to Montgomery marches]], and the tragic murders of two activists associated with the march, inspired President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to call for the full [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which struck down barriers to black enfranchisement. In 1966 the [[Chicago Open Housing Movement]], followed by the passage of the [[1968 Civil Rights Act|1968 Fair Housing Act]], was a capstone to more than a decade of major legislation during the civil rights movement.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

By this time, African Americans who questioned the effectiveness of nonviolent protest had gained a greater voice. More militant Black leaders, such as [[Malcolm X]] of the [[Nation of Islam]] and [[Eldridge Cleaver]] of the [[Black Panther Party]], called for Black people to defend themselves, using violence, if necessary. From the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, the [[Black Power]] movement urged African Americans to look to Africa for inspiration and emphasized Black solidarity, rather than integration.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

==Post Civil Rights era of African-American history==
{{Main|Post-Civil Rights era in African-American history}}
{{Further|Black flight|New Great Migration|Black Lives Matter}}
[[File:Official portrait of Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|right|The first [[African-American]] [[President of the United States]], [[Barack Obama]]]]
Politically and economically, Black people have made substantial strides in the post-civil rights era. Civil rights leader [[Jesse Jackson]], who ran for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, brought unprecedented support and leverage to Black people in politics.

In 1989, [[Douglas Wilder]] became the first African-American elected governor in U.S. history. In 1992 [[Carol Moseley-Braun]] of [[Illinois]] became the first Black woman elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. There were 8,936 Black officeholders in the United States in 2000, showing a net increase of 7,467 since 1970. In 2001 there were 484 Black mayors.

The 39 African-American members of Congress form the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], which serves as a political bloc for issues relating to African Americans. The appointment of Black people to high federal offices—including General [[Colin Powell]], Chairman of the U.S. Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1989–93, [[United States Secretary of State]], 2001–05; [[Condoleezza Rice]], Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, 2001–04, Secretary of State in, 2005–09; [[Ron Brown]], [[United States Secretary of Commerce]], 1993–96; and Supreme Court justices [[Thurgood Marshall]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]—also demonstrates the increasing visibility of Black people in the political arena.

Economic progress for Black people reaching the extremes of wealth has been slow. According to Forbes richest lists, [[Oprah Winfrey]] was the richest African American of the 20th century and has been the world's only [[black billionaires|Black billionaire]] in 2004, 2005, and 2006.<ref>Roy Douglas Malonson, [http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-05-10/publisher.htm "Condi and Oprah aren’t good role models for Black motherhood"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520021215/http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-05-10/publisher.htm |date=2006-05-20 }}. ''African-American News&Issues: Publisher's Analysis''. Retrieved 19 September 2013</ref> Not only was Winfrey the world's only Black billionaire but she has been the only Black person on the [[Forbes 400]] list nearly every year since 1995. [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] founder [[Robert L. Johnson|Bob Johnson]]  briefly joined her on the list from 2001 to 2003 before his ex-wife acquired part of his fortune; although he returned to the list in 2006, he did not make it in 2007. With Winfrey the only African American wealthy enough to rank among America's 400 richest people,<ref>[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070920/apfn_forbes_400_alphabetical_list.html]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Black people currently comprise 0.25% of America's economic elite and comprise 13% of the U.S. population.

The dramatic political breakthrough came in the 2008 election, with the election of [[Barack Obama]], the son of a Black Kenyan father and a white American mother. He won overwhelming support from African-American voters in the Democratic primaries, even as his main opponent Hillary Clinton had the support of many Black politicians. African Americans continued to support Obama throughout his term.<ref>Shayla C. Nunnally, "African American Perspectives on the Obama Presidency," in William Crotty, ed. ''The Obama Presidency: Promise and Performance'' (2012), pp. 127–150.</ref> After completing his first term, Obama ran for a second term. In 2012, he won the presidential election against candidate [[Mitt Romney]] and was re-elected as the president of the United States.

The post-civil rights era is also notable for the [[New Great Migration]], in which millions of African Americans have returned to the South including [[Texas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]] and [[North Carolina]], often to pursue increased economic opportunities in now-desegregated southern cities.

On August 11, 2020, [[Kamala Harris|Senator Kamala Harris]] (D-CA) was announced as the first African-American woman to run for vice-president on a major party presidential ticket.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Glueck |first1=Katie |last2=Burns |first2=Alexander |title=Kamala Harris Is Biden's Choice for Vice President |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/us/politics/kamala-harris-vp-biden.html |access-date=12 August 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=11 August 2020}}</ref>

===Social issues===
After the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gains of the 1950s–1970s, due to government neglect, unfavorable social policies, high [[poverty in the United States|poverty rates]], changes implemented in the [[criminal justice]] system and laws, and a breakdown in traditional family units, African-American communities have been suffering from extremely high [[incarceration in the United States|incarceration rates]].

==Historiography==
The history of slavery has always been a major research topic for white scholars, but until the 1950s they generally focused on the political and constitutional themes as debated by white politicians; they did not study the lives of the enslaved Black people. During [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] and the late 19th century, Black people became major actors in the South. The [[Dunning School]] of white scholars generally cast Black people as pawns of white Carpetbaggers during this period, but [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], a Black historian, and [[Ulrich B. Phillips]], a white historian, studied the African-American experience in depth. Du Bois' study of Reconstruction provided a more objective context for evaluating its achievements and weaknesses; in addition, he did studies of contemporary Black life. Phillips set the main topics of inquiry that still guide the analysis of slave economics.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

During the first half of the 20th century, [[Carter G. Woodson]] was the major Black scholar studying and promoting the Black historical experience. Woodson insisted that the study of African descendants be scholarly sound, creative, restorative, and, most important, directly relevant to the Black community. He popularized Black history with a variety of innovative strategies, including Association for the Study of Negro Life outreach activities, Negro History Week (now [[Black History Month]], in February), and a popular Black history magazine. Woodson democratized, legitimized, and popularized Black history.<ref>Pero Gaglo Dagbovie, "Making Black History Practical and Popular: Carter G. Woodson, the Proto Black Studies Movement, and the Struggle for Black Liberation." ''Western Journal of Black Studies'' 2004 28(2): 372–383. {{ISSN|0197-4327}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]</ref>

[[Benjamin Quarles]] (1904–1996) had a significant impact on the teaching of African-American history. Quarles and [[John Hope Franklin]] provided a bridge between the work of historians in [[historically black colleges|historically Black colleges]], such as Woodson, and the Black history that is now well established in mainline universities. Quarles grew up in Boston, attended [[Shaw University]] as an undergraduate, and received a graduate degree at the [[University of Wisconsin]]. He began in 1953 teaching at [[Morgan State College]] in Baltimore, where he stayed, despite a lucrative offer from [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Quarles' books included ''The Negro in the American Revolution'' (1961), ''Black Abolitionists'' (1969), ''The Negro in the Civil War'' (1953), and ''Lincoln and the Negro'' (1962), which were narrative accounts of critical wartime episodes that focused on how Black people interacted with their white allies.<ref>Meier, August, "Benjamin Quarles and the Historiography of Black America," ''Civil War History,'' June 1980, Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 101–116.</ref>

Black history attempted to reverse centuries of ignorance. While Black historians were not alone in advocating a new examination of slavery and racism in the United States, the study of African-American history has often been a political and scholarly struggle to change assumptions. One of the foremost assumptions was that enslaved people were passive and did not rebel. A series of historians transformed the image of African Americans, revealing a much richer and complex experience. Historians such as [[Leon F. Litwack]] showed how former enslaved people fought to keep their families together and struggled against tremendous odds to define themselves as free people. Others wrote of rebellions small and large.

In the 21st century, Black history is regarded as mainstream.  Since proclamation by President [[Jimmy Carter]], it is celebrated every February in the United States during "Black History Month." Proponents of Black history believe that it promotes diversity, develops self-esteem, and corrects myths and stereotypes. Opponents argue such curricula are dishonest, divisive, and lack academic credibility and rigor.<ref>Abul Pitre and Ruth Ray, "The Controversy Around Black History," ''Western Journal of Black Studies'' 2002 26(3): 149–154. {{ISSN|0197-4327}} Fulltext: Ebsco.</ref>

===Knowledge of Black history===
Surveys of 11th and 12th-grade students and adults in 2005 show that American schools have given students an awareness of some famous figures in Black history.  Both groups were asked to name 10 famous Americans, excluding presidents. Of those named, the three most mentioned were Black: 67% named Martin Luther King Jr., 60% Rosa Parks, and 44% Harriet Tubman. Among adults, King was second (at 36%) and Parks was tied for fourth with 30%, while Tubman tied for 10th place with Henry Ford, at 16%. When distinguished historians were asked in 2006 to name the most prominent Americans, Parks and Tubman did not make the top 100.<ref>Sam Wineburg and Chauncey Monte-Sano, "'Famous Americans': The Changing Pantheon of American Heroes," ''Journal of American History'' (March 2008), 94#4, pp. 1186–1202.</ref>
