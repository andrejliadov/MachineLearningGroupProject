In 2014, interest in [[Lilias Adie]]'s story encouraged Yeoman and Douglas Speirs, an archaeologist at [[Fife Council]], to look for her burial site. Using 19th-century historical documents, they found a seaweed-covered slab of stone exactly where the documents described: in a group of rocks near the Torryburn railway bridge lay "the great stone doorstep that lies over the rifled grave of Lilly Eadie", and a rock with "the remains of an iron ring".<ref>{{Cite news|date=2014-10-28|title=How to bury a witch|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-29689688|access-date=2020-12-04}}</ref>

Yeoman is now a producer and presenter at [[BBC Radio Scotland]], where she works on programmes including Time Travels<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Time Travels|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b094d4hl|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-12-04|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and the Witch Hunt podcast series with [[Susan Morrison]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Witch Hunt|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07rn38z|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-12-04|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> She has spoken out about the courage of accused Scottish witches such as Adie.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dundee|first=University of|title=Face Of 313 Year Old Witch Reconstructed : News|url=https://www.dundee.ac.uk/news/2017/face-of-313-year-old-witch-reconstructed.php|access-date=2020-12-04|website=University of Dundee|language=en}}</ref> 

Yeoman has spoken out in support of Scotland acknowledging the women killed as accused witches: “Do I think there should be a national statement that we think the witch hunt was wrong and we are sorry? Yes. Do I think there should be a national memorial? Yes, and local memorials.”<ref>{{Cite web|last=Peebles|first=Cheryl|title=Torryburn witch Lilias Adie honoured in village of her persecution|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/fife/969449/torryburn-witch-lilias-adie-honoured-in-village-of-her-persecution/|access-date=2020-12-04|website=The Courier|language=en-GB}}</ref>
