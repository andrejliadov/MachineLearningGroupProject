'''Historical demography''' is the [[quantitative study]] of [[human population]] in the past. It is concerned with population size, with the three basic components of population change--[[fertility]], [[Mortality rate|mortality]], and  [[Human migration|migration]], and with population characteristics related to those components, such as marriage, [[socioeconomic status]], and the configuration of families.

==Sources==
The sources of historical demography vary according to the period and topics of the study.

For the recent period - beginning in the early nineteenth century in most European countries, and later in the rest of the world - historical demographers make use of data collected by governments, including [[census]]es and [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]].<ref name="EoPH">[http://www.answers.com/topic/historical-demography Historical Demography] in [[Encyclopedia of Public Health]], Retrieved on 3 May 2005</ref>

In the early modern period, historical demographers rely heavily on ecclesiastical records of baptisms, marriages, and burials, using methods developed by French historian [[Louis Henry]], as well as hearth and poll tax records.

For population size, sources can also include the size of cities and towns, the size and density of smaller settlements, relying on [[field survey]] techniques, the presence or absence of agriculture on [[marginal land]], and inferences from historical records. For population health and life expectancy, [[paleodemography]], based on the study of skeletal remains, is another important approach for populations that precede the modern era, as is the study of ages of death recorded on funerary monuments.

The PUMS (Public User Microdata Samples) data set allows researchers to analyze contemporary and historical data sets.<ref>Sylvia Andrews, "Public User Microdata Samples (PUMS): Do-lt-Yourself Census Data." ''Indiana Libraries'' (2014) 13#2 pp: 19-26. [https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/IndianaLibraries/article/viewFile/16733/pdf_198 Online]</ref>

==Development of  techniques==
Historical analysis has played a central role in the study of population, from [[Thomas Malthus]] in the eighteenth century to major twentieth-century demographers such as [[Ansley Coale]] and [[Samuel H. Preston]]. The French historian [[Louis Henry]] (1911-1991) was chiefly responsible for the development of historical demography as a distinct subfield of demography.<ref name="Rosental">Paul-André Rosental, [http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=POPE&ID_NUMPUBLIE=POPE_301&ID_ARTICLE=POPE_301_0097 The Novelty of an Old Genre: Louis Henry and the Founding of Historical Demography], ''Population'' (English edition), Volume 58 –2003/1, Retrieved on 3 May 2007</ref> In recent years, new research in historical demography has proliferated owing to the development of massive new population data collections, including the Demographic Data Base in Umeå, Sweden,<ref>http://www.ddb.umu.se/index_eng.html, Retrieved on 3 June 2009</ref> the Historical Sample of the Netherlands,<ref>http://www.iisg.nl/hsn/, Retrieved on 3 June 2009</ref> and the [[Integrated Public Use Microdata Series]] (IPUMS).

According to Willigan and Lynch, the main sources used by demographic historians include archaeological methods, parish registers starting about 1500 in Europe, civil registration records, enumerations, national [[census]] beginning about 1800, genealogies and family reconstruction studies, population registers,<ref>Susan Cotts Watkins and Myron P. Gutmann. "Methodological issues in the use of population registers for fertility analysis." ''Historical Methods: A Journal of Quantitative and Interdisciplinary History'' (1983) 16#3: 109-120.</ref> and organizational and institutional records.  Statistical methods have included model life tables, [[time series]] analysis, event history analysis, [[causal model]] building and hypothesis testing, As well as theories of the demographic transition and the epidemiological transition.<ref>Willigan and  Lynch, ''Sources and methods of historical demography'' (1982)</ref><ref>David S. Reher, and Roger Schofield. ''Old and new methods in historical demography'' (Clarendon Press 1993), 426 pp.</ref>
