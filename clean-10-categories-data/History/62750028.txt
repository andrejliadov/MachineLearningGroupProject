'''Ainu Revolution Theory''' ({{lang-ja|アイヌ革命論}}, ''Ainu Kakumeiron'') is a left-wing political idea in [[Japan]] that was active in the 1970s. It was a variant of [[Proletarian Revolution Theory]] that came to light shortly after the revision of the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan]], focusing on the [[Ainu people|Ainu]]. The actions and writings of Japanese left-wing thinker [[Ota Ryu]] in particular made Ainu Revolution Theory well known.

== History ==
In the early 1970s, a certain tendency of [[Zenkyoto]] groups and the [[Zengakuren]] began to emerge among other [[New Left]] activists in reaction to the stalemate of the All-Campus Joint Struggle League Movement (Zenkyoto). They believed that the [[lumpenproletariat]] could be the main body of the revolution, and that the Ainu people of Japan were also included inside this group. They believed that the Ainu people lived in a primitive communist system and were deemed worthy of being the "leaders of the Communist revolution".<ref>Ota, Ryu. ''Ainu Revolution: "Retreat" to the Yucala World''. Ainu Republic Information Department (Shinsensha), 1973. ASIN 72006019</ref>

In the mid-1970s, a number of violent incidents that appeared to have been influenced by the Ainu Revolution Theory occurred in various parts of the country (mainly in [[Hokkaido]]), such as the [[Shakushain Statue Incident]], the [[Bombing of the Fusetsu no Gunzo and Institute of Northern Cultures]], the [[Attack on the Mayor of Shiraoi]], the [[Hokkaido Shrine Arson Incident]], the [[Bombing of Hokkaido Police Headquarters]], the [[Hokkaido government bombings]], and the [[Bombing of Higashi Honganji]]. However, many of these incidents were carried out by the wider Japanese [[New Left]].<ref>Tachibana, Shobo. ''40-year History of Extremist Case Studies''.

The Ainu people's own ethnic movements, such as the ''Removal of the [[Old Earth Protection Law of Hokkaido]]'' movement, became active in the 1970s, but the development of Ainu Revolution Theory was not related to these movements. Ota Ryu was criticized for appropriating these movements. The Ainu Revolution discourse within leftist circles in Japan criticized Ota, saying that "by making the Ainu into the stock of the revolutionary movement, you are bothering them."<ref name = encyclopedia/>

Ainu political activists [[Shoji Yuki (activist)|Shoji Yuki]] and [[Kazuaki Yamamoto]], along with others, formed the [[Ainu Liberation Alliance]] in 1972, challenging Japanese policy on the Ainu and public perception of the Ainu people. The [[Sapporo Olympics]] held in 1972 helped inspire militants to become more active in Hokkaido. Yuki became acquainted with Ota around 1972, accompanying him when he read out a public questionnaire at the [[Japanese Anthropological and Ethnic Association Congress]] at [[Sapporo Medical University]]. Yuki later criticized that Ota's Ainu Revolution Theory was inconsistent with Ainu beliefs and circumstances. After both were arrested in 1974 for inciting riots ([[Nolle prosequi]]), Ota and Yuki mutually criticized each other, with Ota being insulted and isolated.<ref>Winchester, Mark.

Eventually, Ota's decline, conversion to becoming an ecologist, and subscription to conspiracy theories led to a rapid decline in the popularity of Ainu Revolution Theory.<ref name = encyclopedia>Editorial Committee of the Post-war Revolutionary Movement Encyclopedia (eds.)
