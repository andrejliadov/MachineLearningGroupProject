The '''''Annales Petaviani''''' (''AP'') is one of the so-called "minor annals group", three related ''[[Reichsannalen]]'', year-by-year histories of the [[Carolingian empire]] composed in [[Middle Latin|Latin]].<ref>The others are the ''[[Annales sancti Amandi]]'', ''[[Annales laubacenses]]'', and ''[[Annales tiliani]]''.</ref> They are named after the former owner of the manuscript, the French Jesuit [[Denis Pétau]] (1583–1652), whose name, in Latin, is Dionysius Petavius. The standard [[critical edition]] of the ''Annales'' is that of [[Georg Pertz]] in the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]''.

The first entry in the ''Annales Petaviani'' is for the year 687 and records the [[Battle of Tertry]]. There is then a gap until 708, when the annals begin again and continue to 799 in chronological order. Those entries through to 771 were compiled from earlier annals, such as the ''Annales sancti Amandi'' and the ''[[Annales mosellani]]'', and do not comprise an independent source. Together with the ''Annales sancti Amandi'', the ''Annales Petaviani'' are the primary source of the entries for 741–88 in the ''[[Annales laurissenses maiores]]''. Both of these may have been based on an earlier exemplar originally compiled contemporaneously with events at the convent of [[Great St. Martin Church|Sankt Martin]] in [[Cologne]]. For the years 771–99 the ''Annales Petaviani'' are an independent and contemporary source.

They are the only source to date [[Charlemagne]]'s birth to 747. They are also the only source to name either of [[Carloman I]]'s two known sons, who fled to Italy with his widow in 771. The one born towards 770, whom [[Pope Stephen III]] offered to baptise himself, was named Pepin. Carloman's widow, Gisela, is also named in only one source: the ''[[Annales mettenses priores]]''. The ''Annales Petaviani'' also provide a unique explanation for the retirement of Carloman's uncle and namesake, [[Carloman, son of Charles Martel]], who entered the [[Abbey of Montecassino]] in 747, leaving power in the hands of his brother, [[Pepin the Short]]. The ''Annales'' claim that Carloman's conversion to the religious life came about because his conscience was unsettled by his defeat in [[Alemannia]], where he lost thousands of men: ''Karolomannus intravit Alamanniam ubi fertur quod multa hominum millia ceciderit. Unde compunctus regnum reliquit'' ("Carloman entered Alemannia where it is said that many thousands of men died. In remorse he relinquished the kingdom"). The ''Annales'' also provide evidence of an [[Anglo-Saxon]] presence in [[Marseille]], the great seaport of [[Merovingian]] [[Francia|Gaul]], when they note under the year 790 the death of the son of Botto, an English ''negotiator'' in Marseille.
