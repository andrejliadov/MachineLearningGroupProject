The mission of the '''Bay Area Holocaust Oral History Project''' (BAHOHP) is to gather oral life histories of [[Holocaust survivors]], liberators, rescuers, and eyewitnesses. The project is developing and maintaining a catalogue database for public use. Their goal is to provide students,<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.scu.edu/news/releases/release.cfm?month=1100&story=holocaust Santa Clara University Press Releases - SCU Remembers the Holocaust]</ref> scholars,<ref name=autogenerated2 /> resource centers on the world, and the general public access to their archives.<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www.bahohp.org/aboutus/index.htm Bay Area Holocaust Oral History Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224115831/http://www.bahohp.org/aboutus/index.htm |date=February 24, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.ushmm.org/research/library/weblinks/index.php?content=oral_history USHMM Research ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223162841/http://www.ushmm.org/research/library/weblinks/index.php?content=oral_history |date=February 23, 2007 }}</ref><ref>UK,{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/collections/sound-archive/ohlinks.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202210205/http://www.bl.uk/collections/sound-archive/ohlinks.html |archivedate=2007-02-02 }}</ref>

BAHOHP seeks to counteract [[Holocaust denial]], and believes that the alarming upsurge of [[hate crimes]] and [[Toleration|intolerance]] makes the need to record these stories all the more urgent. The Oral History Project regards recorded personal testimony as a powerful [[antidote]] for Holocaust denial.<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref>[http://www.history.ucsb.edu/projects/holocaust/Research/VariousPapers/MonizDeniers034.htm S.

BAHOHP recently merged with the [[Holocaust Center of Northern California]] (HCNC) to form a single organization under the HCNC name.  This new organization creates a central resource in Northern California for Holocaust education and remembrance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hcnc.org/oralhistory/announcement.html |title=Holocaust Center of Northern California<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018043654/http://www.hcnc.org/oralhistory/announcement.html |archive-date=2007-10-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Interviews==
BAHOHP gathers a complete life story of the interviewee, focusing on details surrounding the Holocaust. The questions will vary according to the specific experiences of each individual.  The interviewer has an advanced degree in psychology or social work and experience conducting survivor interviews.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.bahohp.org/aboutus/methods.htm BAHOHP: About us<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404181951/http://www.bahohp.org/aboutus/methods.htm |date=April 4, 2007 }}</ref>

BAHOHP keeps a copy of each tape and sends the master and a duplicate copy to the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in Washington, D.C. In addition, the interviewee is given a copy of his or her interview at the conclusion of the taping.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> R.
