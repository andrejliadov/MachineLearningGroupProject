'''Etienne Leopold Mourier''', Legion d'Honor (1862–1923) was a French chef, restaurateur, gastronome, and philanthropist.

His greatest gastronomic claim to fame is the creation of [[Lobster Thermidor]] in 1891.

==Life==
He was born on 30 May 1862 in the village of Montjoux near [[Dieulefit]], the son of Jean-Etienne Mourier (1836–1865), an innkeeper, and his wife, Clarice Ernestine Turc. Leopold had a twin brother: Louis Ernest Mourier. Their father died the year of his birth. His mother then ran the Auberge "Serre du Turc", which specialized in fine foods.<ref name="appl-lachaise">{{cite web|url=https://www.appl-lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=5945|website=appl-lachaise.net|title=MOURIER Léopold (1862-1923)|accessdate=2019-09-02}}</ref>

From around 1875 he was apprenticed as a chef with the Campe brothers in [[Avignon]] then around 1877 joined his cousin Ms Rivier who was a chef in [[Grenoble]].<ref name="appl-lachaise"/>

In the summer of 1880 he obtained exemption from military service at went to work at the "Notta" restaurant in [[Paris]].<ref name="cuisiniersdefrance">{{cite web|url=https://cuisiniersdefrance.fr/lassociation/leopold-mourier/|title=Léopold Mourier &#8211; Les Cuisiniers de France|website=cuisiniersdefrance.fr|accessdate=2019-09-02}}</ref>

In 1883 he moved to the "Maison Maire" restaurant in Paris and became its main chef in 1886. The restaurant was owned by Ms Paillard and stood on Chaussée d'Antin. Some records state that the illustrious [[Auguste Escoffier]] worked at the "Maison Maire" until he went to Monte Carlo in 1884. At the Maire, Mourier created "Pommes Mayor" and "Pommes Ernestine" (named after his mother). In 1890 he succeeded [[Foyot sauce|Nicolas Foyot]] as the premiere chef in [[Paris]].<ref name="google">{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/livrescuisinehistoire/Home/personnages-celebres-par-siecle/personnages-celebres-au-19eme-siecle/leopold-mourier---1923|title=Léopold Mourier ? - 1923 - Livres Cuisine Recettes Histoire|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=2019-09-02}}</ref> He acquired the Foyot restaurant in 1891 and the famous Cafe de Paris on the Avenue de l'Opera soon after.<ref name="appl-lachaise"/>

In 1891, at the launch of the controversial play ''Thermidor'', he created [[Lobster Thermidor]] for the cast. Some records link this creation to Escoffier, but Escoffier was not in Paris at this time and the creation was certainly born in Paris. The play was banned for 5 years and relaunched in 1896, by which time the dish was well-established.<ref>50 Greatest Dishes of the World: James steen</ref>

In 1900 he became owner and chef of the Pavillon d'Armenonville in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in [[Paris]]: a magnificent building set on a lake in the wood, which he also made his home. From the same time he was asked to create many huge banquets, set in the [[Elysee Palace]]. In 1908 opened the "Pre-Catalan". In 1904 he was the first chef to be awarded the [[Legion of Honour|Legion d'Honour]] by the French government for services to cooking.<ref name="cuisiniersdefrance"/>

In 1910 he opened the "Fouquet" restaurant on a prominent corner on the [[Champs Elysees]]. This restaurant is still (2019) operational.<ref name="lafourchette">{{cite web|url=https://www.lafourchette.com/restaurant/fouquet-s-paris/3212?cc=16767-0cd&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2K3rBRDiARIsAOFSW_5H_5R3cfw_s9UuByiryEKNtJNHxf3tHQFspTehV9SnK71yhic9X1gaAqxuEALw_wcB|title=Restaurant Fouquet's Paris à Paris (75008), Champs-Elysées - Menu, avis, prix et réservation|website=lafourchette.com|accessdate=2019-09-02}}</ref>

His great wealth allowed him to create a retirement home for chefs (who often were so dedicated that they had no family). This is situated in [[Cormeilles-en-Parisis]]. In 1912, in his role as President of the Societé des Cuisiniers de Paris, with Francis Carton as manager, he began many projects, including purchasing a six-storey building at 45 Rue Saint Roch that became the society's headquarters under the name of the "Maison des Cuisiniers". In 1913 he provided a relief fund and free health care for impoverished chefs.

He also gave generously to his home town of [[Montjoux]], allowing it to expand.

He died in the Pavillon d'Armenonville on 17 March 1923 and was buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in north-east [[Paris]]. The grave lies on the main north path. Having no family, the magnificent grave was erected by his friends.<ref name="geneanet">{{cite web|url=https://gw.geneanet.org/annemarie5?lang=fr&n=mourier&oc=0&p=etienne+leopold|title=Etienne Léopold MOURIER : généalogie par Anne Marie GIRAUD|website=Geneanet|accessdate=2019-09-02}}</ref> His huge estate was left to the Societé des Cuisiniers.

His successor, Tony Girod, continued to create Lobster Thermidor.
