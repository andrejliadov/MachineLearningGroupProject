'''Alain Leroy Locke''' (September 13, 1885 – June 9, 1954) was an [[United States|American]] [[writer]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], educator, and patron of the arts. Distinguished in 1907 as the first African-American [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]], Locke became known as the philosophical architect —the acknowledged "Dean"— of the [[Harlem Renaissance]].<ref name=Kirsch>{{cite web |author-link=Adam Kirsch |first=Adam |last=Kirsch |title=Art and Activism: Rediscovering Alain Locke and the project of black self-realization |work=[[Harvard Magazine]] |date=March–April 2018 |url=https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2018/03/alain-locke-the-new-negro |access-date=2020-03-06}} review of Jeffrey C.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Portrait of Alain LeRoy Locke.jpg|thumb|Alain LeRoy Locke, c.1907]]
He was born Arthur Leroy Locke in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], on September 13, 1885<ref name="buck">Note: Locke always gave his year of birth as "1886", and many sources give 1886. He was, however, born in 1885. A note by Locke in the Alain Locke Papers (archived at [[Howard University]]), discovered by Christopher Buck, says why Locke represented the year of his birth as 1886 rather than 1885: "In the Alain Locke Papers, there is a note in Locke's handwriting that reads: 'Alain Leroy Locke[:] Alan registered as Arthur (white Phila Vital Statistics owing prejudice of Quaker physician Isaac Smedley to answering question of race. [B]orn 13 So. 19th Street, Philadelphia, Pa. Sunday between 10 and 11 A.M. September 13, 1885. Called Roy as a child[.] Alain from 16 on. [illegible] First born son. 2nd brother born 1889—lived 2 months. Named Arthur first selected for me.' ... As to why he represented his year of birth as 1886 rather than 1885, Locke may have wanted to avoid the embarrassment of having future biographers discover that he was registered as white on his birth certificate." Buck, Christopher. [https://bahai-library.com/buck_locke_faith_philosophy Alain Locke – Faith and Philosophy]," ''Studies in Bábí and Baháʼí Religions,'' Vol 18, Anthony A. Lee General Editor, pp.&nbsp;11–12 – {{ISBN|978-1-890688-38-7}}</ref> to parents Pliny Ishmael Locke (1850–1892) and Mary (née Hawkins) Locke (1853–1922), both of whom were descended from [[Black elite#United States|prominent families of free blacks]]. Called "Roy" as a boy, he was their only child. His father was the first black employee of the [[U.S. Postal Service]], and his paternal grandfather taught at Philadelphia's [[Institute for Colored Youth]]. His mother Mary was a teacher and inspired Locke's passion for education and literature. Mary's grandfather, Charles Shorter, fought as a soldier and was a hero in the [[War of 1812]].<ref name=Kirsch/><ref>Stewart, p. 16</ref>

At the age of 16, Locke chose to use the first name of "Alain".<ref name="buck"/> In 1902, Locke graduated from [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]] in [[Philadelphia]], second in his class in the academic institution. He also attended [[Philadelphia School of Pedagogy]].<ref>Gates, Lacey.

Retrieved October 10, 2008.</ref>

In 1907, Locke graduated from [[Harvard University]] with degrees in English and philosophy; he was honored as a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] and recipient of the [[Bowdoin prize]].<ref name="Buck64" /> That year he was the first African American to be selected as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] (and the last to be selected until 1963, when [[John Edgar Wideman]] and [[John Stanley Sanders]], a future notable writer and politician, respectively, were selected). In the early 20th century, Rhodes selectors did not meet candidates in person, but there is evidence that at least some selectors knew that Locke was African-American.<ref name="congressionalburial">{{Cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/the-60-year-journey-of-the-ashes-of-alain-locke-father-of-the-harlem-renaissance/2014/09/11/2ea31ccc-2878-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html|title = The 60-year journey of the ashes of Alain Locke, father of the Harlem Renaissance|last = Sellers|first = Frances Stead|date = Sep 12, 2014|access-date = Sep 12, 2014|newspaper = Washington Post Magazine}}</ref> On arriving at Oxford, Locke was denied admission to several colleges. Several American Rhodes Scholars from the South refused to live in the same college or attend events with Locke.<ref name="Buck64" /><ref name="congressionalburial" /> He was finally admitted to [[Hertford College]], where he studied literature, philosophy, Greek, and Latin, from 1907–1910. Alongside his friend and fellow student [[Pixley ka Isaka Seme]], he was part of the Oxford Cosmopolitan Club, contributing to its first publication.<ref>{{Cite web|title=How They Lived|url=https://makinghistory.magd.ox.ac.uk/how-they-lived/|access-date=2020-09-02|website=Making History|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1910, he attended the [[University of Berlin]], where he studied philosophy.

Locke wrote from Oxford in 1910 that the "primary aim and obligation" of a [[Rhodes Scholar]] 
<blockquote>"is to acquire at Oxford and abroad generally a [[liberal education]], and to continue subsequently the [[Cecil Rhodes|Rhodes]] mission [of international understanding] throughout life and in his own country. If once more it should prove impossible for nations to understand one another as nations, then, as [[Goethe]] said, they must learn [[toleration|to tolerate]] each other as individuals".<ref>Locke, as quoted from [[Donald Markwell]] (2013), ''"Instincts to Lead": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'', Connor Court.

== Teaching and scholarship ==
Locke received an [[assistant professor]]ship in English at [[Howard University]] in 1912.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.founders.howard.edu/Locke.htm|title = Alain Leroy Locke Bibliography|date = 1998|accessdate = Sep 14, 2014|publisher = Howard University Library System|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140820145006/http://www.founders.howard.edu/Locke.htm|archive-date = August 20, 2014|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref> While at Howard, he became a member of [[Phi Beta Sigma]] fraternity.

Locke returned to Harvard in 1916 to work on his doctoral dissertation, ''The Problem of Classification in the Theory of Value''. In his thesis, he discusses the causes of opinions and social biases, and that these are not objectively true or false, and therefore not universal. Locke received his PhD in philosophy in 1918.

Locke returned to Howard University as the chair of the department of philosophy. During this period, he began teaching the first classes on race relations. After working to gain equal pay for African-American and white faculty at the university, he was dismissed in 1925.<ref name=":1" />

Following the appointment in 1926 of [[Mordecai W. Johnson]], the first African-American president of Howard, Locke was reinstated in 1928 at the university. Beginning in 1935, he returned to philosophy as a topic of his writing.<ref name="stanford"/> He continued to teach generations of students at Howard until he retired in 1953. Locke Hall, on the Howard campus, is named in his honor. Among his prominent former students is actor [[Ossie Davis]], who said that Locke encouraged him to go to Harlem because of his interest in theatre. And he did.

In addition to teaching philosophy, Locke promoted African-American artists, writers, and musicians. He encouraged them to explore Africa and its many cultures as inspiration for their works. He encouraged them to depict African and African-American subjects, and to draw on their history for subject material. The library resources built up by [[Dorothy B. Porter]] to support these studies included materials which he donated from his travels and contacts.<ref name="Perspective-on-History">{{cite journal |last1=Nunes |first1=Zita Cristina |title=Cataloging Black Knowledge: How Dorothy Porter Assembled and Organized a Premier Africana Research Collection |journal=Perspectives on History |date=20 November 2018 |url=https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2018/cataloging-black-knowledge-how-dorothy-porter-assembled-and-organized-a-premier-africana-research-collection |access-date=24 November 2018}}</ref>

== Harlem Renaissance and the "New Negro" ==
Locke was the guest editor of the March 1925 issue of the periodical ''[[Survey Graphic]]'', for a special edition titled "Harlem, Mecca of the New Negro":  about Harlem and the Harlem Renaissance, which helped educate white readers about its flourishing culture.<ref>Appel, JM. ''St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture'', May 2, 2009. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200740/ Locke biography]</ref> In December of that year, he expanded the issue into ''[[The New Negro]]'', a collection of writings by him and other African Americans, which would become one of his best-known works. A landmark in black literature (later acclaimed as the "first national book" of African America),<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society, Volume 1|last=Schaefer|first=Richard T|publisher=Sage Reference|year=2008|isbn=9781412926942|pages=1296}}</ref> it was an instant success. Locke contributed five essays: the "Foreword", "The New Negro", "Negro Youth Speaks", "The Negro Spirituals", and "The Legacy of Ancestral Arts". This book established his reputation as "a leading African-American literary critic and aesthete."<ref name="stanford">{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alain-locke/|title=Alain LeRoy Locke|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Carter|first=Jacoby Adeshei|date=2012|access-date=21 August 2020}}</ref> 

Locke's philosophy of the New Negro was grounded in the concept of race-building. He raised overall awareness of potential black equality; he said that no longer would blacks allow themselves to adjust or comply with unreasonable white requests. This idea was based on self-confidence and political awareness. Although in the past the laws regarding equality had been ignored without consequence,<!-- by whom? --> Locke's philosophical idea of The New Negro allowed for fair treatment. Because this was an idea and not a law, people held its power. If they wanted this idea to flourish, they were the ones who would need to "enforce" it through their actions and overall points of view.

While his own writing was sophisticated philosophy, and therefore not popularly accessible, he mentored other writers in the movement who would become more broadly known, such as [[Zora Neale Hurston]].<ref name="congressionalburial" />

== Feud with Albert C. Barnes ==
One author whose work Locke edited for both ''Survey Graphic'' as well as ''The New Negro'' was art collector, critic, and theorist [[Albert C. Barnes|Albert Barnes]]. Barnes and Locke were connected in their shared views on the importance of Negro art in America.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=DuBois Shaw|date=2012|title=Creating a New Negro Art in America|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2979/transition.108.75|journal=Transition|issue=108|pages=75|doi=10.2979/transition.108.75|issn=0041-1191}}</ref> Barnes promulgated notions of the superiority of black art in terms of spirituality and emotion, owing to the collective suffering from which black artists draw to create their work.<ref name=":2" /> Locke argued for the primacy of craft objects and the visual tradition as being the greatest contributor of black art to the American canon.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Locke|first=Alain|title=The Negro in Art|publisher=Hacker Art Books Inc.|year=1940|location=New York}}</ref> The commonalities between the two men's' stance on black art led Barnes to believe Locke was stealing his ideas, creating a rift between the two men.<ref name=":2" /> Locke touches on his feud with Barnes in his book  ''The Negro in Art''.<ref name=":3" />

==Religious beliefs==
[[File:Alain Locke - NARA - 559203.tif|thumb|Painting by [[Betsy Graves Reyneau]]]]

Locke publicly sustained a religious commitment to Christianity, and rarely openly supported his affiliation to the Baháʼí movement.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Alain Locke: Faith and Philosophy|last=Buck|first=Christopher|publisher=Kalimat Press|year=2005|location=Los Angeles|pages=195}}</ref> Locke was a member of the [[Baháʼí Faith]] and declared his belief in [[Baháʼu'lláh]] in 1918. Due to the lack of an official enrollment system for the Baháʼí movement, the date when Locke converted to that faith is unverified.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Alain Locke: Faith and Philosophy|last=Buck|first=Christopher|publisher=Kalimat Press|year=2005|location=Los Angeles|pages=64}}</ref> However, the National Baháʼí Archives discovered a "[[Bahá'í Historical Record Survey|Baháʼí Historical Record]]" card that Locke completed in 1935 for a Baháʼí census from the National Spiritual Assembly.<ref name=":0" /> He was one of seven African-American members from the Washington, D.C. Baháʼí movement to complete the card.<ref name=":0" /> On the card, Locke wrote the year 1918 as the year he was accepted into the Baháʼí religion, and wrote Washington, D.C. as the place he was accepted.<ref name=":0" /> It was common to write to [[ʻAbdu'l-Bahá]] to declare one's new faith, and Locke received a letter, or "tablet", from ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in return.

When ʻAbdu'l-Bahá died in 1921, Locke enjoyed a close relationship with [[Shoghi Effendi]], then head of the Baháʼí Faith. Shoghi Effendi is reported to have said to Locke, "People as you, [[Louis George Gregory|Mr. Gregory]], [[John Esslemont|Dr. Esslemont]] and some other dear souls are as rare as diamond."<ref name=Buck64>{{cite book|author=Christopher Buck|title=Alain Locke: Faith and Philosophy|url=https://bahai-library.com/buck_locke_faith_philosophy|year=2005|publisher=Kalimat Press|isbn=978-1-890688-38-7|pages=64, 198| series =Studies in Bábí and Baháʼí Religions | volume =18  | editor-last = Series editor Lee | editor-first =Anthony A.}}</ref> He is among some 40 African Americans known to have joined the religion during the ministry of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá before the leader's  death in later 1921.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Loni Bramson|title=The Baháʼí Faith and African American History: Creating Racial and Religious Diversity|chapter=The Baháʼí "Pupil of the Eye" Metaphor; Promoting Ideal Race Relations in Jim Crow America|author=Christopher Buck|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stB-DwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1|date=4 December 2018|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-1-4985-7003-9|oclc= 1084418420 |pages=20–21}}</ref>

== Sexual orientation ==
Locke was [[homosexual]], and may have encouraged and supported other gay African Americans who were part of the Harlem Renaissance.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://thenewgay.net/2008/10/hidden-history-alain-locke-is-key-part.html|title = Hidden History: Alain Locke is the Key (Part II)|date = Oct 6, 2008|access-date = Sep 12, 2014|website = The New Gay|last = Clark|first = Phillip}}</ref> Given the discriminatory laws against it, he was not fully open about his orientation.<ref name="congressionalburial" /> He referred to it as a point of "vulnerable/invulnerability", representing an area of both risk and strength.<ref name=Buck64/>

==Death, influence and legacy==
After his retirement from Howard University in 1953, Locke moved to New York City.<ref name=WPobit>{{cite news|title=A.L. Locke, Howard U. Professor, 67|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 11, 1954|page=22}}</ref> He suffered from heart disease.<ref name=WPobit /> Following a six-week illness, he died at Mount Sinai Hospital on June 9, 1954.<ref name=NYTobit>{{cite news|title=Dr. Alain Locke, Teacher, Author|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 10, 1954|page=31}}</ref> During his illness, he was cared for by his friend and [[Mentorship|mentee]], [[Margaret Just Butcher]].<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2019/aug/22/dr-margaret-just-butcher-educator-and-political-ac/|title=Dr. Margaret Just Butcher, Educator and Political Activist|last=Boyd|first=Herb|date=22 August 2019|website=Amsterdam News|page=1|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200214011132/http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2019/aug/22/dr-margaret-just-butcher-educator-and-political-ac/|archive-date=14 February 2020|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2019/aug/22/dr-margaret-just-butcher-educator-and-political-ac/|title=Dr. Margaret Just Butcher, Educator and Political Activist|last=Boyd|first=Herb|date=22 August 2019|website=Amsterdam News|page=2|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200214011559/http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2019/aug/22/dr-margaret-just-butcher-educator-and-political-ac/?page=2|archive-date=14 February 2020|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>

Butcher used notes from Locke's unfinished work to write ''The Negro in American Culture'' (1956).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Winslow|first=Henry F.|date=December 1956|title=Mosaic Vision|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LlwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA579|journal=The Crisis|volume=63|issue=10|pages=633–634}}</ref>

===Journey of ashes===
Locke was [[cremation|cremated]], and his remains given to Dr. [[Arthur Fauset]], Locke's close friend and executor of his estate. He was an anthropologist who was a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance. After Fauset died in 1983, and the remains were given to his friend, Reverend Sadie Mitchell, who ministered at [[African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Mitchell retained the ashes until the mid-1990s, when she asked Dr. J. Weldon Norris, a professor of music at [[Howard University]], to take the ashes to the university.

The ashes were held at Howard University's [[Moorland–Spingarn Research Center]] until 2007. That year they were discovered when two former Rhodes scholars were working on the Centennial of Locke's selection as a Rhodes Scholar. Concerned that the human remains were not properly cared for, the university transferred them to its W. Montague Cobb Research Laboratory, which had extensive experience handling human remains (and had worked on those from the [[African Burying Ground]] in New York). Locke's ashes, which had been stored in a plain paper bag in a simple round metal container, were transferred to a small funerary urn and locked in a safe.<ref name=congressionalburial />

Howard University officials initially considered having Locke's ashes buried in a niche at Locke Hall on the Howard campus, as [[Langston Hughes]]'s ashes had been interred in 1991 at the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]] in New York City. But [[Kurt Schmoke]], the university's legal counsel, was concerned about setting a precedent that might lead to too many people trying to gain  burials at the university. After reviewing legal issues, university officials decided to bury the remains off-site. They thought to bury Locke beside his mother, Mary Hawkins Locke. But Howard officials quickly discovered a problem: She had been interred at [[Columbian Harmony Cemetery]] in Washington, D.C., but that cemetery closed in 1959. Her remains and others from that cemetery were transferred to [[National Harmony Memorial Park]]. (She and 37,000 other unclaimed remains from Columbian Harmony were buried in a mass grave, with no markers.)<ref name=congressionalburial />

University officials eventually decided to bury Alain Locke's remains at historic [[Congressional Cemetery]] in Washington, DC. Former African-American Rhodes Scholars raised $8,000 to purchase a burial plot there. Locke was interred at Congressional Cemetery on September 13, 2014. His tombstone reads:

<blockquote>1885–1954<br>
Herald of the Harlem Renaissance<br>
Exponent of Cultural Pluralism</blockquote>

On the back of the headstone is a nine-pointed [[Bahai symbols|Baháʼí star]] (representing Locke's religious beliefs); a [[Zimbabwe Bird]], emblem of the nation Locke adopted as a Rhodes Scholar; a [[LGBT symbols#Lambda|lambda]], symbol of the gay rights movement; and the logo of [[Phi Beta Sigma]], the fraternity Locke joined. In the center of these four symbols is an [[Art Deco]] representation of an African woman's face set against the rays of the sun. This image is a simplified version of the [[bookplate]] that Harlem Renaissance painter [[Aaron Douglas]] designed for Locke. Below the bookplate image are the words "Teneo te, Africa" ("I hold you, my Africa"). This represented Locke's belief that African Americans needed to study African culture to enlarge their sense of self.<ref name=congressionalburial />
