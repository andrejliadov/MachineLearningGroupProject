This is a list of people who disappeared mysteriously post-1970 and of people whose current whereabouts are unknown or whose deaths are not substantiated, except for [[List of people who disappeared mysteriously at sea|people who disappeared at sea]].
Since the 1970s, many individuals around the world have disappeared, whose whereabouts and condition have remained unknown. Many who disappear are eventually [[declared death in absentia|declared dead ''in absentia'']], but the circumstances and dates of their deaths remain a mystery. Some of these people were possibly subjected to [[forced disappearance]], but in some cases information on their subsequent fates is insufficient.

In the moments between his leaving the shower block and returning with his mother, Cheryl disappeared.

|A medical student, Durst disappeared on 31 January 1982 after leaving the house of a friend to return to the [[South Salem, New York]], residence that she shared with her husband. She has not been seen since and was declared legally dead in 2001. Since her marriage was deteriorating, police strongly suspected that her husband, [[Robert Durst]], had murdered her, citing inconsistencies in statements he gave them. He is suspected in two other disappearances and served three years in prison for evidence-tampering in the death of a third person.

|The Iranian military attache Ahmad Motevaselian was one of the four Iranian diplomats (with [[Seyed Mohsen Mousavi]], [[Kazem Akhavan]], and [[Taghi Rastegar Moghadam]]) who [[Iranian diplomats kidnapping (1982)|disappeared in Lebanon in 1982]]. On 5 July 1982, when the vehicle carrying the diplomats was passing through a checkpoint on its way to [[Beirut]], it was intercepted by [[Kataeb Party|Phalange Party]] members. Three decades after the incident, the fate of the missing diplomats remains a mystery, and the search for Motevaselian and the other Iranian diplomats continues.

On 3 December 1982, Clemmons was seen walking on a bridge above the [[Escatawpa River]] on [[Interstate 10 in Mississippi|Interstate 10]], near the Alabama/Mississippi border with her daughter, appearing distressed. When passing motorists tried to assist her, she denied any help. A motorist reported seeing the body of a woman, floating in the river on 5 December, however, when authorities responded, they found the body of her daughter instead. Subsequent searches did not find Clemmons, however did uncover the body of another [[List of unidentified murder victims in the United States#Jackson County John Doe (1982)|unidentified man]], who was most likely unrelated to the case. Authorities still consider Clemmons a missing person, but believe she is deceased.

|Feced, an [[Argentine|Argentinian]] police official believed responsible for many tortures and extrajudicial executions during the country's [[Dirty War]], was stated to have died in prison on 21 July 1986 while facing charges related to those activities. However, the records of his death and burial are incomplete and sometimes contradictory. Several sources doubt he was even imprisoned at the time. In 1986, the military hospital announced that Feced had died, but they did not offer any proof of it.

|Needham, a 21-month-old boy, disappeared while his grandparents were renovating a farmhouse. Despite numerous sighting reports over the years, he has not been found. Family members have said they believe that the child was kidnapped with the intention of selling him for adoption or to [[human trafficking|child traffickers]]. Others familiar with the case consider the theory of an accident more likely. In 2016, excavations conducted nearby led investigators to informally conclude that Ben died in an accident that day on a construction site. This theory has been substantiated by reports of blood being discovered on a toy car and sandal believed to have belonged to the toddler, which were discovered in 2017.

His car resurfaced two weeks later, parked near his mother's workplace, with a live puppy inside and a large set of lips drawn on the window. In 2015, Asheville detectives unearthed fabric, leather materials, and "unknown hard fragments" that were buried under a layer of concrete on the property of Robert Jason Owens. Owens was the last person known to have seen Quinn and had given several conflicting stories to detectives in his case. The search of his property that uncovered this new evidence was conducted after he was arrested for an unrelated triple murder. On 10 July 2017, Owens was indicted for Quinn's murder.

He was in the country illegally, and was continually hunted by authorities, and escaped numerous times under gunfire. He eventually escaped the country in disguise and went on a world tour to raise awareness about the Penan, including founding a nonprofit organization. In 2000, against all advice, he covertly re-entered Borneo. Manser was last seen in the jungle near [[Bukit Batu Lawi]], a 2,000-m limestone pinnacle in Sarawak. Manser stated his intention to climb the pinnacle alone. The Penan mounted a search and rescue mission after he failed to return. He has not been seen since.

| Murray, a nursing student at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], was last seen on [[New Hampshire Route 112]] at the scene of a minor one-vehicle accident in which her car was disabled after crashing into a roadside snowbank. Earlier on the day of her disappearance, she had lied to professors about a death in her family, stating that she would be absent from class for a week. A school bus driver who happened upon Murray's crash site stopped to ask if she needed help and Murray declined. Upon returning home a short time later, the bus driver called police anyway, but by the time first responders arrived, 10 minutes later, Murray had vanished. Her keys along with bank and credit cards have never been located despite extensive searches of her abandoned car and the neighboring wooded areas.

| Levinson, a retired U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] and [[FBI]] agent, was last seen in the custody of who seemed to be Iranian intelligence agents on 9 March 2007 on [[Kish Island]]. He had gone there to set up a meeting with [[Dawud Salahuddin]], an American-born convert to Islam, ostensibly about securing the Iranian government's help in controlling the distribution of pirated American cigarettes in Iran. He was later revealed to be working for the CIA at that time, as well. In 2010, a video of him, somewhat emaciated, was released, in which he begs for help from the U.S. government to be released. The U.S. government has regularly raised the issue of his release with Iran as part of talks between the countries, but Iran's statements as to whether he still is in their custody or even alive have been contradictory, and Levinson is thought to be no longer under their control if he is still alive. His family announced on 25 March 2020 that he is presumed dead.

Though her body was never found, a few personal belongings and a blood-stained police uniform were found 8 October 2007 in a ravine. She was officially declared missing in 2009, and Cioacă was sentenced to 22 years in jail in 2013, after being arrested in 2012. She was suggested to have been murdered due to jealousy after she had an affair with an SPP officer in Dubai in August 2007, a few days before her supposed disappearance, the murder taking place in the bathroom of her apartment, according to neighbors. She was also supposedly going to be targeted by authorities for tax evasion.

|Bohling disappeared after his car was found in the car park for [[Bempton Cliffs]] [[RSPB]] site. Police have assumed his case is a suicide or accident, though no body has been found. His family maintain that a third party was involved, as he did not have enough fuel to drive to Bempton from his family home in [[West Ella]], a USB stick detailing the pornographic artwork and graffiti left on the walls of the former bunker of [[RAF Bempton]] was missing and the trainers he supposedly wore that day were found in the family's holiday home even further up the coast after he had disappeared.

|Dingley had been on a solo trek through the Pyrenees when she disappeared on November 22. On that date, she had reached the top of Pic de Sauvegarde on the France-Spain border and sent Dan Colegate, her partner, a photo of herself on the top of the mountain via Whatsapp. Dingley was due to return from her solo trek on November 25. Search teams in the area found no evidence of Dingley, who was an experienced mountaineer. Weather in the surrounding area was good at the time of her disappearance, leading to theories that she had fallen down a crevasse or deliberately disappeared.
