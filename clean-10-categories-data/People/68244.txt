'''Bonnie Elizabeth Parker''' (October 1, 1910{{spnd}}May 23, 1934) and '''Clyde Chestnut Barrow''' (March 24, 1909{{spnd}}May 23, 1934) were an [[United States|American]] [[Crime|criminal]] couple who traveled the [[Central United States]] with [[Barrow Gang|their gang]] during the [[Great Depression]], known for their [[bank robbery|bank robberies]], although they preferred to rob small stores or rural gas stations. Their exploits captured the attention of the American press and its readership during what is occasionally referred to as the "[[public enemy]] era" between 1931 and 1934. They are believed to have murdered at least nine police officers and four civilians. They were killed in May 1934 during an ambush by police near [[Gibsland, Louisiana|Gibsland]], [[Louisiana]].

The press's portrayal of Bonnie and Clyde was sometimes at odds with the reality of their life on the road, especially for Parker. She was present at 100 or more [[felony|felonies]] during the two years that she was Barrow's companion,<ref>Phillips, John Neal (2002).

==Bonnie Parker==
'''Bonnie Elizabeth Parker''' was born in 1910 in [[Rowena, Texas|Rowena]], [[Texas]], the second of three children. Her father Charles Robert Parker (1884–1914) was a bricklayer who died when Bonnie was four years old.<ref>Phillips, p. xxxv; Guinn, p. 45</ref> Her widowed mother Emma (Krause) Parker (1885–1944) moved her family back to her parents' home in Cement City, an industrial suburb in [[West Dallas]] where she worked as a seamstress.<ref>Guinn, p. 46</ref> As an adult, Bonnie wrote poems such as "The Story of Suicide Sal"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinetropic.com/bonnieandclyde/sal.html|title=The Story of Suicide Sal – Bonnie Parker 1932|work=cinetropic.com|access-date=April 21, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318055510/http://www.cinetropic.com/bonnieandclyde/sal.html|archive-date=March 18, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> and "The Trail's End", the latter more commonly known as "The Story of Bonnie and Clyde".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinetropic.com/janeloisemorris/commentary/bonn%26clyde/parkerpoem.html|title=The Story of Bonnie and Clyde|work=cinetropic.com|access-date=April 21, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213121222/http://www.cinetropic.com/janeloisemorris/commentary/bonn%26clyde/parkerpoem.html|archive-date=February 13, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In her second year in high school, Parker met Roy Thornton (1908-1937). The couple dropped out of school and were married on September 25, 1926, six days before her 16th birthday.<ref>Phillips, p. xxxvi; Guinn, p. 76...What is this reference? this isn't a real reference</ref> Their marriage was marred by his frequent absences and brushes with the law, and it proved to be short lived. They never divorced, but their paths never crossed again after January 1929. She was still wearing his wedding ring when she died.<ref group=notes>A few months after their breakup, Thornton was convicted and imprisoned for robbery. Parker told her mother, "Well, I didn't get [a divorce] before Roy was sent up, and it looks sort of dirty to file for one now." Parker, Cowan and Fortune, p. 56</ref> Thornton was in prison when he heard of her death. He commented, "I'm glad they went out like they did. It's much better than being caught."<ref name="roy" /> Sentenced to 5 years for robbery in 1933 and after attempting several prison breaks from other facilities, Thornton was killed while trying to escape from the [[Huntsville State Prison]] on October 3, 1937.

After the end of her marriage, Parker moved back in with her mother and worked as a waitress in [[Dallas]]. One of her regular customers was postal worker [[Ted Hinton]]. In 1932, he joined the Dallas Sheriff's Department and eventually served as a member of the [[wikt:posse#Noun|posse]] that killed Bonnie and Clyde.<ref>Guinn, p. 79</ref> Parker briefly kept a diary early in 1929 when she was 18, in which she wrote of her loneliness, her impatience with life in Dallas, and her love of [[Sound film|talking pictures]].<ref>Parker, Cowan and Fortune, pp. 55–57</ref>

The family moved to Dallas in the early 1920s, part of a migration pattern from rural areas to the city where many settled in the urban [[slum]] of West Dallas. The Barrows spent their first months in West Dallas living under their wagon until they got enough money to buy a tent.<ref>Guinn provides a comprehensive description of West Dallas, p. 20.</ref>

Barrow was first arrested in late 1926, at age 17, after running when police confronted him over a rental car that he had failed to return on time. His second arrest was with his brother [[Buck Barrow|Buck]] soon after for possession of stolen turkeys. Barrow had some legitimate jobs during 1927 through 1929, but he also [[safe-cracking|cracked safes]], [[robbery|robbed stores]], and [[motor vehicle theft|stole cars]]. He met 19 year-old Parker through a mutual friend in January 1930, and they spent much time together during the following weeks. Their romance was interrupted when Barrow was arrested and convicted of auto theft.

Clyde was sent to [[Eastham Unit|Eastham Prison Farm]] in April 1930 at the age of 21. He escaped from the prison farm shortly after his incarceration using a weapon Parker smuggled to him. He was recaptured shortly after and sent back to prison.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/bonnie-and-clyde |title=Bonnie and Clyde |website=Federal Bureau of Investigation |language=en-us |access-date=February 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224230425/https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/bonnie-and-clyde |archive-date=February 24, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Barrow was repeatedly [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] while in prison, and he retaliated by attacking and killing his tormentor with a pipe, crushing his skull.<ref>Guinn, p. 76.</ref> This was his first killing. Another inmate, who was already serving a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]], claimed responsibility.

In order to avoid [[hard labor]] in the fields, Barrow purposely had two of his toes chopped off by either him or another inmate in late January 1932. Because of this, he walked with a limp for the rest of his life. However, Barrow was set free six days after his intentional injury. Without his knowledge, Barrow's mother had successfully petitioned for his release.<ref name=AmExp>{{cite episode |title=Bonnie and Clyde (Part 1) |series= American Experience |publisher=PBS |date=January 19, 2016 |season=24 |number= 4}}</ref> He was [[parole]]d on February 2, 1932 from Eastham as a hardened and bitter criminal.

In his post-Eastham career, Barrow robbed grocery stores and gas stations at a rate far outpacing the ten or so bank robberies attributed to him and the [[Barrow Gang]]. His favorite weapon was the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]] (BAR).<ref name=AmExp /> According to John Neal Phillips, Barrow's goal in life was not to gain fame or fortune from robbing banks but to seek revenge against the Texas prison system for the abuses that he suffered while serving time.<ref name="eastham">Phillips, John Neal (October 2000).

Several accounts describe Parker and Barrow's first meeting. The most credible states that they met on January 5, 1930 at the home of Barrow's friend Clarence Clay at 105 Herbert Street in the neighborhood of West Dallas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/bonnie-parker-9542045|title=Bonnie Parker|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=February 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315064924/https://www.biography.com/people/bonnie-parker-9542045|archive-date=March 15, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Barrow was 20 years old, and Parker was 19.

After Barrow's release from prison in February 1932, he and Fults began a series of robberies, primarily of stores and gas stations;<ref name=":0" /> their goal was to collect enough money and firepower to launch a raid against Eastham prison.<ref name="eastham" /> On April 19, Parker and Fults were captured in a failed hardware store [[burglary]] in [[Kaufman, Texas|Kaufman]] in which they had intended to steal firearms.<ref>Guinn, pp. 103–04</ref> Parker was released from jail in a few months, after the [[grand jury]] failed to [[indictment|indict]] her; Fults was tried, convicted, and served time.

Parker wrote poetry to pass the time in jail.<ref>Guinn, p. 109.</ref><ref group=notes>Parker composed these poems in an old bankbook which the jailer's wife had given her to use as paper.

On March 22, 1933, Clyde's brother Buck was granted a full [[pardon]] and released from prison, and he and his wife [[Blanche Barrow|Blanche]] set up housekeeping with Bonnie, Clyde and Jones in a temporary hideout at [[Bonnie & Clyde Garage Apartment|3347 1/2 Oakridge Drive]] in [[Joplin, Missouri|Joplin]], [[Missouri]]. According to family sources,<ref>Barrow and Phillips, pp. 31–33.

The police assembled a five-man force in two cars on April 13 to confront what they suspected were [[Rum-running|bootleggers]] living in the garage apartment.

The group escaped the police at Joplin, but left behind most of their possessions at the apartment, including Buck's parole papers (three weeks old), a large arsenal of weapons, a handwritten poem by Bonnie, and a camera with several rolls of undeveloped film.<ref>Parker, Cowan and Fortune, p. 115</ref> Police developed the film at ''[[The Joplin Globe]]'' and found many photos of Barrow, Parker, and Jones posing and pointing weapons at one another.<ref>Ramsey pp. 108–13.</ref> The ''Globe'' sent the poem and the photos over the [[newswire]], including a photo of Parker clenching a cigar in her teeth and a [[pistol]] in her hand, and the gang of criminals became front-page news throughout America as the Barrow Gang.

The photo of Parker posing with a cigar and a gun became popular:

Stories of such encounters made headlines, as did the more violent episodes.

=== 1934: Final run ===
On January 16, 1934, Barrow orchestrated the escape of Hamilton, Methvin, and several others in the "Eastham Breakout".<ref name="eastham" /> The brazen raid generated negative publicity for Texas, and Barrow seemed to have achieved what historian Phillips suggests was his overriding goal: revenge on the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice|Texas Department of Corrections]].<ref group=notes>Phillips writes that Barrow had been so focused on this for so long that, after the Eastham raid, "life for Clyde Barrow became anticlimactic…only death remained, and he knew it". Phillips, ''Running'', p. 217.</ref>

The Texas Department of Corrections contacted former [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Captain [[Frank Hamer]] and persuaded him to hunt down the Barrow Gang. He was retired, but his commission had not expired.<ref>[http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/law/index.html ''Frank Hamer and Bonnie & Clyde''.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602164445/http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/law/index.html |date=June 2, 2008 }} [[Texas State Library and Archives Commission]].</ref> He accepted the assignment as a [[Texas Department of Public Safety|Texas Highway Patrol]] officer, secondarily assigned to the prison system as a special investigator, and given the specific task of taking down the Barrow Gang.

[[File:B&CElecChairEditCartoon1934.jpg|thumb|upright|Public opinion turned against the couple after the Grapevine murders and resultant negative publicity]]

During the spring season, the Grapevine killings were recounted in exaggerated detail, affecting public perception; all four Dallas daily papers seized on the story told by the eyewitness, a farmer who claimed to have seen Parker laugh at the way that Murphy's head "bounced like a rubber ball" on the ground as she shot him.<ref>Guinn, p. 284</ref> The stories claimed that police found a cigar butt "with tiny teeth marks", supposedly those of Parker.<ref>''Ft.

The outcry galvanized the authorities into action, and Highway Patrol boss L.G. Phares offered a reward of $1,000 for "the dead bodies of the Grapevine slayers"—not their capture, just the bodies.<ref name="Knight and Davis, p 147">Knight and Davis, p. 147</ref> [[Governor of Texas|Texas Governor]] [[Ma Ferguson]] added another reward of $500 for each of the two killers, which meant that, for the first time, "there was a specific price on Bonnie's head, since she was so widely believed to have shot H.D. Murphy".<ref>Guinn, p. 287</ref>

Public hostility increased five days later, when Barrow and Methvin murdered 60 year-old Constable William "Cal" Campbell, a widower and father, near [[Commerce, Oklahoma]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Constable William Calvin Campbell |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/2735-constable-william-calvin-campbell |publisher=The Officer Down Memorial Page |accessdate=November 5, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215121155/http://www.odmp.org/officer/2735-constable-william-calvin-campbell |archive-date=December 15, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They kidnapped Commerce police chief Percy Boyd, crossed the state line into [[Kansas]], and let him go, giving him a clean shirt, a few dollars, and a request from Parker to tell the world that she did not smoke cigars.

The resultant arrest warrant for the Campbell murder specified "Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker and John Doe".<ref>Knight and Davis, p. 217 n12.

Barrow and Parker were killed on May 23, 1934, on a rural road in [[Bienville Parish, Louisiana]].<ref name="road" /><ref name="dispatch" /> Hamer, who had begun tracking the gang on February 12, led the posse. He had studied the gang's movements and found that they swung in a circle skirting the edges of five mid-western states, exploiting the "state line" rule which prevented officers from pursuing a fugitive into another jurisdiction. Barrow was consistent in his movements, so Hamer charted his path and predicted where he would go. The gang's itinerary centered on family visits, and they were due to see Methvin's family in Louisiana. In case they were separated, Barrow had designated Methvin's parents' residence as a rendezvous, and Methvin became separated from the rest of the gang in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. Hamer's posse was composed of six men: Texas officers Hamer, Hinton, Alcorn, and B.M.

On May 21, the four posse members from Texas were in Shreveport when they learned that Barrow and Parker were planning a visit to Bienville Parish that evening with Methvin. The full posse set up an ambush along Louisiana State Highway 154 south of [[Gibsland, Louisiana|Gibsland]] toward Sailes. Hinton recounted that their group was in place by 9 pm, and waited through the whole of the next day (May 22) with no sign of the perpetrators.<ref name= Hinton>Hinton, Ted and Larry Grove (1979).

At approximately 9:15 am on May 23, the posse were still concealed in the bushes and almost ready to give up when they heard the [[1932 Ford#1934|Ford V8]] Barrow  was driving approaching at high speed. In their official report, they stated they had persuaded Ivy Methvin to position his truck along the shoulder of the road that morning. They hoped Barrow would stop to speak with him, putting his vehicle close to the posse's position in the bushes. When Barrow fell into the trap, the lawmen opened fire while the vehicle was still moving. Oakley fired first, probably before any order to do so.<ref name=Hinton /><ref name="Knight and Davis, p 166">Knight and Davis, p. 166.</ref><ref>Guinn, pp. 339–40.</ref> Barrow was killed instantly by Oakley's head shot, and Hinton reported hearing Parker scream.<ref name=Hinton /> The officers fired about 130 rounds, emptying their weapons into the car.<ref name="posse">[http://texashideout.tripod.com/posse.html ''The Posse''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520184604/http://texashideout.tripod.com/posse.html |date=May 20, 2006 }}, Texas Hideout.

Barrow’s enthusiasm for cars was evident in a letter he wrote earlier in the spring of 1934, addressed to Henry Ford himself: “While I still have got breath in my lungs I will tell you what a dandy car you make. I have drove Fords exclusively when I could get away with one. For sustained speed and freedom from trouble the Ford has got every other car skinned and even if my business hasn’t been strictly legal it don’t hurt anything to tell you what a fine car you got in the V-8.”

The posse towed the Ford, with the dead bodies still inside, to the Conger Furniture Store & Funeral Parlor in downtown [[Arcadia, Louisiana]].

Bonnie and Clyde wished to be buried side by side, but the Parker family would not allow it.

Thousands of people gathered outside both Dallas funeral homes, hoping for a chance to view the bodies. Barrow's private funeral was held at sunset on May 25.<ref name="funeral">Moshinskie, Dr. James F. "Funerals of the Famous: Bonnie & Clyde."

The six men of the posse were each to receive a one-sixth share of the reward money, and Dallas Sheriff Schmid had promised Hinton that this would total some $26,000,<ref>Hinton, p 192</ref> but most of the organizations that had pledged reward funds suddenly reneged on their pledges.

By the summer of 1934, new federal statutes made bank robbery and kidnapping federal offenses. The growing coordination of local authorities by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], plus [[two-way radio]]s in police cars, combined to make it more difficult to carry out series of robberies and murders than it had been just months before. Two months after Gibsland, Dillinger was killed on the street in [[Chicago]]; three months after that, Floyd was killed in [[Ohio]]; and one month after that, [[Baby Face Nelson]] was killed in Illinois.<ref>Ramsey, pp. 276–79</ref>

== Differing accounts ==
The members of the posse came from three organizations: Hamer and Gault were both former Texas Rangers then working for the Texas Department of Corrections (DOC), Hinton and Alcorn were employees of the Dallas Sheriff's office, and Jordan and Oakley were Sheriff and Deputy of Bienville Parish, Louisiana. The three duos distrusted one another and kept to themselves,<ref>Guinn, pp. 335–36</ref> and each had its own agenda in the operation and offered differing narratives of it. Simmons, the head of the Texas DOC, brought another perspective, having effectively commissioned the posse.

Schmid had tried to arrest Barrow in Sowers, Texas in November 1933. Schmid called "Halt!" and gunfire erupted from the outlaw car, which made a quick U-turn and sped away. Schmid's Thompson submachine gun jammed on the first round, and he could not get off one shot. Pursuit of Barrow was impossible because the posse had parked their own cars at a distance to prevent their being seen.<ref name="Knight and Davis, p. 118"/>

Hamer's posse discussed calling "halt" but the four Texans "vetoed the idea",<ref>Phillips, ''Running'', p. 205</ref> telling them that the killers' history had always been to shoot their way out,<ref name="Knight and Davis, p 166" /> as had occurred in Platte City, Dexfield Park, and Sowers.<ref>Guinn, p. 269</ref> When the ambush occurred, Oakley stood up and opened fire, and the other officers opened fire immediately after.<ref name="Knight and Davis, p 166" /> Jordan was reported to have called out to Barrow;<ref>Associated Press story with a by-line by Jordan, published in the ''New York Times'' and ''Dallas Morning News'', May 24, 1934</ref> Alcorn said that Hamer called out;<ref>''Dallas Morning News'', May 24, 1934</ref> and Hinton claimed that Alcorn did.<ref name="Hinton" /> In another report, each said that they both did.<ref>''Dallas Dispatch'', May 24, 1934.</ref> These conflicting claims might have been collegial attempts to divert the focus from Oakley, who later admitted firing too early, but that is merely speculation.<ref name="Guinn, p 357">Guinn, p. 357.</ref>
In 1979, Hinton's account of the saga was published posthumously as ''Ambush: The Real Story of Bonnie and Clyde''.<ref>Ted Hinton, as told to Larry Grove, ''Ambush: The Real Story of Bonnie and Clyde'', Shoal Creek Publishers, 1979</ref> His version of the Methvin family's involvement in the planning and execution of the ambush was that the posse had tied Methvin's father Ivy to a tree the previous night to keep him from warning off the couple.<ref name="Hinton" /> Hinton claimed that Hamer made a deal with Ivy: if he kept quiet about being tied up, his son would escape [[prosecution]] for the two Grapevine murders.<ref name="Hinton" /> Hinton alleged that Hamer made every member of the posse swear that they would never divulge this secret.

Other accounts, however, place Ivy at the center of the action, not tied up but on the road, waving for Barrow to stop.<ref name="Knight and Davis, p 147" /><ref>Treherne, p. 220</ref> Hinton's memoir suggests that Parker's cigar in the famous "cigar photo" had been a rose, and that it was retouched as a cigar by darkroom staff at the ''Joplin Globe'' while they prepared the photo for publication.<ref>Hinton, pp. 39, 47</ref><ref group=notes>But the cigar is shown in other photos from the Joplin rolls shot at the same spot. (Ramsey, pp. 108–09)</ref> Guinn says that some people who knew Hinton suspect that "he became [[delusion]]al late in life".<ref>Guinn, p. 413 n</ref>

== Aftermath ==
The posse never received the promised [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on the perpetrators, so they were told to take whatever they wanted from the confiscated items in their car. Hamer appropriated the arsenal<ref>Phillips, ''Running'', p.  207</ref> of stolen guns and ammunition, plus a box of fishing tackle, under the terms of his compensation package with the Texas DOC.<ref group=notes>Hamer was interested in the Barrow hunt assignment, but the pay was only a third of what he made working for oil companies. To sweeten the deal, Texas Department of Corrections boss Lee Simmons granted him title to all the guns that the posse would recover from the slain murderers. Almost all the guns, which the gang had stolen from armories, were the property of the National Guard. There was a thriving market for "celebrity" guns, even in 1934 (Guinn, p. 343).</ref> In July, Clyde's mother Cumie wrote to Hamer asking for the return of the guns: "You don't never want to forget my boy was never tried in no court for murder, and no one is guilty until proven guilty by some court so I hope you will answer this letter and also return the guns I am asking for."<ref name=tre224>Treherne, p.  224</ref> There is no record of any response.<ref name=tre224 />

Alcorn claimed Barrow's [[saxophone]] from the car, but he later returned it to the Barrow family.<ref name="Guinn, p 343">Guinn, p. 343</ref> Posse members also took other personal items, such as Parker's clothing. The Parker family asked for them back but were refused,<ref name="posse" /><ref>[http://texashideout.tripod.com/emlet.jpg ''Emma Parker letter''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804050023/http://texashideout.tripod.com/emlet.jpg |date=August 4, 2018 }}.

After Jordan conceded ownership of the vehicle, Mrs Warren arrived in Arcadia to claim it and then drove it to Shreveport, still in its gruesome state. From there, she had it trucked back to Topeka.

[[File:HenryMethvinMugshot1931.jpg|thumb|Henry Methvin escaped prosecution for the two Grapevine, Texas, murders because of his father's cooperation with the posse. But he was prosecuted for other crimes in Oklahoma, where he was convicted and served eight years.]]

In February 1935, Dallas and federal authorities arrested and tried twenty family members and friends for [[aiding and abetting]] Barrow and Parker. This became known as the "harboring trial" and all twenty either pleaded guilty or were found guilty. The two mothers were jailed for thirty days; other sentences ranged from two years' imprisonment (for Floyd Hamilton, brother of Raymond) to one hour in custody (for Barrow's teenage sister Marie).<ref>Guinn, pp. 354–55</ref> Other defendants included Blanche, Jones, Methvin, and Parker's sister Billie.

Blanche was permanently blinded in her left eye during the 1933 shootout at Dexfield Park. She was taken into custody on the charge of "[[attempted murder|assault with intent to kill]]". She was convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison, but was paroled in 1939 for good behavior. She returned to Dallas, leaving her life of crime in the past, and lived with her invalid father as his caregiver. In 1940, she married Eddie Frasure, worked as a taxi cab dispatcher and a beautician, and completed the terms of her parole one year later. She lived in peace with her husband until he died of cancer in 1969. [[Warren Beatty]] approached her to purchase the rights to her name for use in the 1967 film ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', and she agreed to the original script. However, she objected to her characterization by [[Estelle Parsons]] in the final film, describing the actress's Academy Award-winning portrayal of her as "a screaming horse's ass". Despite this, she maintained a firm friendship with Beatty. She died from cancer at age 77 on December 24, 1988, and was buried in Dallas's Grove Hill Memorial Park under the name "Blanche B. Frasure".<ref>Barrow and Phillips, p. 249 n</ref>

Hamer returned to a quiet life as a freelance security consultant for oil companies. According to Guinn, "his reputation suffered somewhat after Gibsland"<ref>Guinn, p. 356</ref> because many people felt that he had not given Barrow and Parker a fair chance to surrender.
