'''The Batten Twins''' were a [[professional wrestling]] [[tag team]], consisting of twin brothers Bart and Brad Batten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legacyofwrestling.com/Families.html |title=Families in Professional Wrestling |author=Hornbaker, Tim |first2=Ronald|last2=Grosspietsch |website=LegacyofWrestling.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingmuseum.com/pages/lists/relations.html |title=Wrestling Relations |last1=Baldridge|first1=Terry |first2=Rick|last2=Duggan|first3=Nick|last3=Simicich |website=WrestlingMuseum.com }}</ref> They performed under the "Batten Twins" name in [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|Central States Wrestling]], [[Continental Wrestling Association]], [[International Championship Wrestling]], [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], [[Southern Championship Wrestling (Georgia)|Southern Championship Wrestling]], [[Southwest Championship Wrestling|Texas All-Star Wrestling]], [[World Championship Wrestling]], and the [[World Wrestling Council]], and the name '''U.S. Express''' in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]].

==Early life==
Bradley Jay "Brad" Batten and Bartley Alan "Bart" Batten were born to Marjorie (née Hayes) and Jack Batten in [[New Martinsville, West Virginia]] on September 8, 1958.<ref name="MNJ">{{cite news |date=November 20, 2014 |title=Bradley Jay Batten |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/mansfieldnewsjournal/obituary.aspx?pid=173221432 |newspaper=[[Mansfield News Journal]] |location=[[Mansfield, Ohio]] |publisher=Gannett Co. }}</ref> They were involved in [[youth athletics|youth sports]] at an early age.

As both schools had a longtime [[College rivalry|football rivalry]], the brothers often played against each other but with Bart as a [[wide receiver]] and Brad a [[running back]] they were never on the field at the same time.<ref name="Simms"/> In addition to teaching school, Bart Batten went on to play two years of semi-professional football for the West Virginia Rockets.<ref name="Simms"/>

==Professional wrestling career==

===International Championship Wrestling (1983–1984)===
Both brothers were wrestling fans and decided to try out for a career in pro wrestling after attending several [[International Championship Wrestling]] shows in the early 1980s. The two spent about a year working out until they each weighed {{convert|210|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. They also experimented with [[steroids]] during this time. Then living in [[St. Albans, West Virginia]], Bart approached [[Lanny Poffo]] at an ICW show in [[Beckley, West Virginia|Beckley]]. The wrestler introduced Brad to his brother [[Randy Savage]] and invited the brothers to the promotion's next show in [[Marmet, West Virginia|Marmet]] to meet with their father [[Angelo Poffo]]. Lanny later admitted to Brad that he was skeptical about him having a twin brother but when the twins entered the dressing room the Poffo family "saw dollar signs" as identical twins were very rare in the wrestling business at the time.<ref name="Simms"/>

The Battens were initially trained by Lanny Poffo in [[Sutton, West Virginia]]. Bart recalled that Poffo had tried to "[[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] on him" during their first day of training by putting him in a [[front facelock]]. He had wrestled three years in high school, however, and was able to reverse the facelock and make Poffo submit to a [[Guillotine (wrestling)|guillotine hold]]. Their training progressed quickly after this incident, with both Angelo Poffo and Randy Savage taking part,<ref name="f4wonline">{{cite web |url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/103-indies/39968-brad-batten-passes-away |title=Brad Batten passes away |editor1=[[Dave Meltzer|Meltzer, Dave]] |editor2=[[Bryan Alvarez]] |date=November 18, 2014 |website=F4Wonline.com |publisher=Wrestling Observer/Figure Four Weekly }}</ref> and they were put into their first match after only a few sessions. The brothers became close friends with both Lanny and Randy. Brad especially became a key figure behind the scenes by helping produce ICW's television show as well as driving the ring truck and [[wrestling ring|setting up the ring]].<ref name="Simms"/>

They made their pro debut on May 12, 1983, against Tony Falk and Doug Vines in [[Prestonsburg, Kentucky]].<ref name="OWOW"/><ref>{{cite news |author=Landon, Chuck |date=May 11, 2011 |title=Chuck Landon: Savage died too young, like many pro wrestlers |url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/sports/x1656188875/Savage-died-too-young-like-many-pro-wrestlers |newspaper=[[The Herald-Dispatch]] |location=[[Huntington, West Virginia]] |publisher=Edward Dawson }}</ref> <!-- News article claims match took place in Mullens, West Virginia --> Brad was injured shortly after their debut when he blew out his left knee performing a jumping [[high five]] and toe kick with his brother.

They remained champions until the promotion's close the following year.<ref name="Titles"/>

===Continental Wrestling Association (1984–1985) ===
After ICW's close, Brad Batten began working for rival promoter [[Jerry Jarrett]]'s [[Continental Wrestling Association]] promotion in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Wrestling under the name "Mark Batten", he made his first appearance at the [[Mid-South Coliseum]] teaming with [[Porkchop Cash]] against [[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship|AWA Southern Tag Team Champions]] [[Tommy Rich]] and [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]] on April 30, 1984. Following their loss, Batten formed a new tag team with Johnny Wilhoit called "The New Generation".<ref name="Simms"/> A music video filmed on Jarrett's estate near [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] was aired on ''Memphis Championship Wrestling'' to introduce the team; it became a [[viral video]] after it was shown by [[Jon Stewart]] on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' nearly thirty years later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kentuckyfriedwrestling.com/theword2/lets-hear-it-for-the-boy-jon-stewart-airs-clip-of-memphis-wrestlings-new-generation-music-video-on-the-daily-show/ |title=Let's hear it for the boy: Jon Stewart airs clip of Memphis wrestling's New Generation music video on 'The Daily Show' |author=Bowden, Scott |date=August 9, 2011 |website=KentuckyFriedWrestling.com }}</ref> The team was intended to capitalize on the popularity of [[The Fabulous Ones]] and [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] but they failed to catch on with fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cagesideseats.com/2010/1/24/1267140/great-moments-in-wrestling-history |title=Great Moments in Wrestling History: Mark Batten & Johnny Wilhoit are the New Generation |author=Bixepnsan, David |date=January 24, 2010 |website=CagesideSeats.com }}</ref> The New Generation's last match was against The Dirty White Boys ([[Tony Anthony]] and [[Len Denton]]) at the Mid-South Coliseum on October 8, 1984, which they lost.<ref name="Darkangel-CWA">{{cite web |url=http://www.savatage.com/wrest/usa/memphis.html |title=MEMPHIS TV |website=Savatage.com |publisher=Darkangel DVD }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/memphis/jarrett/1984.html |title=Mid-South Coliseum 1984 (Jarrett) |website=ProWrestlingHistory.com }}</ref>

Brad was eventually joined by his brother and had their first match together against former trainers Lanny Poffo and Randy Savage.<ref name="Simms"/> At the end of year, the team had several matches against The Nightmares ([[Danny Davis (wrestler)|Danny Davis]] and Ken Wayne).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://prowresblog.blogspot.com/2013/07/cwa-memphis-championship-wrestlingl-tv.html |title=CWA Memphis Championship Wrestling TV 12/22/1984 Review |date=July 23, 2013 |website=ProWresBlog.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media | people=Continental Wrestling Association (Producer) | date=December 29, 1984 | title=Best of Memphis from the 80's, Vol. 6 (War Machine DVD) | medium=DVD | location=[[Memphis, Tennessee]] | publisher=WrestlingEpicenter.com}}</ref> The brothers also wrestled [[Uncle Elmer|Plowboy Frazier]] in three separate [[handicap match]]es at the Mid-South Coliseum between December 31, 1984 and January 28, 1985.

On February 11, the Battens got their revenge on Frazier when they finally beat him in a handicap match; due to the pre-match stipulations, the twins would have [[Professional wrestling match types#Luchas de Apuestas|lost their hair]] had they lost the match.<ref name="PWH-1985">{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/memphis/jarrett/1985.html |title=Mid-South Coliseum 1985 (Jarrett) |website=ProWrestlingHistory.com }}</ref>

===NWA Central States (1985–1986)===
The Batten Twins moved on to the [[Heart of America Sports Attractions|NWA's Central States territory]] where they had a long-running feud with Sheik Abdullah The Great and his various tag team partners, most often [[Akio Sato (wrestler)|Akio Sato]] and [[Tarzan Goto]],<ref name="KM1">{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/centralstates/cs23.htm |title=Regional Territories: Central States |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com }}</ref> but also including [[Dan Spivey|American Starship Coyote]] and [[Mr. Pogo]]. Within a few weeks of their arrival, they also received a title shot against [[NWA Central States Tag Team Championship|NWA Central States Tag Team Champions]] [[Bob Brown (wrestler)|"Bulldog" Bob Brown]] and [[Marty Jannetty]]. It was during this match that the champions split up when Brown stopped cooperating with his partner.

Their first title reign lasted three months before the championship was held-up following a title defense in [[Kansas City, Kansas]] against Sheik Abdullah and Akio Sato on February 20, 1986.

===World Class Championship Wrestling (1986)===
Bart and Brad Batten were brought into [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] during the summer of 1986. The team was renamed the U.S. Express and Bart given the name "Mark Batten".<ref name="Simms"/> One day after losing the NWA Central States belts, they made their WCCW television debut against [[Killer Tim Brooks|Killer Brooks]] and [[Matt Osborne|Matt Borne]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] on May 30, 1986.<ref name="WCM">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldclasswrestling.info/2013/07/results-1986.html |title=RESULTS: 1986  |author=Dananay, John |publisher=World Class Memories |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305121152/http://www.worldclasswrestling.info/2013/07/results-1986.html|archive-date=2016-03-05|url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="OWW-WCCW">{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wccw/ |title=World Class Championship Wrestling |publisher=Online World of Wrestling }}</ref>

On June 9, The Batten Twins and [[Steve Cohen (wrestler)|Steve Simpson]] beat Matt Borne, Killer Brooks and The Assassin in a six-man tag team match. During the next two months, The Battens scored victories over Jerry Allen and The Grapplers (Grappler #1 and Grappler #2). On July 11, they were beaten by Matt Borne and [[The Ultimate Warrior|The Dingo Warrior]]. A week later in [[Fort Worth]], both brothers wrestled in singles matches; Bart Batten was pinned by WCCW Television Champion [[Buzz Sawyer|"Mad Dog" Buzz Sawyer]], however, Brad Batten beat The Dingo Warrior via disqualification.<ref name="WCM"/><ref name="OWW-WCCW"/> After the Batten-Sawyer bout, Sawyer put Bart Batten in a [[gorilla press slam]] and tossed him over the top rope. He fell 20 feet onto the concrete floor. The WCCW TV Champion then attacked Brad Batten and Perry Jackson, who were coming to aid Bart, which instigated a 4-man brawl between Sawyer and Borne versus Steve Simpson and [[Kevin Von Erich]]. Brad Batten later talked with [[Fritz von Erich]] about booking the brothers as "heels" and suggested a "[[family feud|family vs. family]]" storyline pitting the Batten and [[Von Erich family|Von Erich brothers]] against each other but the promoter turned down the idea.<ref name="Simms"/>

At Labor Day Star Wars '86, The Batten Twins lost to [[Mark Lewin]] and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] in the opening rounds of championship tournament for the [[WCWA World Tag Team Championship]].

Three months later, Brad Batten and [[Bobby Jaggers]] were awarded the vacant titles by the NWA after Karl Kovac was fired and [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]] left to work in Japan. Batten and Jaggers split up two months later. The title was decided in a singles match between them on August 6, which Batten won.

===World Wrestling Council (1988–1989)===
After a brief stint in [[Southern Championship Wrestling (Georgia)|Southern Championship Wrestling]], The Batten Twins went to Puerto Rico to compete in the [[World Wrestling Council]] where they found considerable success. Their stay in the country was not without some controversy, however. The Battens were among the six American wrestlers who decided to remain after the murder of [[Bruiser Brody]] on July 17, 1988. ''[[Wrestling Observer]]'' editor [[Dave Meltzer]] speculated that the team may have had "[[Heat (professional wrestling)|legit heat]]" as they were the only wrestlers to leave a U.S. promotion to compete in Puerto Rico and "may have to stay there until this all blows over".<ref>{{cite news |author=[[Dave Meltzer|Meltzer, Dave]] |date=August 22, 1988 |title=Other |newspaper=[[Wrestling Observer]] |quote=The only U.S. wrestlers left in Puerto Rico are Bobby Jaggers, Dan Kroffat, Ron Starr, the Batten Twins, and Tony Falk. The rest left. "The wrestling grapevine indicates that there are no hard feelings towards the guys that were there and stayed, being that everyone understands you have to make money to feed your family. However in the case of the Battens, who left a U.S. promotion to go to Puerto Rico, they may have to stay there until this all blows over because there may be some hard feelings because of them going there." }}</ref> Bart Batten later defended their decision as they had families to support and could not afford to turn down bookings. The Battens had been fans of Brody prior to entering wrestling, later becoming friends with him while in NWA Central States and WCCW, and Brad felt that their old friend "wouldn't have held it against us".<ref name="Simms"/>

On August 6, they defeated The Ninja Express ([[Kendo Nagasaki]] and [[Mr. Pogo]]) in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] for the [[WWC Tag Team Championship]]. A month later at [[WWC Aniversario#1988|WWC Aniversario 1988]], the Battens retained the titles against [[The Sheepherders]] ([[Butch Miller (wrestler)|Butch Miller]] and [[Luke Williams (wrestler)|Luke Williams]]). The Sheepherders had initially been declared the winners after Miller had interfered in the match by hitting Brad in the head with a flagpole.

===Retirement tour (2005)===
In April 2005, the Batten Twins announced their retirement<ref name="GalionInquirer"/> and would be going on one last wrestling tour throughout their home state of West Virginia.<ref name="PWInsider"/> The reason behind their decision to retire was partly because the brothers "didn't want to be a [[Gypsy Joe]]" and risk serious injury due to their ages. Brad Batten had also met a woman in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and wanted to move out of the state to live with her.<ref name="Simms"/> The two were married three years later.<ref name="MNJ"/> On May 21, 2005, The Batten Twins wrestled their last match with Bart’s son, Brent Batten, defeating "Superstar" Shane Matthews, Chris Vega and J.V. Insanity in [[Bradley, West Virginia]].<ref name="OWOW"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wvwrestling.com/latestresults.html |title=Latest Results |date=October 2005 |publisher=WVwrestling.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102065451/http://www.wvwrestling.com/latestresults.html |archive-date=November 2, 2005 }}</ref>

==Post-retirement==
While his brother left for Cleveland, Bart continued to be involved in the local independent circuit. He was the [[color commentator]] for the [[Bluefield, West Virginia]]-based All Pro Wrestling and hosted Network West Virginia's Monday night show ''Mountain State Wrestling TV''.<ref name="OWOW"/> On July 5, 2014, Bart Batten appeared with fellow [[Smokey Mountain Wrestling]] alumni [[Bobby Blaze]], [[Jim Cornette]] and [[Mick Foley]] for Bluegrass Championship Wrestling's "Rumble on the River" show in [[Ashland, Kentucky]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Walker, Jim |date=June 28, 2014 |title=Rumble on River at Summer Motion |url=http://www.irontontribune.com/2014/06/28/rumble-on-river-at-summer-motion/ |newspaper=Ironton Tribune }}</ref>

Brad Batten left West Virginia after retiring from pro wrestling. He later settled in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Crestline]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Ohio]] where he lived with his wife for several years. Batten died at the [[Ohio State University Medical Center]] on November 18, 2014 after suffering a sudden heart attack near his home.<ref name="GalionInquirer" /><ref name="411mania" /><ref name="MNJ" /><ref name="f4wonline" /> The news was announced by the World Wrestling Council on its official [[Facebook]] page.<ref name="PWInsider" />

On January 21, 2015, Bart Batten was a guest on the ''World Domination with Terry Garvin Simms'' podcast with retired wrestler Terry Simms. He discussed his reaction to Brad's death and revealed that both of them had become [[Born again (Christianity)|born again Christians]] after they had split up. It was not until Bart Batten called up his brother that he discovered they had unknowingly done so on exactly the same day. Bart talked about training with the Poffo family in ICW and their NWA career during the [[1980s wrestling boom]]. He was also very critical of the modern wrestling industry and blamed [[Vince McMahon]] for "destroying the [NWA] territories".<ref name="Simms"/> Both Garvin and Downtown Bruno have maintained that the Battens would have been major stars had they been given the opportunity by the bigger territories.<ref name="Simms"/><ref name="Guttman"/>
