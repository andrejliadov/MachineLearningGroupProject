The MRM in particular consists of a variety of groups and individuals who focus on general [[social issue]]s and specific government services which adversely impact, or in some cases [[Structural discrimination|structurally discriminate]] against, [[men]] and [[boys]]. Common topics debated within the men's rights movement include the alleged favor given to women in [[family law]] including but not limited to matters such as [[child custody]], [[alimony]] and marital property distribution. The movement also concerns itself with parenting, reproduction, suicides, [[domestic violence against men]], [[circumcision]], education, [[conscription]], [[social safety net]]s, and health policies. The men's rights movement branched off from the [[men's liberation movement]] in the early 1970s, with both groups comprising a part of the larger [[men's movement]].

Since its inception, the men's rights movement has received substantial criticism, with some scholars describing the movement or parts of it as a [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] against [[feminism]].<ref name=backlash/> Claims and activities associated with the men's rights movement have been criticized and labeled hateful and violent.<ref>{{cite web| last = Goldwag | first = Arthur |title=Hatewatch: Intelligence report article provokes fury among Men's Rights Activists |url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2012/05/15/intelligence-report-article-provokes-fury-among-mens-rights-activists |department=splcenter.org/hatewatch|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]| date = May 15, 2012 |access-date = May 5, 2017 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Men's rights movement: why it is so controversial? |url=https://www.theweek.co.uk/people/62607/mens-rights-movement-why-it-is-so-controversial |access-date=19 March 2019 |magazine=[[The Week]] |date=19 February 2015}}</ref> In 2018, while noting "some corners of the men's rights movement focused on legitimate grievances," the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] categorized some men's rights groups as being part of a hate ideology under the umbrella of 'male supremacy' (see: [[androcentrism]] and [[patriarchy]]).<ref name=":4">{{Cite news |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/male-supremacy |title=Male Supremacy |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Russell-Kraft |first1=Stephanie |title=The Rise of Male Supremacist Groups |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/147744/rise-male-supremacist-groups |access-date=19 March 2019 |work=[[The New Republic]] |date=4 April 2018}}</ref> The movement and sectors of the movement have been described as [[Misogyny|misogynistic]].<ref name="Ruzankina">{{Cite journal | last = Ruzankina | first = E.A. | title = Men's movements and male subjectivity|journal = Anthropology & Archeology of Eurasia | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–16 | doi = 10.2753/aae1061-1959490101 | date = 2010 | s2cid = 144841265 }}</ref><ref name=":2" />

Three loosely connected men's rights organizations formed in [[Austria]] in the [[interwar period]]. The ''League for Men's Rights'' was founded in 1926 with the goal of "combating all excesses of women's emancipation".<ref name=geschichtsblaetter>{{Cite journal |title= Der 'Bund für Männerrechte'.

==Issues==
Men's rights proponents are concerned with a wide variety of matters, some of which have spawned their own groups or movements, such as the [[fathers' rights movement]], concerned specifically with [[divorce]] and [[child custody]] issues.{{sfn |Messner | 1997 |p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nG8MGcopgWQC&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=false 41–48] }} Some, if not all, men's rights issues stem from [[gender roles]] and, according to sociologist Allan Johnson, [[patriarchy]].<ref name="johnson">{{cite book | title=The Gender Knot: Unraveling our Patriarchal Legacy | publisher=Temple University Press | author=Johnson, Allan G. | year=2005 | location=Philadelphia | isbn=978-1592133833 | page=220 | quote= such problems are prominent in many men's lives, but this is no organized male response to the patriarchal system whose dynamics produce much of men's loss, suffering, and grief. Contrary to Bly's claim, it is not a parallel to the women's movement that is merely on a "different timetable." It may be a response to genuine emotional and spiritual needs that are met by bringing men together to drum, chant, and share stories and feelings from their lives. It may help to heal some of the damage patriarchy does to men's lives. But it is not a movement aimed at the system and the gender dynamics that actually cause that damage.}}</ref>

Another study has also found gender differences in academic achievement not being reliably linked to gender policies, and that female academic achievement is greater than boys' in 70% of studied countries around the world.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = Gijsbert | last2 = Geary | first2 = David C. | title = Sex differences in academic achievement are not related to political, economic, or social equality | journal = [[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]] | volume = 48 | pages = 137–151 | doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2014.11.006 | date = January–February 2015 }}</ref> However, this is contradicted in Australia by ACARA's independent NAPLAN findings that "Since their introduction, a subtle but consistent pattern of gender differences in performance on the NAPLAN tests has emerged, with boys regularly outperforming girls in numeracy, and girls consistently outperforming boys in the reading, writing, spelling, and grammar and punctuation components".<ref name="ro.ecu.edu.au">{{cite journal | last1 = Leder | first1 = Gilah C. | last2 = Forgasz | first2 = Helen J. | last3 = Jackson | first3 = Glenda  | title = Mathematics, English and Gender Issues: Do Teachers Count? | journal = Australian Journal of Teacher Education | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | page = 2 | doi = 10.14221/ajte.2014v39n9.3 | date = September 2014 | doi-access = free }} [http://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2393&context=ajte Pdf.]</ref> To further add to the confusion with other evidence presented, there has been an obvious, unexplained and significant drop in the number of boys at university in most countries.

Men's rights groups call for increased recognition of masculinity, greater numbers of male role models, more competitive sports, and the increased responsibilities for boys in the school setting. They have also advocated clearer school routines, more traditional school structures, including gender-[[Segregated education|segregated]] classrooms, and stricter discipline.<ref name="FrancisSkelton2005"/>

Critics suggest that men's rights groups view boys as a homogeneous group sharing common experiences of schooling and that they fail to account for how responses to educational approaches may differ by age, disability, culture, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, and class.<ref name="FrancisSkelton2005"/>

In Australia, men's rights discourse has influenced government policy documents. Compared to Australia, less impact has been noted in the United Kingdom, where feminists have historically had less influence on educational policy.<ref name="MartinoKehler2009"/> However, [[Mary Curnock Cook]], the British [[Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS) chief executive, argued that in Britain "despite the clear evidence and despite the press coverage, there is a deafening policy silence on the issue. Has the women’s movement now become so normalised that we cannot conceive of needing to take positive action to secure equal education outcomes for boys?”<ref name="theguardian.com"/>

===Paternity fraud===
{{Main|Non-paternity event|Paternity fraud}}
Men's and fathers' rights groups interest in "paternity fraud" or mistaken paternity falls into two main categories: men who are compelled to provide financial support for a child that has been proven by DNA testing not to be their biological offspring, and men who have been led to believe that the children they are raising are their own, and have subsequently discovered otherwise.<ref name=cannold/> Campaigners claim that between 10% and 30% of children are being parented by men who are unaware that they are not the biological father.<ref name=cannold/> They hold biological views of fatherhood, emphasizing the imperative of the genetic foundation of paternity rather than social aspects of fatherhood.<ref name=cannold/><ref name="RothsteinMurray2005">{{cite book|author=Majumber, Mary Anderlik|editor=Mark A.

To argue the issue of false accusations of rape, the categories of 'false' and 'unsubstantiated' are often conflated, such as the [[National Coalition for Men]] citing reports like the 1996 FBI summary that finds a rate of 8% for unsubstantiated forcible rape, which is four times higher than the average for all [[index crimes]] as a whole.<ref name="ncfmrape" /> Experts emphasize that ''verified'' false allegations are a distinct category from unsubstantiated allegations, and conflating the two is fallacious.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lisak|first1=David|last2=Gardinier|first2=Lori|last3=Nicksa|first3=Sarah C.|last4=Cote|first4=Ashley M.|date=December 2010|title=False allegations of sexual assault: an analysis of ten years of reported cases|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=16|issue=12|pages=1318–1334|doi=10.1177/1077801210387747|issn=1552-8448|pmid=21164210|s2cid=15377916|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9a9032d04ac28103a8cf550f5232876fd4e97e8e}}</ref> These figures are widely debated due to the questionable methodology and small sample sizes - see the [[False accusation of rape]] page for wider survey estimates.

Men's rights activists have also raised contention on the issue of sexual violence against men, especially in the context of the stigma surrounding male victims of rape and the legal troubles they face, including being counter-sued for rape, child support (See [[Hermesmann v.

==== Critique of men's rights rape discourse ====

Feminist scholars Lise Gotell and Emily Dutton argue that content on the [[manosphere]] reveals anti-feminist pro-rape arguments, including that sexual violence is a gender-neutral problem, feminists are responsible for erasing men's experiences of victimization, false allegations are widespread, and that [[rape culture]] is a feminist-produced moral panic. They contend it is important to engage [this topic] as there is a real danger that MRA (Men's Rights Activism) claims could come to define the popular conversation about sexual violence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gotell|first=Lise|year=2016|title=Sexual Violence in the 'Manosphere': Antifeminist Men's Rights Discourses on Rape|journal=International Journal for Crime, Justice and Social Democracy|volume=5|issue=2|pages=65–80|doi=10.5204/ijcjsd.v5i2.310|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In consequence, some advocate for paper abortion, which would allow the [[biological father]], before the birth of the child, to opt out of any rights, privileges, and responsibilities toward the child, including [[Child support|financial support]]. 

In 2006, the American National Center for Men backed [[Dubay v.

Professor Ruth M. Mann of the [[University of Windsor]] in Canada suggests that men's rights groups fuel an international rhetoric of hatred and victimization by disseminating misinformation via online forums and websites containing constantly-updated "diatribes against feminism, ex-wives, child support, shelters, and the family law and criminal justice systems."<ref name=":0" /> According to Mann, these stories reignite their hatred and reinforce their beliefs that the system is biased against men and that feminism is responsible for a large scale and ongoing "cover-up" of men's victimization. Mann says that although existing legislation in Canada acknowledges that men are ''also'' victims of domestic violence, men's rights advocates demand government recognition that men are equally or ''more'' victimized by domestic violence, claims not supported by the data.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.brown.uk.com/domesticviolence/mann.pdf|title = Men's Rights and Feminist Advocacy in Canadian Domestic Violence Policy Arenas.|last = Mann|first = Ruth M.|date = 2008|journal = Feminist Criminology| volume = 3| issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/1557085107311067|pages=44–75|citeseerx = 10.1.1.413.6328|s2cid = 145502648}}</ref> Mann also states that in contrast to feminist groups, who have advocated for domestic violence services on behalf of other historically oppressed groups in addition to women, such as individuals impacted by poverty, ethnicity, disability, [[sexual orientation]], etc., men's rights groups have attempted to achieve their goals by actively opposing and attempting to dismantle services and supports put in place to protect abused women and children.<ref name=":0" />
