'''Sidi Abdul-Rahman al-Tha'alibi''' ({{lang-ar|أبو زيد عـبـد الـرحـمـن بن مـخـلـوف الـثـعـالـبـي}} ''Abu Zayd‘Abd al-Raḥmān ibn Makhlūf ath-Tha‘ālibī'') (1384 CE/785 [[Hijri year|AH]] – 1479 CE/875 [[Hijri year|AH]])  was born near the town of [[Issers|Isser]] 86&nbsp;km south east of [[Algiers]]. He was raised in a very spiritual environment with high Islamic values and ethics.<ref>[http://islamictourism.com/PDFs/Issue%2029/English/48.pdf islamictourism.com]</ref> He had great interpersonal skills and devoted his entire life in service of the most deprived, to [[dhikr]] of [[Allah]], and to writing of over 100 books and treatises.

He has become a symbol of [[Algiers]], which has become known as the "city of sidi Abder Rahman."

== Birth and Lineage ==
Sidi Abdul-Rahman al-Tha'alibi was born in the year 1384 CE/785 [[Hijri year|AH]] in [[Issers|Isser]] in modern-day [[Boumerdès Province]] into a pious family with a lineage going back to [[Ja'far ibn Abi Talib]]. His Arab [[Maqil]]lian tribe, [[Tha'aliba]], had long governed several regions of Algeria from 1204 CE to 1515 CE. In 1378 CE, their reign had fallen into the hands of [[Abu Hammu II]], the Sultan of the [[Kingdom of Tlemcen]].

His full lineage is Abu Zaid Abdul Rahman bin Muhammad bin Makhlouf bin Talha bin Amer bin Noufal bin Amer bin Mussour bin Muhammad bin Saba'a bin Makki bin Thalabah bin Musa bin Saeed bin Mufaddal bin Abdul Bar bin Fisi bin Hilal bin Amer bin Hassan bin Muhammad bin [[Ja'far ibn Abi Talib]].

== Biography ==
When 15 years old, Sidi Abdul-Rahman, with his father Sidi Mohamed Ben Makhlouf, went to Morocco for studies where he met the Muslim scholar Sidi Mohamed Ibn Marzoug Al Adrissi. In 1392, he made another trip to [[Bejaia]] (200&nbsp;km east of [[Algiers]]) seeking knowledge where his father died. He stayed in [[Bejaia]] for 7 years studying Islamic sciences. There he learned from disciples of [[Abdurrahman El-Waghlissi]] (d. 1383 CE), such as Abû al-Husayn al-Mangalâtî.

Then 24 years old, he travelled to [[Tunis]] in 1406 where he stayed for eight years. He met the [[sheikh]]s Mohammed Ibn Khalf al-Ubay and Abû al-Mahdi al-Ghabrînî (d. 1413 CE) who introduced him to [[Sufism]] and [[tafsir]].

He then traveled to [[Cairo]] in 1414 where he stayed with Walî Eddîn al-'Irâqî (d. 1422 CE). Then he traveled to [[Bursa]] in [[Turkey]], where he was well received and a shrine was erected in his honour which remains an endowment for this saintly man.

He returned to [[Tunisia]] once again, where he always received a warm welcome. Here he wrote: "I noticed in those times, by the grace of God, there was no one in Tunisia who could be higher than me in the sciences of hadith ('ilm al-hadith). If I happened to speak, everyone listened to me attentively and accepted what I reported to them, out of modesty on their part and because they were people who knew how to recognize the truth. Some Moroccans once confessed to me: 'seeing you coming from the last of the East, by the grace of God, some saw in you the sign of tradition (ayat al-hadith).' And despite that, whenever I heard of an assembly where hadith were taught, I hastened to attend. May God make this act done only to satisfy Him, and may He keep us from vanity and ostentation."

From Tunisia at the age of 32, Sidi Abdul-Rahman went to perform [[Hajj]] to [[Mecca]], ending his initial travels in search of knowledge. After the Hajj he returned to his native Algeria after 20 years. It is said that while walking the streets of the [[Casbah of Algiers]], he heard a young man recite verse 34:15 of the [[Qur'an]]: ''"...Eat from the provisions of your Lord and be grateful to Him. A good land [have you], and a forgiving Lord."'' He said "this is a beautiful omen!" And he resolved to settle there permanently in Algiers for the rest of his life.

He was entrusted the title of Supreme Magistracy ([[qadi]]) by the authorities, but he preferred to abandon all honors and devote himself to asceticism and [[Sufism]]. He said "there are signs which show that if someone's love for the prophet of God is sincere, then it is necessary for them to give up the pleasures of this low world, to choose poverty, and to live it." He also said that one night he saw a dream of the prophet [[Muhammad]] standing and offering food to the poor. He gave a large part of it to Abd al-Rahman al-Tha'alibi and then said, "when the prophet gives food to someone, shouldn't he immediately vomit it up?" He replied, "should I vomit?" The prophet bowed down and said "this is not what I meant!" After this dream which left him perplexed, he came to understand its interpretation that he was simply commanded to "devote himself into initiating people into the path of God."

He taught in the [[Djamaa el Kebir]] mosque until he died on the Friday of 23rd of Ramadan 875 AH, the 15th of March 1479 after dedicating 95 years of his life to serve Islam and Muslims. His [[Salat al-Janazah|funeral]] was attended by many prominent scholars and political leaders, including [[Ahmad Zarruq]] and [[Ahmed Zouaoui]]. He was buried in [[Thaalibia Cemetery]] next to his sheikh sidi [[Abi Djamaa Al Maknassi]] in the [[Casbah of Algiers]].<ref name="thaalibi bio">{{cite web |title=Le Cheikh – at-Thaâlibî |url=http://www.thaalibi.com/fr/le-cheikh/ |website=Association Sidi Abderrahmane At-Thaalibi |accessdate=29 April 2020 |language=fr-FR}}</ref>

== Zawiya ==
[[File:Sidi Abder Rahman of Algiers.png|thumb|150px|[[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiya]] (shrine) of Sidi Abder Rahman, in the [[Casbah of Algiers]]]]
The ''[[Zawiya (institution)|zawiya]]'' contains his tomb, though it is a misnomer since it does not contain any Sufi [[tariqa|order]] in the building. Currently the location houses the tombs of several Algerian historical figures. The first construction dates to 1611 CE and has gone through several changes and additions since, with little left of the original today. In 1696 Dey al-Hadj Ahmed al-Euldji decided to turn it into a funeral mosque. More tombs have been added over the years. Today the mausoleum is often visited by locals of Algiers, especially on [[Friday prayer|Fridays]] and [[Eid prayers|religious holidays]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Zawiya Sidi Abd al-Rahman |url=https://archnet.org/sites/5387 |website=Archnet |accessdate=29 April 2020}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
He left a legacy of more than 100 books, among which the most important was ''Al Jawahir Al hassān fi Tafsir Al Koran'' (''the fine pearls in the exegesis of the Koran'').

In his lifetime (1384-1479 CE) the region was split into three states whose legal schools stood out: [[Tunis]], [[Tlemcen]] and [[Fez]]. The city of [[Algiers]] offered little in comparison in terms of religious and cultural pull. It had very few religious schools for teaching the [[Qur'an]], [[hadith]], and [[fiqh|legal texts]]. Economically it also waned in comparison to other cities in the region. Abd al-Rahman al-Tha'alibi's founding of the ''Tha'alibiyya'' school attracted many students from all over the world. Families moved into the surrounding area which turned into a place of religious education and training. From then on, Algiers became known as "The city of Sidi Abd al-Rahman."<ref name="thaalibi bio"/>

He is not to be confused with [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Thalabi]].

Sidi Abdul-Rahman al-Tha'alibi was born in the year 1384 CE/785 [[Hijri year|AH]] in [[Issers|Isser]] in modern-day [[Boumerdès Province]] into a pious family with a lineage going back to [[Ja'far ibn Abi Talib]].

[[File:Sidi Abder Rahman of Algiers.png|thumb|150px|[[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiya]] (shrine) of Sidi Abder Rahman, in the [[Casbah of Algiers]]]]
The ''[[Zawiya (institution)|zawiya]]'' contains his tomb, though it is a misnomer since it does not contain any Sufi [[tariqa|order]] in the building. Currently the location houses the tombs of several Algerian historical figures. The first construction dates to 1611 CE and has gone through several changes and additions since, with little left of the original today. In 1696 Dey al-Hadj Ahmed al-Euldji decided to turn it into a funeral mosque. More tombs have been added over the years. Today the mausoleum is often visited by locals of Algiers, especially on [[Friday prayer|Fridays]] and [[Eid prayers|religious holidays]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Zawiya Sidi Abd al-Rahman |url=https://archnet.org/sites/5387 |website=Archnet |accessdate=29 April 2020}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
He left a legacy of more than 100 books, among which the most important was ''Al Jawahir Al hassān fi Tafsir Al Koran'' (''the fine pearls in the exegesis of the Koran'').

In his lifetime (1384-1479 CE) the region was split into three states whose legal schools stood out: [[Tunis]], [[Tlemcen]] and [[Fez]]. The city of [[Algiers]] offered little in comparison in terms of religious and cultural pull. It had very few religious schools for teaching the [[Qur'an]], [[hadith]], and [[fiqh|legal texts]]. Economically it also waned in comparison to other cities in the region. Abd al-Rahman al-Tha'alibi's founding of the ''Tha'alibiyya'' school attracted many students from all over the world. Families moved into the surrounding area which turned into a place of religious education and training. From then on, Algiers became known as "The city of Sidi Abd al-Rahman."<ref name="thaalibi bio"/>

He is not to be confused with [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Thalabi]].

'''Sidi Abdul-Rahman al-Tha'alibi''' ({{lang-ar|أبو زيد عـبـد الـرحـمـن بن مـخـلـوف الـثـعـالـبـي}} ''Abu Zayd‘Abd al-Raḥmān ibn Makhlūf ath-Tha‘ālibī'') (1384 CE/785 [[Hijri year|AH]] – 1479 CE/875 [[Hijri year|AH]])  was born near the town of [[Issers|Isser]] 86&nbsp;km south east of [[Algiers]]. He was raised in a very spiritual environment with high Islamic values and ethics.<ref>[http://islamictourism.com/PDFs/Issue%2029/English/48.pdf islamictourism.com]</ref> He had great interpersonal skills and devoted his entire life in service of the most deprived, to [[dhikr]] of [[Allah]], and to writing of over 100 books and treatises.

He has become a symbol of [[Algiers]], which has become known as the "city of sidi Abder Rahman."

== Birth and Lineage ==
Sidi Abdul-Rahman al-Tha'alibi was born in the year 1384 CE/785 [[Hijri year|AH]] in [[Issers|Isser]] in modern-day [[Boumerdès Province]] into a pious family with a lineage going back to [[Ja'far ibn Abi Talib]]. His Arab [[Maqil]]lian tribe, [[Tha'aliba]], had long governed several regions of Algeria from 1204 CE to 1515 CE. In 1378 CE, their reign had fallen into the hands of [[Abu Hammu II]], the Sultan of the [[Kingdom of Tlemcen]].

His full lineage is Abu Zaid Abdul Rahman bin Muhammad bin Makhlouf bin Talha bin Amer bin Noufal bin Amer bin Mussour bin Muhammad bin Saba'a bin Makki bin Thalabah bin Musa bin Saeed bin Mufaddal bin Abdul Bar bin Fisi bin Hilal bin Amer bin Hassan bin Muhammad bin [[Ja'far ibn Abi Talib]].

== Biography ==
When 15 years old, Sidi Abdul-Rahman, with his father Sidi Mohamed Ben Makhlouf, went to Morocco for studies where he met the Muslim scholar Sidi Mohamed Ibn Marzoug Al Adrissi. In 1392, he made another trip to [[Bejaia]] (200&nbsp;km east of [[Algiers]]) seeking knowledge where his father died. He stayed in [[Bejaia]] for 7 years studying Islamic sciences. There he learned from disciples of [[Abdurrahman El-Waghlissi]] (d. 1383 CE), such as Abû al-Husayn al-Mangalâtî.

Then 24 years old, he travelled to [[Tunis]] in 1406 where he stayed for eight years. He met the [[sheikh]]s Mohammed Ibn Khalf al-Ubay and Abû al-Mahdi al-Ghabrînî (d. 1413 CE) who introduced him to [[Sufism]] and [[tafsir]].

He then traveled to [[Cairo]] in 1414 where he stayed with Walî Eddîn al-'Irâqî (d. 1422 CE). Then he traveled to [[Bursa]] in [[Turkey]], where he was well received and a shrine was erected in his honour which remains an endowment for this saintly man.

He returned to [[Tunisia]] once again, where he always received a warm welcome. Here he wrote: "I noticed in those times, by the grace of God, there was no one in Tunisia who could be higher than me in the sciences of hadith ('ilm al-hadith). If I happened to speak, everyone listened to me attentively and accepted what I reported to them, out of modesty on their part and because they were people who knew how to recognize the truth. Some Moroccans once confessed to me: 'seeing you coming from the last of the East, by the grace of God, some saw in you the sign of tradition (ayat al-hadith).' And despite that, whenever I heard of an assembly where hadith were taught, I hastened to attend. May God make this act done only to satisfy Him, and may He keep us from vanity and ostentation."

From Tunisia at the age of 32, Sidi Abdul-Rahman went to perform [[Hajj]] to [[Mecca]], ending his initial travels in search of knowledge. After the Hajj he returned to his native Algeria after 20 years. It is said that while walking the streets of the [[Casbah of Algiers]], he heard a young man recite verse 34:15 of the [[Qur'an]]: ''"...Eat from the provisions of your Lord and be grateful to Him. A good land [have you], and a forgiving Lord."'' He said "this is a beautiful omen!" And he resolved to settle there permanently in Algiers for the rest of his life.

He was entrusted the title of Supreme Magistracy ([[qadi]]) by the authorities, but he preferred to abandon all honors and devote himself to asceticism and [[Sufism]]. He said "there are signs which show that if someone's love for the prophet of God is sincere, then it is necessary for them to give up the pleasures of this low world, to choose poverty, and to live it." He also said that one night he saw a dream of the prophet [[Muhammad]] standing and offering food to the poor. He gave a large part of it to Abd al-Rahman al-Tha'alibi and then said, "when the prophet gives food to someone, shouldn't he immediately vomit it up?" He replied, "should I vomit?" The prophet bowed down and said "this is not what I meant!" After this dream which left him perplexed, he came to understand its interpretation that he was simply commanded to "devote himself into initiating people into the path of God."

He taught in the [[Djamaa el Kebir]] mosque until he died on the Friday of 23rd of Ramadan 875 AH, the 15th of March 1479 after dedicating 95 years of his life to serve Islam and Muslims. His [[Salat al-Janazah|funeral]] was attended by many prominent scholars and political leaders, including [[Ahmad Zarruq]] and [[Ahmed Zouaoui]]. He was buried in [[Thaalibia Cemetery]] next to his sheikh sidi [[Abi Djamaa Al Maknassi]] in the [[Casbah of Algiers]].<ref name="thaalibi bio">{{cite web |title=Le Cheikh – at-Thaâlibî |url=http://www.thaalibi.com/fr/le-cheikh/ |website=Association Sidi Abderrahmane At-Thaalibi |accessdate=29 April 2020 |language=fr-FR}}</ref>
