'''Hierarchical scale''' is a technique used in art, mostly in [[sculpture]] and [[painting]], in which the artist uses unnatural size or [[scale (ratio)|scale]] to depict the relative importance of the figures in the artwork.

For example, in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] times, people of higher status would sometimes be drawn or sculpted larger than those of lower status.

During the Dark Ages, people with more status had larger proportions than serfs. During the Renaissance images of the human body began to change, as proportion was used to depict the reality an artist interpreted.
