{{short description|Proto-Indo-European mytheme}}
The '''Divine Twins''' are youthful horsemen, either gods or demigods, who serve as rescuers and healers in [[Proto-Indo-European mythology]].{{Sfn|Jackson|2002|p=78}}

Like other figures found in Indo-European myths, the Divine Twins are not directly attested by archaeological or written materials, but scholars of [[comparative mythology]] and [[Indo-European studies]] generally agree on the motif they have reconstructed by way of the [[comparative method]].{{sfn|West|2007|p=187}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=161}}

== Name ==
Although the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] name of the Divine Twins cannot be reconstructed with certainty based on the available linguistic evidence, the most frequent epithets associated with the two brothers in liturgic and poetic traditions are the "Youthful" and the "Sons" (or "Grandsons") of the Sky-God ([[Dyeus|Dyēus]]).{{Sfn|Jackson|2002|p=67}}{{sfn|West|2007|p=187–191}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=161}}

Two well-accepted descendants of the Divine Twins, the Vedic [[Aśvins]] and the Lithuanian [[Ašvieniai]], are linguistic [[cognate]]s ultimately deriving from the Proto-Indo-European word for the [[horse]], ''*h₁éḱwos''. They are related to [[Vedic Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] ''áśva'' and [[Avestan]] ''aspā'' (both deriving from [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Indo-Iranian]] ''*aćua''), and to [[Lithuanian language|Old Lithuanian]] ''ašva'', which all share the meaning of "[[mare]]".{{Sfn|Derksen|2015|p=65}}<ref name=":0">Lubotsky, Alexander.

See entry ''áśva-'' (online database).</ref>

== Role ==
Represented as young men rescuing mortals from peril in battle or at sea, the Divine Twins rode the steeds that pull the sun across the sky and were sometimes depicted as horses themselves.{{sfn|West|2007|p=188}} They shared a sister, the Dawn (*[[Hausōs|H₂éwsōs]]), also the daughter of the Sky-God (*[[Dyeus|Dyēus]]).{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=432}} The two brothers are generally portrayed as healers and helpers, travelling in miraculous vehicles in order to save shipwrecked mortals.{{Sfn|Jackson|2002|p=78}} They are often differentiated: one is represented as a physically strong and aggressive warrior, while the other is seen as a healer who rather gives attention to domestic duties, agrarian pursuits, or romantic adventures.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=161}}

In the Vedic, Greek and Baltic traditions, the Divine Twins similarly appear as the personifications of the morning and evening star.{{Sfn|Jackson|2002|p=78}} They are depicted as the lovers or the companions of a solar female deity, preferably the Sun's daughter but sometimes also the Dawn. In the majority of stories where they appear, the Divine Twins rescue the Dawn from a watery peril, a theme that emerged from their role as the solar steeds.{{sfn|West|2007|p=189}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=161}}

At night, the horses of the sun returned to the east in a golden boat, where they traversed the sea{{Efn|The northern [[Black Sea]] or the [[Sea of Azov]].{{sfn|West|2007|p=191}}|name=|group=lower-alpha}} to bring back the Sun into the sky each morning. During the day, they crossed the nocturnal sky in pursuit of their consort, the morning star. In what seems to be a later addition confined to Europe, they were said to take a rest at the end of the day on the "Isles of the Blessed", a land seating in the western sea which possessed magic apple orchards.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=161}} By the [[Bronze Age]], the Divine Twins were also represented as the coachmen of the horse-driven solar chariots.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=432}}

Three Indo-European traditions (Greek, Indic and Baltic) attest the [[mytheme]] of equestrian twins, all associated with the dawn or the sun's daughter. Although their names do not form a complete group of [[cognate]]s, they nonetheless share a similar epithet leading to a possible ancestral name, either the sons or grandsons of the sky-god [[Dyeus|Dyēus]].{{sfn|West|2007|p=187–191}}{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=161}}{{Sfn|Jackson|2002|p=67}}

=== Possible reflexes ===
Since they cannot be linked together to a common linguistic origin, other reflexes found in the Indo-European myths are less secured, although their motifs can be compared to that of the Divine Twins.{{sfn|West|2007|p=190}}

In one of the Irish myths involving [[Macha]], she is forced to race against the horses of King of [[Ulster]] while in late pregnancy. As a talented rider, she wins the race but starts giving birth to Fír and Fial immediately after crossing the finish line. The archetype is also partly matched by figures such as the Gallic sun god [[Belenus]], whose epithet ''Atepormaros'' meant "having good horses", [[Grannus]], who is associated with the healing goddess [[Sirona]] (her name means "star"), [[Maponos]] ("Son of God"), considered in Irish mythology as the son of [[The Dagda|Dagda]], associated with healing,{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=161-162}}<ref>Dexter, Miriam Robbins.

The [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon]] [[Hengist and Horsa]] are said to have come by the sea in response to a plea from the beleaguered British king [[Vortigern]].

The myth of the Icelandic settlers [[Ingólfr Arnarson]] and [[Hjörleifr Hróðmarsson]], which appears in the legendary account of the [[settlement of Iceland]], may contain several motifs of the Indo-European twin mytheme (being founders and brothers), also paralleling Hengist and Horsa.<ref>Verena Höfig.

An idol was found in 1969 on the [[Fischerinsel (Tollensesee)|Fischerinsel]] island, where the cult centres of the Slavic tribe of [[Veleti]] was located, depicting two male figures joined with their heads.

Another possible reflex may be found in [[Nakula]] and [[Sahadeva]].

In the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' epic, Nakula is described in terms of his exceptional beauty, warriorship and martial prowess, while Sahadeva is depicted as patient, wise, intelligent and a "learned man".

[[Image:Nida ThomasMann cottage.jpg|thumb|215x215px|[[Ašvieniai]], commonly called the ''little horses'', on the rooftop of a house in [[Nida, Lithuania]]]]The mytheme of the Divine Twins was widely popular in the Indo-European traditions, and evidence for their worship can be found from [[Scandinavia]] to the [[Near East]] as early as the [[Bronze Age]]. The motif was also adopted in non-Indo-European cultures, as attested by the [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan]] ''Tinas Clenar'', the "sons of Jupiter".{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=165}} There might also have been a worship of twin deities in Myceanean times, based on the presence of pairs of brothers or male twins in [[Attica]] and [[Boeotia]].<ref>Buck, Robert J. ''A History of Boeotia''. the University of Alberta Press. 1979. p. 57. {{ISBN|}}</ref>

The most prevalent functions associated with the twins in later myths are magic healers and physicians, sailors and saviours at sea, warriors and providers of divine aid in battle, controllers of weather and keepers of the wind, assistants at birth with a connection to fertility, divinities of dance, protectors of the oath, and founders of cities, sometimes related to swans.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|1997|page=161}}{{Sfn|Shapiro|1982|p=}} Scholarship suggests that the mytheme of twins has echoes in the medieval legend of ''[[Amis et Amiles|Amicus and Amelius]]'',<ref>Shapiro, Marianne. “‘AMI ET AMILE’ AND MYTHS OF DIVINE TWINSHIP.” Romanische Forschungen, vol. 102, no. 2/3, 1990, pp. 131–148.

Literary approaches to the mytheme of the Indo-European Divine Twins can be found in ''Zeus, a Study in Ancient Religion'' (1925), by [[Arthur Bernard Cook]]. The British scholar posits that some versions of ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', collected from [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Albania]]n sources, contain some remnants of Helen and her brothers, the Dioskouroi, in the characters of the wonder-children (triplets or two male/one female siblings) with astronomical motifs on their bodies.<ref>Cook, Arthur Bernard.
