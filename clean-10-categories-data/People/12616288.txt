Augustus was born Gaius Octavius Thurinus in [[Rome]] on September 23, 63 BC.<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#5 5–6].</ref> He was a member of the respectable, but undistinguished, [[Octavii]] family through his father, also named [[Gaius Octavius (praetor 61 BC)|Gaius Octavius]], and was the great-nephew of [[Julius Caesar]] through his mother [[Atia Balba Caesonia]]. The young Octavius had two older siblings: a half sister, [[Octavia Major]], from his father's first marriage, and a full sister, [[Octavia Minor]]. The Octavii were wealthy through their banking business in [[Velletri]] (in the [[Alban Hills]]), where the family was part of the local aristocracy. However, the family entered into the [[Roman Senate|senatorial]] ranks with the elder Octavius as its [[novus homo]]. The elder Octavius' entrance into the Senate came when he was appointed [[Quaestor]] in 69 BC.

In 61 BC the elder Octavius was elected [[Praetor]]. Following his praetorship, he would serve for two years as [[Roman governor|governor]] of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].<ref>Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#1 1–4].</ref> There, he proved himself a capable administrator. Upon returning to Italy in 59 BC, before he could stand for the [[Roman consul|Consulship]], he suddenly died in [[Nola]]. This left the young Octavius, then four years old, without a father.

Octavius' mother Atia took over his education in the absence of his father. He was taught as the average Roman aristocratic boy was, learning both [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] while being trained as an [[orator]]. When Octavius was six years old Atia remarried to [[Lucius Marcius Philippus (consul 56 BC)|Lucius Marcius Philippus]], a supporter of Julius Caesar and a former governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]].<ref>Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#4 4–8]; [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], ''[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/nicolaus.html Augustus]'' 3.</ref> Philippus cherished his new stepchildren as if they were his own. He was consul of 56 BC with [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus]].

At  this time, the [[First Triumvirate]] between Julius Caesar, [[Pompey the Great]], and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] was  starting  to collapse. By the time Octavius was ten in 53 BC, the alliance completely broke down with the death of Crassus in [[Parthia]]. Soon thereafter, Octavius made his first public appearance in 52 BC when he delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother [[Julia Minor (sister of Caesar)|Julia Minor]], sister of Caesar.<ref>Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#8 8.1]; [[Quintilian]], [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/quintilian/quintilian.institutio12.shtml#6 12.6.1].</ref> It was at this time that the young Octavius captured the attention of his great-uncle.

With Crassus dead, Caesar and Pompey began to fight each other for supremacy and power. In 50 BC, the Senate, led by Pompey, ordered Caesar to return to Rome from [[Gaul]] and to disband his army. The Senate had forbidden Caesar to stand for a second consulship in absentia. Without the consulship, Caesar would be without legal immunity and without the power of his army. Left with no other options, on January 10, 49 BC, Caesar crossed the Rubicon (the frontier boundary of Italy) with only one legion and ignited [[Caesar's civil war|civil war]].

The Senate and Pompey fled to Greece. Despite outnumbering Caesar, who only had his Thirteenth Legion with him, Pompey had no intention of fighting in Italy. Leaving [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]] as prefect of Rome, and the rest of Italy under [[Mark Antony]] as tribune, Caesar made an astonishing 27-day route-march to [[Hispania]], rejoining two of his Gallic legions, where he defeated Pompey's lieutenants. He then returned east, to challenge Pompey in Greece where, on July 10, 48 BC at the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (48 BC)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]], Caesar barely avoided a catastrophic defeat when the line of fortification was broken. He decisively defeated Pompey, despite Pompey's numerical advantage (nearly twice the number of infantry and considerably more cavalry), at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in an exceedingly short engagement in 48 BC.

The same year as Caesar’s ultimate victory against Pompey, Octavius turned 15 and donned the [[toga|toga virillis]] on October 18.<ref name=Suet8.1>Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#8 8.1]</ref> Shortly after assuming the toga virillis, Octavius began his first official business upon being elected a [[pontiff]] in the [[College of Pontiffs]].<ref name="Suet8.1"/> It was Caesar who had nominated Octavius for this position, the first of many to come from Caesar. While it is unknown if Caesar took the time to explain the current military or political situation, Caesar did take an interest in Octavius. While celebrating the Festival of the Latins, Caesar appointed Octavius the [[Praefectus urbi]] until his return. While the position was solely honorary and possessed no authority, it allowed Octavius a place in the public eye.

From 46 BC on, Octavius was very close to Caesar and attended theaters, banquets, and other social gatherings with him. In September 46 BC, when Caesar celebrated his multiple triumphs, Octavius took part in the procession and was accorded military honors despite never having served in combat.<ref name=Fagan>[http://www.luc.edu/roman-emperors/auggie.htm Fagan, Garrett G., "Augustus (31 B.C. - 14 A.D.)", 1999]</ref>  Soon, Octavius had built up considerable influence with Caesar to such a point that others would ask him to intercede with him on their behalf.

Following in the normal path of young Romans, Octavius needed experience with military affairs. Caesar proposed that Octavius join him in [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]] even though Octavius had fallen ill. Though he was now legally a man, his mother Atia was still a dominating figure in his life. According to [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], Atia protested Octavius joining Caesar, and the latter recognized the necessity of protecting Octavius’ health.<ref>Nicolaus of Damascus, ''[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/nicolaus.html Augustus]'' 6.</ref> Though she consented for him to join Caesar in [[Hispania]], where he planned to fight the remaining forces under Pompey’s lieutenants, but Octavius again fell ill and was unable to travel.

As soon as he was well, Octavius, accompanied by a few friends (including [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]]), sailed to Hispania. He became shipwrecked and, after coming ashore with his companions, was forced to make it across hostile territory to reach Caesar's camp. Octavius’ actions greatly impressed his great-uncle, who proceeded to teach Octavius the ways of provincial administration. [[Suetonius]] in Chapter 68 of his ''Life of Augustus''<ref>Suetonius, ''Augustus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#68 68], translated by [[John Carew Rolfe]].</ref> writes that [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius Antonius]], the brother of Mark Antony, accused Augustus for having "given himself to [[Aulus Hirtius]] in Spain for three hundred thousand [[sesterces]]." This alleged homosexual liaison must have taken place in 46 BC during the civil wars when Julius Caesar took Octavian to Spain and Aulus Hirtius was serving there. At the time the future Emperor Augustus was 17 years old.

Caesar and Octavius stayed in Hispania until June 45 BC, after which they returned to Rome. [[Velleius Paterculus]] reports that Caesar and Octavius shared the same carriage.<ref>Velleius Paterculus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2C*.html#59.3 2.59.3].</ref> When back in Rome, Caesar deposited a new will with the [[Vestal Virgins]] in which he secretly named Octavius as the prime beneficiary.<ref>Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#83 83] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530163202/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#83 |date=2012-05-30 }}.</ref> Upon returning to Rome, Caesar increasingly amassed more authority and control over the [[Roman Republic|Roman state]]. He was made Consul for 10 years and [[Roman Dictator|Dictator]] for the same period. He was allowed to name half of the magistrates each year and even allowed to name new [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]. Among others, Caesar used this new power to elevate Octavius.

Hoping to continue Octavius’ education, at the end of 45 BC Caesar sent him, along with his friends Agrippa, [[Gaius Maecenas]], and [[Quintus Salvidienus Rufus]], to [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]] in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]]. There, Octavius learned not only academics and self-control but military doctrine and tactics as well. Caesar, however, had more than just education in mind for Octavius. Macedonia was home of five [[Roman legion|legions]] and he hoped to use it as a launching ground for an upcoming war with [[Parthia]] in the Middle East.<ref name="eck 9 10">Eck, 9–10</ref> In preparation, Caesar had nominated Octavius to serve as [[Master of the Horse]] (Caesar’s chief lieutenant) for the year 43 BC, thus making Octavius the number-two man in the state at the age of 19.

However, the war with the Parthians never came nor did Octavius’ promotion. While still in Apollonia, word reached Octavius that Caesar had been assassinated on the [[Ides of March]] in 44 BC. It was then made public that Caesar had adopted Octavius as his son and main heir. In response, Octavius changed his name to Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus. Though modern scholars to avoid confusion commonly refer to him at this point as Octavian, he called himself "Caesar", which is the name his contemporaries also used. Rejecting the advice of some army officers to take refuge with his troops in Macedonia, Octavian sailed to Italy to claim his inheritance.
