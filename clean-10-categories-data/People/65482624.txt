==Asexual characters and tropes==

Representation for asexual people in fiction has always been mixed, with strong prejudice against asexuals and asexual erasure.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kate |first1=Lyons |title=Prejudice Against "Group X" (Asexuals) |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/without-prejudice/201209/prejudice-against-group-x-asexuals |website=[[Psychology Today]] |publisher=Sussex Publishers, LLC  |accessdate=June 18, 2020 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20191230131940/https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/without-prejudice/201209/prejudice-against-group-x-asexuals |archivedate=December 30, 2019 |date=September 1, 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref> In general there has been a lack of representation of asexual characters in media.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jankowski |first1=Laura |title=Too Niche |url=http://www.jimchines.com/2015/02/niche-lauren-jankowski/ |website=Jim C.

<blockquote>
Not welcoming asexuals to participate in shaping the portrayals of asexuality in mainstream media has resulted in grossly inaccurate and damaging depictions of this orientation.  Most allosexual people can name a fictional character who can be interpreted as asexual, but very few can name a single real-life asexual writer, director, actor, or other artist. The beautiful art and contributions asexual-identifying people make to society will continue to be suppressed as long as these negative portrayals and beliefs continue to go unchallenged...In the meantime, here's to hoping we see an asexual character soon whose orientation is treated as normal—not a problem to fix.
