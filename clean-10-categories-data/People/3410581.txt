==Early career==
Adelman was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgRQAsk0CK4C&q=adelman|first=Gerald|last=Sorin|title=Tradition Transformed: The Jewish Experience in America (The American Moment)|pages=219|date=March 11, 1997|isbn=9780801854460}}</ref> and graduated from [[Grinnell College]] in [[Iowa]], majoring in [[philosophy]] and [[religious studies|religion]].  He received his master's degree in Foreign Service studies and Doctorate in [[political theory]] from [[Georgetown University]].

Adelman began working for the government in 1969 at the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]], and then served in the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]]. From 1975 to 1977 during the [[Gerald Ford]] administration, Adelman was an Assistant to [[United States Secretary of Defense]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and was later a member of the Defense Policy Board. He has also served as a national editor of ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' magazine for more than 17 years.

He was the deputy U.S. Ambassador to the [[United Nations]] for two-and-a-half years, working with [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]]. He also served as the Director of the U.S. [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]] for nearly five years, during the Reagan administration. He was an advisor to President [[Ronald Reagan]] during the superpower summits between Reagan and Soviet General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

He took part in the [[Zaire River]] Expedition in 1975, travelling down the [[Congo River]] on the 100th Anniversary of [[Henry Morton Stanley]]'s exploration.

In 1981, he was selected to be one of the first ''Young Leaders'' of the [[French-American Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchamerican.org/young-leaders|title=Young Leaders|publisher=[[French-American Foundation]]|accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>

==Later career==
Adelman was a member of the Pentagon's [[Defense Policy Board]] well-known{{By whom|date=March 2012}} for his involvement in [[Conservatism|conservative]] policy efforts dating back to the 1970s when he was a member of the [[Committee on the Present Danger]]. He strongly supported the [[2003 war in Iraq|war on Iraq]] and worked for the [[think tank]] [[Project for the New American Century]], arguing for new policies to help the United States remain a global leader. Adelman, called "a lifelong [[Neoconservatism|neocon activist]]", worried in 2006 that the incompetence shown in handling the war in Iraq would damage the neoconservative movement; neoconservatism, he said, "is not going to sell" for at least a generation.<ref name = "VanityFair">{{cite magazine |title= Now They Tell Us |url= http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/12/neocons200612?currentPage=2 |magazine=Vanity Fair| first= David |last=Rose |date= November 3, 2006 |accessdate= 2007-10-24}}</ref>

Adelman went on to become senior counsel at [[Edelman (firm)|Edelman Public Relations]], where he led several campaigns linked to U.S. trade and intellectual property interests via the organization USA Innovations, an organization he also leads. Using the USA Innovations platform and through other published articles Adelman has attacked the [[Thai government]] for violating U.S. pharmaceutical industry [[HIV/AIDS]] drug intellectual property patents<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-weissman/ken-adelmans-new-lies_b_47864.html|first=Robert|last=Weissman |title=Ken Adelman's (New) Lies|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=2007-05-07}}</ref> and other topics linked to Edelman Public Relations clients.
 
Adelman is also an expert on [[William Shakespeare]] and has taught extension school classes at [[Georgetown University]] and [[George Washington University]] on Shakespeare.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He co-wrote with [[Norman R. Augustine]] a book on drawing leadership lessons from Shakespeare, called ''Shakespeare in Charge: The Bard's Guide to Leading and Succeeding on the Business Stage''.<ref name="shakeincharge">{{cite book|last=Augustine|first=Norman|author2=Kenneth Adelman|title=Shakespeare in Charge: The Bard's Guide to Leading and Succeeding on the Business Stage|isbn=0-7868-8644-7|date=2001-05-16|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/shakespeareincha00norm}}</ref> He is known for invocations of Shakespeare in favor of his political positions, including an NPR analysis of a scene from ''[[Othello]]'' in [https://web.archive.org/web/20071018044931/http://cla.calpoly.edu:16080/~smarx/Shakespeare/draftingshakespeare2006/DawsonOthello.htm support of the invasion of Iraq], and lauding [http://www.poppolitics.com/articles/2003/05/01/George_W_as_Henry_V? President Bush as King Henry V].

== Iraq war ==
Adelman wrote a pair of editorial columns regarding the [[Iraq War]] in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in February 2002 and April 2003 entitled, respectively, "Cakewalk In Iraq"<ref name="cakewalk1">{{cite news|first=Kenneth|last=Adelman|title=Cakewalk in Iraq|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A1996-2002Feb12|date=2002-02-13}}</ref> and "'Cakewalk' Revisited".<ref>{{cite news|last=Adelman|first=Kenneth|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A1512-2003Apr9|title='Cakewalk' Revisited|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2003-04-10}}</ref> In the first he argued that the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq would be a simple matter to accomplish: "I believe that demolishing [[Saddam Hussein|Hussein]]'s military power and liberating Iraq would be a cakewalk". In the later editorial, published just a few weeks after the invasion, he claimed his vindication and in particular praised key [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] players: "My confidence 14 months ago sprang from having worked for Don Rumsfeld three times—knowing he would fashion a most creative and detailed war plan—and from knowing [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]] well for many years".

Also notable are Adelman's predictions regarding [[weapons of mass destruction]] in Iraq. Adelman said that weapons were likely to be near [[Tikrit]] and [[Baghdad]], "because they're the most protected places with the best troops. I have no doubt we're going to find big stores of weapons of mass destruction".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A12217-2003Mar22|first=Mike|last=Allen|author2=Dana Milbank |title=Question of the Day Dogs Administration Officials|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2003-03-23}}</ref> Of course, he was wrong.

In an article first appearing on the website of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in November 2006, Adelman wrote that he regrets urging military action in Iraq and feels that he overestimated the abilities of the Bush administration leadership. He was quoted as saying "I just presumed that what I considered to be the most competent [[U.S. national security|National Security]] team since [[Harry Truman|Truman]] was indeed going to be competent". He also added, "They turned out to be among the most incompetent teams in the [[post-war|postwar era]]. Not only did each of them, individually, have enormous flaws, but together they were deadly, dysfunctional".<ref name="drose">{{cite magazine|last1=Rose|first1=David|title=Neo Culpa|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/01/neocons200701|accessdate=June 12, 2017|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=January 2007|quote=A preview of this articlewas published on VF.com on November 3, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1939471,00.html|title=Neocons turn on Bush for incompetence over Iraq war|last=Borger|first=Julia|date=2006-11-04|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>  He wrote that the conduct of the war "just breaks your heart," and it "didn't have to be managed this bad; it's awful."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/19/washington/19cnd-policy.html|title=Kissinger Says Victory in Iraq Is Not Possible|last=Knowlton|first=Brian|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2006-11-09}}</ref>

In an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Adelman said of Rumsfeld, a friend and associate of 36 years: "How could this happen to someone so good, so competent? This war made me doubt the past. Was I wrong all those years, or was he just better back then? The Donald Rumsfeld of today is not the Donald Rumsfeld I knew, but maybe I was wrong about the old Donald Rumsfeld. It's a terrible way to end a career. It's hard to remember, but he was once the future."<ref name = "NewYorker">{{cite magazine |title= Inner Office - End of the Affair |url= http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/articles/061120ta_talk_goldberg/ |magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|author =Goldberg, Jeffrey |date= November 10, 2006 |accessdate= 2006-12-05 |author-link= Jeffrey Goldberg}}</ref>

==Support for Barack Obama==
''[[The New Yorker]]'' reported on October 20, 2008, that Kenneth Adelman decided to buck his conservative leanings and vote for Senator [[Barack Obama]] for President on November 4, 2008.<ref name="NewYorker2">{{cite news |title= First Colin Powell, Now ... |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/georgepacker/2008/10/not-quite-colin.html |publisher= [[The New Yorker]] (online only) |author =Packer, George |date=October 20, 2008 |author-link= George Packer}}</ref> According to the ''New Yorker'', Adelman made his decision "primarily for two reasons, those of temperament and of judgment". He explained:

{{quote|When the economic crisis broke, I found [[John McCain]] bouncing all over the place. In those first few crisis days, he was impetuous, inconsistent, and imprudent; ending up just plain weird. Having worked with Ronald Reagan for seven years, and been with him in his critical three summits with [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]], I've concluded that that's no way a president can act under pressure.

Second is judgment. The most important decision John McCain made in his long campaign was deciding on a running mate.

That decision showed appalling lack of judgment. Not only is [[Sarah Palin]] not close to being acceptable in high office—I would not have hired her for even a mid-level post in the arms-control agency. But that selection contradicted McCain's main two, and best two, themes for his campaign—Country First, and experience counts. Neither can he credibly claim, post-Palin pick.<ref name="NewYorker2"/>}}

Soon after he authored a ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'' article entitled ''Why a Staunch Conservative Like Me Endorsed Obama'' where he wrote, "Granted, McCain's views are closer to mine than Obama's. But I've learned over this Bush era to value competence along with ideology. Otherwise, our ideology gets discredited, as it has so disastrously over the past eight years". He added, "McCain's temperament—leading him to bizarre behavior during the week the economic crisis broke—and his judgment—leading him to [[Wasilla, Alaska|Wasilla]]—depressed me into thinking that "our guy" would be a(nother) lousy conservative president. Been there, done that".<ref name = "HuffPost">{{cite news |title= Why a Staunch Conservative Like Me Endorsed Obama|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ken-adelman/why-a-staunch-conservativ_b_137749.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|author =Adelman, Kenneth |date= October 24, 2008 |accessdate= 2008-10-26}}</ref>

A Reuters article quotes Adelman as saying, "I am a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and only voted for one Democrat in my entire life, and that was very much an anti-McCain vote. I thought Obama was going to be better than he turned out to be". Reuters also reported that he was backing Romney.<ref name = "Reuters">{{cite news |title=Insight: In 2012, some "Obamacons" turn back to Republicans|url= http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/11/01/will-obamacons-turn-back-to-republicans-in-2012/|agency=[[Reuters]]|author =Patricia Zengerle and Eric Johnson
