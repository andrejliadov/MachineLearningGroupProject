The '''royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom''', or the '''royal arms''' for short, is the official [[coat of arms]] of the [[British monarch]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.royal.uk/coats-arms |title=Coats of arms |publisher=The Royal Household |accessdate=3 October 2020 }}</ref><ref>p. 10, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/362346/hmg_identity_system_guidelines_2012.pdf Government identity system (2012)]. HM Government. "The Queen is Head of State, and the United Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
The royal coat of arms is personal to the Queen and..."</ref> currently [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. These arms are used by the Queen in her official capacity as monarch of the [[United Kingdom]]. Variants of the royal arms are used by other members of the [[British royal family]], by the [[British Government]] in connection with the administration and government of the country, and some courts and legislatures in a number of [[Commonwealth realm]]s. In [[Scotland]], there exists a separate version of the royal arms, a variant of which is used by the [[Scotland Office]] and the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Judiciary]]. The arms in [[banner of arms|banner form]] serve as basis for the monarch's official flag, the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom|Royal Standard]].

In the standard variant used outside of Scotland, the shield is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the three passant guardant lions of England; in the second, the rampant lion and double tressure [[fleur-de-lis#Other European monarchs and rulers|flory-counterflory]] of Scotland; and in the third, a [[Clàrsach|harp]] for Ireland.<ref name="Boutell">{{cite book |last=Brooke-Little |first=J.

The [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] [[supporters|supporter]] is a likewise crowned English lion; the sinister, a Scottish [[unicorn]]. The English and Scottish quarters and supporters are swapped in the Scottish version of the arms.

In the greenery below, a [[thistle]], [[Tudor rose]] and [[shamrock]] are depicted, representing Scotland, England and Ireland respectively. This [[armorial achievement]] comprises the [[motto]], in French, of [[English monarchs]], ''[[Dieu et mon Droit]]'' (God and my Right), which has descended to the present [[royal family]] as well as the [[Order of the Garter#Heraldry|Garter circlet]] which surrounds the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]], inscribed with the [[Order of the Garter|Order]]'s motto, in French, ''[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]'' (Shame on him who thinks evil).
The official [[blazon]] of the royal arms is:

{{quote|Quarterly, first and fourth Gules three Lions passant gardant in pale Or armed and langued Azure (for England), second quarter Or a Lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland), third quarter Azure a Harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland), the whole surrounded by the Garter; for a Crest, upon the Royal helm the Imperial Crown Proper, thereon a Lion statant gardant Or imperially crowned Proper; Mantling Or and Ermine; for Supporters, dexter a Lion rampant gardant Or crowned as the Crest, sinister a Unicorn Argent armed, crined and unguled Proper, gorged with a Coronet Or composed of Crosses patées and Fleurs-de-lis a Chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or. Motto "Dieu et mon Droit" in the compartment below the shield, with the Union Rose, Shamrock and Thistle engrafted on the same stem.<ref name="Boutell"/>}}

==Uses==
The royal arms may only be used by the Queen herself. They also appear in courtrooms, since the monarch is deemed to be the fount of judicial authority in the United Kingdom and law courts comprise part of the ancient royal court (thus so named).<ref>{{cite web|title=Traditions of the courts|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-justice-system/court-traditions/|website=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref> Judges are officially Crown representatives, demonstrated by the display of the royal arms behind the judge's bench in almost all UK courts; notable exceptions include the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], which displays its own [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom#Badge|badge and flag]] to symbolize its nationwide role, the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in the [[City of London]], where behind the [[Justices of the Peace]] stands a sword upright flanked by the arms of the City and the Crown. In addition, the royal arms cannot be displayed in courtrooms or on court-house exteriors in [[Northern Ireland]], except for the courtrooms of the [[Royal Courts of Justice, Belfast|Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast]] and the courts in Armagh, Banbridge, Downpatrick, Magherafelt, or Omagh, and the exterior of court buildings that had them in place prior to the 2002 law.<ref>Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 (c.26) 66 [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/26/body/enacted Display of Royal Arms at courts]</ref>

As the United Kingdom is governed in the monarch's name, the British Government also uses the royal arms as a national symbol of the United Kingdom,<ref>Government identity system HM Government</ref> and, in that capacity, the coat of arms can be seen on several government documents and forms, passports, in the entrance to embassies and consulates, etc. However, when used by the government and not by the monarch personally, the coat of arms is often represented without the helm. This is also the case with the sovereign's Scottish arms, a version of which is used by the [[Scotland Office]].

The royal arms have regularly appeared on the coinage produced by the [[Royal Mint]] including, for example, from 1663, the [[Guinea (British coin)|Guinea]] and, from 1983, the [[British one pound coin]].  In 2008, a new series of designs for all seven coins of £1 and below was unveiled by the Royal Mint, every one of which is drawn from the royal arms.  The full royal arms appear on the one pound coin, and sections appear on each of the other six, such that they can be put together like a puzzle to make another complete representation of the royal arms.<ref>[http://www.royalmint.com/newdesigns/designsRevealed.aspx The New Designs Revealed<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404064611/http://www.royalmint.com/newdesigns/designsRevealed.aspx|date=4 April 2008}}</ref> The series was replaced in 2016 by the Nations of the Crown bi-metallic coin.

The monarch grants [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]]s to select businesses and tradespeople which supply the Royal Household with goods or services. This entitles those businesses to display the royal arms on their packaging and stationery by way of advertising.

It is customary (but not mandatory) for churches throughout the United Kingdom whether in the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church of Scotland]] to display the royal arms to show loyalty to the Crown.<ref>{{cite book|title=Treasures of Britain and Treasures of Ireland|edition=1976|publisher=Drive Publications|page=677}} Retrieved 15 March 2014.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing-history.com/royal-arms-in-church/|title=Royal Arms in church|publisher=Intriguing History|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref> If a church building of either denomination does not have a royal arms, permission from the Crown must be given before one can be used.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hasler|first=Charles|title=The Royal Arms&nbsp;— Its Graphic And Decorative Development|publisher=Jupiter Books|date=1980|isbn=978-0904041200|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/royalarmsitsgrap0000hasl}}</ref>

A banner of the royal arms, known as the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]], is flown from the royal palaces when the monarch is in residence, [[Windsor Castle]] and [[Buckingham Palace]] being her principal abodes; and from public buildings only when the monarch is present. This protocol equally applies to the monarch's principal residences in Scotland (the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]] and [[Balmoral Castle]]), where the Royal Standard (Scottish version) is flown. When the monarch is not in residence the [[Union Flag]], or in Scotland the ancient [[Royal Standard of Scotland]], is flown.

The widely sold British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' uses the Hanoverian royal arms as a logo, whereas its sister publication, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', displays the current version. Likewise, the Australian newspaper ''The Age'' uses the insignia as its logo.

The royal arms are also displayed in all courts in [[British Columbia]], as well as in other Canadian provinces such as [[Ontario]], where the judges are appointed by Crown authority.<ref>[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/index.asp Welcome<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=December 2015}}</ref> In [[Australia]] they were also displayed by all [[Governor-General of Australia|Viceroys]] as representation of their Crown authority, and by most state Supreme Courts across the country. Additionally the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]] has also adopted them as its own symbol.

The royal arms were controversially used by former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] as her official letterhead from {{circa|1997|lk=yes}}.<ref>{{cite news |last=Summers |first2=Ben |last2=Streeter |first=Michael |title=The strange case of Lady Thatcher and Her Majesty's coat of arms |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-strange-case-of-lady-thatcher-and-her-majestys-coat-of-arms-1274739.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 March 1997 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}</ref>

{{see also|Royal coat of arms of Scotland}}
Since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, a separate version of the royal arms has been used in [[Scotland]], giving the Scottish elements pride of place.

The [[shield]] is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the lion ''rampant'' of Scotland; in the second, the three lions ''passant guardant'' of England; and in the third, the harp of [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]].

The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] atop the [[Crown of Scotland]] is a red lion, seated and forward facing, itself wearing the Crown of Scotland and holding the two remaining elements of the [[Honours of Scotland]], namely the Sword of State and the Sceptre of Scotland. This was also the crest used in the royal arms of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. The [[Slogan (heraldry)|slogan]], in [[Scots language|Scots]], appears above the crest, in the tradition of [[Scottish heraldry]], and is an abbreviated form of the full motto: ''[[In My Defens God Me Defend]]''.

The supporters change sides and both appear wearing the crowns of their respective Kingdom. The [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] [[supporter]] is a crowned and chained unicorn, symbolising Scotland. The [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] supporter is a crowned lion, symbolising England. Between each supporter and the shield is a lance displaying the flag of their respective Kingdom.

The coat also features both the motto ''[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]'' (No one wounds (touches) me with impunity) and, surrounding the shield, the [[Livery collar|collar]] of the [[Order of the Thistle]]. On the [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] are a number of thistles, Scotland's national flower.

===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===
[[File:St Mary, Stone, Kent - Royal Arms - geograph.org.uk - 1490059.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Royal arms of Elizabeth II, displayed in the parish church of [[Stone, Kent]]]]
Unlike the [[Acts of Union 1707]] with Scotland, the [[Acts of Union 1800]] with Ireland did not provide for a separate Irish version of the royal arms.{{dubious|1706/7 says "the quartering the Arms, and the Rank and Precedency of the Lyon King of Arms of the Kingdom of Scotland as may best suit the Union, be left to her Majesty" and 1800 says nothing for or against. If the contention is that the 1800 acts have been interpreted as FORBIDDING separate royal arms for Ireland, then that requires specific cites.|date=November 2017}} The [[Arms of Ireland#Achievement|crest of the Kingdom of Ireland]] ("on a wreath Or and Azure, a tower triple-towered of the First, from the portal a hart springing Argent attired and unguled Or") has had little or no official use since the union. 

The harp quarter of the royal arms represents Ireland on both the English and Scottish versions.  Likewise, one English quarter is retained in the Scottish version, and one Scottish quarter is retained in the English version.  Thus, England, Scotland and Ireland are represented in all versions of the royal arms since they came under one monarch. When the [[Irish Free State]] established [[Great Seal of the Irish Free State|its own diplomatic seals]] in the 1930s, the royal arms appearing on them varied from those on their UK equivalents by having the Irish arms in two quarters and the English arms in one.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hanley|first=Hugh|year=2015|title='The Last Shadow': Negotiating the Great Seal and Direct Access to the King, 1931|journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|volume=26|pages=257–274 : 266 |doi=10.3318/isia.2015.26.13 |jstor=10.3318/isia.2015.26.13}}; {{cite web |url=http://difp.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=2243 |title=Memorandum on external seals |first=Joseph |last=Walshe |author-link=Joseph Walshe |date=26 October 1937 |work=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy, Vol. V No. 97 |publisher=[[Royal Irish Academy]] |accessdate=20 September 2011 }}</ref>
By contrast, there is no representation at all for [[Wales]] in the royal arms, as at the Act of Union 1707 Wales was an integral part of the Kingdom of England pursuant to the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]]; thus, it has been argued Wales is represented in the English coat of arms.  However the argument is somewhat disingenuous as in 1535 the Welsh Dragon was already part of the Tudor Coat of Arms. Upon the accession of the Tudor monarchs, who were themselves of Welsh descent, a Welsh Dragon was used as a supporter on the royal arms. This was dropped by their successors, the Scottish House of Stuart, who replaced the Tudors' dragon supporter with the Scottish unicorn.
In the 20th century, the [[coat of arms of Wales|arms of the principality of Wales]] were added as an inescutcheon to the [[coat of arms of the Prince of Wales]], and a banner of those arms with a green inescutcheon bearing the prince's crown is flown as his personal standard in Wales.  The so-called [[Prince of Wales's feathers]] are a heraldic badge rather than a coat of arms upon a shield, but they are not Welsh in any case.  They derive, in fact, from the English Princes of Wales (who may owe them to an exploit of [[Edward, the Black Prince]] at the [[Battle of Crécy]]) and carry the motto ''{{lang|de|Ich dien}}'' ([[German language|German]], "I Serve").  In any event, they do not form part of the royal arms, as opposed to the heraldic achievement of the Prince of Wales, who drops them upon his accession as King.

==History==

===Kingdoms of England and Scotland===
The current royal arms are a combination of the arms of the former kingdoms that make up the [[United Kingdom]], and can be traced back to the first arms of the kings of England and kings of Scotland. Various alterations occurred over the years as the arms of other realms acquired or claimed by the kings were added to the royal arms. The table below tracks the changes in the royal arms from the original arms of King Richard I of England, and William I, King of Scots.

===Royal family===
Members of the [[British royal family]] are granted their own personal arms which are based on the royal arms. Only children and grandchildren in the male line of the monarch are entitled to arms in this fashion: the arms of children of the monarch are differenced with a three-point [[Label (heraldry)|label]]; grandchildren of the monarch are differenced with a five-point label. An exception is made for the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, who bears a three-point label. Since 1911, the arms of the Prince of Wales also displays an [[inescutcheon]] of the ancient [[Coat of Arms of the Principality of Wales|arms of the Principality of Wales]]. 
Queens consort and the wives of sons of the monarch also have their own personal coat of arms. Typically this will be the arms of their husband impaled with their own personal arms or those of their father, if armigerous. However, the consorts of a Queen regnant are not entitled to use the royal arms. Thus [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] has been granted his own personal arms.

Currently the following members of the royal family have their own arms based on the royal arms:

[[File:Coat of Arms of the British Government.jpg|thumb|150px|A version used by the British government on official websites and departmental insignia]]

Various versions of the royal arms are used by [[Her Majesty's Government]] in the United Kingdom, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and courts in some parts of the Commonwealth.

HM Government generally uses a simplified version of the royal arms with a crown replacing the helm and crest, and with no compartment.<ref>GOV.UK, Departments, agencies and public bodies [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations]. Retrieved 10 August 2013</ref> In relation to Scotland, the [[Scotland Office]] and the [[Advocate General for Scotland]] use the Scottish version, again without the [[Helmet|helm]] or [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], and the same was used as the day-to-day logo of the [[Scottish Executive]] until September 2007, when a [[rebranding]] exercise introduced the name ''[[Scottish Government]]'', together with a revised logo incorporating the [[flag of Scotland]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170305194010/http://news.gov.scot/news/new-lord-lyon-king-of-arms-appointed |www.gov.scot New Lyon King-of-arms appointed]</ref>

The Scottish Government continues to use the Arms on some official documents.

The simplified royal arms also feature:

* on all [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]];
* on the cover of all [[British passport|UK passports]] and passports issued in other British territories and dependencies;
* as an inescutcheon on the [[diplomatic flag]]s of British Ambassadors; and
* on all acts of the [[Anguilla House of Assembly]], the [[Sovereign Base Areas]], [[Pitcairn Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] administrations;
* on [[the London Gazette]].

Various courts in the Commonwealth also continue to use the royal arms:

* The [[Court of Appeal of British Columbia|Court of Appeal]], [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|Supreme Court]] and [[Provincial Court of British Columbia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/court_of_appeal/hearing_list/|title=Court of Appeal – Hearing List|website=www.courts.gov.bc.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.provincialcourt.bc.ca/|title=Provincial Court of British Columbia|website=www.provincialcourt.bc.ca}}</ref>

Furthermore:
* A version of the crest of the royal arms, as used in Scotland, is used by the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]], the [[General Register Office for Scotland]] and the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]].
* The crowned shield of the royal arms encircled by the Garter is used by the [[Home Office]] and by the [[Parliament of Victoria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/|title=Parliament of Victoria – Home|website=www.parliament.vic.gov.au}}</ref>
* The crowned shield of the royal arms is used by the [[Royal Mint]].
* The royal arms with the crest but without the helm is used as the rank insignia for Class 1 Warrant Officers in Her Majesty's Armed Forces.
