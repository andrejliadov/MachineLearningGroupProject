==Career==

===Early career===
From an early age, Abrams began playing the guitar and piano. He was in several early bands; among them Heavy Impact - in which he played both guitar and keyboards alongside Joe Wells (guitar), Lemar Washington (guitar), Marston "Buffy" Freeman (bass guitar), Ronald Simmons (drums), Harry Jones (trumpet), and Barbara Mills (saxophone). In 1976, he formed Conservative Manor, [[94 East]] (the band featuring [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] on lead guitar).<ref name="Wynn"/>

He became popular on the New York underground scene via radio and club play, and had his first major hit in 1984 with "Music Is the Answer", on the independent label Streetwise.<ref name="Chin">{{cite news|author=Chin, Brian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27&dq=%22colonel+abrams%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirptnN8pPMAhXM0hoKHe4lDAI4ChDoAQgtMAI#v=onepage&q=%22colonel%20abrams%22&f=false |title=Colonel Abrams Enjoys Overseas Success|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date= April 19, 1986|page= 27|accessdate= April 16, 2016}}</ref> Other hits in the mid 1980s included "Leave the Message Behind the Door", "[[Trapped (Colonel Abrams song)|Trapped]]" (a top ten hit in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the UK),<ref name="Chin" /> "The Truth", "Speculation", "[[I'm Not Gonna Let You]]", and "Over and Over", establishing Abrams as a solo artist, initially in Europe and later in the US.<ref name="McShane">{{cite news|author=McShane, Larry |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ff4rAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Vm0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2755,5978735&dq=colonel-abrams&hl=en |title=Colonel Abrams Finds Acceptance|work=[[Kentucky New Era]]|date= August 15, 1986|page= 7B|accessdate= June 10, 2011}}</ref>

In 1985, he signed to [[Steven Machat]]'s label and production company, AMI. Machat, who was collaborating and working with a British producer, [[Richard James Burgess]], hired Burgess to produce Abrams' [[Colonel Abrams (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Machat then arranged for [[MCA Records]] to sign Abrams for worldwide releases. Burgess produced the songs "Trapped", "I'm Not Gonna Let You", and "Table for Two".

"Trapped" reached the top five in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and topped the US [[Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart in 1985,<ref name="Star-News">"{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e1hOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KRQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7092,5014354&dq=colonel-abrams&hl=en |title=Tipoff|newspaper=[[Wilmington Morning Star]]|date= June 16, 1986|page= 2D|accessdate=June 10, 2011}}</ref> followed by his self-titled album, which spent two weeks at number one the following year. An electronic remix of "Trapped" was later released in 1995 by [[Boards of Canada]], under the pseudonym [[Hell Interface]]. A new version of "Trapped" ("Trapped 2006") was released in the UK.

"[[I'm Not Gonna Let]]" also spent a week at number one in the dance chart, in 1986. The album peaked at number 75 on the US [[Billboard Top 200]] and Number 13 on the US [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart. Although Abrams had no American pop hits during his career, he had a number of entries on the US [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart in the 1980s and 1990s, including four entries that hit number one. In 1987, he had his fourth number-one US dance hit with "[[How Soon We Forget]]", the same year that he released his second album, ''[[You and Me Equals Us]]''.

===Recent work===
On January 9, 2007, Abrams released the single "Just When You Thought", the third single on his own record label, Colonel Records, after "Heartbreaker" and "Let Us All Be Friends". Also in 2007, Abrams released "Never Be", "Just Like Mathematics", and "True Stories". In June 2008, his single, "Only a Few", was issued.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In August 2011, he performed at the '80s Reunion'.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==Later life and illness==
A crowdfunding campaign was launched in 2015, via [[GoFundMe]], in order to help Abrams, as he was homeless, suffering from diabetes, and in poor health.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bennison, Aidan |url=http://www.factmag.com/2015/12/08/crowdfunding-campaign-launched-for-colonel-abrams |title=Crowdfunding campaign launched for Colonel Abrams|work=FACT|date=December 8, 2015|accessdate= April 16, 2016}}</ref> [[Marshall Jefferson]], who had begun his own effort to crowdfund an album, encouraged others to donate to Abrams instead, stating:

<blockquote>As most of you may or may not know, a lot of recording artists don’t have medical coverage or benefits ... Those of us who have listened to his awesome music and know of his plight, have banded together to try to help him through this rough patch.<ref>{{cite web|last1=KevRoss|title=House Music’s Colonel Abrams, Homeless and in Poor Health, Crowdfunding Campaign Established|url=http://www.radiofacts.com/eighties-singer-colonel-abrams-homeless-and-in-poor-health-crowdfunding-campaign/|website=Radio Facts|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref></blockquote>
