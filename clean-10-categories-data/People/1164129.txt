'''Roslyn Dundas''' (born 28 July 1978) is a former Australian politician. She was an [[Australian Democrats]] member of the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]] from 2001 to 2004, when she was defeated in a bid for re-election. Until [[Kelly Vincent]]'s election to the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] in 2010, Dundas was the youngest woman ever elected to an Australian parliament.<ref name="ACTCOSS_staff">{{cite web|url=http://www.actcoss.org.au/about/staff.html|title=The ACTCOSS Staff Team|publisher=ACTCOSS|accessdate=24 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524135945/http://www.actcoss.org.au/about/staff.html|archivedate=24 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="Women's_Register_bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0163b.htm|title=Dundas, Roslyn (1978 - )|date=13 October 2009|work=The Australian Women's Register|accessdate=24 March 2010}}</ref>

Dundas was born and raised in [[Canberra]], and studied at [[Australian National University]]. While there, she became heavily involved in both student politics and community organisations, becoming the ACT Co-ordinator of the Young Women's Electoral Lobby in 1998. She served on the Management Committee of the Women's Centre for Health Matters, and on the General Committee of the ACT Council of Social Service.

In 2000, Dundas became the National Secretary of the [[Young Australian Democrats]] movement, and National Convenor of the Democrat Students. In the same year, she was also secretary of the university student body, a member of the party executive in the ACT, and the founding co-convenor of the Vida Women's Network - an attempt to form a Democrat version of [[EMILY's List Australia]]. During the year, she also served on the Women's Committee of the [[National Union of Students of Australia|National Union of Students]].<ref name="Candidate_profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/candidate-profile-roslyn-dundas/296953.aspx|title=Candidate Profile: ROSLYN DUNDAS|date=4 October 2001|publisher=The Canberra Times|accessdate=24 March 2010}}</ref> In September 2000 she unsuccessfully ran for President of the [[Australian National University]] Students' Association, as the leader of a combined Democrat/Liberal election ticket.

Dundas worked as an organiser for the [[Community and Public Sector Union]] for several months in 2001, before gaining the top position on the Democrat ticket for the seat of Ginninderra in the ACT Legislative Assembly. She was subsequently elected, defeating conservative independent [[Dave Rugendyke]]. This made her the youngest woman elected to an Australian parliament, as well as the first Democrat to be elected in the ACT.

Once elected to the Assembly, Dundas actively campaigned for increased government accountability, the environment, and women's rights. She supported a bill which liberalised the ACT's laws relating to [[abortion]], and introduced a [[Private Member's Bill]] supporting the use of [[open source software]]. Roslyn Dundas stood in the left wing of the party, along with the likes of Senators [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] and [[Brian Greig]]. Over the next three years, she developed a significant public profile. She also preserved [[Jon Stanhope]]'s [[Australian Labor Party (Australian Capital Territory Branch)|Labor Party]] government by downgrading a no-confidence motion to a censure motion. However, in 2004 Dundas lost the seat to the [[Australian Labor Party (Australian Capital Territory Branch)|Labor Party]]'s [[Mary Porter (politician)|Mary Porter]].

After leaving the Legislative Assembly, Dundas worked as the ACT director of [[Ausdance]]. In late 2007 she became an advisor to the ACT Children and Young People's Commissioner.<ref name="Canberra Close Up">{{cite news |last1=Flannery |first1=Hannah |last2=Tait |first2=Melanie |title=Canberra Close Up: Roslyn Dundas |url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2013/07/10/3800000.htm |accessdate=28 September 2018 |work=666 ABC Canberra |date=12 July 2013}}</ref> She took up the position of director of the ACT Council of Social Service in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roslyn Dundas |url=http://www.communityservices.act.gov.au/women/act-womens-honour-roll/2001/roslyn-dundas |website=Women's Honour Roll |publisher=ACT Government |accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref> Dundas became the CEO of Ausdance in January 2013.<ref name="Canberra Close Up" />
