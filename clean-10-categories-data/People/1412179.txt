Born in [[Mayesville, South Carolina]], to parents who had been slaves, she started working in fields with her family at age five. She took an early interest in becoming educated; with the help of benefactors, Bethune attended college hoping to become a [[missionary]] in Africa. She started a school for African-American girls in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. It later merged with a private institute for African-American boys and was known as the Bethune-Cookman School. Bethune maintained high standards and promoted the school with tourists and donors, to demonstrate what educated African Americans could do. She was president of the college from 1923 to 1942, and 1946 to 1947. She was one of the few women in the world to serve as a college president at that time.

Bethune was also active in women's clubs, which were strong civic organizations supporting welfare and other needs, and became a national leader. Bethune wrote prolifically, publishing in ''National Notes'' from 1924–1928, ''Pittsburgh Courier'' from 1937–1938, ''Aframerican Women’s Journal'' from 1940–1949, and ''Chicago Defender'' from 1948–1955, among others.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World Essays and Selected Documents|last=McCluskey and Smith|first=Audrey Thomas and Elaine M|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|pages=304}}</ref> After working on the presidential campaign for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, she was invited as a member of his "Black Cabinet." She advised him on concerns of African Americans and helped share Roosevelt's message and achievements with blacks, who had historically been Republican voters since the Civil War. At the time, blacks had been largely [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised in the South]] since the turn of the century, so she was speaking to black voters across the North. Upon her death, columnist [[Louis E. Martin]] said, "She gave out faith and hope as if they were pills and she some sort of doctor."<ref>Martin, Louis E.

==Early life and education==
[[File: Mary McLeod Bethune Cabin.jpg|thumb|200 px|The cabin in Mayesville, South Carolina 
where Mary McLeod was born]]

McLeod was born in 1875 in a small log cabin near [[Mayesville, South Carolina]], on a rice and cotton farm in [[Sumter County, South Carolina|Sumter County]]. She was the fifteenth of seventeen children born to Sam and Patsy (McIntosh) McLeod, both former slaves.<ref name="cookhouse">{{cite web|url=http://www.cookman.edu/subpages/Founder_of_the_College.asp |title=Bethune Cookman College Founder's Biography |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929001618/http://www.cookman.edu/subpages/Founder_of_the_College.asp |archive-date=2007-09-29 }} Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref><ref name="ineffable">Landfall, Dolores and Sims, J.

Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref> Most of her siblings had been born into slavery. Her mother worked for her former master, and her father farmed cotton near a large house they called "The Homestead."

Her parents wanted to be independent so they had sacrificed to buy a farm for the family. As a child, Mary would accompany her mother to deliver "white people's" wash. Allowed to go into the white children's nursery, Mary became fascinated with their toys. One day she picked up a book and as she opened it, a white child snatched it away from her, babbling she didn't know how to read. Mary decided then that the only difference between white and colored people was the ability to read and write.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martins|first=Susan|title=Mary Mcleod Bethune|year=2006|publisher=Wright Group}}</ref> She was inspired to learn.

McLeod attended Mayesville's one-room black schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School, which was run by the [[Presbyterian]] Board of Missions of [[Freedmen]]. She was the only child in her family to attend school, so each day, she taught her family what she had learned. To get to and from school, Mary walked five miles each day. Her teacher Emma Jane Wilson became a significant mentor in her life.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Wilson had attended [[Barber-Scotia College#Scotia Seminary|Scotia Seminary]] (now [[Barber-Scotia College]]). She helped McLeod attend the same school on a scholarship, which she did from 1888–1893. The following year, she attended [[Dwight L. Moody]]'s Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in [[Chicago]] (now the [[Moody Bible Institute]]), hoping to become a [[missionary]] in Africa. Told that black missionaries were not needed, she planned to teach, as education was a prime goal among African Americans.<ref>https://www.moody.edu/alumni/connect/news/2020/bethune/?utm_campaign=AA_April%20Newsletter_2020_EML%201_Alumni&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua</ref>

==Marriage and family==
McLeod married Albertus Bethune in 1898. They moved to [[Savannah, Georgia]], where she did social work up until the Bethunes made the move to Florida. They had a son, named Albert. Coyden Harold Uggams, a visiting Presbyterian minister, persuaded the couple to relocate to [[Palatka, Florida]], to run a mission school.<Ref>"Mary McLeod Bethune", ''Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History''. Gale Group, 1999.</ref> The Bethunes moved in 1899; Mary ran the mission school and began an outreach to prisoners. Albertus left the family in 1907; he never got a divorce but relocated to South Carolina. He died in 1918 from [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Bracey">Smith, Elaine. "Introduction."

==Teaching career==

===Foundations with Lucy Craft Laney===
Bethune worked as a teacher briefly at her former elementary school in Sumter County. In 1896, she began teaching at Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in [[Augusta, Georgia]], which was part of a [[Presbyterian]] mission organized by northern congregations. It was founded and run by [[Lucy Craft Laney]]. As the daughter of former slaves, Laney ran her school with a [[Christians|Christian]] missionary zeal, emphasizing character and practical education for girls. She also accepted the boys who showed up eager to learn. Laney's mission was to imbue Christian moral education in her students to arm them for their life challenges. Of her year at Laney's school, Bethune said,

<blockquote>I was so impressed with her fearlessness, her amazing touch in every respect, an energy that seemed inexhaustible and her mighty power to command respect and admiration from her students and all who knew her. She handled her domain with the art of a master.<ref name="mccluskey1"/></blockquote>

Bethune adopted many of Laney's educational philosophies, including her emphasis on educating girls and women to improve the conditions of black people: "I believe that the greatest hope for the development of my race lies in training our women thoroughly and practically."<ref>Bethune, Mary (April 16, 1920). "Letter to the Editor" in ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> (This is a strategy being followed by organizers in numerous developing countries. Educating women raises the lives of families as a whole.) After one year at Haines, Bethune was transferred by the Presbyterian mission to the Kindell Institute in [[Sumter, South Carolina]], where she had met her current husband.'''

===School in Daytona===
[[File:Daytona School with Bethune.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|Mary McLeod Bethune with girls from the Literary and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls in Daytona, c. 1905.]] After her marriage and move to Florida, Bethune became determined to start a school for girls. Bethune moved from Palatka to Daytona because it had more economic opportunity; it had become a popular tourist destination and businesses were thriving. In October 1904, she rented a small house for $11.00 per month. She made benches and desks from discarded crates and acquired other items through charity. Bethune used $1.50 to start the Educational and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls.<ref>{{cite web

Bethune, parents of students, and church members raised money by making sweet potato pies, ice cream, and fried fish, and selling them to crews at the dump.

In the early days, the students made ink for pens from [[elderberry]] juice, and pencils from burned wood; they asked local businesses for furniture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCluskey|first1=Audrey Thomas|last2=Smith|first2=Elaine M.|title=Mary McLeod Bethune, Building a Better World: Essays and Selected Documents|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=025321503X|page=67}}</ref> Bethune wrote later, "I considered cash money as the smallest part of my resources. I had faith in a loving God, faith in myself, and a desire to serve."<ref>Straub, Deborah, ed., "Mary McLeod Bethune," ''Contemporary Heroes and Heroines,'' Book II. Gale Research, 1992.</ref> The school received donations of money, equipment, and labor from local black churches. Within a year, Bethune was teaching more than 30 girls at the school.

Bethune also courted wealthy white organizations, such as the ladies' Palmetto Club. She invited influential white men to sit on her school board of trustees, gaining participation by [[James Gamble (industrialist)|James Gamble]] (of [[Procter & Gamble]]) and [[Thomas H. White]] (of [[White Sewing Machine Company|White Sewing Machines]]). When [[Booker T. Washington]] of [[Tuskegee Institute]] visited in 1912, he advised her of the importance of gaining support by white [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]]s for funding.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Bethune had met with Washington in 1896 and was impressed by his clout with his donors.[[File:Marian Anderson and Mary McLeod Bethune at the launching of the SS Booker T Washington - 29 Sept 1942.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|[[Marian Anderson]] celebrated contralto and Mary McLeod Bethune, Director of Negro Affairs in the National Youth Administration at the launching of the SS Booker T. Washington with unidentified workers who helped construct the first Liberty ship named for an African American at the California Shipbuilding Corporation's yards by [[Alfred T. Palmer]].]]

The rigorous curriculum had the girls rise at 5:30&nbsp;a.m. for Bible study. The classes in home economics and industrial skills such as dressmaking, millinery, cooking, and other crafts emphasized a life of [[self-sufficiency]] for them as women. Students' days ended at 9 pm. Soon Bethune added science and business courses, then high school-level courses of math, English, and foreign languages.<ref name="mccluskey1">McCluskey. Audrey. " 'We Specialize in the Wholly Impossible:' Black Women School Founders," ''Signs'', Winter 1997, pp. 403–426.</ref> <!--Needs expansion; how many students by 1910, say, and 1920, 1930. When exactly were high school classes added? How many teachers?--> Bethune was always seeking donations to keep her school operating; as she traveled, she was fundraising. A donation of $62,000 by [[John D. Rockefeller]] helped, as did her friendship with Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife, beginning in the 1930s, who gave her entree to a progressive network.

In 1931, the [[Methodist Church]] helped the merger of her school with the boys' Cookman Institute, forming the Bethune-Cookman College, a coeducational junior college. Bethune became president. Through the [[Great Depression]], Bethune-Cookman School continued to operate and met the educational standards of the State of Florida. From 1936 to 1942, Bethune had to cut back her time as president because of her duties in [[Washington, DC]]. Funding declined during this period of her absence. But, by 1941 the college had developed a four-year curriculum and achieved full college status.<ref name="Bracey"/> By 1942 Bethune gave up the presidency, as her health was being adversely affected by her many responsibilities. On September 19, 1942, she gave the address at the Los Angeles, California, launching ceremony for the Liberty ship {{SS|Booker T. Washington||2}}, a ceremony in which [[Marian Anderson]] christened the ship.<ref name=NPS>{{cite document |title=Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park, Kaiser Shipyard No. 3 (Historic American Engineering Record CA-326=M) |publisher=National Park Service |page=169|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/ca/ca3300/ca3398/data/ca3398data.pdf |access-date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

== Impact on Daytona Beach Community ==

=== McLeod Hospital ===
As of the early 1900s, Daytona Beach, Florida, was lacking a hospital that would help people of color. Bethune had the idea to start a hospital after an incident involving one of her students. She was called to the bedside of a young female student who fell ill with acute appendicitis. It was clear that the student needed immediate medical attention, yet there was no local hospital to take her to that would treat black people. Bethune demanded that the white physician at the local hospital help the girl. When Bethune went to visit her student, she was asked to enter through the back door. At the hospital, she found that her student had been neglected, ill-cared for and segregated on an outdoor porch.

Out of this experience, Bethune decided that the black community in Daytona needed a hospital. She found a cabin near the school and through sponsors helping her raise money, she purchased it for five thousand dollars. In 1911, Bethune opened the first black hospital in Daytona, Florida. It started with two beds and within a few years, held twenty. Both white and black physicians worked at the hospital, along with Bethune's student nurses. This hospital went on to save many black lives within the twenty years that it operated. During that time, both black and white people in the community relied on the help from the McLeod hospital. After an explosion at a nearby construction site, the hospital took in injured black workers. The hospital and its nurses were also praised for their efforts with a 1918 influenza outbreak. During this outbreak, the hospital was full and had to overflow into the school's auditorium.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune|last=Peare|first=Catherine|publisher=The Vanguard Press, Inc.|year=1951|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune|last=Greenfield|first=Eloise|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|year=1977|isbn=0-690-01129-6|location=New York, NY}}</ref> In 1931, Daytona's public hospital, Halifax, agreed to open a separate hospital for people of color. Black people would not fully integrate to the public hospital's main location until the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://daytonatimes.com/2015/09/black-daytona-beach-in-the-1940s/|title=Black Daytona Beach in the 1940s|last=Lempel|first=Leonard|date=September 10, 2015|work=Daytona Times|access-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref>

==Career as a public leader==
<!--- This section is hidden from readers until its formatting and citations can be improved


Four years after the Daytona School open its doors, the Afro-American Women’s Club, later called the M.E.C. Smith Woman’s Club, was organized as the first Black women’s club in Florida.<ref></ref> According to Wesley (1984), the club officially became the State Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs on October 27, 1927, in Tampa, Florida. The Florida Clubwomen worked:

<blockquote>
# To promote civic movements
# To advocate the cause of welfare units that are organized for moral, religious, social, literary and inter-racial advancement or progress
# To make plans of recreation for young women for their religious, civic, moral, social and industrial uplift
# To encourage the organization of clubs where such organizations do not exist
# To assist local clubs or club women in becoming more thoroughly acquainted with various kinds of community work
# To foster and promote the organization of women’s clubs in all parts of the State of Florida for the general and good betterment of humanity.<ref name=autogenerated1>Wesley, p. </ref></blockquote>

In 1916, Bethune became president of the Florida Federation. During the next two decades under her leadership, the Federation grew to include more than 60 clubs, in at least 20 cities, with at least 13 members in each.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>McCluskey and Smith, p. </ref> Bethune continued to demonstrate her commitment to education. The Federation and Bethune bought and led home for delinquent girls in [[Ocala, Florida]].<ref>Wesley, p. .</ref> The Home for Delinquent Girls "offered an alternative to incarceration with adults for up to twelve young black girls and women".<ref> Hanson, 2003, p. 98.</ref> According to Hanson, Bethune concentrated her energies in four areas: internal organization, American involvement in World War I, women's suffrage, and interracial cooperation.

According to Hanson, Bethune organized the Florida Club to operate in a "businesslike" manner<ref>Hanson, p. 96.</ref> The Club produced a newsletter, drafted a constitution, and held club conventions and was politically active. Bethune was a "field representative for black women on the Women’s Committee of the Council of National Defense" and through this role, the Florida Federation of Women’s Clubs organized a Daytona Beach chapter of the Circle of Negro War Relief (CNWR).<ref name="hanson97">Hanson, p. 97.</ref> The CNWR "promoted black women’s participation in the war effort"<ref name="hanson97"/> and was designed to meet the needs of Black veterans. Bethune, along with CNWR and the Florida Club, encouraged the entire Black community to get involved. They conducted voluntary food conservation drives, taught community members how to can and preserve food, and conducted fundraising efforts through food sales.<ref name=autogenerated2>Hanson, p. .</ref> The CNWR also established home demonstration and public health programs, improved recreational facilities and playgrounds for children, and founded the Mutual Protection League for Working Girls.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Bethune and the Florida Club women also "established Hostess Houses, became Traveler’s Aid workers ... and worked with Red Cross chapters to promote the inclusion of black nurses whenever possible".<ref name="hanson97"/> The women created care packages for the black men serving in the war. They "knitted goods for soldiers, supplied comfort kits, gum, records, phonographs, and home-cooked dinners, and gave lectures on social hygiene and race pride".<ref name="hanson97"/> Bethune supported the women's suffrage movement in 1920 by organizing a voter’s registration drive to be held at her school.  --->

===National Association of Colored Women===
In 1896, the [[National Association of Colored Women]] (NACW) was formed to promote the needs of black women. Bethune served as the Florida chapter president of the NACW from 1917 to 1925. She worked to register black voters, which was resisted by white society and had been made almost impossible by a variety of obstacles in Florida law and practices controlled by white administrators. She was threatened by members of the resurgent [[Ku Klux Klan]] in those years.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref name=" Bracey"/> Bethune also served as the president of the Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs from 1920 to 1925, which worked to improve opportunities for black women.

She was elected as national president of the NACW in 1924. While the organization struggled to raise funds for regular operations, Bethune envisioned it acquiring a headquarters and hiring a professional executive secretary; she implemented this when NACW bought a property at 1318 Vermont Avenue in Washington, DC. She led it to be the first black-controlled organization with headquarters in the capital.

Gaining a national reputation, in 1928 Bethune was invited to attend the Child Welfare Conference called by Republican President [[Calvin Coolidge]]. In 1930 President [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed her to the White House Conference on Child Health.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cookman.edu/about_bcu/history/our_founder.html|title=Our Founder – Dr. Bethune|website=www.cookman.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14}}</ref>

===Southeastern Association of Colored Women's Clubs===
The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women's Clubs) elected Bethune as president after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World Essays and Selected Documents|last=McCluskey and Smith|first=Audrey Thomas and Elaine M.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|pages=5–6}}</ref> They intended to reach out to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled ''Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation;'' it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights.<ref>122 June 30, 1921.

Facts On File, Inc.</ref> Within the state, however, and in other southern states, black men and women were largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy and comprehension tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and the need to keep and display records.

===National Council of Negro Women===
In 1935 Bethune founded the [[National Council of Negro Women]] (NCNW) in [[New York City]], bringing together representatives of 28 different organizations to work to improve the lives of black women and their communities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World Essays and Selected Documents|last=McCluskey and Smith|first=Audrey Thomas and Elaine M.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|pages=xii}}</ref> Bethune said of the council:

<blockquote>It is our pledge to make a lasting contribution to all that is finest and best in America, to cherish and enrich her heritage of freedom and progress by working for the [[Racial integration|integration]] of all her people regardless of race, creed, or national origin, into her spiritual, social, cultural, civic, and economic life, and thus aid her to achieve the glorious destiny of a true and unfettered [[democracy]].<ref name="new">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnw.org/about/bethune.htm |title=Mary McLeod Bethune |work=NCNW website |access-date=January 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124140528/http://www.ncnw.org/about/bethune.htm |archive-date=January 24, 2008 }}</ref></blockquote>

In 1938, the NCNW hosted the White House Conference on Negro Women and Children, demonstrating the importance of black women in democratic roles. During World War II, the NCNW gained approval for black women to be commissioned as officers in the [[Women's Army Corps]]. Bethune also served as a political appointee and the Special Assistant to the [[Secretary of War]] during the war.<ref name="Bracey"/>

In the 1990s, the headquarters for the National Council for Negro Women moved to Pennsylvania Avenue, centrally located between the White House and the U.S. Capitol. The former headquarters, where Bethune also lived at one time, has been designated as a [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Site]].

===National Youth Administration===

The [[National Youth Administration]] (NYA) was a federal agency created under Roosevelt's [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). It provided programs specifically to promote relief and employment for young people. It focused on unemployed citizens aged sixteen to twenty-five years who were not in school.<ref name=linsin>Linsin, Christopher E. "Something More than a Creed: Mary McLeod Bethune's Aim of Integrated Autonomy as Director of Negro Affairs," ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'' 76, no. 1 (1997): 20–41. https://www.jstor.org/stable/30148938 (accessed January 27, 2010).</ref> Bethune lobbied the organization so aggressively and effectively for minority involvement that she earned a full-time staff position in 1936 as an assistant.

Within two years, Bethune was appointed to a position of Director of the Division of Negro Affairs,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World Essays and Selected Documents|last=McCluskey and Smith|first=Audrey Thomas and Elaine M.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|pages=xii}}</ref> and as such, became the first African-American female division head.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=B.

She was the only black agent of the NYA who was a financial manager. She ensured black colleges participating in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]], which graduated some of the first black pilots.<ref name=" Bracey"/> The director of the NYA said in 1939: "No one can do what Mrs. Bethune can do."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Elaine M.|date=January 1996|title=Mary McLeod Bethune's "Last Will and Testament": A Legacy for Race Vindication|journal=The Journal of Negro History|language=en|volume=81|issue=1–4|pages=105–122|doi=10.1086/jnhv81n1-4p105|s2cid=141283003|issn=0022-2992}}</ref>

Bethune's determination helped national officials recognize the need to improve employment for black youth. The NYA's final report, issued in 1943 stated,

<blockquote>more than 300,000 black young men and women were given employment and work training on NYA projects. These projects opened to these youth, training opportunities and enabled the majority of them to qualify for jobs heretofore closed to them.<ref name=linsin/></blockquote>

Within the administration, Bethune advocated for the appointment of black NYA officials to positions of political power. Bethune's administrative assistants served as liaisons between the National Division of Negro Affairs and the NYA agencies on the state and local levels. The high number of administrative assistants composed a workforce commanded by Bethune. They helped gain a better job and salary opportunities for blacks across the country.<ref name="ross">Ross, Joyce B. "Mary Bethune and the National Youth Administration: A Case Study of Power Relationships in the Black Cabinet of Franklin D. Roosevelt," ''The Journal of Negro History'' 60, no. 1 (1975): 1–28. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716791 (accessed January 28, 2010).</ref> During her tenure, Bethune also pushed federal officials to approve a program of consumer education for blacks, and a foundation for black crippled children. She planned for studies for black workers' education councils. National officials did not support these due to inadequate funding and fear of duplicating the work of private non-governmental agencies.<ref name=ross/> The NYA was terminated in 1943.

===Black Cabinet===
[[File:(Mary McLeod Bethune), "Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt and others at the opening of Midway Hall, one of two residence halls buil - NARA - 533032.jpg|thumb|Mary McLeod Bethune (left) and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] (center), 1943]]
Bethune became a close and loyal friend of [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Eleanor]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. At the Southern Conference on Human Welfare in 1938, held in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Eleanor Roosevelt requested a seat next to Bethune despite state segregation laws. Roosevelt frequently referred to Bethune as "her closest friend in her age group."<ref>Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site (on [[National Park Service]] website) {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/teach-er-vk/lesson-plans/notes-er-and-civil-rights.htm|title=Eleanor Roosevelt and Civil Rights}} Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref> Bethune told black voters about the work being done on their behalf by the Roosevelt Administration and made their concerns known to the Roosevelts. She had unprecedented access to the [[White House]] through her relationship with the First Lady.<ref name="Bracey"/>

She used her access to form a coalition of leaders from black organizations called the [[Federal Council of Negro Affairs]], but which came to be known as the Black Cabinet. It served as an advisory board to the Roosevelt administration on issues facing black people in America. It was composed of numerous talented blacks, mostly men, who had been appointed to positions in federal agencies. This was the first collective of black people working in higher positions in government. It suggested to voters that the Roosevelt administration cared about black concerns. The group gathered in Bethune's office or apartment and met informally, rarely keeping minutes. Although as advisers they did not directly create public policy, they were a respected leadership among black voters; they influenced political appointments and disbursement of funds to organizations that would benefit black people.<ref>Weiss, Nancy.

===Civil rights===
In 1931 the Methodist Church supported merging of the Daytona Normal and Industrial School and the Cookman College for Men into Bethune-Cookman College, established first as a [[junior college]]. Bethune became a member of the church but it was segregated in the South. Essentially two organizations operated in the Methodist denomination. Bethune was prominent in the primarily black Florida Conference. While she worked to integrate the mostly white [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], she protested its initial plans for integration because they proposed separate jurisdictions based on race.<!--Explain - separate parishes?  --><ref>"Mary McLeod Bethune," ''Religious Leaders of America'', 2nd ed. Gale Group, 1999.</ref>

Bethune worked to educate both whites and blacks about the accomplishments and needs of black people, writing in 1938,

<blockquote>If our people are to fight their way up out of bondage we must arm them with the sword and the shield and buckler of pride – belief in themselves and their possibilities, based upon a sure knowledge of the achievements of the past.<ref name="bethuneJNH1938">Bethune, Mary (January 1938). "Clarifying our Vision With the Facts," ''Journal of Negro History''; 23 (1) pp. 10–15.</ref></blockquote>

A year later she wrote,

<blockquote>Not only the Negro child but children of all races should read and know of the achievements, accomplishments, and deeds of the Negro. World peace and brotherhood are based on a common understanding of the contributions and cultures of all races and creeds.<ref name="bethuneJNh1939">Bethune, Mary (January 1939). "The Adaptation of the History of the Negro to the Capacity of the Child," ''Journal of Negro History,'' 24 (1) pp. 9–13.</ref></blockquote>

On Sundays, she opened her school to tourists in Daytona Beach, showing off her students' accomplishments, hosting national speakers on black issues, and taking donations. She ensured that these Community Meetings were integrated. A black teenager in Daytona at the time later recalled: "Many tourists attended, sitting wherever there were empty seats. There was no special section for white people."<ref name="smith">Smith, Elaine (Winter, 1996). "Mary McLeod Bethune's 'Last Will and Testament': A Legacy for Race Vindication", ''Journal of Negro History'', '''8''' (1/4), pp. 105–122</ref>

When the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, Bethune defended the decision by writing in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' that year:

<blockquote>There can be no divided democracy, no class government, no half-free county, under the constitution. Therefore, there can be no discrimination, no segregation, no separation of some citizens from the rights which belong to all. ... We are on our way. But these are frontiers which we must conquer. ... We must gain full equality in education ... in the franchise ... in economic opportunity, and full equality in the abundance of life.<ref name="People's World">{{cite web|last1=Bethune|first1=Mary McLeod|title=Today in labor history: Mary McLeod Bethune born|url=http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/today-in-labor-history-mary-mcleod-bethune-born/|website=People's World|publisher=Long View Publishing Co.|access-date=1 February 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Bethune organized the first [[officer candidate school]]s for black women. She lobbied federal officials, including Roosevelt, on behalf of African-American women who wanted to join the military.

=== United Negro College Fund ===
She co-founded the [[UNCF|United Negro College Fund]] (UNCF) on April 25, 1944, with [[William J. Trent]] and [[Frederick D. Patterson]]. The UNCF is a program which gives many different scholarships, mentorships, and job opportunities to African American and minority students attending any of the 37 historically black colleges and universities. Trent had joined Patterson and Bethune in raising money for UNCF. The organization started in 1944 and by 1964, Trent had raised over 50 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/72-years-later-united-negro-college-fund-continues-close-college-funding-gap-minorities|title=72 years later: United Negro College Fund continues to close college funding gap for minorities|last=Moffitt|first=Kelly|website=news.stlpublicradio.org|publisher=St. Louis Public Radio|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/blogs/article_1fa8d694-e92f-11e4-bd92-03ade7697779.html|title=African-American Facts for Week of: April 19, 2015|last=Johnson|first=Annette|website=Indianapolis Recorder Newspaper|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/beyonce-balmain-collaboration-coachella-outfits-charity-united-negro-college-fund-a8443536.html|title=BEYONCE ANNOUNCES BALMAIN COLLABORATION WHERE ALL PROCEEDS WILL GO TO CHARITY|date=2018-07-12|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>

==Death and accolades==
On May 18, 1955, Bethune died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Her death was followed by editorial tributes in African-American newspapers across the United States. The [[Oklahoma City]] ''Black Dispatch'' stated she was, "Exhibit No. 1 for all who have faith in America and the democratic process." The ''Atlanta Daily World'' said her life was, "One of the most dramatic careers ever enacted at any time upon the stage of human activity." And the ''Pittsburgh Courier'' wrote, "In any race or nation she would have been an outstanding personality and made a noteworthy contribution because her chief attribute was her indomitable soul."

The mainstream press praised her as well. ''[[Christian Century]]'' suggested, "the story of her life should be taught to every school child for generations to come." The ''[[New York Times]]'' noted she was, "one of the most potent factors in the growth of interracial goodwill in America." The ''[[Washington Post]]'' said: "So great were her dynamism and force that it was almost impossible to resist her ... Not only her own people, but all America has been enriched and ennobled by her courageous, ebullient spirit." Her hometown newspaper, the ''Daytona Beach Evening News'' printed, "To some, she seemed unreal, something that could not be. ... What right had she to greatness? ... The lesson of Mrs. Bethune's life is that genius knows no racial barriers."<ref name="Bracey"/>

==Personal life==
[[File:Mary McLeod Bethune - NARA - 559194.tif|thumb|upright|Painting of Bethune by [[Betsy Graves Reyneau]]]]

Bethune was described as "[[ebony]]" in complexion. She carried a cane, not for support but for effect. She said it gave her "swank". She was a [[teetotaler]] and preached [[Temperance movement|temperance]] for African Americans, taking opportunities to chastise drunken blacks she encountered in public.<ref name=" Bracey"/> Bethune said more than once that the school and the students in Daytona were her first family, and that her son and extended family came second. Her students often referred to her as "Mama Bethune".

She was noted for achieving her goals. Dr. [[Robert C. Weaver|Robert Weaver]], who also served in Roosevelt's Black Cabinet, said of her, "She had the most marvelous gift of effecting feminine helplessness in order to attain her aims with masculine ruthlessness."<ref>Weaver, Robert (July 10, 1974). "Her Boys Remember," ''Time.'' (special publication of the National Council of Negro Women).</ref> When a white Daytona resident threatened Bethune's students with a rifle, Bethune worked to make an ally of him. The director of the McLeod Hospital recalled, "Mrs. Bethune treated him with courtesy and developed such goodwill in him that we found him protecting the children and going so far as to say, 'If anybody bothers old Mary, I will protect her with my life.'"<ref>Adams, Texas, "As I Recollect," typescript, BF.</ref>

Self-sufficiency was a high priority throughout her life. Bethune invested in several businesses, including the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'', a black newspaper, and many life insurance companies. She founded Central Life Insurance of Florida. She eventually retired in Florida. Due to state segregation, blacks were not allowed to visit the beach. Bethune and several other business owners invested in Paradise Beach: they purchased a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of beach and the surrounding properties, selling these to black families. They did allow white families to visit the waterfront. Paradise Beach was later renamed as Bethune-Volusia Beach in her honor. She also was a one-fourth owner of the Welricha Motel in Daytona.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://web.naplesnews.com/03/10/florida/e19482a.htm |author=Matt Grimson |title=Historically black beach disappears with integration |work=Naples Daily News |date=October 13, 2003 |access-date=January 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030440/http://web.naplesnews.com/03/10/florida/e19482a.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref>

Born in [[Mayesville, South Carolina]], to parents who had been slaves, she started working in fields with her family at age five. She took an early interest in becoming educated; with the help of benefactors, Bethune attended college hoping to become a [[missionary]] in Africa. She started a school for African-American girls in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. It later merged with a private institute for African-American boys and was known as the Bethune-Cookman School. Bethune maintained high standards and promoted the school with tourists and donors, to demonstrate what educated African Americans could do. She was president of the college from 1923 to 1942, and 1946 to 1947. She was one of the few women in the world to serve as a college president at that time.

Bethune was also active in women's clubs, which were strong civic organizations supporting welfare and other needs, and became a national leader. Bethune wrote prolifically, publishing in ''National Notes'' from 1924–1928, ''Pittsburgh Courier'' from 1937–1938, ''Aframerican Women’s Journal'' from 1940–1949, and ''Chicago Defender'' from 1948–1955, among others.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World Essays and Selected Documents|last=McCluskey and Smith|first=Audrey Thomas and Elaine M|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|pages=304}}</ref> After working on the presidential campaign for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, she was invited as a member of his "Black Cabinet." She advised him on concerns of African Americans and helped share Roosevelt's message and achievements with blacks, who had historically been Republican voters since the Civil War. At the time, blacks had been largely [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised in the South]] since the turn of the century, so she was speaking to black voters across the North.

==Early life and education==
[[File: Mary McLeod Bethune Cabin.jpg|thumb|200 px|The cabin in Mayesville, South Carolina 
where Mary McLeod was born]]

McLeod was born in 1875 in a small log cabin near [[Mayesville, South Carolina]], on a rice and cotton farm in [[Sumter County, South Carolina|Sumter County]]. She was the fifteenth of seventeen children born to Sam and Patsy (McIntosh) McLeod, both former slaves.<ref name="cookhouse">{{cite web|url=http://www.cookman.edu/subpages/Founder_of_the_College.asp |title=Bethune Cookman College Founder's Biography |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929001618/http://www.cookman.edu/subpages/Founder_of_the_College.asp |archive-date=2007-09-29 }} Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref><ref name="ineffable">Landfall, Dolores and Sims, J.

Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref> Most of her siblings had been born into slavery. Her mother worked for her former master, and her father farmed cotton near a large house they called "The Homestead."

Her parents wanted to be independent so they had sacrificed to buy a farm for the family. As a child, Mary would accompany her mother to deliver "white people's" wash. Allowed to go into the white children's nursery, Mary became fascinated with their toys. One day she picked up a book and as she opened it, a white child snatched it away from her, babbling she didn't know how to read. Mary decided then that the only difference between white and colored people was the ability to read and write.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martins|first=Susan|title=Mary Mcleod Bethune|year=2006|publisher=Wright Group}}</ref> She was inspired to learn.

McLeod attended Mayesville's one-room black schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School, which was run by the [[Presbyterian]] Board of Missions of [[Freedmen]]. She was the only child in her family to attend school, so each day, she taught her family what she had learned. To get to and from school, Mary walked five miles each day. Her teacher Emma Jane Wilson became a significant mentor in her life.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Wilson had attended [[Barber-Scotia College#Scotia Seminary|Scotia Seminary]] (now [[Barber-Scotia College]]). She helped McLeod attend the same school on a scholarship, which she did from 1888–1893. The following year, she attended [[Dwight L. Moody]]'s Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in [[Chicago]] (now the [[Moody Bible Institute]]), hoping to become a [[missionary]] in Africa. Told that black missionaries were not needed, she planned to teach, as education was a prime goal among African Americans.<ref>https://www.moody.edu/alumni/connect/news/2020/bethune/?utm_campaign=AA_April%20Newsletter_2020_EML%201_Alumni&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua</ref>

==Marriage and family==
McLeod married Albertus Bethune in 1898. They moved to [[Savannah, Georgia]], where she did social work up until the Bethunes made the move to Florida. They had a son, named Albert. Coyden Harold Uggams, a visiting Presbyterian minister, persuaded the couple to relocate to [[Palatka, Florida]], to run a mission school.<Ref>"Mary McLeod Bethune", ''Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History''. Gale Group, 1999.</ref> The Bethunes moved in 1899; Mary ran the mission school and began an outreach to prisoners. Albertus left the family in 1907; he never got a divorce but relocated to South Carolina. He died in 1918 from [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Bracey">Smith, Elaine. "Introduction."

==Teaching career==

===Foundations with Lucy Craft Laney===
Bethune worked as a teacher briefly at her former elementary school in Sumter County. In 1896, she began teaching at Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in [[Augusta, Georgia]], which was part of a [[Presbyterian]] mission organized by northern congregations. It was founded and run by [[Lucy Craft Laney]]. As the daughter of former slaves, Laney ran her school with a [[Christians|Christian]] missionary zeal, emphasizing character and practical education for girls. She also accepted the boys who showed up eager to learn. Laney's mission was to imbue Christian moral education in her students to arm them for their life challenges. Of her year at Laney's school, Bethune said,

<blockquote>I was so impressed with her fearlessness, her amazing touch in every respect, an energy that seemed inexhaustible and her mighty power to command respect and admiration from her students and all who knew her. She handled her domain with the art of a master.<ref name="mccluskey1"/></blockquote>

Bethune adopted many of Laney's educational philosophies, including her emphasis on educating girls and women to improve the conditions of black people: "I believe that the greatest hope for the development of my race lies in training our women thoroughly and practically."<ref>Bethune, Mary (April 16, 1920). "Letter to the Editor" in ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> (This is a strategy being followed by organizers in numerous developing countries. Educating women raises the lives of families as a whole.) After one year at Haines, Bethune was transferred by the Presbyterian mission to the Kindell Institute in [[Sumter, South Carolina]], where she had met her current husband.'''

===School in Daytona===
[[File:Daytona School with Bethune.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|Mary McLeod Bethune with girls from the Literary and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls in Daytona, c. 1905.]] After her marriage and move to Florida, Bethune became determined to start a school for girls. Bethune moved from Palatka to Daytona because it had more economic opportunity; it had become a popular tourist destination and businesses were thriving. In October 1904, she rented a small house for $11.00 per month. She made benches and desks from discarded crates and acquired other items through charity. Bethune used $1.50 to start the Educational and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls.<ref>{{cite web

Bethune, parents of students, and church members raised money by making sweet potato pies, ice cream, and fried fish, and selling them to crews at the dump.

In the early days, the students made ink for pens from [[elderberry]] juice, and pencils from burned wood; they asked local businesses for furniture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCluskey|first1=Audrey Thomas|last2=Smith|first2=Elaine M.|title=Mary McLeod Bethune, Building a Better World: Essays and Selected Documents|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=025321503X|page=67}}</ref> Bethune wrote later, "I considered cash money as the smallest part of my resources. I had faith in a loving God, faith in myself, and a desire to serve."<ref>Straub, Deborah, ed., "Mary McLeod Bethune," ''Contemporary Heroes and Heroines,'' Book II. Gale Research, 1992.</ref> The school received donations of money, equipment, and labor from local black churches. Within a year, Bethune was teaching more than 30 girls at the school.

Bethune also courted wealthy white organizations, such as the ladies' Palmetto Club. She invited influential white men to sit on her school board of trustees, gaining participation by [[James Gamble (industrialist)|James Gamble]] (of [[Procter & Gamble]]) and [[Thomas H. White]] (of [[White Sewing Machine Company|White Sewing Machines]]). When [[Booker T. Washington]] of [[Tuskegee Institute]] visited in 1912, he advised her of the importance of gaining support by white [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]]s for funding.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Bethune had met with Washington in 1896 and was impressed by his clout with his donors.[[File:Marian Anderson and Mary McLeod Bethune at the launching of the SS Booker T Washington - 29 Sept 1942.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|[[Marian Anderson]] celebrated contralto and Mary McLeod Bethune, Director of Negro Affairs in the National Youth Administration at the launching of the SS Booker T. Washington with unidentified workers who helped construct the first Liberty ship named for an African American at the California Shipbuilding Corporation's yards by [[Alfred T. Palmer]].]]

The rigorous curriculum had the girls rise at 5:30&nbsp;a.m. for Bible study. The classes in home economics and industrial skills such as dressmaking, millinery, cooking, and other crafts emphasized a life of [[self-sufficiency]] for them as women. Students' days ended at 9 pm. Soon Bethune added science and business courses, then high school-level courses of math, English, and foreign languages.<ref name="mccluskey1">McCluskey. Audrey. " 'We Specialize in the Wholly Impossible:' Black Women School Founders," ''Signs'', Winter 1997, pp. 403–426.</ref> <!--Needs expansion; how many students by 1910, say, and 1920, 1930. When exactly were high school classes added? How many teachers?--> Bethune was always seeking donations to keep her school operating; as she traveled, she was fundraising. A donation of $62,000 by [[John D. Rockefeller]] helped, as did her friendship with Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife, beginning in the 1930s, who gave her entree to a progressive network.

In 1931, the [[Methodist Church]] helped the merger of her school with the boys' Cookman Institute, forming the Bethune-Cookman College, a coeducational junior college. Bethune became president. Through the [[Great Depression]], Bethune-Cookman School continued to operate and met the educational standards of the State of Florida. From 1936 to 1942, Bethune had to cut back her time as president because of her duties in [[Washington, DC]]. Funding declined during this period of her absence. But, by 1941 the college had developed a four-year curriculum and achieved full college status.<ref name="Bracey"/> By 1942 Bethune gave up the presidency, as her health was being adversely affected by her many responsibilities. On September 19, 1942, she gave the address at the Los Angeles, California, launching ceremony for the Liberty ship {{SS|Booker T. Washington||2}}, a ceremony in which [[Marian Anderson]] christened the ship.<ref name=NPS>{{cite document |title=Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park, Kaiser Shipyard No. 3 (Historic American Engineering Record CA-326=M) |publisher=National Park Service |page=169|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/ca/ca3300/ca3398/data/ca3398data.pdf |access-date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

== Impact on Daytona Beach Community ==

=== McLeod Hospital ===
As of the early 1900s, Daytona Beach, Florida, was lacking a hospital that would help people of color. Bethune had the idea to start a hospital after an incident involving one of her students. She was called to the bedside of a young female student who fell ill with acute appendicitis. It was clear that the student needed immediate medical attention, yet there was no local hospital to take her to that would treat black people. Bethune demanded that the white physician at the local hospital help the girl. When Bethune went to visit her student, she was asked to enter through the back door. At the hospital, she found that her student had been neglected, ill-cared for and segregated on an outdoor porch.

Out of this experience, Bethune decided that the black community in Daytona needed a hospital. She found a cabin near the school and through sponsors helping her raise money, she purchased it for five thousand dollars. In 1911, Bethune opened the first black hospital in Daytona, Florida. It started with two beds and within a few years, held twenty. Both white and black physicians worked at the hospital, along with Bethune's student nurses. This hospital went on to save many black lives within the twenty years that it operated. During that time, both black and white people in the community relied on the help from the McLeod hospital. After an explosion at a nearby construction site, the hospital took in injured black workers. The hospital and its nurses were also praised for their efforts with a 1918 influenza outbreak. During this outbreak, the hospital was full and had to overflow into the school's auditorium.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune|last=Peare|first=Catherine|publisher=The Vanguard Press, Inc.|year=1951|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune|last=Greenfield|first=Eloise|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|year=1977|isbn=0-690-01129-6|location=New York, NY}}</ref> In 1931, Daytona's public hospital, Halifax, agreed to open a separate hospital for people of color. Black people would not fully integrate to the public hospital's main location until the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://daytonatimes.com/2015/09/black-daytona-beach-in-the-1940s/|title=Black Daytona Beach in the 1940s|last=Lempel|first=Leonard|date=September 10, 2015|work=Daytona Times|access-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref>

==Career as a public leader==
<!--- This section is hidden from readers until its formatting and citations can be improved


Four years after the Daytona School open its doors, the Afro-American Women’s Club, later called the M.E.C. Smith Woman’s Club, was organized as the first Black women’s club in Florida.<ref></ref> According to Wesley (1984), the club officially became the State Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs on October 27, 1927, in Tampa, Florida. The Florida Clubwomen worked:

<blockquote>
# To promote civic movements
# To advocate the cause of welfare units that are organized for moral, religious, social, literary and inter-racial advancement or progress
# To make plans of recreation for young women for their religious, civic, moral, social and industrial uplift
# To encourage the organization of clubs where such organizations do not exist
# To assist local clubs or club women in becoming more thoroughly acquainted with various kinds of community work
# To foster and promote the organization of women’s clubs in all parts of the State of Florida for the general and good betterment of humanity.<ref name=autogenerated1>Wesley, p. </ref></blockquote>

In 1916, Bethune became president of the Florida Federation. During the next two decades under her leadership, the Federation grew to include more than 60 clubs, in at least 20 cities, with at least 13 members in each.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>McCluskey and Smith, p. </ref> Bethune continued to demonstrate her commitment to education. The Federation and Bethune bought and led home for delinquent girls in [[Ocala, Florida]].<ref>Wesley, p. .</ref> The Home for Delinquent Girls "offered an alternative to incarceration with adults for up to twelve young black girls and women".<ref> Hanson, 2003, p. 98.</ref> According to Hanson, Bethune concentrated her energies in four areas: internal organization, American involvement in World War I, women's suffrage, and interracial cooperation.

According to Hanson, Bethune organized the Florida Club to operate in a "businesslike" manner<ref>Hanson, p. 96.</ref> The Club produced a newsletter, drafted a constitution, and held club conventions and was politically active. Bethune was a "field representative for black women on the Women’s Committee of the Council of National Defense" and through this role, the Florida Federation of Women’s Clubs organized a Daytona Beach chapter of the Circle of Negro War Relief (CNWR).<ref name="hanson97">Hanson, p. 97.</ref> The CNWR "promoted black women’s participation in the war effort"<ref name="hanson97"/> and was designed to meet the needs of Black veterans. Bethune, along with CNWR and the Florida Club, encouraged the entire Black community to get involved. They conducted voluntary food conservation drives, taught community members how to can and preserve food, and conducted fundraising efforts through food sales.<ref name=autogenerated2>Hanson, p. .</ref> The CNWR also established home demonstration and public health programs, improved recreational facilities and playgrounds for children, and founded the Mutual Protection League for Working Girls.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Bethune and the Florida Club women also "established Hostess Houses, became Traveler’s Aid workers ... and worked with Red Cross chapters to promote the inclusion of black nurses whenever possible".<ref name="hanson97"/> The women created care packages for the black men serving in the war. They "knitted goods for soldiers, supplied comfort kits, gum, records, phonographs, and home-cooked dinners, and gave lectures on social hygiene and race pride".<ref name="hanson97"/> Bethune supported the women's suffrage movement in 1920 by organizing a voter’s registration drive to be held at her school.  --->

===National Association of Colored Women===
In 1896, the [[National Association of Colored Women]] (NACW) was formed to promote the needs of black women. Bethune served as the Florida chapter president of the NACW from 1917 to 1925. She worked to register black voters, which was resisted by white society and had been made almost impossible by a variety of obstacles in Florida law and practices controlled by white administrators. She was threatened by members of the resurgent [[Ku Klux Klan]] in those years.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref name=" Bracey"/> Bethune also served as the president of the Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs from 1920 to 1925, which worked to improve opportunities for black women.

She was elected as national president of the NACW in 1924. While the organization struggled to raise funds for regular operations, Bethune envisioned it acquiring a headquarters and hiring a professional executive secretary; she implemented this when NACW bought a property at 1318 Vermont Avenue in Washington, DC. She led it to be the first black-controlled organization with headquarters in the capital.

Gaining a national reputation, in 1928 Bethune was invited to attend the Child Welfare Conference called by Republican President [[Calvin Coolidge]]. In 1930 President [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed her to the White House Conference on Child Health.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cookman.edu/about_bcu/history/our_founder.html|title=Our Founder – Dr. Bethune|website=www.cookman.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14}}</ref>

===Southeastern Association of Colored Women's Clubs===
The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women's Clubs) elected Bethune as president after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World Essays and Selected Documents|last=McCluskey and Smith|first=Audrey Thomas and Elaine M.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|pages=5–6}}</ref> They intended to reach out to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled ''Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation;'' it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights.<ref>122 June 30, 1921.

===National Council of Negro Women===
In 1935 Bethune founded the [[National Council of Negro Women]] (NCNW) in [[New York City]], bringing together representatives of 28 different organizations to work to improve the lives of black women and their communities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World Essays and Selected Documents|last=McCluskey and Smith|first=Audrey Thomas and Elaine M.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|pages=xii}}</ref> Bethune said of the council:

<blockquote>It is our pledge to make a lasting contribution to all that is finest and best in America, to cherish and enrich her heritage of freedom and progress by working for the [[Racial integration|integration]] of all her people regardless of race, creed, or national origin, into her spiritual, social, cultural, civic, and economic life, and thus aid her to achieve the glorious destiny of a true and unfettered [[democracy]].<ref name="new">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnw.org/about/bethune.htm |title=Mary McLeod Bethune |work=NCNW website |access-date=January 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124140528/http://www.ncnw.org/about/bethune.htm |archive-date=January 24, 2008 }}</ref></blockquote>

In 1938, the NCNW hosted the White House Conference on Negro Women and Children, demonstrating the importance of black women in democratic roles. During World War II, the NCNW gained approval for black women to be commissioned as officers in the [[Women's Army Corps]]. Bethune also served as a political appointee and the Special Assistant to the [[Secretary of War]] during the war.<ref name="Bracey"/>

In the 1990s, the headquarters for the National Council for Negro Women moved to Pennsylvania Avenue, centrally located between the White House and the U.S. Capitol. The former headquarters, where Bethune also lived at one time, has been designated as a [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Site]].

===National Youth Administration===

The [[National Youth Administration]] (NYA) was a federal agency created under Roosevelt's [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). It provided programs specifically to promote relief and employment for young people. It focused on unemployed citizens aged sixteen to twenty-five years who were not in school.<ref name=linsin>Linsin, Christopher E. "Something More than a Creed: Mary McLeod Bethune's Aim of Integrated Autonomy as Director of Negro Affairs," ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'' 76, no. 1 (1997): 20–41. https://www.jstor.org/stable/30148938 (accessed January 27, 2010).</ref> Bethune lobbied the organization so aggressively and effectively for minority involvement that she earned a full-time staff position in 1936 as an assistant.

Within two years, Bethune was appointed to a position of Director of the Division of Negro Affairs,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World Essays and Selected Documents|last=McCluskey and Smith|first=Audrey Thomas and Elaine M.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|pages=xii}}</ref> and as such, became the first African-American female division head.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=B.

She was the only black agent of the NYA who was a financial manager. She ensured black colleges participating in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]], which graduated some of the first black pilots.<ref name=" Bracey"/> The director of the NYA said in 1939: "No one can do what Mrs. Bethune can do."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Elaine M.|date=January 1996|title=Mary McLeod Bethune's "Last Will and Testament": A Legacy for Race Vindication|journal=The Journal of Negro History|language=en|volume=81|issue=1–4|pages=105–122|doi=10.1086/jnhv81n1-4p105|s2cid=141283003|issn=0022-2992}}</ref>

Bethune's determination helped national officials recognize the need to improve employment for black youth. The NYA's final report, issued in 1943 stated,

<blockquote>more than 300,000 black young men and women were given employment and work training on NYA projects. These projects opened to these youth, training opportunities and enabled the majority of them to qualify for jobs heretofore closed to them.<ref name=linsin/></blockquote>

Within the administration, Bethune advocated for the appointment of black NYA officials to positions of political power. Bethune's administrative assistants served as liaisons between the National Division of Negro Affairs and the NYA agencies on the state and local levels. The high number of administrative assistants composed a workforce commanded by Bethune. They helped gain a better job and salary opportunities for blacks across the country.<ref name="ross">Ross, Joyce B. "Mary Bethune and the National Youth Administration: A Case Study of Power Relationships in the Black Cabinet of Franklin D. Roosevelt," ''The Journal of Negro History'' 60, no. 1 (1975): 1–28. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716791 (accessed January 28, 2010).</ref> During her tenure, Bethune also pushed federal officials to approve a program of consumer education for blacks, and a foundation for black crippled children. She planned for studies for black workers' education councils. National officials did not support these due to inadequate funding and fear of duplicating the work of private non-governmental agencies.<ref name=ross/> The NYA was terminated in 1943.

===Black Cabinet===
[[File:(Mary McLeod Bethune), "Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt and others at the opening of Midway Hall, one of two residence halls buil - NARA - 533032.jpg|thumb|Mary McLeod Bethune (left) and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] (center), 1943]]
Bethune became a close and loyal friend of [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Eleanor]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. At the Southern Conference on Human Welfare in 1938, held in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Eleanor Roosevelt requested a seat next to Bethune despite state segregation laws. Roosevelt frequently referred to Bethune as "her closest friend in her age group."<ref>Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site (on [[National Park Service]] website) {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/teach-er-vk/lesson-plans/notes-er-and-civil-rights.htm|title=Eleanor Roosevelt and Civil Rights}} Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref> Bethune told black voters about the work being done on their behalf by the Roosevelt Administration and made their concerns known to the Roosevelts. She had unprecedented access to the [[White House]] through her relationship with the First Lady.<ref name="Bracey"/>

She used her access to form a coalition of leaders from black organizations called the [[Federal Council of Negro Affairs]], but which came to be known as the Black Cabinet. It served as an advisory board to the Roosevelt administration on issues facing black people in America. It was composed of numerous talented blacks, mostly men, who had been appointed to positions in federal agencies. This was the first collective of black people working in higher positions in government. It suggested to voters that the Roosevelt administration cared about black concerns. The group gathered in Bethune's office or apartment and met informally, rarely keeping minutes. Although as advisers they did not directly create public policy, they were a respected leadership among black voters; they influenced political appointments and disbursement of funds to organizations that would benefit black people.<ref>Weiss, Nancy. (1983) ''Farewell to the Party of Lincoln; Black Politics in the Age of FDR''. Princeton University Press {{ISBN|0-691-04703-0}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

===Civil rights===
In 1931 the Methodist Church supported merging of the Daytona Normal and Industrial School and the Cookman College for Men into Bethune-Cookman College, established first as a [[junior college]]. Bethune became a member of the church but it was segregated in the South. Essentially two organizations operated in the Methodist denomination. Bethune was prominent in the primarily black Florida Conference. While she worked to integrate the mostly white [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], she protested its initial plans for integration because they proposed separate jurisdictions based on race.<!--Explain - separate parishes?  --><ref>"Mary McLeod Bethune," ''Religious Leaders of America'', 2nd ed. Gale Group, 1999.</ref>

Bethune worked to educate both whites and blacks about the accomplishments and needs of black people, writing in 1938,

<blockquote>If our people are to fight their way up out of bondage we must arm them with the sword and the shield and buckler of pride – belief in themselves and their possibilities, based upon a sure knowledge of the achievements of the past.<ref name="bethuneJNH1938">Bethune, Mary (January 1938). "Clarifying our Vision With the Facts," ''Journal of Negro History''; 23 (1) pp. 10–15.</ref></blockquote>

A year later she wrote,

<blockquote>Not only the Negro child but children of all races should read and know of the achievements, accomplishments, and deeds of the Negro. World peace and brotherhood are based on a common understanding of the contributions and cultures of all races and creeds.<ref name="bethuneJNh1939">Bethune, Mary (January 1939). "The Adaptation of the History of the Negro to the Capacity of the Child," ''Journal of Negro History,'' 24 (1) pp. 9–13.</ref></blockquote>

On Sundays, she opened her school to tourists in Daytona Beach, showing off her students' accomplishments, hosting national speakers on black issues, and taking donations. She ensured that these Community Meetings were integrated. A black teenager in Daytona at the time later recalled: "Many tourists attended, sitting wherever there were empty seats. There was no special section for white people."<ref name="smith">Smith, Elaine (Winter, 1996). "Mary McLeod Bethune's 'Last Will and Testament': A Legacy for Race Vindication", ''Journal of Negro History'', '''8''' (1/4), pp. 105–122</ref>

When the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, Bethune defended the decision by writing in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' that year:

<blockquote>There can be no divided democracy, no class government, no half-free county, under the constitution. Therefore, there can be no discrimination, no segregation, no separation of some citizens from the rights which belong to all. ... We are on our way. But these are frontiers which we must conquer. ... We must gain full equality in education ... in the franchise ... in economic opportunity, and full equality in the abundance of life.<ref name="People's World">{{cite web|last1=Bethune|first1=Mary McLeod|title=Today in labor history: Mary McLeod Bethune born|url=http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/today-in-labor-history-mary-mcleod-bethune-born/|website=People's World|publisher=Long View Publishing Co.|access-date=1 February 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Bethune organized the first [[officer candidate school]]s for black women. She lobbied federal officials, including Roosevelt, on behalf of African-American women who wanted to join the military.

=== United Negro College Fund ===
She co-founded the [[UNCF|United Negro College Fund]] (UNCF) on April 25, 1944, with [[William J. Trent]] and [[Frederick D. Patterson]]. The UNCF is a program which gives many different scholarships, mentorships, and job opportunities to African American and minority students attending any of the 37 historically black colleges and universities. Trent had joined Patterson and Bethune in raising money for UNCF. The organization started in 1944 and by 1964, Trent had raised over 50 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/72-years-later-united-negro-college-fund-continues-close-college-funding-gap-minorities|title=72 years later: United Negro College Fund continues to close college funding gap for minorities|last=Moffitt|first=Kelly|website=news.stlpublicradio.org|publisher=St. Louis Public Radio|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/blogs/article_1fa8d694-e92f-11e4-bd92-03ade7697779.html|title=African-American Facts for Week of: April 19, 2015|last=Johnson|first=Annette|website=Indianapolis Recorder Newspaper|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/beyonce-balmain-collaboration-coachella-outfits-charity-united-negro-college-fund-a8443536.html|title=BEYONCE ANNOUNCES BALMAIN COLLABORATION WHERE ALL PROCEEDS WILL GO TO CHARITY|date=2018-07-12|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>

==Death and accolades==
On May 18, 1955, Bethune died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Her death was followed by editorial tributes in African-American newspapers across the United States. The [[Oklahoma City]] ''Black Dispatch'' stated she was, "Exhibit No. 1 for all who have faith in America and the democratic process." The ''Atlanta Daily World'' said her life was, "One of the most dramatic careers ever enacted at any time upon the stage of human activity." And the ''Pittsburgh Courier'' wrote, "In any race or nation she would have been an outstanding personality and made a noteworthy contribution because her chief attribute was her indomitable soul."

The mainstream press praised her as well. ''[[Christian Century]]'' suggested, "the story of her life should be taught to every school child for generations to come." The ''[[New York Times]]'' noted she was, "one of the most potent factors in the growth of interracial goodwill in America." The ''[[Washington Post]]'' said: "So great were her dynamism and force that it was almost impossible to resist her ... Not only her own people, but all America has been enriched and ennobled by her courageous, ebullient spirit." Her hometown newspaper, the ''Daytona Beach Evening News'' printed, "To some, she seemed unreal, something that could not be. ... What right had she to greatness? ... The lesson of Mrs. Bethune's life is that genius knows no racial barriers."<ref name="Bracey"/>

==Personal life==
[[File:Mary McLeod Bethune - NARA - 559194.tif|thumb|upright|Painting of Bethune by [[Betsy Graves Reyneau]]]]

Bethune was described as "[[ebony]]" in complexion. She carried a cane, not for support but for effect. She said it gave her "swank". She was a [[teetotaler]] and preached [[Temperance movement|temperance]] for African Americans, taking opportunities to chastise drunken blacks she encountered in public.<ref name=" Bracey"/> Bethune said more than once that the school and the students in Daytona were her first family, and that her son and extended family came second. Her students often referred to her as "Mama Bethune".

She was noted for achieving her goals. Dr. [[Robert C. Weaver|Robert Weaver]], who also served in Roosevelt's Black Cabinet, said of her, "She had the most marvelous gift of effecting feminine helplessness in order to attain her aims with masculine ruthlessness."<ref>Weaver, Robert (July 10, 1974). "Her Boys Remember," ''Time.'' (special publication of the National Council of Negro Women).</ref> When a white Daytona resident threatened Bethune's students with a rifle, Bethune worked to make an ally of him. The director of the McLeod Hospital recalled, "Mrs. Bethune treated him with courtesy and developed such goodwill in him that we found him protecting the children and going so far as to say, 'If anybody bothers old Mary, I will protect her with my life.'"<ref>Adams, Texas, "As I Recollect," typescript, BF.</ref>

Self-sufficiency was a high priority throughout her life. Bethune invested in several businesses, including the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'', a black newspaper, and many life insurance companies. She founded Central Life Insurance of Florida. She eventually retired in Florida. Due to state segregation, blacks were not allowed to visit the beach. Bethune and several other business owners invested in Paradise Beach: they purchased a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of beach and the surrounding properties, selling these to black families. They did allow white families to visit the waterfront. Paradise Beach was later renamed as Bethune-Volusia Beach in her honor. She also was a one-fourth owner of the Welricha Motel in Daytona.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://web.naplesnews.com/03/10/florida/e19482a.htm |author=Matt Grimson |title=Historically black beach disappears with integration |work=Naples Daily News |date=October 13, 2003 |access-date=January 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030440/http://web.naplesnews.com/03/10/florida/e19482a.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref>

Born in [[Mayesville, South Carolina]], to parents who had been slaves, she started working in fields with her family at age five. She took an early interest in becoming educated; with the help of benefactors, Bethune attended college hoping to become a [[missionary]] in Africa. She started a school for African-American girls in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. It later merged with a private institute for African-American boys and was known as the Bethune-Cookman School. Bethune maintained high standards and promoted the school with tourists and donors, to demonstrate what educated African Americans could do. She was president of the college from 1923 to 1942, and 1946 to 1947. She was one of the few women in the world to serve as a college president at that time.

Bethune was also active in women's clubs, which were strong civic organizations supporting welfare and other needs, and became a national leader. Bethune wrote prolifically, publishing in ''National Notes'' from 1924–1928, ''Pittsburgh Courier'' from 1937–1938, ''Aframerican Women’s Journal'' from 1940–1949, and ''Chicago Defender'' from 1948–1955, among others.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World Essays and Selected Documents|last=McCluskey and Smith|first=Audrey Thomas and Elaine M|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|pages=304}}</ref> After working on the presidential campaign for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, she was invited as a member of his "Black Cabinet." She advised him on concerns of African Americans and helped share Roosevelt's message and achievements with blacks, who had historically been Republican voters since the Civil War. At the time, blacks had been largely [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised in the South]] since the turn of the century, so she was speaking to black voters across the North.

==Early life and education==
[[File: Mary McLeod Bethune Cabin.jpg|thumb|200 px|The cabin in Mayesville, South Carolina 
where Mary McLeod was born]]

McLeod was born in 1875 in a small log cabin near [[Mayesville, South Carolina]], on a rice and cotton farm in [[Sumter County, South Carolina|Sumter County]]. She was the fifteenth of seventeen children born to Sam and Patsy (McIntosh) McLeod, both former slaves.<ref name="cookhouse">{{cite web|url=http://www.cookman.edu/subpages/Founder_of_the_College.asp |title=Bethune Cookman College Founder's Biography |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929001618/http://www.cookman.edu/subpages/Founder_of_the_College.asp |archive-date=2007-09-29 }} Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref><ref name="ineffable">Landfall, Dolores and Sims, J.

Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref> Most of her siblings had been born into slavery. Her mother worked for her former master, and her father farmed cotton near a large house they called "The Homestead."

Her parents wanted to be independent so they had sacrificed to buy a farm for the family. As a child, Mary would accompany her mother to deliver "white people's" wash. Allowed to go into the white children's nursery, Mary became fascinated with their toys. One day she picked up a book and as she opened it, a white child snatched it away from her, babbling she didn't know how to read. Mary decided then that the only difference between white and colored people was the ability to read and write.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martins|first=Susan|title=Mary Mcleod Bethune|year=2006|publisher=Wright Group}}</ref> She was inspired to learn.

McLeod attended Mayesville's one-room black schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School, which was run by the [[Presbyterian]] Board of Missions of [[Freedmen]]. She was the only child in her family to attend school, so each day, she taught her family what she had learned. To get to and from school, Mary walked five miles each day. Her teacher Emma Jane Wilson became a significant mentor in her life.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Wilson had attended [[Barber-Scotia College#Scotia Seminary|Scotia Seminary]] (now [[Barber-Scotia College]]). She helped McLeod attend the same school on a scholarship, which she did from 1888–1893. The following year, she attended [[Dwight L. Moody]]'s Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in [[Chicago]] (now the [[Moody Bible Institute]]), hoping to become a [[missionary]] in Africa. Told that black missionaries were not needed, she planned to teach, as education was a prime goal among African Americans.<ref>https://www.moody.edu/alumni/connect/news/2020/bethune/?utm_campaign=AA_April%20Newsletter_2020_EML%201_Alumni&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua</ref>

==Marriage and family==
McLeod married Albertus Bethune in 1898. They moved to [[Savannah, Georgia]], where she did social work up until the Bethunes made the move to Florida. They had a son, named Albert. Coyden Harold Uggams, a visiting Presbyterian minister, persuaded the couple to relocate to [[Palatka, Florida]], to run a mission school.<Ref>"Mary McLeod Bethune", ''Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History''. Gale Group, 1999.</ref> The Bethunes moved in 1899; Mary ran the mission school and began an outreach to prisoners. Albertus left the family in 1907; he never got a divorce but relocated to South Carolina. He died in 1918 from [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Bracey">Smith, Elaine. "Introduction."

==Teaching career==

===Foundations with Lucy Craft Laney===
Bethune worked as a teacher briefly at her former elementary school in Sumter County. In 1896, she began teaching at Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in [[Augusta, Georgia]], which was part of a [[Presbyterian]] mission organized by northern congregations. It was founded and run by [[Lucy Craft Laney]]. As the daughter of former slaves, Laney ran her school with a [[Christians|Christian]] missionary zeal, emphasizing character and practical education for girls. She also accepted the boys who showed up eager to learn. Laney's mission was to imbue Christian moral education in her students to arm them for their life challenges. Of her year at Laney's school, Bethune said,

<blockquote>I was so impressed with her fearlessness, her amazing touch in every respect, an energy that seemed inexhaustible and her mighty power to command respect and admiration from her students and all who knew her. She handled her domain with the art of a master.<ref name="mccluskey1"/></blockquote>

Bethune adopted many of Laney's educational philosophies, including her emphasis on educating girls and women to improve the conditions of black people: "I believe that the greatest hope for the development of my race lies in training our women thoroughly and practically."<ref>Bethune, Mary (April 16, 1920). "Letter to the Editor" in ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> (This is a strategy being followed by organizers in numerous developing countries. Educating women raises the lives of families as a whole.) After one year at Haines, Bethune was transferred by the Presbyterian mission to the Kindell Institute in [[Sumter, South Carolina]], where she had met her current husband.'''

===School in Daytona===
[[File:Daytona School with Bethune.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|Mary McLeod Bethune with girls from the Literary and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls in Daytona, c. 1905.]] After her marriage and move to Florida, Bethune became determined to start a school for girls. Bethune moved from Palatka to Daytona because it had more economic opportunity; it had become a popular tourist destination and businesses were thriving. In October 1904, she rented a small house for $11.00 per month. She made benches and desks from discarded crates and acquired other items through charity. Bethune used $1.50 to start the Educational and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls.<ref>{{cite web

Bethune, parents of students, and church members raised money by making sweet potato pies, ice cream, and fried fish, and selling them to crews at the dump.

In the early days, the students made ink for pens from [[elderberry]] juice, and pencils from burned wood; they asked local businesses for furniture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCluskey|first1=Audrey Thomas|last2=Smith|first2=Elaine M.|title=Mary McLeod Bethune, Building a Better World: Essays and Selected Documents|date=2001|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=025321503X|page=67}}</ref> Bethune wrote later, "I considered cash money as the smallest part of my resources. I had faith in a loving God, faith in myself, and a desire to serve."<ref>Straub, Deborah, ed., "Mary McLeod Bethune," ''Contemporary Heroes and Heroines,'' Book II. Gale Research, 1992.</ref> The school received donations of money, equipment, and labor from local black churches. Within a year, Bethune was teaching more than 30 girls at the school.

Bethune also courted wealthy white organizations, such as the ladies' Palmetto Club. She invited influential white men to sit on her school board of trustees, gaining participation by [[James Gamble (industrialist)|James Gamble]] (of [[Procter & Gamble]]) and [[Thomas H. White]] (of [[White Sewing Machine Company|White Sewing Machines]]). When [[Booker T. Washington]] of [[Tuskegee Institute]] visited in 1912, he advised her of the importance of gaining support by white [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]]s for funding.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Bethune had met with Washington in 1896 and was impressed by his clout with his donors.[[File:Marian Anderson and Mary McLeod Bethune at the launching of the SS Booker T Washington - 29 Sept 1942.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|[[Marian Anderson]] celebrated contralto and Mary McLeod Bethune, Director of Negro Affairs in the National Youth Administration at the launching of the SS Booker T. Washington with unidentified workers who helped construct the first Liberty ship named for an African American at the California Shipbuilding Corporation's yards by [[Alfred T. Palmer]].]]

The rigorous curriculum had the girls rise at 5:30&nbsp;a.m. for Bible study. The classes in home economics and industrial skills such as dressmaking, millinery, cooking, and other crafts emphasized a life of [[self-sufficiency]] for them as women. Students' days ended at 9 pm. Soon Bethune added science and business courses, then high school-level courses of math, English, and foreign languages.<ref name="mccluskey1">McCluskey. Audrey. " 'We Specialize in the Wholly Impossible:' Black Women School Founders," ''Signs'', Winter 1997, pp. 403–426.</ref> <!--Needs expansion; how many students by 1910, say, and 1920, 1930. When exactly were high school classes added? How many teachers?--> Bethune was always seeking donations to keep her school operating; as she traveled, she was fundraising. A donation of $62,000 by [[John D. Rockefeller]] helped, as did her friendship with Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife, beginning in the 1930s, who gave her entree to a progressive network.

In 1931, the [[Methodist Church]] helped the merger of her school with the boys' Cookman Institute, forming the Bethune-Cookman College, a coeducational junior college. Bethune became president. Through the [[Great Depression]], Bethune-Cookman School continued to operate and met the educational standards of the State of Florida. From 1936 to 1942, Bethune had to cut back her time as president because of her duties in [[Washington, DC]]. Funding declined during this period of her absence. But, by 1941 the college had developed a four-year curriculum and achieved full college status.<ref name="Bracey"/> By 1942 Bethune gave up the presidency, as her health was being adversely affected by her many responsibilities. On September 19, 1942, she gave the address at the Los Angeles, California, launching ceremony for the Liberty ship {{SS|Booker T. Washington||2}}, a ceremony in which [[Marian Anderson]] christened the ship.<ref name=NPS>{{cite document |title=Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park, Kaiser Shipyard No. 3 (Historic American Engineering Record CA-326=M) |publisher=National Park Service |page=169|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/ca/ca3300/ca3398/data/ca3398data.pdf |access-date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

== Impact on Daytona Beach Community ==

=== McLeod Hospital ===
As of the early 1900s, Daytona Beach, Florida, was lacking a hospital that would help people of color. Bethune had the idea to start a hospital after an incident involving one of her students. She was called to the bedside of a young female student who fell ill with acute appendicitis. It was clear that the student needed immediate medical attention, yet there was no local hospital to take her to that would treat black people. Bethune demanded that the white physician at the local hospital help the girl. When Bethune went to visit her student, she was asked to enter through the back door. At the hospital, she found that her student had been neglected, ill-cared for and segregated on an outdoor porch.

Out of this experience, Bethune decided that the black community in Daytona needed a hospital. She found a cabin near the school and through sponsors helping her raise money, she purchased it for five thousand dollars. In 1911, Bethune opened the first black hospital in Daytona, Florida. It started with two beds and within a few years, held twenty. Both white and black physicians worked at the hospital, along with Bethune's student nurses. This hospital went on to save many black lives within the twenty years that it operated. During that time, both black and white people in the community relied on the help from the McLeod hospital. After an explosion at a nearby construction site, the hospital took in injured black workers. The hospital and its nurses were also praised for their efforts with a 1918 influenza outbreak. During this outbreak, the hospital was full and had to overflow into the school's auditorium.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune|last=Peare|first=Catherine|publisher=The Vanguard Press, Inc.|year=1951|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune|last=Greenfield|first=Eloise|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|year=1977|isbn=0-690-01129-6|location=New York, NY}}</ref> In 1931, Daytona's public hospital, Halifax, agreed to open a separate hospital for people of color.

Four years after the Daytona School open its doors, the Afro-American Women’s Club, later called the M.E.C. Smith Woman’s Club, was organized as the first Black women’s club in Florida.<ref></ref> According to Wesley (1984), the club officially became the State Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs on October 27, 1927, in Tampa, Florida. The Florida Clubwomen worked:

<blockquote>
# To promote civic movements
# To advocate the cause of welfare units that are organized for moral, religious, social, literary and inter-racial advancement or progress
# To make plans of recreation for young women for their religious, civic, moral, social and industrial uplift
# To encourage the organization of clubs where such organizations do not exist
# To assist local clubs or club women in becoming more thoroughly acquainted with various kinds of community work
# To foster and promote the organization of women’s clubs in all parts of the State of Florida for the general and good betterment of humanity.<ref name=autogenerated1>Wesley, p. </ref></blockquote>

In 1916, Bethune became president of the Florida Federation. During the next two decades under her leadership, the Federation grew to include more than 60 clubs, in at least 20 cities, with at least 13 members in each.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>McCluskey and Smith, p. </ref> Bethune continued to demonstrate her commitment to education. The Federation and Bethune bought and led home for delinquent girls in [[Ocala, Florida]].<ref>Wesley, p. .</ref> The Home for Delinquent Girls "offered an alternative to incarceration with adults for up to twelve young black girls and women".<ref> Hanson, 2003, p. 98.</ref> According to Hanson, Bethune concentrated her energies in four areas: internal organization, American involvement in World War I, women's suffrage, and interracial cooperation.

According to Hanson, Bethune organized the Florida Club to operate in a "businesslike" manner<ref>Hanson, p. 96.</ref> The Club produced a newsletter, drafted a constitution, and held club conventions and was politically active. Bethune was a "field representative for black women on the Women’s Committee of the Council of National Defense" and through this role, the Florida Federation of Women’s Clubs organized a Daytona Beach chapter of the Circle of Negro War Relief (CNWR).<ref name="hanson97">Hanson, p. 97.</ref> The CNWR "promoted black women’s participation in the war effort"<ref name="hanson97"/> and was designed to meet the needs of Black veterans. Bethune, along with CNWR and the Florida Club, encouraged the entire Black community to get involved. They conducted voluntary food conservation drives, taught community members how to can and preserve food, and conducted fundraising efforts through food sales.<ref name=autogenerated2>Hanson, p. .</ref> The CNWR also established home demonstration and public health programs, improved recreational facilities and playgrounds for children, and founded the Mutual Protection League for Working Girls.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Bethune and the Florida Club women also "established Hostess Houses, became Traveler’s Aid workers ... and worked with Red Cross chapters to promote the inclusion of black nurses whenever possible".<ref name="hanson97"/> The women created care packages for the black men serving in the war. They "knitted goods for soldiers, supplied comfort kits, gum, records, phonographs, and home-cooked dinners, and gave lectures on social hygiene and race pride".<ref name="hanson97"/> Bethune supported the women's suffrage movement in 1920 by organizing a voter’s registration drive to be held at her school.  --->

===National Association of Colored Women===
In 1896, the [[National Association of Colored Women]] (NACW) was formed to promote the needs of black women. Bethune served as the Florida chapter president of the NACW from 1917 to 1925. She worked to register black voters, which was resisted by white society and had been made almost impossible by a variety of obstacles in Florida law and practices controlled by white administrators. She was threatened by members of the resurgent [[Ku Klux Klan]] in those years.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref name=" Bracey"/> Bethune also served as the president of the Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs from 1920 to 1925, which worked to improve opportunities for black women.

She was elected as national president of the NACW in 1924. While the organization struggled to raise funds for regular operations, Bethune envisioned it acquiring a headquarters and hiring a professional executive secretary; she implemented this when NACW bought a property at 1318 Vermont Avenue in Washington, DC. She led it to be the first black-controlled organization with headquarters in the capital.

Gaining a national reputation, in 1928 Bethune was invited to attend the Child Welfare Conference called by Republican President [[Calvin Coolidge]]. In 1930 President [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed her to the White House Conference on Child Health.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cookman.edu/about_bcu/history/our_founder.html|title=Our Founder – Dr. Bethune|website=www.cookman.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14}}</ref>

===Southeastern Association of Colored Women's Clubs===
The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women's Clubs) elected Bethune as president after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World Essays and Selected Documents|last=McCluskey and Smith|first=Audrey Thomas and Elaine M.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|pages=5–6}}</ref> They intended to reach out to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled ''Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation;'' it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights.<ref>122 June 30, 1921. ''The Southeastern Herald'', Florida Number, February 1924, pp. 10—11. ''Mary McLeod Bethune Papers'', Mary McLeod Bethune Foundation, Bethune-Cookman College, Daytona Beach, Fla.</ref> The group went on to help register black women to vote after they were granted suffrage a few months later after passage of the constitutional amendment.<ref>Gilmore, Glenda Elizabeth.

Facts On File, Inc.</ref> Within the state, however, and in other southern states, black men and women were largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy and comprehension tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and the need to keep and display records.

===National Council of Negro Women===
In 1935 Bethune founded the [[National Council of Negro Women]] (NCNW) in [[New York City]], bringing together representatives of 28 different organizations to work to improve the lives of black women and their communities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World Essays and Selected Documents|last=McCluskey and Smith|first=Audrey Thomas and Elaine M.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|pages=xii}}</ref> Bethune said of the council:

<blockquote>It is our pledge to make a lasting contribution to all that is finest and best in America, to cherish and enrich her heritage of freedom and progress by working for the [[Racial integration|integration]] of all her people regardless of race, creed, or national origin, into her spiritual, social, cultural, civic, and economic life, and thus aid her to achieve the glorious destiny of a true and unfettered [[democracy]].<ref name="new">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncnw.org/about/bethune.htm |title=Mary McLeod Bethune |work=NCNW website |access-date=January 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124140528/http://www.ncnw.org/about/bethune.htm |archive-date=January 24, 2008 }}</ref></blockquote>

In 1938, the NCNW hosted the White House Conference on Negro Women and Children, demonstrating the importance of black women in democratic roles. During World War II, the NCNW gained approval for black women to be commissioned as officers in the [[Women's Army Corps]]. Bethune also served as a political appointee and the Special Assistant to the [[Secretary of War]] during the war.<ref name="Bracey"/>

In the 1990s, the headquarters for the National Council for Negro Women moved to Pennsylvania Avenue, centrally located between the White House and the U.S. Capitol. The former headquarters, where Bethune also lived at one time, has been designated as a [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Site]].

===National Youth Administration===

The [[National Youth Administration]] (NYA) was a federal agency created under Roosevelt's [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). It provided programs specifically to promote relief and employment for young people. It focused on unemployed citizens aged sixteen to twenty-five years who were not in school.<ref name=linsin>Linsin, Christopher E. "Something More than a Creed: Mary McLeod Bethune's Aim of Integrated Autonomy as Director of Negro Affairs," ''The Florida Historical Quarterly'' 76, no. 1 (1997): 20–41. https://www.jstor.org/stable/30148938 (accessed January 27, 2010).</ref> Bethune lobbied the organization so aggressively and effectively for minority involvement that she earned a full-time staff position in 1936 as an assistant.

Within two years, Bethune was appointed to a position of Director of the Division of Negro Affairs,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mary McLeod Bethune: Building a Better World Essays and Selected Documents|last=McCluskey and Smith|first=Audrey Thomas and Elaine M.|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2001|pages=xii}}</ref> and as such, became the first African-American female division head.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=B.

She was the only black agent of the NYA who was a financial manager. She ensured black colleges participating in the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]], which graduated some of the first black pilots.<ref name=" Bracey"/> The director of the NYA said in 1939: "No one can do what Mrs. Bethune can do."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Elaine M.|date=January 1996|title=Mary McLeod Bethune's "Last Will and Testament": A Legacy for Race Vindication|journal=The Journal of Negro History|language=en|volume=81|issue=1–4|pages=105–122|doi=10.1086/jnhv81n1-4p105|s2cid=141283003|issn=0022-2992}}</ref>

Bethune's determination helped national officials recognize the need to improve employment for black youth. The NYA's final report, issued in 1943 stated,

<blockquote>more than 300,000 black young men and women were given employment and work training on NYA projects. These projects opened to these youth, training opportunities and enabled the majority of them to qualify for jobs heretofore closed to them.<ref name=linsin/></blockquote>

Within the administration, Bethune advocated for the appointment of black NYA officials to positions of political power. Bethune's administrative assistants served as liaisons between the National Division of Negro Affairs and the NYA agencies on the state and local levels. The high number of administrative assistants composed a workforce commanded by Bethune. They helped gain a better job and salary opportunities for blacks across the country.<ref name="ross">Ross, Joyce B. "Mary Bethune and the National Youth Administration: A Case Study of Power Relationships in the Black Cabinet of Franklin D. Roosevelt," ''The Journal of Negro History'' 60, no. 1 (1975): 1–28. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716791 (accessed January 28, 2010).</ref> During her tenure, Bethune also pushed federal officials to approve a program of consumer education for blacks, and a foundation for black crippled children. She planned for studies for black workers' education councils. National officials did not support these due to inadequate funding and fear of duplicating the work of private non-governmental agencies.<ref name=ross/> The NYA was terminated in 1943.

===Black Cabinet===
[[File:(Mary McLeod Bethune), "Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt and others at the opening of Midway Hall, one of two residence halls buil - NARA - 533032.jpg|thumb|Mary McLeod Bethune (left) and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] (center), 1943]]
Bethune became a close and loyal friend of [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Eleanor]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]]. At the Southern Conference on Human Welfare in 1938, held in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Eleanor Roosevelt requested a seat next to Bethune despite state segregation laws. Roosevelt frequently referred to Bethune as "her closest friend in her age group."<ref>Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site (on [[National Park Service]] website) {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/teach-er-vk/lesson-plans/notes-er-and-civil-rights.htm|title=Eleanor Roosevelt and Civil Rights}} Retrieved on January 11, 2008.</ref> Bethune told black voters about the work being done on their behalf by the Roosevelt Administration and made their concerns known to the Roosevelts. She had unprecedented access to the [[White House]] through her relationship with the First Lady.<ref name="Bracey"/>

She used her access to form a coalition of leaders from black organizations called the [[Federal Council of Negro Affairs]], but which came to be known as the Black Cabinet. It served as an advisory board to the Roosevelt administration on issues facing black people in America. It was composed of numerous talented blacks, mostly men, who had been appointed to positions in federal agencies. This was the first collective of black people working in higher positions in government. It suggested to voters that the Roosevelt administration cared about black concerns. The group gathered in Bethune's office or apartment and met informally, rarely keeping minutes. Although as advisers they did not directly create public policy, they were a respected leadership among black voters; they influenced political appointments and disbursement of funds to organizations that would benefit black people.<ref>Weiss, Nancy. (1983) ''Farewell to the Party of Lincoln; Black Politics in the Age of FDR''. Princeton University Press {{ISBN|0-691-04703-0}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2015}}

===Civil rights===
In 1931 the Methodist Church supported merging of the Daytona Normal and Industrial School and the Cookman College for Men into Bethune-Cookman College, established first as a [[junior college]]. Bethune became a member of the church but it was segregated in the South. Essentially two organizations operated in the Methodist denomination. Bethune was prominent in the primarily black Florida Conference. While she worked to integrate the mostly white [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], she protested its initial plans for integration because they proposed separate jurisdictions based on race.<!--Explain - separate parishes?  --><ref>"Mary McLeod Bethune," ''Religious Leaders of America'', 2nd ed. Gale Group, 1999.</ref>

Bethune worked to educate both whites and blacks about the accomplishments and needs of black people, writing in 1938,

<blockquote>If our people are to fight their way up out of bondage we must arm them with the sword and the shield and buckler of pride – belief in themselves and their possibilities, based upon a sure knowledge of the achievements of the past.<ref name="bethuneJNH1938">Bethune, Mary (January 1938). "Clarifying our Vision With the Facts," ''Journal of Negro History''; 23 (1) pp. 10–15.</ref></blockquote>

A year later she wrote,

<blockquote>Not only the Negro child but children of all races should read and know of the achievements, accomplishments, and deeds of the Negro. World peace and brotherhood are based on a common understanding of the contributions and cultures of all races and creeds.<ref name="bethuneJNh1939">Bethune, Mary (January 1939). "The Adaptation of the History of the Negro to the Capacity of the Child," ''Journal of Negro History,'' 24 (1) pp. 9–13.</ref></blockquote>

On Sundays, she opened her school to tourists in Daytona Beach, showing off her students' accomplishments, hosting national speakers on black issues, and taking donations. She ensured that these Community Meetings were integrated. A black teenager in Daytona at the time later recalled: "Many tourists attended, sitting wherever there were empty seats. There was no special section for white people."<ref name="smith">Smith, Elaine (Winter, 1996). "Mary McLeod Bethune's 'Last Will and Testament': A Legacy for Race Vindication", ''Journal of Negro History'', '''8''' (1/4), pp. 105–122</ref>

When the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional, Bethune defended the decision by writing in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' that year:

<blockquote>There can be no divided democracy, no class government, no half-free county, under the constitution. Therefore, there can be no discrimination, no segregation, no separation of some citizens from the rights which belong to all. ... We are on our way. But these are frontiers which we must conquer. ... We must gain full equality in education ... in the franchise ... in economic opportunity, and full equality in the abundance of life.<ref name="People's World">{{cite web|last1=Bethune|first1=Mary McLeod|title=Today in labor history: Mary McLeod Bethune born|url=http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/today-in-labor-history-mary-mcleod-bethune-born/|website=People's World|publisher=Long View Publishing Co.|access-date=1 February 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Bethune organized the first [[officer candidate school]]s for black women. She lobbied federal officials, including Roosevelt, on behalf of African-American women who wanted to join the military.

=== United Negro College Fund ===
She co-founded the [[UNCF|United Negro College Fund]] (UNCF) on April 25, 1944, with [[William J. Trent]] and [[Frederick D. Patterson]]. The UNCF is a program which gives many different scholarships, mentorships, and job opportunities to African American and minority students attending any of the 37 historically black colleges and universities. Trent had joined Patterson and Bethune in raising money for UNCF. The organization started in 1944 and by 1964, Trent had raised over 50 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/72-years-later-united-negro-college-fund-continues-close-college-funding-gap-minorities|title=72 years later: United Negro College Fund continues to close college funding gap for minorities|last=Moffitt|first=Kelly|website=news.stlpublicradio.org|publisher=St. Louis Public Radio|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/blogs/article_1fa8d694-e92f-11e4-bd92-03ade7697779.html|title=African-American Facts for Week of: April 19, 2015|last=Johnson|first=Annette|website=Indianapolis Recorder Newspaper|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/beyonce-balmain-collaboration-coachella-outfits-charity-united-negro-college-fund-a8443536.html|title=BEYONCE ANNOUNCES BALMAIN COLLABORATION WHERE ALL PROCEEDS WILL GO TO CHARITY|date=2018-07-12|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>

==Death and accolades==
On May 18, 1955, Bethune died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Her death was followed by editorial tributes in African-American newspapers across the United States. The [[Oklahoma City]] ''Black Dispatch'' stated she was, "Exhibit No. 1 for all who have faith in America and the democratic process." The ''Atlanta Daily World'' said her life was, "One of the most dramatic careers ever enacted at any time upon the stage of human activity." And the ''Pittsburgh Courier'' wrote, "In any race or nation she would have been an outstanding personality and made a noteworthy contribution because her chief attribute was her indomitable soul."

The mainstream press praised her as well. ''[[Christian Century]]'' suggested, "the story of her life should be taught to every school child for generations to come." The ''[[New York Times]]'' noted she was, "one of the most potent factors in the growth of interracial goodwill in America." The ''[[Washington Post]]'' said: "So great were her dynamism and force that it was almost impossible to resist her ... Not only her own people, but all America has been enriched and ennobled by her courageous, ebullient spirit." Her hometown newspaper, the ''Daytona Beach Evening News'' printed, "To some, she seemed unreal, something that could not be. ... What right had she to greatness? ... The lesson of Mrs. Bethune's life is that genius knows no racial barriers."<ref name="Bracey"/>

==Personal life==
[[File:Mary McLeod Bethune - NARA - 559194.tif|thumb|upright|Painting of Bethune by [[Betsy Graves Reyneau]]]]

Bethune was described as "[[ebony]]" in complexion. She carried a cane, not for support but for effect. She said it gave her "swank". She was a [[teetotaler]] and preached [[Temperance movement|temperance]] for African Americans, taking opportunities to chastise drunken blacks she encountered in public.<ref name=" Bracey"/> Bethune said more than once that the school and the students in Daytona were her first family, and that her son and extended family came second. Her students often referred to her as "Mama Bethune".

She was noted for achieving her goals. Dr. [[Robert C. Weaver|Robert Weaver]], who also served in Roosevelt's Black Cabinet, said of her, "She had the most marvelous gift of effecting feminine helplessness in order to attain her aims with masculine ruthlessness."<ref>Weaver, Robert (July 10, 1974). "Her Boys Remember," ''Time.'' (special publication of the National Council of Negro Women).</ref> When a white Daytona resident threatened Bethune's students with a rifle, Bethune worked to make an ally of him. The director of the McLeod Hospital recalled, "Mrs. Bethune treated him with courtesy and developed such goodwill in him that we found him protecting the children and going so far as to say, 'If anybody bothers old Mary, I will protect her with my life.'"<ref>Adams, Texas, "As I Recollect," typescript, BF.</ref>

Self-sufficiency was a high priority throughout her life. Bethune invested in several businesses, including the ''[[Pittsburgh Courier]]'', a black newspaper, and many life insurance companies. She founded Central Life Insurance of Florida. She eventually retired in Florida. Due to state segregation, blacks were not allowed to visit the beach. Bethune and several other business owners invested in Paradise Beach: they purchased a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of beach and the surrounding properties, selling these to black families. They did allow white families to visit the waterfront. Paradise Beach was later renamed as Bethune-Volusia Beach in her honor. She also was a one-fourth owner of the Welricha Motel in Daytona.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://web.naplesnews.com/03/10/florida/e19482a.htm |author=Matt Grimson |title=Historically black beach disappears with integration |work=Naples Daily News |date=October 13, 2003 |access-date=January 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030440/http://web.naplesnews.com/03/10/florida/e19482a.htm |archive-date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref>
