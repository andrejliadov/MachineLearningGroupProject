== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Little is known about Boomgaard's life: he was born in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], Netherlands. His parents were Adriaan Jacobs Boomgaard (1763–1844) and Geesje Geerts Bontekoe (1762–1834).<ref name="delpher">{{cite web|url=https://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:011010387|title=NOORDER RONDBLIK Geert A.

=== Marriages ===
At the age of 29, on 4 March 1818, he married Stijntje Bus (baptized 19 February 1797 – died 24 March 1830).<ref name="delpher"/><ref name="wiewaswie1"/> Stijntje died aged 33, a month after the birth of their 8th child. A year later, on 17 March 1831, Boomgaard married Grietje Abels Jonker (baptized 19 May 1793 – 18 May 1864),<ref name="delpher"/> with whom he had four more children, for a total of 12.

He survived all his children: his last surviving child, Jansje Hinderika, died at the age of 57 in May 1885.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Longevity ===
{{Unreferenced|section|date=June 2020}}
[[File:GeertAdriaansBoomgaard.jpg|thumb|upright|Boomgaard in the 1890s]]
On 8 January 1897, Boomgaard surpassed the final age of Belgian Pierre Darcourt (108 years and 108 days) to become the oldest man ever, and by 10 April 1898, he was older than Swedish woman Kirsti Skagen, therefore making him the oldest ever verified person at that time.

He died at the age of 110 years and 135 days. The first female supercentenarian was [[Margaret Ann Neve]]—who surpassed Adriaans final age—although his lifespan as the longest ever lived male was not surpassed until 29 October 1966, by John Mosely Turner.{{-}}
