[[File:Edward Savage - The Washington Family - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[The Washington Family]] (1789–1796) by [[Edward Savage (artist)|Edward Savage]]]]
The '''Washington family''' is an American family of English origins. It was prominent in [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial America]] and rose to great [[Economy|economic]] and [[Politics|political]] eminence especially in the [[Colony of Virginia]], owning several highly valued [[Plantations of New England|Plantations]], mostly making their money in [[Cultivation of tobacco|tobacco farming]]. Members of the family include the first [[president of the United States]], [[George Washington]] (1732–1799), and his nephew, [[Bushrod Washington]] (1762–1829), who served as [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] 

The family traces its descent from [[John Washington]], born, 1631 in [[Tring]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]], who arrived in the Colony of Virginia in 1657 after being shipwrecked.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> President Washington's immediate ancestry entirely traces back to England, save for at least two lines. A paternal great-great-great-grandfather, [[Nicolas Martiau]], was a [[Huguenot]] from [[Île de Ré]], [[France]] and naturalized [[English people|Englishman]], who arrived in Virginia aboard the ''Francis Bonaventure'' in 1620.<ref>{{cite book|title=Lewis of Warner Hall: The History of a Family, Including the Genealogy of Descendants in Both the Male and Female Lines, Biographical Sketches of Its Members, and Their Descent from Other Early Virginia Families|editor=Merrow Egerton Sorley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yeWgvfDpwbwC&q=Huguenot+Nicholas+Martiau&pg=PA31|year=1935|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Co.|isbn=978-0-8063-0831-9|page=31|accessdate=June 6, 2020}}</ref>

The ancestral home is [[Washington Old Hall]], located in the town of [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]] in the [[North East England]].

== Roots in England ==
The Washington family traces its roots to Sir William de Hertburn who was a descendant of the [[House of Dunkeld]], through his mother [[Margaret of Huntingdon, Duchess of Brittany|Margaret of Huntingdon]]. During the [[Norman conquest of England]] by [[William the Conqueror]], William de Hertburn was granted the lordship of [[Washington Old Hall|Wessyington]] in [[North East England|northeast England]] and adopted the name of the estate "de Wessyington" later becoming the surname "Washington". For the next 500 years or so the Washington family would continue to be distinguished members of the [[County Durham]] [[landed gentry]]. However they were never made members of the [[Peerage of England|English Peerage]].
