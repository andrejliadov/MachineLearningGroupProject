The '''aristocracy'''<ref>https://www.dictionary.com/browse/aristocracy, Definition of Aristocracy</ref> is a [[social class]] that a particular society considers its highest order. In many states, the aristocracy included the [[upper class]] of people (''aristocrats'') with hereditary rank and titles.<ref>https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aristocracy, Definition(2) of Aristocracy</ref> In some, such as ancient Greece, Rome, and India, aristocratic status came from belonging to a military [[caste]]. It has also been common, notably in African societies, for aristocrats to belong to priestly dynasties. Aristocratic status can involve feudal or legal privileges.<ref>''The aristocrats: a portrait of Britain's nobility and their way of life today'', by Roy Perrott, (London 1968), page5-10</ref> They are usually below only the monarch of a [[country]] or [[nation]] in its [[social hierarchy]].<ref>https://www.lairdofblackwood.com/british-aristocracy/, Native Wood Preservation Ltd, on British Aristocracy and Hierarchy</ref> In modern European societies, the aristocracy has often coincided with the [[nobility]], a specific class that arose in the [[Middle Ages]], but the term "aristocracy" is sometimes also applied to other [[elite]]s, and is used as a more generic term when describing earlier and non-European societies.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/aristocracy, Modern European societies and the nobility of aristocracy</ref>

==Etymology==
The term ''[[aristocracy]]'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀριστοκρατία}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|aristokratia}} from {{lang|grc|ἄριστος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|aristos}}) 'excellent' and {{lang|grc|κράτος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|kratos}}) 'power').<ref>''The Oxford Companion to British History'', John Cannon (Editor), [[Oxford University Press]], 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-19-866176-4}}</ref> In most cases, aristocratic titles were and are hereditary.

The term {{lang|grc-Latn|aristokratia}} was first used in [[Athens]] with reference to young [[citizen]]s (the men of the ruling class) who led armies at the front line. {{lang|grc-Latn|Aristokratia}} roughly translates to "rule of the best born".  Due to [[martial]] bravery being highly regarded as a [[virtue]] in [[ancient Greece]], it was assumed that the armies were being led by "the best". This virtue was called {{lang|grc-Latn|[[arete]]}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|ἀρετή}}). Etymologically, as the word developed, it also produced a more political term: '{{lang|grc-Latn|[[aristoi]]}} ({{lang|grc|ἄριστοι}}). The term aristocracy is a compound word stemming from the singular of {{lang|grc-Latn|aristoi}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|aristos}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|ἄριστος}}), and the Greek word for power, {{lang|grc-Latn|kratos}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|κράτος}}).

From the ancient Greeks, the term passed to the European [[Middle Ages]] for a similar ''hereditary class'' of military leaders, often referred to as [[nobility#European nobility|the nobility]]. As in Greece, this was a class of privileged men and women whose familial connections to the regional armies allowed them to present themselves as the most "noble" or "best" of society.
