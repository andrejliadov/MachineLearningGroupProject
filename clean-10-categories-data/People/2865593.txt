'''William Ackerman''' (born November 16, 1949) is an American guitarist and record producer who founded [[Windham Hill Records]].<ref name="Ruhlmann">{{cite web |last1=Ruhlmann |first1=William |title=Will Ackerman |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/will-ackerman-mn0001431398/biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=3 June 2018}}</ref>

== Career ==
===Early years===
Ackerman was born in Palo Alto, California. His adoptive father was a professor of English at Stanford University.<ref>Tom Casciato. "Stanford Carpenter Runs Record Label."''The Stanford (CA) Daily'', November 15, 1977, p. 4.</ref> He grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and attended [[Northfield Mount Hermon School]] in western Massachusetts. His roommate instructed him in the open guitar tuning that became the basis for his compositions. He returned to Palo Alto to study English and History at [[Stanford University]].

His life took a turn when he discovered he had a fondness for carpentry. He was five credits short of graduating when he left Stanford to work as an apprentice to a Norwegian boat builder. In 1972, he founded Windham Hill Builders in Palo Alto while playing music for Stanford theater productions and performing impromptu concerts in town.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Producing Music for the Heart|date=1984-05-02|work=Baton Rouge (LA) Advocate|page=8B}}</ref>

===Windham Hill Records===
With money borrowed from friends, he recorded his first album, ''The Search of Turtle's Navel'', later changed to ''[[In Search of the Turtle's Navel]]'', on his own label, [[Windham Hill Records]]. The second album he released in 1976 was by his cousin, guitarist  [[Alex De Grassi]], followed by one in 1977 by his guitar teacher, [[Robbie Basho]]. He left carpentry to pursue music full time in 1980. During that year, the label received national attention because of [[George Winston]]'s first album. ''[[Autumn (George Winston album)|Autumn]]'' was a solo piano album that helped define the genre of relaxing, acoustic music that Ackerman had been creating at Windham Hill. He discovered guitarist [[Michael Hedges]] at a concert in Palo Alto and immediately signed him to the label. Other musicians in the catalog were [[Darol Anger]], [[Mike Marshall (musician)|Mike Marshall]], [[Liz Story]], and the band [[Shadowfax (band)|Shadowfax]]. In time the genre associated with Windham Hill was called [[New-age music]].<ref name="Berkowitz">{{cite web |last1=Berkowitz |first1=Kenny |title=In the Age of Disco, Windham Hill Founder Will Ackerman Helped Solo-Acoustic Guitar Thrive |url=http://acousticguitar.com/in-the-age-of-disco-windham-hill-founder-will-ackerman-helped-solo-acoustic-guitar-thrive-the-label-is-marking-its-40th-anniversary/ |website=Acoustic Guitar |accessdate=3 June 2018 |date=11 October 2016}}</ref>

In 1982, [[A&M Records]] became Windham Hill's distributor. The label was selling millions of albums, and Ackerman became a wealthy man. Despite outward signs of success, he was diagnosed with depression. By 1984, Ackerman no longer wanted to run a large corporation. He left California for Vermont. He built Imaginary Road Studios in [[Dummerston, Vermont]] and continued to work as a producer.<ref name="Berkowitz" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/in-the-studio-with-windham-hill-founder-will-ackerman/Content?oid=2344440|title=In the Studio With Windham Hill Founder Will Ackerman|last=Bolles|first=Dan|website=Seven Days|language=en|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref>
