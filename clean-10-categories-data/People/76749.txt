{{short description|fictional person in a narrative work}}
In [[fiction]], a '''character''' (sometimes known as a '''fictional character''') is a [[person]] or other being in a [[narrative]] (such as a [[novel]], [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[television series]], [[film]], or [[video game]]).<ref name="Freeman">{{cite book|author=Matthew Freeman|title=Historicising Transmedia Storytelling: Early Twentieth-Century Transmedia Story Worlds|isbn =978-1315439501|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2016|pages=31–34|accessdate=January 19, 2017 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDBuDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT31}}</ref><ref name="DiBattista">{{cite book|author=Maria DiBattista|title=Novel Characters: A Genealogy|isbn =978-1444351552|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=2011|pages=14–20|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uATBJUxMqEC&pg=PT14}}</ref><ref>Baldick (2001, 37) and Childs and Fowler (2006, 23).

==Creation==
In [[fiction writing]], authors create dynamic characters using various methods. Sometimes characters are conjured up from imagination; in other instances, they are created by amplifying the character trait of a real person into a new fictional creation.<ref name="Freeman"/><ref name="DiBattista"/> 

=== Real people, in part or in full ===
[[File:Patrick Grant's Jungian View of LOTR.svg|thumb|272x272px|Literary scholar Patrick Grant matches characters from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' with Jungian archetypes.<ref name="Grant 1973">{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Patrick|date=1973|title=Tolkien: Archetype and Word|url=https://crosscurrents.org/tolkien.htm#_ednref9|journal=Cross Currents|issue=Winter 1973|pages=365–380}}</ref>]] An author or creator basing a character on a real person can use a person they know, a historical figure, a current figure who they have not met, or on themselves, with the latter being either an author-surrogate or an example of [[self-insertion]]. The use of a famous person easily identifiable with certain character traits as the base for a principal character is a feature of [[Allegory|allegorical]] works, such as ''[[Animal Farm]]'', which portrays Soviet revolutionaries as pigs. Other authors, especially for [[historical fiction]], make use of real people and create fictional stories revolving around their lives, as with ''[[The Paris Wife]]'' which revolves around [[Ernest Hemingway]].

=== Archetypes and stock characters ===
An author can create a character using the basic character [[archetype]]s which are common to many cultural traditions: the [[father figure]], [[mother figure]], [[hero]], and so on. Some writers make use of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] as presented by [[Carl Jung]] as the basis for character traits.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Hauke|first1=Christopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qbt3Kjd3nMYC|title=Jung and Film|last2=Alister|first2=Ian|date=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-58391-132-7|language=en}}</ref> Generally, when an archetype from some system (such as Jung's) is used, elements of the story also follow the system's expectations in terms of [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]].

An author can also create a fictional character using generic [[stock character]]s, which are generally flat. They tend to be used for supporting or minor characters. However, some significant authors have used stock characters as the starting point for building richly detailed characters, such as [[Shakespeare]]'s use of the boastful soldier character as the basis for [[Falstaff]].

==Types==

===Round vs. flat=== <!-- Characterization links here. -->
In his book ''Aspects of the Novel'', [[E. M. Forster]] defined two basic types of characters, their qualities, functions, and importance for the development of the novel: '''flat''' characters and '''round''' characters.<ref name="Hoffman">{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Michael J|author2=Patrick D. Murphy|title=Essentials of the theory of fiction|publisher=Duke University Press, 1996|edition=2|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8223-1823-1|year=1996}}</ref> Flat characters are two-dimensional, in that they are relatively uncomplicated. By contrast, round characters are complex figures with many different characteristics, that undergo development, sometimes sufficiently to surprise the reader.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forster|first=E.M.|title=Aspects of the Novel|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.509170|year=1927}}</ref> 

In psychological terms, round or complex characters may be considered to have five personality dimensions under the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] model of personality. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Pelican|first=Kira-Anne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnabzQEACAAJ|title=The Science of Writing Characters: Using Psychology to Create Compelling Fictional Characters|date=2020|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-5013-5722-0|language=en}}</ref>

[[Stock character]]s are usually one-dimensional and thin. [[Mary Sue]]s are characters that usually appear in [[fan fiction]], virtually devoid of flaws,<ref name="Bennett">{{cite book|authors=Lucy Bennett, Paul Booth|title=Seeing Fans: Representations of Fandom in Media and Popular Culture|isbn =978-1501318474|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA|year=2016|page=160|accessdate=January 19, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ydwuDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA160}}</ref> and are therefore considered flat characters.

Another type of flat character is a "walk-on," a term used by Seymour Chatman for characters that are not fully delineated and individualized; rather they are part of the background or the setting of the narrative.<ref>Seymour Chatman, ''Story and Discourse: Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1978), 139.</ref>

===Dynamic vs. static===
'''Dynamic''' characters are those that change over the course of the story, while '''static''' characters remain the same throughout. An example of a popular dynamic character in literature is [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], the protagonist of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. At the start of the story, he is a bitter miser, but by the end of the tale, he transforms into a kind-hearted, generous man.

===Regular, recurring and guest characters===
In television, a regular, main or ongoing character is a character who appears in all or a majority of episodes, or in a significant chain of episodes of the series.<ref>The TV Writer's Workbook: A Creative Approach To Television Scripts [https://books.google.com/books?id=0YeCet_B_-IC&pg=PA40 p. 40]</ref> Regular characters may be both core and secondary ones.

A [[recurring character]] or supporting character often and frequently appears from time to time during the series' run.<ref name="Crafty">{{cite book |last=Epstein |first=Alex |title=Crafty TV Writing: Thinking Inside the Box |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |year=2006 |isbn=0-8050-8028-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/craftytvwritingt00epst/page/27 27–28] |url=https://archive.org/details/craftytvwritingt00epst/page/27 }}</ref> Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus.

A guest or minor character is one who acts only in a few episodes or scenes. Unlike regular characters, the guest ones do not need to be carefully incorporated into the storyline with all its ramifications: they create a piece of drama and then disappear without consequences to the narrative structure, unlike core characters, for which any significant conflict must be traced during a considerable time, which is often seen as an unjustified waste of resources.<ref>Greg M. Smith, ''Beautiful TV: The Art and Argument of Ally McBeal'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&pg=PA147 p. 147]</ref> There may also be a continuing or recurring guest character.<ref>Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=joaM7TvhSzUC&pg=PA151 p. 151]</ref> Sometimes a guest or minor character may gain unanticipated popularity and turn into a regular or main one;<ref>David Kukoff, ''Vault Guide to Television Writing Careers'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=T9zj0AqB6bUC&pg=PA62 p. 62]</ref> this is known as a [[list of breakout characters|breakout character]].<ref name=ESL>{{cite web|url=http://eslnotes.com./movies/html/man-on-the-moon.html|work=English Learner Movie Guides|title=Man on the Moon|year=2000|first=Raymond|last=Weschler}}</ref><ref name="This definition">{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Ron|title=They really were a great bunch of happy people|url=http://www.thecolumnists.com/miller/miller426.html|publisher=TheColumnists.com|year=2005|accessdate=July 11, 2009|quote=Originally, the Arthur "Fonzie" Fonzarelli character was to be a comic relief dropout type, put there for comic contrast to the whitebread Richie and his pals.

Ultimately, Winkler molded the character around himself and everybody, including Ron Howard, realized this would be the show's "breakout" character.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716055123/http://www.thecolumnists.com/miller/miller426.html|archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref>

==Classical analysis==
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

In the earliest surviving work of [[dramatic theory]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE), the [[Greek philosophy|Classical Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] deduces that character (''[[ethos]]'') is one of six qualitative parts of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] and one of the three objects that it [[Mimesis|represents]] (1450a12).<ref>Janko (1987, 8). Aristotle defines the six qualitative elements of tragedy as "plot, character, diction, reasoning, spectacle and song" (1450a10); the three objects are plot (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]''), character (''[[ethos]]''), and reasoning (''[[dianoia]]'').</ref> He understands character not to denote a fictional person, but the quality of the person acting in the story and reacting to its situations (1450a5).<ref name=j984>Janko (1987, 9, 84).</ref> He defines character as "that which reveals [[Decision making|decision]], of whatever sort" (1450b8).<ref name=j984/> It is possible, therefore, to have stories that do not contain "characters" in Aristotle's sense of the word, since character necessarily involves making the [[Ethics|ethical]] dispositions of those performing the action clear.<ref>Aristotle writes: "Again, without action, a tragedy cannot exist, but without characters, it may. For the tragedies of most recent [poets] lack character, and in general, there are many such poets" (1450a24-25); see Janko (1987, 9, 86).</ref> If, in speeches, the speaker "decides or avoids nothing at all", then those speeches "do not have character" (1450b9—11).<ref>Janko (1987, 9).</ref> Aristotle argues for the primacy of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] (''[[Mythos (Aristotle)|mythos]]'') over character (''[[ethos]]'').<ref>Aston and Savona (1991, 34) and Janko (1987, 8).</ref> He writes:
{{quote|But the most important of these is the structure of the incidents. For (i) tragedy is a representation not of human beings but of action and life. Happiness and unhappiness lie in action, and the end [of life] is a sort of action, not a quality; people are of a certain sort according to their characters, but happy or the opposite according to their actions. So [the actors] do not act in order to represent the characters, but they include the characters for the sake of their actions" (1450a15-23).<ref>Janko (1987, 8).</ref>}}
Aristotle suggests that works were distinguished in the first instance according to the nature of the person who created them: "the grander people represented fine actions, i.e. those of fine persons" by producing "hymns and praise-poems", while "ordinary people represented those of inferior ones" by "composing invectives" (1448b20—1449a5).<ref>Janko (1987, 5). This distinction, Aristotle argues, arises from two causes that are natural and common to all humans—the delight taken in experiencing representations and the way in which we learn through imitation (1448b4—19); see Janko (1987, 4—5).</ref> On this basis, a distinction between the individuals represented in tragedy and in comedy arose: tragedy, along with [[epic poetry]], is "a representation of serious people" (1449b9—10), while [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] is "a representation of people who are rather inferior" (1449a32—33).<ref>Janko (1987, 6—7). Aristotle specifies that comedy does not represent all kinds of ugliness and vice, but only that which is laughable (1449a32—1449a37).</ref>

In the ''[[Tractatus coislinianus]]'' (which may or may not be by Aristotle), [[Ancient Greek comedy]] is defined as involving three types of characters: the [[buffoon]] (''[[bômolochus]]''), the [[Irony|ironist]] (''[[eirôn]]''), and the [[imposter]] or boaster (''[[alazôn]]'').<ref>Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).</ref> All three are central to [[Aristophanes]]' "[[old comedy]]".<ref>Janko (1987, 170).</ref>

By the time the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] comic playwright [[Plautus]] wrote his plays two centuries later, the use of characters to define dramatic [[genre]]s was well established.<ref>Carlson (1993, 22).</ref> His ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]'' begins with a [[prologue]] in which [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] claims that since the play contains kings and gods, it cannot be a comedy and must be a [[tragicomedy]].<ref>''Amphritruo'', line 59.</ref>
