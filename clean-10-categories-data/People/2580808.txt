An '''agent-general''' is the representative in the [[United Kingdom]] of the government of a [[Canadian provinces|Canadian province]] or an [[States and territories of Australia|Australian state]] and, historically, also of a [[British colony]] in [[Jamaica]], [[Nigeria]], [[Canada]], [[Malta]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]] or [[New Zealand]] and subsequently, of a [[States of Nigeria|Nigerian region]]. Australia and Canada's federal governments are represented by [[high commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissions]], as are all [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] national governments today.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, a growing number of British colonies appointed agents in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] (and occasionally elsewhere in Europe) to promote immigration to the colonies. Eventually, agents-general were appointed by some colonies to represent their commercial, legal, and diplomatic interests in Britain and to the British government and [[Whitehall]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5T5waG0z7VIC&q=%22edward%20jenkins%22%20agent-general&pg=PT21 |title=Commissions High: Canada in London, 1870–1971 |first=Roy |last=MacLaren |date=1 January 2006 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |isbn=9780773560123 }}</ref> They were appointed, and their expenses and salaries provided, by the governments of the colonies they represented.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Agent-General|volume=1|page=374}}</ref>

Starting in 1886, Quebec and the federal Canadian government also appointed agents-general to Paris. The first, [[Hector Fabre]], was dispatched by the province of [[Quebec]] but was asked by the federal government to represent all of Canada. He and his successor, [[Philippe Roy]], continued to represent both Quebec City and Ottawa in France until 1912 when the federal government asked Roy to resign his Quebec position to avoid conflicts of interest. Canadian provinces have also appointed agent-generals (called delegates-general in Quebec beginning in the 1970s) to other countries and major cities.

Following a military coup in Nigeria in 1966, the federal system was abolished, and the posts of the agents-general of Nigerian regions in [[London]] were subsumed in the [[High Commission of Nigeria, London|Nigerian High Commission]].

By the 1990s, some Australian state governments regarded the office of their agent-general in London as a costly anachronism, even for promoting tourism and investment, and have since been closed and subsumed into the [[High Commission of Australia, London|Australian High Commission]]. The majority of Australian states continue to have agents-general in London, but operate from [[Australia House]] rather than maintain separate premises.

Many Canadian provinces similarly are no longer represented by an agent-general, although Quebec continues to have a [[Quebec Government Offices|Government Office]] in London (''{{lang|fr|Délégation générale du Québec à Londres}}'') and in several other cities around the world. [[Ontario]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]] have representatives who work out of the [[Embassy of Canada, Washington, D.C.|Canadian Embassy in Washington, DC]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2013/08/ontario-appoints-new-representative-in-washington.html |title=Ontario Appoints New Representative in Washington |website=[[Premier of Ontario|Office of the Premier]] |date=15 August 2013 |access-date=26 September 2016}}</ref>

===Agents-general for New South Wales===
The [[New South Wales]] Office in London was one of several overseas offices established by the colonies of Australia to represent their interests. The London Office was established after the appointment of the first Agent-General on 1 May 1864. In June 1932, the Agent-General's Office was abolished as a cost-cutting measure and was replaced by the New South Wales Government Offices, London, to be headed by an "Official Representative".<ref name=ab/> The title was renamed Agent-General in 1937, but was left vacant from 1939 to 1946 due to the [[Second World War]]. From 1972 to 1993, the Agent-General's Office was located in separate premises from [[Australia House]], at the nearby address of 66 The Strand, which was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in May 1972.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51941575 |title=People and Fashion |work=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |location=Australia, Australia |date=14 June 1972 |access-date=16 February 2018 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author1=New South Wales | title=A House in the Strand : a history of the site of New South Wales House | date=1972 | publisher=New South Wales Govt | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11472728 | access-date=16 February 2018 }}</ref>

In October 1992, the position of NSW Agent-General in London was abolished by the [[John Fahey (politician)|Fahey]] government. This occurred following an expenses scandal by the last Agent-General, [[Neil Pickard]], who had been appointed as a consolation for losing his seat in parliament.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article122352190 |title=Greiner admits broken promise on plum London post |work=The Canberra Times |volume=65 |issue=20,439 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=29 March 1991 |access-date=16 February 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Following its abolition, Fahey noted to Parliament: "It was abundantly clear to me, to all Cabinet and to all Government that we no longer needed an agent-general's office in London. That was a throwback to colonial days - to the days when it was important to have garden parties and to participate in ceremonies. Quite frankly, little or no benefit accrued to New South Wales by participating in such a process."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fahey|first1=John|last2=Carr|first2=Bob|title=Former Agent-General Neil Pickard|url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1323879322-8376|website=Legislative Assembly|publisher=Parliament of New South Wales|access-date=15 February 2018|format=Hansard|date=3 May 1994}}</ref> The Agent-General's Office was replaced by the NSW Government Trade and Investment Office, London, which had no ceremonial function, but focused on the promotion of investment and trade in the UK and Europe.<ref>{{cite web |title=NSW Government Trade and Investment Office, London |url=http://investigator.records.nsw.gov.au/Entity.aspx?Path=\Agency\5133 |work=Archives Investigator – Agency Detail |publisher=NSW Government State Records |access-date=8 October 2012}}</ref> The NSW Government of [[Gladys Berejiklian]] considered reviving the Agent-General position in late-2019, noting that "We know the post-Brexit environment is going to be very different and NSW can gain a lot of opportunities in business from the UK".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Risso |first1=Angelo |title=NSW could revive UK agent-general role |url=https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6359909/nsw-could-revive-uk-agent-general-role/?cs=14264 |access-date=11 April 2020 |agency=The Canberra Times |date=1 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Alexandra |title='Throwback to colonial days': NSW considering reinstating plum posting in London |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/nsw/throwback-to-colonial-days-nsw-considering-reinstating-plum-posting-to-london-20190831-p52moy.html |access-date=11 April 2020 |agency=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=1 September 2019}}</ref>

===Agents-general for Quebec===
{{further|Quebec Government Offices}}
[[Quebec]] uses the title agent-general or delegate-general. In 1936, legislation was passed by the government of [[Maurice Duplessis]] closing all Quebec government offices abroad. The government of [[Adélard Godbout]] repealed the legislation and opened an office in [[New York City]] in 1940. When Duplessis returned to power in 1944, his government retained the New York City office and its agent-general but opened no others. In the early 1960s, the government of [[Jean Lesage]] began to open additional offices abroad appointing in Paris (1961), London (1962), Rome and Milan (1965) and subsequent governments opened offices in Chicago (1969), Boston, Lafayette, Dallas and Los Angeles (1970), Munich and Berlin (1971), Brussels (1972), Atlanta (1977), Washington (1978), Mexico City and Tokyo (1980), Beijing and Santiago (1998), Shanghai and Barcelona (1999), Mumbai (2007), São Paulo (2008) and Moscow (2012).<ref name="Reuchamps">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nPfBQAAQBAJ&q=quebec+agent-general+duplessis+new+york&pg=PA168 |title=Minority Nations in Multinational Federations: A Comparative Study of Quebec and Wallonia |first=Min |last=Reuchamps |page=168 |date=17 December 2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317634720 }}</ref> In 1971, the title of agent-general was officially changed to delegate-general although previous title is still often used, particularly for the government's representative to London.

As of 2016, the government of Quebec has delegates-general (agents-general) in London, Brussels, Mexico City, New York, Paris, and Tokyo; delegates to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Rome, and offices headed by directors offering more limited services in Barcelona, Beijing, Dakar, Hong Kong, Mumbai, São Paulo, Shanghai, Stockholm, and Washington.
