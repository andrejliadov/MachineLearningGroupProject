The [[blazon]] of the '''[[coat of arms]] of the [[Princess of Asturias]]''' is given by a Royal Decree 979 on 30 October 2015 which was an amendment of the Royal Decree 1511 dated [[Madrid]] 21 January 1977, which also created her guidon (military personal ensign) and her standard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boletín Oficial del Estado|url=http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2015/10/31/pdfs/BOE-A-2015-11729.pdf|access-date=31 October 2015|language=es}}</ref>

==Official blazon==

The shield is divided into four quarters, blazoned as follows:

*1st, [[Gules]] a castle three-towered [[Or (heraldry)|Or]], masoned [[Sable]] ajoure, (door and windows) [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]], for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]];
*2nd, [[Argent]] a lion rampant Purpure crowned Or, armed Gules and crowned Or, for [[Kingdom of León|León]];
*3rd, Or four pallets Gules, for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]];
*4th, Gules a cross, saltire and orle of chains all linked Or, an emerald Proper, for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]];
*''Enté en point'', Argent a pomegranate Proper seeded Gules, supported, sculpted and leafed in two leaves [[Vert (heraldry)|Vert]], for [[Granada]];
*[[Inescutcheon]], Azure with three [[fleurs-de-lys]] Or, [[bordure]]d Gules, for [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]].

The whole is differenced by a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points Azure, the [[brisure|difference]] used by heirs apparent to the [[House of Habsburg|Spanish House of Habsburg]].

The shield is surmounted by a closed crown, which is a circle of gold, inset with precious stones of their colours, composed of eight rosettes of acanthus leaves, of which five are visible, interspersed by pearls in their colour, issuing from which are four pearl diadems, of which three are visible, which converge in a blue orb, with gold semi-meridian and equator, surmounted by a gold cross, the crown lined with red and surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]].

Before 2001, the heir to the Spanish throne used this coat of arms unofficially, and still does in Aragon or Navarre, where a different version of the coat of arms, as Prince or Princess of Girona and Viana respectively, is displayed. It is likely that these arms will also be some day adopted officially.<ref>Herrera Sánchez, Alfonso (2010).
