'''Margaret Ann Neve''' (''[[née]]'' '''Harvey'''; 18 May 1792 – 4 April 1903) was the first recorded female [[supercentenarian]] and the second validated human to reach the age of 110 after [[Geert Adriaans Boomgaard]]. Neve lived at [[Saint Peter Port]] on the island of [[Guernsey]] in the [[English Channel]]. She was also the first proven individual whose life spanned three centuries (18th to the 20th centuries).

==Family==
By Margaret's birth, her family was already well-established on the island. Her father John Harvey was born in [[Cornwall]] in 1771 to John (1736–1778) and Margaret Ann Parker (d. 1790). John Harvey was involved in merchant shipping and [[privateer]]ing, earning a great amount of wealth over the years. He married Elizabeth Harvey (''née'' Guille) when they were both 19. John died on 4 December 1820 at the age of 49, and Elizabeth lived with her remaining children in a house called "Chaumière" ("The Thatched Cottage"), which he had bought in 1808.<ref name="Priaulx">{{cite web |url=http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/priaulx-library-new-details2.asp?ItemID=95 |title=The Harvey Family |work=Priaulx Library |date=2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022135751/http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/priaulx-library-new-details2.asp?ItemID=95 |archivedate=22 October 2013}}</ref> Elizabeth died in 1871 at the age of 99.<ref name="Priaulx" />

Together they had seven children:
* Margaret (1792–1903)
* John (1793–1865) – married Anne Sophia Grut (1802–1844) in 1826 and moved to Jersey, then England. They had a son named Thomas, who served in the militia and became a merchant.
* Elizabeth (1796–) – married
* Maria (1799) and Augusta (1801) had died as infants
* Thomas (1803) emigrated to the United States
* Augusta (1804) – married
* Louisa (1805–1821)

==Early life and marriage==
Born Margaret Ann Harvey on 18 May 1792, the eldest of seven children, most of her childhood was spent in Guernsey. Early in her life, she survived a fall down the stairs, which left her [[concussion|concussed]] for three days.<ref name="Priaulx" />

Neve, as she would become known, could remember the turmoil that the [[French Revolution]] brought to Guernsey; at the time, her father was in command of the militia on the island. In 1807, at the age of 15, Neve set sail for [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] with her father, but a storm caused the ship to land at [[Chesil Beach]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/chambersofcommerce/guernsey-1808-9.pdf |title=Guernsey (Channel Islands) chamber of commerce, members in 1808-9.}}</ref><ref name="Priaulx" />

She was educated in [[Bristol]], England, gaining an interest in literature and poetry. In 1815, she went to a "finishing school" in Brussels, becoming fluent in French and Italian and able to converse in German and Spanish. She would read the [[New Testament]] in Greek.<ref name=BIB/>{{rp|19}}

With her headmistress, she visited the battlefield of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], shortly after [[Battle of Waterloo|the battle]], once the corpses had been buried. There, Margaret picked up souvenirs which she showed to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] in London.<ref name=BIB/>{{rp|19}}

Neve met with [[Charles François Dumouriez]], a general of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], who dubbed her "la spirituelle".<ref name="neve1">{{cite news|title=Obituary|pages=10|work=[[The Times]]|date=6 April 1903}}</ref>

Margaret married John Neve, born 1779, from [[Tenterden]], Kent,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/04/19/101990032.pdf |title=The Late Mrs Neve |work=The New York Times |date=19 April 1903}}</ref> in St Peter Port (Town) church on 18 January 1823. On their honeymoon, they visited the Waterloo battlefield, 8 years after the battle.<ref name="ST03">{{cite news |title=AGED 110 YEARS |work=The Straits Times|date=7 May 1903 |page=6}}</ref> She lived in England for 25 years of marriage, but when her husband died in 1849, she returned to Guernsey.<ref name="neve2">{{cite news|title=Her Hundred-and-eighth Birthday|pages=3|work=[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]|date=18 May 1900}}</ref> They had no children.

== Later life and death ==

The census for 1871 shows Margaret A. Neve (78) and her sister Elizabeth Harvey (73) living at 'Chaumière', Rouge Huis, St Peter Port, Guernsey.<ref>RG10-5765-222-1</ref> Neve traveled abroad to various countries with Elizabeth. Their last trip was in 1872 when Neve was 80, wherein they visited the Polish city of [[Krakow]] (then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]).<ref name="neve2" />

On 18 May 1899, a reception was held at [[Rouge Huis]] to celebrate her 107th birthday and her entrance into her 108th year. The town council, [[jurat]]s, the officers of the staff, and about 250 of the leading residents attended.<ref>{{cite news |title=Unexampled Longevity. |pages=21 |work=[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]|date=18 June 1899}}</ref> Despite her age, Margaret was found making marmalade the next morning by a reporter from ''[[The Times]]''. She was reported as never being ill until the age of 105 when she had the flu, followed by bronchitis at 108. At the age of 110, she climbed a tree to pluck an apple, explaining that they were much tastier when eaten straight from the tree.<ref name="BIB">{{cite book |first=Glen |last=Balfour-Pau |title=Bagpipes in Babylon: A Lifetime in the Arab World and Beyond |ISBN=9781845111519 |publisher=I.B.Tauris, 2006}}</ref>{{rp|18}}

A newspaper report records that she enjoyed a glass and a half of old sherry at lunchtime, followed by a weak whiskey and water at supper. She was in the habit of always rising early and abstaining from eating and drinking between meal times.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Oldest Woman in the World |publisher=arence and Richmond Examiner |date=19 February 1901 |page=3}}</ref> Contrary to popular belief, she did not receive congratulations from [[Queen Victoria]] (who had died in 1901) upon reaching her 110th birthday (celebrated in 1902). However, the Harvey family (through Neve's niece Louisa) did exchange correspondence with the Royal Household, expressing gratitude for the signed photograph given to them on 4 May 1896 by the Queen.<ref name="Priaulx" />

Neve died on 4 April 1903, a month before her 111th birthday. She reportedly repeated a [[Psalm]] in a loud voice the day before she died. Flags in Guernsey were lowered to half mast as a show of respect.<ref name=BIB/>{{rp|20}} She was one of the last few living people from the 18th century.
