A '''centenarian''' is a person who has reached the age of 100 years. Because [[life expectancy|life expectancies]] worldwide are below 100 years, the term is invariably associated with [[longevity]]. In 2012, the [[United Nations]] estimated that there were 316,600 living centenarians worldwide.<ref name="WORLD2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2012/UNFPA-Report-Chapter1.pdf|title=Chapter 1: Setting the Scene|year=2012|publisher=UNFPA|access-date=11 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612052543/http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2012/UNFPA-Report-Chapter1.pdf|archive-date=12 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Expectancy is increasing across the world, and the world population has also increased rapidly, the number of centenarians is expected to increase quickly in the future.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1977733.stm|title=Life expectancy to soar|date=9 May 2002|work=BBC News}}</ref> According to the UK [[Office for National Statistics|ONS]], one-third of babies born in 2013 in the UK are expected to live to 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lifetables/historic-and-projected-data-from-the-period-and-cohort-life-tables/2012-based/sty-babies-living-to-100.html|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; One third of babies born in 2013 are expected to live to 100|date=11 December 2013|publisher=ONS|access-date=1 May 2016}}</ref>

==Supercentenarian==
A [[supercentenarian]], sometimes hyphenated as '''super-centenarian''', is a human who has reached the age of 110, something only achieved by about one in 1,000 centenarians.

Even rarer is a person [[List of the verified oldest people|who has lived to age 115]] – there are fewer than 100 people in [[recorded history]] who have indisputably reached this age, {{as of |2020|12|1|df=US}} only {{lang|ja-Latn|[[Kane Tanaka]]|italic=no}}, [[Lucile Randon]], {{lang|es|Francisca Celsa Dos Santos|italic=no}}, Jeanne Bot, {{lang|ja-Latn|Shigeyo Nakachi|italic=no}}, Hester Ford and Iris Westman are still living.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soa.org/library/journals/north-american-actuarial-journal/2002/july/naaj0207_6.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703065315/http://www.soa.org/library/journals/north-american-actuarial-journal/2002/july/naaj0207_6.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 July 2010 |title=Emergence of supercentenarians in low-mortality countries |work=North American Actuarial Journal (Vol. 6) |year=2002 |access-date=4 November 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.supercentenarians.org/publications.htm |title=Publications |doi=10.1016/S0531-5565 |publisher=Supercentenarians.org |access-date=4 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613010740/http://www.supercentenarians.org/publications.htm |archive-date=13 June 2010 |df=dmy-all |doi-broken-date=21 December 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Supercentenarians by H.

==Current incidences==

The United Nations predicts that there are 573,000 centenarians currently, almost quadrupling from the suggested 151,000 in the year 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/|title=World Population Prospects – Population Division – United Nations|website=population.un.org|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> According to a 1998 [[United Nations]] demographic survey, Japan is expected to have 272,000 centenarians by 2050;<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.un.org/NewLinks/older/99/older.htm |title= Demographics of older persons |publisher=UN |date=1 October 1998 |access-date=4 November 2010}}</ref> other sources suggest that the number could be closer to 1 million.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7612363.stm |title= Japan centenarians at record high |work= BBC News |date= 12 September 2008 |access-date=4 November 2010}}</ref> The incidence of centenarians in Japan was one per 3,522 people in 2008.<ref>[http://www.avmaroc.com/pdf/centenaires-japon-actualite-a140600-d.pdf ''De plus en plus de centenaires au Japon'' (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131702/http://www.avmaroc.com/pdf/centenaires-japon-actualite-a140600-d.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}.

In Japan, the number of centenarians is highly skewed towards females. Japan in fiscal year 2016 had 57,525 female centenarians, while males were 8,167, a ratio of 7:1. The increase of centenarians was even more skewed at 11.6:1.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/09/13/national/aging-japan-now-65692-centenarians/ |title= Aging Japan now has 65692 centenarians |date= 2013-09-13 |access-date= 2017-04-22 |work= The Japan Times}}</ref>

==Centenarian populations by country==
The total number of living centenarians in the world remains uncertain. It was estimated by the [https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/ Population Division] of the United Nations as 23,000 in 1950, 110,000 in 1990, 150,000 in 1995, 209,000 in 2000, 324,000 in 2005<ref>[http://esa.un.org/unpp "World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision"] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071216015218/http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |date=16 December 2007 }}.

====United Kingdom and Commonwealth====
In the United Kingdom and the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, the monarch sends greetings (formerly as a [[telegram]]) on the 100th birthday and on every birthday beginning with the 105th. The tradition of Royal congratulations dates from 1908, when the Secretary for King [[Edward VII]] sent a congratulatory letter to Reverend Thomas Lord of [[Horncastle, Lincolnshire|Horncastle]] in a newspaper clipping, declaring, "I am commanded by the King to congratulate you on the attainment of your hundredth year, after a most useful life".
 
The practice was formalised from 1917, under the reign of King [[George V]], who also sent congratulations on the attainment of a [[Diamond jubilee|Diamond Wedding Anniversary]] (or jubilee) marking 60 years of marriage.

Queen [[Elizabeth II]] sends a greeting card style with the notation: "I am so pleased to know that you are celebrating your one-hundredth birthday, I send my congratulations and best wishes to you on such a special occasion", thereafter each few years the card is updated with a current picture of the Queen to ensure people do not receive the same card more than once. The Queen further sends her congratulations on one's 105th birthday and every year thereafter as well as on special wedding anniversaries; people must apply for greetings three weeks before the event, on the official British Monarch's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/a-royal-tradition-the-queens-100th-birthday-messages-8673|title=A Royal tradition: The Queen's 100th birthday messages|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215065254/http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/a-royal-tradition-the-queens-100th-birthday-messages-8673|archive-date=15 February 2019}}</ref>

====Russian Federation====
In 2019, there were reported to be over 20,000 centenarians living in Russia, a sharp increase from 6,700 in 2007.

Centenarians in Russia receive a letter from the [[President of Russia]], currently [[Vladimir Putin]], officially congratulating them for reaching one hundred years.

===North America===

In the United States, centenarians traditionally receive a letter from the [[President of the United States|President]], congratulating them for their longevity.

===Asia===
====Japan====
Japanese centenarians receive a silver cup and a certificate from the [[Prime Minister of Japan]] upon the [[Respect for the Aged Day]] following their 100th birthday, honouring them for their longevity and prosperity in their lives.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/03/us-japan-birthday-idUSTRE5220ZP20090303 Ageing Japan cuts cost of 100th birthday gifts March 3, 2009] ''[[Reuters]]'' Retrieved September 26, 2015</ref><ref>Izadi, Elahe [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/08/21/japan-has-so-many-super-old-people-that-it-cant-afford-to-give-them-special-sake-cups-anymore/ Japan has so many super old people that it can’t afford to give them special sake cups anymore August 21, 2015] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' Retrieved September 26, 2015</ref><ref>Plucinska, Joanna [http://time.com/4004281/japan-centenarian-gift-seniors-day-sakazuki/ Japan Can’t Afford to Give Centenarians Gifts Anymore Because There Are Too Many of Them August 20, 2015] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' Retrieved September 26, 2015</ref>

In [[Madhya Pradesh]], the award known as [[Shatayu Samman]] is given out to persons who live at least a 100 years to promote awareness of good health.<ref>{{cite web|title='Oldest' Indian man dies in Madhya Pradesh|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/oldest-indian-man-dies-in-madhya-pradesh_100583050.html|access-date=10 June 2012}}</ref>

==Worldwide cultural traditions and rituals==
An aspect of [[blessing]] in many cultures is to offer a wish that the recipient lives to 100 years old. Among [[Hindu]]s, people who touch the feet of elders are often blessed with "May you live a hundred years". In Sweden, the traditional birthday song states, ''May he/she live for one hundred years.'' In [[Judaism]], the term ''May you live to be 120 years old'' is a common blessing. In Poland, ''[[Sto lat]]'', a wish to live a hundred years, is a traditional form of praise and good wishes, and the song "sto lat, sto lat" is sung on the occasion of the birthday celebrations—arguably, it is the most popular song in Poland and among Poles around the globe.

Chinese emperors were hailed to [[ten thousand years|live ten thousand years]], while empresses were hailed to live a thousand years. In Italy, "A hundred of these days!" (''cento di questi giorni'') is an [[augury]] for birthdays, to live to celebrate 100 more birthdays.<ref>[http://en.allexperts.com/q/Italian-Language-1584/Italian-Translation.htm Italian Translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222021528/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Italian-Language-1584/Italian-Translation.htm |date=22 December 2011 }}. AllExperts.com. 21 June 2007. Retrieved 22 March 2012.</ref> Some Italians say "Cent'anni!", which means "a hundred years", in that they wish that they could all live happily for a hundred years. In Greece, wishing someone Happy Birthday ends with the expression ''να τα εκατοστήσεις'' (''na ta ekatostisis''), which can be loosely translated as "may you make it one hundred birthdays". In Sri Lanka, it is a custom to bless as " you may live 220 instead of 120".

==Centenarians in antiquity==
While the number of centenarians per capita was much lower in ancient times than today, the data suggests that they were not unheard of.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Postel-Vinay O |title=Histoire Le Cas de la Grèce Antique |journal=[[La Recherche|La Recherche Special]] |volume=322 |page=90 |date=July–August 1999 |url=http://www.larecherche.fr/content/recherche/article?id=15880 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929202051/http://www.larecherche.fr/content/recherche/article?id=15880 |archive-date=29 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{better source| given source no longer online, gives only Gorgias as clear centenarian, none with exactly known age|date=September 2018}}

Estimates of [[life expectancy]] in antiquity are far lower than modern values mostly due to the far greater incidence of deaths in infancy or childhood. Those who lived past early childhood had a reasonable chance of living to a relatively old age.<ref>Mirko Grmek and Danielle Gourevitch (1998). ''Illness in Antiquity''. Fayard.</ref> The assumption of what constitutes "old age", or being "elderly", at least, seems to have remained unchanged since antiquity, the line being generally drawn at either sixty or sixty-five years;<ref>JOURNAL ARTICLE M. I. Finley, "The Elderly in Classical Antiquity", ''Greece & Rome'' 28.2 (1981), 156-171</ref> [[Psalm 90]]:10 in the [[Hebrew Bible]] appears to give seventy to eighty years as the natural life expectancy of a person surviving into old age, "The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty".

A survey of the lifespans of male individuals with entries in the ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' (i.e., a sample pre-selected to include those who lived long enough to attain historical notability) found a median lifespan of 72 years, and a range of 32 to 107 years, for 128 individuals born before 100 BC (though the same study found a median lifespan of 66 years for 100 individuals born after 100 BC but no later than 602 AD); by comparison, male individuals listed in ''Chambers Biographical Dictionary'' who died between 1900 and 1949 had a median lifespan of 71.5 years, with a range between 29 and 105 years.

The author of the 1994 study concluded that it was only in the second half of the 20th century that medical advances have extended the life expectancy of those who live into adulthood.<ref>"On this analysis, it is only in the present half-century that advances in medicine have allowed us to outlive those ancients of the BC era who managed to survive the early perils." J D Montagu, "Length of life in the ancient world: a controlled study", ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' 87 (January 1994).</ref>

Reliable references to individuals in antiquity who lived past 100 years are quite rare, but they do exist. For instance, Cicero's wife [[Terentia]] was reported by [[Pliny the Elder]] to have lived from 98 BC to 6 AD, 104 years.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[wikisource:la:Naturalis Historia/Liber VII|Naturalis Historia, lib. vii, 158]].</ref> Regnal dates of Bronze Age monarchs are notoriously unreliable; the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|sixth dynasty]] Egyptian ruler [[Pepi II]] is sometimes listed as having lived c. 2278 – c. 2184 BC, as he is said to have reigned for 94 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/98-030/hist1.pdf |title=A Short History of Egypt: Part I: From the Predynastic Period to the Old Kingdom |publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon University]] |access-date=4 November 2010}}</ref> but alternative readings cite a reign of just 64 years.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jacques Kinnaer |url=http://www.ancient-egypt.org/index.html |title=Pepi II |publisher=Ancient-Egypt.org |access-date=4 November 2011}}</ref> [[Addagoppe of Harran]], mother of the last king of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] Nabonidus lived from c. 648-544 BC according to an apparently autobiographical account.

[[Diogenes Laërtius]] (c. AD 250) gives one of the earliest references regarding the plausible centenarian longevity given by a scientist, the astronomer [[Hipparchus]] of Nicea (c. 185 – c. 120 BC), who, according to the doxographer, assured that the philosopher [[Democritus of Abdera]] (c. 470/460 – c. 370/360 BC) lived 109 years. All other ancient accounts of Democritus appear to agree that the philosopher lived at least 90 years. The case of Democritus differs from those of, for example, [[Epimenides]] of Crete (7th and 6th centuries BC), who is said to have lived an implausible 154, 157 or 290 years, depending on the source.

Other ancient Greek philosophers thought to have lived beyond the age of 90 include [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] (c. 570/565 – c. 475/470 BC), [[Pyrrho]] of Ellis (c. 360 – c. 270 BC), and [[Eratosthenes]] of Cirene (c. 285 – c. 190 BC).

[[Hosius of Córdoba]], the man who convinced [[Constantine the Great]] to call the [[First Council of Nicaea]], reportedly lived to age 102.
 
A rare record of an ordinary person who lived to be a centenarian is the tombstone of [[Roman Britain|Roman British]] legionary veteran Julius Valens, inscribed "VIXIT ANNIS C".<ref>[https://romaninscriptionsofbritain.org/inscriptions/363 Funerary inscription for Julius Valens]. Roman Inscriptions of Britain – RIB 363.</ref>

In the medieval period, [[Albert Azzo II, Margrave of Milan]] (d. 1097) is reported by [[Bernold of Constance]] as having lived past 100 years (''iam maior centenario'').<ref>''Bernoldi Chronicon'' (1097). MGH SS V, p. 465.</ref>

==Research==
{{Main|Research into centenarians}}

===Research in Italy===
Research in Italy suggests that healthy centenarians have high levels of both [[vitamin A]] and [[vitamin E]] and that this seems to be important in causing their extreme longevity.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mecocci P, Polidori MC, Troiano L |title=Plasma antioxidants and longevity: a study on healthy centenarians |journal=Free Radic Biol Med |volume=28 |issue=8 |pages=1243–8 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10889454 |doi=10.1016/S0891-5849(00)00246-X |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Other research contradicts this, however, and has found that this theory does not apply to centenarians from [[Sardinia]], for whom other factors probably play a more important role.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Polidori MC, Mariani E, Baggio G |title=Different antioxidant profiles in Italian centenarians: the Sardinian peculiarity |journal=Eur J Clin Nutr |volume=61 |issue=7 |pages=922–4 |date=Jul 2007 |pmid=17228351 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602596 |s2cid=34833898 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> A preliminary study carried out in Poland showed that, in comparison with young healthy female adults, centenarians living in [[Upper Silesia]] had significantly higher red blood cell [[glutathione reductase]] and [[catalase]] activities, although serum levels of [[vitamin E]] were not significantly higher.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kłapcińska B, Derejczyk J, Wieczorowska-Tobis K, Sobczak A, Sadowska-Krepa E, Danch A |title=Antioxidant defense in centenarians (a preliminary study) |journal=Acta Biochim.

In this study, the centenarians having the best cognitive and physical functional capacity tended to have the highest activity of this [[enzyme]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersen HR, Jeune B, Nybo H, Nielsen JB, Andersen-Ranberg K, Grandjean P |title=Low activity of superoxide dismutase and high activity of glutathione reductase in erythrocytes from centenarians |journal=Age Ageing |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=643–8 |date=Sep 1998 |pmid=12675104 |url=http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12675104 |doi=10.1093/ageing/27.5.643 |access-date=18 January 2011}}</ref>

Other research has found that people whose parents became centenarians have an increased number of naïve [[B cell]]s. It is well known that the children of parents who have a long life are also likely to reach a healthy age, but it is not known why, although the inherited genes are probably important.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2194078/Blood-tests-'could-be-used-to-predict-lifespan'.html "Blood tests 'could be used to predict lifespan'"]. ''The Daily Telegraph''. 25 June 2008.

PhysOrg.com. 3 February 2009. Retrieved 4 February 2009.</ref>

Men and women who are 100 or older tend to have extroverted personalities, according to Thomas T. Perls, the director of the New England Centenarian Study at Boston University. Centenarians will often have many friends, strong ties to relatives and high self-esteem. In addition, some research suggests that the offspring of centenarians are more likely to age in better cardiovascular health than their peers.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Adams ER, Nolan VG, Andersen SL, Perls TT, Terry DF |title=Centenarian offspring: start healthier and stay healthier |journal=J Am Geriatr Soc |volume=56 |issue=11 |pages=2089–92 |date=Nov 2008 |pmid=18811609 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01949.x |pmc=2892731 }}</ref>

==DNA repair==

==Japanese bio-study==
{{see|Aging of Japan}} {{see|Elderly people in Japan}}
Many experts attribute Japan's high life expectancy to the typical Japanese diet, which is particularly low in refined simple carbohydrates, and to hygienic practices. The number of centenarians in relation to the total population was, in September 2010, 114% higher in [[Shimane Prefecture]] than the national average. This ratio was also 92% higher in [[Okinawa Prefecture]].<ref name="Santrock">Santrock, John (2008). "Physical Development and Biological Aging". In Mike Ryan, Michael J.

# A diet that is heavy on grains, fish, and vegetables and light on meat, eggs, and dairy products.
# Low-stress lifestyles, which are proven significantly less stressful than that of the mainland inhabitants of Japan.
# A caring community, where older adults are not isolated and are taken better care of.
# High levels of activity, where locals work until an older age than the average age in other countries, and more emphasis on activities like walking and gardening to keep active.
# Spirituality, where a sense of purpose comes from involvement in spiritual matters and prayer eases the mind of stress and problems.<ref name="Santrock"/>

Although these factors vary from those mentioned in the previous study, the culture of Okinawa has proven these factors to be important in its large population of centenarians.<ref name="Santrock"/>

A historical study from Korea found that male [[eunuchs]] in the royal court had a centenarian rate of over 3%, and that eunuchs lived on average 14 to 19 years longer than uncastrated men.<ref name="eunuch">{{cite web|title=Upside to castration?

===Centenarian controversy in Japan===
The number of Japanese centenarians was called into question in 2010, following a series of reports showing that hundreds of thousands of elderly people had gone "missing" in the country. The deaths of many centenarians had not been reported, casting doubt on the country's reputation for having a large population of centenarians.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/11/world/asia/11japan.html |title=Japan's Elderly Count Was Off by 234,000 |first=Martin |last=Fackler |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 September 2010|access-date=26 July 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11258071 |title=More than 230,000 Japanese centenarians 'missing' |publisher=BBC |date=10 September 2010 |access-date=4 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/09/10/world/main6853038.shtml |title=More Than 230,000 Centenarians Missing in Japan |publisher=CBS News |date=10 September 2010 |access-date=4 November 2010}}</ref>

In July 2010, [[Sogen Kato]], a centenarian listed as the oldest living male in [[Tokyo]], registered to be aged 111, was found to have died some 30 years before; his body was found mummified in his bed,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/7917131/Tokyos-oldest-man-dead-for-30-years.html "Tokyo's 'oldest man' dead for 30 years"].

==Epigenetic studies==
By measuring the biological age of various tissues from centenarians, researchers may be able to identify tissues that are protected from aging effects. According to a study of 30 different body parts from centenarians and younger controls, the [[cerebellum]] is the youngest brain region (and probably body part) in centenarians (about 15 years younger than expected<ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum">{{Cite journal| title = The cerebellum ages slowly according to the epigenetic clock. | journal = Aging| volume = 7 | year = 2015| pmid = 26000617  |pmc= 4468311|vauthors=Horvath S, Mah V, Lu AT, Woo JS, Choi OW, Jasinska AJ, Riancho JA, Tung S, Coles NS, Braun J, Vinters HV, Coles LS | issue = 5 | doi=10.18632/aging.100742 | pages=294–306}}</ref>) according to an epigenetic biomarker of tissue age known as [[epigenetic clock]].<ref name="Horvath2013">{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 14| issue = 10 | page = R115 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115 | pmid=24138928 | pmc=4015143}}</ref>

These findings could explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age related dementias compared to other brain regions. Further, the offspring of semi-supercentenarians (subjects who reached an age of 105–109 years) have a lower epigenetic age than age-matched controls (age difference=5.1 years in peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and centenarians are younger (8.6 years) than expected based on their chronological age.<ref name="Horvath2015centenarian">{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S  | date = 2015 | title = Decreased epigenetic age of PBMCs from Italian semi-supercentenarians and their offspring.| journal = Aging | volume = 7| issue = Dec| pages =1159–1170| pmc = 4712339| pmid = 26678252 | doi = 10.18632/aging.100861 }}</ref>

Centenarians are often the subject of news stories, which often focus on the fact that they are over 100 years old. Along with the typical birthday celebrations, these reports provide researchers and cultural historians with evidence as to how the rest of society views this elderly population. Some examples:

Because [[life expectancy|life expectancies]] worldwide are below 100 years, the term is invariably associated with [[longevity]].

The United Nations predicts that there are 573,000 centenarians currently, almost quadrupling from the suggested 151,000 in the year 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/|title=World Population Prospects – Population Division – United Nations|website=population.un.org|access-date=2020-02-19}}</ref> According to a 1998 [[United Nations]] demographic survey, Japan is expected to have 272,000 centenarians by 2050;<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.un.org/NewLinks/older/99/older.htm |title= Demographics of older persons |publisher=UN |date=1 October 1998 |access-date=4 November 2010}}</ref> other sources suggest that the number could be closer to 1 million.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7612363.stm |title= Japan centenarians at record high |work= BBC News |date= 12 September 2008 |access-date=4 November 2010}}</ref> The incidence of centenarians in Japan was one per 3,522 people in 2008.<ref>[http://www.avmaroc.com/pdf/centenaires-japon-actualite-a140600-d.pdf ''De plus en plus de centenaires au Japon'' (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131702/http://www.avmaroc.com/pdf/centenaires-japon-actualite-a140600-d.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}. Agence France Presse via Avmaroc.com. 12 September 2008. Retrieved 24 February 2013.</ref>

In Japan, the number of centenarians is highly skewed towards females. Japan in fiscal year 2016 had 57,525 female centenarians, while males were 8,167, a ratio of 7:1. The increase of centenarians was even more skewed at 11.6:1.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/09/13/national/aging-japan-now-65692-centenarians/ |title= Aging Japan now has 65692 centenarians |date= 2013-09-13 |access-date= 2017-04-22 |work= The Japan Times}}</ref>

==Centenarian populations by country==
The total number of living centenarians in the world remains uncertain. It was estimated by the [https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/ Population Division] of the United Nations as 23,000 in 1950, 110,000 in 1990, 150,000 in 1995, 209,000 in 2000, 324,000 in 2005<ref>[http://esa.un.org/unpp "World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision"] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071216015218/http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |date=16 December 2007 }}.

Population Division – Department of Economic and Social Affairs. United Nations. October 2010. p.27.</ref> However, these older estimates did not take into account the contemporary downward adjustments of national estimates made by several countries such as the United States; thus, in 2012, the UN estimated there to be only 316,600 centenarians worldwide.<ref name=WORLD2012/> The following table gives estimated centenarian populations by country, including both the latest and the earliest known estimates, where available.

====United Kingdom and Commonwealth====
In the United Kingdom and the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, the monarch sends greetings (formerly as a [[telegram]]) on the 100th birthday and on every birthday beginning with the 105th. The tradition of Royal congratulations dates from 1908, when the Secretary for King [[Edward VII]] sent a congratulatory letter to Reverend Thomas Lord of [[Horncastle, Lincolnshire|Horncastle]] in a newspaper clipping, declaring, "I am commanded by the King to congratulate you on the attainment of your hundredth year, after a most useful life".
 
The practice was formalised from 1917, under the reign of King [[George V]], who also sent congratulations on the attainment of a [[Diamond jubilee|Diamond Wedding Anniversary]] (or jubilee) marking 60 years of marriage.

Queen [[Elizabeth II]] sends a greeting card style with the notation: "I am so pleased to know that you are celebrating your one-hundredth birthday, I send my congratulations and best wishes to you on such a special occasion", thereafter each few years the card is updated with a current picture of the Queen to ensure people do not receive the same card more than once. The Queen further sends her congratulations on one's 105th birthday and every year thereafter as well as on special wedding anniversaries; people must apply for greetings three weeks before the event, on the official British Monarch's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/a-royal-tradition-the-queens-100th-birthday-messages-8673|title=A Royal tradition: The Queen's 100th birthday messages|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215065254/http://royalcentral.co.uk/blogs/a-royal-tradition-the-queens-100th-birthday-messages-8673|archive-date=15 February 2019}}</ref>

====Russian Federation====
In 2019, there were reported to be over 20,000 centenarians living in Russia, a sharp increase from 6,700 in 2007.

Centenarians in Russia receive a letter from the [[President of Russia]], currently [[Vladimir Putin]], officially congratulating them for reaching one hundred years.

===North America===
====United States====

===Asia===
====Japan====
Japanese centenarians receive a silver cup and a certificate from the [[Prime Minister of Japan]] upon the [[Respect for the Aged Day]] following their 100th birthday, honouring them for their longevity and prosperity in their lives.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/03/us-japan-birthday-idUSTRE5220ZP20090303 Ageing Japan cuts cost of 100th birthday gifts March 3, 2009] ''[[Reuters]]'' Retrieved September 26, 2015</ref><ref>Izadi, Elahe [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/08/21/japan-has-so-many-super-old-people-that-it-cant-afford-to-give-them-special-sake-cups-anymore/ Japan has so many super old people that it can’t afford to give them special sake cups anymore August 21, 2015] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' Retrieved September 26, 2015</ref><ref>Plucinska, Joanna [http://time.com/4004281/japan-centenarian-gift-seniors-day-sakazuki/ Japan Can’t Afford to Give Centenarians Gifts Anymore Because There Are Too Many of Them August 20, 2015] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' Retrieved September 26, 2015</ref>

==Worldwide cultural traditions and rituals==
An aspect of [[blessing]] in many cultures is to offer a wish that the recipient lives to 100 years old. Among [[Hindu]]s, people who touch the feet of elders are often blessed with "May you live a hundred years". In Sweden, the traditional birthday song states, ''May he/she live for one hundred years.'' In [[Judaism]], the term ''May you live to be 120 years old'' is a common blessing. In Poland, ''[[Sto lat]]'', a wish to live a hundred years, is a traditional form of praise and good wishes, and the song "sto lat, sto lat" is sung on the occasion of the birthday celebrations—arguably, it is the most popular song in Poland and among Poles around the globe.

Chinese emperors were hailed to [[ten thousand years|live ten thousand years]], while empresses were hailed to live a thousand years. In Italy, "A hundred of these days!" (''cento di questi giorni'') is an [[augury]] for birthdays, to live to celebrate 100 more birthdays.<ref>[http://en.allexperts.com/q/Italian-Language-1584/Italian-Translation.htm Italian Translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222021528/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Italian-Language-1584/Italian-Translation.htm |date=22 December 2011 }}. AllExperts.com. 21 June 2007. Retrieved 22 March 2012.</ref> Some Italians say "Cent'anni!", which means "a hundred years", in that they wish that they could all live happily for a hundred years. In Greece, wishing someone Happy Birthday ends with the expression ''να τα εκατοστήσεις'' (''na ta ekatostisis''), which can be loosely translated as "may you make it one hundred birthdays". In Sri Lanka, it is a custom to bless as " you may live 220 instead of 120".

==Centenarians in antiquity==
While the number of centenarians per capita was much lower in ancient times than today, the data suggests that they were not unheard of.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Postel-Vinay O |title=Histoire Le Cas de la Grèce Antique |journal=[[La Recherche|La Recherche Special]] |volume=322 |page=90 |date=July–August 1999 |url=http://www.larecherche.fr/content/recherche/article?id=15880 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929202051/http://www.larecherche.fr/content/recherche/article?id=15880 |archive-date=29 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{better source| given source no longer online, gives only Gorgias as clear centenarian, none with exactly known age|date=September 2018}}

Estimates of [[life expectancy]] in antiquity are far lower than modern values mostly due to the far greater incidence of deaths in infancy or childhood. Those who lived past early childhood had a reasonable chance of living to a relatively old age.<ref>Mirko Grmek and Danielle Gourevitch (1998). ''Illness in Antiquity''. Fayard.</ref> The assumption of what constitutes "old age", or being "elderly", at least, seems to have remained unchanged since antiquity, the line being generally drawn at either sixty or sixty-five years;<ref>JOURNAL ARTICLE M. I. Finley, "The Elderly in Classical Antiquity", ''Greece & Rome'' 28.2 (1981), 156-171</ref> [[Psalm 90]]:10 in the [[Hebrew Bible]] appears to give seventy to eighty years as the natural life expectancy of a person surviving into old age, "The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty".

A survey of the lifespans of male individuals with entries in the ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' (i.e., a sample pre-selected to include those who lived long enough to attain historical notability) found a median lifespan of 72 years, and a range of 32 to 107 years, for 128 individuals born before 100 BC (though the same study found a median lifespan of 66 years for 100 individuals born after 100 BC but no later than 602 AD); by comparison, male individuals listed in ''Chambers Biographical Dictionary'' who died between 1900 and 1949 had a median lifespan of 71.5 years, with a range between 29 and 105 years.

The author of the 1994 study concluded that it was only in the second half of the 20th century that medical advances have extended the life expectancy of those who live into adulthood.<ref>"On this analysis, it is only in the present half-century that advances in medicine have allowed us to outlive those ancients of the BC era who managed to survive the early perils." J D Montagu, "Length of life in the ancient world: a controlled study", ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' 87 (January 1994).</ref>

Reliable references to individuals in antiquity who lived past 100 years are quite rare, but they do exist. For instance, Cicero's wife [[Terentia]] was reported by [[Pliny the Elder]] to have lived from 98 BC to 6 AD, 104 years.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[wikisource:la:Naturalis Historia/Liber VII|Naturalis Historia, lib. vii, 158]].</ref> Regnal dates of Bronze Age monarchs are notoriously unreliable; the [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|sixth dynasty]] Egyptian ruler [[Pepi II]] is sometimes listed as having lived c. 2278 – c. 2184 BC, as he is said to have reigned for 94 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/98-030/hist1.pdf |title=A Short History of Egypt: Part I: From the Predynastic Period to the Old Kingdom |publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon University]] |access-date=4 November 2010}}</ref> but alternative readings cite a reign of just 64 years.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jacques Kinnaer |url=http://www.ancient-egypt.org/index.html |title=Pepi II |publisher=Ancient-Egypt.org |access-date=4 November 2011}}</ref> [[Addagoppe of Harran]], mother of the last king of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] Nabonidus lived from c. 648-544 BC according to an apparently autobiographical account.

[[Diogenes Laërtius]] (c. AD 250) gives one of the earliest references regarding the plausible centenarian longevity given by a scientist, the astronomer [[Hipparchus]] of Nicea (c. 185 – c. 120 BC), who, according to the doxographer, assured that the philosopher [[Democritus of Abdera]] (c. 470/460 – c. 370/360 BC) lived 109 years. All other ancient accounts of Democritus appear to agree that the philosopher lived at least 90 years. The case of Democritus differs from those of, for example, [[Epimenides]] of Crete (7th and 6th centuries BC), who is said to have lived an implausible 154, 157 or 290 years, depending on the source.

Other ancient Greek philosophers thought to have lived beyond the age of 90 include [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] (c. 570/565 – c. 475/470 BC), [[Pyrrho]] of Ellis (c. 360 – c. 270 BC), and [[Eratosthenes]] of Cirene (c. 285 – c. 190 BC).

[[Hosius of Córdoba]], the man who convinced [[Constantine the Great]] to call the [[First Council of Nicaea]], reportedly lived to age 102.
 
A rare record of an ordinary person who lived to be a centenarian is the tombstone of [[Roman Britain|Roman British]] legionary veteran Julius Valens, inscribed "VIXIT ANNIS C".<ref>[https://romaninscriptionsofbritain.org/inscriptions/363 Funerary inscription for Julius Valens]. Roman Inscriptions of Britain – RIB 363.</ref>

In the medieval period, [[Albert Azzo II, Margrave of Milan]] (d. 1097) is reported by [[Bernold of Constance]] as having lived past 100 years (''iam maior centenario'').<ref>''Bernoldi Chronicon'' (1097). MGH SS V, p. 465.</ref>

==Research==
{{Main|Research into centenarians}}

===Research in Italy===
Research in Italy suggests that healthy centenarians have high levels of both [[vitamin A]] and [[vitamin E]] and that this seems to be important in causing their extreme longevity.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mecocci P, Polidori MC, Troiano L |title=Plasma antioxidants and longevity: a study on healthy centenarians |journal=Free Radic Biol Med |volume=28 |issue=8 |pages=1243–8 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10889454 |doi=10.1016/S0891-5849(00)00246-X |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Other research contradicts this, however, and has found that this theory does not apply to centenarians from [[Sardinia]], for whom other factors probably play a more important role.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Polidori MC, Mariani E, Baggio G |title=Different antioxidant profiles in Italian centenarians: the Sardinian peculiarity |journal=Eur J Clin Nutr |volume=61 |issue=7 |pages=922–4 |date=Jul 2007 |pmid=17228351 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602596 |s2cid=34833898 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> A preliminary study carried out in Poland showed that, in comparison with young healthy female adults, centenarians living in [[Upper Silesia]] had significantly higher red blood cell [[glutathione reductase]] and [[catalase]] activities, although serum levels of [[vitamin E]] were not significantly higher.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kłapcińska B, Derejczyk J, Wieczorowska-Tobis K, Sobczak A, Sadowska-Krepa E, Danch A |title=Antioxidant defense in centenarians (a preliminary study) |journal=Acta Biochim.

Other research has found that people whose parents became centenarians have an increased number of naïve [[B cell]]s. It is well known that the children of parents who have a long life are also likely to reach a healthy age, but it is not known why, although the inherited genes are probably important.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2194078/Blood-tests-'could-be-used-to-predict-lifespan'.html "Blood tests 'could be used to predict lifespan'"].

Men and women who are 100 or older tend to have extroverted personalities, according to Thomas T. Perls, the director of the New England Centenarian Study at Boston University. Centenarians will often have many friends, strong ties to relatives and high self-esteem. In addition, some research suggests that the offspring of centenarians are more likely to age in better cardiovascular health than their peers.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Adams ER, Nolan VG, Andersen SL, Perls TT, Terry DF |title=Centenarian offspring: start healthier and stay healthier |journal=J Am Geriatr Soc |volume=56 |issue=11 |pages=2089–92 |date=Nov 2008 |pmid=18811609 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01949.x |pmc=2892731 }}</ref>

==DNA repair==

==Japanese bio-study==
{{see|Aging of Japan}} {{see|Elderly people in Japan}}
Many experts attribute Japan's high life expectancy to the typical Japanese diet, which is particularly low in refined simple carbohydrates, and to hygienic practices. The number of centenarians in relation to the total population was, in September 2010, 114% higher in [[Shimane Prefecture]] than the national average. This ratio was also 92% higher in [[Okinawa Prefecture]].<ref name="Santrock">Santrock, John (2008). "Physical Development and Biological Aging". In Mike Ryan, Michael J.

# A diet that is heavy on grains, fish, and vegetables and light on meat, eggs, and dairy products.
# Low-stress lifestyles, which are proven significantly less stressful than that of the mainland inhabitants of Japan.
# A caring community, where older adults are not isolated and are taken better care of.
# High levels of activity, where locals work until an older age than the average age in other countries, and more emphasis on activities like walking and gardening to keep active.
# Spirituality, where a sense of purpose comes from involvement in spiritual matters and prayer eases the mind of stress and problems.<ref name="Santrock"/>

Although these factors vary from those mentioned in the previous study, the culture of Okinawa has proven these factors to be important in its large population of centenarians.<ref name="Santrock"/>

===Centenarian controversy in Japan===
The number of Japanese centenarians was called into question in 2010, following a series of reports showing that hundreds of thousands of elderly people had gone "missing" in the country. The deaths of many centenarians had not been reported, casting doubt on the country's reputation for having a large population of centenarians.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/11/world/asia/11japan.html |title=Japan's Elderly Count Was Off by 234,000 |first=Martin |last=Fackler |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 September 2010|access-date=26 July 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11258071 |title=More than 230,000 Japanese centenarians 'missing' |publisher=BBC |date=10 September 2010 |access-date=4 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/09/10/world/main6853038.shtml |title=More Than 230,000 Centenarians Missing in Japan |publisher=CBS News |date=10 September 2010 |access-date=4 November 2010}}</ref>

In July 2010, [[Sogen Kato]], a centenarian listed as the oldest living male in [[Tokyo]], registered to be aged 111, was found to have died some 30 years before; his body was found mummified in his bed,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/7917131/Tokyos-oldest-man-dead-for-30-years.html "Tokyo's 'oldest man' dead for 30 years"].

==Epigenetic studies==
By measuring the biological age of various tissues from centenarians, researchers may be able to identify tissues that are protected from aging effects. According to a study of 30 different body parts from centenarians and younger controls, the [[cerebellum]] is the youngest brain region (and probably body part) in centenarians (about 15 years younger than expected<ref name="Horvath2015cerebellum">{{Cite journal| title = The cerebellum ages slowly according to the epigenetic clock. | journal = Aging| volume = 7 | year = 2015| pmid = 26000617  |pmc= 4468311|vauthors=Horvath S, Mah V, Lu AT, Woo JS, Choi OW, Jasinska AJ, Riancho JA, Tung S, Coles NS, Braun J, Vinters HV, Coles LS | issue = 5 | doi=10.18632/aging.100742 | pages=294–306}}</ref>) according to an epigenetic biomarker of tissue age known as [[epigenetic clock]].<ref name="Horvath2013">{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S | year = 2013 | title = DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 14| issue = 10 | page = R115 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115 | pmid=24138928 | pmc=4015143}}</ref>

These findings could explain why the cerebellum exhibits fewer neuropathological hallmarks of age related dementias compared to other brain regions. Further, the offspring of semi-supercentenarians (subjects who reached an age of 105–109 years) have a lower epigenetic age than age-matched controls (age difference=5.1 years in peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and centenarians are younger (8.6 years) than expected based on their chronological age.<ref name="Horvath2015centenarian">{{cite journal | last1 = Horvath | first1 = S  | date = 2015 | title = Decreased epigenetic age of PBMCs from Italian semi-supercentenarians and their offspring.| journal = Aging | volume = 7| issue = Dec| pages =1159–1170| pmc = 4712339| pmid = 26678252 | doi = 10.18632/aging.100861 }}</ref>

Centenarians are often the subject of news stories, which often focus on the fact that they are over 100 years old. Along with the typical birthday celebrations, these reports provide researchers and cultural historians with evidence as to how the rest of society views this elderly population. Some examples:
