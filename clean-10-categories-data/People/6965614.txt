{{short description|Society which lacks political leaders or hierarchies}}
In [[anthropology]], an '''acephalous society''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀκέφαλος "headless") is a society which lacks political leaders or hierarchies. Such groups are also known as [[Social stratification#Non-stratified societies|non-stratified]] societies. Typically these societies are small-scale,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of the social sciences|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Calhoun, Craig J., 1952-, Oxford University Press.|isbn=9780199891184|location=New York|oclc=51115271}}</ref> organized into bands or tribes that make decisions through [[consensus decision making]] rather than appointing permanent chiefs or kings. 

When these societies do not possess distinctions of rank, they are described as [[egalitarian]].<ref name=":0" /> 

In scientific literature covering native African societies and the effect of [[European colonialism]] on them the term is often used to describe groups of people living in a settlement with "no government in the sense of a group able to exercise effective control over both the people and their territory".<ref>H.S. Daannaa: "The Acephalous Society And The Indirect Rule System in Africa, Journal of Legal Pluralism And Unofficial Law, Nr. 34, p. 62, http://www.jlp.bham.ac.uk/volumes/34/daannaa-art.pdf</ref> In this respect the term is also often used as synonymous to "stateless society".<ref name="Ayittey">Daannaa, p61; G.N. Ayittey: "STATELESS SOCIETIES: The Igbo, the Fulani, the Somali", A New Nigeria, http://seunfakze.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/stateless-societies-the-igbo-the-fulani-the-somali-by-prof-g-n-ayittey/</ref> Such societies are described as consensus-democratic in opposition to the majority-democratic systems of the West.<ref>Ayittey, ibid.</ref>

The [[Igbo people|Igbo Nation]] in West Africa is alleged to be an acephalous or egalitarian society.<ref name="Ayittey"/>
