'''Jenna Jameson''' (born '''Jenna Marie Massoli''';<ref name="foxnews November 7, 2008" /> April 9, 1974) is an American model, former pornographic film actress, businesswoman, and television personality.<ref name=CNBC2014>{{cite web|url= https://www.cnbc.com/id/101338733|title= The return of Jenna Jameson|access-date= 2014-04-03|author= Chris Morris|date= 2014-01-15|publisher= [[CNBC]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141016012417/https://www.cnbc.com/id/101338733|archive-date= October 16, 2014|url-status= live|df= mdy-all}}</ref> She has been named the world's most famous adult entertainment performer<ref name="Forbes" /><ref name="Grigoriadis" /><ref name="WallStreetJournal" /> and "The Queen of Porn".<ref name="Cooper" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/the-50-prettiest-porn-stars-of-all-time/nina-mercedez|title=The 50 Prettiest Porn Stars of All Time|access-date=October 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164737/http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/the-50-prettiest-porn-stars-of-all-time/nina-mercedez|archive-date=October 21, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

She started acting in erotic videos in 1993 after having worked as a [[Striptease|stripper]] and [[Glamour photography|glamor model]]. By 1996, she had won the "Top Newcomer" award from each of the three major adult movie organizations. She has since won more than 35 adult-video awards, and has been inducted into the [[X-Rated Critics Organization]] (XRCO) and [[AVN (magazine)|Adult Video News (AVN)]] Halls of Fame.<ref name="xrcohof" /><ref name="avnhof" />

Jameson founded the adult-entertainment company [[ClubJenna]] in 2000 with [[Jay Grdina]], whom she later married and divorced. Initially, a single website, this business expanded into managing similar websites of other stars and began producing sexually explicit videos in 2001. The first such movie, ''[[Briana Loves Jenna]]'' (with [[Briana Banks]]), was named at the 2003 [[AVN Award]]s as the best-selling and best-renting pornographic title for 2002.<ref name="Papermag" /> By 2005, ClubJenna had revenues of US$30&nbsp;million with profits estimated at half that.<ref name="Forbes" /> Advertisements for her site and films, often bearing her picture, have towered on a 48-foot-tall billboard in New York City's [[Times Square]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Steve|title=Jenna Jameson Promotes Web Site With Times Square Billboard|url=http://www.adrants.com/2003/08/jenna-jameson-promotes-web-site-with.php|work=AdRANTs.com|access-date=April 26, 2014|date=August 20, 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908041611/http://www.nydailynews.com/08-20-2003/news/story/110556p-99889c.html|archive-date=September 8, 2008|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Jameson has also crossed over into mainstream pop culture, starting with a minor role in [[Howard Stern]]'s 1997 film ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]''.<ref name="WallStreetJournal" /> Her mainstream appearances continued with several guest-hosting and guest-starring on various television programs. [[Playboy TV]] hosted her ''[[Jenna's American Sex Star]]'' reality show, in which aspiring porn stars competed for a ClubJenna contract.<ref name="gamejss" /> Her 2004 autobiography, ''[[How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale]]'', spent six weeks on [[New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref name="Forbes" />

Jameson announced her retirement from pornography at the 2008 [[AVN Award]]s, stating that she would never return to the industry.<ref name="Eby 2013"/> Although she no longer performs in pornographic films, she has been working as a [[webcam model]] since 2013.<ref name=CNBC2014/>

== Early life ==
Jenna Marie Massoli was born on April 9, 1974,<ref name="ETHS-Bio" /> in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Nevada. Her father, Laurence Henry Massoli, was a police officer at the [[Las Vegas Sheriff's Department]] and program director for [[KSNV-DT]]. Her mother, Judith Brooke Hunt, was a Las Vegas showgirl who danced in the [[Folies Bergère]] show at the [[Tropicana Resort & Casino]].<ref name="NYTimes"/><ref name="ReviewJournal"/> Her mother died of [[melanoma]] on February 20, 1976, two months before her daughter's second birthday.<ref name="ETHS"/> The cancer treatments bankrupted the family and they relocated in Nevada, Arizona and Montana, usually living in a trailer home or with her paternal grandmother. She and her older brother Tony were raised Catholic,<ref name="Higginbotham"/><ref name=OraTV>{{cite web|url=http://www.ora.tv/larrykingnow/jenna-jameson-0_0bkkl6pa|title=Jenna Jameson|work=Ora TV|access-date=October 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030084135/http://www.ora.tv/larrykingnow/jenna-jameson-0_0bkkl6pa|archive-date=October 30, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> though they were essentially left to parent each other.<ref>[http://www.biography.com/people/jenna-jameson-381220#synopsis "Jenna Jameson Biography"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211222334/http://www.biography.com/people/jenna-jameson-381220#synopsis |date=February 11, 2015 }}. [[FYI (American TV channel)|bio.]]. Retrieved December 13, 2016.</ref>

Jameson was a frequent entrant in [[Beauty contest|beauty pageants]] as a child and enrolled in ballet classes throughout her childhood.<ref name="AskMen"/> In a featurette on the ''[[Zombie Strippers]]'' DVD, Jameson indicates she trained in dance for fifteen years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Jameson wrote in her autobiography that in October 1990, when she was 16 years old and while the family was living on a cattle ranch in [[Fromberg, Montana]], she was beaten with rocks and gang raped by four boys after a [[American football|football]] game at Fromberg High School. The incident began after she attempted to hitchhike home and that she entered the car of the four boys while believing that she would be driven to her home. She reported being raped a second time while still 16 by "Preacher", her boyfriend Jack's biker uncle.<ref name="Higginbotham"/> Preacher has denied the rape ever occurred.<ref name="CNN"/> Rather than tell her father, she left home and moved in with Jack in her first serious relationship.<ref name="ETHS"/><ref name="January"/>

Jack was a tattoo artist and gave her the first of a series of tattoos, one of which would become her trademark tattoo, two hearts on her right buttock.<ref name="Forbes" /> According to [[E!]], her brother Tony, who later owned a tattoo parlor himself,<ref name="NYTimes"/> added the inscription "Heart Breaker".<ref name="NYTimes"/><ref name="ETHS"/>

== Career ==

=== Early ===
She tried to follow in her mother's career as a Las Vegas showgirl, but most shows rejected her for not having the then-typical height of {{convert|5|ft|8|in|cm}}.<ref name="Papermag" /><ref name="ReviewJournalShowgirls" /> She was hired at [[Disneyland Resort]],<ref name="NYTimes" /> but left after two months stating concerns over the schedule and salary.<ref name="January" />

Her boyfriend Jack encouraged her to apply for jobs as a dancer,<ref name="Grigoriadis" /> and in 1991, though underage, she began dancing in Las Vegas [[strip club]]s using a fake identification.<ref name="ETHS" /><ref name="AskMen" /> After she was rejected from the [[Crazy Horse Too]] strip club because of her orthodontia, she removed her braces with pliers and was accepted.<ref name="Forbes" /> After six months, she was earning US$2,000 per night, before graduating from [[Bonanza High School]].<ref name="ETHS" />

Her first stage name as a dancer was "Jennasis",<ref name="ReviewJournal" /> which she later used as the name of a business that she incorporated ("Jennasis Killing Co.").<ref name="WIPO" />  As for picking her permanent professional name, she said, "I had to come up with a good name.  I didn't want a porno name.  So I sat down, opened up the phone book and thumbed to the J's, cause I wanted it to match my first name."  She saw 'James', but rejected "Jenna James" because it "sounds too porno".  Right under that was 'Jameson' which struck her as being the name of [[Jameson Irish Whiskey|the whiskey]] she likes and thought "Ok, that's perfect."  That night at work she saw her brother and asked him what he thought of the name "Jenna Jameson".  He said, "I'm drinking Jameson right now."  And the name stuck after that.<ref name="ETHS" /><ref>Info and quotes are from her first-person account in her ''E! True Hollywood Stories'' episode (roughly at the 22min point)</ref><ref name="Metacafe" />

Besides dancing, starting later in 1991, she posed for nude photographs for photographer [[Suze Randall]] in Los Angeles, with the intention of getting into ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''.<ref name="January" />{{sfn|Jameson|Strauss|2003|pp=99–107}} After her photos had appeared in several men's magazines under various names, she then stopped working for Randall, feeling Randall was "a shark".<ref name="SalonBookReview" />

While in high school, she began taking drugs&nbsp;– [[cocaine]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], and [[methamphetamine]]&nbsp;– accompanied by her brother (who was addicted to [[heroin]]<ref name="NYTimes" />) and at times her father.<ref name="Higginbotham" /> Her addiction worsened during her four years with her boyfriend. She eventually stopped eating properly and became too thin to model; Jack left her in 1994. She weighed {{convert|76|lb|kg}}<ref name="PsychiatricServices" /> when a friend put her in a wheelchair and sent her to her father, who was then living in [[Redding, California]], in order to detox; her father did not recognize her when she got off the plane.<ref name="Higginbotham" />

Jameson says that she started acting in sex videos in retaliation for the infidelity of her boyfriend, Jack.<ref name="Forbes" /><ref name="January" /> She first appeared in an erotic film in 1993, a non-explicit [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] movie by [[Andrew Blake (director)|Andrew Blake]],{{sfn|Jameson|Strauss|2003|pp=132–135}} with girlfriend [[Nikki Tyler]].<ref name="Papermag" /> Her first pornographic movie scenes were filmed by [[Randy West (actor)|Randy West]] and appeared in 1994's ''Up and Cummers 10'' and ''Up and Cummers 11''.<ref name="AskMen" /><ref name="RandyWest" /> She quickly achieved notice and appeared in several other pornographic films while still living in Las Vegas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Of her first adult movie, Randy West said "Jenna contacted me and said she wanted to get into the XXX business, but her agent didn't want her to do porn. A month later I'm on a shoot in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]] [a [[San Fernando Valley]] section of Los Angeles], and there's Jenna. She said she wanted to get into the business, despite what her agent said. I told her if you want to just do a girl/girl scene, we can do that. She said she wanted to work with [[Kylie Ireland]], so I set it up. When the sex started, she just fucking rocked! I knew Jenna was special right off the bat. I figured she'd be the next [[Ginger Lynn]], but nobody had any idea she was going to be as big as she turned out to be. Jenna told me when we first met that she was going to be a star."<ref name="Hustler" />

Jameson got her first [[breast implant]]s on July 28, 1994, to enhance her stripping and movie careers.{{sfn|Jameson|Strauss|2003|pp=169–170}} By 2004, she had had two different sets of breast implants and a chin implant.<ref name="NYTimes" /><ref name="Star" />

Jameson's first adult video appearances were [[lesbian]] scenes (a common way that female performers ease into the business). She says: "Girl-on-girl was easy and natural. Then they offered me lots of money to do boy-girl."<ref name="Papermag" /> Her first heterosexual scene was in ''Up and Cummers 11'' (1994).{{sfn|Jameson|Strauss|2003|pp=137–158}} At the beginning of her career, she promised herself that she would never do [[anal sex]] or [[List of sex positions#Multiple penetration|double penetration]] scenes on film.<ref name="Grigoriadis" /> Instead, her "signature move" was [[oral sex]], lubricated with [[saliva]].<ref name="AskMenInterview" /><ref name="Salon2" /> She has also never done any [[interracial pornography|interracial sex scenes]] with men (despite that category's runaway popularity during the 2000s).<ref name="Bridge" /> When asked about this on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' on February 8, 2008, she said that she was not necessarily opposed to doing so; rather, "it never really came up", as there were few black men working in porn when she started, and none of them worked [exclusively] for the same company [as] she did.<ref name="howardstern February 6, 2008" />

In 1994, after overcoming her drug addiction by spending several weeks with her father and grandmother, Jameson relocated to Los Angeles to live with Nikki Tyler.{{sfn|Jameson|Strauss|2003|pp=309–311}} Her first movie after that was ''Silk Stockings''.{{sfn|Jameson|Strauss|2003|pp=316–320}} Later in 1995, [[Wicked Pictures]], a then small pornographic film production company, signed her to an exclusive contract.<ref name="Forbes" />{{sfn|Jameson|Strauss|2003|pp=341–351}} She remembers telling Wicked Pictures founder Steve Orenstein: "The most important thing to me right now is to become the biggest star the industry has ever seen."<ref name="Higginbotham" /><ref name="SalonBookReview" />

The contract earned Jameson US$6,000 for each of eight movies in her first year.<ref name="ETHS" /> Her first big-budget production was ''Blue Movie'' (1995), where she played a reporter investigating a porn set; it won multiple [[AVN Award]]s.<ref name="AskMen" /> In 1996, Jameson won top awards from three major industry organizations, the XRCO Best New Starlet award, the AVN Best New Starlet Award, and the [[Fans of X-Rated Entertainment|Fans of X-Rated Entertainment (F.O.X.E.)]] Video Vixen award. She was the first entertainer to win all three awards.<ref name="AskMen" /> A stream of [[#Awards|other awards]] followed.

By 2001, Jameson earned $60,000 for a day and a half of filming a single DVD, and $8,000 per night dancing at strip clubs. She tried to restrict herself to five films per year and two weeks of dancing per month.<ref name="Salon1" /> Her husband Jay Grdina has said that she earned as much as $25,000 per night dancing.<ref name="WallStreetJournal" />

Between 2005 and 2006, she hosted [[Playboy TV]]'s ''[[Jenna's American Sex Star]]'', where prospective porn stars compete in sexual performances for a contract with her company, ClubJenna. Winners of the contracts for the first two years were Brea Bennett and Roxy Jezel.<ref name="AmericanSexStar" />

In August 2007, Jameson had her breast implants removed, reducing her from a D to a C cup; she also said she was finished with appearing on camera in pornographic films, though she would continue running ClubJenna, which was grossing $30&nbsp;million per year.<ref name="UsWeekly20070822"/> In January 2008, Jameson confirmed she was retiring from pornographic performances<ref name="XFanz2008"/> and has since said that she "won't even do a ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' cover".<ref name=HuffingtonPost/>

[[File:Jenna Jameson 2 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Jameson in March 2008]]

Jameson's first appearance at an adult-entertainment event since her retirement was at the 2013 [[Exxxotica]] [[New Jersey]] convention in October.<ref name="Exxxotica"/> The following month, she returned to the adult industry as a [[webcam model]].<ref name="Toronto Sun 2013"/> On January 15, 2014, [[Fleshlight]] released Jameson's signature [[artificial vagina]].<ref name="Rodriguez 2014"/> Jameson was also the [[master of ceremonies]] for the 2014 [[XBIZ Award]]s on January 24.<ref name="Miller 2013"/>

=== Business ventures ===
Jameson and Grdina formed '''ClubJenna''' as an Internet pornography company in 2000. ClubJenna.com was one of the first pornographic sites to provide more than pictures and videos; it provided explicit diaries, relationship advice, and even stock tips to paid members. The site reportedly was profitable in its third week. The business later diversified into multimedia pornographic entertainment, first by administering other porn stars' websites, then, in 2001, by the production of pornographic films.<ref name="Forbes" />

Early ClubJenna films starred Jameson herself, limiting herself to on-screen sex with other women or with Grdina, who appeared as Justin Sterling. The first ClubJenna film, ''[[Briana Loves Jenna]]'' (2001), co-produced with Vivid, cost US$280,000 to make, and grossed over $1&nbsp;million in its first year. It was the best selling and best-renting pornographic title of its year, winning twin AVN Awards.<ref name="Forbes" /><ref name="JJJBio" /> It was marketed as "Jenna. Her first boy/girl scene in over 2 years." referring to Jameson's abstention from heterosexual on-film intercourse. Grdina has said that Jameson's films averaged sales of 100,000 copies, compared with run-of-the-mill pornographic films, which did well to sell 5,000. On the other hand, he also said that their films took up to twelve days to film, compared with one day for other pornographic films.<ref name="WallStreetJournal" />

In a January 2009 interview with [[William Shatner]] on ''[[Shatner's Raw Nerve]]'', Jameson said she came close to buying ''Penthouse'' magazine when publisher [[Bob Guccione]] filed for Chapter 11 reorganization of his business (which occurred in August 2003), but was thwarted when someone else swooped in and bought up all the stock.<ref name="Raw Nerve" /> ''[[New York Magazine]]'''s ''Intelligencer'' quoted a source from Penthouse as saying "I'm sure she is considering it", adding that Jameson was to be cover girl in January 2004 – and "it's a really wild-looking shoot, even for a porn star."<ref name="nymag n_9524" />

In 2004, the ClubJenna films expanded to starring other actresses without Jameson – Krystal Steal, Jesse Capelli, McKenzie Lee, Ashton Moore and Sophia Rossi – as Jameson stepped back from starring roles.<ref name="Forbes" /> In 2005 Jameson first directed a film, ''The Provocateur'', released as ''Jenna's Provocateur'' in September 2006.<ref name="AVN" /> The ClubJenna films were distributed and marketed by [[Vivid Entertainment]], which ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine once called "the world's largest adult film company".<ref name="Forbes" /> They made up a third of ClubJenna's revenues, but over half of the profits.<ref name="Forbes" />

ClubJenna was run as a family business, with Grdina's sister, Kris, as vice president in charge of merchandising.<ref name="NYTimes" /><ref name="Hoovers" /> In 2005, ClubJenna had estimated revenues of $30&nbsp;million, with profits of about half that.<ref name="Forbes" />

Jameson also capitalized on merchandising herself. Since May 2003, she has been appearing on a {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=on}} tall billboard in New York City's [[Times Square]] promoting her web site and movies.<ref name="NYTimes" /><ref name="JJJBio" /> The first advertisement displayed her wearing only a thong and read "Who Says They Cleaned Up Times Square?"<ref name="Adrants" /><ref name="NYDailyNews" /> There is a line of [[sex toy]]s licensed to [[Doc Johnson]], and an "anatomically correct" Jenna Jameson [[action figure]].<ref name="Forbes" /><ref name="Higginbotham" /> She stars in her own [[Adult video games|sex simulation video game]], ''Virtually Jenna'', in which the goal is to bring a 3D model of her to orgasm.<ref name="VirtuallyJenna" /><ref name="Wired" /> Y-Tell, ClubJenna's wireless company, sells Jenna Jameson "moan tones" (telephone ringtones), chat services, and games in partnerships with 20 carriers around the world, mostly in Europe and South America.<ref name="Forbes" /> In 2006, New York City-based Wicked Cow Entertainment started to expand her brand to barware, perfume, handbags, lingerie, and footwear, sold through high end retailers such as [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] and [[Colette (boutique)|Colette]] boutiques.<ref name="Brandweek" /> Her film and merchandising success enabled her to attain her goal of becoming the top porn star in the world.<ref name="Oprah" />

In August 2005, ClubJenna launched Club Thrust, an interactive website for Jameson's gay male fans, which includes videos, galleries, sex advice, gossip, and downloads. The director of webmaster relations for ClubJenna said the straight site had always had a lot of gay traffic.<ref name="AVNClubThrust" /><ref name="Times" /> By 2006, ClubJenna administered more than 150 official sites for other adult entertainment industry stars.<ref name="Hoovers" />

In August 2005, a group of business investors that included Jameson purchased Babes Cabaret, a [[strip club]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], intending to make it the first foray of ClubJenna into live entertainment.<ref name="East Valley Tribune" /> Soon after the purchase attracted attention, the Scottsdale City Council proposed a new ordinance banning nudity at adult-entertainment venues and requiring a four-foot divider restricting contact with dancers. Such a divider would have also effectively banned [[lap dance]]s, the dancers' main source of revenue.<ref name="Economist" /><ref name="SFGate" /> Jameson argued strongly against the ordinance, and helped organize a petition against it. On September 12, 2006, in a [[referendum]] on the ordinance, voters struck down the stricter rules, allowing the club to continue to operate as before.<ref name="AboutPhoenix" />

On February 3, 2006, Jameson hosted a "Vivid ClubJenna Super Bowl Party" with several other ClubJenna and [[Vivid Girls]] at the Zoo Club in [[Detroit]], Michigan for a $500 to $1,000 ticket price.<ref name="VividClubjennaBowl" /> It featured a lingerie show, but no planned nudity or sex acts.<ref name="UPI2" /> When first announced, the party caused controversy with the [[National Football League]], which did not sanction this as an official [[Super Bowl]] event.<ref name="WashingtonPost2" /> For 2007, Jameson signed up to play quarterback in the [[Legends Cup (LFL)|Lingerie Bowl]], but retired due to her insurance company's damage concerns. She instead acted as commentator.<ref name="SportsIllustrated" />

On June 22, 2006, [[Playboy Enterprises]] announced that it had bought ClubJenna Inc., along with an agreement to have both Jameson and Grdina stay on as contracted executives. Playboy CEO [[Christie Hefner]] said that she expected to rapidly increase film production, producing about thirty features in the first year, and will expand the way they are sold, not only as DVDs but through TV channels, video-on-demand services, and mobile phones.<ref name="MarketWatch" /> On November 1, 2006, Playboy renamed one of the [[Spice Network]]'s [[pay-per-view]] channels from The Hot Network to ClubJenna.<ref name="AVNOct2006" />

In April 2007, [[Tera Patrick]] and her production company Teravision filed a lawsuit against Jameson and Playboy Enterprises for failing to properly account for and pay royalties on revenue earned by Patrick's website, clubtera.com.<ref name="nypost April 28, 2007" />

=== Books ===

Jameson's autobiography, ''[[How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale]]'' was published in 2004. It was co-written with [[Neil Strauss]], a contributor to ''The New York Times'' and ''Rolling Stone'', and published by [[ReganBooks]], a division of [[HarperCollins]]. It was an instant bestseller, spending six weeks on [[New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref name="Forbes" /> The autobiography also won the 2004 "Mainstream's Adult Media Favorite" [[XRCO Award]] in a tie with [[Seymore Butts]]'s ''[[Family Business (American TV series)|Family Business]]'' TV series. It was translated into German as ''Pornostar. Die Autobiographie'' in November 2005,<ref name="AutobioDE" /> and Spanish as ''Cómo Hacer El Amor Igual Que Una Estrella Porno'' in January 2006.<ref name="AutobioSP" />

The book covers her early career from her beginning in show business living with her tattoo artist boyfriend, through receiving the Pornographic [[Hot d'Or]] award at [[Cannes]], and wedding pictures from her second marriage.<ref name="NYTBookReview" /> It does not omit sordid details, describing her two rapes, drug addictions, an unhappy first marriage, and numerous affairs with men and women.<ref name="SalonBookReview " /> The first-person narrative is broken up by personal photos, childhood diary entries, family interviews, movie [[Screenplay|scripts]], and [[Comics|comic panels]].<ref name="Reuters" />

The autobiography publisher, [[Judith Regan]], also served as executive producer of a [[tie-in]] television news special, ''Jenna Jameson's Confessions'',<ref name="Confessions" /> airing on [[VH1]] on August 16, 2004, one day before the book's launch.<ref name="ConfessionsAiring" /> In April 2005, ReganBooks and Jameson filed lawsuits against each other. The point of contention was a proposed reality show about Jameson's everyday life, discussed between her then-husband, Jay Grdina, and the [[A&E Network]]. ReganBooks maintained that any A&E deal was a breach of Jameson's contract, which indicated that ReganBooks had a stake in the profits generated by both the special based on her memoir and a reality-based series, as well as "any similar projects".<ref name="CNNMoney" /> Jameson's suit claimed that the A&E deal preceded the ReganBooks contract.<ref name="EOnline" /> The reality series had still not materialized, and the lawsuit was still being discussed, when HarperCollins fired Judith Regan on December 15, 2006, over an unrelated issue.<ref name="NYTimesRegan" />

In January 2007, Jameson was reported in talks with producers on turning the autobiography into a movie. In March 2007, Jameson was reportedly missing meetings with producers, thus endangering the movie, due to problems with a recent [[vaginoplasty]].<ref name="NYDailyNews20070330" /><ref name="Boston Globe 2007" />

In April 2013, Jameson announced she was working on a fictional [[erotic novel]] called ''Sugar''. It was co-written with Hope Tarr and published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]]. It was released on October 21, 2013.<ref name="Johnson 2013"/>

==== Controversial mainstream appearances ====
Some of her mainstream appearances sparked controversy. An interview with Jameson contained in the 1999 [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] ''[[A&F Quarterly]]'' was part of the motivation for Michigan Attorney General [[Jennifer Granholm]] and Illinois Lieutenant Governor [[Corinne Wood]] to speak out against the hybrid magazine-catalog.<ref name="BaltimoreSun1999" /> The campaign was joined by parents and Christian [[American conservatism|conservative]] groups, and got the ''Quarterly'' removed from shelves and eventually canceled in 2003.<ref name="ChicagoSunTimes2003" />

In November 2001, the [[Oxford Union]] debating society invited Jameson to come to [[Oxford]] to argue against the proposition "The House Believes that Porn is Harmful."<ref name="AskMenInterview" /> She wrote in her diary at the time, "I feel like I am going to be out of my element, but, I could never pass this chance up&nbsp;... it's a once in a lifetime thing."<ref name="JJDiary" /> In the end, her side won the debate 204 to 27.<ref name="Papermag" />

In February 2003, [[Pony International]] planned to feature her as one of several pornographic actors in advertisements for [[athletic shoes]]. This was attacked by [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] of [[Fox News]] in an editorial called "Using Quasi-Prostitutes to Sell Sneakers", calling pornographic actors inappropriate role models for teens.<ref name="OReilly" /> In response, ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' proposed a boycott of O'Reilly and Fox News.<ref name="HarvardCrimson" /> Jameson herself sent a sarcastic email to the show, writing:
{{bq|text=I hope Bill understands the difference between a porn star and a hooker. I assume he has done some research on the subject because he requested some of my videos after we finished taping my appearance. I imagine he wanted them for professional reasons.<ref name="Slate" />

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships and health ===
[[File:Jenna Jameson and Jay Grdina.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Jameson with former husband [[Jay Grdina]], at the [[XBIZ Award]]s in November 2005]]

In 2004 Jameson stated that she was bisexual, and that she had had sex with 100 women and 30 men off-screen in her life,<ref name="Grigoriadis" /> but by 2008 she described herself as "totally hetero".<ref name="foxnews May 29, 2008" /> She has stated the best relationship she ever had was her lesbian relationship with porn actress [[Nikki Tyler]], which she documents in her autobiography. They lived together at the start of her porn career and again before her second marriage.<ref name="Papermag" /><ref name="AskMen" /> Famous boyfriends discussed in her autobiography include [[Marilyn Manson]]<ref name="SeattleWeekly" /> and [[Tommy Lee]].<ref name="ETHS" /><ref name="Papermag" /><ref name="Bridge" />

On December 20, 1996, Jameson married porn star/Wicked Pictures director [[Brad Armstrong (director)|Brad Armstrong]].<ref name="ETHS" /><ref name="AskMen" /> The marriage lasted just 10 weeks. Although they informally separated in March 1997, she remained contractually obligated to work on Wicked Pictures projects involving both of them. They legally separated and divorced in March 2001, after Brad discovered her sexual affair with Jorge Araya Montoya (whom she met on a visit to [[Costa Rica]]).<ref name="ETHS" />

Jameson met former pornographic studio owner [[Jay Grdina]],<ref name="Hoovers" /> scion of a wealthy cattle-ranching family, who had entered pornographic film production after college.<ref name="Forbes" />{{sfn|Jameson|Strauss|2003|p=498}} From 1998 until Jameson's retirement, Grdina was Jameson's only on-screen male sex partner, acting under the name Justin Sterling. They were engaged in December 2000, well before her divorce from Armstrong,<ref name="ETHS" /> and married June 22, 2003.<ref name="NYTimes" /> They tried to have children from mid-2004 onwards, as Jameson had planned to retire from adult entertainment upon becoming a mother.<ref name="Forbes" /><ref name="Grigoriadis" /><ref name="Cooper" /> The couple resided in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], in a {{convert|6700|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture|Spanish-style]] mansion, bought for $2 million in 2002.<ref name="NYTimes" />

In November 2004, Jameson was diagnosed with skin cancer. Though surgery removed it, she [[miscarriage|miscarried]] shortly after the diagnosis. She was unable to conceive again with Grdina, even with [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]]. Jameson said the in vitro process "wasn't a good thing for me"; she gained weight and did not get pregnant. According to Jameson, the stresses of cancer plus infertility led to her marriage's collapse.<ref name="UsWeekly" /> In August 2006, ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]'' magazine and [[TMZ.com]] confirmed with Jameson's publicist that she and Grdina had separated.<ref name="Star0608" /><ref name="TMZ" />

In October 2006, it was reported that Jameson began dating [[Mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] and former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] champion [[Tito Ortiz]],<ref name="TampaTribune" /> whom she met on [[Myspace]].<ref name="USPreg" /> Ortiz canceled a November 12, 2006 appearance as the guest of honor at the [[United States Marine Corps]] birthday ball at the [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar]] in San Diego, when the Corps refused to let him bring Jameson as his guest.<ref name="MarineCorpsTimes" /><ref name="NYPost" /> On November 30, 2006, in an interview on ''The Howard Stern Show'', Ortiz stated that he was in love with Jameson, that she was no longer acting in pornography, and that they were in a monogamous relationship.<ref name="HowardStern" /> On December 12, 2006, Jameson filed for divorce from Grdina.<ref name="UPI" /> She introduced Ortiz and talked about their relationship at the 2008 AVN Adult Movie Awards while she was presenting an award. She also made brief appearances on two episodes of ''[[The Apprentice (American season 7)|The Celebrity Apprentice]]'' to help Ortiz on the tasks assigned in those episodes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Jameson announced in August 2008 that she and Ortiz were expecting twins in April 2009.<ref name="themoneytimes September 23, 2008" /> On March 16, 2009, Jameson gave birth to twin boys, Jesse Jameson and Journey Jette.<ref name="twins" /><ref name="azcentral March 19, 2009" /> Jameson and Ortiz split up in March 2013.

In a 2014 interview with ''LA Weekly'', Markham claimed that Jameson would make requests for drugs. Markham posited that the pills of choice were [[Alprazolam|Xanax]], [[Zolpidem|Ambien]] and [[Buprenorphine/naloxone|Suboxone]] along with alcohol. At the same time, Markham denied that Jameson had been taking [[Oxycodone]], in spite of previous rumors. Markham stated that she was assaulted and battered by Jameson following an incident in a hair salon in Los Angeles in 2013 when Jameson punched Markham in the stomach with a [[brass knuckles]] iPhone case.

=== Legal issues ===
On April 26, 2010, Jameson's then-boyfriend, [[Tito Ortiz]] was arrested for felony domestic abuse at the couple's [[Huntington Beach, California]] home.<ref name="bandage" /> Jameson was photographed afterward that day with a bandaged arm,<ref name="bandage" /> amid accusations by both parties against each other, with Ortiz accusing Jameson of being erratic and addicted to [[OxyContin]], while she alleged that he was abusive. Since the incident occurred, both parties have recanted these allegations that were made toward one another, though as of April 29, 2010, the investigation by the police department remained open.<ref name="eonline April 29, 2010" />

On May 25, 2012, Jameson was arrested in [[Westminster, California]] and charged with three [[misdemeanor]] counts for [[driving under the influence]] of alcohol or other drugs, driving with a [[blood-alcohol level]] over the state legal limit, and driving on a suspended license after her [[Range Rover]] struck a light pole.
