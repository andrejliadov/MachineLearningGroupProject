==Exhibitions==
===Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum===
Cattelan created the toilet in 2016 for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in [[New York City]]. It was made in a foundry in Florence, cast in several parts that were welded together.  Made to look like the museum's other [[Kohler Co.|Kohler]] toilets, it was installed in one of the museum's bathrooms for visitors to use.<ref name="The Guardian 16 September 2016">{{cite news|last1=Gabbatt|first1=Adam|title=On the throne: what it's like to use the Guggenheim's solid gold toilet|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/sep/16/gold-toilet-guggenheim-america-maurizio-cattelan|accessdate=25 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=16 September 2016|language=en}}</ref><ref name="auto2">{{cite news |title=Golden, Going Gone: 18-Karat Gold Toilet Is Stolen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/world/europe/golden-going-gone-18-karat-gold-toilet-is-stolen.html |accessdate=19 September 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=14 September 2019}}</ref> A special cleaning routine was put in place.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tomking |first1=Calvin |title=Gold Toilet |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/gold-toilet |accessdate=16 September 2019 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=14 September 2016}}</ref> The museum stated that the work was paid for with private funds.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Randy |title=Duchamp, Eat Your Heart Out: The Guggenheim Is Installing a Gold Toilet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/arts/design/duchamp-eat-your-heart-out-the-guggenheim-is-installing-a-gold-toilet.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article |accessdate=17 February 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=19 April 2016}}</ref>

According to the museum, over 100,000 people waited in line to use ''America'', which was guarded by a security guard posted outside the bathroom. According to Cattelan, the work was made of {{convert|103|kg}} of gold, which in September 2019 was valued at more than four million dollars as bullion.<ref name="auto2"/><ref name="Washington Post 25 January 2018">{{cite news|last1=Schwartzman|first1=Paul|title=The White House asked to borrow a van Gogh.

In September 2017, when the museum declined a [[White House]] request to loan its 1888 [[Van Gogh]] painting ''[[Landscape with Snow]]'' for President [[Donald Trump]]'s private rooms, curator [[Nancy Spector]] offered to loan ''America'' instead. Any reply by the White House was not reported.<ref name="Washington Post 25 January 2018" />

===Blenheim Palace===
In September 2019, ''America'' was installed at [[Blenheim Palace]] in the United Kingdom, where it was available for use as part of an exhibition of Cattelan's works.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/03/flushed-with-success-solid-gold-toilet-to-be-installed-at-blenheim|title=Flushed with success: solid-gold toilet to be installed at Blenheim|first=Mark |last=Brown|date=May 3, 2019|work=The Guardian}}</ref> It was placed in a water closet formerly used by [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Maurizio Cattelan Has Installed His Golden Toilet in the Stately Bathroom Where Winston Churchill Once Sat |url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/maurizio-cattelan-blenheim-palace-1649932 |accessdate=15 September 2019 |work=artnet News |date=13 September 2019}}</ref> 
{{wikinews|Arrests made in theft of gold toilet in England}}
On 14 September, the sculpture was stolen. A representative of Blenheim had earlier commented that because ''America'' was plumbed in, and potential thieves would be aware of its use, security was not much of an issue.<ref>{{cite news |title=Busted flush: gold toilet reportedly stolen from Blenheim Palace |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/14/gold-toilet-reportedly-stolen-blenheim-palace-cattelan |accessdate=14 September 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=14 September 2019}}</ref> Because it had been connected to the building's water pipes, the theft caused structural damage and flooding to the [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite news |author1=Emily Dixon |author2=Augusta Anthony |title=Solid gold toilet stolen from Blenheim Palace |url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/uk-blenheim-palace-gold-toilet-scli-gbr-intl/index.html |accessdate=15 September 2019 |work=CNN Style |date=14 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Golden toilet worth £1m stolen from Churchill ancestral home |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/golden-toilet-burglary-stolen-blenheim-palace-churchill-cattelan-a9105316.html |accessdate=23 September 2019 |work=The Independent |date=14 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Two men were arrested and released in connection with the incident.<ref>{{cite news |title=Second man arrested over solid gold toilet theft |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-49732289 |accessdate=21 September 2019 |publisher=BBC |date=17 September 2019}}</ref> Cattelan commented: "I always liked [[Heist film|heist movies]] and finally I'm in one of them."<ref>{{cite news |title=Artist behind £4.8m gold toilet praises thieves who have taken it |url=https://news.sky.com/story/solid-gold-toilet-stolen-from-winston-chuchill-birthplace-blenheim-palace-11809266 |accessdate=15 September 2019 |work=Sky News |language=en}}</ref>

Blenheim's insurance company has stated that up to approximately $124,000 can be paid in reward for the return of the toilet. In mid-October, three new arrests were made in connection to the theft.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stolen gold toilet insurer offers £100k reward |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-49906663 |accessdate=11 November 2019 |publisher=BBC |date=2 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Guy |first1=Jack |title=Three new arrests in the case of the stolen gold toilet |url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/gold-toilet-arrests-scli-intl/index.html |accessdate=11 November 2019 |work=CNN Style |date=16 October 2019 |language=en}}</ref> By November, the total number of arrests was six, all of whom have been released without charge. Speculation about the fate of the toilet includes it being melted down, that it has been hidden fairly close to Blenheim and that the theft is a prank by Cattelan. Local imitations of the work have been made, including one that was itself stolen.<ref name="auto3">{{cite news |last1=Marshall |first1=Alex |title=What Happened to the Stolen Gold Toilet? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/arts/design/gold-toilet-america.html |accessdate=17 February 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=20 November 2019}}</ref>

==Interpretation==
The Guggenheim museum linked the meaning of the sculpture to the career of Donald Trump, writing in September 2016<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last1=Dover|first1=Caitlin|title=Game of Throne: Maurizio Cattelan's "America" Comes to the Guggenheim|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/blogs/checklist/game-of-throne-maurizio-cattelans-america-comes-to-the-guggenheim|website=Guggenheim|accessdate=25 January 2018|date=15 September 2016}}</ref> that "the aesthetics of this 'throne' recall nothing so much as the gilded excess of Trump's real-estate ventures and private residences".<ref name="The Guardian 16 September 2016" /> Cattelan himself declined to give an interpretation of his work, which he conceived before Trump's presidential candidacy.<ref name="Washington Post 25 January 2018" /> He said that the connection to Trump is "another layer, but it shouldn’t be the only one."<ref name="auto"/>

The work has also been described as an interpretation of [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s 1917 sculpture ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carrier |first1=David |authorlink=David Carrier|title=Aesthetic Theory, Abstract Art, and Lawrence Carroll |date=2018 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=9781350009578 |pages=64 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dQ5kDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA64 |accessdate=15 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Art critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]], using the work at Blenheim Palace, opined that it felt "Much like peeing on porcelain. But here, among all the photos of young Winston, it also feels like pissing on British history." He also found the sculpture reminiscent of prime minister [[Boris Johnson]]'s hair.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Jones (journalist)|title=Hitler in Churchill's birthplace more shocking than the golden toilet – Maurizio Cattelan review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/13/maurizio-cattelan-blenheim-palace-review-hitler-golden-toilet-blenheim-churchill |accessdate=21 September 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=13 September 2019}}</ref>

==Other gold toilets==
In 2002 Winger Lam Sai-wing, a [[Hong Kong]] businessman, included two gold toilets in what he called a shrine to [[Lenin]]. He referred to a comment by Lenin{{efn|"When we are victorious on a world scale I think we shall use gold for the purpose of building public lavatories in the streets of some of the largest cities of the world."<ref>{{cite web |title=The Importance Of Gold Now And After The Complete Victory Of Socialism |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1921/nov/05.htm |website=www.marxists.org |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |accessdate=21 February 2020}}</ref>}} about the use of gold after the victory of socialism.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hong Kong gold toilet shrine to Lenin a 'dream come true' |url=https://www.scmp.com/article/375029/going-gold |accessdate=11 November 2019 |work=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=2002 |language=en}}</ref>

In 2019 the Hong Kong jewellery firm Coronet displayed a gold toilet in Shanghai. This toilet had a seat made of bulletproof glass containing  more than 40,000 small diamonds.<ref>{{cite news |title=A lot of people can 'enjoy' this $1.3 million diamond studded gold toilet — but in a museum |url=https://www.businessinsider.in/international/news/a-lot-of-people-can-enjoy-this-1-3-million-diamond-studded-gold-toilet-but-in-a-museum/articleshow/71953492.cms |accessdate=11 November 2019 |work=[[Business Insider]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Gold toilet worth $1.3 mn has over 40,000 diamonds in its seat |url=https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/rest-of-the-world-news/gold-toilet-worth-1-dollars-3-cents-mn-has-over-40000-diamonds-in-its-seat.html |accessdate=11 November 2019 |work=[[Republic World]]}}</ref>
