{{short description|Terms used in medicine and psychiatry}}
The '''classification of transsexual people''' and people with other gender atypicalities has been done since the mid-1960s.  In medicine and psychiatry, terms such as ''[[heterosexual]]'' and ''[[homosexual]]'' have been based on a person's [[sex assignment]] at birth, which has prompted the increased use of [[Androphilia and gynephilia|''androphilia'' and ''gynephilia'']] to avoid terminological confusion and bias. In social, political and medical contexts, the classification is often relative to one's [[gender identity|desired sex]].

==Sex Orientation Scale (1966) ==
[[Harry Benjamin]] created the Sex Orientation Scale (SOS) to classify and understand various forms and subtypes of [[transvestism]] and [[transsexualism]] in biological males.<ref name=Benjamin1966>Benjamin, H. (1966). ''The Transsexual Phenomenon.'' New York: The Julian Press, page 22.</ref> It was a seven-point scale with three types of transvestism, three types of transsexualism, and one category for typical males.  Benjamin's Scale references and uses the [[Kinsey scale]] in distinguishing between "true transsexualism" and "transvestism".

Benjamin noted, "It must be emphasized again that the remaining six types are not and never can be sharply separated."<ref name=Benjamin1966/> Benjamin added a caveat: "It has been the intention here to point out the possibility of several conceptions and classifications of the transvestitic and the transsexual phenomenon. Future studies and observations may decide which one is likely to come closest to the truth and in this way a possible understanding of the etiology may be gained."<ref name = Benjamin1966/>

''Transsexualism'' was included for the first time in the [[DSM-III]] in 1980.<ref>American Psychiatric Association. (1980). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (3rd ed.). Washington, D.C.: Author.</ref>

"Gender Identity Disorder" was a term created in the [[DSM-III]] in regard to transsexuals, and the categories were "GID/Children Transsexualism"; "GID/Adolescent and Adult, Non-transsexual type" and "GID/Not Otherwise Specified". Notably, this did not address Late-onset transsexualism, where patients may not have had symptoms as children. Interestingly, in the major revision of the DSM, [[DSM-III-R]], they were placed in the category "Disorders Usually First Evident in Infancy, Childhood or Adolescence". The problem was that it got lost here, as well as the issue of adult onset explained above.<ref name="Pauly"/>

In the DSM-III, the terms "Homosexual", "Heterosexual", and "Asexual" were used - with quite a bit of confusion.<ref name=Pauly>Pauly, I. B. (1993). Terminology and classification of gender identity disorders. ''Journal of Psychology & Human Sexuality, 5,'' 1-12.</ref>  (These terms were replaced in the DSM-IV by "Attracted to males", "Attracted to Females", "Attracted to Both" and "Attracted to neither.")

===DSM-III-R===
The DSM-III-R, published in 1987, retained the term ''transsexualism''.<ref>American Psychiatric Association. (1987). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (3rd ed., rev.). Washington, D.C.: Author.</ref> It was located under "Disorders Usually First Evident in Infancy, Childhood or Adolescence".

===DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR===
''Gender Identity Disorder in Adolescents and Adults'' replaced the term transsexualism. In the [[DSM-IV-TR]], GID is placed in the category of Sexual Disorders, with the subcategory of Gender Identity Disorders. The names were changed in [[DSM-IV]] to "Gender Identity Disorder in Children", "Gender Identity Disorder in Adolescents or Adults", and "Gender Identity Disorder Not Otherwise Specified".

===DSM-5===
In the [[DSM-5]], gender identity disorder was replaced with [[gender dysphoria]]; the focus is no longer on identity, but on the distress that trans people may experience when their biological sexes do not line up with said identities. Persons with gender dysphoria are also no longer classified by sexuality.<ref name="Huffington Post">{{cite web|title=Gender Dysphoria: DSM-5 Reflects Shift In Perspective On Gender Identity|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/04/gender-dysphoria-dsm-5_n_3385287.html|website=Huffington Post|date=4 June 2013}}</ref>

==International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems==
The ''[[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]]'' (most commonly known by the abbreviation '''ICD''') is according to its publisher, the [[United Nations]]-sponsored [[World Health Organization]] "the standard diagnostic tool for epidemiology, health management and clinical purposes."<ref>https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/ access:26 June 2012</ref> It is known as a health care classification system that provides codes to classify [[disease]]s and a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease. Under this system, every health condition can be assigned to a unique category and given a code, up to six characters long. Such categories can include a set of similar diseases.

The International Classification of Diseases is published by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and used worldwide for morbidity and mortality statistics, [[reimbursement]] systems, and automated decision support in [[health care]]. This system is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of these statistics. The ICD is a core classification of the [[WHO Family of International Classifications]] (WHO-FIC).<ref name="WHO-FIC">World Health Organization. [https://www.who.int/classifications/en/ Family of International Classifications.]  Accessed 12 July 2011.</ref>

The ICD is revised periodically and is currently in its eleventh revision. Annual minor updates and [[triennial]] major updates of the ICD are published by the WHO.<ref>WHO. [https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/icd10updates/en ''List of Official ICD-10 Updates''.]</ref> 

=== ICD-10 ===
The [[ICD-10]], as it is therefore known, was developed in 1992 to track health statistics. The ICD is part of a "family" of guides that can be used to complement each other, including also the [[International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health]] which focuses on the domains of functioning (disability) associated with health conditions, from both medical and social perspectives.

In the ICD-10, transsexualism is located within [[Gender identity disorder]]s, F64 in [[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders]] under the heading "Disorders of adult personality and behaviour".

=== ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (2018) ===
The eleventh revision of ICD, [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems#ICD-11 (stable version for implementation release June 2018)|ICD-11]] was published in June 2018 by WHO <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/content/refguide.ICD11_en/html/index.html|title=ICD-11 Reference Guide|website=icd.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904001723/https://icd.who.int/browse11/content/refguide.ICD11_en/html/index.html|archive-date=2018-09-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> and was revised using [[Web 2.0]] principles.<ref name="Wikipedia">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2007/05/02/disease-wiki.html|title=WHO adopts Wikipedia approach for key update|date=May 2, 2007|work=CBC News|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]}}</ref> In this new major revision, ICD-11 has abolished codes [[Gender dysphoria|F64 Gender identity disorders]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/F64|title=ICD-10 Version:2016|website=apps.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref> and F65.1 [[Transvestic fetishism|Fetishistic Transvestism]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/F65.1|title=ICD-10 Version:2016|website=apps.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref> among other sexual practices, that used to be referred to as [[Paraphilia|paraphilias]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://revisef65.net/global-milestone-human-rights-reform/|title=WHO takes bdsm and fetishism off the sick list - Revise F65|website=revisef65.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref> The above codes have been replaced in part by code [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/90875286 HA60 Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood]<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/90875286|title=ICD-11 - Mortality and Morbidity Statistics|website=icd.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref>''',''' which refers to the three conditions that classify the condition of gender dysphoria.<ref name=":0" /> 

The major paradigm shift is reflected in the last sentence from code HA60: "Gender variant behavior and preferences alone are not a basis for assigning the diagnosis."  This has profoundly changed the way Science and Psychology views transgender people and transexuals, as it has removed the stigma related to being referred to as people who suffer from paraphilias,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#http://id.who.int/icd/entity/2110604642|title=ICD-11 - Mortality and Morbidity Statistics|website=icd.who.int|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref> 132 years after [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] first published [[Psychopathia Sexualis (Richard von Krafft-Ebing book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24766|title=Psychopathia Sexualisavec recherches spéciales sur l'inversion sexuelle|last=Krafft-Ebing|first=R. von (Richard)|date=2008-03-06|language=French|translator-last=Csapo|translator-first=Sigismond|translator-last2=Laurent|translator-first2=Emile}}</ref>

==Blanchard's transsexualism typology==
[[Blanchard's transsexualism typology]] (also Blanchard autogynephilia theory (BAT) and Blanchard's taxonomy) is a [[psychological typology]] of male-to-female [[transsexualism]] created by [[Ray Blanchard]] through the 1980s and 1990s, building on the work of his colleague, [[Kurt Freund]].  Blanchard divides male-to-female (MtF or M2F) transsexuals into two different groups: "homosexual transsexuals", who are attracted to men, and "non-homosexual transsexuals", who are "autogynephilic" (sexually aroused by the thought or image of themselves as a woman).  The typology does not purport to identify the cause of transsexualism in natal males, but it has some implications for the cause—specifically, that the cause of transsexualism may not be the same for both groups.{{CN|date=March 2019}}

Scientific criticism of the research and theory has come from [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]], Jaimie Veale, Larry Nuttbrock, [[Charles Allen Moser]], and others who argue that the theory is poorly representative of MtF transsexuals, reduces [[gender identity]] to a matter of attraction, is non-instructive, and that the research cited in support of the theory has inadequate control groups or is contradicted by other data. Supporters of the theory include [[Anne Lawrence]], [[J. Michael Bailey]], [[James Cantor]], and others who argue that there are significant differences between the two groups, including sexuality, age of transition, ethnicity, IQ, fetishism, and quality of adjustment.  

The theory has been the subject of protests in the transsexual and larger LGBT community, although it has its supporters. The issues with Blanchard's work were again the subject of criticism with the publication of Bailey's ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'' in 2003. In 2005, Blanchard distanced himself from Bailey's affirmation of the scientific certainty of the cause, expressing that further research was needed before said certainty could be sufficiently justified.<ref name="Bancroft2009">{{cite book|author=Bancroft J|title=Human sexuality and its problems|pages =[https://books.google.com/books?id=bI-Jau14aLAC&pg=PA291 291] |year=2009|publisher= [[Elsevier]] |isbn=978-0-443-05161-6}}</ref>

A 2016 review found support for the predictions of Blanchard's typology that androphilic and gynephilic trans women have different brain [[phenotype]]s. It stated that although [[James Cantor]] seems to be right that Blanchard's predictions have been validated by two independent structural [[neuroimaging]] studies, there is "still only one study on nonhomosexual MtFs; to fully confirm the hypothesis, more independent studies on nonhomosexual MtFs are needed. A much better verification of the hypothesis could be supplied by a specifically designed study including homosexual and nonhomosexual MtFs." The review stated that "confirming Blanchard's prediction still needs a specifically designed comparison of homosexual MtF, homosexual male, and heterosexual male and female people."<ref name="Guillamon">{{cite journal | vauthors = Guillamon A, Junque C, Gómez-Gil E | title = A Review of the Status of Brain Structure Research in Transsexualism | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 45 | issue = 7 | pages = 1615–48 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27255307 | pmc = 4987404 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-016-0768-5 }}</ref>
