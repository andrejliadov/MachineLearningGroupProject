'''''Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life''''' is a 1996 American [[documentary film]] written, produced, and directed by [[Michael Paxton]]. Its focus is on novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]], the author of the bestselling novels ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', who promoted her philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] through her books, articles, speeches, and media appearances.

==Synopsis==
Actress [[Sharon Gless]] narrates the story of Rand's life and an overview of her ideas. In addition to color and black-and-white archival footage of Rand, the film includes appearances by philosophers [[Harry Binswanger]] and [[Leonard Peikoff]], [[CBS News]] correspondent [[Mike Wallace]], television interviewers [[Phil Donahue]] and [[Tom Snyder]], architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], political figures [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]], and Hollywood personalities [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Edith Head]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].

==History==
Paxton first encountered Rand's work in 1970 at the age of 13, when he read her novel ''[[We the Living]]''. In 1977 he saw her speak at the [[Ford Hall Forum]], an experience that he later cited as an inspiration for his approach to the documentary.<ref name="Paxton">{{cite book |title=Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life (The Companion Book) |last=Paxton |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Paxton |location=Layton, Utah |publisher=Gibbs Smith |year=1998 |isbn=0-87905-845-5 |oclc=38048196 |pages=9–10}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Reviews===
[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "a pedantic specimen," "dutiful in outlook and utterly conventional in format," and said it "does little beyond appreciating its subject as unwaveringly as possible."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/021398rand-film-review.html |title='Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life:' A View of the Philospher (''sic'') |author=Maslin, Janet |website=NYTimes.com |accessdate=September 25, 2017}}</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, and commented: "Too long – and pedantic – for some viewers, but a must for Rand enthusiasts."<ref name="maltin">{{cite book |last =Maltin |first =Leonard |author-link =Leonard Maltin |title =Leonard Maltin's 2004 Movie & Video Guide |publisher =Plume |year =2003 |page =[https://archive.org/details/leonardmaltins2000leon_2/page/70 70] |isbn =0-452-28478-3 |url-access =registration |url =https://archive.org/details/leonardmaltins2000leon_2/page/70 }}</ref>

[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said the film "is not what one might expect at this stage in Rand's literary afterlife. The film doesn't make a case for her as an artist or philosopher, nor does it delineate her place in the pantheon of letters. It just assumes her importance and goes about telling her story . . . Obviously this was a woman of enormous courage, tenacity and fire. That comes through enough in ''Ayn Rand'' to make one wonder what she would have thought about the tone of the documentary, which at times borders on sappy . . . The tone will become grating even to anyone who is in sympathy with Rand's work. Though the documentary concentrates on the biographical, it glosses over the major embarrassment of her personal life – her adulterous relationship with her much younger disciple, [[Nathaniel Branden]] . . . ''Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life'' isn't nearly ambitious enough, but as an introduction to an important 20th century American voice, it works."<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/05/01/DD14367.DTL ''San Francisco Chronicle'' review]</ref>

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' observed, "Benefiting from some first-rate archival, personal and commercial film material, Michael Paxton's Oscar-nominated effort serves as a solid and appreciative precis of her life and world views, but doesn't get down in the trenches to illustrate how and why she stirred up such passions pro and con, and gingerly refrains from analyzing the paradoxes and complexities of her personality and intimate relationships."<ref>[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117467179.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 ''Variety'' review]</ref>
