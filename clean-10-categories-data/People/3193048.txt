==Early life==
Ra Un Nefer Amen was born in the Central American country of [[Panama]]. Amen attended Panama's Conservatory of Music when he was six years old. He arrived in the United States on May 30, 1960, to continue his formal musical training and graduated from the Brooklyn High School for Boys in [[Brooklyn, New York]] in 1961. Upon graduating, Amen continued his formal training at [[Juilliard|Juilliard Prep]] (Pre-College Division) and [[Mannes College of Music]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Amen | title= ''The Key to Understanding Your Incarnation Objective (Destiny Reading)''| publisher=Khamit Publications| year= 1996 |page= 4 }}</ref>

==Spiritual work==
Trained originally as a concert pianist, composer, and music theoretician, Amen passed on opportunities in the music industry to devote time to the spiritual education and uplift of African people. To accomplish this goal, he has written and published several books on the subject of [[ancient Egypt]]ian philosophy and spiritual culture, most notably ''[[Metu Neter]]'' (Vols. 1-7) and the [[Metu Neter Oracle]].

One of Ra Un Nefer Amen's early works, ''Meditation Techniquies of the Kabalists, Vedantins and Taoists'' provides specific instruction for student initiates. Instructions are provided for "moral laws" (pg. 16) or body-mind laws required for returning to a correct way of living, i.e., a way of living not deviated (see [[fall of man]]) or based upon unnatural conditionings. Adherence to these laws will produce in the practitioner an understanding of the Soul, Will and Consciousness (the three principles that constitute an exact knowledge of the Self). Returning to a proper way of living is a prerequisite bridge to be crossed through methods which include maintaining a proper diet. R.A. Straughn (as he called himself at the time of the book's publication in the late 1970s) pointed out, for example, that the most people eat a diet "severely low in fresh fruits" (page 20). Included is a specific regiment for [[Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga]] techniques including postures [[Asana]]s and breathing exercises [[Pranayama]] including, specifically, a technique called [[Tummo|Dhumo]] Breathing used for the purpose of cleansing the energy channels of the subtle body (see [[Nadi (yoga)|Nadis]]).

The book describes the three states of consciousness from [[Yoga]] science which were perhaps first documented in [[Patañjali|Patañjali's]] [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutra's]]: [[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyāna]], [[Dhāraṇā]], and [[Samadhi]]. Emphasis is placed upon the ability to control these states of consciousness, and thus avoid "sowing" in to one's consciousness, the "seeds" of thoughts which enter without the operation of one's will (only to cause un-willed thoughts to return again later and thus increase the likelihood of producing action and a further binding to one's conditionings).

The book also includes an introduction to the Chinese [[I Ching]] [[Oracle]]—a method of [[Divination]] for providing answers to questions about one's path. The book warns practitioners not to use the I Ching improperly, and only ask questions which the student has made every effort to answer before submitting them to the I Ching (abuse of the I Ching will lead to answers which cannot be comprehended, appear nonsensical, or offer no value).

Ra Un Nefer Amen currently leads an international<ref>{{cite book |last=Asante & Mazama | title= ''Encyclopedia of Black Studies''| publisher=Sage Publications| year= 2005 |page= 104 }}</ref> following as the "Shekhem Ur Shekhem" ("Chief Priest and King")  of the Ausar Auset Society headquartered in [[Brooklyn, New York]].

==Cultural liaison==
In 1984 he was selected by the Ashanti King of [[Agogo, Ghana|Agogo]], [[Nana Akuoko Sarpong|Nana Kwame Akuoko Sarpong]], to host the first [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]] ''(royal reception)'' for an African king ever held outside of Africa. Thus, in October 1985 the Shekhem Ur Shekhem Ra Un Nefer Amen hosted the Durbar for [[List of rulers of Asante|Asantehene]] Otumfuo Nana Opoku Ware II.

In November 1985, Amen, along with fifty-four AAS members, attended the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the [[Ashanti Confederacy]], at the invitation of the Asantehene in [[Kumasi]], [[Ghana]], West Africa where he was enstooled as an [[Omanhene]] of the Ashanti on November 15, 1985. During this visit Amen was also presented the Epoh Stool officially establishing an alliance between the Kingship of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] and the Kingship of the Ausar Auset Society. He was further conferred the position of [[Paramount King]] under the title of Odeneho ''(King of Kings)''. Additionally, Amen was enstooled by [[Nana Akuoko Sarpong|Nana Kwame Akuoko Sarpong]] as co-ruler of Agogo State in Ghana on November 18, 1985.

In his role as cultural liaison between [[African-Americans]] and the National Ghanaian House of Chiefs, the Shekhem Ur Shekhem, along with the Ghanaian community in the United States have sponsored Durbars for several other kings of Africa, including Togbi Adeladza V, a king of the [[Ewe people|Ewe]]; Nii Aumgi V, a king of the [[Ga people|Ga]]; Nana Adodankwa III, King of Okuapemman, and others. In 1986, Ra Un Nefer Amen was given a formal reception by President [[Jerry Rawlings]] of Ghana as an official guest to the dedication of the Nkrumah Mausoleum Memorial in [[Accra]], Ghana. In 1991, Amen was the official guest of the Oni of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] kingdom of [[Ife]], Oba Okunade Sijuade [[Olubuse II]] in [[Nigeria]], where he was the sole [[African-American]] dignitary to the first Ile Ife Reconstruction Project. He was also received by the [[Emir of Kano]], His Royal Majesty [[Alhaji Ado Bayero]].
