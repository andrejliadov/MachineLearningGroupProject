'''José María Hinojosa Lasarte''' (1904-1936) was a Spanish writer and political militant. As a man of letters he is considered one of the first if not the very first and the only genuinely [[Surrealism|surrealist]] poet in Spain, counted also among members of [[Generation of '27|Generation ‘27]]. As a politician he acted in ultra-conservative realm, holding [[Carlism|Carlist]] jefatura in [[Málaga]] and building [[Andalusia]]n structures of the [[Spanish Agrarian Party|Agrarian party]]. Following more than half a century of oblivion, his memory and especially the circumstances of his death became a counter-reference to these of [[Federico García Lorca|Lorca]] and are subject to politically-charged discussions.

==Family and youth==
[[File:Andalusian landholders.jpg|thumb|160px|left|father (middle)]]
According to the family legend the forefathers of José María<ref>full name José, Salvadór, Francisco, Javier, Rafael del Corazón de Jesús</ref> descended from [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]]; according to historical records the Carvajals were first noted in Málaga province in the 16th century, having founded the town of [[Campillos]].<ref>Julio Neira, ''Introducción'', [in:] José María Hinojosa, ''La Flor de Californía'', Santander 1979, p. 15</ref> Along the strictly male paternal line the Hinojosas, another local family, throughout the centuries as wealthy landholders ensured their dominant position in the county.

Hinojosa and his siblings were brought up in luxury<ref>Hinojosa spent his infancy and adolescent years between Campillos, Alameda and Málaga, Geo Constantinescu, ''José María Hinojosa y el surrealismo español'', [in:] ''Diacronia'' 6 (2010), pp. 445-449</ref> and under heavy religious influence,<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 181</ref> the latter mostly due to their mother. Certain scholars suggest that Asunción's strong Catholic conviction bordered on tyranny.<ref>A case usually often quoted to demonstrate Hinojosa’s mother's zealous Catholicism and its impact on him is her insistence that the young José María did not reside in the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]], which she considered a hotbed of atheism and blasphemy, Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-16. Also in the late 1920s the tension persisted; Hinojosa’s mother refused to enter his room while a surrealist act was hanging on the wall; acting on suggestion on Freullen Valls eventually Hinojosa removed the painting, Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-48</ref> From infancy, José María was described as serious, withdrawn, addicted to reading, and having a penchant for extravagance.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-7</ref> In 1915<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. I2-8. Some authors claim he entered school in 1914, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 182</ref> he entered the Colegio de San Fernando in Málaga and possibly also the Jesuit college of San Estanislao; he graduated in 1920.<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 182</ref> In 1921–1922 he attended preparatory law courses at the [[Universidad de Granada]]<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-12</ref> before moving to [[Madrid]] in 1923, where he enrolled at the Facultad de Derecho. After a 1925–1926 spell in [[Paris]] – either to improve his French or to prepare for diplomatic service<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-22 to 2-26</ref> – Hinojosa returned to Spain<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 186</ref> and completed his curriculum in 1926.<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 182</ref> He spent most of 1927 serving in the military<ref>when performing his military service in Madrid Hinojosa lived in Hotel Majestic and showed up on duty every morning, Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-30</ref> as a soldier in the capital.<ref>the service lasted from February to December 1927; Hinojosa was assigned to Brigada Obrera y Topográfica, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 186</ref> He completed his service in 1928.<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 188</ref>
[[File:Laguna en Campillos (6004708284).jpg|thumb|[[Campillos]] county]]
 
The years of 1928–1930 were mostly bohemian in Málaga, combined with journeys across Andalusia and abroad. Apart from trips to [[France]] and [[England]], Hinojosa visited [[Nordic countries]] and toured the [[USSR]], perhaps the first of this sort permitted by the Soviet authorities.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-38</ref> Partly living with his family, he also began to engage in the family business, which apart from landholdings also includes industrial exploration activities.<ref>''El Financiero'' 19.08.21, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0025444586&page=51 here]</ref> Around that time, he fell in love with Ana Freüller Valls, an aristocrat, granddaughter to [[Juan Valera y Alcalá-Galiano|Juan Valera]] and a local aviation pioneer. Their relationship proved to be a complex and erratic one. Hinojoisa hoped for marriage and indeed Freüller later admitted that at one point they were about to marry; however, she also claimed that they were simply close friends.<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, pp. 195-196</ref> The affair went on until Hinojosa's death; he was never married and had no children.

==Literary career==
[[File:Benjamín Jarnés, Humberto Pérez de la Ossa, Luis Buñuel. Rafael Barradas y Federico García Lorca. Madrid, 1923.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Spanish surrealists in Madrid, 1923]]
In the early 1920s, Hinojosa began his career in Málaga with [[Emilio Prados]] as his literary mentor.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-11</ref> In 1923, he co-founded<ref>with Emilio Prados and the two and José María Souvirón</ref> ''Ambos'', a literary review. Vaguely anchored in Andalusian rural myths it embraced aspects of the eclectic avant-garde, including [[dadaism]], [[futurism]] and [[expressionism]];<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 183</ref> apart from juvenile poems contributed by its founders, the periodical also printed works of García Lorca, [[:es:Rafael Laffón|Laffón Zambrano]] and [[:es:Esteban Salazar Chapela|Salazar Chapela]]. With circulation limited mostly to acquaintances, ''Ambos'' stopped after just 4 issues.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, pp. 2-13 to 2-16</ref> Hinojosa's writing matured in Paris, where he joined the circle of young Spanish artists: apart from already befriended Prados and Lorca the group included [[Buñuel]], [[Dalí]] and a number of later famous writers and painters.<ref>the group of Hinojosa’s acquiantances included also Juan Ramón Jiménez, José Moreno Villa, José Bergamín, Rafael Alberti, Juan Vicéns, José María Chacón, José Bello, José María Barnadas, René Crével, Pierre Unik, Joaquín Peinado, Hernando Viñes, Ismael de la Sema, Francisco Cossio, Francisco Bores, Benjamin Palencia, José María Ucelay and Gregorio Prieto; in 1926 he met Breton himself, Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-17</ref> Though styled after [[Rimbaud]],<ref>Hinojose used to wear Rimbaud-style hat and smoked a pipe, Alfonso Sánchez Rodriguez, ''José María Hinojosa y la calavera de Rimbaud'', [in:] ''Clarín'' 04.06.08, available [https://www.revistaclarin.com/73/jose-maria-hinojosa-y-la-calavera-de-rimbaud/ here]</ref> in terms of poetry Hinojosa was described as a surrealist;<ref>origins of Hinojosa's surrealism are disputed; some scholars claim it stemmed from Andalusian baroque esthetics combined with rural mythology, others reply that he clearly picked up surrealism in Paris, influenced by Aragon and Breton, Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, p. 185</ref> the poems he contributed to reviews like ''La Verdad'' or ''Verso y prosa'',<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 186</ref> but especially the volumes he published in 1925–1927, are considered a stepping stone towards full literary maturity.<ref>his first surrealist work is considered to be a 1924 poem ''Sueños''. 1925, 1926 and 1927 volumes are thought to be "preambulo" and "comienzo" to full literary maturity, Enrique Baena, ''El argumento de la Obra. Poética y sueño en José María Hinojosa'', [in:] Julio Neira, Almoraima González (eds.), ''Escondido en la luz'', Málaga 2005, {{ISBN|8477856990}}, p. 174</ref>

Hinojosa's writings climaxed in 1928 with the publication of further two volumes, considered the peak embodiment of his surrealism. In the late 1920s, he got involved in Imprenta Sur, a friendly Málaga publishing house<ref>set up by his friends Altoaguirre and Chaves</ref> and especially in the launch of ''[[:es:Litoral (Revista)|Litoral]]'', another Málaga-based avant-gardist literary review. He contributed as editor and poet, specifically involved in the 1929 commemorative issue dedicated to [[Góngora]]; at that time he also engaged financially<ref>Víctor de Lama (ed.), ''Poesía de la generación del 27: Antología crítica recomendada'', Madrid 1997, {{ISBN|9788441402393}}, p. 433</ref> and entered the board;<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 183</ref> later Hinojosa intended to launch a strictly surrealist periodical.<ref>with provocative titles like ''Poesía y Destrucción, El Agua en la Boca'' or ''El Libertinaje'', Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-46</ref> Due to his poetry and bohemian lifestyle but also because of somewhat anti-religious if not nearly blasphemous motives of his writings, in the local Málaga milieu he was already enjoying the reputation of an extravagant [[iconoclast]]. Hinojosa reinforced this image by staging social provocations scandalizing both iconic intellectuals like [[Valle-Inclan]]<ref>during a homage reception to Valle-Inclan Hinojosa was reading fake telegram messages urging to kill the writer; other ones were in scatological tone, e.g. claiming that "la condesa de Noailles menstrúa como una vaca", Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-29</ref> and plain rural Andalusians; he was willingly assisted by acquaintances like Dalí and his new female partner [[Gala Dalí|Gala]].<ref>Dali and Gala, driven across Andalusia in Hinojosa’s Chrysler cabrio, paraded half-naked in the countryside, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 187; see also Giovanni Allegra, ''Trent'anni di avanguardia spagnola: da Ramón Gómez de la Serna a Juan-Eduardo Cirlot'', Jaca 1987, {{ISBN|9788816950351}}, p. 165</ref> 
[[File:Ismael Nery - Composição Surrealista.jpg|thumb|160px|typical surrealist imagery]]
Hinojosa's relations with his avant-garde group of companions remained ambiguous. Though admitted to their inner circle,<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 182</ref> behind his back and to some extent also up front he was ridiculed as a wealthy señorito<ref>Joselú, ''José María Hinojosa, el poeta olvidado'', [in:] ''Profesor en secundaria blog'' 20.08.14, available [http://olahjl2.blogspot.com/2014/08/jose-maria-hinojosa-el-poeta-olvidado.html here]</ref> and mocked as a poor author who fathered disastrous poetry, never really a genuine member of the group;<ref>according to Vicente Aleixandre "we poets of the Generation of 1927 never took him very seriously as a poet"; Buñuel in private letters used to launch "unmerciful comic attack on José María Hinojosa"; Altoaguirre fumed about his "disastrous poems", Derek Harris, ''The Spanish Avant-garde'', Manchester 1996, {{ISBN|9780719043420}}, p. 82</ref> [[Gerardo Diego|Diego]], Lorca, Dalí or Buñuel used to denigrate him.<ref>Alfonso Sánchez Rodríguez, ''Un temblor de olas rojas: Poesía y compromiso político en la España de 1936'', Sevilla 2014, {{ISBN|9788484729730}}, p. 180, Gabriele Morelli, ''The ludic element in the Spanish avant-garde: Gerardo Diego’s jinojepa'', [in:] Derek Harris, ''The Spanish Avant-garde'', Manchester 1995, {{ISBN|9780719043420}}, p. 74</ref> Many treated him as a sponsor rather than as a fellow writer;<ref>de Lama 1997, p. 433</ref> they stayed at his premises, travelled with him and dined at his cost,<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, p. 175</ref> considering it useful to be on close terms with "bohemian with the current account"; some re-paid with own works, and this is how Hinojosa gatheredd a collection of paintings of [[Miró]], [[Picasso]], [[Juan Gris|Gris]], Dalí and [[Francisco Bores|Bores]].<ref>Jacqueline Rattray, ''A Delicious Imaginary Journey with Joan Miró and José María Hinojosa'', [in:] Robert Havard (ed.), ''Companion to Spanish Surrealism'', Woodbridge 2004, {{ISBN|9781855661042}}, p. 36, Jacqueline Rattray, ''Crossing the French–Spanish border with José Maria Hinojosa'', [in:] Elza Adamowicz (ed.) ''Surrealism: Crossings/Frontiers'', Bern 2006, {{ISBN|3039103288}}, p. 153. All paintings collected by Hinojosa got burnt when his family estate was raided by Republican militia in 1936, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 196. One painting could have been saved when Dalí, enraged about Hinojosa’s bourgeoisie turn, asked him to allow allegedly minor corrections to his portrait. Hinojosa returned the painting, never to see it back. The final fate of the painting (never reproduced) is not known; Dalí’s sketch of Hinojosa, often reproduced, is another work. Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-52</ref> Literary critique either ignored him or belittled him.<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 192</ref> It is not clear whether the complex setting contributed to the violent and apocalyptic tone of Hinojosa's last poetic volume, to be published in 1930, withdrawn from print and issued in early 1931. It turned out to be his farewell to belles-letres; according to some the poet decided to dump literature,<ref>final motives for his decision are not clear and there are different theories in circulation. One is that Hinojosa got embittered by indifference and mockery. Another is that he gave in to pressure of Ana Freüller. One more is that bored with his surrealist caprice he returned to his usual bourgeoisie habits, see e.g. Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, p. 188, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 192</ref> "commit literary suicide" and not to look back.<ref>Alfonso Sánchez Rodriguez, ''José María Hinojosa y la Calavera de Rimbaud'', [in:] ''Clarín'' 04.06.08, available [https://www.revistaclarin.com/73/jose-maria-hinojosa-y-la-calavera-de-rimbaud/ here]</ref>

==Works==
[[File:La Rosa de los Vientos by Hinojosa.jpg|thumb|160px|left|''La Rosa de Los Vientos'', 1927]]
Hinojosa penned around 200 [[poem]]s, mostly short and some very short ones; short prose is down to 14 texts evading typical categorization, while [[Drama|theatrical]] and [[novel]]ist attempts did not survive until today.<ref>they include a theatric piece ''El aviador y el buzo'' and a novel ''El Castillo de mi cuerpo''</ref> All works were written between 1923 and 1930; during his lifetime they were published in 6 limited-circulation volumes and few periodicals. His literary production is considered a curve, from early juvenile works to surrealist climax and a final descent.<ref>Baena 2005, p. 174</ref> Another scholar singles out 4 phases: descriptive, transitory, autobiographical and catastrophic.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 4-95</ref>

Early poems, from these printed in ''Ambos'' to ''Poema del Campo'' (1925),<ref>detailed discussion in Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, pp. 4-5 to 4-22</ref> are anchored in rural myths and set in capacity perceptive of an unspecified territory, largely [[bucolic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyrical]]. In terms of style due to folk ambience some refer to "neopopulism",<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 184</ref> others mention also "purismo" and "cubismo".<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 4-9</ref> Scholars flag a synthesis of tradition and modernity, the latter represented by innovative if not already extravagant [[metaphor]].<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 4-13</ref> ''Poesía de perfil'' (1926),<ref>detailed discussion in Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, pp. 4-22 to 4-43</ref> published in Paris,<ref>publication was financed by his father, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 184-185</ref> offered poems inspecting an interior of the fantastic mixed with a real setting. The largely descriptive tone gave way to dominant lyrical expression and the monothematic perspective was replaced with a variety of themes, often organized around the motive of exploration. "Estética purista" was partially substituted by [[oneiric]] and surrealist approach, not clear yet already visible, and the entire volume was distinctively more expressive.<ref>Francisco Chica, ''José María Hinojosa en el horizonte renovador de los años 20: filias y fobias'', [in:] Julio Neira, Almoraima González (eds.), ''Escondido en la luz'', Málaga 2005, {{ISBN|8477856990}}, p. 67</ref> ''La Rosa de los Vientos'' (1927),<ref>detailed discussin in Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, pp. 4-44 to 4-64</ref> published again in Málaga, was a small collection of just 19 poems; they focused upon imaginary journeys to exotic locations<ref>like the Amazon, Himalayas or Cape Horn</ref> and to the inner self. Providing a discourse on space, mystery, and wilderness the volume offered frequent references to ancient as well as popular culture and introduced heterodox erotic motives. Stylistically at times very sophisticated, blending various [[rhyme]] orders and [[syllable]] types, it is described as a mix of Hispanic Ultra, French surrealism and Chilean creationism.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 4-51</ref>
[[File:La Flor de California.jpg|thumb|160px|''La Flor de California'', 1928]]
Two volumes from 1928 are thought to be the most mature of Hinojosa's works. ''Orillas de la luz''<ref>detailed discussin in Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, pp. 4-65 to 4-91</ref> contained mostly poems saturated with eroticism, its main theme.<ref>according to scholars, his eroticism was flavored with disappointments, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 190</ref> They were, to a large extent, within the surrealist framework, featuring its trademark motives like mutilations and fragmented body parts; the fact that this poetry retained classic [[Metre (poetry)|metrum]] is thought to be demonstrative of Hinojosa's synthetic ambitions.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 4-82</ref> ''La Flor de Californía'',<ref>the title was intentionally mis-spelled, reportedly to enforce the rhyme between "Californía” and the author’s name, José María, Rattray 2004, p. 35</ref> considered the first surrealist work in Spain,<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 191; some consider it the only surrealist book published in Spain, Geoffrey Connell (ed.), ''Spanish Poetry of the Grupo Poético de 1927'', Oxford 1977, {{ISBN|0080169503}}, p. 18</ref> is his sole [[Prose|prosaic]] volume; it contains seven dream narratives and seven oneiric texts; the former retain some bizarre linear coherence, while the latter come close to so-called [[automatic writing]].<ref>one author claims Hinojose wrote the same way as Miró painted, Rattray 2004, p. 38 and another note „Miróesque” style of writing, Matilde de Moreno Escobar, ''La sangre en libertad: una reelaboración surrealista del petrarquismo'', [in:] Jaume Pont (ed.), ''Surrealismo y literatura en España'', Lleida 2001, {{ISBN|9788484095798}}, pp. 171-180</ref> The prose explores typical surrealist imagery:<ref>however, some scholars claim Hinojosa's surrealism contained also author-specific motives and threads, e.g. these of travelling, childlike antics and animals, Rattray 2004, p. 41</ref> antireligious motives,<ref>anti-religious threads though not dominant or omnipresent, are fairly frequent in late Hinojosa volumes. In ''La Flor de Californía'' "there is an anti-religious presence, which takes a particularly Catholic slant", i.e. in paragraphs that "the Pope received me in his pyjamas and sanctified all the festivities, finding it somewhat strange to see my pink skin", Rattray 2004, p. 46. For Hinojosa "his depictions of eroticism tend to be framed within the context of explicit blasphemy, and unconsciously or not, point to his underlying Catholic guilt" - Rattray 2004, p. 47. Others note that in ''La Flor'' "phallic and masturbatory meaning of the fingers/doves in Hinojosa’s narration would commune better with Venus than with the Holy Ghost, and the narration denounces the anti-human demands religion puts upon the flesh, causing the split between the body and the spirit"; examples are "eroticized version of Christ", constant blend of religious themes in erotic and sensual mode, pope who "amused himself with a sexual toy" or bleeding bodies representing religion violating humans, Candelas Gala, ''Creative cognition and the cultural panorama of twentieth-century Spain'', New York 2014, {{ISBN|9781137512260}}, especially the chapter ''Creative Convulsion: José María Hinojosa and La Flor de Californía''. According to some scholars Hinojosa edited ''Manifiesto contra los instituciones del Dios, patria y familia'', Lucie Personneaux-Conesa, ''Histoire et historiographie du surréalisme espagnol'', [in:] ''Mélusine'' XI (1990), pp. 137, though others tend to doubt it, Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-24</ref> [[black humor]], objective chance and subterranean dream-worlds, containing also a series of apocalyptic visions.<ref>Rattray 2004, pp. 35-36</ref> Strictly auto-biographical in terms of perspective, it is viewed as an expression of his own identity in an increasingly desperate pursuit of fulfillment.<ref>detailed discussin in Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, pp. 4-92 to 4-120</ref> ''La Sangre en Libertad'' (1931)<ref>the volume contained poems written mostly in 1929; they were originally to be printed in early 1930, but Hinojosa withdrew the pre-prepared book from the publisher. He then changed his mind and opted for publication; the volume saw light in January 1931, Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 4-121</ref> was very much a repetition of ''La Flor'' but brought to extremes, with new levels of anti-religious ridicule,<ref>reportedly the book was the expression of "fury against humanity for having invented religion", Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 193</ref> sexual references, motives of violence and apocalyptic scenery.<ref>Rattray 2004, p. 35</ref> Autobiographic features were embroiled in catastrophic premonitions;<ref>most poems are written in first person plural, for the first time used by Hinojosa</ref> stylistically the volume shows an evolution towards [[free verse]]<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 4-138</ref> and far-reaching [[Formalism (literature)|formal linguistic experiments]].<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 4-145</ref>

==From iconoclast to Carlist==
[[File:Вышибем кулаков из колхозов 1930.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[kolkhoz]] in propaganda]]
Until the early 1930s Hinojosa did not engage in politics, though his literary stand – especially anti-religious threads, but also social provocations aimed against perceived [[bourgeoisie]] mentality – was clearly suggesting left-wing preferences;<ref>some authors refer to him as "clearly the man of the left", Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, p. 187</ref> reportedly he also considered [[collectivization]] of family estates and might have visited the USSR to gain familiarity with the [[Kolkhoz|Soviet scheme]].<ref>Neira Jiménez 2005, p. 79, Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-34. Reportedly Hinojosa has even convinced own father to collectivize one of the estates, but the experiment turned into a failure</ref> His later about-face and engagement in right-wing politics remain a mystery and have not been satisfactorily explained. Some scholars speculate that the USSR journey commenced the change.<ref>Hinojosa returned from the USSR entirely disappointed and claimed he had been offered nothing but lies, fakes, and pre-staged demonstrations, Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-39, also Ruiz Gisbert 2007, pp. 189-190</ref> Others note that getting engaged in family business, for decades plagued by rural strikes and social tension,<ref>already in 1919 Salvador Hinojosa was featured in the press as fighting the striking rural workers, ''La Unión Ilustrada'' 11.12.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0005468753&page=14 here]</ref> might have also led to his transformation. It is underlined that a love affair with Ana Freüller, apart from being an aviation pioneer a fairly typical wealthy girl who loathed his poetry, might have contributed to this shift in political preference.<ref>for their complex relationship see e.g. Ruiz Gisbert 2007, pp. 195-196</ref> It is not clear whether the ambiguous stance of Hinojosa's artistic companions convinced him that he belonged to another world and caused him to overreact.<ref>however, Hinojosa did not break with his literary circle entirely, e.g. maintaining relations with Altoaguirre and Prados, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 194</ref> Finally, some claimed that his surrealism was merely the caprice of a bourgeoisie señorito,<ref>Neira Jiménez 2005, p. 80</ref> opinion shared also by a few scholars.<ref>one scholar, though very sympathetic towards Hinojosa and writing with no venom and disdain typical for his surrealist friends, sort of endorsed their view suggesting „let’s not assume a tight knot between life and literature” of Hinojosa, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 194</ref>
[[File:José María Lamamié de Clairac.png|thumb|160px|[[José María Lamamié de Clairac y Colina|Lamamié de Clairac]]]]
Hinojosa's biographers either claim that he started to embrace a right-wing mindset after 1928<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, pp. 189-90</ref> or that the rupture took place sometime between 1925 and 1930.<ref>Neira Jiménez 2005, p. 80</ref> He was already highly skeptical – though not militantly averse yet – when the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] was declared in 1931.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-55</ref> In unclear circumstances he assumed the post of [[juez municipal]] in Campillos,<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-56</ref> the job which might have exposed him to cases of social violence. Starting July he was recorded as engaged in the establishment of a provincial landholders’ organization; later that year he became secretary of the newly emergent Federación Provincial de Sindicatos Agrícolas de Málaga<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 195, Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-58</ref> and started to write agriculture-centred and conservatism-flavored articles in the local ''[[:es:La Unión Mercantil|La Unión Mercantil]]''.<ref>between 1931 and 1936 Hinojose published 150 articles in ''La Unión Mercantil'', Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 194. For details see Luis Teófilo Gil Cuadrado, ''La ideología política de José María Hinojosa: Sus artículos en "La Unión Mercantil"'', [in:] Matilde Moreno (ed.), ''José María Hinojosa: entre dos luces: 1904–1936'', Málaga 2004, {{ISBN|8477856451}}, pp. 152-162</ref> At that time Hinojosa demonstrated interest in [[Partido Nacionalista Español]] of [[José María Albiñana|José Albiñana]]<ref>Javier Pérez Andújar, Salvador Dalí: a la conquista de lo irracional, Madrid 2003, {{ISBN|9788496107137}}, p. 150</ref> and his former surrealist colleagues agonized that he was about to found a provincial branch of "partido fascista".<ref>Neira Jiménez 2005, p. 80</ref>

Hinojosa finally decided to opt for another right-wing organization. [[José María Lamamié de Clairac y Colina|José María Lamamié de Clairac]], a landholder and a friend of his father, was at the time combining syndicate activity in agrarian groupings with political engagement in Carlism; it was him who convinced Hinojosa to follow suit.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-59</ref> Since January 1932 he was taking part in [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]] gatherings;<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, pp. 2-59 to 2-60</ref> in July 1932 he was already recorded delivering a lecture which hailed Catholic virtues of patriotic women, who bravely confronted renegade liberalism,<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-60</ref> and in early August he organized Carlist meetings in Málaga himself.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-61</ref> He resigned the juez municipal post.<ref>''La Epoca'' 20.10.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001110075&page=2 here]</ref> Gaining recognition in nationwide [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] press<ref>''El Siglo Futuro'' 20.06.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000499861&page=2 here]</ref> Hinojosa was getting identified as a belligerent "derechista” by the authorities; though he had nothing to do with [[Sanjurjada]], in its aftermath he was detained and spent 2 weeks in a local prison, locked up with other Andalusian Carlists genuinely involved in the coup.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-61, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 194</ref> The experience has only exacerbated his militancy.<ref>Neira 1979, pp. 33-34</ref>

==Between Carlism and Agrarism==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumb|left|Carlist standard]]
After his release from jail in late 1932, Hinojosa continued organizing Carlist gatherings across the province.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-61</ref> In early 1933, he emerged among the most active Traditionalists in the area together with [[Jose Maria Arauz de Robles Estremera|Arauz de Robles]].<ref>''ABC'' 23.03.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1933/02/23/022.html here]</ref> In March he rose to the ''jefe'' of the local organization; in numerous addresses he saluted [[Carlist]] heroes, pledged to liberate Spain from a Liberal-Marxist revolution, and paid homage to [[Sanjurjo]], who gallantly sacrificed himself for Spain; some addresses contained thinly veiled anti-Republican tones.<ref>e.g. he called to sustain "great Spanish race united in its ecumenic spirit and poised to triumph, when sun will shine dispersing the haze and mist of the Republic", ''El Siglo Futuro'' 22.03.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000508944&page=3 here]</ref> In parallel Hinojosa hectically worked to build agrarian syndicates through meetings, speeches, and writings,<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, pp. 2-63 to 2-66</ref> and as a Carlist representative he animated the Málaga branch of [[Popular Action (Spain)|Acción Popular]].<ref>''ABC'' 13.07.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1933/07/13/030.html here]</ref> He represented all 3 groupings [[Electoral Carlism (Second Republic)|standing on broad right-wing alliance]] ticket during the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 electoral campaign]]; some papers referred to him as a Carlist,<ref>''La Vanguardia'' 23.11.33, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1932/10/16/pagina-16/33190137/pdf.html here], ''ABC'' 23.11.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1933/11/23/020.html here]</ref> some as Agrarian<ref>''ABC'' 22.11.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1933/11/22/022.html here]</ref> and some as a candidate of AP; scholars name him a Carlist.<ref>Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931–1939'', Cambridge 2008, {{ISBN|9780521086349}}, p. 50</ref> With 21,662 votes he failed to make it to the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] during the inconclusive first round and withdrew shortly before the second one.<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 195, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 04.12.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000518708&page=2 here]</ref> He commenced the year of 1934 as a freshly appointed member of the board of Editorial Tradicionalista,<ref>''El Siglo Futuro'' 12.12.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000519043&page=1 here]</ref> a new publishing house intended as an engine of Carlist propaganda.<ref>Blinkhorn 2008, p. 133</ref>

From early 1934, there is no more information on Hinojosa's Carlist engagements. Instead, most sources point to his relations with Partido Agrario Español and its syndicates.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, p. 180</ref> He kept writing to ''La Unión Mercantil'' on average 3 times a month,<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 2-59</ref> kept co-administering family estates,<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 195</ref> and commenced the career of a lawyer.

[[File:Spanish Civil War - Mass grave - Estépar, Burgos.jpg|thumb|civil war mass grave]]
Following triumph of [[Popular Front (Spain)|Frente Popular]] Hinojosa was hectically involved in agrarian syndicates, demanding re-introduction of public order and a revision of rural labor contracts.<ref>''La Vanguardia'' 24.06.36, available h[[ttp://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1936/02/18/pagina-24/33140460/pdf.html|here]]</ref> In May – still active as a lawyer<ref>in 1936 Hinojose opened a law company with José María Barrionuevo, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 195</ref> - he was detained following disturbances in Campillos.<ref>''La Vanguardia'' 31.05.36, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1936/02/18/pagina-26/33137286/pdf.html here]</ref> During the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|July 18 coup]] in Málaga he might have been involved in assisting the military<ref>according to some scholars Hinojosa intended to assist the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|rebels]], but they turned civilians down, Julio Neira, ''Introducción'', [in:] José María Hinojosa, ''Poesias completas'', vol. 1, Málaga 1983, p. 29. However, another study claims the military did prepare the rising jointly with civilian representatives; they note also that when rebel troops briefly took control of the city centre on late afternoon July 18, young civilians were distributing food and water to the soldiers, Antonio Nadal, ''Málaga, 18 de julio 1936'', [in:] ''Jábega'' 21 (1978), pp. 28-39</ref> and together with his father and brother went into hiding the following day. They considered an escape to [[Gibraltar]], but before taking action the three were captured on July 24. They spent the next month in provincial prison;<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, pp. 181-182</ref> on August 22 the workers’ militia stormed the building, dragged 43 prisoners out, shot them at the local cemetery and buried the bodies in the mass grave.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, p. 182</ref> Hinojosa's corpse has never been positively identified. Following the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] conquest of Málaga the remnants were exhumed and Salvador Hinojosa was recognized thanks to a handkerchief in his pocket; it was assumed that two mostly decomposed corpses of young males next to his body were these of Francisco and José María.<ref>Neira 1983, p. 29</ref>

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:RafaelAlberti01.JPG|thumb|160px|left|[[Rafael Alberti|Alberti]], 1960s]]
Hinojosa's writings went unnoticed, save for a limited [[avant-garde]] audience.<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 188</ref> Critics remained mostly indifferent;<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 184</ref> only few noted "excessive originality".<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 186</ref> A handful of reviews following the 1928 volumes denigrated the author; some dubbed his poetry "entelequia", others ridiculed "señorito andaluz" and noted that "having two cars does not allow too much".<ref>Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 192</ref> Following his death his works were almost completely forgotten,<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, p. 181</ref> as to both sides of the war he was an "inconvenient dead".<ref>''José María Hinojosa Lasarte: Tradición política y vanguardia artística'', [in:] ''El Matiner Carlí'' service 20.08.10, available [http://elmatinercarli.blogspot.com/2010/08/jose-maria-hinojosa-lasarte-tradicion-y.html here]</ref> For the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]] his life and death made a dangerously symmetrical parallelism to those of Lorca and might have harmed the exaltation of Lorca's fate as anti-Francoist [[cause célèbre]].<ref>Neira Jiménez 2005, p. 81. Another author notes that "si se hubiera tratado de un poeta exiliado, o caído en zona differente, no es aventurado afirmar que otro gallo le cantaría a su recuerco literario", opinion referred after Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. I-31</ref> Hinojosa was denied surrealist credentials<ref>Rattray 2006, p. 153</ref> and patronized;<ref>Moreno Villa wrote in 1944 "pobre José María Hinojosa, que en verdad era un poeta pardillo deslumbrado por una larga instancia en París"; his patronising tone presented Hinojosa as señorito temporarily attracted to surrealism, Neira Jiménez 2005, p. 81</ref> his former companions like [[Rafael Alberti|Alberti]] floated stories of a greedy bourgeoisie landowner killed by his own peasants<ref>for decades the most widespread versions of his death were incorrect. According to Alberti Hinojosa "caído bajo las balas de sus propios campesinos"; according to Manuel Altolaguirre at "uno de los mítines en que [Hinojosa] iba a contradecirse a sí mismo delante de los trabajadores explotados de sus propias tierras, [where] fue víctima de un sangriento motín que le costó la vida". Some scholars claim that the fact that both versions dominated for so long is itself indicative, Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, p. 181. Some authors claimed that Hinojosa joined Falange, Vittorio Bodini (ed.), ''I poeti surrealisti spagnoli'', Torino 1963, p. CXXXVI</ref> and some denied knowing him.<ref>the case of José Bergamín, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 197</ref> For the Nationalists, who consistently denied the existence of Spanish surrealism,<ref>Neira Jiménez 2005, p. 80</ref> his iconoclastic poetry made him ineligible for a martyr.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, p. 184</ref> The exiled and Spain-based historians of literature alike either ignored Hinojosa<ref>Angel del Río in chapter ''Ultraísmo, vanguardia, nueva poesía'' does not mention Hinojosa, Angel del Río, ''Historia de la literatura española'', New York 1948</ref> or relegated him to footnotes,<ref>Max Aub notes that Hinojosa "died too early for his surrealism to produce an important work", Max Aub, ''Manual de historia de la literatura española'', Mexico 1966, p. 314</ref> though very sporadically some poems appeared in anthologies<ref>single Hinojosa poems were published in a 1947 Santiago de Chile anthology and a 1962 Málaga anthology, referred after Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. I-12, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 197</ref> and his name was mentioned in the press a few times.<ref>in the Francoist press Hinojosa was noted not for his surrealist poetry but rather for his engagement in ''Litoral'', compare ''La Vanguardia'' 20.01.60, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1936/02/18/pagina-18/32717711/pdf.html here] or ''ABC'' 20.04.69, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1969/04/20/167.html here]</ref>

In 1974 Hinojosa's cousin Baltasar Peña took advantage of his position in the [[Provincial Deputation of Málaga|Diputación de Málaga]] to finance a re-edition of selected works;<ref>Neira Jiménez 2005, p. 82, Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, pp. 176, 178</ref> some press notes followed up noting a "deformación" of contemporary literature<ref>''La Vanguardia'' 03.10.74, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1936/02/18/pagina-51/34246145/pdf.html here]</ref> yet others insisted not to "desorbitar la importancia".<ref>José María Diez Bourque, ''Historia de la literatura española'', Madrid 1974, p. 51. Editor of a 1976 anthology was anxious about anticipated criticism and noted that Hinojosa can be excluded, referred after Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, pp. I-16, I-17</ref> In 1977 Julio Neira launched a campaign to revindicate Hinojosa, crowned with a 1981 PhD dissertation;<ref>Julio Neira Jiménez, ''José María Hinojosa. Vida y obra'' [PhD thesis Universidad de Extremadura], Cáceres 1981</ref> a 1983 re-edition of 2 volumes of ''Litoral'' contributed to the process. In the 1980s Hinojosa was gradually making his way into encyclopedias, periodicals, textbooks etc.<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, pp. I-19 to I-22</ref> and 1995 brought another PhD thesis.<ref>Alfonso Sánchez Rodríguez, ''La poesía de José María Hinojosa'' [PhD thesis Universitat de Lleida], Lérida 1995; the following one was Carmen Díaz Margarit, ''El surrealismo en "La flor de California" de José María Hinojosa'', Madrid 2003, {{ISBN|8466909451}}</ref> Since then his presence in history of literature is considered obligatory,<ref>"no cabe enganarse sobre su importancia" of a "minor poet", referred after Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, p. 178. The 1993 work of Pedraza and Rodriguez is credited for transferring Hinojosa from footnotes to the main text of literature history books, Felipe B. Pedraza, Milagros Rodríguez Cáceres, ''Manual Manuel de historia de literatura espanola'', vol. XI, Pamplona 1993, pp. 310-315</ref> based mostly on his presumed status of the first Spanish surrealist;<ref>de Lama 1997, p. 433, Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. 0-4; Neira claims that Hinojosa and not Larrea was the first Spanish surrealist and his 1924 Sueños was the first Spanish surrealist poem, Sánchez Rodríguez 1995, p. I-21</ref> However, in some cases he is denied membership in Generación del 27.<ref>in 1999 Centro Cultural Generación del 27 ignored Hinojosa during a conference commemorating the group, which in turn triggered protest letters, Ruiz Gisbert 2007, p. 197. Many manuals do not list Hinojosa as a member of Generation 27 or as a surrealist, compare e.g. a textbook ''La poesía surrealista en España. La Generación d 1927: características generales'', available [http://www.bielpidiovaldes.org/lengua/javier/temaspaeu/poesia_surrealista_spain_27.pdf here]</ref> In 1998 he was declared ''hijo predilecto'' by [[Málaga province]],<ref>''José María Hinojosa Lasarte: Tradición política y vanguardia artística'', [in:]'' El Matiner Carlí'' service 20.08.10, available [http://elmatinercarli.blogspot.com/2010/08/jose-maria-hinojosa-lasarte-tradicion-y.html here]</ref> the 2004 birth centenary produced several publications and events,<ref>including streets and plazas named after him</ref> and a 2012 study (instead of the typical "forgotten poet")<ref>Sánchez Rodríguez 2014, p. 174</ref> referred already to "a well-known Spanish poet".<ref>cover text in Jose Maria Hinojosa, ''Black Tulips: The Selected Poems of Jose Maria Hinojosa'', translated by [[Mark Statman]], New Orleans 2012, {{ISBN|9781608010882}}</ref> In 2014 he was dedicated a literary work.<ref>Alfonso Sánchez Rodríguez, ''El buzo y la aviadora'', Málaga 2014, {{ISBN|9788461694426}}. This theatrical piece is set up in prison, during the period preceding Hinojosa’s execution; he travels back in time, meeting his surrealist friends and re-enacting their common feasts; finally he meets Lorca, also incarcerated and also before his execution, both already at the doorstep of immortality, Cristobal G. Montilla, ''El vuelo imposible del poeta buzo y la aviadora'', [in:] ''El Mundo'' 30.05.14, available [http://www.elmundo.es/andalucia/2014/05/30/538863a822601dbb198b4573.html here]</ref> A Málaga school has been named after him.

Hinojosa's memory remains politically charged.<ref>Hinojosa's life and death are related not only to political discussions about himself, but also to debates on political implications of surrealism in general, as „wider concerns of the surrealist revolt opens up further issues related to the political orientation of Surrealism and of the path that Surrealism followed (for a while) with the communist party”, Rattray 2004, p. 47</ref> Some tackle the Hinojosa-Lorca parallelism<ref>both were almost peers, both were Andalusians, both formed the Málaga group of young writers, both in the early 1920s studied in Madrid, both joined the artistic avant-garde circle there, both were poets, both were scandalizers, both were surrealists, both demonstrated similar type of fragile sensitivity, both were considered members of Generación del 27, both were killed in August 1936 in close Andalusian locations</ref> declaring upfront that both were victims of "irrational hatred" produced by an "absurd war",<ref>Neira 1983, p. 29</ref> yet among countless books discussing the civil war terror, almost all mention Lorca and almost none mention Hinojosa.<ref>this is the case e.g. of a vastly popular and massively quoted study of Paul Preston, dedicated entirely to terror of the civil war; neither its English nor Spanish version mention Hinojosa while Lorca is discussed at length, Paul Preston, ''The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain'', London 2012, {{ISBN|9780393239669}} and Paul Preston, ''El holocausto español: Odio y exterminio en la Guerra Civil y después'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|9788499920498}}. Also works which discuss the longtime impact of civil war terror (with focus on historiography and culture) rather than the terror itself follow suit, see e.g. Peter Anderson, Miguel Ángel del Arco Blanco (eds.), ''Mass Killings and Violence in Spain, 1936–1952: Grappling with the Past'', London 2015, {{ISBN|9781135114855}}. Exceptions are works focused on Málaga, see e.g. Francisco Chica (ed.), ''Arcadia en llamas: República y Guerra civil en Málaga 1931–1937'', Málaga 2015, {{ISBN|9788415177449}}, p. 312. Some works dedicated to writers killed by the Republicans among tens of names do not list Hinojosa, see e.g. [https://www.religionenlibertad.com/intelectuales-asesinados-en-zona-roja-18562.htm here]</ref> Both right-wing and left-wing groups started to claim his legacy. Some Traditionalist sites honor him as "their man".<ref>see e.g. ''El Matiner Carlí'' service, available [http://elmatinercarli.blogspot.com/2010/08/jose-maria-hinojosa-lasarte-tradicion-y.html here], ''Santo Reino Tradicionalista'' service, available [http://santoreinotradicionalista.blogspot.com/2010/09/jose-maria-hinojosa-lasarte-tradicion.html here], ''Carlismo Andaluz'' service, available [http://carlismoandaluz.com/2015/10/10/la-pluralidad-en-el-carlismo/ here]</ref> Certain progressivist authors present him as a martyr who dedicated his life to fighting [[imperialism]], [[nationalism]] and [[Roman Catholicism|the church]];<ref>in one work Hinojosa is presented as "opposed to any ruling that imposes restrictions from above, like imperialism, or that restraints human desire, like the church, or that curtails the expansion of ideas, like nationalism, the poet offers the knowledge he achieves in his creative journey in the image of those open, wounded bodies palpitating and sharing with the outside world their vulnerable but vibrant humanity. It is uncanny that such an offering would become a reality when Hinojosa was killed in 1936", Candelas Gala, ''Creative cognition and the cultural panorama of twentieth-century Spain'', New York 2014, {{ISBN|9781137512260}}, see especially the chapter ''Creative Convulsion: José María Hinojosa and La Flor de Californía''</ref> others imply his homosexuality.<ref>Hinojosa’s poem is included in the anthology of Fredo Arias de la Canal, ''Primera Antología de la Poesía Homosexual'', Mexico 1997, p. 27. No scholar notes homosexual preferences of Hinojosa, moreover, some note that he felt uncomfortable in company of homosexual companions in Paris or Madrid</ref> The [[:es:Cementerio de San Rafael (Málaga)|Málaga San Rafael cemetery]], where Hinojosa was executed, was doted in 2014 with a monument-mausoleum to honor "those who gave their life in defense of freedom and democracy and whose remains rest here or in other sites".<ref>''Inaugurado el Panteón de la Memoria Histórica de Málaga'', [in:] ''La Opinion de Malaga'' 11.01.14, available [http://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/malaga/2014/01/11/inaugurado-panteon-memoria-historica-malaga/644615.html here]. Remains of all 3 Hinojosas were re-buried in a crypt of the Málaga cathedral, Neira 1983, p. 29</ref> Hinojosa has never been mentioned in a spate of press notes related,<ref>compare ''La Nueva España'' 11.01.14, available [http://www.lne.es/espana/2014/01/11/inaugurado-panteon-memoria-historica-malaga/1526176.html here], ''Europapress'' 06.01.14, available [http://www.europapress.es/andalucia/malaga-00356/noticia-panteon-san-rafael-memoria-fusilados-guerra-civil-inaugurara-sabado-20140106172941.html here], ''El Mundo'' 11.01.14, available [http://www.elmundo.es/andalucia/2014/01/11/52d1731422601d4d0e8b457b.html here], ''La Opinion de Malaga'' 11.01.14, available [http://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/malaga/2014/01/11/inaugurado-panteon-memoria-historica-malaga/644615.html here], ''Diario Sur'' 11.01.14, available [http://www.diariosur.es/20140111/local/malaga/mausoleo-recuerda-fusilados-tapias-201401111442.html here], ''El País'' 12.01.14, available [https://elpais.com/ccaa/2014/01/10/andalucia/1389385772_097392.html here]</ref> some of which noted a construction recording "la barbarie de la represión franquista".<ref>''El Mundo'' 11.01.14, available [http://www.elmundo.es/andalucia/2014/01/11/52d1731422601d4d0e8b457b.html here]</ref>
