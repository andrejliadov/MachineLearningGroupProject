He was the eldest of three children from the marriage of U.S. [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Joe Biden]] and his first wife, [[Neilia Hunter Biden]]. He served as the 44th [[Attorney General of Delaware]] and a Major in the [[Delaware Army National Guard]].

== Early life and family ==
{{further|Family of Joe Biden}}
Biden was born in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], the first son of future U.S. Senator and President-elect [[Joe Biden]] and his first wife, [[Neilia Hunter Biden|Neilia]]. On December 18, 1972, Beau Biden's mother and his 13-month-old sister Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping. Beau was just under four years old, and his brother [[Hunter Biden|Hunter]] was just under three years old. Both were in the car when the accident took place but survived with critical injuries. Beau suffered multiple broken bones while Hunter sustained injuries to his skull. They spent several months hospitalized, where their father was sworn into the U.S. Senate in January 1973.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/01/25/joe-biden-2019-profile-grief-beau-car-accident-224178|title=How Grief Became Joe Biden’s ‘Superpower’| first=Michael|last=Kruse|date=January 25, 2019|work=[[Politico]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://apnews.com/article/e5a1e70314eb44219448eeb850c65f1e|title=Biden’s prism of loss: A public man, shaped by private grief|first=Nancy|last=Benac| date=August 18, 2019|work=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/12/beau-biden-obit-213476|title=Remembering Beau Biden|first=Glenn|last=Thrush|work=[[Politico]]|date=December 29, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Ed Kee and Beau Biden (8411848851) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Delaware's Secretary of Agriculture Ed Kee and Biden in 2013]]

In his first bid for political office, Biden ran for [[Attorney General of Delaware]] in 2006. Biden's opponent was a veteran state prosecutor and Assistant U.S. Attorney, Ferris Wharton. Major issues in the campaign included the candidates' experience and proposed efforts to address sex offenders, Internet predators, senior abuse and domestic abuse. Biden won the election by approximately five percentage points.<ref>{{cite report |title=State of Delaware 2006 Election Results |publisher=State of Delaware |department=Delaware Department of Elections |page=2 |url=http://electionsncc.delaware.gov/2006g/2006_results_book.pdf |access-date=February 17, 2015 |date=November 7, 2006}}</ref>

After being elected, he appointed former Delaware Attorney General and International Judge [[Richard S. Gebelein]] as Chief Deputy Attorney General, and former assistant [[U.S. Attorney]] [[Richard G. Andrews]] was appointed as State Prosecutor. As Attorney General, Biden supported and enforced stronger registration requirements for sex offenders.<ref name="WMDT">{{cite news |title=Lawmakers Endorse Tougher Penalties On Sex Offenders |url=http://www.wmdt.com/topstory/topstory.asp?id=2640 |publisher=[[WMDT]] |date=March 29, 2007 |first=Nadia |last=Singh }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name="APNJ">{{cite news |title= Delaware's enhanced sex offender law starts |url= http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/local&id=5874960 |agency= [[Associated Press]] |work= [[The News Journal]] |date= January 7, 2008 |access-date= July 30, 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110521100755/http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news%2Flocal&id=5874960 |archive-date= May 21, 2011 |url-status= dead }}</ref>

Joe Biden resigned from the Senate following his [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]] to the vice presidency. Governor [[Ruth Ann Minner]] named former Joe Biden aide [[Ted Kaufman]] to fill the vacant seat, but Kaufman made it clear that he would not be a candidate in the [[United States Senate election in Delaware, 2010|2010 special election]]. It fueled speculation Beau would run at that time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/11/24/former-biden-advisor-senate-replacement-picked/#more-31280|title=Former Biden advisor picked as Senate replacement|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=May 31, 2015}}</ref> Biden's father stated after the announcement of Kaufman's appointment, "It is no secret that I believe my son, Attorney General, would make a great United States Senator just as I believe he has been a great attorney general. But Beau has made it clear from the moment he entered public life that any office he sought he would earn on his own....

In October 2009, Biden stated that he was considering a run for the Senate and that he would make a final decision in January. On January 25, Biden confirmed that he would forgo a Senate run so as to better focus on the prosecution of [[Earl Bradley]], a convicted serial child rapist.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/dcnow/2010/01/beau-biden-takes-a-pass-on-a-senate-run.html | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | title=Beau Biden takes a pass on a Senate run | date=January 25, 2010}}</ref>

On November 2, 2010, he was easily re-elected to a second term as Delaware Attorney General, beating [[Independent Party of Delaware]] candidate Doug Campbell by a large margin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.delaware.gov/results/html/election.shtml|title=State Of Delaware – Elections Results|publisher=delaware.gov|access-date=May 31, 2015}}</ref>
