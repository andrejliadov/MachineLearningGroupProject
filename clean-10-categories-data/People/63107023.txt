'''Aaron Ben David Hayyun''' was a 17th-century Rabbi and [[Kabbalist]]. Together with David Yitzchaki and Jacob Molko, he served as a [[Beth din|dayan]] in the Jerusalem rabbinate of [[Moshe ben Yonatan Galante|Moshe Galante]]. A decision by Hayyun concerning the dispute between Mordecai ha-Levi, chief rabbi of Cairo, and Judah Habillo, rabbi of Alexandria, is published in the former's ''Darke No'am'' on the Chosen Mishpat section of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' (Nos. 47, 48). He was the author of a commentary on the [[Zohar]], of which only a small part was published, under the title ''Machaneh Aharon'' (Leghorn, 1795).
