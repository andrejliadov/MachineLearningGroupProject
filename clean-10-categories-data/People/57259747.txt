'''Jorge Marcos Baradit Morales''' (born 11 June 1969) is a [[Chile]]an writer, the author of the bestselling trilogy ''Historia secreta de Chile'', a science fiction novel that depicts the main characters of Chilean history in a fantasy reality.

== Biography ==
Jorge Baradit spent his childhood and early adolescence in [[Valparaíso]], where he formed a [[punk rock]] band called Trato Bestial, which performed in underground concerts in [[Valparaíso Region]] from 1986 to 1991. Coming from a lower-middle-class family, he was educated in public schools and at the Rubén Castro school in [[Viña del Mar]]. He studied one year (1987–1988) of Architecture at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso]] and later Graphic Design (1988–1994) at [[Viña del Mar University]], where he graduated. He has been dedicated to literature since 2005.

== Literary career ==
=== Fiction ===
He debuted in literature with ''{{ill|Ygdrasil (novel)|es|Ygdrasil|lt=Ygdrasil}}'' (published in Spain in 2007), "a story set in a futuristic Mexico, where a Chilean mercenary named Mariana accepts the most dangerous missions that will take her through a digital form of hell. It shows a world full of organic technology taken to the limit, an [[imbunche]], dead soldiers who reincarnate as communication systems, and a shaman who orbits the Earth."<ref name=quite>{{Cite news |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/2007/11/14/281823/jorge-baradit-escritor-ya-no-es-posible-hacerle-el-quite-a-la-ciencia-ficcion.html |title=Jorge Baradit, escritor: 'Ya no es posible hacerle el quite a la ciencia ficción' |trans-title=Jorge Baradit, Writer: 'It is No Longer Possible to Do Science Fiction' |first=Alberto |last=Rojas M. |work=[[El Mercurio]] |location=Santiago |language=Spanish |date=14 November 2007 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref>

A year later he wrote a short prequel of ''Ygdrasil'', ''Trinidad'', for which he won the award of the [[Polytechnic University of Catalonia]].

Miquel Barceló, editor of the NOVA collection of [[Ediciones B]], in which both works appeared, described ''Ygdrasil'' as a "revolution in science fiction in Spanish",<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tauzero.org/2007/04/miquel-barcelo-en-chile/ |title=Miquel Barceló en Chile |first=Gabriel |last=Mérida |work=TauZero |language=Spanish |date=November 2006 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref> and characterized Baradit's writing as cyber-shamanism, a definition that is not to the Chilean's liking – "I prefer Magical Realism 2.0. Macondo already has fiber optic networks, but his shamans still take [[ayahuasca]]," he said at the time.<ref name=quite/>

From 2006 to 2008, he maintained the ''Ucronía Chile'' blog, a project that invited writers, illustrators, photographers, and videographers to twist Chilean history at any point and under any criteria.<ref name=atrapa>{{Cite web |url=https://www.guioteca.com/literatura-fantastica/%E2%80%9Cchil3-relacion-del-reyno%E2%80%9D-un-chile-ucronico-que-te-atrapa/ |title='CHIL3: Relación del Reyno': Un Chile ucrónico que te atrapa |trans-title='CHIL3: Relación del Reyno': A Chile Alternate History That Catches You |first=Matías |last=Bakit |work=Guioteca |language=Spanish |date=21 June 2011 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SRLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT85&lpg=PT85 |title=La patria insospechada.

Baradit published ''Synco'' in 2008 (in 2012 he began to work on a graphic version of the novel), an [[alternate history]] of democratic socialism that develops after 1973, with [[Augusto Pinochet]] appointed by [[Salvador Allende]] to replace General [[Carlos Prats]]. "It stops the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|military coup]], the socialist government consolidates and creates the first cybernetic state, a universal example, the true third way, a miracle."<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://diario.elmercurio.com/detalle/index.asp?id={a839867c-96ee-480f-adf1-c20192023048} |title=Synco: El juego del revés |trans-title=Synco: The Game of Reverse |first=Javier |last=Edwards Renard |work=[[El Mercurio]] Revista de Libros |language=Spanish |date=4 January 2009 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref> It is based on the unfinished [[Project Cybersyn]].

The following year ''Kalfukura'' appeared, which tells the story of a humble child who undertakes an odyssey throughout Chile to find a great ancestral treasure of metaphysical order. Unlike the typical style of Baradit, this book is closer to an [[Adventure fiction|adventure novel]] and is aimed at children and young people. About it, Baradit himself says, "I want to revive our myths, take them out of pedagogy and the museum and give them new life."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www2.latercera.com/noticia/jorge-baradit-relata-la-conquista-magica-de-america/ |title=Jorge Baradit relata la conquista mágica de América |trans-title=Jorge Baradit Relates the Magical Conquest of America |work=[[La Tercera]] |language=Spanish |date=16 October 2009 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref>

During the [[Santiago International Book Fair]] (FILSA), in November 2011, he launched his first graphic novel, ''Policía del karma'', drawn by Martín Cáceres,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ngichile.ning.com/profile/MartinCaceresR |title=Página de Martín Cáceres R. |publisher=NGI Chile |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817041448/http://ngichile.ning.com/profile/MartinCaceresR |archive-date=17 August 2009 |url-status=dead |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref> where he recounts the actions carried out by a dystopian police force in an alternative Santiago that pursues people for crimes committed in their previous lives. The work won the FIC Award for best cover, best writer, best cartoonist, and best comic of the year 2011.

In May 2012 he created, again with illustrations by Cáceres, ''Lluscuma'', a fantasy graphic novel with elements of alternative worlds, time travel, hallucinations, psychological violence, alternate history, and delirium, set in 1977, during the event known as the case of Corporal Valdés (a supposed [[alien abduction|abduction by extraterrestrials]]), and 2013 in the context of issues related to death and torture during the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|military dictatorship]] of General Augusto Pinochet. The work was published weekly in the print edition of the newspaper ''[[La Segunda]]'' from May to November 2012. The following year it was released in a book with the text "revised, corrected, expanded, and edited with the calm and care that only months of work in the laboratory can give."<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/magazine/2013/11/05/628250/nueva-novela-de-baradit.html |title=Jorge Baradit publica novela inspirada en la abducción del cabo Valdés |trans-title=Jorge Baradit Publishes Novel Inspired By the Abduction of Corporal Valdés |first=Alberto |last=Rojas |work=[[El Mercurio]] |location=Santiago |language=Spanish |date=5 November 2013 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref>

He launched his first book of short stories, ''La guerra interior'', in March 2017, in which he included 22 stories that span his career from 2003 to 2016 and that are a heterogeneous sample of his literary output.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://culto.latercera.com/2017/04/07/la-guerra-interior-nuevo-libro-jorge-baradit/ |title=La guerra interior, el nuevo libro de Jorge Baradit |trans-title=La guerra interior, the New Book By Jorge Baradit |first=Alejandra |last=Valenzuela |work=[[La Tercera]] Culto |language=Spanish |date=7 April 2017 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref>

Baradit has been identified with the renewal movement of Chilean literature called "Freak Power", which also comprises narrators such as the aforementioned Bisama, Ortega, Wilson, and Sergio Amira.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.tauzero.org/2008/12/el-dream-team-de-la-otra-literatura-nacional/ |title=La nueva literatura fantástica chilena: Freak power |trans-title=The New Chilean Fantasy Literature: Freak Power |first=Patricio |last=Jara |author-link=Patricio Jara |work=[[El Mercurio]] Sábado |language=Spanish |date=13 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207055415/http://www.tauzero.org/2008/12/el-dream-team-de-la-otra-literatura-nacional/ |archive-date=7 February 2009 |url-status=dead |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref> He has stood out for the use of digital tools and social networks in the development and diffusion of his works in different online, written, and audiovisual platforms, in collaboration with musicians, videographers, illustrators, and his own readers.

Published in July 2015, ''Historia secreta de Chile'' (Editorial Sudamericana) was the first volume of a trilogy<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/Espectaculos/2016/07/03/810722/Jorge-Baradit-Hay-un-interes-genuino-de-la-gente-por-aprender-de-la-historia-de-su-pais.html |title=Jorge Baradit lanza segundo tomo de su 'controversial' trilogía 'Historia secreta de Chile' |trans-title=Jorge Baradit Launches Second Volume of His 'Controversial' Trilogy 'Historia secreta de Chile' |first=Alberto |last=Rojas |work=[[El Mercurio]] |language=Spanish |date=4 July 2016 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref> on hidden or unknown aspects of official Chilean history.

However, the success of ''Historia secreta de Chile'' was not free from controversy – some historians criticized the quality of its documentation,<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.redseca.cl/jorge-baradit-la-apropiacion-del-saber-el-protagonismo-de-las-elites-y-el-ninguneo-docente/ |title=Jorge Baradit: la apropiación del saber, el protagonismo de las elites y el ninguneo docente |trans-title=Jorge Baradit: The Appropriation of Knowledge, the Prominence of the Elites, and the Education Belittlement |work=RedSeca |language=Spanish |date=30 May 2016 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref> while others such as the 2016 [[Chilean National History Award|National History Award]] winner {{ill|Julio Pinto Vallejos|es|lt=Julio Pinto}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.eldinamo.cl/cultpop/2016/08/23/premio-nacional-historia-jorge-baradit/ |title=Premio Nacional de Historia respalda fenómeno Baradit: 'Es positivo por el interés en la historia' |trans-title=National History Award Winner Supports Baradit Phenomenon: 'It's Positive Because of the Interest in History' |work=El Dínamo |language=Spanish |date=23 August 2016 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref> and the 2006 winner [[Gabriel Salazar]]<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=CNNChile |number=911052933252440065/ |title=Gabriel Salazar afirma que Jorge @baradit no toma solo lo anecdótico de la historia, sino que detrás hay 'un criterio crítico' |trans-title=Gabriel Salazar Affirms That Jorge @baradit Does Not Take Only Anecdotal History, But Behind it There is 'a Critical Criterion' |author=CNN Chile |author-link=CNN Chile |date=21 September 2017 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref> supported the publication. In the following two years Baradit released the remaining volumes of the trilogy, with covers as provocative as the first (which had portrayed [[Arturo Prat]] as a spiritualist figure, endowed with a third eye). The second showed [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] with dark glasses, emulating the famous photograph of Augusto Pinochet after the military coup, alluding to the fact that the [[Chilean War of Independence|independence]] leader was the country's first dictator. The third figure featured [[Gabriela Mistral]] with a tattoo reading "Doris", plus a piercing in her nose.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/noticias/cultura/literatura/jorge-baradit-publico-historia-secreta-de-chile-2/2016-06-28/132410.html |title=Jorge Baradit publicó 'Historia secreta de Chile 2' |trans-title=Jorge Baradit Publishes 'Historia secreta de Chile 2' |publisher=[[Radio Cooperativa]] |language=Spanish |date=28 June 2016 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://culto.latercera.com/2017/08/11/jorge-baradit-escritor-queria-contar-historias-ahora-firmo-autografos/ |title=Jorge Baradit, escritor: 'Yo quería contar historias y ahora firmo autógrafos' |trans-title=Jorge Baradit, Writer: 'I Wanted to Tell Stories and Now I Sign Autographs |first=Javier |last=García |work=[[La Tercera]] Culto |language=Spanish |date=11 August 2017 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref>

== Television ==
From 2015 to 2016, Baradit participated as a panelist of the nighttime series ''{{ill|Mentiras verdaderas (Chilean TV series)|es|Mentiras verdaderas (Chile)|lt=Mentiras verdaderas}}'' (broadcast by [[La Red (Chilean TV channel)|La Red]]), where he commented on various facts from the unofficial history of his country.

In 2017, he assumed the leadership of his own program: ''{{ill|Chile Secreto|es}}'', a hybrid between documentary and investigative series where he toured the country, reviewing historical facts hidden in the official history. Transmitted by [[Chilevisión]] (CHV), it premiered on 21 May ([[Navy Day (Chile)|Day of Naval Glories]]) with a chapter dedicated to the hero Arturo Prat, and was the leading broadcast in its timeslot – according to data delivered by CHV, between 7:59 and 9:00 pm it achieved an average of 9.5 [[Audience measurement|ratings]] points, followed by [[Mega (Chilean television channel)|Mega]] with 9.3 and [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]] with 9.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.publimetro.cl/cl/entretenimiento/2017/05/22/auspicioso-debut-chile-secreto-programa-jorge-baradit-se-estreno-liderando-rating.html |title=El auspicioso debut de 'Chile Secreto': Programa de Jorge Baradit se estrenó liderando el rating |trans-title=The Auspicious Debut of 'Chile Secreto': Jorge Baradit's Program Premiered Leading the Ratings |work=Publimetro |language=Spanish |date=22 May 2017 |access-date=27 April 2018}}</ref>
