'''Oba Efuntola Oseijeman Adelabu Adefunmi''' (born '''Walter Eugene King''', 5 October 1928 – 11 February 2005) was the first documented [[African-American]] initiated into the [[Priesthood#Polytheism|priesthood]] of the [[Yoruba religion]], who would then go on to become the first African-American to be crowned [[Oba (ruler)|''Oba'' (King)]] of the Yoruba of North America in Ile Ife, Nigeria.

==Biography==
King was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. King left the [[Baptist]] faith that he had been baptized into at the age of 12. He grew up with an interest in [[African culture]] and began [[African studies]] at the age of 16. At the age of 20, King traveled to [[Haiti]] in 1954 to study the Haitian culture and [[Haitian Vodou]] and, in 1955, to Europe and North Africa, often as a part of the [[Katherine Dunham|Katherine Dunham Dance Company]]. In 1959, just before the [[Cuban revolution]], he traveled to the [[Matanzas Province|Matanzas region]] of [[Cuba]] and became the first documented African-American to be initiated into the Yoruba priesthood of [[Obatala]], where he was named "Efuntola Oseijeman Adefunmi". ''Efuntola'' means "the whiteness (of Obatala) is as good as wealth (or honor)." ''Adefunmi'' means "the crown has given me this (child)."<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.oyotunji.org/history.html|website=www.oyotunji.org|accessdate=19 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822080620/http://www.oyotunji.org/history.html|archive-date=22 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Upon his return to the United States, he founded the Order of the Damballah Hwedo in Harlem New York, then the Shango Temple, and later incorporated the [[African Theological Archministry]]. That organization would come to be called the Yoruba Temple. In 1970, along with several other devotees, Oba Adefunmi created the [[Oyotunji]] village in [[Beaufort County, South Carolina]].<ref>http://www.oyotunji.com</ref>

Oba Adefunmi's [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] stance drew large criticism from within the ranks of the Cuban [[Santería]] priests because of his strident opposition to certain aspects of their religion, aspects which - he felt - did not keep with the traditional form of the Yoruba religion.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} This eventually led to his break from the Cuban form of Ifa (Santeria-Lukumi). To replace his former teachers, Adefunmi journeyed to [[Yorubaland]] in Africa, where he was welcomed and initiated as a ''[[babalawo]]'' in [[Ile-Ife]].

Adefunmi’s brother is Henri “Umbaji” King, who was one of the director’s of the North American Zone of [[FESTAC 77]], the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, which took place in Lagos, Nigeria.
