'''Conceptual character''' is a concept developed by French philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[FÃ©lix Guattari]]. The term denotes fictional, or semi-fictional, characters created by one or more authors to convey one or more ideas. Even if originally a historical individual may have existed, this individual was later instrumentalized by the authors. [[Michel Onfray]], in his ''Contre histoire de la philosophie'' ("Counter-history of philosophy"), regularly used this concept like most history of philosophy when explaining Plato's Symposium. Since Socrates never wrote, plato use his master in this book and put his word in his mouth. When you read it, you need to keep in mind you reed Plato, not Socrates.
