==Brain injury==
On December 17, 2008, Scott Bolzan slipped in the men's bathroom at his place of work.<ref name="PhoenixBiz">{{cite news|url=http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/09/28/story3.html?b=1254110400%5E2156121|title=Entrepreneur suffers from amnesia following fall|first=Chris|last=Casacchia|newspaper=[[Phoenix Business Journal]]|date=September 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Nightline">{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/amnesia-man-hits-head-loses-memories/story?id=10396719|title=Amnesia Man Hits Head Loses All Memories|publisher=[[ABC News]] [[Nightline]]|date=April 19, 2010}}</ref> He says his last "actual memory" was "my feet going above my head". The fall caused a severe [[concussion]]. Bolzan was initially told his [[memory loss]] was normal and temporary, but as months passed by and he still did not remember any part of his life before the fall, he revealed his condition to his wife and they sought help from [[neurologist]]s.

A [[SPECT scan]] of Bolzan's [[human brain|brain]] showed that he had no [[blood flow]] to his right [[temporal lobe]]&mdash;the part of the brain that stores [[long-term memory]]. Blood flow to the front of his brain on both sides is also dramatically reduced.<ref name="Nightline" /> He suffered brain [[atrophy]], which killed [[brain cells]] and damaged connections between them.<ref name="PhoenixBiz" /> The loss of blood flow caused Bolzan to suffer an unusually severe case of [[retrograde amnesia]]. Dr. Teresa Lanier, Bolzan's primary physician, has said "It would basically have to be a miracle for him to one day wake up and have complete and intact memory of everything he has lost. That's probably just never going to happen."<ref name="Nightline" />

Bolzan's wife has tried to help him remember parts of his life since his fall, showing him photographs of key events in his life in hopes of jogging his memory.<ref name="Nightline" /> Along with memories of his personal life, he has lost memories of historical events and basic [[interpersonal relationship]] concepts. He did not understand [[birthday]]s<ref name="PhoenixBiz" /> or the relationship between a [[husband]] and [[wife]].<ref name="Nightline" /> He had no reference points. He did, however, remember basic life tasks, like using [[eating utensil]]s and how to drive a car.<ref name="KPHO">{{cite news|url=http://www.kpho.com/news/22861673/detail.html|title=Amnesia Patient Shares Story Of Struggle|first=Cara|last=Liu|publisher=KPHO.com|date=March 16, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614060245/http://www.kpho.com/news/22861673/detail.html|archivedate=June 14, 2011}}</ref>

Scott has appeared on talk shows such as Dr. Phil, The View, Fox and Friends, Good Morning America, The Huckabee Show, The Doctors, Nightline, guest appearance on Couples Therapy. Scott has also been a guest on numerous syndicated radio shows and local news stations.

The New York Post published an article on October 9, 2011, reporting that a doctor who examined Bolzan after his fall stated that Bolzan was possibly "feigning his alleged memory deficits", explaining that it is questionable that an injury to one part of the brain could affect all the different memories distributed among the organ, while not damaging his cognitive abilities or his ability to form new memories. The article also cited other neurologists who, while having not examined Bolzan, stated that his amnesia violates fundamental knowledge of neurobiology, in that old memories are more resistant to brain damage than recent ones, in contrast to Bolzan's case.<ref>{{cite news |title=Memory 'loss' is hi$ gain |first=Susannah |last=Cahalan |authorlink=Susannah Cahalan |url=https://nypost.com/2011/10/09/memory-loss-is-hi-gain/ |newspaper=The New York Post |date=October 9, 2011 |accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref>
