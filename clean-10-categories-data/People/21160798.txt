==Impact on music==
Her work has influenced other artists such as well-known [[dubstep]] producer [[Bassnectar]], who heavily sampled ''5 A.M. Rinse (feat. MC Sphinx)'', the last song on her first album ''When Worlds Collide'' for his song ''Here We Go'' of his 2010 EP and single ''[[Timestretch (album)|Timestretch]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=iphoneunclockseattle|title=Bassnectar's Here We Go sample of 1.8.7 feat.

Additionally, [[electronic rock]] act [[Celldweller]] sampled "Wake Up" off of her first album as well as "San Francisco" off of her third album "The Cities Collection" in their 2013 song "Uncrowned".<ref>{{cite web|author=jordana|title=Celldweller samples Wake Up and San Francisco|url=https://www.facebook.com/JordanaDnB/posts/10152845170979815|work=WhoSampled|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}</ref> 

In 1999, Drum & Bass/Hip Hop producer and label owner Hive approached Jordana to remix her song ''Defcon-1'' also off of ''When Worlds Collide''. Hive's remix appears on his 2001 album ''The Raw Uncut''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hive – The Raw Uncut EP|url=http://www.discogs.com/Hive-The-Raw-Uncut-EP/release/70304|work=Discogs|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref> Jordana collaborated with [[Lady Sovereign]] on a song early in Sov's career after the two met through an internet chat room for StrikeFM.co.uk, an online radio station which Jordana had a show, and the now defunct UKGarageWorldwide.com forums. The two would later team up when Jordana under her Lady J alias, had Lady Sovereign MC for her radio show on [[Flex FM]] London.<ref name="MyUser_Https:_December_21_2015c">{{cite web|url=http://www.flexfm.net/site/index.php |title=Hot update {{!}} Welcome to the FLEX FM NETWORK |website=FLEX FM Network |date=May 19, 2002 |accessdate=December 21, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020601214235/http://www.flexfm.net/site/index.php |archivedate=June 1, 2002 }}</ref>

New Zealand based Dubstep and Drum & Bass producer Alexis K/Unsub has also cited Jordana as an influence and the two are collaborating on music and a possible tour.

==History==
She first came to the attention of the music industry when she was asked to remix Blondie's "Atomic." Her remix appeared along with [[Armand Van Helden]] and [[Sean Combs|Diddy]]’s remixes on the single.<ref name="Group1999"/> A little over a year following that release, Mac McFarlane, the promoter of the well established and legendary [[New York City]] club, Konkrete Jungle, contacted her to create a themed song for a CD compilation/mix-CD. Jordana created the song "Konkrete Jungle" for that purpose. Described by CMJ as containing "menacing hardstep attacks",<ref name="Inc.1998">{{cite journal|author=CMJ Network, Inc.|title=CMJ New Music Monthly|journal=CMJ New Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ikEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62|date=October 1998|publisher=CMJ Network, Inc.|pages=62–|issn=1074-6978}}</ref> it was released on the Ultra Records compilation, Konkrete Jungle - Maximum Drum & Bass, mixed by [[BBC Radio 1’]] Drum'n'Bass show host Jumping Jack Frost. Following extensive touring throughout North America and abroad as a music producer, [[Liquid Sky (band)|Liquid Sky Music]], an indie label distributed by Caroline Distribution signed her to a three-album contract in late 1996.

==Hate crime in Ohio==
On the night of February 22, 2000 in Kent, [[Ohio]], Jordana was attacked and brutally beaten in a transphobic hate crime by a group of men including Matthew Gostlin.<ref name="Maximum Rocknroll">{{cite book|title=Maximum Rocknroll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHVbAAAAMAAJ&q=%221.8.7%22+bass|year=2000|publisher=Maximum Rock 'n' Roll}}</ref> Gostlin and other assailants vaulted her in the parking lot outside of the Robin Hood nightclub where she had just performed on the Cities Collection tour. The attack took place while she was escorted from the event with the event promoter to the his car. The group of men attacked suddenly and Jordana lost consciousness almost immediately after being struck in the face. She suffered nerve damage to the lower part of her face from her lower lip down as a result. 
She was quoted, saying in the May 2000 issue of CMJ ''New Music Monthly'' that in the seconds just prior to the attack: "I saw his face. I remember the look on his face. It was this look of utter hate, like 'I'm going to kill you.'"<ref name="Inc.2000.4">{{cite journal|author=CMJ Network, Inc.|title=CMJ New Music Monthly|journal=CMJ New Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GioEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13|date=May 2000|publisher=CMJ Network, Inc.|pages=13|issn=1074-6978}}</ref> In an interview with the Village Voice following the attack, George Meesig, a man from Cleveland, Ohio who defended her during the attack, stated that Gostlin had misgendered her, saying “[t]his is personal”.<ref name="Voice2000" /> Other reports noted by the Village Voice on the message board for Breakbeat Science (a NYC based Drum'n'Bass record store) mentioned transphobic slurs being shouted during the attack. She subsequently cancelled the tour to recover.<ref name="Maximum Rocknroll"/> Gostlin, while charged, was never arrested nor spent any time in court. Her family was told by the Portage County (Ohio) prosecutor's office that attempts had been made to serve the warrant but Gostlin's whereabouts were unknown. As a result of no movement on the case by the authorities, she felt that justice would not be served. She left the United States for [[England]] because of their concerns about personal safety and well-being.

==Additional work in music industry==
In addition to music production, Jordana is also a DJ, musician and singer. From 2001 to 2002, she worked at Flex FM in [[London]], England as Lady J, with [[Lady Sovereign]] performing for her during her radio show.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ukmusic.com/forum/chit-chat/lock-in-to-flex-fm-2nite-10911.html|title = Lock in to FLex FM 2nite|last = Sovereign|first = Lady|date = May 18, 2002|work = ukmusic.com/|accessdate = May 30, 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140810062924/http://www.ukmusic.com/forum/chit-chat/lock-in-to-flex-fm-2nite-10911.html|archive-date = August 10, 2014|url-status=dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref> In 2002, she held a club residency performing UK garage, 2-step garage and house music at the club Trinity in London's Vauxhall neighborhood.

After returning to the United States, Jordana has returned to her rock genre and fronted a goth metal band in Seattle. Just prior to that, she was asked to play bass in another band briefly where she met and became close friends with singer/songwriter Shelita Burke.

In 2016, Jordana appeared in the documentary, ''Free CeCe,'' produced and directed by Jacqueline Gares and actress [[Laverne Cox]]. The documentary details the struggles of [[CeCe McDonald]], an African-American transwoman who was wrongfully incarcerated for murder for defending herself against a hate driven attack on her life outside of a bar in Minneapolis.<ref name="MyUser_Https:_December_21_2015c.2">{{cite web |url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/free-cece-post-production-campaign#/updates |title=FREE CeCe!

==Literary mentions==
She has been featured in several books. Her success in rising from the depressed girl of a "rust belt" city to MTV-featured electronic music artist garnered a mention in the 2002 [[The New York Times]] bestseller "[[The Rise of the Creative Class]]" by economist [[Richard Florida]].
