==Roman emperors==
*[[Tiberius]] (42 BC–37 AD, ruled 14–37 AD). While Tiberius was in his later years in [[Capri]], rumours abounded as to what exactly he was doing there. Historian [[Suetonius]] records the rumours of lurid tales of sexual perversity, including graphic depictions of child molestation, cruelty, and especially paranoia. While heavily sensationalised, Suetonius' stories at least paint a picture of how Tiberius was perceived by the Roman senatorial class, and what his impact on the Principate was during his 23 years of rule.
*Gaius [[Caligula]] (12–41 AD, ruled 37–41). Contemporary author [[Philo of Alexandria]] recorded that he fell ill soon after becoming emperor, and his subsequent reign was marked by shocking extremes of paranoia, cruelty and megalomania.<ref>Philo, ''On the Embassy to Gaius''</ref> [[Seneca the Younger]], who once fell foul of Caligula, confirmed his erratic behavior in passing.<ref>Seneca, ''Of Consolation, to Polybius''</ref> His successor [[Claudius]] neither condemned nor defended his memory, and later historians continued to describe his madness.
*[[Justin II]] (c. 520–578, ruled 15 November 565–574). [[John of Ephesus]], who suffered theological persecution under Justin, wrote that his "mind was agitated and darkened" such that he behaved at times like a wild animal. On the advice of his wife [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]] and the [[Byzantine Senate|Senate]], he adopted the general [[Tiberius II Constantine]] as his son and delegated state authority to him.<ref>John of Ephesus, [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ephesus_3_book3.htm ''Ecclesiastical History'', Part 3, Book 3]</ref>

==European monarchs==
*[[Charles VI of France]] (1368–1422; ruled 1380–1422), known as ''Charles le Fou'' ("Charles the Mad"), suffered from bouts of psychosis, including [[glass delusion]].<ref name="Tuchman">{{cite book | last = Tuchman | first = Barbara | authorlink = Barbara Tuchman| title = A Distant Mirror | publisher= Ballantine Books | date = 1978| location = New York | pages =  | isbn = 0-345-30145-5}}</ref>{{rp|514–516}}
*[[Henry VI of England]] (1421–1471; ruled 1422–1461 and 1470–1471).<ref name=Tuchman/>{{rp|586}} A breakdown in 1453 caused him to neglect state affairs for more than a year. A Lord Protector was appointed on that and two subsequent occasions to govern the kingdom. The ensuing succession struggles gave rise to the [[Wars of the Roses]].
*[[Joanna of Castile]] (1479–1555; ruled 1504–1555), known as ''Juana la Loca'' ("Joanna the Mad"), is believed by historians to have suffered from [[melancholia]], [[psychosis]] or [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=gomez>{{Citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=shpVyhetbC4C |author1=María A.

*[[Eric XIV of Sweden]] (1533–1577; ruled 1560–1568).

Eric himself stabbed [[Nils Svantesson Sture]] to death.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dahlström|first1=G.|last2=Swahn|first2=J-Ö|title=Bra Böckers Lexikon Book nr 7|publisher=Bra Böcker AB.|date=1984}}</ref>

*[[George III of the United Kingdom]] (1738–1820; ruled 1760–1820) exhibited signs of mental disorder, in the form of [[Logorrhea (psychology)|logorrhea]], as early as 1788.

*[[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] (1845–1886; ruled 1864–1886) irritated his ministers with his uncontrolled spending on magnificent castles. With no end in sight, they arranged for a panel of psychiatrists to declare him insane and installed his uncle as regent. Although the ministers were motivated by political concerns, medical explanations have been offered that include [[frontotemporal dementia]], [[schizotypal personality disorder]] and [[Pick's disease]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hacker|first1=R|last2=Seitz|first2=M|last3=Förstl|first3=H|title=Ludwig II. von Bayern – schizotype Persönlichkeit und frontotemporale Degeneration?|journal=Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift|date=October 2007|volume=132|issue=40|pages=2096–2099|doi=10.1055/s-2007-985648|pmid=17899506}}</ref><ref name = "King1996">

*[[Emperor Taishō]] (大正天皇, Taishō-tennō, 31 August 1879 – 25 December 1926) of Japan, suffered from a variety of neurological disorders, which though at least partially physical in origin incorporated psychological elements as well. Discussion or criticism of an emperor, including that of health issues, remains a controversial subject in Japan for cultural, political, and religious reasons and is referred to as the [[Chrysanthemum taboo]].<ref>[Herbert Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan''.
