'''Jeanne Louise Calment''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒan lwiz kalmɑ̃|lang}}; 21 February 1875 – 4 August 1997) was a French [[supercentenarian]] from [[Arles]], and the [[oldest people|oldest human]] whose age was well-documented, with a lifespan of 122 years and 164 days.<ref name=NYTimesDeath /> Her longevity attracted media attention and medical studies of her health and lifestyle.

According to census records, Calment outlived both her daughter and grandson.<ref name=validation /> In 1988, at age 112, she was widely reported to have been the oldest living person, and in 1995, at age 120, was declared the oldest person to have ever lived up to that point.<ref name=SunJournal /> During her life and after her death, medical researchers have taken many studies into her health and lifestyle, and how it may have affected her statistically anomalous age. Conversely, some researchers have challenged Calment's extreme age due to statistical unlikelihood, and have examined the possibility that her daughter Yvonne may have assumed Calment's identity in 1934.<ref name=rejuvenation /> Other researchers have dismissed this hypothesis on the basis of extensive prior research into Calment's life.<ref name=Rosenberg /> 

== Early life ==
[[File:Acte de naissance de Jeanne Calment.png|thumb|right|upright=1.14|[[Birth certificate]] of Jeanne Louise Calment]]

She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan: her brother lived to the age of 97, her father to 93, and her mother to 86.<ref name=validation />

From the age of seven until her [[first communion]], she attended Mrs Benet's church primary school in Arles, and then the local ''collège'' ([[secondary school]]), finishing at 16 with the ''brevet classique'' diploma ([[O-level]]). Asked about her daily routine while at [[primary school]], she replied that "when you are young, you get up at eight o'clock". In lieu of a solid breakfast, she would have either coffee with milk, or hot chocolate, and at noon her father would pick her up from school to have lunch at home before she returned to school for the afternoon. In the following years, she continued to live with her parents, awaiting marriage, painting, and improving her piano skills.<ref name=Allard1998>{{cite book |first1=Michel |last1=Allard |first2=Victor |last2=Lèbre |first3=Jean-Marie |last3=Robine |first4=Jeanne |last4=Calment |year=1998 |title=Jeanne Calment: From Van Gogh's Time to Ours, 122 Extraordinary Years |publisher=[[W.H.

In 1965, aged 90 and with no heirs left, Calment signed a [[life estate]] contract on her apartment with [[notary public]] André-François Raffray, selling the property in exchange for a right of occupancy and a monthly revenue of 2,500 [[French franc|franc]]s (€380) until her death. Raffray died in 1995, by which time Calment had received more than double the apartment's value from him, and his family had to continue making payments.

Calment claimed to reporters that she had met Van Gogh at that time, introduced to him by her (future) husband in her uncle's shop. She remembered the meeting as a disappointment, and described him as ugly and "very disagreeable", adding that he "reeked of alcohol".<ref name=NYTimesDeath /><ref name=mccook>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VqEgAAAAIBAJ&pg=6026%2C3313956 |title=World's oldest person dead |work=[[McCook Daily Gazette]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |page=1 |date=4 August 1997 |access-date=5 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite video |url=http://boutique.ina.fr/video/CAB89003100/jeanne-calment-114-and-a-rencontre-van-gogh.fr.html |title=Jeanne Calment, 114 ans, a rencontré Van Gogh |lang=fr |trans-title=Jeanne Calment, 114, met Van Gogh |work=[[Antenne 2]] |publisher=[[Institut national de l'audiovisuel]] |date=21 January 1989 |access-date=26 November 2011}}</ref> She was recognised by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the world's oldest living person when she was 112.<ref name=Guinness>{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/60at60/2015/8/1988-oldest-living-human-being-of-all-time-392901 |title=1988: Oldest Living Human Being of All Time |publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |first=Rob |last=Dimery |date=18 August 2015 |access-date=9 January 2019}}</ref> At the age of 114, she briefly appeared in the 1990 documentary film ''[[Vincent and Me]]'', walking outside and answering questions.<ref name=Guinness /> Her profile further increased when ''Guinness'' named her the oldest person ever in 1995.<ref name=SunJournal>{{cite news |first=Ronda |last=Addy |title=Life Expectancy |url=http://www.sunjournal.com/index.php?t=8&storyid=267178&subpub=118 |work=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Sun Journal]] |date=25 May 2008 |access-date=6 August 2008 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090201092634/http://www.sunjournal.com/index.php?t=8&storyid=267178&subpub=118 |archive-date=1 February 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Far exceeding any other verified human lifespan, Calment was widely reckoned the best-documented supercentenarian ever recorded. For example, she was listed in fourteen census records, beginning in 1876 as a one-year-old infant.<ref name=validation /> After Calment's death, at 122 years and 164 days, 116-year-old [[Marie-Louise Meilleur]] became the oldest validated living person. Several [[longevity claims|claims to have surpassed Calment's age]] were made, but no such case was proven.

=== Age verification ===
In 1994, the city of Arles inquired about Calment's personal documents, in order to contribute to the city archives. However, reportedly on Calment's instructions, her documents and family photographs were selectively burned by a distant family member, Josette Bigonnet, a cousin of her grandson.<ref name=Zak /> The verification of her age began in 1995 when she turned 120, and was conducted over a full year. She was asked questions about documented details concerning relatives, and about people and places from her early life, for instance teachers or maids. A great deal of emphasis was put on a series of documents from population censuses, in which Calment was named from 1876 to 1975. The family's membership in the local Catholic ''[[bourgeoisie]]'' helped researchers find corroborating chains of documentary evidence. Calment's father had been a member of the city council, and her husband owned a large drapery and clothing business. The family lived in two apartments located in the same building as the store, one for Calment, her husband and his mother, one for their daughter Yvonne, her husband and their child. Several house servants were registered in the premises as well.<ref name=validation />

=== Popular media reports ===
[[Apocryphal]] media articles reported varying details, some of them unlikely. One report claimed that Calment recalled selling coloured pencils to [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]], and seeing the [[Eiffel Tower]] being built.<ref name="Deseret19950221">{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CL4RAAAAIBAJ&pg=1584,3192209 |title=World's oldest person marks 120 beautiful, happy years |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=21 February 1995 |access-date=3 April 2010}}</ref> Another wrote that she started fencing in 1960, aged 85.<ref name=CNN /> Calment reportedly ascribed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance for her age to a diet rich in [[olive oil]].<ref name=mccook />

The team presented evidence to support Calment's age—including multiple official documents, census data, and photographic evidence—and also argued that it was indeed statistically possible to reach Calment's age. The authors criticised the advocates of the identity switch hypothesis, and called for a retraction of Zak's article.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Robine | first1 = Jean-Marie | last2 = Allard | first2 = Michel | last3 = Herrmann | first3 = François R. | last4 = Jeune | first4 = Bernard | title = The Real Facts Supporting Jeanne Calment as the Oldest Ever Human | journal = The Journals of Gerontology: Series A | volume = 74 | pages = S13–S20 | date = 2019 | issue = Suppl_1 | doi = 10.1093/gerona/glz198 | pmid = 31529019 }}</ref>

In February 2020, Zak and Philip Gibbs published an assessment applying [[Bayes' theorem]] to the question of her authenticity, claiming "a 99.99% chance of an identity switch in the case of Mme Calment".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nikolay Zak, Philip Gibbs|url=https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/rej.2019.2227|title=A Bayesian Assessment of the Longevity of Jeanne Calment|work=Rejuvenation Research|date=Feb 2020|pages=3-16}}</ref> François Robin-Champigneul and Robert Young commented on Zak's and Gibbs' findings, Robin-Champigneul noting that it "appears to be in fact a subjective and nonrigorous analysis" and Young that "[i]gnoring the actual facts of the case and stringing together opinions in a 'Bayesian' analysis are to merely misuse a mathematical tool". Young found that "a very solid case that Jeanne was 122 years has already been made" but that biosampling still was needed to test "for biomarkers of extraordinary longevity". Robin-Champigneul found that "the hypothesis of an identity swap with her daughter appears not even realistic given the context and the facts, and not supported by evidence".<ref>{{cite journal|author=François Robin-Champigneul|url=https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/rej.2019.2298|title=Jeanne Calment's Unique 122-Year Life Span: Facts and Factors; Longevity History in Her Genealogical Tree|work=Rejuvenation Research|date=Feb 2020|pages=19-47}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Robert Young|url=https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/rej.2020.2303|title=If Jeanne Calment Were 122, That Is All the More Reason for Biosampling|work=Rejuvenation Research|date=Feb 2020|pages=48-64}}</ref>

== Health and lifestyle ==
Calment's remarkable health presaged her later record. On television she stated ''J'ai jamais été malade, jamais, jamais'' (I have never been ill, never ever).<ref name="Mise au Point">{{cite video |title=Comme si c'était hier: Jeanne Calment |url=http://www.rts.ch/video/emissions/mise-au-point/5931633-comme-si-c-etait-hier-jeanne-calment.html |work=Mise Au Point |publisher=[[Radio Télévision Suisse]] |date=15 June 2014 |access-date=2 December 2016}}</ref> At age 20, incipient [[cataract]]s were discovered when she suffered a major episode of [[conjunctivitis]].<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|22–42}} She married at 21, and her husband's wealth allowed her to live without ever working.

After her brother, her son-in-law and her grandson died in 1962–63, Calment had no remaining family members. She lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a [[nursing home]].<ref name=validation /> Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused [[frostbite]] to her hands.<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|4–21}} According to one of her doctors, she had been quite healthy until she moved to the nursing home, and only began showing signs of aging during her stay.<ref name=France2DrLevraud>{{cite news | title=France 2 Interview with Dr Catherine Levraud, Medical Doctor Treating Jeanne Calment| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXTRD50auOE| work=France 2 television| date=4 August 1997| access-date=6 December 2016}}</ref>

=== Daily routine ===
After her admission to the ''Maison du Lac'' nursing home in January 1985, aged 109, Calment initially followed a highly ritualised daily routine. She requested to be awoken at 6:45{{nbsp}}am, and started the day with a long prayer at her window, thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting. She sometimes loudly asked the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one alive in her family. Seated on her armchair, she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands, then the legs. Nurses noted that she moved faster than other residents who were 30 years younger. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk and [[rusk]]s.

She washed herself unassisted with a [[flannel]] cloth rather than taking a shower, applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed ''daube'' ([[braising|braised beef]]) but was not keen on boiled fish. She had dessert with every meal, and said that given a choice she would eat fried and spicy foods instead of the bland foods on the menu.<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|85–92}} She made herself daily fruit salads with bananas and oranges. She enjoyed chocolate, sometimes indulging in a kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb) per week.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.fr/120-Jeanne-Calment-Doyenne-lhumanit%C3%A9/dp/B00C3CEMB6 |title=Les 120 ans de Jeanne Calment, doyenne de l'humanité |language=fr |trans-title=Jeanne Calment's 120 years, humanity's elder |first1=Michel |last1=Allard |first2=Victor |last2=Lèbre |first3=Jean-Marie |last3=Robine |publisher=Le Cherche-Midi |location=Paris |year=1994 |page=92 |isbn=978-2-862743462 |quote=More than once, she surprised her entourage by her digestive abilities; she said herself 'I have the stomach of an ostrich!' which did not prevent her from appreciating good things.

In the afternoon, she would take a nap for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall, she would dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her poor eyesight preventing her from enjoying her crosswords pastime), smoke a last cigarette and go to bed at 10:00{{nbsp}}pm.<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|4–21}}<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|85–92}} On Sundays she went to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], and on Fridays to [[Vespers]], and regularly conversed with and sought help from God, and wondered about the afterlife.<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|107–112}}

=== Medical follow-up ===
Medical student Georges Garoyan published a thesis on Calment when she was 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine, and the second presents her medical history. She stated that she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember which vaccine(s). Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken any medicine, not even herbal teas. She did not contract [[German measles]], [[chickenpox]], or urinary infections, and was not prone to hypertension or diabetes. In April 1986, aged 111, she was sent to hospital for [[heart failure]] and treated with [[digoxin]]. Later she suffered from [[arthropathy]] in the ankles, elbows, and wrists, which was successfully treated with [[anti-inflammatory]] medication. Her arterial blood pressure was 140mm/70mm, her pulse 84/min. Her height was {{cvt|150|cm|ftin}}, and her weight {{cvt|45|kg}}, showing little variation from previous years. She scored well on mental tests, except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events.

Analysis of her blood samples were in [[reference ranges for blood tests|normal range]]s between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the [[HLA system]] revealed the presence of the [[HLA-DR1|DR1 allele]], common among centenarians. A cardiological assessment revealed a moderate left [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] hypertrophy with a mild left [[atrial]] dilatation and [[premature heart beat|extrasystolic arrhythmia]]. Radiology revealed diffuse [[osteoporosis]], as well as incipient [[osteoarthritis]] in the right hip. An ultrasound exam showed no anomalies of internal organs.<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|22–42}} At this stage, Calment was still in good health, and continued to walk without a cane.<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|22–42}} She fell in January 1990 (aged 114) and fractured her [[femur]], which required surgery.<ref name=validation /> Subsequently, Calment used a wheelchair,<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|1–13}} and she abandoned her daily routine.<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|85–92}}

At the age of 115, Calment attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with her attending doctor, Dr. Victor Lèbre, to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. According to their year-long analysis, Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to undergo a routine operation to restore her eyesight; she had a moderately weak heart, a chronic cough ("caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco"), and bouts of [[rheumatism]]. On the other hand, her digestion was always good, she slept well, and did not have [[urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. During the last years, she was {{cvt|137|cm|ftin}} tall, and weighed {{cvt|40|kg}}; she confirmed that she had always been small, and had lost weight in recent years. Her eyes were [[eye color|light grey]], and her [[human hair color#Gray and white hair|white hair]] had once been chestnut brown.<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|1–13}}

At the age of 118, she was submitted to repeated neurophysiological tests and a [[CT scan]]. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency were comparable to those of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. [[Frontal lobe|Frontal brain lobe]] functions were relatively spared from deterioration, and there was no evidence of progressive [[neurological disease]], depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was observed to improve slightly over the six-month period.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ritchie |first1=Karen |institution=[[INSERM]] |title=Mental status examination of an exceptional case of longevity: J.

=== Supercentenarian clinical study ===
Bertrand Jeune, Robine, and other researchers compared Jeanne Calment with nearly 20 people worldwide who had been verified to have reached at least 115 years of age. They concluded that the lives of these people differed widely and that they had just a few common traits: most of them were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. They all had exhibited strong characters, but not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical fitness declined markedly, especially after age 105. In their final years, they required wheelchairs and were nearly blind and deaf. "But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end."<ref>{{cite book | title=Jeanne Calment and her successors.
