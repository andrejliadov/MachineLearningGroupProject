==Early life and childhood==
Walcott was born and raised in [[Castries]], [[Saint Lucia]], in the [[West Indies]], the son of Alix (Maarlin) and Warwick Walcott.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mayer |first=Jane |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/02/09/the-islander |title=The Islander |work=The New Yorker |date=9 February 2004 |accessdate=20 March 2017}}</ref> He had a twin brother, the playwright [[Roderick Walcott]], and a sister, Pamela Walcott. His family is of English, Dutch and African descent, reflecting the complex colonial history of the island that he explores in his poetry. His mother, a teacher, loved the arts and often recited poetry around the house.<ref Name="Paris Review">[[Edward Hirsch]], [http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2719/the-art-of-poetry-no-37-derek-walcott "Derek Walcott, The Art of Poetry No. 37"], ''[[The Paris Review]]'', Issue 101, Winter 1986.</ref> His father was a [[civil servant]] and a talented painter. He died when Walcott and his brother were one year old, and were left to be raised by their mother. Walcott was brought up in Methodist schools. His mother, who was a teacher at a Methodist elementary school, provided her children with an environment where their talents could be nurtured.<ref>Puchner, Martin. The Norton Anthology of World Literature. 4th ed., f, W.W. Norton & Company, 2013.</ref> Walcott's family was part of a minority Methodist community, who felt overshadowed by the dominant Catholic culture of the island established during French colonial rule.<ref name=Grimes>{{cite news|last1=Grimes|first1=William|title=Derek Walcott, Poet and Nobel Laureate of the Caribbean, Dies at 87|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/books/derek-walcott-dead-nobel-prize-literature.html|accessdate=18 March 2017|work=The New York Times|date=17 March 2017}}</ref>

As a young man Walcott trained as a painter, mentored by [[Harold Simmons (folklorist)|Harold Simmons]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stluciafolk.org/folkPersonalities/view/18|title=Harold Simmons|publisher=Folk Research Centre|location=St Lucia}}</ref> whose life as a professional artist provided an inspiring example for him.  Walcott greatly admired [[Cézanne]] and [[Giorgione]] and sought to learn from them.<ref name="Paris Review" /> Walcott's painting was later exhibited at the [[Anita Shapolsky Gallery]] in New York City, along with the art of other writers, in a 2007 exhibition named ''The Writer's Brush: Paintings and Drawing by Writers''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-writers-brush/|title=The Writer's Brush|date=16 December 2007|publisher=CBS News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anitashapolskygallery.com/past_exhibits_writers.html|title=The Writer's Brush; September 11 – October 27, 2007|work=Anita Shapolsky Gallery|location=New York City|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201060315/http://www.anitashapolskygallery.com/past_exhibits_writers.html|archivedate=1 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

He studied as a writer, becoming "an elated, exuberant poet madly in love with English" and strongly influenced by modernist poets such as [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Ezra Pound]].<ref name=pf/> Walcott had an early sense of a vocation as a writer. In the poem "Midsummer" (1984), he wrote:

<blockquote><poem>
Forty years gone, in my island childhood, I felt that 
the gift of poetry had made me one of the chosen, 
that all experience was kindling to the fire of the Muse.<ref name="Paris Review" /></poem></blockquote>

At 14, Walcott published his first poem, a [[John Milton|Miltonic]], religious poem, in the newspaper ''The Voice of St Lucia''. An English Catholic priest condemned the Methodist-inspired poem as blasphemous in a response printed in the newspaper.<ref name="Paris Review" /> By 19, Walcott had self-published his first two collections with the aid of his mother, who paid for the printing: ''25 Poems'' (1948) and ''Epitaph for the Young: XII Cantos'' (1949).  He sold copies to his friends and covered the costs.<ref Name="Academy">[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/220 "Derek Walcott"], Academy of American Poets.</ref> He later commented:

<blockquote>I went to my mother and said, "I’d like to publish a book of poems, and I think it's going to cost me two hundred dollars." She was just a seamstress and a schoolteacher, and I remember her being very upset because she wanted to do it. Somehow she got it—a lot of money for a woman to have found on her salary. She gave it to me, and I sent off to [[Trinidad]] and had the book printed. When the books came back I would sell them to friends. I made the money back.<ref name="Paris Review" /></blockquote>

The influential Bajan poet [[Frank Collymore]] critically supported Walcott's early work.<ref name="Paris Review" />

After getting his high school education from St. Mary's College, he received a scholarship to study at the [[University College of the West Indies]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica]].<ref Name="British Council">{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=authC2D9C28A0a4dc1BE88LsX2F7F9A1|title=Derek Walcott – British Council Literature|author=British Puchner, Martin.

==Career ==
[[File:Derek Walcott, VIII Festival Internacional.jpg|thumb|Derek Walcott, VIII Festival Internacional, 1992]]
After graduation, Walcott moved to Trinidad in 1953, where he became a critic, teacher and journalist.<ref Name="British Council"/> He founded the [[Trinidad Theatre Workshop]] in 1959 and remained active with its board of directors.<ref Name="Academy"/><ref name=als>{{cite news|last1=Als|first1=Hilton|title=Derek Walcott – a mighty poet has fallen|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/derek-walcott-a-mighty-poet-has-died|accessdate=18 March 2017|work=The New Yorker|date=17 March 2017}}</ref>

Exploring the Caribbean and its history in a colonialist and post-colonialist context, his collection ''In a Green Night: Poems 1948–1960'' (1962) attracted international attention.<ref Name=pf/> His play ''[[Dream on Monkey Mountain]]'' (1970) was produced on NBC-TV in the United States the year it was published. Makak is the protagonist in this play; and "Makak‟s condition represents the condition of the colonized natives under the oppressive forces of the powerful colonizers".<ref>Islam, Md. Manirul.(April' 2019). "Derek Walcott's ''Dream on Monkey Mountain'': A Complicated Presentation of Postcolonial Condition of the West Indians".

He was hired as a teacher by [[Boston University]] in the United States, where he founded the [[Boston Playwrights' Theatre]] in 1981. That year he also received a [[MacArthur Foundation Fellowship]] in the United States.  Walcott taught literature and writing at Boston University for more than two decades, publishing new books of poetry and plays on a regular basis. Walcott retired from his position at Boston University in 2007. He became friends with other poets, including the Russian expatriate [[Joseph Brodsky]], who lived and worked in the U.S. after being exiled in the 1970s, and the Irishman [[Seamus Heaney]], who also taught in Boston.<ref name=als/>

Walcott's epic poem ''[[Omeros]]'' (1990), which loosely echoes and refers to characters from the ''[[Iliad]]'', has been critically praised as his "major achievement."<ref name=pf/> The book received praise from publications such as ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', which chose ''Omeros'' as one of its "Best Books of 1990".<ref>{{cite news|title=Editors' Choice: The Best Books of 1990|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/books/editors-choice-the-best-books-of-1990.html|accessdate=18 March 2017|work=The New York Times|date=2 December 1990}}</ref>. 

Walcott was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1992, the second Caribbean writer to receive the honour after [[Saint-John Perse]], who was born in [[Guadeloupe]], received the award in 1960. The Nobel committee described Walcott's work as "a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment".<ref name=pf/> He won an [[Anisfield-Wolf Book Award]]<ref name="anisfield-wolf.org"/> for Lifetime Achievement in 2004.

His later poetry collections include ''Tiepolo's Hound'' (2000), illustrated with copies of his watercolors;<ref>[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5936 "Derek Walcott's ''Tiepolo’s Hound''"], essay, Academy of American Poets, 18 February 2005.</ref> ''The Prodigal'' (2004), and ''White Egrets'' (2010), which received the T.S.

===Themes===
[[Methodism]] and spirituality have played a significant role from the beginning in Walcott's work. He commented: "I have never separated the writing of poetry from prayer. I have grown up believing it is a [[vocation]], a religious vocation." Describing his writing process, he wrote: "the body feels it is melting into what it has seen… the 'I' not being important. That is the ecstasy...Ultimately, it's what [[Yeats]] says: 'Such a sweetness flows into the breast that we laugh at everything and everything we look upon is blessed.' That’s always there. It’s a benediction, a transference. It’s gratitude, really. The more of that a poet keeps, the more genuine his nature."<ref name="Paris Review" /> He also notes, "if one thinks a poem is coming on...you do make a retreat, a withdrawal into some kind of silence that cuts out everything around you. What you’re taking on is really not a renewal of your identity but actually a renewal of your anonymity."<ref name="Paris Review" />

===Influences===
Walcott said his writing was influenced by the work of the American poets, [[Robert Lowell]] and [[Elizabeth Bishop]], who were also friends.<ref name="Paris Review" />

===Playwriting===
He published more than twenty plays, the majority of which have been produced by the [[Trinidad Theatre Workshop]] and have also been widely staged elsewhere. Many of them address, either directly or indirectly, the liminal status of the West Indies in the post-colonial period.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72B3hZjp_LoC&q=derek+walcott+paradoxes+postcolonial&pg=PA22|title=Postcolonial Paradoxes in French Caribbean Writing: Césaire, Glissant, Condé|last=Suk|first=Jeannie|date=17 May 2001|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=9780191584404|language=en}}</ref> Through poetry he also explores the paradoxes and complexities of this legacy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nidhi|first=Mahajan|date=1 January 2015|title=Cultural Tensions and Hybrid Identities in Derek Walcott's Poetry|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1141/cultural-tensions-and-hybrid-identities-in-derek-walcotts-poetry|journal=Inquiries Journal|volume=7|issue=9}}</ref>

===Essays===
In his 1970 essay "What the Twilight Says: An Overture", discussing art and theatre in his native region (from ''Dream on Monkey Mountain and Other Plays''), Walcott reflects on the West Indies as colonized space.  He discusses the problems for an artist of a region with little in the way of truly [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] forms, and with little national or nationalist identity. He states: "We are all strangers here... Our bodies think in one language and move in another". The epistemological effects of colonization inform plays such as ''Ti-Jean and his Brothers''. Mi-Jean, one of the eponymous brothers, is shown to have much information, but to truly know nothing. Every line Mi-Jean recites is rote knowledge gained from the coloniser; he is unable to synthesize it or apply it to his life as a colonised person.<ref>{{cite news|title=Walcott: Caribbean literary colossus |url=http://www.barbadostoday.bb/2016/02/25/walcott-caribbean-literary-colossus/|location=St Michael, Barbados |accessdate=19 March 2017|work=Barbados Today|date=25 February 2016}}</ref>

Walcott notes of growing up in West Indian culture:

<blockquote>What we were deprived of was also our privilege. There was a great joy in making a world that so far, up to then, had been undefined... My generation of West Indian writers has felt such a powerful elation at having the privilege of writing about places and people for the first time and, simultaneously, having behind them the tradition of knowing how well it can be done—by a [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], a [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], a [[Henry Handel Richardson|Richardson]].<ref name="Paris Review" /></blockquote>

Walcott identified as "absolutely a Caribbean writer", a pioneer, helping to make sense of the legacy of deep colonial damage.<ref name="Paris Review" /> In such poems as "The Castaway" (1965) and in the play ''[[Pantomime (Walcott play)|Pantomime]]'' (1978), he uses the metaphors of shipwreck and [[Robinson Crusoe|Crusoe]] to describe the culture and what is required of artists after colonialism and slavery: both the freedom and the challenge to begin again, salvage the best of other cultures and make something new. These images recur in later work as well. He writes: "If we continue to sulk and say, Look at what the slave-owner did, and so forth, we will never mature. While we sit moping or writing morose poems and novels that glorify a non-existent past, then time passes us by."<ref name="Paris Review" />

==''Omeros''==
{{main|Omeros}}
Walcott's epic book-length poem ''[[Omeros]]'' was published in 1990 to critical acclaim. The poem very loosely echoes and references [[Homer]] and some of his major characters from ''[[The Iliad]]''. Some of the poem's major characters include the island fishermen Achille and Hector, the retired English officer Major Plunkett and his wife Maud, the housemaid Helen, the blind man Seven Seas (who symbolically represents Homer), and the author himself.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/walcott-omeros.html|title=Bringing Him Back Alive|last=Lefkowitz|first=Mary|date=7 October 1990|website=The New York Times|access-date=18 March 2017}}</ref>

Although the main narrative of the poem takes place on the island of St. Lucia, where Walcott was born and raised, Walcott also includes scenes from [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] (where Walcott was living and teaching at the time of the poem's composition), and the character Achille imagines a voyage from Africa onto a slave ship that is headed for the Americas; also, in Book Five of the poem, Walcott narrates some of his travel experiences in a variety of cities around the world, including [[Lisbon]], London, [[Dublin]], Rome, and Toronto.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=James V.|date=1 January 1999|title=Homer Travels to the Caribbean: Teaching Walcott's "Omeros"|jstor=4352373|journal=The Classical World|volume=93|issue=1|pages=83–99|doi=10.2307/4352373}}</ref>
 
Composed in a variation on ''[[terza rima]]'', the work explores the themes that run throughout Walcott's oeuvre: the beauty of the islands, the colonial burden, the fragmentation of Caribbean identity, and the role of the poet in a post-colonial world.<ref name="Bixby">Patrick Bixby, [http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Walcott.html "Derek Walcott"], essay: Spring 2000, [[Emory University]]. Retrieved 30 March 2012.</ref>

In this epic, Walcott advocates the need to return to traditions in order to challenge the modernity born out of colonialism.<ref>Baral, Raj Kumar and Heena Shrestha. (2020) "What is behind Myth and History in Derek Walcott's Omeros. Cogent Arts and Humanities, 7.1. https://doi.org/10.1080/23311983.2020.1776945</ref>

===Nobel Prize in Literature===
Derek Walcott was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1992, two years after publishing the epic poem ''Omeros''. He was known for writing about "the harsh legacy of colonialism and the complexities of living and writing in two cultural worlds." His poetic voice reflected a blend of his ear for the English language and his sense of his own people.<ref name=Grimes />

Stephen Breslow explained that he and the [[Swedish Academy]] chose Derek Walcott for the Nobel Laureate in Literature because his work had "a strong regional voice that transcends its topical locality, through the depth and breadth of its poetic resonance and through its global human implication." It was Walcott's ability to be more than just "exotic" that brought his work critical attention. Breslow explains that "Walcott has merged a profound, rhapsodic reverie upon his remote birthplace – its people, its landscape, and its history – with the central, classical tradition of Western civilization." This ability shows the importance of multiculturalism and literary mastery to the Swedish Academy. Walcott's works represent how different cultures can enrich one another to produce even more compelling works.<ref>Breslow, Stephen. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40149065 "Derek Walcott: 1992 Nobel Laureate in Literature"]. ''World Literature Today'', vol. 67, no. 2, 1993, pp. 267–271, doi:10.2307/40149065.</ref>

In his Nobel acceptance speech, Walcott describes life on Antilles and what it means to discover identity. He describes all of the "broken fragments" of his "diasporic" identity. People need books, he says, but they are not enough to encompass all that a culture is. Walcott says that "the visible poetry of the Antilles, then. [is] Survival" because "all of the Antilles, every island, is an effort of memory; every mind, every racial biography culminating in amnesia and fog." He encompasses the diasporic identity found in Caribbean Literature by looking at how insignificant he feels because he cannot, alone, fully bring together a cultural identity.<ref>[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1992/walcott-lecture.html "Derek Walcott – Nobel Lecture: The Antilles: Fragments of Epic Memory"]. Nobel Foundation. Nobel Media AB 2014. Web.</ref>

===Criticism and praise===
Walcott's work has received praise from major poets including [[Robert Graves]], who wrote that Walcott "handles English with a closer understanding of its inner magic than most, if not any, of his contemporaries",<ref>Robert D. Hamner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CkNTOawGMjwC&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=&source=bl&ots=t6XBMMi0rR&sig=b1kkPUT2Dxvp3yj5E75Xm8qmjFg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6ZpJVLeLF8P3apG4gOAH&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=snippet&q=handles%20English&f=false "Introduction"], ''Critical Perspectives on Derek Walcott'' (Three Continents, 1993), Lynne Rienner, 1997, p. 1.</ref> and [[Joseph Brodsky]], who praised Walcott's work, writing: "For almost forty years his throbbing and relentless lines kept arriving in the English language like tidal waves, coagulating into an archipelago of poems without which the map of modern literature would effectively match wallpaper. He gives us more than himself or 'a world'; he gives us a sense of infinity embodied in the language."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/220|title=Derek Walcott|work=poets.org|date=2014-02-04}}</ref> Walcott noted that he, Brodsky, and the Irish poet [[Seamus Heaney]], who all taught in the United States, were a band of poets "outside the American experience".

The poetry critic [[William Logan (poet)|William Logan]] critiqued Walcott's work in a ''New York Times'' book review of Walcott's ''Selected Poems''. While he praised Walcott's writing in ''Sea Grapes'' and ''The Arkansas Testament'', Logan had mostly negative things to say about Walcott's poetry, calling ''Omeros'' "clumsy" and ''Another Life'' "pretentious." He concluded with "No living poet has written verse more delicately rendered or distinguished than Walcott, though few individual poems seem destined to be remembered."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/books/review/Logan.t.html|first1=William|last1=Logan|title=The Poet of Exile|date=8 April 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=19 March 2017}}</ref>

Most reviews of Walcott's work are more positive. For instance, in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' review of ''The Poetry of Derek Walcott'', [[Adam Kirsch]] had high praise for Walcott's oeuvre, describing his style in the following manner:

<blockquote>By combining the grammar of vision with the freedom of metaphor, Walcott produces a beautiful style that is also a philosophical style. People perceive the world on dual channels, Walcott’s verse suggests, through the senses and through the mind, and each is constantly seeping into the other. The result is a state of perpetual magical thinking, a kind of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' world where concepts have bodies and landscapes are always liable to get up and start talking.<ref name=Kirsch>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/03/full-fathom-five-2|title=Full Fathom Five|last=Kirsch|first=Adam|date=3 February 2014|website=The New Yorker|access-date=18 March 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Kirsch calls ''Another Life'' Walcott's "first major peak" and analyzes the painterly qualities of Walcott's imagery from his earliest work through to later books such as ''Tiepolo's Hound''. Kirsch also explores the post-colonial politics in Walcott's work, calling him "the postcolonial writer par excellence". Kirsch calls the early poem "A Far Cry from Africa" a turning point in Walcott's development as a poet. Like Logan, Kirsch is critical of ''Omeros'', which he believes Walcott fails to successfully sustain over its entirety. Although ''Omeros'' is the volume of Walcott's that usually receives the most critical praise, Kirsch believes ''Midsummer'' to be his best book.<ref name=Kirsch />

His poetry, as spoken performance, appears briefly in the sampled sounds in the music album of the group [[Dreadzone]]. Their track entitled "Captain Dread" from the album ''[[Second Light]]'' incorporates the fourth verse of Walcott's 1990 poem "The Schooner Flight".

In 2013 Dutch filmmaker Ida Does released ''Poetry is an Island'', a feature documentary film about Walcott's life and the ever-present influence of his birthplace of [[St Lucia]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Charles|first1=Dee Lundy|title=It's Past Time For Walcott's Poetry Island|url=http://stluciastar.com/its-past-time-for-walcotts-poetry-island/|accessdate=11 April 2017|work=St Lucia Star|date=19 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=El Gammal-Ortiz|first1=Sharif|title=Film: Review Of "Poetry Is An Island"|url=https://repeatingislands.com/2015/08/13/film-review-of-poetry-is-an-island/|accessdate=11 April 2017|work=Repeating Islands|date=13 August 2015}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1954 Walcott married Fay Moston, a secretary, and they had a son, the St. Lucian painter Peter Walcott. The marriage ended in divorce in 1959. Walcott married a second time to Margaret Maillard in 1962, who worked as an [[almoner]] in a hospital. Together they had two daughters, [[Elizabeth Walcott-Hackshaw]] and Anna Walcott-Hardy, before divorcing in 1976.<ref>[http://www4.guardian.co.tt/news/2017-03-18/world-mourns "Sir Derek loses battle with kidney disease | World mourns"], ''Trinidad and Tobago Guardian'', 18 March 2017.</ref> In 1976, Walcott married for a third time, to actress Norline Metivier; they divorced in 1993.

Walcott was also known for his passion for traveling to countries around the world. He split his time between New York, Boston, and St. Lucia, and incorporated the influences of different locations into his pieces of work.<ref name=pf/>

==Allegations of sexual harassment==
In 1982 a Harvard sophomore accused Walcott of sexual harassment in September 1981. She alleged that after she refused a sexual advance from him, she was given the only C in the class. In 1996 a student at Boston University sued Walcott for sexual harassment and "offensive sexual physical contact". The two reached a settlement.<ref>{{Cite news|first1=Angela A.|last1=Sun |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2007/6/4/poet-accused-of-harassment-students-in/ |title=Poet Accused of Harassment |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|date=4 June 2007|accessdate=25 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Lecherous Professor: Sexual Harassment on Campus |first1= Billie Wright |last1=Dziech|first2=Linda |last2=Weiner|edition= second|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana.

In 2009, Walcott was a leading candidate for the position of [[Oxford Professor of Poetry]].
