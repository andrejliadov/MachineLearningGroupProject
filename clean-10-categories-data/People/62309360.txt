{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}
This page gives a list of individuals who have been romantically or maritally coupled with a [[sibling]].

==Terminology==
There are many terms used to describe a romantic bond between siblings, including nomenclature like [[adelphogamy]], the more general syntax associated with formality like consanguinamory, specific hyponyms such [[twincest]], or slang terms like sibcest.<ref>Rudmin, Floyd Webster. "Cross-cultural correlates of the ownership of private property: A look from another data base." Anthropologica (1992): 71-88.</ref><ref>Cusack, Carmen M. "Double Glazed: Reflection, Narcissism, and Freudian Implications in Twincest Pornography." JL & Soc. Deviance 13 (2017): 1.</ref> In mostly a heterosexual context, a female partner in such a relationship may be referred as a ''sister-wife''.<ref>Ager, Sheila L. "Familiarity breeds: incest and the Ptolemaic dynasty." The Journal of Hellenic Studies 125 (2005): 1-34.</ref> A similar incestual arrangement which is non-monogamous can be referred as ''sister-swapping'' or ''brother-swapping'',<ref>Buckner, Jocelyn Louise. Shady Ladies: Sister Acts, Popular Performance, and the Subversion of American Identity. Diss. University of Kansas, 2010.</ref> although this should not be confused with [[berdel]] which describes a parallel situation wherein families exchange multiple brides or bridegrooms.<ref>Anatolia, Acta Medica. "Being An Adolescent Mother." Acta Med Anatol 2.1 (2014): 14-18.</ref> However, due to the calumniatory nature of the term ''incest'', in an undiscerning context, the alternative term ''consanguinamory'', sometimes shortened to ''consang'' is used.<ref>Edmunds, Lowell. "imperative that to know oneself is to know one’s bio-genealogy, an imperative that is commensurate with the prohibition against incest. The modern Western experience of biological family is a problem of Oedipal knowledge, or incest, as is the experience of the adoptive family, which is equally subject to the bio-genealogical." Steeped in Blood: Adoption, Identity, and the Meaning of Family (2019): 277.</ref>

==History==
While [[cousin marriage]] is legal in most countries, and [[avunculate marriage]] is legal in several, sexual relations between siblings are considered incestual almost universally. Sibling incest is legally prohibited in most countries worldwide. It was historically practiced in [[ancient Egypt]] and indigenous Inca tribes.

Innate sexual aversion between siblings forms due to close association in childhood, in what is known as the [[Westermarck effect]]. Children who grow up together do not normally develop sexual attraction, even if they are unrelated, and conversely, siblings who were separated at a young age may develop sexual attraction. Thus, many cases of sibling incest, including accidental incest, concern siblings who were separated at birth or at a very young age.
