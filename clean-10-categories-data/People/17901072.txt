==Biography==
Born in [[Yizheng]], [[Jiangsu Province]], Dai graduated from the department of accounting of the Central Institute of Finance and Economics (now the [[Central University of Finance and Economics]]), majoring in financial accounting. He joined the Communist Party of China in May 1973. 

After graduation, he served as an accountant at the finance office of the Guishan Coal Mine in [[Yunnan]], an official in its propaganda office, vice secretary of the CPC committee at the second industrial zone, and an official at the political department of the Coal Industrial Bureau in Yunnan. Later, he moved to [[Jiangsu]] and became an official of the [[Agricultural Bank of China]] Jiangsu Branch, vice director of its appropriation office, vice mayor of [[Feng County, Jiangsu|Feng County]] of Jiangsu, and vice governor of the Agricultural Bank of China Jiangsu Branch.  From 1985 to 1995, he served as vice governor of the Agricultural Bank of China, general manager, vice president and CPC party chief of the [[Bank of Communications]], and vice governor and deputy party chief of the [[People's Bank of China]].<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-03/01/content_295750.htm Resume of Dai Xianglong] Xinhuanet.com</ref>

He was appointed as governor and CPC party chief of the People's Bank of China in June 1995. Since then, he has become well recognized. In June 2001, he was additionally appointed as vice secretary of the central finance commission. During his tenure as governor of China's central bank, Dai presided over 9 consecutive interest rate reductions, earning him the nickname of "governor who lowers the interest rate".
