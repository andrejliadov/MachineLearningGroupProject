'''Jack Allan Abramoff''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|b|r|əm|ɒ|f}}; born February 28, 1959) is an [[Lobbying in the United States|American lobbyist]], businessman, movie producer, writer, and convicted [[felon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2011/11/18/142506057/jack-abramoff-from-corrupt-lobbyist-to-washington-reformer| title= Jack Abramoff: From Corrupt Lobbyist To Washington Reformer| author= James, Frank | date= November 18, 2011| work= [[NPR]]| access-date= March 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098180/ | title = Red Scorpion (1988) |access-date=18 August 2017}}</ref> He was at the center of an extensive [[corruption]] investigation led by [[Earl Devaney]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Beating the odds |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/5/22/5723878/how-a-bill-becomes-a-law-in-2014 |first=Andrew |last=Prokop |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 22, 2014 |access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> that resulted in his conviction and to 21 people either pleading guilty or being found guilty,<ref name="HuffP1064602"/> including [[White House]] officials [[J.

Abramoff was [[College Republican National Committee]] National Chairman from 1981 to 1985, a founding member of the [[International Freedom Foundation]], allegedly financed by [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid South Africa]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bilderberg.org/roundtable/lhiff.html| title=Front for Apartheid| work= Newsday| date= July 16, 1995| author1= Dele Olojede | author2= Timothy M.

From 1994 to 2001 he was a top lobbyist for the firm of [[Preston Gates & Ellis]], and then for [[Greenberg Traurig]] until March 2004.

After a guilty plea in the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal|Jack Abramoff Native American lobbying scandal]] and his dealings with [[SunCruz Casinos]] in January 2006, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison for [[mail fraud]], [[Conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]] to bribe public officials, and [[tax evasion]].

Abramoff's lobbying and the surrounding scandals and investigation are the subject of two 2010 films: the documentary ''[[Casino Jack and the United States of Money]]'', released in May 2010,<ref>Stephen Holden, [https://movies.nytimes.com/2010/05/07/movies/07casino.html "The Eye in a Hurricane of Corruption"], ''[[New York Times]]'', May 7, 2010.</ref> and the feature film ''[[Casino Jack]]'', released on December 17, 2010, starring [[Kevin Spacey]] as Abramoff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194417/|title=Casino Jack|date=7 January 2011|access-date=31 March 2017|via=IMDb}}</ref><ref>[http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/06/bagman_trailer_the_other_jack.html "Bagman Trailer: The ''Other'' Jack Abramoff Movie"], ''Vulture'' at ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', June 15, 2010.</ref>

Abramoff's family moved to [[Beverly Hills, California]], when he was ten (in 1968). After seeing the film version of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' at age twelve, Abramoff decided to practice [[Orthodox Jew|Orthodox Judaism]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0604.morris.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717140509/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0604.morris.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-07-17 |title=Bad for the Jews, Worse for the Christians |first=Rachel |last=Morris |date=April 2006 |publisher=[[Washington Monthly]] |access-date=2007-06-28 }}</ref> In California, Abramoff attended [[Beverly Hills High School]].<ref name="sweats">[[Associated Press]].

==College and law school years==
As an undergraduate at [[Brandeis University]],<ref name="sweats"/> Abramoff served as Chairman of the Massachusetts Alliance of College Republicans, which organized student volunteers for [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 presidential campaign]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[English literature|English]] in 1981. He earned his [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[Georgetown University Law Center]] in 1986.

According to [[Nina Easton]], Abramoff gained much of his credibility in the conservative movement through his father, Franklin Abramoff. As president of [[Diners Club International]], Abramoff's father worked closely with [[Alfred S. Bloomingdale]], a personal friend of Reagan.<ref name ="NEaston">{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i078vP9ji7cC&pg=PA139| title=Gang of Five: Leaders at the Center of the Conservative Crusade |author= Nina J.

[[File:Reagan, Abramoff, Norquist.jpg|thumb|President Reagan meeting with Jack Abramoff and Grover Norquist in connection with the College Republican National Committee, 1981]]

===College Republican National Chairman===
After graduating from Brandeis, Abramoff ran for election as chairman of the [[College Republican National Committee]] (CRNC). After a campaign which cost over $11,000 and was managed by [[Grover Norquist]], Abramoff won the election. His chief competitor, [[Amy Ridenour|Amy Moritz]] was persuaded to drop out. (Later, as Amy Ridenour, she became a founding director of the [[National Center for Public Policy Research]]. She was treated to several [[list of trips funded by Jack Abramoff|trips funded by Jack Abramoff]] when he was working as a lobbyist.) Abramoff "changed the direction of the [college] committee and made it more [[political activism|activist]] and conservative than ever before", notes the CRNC. "It is not our job to seek peaceful coexistence with the [[Left-wing politics|Left]]", Abramoff was quoted as saying in the group's 1983 annual report. "Our job is to remove them from power permanently."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/943038721.html?dids=943038721:943038721&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec+18%2C+2005&author=JONATHAN+CHAIT&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=M.5&desc=JONATHAN+CHAIT| title=Big on money, short on memory (commentary) |author=Chait, Jonathan|date=December 18, 2005 |work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

Norquist served as executive director of the committee under Abramoff. He later recruited [[Ralph E. Reed, Jr.|Ralph Reed]], a former president of the [[University of Georgia]] College Republicans chapter, as an unpaid intern. According to Reed's book ''Active Faith'', Reed introduced Abramoff to Pamela Clarke Alexander, and they later married.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/washington/09lobby.html?pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | first=Philip | last=Shenon | title=Lobbying Cases Shine Spotlight on Family Ties | date=April 9, 2006}}</ref>

As chair of the CRNC, Abramoff addressed the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas.<ref>''Official Report of the Proceedings of the 33rd Republican National Convention, Held in Dallas, TX, August 21, 22, 23 1984.'' 1984. Republican National Committee.</ref>

===Long-standing college political alliances===
At the CRNC, Abramoff developed political alliances with College Republican chapter presidents across the nation. Many would later hold key roles in state and national politics and business, and some would later interact with Abramoff in his role as a lobbyist. Some of those relationships were at the core of the federal investigation.

At the CRNC, Abramoff, Norquist and Reed formed what was known as the "Abramoff-Norquist-Reed triumvirate". After Abramoff's election, the trio purged "dissidents" and re-wrote the CRNC's bylaws to consolidate their control over the organization.  According to Easton's ''Gang of Five'', Reed was the "hatchet man" and "carried out Abramoff-Norquist orders with ruthless efficiency, not bothering to hide his fingerprints".<ref name ="NEaston"/>

In 1983, the CRNC passed a resolution condemning "deliberate planted [[propaganda]] by the [[KGB]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] proxy forces" against the government of [[South Africa]], at a time when the country's government was under worldwide criticism for its [[apartheid]] regime.<ref>{{cite news

In 1984, Abramoff and other College Republicans formed the "USA Foundation", a [[non-partisan]] tax-exempt organization which held two days of rallies on college campuses around the United States celebrating the first anniversary of the [[invasion of Grenada]]. In a letter to campus Republican leaders, Abramoff claimed:

{{quote|While the Student Liberation Day Coalition is nonpartisan and intended only for educational purposes, I don't need to tell you how important this project is to our efforts as [College Republicans]. I am confident that an impartial study of the contrasts between the Carter/Mondale failure in Iran and the Reagan victory in Grenada will be most enlightening to voters 12 days before the general election.<ref>{{cite news

===Citizens for America===
In 1985, Abramoff joined [[Citizens for America]], a pro-Reagan group that helped [[Oliver North]] build support for the [[Nicaragua]]n [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contras]]. Citizens for America staged an unprecedented meeting of [[anti-Communist]] rebel leaders known as the [[Democratic International]] in [[Jamba, Angola]]. This conference included leaders of the [[Mujahedeen]] from [[Afghanistan]], [[National Union for Total Independence of Angola|UNITA]] from [[Angola]], the Contras, and opposition groups from [[Laos]]. Out of this largely ceremonial conference came the International Freedom Foundation. Abramoff helped to organize, and also attended the conference.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/28/AR2005122801588.html|title=The Fast Rise and Steep Fall of Jack Abramoff|date=2005-12-29|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

Abramoff's membership ended on a sour note when Citizens for America's sponsor [[Lewis Lehrman]], a former New York gubernatorial candidate, concluded that Abramoff had spent his money carelessly.<ref>{{cite news|title = Staff Shakeup Hits Conservative Group

In 1986, Reagan appointed Abramoff as a member of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|United States Holocaust Memorial]] Council.<ref>{{cite web

==Work in film production, and South Africa connections==
Abramoff spent 10 years in [[Hollywood]]. He developed (wrote the story) and produced, with his brother Robert, the 1989 film ''[[Red Scorpion]]''. The film ultimately cost $16 million (from an $8 million initial budget) and starred [[Dolph Lundgren]] playing the [[Spetsnaz]]-like [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] commando Nikolai, sent by the [[USSR]] to assassinate an [[Africa]]n revolutionary in a country similar to [[Angola]]. Nikolai sees the evil of the Soviets and changes sides, becoming a freedom fighter for the African side.<ref name=redscorp>{{cite book|last=Julius|first=Marshall|year=1997|title=Action!: The Action Movie A-Z|page=166}}</ref><ref name=inangola>{{cite book|last=Dubose|first=Lou|author2=Reid, Jan |year=2004|title=The Hammer: Tom DeLay God, Money, and the Rise of the Republican Congress|url=https://archive.org/details/hammertomdelaygo00dubo|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/hammertomdelaygo00dubo/page/189 189]}}</ref><ref name=scorplot>{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0098180/plotsummary|title=Plot summary for Red Scorpion (1989)|publisher=IMDb|access-date=2008-02-10}}</ref> Abramoff also executive-produced its 1994 sequel ''[[Red Scorpion 2]]''.

The [[South Africa]]n government financed the film via the [[International Freedom Foundation]], a front-group chaired by Abramoff, as part of its efforts to undermine international sympathy for the [[African National Congress]].<ref name=scorpfund>[[Ken Silverstein|Silverstein, Ken]].

On April 27, 1998, Abramoff wrote a letter to the editor of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' rebutting an article critical of him and his alleged role as effectively a [[Public Relations]] puppet of the then-[[apartheid]] South African military. Abramoff rebutted:

<blockquote>The IFF was a conservative group which I headed. It was vigorously [[anti-Communist]], but it was also actively anti-apartheid. In 1987, it was one of the first conservative groups to call for the release of [[Nelson Mandela]], a position for which it was roundly criticized by other conservatives at the time. While I headed the IFF, we accepted funding only from private individuals and corporations and would have absolutely rejected any offer of South African military funding, or any other kind of funding from any government – good or evil.<ref>Abramoff, Jack. [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19980427&slug=2747461 "Law And Politics – Question Could Have Averted Inaccurate, Incomplete Report."] ''The Seattle Times'' – Letters to the Editor. April 27, 1998</ref></blockquote>

During this period in South Africa, Abramoff first met South African-born [[rabbi]] [[David Lapin]], who would become his religious advisor. He also met Lapin's brother and fellow rabbi [[Daniel Lapin]], who allegedly introduced Abramoff to Congressman [[Tom DeLay]] (R-[[Texas|TX]]) at a [[Washington, DC]] dinner shortly after the [[U.S. House election, 1994|Republican takeover]] of Congress in 1994.<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> Lapin later claimed that he did not recall making that introduction.

==Seattle-based lobbying==
In December 1994, Abramoff was hired as a lobbyist at [[Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds LLP]], the lobbying arm of the law firm ''Preston Gates & Ellis LLP'' based in [[Seattle, Washington]]. According to ''The Seattle Times'', following the Republican takeover of Congress in 1995, partner Emanuel Rouvelas determined that the firm "didn't have a conservative, [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] Republican with strong ties to the new Republican leadership".<ref>{{cite news | publisher = The Seattle Times | title = Democratic Firm Learns To Do Business With New Congress | first = Robert T. | last = Nelson | date=January 27, 1995 }}</ref> The traditionally [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]]-leaning firm hired Abramoff for the specific purpose of attaining these wanted ties.  Abramoff was described in a press release as having close ties to [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[Dick Armey]], the former the Republican Speaker of the House and the latter the Republican House Majority Leader.

According to ''The Seattle Times'', Abramoff used Preston Gates & Ellis to access a higher pedigree of clientele.<ref>{{cite news | publisher = The Seattle Times | title = How scheming lobbyist operated in Seattle firm | url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060207&slug=prestongates07m|author1=Postman, David  |author2=Bernton, Hal|date = 2006-02-07 | access-date = 2006-08-17 }}</ref>

===Choctaw gambling===
In 1995, Abramoff began representing Native American tribes with gambling interests. He became involved with the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw]], a federally recognized tribe. One of Abramoff's first acts as a tribal gaming lobbyist was to defeat a Congressional bill to tax Native American casinos, sponsored by [[William Reynolds Archer, Jr.|Bill Archer]] (R-TX) and [[Ernest Istook]] (R-[[Oklahoma|OK]]). According to ''Washington Business Forward'', a lobbying trade magazine, "Tom DeLay was a major factor in those victories, and the fight helped cement the alliance between the two men".<ref>{{cite news | publisher = Washington Business Forward | url = http://www.bizforward.com/wdc/issues/2002-11/government/abramoff/ | title = Jack Doubles Down | work = Government, Inc. | first = John | last = Bresnahan |date=November–December 2002 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061206184358/http://www.bizforward.com/wdc/issues/2002-11/government/abramoff/ | archive-date = December 6, 2006 }}</ref> DeLay has called Abramoff "one of (his) closest and dearest friends".

''[[The Washington Post]]'', on December 29, 2005, reported: "Jack Abramoff liked to slip into dialogue from ''[[The Godfather]]'' as he led his lobbying colleagues in planning their next conquest on Capitol Hill. In a favorite bit, he would mimic an ice-cold [[Michael Corleone]] facing down a crooked politician's demand for a cut of [[American Mafia|Mafia]] gambling profits: 'Senator, you can have my answer now if you like. My offer is this: nothing.'"<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/28/AR2005122801588.html "The fast rise and steep fall of Jack Abramoff: How a well-connected lobbyist became the center of a far-reaching corruption scandal," ''The Washington Post'', December 29, 2005.]</ref>

''[[Casino Jack and the United States of Money]],'' elaborated on Abramoff's criminal [[modus operandi]]. Gibney said, "one of his (Abramoff's) great gifts was being able to tell people what they wanted to hear, and this was how he was able to sell things and get them into trouble." He was interviewed with former U.S. Representative [[Bob Ney]] and former Greenberg Traurig lobbyist Neil Volz on [[Kojo Nnamdi|Kojo Nnamdi's]] [[National Public Radio]] affiliate WAMU-FM radio show.

===Saipan and Northern Mariana Islands===
{{main|Jack Abramoff CNMI scandal}}
Abramoff and his law firm were paid at least $6.7 million by the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]] (CNMI) from 1995 to 2001. It made manufactured goods labeled with "[[Made in the USA]]", but it was not subject to U.S. [[labor law|labor]] and [[minimum wage]] laws. After Abramoff paid for DeLay and his staffers to go on trips to the CNMI, they crafted policy that extended exemptions from federal [[immigration]] and [[labor law]]s to the islands' industries. Abramoff also negotiated with the Marianas for a $1.2 million [[no-bid contract]] for "promoting ethics in government" to be awarded to David Lapin, brother of his associate Daniel Lapin.

Abramoff secretly funded a trip to the Marianas for Congressmen [[James E. Clyburn]] (D-[[South Carolina|SC]]) and [[Bennie Thompson]] (D-[[Missouri|MS]]). In 1999 Congressman [[Dana Rohrabacher]] (R-[[California|CA]]) went on an [[Abramoff-funded trip]] to the [[Marshall Islands]] with [[John Doolittle]] (R-CA) and [[Ken Calvert]] (R-CA); delegates of [[Guam]], [[American Samoa]], and the [[Virgin Islands]]; and eight staffers.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Talking Points Memo |url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/docs/RMItravel.html |title=Travel Record from House Committee on Resources |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223050324/http://talkingpointsmemo.com/docs/RMItravel.html |archive-date=2007-12-23 }}</ref>

Documentation indicates that Abramoff's lobbying team helped prepare Rep. [[Ralph Hall]]'s (R-TX) statements on the House floor in which he attacked the credibility of escaped teenaged [[sex worker]] "Katrina", in an attempt to discredit her testimony regarding the state of the [[sex slave]] industry in the Marianas.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=TPM Muckraker |title=For Abramoff, Lawmaker Slandered Teen Sex Slave |url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/001591.php |author=Paul Kiel |date=September 25, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923003425/http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/001591.php |archive-date=September 23, 2008 }}</ref> [[Ms. magazine|''Ms.'']] magazine reported Abramoff's dealings in the CNMI and the plight of garment workers like Katrina in a major article published in their spring 2006 issue.<ref>Clarren, Rebecca.[http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2006/paradise.asp "Paradise Lost: Greed, Sex Slavery, Forced Abortions and Right-Wing Moralists."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702152508/http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2006/paradise.asp |date=2006-07-02 }} ''Ms. Magazine''.

Abramoff arranged for mailings from a [[Ralph E. Reed, Jr.|Ralph Reed]] marketing company to [[Christian right|Christian conservative]] voters. He bribed Roger Stillwell, a high-ranking political appointee at the [[Department of the Interior]] who was responsible for some Native American gaming policy; Stillwell pleaded guilty in 2006 to accepting gifts from Abramoff. All government officials and employees are prohibited from accepting gifts from consultants, businesses and lobbyists.

===Naftasib===
Executives of [[Naftasib]]{{clarify|date=August 2018}}, a [[Russia]]n energy company, funneled almost $3.4 million to Abramoff and DeLay advisor [[Ed Buckham]] between 1997 and 2005. About $60,000 was spent on a [[Abramoff trips|trip]] to Russia in 1997 for Tom DeLay, Buckham, and Abramoff. In 1998, $1 million was sent to Buckham via his organization [[U.S. Family Network]] to "influence DeLay's vote in 1998 on legislation that helped make it possible for the [[International Monetary Fund]] to bail out the faltering Russian economy". DeLay voted for the legislation. The money was funneled through the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company Voor Huisen, the [[Bahamas]] company Chelsea Enterprises, and the [[London]] law firm James & Sarch Co.<ref>{{cite web | title = $3,617,238. | url = http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/007739.php | work = [[Talking Points Memo]] | author = Marshall, Joshua|access-date = 2006-08-17|date = 2006-02-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705195229/http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/007739.php|archive-date=July 5, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news

===eLottery, Inc.===
{{main|Internet Gambling Prohibition Act}}
In 1999, [[eLottery]] hired Abramoff to block the [[Internet Gambling Prohibition Act]], which he did by enlisting [[Ralph E. Reed, Jr.|Ralph Reed]], Norquist, and Tom DeLay's former chief of staff, [[Tony Rudy]].

Emails from 2000 show that [[Susan Ralston]] helped Abramoff pass checks from eLottery to [[Lou Sheldon]]'s [[Traditional Values Coalition]] (TVC) and also to Norquist's [[Americans for Tax Reform]] (ATR), en route to [[Ralph E. Reed, Jr.|Ralph Reed]]'s company, [[Century Strategies]].<ref>{{cite news

==Abramoff joins Greenberg Traurig==
{{main|Team Abramoff}}
On January 8, 2001, Abramoff left Preston Gates to join the Government Relations division of the Washington, D.C. law firm Greenberg Traurig, which once described him as "directly involved in the Republican party and conservative movement leadership structures" and "one of the leading fund raisers for the party and its congressional candidates".<ref>{{cite web|title=Jack A. Abramoff | url = http://gtlaw.com/bios/govadmin/abramoffj.htm | work = Greenberg Traurig – Biographies | publisher = [[Greenberg Traurig]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030612020908/http://gtlaw.com/bios/govadmin/abramoffj.htm | archive-date = June 12, 2003}}</ref> With the move to Greenberg Traurig, Abramoff took as much as $6 million worth of client business from his old firm, including the Marianas Islands account. At Greenberg Traurig, Abramoff recruited a team of lobbyists known familiarly as "Team Abramoff". The team included many of his former employees from [[Preston Gates]] and former senior staffers of members of Congress.

Around the time he joined Greenberg Traurig, Abramoff's choice of lobbying clients changed to focus much more on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes. While Abramoff was a registered lobbyist for 51 clients while working at Preston Gates, with only four being tribes, Abramoff would eventually represent 24 clients for whom he was registered lobbyist at Greenberg Traurig, of which seven were tribes.

===Tyco International Ltd.===
Former White House Deputy Counsel [[Timothy Flanigan]] left his job in December 2002 to work as General Counsel for Corporate and International Law at [[Tyco International]]. He immediately hired Abramoff to lobby Congress and the White House on matters relating to Tyco's [[Bermuda]] [[tax-exempt status]].<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/24/politics/24justice.html |title=Democrats Press Justice Dept.

Tyco Inc. claimed in August 2005 that Abramoff had been paid $1.7 million for "[[astroturfing]]", or the creation of a fake "[[grassroots]]" campaign to oppose proposals to penalize US corporations registered abroad for tax reasons. The work allegedly was never performed, and most of the fee Tyco paid Abramoff to lobby against the legislation was "diverted to entities controlled by Mr. Abramoff".<ref name = Tyco />

===Lobbying for national governments===
Abramoff's team represented the government of [[Malaysia]], and worked toward improving Malaysian relations with the United States, particularly with trade relations.<ref>{{cite news

Abramoff also met with the government of [[Sudan]], offering a plan to deflect criticism from American [[Christians|Christian]] groups over the regime's alleged role in the [[Darfur conflict]]. Abramoff promised to enlist Reed to assist, as well as starting a grassroots campaign to improve the image of [[Sudan]] in America.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://darfur.tribe.net/thread/21564b09-d585-4737-b286-dd27c986a7e9 | title = Abramoff Offered to Aid Sudan, Envoy Says | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 2006-04-06 | author1 = Hamburger, Tom | author2 = Silverstein, Ken | access-date = 2006-08-17 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060515074107/http://darfur.tribe.net/thread/21564b09-d585-4737-b286-dd27c986a7e9 | archive-date = 2006-05-15 }}</ref>

===Channel One News===
Abramoff was a lobbyist for the school TV news service [[Channel One News]]. From 1999 to 2003, Channel One retained him to ensure Congress did not block funds to their service. Not only did Channel One face frequent campaigns by political groups to persuade Congress to limit its presence in schools, but it also derived much of its advertising revenue from U.S. government sources, including the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] and military recruitment. Since Abramoff and Channel One parted ways, Channel One's advertising revenues have dropped substantially, but a cause-and-effect relationship would be difficult to establish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Primedia Employed Lobbyist Abramoff for Channel One |first=Ira |last=Teinowitz |date=2006-01-10 |url=http://www.commercialalert.org/news/Archive/2006/01/primedia-employed-lobbyist-abramoff-for-channel-one |work=Commercial Alert |access-date=2006-08-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010074735/http://www.commercialalert.org/news/archive/2006/01/primedia-employed-lobbyist-abramoff-for-channel-one |archive-date=2006-10-10 }}</ref>

===Telecommunications firm===
On October 18, 2005, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Bob Ney, as chair of the [[House Administration Committee]], approved a 2002 license for an Israeli [[telecommunications]] company to install antennas for the House of Representatives. The company, then [[Foxcom Wireless]], an [[Israel]]i start-up [[telecommunications]] firm, (which has since moved headquarters from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Vienna, Virginia]], and been renamed [[MobileAccess Networks]]) later paid Abramoff $280,000 for lobbying. It also donated $50,000 to the [[Capital Athletic Foundation]] charity that Abramoff sometimes used to secretly pay for some of his lobbying activities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lawmaker's Abramoff Ties Investigated |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/17/AR2005101701918_pf.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2005-10-18 |page=A01 |author1=Grimaldi, James V.  |author2=Schmidt, Susan |access-date=2006-08-17 }}</ref> In [[Michael Scanlon]]'s [[plea agreement]], this activity was described as [[public corruption]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1121052scanlon1.html | title = Ex-DeLay Aide In Corruption Plea|work = [[The Smoking Gun]]|date = 2005-11-21 | access-date = 2006-08-17 }}</ref>

===Skyboxes, "Signatures", and Scotland===
[[File:Signatures dc.jpg|thumb|Jack Abramoff's now-closed Signatures restaurant, in the [[Penn Quarter, Washington, D.C.|Penn Quarter]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.]]

Abramoff maintained four [[Luxury box|skyboxes]] at major sports arenas for political entertaining at a cost of over $1 million a year. Abramoff hosted many fundraisers at these skyboxes including events for politicians publicly opposed to gambling, such as Representative [[John Doolittle]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[California|CA]]).<ref>{{cite news | title = The lies of lobbygate | date = 2005-06-28|url = http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050628/NEWS/506280307/1039|work = [[Rutland Herald]] | first = Jay | last = Bookman | access-date = 2006-08-17 }}</ref>

Then Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member [[Max Baucus]] returned $18,892 in contributions that his office found to be connected to Abramoff.  Included in the returned donations was an estimated $1,892 that was never reported for Baucus' use of Abramoff's skybox at a professional sports arena and concert venue in downtown Washington in 2001.<ref>{{cite news

Abramoff also was co-owner of [[Signatures Restaurant]], a high-end Washington establishment which he used to reward friends and associates. His fellow lobbyist [[Kevin A. Ring]] treated [[U.S. Justice Department|Justice Department]] official [[Robert E. Coughlin]] to free tickets to the skyboxes and took him out to Signatures multiple times in exchange for favors.<ref name="guilty"/>
The restaurant, once thriving, was closed once investigations closed in on Abramoff.

DeLay, Ney and Florida Republican Representative [[Tom Feeney]] have each gone on golf trips to [[Scotland]] that were apparently arranged or funded by Abramoff. These trips took place in 2000, 2002 and 2003. Ney and Feeney each claimed that their trips were paid for by the [[National Center for Public Policy Research]], but the group denied this. Spokespeople for Ney and Feeney blamed others for filing errors. Ney later pleaded guilty to knowing that Abramoff had paid for the trip.

A former top procurement official in the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]], [[David H. Safavian]], has been convicted of lying and [[obstruction of justice]] in connection with the Abramoff investigation. Safavian, who traveled to Scotland with Reed and Ney on a golf outing arranged by Abramoff, was accused of concealing from federal investigators information about Abramoff's plans to do business with the [[General Services Administration]] at the time of the golf trip – in particular, seeking help finding property for his private religious school, Eshkol Academy, and for one of his tribal clients. Safavian was then GSA chief of staff.<ref>{{cite news

==Access to the Bush administration==
Jack Abramoff was a highly influential figure as lobbyist and activist in the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]].<ref>John Anderson, ''Follow the money: how George W. Bush And the Texas Republicans hog-tied America'', Scribner: 2007 {{ISBN|0-7432-8643-X}}, 331 pages: 13</ref> In 2001, Abramoff was a member of the Bush administration's 2001 Transition Advisory Team assigned to the [[U.S. Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]].<ref name = USToday>{{cite news | title = Controversial lobbyist had close contact with Bush team | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-05-06-abramoff-bush_x.htm | agency = Associated Press|date = 2005-05-06|access-date = 2006-08-17 | work=USA Today}}</ref> Abramoff befriended the incoming Deputy Secretary of the Interior [[J. Steven Griles]].

The draft report of the House Government Reform Committee said the documents – largely Abramoff's billing records and e-mails – listed 485 lobbying contacts with White House officials over three years, including 10 with top Bush aide [[Karl Rove]]. The report said that of the 485 contacts listed, 345 were described as meetings or other in-person contacts; 71 were described as phone conversations and 69 were e-mail exchanges.<ref>{{cite web

In the first ten months of 2001, the Abramoff lobbying team logged almost 200 contacts with the Bush administration.<ref name = USToday /> He may have used these senior level contacts to assist in his lobbying for Indian tribes concerning tribal gaming. The Department of the Interior has Federal regulatory authority over tribal affairs such as tribal recognition and gaming. From 2000 to 2003, six Indian tribes paid Abramoff over $80 million in lobbying fees.<ref name = FastRise/>

The Department of the Interior Office of Insular Affairs has authority over policy and grants to US territories such as the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]] (CNMI).<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cq.html | title = Northern Mariana Islands | date = 2006-08-08 | work = [[The World Factbook]] | access-date = 2006-08-17 }}</ref>  This may have assisted Abramoff in lobbying for [[textile]] interests in the islands.

Abramoff asked for $9 million in 2003 from the president of [[Gabon]], [[Omar Bongo]], to arrange a meeting with Bush and directed his fees to an Abramoff-controlled lobbying firm, [[GrassRoots Interactive]].<ref name = Bongo>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/10/politics/10lobby.html?ex=1289278800&en=3564c89497493794&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |title=Lobbyist Sought $9 Million to Set Bush Meeting |work=New York Times |date=2005-11-10 |first=Philip|last = Shenon |access-date = 2006-08-17}}</ref> Bongo did meet with Bush in the Oval Office on May 26, 2004.<ref name = Bongo /> There has been no evidence in the public record that Abramoff had any role in organizing the meeting, or that he received any money or had a signed contract with Gabon.<ref name = Bongo />

An [[NPR]] news report from March 2006 stated that: "... Abramoff recently granted a rare press interview to [[Vanity Fair magazine|''Vanity Fair'' magazine]], where he asserts President Bush and other prominent figures in Washington know him very well.

In June 2006, Abramoff began secretly granting exclusive interviews to former ''[[Boston Globe]]'' investigative reporter Gary S. Chafetz, without the knowledge of Abramoff's attorneys or the federal prosecutors with whom Abramoff had been cooperating. These interviews – conducted before and during Abramoff's imprisonment – continued until May 2008. In September 2008, Chafetz's book, ''The Perfect Villain: John McCain and the Demonization of Lobbyist Jack Abramoff'' was rushed into print prior to the [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]]. In his book, Chafetz asserted that Abramoff, though guilty of some of the charges, was the victim of misleading and sensational reporting by the ''Washington Post'', vengeance and mendacity on the part of Sen. [[John McCain]] (R-[[Arizona|AZ]]), and strong-arm tactics of the [[U.S. Justice Department|Justice Department]] who forced Abramoff into confessing to crimes he did not believe he was guilty of. Chafetz also accused federal prosecutors of abusive – and possibly illegal – tactics in their reliance on private and public [[honest services fraud]], which he characterized as vague and controversial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13230.html|title=Book attacks McCain's Abramoff inquiry|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/anderson/anderson262.html|title=The Ultimate Prosecutorial Weapon: Honest Services Fraud by William L.

==Abramoff organizations==
{{main|List of Jack Abramoff-related organizations}}

Abramoff has founded or run several non-profit organizations, including Capital Athletic Foundation and Eshkol Academy; as well as lobbying firms and political think tanks such as [[American International Center]], GrassRoots Interactive, and the National Center for Public Policy Research. While these organizations had varying degrees of legitimate activities, it has come to light that Abramoff used these organizations to channel millions of dollars to recipients not related to the organizations.

===Capital Athletic Foundation and Eshkol Academy===
{{main|Capital Athletic Foundation|Eshkol Academy}}

Although Federal tax records show that various Indian tribes donated more than $6 million to the Capital Athletic Foundation, less than 1% of the money went to athletic programs, the stated purpose of the foundation. The majority of the funds went to the Eshkol Academy in Maryland, an Orthodox Jewish school founded by Abramoff in 2002. Hundreds of thousands of dollars from CAF were also spent on golf trips to Scotland for Abramoff, Ney, [[Ralph E. Reed, Jr.|Ralph Reed]] Safavian, as well as purchases of camping equipment sent to a high school friend. Abramoff solicited Safavian's help in looking for property deals for Eshkol Academy and tribal clients, leading to Safavian's conviction.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmnew/is_/ai_n14760146 | title = Fund-Raising: Take It to the (West) Bank | date = 2006-05-02|publisher = [[Newsweek]]|author = Isikoff, Michael | access-date = 2006-08-17 | author-link = Michael Isikoff }}</ref>

At least $2.3 million went to a [[California]] consulting firm that used the same address as the law office of Abramoff's brother, Robert. A separate check for $400,000, from GrassRoots, was made out to [[Kay Gold]] LLC, another Abramoff family company.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/1110-04.htm |title=Lobbyist Sought $9 Million to Set Bush Meeting |work=New York Times |date=2005-11-10 |first=Philip |last=Shenon |access-date=2006-08-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822044246/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/1110-04.htm |archive-date=August 22, 2006 }}</ref>

===Maldon Institute===
Abramoff was a board member and secretary/treasurer of the Maldon Institute for at least five years (1999–2003). He was one of only four board members, including [[John Rees (journalist)|PJ Johnson and John Rees]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediatransparency.org/recipientprofile.php?recipientID=1385|archive-url=https://archive.today/20070806211732/http://www.mediatransparency.org/recipientprofile.php?recipientID=1385|url-status=dead|title=Maldon Institute, Inc.|date=6 August 2007|archive-date=6 August 2007|website=archive.is}}</ref>

==Scandal and criminal investigations==
In late 2004, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee began to investigate Abramoff's lobbying on behalf of American Indian tribes and casinos. In September he was called before the Committee to answer questions about that work, but [[pleading the Fifth|pleaded the fifth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,180602,00.html|title=Timeline of Key Events in Jack Abramoff Investigation|date=4 January 2006|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref>

===SunCruz Casinos fraud conviction===
{{main|SunCruz Casinos}}
On August 11, 2005, Abramoff and [[Adam Kidan]] were indicted by a federal [[grand jury]] in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], on fraud charges arising from a 2000 deal to buy SunCruz Casinos from [[Gus Boulis]]. Abramoff and Kidan are accused of using a fake [[wire transfer]] to make lenders believe that they had made a $23 million down payment, in order to qualify for a $60 million [[loan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Abramoff will plead not guilty to fraud charges, lawyer says |url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/08/abramoff-will-plead-not-guilty-to.php |date=2005-08-19 |first=Krista-Ann |last=Staley |publisher=[[JURIST]] |access-date=August 17, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824141115/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/08/abramoff-will-plead-not-guilty-to.php |archive-date=August 24, 2006 }}</ref> Ney also was implicated in helping to consummate the deal.

After the partners purchased SunCruz in September 2000, the business relationship with Boulis deteriorated, culminating in a fistfight between Kidan and Boulis in December 2000. In February 2001 Boulis was murdered in his car in a [[Mafia]]-style attack. The murder investigation included three individuals who had received payments from Kidan. Two of the suspects received life sentences for the murder charges, while a third associate pled guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and was sentenced to 6 and half years time served already after he testified against his co-conspirators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-boulis-murder-sentencing-closings-20150917-story.html|title=Moscatiello sentenced to life in prison for Miami Subs founder's murder|last=Olmeda|first=Raphael|date=September 18, 2015|access-date=September 6, 2017|publisher=Sun Sentinel}}</ref>

On January 4, 2006, Abramoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], related to the SunCruz deal. The plea agreement called for a maximum sentence of just over seven years and would run concurrently with the sentence in the Washington corruption case, but could be reduced if Abramoff cooperated fully. The remaining four counts in the Florida indictment were dismissed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/04/politics/main1176617.shtml|title=Abramoff Pleads Guilty, Will Help in Corruption Probe|publisher=CBS News|date=January 4, 2006|access-date=September 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060127203916/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/04/politics/main1176617.shtml|archive-date=January 27, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On March 29, 2006, Abramoff and Kidan were both sentenced in the SunCruz case to the minimum amount of 70 months, and ordered to pay US$21.7 million in restitution. According to the "memorandum in aid of sentencing", the sentencing judge, U.S. District Judge [[Paul C. Huck]], received over 260 pleas for leniency from various people, including "rabbis, military officers and even a professional hockey referee."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12066674|date =March 29, 2006 | access-date =September 4, 2006| title = Abramoff gets 5 years, 10 months in fraud case }}</ref>

===Guam grand jury investigation===
{{main|Jack Abramoff Guam investigation}}
In 2002 Abramoff was retained under a secret contract by the [[Guam]] [[Government of Guam#The Superior Court of Guam|Superior Court]] to lobby against a bill proposing to put the Superior Court under the authority of the [[Supreme Court of Guam|Guam Supreme Court]]. On November 18, 2002, a [[grand jury]] issued a [[subpoena]] demanding that the administrator of the Guam Superior Court release all records relating to the contract. On November 19, 2002, [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] Frederick A. Black, the chief prosecutor for Guam and the instigator of the indictment, was unexpectedly demoted and removed from the office he had held since 1991. The federal grand jury investigation was quickly wound down and took no further action. In 2005 Public Auditor Doris Flores Brooks initiated a new investigation of the Abramoff contract, which is continuing.

In 2006 California attorney and [[Marshall Islands]] lobbyist Howard Hills, and Tony Sanchez, a former administrator of the Guam Superior Court, were indicted for unlawful influence, conspiracy for unlawful influence, theft of property held in trust, and official misconduct for allegedly authorizing 36 payments of $9,000 vis a vis a pre-existing contract between Hills and the Guam Superior Court, each written out to Hills, but funneled to Abramoff. Hills, trusting Sanchez as a court official at face value, assumed that this was a temporary circumstance and agreed to help facilitate transition for what he thought was a standard government contract between Abramoff and the court. For this Hills received no compensation. Before indictments or investigations were initiated, Hills halted his temporary contract with Abramoff and reported what he thought was potentially suspicious behavior to public officials when it occurred to him that something may be wrong. In 2007, superseding indictments were issued against Hills and Sanchez, and in 2008 further related indictments were handed down against Abramoff and Abramoff's firm at the time, Greenberg Traurig. The charges against both attorney Howard Hills and Greenberg Traurig have since been dismissed.

===Native tribes grand jury investigations===
{{main|Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal}}

Abramoff and his partner, [[Michael Scanlon]] (a former Tom DeLay aide), conspired to bilk [[Native American gaming|Native casino]] gambling interests out of an estimated $85 million in fees. The lobbyists also orchestrated lobbying against their own clients in order to force them to pay for lobbying services. These practices were the subject both of long-running criminal prosecution and hearings by the [[Senate Indian Affairs Committee]]. On November 21, 2005, Scanlon pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe a member of Congress and other public officials.

On January 3, 2006, Abramoff pleaded guilty to three felony counts – conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion – involving charges stemming principally from his lobbying activities in Washington on behalf of Native American tribes.<ref>Forsythe, Michael and Jonathan D. Salant. [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&sid=aDq6Gy_i0shA&refer=top_world_news "Abramoff Pleads Guilty, Will Help in Corruption Probe."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930083404/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&sid=aDq6Gy_i0shA&refer=top_world_news |date=2007-09-30 }} ''Bloomberg News Service''.

As a result, Abramoff and other defendants must make restitution of at least $25 million that was defrauded from clients, primarily the Native American tribes. Further, Abramoff owes the [[Internal Revenue Service]] $1.7 million as a result of his guilty plea to the tax evasion charge. In the agreement, Abramoff admits to bribing public officials, including Ney.<ref>{{cite news | title = Lobbyist admits he gave Ney bribes | author1 = Torry, Jack | author2 = Riskind, Jonathan | date = 2006-01-04 | url = http://www.columbusdispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2006/01/04/20060104-A1-01.html | publisher = [[The Columbus Dispatch]] | access-date = 2006-08-17 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Also included: the hiring of congressional staffers and conspiring with them to lobby their former employers – including members of Congress – in violation of a one-year federal ban on such lobbying.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/abramoff_info_010306.pdf|date = 2006-01-03 | access-date = 2006-08-17 | title = Abramoff complaint | work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Later in 2006 Abramoff lobbyists Neil Volz and Tony Rudy pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges; in September 2006 Ney himself pleaded guilty to conspiracy and [[making false statements]].

On September 4, 2008, a Washington court found Abramoff guilty of trading expensive gifts, meals and sports trips in exchange for political favors, and U.S. District Judge [[Ellen Segal Huvelle]] sentenced him to a four-year term in prison, to be served concurrently with his previous sentences. Abramoff cooperated in a bribery investigation involving lawmakers, their aides, and members of the Bush administration.<ref>Schmidt, Susan and Grimaldi, James V. (2005-11-26).
