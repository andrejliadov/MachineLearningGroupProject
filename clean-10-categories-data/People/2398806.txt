The '''John Adams Birthplace''' is a historic house at 133 Franklin Street in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]].  It is the [[Saltbox house|saltbox]] home in which the second [[president of the United States]], [[John Adams]], was born in 1735.  The house was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1960, and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  It is now administered by the [[National Park Service]] as part of the [[Adams National Historical Park]], and is open for guided tours.

==Description and early history==
The house is a {{frac|2|1|2}} story wood frame structure, sheathed in wooden clapboards. There are two main rooms, one on either side of a central chimney, on each of the two floors, and there are two further rooms in the lean to section on the first floor. The main facade is three bays wide with the entry in the center. The doorway is framed by pilasters and topped by an entablature and triangular pediment.<ref name="nrhpinv2">Polly M.

The land on which the house sits was first owned by William Needham, who built a house on the property c. 1650. According to [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] analysis, "the front part of the (present) house was built in 1722, or shortly thereafter by [[John Adams Sr.|Deacon John Adams]]. President John Adams refers to the fact that his father built the house in a letter to Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]] of July 19, 1812. The framing of the east side incorporates a number of reused timbers dating to the 1670s."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dendrochronology.net/ma.asp|title=Oxford Tree-Ring Laboratory|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220141723/http://dendrochronology.net/ma.asp|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[John Adams|John]], the oldest son of Deacon John, was born in the east room on October 30 (October 19 [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]), 1735.<ref name="nrhpinv2"/>

==Later history==
Upon the Deacon's death in 1761, the house passed to his second son, Peter; the younger John received [[John Quincy Adams Birthplace|the house next door]], where [[John Quincy Adams]] was born to John and [[Abigail Adams]] in 1767. Peter lived in the house with his mother until 1768, when he married.  In 1774 he sold the house to his brother John, who rented it out after their mother died in 1780. In 1803 John sold both houses to his son, who lived in the house of his birth, and rented this one out.  The house was occupied from 1810 to 1818 by John Quincy Adams' son, [[Thomas Boylston Adams (1772â€“1832)|Thomas Boylston Adams]].<ref name="nrhpinv2"/>

Both houses remained in Adams family ownership, and were rented out until 1885, when most of the surrounding farmland was sold off.  After sitting vacant, [[Charles Francis Adams Jr.]] authorized the local chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] to use the house as meeting space.  This they did until the chapter folded in 1950.  The Adamses sold the house to the City of Quincy in 1940, which turned administration of the property over to the Quincy Historical Society (which had earlier taken over the adjacent house) in 1950.<ref name="nrhpinv2"/>  The two houses are now part of [[Adams National Historical Park]], and are administered by the [[National Park Service]].  They are open for guided tours.
