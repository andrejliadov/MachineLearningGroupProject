In the [[Book of Genesis]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], chapters one through five, there are two [[Genesis creation narrative|creation narratives]] with two distinct perspectives. In the first, Adam and Eve are not named. Instead, God created humankind in [[image of God|God's image]] and instructed them to multiply and to be [[Stewardship (theology)|stewards]] over everything else that God had made. In the second narrative, God fashions [[Adam]] from dust and places him in the [[Garden of Eden]]. Adam is told that he can eat freely of all the trees in the garden, except for a [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. Subsequently, [[Eve]] is created from one of Adam's ribs to be his companion. They are innocent and unembarrassed about their [[nakedness]]. However, a [[Serpents in the Bible#Eden|serpent]] deceives Eve into eating fruit from the forbidden tree, and she gives some of the fruit to Adam. These acts give them additional knowledge, but it gives them the ability to conjure negative and destructive concepts such as [[shame]] and [[evil]]. God later curses the serpent and the ground. God prophetically tells the woman and the man what will be the consequences of their sin of disobeying God. Then he banishes them from the Garden of Eden.

The myth underwent extensive elaboration in later Abrahamic traditions, and it has been extensively analyzed by modern biblical scholars. Interpretations and beliefs regarding Adam and Eve and the story revolving around them vary across religions and sects; for example, the Islamic version of the story holds that Adam and Eve were ''equally'' responsible for their sins of [[hubris]], instead of Eve being the first one to be unfaithful. The story of Adam and Eve is often depicted in art, and it has had an important influence in literature and poetry.

The story of the fall of Adam is often considered to be an allegory. Findings in [[population genetics]], particularly those concerning [[Y-chromosomal Adam]] and [[Mitochondrial Eve]], indicate that a single first "Adam and Eve" pair of human beings never existed.

The [[Genesis creation narrative|opening chapters of the Book of Genesis]] provide a [[myth]]ic history of the infiltration of evil into the world.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|p=ix}} God places the first man and woman (Adam and Eve) in his [[Garden of Eden]], from whence they are expelled; the first murder follows, and God's decision to destroy the world and save only the righteous Noah and his sons; a new humanity then descends from these and spreads throughout the world, but although the new world is as sinful as the old, God has resolved never again to destroy the world by flood, and the History ends with Terah, the father of Abraham, from whom will descend God's chosen people, the [[Israelites]].{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|p=1}} Neither Adam nor Eve is mentioned elsewhere in the Hebrew scriptures apart from a single listing of Adam in a genealogy in [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles 1:1]],{{sfn|Enns|2012|p=84}} suggesting that although their story came to be prefixed to the Jewish story, it has little in common with it.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|p=3}} 

===Creation narrative===
{{main|Genesis creation narrative}}
Adam and Eve are the Bible's first man and first woman.{{sfn|Hearne|1990|p=9}}{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}} Adam's name appears first in Genesis 1 with a collective sense, as "mankind"; subsequently in Genesis 2–3 it carries the definite article ''ha'', equivalent to English "the", indicating that this is "the man".{{sfn|Hearne|1990|p=9}} In these chapters God fashions "the man" (''ha adam'') from earth (''adamah''), breathes life into his nostrils, and makes him a caretaker over creation.{{sfn|Hearne|1990|p=9}} God next creates for the man an ''ezer kenegdo'', a "helper corresponding to him", from his side or rib.{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}} The word "rib" is a [[pun]] in Sumerian, as the word "''{{lang|sux|ti}}''" means both "rib" and "life".<ref name="Collon">{{cite book |last1=Collon |first1=Dominique |title=Ancient Near Eastern Art |date=1995 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520203075 |page=213 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTGc9YH-C38C&q=adam+eve&pg=PA213 |accessdate=27 April 2019 |language=en |quote=the strange story of Adam's 'spare rib' from which Eve was created (Genesis 2:20-3) makes perfect sense once it is realised that in Sumerian the feminine particle and the words for rib and life are all ti, so that the tale in its original form must have been based on Sumerian puns.}}</ref> She is called ''ishsha'', "woman", because, the text says, she is formed from ''ish'', "man".{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}} The man receives her with joy, and the reader is told that from this moment a man will leave his parents to "cling" to a woman, the two becoming one flesh.{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}}

=== The Fall ===
{{Main|Fall of man}}
The first man and woman are in God's Garden of Eden, where all creation is vegetarian and there is no violence. They are permitted to eat of all the trees except one, the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. The woman is tempted by a talking serpent to eat the forbidden fruit, and gives some to the man, who eats also.{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}} (Contrary to popular myth she does not beguile the man, who appears to have been present at the encounter with the serpent).{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}} God curses all three, the man to a lifetime of hard labour followed by death, the woman to the pain of childbirth and to subordination to her husband, and the serpent to go on his belly and suffer the enmity of both man and woman.{{sfn|Galambush|2000|p=436}} God then clothes the nakedness of the man and woman, who have become god-like in knowing good and evil, then banishes them from the garden lest they eat the fruit of a second tree, the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]], and live forever.{{sfn|Alter|2008|p=27-28}}

=== Expulsion from Eden ===
The story continues in Genesis 3 with the "expulsion from Eden" narrative. A [[form criticism|form analysis]] of Genesis 3 reveals that this portion of the story can be characterized as a [[parable]] or "wisdom tale" in the [[wisdom tradition]]. The poetic addresses of the chapter belong to a speculative type of wisdom that questions the [[paradox]]es and harsh realities of life. This characterization is determined by the narrative's format, [[Setting (narrative)|setting]]s, and the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. The form of Genesis 3 is also shaped by its vocabulary, making use of various [[pun]]s and [[double entendre]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freedman|first=Meyers, Patrick|title=The Word of the Lord Shall Go Forth: Essays in Honor of David Noel Freedman|year=1983|publisher=[[Eisenbrauns]]|isbn=9780931464195|pages=[https://archive.org/details/wordoflordshallg00unse/page/343 343–344]|editor=[[Carol L. Meyers]]|editor2=Michael Patrick O'Connor|editor3=[[David Noel Freedman]]|url=https://archive.org/details/wordoflordshallg00unse/page/343}}</ref>

The expulsion from Eden narrative begins with a dialogue between the woman and a serpent,<ref name="Mathews, 226">{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=226}}</ref> identified in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:1|HE}} as an animal that was more crafty than any other animal made by God, although Genesis does not identify the serpent with [[Satan]].<ref name=Levenson>{{cite book

The woman sees that the fruit of the tree of knowledge is a delight to the eye and that it would be desirable to acquire wisdom by eating the fruit. The woman eats the fruit and gives some to the man ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:6|HE}}). With this the man and woman recognize their own nakedness, and they make [[loincloth]]s of fig leaves ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:7|HE}}).<ref>{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=237}}</ref>
[[File:B Escorial 18.jpg|thumb|left|Adam and Eve in an illuminated manuscript (c. 950)]]

In the next narrative dialogue, God questions the man and the woman ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:8–13|HE}}),<ref name="Mathews, 226"/> and God initiates a dialogue by calling out to the man with a rhetorical question designed to consider his wrongdoing. The man explains that he hid in the garden out of fear because he realized his own nakedness ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:10|HE}}).<ref>{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=240}}</ref> This is followed by two more rhetorical questions designed to show awareness of a defiance of God's command.

Divine pronouncement of three judgments are then laid against all the culprits, {{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:14–19|HE}}.<ref name="Mathews, 226"/> A judgement oracle and the nature of the crime is first laid upon the serpent, then the woman, and, finally, the man. On the serpent, God places a divine [[curse]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=243}}</ref> The woman receives penalties that impact her in two primary roles: she shall experience pangs during childbearing, pain during childbirth, and while she shall desire her husband, he will rule over her.<ref>{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=248}}</ref> The man's penalty results in God cursing the ground from which he came, and the man then receives a death oracle, although the man has not been described, in the text, as immortal.<ref name=Levenson />{{rp|18;}}<ref>{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=252}}</ref> Abruptly, in the flow of text, in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:20|HE}}, the man names the woman "Eve" (Heb. ''hawwah''), "because she was the [[Hebat|mother of all living]]". God makes skin garments for Adam and Eve ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:20|HE}}).

The [[chiasmus]] structure of the death oracle given to Adam in {{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:19|HE}}, is a link between man's creation from "dust" ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|2:7|HE}}) to the "return" of his beginnings:<ref>{{harvnb|Mathews|1996|p=253}}</ref>"  you return, to the ground, since from it you were taken, for dust you are, and to dust, you will return."

The garden account ends with an intradivine monologue, determining the couple's expulsion, and the execution of that deliberation ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:22–24|HE}}).<ref name="Mathews, 226"/> The reason given for the expulsion was to prevent the man from eating from the [[Tree of life (biblical)|tree of life]] and becoming immortal: "Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever" ({{bibleverse|Genesis|3:22|HE}}).<ref name=Levenson />{{rp|18;}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Addis|first=Edward|title=The Documents of the Hexateuch, Volume 1|year=1893|publisher=Putnam|pages=4–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SpVAAAAMAAJ&q=bibliogroup:%22The+Documents+of+the+Hexateuch%22}}</ref> God exiles Adam and Eve from the Garden and installs [[cherub]]s (supernatural beings that provide protection) and the "ever-turning sword" to guard the entrance ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|3:24|HE}}).<ref name=Weinstein>{{cite book|last=Weinstein|first=Brian|title=54 Torah Talks: From Layperson to Layperson|year=2010|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781440192555|page=4}}</ref>

{{Main|Genealogies of Genesis}}
Genesis 4 narrates life outside the garden, including the birth of Adam and Eve's first children [[Cain and Abel]] and the story of the first murder. A third son, [[Seth]], is born to Adam and Eve, and Adam had "other sons and daughters" ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|5:4|HE}}). Genesis 5 lists Adam's descendants from Seth to Noah with their ages at the birth of their first sons and their ages at death. Adam's age at death is given as 930 years. According to the [[Book of Jubilees]], Cain married his sister [[Awan (religious figure)|Awan]], a daughter of Adam and Eve.<ref>Betsy Halpern Amaru (1999).

==Textual history==
The Primeval History forms the opening chapters of the [[Torah]], the five books making up the history of the origins of Israel. This achieved something like its current form in the 5th century BCE,{{sfn|Enns|2012|p=5}} but Genesis 1-11 shows little relationship to the rest of the Bible:{{sfn|Sailhamer|2010|p=301 and fn.35}} for example, the names of its characters and its geography - Adam (man) and Eve (life), the Land of Nod ("Wandering"), and so on - are symbolic rather than real,{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|p=2}} and almost none of the persons, places and stories mentioned in it are ever met anywhere else.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|p=2}} This has led scholars to suppose that the History forms a late composition attached to Genesis and the Pentateuch to serve as an introduction.{{sfn|Sailhamer|2010|p=301}} Just how late is a subject for debate: at one extreme are those who see it as a product of the Hellenistic period, in which case it cannot be earlier than the first decades of the 4th century BCE;{{sfn|Gmirkin|2006|p=240-241}} on the other hand the Yahwist source has been dated by some scholars, notably [[John Van Seters]], to the exilic pre-Persian period (the 6th century BCE) precisely because the Primeval History contains so much Babylonian influence in the form of myth.{{sfn|Gmirkin|2006|p=6}}<ref group="Note" name="Seters">See John Van Seters, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zRl8aj_KiM4C&q=80#v=snippet Prologue to History: The Yahwist as Historian in Genesis]'' (1992), pp.80, 155-156.</ref> The Primeval History draws on two distinct "sources", the [[Priestly source]] and what is sometimes called the [[Yahwist]] source and sometimes simply the "non-Priestly"; for the purpose of discussing Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis the terms "non-Priestly" and "Yahwist" can be regarded as interchangeable.{{sfn|Carr|2000|p=492}}

=== Judaism ===
{{For|the Jewish [[Weekly Torah portion]]|Bereshit (parsha)#Third reading|Bereshit (parsha)#Fourth reading}}
It was also recognized in [[ancient Judaism]] that there are two distinct accounts for the creation of man. The first account says "male and female [God] created them", implying simultaneous creation, whereas the second account states that God created Eve subsequent to the creation of Adam. The [[Midrash Rabbah]] – Genesis VIII:1 reconciled the two by stating that Genesis one, "male and female He created them", indicates that God originally created Adam as a [[hermaphrodite]],<ref>{{cite book|author1=Howard Schwartz |title=Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism: The Mythology of Judaism|date=September 2004|isbn=978-0195086799|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=60iVk1p8Y9IC&q=indicates%20that%20God%20originally%20created%20Adam%20as%20a%20hermaphrodite&pg=PA138|accessdate=27 December 2014|quote=The myth of Adam the Hermaphrodite grows out of three biblical verses}}</ref> bodily and spiritually both male and female, before creating the separate beings of Adam and Eve. Other rabbis suggested that Eve and the woman of the first account were two separate individuals, the first being identified as [[Lilith]], a figure elsewhere described as a night demon.

According to traditional Jewish belief, Adam and Eve are buried in the [[Cave of Machpelah]], in [[Hebron]].

In {{Bibleverse|Genesis|2:7|HE}} "God breathes into the man's nostrils and he becomes ''[[Nephesh|nefesh hayya]]''", signifying something like the English word "being", in the sense of a corporeal body capable of life; the concept of a "[[soul]]" in the modern sense, did not exist in Hebrew thought until around the 2nd century BC, when the idea of a bodily resurrection gained popularity.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Harry Orlinsky]]'s Notes to the NJPS Torah</ref>

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Temptation Adam Eva.jpg|thumb|222px|Adam, Eve, and the (female) serpent (often identified as [[Lilith]]) at the entrance to [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris]]
{{main|Fall of man|Original sin}}
Some early [[Fathers of the Church|fathers of the Christian church]] held Eve responsible for the [[Fall of man]] and all subsequent women to be the first sinners because Eve tempted Adam to commit the taboo. "You are the devil's gateway" [[Tertullian]] told his female readers, and went on to explain that they were responsible for the death of Christ: "On account of your [[Desertion|desert]] [i.e., punishment for sin, that is, death], even the Son of God had to die."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/anf/anf04/anf04-06.htm |title=Tertullian, "De Cultu Feminarum", Book I Chapter I, ''Modesty in Apparel Becoming to Women in Memory of the Introduction of Sin Through a Woman'' (in "The Ante-Nicene Fathers") |publisher=Tertullian.org |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref> In 1486, the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] Kramer and Sprengler used similar tracts in ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' ("Hammer of Witches") to justify the persecution of "witches".

Medieval Christian art often depicted the Edenic Serpent as a woman (often identified as [[Lilith]]), thus both emphasizing the serpent's seductiveness as well as its relationship to Eve. Several early [[Church Fathers]], including [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], interpreted the Hebrew "Heva" as not only the name of Eve, but in its aspirated form as "female serpent."

Based on the Christian doctrine of the [[Fall of man]], came the doctrine of [[original sin]]. [[St Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430), working with a Latin translation of the [[Epistle to the Romans]], interpreted the [[Apostle Paul]] as having said that Adam's sin was hereditary: "Death passed upon [i.e., spread to] all men because of Adam, [in whom] all sinned", {{Bibleref2|Romans|5:12}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Robin Lane|title=The Unauthorized Version: Truth and Fiction in the Bible|orig-year=1991|year=2006|publisher=[[Penguin Books]] Limited|isbn=9780141925752|pages=15–27|author-link=Robin Lane Fox}}</ref> Original sin became a concept that man is born into a condition of sinfulness and must await redemption. This doctrine became a cornerstone of Western Christian theological tradition, however, not shared by Judaism or the Orthodox churches.

Over the centuries, a system of unique Christian beliefs had developed from these doctrines. [[Baptism]] became understood as a washing away of the stain of hereditary sin in many churches, although its original symbolism was apparently rebirth. Additionally, the serpent that tempted Eve was interpreted to have been [[Satan]], or that Satan was using a serpent as a [[spokesperson|mouthpiece]], although there is no mention of this identification in the Torah and it is not held in Judaism.

Regarding the real existence of the progenitors – as of other narratives contained in Genesis – the [[Catholic Church]] teaches that Adam and Eve were historical humans, personally responsible for the original sin. This position was clarified by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the encyclical [[Humani generis|Humani Generis]], were the pope condamned the theory of polygenism and expressed that original sin comes "from a sin actually committed by an individual Adam".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Humani Generis (August 12, 1950) {{!}} PIUS XII|url=http://www.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis.html|access-date=2020-11-17|website=www.vatican.va}}</ref>

=== Gnostic traditions ===
{{See also|Gnostics}}
[[Gnosticism|Gnostic Christianity]] discussed Adam and Eve in two known surviving texts, namely the "[[Apocalypse of Adam]]" found in the [[Nag Hammadi]] documents and the ''[[Testament of Adam]]''. The creation of Adam as [[Protoplast (religion)|Protoanthropos]], the original man, is the focal concept of these writings.

Another Gnostic tradition held that Adam and Eve were created to help defeat Satan. The serpent, instead of being identified with Satan, is seen as a hero by the [[Ophites]]. Still other Gnostics believed that Satan's fall, however, came after the creation of humanity. As in Islamic tradition, this story says that Satan refused to bow to Adam due to pride. Satan said that Adam was inferior to him as he was made of fire, whereas Adam was made of clay. This refusal led to the [[fallen angel|fall of Satan]] recorded in works such as the [[Book of Enoch]].

[[File:Islamic Adam & Eve.jpg|thumb|right|Painting from Manafi al-Hayawan (The Useful Animals), depicting Adam and Eve. From [[Maragheh]] in Iran, 1294–99]]
In [[Islam]], Adam ({{transl|ar|ALA|Ādam}}; {{lang-ar|آدم}}), whose role is being the father of [[human]]ity, is looked upon by [[Muslim]]s with reverence. Eve ({{transl|ar|ALA|Ḥawwāʼ}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''' حواء ''') is the "mother of humanity".<ref>''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', Wheeler, "Adam and Eve"</ref> The creation of Adam and Eve is referred to in the {{transl|ar|ALA|Qurʼān}}, although different Qurʼanic interpreters give different views on the actual creation story (Qurʼan, Surat al-Nisaʼ, verse 1).<ref>{{Cite quran|4|1|s=ns}}:''O mankind!

In [[Tafsir Al-Qummi|al-Qummi's]] [[tafsir]] on the [[Garden of Eden]], such place was not entirely earthly. According to the {{transl|ar|ALA|Qurʼān}}, both Adam and Eve ate the [[Forbidden fruit#Islamic tradition|forbidden fruit]] in a ''[[Jannah|Heavenly]]'' Eden. As a result, they were both sent down to Earth as God's representatives. Each person was sent to a mountain peak: Adam on [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|al-Safa]], and Eve on [[Al-Safa and Al-Marwah|al-Marwah]]. In this Islamic tradition, Adam wept 40 days until he repented, after which God sent down the [[Black Stone]], teaching him the [[Hajj]]. According to a prophetic [[hadith]], Adam and Eve reunited in the plain of ʻArafat, near [[Mecca]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNQ_3aRdHPYC&q=adam+and+eve+mecca&pg=PA85 |title=Mecca and Eden: Ritual, Relics, and Territory in Islam – Brannon M.

The concept of "original sin" does not exist in [[Islam]] because, according to Islam, Adam and Eve were forgiven by God.

== Historicity ==
{{main|Historicity of the Bible}}
While a traditional view was that the Book of Genesis was authored by [[Moses]] and has been considered historical and metaphorical, modern scholars consider the Genesis creation narrative as one of various ancient [[origin myth]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Van Seters|first=John|chapter=The Pentateuch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=owwhpmIVgSAC&q=The+Hebrew+Bible+today:+an+introduction+to+critical+issues|editor=Steven L.

With scientific developments in paleontology, geology, biology and other disciplines, it was discovered that humans, and all other living things, [[evidence of common descent|share the same common ancestor]] which [[evolution|evolved]] through natural processes, over billions of years to form the life we see today.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kampourakis|first=Kostas|year=2014|title=Understanding Evolution|location=Cambridge; New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-03491-4|lccn=2013034917|oclc=855585457|pages=[https://archive.org/details/understandingevo0000kamp/page/127 127–129]|url=https://archive.org/details/understandingevo0000kamp/page/127}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schopf|first1=J.

In biology the [[most recent common ancestor]]s, when traced back using the [[Y-chromosome]] for the male lineage and [[mitochondrial DNA]] for the female lineage, are commonly called the [[Y-chromosomal Adam]] and [[Mitochondrial Eve]], respectively.

== Arts and literature ==
[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', a famous 17th-century [[epic poem]] written in [[blank verse]], explores and elaborates upon the story of Adam and Eve in great detail. As opposed to the Biblical Adam, Milton's Adam is given a glimpse of the future of mankind, by the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], before he has to leave Paradise.

[[Mark Twain]] wrote humorous and satirical diaries for Adam and Eve in both "[[Eve's Diary]]" (1906) and ''The Private Life of Adam and Eve'' (1931), posthumously published.

[[C. L. Moore]]'s 1940 story ''Fruit of Knowledge'' is a re-telling of the [[Fall of Man]] as a [[love triangle]] between [[Lilith]], Adam and Eve – with Eve's eating the forbidden fruit being in this version the result of misguided manipulations by the jealous Lilith, who had hoped to get her rival discredited and destroyed by God and thus regain Adam's love.

In [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s 1991 musical ''[[Children of Eden]]'', "Father" (God) creates Adam and Eve at the same time and considers them his children. They even assist Him in naming the animals. When Eve is tempted by the serpent and eats the forbidden fruit, Father makes Adam choose between Him and Eden, or Eve. Adam chooses Eve and eats the fruit, causing Father to banish them into the wilderness and destroying the Tree of Knowledge, from which Adam carves a staff. Eve gives birth to Cain and Abel, and Adam forbids his children from going beyond the waterfall in hopes Father will forgive them and bring them back to Eden. When Cain and Abel grow up, Cain breaks his promise and goes beyond the waterfall, finding the giant stones made by other humans, which he brings the family to see, and Adam reveals his discovery from the past: during their infancy, he discovered these humans, but had kept it secret. He tries to forbid Cain from seeking them out, which causes Cain to become enraged and he tries to attack Adam, but instead turns his rage to Abel when he tries to stop him and kills him. Later, when an elderly Eve tries to speak to Father, she tells how Adam continually looked for Cain, and after many years, he dies and is buried underneath the waterfall. Eve also gave birth to Seth, which expanded hers and Adam's generations. Finally, Father speaks to her to bring her home. Before she dies, she gives her blessings to all her future generations, and passes Adam's staff to Seth. Father embraces Eve and she also reunited with Adam and Abel. Smaller casts usually have the actors cast as Adam and Eve double as Noah and Mama Noah.

[[File:God judging adam blake 1795.jpg|thumb|270px|''God Judging Adam'' by [[William Blake]], 1795, [[Tate Collection]]]]
In [[Ray Nelson]]'s novel ''Blake's Progress'' the poet [[William Blake]] and his wife Kate travel to the end of time where the demonic Urizen offers them his own re-interpretation of the Biblical story: "In this painting you see Adam and Eve listening to the wisdom of their good friend and adviser, the serpent. One might even say he was their Savior. He gave them freedom, and he would have given them eternal life if he'd been allowed to."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[John William "Uncle Jack" Dey]] painted ''Adam and Eve Leave Eden'' (1973), using stripes and dabs of pure color to evoke Eden's lush surroundings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Adam and Eve Leave Eden|url=http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=6786|website=Smithsonian American Art Museum|accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>

In [[C.S. Lewis]]' science fiction novel ''[[Perelandra]]'', the story of Adam and Eve is re-enacted on the planet [[Venus]] – but with a different ending. A green-skinned pair, who are destined to be the ancestors of Venusian humanity, are living in naked innocence on wonderful floating islands which are the Venusian Eden; a demonically-possessed Earth scientist arrives in a spaceship, acting the part of the snake and trying to tempt the Venusian Eve into disobeying God; but the protagonist, Cambridge scholar Ransom, succeeds in thwarting him, so that Venusian humanity will have a glorious future, free of [[original sin]].
