'''Sail Mohamed Ameriane ben Amerzaine''' (October 14, 1894 – April 1953) was an [[Algeria]]n and [[France|French]] [[anarchist]] who fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The French writer [[Jacques Prévert]] dedicated a poem to him.

Born in [[Kabylie]], [[French Algeria]], Sail Mohamed served in the [[French Colonial Forces]]. 
He was arrested for insubordination and desertion during the [[First World War]]. He then moved to France, where he was an activist in the [[Union Anarchiste]] (UA) and the [[Confédération Générale du Travail-Syndicaliste Révolutionnaire]] (CGT-SR) and was founder (in 1923) with his friend [[Sliman Kiouane]] of the [[Committee for the Defence of Indigenous Algerians]], one of the first [[national liberation movements]] in [[French colonial empires|French North Africa]].

He was a passionate [[anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]], rejecting support from the [[International Red Aid|Red Aid]], a [[front organisation]] of the [[French Communist Party]], when he was prosecuted by the French authorities for an anti-militarist article. 

In 1936, he served in the [[Sébastien Faure Century]], the French-speaking section of the [[Durruti Column]], an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist]] anti-Francoist militia in Spain. In October 1936, he became the general delegate for foreign groups, replacing [[Bethomieu]] who died in [[Perdiguera]]. He was wounded in November and got back to France in December, after sending many letters describing the anarchist movement in Spain. As soon as he got better, he took part in the conferences organised by the [[Union Anarchiste]] on the realisation of the Spanish revolution.
