A '''quintet''' is a group containing five members. It is commonly associated with musical groups, such as a [[string quintet]], or a group of five singers, but can be applied to any situation where five similar or related objects are considered a single unit.

==Overview==
In [[european classical music|classical instrumental music]], any additional instrument (such as a [[piano]], [[clarinet]], [[oboe]], etc.) joined to the usual [[string quartet]] (two [[violin]]s, a [[viola]], and a [[cello]]), gives the resulting ensemble its name, such as "[[piano quintet]]", "[[clarinet quintet]]", etc. A piece of music written for such a group is similarly named.

The standard [[wind quintet]] consists of one player each on [[Western concert flute|flute]], [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[bassoon]], and [[French horn|horn]], while the standard [[brass quintet]] has two [[trumpet]]s, [[French horn|horn]], [[trombone]], and [[tuba]]. Other combinations are sometimes found, however.

In [[jazz music]], a quintet is group of five players, usually consisting of two of any of the following instruments, [[guitar]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[clarinet]], [[flute]] or [[trombone]], in addition to those of the traditional [[jazz trio]] – [[piano]], [[double bass]], [[Drum kit|drums]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

In some modern bands there are quintets formed from the same family of instruments with various voices, as an all-[[brass instrument|brass]] ensemble, or all [[saxophone]]s, in [[soprano saxophone|soprano]], [[alto saxophone|alto]], [[baritone saxophone|baritone]], and [[Bass saxophone|bass]], and sometimes [[Contrabass saxophone|contrabass]].
