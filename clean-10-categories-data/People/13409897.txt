{{short description|Ancient Greek weaver}}
'''Acesas''' (Greek '''{{lang|grc|Ακεσας}}''') was a native of [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] in [[Cyprus]] famed for his skill in weaving cloth with variegated patterns (''polymitarius'').

Acesas and his son Helicon, who distinguished himself in the same art, are mentioned by [[Athenaeus]].<ref>[[Athenaeus]]. ii. p. 48, b</ref>  [[Zenobius]] speaks of both artists, but says that Acesas (or, as he calls him, Aceseus, {{lang|grc|Ακεσεύς}}) was a native of [[Patara (Lycia)|Patara]], and Helicon of [[Carystus]].  He tells us also that they were the first who made a [[peplos]] for [[Athena]] Polias.

While the exact time of their lives is unknown, it must have been before the time of [[Euripides]] and [[Plato]], who mention the peplos they made.<ref>[[Euripides]], ''[[Hecuba (play)|Hecuba]]'' 468</ref><ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Euthyphro]]'' § 6</ref>  A specimen of the workmanship of these two artists was preserved in the temple at [[Delphi]], bearing an inscription to the effect that Pallas had imparted marvelous skill to their hands.<ref>{{Citation  | last = Mason  | first = Charles Peter  | author-link = Charles Peter Mason  | contribution = Acesas  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 7  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0016.html }}</ref>
