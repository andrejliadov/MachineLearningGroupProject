'''2moro''' is a [[Taiwan]]ese [[boyband]], whose members are identical twins '''Anthony Guo''' (郭彥均) and '''Angus Guo''' (郭彥甫). The twins are graduates from [[Taipei Physical Education College]].

The twins got their first taste of stardom in their third year of school, when an advertising company was seeking two similar-looking persons for the filming of a sportswear commercial, and found them a good choice. Before recording their first album, they had worked with female group [[S.H.E]] in the film ''[[Reaching for the Stars (TV series)|Reaching For The Stars]]'' (真命天女) and with [[Singapore]]an actors in the [[Mediacorp]] drama production ''Rainbow Connections'' (舞出彩虹).

They released their first album, ''Twins' First Disc'' (雙胞胎的初回盤), on 6 January 2006. The album features 11 songs, and the hit song ''Exciting 2006'' (刺激2006) is composed from excerpts of 23 songs by other singers such as [[Stefanie Sun]], [[Leehom Wang]] and [[F4 (band)|F4]], with each line an excerpt from a different song. A second song from their album, ''Holding Your Hand'' (牵着你) enjoyed a stay of two weeks on Singapore's [[YES 933]] music charts, reaching the 19th spot for the week of 26 February 2006. A third song, ''Shabu Shabu'', is a Chinese cover of ''[[Dragostea din Tei]]'' by [[O-Zone]].

Both brothers currently co-host a variety show 食尚玩家(Super Taste) on TVBS Entertainment Channel and TVBS-Asia<ref>{{in lang|zh}}[http://www.supertaste.com.tw/ 食尚玩家 官网.
