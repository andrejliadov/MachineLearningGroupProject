Various [[sovereign state|states]] govern or claim to govern in the name of ''the people''. Both the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]] used the [[Latin]] term ''[[SPQR|Senatus Populusque Romanus]]'', (the Senate and People of Rome). This term was fixed abbreviated (SPQR) to Roman legionary standards, and even after the [[Roman Emperor]]s achieved a state of total personal [[Autocracy|autarchy]], they continued to wield their power in the name of the Senate and People of Rome.

A [[People's Republic]] is typically a [[Marxism|Marxist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]] [[one-party state]] that claims to govern on behalf of the people even if it in practice often turns out to be a [[dictatorship]]. [[Populism]] is another umbrella term for various political tendencies that claim to represent the people, usually with an implication that they serve the ''common people'' instead of the [[Elitism|elite]].

Chapter One, Article One of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] states that "peoples" have the right to [[self-determination]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |title=Charter of the United Nations: Chapter I: Purposes and Principles |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 April 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YNQicd2P?url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml |archive-date=8 May 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Though the mere status as peoples and their right to self-determination, as for example in the case of [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples|Indigenous peoples]], does not provide for claiming [[independence]] and a [[sovereign state]], since peoples also need territory and a central government to reach [[sovereignty]] in international politics.<ref>See the following:

It notes that the state as an international person should possess the following qualifications: '(a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with other states'}}

In [[criminal law]], in certain jurisdictions, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of ''the People''. Several U.S. states, including [[California]], [[Illinois]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], use this style.<ref>See, e.g., ''[[People v. Anderson|California v. Anderson]]'' 6 Cal. 3d 628; 493 P.2d 880; 100 Cal. Rptr. 152; 1972 Cal. LEXIS 154 (1972)</ref> Citations outside the jurisdictions in question usually substitute the name of the state for the words "the People" in the case captions.<ref>See generally, ''[[Bluebook|The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', rule 10.</ref> Four states&nbsp;— [[Massachusetts]], [[Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Kentucky]]&nbsp;— refer to themselves as ''the [[Commonwealth]]'' in case captions and legal process.<ref>See [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth (United States)]]</ref> Other states, such as [[Indiana]], typically refer to themselves as ''the State'' in case captions and legal process.

Outside the United States, criminal trials in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[Philippines]] are prosecuted in the name of the people of their respective states.

The political theory underlying this format is that criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]]; thus, in these [[U.S. states]], the "people" are judged to be the sovereign, even as in the [[United Kingdom]] and other dependencies of the [[British monarchy|British Crown]], criminal prosecutions are typically brought in the name of [[the Crown]]. "The people" identifies the entire body of the [[citizen]]s of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes.<ref>''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'', 5th ed., "People".</ref>
