'''Juggalo gangs''' are criminal groups using the name and associated imagery from [[Juggalo]] culture, dedicated fans of the rap group [[Insane Clown Posse]] or any other [[Psychopathic Records]] artist.<ref name="ULN" /><ref name="RMIN" /><ref name="NGIC" /><ref name="FBI" /><ref name="vasey1">{{cite web |last=Bashir |first=Martin |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/law-enforcement-claims-horrorcore-genre-incites-crime/story?id=9739420#.UJtSV-Sunww |title=Law Enforcement Claims 'Horrorcore' Genre Incites Crime – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2010-03-09 |access-date=2012-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918115335/https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/law-enforcement-claims-horrorcore-genre-incites-crime/story?id=9739420#.UJtSV-Sunww |archive-date=2013-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> As a result, Juggalos have been classified as a [[gang|criminal street gang]] by government and law enforcement agencies, including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]],<ref name="FBI" /> the [[National Gang Intelligence Center]],<ref name="NGIC" />  and the states of Arizona, California, Pennsylvania, and Utah.<ref name="NGIC" /><ref name="FBI" /> Juggalo gang sets have been documented by law enforcement in at least 21 states,<ref name="FBI" /> including those that do not recognize Juggalos as a gang at the state level.<ref name="NGIC" />

Juggalo gangs band together under the Juggalo banner in order to engage in patterns of criminal activity. Unlike members of the general Juggalo subculture,<ref name="NGIC" /> these gangs have handbooks detailing gang ranks and responsibilities,<ref name="NEWGS" /> and commit crimes for financial gain.<ref name="NGIC" />

The National Gang Intelligence Center has also predicted that "The formation of rivalries or alliances to gangs outside their group will allow the Juggalos to evolve into a more sophisticated criminal entity through associations with hardened, experienced gang members."

Insane Clown Posse objects to characterizations of its fanbase as a gang, and has challenged the Federal gang designation in court. In December 2017 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that ICP failed to demonstrate harm caused by the FBI's 2011 report.

== Criminal activities ==
{{See also|List of Juggalo gang subsets}}
According to the [[National Gang Intelligence Center]], there are more than one million self-proclaimed Juggalos across the United States.  It is estimated that 85–90% of self-described Juggalos are peaceful, non-criminal music fans. The other 10–15% make up the Juggalo subculture's criminal element, which has been linked to numerous crimes including [[extortion]], murder, domestic terrorism, drive-by shootings, drug trafficking, arson, burglary, armed robbery, aggravated assault, and weapon offenses, and has been documented collaborating with a wide array of street and prison gangs.<ref name="RMIN" /><ref name="NGIC" /><ref name="FBI" /><ref name="ULN" />

A series of arsons on a [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] [[Indian reservation|reservation]] have been linked to a local Juggalo gang set, which uses arson as a way to increase Juggalos' rank within the gang.<ref name="RMIN" />

In 2008, members of a [[Bloods|Blood]]-affiliated Juggalo set known as the Southwest Bloods were convicted of aggravated assault after one member was required to stab a man in order to leave the gang.<ref name="RMIN" />

Juggalos in [[Rose Hill, Fairfax County, Virginia]] have been linked to the [[Gangster Disciples]].<ref name="latin-kings-ms-13">{{cite web |last=Sommer |first=Will |url=http://kingstowne.patch.com/groups/police-and-fire/p/latin-kings-and-ms-13-detectives-talk-about-franconia7845b9ed8c |title=Latin Kings and MS-13: Detectives Talk About Franconia's Gang Problem – Police & Fire – Kingstowne-Rose Hill, VA Patch |publisher=Kingstowne.patch.com |date=2011-02-22 |access-date=2013-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927121849/http://kingstowne.patch.com/groups/police-and-fire/p/latin-kings-and-ms-13-detectives-talk-about-franconia7845b9ed8c |archive-date=2013-09-27 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Juggalos were identified by the [[New Jersey Department of Law & Public Safety]] as the most actively recruiting gang in [[New Jersey]] in 2010.<ref name="njsp">{{Cite web |url=http://www.njsp.org/info/pdf/gangs_in_nj_2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906084518/http://www.njsp.org/info/pdf/gangs_in_nj_2010.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-06 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Also in 2010, a Juggalette who was not affiliated with any gang was assaulted by a new Juggalo gang called the Juggalo Killers, who knocked her unconscious before carving the letters "JK" into her chest, because they wanted to be the only group wearing [[Insane Clown Posse]] merchandise in their territory.<ref name="NGIC" />

In 2012, a Juggalo gang member, who was wanted for violating probation, was placed on [[New Mexico]]'s most wanted list.<ref name="nm">{{cite web|url=http://www.usmarshals.gov/news/chron/2012/080112a.htm|title=Gang Member Removed from New Mexico's Most Wanted|work=usmarshals.gov|access-date=2015-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624115609/http://www.usmarshals.gov/news/chron/2012/080112a.htm|archive-date=2015-06-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Juggalos in [[Oregon]] have been reported to have extorted homeless and homosexual individuals on the street with the threat of beatings.<ref name="NGIC" />

In August 2013, a Juggalo street gang member was arrested on charges of attempted murder, battery with a deadly weapon and possession of a controlled substance for allegedly attacking a cyclist with two meat cleavers in northeast Las Vegas, calling the man a "snitch".<ref name="lvsun2">{{cite web |last=Snyder |first=Riley |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/06/juggalo-street-gang-member-arrested-after-attack-p/ |title=Juggalo gang member arrested after attack involving pair of dulled meat cleavers – Las Vegas Sun News |publisher=Lasvegassun.com |access-date=2013-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927212350/http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/aug/06/juggalo-street-gang-member-arrested-after-attack-p/ |archive-date=2013-09-27 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Rivalries and alliances with other street and prison gangs ===

The National Gang Intelligence Center has noted a high number of Juggalo sets with ties to the Los Angeles-based Bloods gang, although the reason why Juggalos align themselves with Bloods sets remains unclear. In at least one case,  the gangs aligned because they share the same [[gang color]] (red).<ref name="NGIC" /> Bloods and Juggalos have also collaborated to commit drive-by shootings.<ref name="NGIC" />

In Pennsylvania, the Bloods and Crips dominate the incarcerated Juggalo gangs and use them for recruitment. In addition, certain Juggalo gangs have allied with violent prison gangs, including the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], [[Aryan Circle]], [[211 Crew]], and Aryan Brothers Liberation.<ref name="NGIC" />

=== Potential for violence ===

Juggalo gang members are notable for their tendency toward extremely brutal and wanton violence. Juggalo gangs generally prefer edged weapons such as hatchets, machetes, and medieval battle-axes to firearms, and said gangs have been linked to a string of grisly murders throughout the United States.<ref name="vasey1" /> According to the National Gang Intelligence Center, Juggalo gangs are a threat to the community because of their tendency for violence against law enforcement, innocent civilians, and other members of their group, and Juggalos in Colorado have become increasingly involved in violent crime, including aggravated assault and homicide.<ref name="NGIC" />

Several law enforcement officers have commented on the Juggalo gang's tendency toward extreme violence. Arizona Department of Public Safety Detective Michelle Vasey has also expressed concern at the Juggalos high potential for violence, stating "The weapons, they prefer, obviously, hatchets ... We've got battle-axes, we've got machetes, anything that can make the most violent, gruesome wound," and "Some of the homicides we're seeing with these guys are pretty nasty, gruesome, disgusting homicides, where they don't care who's around, what's around, they're just out to kill anybody."<ref name="vasey1" />

Juggalos are listed in [[Montana]]'s official handbook of [[prison gang|security threat groups]], which states that Juggalos are "a threat to law enforcement" and "very violent, many like blood." {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== Outside the United States ===

On June 28, 2010, three youths in [[Fairfield, New South Wales|Fairfield, Australia]] believed to have been Juggalos attempted to rob a 20-year-old woman waiting outside a club.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/violent-street-clowns-hit-sydney-meet-the-juggalos-and-juggalettes/story-e6freuy9-1225899704938 |title=Violent street clowns hit Sydney: Meet the Juggalos and Juggalettes |access-date=2015-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107014717/http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/violent-street-clowns-hit-sydney-meet-the-juggalos-and-juggalettes/story-e6freuy9-1225899704938 |archive-date=2015-01-07 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Differences between criminal and non-criminal Juggalos ==

Juggalo gang experts have stressed that not all self-proclaimed Juggalos are criminals or gang members. Detective Michelle Vasey has commented, "I don't want people to go out there and look at every Juggalo and say, 'Oh, he's a gang member, he's got a machete and he's going to slice and dice everybody.' But people need to be aware that there are huge issues that have evolved in just the last three years both in the eastern and western United States where we've got multiple individuals committing gang-related crimes, gang-motivated crimes, and they're using the name Juggalo."<ref name="vasey1" />

According to law enforcement research, including an interview with an admitted Juggalo gang member, the Juggalo subculture has recently split into two very different groups: the music fans and the criminal street gang. Some members of the Juggalos street gang even look down on non-criminal Juggalos, considering them to be weak,<ref name="NGIC" /> and criminal Juggalo gangs have committed attacks on non-gang-related Juggalos.

These criminal Juggalo subsets are being formed by a new generation of Juggalos who are attempting to evolve the Juggalo subculture into a collection of smaller gangs or cliques.<ref name="NGIC" />

The Juggalo subculture has several features in common with traditional gangs, including throwing [[gang signal|hand signs]], wearing matching clothing, and getting matching tattoos.<ref name="RMIN" /> However, criminal Juggalo subsets contain gang-like features that the general Juggalo population does not, including [[gang initiation]]s, handbooks detailing rules and punishments for gang members, formal leadership structure, gang colors, and the tendency to engage in organized patterns of serious criminal activity.<ref name="RMIN" /><ref name="NGIC" /><ref name="NEWGS" />

Police officers in Sacramento have stated that while a fast-growing gang using the Juggalo name is contained within the Juggalo subculture, most Juggalos are law-abiding citizens, which makes it difficult to tell the difference between Juggalo gang members and Juggalo fans.<ref name="sacramentocops">{{cite web|url=http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/video/6418520-local-police-say-juggalo-gangs-dangerous/|title=Local Police Say 'Juggalo' Gangs Dangerous|work=cbslocal.com|access-date=2014-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222022254/http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/video/6418520-local-police-say-juggalo-gangs-dangerous/|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Reaction of artists and FBI lawsuit==
The FBI's classification of Juggalos as a gang has caused confusion, resulting in many peaceful, non-criminal Juggalos being mistaken for their criminal counter-parts by police and by ordinary citizens.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} This type of confusion along with the fact that [[Hot Topic]] will no longer stock [[Psychopathic Records]] merchandise in states that legally consider Juggalos to be a gang, has prompted Insane Clown Posse to file a lawsuit against the FBI.<ref name="fbi lawsuit">{{cite web |author=Gary Ridley|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2012/09/insane_clown_posse_files_suit.html |title=Insane Clown Posse suing FBI in Flint federal court over Juggalo gang listing |publisher=MLive.com |access-date=2012-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104202030/http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2012/09/insane_clown_posse_files_suit.html |archive-date=2012-11-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> In December 2012, ICP and Psychopathic Records quietly agreed to withdraw as plaintiffs in the case,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and the FBI later released a report justifying their decision to classify Juggalos as a gang.

In an interview given in 2013, [[Shaggy 2 Dope]] of Insane Clown Posse addressed the Juggalo gang classification and the impending FBI lawsuit. He stated that at first he believed that the classification of Juggalos was "pretty dope" because it would afford the band a tougher image, but later changed his mind after realizing the negative repercussions of being labeled a gang, such as [[gang enhancement]]s for Juggalos who commit crimes. He also expressed concern about innocent Juggalos being targeted in "Shithole, Nebraska" by [[MS-13]] members. He argued that while some Juggalos are criminals and gang members, he does not believe that Juggalos as a whole constitute a gang.<ref name="WTXX-TV">{{cite web |last1=Ali |first1=Reyan |title=Exploring Insane Clown Posse's Case Against the FBI |url=http://www.ct.com/entertainment/music/shows/nm-ht19icp-20130509,0,7609173.story |website=WCCT |publisher=WTXX-TV |access-date=19 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625100828/http://www.ct.com/entertainment/music/shows/nm-ht19icp-20130509,0,7609173.story |archive-date=25 June 2013 |language=en |date=7 May 2013}}</ref>

== Gang identifiers ==

Gang identifiers used by Juggalo gang members include, but are not limited to:

* Gang colors, depending on the individual set, especially black, white, and red<ref name="RMIN" /><ref name="NGIC" />
* Psychopathic Records clothing and paraphernalia<ref name="RMIN" />
* Tattoos related to Insane Clown Posse and Psychopathic Records, including the six "joker's card" album covers and the record label's "Hatchet Man" logo.<ref name="NGIC" />
* Throwing gang signs<ref name="RMIN" /><ref name="NGIC"/>
* [[Evil clown]]-themed face paint, mainly in black and white paints<ref name="RMIN" /><ref name="NGIC"/>

==Perspective of law enforcement officers and gang investigators==
The emergence of Juggalo gang subsets has created a sharp divide between gang investigators in the United States, with some considering the entire subculture to fit the definition of a criminal gang, while others stress that the subculture's criminal element makes up only a small portion of the Juggalo population.<ref name="RMIN" /> A report released by the National Gang Intelligence Center in 2010 supports the latter assertion.<ref name="NGIC" />

A report released by the Rocky Mountain Information Network states that, "Just because we do not understand this phenomenon fully, we can’t as gang detectives ignore it ... We in law enforcement must be willing to take that extra step in our intelligence gathering to see if we are in fact dealing with a gang member or just a crazed fan."<ref name="RMIN" />

Detective Michelle Vasey has stated that not all Juggalos are violent or criminals, and the music is not to blame: "We can't necessarily say that [the music's] to blame. But I think it definitely does have some influences. As an officer we have to decide when we're talking to these guys, who do we need to worry about and who don't we need to worry about."<ref name="vasey1" />

Police Lt. Scott Conley has stated, "Those involved in the criminal side of (Juggalos) cause us some concern. If they are not involved in criminal activity, they can do their own thing, as long as they haven't crossed that criminal element line ... The attraction to that music, or those people following that music, I have no problem with. When they start breeding disruption in the community, showing up in libraries to harm people with butcher knives up their sleeves, I have a problem. I have to get involved with the community."

The official web site of Montana's department of corrections contains an explanation for Juggalos' classification as a security threat group: "the Juggalos are a recognized STG group that would never classify itself as a street gang. They are more like a cult that follows mimics and idolizes the music group, Insane Clown Posse. The music encourages and condones extreme acts of violence, which some Juggalos carry out. Juggalo members paint their faces black and white, dress in black clothing, attend raves together that often end violently, and consider themselves a family."<ref name="MTwebsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.cor.mt.gov/Facts/stg.mcpx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311144641/http://www.cor.mt.gov/Facts/stg.mcpx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-03-11 |title=Department of Corrections – Security Threat Group (STG) |publisher=Cor.mt.gov |date=2013-07-22 |access-date=2013-09-26 }}</ref>

However, some law enforcement officers have been firm in their assertion that Juggalos are a criminal group. Police watch commander Jay Mackanin of [[Citrus Heights]] has stated that, "Juggalos are a gang. I know sometimes they say they're not, but they are."<ref name="sacramentonews">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/insane-criminal-prosecution-fbi-vs/content?oid=12580063|title=Sacramento News & Review – Insane criminal prosecution: FBI vs. Juggalos comes to Sacramento – Feature Story – Local Stories – January 23, 2014|work=Sacramento News & Review|access-date=February 17, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204092524/http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/insane-criminal-prosecution-fbi-vs/content?oid=12580063|archive-date=February 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Kelly Snyder, a former [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] officer who tracks Juggalo activity across the U.S., has stated that "It almost has the taste of a cult...The perception is that something is obviously not right here...It's not going to stop. So far they are almost committing the perfect crime."<ref name="kellysnyder">{{cite web|url=http://www.jrn.com/kgun9/news/blueprint-for-murder-juggalos.html |title=Blueprint for murder? 9OYS investigates the 'Juggalo' connection |author=Marcelino Benito |work=KGUN |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521192908/http://www.jrn.com/kgun9/news/blueprint-for-murder-juggalos.html |archive-date=2014-05-21 }}</ref>
