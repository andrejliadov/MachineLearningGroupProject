A '''man''' is an adult [[male]] human. Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a [[boy]].

Like most other male [[mammal]]s, a man's [[genome]] inherits an [[X chromosome|X&nbsp;chromosome]] from his mother and a [[Y chromosome|Y&nbsp;chromosome]] from his father. The male [[fetus]] produces larger amounts of [[androgen]]s and smaller amounts of [[estrogen]]s than a female fetus. This difference in the relative amounts of these [[sex steroid]]s is responsible for the [[physiology|physiological]] differences that distinguish men from [[Woman|women]]. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes. However, there are exceptions to the above for some [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] men.

==Etymology and terminology==
{{Main|Man (word)}}
The English term "man" is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*man-'' (see [[Sanskrit]]/[[Avestan]] ''manu-'', [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''mǫž'' "man, male").<ref>''American Heritage Dictionary'', Appendix I: Indo-European Roots. [http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE295.html man-1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519035935/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE295.html|date=19 May 2006 }}. Accessed 2007-07-22.</ref> More directly, the word derives from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:mann#Old_English|mann]]''. The Old English form primarily meant "person" or "human being" and referred to men, women, and children alike. The Old English word for "man" was ''[[wikt:wer#Old_English|wer]]''. ''Mann'' only came to mean "man" in Middle English, replacing ''wer'', which survives today only in the compound "werewolf" (from Old English ''[[wikt:werwulf#Old_English|werwulf]]'', literallly "man-wolf").<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rauer |first1=Christine |title=Mann and Gender in Old English Prose: A Pilot Study |journal=Neophilologus |date=January 2017 |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=139–158 |doi=10.1007/s11061-016-9489-1|hdl=10023/8978 |s2cid=55817181 |hdl-access=free }}</ref><ref>Online Etymology Dictionary s.v.

{{Main|Secondary sexual characteristics|Sex differences in humans}}
{{see also|Trans man|Intersexuality}}

In human beings, the sex of an individual is determined at the time of [[fertilization]] by the genetic material carried in the [[Spermatozoon|sperm]] cell. If a sperm cell carrying an [[X chromosome]] fertilizes the [[ovum|egg]], the offspring will typically be female (XX). On the other hand, if a sperm cell carrying a [[Y chromosome]] fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be male (XY). Persons whose anatomy or chromosomal makeup differ from this pattern are referred to as [[intersex]].

Like most other male [[mammal]]s, a man's [[genome]] typically inherits an [[X chromosome|X&nbsp;chromosome]] from his mother and a [[Y chromosome|Y&nbsp;chromosome]] from his father. The male [[fetus]] produces larger amounts of [[androgen]]s and smaller amounts of [[estrogen]]s than a female fetus. This difference in the relative amounts of these [[sex steroid]]s is largely responsible for the [[physiology|physiological]] differences that distinguish men from women.

Humans exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]] in many characteristics, many of which have no direct link to reproductive ability, although most of these characteristics do have a role in sexual attraction. Most expressions of sexual dimorphism in humans are found in height, weight, and body structure, though there are always examples that do not follow the overall pattern. For example, men tend to be taller than women, but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid-height range for the species.

Primary sex characteristics (or sex organs) are characteristics that are present at birth and are integral to the reproductive process. For men, primary sex characteristics include the penis and testicles. Secondary sex characteristics are features that appear during [[puberty]] in [[human]]s.<ref name="Melmed">{{cite book |vauthors=Melmed S, Polonsky KS, Larsen PR, Kronenberg HM|title=Williams Textbook of Endocrinology E-Book|publisher=[[Elsevier Health Sciences]]|isbn=1437736009|year=2011|page=1054|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbg1QOAObicC&pg=PA1054}}</ref><ref name="Pack">{{cite book |vauthors=Pack PE|title=CliffsNotes AP Biology, 5th Edition|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|isbn=0544784170|year=2016|page=219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsalDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA219}}</ref> Such features are especially evident in the [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] [[phenotypic trait]]s that distinguish between the sexes, but—unlike the primary sex characteristics—are not directly part of the [[reproductive system]].<ref name="Bjorklund">{{cite book |vauthors=Bjorklund DF, Blasi CH|title=Child and Adolescent Development: An Integrated Approach|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=113316837X|year=2011|pages=152–153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTQIAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA152}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://sciencing.com/primary-secondary-sexual-characteristics-8557301.html|title=Primary & Secondary Sexual Characteristics|work=Sciencing.com|date=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Reproduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4RlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA103|year=2018|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-815145-7|page=103}}</ref> Secondary sexual characteristics that are specific to men include:

===Reproductive system===
{{main|Male reproductive system (human)}}
The male reproductive system includes external and internal genitalia. The male external genitalia consist of the [[human penis|penis]], the male urethra, and the scrotum, while the male internal genitalia consist of the testes, the prostate, the epididymis, the seminal vesicle, the vas deferens, the ejaculatory duct, and the bulbourethral gland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33684|title=Definition of Male genitalia|website=MedicineNet}}</ref>

The male reproductive system's function is to produce [[semen]], which carries [[spermatozoon|sperm]] and thus [[DNA|genetic information]] that can unite with an egg within a woman. Since sperm that enters a woman's [[uterus]] and then [[fallopian tubes]] goes on to [[Fertilization|fertilize]] an egg which develops into a [[fetus]] or child, the male reproductive system plays no necessary role during the [[gestation]]. The study of male reproduction and associated organs is called [[andrology]].

===Sex hormones===

In mammals, the [[hormones]] that influence sexual differentiation and development are [[androgens]] (mainly [[testosterone]]), which stimulate later development of the ovary. In the sexually undifferentiated [[embryo]], testosterone stimulates the development of the [[Wolffian duct]]s, the penis, and closure of the [[labioscrotal folds]] into the scrotum.  Another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the [[anti-Müllerian hormone]], which inhibits the development of the [[Müllerian duct]]s. For males during puberty, testosterone, along with [[gonadotropin]]s released by the [[pituitary gland]], stimulates [[spermatogenesis]].

===Health===
{{Main|Gender disparities in health}}
Although in general men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women, they suffer from slightly more illnesses in comparison to women. Men have lower life expectancy<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-life-expectancy-lo/|title=Why is life expectancy longer for women than it is for men?|website=Scientific American|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> and higher [[suicide]] rates<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2012/09/24/the-gender-inequality-of-suicide-why-are-men-at-such-high-risk/|title=The Gender Inequality of Suicide: Why Are Men at Such High Risk?|last=Walton|first=Alice G.|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> compared to women.

== Sexuality and gender ==
{{Main|Human male sexuality}}

Male sexuality and attraction vary from person to person, and a man's sexual behavior can be affected by many factors, including [[evolutionary psychology|evolved predispostions]], [[personality]], [[parenting|upbringing]], and [[culture]]. While the majority of men are [[heterosexual]], significant minorities are [[homosexual]] or [[bisexual]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=J.

A small percentage of people [[Sex assignment|assigned]] [[female]] at birth may [[Gender identity|identify]] as male (typically referred to as [[Trans man|transgender men]]). In contrast, some people assigned male at birth may identify as female (typically referred to as [[transgender woman]]). Some people assigned male at birth may also identify as [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]].<ref name="MorrowMessinger">''Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression in Social Work Practice'', edited by Deana F. Morrow and Lori Messinger (2006, {{ISBN|0-231-50186-2}}</ref> There are also [[intersex]] people who may identify as either female or male.

Anthropology has shown that masculinity itself has [[social status]], just like wealth, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and social class.  In [[Western culture]], for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status. Many English words such as ''virtue'' and ''virile'' (from the [[Indo-European root]] ''vir'' meaning ''man'') reflect this.<ref>{{cite web |title=Virtue (2009) |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |year=2009 |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virtue |access-date=8 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Virile (2009) |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |year=2009 |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virile |access-date=8 June 2009}}</ref>

The [[Gender role#Talcott Parsons' view|Parsons model]] was used to contrast and illustrate extreme positions on gender roles. Model A describes total separation of male and female roles, while Model B describes the complete dissolution of barriers between gender roles.<ref>Brockhaus: Enzyklopädie der Psychologie, 2001.</ref>
