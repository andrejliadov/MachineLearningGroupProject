===Birthright===
[[File:Esau and Jacob Presented to Isaac.jpg|thumb|right|340px|Esau and Jacob Presented to Isaac (painting circa 1779–1801 by [[Benjamin West]])]]
In Genesis, Esau returned to his twin brother Jacob, famished from the fields. He begs Jacob to give him some "red pottage" (a play on his nickname, {{lang-he|אדום}}''`Edom'', meaning "red".) This refers to his red hair.<ref>{{Bibleref|Genesis|25:25|NASB}}</ref> Jacob offers Esau a bowl of [[lentil]] stew{{efn|{{Lang-he|נְזִיד עֲדָשִׁ֔ים}} ''nezid ‘adashim''}} in exchange for Esau's birthright ({{Lang-he|בְּכֹרָה}} ''bəḵōrāh'', the right to be recognized as firstborn son with authority over the family), and Esau agrees. Thus Jacob acquires Esau's birthright. This is the origin of the English phrase "for a [[mess of pottage]]".

In {{Bibleref|Genesis|27:1–40|JPR}}, Jacob uses deception, motivated by his mother [[Rebecca]], to lay claim to his blind father Isaac's blessing that was inherently due to the firstborn, Esau.

In {{Bibleref|Genesis|27:5–7|JPR}}, Rebecca is listening while Isaac speaks to his son Esau. When Esau goes to the field to hunt for venison to bring home, Rebekah says to her son Jacob, "Behold, I heard thy father speak to thy brother Esau, saying: 'Bring me venison and prepare a savoury food, that I may eat, and bless thee before the Lord before my death.'" Rebecca then instructs Jacob in an elaborate deception through which Jacob pretends to be Esau, in order to steal from Esau his blessing from Isaac and his inheritance—which in theory Esau had already agreed to give to Jacob. Jacob follows through with the plan to steal his brother's birthright by bringing the meal his father Isaac requested and pretending to be Esau. Jacob pulled off his disguise by covering himself in hairy lamb skin so that when his blind father went to touch him, his smooth skin did not give him away as an imposter of his hairy brother. Jacob successfully received his father Isaac's blessing. As a result, Jacob becomes the spiritual leader of the family after Isaac's death and the heir of the promises of Abraham ({{Bibleref|Genesis|27:37|JPR}}).

When Esau learns of his brother's thievery, he is livid and begs his father to undo the blessing. Isaac responds to his eldest son's plea by saying that he only had one blessing to give and that he could not reverse the sacred blessing. Esau is furious and vows to kill Jacob ({{Bibleref|Genesis|27:41|JPR}}). Once again Rebecca intervenes to save her younger son from being murdered by his elder twin brother, Esau.

Therefore, at Rebecca's urging, Jacob flees to a distant land to work for his uncle [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] ({{Bibleref|Genesis|28:5|JPR}}). Jacob does not immediately receive his father's inheritance after the impersonation aimed at taking it from Esau. Having fled for his life, Jacob has left the wealth of Isaac's flocks, land and tents in Esau's hands. Jacob is forced to sleep out on the open ground and then work for wages as a servant in Laban's household. Jacob, who had deceived and cheated his brother, is in turn deceived and cheated by his uncle. Jacob asks to marry Laban's daughter Rachel, whom he has met at the well, and Laban agrees, if Jacob will give him seven years of service. Jacob does so, but after the wedding finds that beneath the veil is not Rachel but Leah, Laban's elder daughter. He agrees to work another seven years and Jacob and Rachel are finally wed. However, despite Laban, Jacob eventually becomes so rich as to incite the envy of Laban and Laban's sons.

[[File:Francesco Hayez 061.jpg|thumb|[[Francesco Hayez]]: ''Esau and Jacob reconcile'' (1844)]]
{{Bibleref|Genesis|32–33|JPR}} tells of Jacob's and Esau's eventual reconciliation. Jacob sends multiple waves of gifts to Esau as they approach each other, hoping that Esau will spare his life. Esau refuses the gifts, as he is now very wealthy and does not need them. Jacob never apologizes to Esau for his actions; Jacob nevertheless bows down before Esau and insists on his receiving the gifts. Esau shows forgiveness in spite of this bitter conflict.  (After this, God confirms his renaming of Jacob as "Israel".)

===Jacob's deception===
Genesis Chapter 27 verse 16 of the King James Version Bible:  "And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck:"
Verse 19:  "And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me."
Verse 22-23: "And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him."

===Family===
{{Bibleref|Genesis|26:34–35|JPR}} describes Esau's marriage at the age of forty to two [[Canaan]]ite women: [[Judith (Genesis)|Judith]] the daughter of Beeri the [[Hittites|Hittite]], and [[Basemath]] the daughter of Elon the Hittite. This arrangement grieved his parents.<ref>{{Bibleref|Genesis|26:34–35|JPR}}</ref> Upon seeing that his brother was blessed and that their father rejected Esau's union to Canaanites, Esau went to the house of his uncle [[Ishmael]] and married his cousin,<ref>Mandel. ''Ultimate Who's Who'', p. 176</ref> [[Mahalath]] the daughter of Ishmael, and sister of [[Nebajoth]]. Esau's family is again revisited in {{Bibleref|Genesis|36|JPR}}, this passage names two Canaanite wives; [[Adhah|Adah]], the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and [[Aholibamah]], the daughter of Anah, daughter of Zibeon the Hivite, and a third: Bashemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. Some scholars equate the three wives mentioned in Genesis 26 and 28 with those in Genesis 36.<ref name = "Phillips, 284" >Phillips.

== Other references ==

===Minor prophet references===
Esau was also known as Edom, the progenitor of the Edomites who were established to the south of the Israelites. They were an enemy nation of Israel.<ref>Peter Ackroyd, ''Exile and Restoration: A Study in Hebrew Thought of the Sixth Century B.C.'', 1968, p.&nbsp;224.</ref> The minor prophets, such as [[Obadiah]], claim that the Edomites participated in the destruction of the First Temple by [[Nebuchadnezzar]] in 587 BC. Exactly how the Edomites participated is not clear. [[Psalm 137]] ("By the waters of Babylon") suggests merely that Edom had encouraged the Babylonians: The Lord is asked to "remember against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem, how they said 'raze it, raze it to its foundations'".<ref>Psalm 137:7</ref> But the prophecy of Obadiah insists on the literal "violence done" by Esau "unto your brother Jacob" when the Edomites "entered the gate of my people..., looted his goods..., stood at the parting of the ways to cut off the fugitive,... delivered up his survivors on his day of distress".<ref>{{Bibleref|Obadiah|10:13–14|JPR}}</ref>

By the [[intertestamental period]], Edom had replaced Babylon as the nation that actually burned the Temple ("Thou hast also vowed to build thy temple, which the Edomites burned when Judah was laid waste by the Chaldees"<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/study/1_Esdras_4 1 Esdras 4:45]</ref>).

===New Testament references===
{{bibleverse||Hebrews|12:15–16|NIV}} depicts Esau as unspiritual for thoughtlessly throwing away his birthright. {{bibleverse||Romans|9:13}} states "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated," based upon {{bibleverse||Malachi|1:2-3}} although this passage goes on to depict the nations of Israel (Jacob) and Edom (Esau).

== Rabbinic Jewish sources ==

The [[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]] connects the name Esau to the Hebrew ''asah'', stating, "because he was born fully completed, with hair of the head, beard, teeth, and molars."<ref name="Anderson, 35">{{Cite book | last = Anderson | first = Bradford A. | title = Brotherhood and Inheritance: A Canonical Reading of the Esau and Edom Traditions | publisher = T&T Clark International | date = 2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=766oAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA35 | isbn = 9780567368256 | page = 35 }}</ref> Other traditional sources connect the word with the Hebrew ''šāv`'' ({{lang-he|שָׁוְא}}) meaning "worthless."<ref>Anderson, Bradford A. (2011). ''Brotherhood and Inheritance: A Canonical Reading of the Esau and Edom Traditions.'' T&T Clark International. p. 35. {{ISBN|9780567368256}}.</ref>

Jewish commentaries have shed a negative view on Esau because of his rivalry with Jacob. The Midrash says that during Rebekah's pregnancy whenever she would pass a house of Torah study, Jacob would struggle to come out; whenever she would pass a house of [[idolatry]], Esau would agitate to come out.<ref>[[Genesis Rabba|Bereshit Rabbah]] 63:6.</ref>

He is considered to be a rebellious son who kept a double life until he was 15, when he sold his birthright to Jacob. According to the [[Talmud]], the sale of the birthright took place immediately after Abraham died.<ref>[[Bava Batra]] 16b.</ref> The Talmudic dating would give both Esau and Jacob an age of 15 at the time. The lentils Jacob was cooking were meant for his father Isaac, because lentils are the traditional mourner's meal for Jews.  On that day before returning, in a rage over the death of Abraham, Esau committed five sins; he raped a betrothed young woman, he committed murder ([[Nimrod]]), he denied God, he denied the resurrection of the dead, and he spurned his birthright.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.16b.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Bava Batra 16b]</ref>

[[Haman]]'s lineage is given in the [[Targum Sheni]] as follows: "Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, son of Srach, son of Buza, son of Iphlotas, son of Dyosef, son of Dyosim, son of Prome, son of Ma'dei, son of Bla'akan, son of Intimros, son of Haridom, son of Sh'gar, son of Nigar, son of Farmashta, son of Vayezatha, (son of Agag, son of Sumkei,) son of [[Amalek]], son of the concubine of [[Eliphaz]], firstborn son of Esau".

According to Rashi, Isaac, when blessing Jacob in Esau's place, smelled the heavenly scent of Gan Eden (Paradise) when Jacob entered his room and, in contrast, perceived [[Gehenna]] opening beneath Esau when the latter entered the room, showing him that he had been deceived all along by Esau's show of piety.<ref>''Pirkei d'Rav Kahana'', quoted in Scherman, p. 139.</ref>

===Death===
[[File:Brugghen, Hendrick ter - Esau Selling His Birthright - c. 1627.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Esau Selling His Birthright'' by [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]] c. 1627]]
According to the [[Babylonian Talmud]], Esau was killed by [[List of minor biblical figures#Hushim|Hushim]], son of [[Dan (Bible)|Dan]], son of [[Jacob]], because Esau obstructed the burial of Jacob into the [[cave of Machpelah]]. When Jacob was brought to be buried in the cave, Esau prevented the burial, claiming he had the right to be buried in the cave; after some negotiation [[Naphtali]] was sent to Egypt to retrieve the document stating Esau sold his part in the cave to Jacob. [[List of minor biblical figures#Hushim|Hushim]] (who was hard of hearing) did not understand what was going on, and why his grandfather was not being buried, so he asked for an explanation; after being given one he became angry and said: "Is my grandfather to lie there in contempt until Naphtali returns from the land of Egypt?" He then took a club and killed Esau, and Esau's head rolled into the cave.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sotah.13a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Sotah 13a]</ref> This means that the head of Esau is also buried in the cave.

Jewish sources state that Esau sold his right to be buried in the cave. According to [[Shemot Rabbah]], Jacob gave all his possessions to acquire a tomb in the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]]. He put a large pile of gold and silver before Esau and asked, “My brother, do you prefer your portion of this cave, or all this gold and silver?”<ref>[[Shemot Rabbah]] 31:17</ref> Esau's selling to Jacob his right to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs is also recorded in ''Sefer HaYashar''.<ref>[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|''Sefer Hayashar'']] Chapter 27 p. 77b</ref>

===Jubilees===
In the [[Jubilees|Book of Jubilees]], Esau's father, Isaac, compels Esau to swear not to attack or kill Jacob after Isaac has died. However, after the death of Isaac, the sons of Esau convince their father to lead them, and hired mercenaries, against Jacob in order to kill Jacob and his family and seize their wealth (especially the portion of Isaac's wealth that Isaac had left to Jacob upon his death). "Then Ya'aqov bent his bow and sent forth the arrow and struck Esau, his brother on his right breast and slew him (Jubilees 38:2) . . . Ya'aqov buried his brother on the hill which is in Aduram, and he returned to his house (Jubilees 38:9b)."

== Reputed grave on the West Bank ==
South of the Palestinian town of [[Sa'ir]] on the West Bank there is a tomb reputed to be that of Esau –  El 'Ais in his Arab name.

The [[Palestine Exploration Fund|PEF]]'s [[PEF Survey of Palestine|''Survey of Western Palestine'' (SWP)]],  wrote that: "The tomb is in a chamber 37 feet east and west by 20 feet north and south, with a [[Mihrab]] on the south wall. The tomb is 12 feet long, 3 1/2 feet broad, 5 feet high, covered with a dark green cloth and a canopy above. An [[ostrich egg]] is hung near. North of the chamber is a vaulted room of equal size, and to the east is an open court with a fig-tree, and a second [[cenotaph]] rudely plastered, said to be that of Esau's slave. Rock-cut tombs exist south-west of this place."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/379/mode/1up|title=The survey of western Palestine : memoirs of the topography, orography, hydrography, and archaeology|work=archive.org}}</ref>
