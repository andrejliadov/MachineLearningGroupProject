===Relationship to Boris Johnson===

Arcuri had a close friendship with then-Mayor of London [[Boris Johnson]],<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-49794693 |title = PM Defends Actions over Conflict of Interest Claims|work = BBC News|date = 23 September 2019}}</ref> with ''The Sunday Times'' describing him as a regular visitor to her flat,<ref>{{cite news|author=May Bulman |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/boris-johnson-jennifer-arcuri-model-london-mayor-friendship-conflict-interest-a9115211.html |title=Boris Johnson facing questions over relationship with ex-model Jennifer Arcuri |work=The Independent |date=22 September 2019 |access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> and implying they were in a sexual relationship.<ref name="auto1">{{cite news | url=https://news.sky.com/story/boris-johnson-refuses-six-times-to-answer-questions-about-funding-for-close-friend-11817579 |title = Boris Johnson breaks silence on relationship with entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri|date=25 September 2019|last=Coates|first=Sam|work=Sky News}}</ref> Innotech, her company, was awarded £10,000 from a mayoral fund in 2013, followed the next year by Arcuri being awarded £15,000 from a government programme. Johnson intervened to allow her onto three trade mission trips.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/boris-johnson-jennifer-arcuri_uk_5d8794f3e4b0849d472ad0dc | title=Boris Johnson Facing Questions over Giving Public Money to American Woman| date=22 September 2019}}</ref> However, ''The Sunday Times'' claimed in September 2019 that Johnson failed to declare his personal relationship as a conflict of interest.<ref>{{cite news|author=Matthew Weaver |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/22/boris-johnson-urged-to-justify-awarding-public-funds-to-close-friend-jennifer-arcuri |title=Boris Johnson urged to justify 'awarding public funds to close friend' |work=The Guardian |access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> Later that month, the Greater London Authority referred Johnson and his actions in the matter to the [[Independent Office for Police Conduct]] (IOPC) "so it can assess whether or not it is necessary to investigate the former mayor of London for the criminal offence of misconduct in public office". The IOPC is involved because the Mayor is also London's [[police and crime commissioner]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49859321|title=PM's links to Arcuri referred to police watchdog|date=27 September 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The [[London Assembly]] commenced its own investigation, but paused it at the IOPC's request in order to avoid overlap. On 9 November 2019 it was revealed that the IOPC, which had been due to publish a report on its investigation, had decided to do so after the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|general election of 12 December]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/09/boris-johnson-jennifer-arcuri-iopc-delay-announcement-investigation|last=Townsend|first=Mark|title=Fury as decision on police inquiry into PM shelved until after election|work=The Guardian|date=10 November 2019|access-date=11 November 2019}}</ref>

On 22 May 2020, the IOPC announced that they would not proceed with a criminal investigation. The IOPC said in its statement "While there was no evidence that Mr. Johnson influenced the payment of sponsorship monies or participation in trade missions, there was evidence to suggest that those officers making decisions about sponsorship monies and attendance on trade missions thought that there was a close relationship between Mr. Johnson and Ms. Arcuri, and this influenced their decision-making."

On 17 October 2020, Arcuri confirmed that her relationship with Johnson had been sexual.<ref>{{Cite web|last=staff|first=Guardian|date=2020-10-17|title=Jennifer Arcuri 'admits to Boris Johnson affair'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/16/jennifer-arcuri-admits-to-boris-johnson-affair|access-date=2020-10-17|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref>
