He studied [[physics]] at the [[University of São Paulo]], in [[São Paulo]], from 1960 to 1964, and also at the [[University of Naples]], in [[Naples]], [[Italy]] (1970–71). From 1966 to 1968 he specialized in [[theoretical physics]] at the [[University of Pisa]] ([[relativity theory]]), in [[mathematical physics]] at the [[University of Munich]], in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] (1968–1969) and in [[dynamic systems]] at the University of Naples again.

From 1974 to 1995, Candotti was a professor with the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]]. Currently he is a professor at the [[:pt:Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo|Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo]], in [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]], state of [[Espírito Santo]].
