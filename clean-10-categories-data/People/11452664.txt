'''Gregory Hancock Hemingway''' (November 12, 1931 &ndash; October 1, 2001), also known as '''Gloria Hemingway''' in later life, was the third and youngest child of author [[Ernest Hemingway]].

A good athlete and a crack shot, Gregory longed to be a typical Hemingway hero and trained as a [[professional hunter]] in Africa. But his alcoholism prevented his gaining a licence, as it also cost him his medical licence in America. Gregory maintained a long-running feud with his father, stemming from a 1951 incident when Gregory’s drug-taking and unsuitable first marriage caused a shouting match between Ernest and Gregory's mother [[Pauline Pfeiffer|Pauline]], so violent that she died from a stress-related condition. His bestselling memoir of his father, ''Papa'', was seen by some to reflect troubles of his own. These included a habit of dressing in women’s clothes, which he ascribed to [[gender dysphoria]]. A course of [[sex reassignment surgery]] from male to female was incomplete at the time of his death.

==Early life==
Born in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], to novelist Ernest Hemingway and his second wife, [[Pauline Pfeiffer]], he was in childhood called Gigi or Gig and was, according to a close observer, "a tremendous athlete" and a "crack shot."<ref name=memories /><ref name=vh167>Valerie Hemingway, 119, 167</ref> As an adult, he preferred the name Greg.<ref name="Valerie Hemingway, 214">Valerie Hemingway, 214</ref> Hemingway attended the [[Canterbury School (Connecticut)|Canterbury School]], a Catholic prep school in Connecticut, graduating in 1949.<ref>Lou Mandler, "The Hemingways at Canterbury," ''The Hemingway Review'', March 22, 2010</ref> He dropped out of [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College, Annapolis]], after one year<ref name=dt>''Daily Telegraph'': [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1358482/Gregory-Hemingway.html "Gregory Hemingway," October 5, 2001], accessed July 1, 2011</ref> and worked for a time as an aircraft mechanic<ref name=ind>''The Independent'': [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gregory-hemingway-9194049.html "Gregory Hemingway," October 10, 2001], accessed February 8, 2015.</ref> before moving to California in 1951.

Greg married against his father's wishes. Illegal drug-taking eventually led to his arrest.<ref name=dt /> The incident prompted his father to lash out viciously at his mother, Pauline, in a phone call. Unknown to anyone, Pauline had a rare tumor of the [[adrenal gland]] that can cause a deadly surge of adrenaline in times of stress. Within hours of the phone call with Ernest, she had died of shock on a hospital operating table. Ernest blamed his son for Pauline's death, and Greg was deeply disturbed by the accusation. It was years before Greg and Ernest spoke with each other, and Greg never saw his father alive again.<ref name=ind />

Greg Hemingway retreated to Africa, where he drank alcohol and shot elephants.<ref name=dt /> He spent the next three years in Africa as an apprentice professional hunter but failed to obtain a license because of his drinking.<ref name=ind /> He joined and left the U.S. Army in the 1950s, suffered from mental illness, was institutionalized for a time, and received several dozen treatments with [[electroconvulsive therapy]].<ref name=dt /> Of another period shooting elephants he wrote: "I went back to Africa to do more killing. Somehow it was therapeutic."<ref name=ind /> It wasn't until nearly a decade later, in 1960, that he felt strong enough to resume his medical studies and respond to his father's charges. He wrote his father a bitter letter, detailing the medical facts of his mother's death and blaming Ernest for the tragedy. The next year, Ernest Hemingway killed himself, and again Greg wrestled with guilt over the death of a parent.

He obtained a medical degree from the [[Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine|University of Miami Medical School]]<ref name=nytobit>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/05/arts/gregory-h-hemingway-69-wrote-a-memoir-called-papa.html Thomas J.

==Relationship with Ernest Hemingway==
[[File:Ernest and Gregory Hemingway in Cuba c1950.jpg|thumb|Ernest and Gregory shooting live pigeons at the ''Club de Cazadores'' in Cuba. The photo is not dated but Gregory's apparent age and Hemingway's beard (worn mid-1942&ndash;1945) suggests early 1940s, probably 1943.]]
Father and son were estranged for many years, beginning when Gregory was 19.<ref name=vh167 /> As an attempt at reconciliation, Hemingway sent his father a telegram in October 1954 to congratulate him on being awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] and received $5,000 in return. They had intermittent contact thereafter.<ref name=ind /> He wrote a short account of his father's life and their strained relationship, ''Papa: A Personal Memoir'' that became a bestseller.<ref>Gregory H. Hemingway, ''Papa: A Personal Memoir'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1976)</ref> When it appeared in 1976, the preface by [[Norman Mailer]] said: "There is nothing slavish here....For once, you can read a book about Hemingway and not have to decide whether you like him or not."<ref name=ind /> The ''[[New York Times]]'' called it "a small miracle" and "artfully elliptical" in presenting "gloriously romantic adventures" with "a thin cutting edge of malice."<ref>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/16/archives/books-of-the-times-the-old-man-and-his-son.html Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, "The Old Man and His Son," June 16, 1976], accessed June 27, 2011</ref> Hemingway wrote of his own ambitions in the shadow of his father's fame: "What I really wanted to be was a Hemingway hero."<ref name=nytobit /> Of his father he wrote: "The man I remembered was kind, gentle, elemental in his vastness, tormented beyond endurance, and although we always called him papa, it was out of love, not fear."<ref name=nytobit /> He quoted his father as telling him: "You make your own luck, Gig" and "You know what makes a good loser? Practice."<ref>Gregory H. Hemingway, ''Papa'', 119. Collections of Ernest Hemingway's quotations often combine the two statements into one.</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine criticized the author's "churlishness" and called his work "a bitter jumble of unsorted resentments and anguished love."<ref>''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914417-2,00.html "Books: Notable," July 26, 1976], accessed June 27, 2011</ref> His daughter Lorian responded to ''Papa'' with a letter to ''Time'' that said, "I would also like to know what type of person the author is...I haven't seen him for eight years...I think it sad that I learn more about him by reading articles and gossip columns than from my own communication with him."<ref>''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918234-3,00.html "Forum," August 30, 1976], accessed June 27, 2011</ref>

According to his wife Valerie, Hemingway enjoyed his father's portrayal of him as Andrew in ''Islands in the Stream'' (1970) and later used the text as the epigraph to his memoir of his father.<ref name="Valerie Hemingway, 214"/> Valerie included this text as the epigraph to her own tribute to "Gregory H. Hemingway" written two years after his death:<ref name=Tribute>Valerie Hemingway, "A tribute to Gregory H. Hemingway," ''The Hemingway Review'', vol. 22, 2003, [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+tribute+to+Gregory+H.+Hemingway.-a0105518231 available online], accessed June 30, 2011</ref>

{{quote|The smallest boy was fair and was built like a pocket battle-ship. He was a Copy of Thomas Hudson, physically, reduced in scale and widened and shortened. His skin freckled when it tanned and he had a humorous face and was born being very old. He was a devil too, and deviled both his older brothers, and he had a dark side to him that nobody except Thomas Hudson could ever understand. Neither of them thought about this except that they recognized it in each other and knew it was bad and the man respected it and understood the boy's having it. They were very close to each other although Thomas Hudson had never been as much with this boy as with the others. This youngest boy, Andrew, was a precocious excellent athlete and he had been marvelous with horses since he had first ridden. The other boys were very proud of him but they did not want any nonsense from him, either. He was a little unbelievable and anyone could well have doubted his feats except that many people had seen him ride and watched him jump and seen his cold, professional modesty. He was a boy born to be quite wicked who was being very good and he carried his wickedness around with him transmuted into a sort of teasing gaiety. But he was a bad boy and the others knew it and he knew it. He was just being good while his badness grew inside him.|''Islands in the Stream''}}

==Middle years==
In the course of his first four marriages, Gregory Hemingway had eight children: Patrick, Edward, Sean, Brendan, Vanessa, Maria, John, and Lorian. One of his marriages, to [[Valerie Danby-Smith]], Ernest Hemingway's secretary, lasted almost 20 years.<ref name=memories>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/sports/baseball/07hemingway.html Joshua Robinson, "Memories of Playing on Papa Hemingway’s Ball Field ," October 6, 2008], accessed June 27, 2011.

In 1972, [[Maia Wojciechowska|Maia Rodman]], Hemingway's childhood tennis coach and a family friend who had fallen in love with him, dedicated her book ''The Life and Death of a Brave Bull'' to Gregory.<ref>Valerie Hemningway, 229</ref>

He practiced medicine in the 1970s and 1980s, first in New York and then as a rural family doctor in Montana, first in [[Fort Benton, Montana|Fort Benton]] and later as the medical officer for [[Garfield County, Montana|Garfield County]], based in [[Jordan, Montana|Jordan]], Montana.<ref name=trib /> Interviewed there, he said: "When I smell the sagebrush or see the mountains, or a vast clean stream, I love those things. Some of my happiest memories of childhood were associated with the West."<ref name=nytobit /> In 1988, authorities in Montana declined to renew Hemingway's medical license because of his [[alcoholism]].<ref name=macswan /> Hemingway battled [[bipolar disorder]], alcoholism, and [[drug abuse]] for many years.<ref name="BBC">[[BBC News]]. 3 October 2003.

Hemingway and his brothers tried to protect their father's name and their inheritance by taking legal action to stop the popular local celebrations called "Hemingway Days" in [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], Florida.<ref name=ind /> In 1999, they collaborated in creating a business venture, Hemingway Ltd., to market the family name as "an up-scale lifestyle accessory brand".<ref name=dt /> Their first venture created controversy by putting the Hemingway name on a line of shotguns.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Gender identity==
For years, Hemingway claimed, he had experienced gender dysphoria.<ref>Valerie Hemingway, "Running with the Bulls," 2005.</ref> He experimented with wearing women's clothes on a number of occasions.<ref>Valerie Hemingway, 235; Mark Spilka, ''Renewing the Normative D.H. Lawrence: A Personal Progress'' (University of Missouri Press, 1992), 210n14</ref> Wife Valerie wrote:<ref name=trib />

{{quote|All his life Greg fought a losing battle against this crippling illness. He lacked critical early help because his parents were unable or unwilling to accept his condition nor could he come to terms with it himself for a long time, taking up the study of medicine in the hope that he would find a cure, or at least a solace. Failing that, he developed an alternate persona, a character into which he could retreat from the unbearable responsibilities of being, among other things, his father's son, and of never ever measuring up to what was expected of him, or to what he expected of himself.}}

Hemingway considered sex reassignment surgery as early as 1973.<ref>Valerie Hemingway, 261-2, 265</ref> He had the surgery in 1995 and began using the name Gloria on occasion.<ref name="WashPost">''Washington Post'': [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41351-2004Nov10.html Jonathan Yardley, "A Writer's Companion," November 11, 2004], accessed May 27, 2007</ref> Despite the surgery, Hemingway, presenting as a man, remarried Galliher in 1997 in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]].<ref name=miami>''Miami Herald'': [https://web.archive.org/web/20031007070721/https://miami.com/mld/miamiherald/6829972.htm Carol Rabin Miller, "Gender of Hemingway's son at center of feud," September 22, 2003], accessed June 27, 2011</ref>

Hemingway's public persona remained male. As Gregory, he gave interviews about his father as late as 1999.<ref>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/18/magazine/ernest-hemingway-s-war-wounds.html D.T.

Hemingway's transition from male to female was a long process left incomplete at his death. He had breast implant surgery on one breast and then had it reversed.<ref name=trib /> He was sometimes seen in women's attire;<ref name=trib /> yet, dressed as a man, he frequented a local tavern and presented as what a patron called "just one of the guys."<ref name=trib /> When he was arrested just days before his death, he first gave the police the name Greg Hemingway, then changed it to Gloria.<ref name=macswan>Reuters: [http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/GregoryHemingway.html Angus MacSwan, "Gregory Hemingway, Son of Writer, Dies in Miami," October 5, 2001], accessed June 27, 2011</ref>

==Death==
Hemingway died October 1, 2001 of [[hypertension]] and [[cardiovascular disease]] in Miami-Dade Women's Detention Center. That day, Hemingway was due in court to answer charges of [[indecent exposure]] and resisting arrest without violence.<ref name=macswan /> Hemingway had been living in Florida for more than ten years.<ref name=nytobit />

In most obituaries, he was called Gregory, but ''Time'' magazine published a brief notice of the death of "Gloria Hemingway, 69, transsexual youngest son turned daughter of novelist Ernest Hemingway" and noted the novelist once said Gregory had "the biggest dark side in the family except me."<ref>''TIME'': [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001009,00.html "Milestones," October 15, 2001], accessed June 27, 2011</ref> The gravestone reads: "Dr. Gregory Hancock Hemingway 1931–2001". He is buried next to his father and half-brother [[Jack Hemingway|Jack]] in the Ketchum, Idaho cemetery.

Hemingway left two wills. One will left most of the $7 million estate to Galliher. The other left most of it to Hemingway's children.<ref name=miami /><ref>Gumbel, Andrew.
