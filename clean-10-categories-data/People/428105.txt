A '''billionaire''' is a person with a [[net worth]] of at least [[1,000,000,000|one billion]] (1,000,000,000, i.e. a thousand million) units of a given [[currency]], usually major currencies such as the [[United States dollar]], the [[euro]],   [[pound sterling]].

According to a 2016 [[Oxfam]] report, the wealth of the poorest 95% dropped by 38% between 2010 and 2015, thanks to an increase in the [[global population]] of 400 million.<ref name="Oxfam" /> In the same period, the wealth of the richest 62 people between [[the World's Billionaires]] increased by $500bn (£350bn) to $1.76tn. This number{{clarify|date=December 2019}} has fallen dramatically from 388 as recently as 2010. More recently, in 2017 an Oxfam report noted that just eight billionaires have as much net worth as "half the human race".<ref name="OXF-20170116"/><ref name="NYT-20170116"/> However, the Oxfam report has been criticized for considering debt as negative wealth, which leads to wealthy people with large amounts of debt to be considered poor or not wealthy.<ref name="Vox">{{cite web|title=Are 26 billionaires worth more than half the planet?

==Rise of new members==
In 2019, 19 people became billionaires. Four of the members joined as a result of death or divorce, including [[Julia Koch]] and [[Jeff Bezos]]'s ex-wife [[Mackenzie Bezos]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/denizcam/2019/10/02/2019-forbes-400-newcomers/ |title=Newcomers: These 19 Billionaires Join the Forbes 400 List in 2019 |work=[[Forbes]] |date=3 October 2019 |access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>

New members now also include more and more women. In the last five years, the number of female billionaires has grown by 46 percent, that is more than the number of male billionaires in the same period (39 percent). There are now 233 female billionaires in the world, a steep growth from 160 in 2013.<ref name=":0" />
