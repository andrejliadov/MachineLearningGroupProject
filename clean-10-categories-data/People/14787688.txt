'''Peter Carteret''' (born 1641, date of death unknown, but after 1676) was the [[List of colonial governors of North Carolina|Governor]] of the British colony of Albemarle (which would later become [[North Carolina]]) from 1670 to approximately 1672.

==Early life and career==
Carteret was born on the [[British Islands]] of Jersey. His parents were Helier de Carteret and Rachel La Cloche Carteret.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://ncpedia.org/biography/governors/carteret|title=Peter Carteret|publisher=NC Office of Archives and History, 2005|accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref>

Carteret was appointed assistant governor of the Albemarle colony by the [[Lords Proprietor]] in 1664. Proprietor [[Sir George Carteret]] was Peter Carteret's fourth cousin. Peter Cateret was the brother of [[Philip Carteret (Governor)|Philip Carteret]]. After Governor [[Samuel Stephens (North Carolina governor)|Samuel Stephens]] died in late 1669, the governor's council named Carteret acting governor.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://ncpedia.org/biography/governors/carteret|title=Peter Carteret|publisher= NC Office of Archives and History, 2005|accessdate=15 July 2012}}</ref> As Governor, Cateret was responsible for implementing the [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]].

He seems to have been appointed to the post permanently by the Lords Proprietor in 1670 and then left for England in 1672 to talk to the Proprietors about discontent in the colony. He appointed [[John Jenkins (governor)|John Jenkins]] as his deputy, to act in his place, but Carteret never returned to the colony, despite an apparent desire to do so. Instead, in November 1676, Carteret ended up giving [[power of attorney]] over his interests in the region to [[William Crawford (1638–1700)|William Crawford]], who proceeded to liquidate those interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/carteret-cartrett|title=Carteret (Cartrett, Cartwright), Peter|first=Mattie Erma E.|last=Parker|publisher=Dictionary of North Carolina Biography|website=ncpedia.org|date=1979}}</ref>
