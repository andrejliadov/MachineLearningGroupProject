In Geoffrey's pseudohistorical ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (History of the Kings of Britain), Estrildis, the daughter of a king in [[Germania]], was brought to Britain as a captive of Chief [[Humber the Hun]] during his invasion following the death of King [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]]. Eventually [[Humber's Huns]] were defeated by Brutus' three sons, the eldest of whom—Locrinus—fell in love with the beautiful [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] princess upon discovering her in one of Humber's ships.<ref name="Brewer">{{cite book |last1=Brewer |first1=E.

Locrinus was forced to honour his prior betrothal to [[Queen Gwendolen|Gwendolen]], the daughter of [[Corineus|King Corineus of Cornwall]], but kept Estrildis as his mistress.<ref name="Tolhurst">{{cite book |last1=Tolhurst |first1=F |title=Geoffrey of Monmouth and the Translation of Female Kingship |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781137329264 |pages=111, 197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=01Xg2aAnn8EC&q=Estrildis&pg=PA197 |accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref><ref name="Johns">{{cite book |last1=Johns |first1=Susan M. |title=Noblewomen, aristocracy and power in the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman realm |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9781847790538 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHLLCgAAQBAJ&q=Estrildis&pg=PA41}}</ref> For seven years he secretly visited her in a cave beneath [[Trinovantum]] (London, i.e., "New Troy"), where she was cared for by servants.<ref name="Reinhard">{{cite book |last1=Reinhard |first1=John Revell |title=Mediaeval Pageant.

When Corineus died, Locrinus deserted Gwendolen and their son [[Maddan]] and declared Estrildis his queen. Gwendolen retaliated by raising a Cornish army against Locrinus and defeating him in battle; she then had Estrildis and her daughter, Habren, drowned in a river thereafter called ''Hafren'' in [[Old Welsh|Welsh]] and [[Sabrina_(given_name)|Sabrina]] by the Romans (which is the [[River Severn]] in English).

== Name ==
Her name is probably a [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] form of the medieval name ''Estrild'' ({{lang-ang|Éastorhild}}), which survived in England only until the 12th century, according to the 1984 ''Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names''.<ref>[http://www.s-gabriel.org/names/talan/reaney/reaney.cgi?Estrild "Feminine Given Names in ''A Dictionary of English Surnames''"] ([http://www.s-gabriel.org/names/ Medieval Names Archive] at www.s-gabriel.org)</ref>
