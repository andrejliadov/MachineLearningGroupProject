{{Main|3 Ninjas (film)}}
Each summer, Samuel, Jeffrey, and Michael, three suburban California brothers, visit their grandfather Mori Tanaka's cabin in the desert to train to become ninjas. On their last day of summer vacation, the boys receive 'ninja names': Samuel is Rocky because of his strength and level headed mentality, Jeffrey is Colt because of his speed and temper like a young wild horse, and Michael is Tum Tum due to his energy coming from his gluttony. They witness a confrontation between their grandfather and Hugo Snyder, ex-student/partner of Tanaka and a criminal who is being pursued by the boys' father, FBI agent Sam Douglas. Snyder plans to kidnap the boys with the help of his assistant Mr. Brown, who employs his irresponsible nephew Fester and his friends Hammer and Marcus to abduct them. After a failed attempt at kidnapping foiled by the three boys outsmarting the three men while their parents are out, Mr. Brown along with heavyweight fighter "Rushmore" appear and they easily capture the trio, leaving a note with Rocky's girlfriend Emily, telling Sam that Snyder has kidnapped his children in retaliation for his constant attempts to arrest him. Mori arrives at the house, and Sam reluctantly agrees to give him one hour to rescue the children. Mori tracks the children to a ship at the docks where Snyder is training an army of ninjas and begins searching for the boys and Snyder. Meanwhile, the boys escape their containment cell using the training bestowed upon them by their Grandfather and begin fighting their way out of the ship, leading up to a final confrontation between Snyder and Mori. Mori wins, despite Snyder's foul play, and Sam ambushes the ship with a slew of FBI agents, wounding Snyder and foiling his evil organization.
