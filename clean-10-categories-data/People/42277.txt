The '''Aryan race''' is a [[historical race concepts|historical race concept]] which emerged in the late 19th century to describe people of [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European]] heritage as a [[Race (human classification)|racial grouping]].<ref>"The Great Aryan Myth," Knight Dunlap, ''The Scientific Monthly'' Vol. 59, No. 4 (Oct., 1944), pp. 296-300</ref>

The concept derives from the notion that the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|original speakers of the Indo-European languages]] and their descendants up to the present day constitute a distinctive [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or subrace of the [[Caucasian race]].<ref>Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief ''Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994--Merriam-Webster See original definition (definition #1) of "Aryan" in English--Page 66</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/devdutt-pattanaik-leveraging-the-aryans/17076154|title=Devdutt Pattanaik: Leveraging the Aryans|date=2016-03-27}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Main|Aryan}}
The term ''Aryan'' has generally been used to describe the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language]] root ''*arya'' which was the ethnonym the [[Indo-Iranians]] adopted to describe Aryans. Its cognate in [[Sanskrit]] is the word ''[[ƒÅrya]]'' ([[DevanƒÅgarƒ´]]: [[‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø]]), in origin an ethnic self-designation, in Classical Sanskrit meaning "honourable, respectable, noble".<ref>[[Monier-Williams]] (1899).</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary (2008 revision)|publisher=UNIVERSIT√ÑT ZU K√ñLN |url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> The [[Old Persian]] cognate ''ariya-'' ([[Old Persian cuneiform]]: êé†êéºêé°êéπ) is the ancestor of the modern name of [[Iran]] and [[ethnonym]] for the [[Iranian people]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arya-an-ethnic-epithet |title=Arya |last=Bailey |first=H.W. |website=Encyclop√¶dia Iranica |access-date=April 21, 2018}}</ref>

The term [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] is still commonly used to describe the Indic half of the [[Indo-Iranian languages]], i.e., the family that includes [[Sanskrit]] and modern languages such as [[Hindi]]-[[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]].<ref>Fortson, Benjamin W.

==History==
In the 18th century, the most ancient known [[Indo-European languages]] were those of the ancient Indo-Iranians. The word ''Aryan'' was therefore adopted to refer not only to the [[Indo-Iranian peoples]], but also to native Indo-European speakers as a whole, including the<!--DO NOT ADD OR REMOVE FROM THIS LIST WITHOUT CITATIONS--> [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Greeks]], and the [[Germanic peoples]]. It was soon recognised that [[Baltic languages|Balts]], [[Celts]], and [[Slavs]] also belonged to the same group. It was argued that all of these languages originated from a common root ‚Äì now known as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ‚Äì spoken by an ancient people who were thought of as ancestors of the [[Europe]]an, [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], and [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] peoples.

In the context of 19th-century [[physical anthropology]] and [[scientific racism]], the term "Aryan race" came to be misapplied to all people descended from the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] ‚Äì a subgroup of the [[Europid]] or "[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]" race,<ref>Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief ''Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994--Merriam-Webster Page 66</ref><ref>[[Joseph Pomeroy Widney|Widney, Joseph P]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=s9UKAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage Race Life of the Aryan Peoples]'' New York: Funk & Wagnalls. 1907 In Two Volumes: Volume One--''The Old World'' Volume Two--''The New World'' ISBN B000859S6O</ref> in addition to the Indo-Iranians (who are the only people known to have used ''Arya'' as an [[endonym]] in ancient times). This usage was considered to include most modern inhabitants of [[Australasia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], [[North America]], [[Siberia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southern Africa]], and [[West Asia]].<ref>''Rand McNally's World Atlas International Edition'' Chicago:1944 Rand McNally  Map: "Races of Mankind" pp. 278‚Äì279.</ref>  Such claims became increasingly common during the early 19th century, when it was commonly believed that the Aryans originated in the south-west [[Eurasian steppe]]s (present-day [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]).

[[Max M√ºller]] is often identified as the first writer to mention an "Aryan race" in English. In his ''Lectures on the Science of Language'' (1861),<ref name=Orsucci/> M√ºller referred to Aryans as a "race of people". At the time, the term ''race'' had the meaning of "a group of tribes or peoples, an ethnic group".<ref>[[OED]] under race, ''n.''<sup>6</sup> I.1.c has "A group of several tribes or peoples, regarded as forming a distinct ethnic set. Esp. used in 19th-cent. anthropological classification, sometimes in conjunction with linguistic groupings."</ref> He occasionally used the term "Aryan race" afterwards,<ref>[[Romila Thapar]], "The Theory of Aryan Race and India: History and Politics," ''Social Scientist'' 24.1/3 (Jan.‚ÄìMar. 1996), 6. Thapar cites an 1883 lecture in which Mueller spoke of someone as "belonging to the south-eastern branch of the Aryan race."</ref> but wrote in 1888 that "an ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a [[Dolichocephaly|dolichocephalic]] dictionary or a [[Brachycephaly|brachycephalic]] grammar".<ref>F. Max M√ºller, ''Biographies of Words and the Home of the Aryas'' (1888), Kessinger Publishing reprint, 2004, p. 120; Dorothy Matilda Figueira, ''Aryans, Jews, Brahmins: Theorizing Authority Through Myths of Identity'' (SUNY Press, 2002), p. 45.</ref>

While the "Aryan race" theory remained popular, particularly in [[Germany]], some authors opposed it, in particular [[Otto Schrader (philologist)|Otto Schrader]], [[Rudolph von Jhering]] and the ethnologist [[Robert Hartmann (naturalist)|Robert Hartmann]] (1831‚Äì1893), who proposed to ban the notion of "Aryan" from anthropology.<ref name=Orsucci/>

M√ºller's concept of Aryan was later construed to imply a biologically distinct sub-group of humanity, by writers such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]], who argued that the Aryans represented a superior branch of humanity. M√ºller objected to the mixing of linguistics and anthropology. "These two sciences, the Science of Language and the Science of Man, cannot, at least for the present, be kept too much asunder; [...] I must repeat, what I have said many times before, it would be as wrong to speak of Aryan blood as of dolichocephalic grammar".<ref>Speech before the University of Stassbourg, 1872, Chaudhuri, Nirad, ''Scholar Extraordinary: The Life of Professor the Rt. Hon. Friedrich Max Muller'', Chatto and Windus, 1974, p.313</ref> He restated his opposition to this method in 1888 in his essay ''Biographies of words and the home of the Aryas''.<ref name=Orsucci>Andrea Orsucci, "[http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html Ariani, indogermani, stirpi mediterranee: aspetti del dibattito sulle razze europee (1870-1914)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020310125529/http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html |date=2002-03-10 }}", in ''[[Cromohs]]'', 1998 {{in lang|it}}</ref>

By the late 19th century the steppe theory of Indo-European origins was challenged by a view that the Indo-Europeans originated in ancient Germany or [[Scandinavia]] ‚Äì or at least that in those countries the original Indo-European ethnicity had been preserved. The word Aryan was consequently used even more restrictively ‚Äì and even less in keeping with its Indo-Iranian origins ‚Äì to mean "Germanic", "[[Nordic race|Nordic]]" or [[Northern Europe]]ans.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vacher de Lapouge (trans Clossen, C)|first=Georges|year=1899|title=Old and New Aspects of the Aryan Question|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=5|issue=3|pages=329‚Äì346|doi=10.1086/210895|doi-access=free}}</ref> This implied division of Caucasoids into Aryans, [[Semites]] and [[Hamites]] was also based on linguistics, rather than based on physical anthropology; it paralleled an archaic tripartite division in anthropology between "Nordic", "[[Alpine race|Alpine]]" and "[[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]]" races.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The German origin of the Aryans was especially promoted by the archaeologist [[Gustaf Kossinna]], who claimed that the Proto-Indo-European peoples were identical to the [[Corded Ware culture]] of Neolithic Germany. This idea was widely circulated in both intellectual and popular culture by the early twentieth century,<ref>Arvidsson, Stefan (2006). Aryan Idols. USA: University of Chicago Press, 143. {{ISBN|0-226-02860-7}}.</ref> and is reflected in the concept of "[[Corded-Nordics]]" in [[Carleton S. Coon]]'s 1939 ''[[The Races of Europe (1939 book)|The Races of Europe]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

This usage was common among knowledgeable authors writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. An example of this usage appears in ''[[The Outline of History]]'', a bestselling 1920 work by [[H. G. Wells]].<ref>Wells, H.G. ''[[The Outline of History]]'', 3rd ed. (New York: Macmillan, 1921), Ch. 20 ("The Aryan-Speaking Peoples in Prehistoric Times"), pp. 236-51.</ref> In that influential volume, Wells used the term in the plural ("the Aryan peoples"), but he was a staunch opponent of the racist and politically motivated exploitation of the singular term ("the Aryan people") by earlier authors like [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and was careful either to avoid the generic singular, though he did refer now and again in the singular to some specific "Aryan people" (e.g., the [[Scythians]]). In 1922, in ''[[A Short History of the World (H.G. Wells)|A Short History of the World]]'', Wells depicted a highly diverse group of various "Aryan peoples" learning "methods of civilization" and then, by means of different uncoordinated movements that Wells believed were part of a larger dialectical rhythm of conflict between settled civilizations and nomadic invaders that also encompassed Aegean and Mongol peoples ''inter alia'', "subjugat[ing]" ‚Äì "in form" but not in "ideas and methods" ‚Äì "the whole ancient world, Semitic, Aegean and Egyptian alike".<ref name="bartleby">{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/86/19.html |title= H.G. Wells in 1922 on the early history of "the Aryan peoples" (Proto-Indo Europeans) |publisher=bartleby.com|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref>

In the 1944 edition of [[Rand McNally]]'s ''World Atlas'', the Aryan race is depicted as one of the ten major racial groupings of mankind.<ref>[[Rand McNally]] (1944) "Races of Mankind" (map)''Rand McNally's World Atlas International Edition'' Chicago: Rand McNally.   pp.278‚Äì79 ‚Äì In the explanatory section below the map, the Aryan race (the word "Aryan" being defined in the description below the map as a synonym for "Indo-Europeans") is described as being one of the ten major racial groupings of mankind. Each of the ten racial groupings is depicted in a different [[color]] on the map and the estimated populations in 1944 of the larger racial groups except the Dravidians are given (the Dravidian population in 1944 would have been about 70,000,000). The other nine groups are depicted as being the [[Semitic people|Semitic race]] (the Aryans (850,000,000) and the Semites (70,000,000) are described as being the two main branches of the [[Caucasian race]]), the [[Dravidian race]], the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian race]] (700,000,000), the [[Malayan race]] (Correct population given on page 413 ‚Äì 64,000,000 including besides the populations of the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Madagascar also half of the Malay States, Micronesia, and Polynesia), the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|American Indian race]] (10,000,000), the [[Black people|Negro race]] (140,000,000), the [[Australoid race|Native Australians]], the [[Australoid race|Papuans]], and the [[Capoid race|Hottentots and Bushmen]].</ref> The [[science fiction]] author [[Poul Anderson]], an [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] of [[Scandinavia]]n ancestry, in his many works, consistently used the term ''Aryan'' as a synonym for "Indo-Europeans".<ref>See, for example, the Poul Anderson short stories in the 1964 collection ''[[Time and Stars]]'' and the ''Polesotechnic League'' stories featuring [[Nicholas van Rijn]]</ref>

The use of "Aryan" as a synonym for Indo -European may occasionally appear in material that is based on historic scholarship. Thus, a 1989 article in ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[Colin Renfrew]] uses the term "Aryan" as a synonym for "Indo-European".<ref>Renfrew, Colin. (1989). The Origins of Indo-European Languages. /Scientific American/, 261(4), 82-90.</ref>
