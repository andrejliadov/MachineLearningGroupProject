The '''Calutron Girls''' were a group of young women, mostly high school graduates who joined the [[World War II]] efforts in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] in 1945.<ref name="Freeman2015"/>

Although they were not allowed to know at the time, they were monitoring dials and watching meters for a [[calutron]], a [[mass spectrometer]] that separates [[uranium isotopes]].<ref name="Fanning2014"/> The enriched uranium was used to make the first [[atomic bomb]].

Calutron Girls were trained and employed at the [[Y-12 National Security Complex]].<ref name="Nickell2010"/> Wartime labor shortages forced the Tennessee Eastman Corporation to hire women to work at the Y-12 plant.

According to Gladys Owens, one of the few Calutron Girls, a manager at the facility once told them: "We can train you how to do what is needed, but cannot tell you what you are doing. I can only tell you that if our enemies beat us to it, God have mercy on us!"
