{{Short description|National census classification of ethnicity}}

A number of different systems of '''classification of ethnicity in the United Kingdom''' exist. These schemata have been the subject of debate, including about the nature of [[ethnicity]], how or whether it can be categorised, and the relationship between [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Race (human classification)|race]], and [[nationality]].

===History and debate===
The [[United Kingdom Census 1991|1991 UK census]] was the first to include a question on ethnicity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnicity.ac.uk/medialibrary/briefings/dynamicsofdiversity/how-has-ethnic-diversity-grown-1991-2001-2011.pdf|title=How has ethnic diversity grown 1991-2001-2011?|publisher=ESRC Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity|date=December 2012|accessdate=4 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724032955/http://www.ethnicity.ac.uk/medialibrary/briefings/dynamicsofdiversity/how-has-ethnic-diversity-grown-1991-2001-2011.pdf|archive-date=2015-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> Field trials had started in 1975 to establish whether a question could be devised that was acceptable to the public and would provide information on race or ethnicity that would be more reliable than questions about an individual's parents' birthplaces. A number of different questions and answer classifications were suggested and tested, culminating in the April 1989 census test. The question used in the later 1991 census was similar to that tested in 1989,<ref>{{cite journal|first1=K.|last1=Sillitoe|first2=P. H.|last2=White|title=Ethnic Group and the British Census: The Search for a Question|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A (Statistics in Society)|volume=155|issue=1|year=1992|pages=141–163|jstor=2982673|doi=10.2307/2982673}}</ref> and took the same format on the census forms in England, Wales and Scotland. However, the question was not asked in Northern Ireland. The tick-boxes used in 1991 were "White", "Black-Caribbean", "Black-African", "Black-Other (please describe)", "Indian", "Pakistani", "Bangladeshi", "Chinese" and "Any other ethnic group (please describe)".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ethnicity/focus-on-ethnicity-and-identity/a-guide-to-comparing-1991-and-2001-census-ethnic-group-data/comparing-1991-and-2001-census-ethnic-group-data.pdf|title=A guide to comparing 1991 and 2001 Census ethnic group data|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=9 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402185816/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ethnicity/focus-on-ethnicity-and-identity/a-guide-to-comparing-1991-and-2001-census-ethnic-group-data/comparing-1991-and-2001-census-ethnic-group-data.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Sociologist [[Peter J. Aspinall]] has categorised what he regards as a number of "persistent problems with salient collective terminology". These problems are ambiguity in respect of the populations that are described by different labels, the invisibility of white minority groups in official classifications, the acceptability of the terms used to those that they describe, and whether the collectivities have any substantive meaning.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Collective Terminology to Describe the Minority Ethnic Population: The Persistence of Confusion and Ambiguity in Usage|first=Peter J|last=Aspinall|journal=Sociology|volume=36|issue=4|pages=803–816|year=2002|doi=10.1177/003803850203600401}}</ref>

A number of academics have pointed out that the ethnicity classification employed in the census and other official statistics in the UK since 1991 involve confusion between the concepts of ethnicity and [[Race (human classification)|race]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Negotiating race and ethnicity: Exploring the implications of the 1991 census|first=Roger|last=Ballard|journal=Patterns of Prejudice|volume=30|issue=3|year=1996|pages=3–33|doi=10.1080/0031322X.1996.9970192|url=http://crossasia-repository.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/288/1/negotiating.pdf|access-date=5 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411222451/http://crossasia-repository.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/288/1/negotiating.pdf|archive-date=11 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Kertzer>{{cite book|title=Census and Identity: The Politics of Race, Ethnicity, and Language in National Censuses|url=https://archive.org/details/censusidentitypo00kert|url-access=limited|chapter=Censuses, identity formation, and the struggle for political power|year=2002|first1=David I.|last1=Kertzer|first2=Dominique|last2=Arel|editor-first1=David I.|editor-last1=Kertzer|editor-first2=Dominique|editor-last2=Arel|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/censusidentitypo00kert/page/n14 1]–42}}</ref> David I. Kertzer and Dominique Arel argue that this is the case in many censuses, and that "the case of Britain is illuminative of the recurring failure to distinguish race from ethnicity".<ref name=Kertzer/> Aspinall notes that sustained academic attention has been focused on "how the censuses measure ethnicity, especially the use of dimensions that many claim have little to do with ethnicity, such as skin colour, race, and nationality".<ref name=Aspinall>{{cite journal|title=Answer Formats in British Census and Survey Ethnicity Questions: Does Open Response Better Capture 'Superdiversity'?|first=Peter J|last=Aspinall|journal=Sociology|volume=46|issue=2|year=2012|pages=354–364|doi=10.1177/0038038511419195}}</ref>

In 2007, Simpson and Bola Akinwale also studied the stability of individuals' responses to ethnic group questions between the 1991 and 2001 census. They concluded that the membership of the "White" category was stable, whereas 7–9 per cent of those in the "Asian" group and 23 per cent of both the "Caribbean" and the "African" group in 1991 had switched to another group by 2001. They suggested that conscious changes in affiliation explained little of this instability, whereas unreliability of the question was significant, partly due to the ambiguous nature of the categories used and partly due to imprecision in the imputation of missing values.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Quantifying Stability and Change in Ethnic Group|journal=Journal of Official Statistics|first1=Ludi|last1=Simpson|first2=Bola|last2=Akinwale|year=2007|volume=23|issue=2|pages=185–208}}</ref>

It has also been argued that the wording of the ethnicity question in the 2001 census, "What is your ethnic group?", embodies "an essential ''being'' ethnic" as opposed to "a constructed ''belonging to'' an ethnicity".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ethnic Classification in Global Perspective: A Cross-National Survey of the 2000 Census Round|journal=Population Research and Policy Review|first=Ann|last=Morning|year=2008|volume=27|issue=2|pages=239–272|url=http://sociology.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/1043/Morning_2008_Ethnic_Classification_in_Global_Perspective.pdf|doi=10.1007/s11113-007-9062-5|access-date=2015-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912020827/http://sociology.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/1043/Morning_2008_Ethnic_Classification_in_Global_Perspective.pdf|archive-date=2014-09-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The latter would be reflected in a question such as "choose one box to best describe your ethnic group", which was subsequently added in the 2011 census.<ref name=Aspinall/> Sociologist Steven Vertovec argues that "much public discourse and service provision is still based on a limited set of Census categories", and that "these categories do not begin to convey the extent and modes of diversity existing within the population today".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/files/Publications/Reports/Vertovec%20-%20new_complexities_of_cohesion_in_britain.pdf|title=New complexities of cohesion in Britain: Super-diversity, transnationalism and civil-integration|publisher=Commission on Integration and Cohesion|first=Steven|last=Vertovec|date=June 2007|accessdate=8 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402094128/http://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/files/Publications/Reports/Vertovec%20-%20new_complexities_of_cohesion_in_britain.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

User consultation undertaken by the [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) for the purpose of planning the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]] in England and Wales found that most of the respondents from all ethnic groups that took part in the testing felt comfortable with the use of the terms "Black" and "White". However, some participants suggested that these colour terms were confusing and unacceptable, did not adequately describe an individual's ethnic group, did not reflect his or her true skin colour, and were stereotypical and outdated terms. The heading "Black or Black British", which was used in 2001, was changed to "Black/African/Caribbean/Black British" for the 2011 census. As with earlier censuses, individuals who did not identify as "Black", "White" or "Asian" could instead write in their own ethnic group under "Other ethnic group". Persons with multiple ancestries could indicate their respective ethnic backgrounds under a "Mixed or multiple ethnic groups" tick box and write-in area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/final-recommended-questions-2011---ethnic-group.pdf|title=Final recommended questions for the 2011 Census in England and Wales: Ethnic group|publisher=Office for National Statistics|date=October 2009|accessdate=4 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075241/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/final-recommended-questions-2011---ethnic-group.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Between 2004 and 2008, the [[General Register Office for Scotland]] (GOS) conducted official consultation, research and question testing for the purpose of planning the 2011 Scottish census, with key evidence informing the new classification drawn from similar workshops carried out by the Office for National Statistics, the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] (WAG), and the [[Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency]] (NISRA). The GOS found that "Black" was a polarising term for many focus group participants and interviewees. Some participants opposed the use of such terms, while others supported them. Opposition to the term "Black" was strongest among individuals originating from ethnic groups in Africa and the Caribbean, especially the former. The main reasons cited for this opposition were that racial terms like "Black" and "White" were invalid, [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] concepts not based on empirical reality; that [[Human skin colour|skin colour]] was distinct from ethnicity; that the "Black" and "White" categories from the earlier 2001 census were inconsistent with the "Asian" categories, thereby resulting in an unfair, double standard; and that the positioning of the "White" category atop the "non-White" categories implied a [[racial hierarchy]], with "White" at the top. To redress this, the GOS established new, separate "African, African Scottish or African British" and "Caribbean, Caribbean Scottish or Caribbean British" tick boxes for individuals from Africa and the Caribbean, respectively, who did not identify as "Black, Black Scottish or Black British". It found that most testing participants thereafter chose to tick "African" or "Caribbean" instead of "Black". In the write-in area, they also noted their own respective ethnic groups, with few opting to write-in "Black". Additionally, individuals who did not identify as "Black", "White" or "Asian" could write in their own ethnic group under "Other ethnic group". Persons with multiple ancestries could indicate their respective ethnic backgrounds under a "Mixed or multiple ethnic groups" write-in area.<ref name="Snoec">{{cite web|title=Scotland's New Official Ethnicity Classification|url=http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/233640/0063967.pdf|publisher=General Register Office for Scotland|accessdate=9 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172616/http://www.gov.scot/Resource/Doc/233640/0063967.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

There were calls for the 2011 national census in England and Wales to include extra tick boxes so people could identify their ethnic group in category A as [[English people|English]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and [[Cornish people|Cornish]].<ref>[http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=144143&command=displayContent&sourceNode=144131&contentPK=16421143&moduleName=InternalSearch&formname=sidebarsearch  Fight goes on to include Cornish ethnicity and language in Census 2011 options ] {{Dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/BSPS/annualConference/2006_localgov.htm |title=2006 local govt abstracts |accessdate=2011-08-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505073357/http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/BSPS/annualConference/2006_localgov.htm |archivedate=May 5, 2009 }}</ref> The tick boxes at the time only included "British", Irish or any other. Some experts, community and special interest group respondents also pointed out that the 'Black African' category was too broad. They remarked that the category did not provide enough information on the considerable diversity that existed within the various populations currently classified under this heading. This concealed heterogeneity ultimately made the gathered data of limited use analytically. To remedy this, the [[Muslim Council of Britain]] proposed that this census category should be broken down instead into specific ethnic groups.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011-census/consultations/eth-group-nat-iden/sum-rep-exp-com-grp.pdf |title=Summary report: experts, community and special interest groups |access-date=27 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910201147/http://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011-census/consultations/eth-group-nat-iden/sum-rep-exp-com-grp.pdf |archive-date=10 September 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[National Association of British Arabs]] (NABA) and other [[Arab]] organisations also lobbied for the inclusion of a separate "Arab" entry, which would include under-reported groups from the [[Arab world]] such as [[Syria]]ns, [[Yemen]]is, [[Somali people|Somalis]] and [[Maghrebis]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.naba.org.uk/Content/HOME/HDoc/EthnicProfilStudy-0503.pdf |title=Arab Population in the UK - Study for consideration of inclusion of 'Arab' as an ethnic group on future census returns |access-date=10 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132023/http://www.naba.org.uk/Content/HOME/HDoc/EthnicProfilStudy-0503.pdf |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> NABA reasoned that "lack of recognition of Arabs as a separate ethnic group, and hence their exclusion, has serious consequences for the planning of services and monitoring of such problems as racial discrimination".<ref name=Shackle>{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/lifestyle/2012/06/there-any-such-thing-british-ethnicity|title=Is there any such thing as British ethnicity?|first=Samira|last=Shackle|work=New Statesman|date=13 June 2012|accessdate=10 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302134645/http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/lifestyle/2012/06/there-any-such-thing-british-ethnicity|archive-date=2 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The specimen 2011 Census questions were published in 2009 and included new "Gypsy or Irish Traveller" and "Arab" categories.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8318637.stm|title=2011 census questions published|date=21 October 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> The final version of the census form included tick-boxes for "Gypsy or Irish Traveller" under the "White" heading, and "Arab" under the "Other ethnic group" heading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/2011-census-questionnaire-for-england.pdf|title=2011 Census: Household Questionnaire|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=7 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402195353/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/2011-census-questionnaire-for-england.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/final-recommended-questions-2011---ethnic-group.pdf|title=Final recommended questions for the 2011 Census in England and Wales: Ethnic group|publisher=Office for National Statistics|date=October 2009|page=4|accessdate=8 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075241/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/final-recommended-questions-2011---ethnic-group.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> However, in the ONS's testing in England and Wales prior to the census, no Kurdish, Iranian, Berber, Somali or Egyptian participants chose to identify as Arab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/final-recommended-questions-2011---ethnic-group.pdf|title=Final recommended questions for the 2011 Census in England and Wales: Ethnic group|publisher=Office for National Statistics|date=October 2009|page=44|accessdate=16 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075241/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/the-2011-census/2011-census-questionnaire-content/final-recommended-questions-2011---ethnic-group.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Discussing the inclusion of nationalities such as "British" and "Irish" in the ethnic group categories of the census, Nissa Finney and Ludi Simpson argue that "on purely technical grounds, this is a mistake, confirmed by enumerators reporting that some Asian respondents had ticked 'British', having seen it as the first box and wishing to confirm their British identity and nationality".<ref>{{cite book|title='Sleepwalking to Segregation'?

===Self-definition===
The ethnicity data used in UK national statistics relies on individuals' self-definition. The [[Office for National Statistics]] explain this as follows:

{{quote|Is a person's ethnic group self-defined?
Yes. Membership of an ethnic group is something that is subjectively meaningful to the person concerned, and this is the principal basis for ethnic categorisation in the United Kingdom. So, in ethnic group questions, we are unable to base ethnic identification upon objective, quantifiable information as we would, say, for age or gender. And this means that we should rather ask people which group they see themselves as belonging to.<ref name="ONS guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/measuring-equality/equality/measuring-equality--a-guide/ethnic-group-statistics--a-guide-for-the-collection-and-classification-of-ethnicity-data.pdf|title=Ethnic group statistics: A guide for the collection and classification of ethnicity data|year=2003|publisher=Office for National Statistics|page=9|accessdate=19 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911043203/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/measuring-equality/equality/measuring-equality--a-guide/ethnic-group-statistics--a-guide-for-the-collection-and-classification-of-ethnicity-data.pdf|archive-date=11 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

The [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|police services of the UK]] began to classify arrests in racial groups in 1975, but later replaced the race code with an [[IC codes|Identity Code (IC)]] system.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://century.guardian.co.uk/1970-1979/Story/0,,106880,00.html |title=Race causes an initial confusion |work=The Guardian |last=Mackie |first=Lindsay |date=1978-06-14 |accessdate=2007-04-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703184232/http://century.guardian.co.uk/1970-1979/Story/0,,106880,00.html |archive-date=3 July 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

One of the recommendations of the [[Murder of Stephen Lawrence#The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry|Stephen Lawrence Inquiry]] was that people stopped and searched by the police should have their self-defined ethnic identity recorded. In March 2002, the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] proposed a [[Self Defined Ethnicity|new system for self-definition]], based on the 2001 census.<ref name=MPA/> From 1 April 2003, police forces were required to use this new system. Police forces and civil and emergency services, the NHS and local authorities in England and Wales may refer to this as the "6+1" system, named after the 6 classifications of ethnicity plus one category for "not stated".

The IC classification is still used for descriptions of suspects by police officers amongst themselves, but does risk incorrectly identifying a victim, a witness or a suspect compared to that person's own description of their ethnicity. When a person is stopped by a police officer exercising statutory powers and asked to provide information under the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|Police and Criminal Evidence Act]], they are asked to select one of the five main categories representing broad ethnic groups and then a more specific cultural background from within this group.<ref name = "PACE Code A">{{cite news|url=http://www.icva.org.uk/site/downloads/PACE05/PACE_Chapter_A.pdf|title=Code of Practice for the Exercise by Police Officers of Statutory Powers of Stop and Search; Police Officers and Police Staff of Requirements to Record Public Encounters|work=Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 CODE A|publisher=HMSO|access-date=27 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818075304/http://www.icva.org.uk/site/downloads/PACE05/PACE_Chapter_A.pdf|archive-date=18 August 2006|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Officers must record the respondent's answer, not their own opinion.

==Schools==
The [[Department for Education]]'s annual school census collects data on pupils in [[Preschool|nurseries]], [[Primary school|primary]], [[Middle school|middle]], [[Secondary school|secondary]] and [[special school]]s.<ref name=Schools>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271551/2014_Spring_and_Summer_School_Census_Guidefor_Secondary__Version1.1.pdf|title=School census spring and summer 2014 guide for secondary schools: Instructions for preparing for and completing the school census 2014 for secondary schools and academies (including free schools) in England|publisher=Department for Education|year=2014|accessdate=8 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123150/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271551/2014_Spring_and_Summer_School_Census_Guidefor_Secondary__Version1.1.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> This includes ethnicity data for pupils who are aged 5 or over at the beginning of the school year in August. The guidance notes on data collection note that ethnicity is a personal, subjective awareness, and that pupils and their parents can refuse to answer the ethnicity question. The codes used are based on the categories used in the 2001 UK census, with added "Travellers of Irish heritage", "Gypsy/Roma heritage" and "Sri Lankan Other" categories. If these codes are judged to not meet local needs, [[Administrative geography of the United Kingdom|local authorities]] may use a Department for Education approved list of extended categories.<ref name=Schools/> The [[National Pupil Database]] attempts to match pupils' educational attainment to their characteristics gathered in the school census, including ethnicity. However, according to [[Estyn|HM Inspectorate for Education and Training in Wales]], the database contains data inaccuracies. A few of the local authorities and schools had also never accessed the repository, and some of these institutions were unaware of its existence. The NPD was also used least by the majority of local authorities and schools, with 65 percent deeming this method of educational data analysis to be of limited use, about 23 percent considering it to be fairly useful, and only around 11 percent regarding it as being very useful. Most schools and local authorities instead used the Welsh Assembly Government's national free school meal (FSM) benchmark data, which ranks a school's performance relative to other groups of schools with comparable free school meal levels. Around 55 percent of schools and local authorities deemed the benchmark data very useful, 35 percent considered it fairly useful, and only about 10 percent regarded it as being of limited use.<ref name="Hifeatiw">{{cite web|title=The use of performance data in local authorities and schools|url=http://www.estyn.gov.uk/download/publication/176494.5/the-use-of-performance-data-in-local-authorities-and-schools-february-2008/|publisher=HM Inspectorate for Education and Training in Wales|accessdate=10 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121616/http://www.estyn.gov.uk/download/publication/176494.5/the-use-of-performance-data-in-local-authorities-and-schools-february-2008/|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, researchers conducting analysis for the [[London Borough of Lambeth]] have argued that broad ethnic groupings such as "black African" or "white other" can hide significant variation in educational performance, so they instead recommend the use of language categories.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6360715|title=Diversity - Ethnic groupings obscure realities|work=TES|first=Adi|last=Bloom|date=27 September 2013|accessdate=8 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402163924/https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=6360715|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Language diversity and attainment in schools: implication for policy and practice|journal=Race Ethnicity and Education|first=Feyisa|last=Demie|year=2014|doi=10.1080/13613324.2014.946493|volume=18|issue=5|pages=723–737}}</ref>

==Healthcare==
The ethnic group categories used in the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service in England]] are based on the 2001 census. It has been argued that this causes problems, as other agencies such as [[social services]] use the newer 2011 census categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.england.nhs.uk/iscg/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/06/20140625_SCCI_Item_7_SCCI5566_SoN_2011_Ethnic_Category_Coding_DSCN112008.pdf|title=Ethnic Category Coding – DSCN11/2008 - Statement of Need for Standard Review|publisher=Standardisation Committee for Care Information|date=11 June 2014|accessdate=9 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092422/http://www.england.nhs.uk/iscg/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/06/20140625_SCCI_Item_7_SCCI5566_SoN_2011_Ethnic_Category_Coding_DSCN112008.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In [[NHS Scotland|Scotland]], the 2011 Scottish census categories are now used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndc.scot.nhs.uk/Data-Dictionary/SMR-Datasets//Patient-Identification-and-Demographic-Information/Ethnic-Group/|title=Ethnic Group|publisher=Information Services Division, NHS National Services Scotland|accessdate=9 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402181734/http://www.ndc.scot.nhs.uk/Data-Dictionary/SMR-Datasets//Patient-Identification-and-Demographic-Information/Ethnic-Group/|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2011, Scotland started to record ethnicity on [[death certificate]]s, becoming the first country in the world to do so. Ethnicity data is not routinely recorded on [[birth certificate]]s in any part of the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/3040/1/Mathur-_Availability_and_use_of_UK_based_ethnicity_data_for_health_res_1.pdf|title=Availability and use of UK based ethnicity data for health research|first1=Rohini|last1=Mathur|first2=Emily|last2=Grundy|first3=Liam|last3=Smeeth|publisher=National Centre for Research Methods|date=March 2013|page=17|accessdate=9 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402152325/http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/3040/1/Mathur-_Availability_and_use_of_UK_based_ethnicity_data_for_health_res_1.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Whether the official UK ethnic group classifications are useful for research on health is the subject of debate. Peter Aspinall argues that the 2001 census categories fail to adequately break down the "white" group and ignore ethno-religious differences between South Asian groups, amongst other issues.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The New 2001 Census Question Set on Cultural Characteristics: Is it useful for the monitoring of the health status of people from ethnic groups in Britain?|first=Peter J.|last=Aspinall|journal=Ethnicity & Health|year=2000|volume=5|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1080/13557850050007329}}</ref> Writing in the ''[[Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health]]'', Charles Agyemang, Raj Bhopal and Marc Bruijnzeels argue that: "The current groupings of African descent populations in the USA and the UK such as Black, Black African, and African American hide the huge heterogeneity within these groups, which weakens the value of ethnic categorisation as a means of providing culturally appropriate health care, and in understanding the causes of ethnic differences in disease. Such broad terms may not fit with self definition of ethnicity".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Negro, Black, Black African, African Caribbean, African American or what?

==Collective terms for minority ethnic groups==
A number of terms have been used, by government and more generally, to refer to the collective ethnic minority population. These include "black and minority ethnic" (BME), "black, Asian and minority ethnic" (BAME) and "black and ethnic minority" (BEM). These terms have been criticised on a number of grounds, including for excluding [[national minorities]] such as the Cornish, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish from the definition of ethnic minorities, for suggesting that black people (and Asian people, specifically the [[South Asia|South Asians]] with BAME) are racially separate from the ethnic minority population, and for including under a single label heterogenous groups with little in common with each other.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Collective Terminology to Describe the Minority Ethnic Population: The Persistence of Confusion and Ambiguity in Usage|first=Peter J.|last=Aspinall|journal=Sociology|volume=36|issue=4|pages=803–816|year=2002|doi=10.1177/003803850203600401}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/22/black-asian-minority-ethnic-bame-bme-trevor-phillips-racial-minorities|title=Is it time to ditch the term 'black, Asian and minority ethnic' (BAME)?|first1=Lola|last1=Okolosie|first2=Joseph|last2=Harker|first3=Leah|last3=Green|first4=Emma|last4=Dabiri|work=The Guardian|date=22 May 2015|accessdate=20 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621020001/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/22/black-asian-minority-ethnic-bame-bme-trevor-phillips-racial-minorities|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43831279|title=Should BAME be ditched as a term for black, Asian and minority ethnic people?|first=Rajdeep|last=Sandhu|publisher=BBC News|date=17 May 2018|accessdate=21 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622165511/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43831279|archive-date=22 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> A survey published in November 2020 found that the term "BAME" offended those whom it attempts to describe, with "ethnically diverse communities" preferred when speaking broadly, and relevant terms for a specific community or person.<ref>{{Cite news |title='BAME' term offends those it attempts to describe, sporting survey finds |last=MacInnes |first=Paul |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 November 2020 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/12/bame-term-offends-those-it-attempts-to-describe-sporting-survey-finds-sporting-equals}}</ref>
