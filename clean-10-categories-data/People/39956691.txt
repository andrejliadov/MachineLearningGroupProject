In the context of the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present)|Kurdish–Turkish conflict]] an '''itirafçı''' ({{IPA-tr|itiɾafˈtʃɯ}}, 'defector' or 'confessor') is a former member of the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) who worked as an informant or collaborator for the [[Turkey|Turkish]] security forces against the PKK. Some merely provided intelligence, while others were persuaded or coerced into taking active roles in the conflict. İtirafçıs played a significant role in the conflict in southeastern Turkey in the 1990s, as they were often used to do the extralegal work of security forces, particularly in the case of the unofficial [[Turkish Gendarmerie]] unit [[JİTEM]].<ref>''[[Hurriyet Daily News]]'', 17 January 1997, [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/pkk-confessors-turn-into-state-hitmen.aspx?pageID=438&n=pkk-confessors-turn-into-state-hitmen-1997-01-17 PKK confessors turn into state hitmen]</ref><ref>[[Human Rights Watch]] (1999), [https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/turkey/turkey993-05.htm VI.
