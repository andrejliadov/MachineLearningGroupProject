==== Content ====

''Queer Kid Stuff'' is aimed at young children of ages three and up.<ref name="pk">{{cite web |title=QKS Press Kit |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/555f270be4b003d47ad473c9/t/5c880d0c6e9a7f0f9ac9a065/1552420110520/QKS+Press+Kit.pdf |publisher=Queer Kids Stuff}}</ref> The show discusses [[sexuality]], [[gender identity]], and other LGBT issues that Amer calls "the ABCs of LGBT", as well as pop-culture topics.<ref name="Shonda"/> The show's presentation is adapted for a child audience; for instance, a video on [[consent]] uses the sharing of toys as an example in place of [[sexual activity]].<ref name="r29">{{cite web |last1=Brabaw |first1=Kasandra |title=The Concept Of Consent Is So Simple That Even Toddlers Can Understand |url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/05/154984/consent-queer-kid-stuff-video |publisher=Refinery29 |accessdate=9 January 2020}}</ref>

''Queer Kid Stuff'' is co-hosted by Teddy, a talking teddy bear who, according to Amer, provides the "voice of [a] child" and adds [[non-binary gender|non-binary]] representation by virtue of it being a "genderless entity".<ref name="Shonda"/> "Relatable" child entertainment and education methods, such as "toys, blocks, and [[stop-motion animation]]", are used to explain LGBT concepts.<ref name="kidscreen"/> ''Queer Kid Stuff'' videos are approximately four minutes long.<ref name="kidscreen"/>

''Queer Kid Stuff'' has covered LGBT topics such as [[homophobia]], [[gay marriage]], [[gender identity]], [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], and the history of the [[Stonewall riots]],<ref name="kidscreen"/><ref name="Shonda"/> as well as sexual education issues like [[consent]].<ref name="r29"/>

==== Reception ====

''Queer Kid Stuff'' videos have received differing reviews from commentators. 

In June 2018, writer Priscilla Blossom, in an article on online magazine ''Romper'', called ''Queer Kid Stuff'' "the LGBTQ-positive show we were missing as kids" and evaluated Amer's message of "just [being] happy with the way you are" as one "we can all get behind."<ref name="romper">{{cite web |last1=Blossom |first1=Priscilla |title='Queer Kid Stuff' Is The LGBTQ-Positive Show We Were Missing As Kids |url=https://www.romper.com/p/queer-kid-stuff-is-the-lgbtq-positive-show-we-were-missing-as-kids-9263172 |website=Romper |publisher=Bustle Media Group |accessdate=10 January 2020}}</ref>

In November 2018, the showing of ''Queer Kid Stuff'' videos, among other presentations on [[transgender]] issues, at Nederland Elementary School in [[Boulder County, Colorado]] caused controversy. One parent wrote to a local news station that the set of presentations went "beyond a simple message of tolerance and acceptance," calling its topic "highly controversial and divisive" and adding that the presentation was "simply not age appropriate."<ref name="cbs">{{cite web |last1=Thomas |first1=Dillon |title=Concerns Raised Over Planned Transgender Awareness Performance At School |url=https://denver.cbslocal.com/2018/11/18/superior-elementary-videos-performance/ |website=CBS Denver |publisher=CBS Broadcasting |accessdate=9 January 2020}}</ref>

In an interview in July 2018, Amer responded to a question on the issue of age inappropriateness and indoctrination, stating that "any education for kids this young is technically indoctrination" and that the show's message of "diversity and inclusion" is "a message that every kid needs to see."<ref name="yr">{{cite web |last1=Boulfli |first1=Tharwa |title=ARE PRESCHOOLERS TOO YOUNG FOR LGBTQ+ ISSUES?
