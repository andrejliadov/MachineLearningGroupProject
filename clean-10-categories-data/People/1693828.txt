The '''Abraham-men''' (also '''Abram-men''' or '''Abraham coves''') were a class of beggars claiming to be [[lunatic]]s allowed out of restraint, in the [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart periods]] in [[England]].

The phrase normally refers to the practice of beggars pretending that they were patients discharged from the Abraham ward at [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]. The phrase can be traced back as far as 1561,<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abraham-men|volume=1|page=72}}</ref> when it was given as one of ''The Fraternity of Vagabonds'', by [[John Awdeley (printer)|John Awdeley]]. It also appears in the taxonomy of [[rogue (vagrant)|rogue]]s given by [[Thomas Harman]], which was copied by later writers of [[rogue literature]]. The author of ''O Per Se O'' (1612) reported that Abram-men made marks on their arms with 'burnt paper, piss and gunpowder' to show they had been in Bedlam Hospital: "some dance, but keep no measure; others leap up and down".<ref>Quoted in A. L. Beier, ''Masterless Men: The Vagrancy Problem in England 1560–1640'' 1985, p. 115; {{ISBN|978-0-416-39020-9}}</ref> The phrase ''Abraham-men'' also appears as a disguise for Edgar in ''[[King Lear]]'' (1604–05) and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''[[Beggar's Bush]]''. They were called ''anticks'' or ''God's minstrels'', and later ''Poor Toms'', from the popular song ''"[[Tom of Bedlam]]"''. [[John Aubrey]], the [[antiquary]], said they were common before the [[English Civil War]], and wore a badge of tin on their left arms, an ox horn around their necks, a long staff and fantastical clothing. However, the badge seems to have been in myth. It may have been convenient [[theatrical property]]. Richard Head wrote in ''The Canting Academy, or Devils Cabinet opened'' (1673) that they
: ''used to array themselves with party-coloured ribbons, tape in their hats, a fox-tail hanging down, a long stick with streamers, and beg alms; but for all their seeming madness, they had wit enough to steal as they went along.''

In 1675 the governors of Bedlam issued a public notice in the [[London Gazette]]:<ref>[[Charles James Ribton-Turner|Ribton-Turner, C. J.]], ''Vagrants and Vagrancy and Beggars and Begging'', London, 1887, p.172</ref>

: ''"Whereas several vagrant persons do wander about … pretending themselves to be lunatics under cure in the Hospital of Bethlem commonly called Bedlam, with brass plates about their arms and inscriptions thereon: These are to give notice that there is no such liberty given to any patients kept in the said Hospital for their cure, neither is any such plate as a distinction or mark put upon any lunatic during their being there, or when discharged thence. And that the same is a false pretence, to colour their wandering and begging, and to deceive the people."''

[[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]] specialised in the care of mental illness from 1403, and remained the only such hospital in England until the seventeenth century. There cannot have been many genuine ex-inmates. In 1598 there were only 20 patients there, one who had been there over 25 years and others for several years.

In 1737 the ''Dictionary of Thieving Slang'' still described ''Abram-men'' as "shabby Beggars, patched and trick'd up with Ribbons, Red-Tape, Fox-tails, Rags of various Colours; pretending to be besides themselves, to palliate their Thefts of Poultry, Linnen, &c. A sort of itinerant Hedge-Robbers, and Strippers of Children, &c."
