An '''apsara''', also spelled as '''apsaras''' (respective plurals '''apsaras''' and '''apsarases'''), is a type of female spirit of the clouds and waters in [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] and [[Culture of Buddhism|Buddhist culture]]. They figure prominently in the sculpture, dance, literature and painting of many [[South Asia]]n and [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/apsara|title=Apsara {{!}} Indian religion and mythology|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> There are two types of apsaras: ''laukika'' (worldly) and ''daivika'' (divine). [[Urvasi]], [[Menaka]], [[Rambha (apsara)|Rambha]], [[Tilottama]] and [[Ghritachi]] are the most famous among them.<ref>{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/68 68]|editor=K.S.

Apsaras are widely known as ''Apsara'' (អប្សរា) in [[Khmer language|Khmer]], and also called as ''Accharā'' in [[Pāli]], or ''Bidadari'' ([[Malay language|Malay]], [[Maranao language|Maranao]]), ''Biraddali''  ([[Tausūg language|Tausug]], [[Sinama language|Sinama]]), ''Hapsari/Apsari'' or ''Widadari/Widyadari'' ([[Javanese language|Javanese]]), ''Helloi'' ([[Meitei language|Meitei]]) and ''Apsorn'' ({{lang-th |อัปสร}}). English translations of the word "Apsara" include "[[nymph]]", "[[fairy]]", "celestial nymph", and "celestial maiden".

In [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]], apsaras are beautiful, supernatural female beings. They are youthful and elegant, and superb in the art of dancing. They are often wives of the [[Gandharva]]s, the court musicians of [[Indra]]. They dance to the music made by the Gandharvas, usually in the palaces of the gods, entertain and sometimes seduce gods and men. As ethereal beings who inhabit the skies, and are often depicted taking [[flight]], or at service of a god, they may be compared to [[angel]]s.

Apsaras are said to be able to change their shape at will and rule over the [[luck|fortunes]] of gaming and gambling.<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Apsaras|volume=2|page=231}}</ref> Apsaras are sometimes compared to the [[Muses]] of ancient Greece, with each of the 26 Apsaras at Indra's court representing a distinct aspect of the performing arts. They are associated with [[fertility rite]]s. The [[Bhagavata Purana]] also states that the apsaras were born from [[Kashyapa]] and [[Muni (Hinduism)|Muni]].

==Etymology==
The origin of 'apsara' is the [[Sanskrit]] अप्सरस्, ''apsaras'' (in the stem form, which is the dictionary form). NB The stem form ends in 's' as distinct from, e.g. the nominative singular ''Ramas/Ramaḥ (''the deity Ram in Hindi), whose stem form is ''Rama''. The nominative singular form is अप्सरास् ''apsarās'', or अप्सरा: ''apsarāḥ'' when standing alone, which becomes अप्सरा ''apsarā'' in Hindi, from which in turn the English 'apsara' presumably is derived. Monier-Williams Dictionary gives the etymology as अप् + √सृ, "going in the waters or between the waters of the clouds".

===Rigveda===
The [[Rigveda]] tells of an apsara who is the wife of [[Gandharva]]; however, the Rigveda also seems to allow for the existence of more than one apsara.<ref name=" EB1911"/>
The only apsara specifically named is [[Urvashi]].  An entire hymn deals with the [[Colloquy (religious)|colloquy]] between Urvashi and her mortal lover [[Pururavas]].<ref>''Rig Veda'', Book X, Hymn 95.</ref> Later Hindu scriptures allow for the existence of numerous apsaras, who act as the handmaidens of [[Indra]] or as dancers at his celestial court.<ref name="EB1911"/>
[[Image:Golden Celestial Nymph of Majapahit.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Golden apsara in [[Majapahit]] style, [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]

===Mahabharata===
In many of the stories related in the [[Mahabharata]], apsaras appear in important supporting roles.  The epic contains several lists of the principal Apsaras, which lists are not always identical.  Here is one such list, together with a description of how the celestial dancers appeared to the residents and guests at the court of the gods:

<blockquote>Ghritachi and Menaka and Rambha and Purvachitti and Swayamprabha and Urvashi and Misrakeshi and Dandagauri and Varuthini and Gopali and Sahajanya and Kumbhayoni and Prajagara and Chitrasena and Chitralekha and Saha and Madhuraswana, these and others by thousands, possessed of eyes like lotus leaves, who were employed in enticing the hearts of persons practising rigid austerities, danced there. And possessing slim waists and fair large hips, they began to perform various evolutions, shaking their deep bosoms, and casting their glances around, and exhibiting other attractive attitudes capable of stealing the hearts and resolutions and minds of the spectators.<ref>''Mahabharata'', Book III: ''Vana Parva'', Section 43.</ref></blockquote>

====Exploits of individual Apsaras====
[[File: Celestial fairies Apsaras on Hindu Temple at Banares 1913.jpg|thumb|Apsaras on Hindu Temple at [[Varanasi|Banares]], 1913]]
The Mahabharata documents the exploits of individual apsaras, such as [[Tilottama]], who rescued the world from the rampaging [[asura]] brothers [[Sunda (asura)|Sunda]] and [[Upasunda]], and [[Urvashi]], who attempted to seduce the hero [[Arjuna]].

====The Nymph and the Sage====
A story type or theme appearing over and over again in the Mahabharata is that of an apsara sent to distract a sage or spiritual master from his ascetic practices.  One story embodying this theme is that recounted by the epic heroine [[Shakuntala]] to explain her own parentage.<ref>''Mahabharata'', Book I: ''Adi Parva'', Section 71-72.</ref> Once upon a time, the sage [[Vishvamitra|Viswamitra]] generated such intense energy by means of his asceticism that [[Indra]] himself became fearful.  Deciding that the sage would have to be distracted from his penances, he sent the apsara [[Menaka]] to work her charms. [[Menaka]] trembled at the thought of angering such a powerful ascetic, but she obeyed the god's order.  As she approached [[Vishvamitra|Viswamitra]], the wind god [[Vayu]] tore away her garments.  Seeing her thus disrobed, the sage abandoned himself to lust.  Nymph and sage engaged in sex for some time, during which Viswamitra's asceticism was put on hold.  As a consequence, Menaka gave birth to a daughter, whom she abandoned on the banks of a river.  That daughter was Shakuntala herself, the narrator of the story.

===Natya Shastra===
[[Natya Shastra]], the principal work of dramatic theory for Sanskrit drama, lists the following apsaras: Manjukesi, Sukesi, Misrakesi, Sulochana, Saudamini, Devadatta, Devasena, Manorama, Sudati, Sundari, Vigagdha, Vividha, Budha, Sumala, Santati, Sunanda, Sumukhi, Magadhi, Arjuni, Sarala, Kerala, [[Dhrti]], Nanda, Supuskala, Supuspamala and Kalabha.

===Khmer Culture===
[[File:Danseuses kmer (2).JPG|thumb|right|[[Khmer classical dance|Khmer]] Apsara dancers]]
Apsaras represent an important motif in the stone [[bas-reliefs]] of the [[Angkor]]ian temples in [[Cambodia]] (8th–13th centuries AD), however, all-female images are not considered to be apsaras. In harmony with the Indian association of dance with apsaras, Khmer female figures that are dancing or are poised to dance are considered ''apsaras''; female figures, depicted individually or in groups, who are standing still and facing forward in the manner of temple guardians or custodians are called ''[[devata]]s''.<ref>Maurice Glaize, ''Monuments of the Angkor Group'', p.37.</ref>

The bas-reliefs of Angkorian temples have become an inspiration of [[Khmer classical dance]]. The indigenous ballet-like performance art of Cambodia is frequently called "[[Robam Tep Apsara|Apsara Dance]]". The dance was created by the Royal Ballet of [[Cambodia]] in the mid-20th century under the patronage of Queen [[Sisowath Kossamak]] of Cambodia. The role of the apsara is played by a woman, wearing a tight-fitting traditional dress with gilded jewelry and headdress modelled after Angkor bas-reliefs,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roughguides.com/?titleid=107&xid=idbox_head33982200_0171|title=Home|website=Rough Guides|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> whose graceful, sinuous gestures are codified to narrate classical myths or religious stories.<ref name=dig>Di Giovine, Michael A. ''The Heritage-Scape''. 2008, pages 293–4</ref>

===Malay Archipelago culture===
[[Image:Apsara Borobudur.jpg|thumb|right|The Apsara of [[Borobudur]], the flying celestial maiden depicted in a bas-relief of the 9th-century Borobudur temple, [[Java]], [[Indonesia]].]]
In the Malay language throughout medieval times, apsaras are also known as 'bidadari', being conflated with the 'vidyadharis' (from [[Sanskrit]] word ''vidhyadhari'': ''vidhya'', 'knowledge'; ''dharya'', 'having, bearer, or bringer') known as ''Bidadari'' in the modern [[Malay language]] (surviving in both [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]<ref name="Bidadari"/> and [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]]<ref>{{cite web |title="bidadari" - Maklumat Kata |url=http://prpm.dbp.gov.my/Cari1?keyword=bidadari |website=Pusat Rujukan Persuratan Melayu |publisher=[[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]] [[Malaysia]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref> standards), the females of the vidyādharas, another class of celestial beings in Indian mythology. 'Vidyādhara' literally means 'possessed of science or spells', and refers to 'a kind of supernatural being ... possessed of magical power' or 'fairy' according to Monier-Williams Dictionary.  The bidadaris are heavenly maidens,<ref name="Bidadari">{{cite web | title = Bidadari | website = KBBI | url = http://kbbi.web.id/bidadari}}</ref> living in the [[svarga]]loka or in celestial palace of [[Indra]], described in [[Bali]]nese dedari (bidadari or apsara) dance.

Traditionally apsaras are described as celestial maidens living in [[Indra]]'s heaven (Kaéndran). They are well known for their special task: being sent to earth by Indra to seduce [[ascetics]] who by their severe practices may become more powerful than the gods. This theme occurs frequently in Javanese traditions, including the ''[[Kakawin Arjunawiwaha]]'', written by mpu Kanwa in 1030 during the reign of a king [[Airlangga]]. The story tells that [[Arjuna]], in order to defeat the giant Niwatakawaca, engaged in meditation and asceticism, whereupon Indra sent apsaras to seduce him.  Arjuna, however, managed to conquer his lust and then to win the ultimate weapons from the gods to defeat the giant.
[[File:Condong dancer DYK crop.JPG|thumb|left|The Balinese [[Legong]] dance depict celestial maidens, [[Bali]], [[Indonesia]].]]
Later in the [[Java]]nese tradition the apsara was also called ''Hapsari'', also known as ''Widodari'' (from [[Sanskrit]] word vidyādhari). The Javanese Hindu-Buddhist tradition also influenced [[Bali]]. In Balinese dance, the theme of celestial maidens often occurred. Dances such as ''Sanghyang Dedari'' and ''[[Legong]]'' depicted divine maidens in their own way. In the court of [[Mataram Sultanate]] the tradition of depicting heavenly maidens in dances still alive and well. The Javanese court dances of [[Bedhaya]] portray apsaras.

However, after the adoption of [[Islam]], bidadari is equated with [[houri]], the heavenly maiden mentioned in the [[Quran]], in which God stated that the 'forbidden pearls' of heaven are for those men who have resisted temptation and borne life's trials. Islam spread in the Malay archipelago when Arabic traders came to trade spices with the Malays; at that time, Hinduism formed the basis of the Malay culture, but [[syncretism]] with the Islamic religion and culture spawned the idea of a Bidadari. It is usually seen as a prized offer to those who lived a lifestyle in service to and pleasing to God; after death, the Bidadari was the man's wife or wives, depending on what type of person he was. The worthiness of a man who was offered Bidadari depended upon his holiness: how often he prayed, how much he turned away from the 'outside world', and how little he heeded worldly desires.

==Visual arts==
===Java and Bali, Indonesia===
[[File: Devata and Apsaras Prambanan 09.jpg|thumb|right|A male devata flanked by two apsaras, Vishnu temple, [[Prambanan]], Java.]]
Images of apsaras are found in several temples of ancient [[Java]] dating from the era of the [[Sailendra]] dynasty to that of the [[Majapahit]] empire. The apsara celestial maidens might be found as decorative motifs or also as integral parts of a story in bas-relief. Images of apsaras can be found on [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Prambanan]], [[Candi Plaosan|Plaosan]], and [[Penataran Temple|Penataran]].

At Borobudur apsaras are depicted as divinely beautiful celestial maidens, pictured either in standing or in flying positions, usually holding lotus blossoms, spreading flower petals, or waving celestial clothes as if they were wings enabling them to fly. The temple of [[Mendut]] near Borobudur depicted groups of [[devatas]], divine beings flying in heaven, which included apsaras. In the Prambanan temple compound, especially in Vishnu temple, along with the gallery, some images of male devata are found flanked by two apsaras.

===Manipur, India===
In the ancient Manipur culture of the Meitei people of northeastern India, apsaras are considered as celestial nymphs or ''hellois'' as the flying creatures resembling the human female body attracting the male wanderers or any knights who lost their ways in the woods. They were known for their beauty, glamour, magical powers and enchanting supernatural Androphilic Magnetism. They are believed to be seven in number and are the daughters of the sky god or the ''Soraren'' deity.

===Cambodia===
[[Angkor Wat]], the largest Angkor temple (built-in 1113-1150 AD), features both ''Apsaras'' and ''Devata'', however, the devata type are the most numerous with more than 1,796 in the present research inventory.<ref>[http://www.devata.org/2010/02/angkor-wat-devata-inventory/ Angkor Wat devata inventory - February 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423123631/http://www.devata.org/2010/02/angkor-wat-devata-inventory/ |date=23 April 2010 }}</ref> Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (30–40&nbsp;cm as seen below) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately 95–110&nbsp; cm) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewelry and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period. Some devatas appear with arms around each other and seem to be greeting the viewer. "The devatas seem to epitomize all the elements of a refined elegance," wrote Marchal.<ref>Sappho Marchal, ''Khmer Costumes and Ornaments of the Devatas of Angkor Wat''.</ref>

===Champa===
Apsaras were also an important motif in the [[art of Champa]], medieval [[Angkor]]'s neighbour to the east along the coast of what is now central Vietnam.  Especially noteworthy are the depictions of apsaras in the [[Art of Champa#Tra Kieu Style|Tra Kieu Style]] of Cham art, a style which flourished in the 10th and 11th centuries AD.

===China===
Apsaras are often depicted as flying figures in the mural paintings and sculptures of Buddhist cave sites in China such as in the [[Mogao Caves]], [[Yulin Caves]], and the [[Yungang Grottoes|Yungang]] and [[Longmen Grottoes]].  They may also be depicted as dancers or musicians.  They are referred to as feitian (飞天) in Chinese.
