==Biography==
[[File:Robert Baker Aitken and Anne Hopkins Aitken.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Robert Baker Aitken and [[Anne Hopkins Aitken]]]]
Robert Aitken was born to [[Robert Thomas Aitken]] and Gladys Page Baker in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in 1917. He was raised in [[Hawaii]] from the age of five.

Living in [[Guam]] as a [[civilian]] working in [[construction]]—at the onset of [[World War II]]—he was detained by the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and held in [[internment camps]] for the duration of the war.<ref name="swans">{{cite book|last=Fields|first=Rick|title=How the Swans Came to the Lake: A Narrative History of Buddhism in America|year=1992|pages=201–202|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|isbn=0-87773-631-6}}</ref> In one such internment camp in [[Kobe, Japan]] in 1944 he met the [[scholar]] [[Reginald Horace Blyth]],<ref name="swans"/> with whom he had frequent discussions on [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[anarchism]]. At the conclusion of the war he returned to Hawaii and obtained a [[B.A.]] in [[English literature]] and an [[Masters degree|MA]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] from the [[University of Hawaii]].<ref name="aitken">{{cite book| last =Aitken, Robert| first =Merwin, W.S.| title =A Zen Wave: Basho's Haiku and Zen| publisher =[[Shoemaker & Hoard Publishers]]| year =2003| isbn =1-59376-008-6| page =[https://archive.org/details/zenwavebashoshai0000aitk_x0m7/page/ xi, xii]| url =https://archive.org/details/zenwavebashoshai0000aitk_x0m7/page/}}</ref><ref name="queen">{{cite book| last =Queen| first =Christopher S| title =Engaged Buddhism in the West| publisher =Wisdom publications| year =2000| pages =70–73| isbn = 0-86171-159-9}}</ref>

In the late 1940s, while going to classes briefly at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California]], he met [[Nyogen Senzaki]].<ref name="prebish">{{cite book| last =Prebish| first =Charles S| title =Luminous passage: the practice and study of Buddhism in America| publisher =[[University of California Press]]| year =1999| pages =19, 20, 21| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=XsHv_5VCzmMC&q=Aitken| isbn = 0-520-21697-0}}</ref>  Originally in California hoping for an encounter with [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti]], he began to study with Senzaki in [[Los Angeles]]. It was during this period that his commitment to leftist social issues - such as [[pacifism]] and [[labor rights]] – became more vocal. As a result of his advocacy, he was investigated during this period by the [[FBI]].

In 1950 he went back to [[Japan]], under a [[grant (money)|grant]] to study [[haiku]] and followed Senzaki's recommendation that he study Zen there.<ref name="swans"/> There he took part in his first [[sesshin]] at [[Engaku-ji]], a temple in [[Kamakura, Japan]].<ref name="swans"/> Soon after, he met [[Nakagawa Soen]], who persuaded him to come for a stay at [[Ryutakuji]] for the next seven months. During this period Soen took over for the ailing abbot of the temple, [[Yamamoto Gempo]].<ref name="swans"/> Aitken then came down with a case of dysentery, and returned home to Hawaii. He married his second wife Anne Hopkins in 1957 and made occasional trips back to Japan. In  1957 Aitken met [[Hakuun Yasutani]] and sat with him for the first time.<ref name="prebish"/><ref>{{cite book| last =Yasutani| first =Hakuun| author-link =Hakuun Yasutani| title =Flowers Fall: A Commentary on Zen Master Dogen's Genjokoan| publisher =Shambala| year =1996| pages = XXVI | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=oGLYAAAAMAAJ&q=Aitken| isbn = 1-57062-103-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last =Wenger| first =Michael| author-link =Michael Wenger| title =Wind Bell: Teachings from the San Francisco Zen Center (1968-2001)| publisher =[[North Atlantic Books]]| year =2001| url =https://archive.org/details/windbell00mich/page/| isbn =1-55643-381-6| page =[https://archive.org/details/windbell00mich/page/ viii]}}</ref><ref name="aitken"/><ref name="queen"/>

In 1959 he and Anne began a meditation group in Honolulu at their residence, which became known as the Koko-an [[zendo]]. The community that gathered at this zendo were then named the Diamond Sangha by the two. The Diamond Sangha has affiliate zen centers in [[South America]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] and is known for making the rigors of traditional Zen accessible to lay practitioners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondsangha.org/|title=Honolulu Diamond Sangha }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondsangha.org/Links.htm |title=Affiliates of the Diamond Sangha |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110123641/http://www.diamondsangha.org/Links.htm |archive-date=2010-01-10 }}</ref>

In 1960 Soen Nakagawa Roshi asked young monk [[Eido Tai Shimano]] to travel to Honolulu to assist at the Diamond Sangha center.<ref name="Ford">{{cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| author-link =James Ishmael Ford| title =Zen Master Who?: A Guide to the People and Stories of Zen| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2006| pages =114| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=-kut6gcyTNEC&pg=PA114| isbn = 0-86171-509-8}}</ref>

In 1961, Aitken made an extended stay in Japan to study under [[Haku'un Yasutani]], eventually ending his studies with Soen. He then worked in various capacities at the [[East-West Center]] and the [[University of Hawaii]] until 1969, when he and Anne moved to [[Maui, Hawaii]] to found the Maui Zendo in [[Haiku-Pauwela, Hawaii|Haiku-Pauwela]]. Koun Yamada Rōshi was invited to lead the Diamond Sangha and he moved to Hawaii in 1971. In 1974 Aitken was given permission to teach by [[Koun Yamada]], receiving full [[Dharma transmission]] from him in 1985.<ref name="prebish"/><ref name="chappell">{{cite book| last =Chappell| first =David W| title =Buddhist Peacework: Creating Cultures of Peace| publisher =[[Wisdom Publications]]| year =2000| isbn = 0-86171-167-X| page =93}}</ref>

Robert Aitken was a social activist through much of his adult life, beginning with protesting against [[nuclear testing]] during the 1940s. He was an outspoken critic of the [[Vietnam War]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Fields|first=Rick|title=How the Swans Came to the Lake: A Narrative History of Buddhism in America|year=1992|pages=256|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|isbn=0-87773-631-6}}</ref> and became a strong opponent of the [[nuclear arms race]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. He was among the earlier proponents of [[deep ecology]] in religious [[United States|America]], and was outspoken in his beliefs on the equality of men and women. In 1978 Aitken helped found the [[Buddhist Peace Fellowship]], an organization that advocates [[conflict resolution]] globally.<ref name="queen"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Burke|first=Daniel|url= http://www.stltoday.com/news/national/american-zen-master-robert-aitken-dies/article_576cee2c-84fe-5dd2-a2b3-05ae1b84e4dc.html |title=American Zen master Robert Aitken dies|publisher=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=August 13, 2010|access-date=April 15, 2015}}</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:Robert Baker Aitken and Anne Hopkins Aitken.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Robert Baker Aitken and [[Anne Hopkins Aitken]]]]
Robert Aitken was born to [[Robert Thomas Aitken]] and Gladys Page Baker in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in 1917. He was raised in [[Hawaii]] from the age of five.

Living in [[Guam]] as a [[civilian]] working in [[construction]]—at the onset of [[World War II]]—he was detained by the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and held in [[internment camps]] for the duration of the war.<ref name="swans">{{cite book|last=Fields|first=Rick|title=How the Swans Came to the Lake: A Narrative History of Buddhism in America|year=1992|pages=201–202|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|isbn=0-87773-631-6}}</ref> In one such internment camp in [[Kobe, Japan]] in 1944 he met the [[scholar]] [[Reginald Horace Blyth]],<ref name="swans"/> with whom he had frequent discussions on [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[anarchism]]. At the conclusion of the war he returned to Hawaii and obtained a [[B.A.]] in [[English literature]] and an [[Masters degree|MA]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] from the [[University of Hawaii]].<ref name="aitken">{{cite book| last =Aitken, Robert| first =Merwin, W.S.| title =A Zen Wave: Basho's Haiku and Zen| publisher =[[Shoemaker & Hoard Publishers]]| year =2003| isbn =1-59376-008-6| page =[https://archive.org/details/zenwavebashoshai0000aitk_x0m7/page/ xi, xii]| url =https://archive.org/details/zenwavebashoshai0000aitk_x0m7/page/}}</ref><ref name="queen">{{cite book| last =Queen| first =Christopher S| title =Engaged Buddhism in the West| publisher =Wisdom publications| year =2000| pages =70–73| isbn = 0-86171-159-9}}</ref>

In the late 1940s, while going to classes briefly at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California]], he met [[Nyogen Senzaki]].<ref name="prebish">{{cite book| last =Prebish| first =Charles S| title =Luminous passage: the practice and study of Buddhism in America| publisher =[[University of California Press]]| year =1999| pages =19, 20, 21| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=XsHv_5VCzmMC&q=Aitken| isbn = 0-520-21697-0}}</ref>  Originally in California hoping for an encounter with [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti]], he began to study with Senzaki in [[Los Angeles]]. It was during this period that his commitment to leftist social issues - such as [[pacifism]] and [[labor rights]] – became more vocal. As a result of his advocacy, he was investigated during this period by the [[FBI]].

In 1950 he went back to [[Japan]], under a [[grant (money)|grant]] to study [[haiku]] and followed Senzaki's recommendation that he study Zen there.<ref name="swans"/> There he took part in his first [[sesshin]] at [[Engaku-ji]], a temple in [[Kamakura, Japan]].<ref name="swans"/> Soon after, he met [[Nakagawa Soen]], who persuaded him to come for a stay at [[Ryutakuji]] for the next seven months. During this period Soen took over for the ailing abbot of the temple, [[Yamamoto Gempo]].<ref name="swans"/> Aitken then came down with a case of dysentery, and returned home to Hawaii. He married his second wife Anne Hopkins in 1957 and made occasional trips back to Japan. In  1957 Aitken met [[Hakuun Yasutani]] and sat with him for the first time.<ref name="prebish"/><ref>{{cite book| last =Yasutani| first =Hakuun| author-link =Hakuun Yasutani| title =Flowers Fall: A Commentary on Zen Master Dogen's Genjokoan| publisher =Shambala| year =1996| pages = XXVI | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=oGLYAAAAMAAJ&q=Aitken| isbn = 1-57062-103-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last =Wenger| first =Michael| author-link =Michael Wenger| title =Wind Bell: Teachings from the San Francisco Zen Center (1968-2001)| publisher =[[North Atlantic Books]]| year =2001| url =https://archive.org/details/windbell00mich/page/| isbn =1-55643-381-6| page =[https://archive.org/details/windbell00mich/page/ viii]}}</ref><ref name="aitken"/><ref name="queen"/>

In 1959 he and Anne began a meditation group in Honolulu at their residence, which became known as the Koko-an [[zendo]]. The community that gathered at this zendo were then named the Diamond Sangha by the two. The Diamond Sangha has affiliate zen centers in [[South America]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] and is known for making the rigors of traditional Zen accessible to lay practitioners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondsangha.org/|title=Honolulu Diamond Sangha }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondsangha.org/Links.htm |title=Affiliates of the Diamond Sangha |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110123641/http://www.diamondsangha.org/Links.htm |archive-date=2010-01-10 }}</ref>

In 1960 Soen Nakagawa Roshi asked young monk [[Eido Tai Shimano]] to travel to Honolulu to assist at the Diamond Sangha center.<ref name="Ford">{{cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| author-link =James Ishmael Ford| title =Zen Master Who?: A Guide to the People and Stories of Zen| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2006| pages =114| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=-kut6gcyTNEC&pg=PA114| isbn = 0-86171-509-8}}</ref>

In 1961, Aitken made an extended stay in Japan to study under [[Haku'un Yasutani]], eventually ending his studies with Soen. He then worked in various capacities at the [[East-West Center]] and the [[University of Hawaii]] until 1969, when he and Anne moved to [[Maui, Hawaii]] to found the Maui Zendo in [[Haiku-Pauwela, Hawaii|Haiku-Pauwela]]. Koun Yamada Rōshi was invited to lead the Diamond Sangha and he moved to Hawaii in 1971. In 1974 Aitken was given permission to teach by [[Koun Yamada]], receiving full [[Dharma transmission]] from him in 1985.<ref name="prebish"/><ref name="chappell">{{cite book| last =Chappell| first =David W| title =Buddhist Peacework: Creating Cultures of Peace| publisher =[[Wisdom Publications]]| year =2000| isbn = 0-86171-167-X| page =93}}</ref>

Robert Aitken was a social activist through much of his adult life, beginning with protesting against [[nuclear testing]] during the 1940s. He was an outspoken critic of the [[Vietnam War]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Fields|first=Rick|title=How the Swans Came to the Lake: A Narrative History of Buddhism in America|year=1992|pages=256|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|isbn=0-87773-631-6}}</ref> and became a strong opponent of the [[nuclear arms race]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. He was among the earlier proponents of [[deep ecology]] in religious [[United States|America]], and was outspoken in his beliefs on the equality of men and women. In 1978 Aitken helped found the [[Buddhist Peace Fellowship]], an organization that advocates [[conflict resolution]] globally.<ref name="queen"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Burke|first=Daniel|url= http://www.stltoday.com/news/national/american-zen-master-robert-aitken-dies/article_576cee2c-84fe-5dd2-a2b3-05ae1b84e4dc.html |title=American Zen master Robert Aitken dies|publisher=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=August 13, 2010|access-date=April 15, 2015}}</ref>
