Bergen was a folklorist who worked on superstitions and customs. She had a specific interest in horticultural superstitions. As a result of her work documenting American immigrant animal and plant lore Bergen is regarded as being an early female pioneer of ethnobiology.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Svanberg|first1=Ingvar|title=Pioneers in European ethnobiology|last2=Łuczaj|first2=Łukasz|publisher=Uppsala Universitet|others=Monika Kujawska and Ingvar Svanberg|year=2014|isbn=978-91-554-8844-4|location=Uppsala|pages=283|chapter=The Contributions of Early Women Ethnobiologists|oclc=896814661|chapter-url=https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:760819/FULLTEXT01.pdf#page=283}}</ref> She also worked with her husband on a number of botanical books. In 1879 Bergen became ill with a spinal disease which invalided her.  She was also a contributor to ''[[Popular Science Monthly]]'' and ''[[Journal of American Folklore]]''. She was considered an authority on folklore despite her inability to go into the field. Her grandmother told her stories from her life in [[Lake George, New York]] and talked about quilts. Very few patterns had been recorded when Bergen photographed and wrote about them in her article which was one of the earliest collection quiltmakers of names and designs in 1894.<ref name="Barbara Brackmans MATERIAL CULTURE 2018">{{cite web | title=Fanny Dickerson Bergen: Folklorist | website=Barbara Brackman's MATERIAL CULTURE | date=2018-10-31 | url=http://barbarabrackman.blogspot.com/2018/10/fanny-dickerson-bergen-folklorist.html | access-date=2020-05-22}}</ref><ref name="WorldCat">{{cite web | title=Bergen, Fanny D. 1846-1924 (Fanny Dickerson) &#91;WorldCat Identities&#93; | website=WorldCat.org | url=http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-nr92018467/ | access-date=2020-05-22}}</ref><ref name="LC 1999">{{cite web | title=Bergen, Fanny D.
