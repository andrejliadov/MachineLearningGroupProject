A '''social class''' is a set of concepts in the [[social sciences]] and [[political theory]] centered on models of [[social stratification]] which occurs in [[class society]], in which people are grouped into a set of [[Dominance hierarchy|hierarchical]] social categories,<ref>{{cite book |author=Grant, J. Andrew |chapter=class, definition of |editor=Jones, R.J. Barry |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries A–F |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-24350-6 |page=161 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a29qBofx8Y8C&pg=PA161}}</ref> the most common being the [[Upper class|upper]], [[Middle class|middle]] and [[Working class|lower classes]].

"Class" is a subject of analysis for [[List of sociologists|sociologists]], [[political scientist]]s, [[anthropologists]] and [[Social history|social historians]]. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of "class" and the term has a wide range of sometimes conflicting meanings. Some people argue that due to [[social mobility]], class boundaries do not exist. In common parlance, the term "social class" is usually synonymous with "[[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic]] class", defined as "people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status", e.g., "the [[working class]]"; "an emerging professional class".<ref>Princeton University. [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=social+class&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&h=0 "Social class"]. WordNet Search 3.1. Retrieved on: 2012-01-25.</ref> However, academics distinguish social class and socioeconomic status, with the former referring to one's relatively stable sociocultural background and the latter referring to one's current social and economic situation and consequently being more changeable over time.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Rubin, M., Denson, N., Kilpatrick, S., Matthews, K.E., Stehlik, T., & Zyngier, D. |year=2014 |title="I am working-class": Subjective self-definition as a missing measure of social class and socioeconomic status in higher education research |journal=Educational Researcher |volume=43 |issue = 4|pages=196–200 |doi=10.3102/0013189X14528373|s2cid=145576929 }}</ref>

The precise measurements of what determines social class in society have varied over time. [[Karl Marx]] thought "class" was defined by one's relationship to the [[means of production]] (their [[relations of production]]). His understanding of classes in modern [[Capitalism|capitalist society]] is that the [[proletariat]] work but do not own the means of production, and the [[bourgeoisie]], those who invest and live off the surplus generated by the proletariat's operation of the [[means of production]], do not work at all. This contrasts with the view of the sociologist [[Max Weber]], who argued "class" is determined by economic position, in contrast to "[[social status]]" or "''Stand''"<!--German term, could be confused with English word, so italics needed--> which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.<ref>Weber, Max (1921/2015).

Edited and Translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, pp. 37–58.</ref> The term "class" is etymologically derived from the Latin ''classis'', which was used by [[census]] takers to categorize citizens by wealth in order to determine military service obligations.<ref>{{cite book |author=Brown, D.F. |chapter=Social class and Status |editor=Mey, Jacob |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Pragmatics |publisher=Elsevier |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-08-096297-9 |page=952 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmXgeBE7k0C&pg=PA952}}</ref>

In the late 18th century, the term "class" began to replace classifications such as [[Estates of the realm|estates]], [[Nobility|rank]] and [[Religious order|orders]] as the primary means of organizing society into hierarchical divisions. This corresponded to a general decrease in significance ascribed to hereditary characteristics and increase in the significance of wealth and [[income]] as indicators of position in the [[Social stratification|social hierarchy]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Class, Social |editor=Kuper, Adam |title=The social science encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-32096-2 |page=111 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oES3pJufP4C&pg=PA111}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Penney, Robert |chapter=Class, social|editor1=Christensen, Karen |editor2=Levinson, David |title=Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 1 |publisher=SAGE |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7619-2598-9 |page=189 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&pg=PA189}}</ref>

==History==
{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}
[[File:Burmese nobles.JPG|thumb|[[Burma|Burmese]] nobles and servants]]
Historically, social class and behavior were laid down in law. For example, permitted mode of dress in some times and places was strictly regulated, with sumptuous dressing only for the high ranks of society and [[aristocracy]], whereas [[sumptuary law]]s stipulated the dress and jewelry appropriate for a person's social rank and [[social status|station]]. In Europe, these laws became increasingly commonplace during the Middle Ages. However, these laws were prone to change due to societal changes, and in many cases, these distinctions may either almost disappear, such as the distinction between a patrician and a plebeian being almost erased during the late [[Roman Republic]].

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] had a large influence over political ideals of the [[French Revolution]] because of his views of inequality and classes. Rousseau saw humans as "naturally pure and good," meaning that humans from birth were seen as innocent and any evilness was learned. He believed that social problems arise through the development of society and suppressing the innate pureness of humankind. He also believed that [[private property]] is the main reason for social issues in society because private property creates inequality through the property's value. Even though his theory predicted if there were no private property then there would be wide spread equality, Rousseau accepted that there will always be social inequality because of how society is viewed and run.<ref name="Conley, Dalton 2017">{{cite book|author=Conley, Dalton|chapter=Stratification|editor=Bakeman, Karl|title=You May Ask Yourself, 5th Edition|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.|year=2017}}</ref>

Later Enlightenment thinkers viewed inequality as valuable and crucial to society's development and prosperity. They also acknowledged that private property will ultimately cause inequality because specific resources that are privately owned can be stored and the owners profit off of the deficit of the resource. This can create competition between the classes that was seen as necessary by these thinkers.<ref name="Conley, Dalton 2017"/> This also creates [[Social stratification|stratification]] between the classes keeping a distinct difference between lower, poorer classes and the higher, wealthier classes.

==Theoretical models==
Definitions of social classes reflect a number of [[social theory|sociological perspectives]], informed by [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. The major perspectives historically have been [[Marxism]] and [[structural functionalism]]. The common stratum model of class divides society into a simple hierarchy of [[working class]], [[middle class]] and [[upper class]]. Within academia, two broad schools of definitions emerge: those aligned with 20th-century sociological stratum models of [[class society]] and those aligned with the 19th-century [[historical materialist]] economic models of the [[Marxist]]s and [[anarchist]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Serravallo, Vincent|chapter=Class|editor=Parrillo, Vincent N.|title=Encyclopedia of social problems, Volume 1|publisher=SAGE|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4129-4165-5|page=131|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mRGr_B4Y1CEC&pg=PA131}}</ref><ref name="The American Class Structure">{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | year = 1998 | title = The American Class Structure | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-534-50520-2 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/americanclassstr0000gilb_c7f2 }}</ref><ref name="Marriages, Families & Intimate Relationships">{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian |author2=Stacey C.

Another distinction can be drawn between analytical concepts of social class, such as the Marxist and Weberian traditions, as well as the more empirical traditions such as [[socioeconomic status]] approach, which notes the correlation of income, education and wealth with social outcomes without necessarily implying a particular theory of social structure.<ref>John Scott, ''Class: critical concepts'' (1996) Volume 2 P. 310</ref>

===Marxist===

For Marx, class is a combination of objective and subjective factors. Objectively, a class shares a common [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]]. Subjectively, the members will necessarily have some perception ("[[class consciousness]]") of their similarity and common interest. Class consciousness is not simply an awareness of one's own class interest but is also a set of shared views regarding how society should be organized legally, culturally, socially and politically. These class relations are reproduced through time.

In [[Marxist theory]], the [[class structure]] of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is characterized by the conflict between two main classes: the [[bourgeoisie]], the capitalists who own the [[means of production]] and the much larger [[proletariat]] (or "working class") who must sell their own labour power ([[wage labour]]). This is the fundamental economic structure of work and property, a state of inequality that is normalized and [[Base and superstructure|reproduced through cultural ideology]].

For Marxists, every person in the process of production has separate social relationships and issues. Along with this, every person is placed into different groups that have similar interests and values that can differ drastically from group to group. Class is special in that does not relate to specifically to a singular person, but to a specific role.<ref name="Conley, Dalton 2017"/>

Marxists explain the history of "civilized" societies in terms of a [[class conflict|war of classes]] between those who control production and those who produce the goods or services in society. In the Marxist view of [[capitalism]], this is a conflict between capitalists ([[bourgeoisie]]) and wage-workers (the proletariat). For Marxists, class antagonism is rooted in the situation that control over social production necessarily entails control over the class which produces goods—in capitalism this is the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of workers by the bourgeoisie.<ref>Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels. "Manifesto of the Communist Party", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 231.</ref>

Furthermore, "in countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed".<ref>Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels. "Manifesto of the Communist Party", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 231</ref> "An industrial army of workmen, under the command of a capitalist, requires, like a real army, officers (managers) and sergeants (foremen, over-lookers) who, while the work is being done, command in the name of the capitalist".<ref>Karl Marx. ''Capital: An Analysis of Capitalist Production'', Volume 1; Moscow; 1959; p. 332.</ref>

Marx makes the argument that, as the bourgeoisie reach a point of wealth accumulation, they hold enough power as the dominant class to shape political institutions and society according to their own interests. Marx then goes on to claim that the non-elite class, owing to their large numbers, have the power to overthrow the elite and create an equal society.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Manifesto of the Communist Party|url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/|website = www.marxists.org|access-date = 2015-12-09}}</ref>

In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Marx himself argued that it was the goal of the proletariat itself to displace the capitalist system with [[socialism]], changing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which: "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all". This would mark the beginning of a [[classless society]] in which human needs rather than profit would be motive for production. In a society with democratic control and [[production for use]], there would be no class, no state and no need for financial and banking institutions and money.<ref>Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels. "Manifesto of the Communist Party", ''Selected Works'', Volume 1; London,' 1943; p. 232-234.</ref><ref>Karl Marx ''Critique of the Gotha Program'' (1875)</ref>

These theorists have taken this binary class system and expanded it to include contradictory class locations, the idea that a person can be employed in many different class locations that fall between the two classes of proletariat and bourgeoisie. [[Erik Olin Wright]] stated that class definitions are more diverse and elaborate through identifying with multiple classes, having familial ties with people in different a class, or having a temporary leadership role.<ref name="Conley, Dalton 2017"/>

===Weberian===
{{main|Three-component theory of stratification}}
[[Max Weber]] formulated a [[three-component theory of stratification]] that saw social class as emerging from an interplay between "class", "status" and "power". Weber believed that class position was determined by a person's relationship to the means of production, while status or "Stand" emerged from estimations of honor or prestige.<ref>Weber, Max (2015/1921).  "Classes, Stände, Parties" in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, pp. 37–57.</ref>

Weber views class as a group of people who have common goals and opportunities that are available to them. This means that what separates each class from each other is their value in the marketplace through their own goods and services. This creates a divide between the classes through the assets that they have such as property and expertise.<ref name="Conley, Dalton 2017"/>

Weber derived many of his key concepts on social stratification by examining the social structure of many countries. He noted that contrary to Marx's theories, stratification was based on more than simply ownership of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Weber pointed out that some members of the aristocracy lack economic wealth yet might nevertheless have political power. Likewise in Europe, many wealthy Jewish families lacked prestige and honor because they were considered members of a "pariah group".
* Class: A person's economic position in a society. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own.
* Status: A person's prestige, social honour or popularity in a society. Weber noted that political power was not rooted in capital value solely, but also in one's status. Poets and saints, for example, can possess immense influence on society with often little economic worth.
* Power: A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], or a member of the [[United States Congress]], may hold little property or status, but they still hold immense power.

[[Economic capital#Social science|Economic capital]] was defined as [[income]] and [[Asset (economics)|assets]]; [[cultural capital]] as amount and type of cultural interests and activities; and [[social capital]] as the quantity and [[social status]] of their [[Friendship|friends]], [[family]] and personal and business contacts.<ref name=BBCResults4213 /> This theoretical framework was developed by [[Pierre Bourdieu#Bourdieu's theory of class distinction|Pierre Bourdieu]] who first published his [[La Distinction|theory of social distinction]] in 1979.

===Three-level economic class model===

Today, concepts of social class often assume three general economic categories: a very wealthy and powerful upper class that owns and controls the means of production; a middle class of professional workers, [[small business]] owners and low-level [[managers]]; and a lower class, who rely on low-paying jobs for their livelihood and experience [[poverty]].

====Upper class====
{{Main|Upper class}}
{{See also|Elite|Aristocracy|Oligarchy|Ruling class}}
[[File:Troisordres.jpg|thumb|upright|A symbolic image of three orders of feudal society in Europe prior to the [[French Revolution]], which shows the rural third estate carrying the clergy and the nobility]]
The upper class<ref name="Brown-2009-953">{{cite book|author=Brown, D.F.|chapter=Social class and Status|editor=Mey, Jacob|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Pragmatics|publisher=Elsevier|year=2009|isbn=978-0-08-096297-9|page=953|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmXgeBE7k0C&pg=PA953}}</ref> is the social class composed of those who are [[economic inequality|rich]], well-born, powerful, or a combination of those. They usually wield the greatest political power. In some countries, wealth alone is sufficient to allow entry into the upper class. In others, only people who are born or marry into certain aristocratic bloodlines are considered members of the upper class and those who gain great wealth through commercial activity are looked down upon by the aristocracy as ''[[nouveau riche]]''.<ref>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, "nouveau riche French Usually Disparaging. a person who is newly rich", 1969, Random House</ref> In the United Kingdom, for example, the upper classes are the aristocracy and royalty, with wealth playing a less important role in class status. Many aristocratic peerages or titles have seats attached to them, with the holder of the title (e.g. Earl of Bristol) and his family being the custodians of the house, but not the owners. Many of these require high expenditures, so wealth is typically needed. Many aristocratic peerages and their homes are parts of estates, owned and run by the title holder with moneys generated by the land, rents or other sources of wealth. However, in the United States where there is no aristocracy or royalty, the upper class status belongs to the extremely wealthy, the so-called "super-rich", though there is some tendency even in the United States for those with old family wealth to look down on those who have earned their money in business, the struggle between [[nouveau riche|new money]] and [[old money]].

The upper class is generally contained within the richest one or two percent of the population. Members of the upper class are often born into it and are distinguished by immense wealth which is passed from generation to generation in the form of estates.<ref>{{cite book|author=Akhbar-Williams, Tahira|chapter=Class Structure|editor=Smith, Jessie C.|title=Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture, Volume 1|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|isbn=978-0-313-35796-1|page=322|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10rEGSIItjgC&pg=PA322}}</ref> Based on some new social and political theories upper class consists of the most wealthy decile group in society which holds nearly 87% of the whole society's wealth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baizidi|first=Rahim|date=2019-09-02|title=Paradoxical class: paradox of interest and political conservatism in middle class|journal=Asian Journal of Political Science|volume=27|issue=3|pages=272–285|doi=10.1080/02185377.2019.1642772|s2cid=199308683|issn=0218-5377}}</ref>

====Middle class====
{{Main|Middle class|Upper middle class|Lower middle class|Bourgeoisie}} See also: [[Middle-class squeeze]]
The middle class is the most contested of the three categories, the broad group of people in contemporary society who fall socio-economically between the lower and upper classes.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Middle class|editor=Stearns, Peter N.|title=Encyclopedia of social history|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8153-0342-8|page=621|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkIeyCEedrsC&pg=PA621}}</ref> One example of the contest of this term is that in the United States "middle class" is applied very broadly and includes people who would elsewhere be considered [[working class]]. Middle-class workers are sometimes called "[[white-collar worker]]s".

Theorists such as [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] have noted the tendency toward an enlarged middle class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological economies.<ref>Dahrendorf, Ralf. (1959) Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society. Stanford: Stanford University Press.</ref> Perspectives concerning [[globalization]] and [[neocolonialism]], such as [[dependency theory]], suggest this is due to the shift of low-level labour to [[developing nation]]s and the [[Third World]].<ref>Bornschier V. (1996), 'Western society in transition' New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers.</ref>

Middle class is the group of people with typical-everyday jobs that pay significantly more than the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]]. Examples of these types of jobs are factory workers, salesperson, teacher, cooks and nurses. There is a new trend by some scholars which assumes that the size of the middle class in every society is the same. For example, in paradox of interest theory, middle class are those who are in 6th-9th decile groups which hold nearly 12% of the whole society's wealth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baizidi|first=Rahim|date=2019-07-17|title=Paradoxical class: paradox of interest and political conservatism in middle class|journal=Asian Journal of Political Science|volume=0|issue=3|pages=272–285|doi=10.1080/02185377.2019.1642772|s2cid=199308683|issn=0218-5377}}</ref>

====Lower class====
[[File:Camden NJ poverty.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|In the United States the lowest stratum of the working class, the [[underclass]], often lives in urban areas with low-quality [[civil services]]]]
{{Main|Working class |Proletariat}}
{{See also|Precarity}}

Lower class (occasionally described as working class) are those employed in low-paying [[wage]] jobs with very little economic security. The term "lower class" also refers to persons with low income.

The working class is sometimes separated into those who are employed but lacking financial security (the "[[working poor]]") and an [[underclass]]—those who are long-term [[unemployment|unemployed]] and/or [[homelessness|homeless]], especially those receiving [[welfare]] from the [[state (polity)|state]]. The latter is today considered analogous to the Marxist term "[[lumpenproletariat]]". However, during the time of Marx's writing the lumpenproletariat referred to those in dire poverty; such as the homeless.<ref name="Brown-2009-953" /> Members of the working class are sometimes called [[blue-collar worker]]s.

Angus Deaton and Anne Case have analyzed the mortality rates related to the group of white, middle-aged Americans between the ages of 45 and 54 and its relation to class. There has been a growing number of suicides and deaths by substance abuse in this particular group of [[middle-class Americans]]. This group also has been recorded to have an increase in reports of chronic pain and poor general health. Deaton and Case came to the conclusion from these observations that because of the constant stress that these white, middle aged Americans feel fighting poverty and wavering between the middle and lower classes, these strains have taken a toll on these people and affected their whole bodies.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|title = Death Rates Rising for Middle-Aged White Americans, Study Finds|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/health/death-rates-rising-for-middle-aged-white-americans-study-finds.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-11-02|access-date = 2015-12-09|issn = 0362-4331|first = Gina|last = Kolata}}</ref>

Social classifications can also determine the sporting activities that such classes take part in. It is suggested that those of an upper social class are more likely to take part in sporting activities, whereas those of a lower social background are less likely to participate in sport. However, upper-class people tend to not take part in certain sports that have been commonly known to be linked with the lower class.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Thomas C.|year=2002|title=The Paradox of Social Class and Sports Involvement|journal=International Review for the Sociology of Sport|volume=37|pages=5–16|doi=10.1177/1012690202037001001|s2cid=144129391}}</ref>

===Education===
A person's social class has a significant impact on their educational opportunities. Not only are upper-class parents able to send their children to exclusive schools that are perceived to be better, but in many places, state-supported schools for children of the upper class are of a much higher quality than those the state provides for children of the lower classes.<ref>Jonathan Kozol, ''Savage Inequalities'', Crown, 1991</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=McDonough, Patricia M.|title=Choosing colleges: how social class and schools structure opportunity|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-7914-3477-2|pages=1–2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHdy8ql2mM4C&pg=PA1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|authors=Shin, Kwang-Yeong & Lee, Byoung-Hoon|chapter=Social class and educational opportunity in South Korea|editor1=Attewell, Paul |editor2=Newman, Katherine S.|title=Growing gaps: educational inequality around the world|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-973218-0|page=105|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tqf8ShfYk_YC&pg=PA105}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|authors=McNamee, Stephen J. & Miller, Robert K.|title=The meritocracy myth|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7425-6168-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/meritocracymyth0000mcna/page/199 199]|url=https://archive.org/details/meritocracymyth0000mcna|url-access=registration}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|authors=Thomas, Scott L. & Bell, Angela|chapter=Social class and higher education: a reorganization of opportunities|editor=Weis, Lois|title=The Way Class Works: Readings on School, Family, and the Economy|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2007|isbn=978-0-415-95707-6|page=273|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sj1HCJaRkHMC&pg=PA273}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|authors=Sacks, Peter|title=Tearing down the gates confronting the class divide in American education|publisher=University of California Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-520-24588-4|pages=112–14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EE-m0ZwjuqsC&pg=PA112}}</ref> This lack of good schools is one factor that perpetuates the class divide across generations.

In the UK, the educational consequences of class position have been discussed by scholars inspired by the [[cultural studies]] framework of the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|CCCS]] and/or, especially regarding working-class girls, [[feminist theory]]. On working-class boys, [[Paul Willis]]' 1977 book ''[[Learning to Labour|Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs]]'' is seen within the [[Cultural studies#British Cultural Studies|British Cultural Studies]] field as a [[classic]] discussion of their antipathy to the acquisition of knowledge.<ref>Willis, Paul (1977).

Farnborough: Saxon House. {{ISBN|978-0-5660-0150-5}}</ref> [[Beverley Skeggs]] described ''Learning to Labour'' as a study on the "[[irony]]" of "how the process of cultural and economic reproduction is made possible by 'the lads' ' celebration of the hard, macho world of work."<ref>Skeggs, Beverley (1992).

===Health and nutrition===
{{main|Social determinants of health}}
A person's social class has a significant impact on their physical health, their ability to receive adequate [[medical care]] and [[nutrition]] and their [[life expectancy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Barr, Donald A.|title=Health disparities in the United States: social class, race, ethnicity, and health|publisher=JHU Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8018-8821-2|pages=1–2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US21MlGw3-IC&pg=PA1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Gulliford, Martin|chapter=Equity and access to health care|editor1=Gulliford, Martin |editor2=Morgan, Myfanwy|title=Access to health care|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-415-27546-0|page=39|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOXP05u5alAC&pg=PA39}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Budrys, Grace|title=Unequal Health: How Inequality Contributes to Health Or Illness|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7425-6507-4|pages=183–84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUSM_kCNsSAC&pg=PA183}}</ref>

Lower-class people experience a wide array of health problems as a result of their economic status. They are unable to use health care as often and when they do it is of lower quality, even though they generally tend to experience a much higher rate of health issues. Lower-class families have higher rates of [[infant mortality]], [[cancer]], [[cardiovascular disease]] and disabling physical injuries. Additionally, poor people tend to work in much more hazardous conditions, yet generally have much less (if any) health insurance provided for them, as compared to middle- and upper-class workers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Liu, William Ming|title=Social Class and Classism in the Helping Professions: Research, Theory, and Practice|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4129-7251-2|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4IbVbxXisUgC&pg=PA29}}</ref>

===Employment===
The conditions at a person's job vary greatly depending on class. Those in the upper-middle class and middle class enjoy greater freedoms in their occupations. They are usually more respected, enjoy more diversity and are able to exhibit some authority.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Maclean|first1=Mairi|last2=Harvey|first2=Charles|last3=Kling|first3=Gerhard|date=2014-06-01|title=Pathways to Power: Class, Hyper-Agency and the French Corporate Elite|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=825–55|doi=10.1177/0170840613509919|s2cid=145716192|issn=0170-8406|url=http://opus.bath.ac.uk/50376/3/Maclean_Harvey_Kling_OS_2014.pdf}}</ref> Those in lower classes tend to feel more alienated and have lower work satisfaction overall. The physical conditions of the workplace differ greatly between classes. While middle-class workers may "suffer alienating conditions" or "lack of job satisfaction", blue-collar workers are more apt to suffer alienating, often routine, work with obvious physical health hazards, injury and even death.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kerbo  | first = Herald | title = Social Stratification and Inequality  | publisher = The McGraw-Hill Companies Inc. | year = 1996 | location = New York | pages = 231–33 | isbn =978-0-07-034258-3 }}</ref>

In the UK, a 2015 government study by the [[Social Mobility Commission]] suggested the existence of a "glass floor" in British society preventing those who are less able, but who come from wealthier backgrounds, from slipping down the social ladder. The report proposed a 35% greater likelihood of less able, better-off children becoming high earners than bright poor children.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission|title=New research exposes the 'glass floor' in British society|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-research-exposes-the-glass-floor-in-british-society|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2015-09-22}}</ref>

==Class conflict==
{{Main|Class conflict}}

Class conflict, frequently referred to as "class warfare" or "class struggle", is the tension or antagonism which exists in society due to competing [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] interests and desires between people of different classes.

For Marx, the history of [[class society]] was a history of class conflict. He pointed to the successful rise of the bourgeoisie and the necessity of revolutionary violence—a heightened form of class conflict—in securing the bourgeois rights that supported the capitalist economy.

Marx believed that the exploitation and poverty inherent in capitalism were a pre-existing form of class conflict. Marx believed that wage labourers would need to [[revolt]] to bring about a [[Wealth redistribution|more equitable distribution of wealth]] and political power.<ref>{{cite book|author=Streeter, Calvin L.|chapter=Community|editor=Mizrahi, Terry|title=Encyclopedia of social work, Volume 1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-530661-3|page=352|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aF-Mpm9JDogC&pg=PA352}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Hunt, Stephen|chapter=class conflict|editor1=Ritzer, George |editor2=Ryan, J.

==Classless society==
{{Main|Classless society}}

A "classless" society is one in which no one is born into a social class. Distinctions of [[wealth]], [[income]], [[education]], [[culture]] or [[social network]] might arise and would only be determined by individual experience and achievement in such a society.

Since these distinctions are difficult to avoid, advocates of a classless society (such as [[anarchists]] and [[communists]]) propose various means to achieve and maintain it and attach varying degrees of importance to it as an end in their overall programs/philosophy.

==Relationship between ethnicity and class==
{{Further|Racial inequality}}
[[File:Elizaveta with Black Servant by Grooth (1743, Hermitage).jpg|thumb|upright|Equestrian portrait of Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] with a [[Moors|Moor]] servant]]

[[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]] and other large-scale groupings can also influence class standing. The association of particular ethnic groups with class statuses is common in many societies. As a result of conquest or internal ethnic differentiation, a ruling class is often ethnically homogenous and particular races or ethnic groups in some societies are legally or customarily restricted to occupying particular class positions. Which ethnicities are considered as belonging to high or low classes varies from society to society.

In modern societies, strict legal links between ethnicity and class have been drawn, such as the [[caste system in Africa]], [[apartheid]], the position of the [[Burakumin]] in Japanese society and the [[casta]] system in Latin America.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
