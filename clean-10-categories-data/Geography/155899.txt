'''Human ecology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] study of the relationship between [[human]]s and their [[natural environment|natural]], [[Social environment|social]], and [[built environment]]s. The philosophy and study of human ecology has a diffuse history with advancements in [[ecology]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[zoology]], [[epidemiology]], [[public health]], and [[home economics]], among others.

==Historical development==
{{more|History of ecology}}
The roots of ecology as a broader discipline can be traced to the Greeks and a lengthy list of developments in [[natural history|natural history science]]. Ecology also has notably developed in other cultures. Traditional knowledge, as it is called, includes the human propensity for intuitive knowledge, intelligent relations, understanding, and for passing on information about the natural world and the human experience.<ref name="Young74" /><ref name="Huntignton00">{{cite journal | last1=Huntington | first1=H.

Like other contemporary researchers of his time, Haeckel adopted his terminology from [[Carl Linnaeus]] where human ecological connections were more evident. In his 1749 publication, ''Specimen academicum de oeconomia naturae'', Linnaeus developed a science that included the ''economy and polis of nature''. Polis stems from its Greek roots for a political community (originally based on the city-states), sharing its roots with the word police in reference to the promotion of growth and maintenance of good social order in a community.<ref name="Young74" /><ref name="Pearce10">{{cite journal | last1=Pearce | first1=T. | title=A great complication of circumstances | journal=Journal of the History of Biology | date=2010 | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=493–528 | doi=10.1007/s10739-009-9205-0 | pmid=20665080 | s2cid=34864334 | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~/trpearce/Pearce2010.pdf | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331011216/http://home.uchicago.edu/~/trpearce/Pearce2010.pdf | archive-date=2012-03-31 }}</ref><ref name="Kricher09">{{cite book | last1=Kricher | first1=J. | title=The balance of nature: Ecology's enduring myth | publisher=Princeton University Press | pages=252 | isbn=978-0-691-13898-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G66yLaHLv2QC&q=Specimen+academicum+de+oeconomia+naturae+to+english&pg=PP1| date=2009-04-27 }}</ref><ref name="Egerton07">{{cite journal | last1=Egerton | first1=F.

Ecology is not just biological, but a human science as well.<ref name="Odum05" /> An early and influential social scientist in the history of human ecology was [[Herbert Spencer]]. Spencer was influenced by and reciprocated his influence onto the works of Charles Darwin. Herbert Spencer coined the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]", he was an early founder of sociology where he developed the idea of society as an organism, and he created an early precedent for the socio-ecological approach that was the subsequent aim and link between sociology and human ecology.<ref name="Young74" /><ref name="Catton94">{{cite journal | last1=Catton | first1=W.

In 1894, an influential [[Chicago school (sociology)|sociologist at the University of Chicago]] named [[Albion W. Small]] collaborated with sociologist [[George E. Vincent]] and published a ""laboratory guide" to studying people in their "every-day occupations.""<ref name="Gross04" />{{rp|578}} This was a guidebook that trained students of sociology how they could study [[society]] in a way that a [[natural history|natural historian]] would study birds.

The first English-language use of the term "ecology" is credited to American chemist and founder of the field of home economics, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]]. Richards first introduced the term as "[[oekology]]" in 1892, and subsequently developed the term "human ecology".<ref name="Merchant2"/>

The term "human ecology" first appeared in [[Ellen Swallow Richards]]' 1907 ''Sanitation in Daily Life'', where it was defined as "the study of the surroundings of human beings in the effects they produce on the lives of men".<ref>{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Ellen H.|title=Sanitation in Daily Life|orig-year=1907 |year=2012|publisher=Forgotten Books|asin=B008KX8KGA|pages=v|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sanitation-Daily-Life-Classic-Reprint/dp/B008KX8KGA#reader_B008KX8KGA}}</ref> Richard's use of the term recognized humans as part of rather than separate from nature.<ref name="Merchant2">{{cite book|last=Merchant|first=C.|title=American Environmental History: An Introduction|date=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0231140355|pages=181}}</ref> The term made its first formal appearance in the field of sociology in the 1921 book "Introduction to the Science of Sociology",<ref name="Park21">{{cite book | editor1-last=Park | editor1-first=R.

<blockquote>Today there is greater emphasis on the problems facing individuals and how actors deal with them with the consequence that there is much more attention to decision-making at the individual level as people strategize and optimize risk, costs and benefits within specific contexts. Rather than attempting to formulate a cultural ecology or even a specifically “human ecology” model, researchers more often draw on demographic, economic and evolutionary theory as well as upon models derived from field ecology.<ref name="Bates12" />{{rp|1}}</blockquote>

While theoretical discussions continue, research published in ''[[Human Ecology Review]]'' suggests that recent discourse has shifted toward applying principles of human ecology. Some of these applications focus instead on addressing problems that cross disciplinary boundaries or transcend those boundaries altogether. Scholarship has increasingly tended away from [[Gerald L. Young]]'s idea of a "unified theory" of human ecological knowledge—that human ecology may emerge as its own discipline—and more toward the pluralism best espoused by [[Paul Shepard]]: that human ecology is healthiest when "running out in all directions.".<ref name="Shepard67">{{cite journal | last1=Shepard | first1=P. | date=1967 | title=What ever happened to human ecology? | journal=BioScience | volume=17 | issue=12 | pages=891–894 | jstor=1293928 | doi = 10.2307/1293928 }}</ref>  But human ecology is neither anti-discipline nor anti-theory, rather it is the ongoing attempt to formulate, synthesize, and apply theory to bridge the widening schism between man and nature. This new human ecology emphasizes complexity over [[reductionism]], focuses on changes over stable states, and expands ecological concepts beyond plants and animals to include people.

==Application to epidemiology and public health==
The application of ecological concepts to epidemiology has similar roots to those of other disciplinary applications, with Carl Linnaeus having played a seminal role. However, the term appears to have come  into common use in the medical and public health literature in the mid-twentieth century.<ref>Corwin EHL. Ecology of health. New York: Commonwealth Fund, 1949.

==Connection to home economics==
In addition to its links to other disciplines, human ecology has a strong historical linkage to the field of home economics through the work of [[Ellen Swallow Richards]], among others. However, as early as the 1960s, a number of universities began to rename home economics departments, schools, and colleges as human ecology programs. In part, this name change was a response to perceived difficulties with the term home economics in a modernizing society, and reflects a recognition of human ecology as one of the initial choices for the discipline which was to become home economics.<ref name=Cornell>{{cite web|title=Why the Change to Human Ecology?|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/homeEc/cases/namechange.html|publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref> Current human ecology programs include the [[University of Wisconsin School of Human Ecology]], the [[Cornell University College of Human Ecology]], and the University of Alberta's Department of Human Ecology,<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Alberta Department of Human Ecology|url=http://www.hecol.ualberta.ca/}}</ref> among others.

Nature is a [[Resilience (ecology)|resilient]] system. Ecosystems regenerate, withstand, and are forever adapting to fluctuating environments. Ecological resilience is an important conceptual framework in conservation management and it is defined as the preservation of biological relations in ecosystems that persevere and regenerate in response to disturbance over time. However, persistent, systematic, large and nonrandom disturbance caused by the niche constructing behavior of human beings, habitat conversion and land development, has pushed many of the Earth's ecosystems to the extent of their resilient thresholds. Three planetary thresholds have already been crossed, including [[biodiversity loss]], [[climate change]], and [[nitrogen cycle]]s. These biophysical systems are ecologically interrelated and naturally resilient, but human civilization has transitioned the planet to an [[Anthropocene]] epoch, where the threshold for planetary scale resilience has been crossed and the ecological state of the Earth is deteriorating rapidly to the detriment of humanity.<ref name="Rockström09">{{Cite journal |last1 = Rockström |first1 = W. |last2 = Noone |first2 = K. |last3=Persson| first3=A. | last4=Chapin| first4=S. | last5=Lambin | first5=E.

[[Ecological economics]] is an [[economics|economic science]] that extends its methods of valuation onto nature in an effort to address the inequity between market growth and biodiversity loss.<ref name="de Groot02" /> Natural capital is the stock of materials or information stored in biodiversity that generates services that can enhance the welfare of communities.<ref name="Costanza97">{{Cite journal|author=Costanza, R. |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |volume=387 |pages=253–260 |date=1997 |url=http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Nature_Paper.pdf |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |issue=6630 |display-authors=1 |last2=d'Arge |first2=Ralph |last3=De Groot |first3=Rudolf |last4=Farber |first4=Stephen |last5=Grasso |first5=Monica |last6=Hannon |first6=Bruce |last7=Limburg |first7=Karin |last8=Naeem |first8=Shahid |last9=O'Neill |first9=Robert V. |last10=Paruelo |first10=Jose |last11=Raskin |first11=Robert G. |last12=Sutton |first12=Paul |last13=Van Den Belt |first13=Marjan |bibcode=1997Natur.387..253C |s2cid=672256 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226124242/http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Nature_Paper.pdf |archive-date=2009-12-26 }}</ref> Population losses are the more sensitive indicator of natural capital than are species extinction in the accounting of ecosystem services.

The work of [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] is notable for building on the integration between ecology and its economic origins. Boulding drew parallels between ecology and economics, most generally in that they are both studies of individuals as members of a system, and indicated that the “household of man” and the “household of nature” could somehow be integrated to create a perspective of greater value.<ref>Boulding, K.E. 1950. ''An Ecological Introduction''.  In A Reconstruction of Economics, Wiley, New York. pp. 3-17.</ref><ref>Boulding, K.E. 1966. ''Economics and Ecology''.  In Nature Environments of North America, F.F. Darling and J.P. Milton, eds, Doubleday New York. pp.225-231.</ref>

==Interdisciplinary approaches==
{{quote box
| quote =
Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bio-ecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bio-ecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three.<ref name="Young74" />{{Rp|8–9}}

Human ecology expands functionalism from ecology to the human mind. People's perception of a complex world is a function of their ability to be able to comprehend beyond the immediate, both in time and in space. This concept manifested in the popular slogan promoting sustainability: "think global, act local." Moreover, people's conception of community stems from not only their physical location but their mental and emotional connections and varies from "community as place, community as way of life, or community of collective action."<ref name="Young74"/>

In these early years, human ecology was still deeply enmeshed in its respective disciplines: geography, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. Scholars through the 1970s until present have called for a greater integration between all of the scattered disciplines that has each established formal ecological research.<ref name="Young74"/><ref name="Liu07" />

===In art===

While some of the early writers considered how art fit into a human ecology, it was Sears who posed the idea that in the long run human ecology will in fact look more like art. [[Bill Carpenter (writer)|Bill Carpenter]] (1986) calls human ecology the "possibility of an aesthetic science," renewing dialogue about how art fits into a human ecological perspective. According to Carpenter, human ecology as an aesthetic science counters the disciplinary fragmentation of knowledge by examining human consciousness.<ref>Carpenter, B. 1986. ''Human Ecology: The Possibility of an Aesthetic Science''. Paper presented at the Society for Human Ecology conference.</ref>

===In education===

While the reputation of human ecology in institutions of higher learning is growing, there is no human ecology at the primary or secondary education levels, with one notable exception, Syosset High School, in Long Island, New York. Educational theorist Sir [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Kenneth Robinson]] has called for diversification of education to promote creativity in academic and non-academic (i.e.- educate their “whole being”) activities to implement a “new conception of human ecology”.<ref>Robinson, K. 2006. TED Talk, http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html</ref>

==Bioregionalism and urban ecology==
{{main|Bioregionalism}}
{{see also|Urban ecology}}

In the late 1960s, ecological concepts started to become integrated into the applied fields, namely [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], and [[planning]]. [[Ian McHarg]] called for a future when all planning would be “human ecological planning” by default, always bound up in humans’ relationships with their environments. He emphasized local, place-based planning that takes into consideration all the “layers” of information from [[geology]] to [[botany]] to zoology to [[cultural history]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McHarg | first1 = I. | date = 1981 | title = Ecological Planning at Pennsylvania | journal = Landscape Planning | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 109–120 | doi=10.1016/0304-3924(81)90029-0}}</ref> Proponents of the [[new urbanism]] movement, like [[James Howard Kunstler]] and [[Andres Duany]], have embraced the term human ecology as way to describe the problem of—and prescribe the solutions for—the landscapes and lifestyles of an automobile oriented society. Duany has called the human ecology movement to be "the agenda for the years ahead."<ref>In Kunstler, J.H. 1994. ''The Geography of Nowhere''. New York:Touchstone. pp.260</ref> While McHargian planning is still widely respected, the [[landscape urbanism]] movement seeks a new understanding between human and environment relations.  Among these theorists is [[Frederich Steiner]], who published ''Human Ecology: Following Nature's Lead'' in 2002 which focuses on the relationships among landscape, culture, and planning. The work highlights the beauty of scientific inquiry by revealing those purely human dimensions which underlie our concepts of ecology.  While Steiner discusses specific ecological settings, such as cityscapes and waterscapes, and the relationships between socio-cultural and environmental regions, he also takes a diverse approach to ecology—considering even the unique synthesis between ecology and [[political geography]]. [[Deiter Steiner]]'s 2003 ''Human Ecology: Fragments of Anti-fragmentary'' view of the world is an important expose of recent trends in human ecology.  Part literature review, the book is divided into four sections: "human ecology", "the implicit and the explicit", "structuration", and "the regional dimension".<ref>Steiner, D. and M. Nauser (eds.). 1993. ''Human Ecology: Fragments of Anti-fragmentary Views of the World.'' London and New York: Routledge. Human Ecology Forum 108 ''Human Ecology Review'', 2008; Vol. 15, No. 1,</ref> Much of the work stresses the need for transciplinarity, antidualism, and wholeness of perspective.
