== Function ==
A check dam placed in the [[ditch]], swale, or [[canal|channel]] interrupts the flow of water and flattens the gradient of the channel, thereby reducing the velocity. In turn, this obstruction induces [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] and reduces [[Erosion|eroding]].<ref name="Marsh, Landscape Planning">{{cite book|last1=Marsh|first1=William M.|title=Landscape Planning: Environmental Applications|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=Danvers, MA|isbn=978-0-470-57081-4|pages=267–268|edition=5th}}<!--|accessdate=October 27, 2014--></ref> They can be used not only to slow flow velocity but also to distribute flows across a swale to avoid preferential paths and guide flows toward vegetation.<ref name='Melbourne Water, "WSUD"'>{{cite book|last1=Melbourne Water|title=Water Sensitive Urban Design Engineering Procedures: Stormwater|date=2005|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-643-09092-7|page=140|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AF9K93GWw2AC&printsec=frontcover&q=WSUD%20Engineering%20Procedures%3A%20Stormwater%3A%20Stormwater|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> Although some [[sedimentation]] may result behind the dam, check dams do not primarily function as sediment trapping devices.<ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"'>{{cite book|last1=Iowa Statewide Urban Design and Specifications (SUDAS)|title=Design Manual - Erosion and Sediment Control|date=2013|publisher=Institute for Transportation at Iowa State University|location=Ames, IA|url=http://www.iowasudas.org/manuals/design/Chapter07/7E-7.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109234810/http://www.iowasudas.org/manuals/design/Chapter07/7E-7.pdf|archive-date=9 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

For instance, in [[Graliwdo]] River in Ethiopia, an increase of [[hydraulic roughness]] by check dams and water transmission losses in deposited sediments are responsible for the delay of runoff to reach the lower part of the river channels. The reduction of peak runoff discharge was larger in the river segment with check dams and vegetation (minus 12%) than in segment without treatment (minus 5.5%). Reduction of total runoff volume was also larger in the river with check dams than in the untreated river. The implementation of check dams combined with vegetation reduced [[peak flow]] discharge and total runoff volume as large parts of runoff infiltrated in the sediments deposited behind the check dams. As gully check dams are implemented in a large areas of northern Ethiopia, this contributes to [[groundwater recharge]] and increased river baseflow.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Etefa Guyassa|first1= and colleagues| title= Effects of check dams on runoff characteristics along gully reaches, the case of Northern Ethiopia|journal= Journal of Hydrology |date=2017 |volume=545 |pages=299–309 |doi= 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.12.019|bibcode= 2017JHyd..545..299G|url= https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8518957}}</ref>

== Applications ==

=== Grade control mechanism ===

Check dams have traditionally been implemented in two environments: across channel bottoms and on hilly slopes.<ref name='Garcia, Carmelo, "Check Dams"'>{{cite book|last1=Garcia|first1=Carmelo & Mario Lenzi|title=Check Dams, Morphological Adjustments and Erosion Control in Torrential Streams|date=2010|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-61761-749-2}}<!--|accessdate=28 October 2014--></ref>  Check dams are used primarily to control water velocity, conserve soil, and improve land.<ref>A conceptual model of check dam hydraulics for gully control:efficiency, optimal spacing and relation with step-pools C. Castillo, R. Pérez, and J. A. Gómez from Hydrology and Earth System Sciences 18, 1705–1721, 2014</ref> They are used when other flow-control practices, such as lining the channel or creating [[bioswales]], are impractical.<ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /> Accordingly, they are commonly used in degrading temporary channels, in which permanent stabilization is impractical and infeasible in terms of resource allocation and funding due to the short life period.  Or, they are used when construction delays and weather conditions prevent timely installation of other erosion control practices.<ref name=NCDENR>{{cite book|last1=North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources|title=Practice Standards and Specifications|date=2006|publisher=NCDENR|location=Raleigh, N.C.|pages=6.83.1–6.83.3|url=http://portal.ncdenr.org/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=efbff6bd-e595-4828-be6a-394be4c404c2&groupId=38334|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130724071109/http://portal.ncdenr.org/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=efbff6bd-e595-4828-be6a-394be4c404c2&groupId=38334|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-07-24|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> This is typically seen during the construction process of large-scale permanent [[dams]] or erosion control. As such, check dams serve as temporary grade-control mechanisms along waterways until resolute stabilization is established or along permanent swales that need protection prior to installation of a non-erodible lining.<ref name="UDFCD, Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual">{{cite book|last1=Urban Drainage and Flood Control District|title=Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual Volume 3|date=2010|publisher=Urban Drainage and Flood Control District|location=Colorado|url=http://www.udfcd.org/downloads/pdf/critmanual/Volume%203%20PDFs/chapter%207%20fact%20sheets/EC-12%20Check%20Dam.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905051511/http://www.udfcd.org/downloads/pdf/critmanual/Volume%203%20PDFs/chapter%207%20fact%20sheets/EC-12%20Check%20Dam.pdf|archive-date=2012-09-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Water quality control mechanism ===
Many check dams tend to form [[stream pool]]s. Under low-flow circumstances, water either [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrates]] into the ground, [[Evaporation|evaporates]], or seeps through or under the dam. Under high flow - [[flood]] - conditions, water flows over or through the structure. Coarse and medium-grained sediment from [[Runoff (water)|runoff]] tends to be deposited behind check dams, while finer grains flow through. Floating garbage is also trapped by check dams, increasing their effectiveness as water quality control measures.

=== Arid regions ===
[[File:Log Dam May Qoqah.jpg|thumb|Boulder-faced log dam in [[Maygwa]], Ethiopia]]
In arid areas, check dams are often built to increase [[groundwater recharge]] in a process called managed aquifer recharge. Winter runoff thus can be stored in aquifers, from which the water can be withdrawn during the dry season for irrigation, livestock watering, and even drinking water supply. This is particularly useful for small settlements located far from a large urban center as check dams require less reliance on machinery, funding, or advanced understandings as compared to large-scale dam implementation.<ref>S. Parimala Renganayaki, L. Elango (April 2013). "A review on managed aquifer recharge by check dams: a case study near Chennai, India". : International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology 2 (4): 416–423</ref><ref name='Agoramoorthy, "The Check Dam Route"' />

Check dams can be used in combination with [[liman irrigation system|limans]] to stop and collect [[surface runoff]] water.

=== Mountainous regions ===
As a strategy to stabilize mountain streams, the construction of check dams has a long tradition in many mountainous regions dating back to the 19th century in Europe. Because of the steep slopes in the mountain region, it may be difficult for large construction machinery to reach mountain streams; therefore, check dams have been implemented in place of large-scale dams.  Because the typical high slope causes the flow velocity to move faster, a terraced system of multiple closely spaced check dams is typically necessary to reduce velocity and thereby counteract erosion.  Such consolidation check dams, built in terraces, attempt to prevent both headward and downward cutting into channel beds while also stabilizing adjacent hill slopes. They are further used to mitigate flood and debris flow hazards.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mazzorana|first1=Bruno|title=The susceptibility of consolidation check dams as a key factor for maintenance planning|journal=Österreichische Wasser- und Abfallwirtschaft|date=6 June 2014|volume=66|issue=5|pages=214–216|doi=10.1007/s00506-014-0160-4|s2cid=130712151}}</ref>

== Design considerations ==

=== Site ===
Before installing a check dam, engineers inspect the site. Standard practices call for the [[Drainage basin|drainage area]] to be ten acres or less.<ref name="MS DEQ, Erosion Stormwater Manual" /><ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' />  The waterway should be on a slope of no more than 50% and should have a minimum depth to bedrock of 2&nbsp;ft.<ref name='Idaho DEQ, "Stormwater Best Management Practices"'>{{cite book|last1=Department of Environmental Quality|title=IDEQ Stormwater Best Management Practices Catalog: Check Dams BMP 32|date=2005|publisher=State of Idaho|pages=106–108|url=http://www.deq.idaho.gov/media/617590-32.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref>  Check dams are often used in natural or constructed channels or swales. They should never be placed in live streams unless approved by appropriate local, state and/or federal authorities.<ref name='Idaho DEQ, "Stormwater Best Management Practices"' />

=== Materials ===

[[File:Log dam in Adawro river.jpg|thumb|Log dam in [[Adawro]] river, Ethiopia]]
Check dams are made of a variety of materials. Because they are typically used as temporary structures, they are often made of cheap and accessible materials such as rocks, gravel, logs, hay bales, and sandbags.<ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /><ref name="nyssen">{{cite journal |last1=Nyssen |first1= J. and colleagues|title= Boulder-Faced Log Dams as an Alternative for Gabion Check Dams in First-Order Ephemeral Streams with Coarse Bed Load in Ethiopia |journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering |date=2017 |volume=143 |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001217}}</ref> Of these, logs and rock check dams are usually permanent or semi-permanent; and the sandbag check dam is implemented primarily for temporary purposes. Also, there are check dams that are constructed with rockfill or wooden boards. These dams are usually implemented only in small, open channels that drain {{convert|10|acre|km2|2|abbr=on}} or less; and usually do not exceed {{convert|2|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} high.<ref name=NRCS>{{cite web|last1=USDA Natural Resource Conservation Services (NRCS)|title=Urban BMPs: Water Erosion|url=ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/WSI/UrbanBMPs/water/erosion/checkdam.pdf|website=usda.gov|publisher=USDA|accessdate=28 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Woven-wire can be used to construct check dams in order to hold fine material in a gully. They are typically utilized in environments where the gully has a moderate slope (less than 10%), small drainage area, and in regions where flood flows do not typically carry large rocks or boulders.<ref name=FAO>{{cite web|title=FAO Watershed Management Field Manual|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/ad082e/ad082e03.htm|website=fao.org|publisher=Food and Agricultural Organizations of the United Nations|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref><ref name="nyssen"/> In nearly all instances, erosion control blankets, which are biodegradable open-weave blankets, are used in conjunction with check dams. These blankets help enforce vegetation growth on the slopes, shorelines and ditch bottoms.

===Size ===
Check dams are usually less than {{convert|2|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3|ft|m|2|abbr=on}} high.<ref name="USDA BMPs">{{cite book|title=Urban BMPs: Water, erosion, check dams|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|url=ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/WSI/UrbanBMPs/water/erosion/checkdam.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the center of the dam should be at least {{convert|6|in|m|2|abbr=on}} lower than its edges.<ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' /> This criteria induces a weir effect, resulting in increased water surface level upstream for some, if not all flow conditions.<ref name="UK pdf">{{cite book|last1=Rickard|first1=Charles & Rodney Day, Jeremy Purseglove|title=River Weirs – Good Practice Guide|date=2003|publisher=Environment Agency|location=UK|page=xi|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/290655/sw5b-023-hqp-e-e.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref>

=== Spacing ===

In order to effectively slow water velocity to reduce erosion and to protect the channel between dams in a larger system, the spacing must be designed properly. The check dams should be spaced such that the toe of the upstream check dam is equal to the elevation of the downstream check dam's crest.<ref>
{{cite web|url=https://wiki.sustainabletechnologies.ca/wiki/Check_dams |title=Check dams |author= Sustainable Technologies Evaluation Program |website= Low Impact Development Stormwater Management Planning and Design Guide |access-date= 28 March 2018}}</ref>  By doing so, the water can pond between check dams and thus slow the flow's velocity down substantially as the water progresses downslope.<ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' />

== Advantages ==

Check dams are a highly effective practice to reduce flow velocities in channels and waterways.  In contrast to big dams, check dams are implemented faster, are cost effective, and are smaller in scope.  Because of this, their implementation does not typically displace people and communities nor do they destroy natural resources if designed correctly.<ref name='Agoramoorthy, "Small Size, Big Potential"'>{{cite journal|last1=Agoramoorthy|first1=Govindasamy, and Minna J. Hsu|title=Small Size, Big Potential: Check Dams for Sustainable Development|journal=Environment|date=2008|volume=50|issue=4|pages=22–34|doi=10.3200/envt.50.4.22-35|s2cid=153334085|id={{ProQuest|224015181}}}}</ref> Moreover, the dams are simple to construct and do not rely on advanced technologies – thereby they can be applied in rural communities with fewer resources or access to technical expertise, as they have been in India's drylands for some time now.<ref name='Agoramoorthy, "Small Size, Big Potential"' />

== Limitations ==

Check dams still require maintenance and sediment removal practices.  They become more difficult to implement on steep slopes, as velocity is higher and the distance between dams must be shortened.<ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' /> Check dams, depending on the material used, can have a limited life span but if implemented correctly can be considered permanent though not encouraged.<ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' />

== Maintenance ==
Check dams require regular maintenance as they are used primarily as a temporary structure and thereby are not designed to withstand long-term use.  Dams should be inspected every week that it is sited in the channel and after every large storm.<ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' /> It is important that rubble, litter, and leaves are removed from the upstream side of the dam.<ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"'>{{cite web|last1=United States Environmental Protection Agency|title=Water Best Management Practices: Check Dams|url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Check-Dams.cfm|website=water.epa.gov|publisher=USEPA|accessdate=28 October 2014|date=2014-08-06}}</ref> This is typically done when the sediment has reached a height of one-half the original height of the dam.<ref name='USEPA, "Water BMP: Check Dams"' />

Further, maintenance is required when removing the check dam altogether.  In order to ensure the future flow is not adversely altered, the check dam must be fully removed, including any parts that may have been dislodged and washed downstream or any newly developed bare spots where the check dam once was situated.<ref name='Iowa SUDAS, "Design Manual"' />
