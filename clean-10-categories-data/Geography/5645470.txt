{{short description|The development of cartography, or mapmaking technology}}
{{Lead too short|date=July 2017}}

The '''history of cartography''' traces the development of [[cartography]], or mapmaking technology, in human history. Maps have been one of the most important human inventions for millennia, allowing humans to explain and navigate their way through the world. The earliest surviving maps include [[cave painting]]s and etchings on tusk and stone, followed by extensive maps produced by ancient [[Babylon]], [[Greece]] and [[Rome]], [[China]], and [[India]]. In their most simple form maps are two dimensional constructs, however since the age of [[Classical Greece]] maps have also been projected onto a three-dimensional sphere known as a [[globe]]. The [[Mercator Projection]], developed by Flemish geographer [[Gerardus Mercator]], was widely used as the standard two-dimensional projection of the earth for world maps until the late 20th century, when more accurate projections were formulated. Mercator was also the first to use and popularise the concept of the [[atlas]] as a collection of maps.<ref>Van der Krogt, Peter (2015), 'Chapter 6: Gerhard Mercator and his Cosmography: How the 'Atlas' became an Atlas,'; in: Gerhard Holzer, et al. (eds.), A World of Innovation: Cartography in the Time of Gerhard Mercator. (Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2015), pp. 112–130</ref>

Modern methods of transportation, the use of [[surveillance aircraft]], and more recently the availability of [[satellite imagery]] have made documentation of many areas possible that were previously inaccessible. Free online services such as [[Google Earth]] have made accurate maps of the world more accessible than ever before.

In contrast, the [[Babylonian World Map]], the earliest surviving map of the world (c. 600 BC), is a symbolic, not a literal representation. It deliberately omits peoples such as the [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Egyptians]], who were well known to the Babylonians. The area shown is depicted as a circular shape surrounded by water, which fits the religious image of the world in which the Babylonians believed.

[[File:Netert Mudat Scarab Map Face.jpg|thumb|[[Netert Mudat Egyptian Scarab Map]]. The oldest-known Map of the Nile River and Ancient Egypt. (1782–1570 BCE)]]Examples of maps from [[ancient Egypt]] are quite rare. However, those that have survived show an emphasis on geometry and well-developed surveying techniques, perhaps stimulated by the need to re-establish the exact boundaries of properties after the annual Nile floods. The [[Turin Papyrus Map]], dated c. 1160 BC, shows the mountains east of the Nile where gold and silver were mined, along with the location of the miners' shelters, wells, and the road network that linked the region with the mainland. Its originality can be seen in the map's inscriptions, its precise orientation, and the use of color.

[[Phoenicia]]n sailors made major advances in seafaring and exploration. The first [[circumnavigation]] of [[Africa]] was undertaken by Phoenician explorers employed by Egyptian [[pharaoh]] [[Necho II]] c.&nbsp;610–595&nbsp;BC.<ref name="Friis">{{cite book|last=Friis|first=Herman Ralph|title=The Pacific Basin: A History of Its Geographical Exploration|date=1967|publisher=[[American Geographical Society]]|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=veuwAAAAIAAJ}}</ref><ref name="Panchenko">{{cite book |last1=Panchenko |first1=Dmitri |chapter=Parmenides, the Nile and the Circumnavigation of Africa by the Phoenicians |title=Libyae lustrare extrema |date=2008 |publisher=[[University of Seville]] |isbn=9788447211562 |pages=189–194}}</ref> In ''The Histories'', written 431–425&nbsp;BC, [[Herodotus]] cast doubt on a report of the Sun observed shining from the north. He stated that the phenomenon was observed by Phoenician explorers during their circumnavigation of Africa ([[s:History of Herodotus/Book 4|''The Histories'']], 4.42) who claimed to have had the Sun on their right when circumnavigating in a clockwise direction. To modern historians, these details confirm the truth of the Phoenicians' report, and even suggest the possibility that the Phoenicians knew about the [[spherical Earth]] model. However, nothing certain about their knowledge of geography and navigation has survived.<ref name="Friis"/> The historian Dmitri Panchenko theorizes that it was the Phoenician circumnavigation of Africa that inspired the theory of a spherical Earth by the 5th century BC.<ref name="Panchenko"/>

==Ancient Greece==
In reviewing the literature of early geography and early conceptions of the earth, all sources lead to [[Homer]], who is considered by many ([[Strabo]], Kish, and [[Oswald A. W. Dilke|Dilke]]) as the founding father of Geography. Regardless of the doubts about Homer's existence, one thing is certain: he never was a mapmaker.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The depiction of the Earth conceived by [[Homer]], which was accepted by the early [[Greeks]], represents a circular flat disk surrounded by a constantly moving [[Oceanus|stream of Ocean]],<ref name = brown>Brown{{full citation needed|date = June 2015}}</ref>{{rp|22}} an idea which would be suggested by the appearance of the horizon as it is seen from a mountaintop or from a seacoast. Homer's knowledge of the Earth was very limited. He and his Greek contemporaries knew very little of the Earth beyond [[Egypt]] as far south as the Libyan desert, the south-west coast of [[Asia Minor]], and the northern boundary of the Greek homeland. Furthermore, the coast of the Black Sea was only known through myths and legends that circulated during his time. In his poems there is no mention of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] as geographical concepts.<ref>Thompson, 21</ref>{{full citation needed|date = June 2015}} That is why the big part of Homer's world that is portrayed on this interpretive map represents lands that border on the [[Aegean Sea]]. It is worth noting that even though Greeks believed that they were in the middle of the earth, they also thought that the edges of the world's disk were inhabited by savage, monstrous [[barbarians]] and strange animals and monsters; Homer's Odyssey mentions a great many of them.

Additional statements about ancient geography may be found in [[Hesiod]]'s poems, probably written during the 8th century BC.<ref>Kirsh, 1{{full citation needed|date = June 2015}}</ref> Through the lyrics of  ''[[Works and Days]]'' and ''[[Theogony]]'' he shows to his contemporaries some definite geographical knowledge. He introduces the names of such rivers as [[Nile]], [[Danube|Ister]] ([[Danube]]), the shores of the [[Bosporus]], and the [[Euxine]] ([[Black Sea]]), the coast of [[Gaul]], the island of [[Sicily]], and a few other regions and rivers.<ref>Keane, 6–7{{full citation needed|date = June 2015}}</ref> His advanced geographical knowledge not only had predated Greek colonial expansions, but also was used in the earliest Greek world maps, produced by Greek mapmakers such as [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus]], and [[Ptolemy]] using both observations by explorers and a mathematical approach.

Early steps in the development of intellectual thought in [[ancient Greece]] belonged to [[Ionians]] from their well-known city of [[Miletus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Miletus was placed favourably to absorb aspects of [[Babylonia]]n knowledge and to profit from the expanding commerce of the [[Mediterranean]]. The earliest ancient Greek who is said to have constructed a map of the world is Anaximander of Miletus (c. 611–546 BC), pupil of [[Thales]]. He believed that the earth was a cylindrical form, like a stone pillar and suspended in space.<ref>{{cite web|title=henry-davis-image|url=http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/Ancientimages/106A.GIF|website = Henry Davis Consulting}}</ref> The inhabited part of his world was circular, disk-shaped, and presumably located on the upper surface of the cylinder.<ref name = brown/>{{rp|24}}

Anaximander was the first ancient Greek to draw a map of the known world. It is for this reason that he is considered by many to be the first mapmaker.<ref name = dilke>Dilke{{full citation needed|date = June 2015}}</ref>{{rp|23}} A scarcity of archaeological and written evidence prevents us from giving any assessment of his map. What we may presume is that he portrayed land and sea in a map form. Unfortunately, any definite geographical knowledge that he included in his map is lost as well.  Although the map has not survived, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] (550–475 BC) produced another map fifty years later that he claimed was an improved version of the map of his illustrious predecessor.
[[File:Hekateaus7m.jpg|thumb|upright|The world according to [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hekatæus]], 500 BC]]

Hecatæus's map describes the earth as a circular plate with an encircling Ocean and Greece in the centre of the world. This was a very popular contemporary Greek worldview, derived originally from the Homeric poems. Also, similar to many other early maps in antiquity his map has no scale. As units of measurements, this map used "days of sailing" on the sea and "days of marching" on dry land.<ref>Goode, 2{{full citation needed|date = June 2015}}</ref> The purpose of this map was to accompany Hecatæus's geographical work that was called ''[[Periodos Ges]]'', or '' Journey Round the World''.<ref name = dilke/>{{rp|24}} ''Periodos Ges'' was divided into two books, "Europe" and "Asia", with the latter including Libya, the name of which was an ancient term for all of the known Africa.

The work follows the assumption of the author that the world was divided into two continents, Asia and Europe. He depicts the line between the Pillars of Hercules through the Bosporus, and the Don River as a boundary between the two. Hecatæus is the first known writer who thought that the Caspian flows into the circumference ocean—an idea that persisted long into the Hellenic period. He was particularly informative on the Black Sea, adding many geographic places that already were known to Greeks through the colonization process. To the north of the Danube, according to Hecatæus, were the Rhipæan (gusty) Mountains, beyond which lived the Hyperboreans—peoples of the far north.
Hecatæus depicted the origin of the Nile River at the southern circumference ocean. His view of the Nile seems to have been that it came from the southern circumference ocean. This assumption helped Hecatæus solve the mystery of the annual flooding of the Nile. He believed that the waves of the ocean were a primary cause of this occurrence.<ref>Tozer, 63{{full citation needed|date = June 2015}}</ref> It is worth mentioning that a similar map based upon one designed by Hecataeus was intended to aid political decision-making. According to [[Herodotus]], it was engraved upon a bronze tablet and was carried to Sparta by Aristagoras during the revolt of the Ionian cities against [[Persian Empire|Persian]] rule from 499 to 494 BC.

[[File:Anaximenes 500BC1.jpg|thumb|The world according to [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], c. 500 BC]]
[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] of Miletus (6th century BC), who studied under Anaximander, rejected the views of his teacher regarding the shape of the earth and instead, he visualized the earth as a rectangular form supported by compressed air.

[[Pythagoras]] of Samos (c. 560–480 BC) speculated about the notion of a spherical earth with a central fire at its core. He is sometimes incorrectly credited with the introduction of a model that divides a spherical earth into five zones: one hot, two temperate, and two cold—northern and southern. This idea, known as the zonal theory of climate, is more likely to have originated at the time of [[Aristotle]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stallard|first=Avan Judd|title=Origins of the Idea of Antipodes: Errors, Assumptions, and a Bare Few Facts|journal=Terrae Incognitae|volume=42|issue=1|pages=34–51|doi=10.1179/008228810x12755564743525|year=2013|s2cid=129758198}}</ref>

[[Scylax]], a sailor, made a record of his [[Mediterranean]] voyages in c. 515 BC. This is the earliest known set of Greek [[periploi]], or sailing instructions, which became the basis for many future mapmakers, especially in the medieval period.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url = http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/EMwebpages/219mono.html|title = Slide #219: World Maps of al-Idrisi|website = Henry Davis Consulting}}</ref>

The way in which the geographical knowledge of the Greeks advanced from the previous assumptions of the Earth's shape was through Herodotus and his conceptual view of the world. This map also did not survive and many have speculated that it was never produced. A possible reconstruction of his map is displayed below.

[[File:Herodotus5m1.jpg|thumb|The world according to [[Herodotus]], 440 BC]]

Herodotus traveled very extensively, collecting information and documenting his findings in his books on Europe, Asia, and Libya. He also combined his knowledge with what he learned from the people he met. Herodotus wrote his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' in the mid-5th century BC. Although his work was dedicated to the story of long struggle of the Greeks with the Persian Empire, Herodotus also included everything he knew about the geography, history, and peoples of the world. Thus, his work provides a detailed picture of the known world of the 5th century BC.

Herodotus rejected the prevailing view of most 5th-century BC maps that the earth is a circular plate surrounded by Ocean. In his work he describes the earth as an irregular shape with oceans surrounding only Asia and Africa. He introduces names such as the Atlantic Sea, and the [[Red Sea|Erythrean Sea]] (which translates as the Red Sea). He also divided the world into three continents: Europe, Asia, and Africa. He depicted the boundary of Europe as the line from the [[Pillars of Hercules]] through the [[Bosphorus]] and the area between the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Indus River]]. He regarded the [[Nile]] as the boundary between Asia and Africa. He speculated that the extent of Europe was much greater than was assumed at the time and left Europe's shape to be determined by future research.

In the case of Africa, he believed that, except for the small stretch of land in the vicinity of Suez, the continent was in fact surrounded by water. However, he definitely disagreed with his predecessors and contemporaries about its presumed circular shape. He based his theory on the story of Pharaoh [[Necho II]], the ruler of Egypt between 609 and 594 BC, who had sent [[Phoenicians]] to circumnavigate Africa. Apparently, it took them three years, but they certainly did prove his idea. He speculated that the Nile River started as far west as the [[Danube|Ister River]] (Danube) in Europe and cut Africa through the middle. He was the first writer to assume that the Caspian Sea was separated from other seas and he recognised northern Scythia as one of the coldest inhabited lands in the world.

Similar to his predecessors, Herodotus also made mistakes. He accepted a clear distinction between the civilized Greeks in the centre of the earth and the barbarians on the world's edges. In his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' we can see very clearly that he believed that the world became stranger and stranger when one traveled away from Greece, until one reached the ends of the earth, where humans behaved as savages.

While various previous Greek philosophers presumed the earth to be spherical, [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) is credited with proving the Earth's sphericity. His arguments may be summarized as follows:
* The [[lunar eclipse]] is always circular
* Ships seem to sink as they move away from view and pass the horizon
* Some stars can be seen only from certain parts of the Earth.

==Hellenistic Mediterranean==
A vital contribution to mapping the reality of the world came with a scientific estimate of the circumference of the earth. This event has been described as the first scientific attempt to give geographical studies a mathematical basis. The man credited for this achievement was [[Eratosthenes]] (275–195 BC), a Greek scholar who lived in [[Hellenistic]] [[North Africa]]. As described by [[George Sarton]], historian of science, "there was among them [Eratosthenes's contemporaries] a man of genius but as he was working in a new field they were too stupid to recognize him".<ref>Noble, 27{{full citation needed|date = June 2015}}</ref> His work, including ''On the Measurement of the Earth'' and ''[[Geographica]]'', has only survived in the writings of later philosophers such as [[Cleomedes]] and [[Strabo]]. He was a devoted geographer who set out to reform and perfect the map of the world. Eratosthenes argued that accurate mapping, even if in two dimensions only, depends upon the establishment of accurate linear measurements. He was the first to calculate the [[Earth's circumference]] (within 0.5 percent accuracy).<ref name="russo273277">{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Lucio |author-link=Lucio Russo |date=2004 |title=The Forgotten Revolution |url=https://archive.org/details/forgottenrevolut00russ_217 |url-access=limited |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer|page=[https://archive.org/details/forgottenrevolut00russ_217/page/n277 273]–277}}</ref> His great achievement in the field of cartography was the use of a new technique of charting with [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]], his imaginary north–south lines, and [[Circle of latitude|parallels]], his imaginary west–east lines.<ref>{{cite web|title=henry davis-ancient images|url=http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/Ancientimages/112B.jpg|website = Henry Davis Consulting}}</ref> These axis lines were placed over the map of the earth with their origin in the city of Rhodes and divided the world into sectors. Then, Eratosthenes used these earth partitions to reference places on the map. He also divided Earth into five climatic regions which was proposed at least as early as the late sixth or early fifth century BC by [[Parmenides]]: a torrid zone across the middle, two frigid zones at extreme north and south, and two temperate bands in between.<ref name="CicéronCicero1995">{{cite book|author1=Cicéron|author2=Marcus Tullius Cicero|title=Cicero De Re Publica|url=https://archive.org/details/derepublicaselec0000cice|url-access=registration|date=6 April 1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-34896-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/derepublicaselec0000cice/page/244 244]–}}</ref> He was likely also the first person to use the word "[[geography]]".<ref name="Eratosthenes2010">{{cite book|author=Eratosthenes|title=Eratosthenes' Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Sx2b3MsgdAC&pg=PA111|date=4 January 2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-3221-7|pages=111–}}</ref>

==Roman Empire==
===Pomponius Mela===
[[File:Karte Pomponius Mela rotated.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of [[Pomponius Mela]]'s world map.]]

[[Pomponius Mela]] is unique among ancient geographers in that, after dividing the earth into five zones, of which two only were habitable, he asserts the existence of [[antichthones]], inhabiting the southern temperate zone inaccessible to the folk of the northern temperate regions from the unbearable heat of the intervening torrid belt. On the divisions and boundaries of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], he repeats Eratosthenes; like all classical geographers from [[Alexander the Great]] (except [[Ptolemy]]) he regards the [[Caspian Sea]] as an inlet of the Northern Ocean, corresponding to the [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Red Sea]] on the south.

===Marinus of Tyre===
{{Main|Marinus of Tyre}}

[[Marinus of Tyre]] was a [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] [[Phoenician people|Phoenician]] geographer and cartographer.<ref>“Notes on Ancient Times in Malaya” Roland Braddell. ''Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,'' Vol. 23, No. 3 (153)'' ''1947 (1950)'', ''p. 9''</ref> He founded mathematical geography and provided the underpinnings of [[Ptolemy]]'s influential ''[[Geographia]]''.

Marinus's geographical treatise is lost and known only from Ptolemy's remarks. He introduced improvements to the construction of maps and developed a system of nautical charts. His chief legacy is that he first assigned to each place a proper [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. His [[zero meridian]] ran through the westernmost land known to him, the [[Isles of the Blessed]] around the location of the [[Canary Islands|Canary]] or [[Cape Verde Islands]]. He used the parallel of [[Rhodes]] for measurements of latitude. Ptolemy mentions several revisions of Marinus's geographical work, which is often dated to AD&nbsp;114 although this is uncertain. Marinus estimated a length of 180,000&nbsp;[[stadion (unit)|stadia]] for the equator, roughly corresponding{{refn|For a value of a {{convert|185|m|disp=or|abbr=on|sp=us}} per [[stadion (unit)|stadion]].}} to a circumference of the Earth of 33,300&nbsp;km, about 17% less than the actual value.

He also carefully studied the works of his predecessors and the diaries of travelers. His maps were the first in the [[Roman Empire]] to show [[China]]. He also invented [[equirectangular projection]], which is still used in map creation today. A few of Marinus's opinions are reported by Ptolemy. Marinus was of the opinion that the [[Oceanus|World Ocean]] was separated into an eastern and a western part by the continents of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. He thought that the inhabited world stretched in latitude from [[Thule]] ([[Norway]]) to [[Agisymba]] (around the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]) and in longitude from the [[Isles of the Blessed]] (around the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]]) to Shera ([[China]]). Marinus also coined the term [[Antarctic]], referring to the opposite of the [[Arctic Circle]].

[[Ptolemy]] (90–168), a Hellenized [[Egyptians|Egyptian]],<ref name="Katz 184">{{quote|But what we really want to know is to what extent the Alexandrian mathematicians of the period from the first to the fifth centuries C.E. were Greek. Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted ... So should we assume that Ptolemy and Diophantus, Pappus and Hypatia were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities ... And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become "Hellenized", to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.|Victor J. Katz (1998). ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'', p. 184.

Ptolemy revolutionized the depiction of the spherical earth on a map by using [[perspective projection]], and suggested precise methods for fixing the position of geographic features on its surface using a [[coordinate system]] with [[Circle of latitude|parallels]] of [[latitude]] and [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]] of [[longitude]].<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref>{{cite web|title=Ptolemy's Map|url=http://geology.cwru.edu/~huwig/catalog/slides/769.G.2.jpg|website = Case Western Reserve University}}</ref>

Ptolemy's eight-volume atlas ''[[Geographia]]'' is a prototype of modern mapping and [[GIS]]. It included an index of place-names, with the latitude and longitude of each place to guide the search, scale, conventional signs with legends, and the practice of orienting maps so that north is at the top and east to the right of the map—an almost universal custom today.

Yet with all his important innovations, however, Ptolemy was not infallible. His most important error was a miscalculation of the circumference of the earth. He believed that [[Eurasia]] covered 180° of the globe, which convinced [[Christopher Columbus]] to sail across the Atlantic to look for a simpler and faster way to travel to India. Had Columbus known that the true figure was much greater, it is conceivable that he would never have set out on his momentous voyage.

===Earliest geographical writing===
In [[China]], the earliest known geographical Chinese writing dates back to the 5th century BC, during the beginning of the [[Warring States]] (481–221 BC).<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|500}} This was the ''[[Yu Gong]]'' or ''Tribute of Yu'' chapter of the ''Shu Jing'' or ''[[Book of Documents]]''. The book describes the traditional nine provinces, their kinds of soil, their characteristic products and economic goods, their tributary goods, their trades and vocations, their state revenues and agricultural systems, and the various rivers and lakes listed and placed accordingly.<ref name="needham">{{cite book|last1 = Needham|first1 = Joseph|author-link = Joseph Needham|date = 1959|chapter = Science and Civilisation in China|volume = 3|title = Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth|location = Cambridge, UK|publisher = Cambridge University Press|via = Taipei: Caves Books, 1986}}</ref>{{rp|500}} The nine provinces in the time of this geographical work were very small in size compared to their modern Chinese counterparts. The Yu Gong's descriptions pertain to areas of the [[Yellow River]], the lower valleys of the [[Yangtze|Yangzi]], with the plain between them and the [[Shandong Peninsula]], and to the west the most northern parts of the [[Wei River]] and the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]] were known (along with the southern parts of modern-day [[Shanxi]] province).<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|500}}

===Earliest known reference to a map (圖 tú)===
The oldest reference to a map in China comes from the 3rd century BC.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|534}} This was the event of 227 BC where [[Crown Prince Dan of Yan]] had his assassin [[Jing Ke]] visit the court of the ruler of the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]], who would become the first leader to unify China, [[Qin Shi Huang]] (r. 221–210 BC). Jing Ke was to present the ruler of Qin with a district map painted on a silk scroll, rolled up and held in a case where he hid his assassin's dagger.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|534}} Handing to him the map of the designated territory was the first diplomatic act of submitting that district to Qin rule.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|534}} Jing then tried and failed to kill him. From then on, maps were frequently mentioned in Chinese sources.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|535}}

===Han Dynasty===
[[File:Western Han Mawangdui Silk Map.JPG|thumb|An early [[Han Dynasty|Western Han Dynasty]] (202 BC  – 9 AD) [[silk]] map found in tomb 3 of [[Mawangdui|Mawangdui Han tombs site]], depicting the Kingdom of [[Changsha]] and Kingdom of [[Nanyue]] in southern China (note: the south direction is oriented at the top, north at the bottom).]]
The three Han Dynasty maps found at [[Mawangdui]] differ from the earlier Qin State maps. While the Qin maps place the [[cardinal direction]] of north at the top of the map, the Han maps are orientated with the southern direction at the top.<ref name="hsu"/>{{rp|93}} The Han maps are also more complex, since they cover a much larger area, employ a large number of well-designed map symbols, and include additional information on local military sites and the local population.<ref name="hsu"/>{{rp|93}} The Han maps also note measured distances between certain places, but a formal [[Grid reference|graduated scale and rectangular grid system]] for maps would not be used—or at least described in full—until the 3rd century (see [[Pei Xiu]] below).<ref name="hsu"/>{{rp|93–94}} Among the three maps found at Mawangdui was a small map representing the tomb area where it was found, a larger topographical map showing the Han's borders along the subordinate [[Changsha|Kingdom of Changsha]] and the [[Nanyue]] kingdom (of northern [[Vietnam]] and parts of modern [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]]), and a map which marks the positions of Han military garrisons that were employed in an [[Southward expansion of the Han Dynasty|attack against Nanyue]] in 181 BC.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Hansen|first1 = Valerie|date = 2000|title = The Open Empire: A History of China to 1600|location = New York, USA & London, UK|publisher = W.W.

An early text that mentioned maps was the ''[[Rites of Zhou]]''.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|534}} Although attributed to the era of the [[Zhou Dynasty]], its first recorded appearance was in the libraries of Prince Liu De (c. 130 BC), and was compiled and commented on by [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]] in the 1st century AD. It outlined the use of maps that were made for governmental provinces and districts, principalities, frontier boundaries, and even pinpointed locations of ores and minerals for [[mining]] facilities.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|534}} Upon the investiture of three of his sons as feudal princes in 117 BC, [[Emperor Wu of Han]] had maps of the entire empire submitted to him.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|536}}

From the 1st century AD onwards, official Chinese historical texts contained a geographical section (Diliji 地理纪), which was often an enormous compilation of changes in place-names and local administrative divisions controlled by the ruling dynasty, descriptions of mountain ranges, river systems, taxable products, etc.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|508}} From the 5th century BC ''[[Shu Jing]]'' forward, Chinese geographical writing provided more concrete information and less legendary element. This example can be seen in the 4th chapter of the ''[[Huainanzi]]'' (Book of the Master of Huainan), compiled under the editorship of Prince [[Liu An]] in 139 BC during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC–202 AD). The chapter gave general descriptions of [[topography]] in a systematic fashion, given visual aids by the use of maps (di tu) due to the efforts of Liu An and his associate Zuo Wu.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|507–508}} In [[Chang Chu]]'s ''Hua Yang Guo Chi'' (''Historical Geography of [[Szechuan]]'') of 347, not only rivers, trade routes, and various tribes were described, but it also wrote of a 'Ba June Tu Jing' ('Map of Szechuan'), which had been made much earlier in 150.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|517}}

Local mapmaking such as the one of [[Sichuan]] mentioned above, became a widespread tradition of Chinese geographical works by the 6th century, as noted in the bibliography of the ''Sui Shu''.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|518}} It is during this time of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] that the [[Liang Dynasty]] (502–557) cartographers also began carving maps into stone steles (alongside the maps already drawn and painted on paper and silk).<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|543}}

===Pei Xiu, the 'Ptolemy of China'===
In the year 267, [[Pei Xiu]] (224–271) was appointed as the Minister of Works by [[Emperor Wu of Jin]], the first emperor of the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]]. Pei is best known for his work in cartography. Although map making and use of the grid existed in China before him,<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|106–107}} he was the first to mention a [[Grid reference|plotted geometrical grid and graduated scale]] displayed on the surface of maps to gain greater accuracy in the estimated distance between different locations.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|538–540}} Pei outlined six principles that should be observed when creating maps, two of which included the rectangular grid and the graduated scale for measuring distance.<ref name = "needham"/>{{rp|539–540}} Western historians compare him to the Greek Ptolemy for his contributions in cartography.<ref name = "needham"/>{{rp|540}} However, Howard Nelson states that, although the accounts of earlier cartographic works by the inventor and official [[Zhang Heng]] (78–139) are somewhat vague and sketchy, there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the use of the rectangular grid reference from the maps of Zhang Heng.<ref name="nelson 359">{{cite journal|last1 = Nelson|first1 = Howard|title = Chinese Maps: An Exhibition at the British Library|journal = The China Quarterly|volume = 58|number = 58|date = 1974|pages = 357–362 |jstor=652406 |doi=10.1017/S0305741000011346}}</ref>{{rp|359}}

Later Chinese ideas about the quality of maps made during the Han Dynasty and before stem from the assessment given by Pei Xiu.<ref name="hsu"/>{{rp|96}} Pei Xiu noted that the extant Han maps at his disposal were of little use since they featured too many inaccuracies and exaggerations in measured distance between locations.<ref name="hsu"/>{{rp|96}} However, the Qin State maps and [[Mawangdui]] maps of the Han era were far superior in quality than those examined by Pei Xiu.<ref name="hsu"/>{{rp|96}} It was not until the 20th century that Pei Xiu's 3rd-century assessment of earlier maps' dismal quality would be overturned and disproven. The Qin and Han maps did have a degree of accuracy in scale and pinpointed location, but the major improvement in Pei Xiu's work and that of his contemporaries was expressing topographical [[elevation]] on maps.<ref name="hsu"/>{{rp|97}}

===Sui===
In the year 605, during the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581–618), the Commercial Commissioner [[Pei Ju]] (547–627) created a famous geometrically gridded map.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|543}} In 610 [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] ordered government officials from throughout the empire to document in [[gazetteer]]s the customs, products, and geographical features of their local areas and provinces, providing descriptive writing and drawing them all onto separate maps, which would be sent to the imperial secretariat in the capital city.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|518}}<ref name="hargett 1996 409 410">{{cite journal|last1 = Hargett|first1 = James M.|title = Song Dynasty Local Gazetteers and Their Place in The History of Difangzhi Writing|journal = Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume = 56|number = 2|date = 1996|pages = 405–442|doi=10.2307/2719404|jstor = 2719404}}</ref>{{rp|409–10}}

=== Tang ===
The [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) also had its fair share of cartographers, including the works of [[Xu Jingzong]] in 658, [[Wang Mingyuan]] in 661, and [[Wang Zhongsi]] in 747.<ref name="needham" />{{rp|543}} Arguably the greatest geographer and cartographer of the Tang period was [[Jia Dan]] (730–805), whom [[Emperor Dezong of Tang]] entrusted in 785 to complete a map of China with her recently former inland colonies of Central Asia, the massive and detailed work completed in 801, called the ''Hai Nei Hua Yi Tu'' (Map of both Chinese and Barbarian Peoples within the (Four) Seas).<ref name="needham" />{{rp|543}} The map was {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}} and {{convert|33|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|high}} in dimension, mapped out on a grid scale of {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} equaling 100 [[li (unit)]] (the Chinese equivalent of the mile/kilometer).<ref name="needham" />{{rp|543}} Jia Dan is also known for having described the [[Persian Gulf]] region with great detail, along with lighthouses that were erected at the mouth of the Persian Gulf by the medieval [[Iran]]ians in the [[Abbasid]] period (refer to article on [[Tang Dynasty]] for more).

During the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] ordered [[Lu Duosun]] in 971 to update and 're-write all the Tu Jing in the world', which would seem to be a daunting task for one individual, who was sent out throughout the provinces to collect texts and as much data as possible.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|518}} With the aid of [[Song Zhun]], the massive work was completed in 1010, with some 1566 chapters.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|518}} The later ''Song Shi'' historical text stated ([[Wade-Giles]] spelling):

{{cquote|Yuan Hsieh (d. +1220) was Director-General of governmental grain stores. In pursuance of his schemes for the relief of famines he issued orders that each pao (village) should prepare a map which would show the fields and mountains, the rivers and the roads in fullest detail. The maps of all the pao were joined together to make a map of the tu (larger district), and these in turn were joined with others to make a map of the hsiang and the hsien (still larger districts). If there was any trouble about the collection of taxes or the distribution of grain, or if the question of chasing robbers and bandits arose, the provincial officials could readily carry out their duties by the aid of the maps.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|518}}}}

Like the earlier Liang Dynasty stone-stele maps (mentioned above), there were large and intricately carved stone stele maps of the Song period. For example, the {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} squared stone stele map of an anonymous artist in 1137, following the grid scale of 100 li squared for each grid square.<ref name="needham"/>{{rp|Plate LXXXI}} What is truly remarkable about this map is the incredibly precise detail of coastal outlines and river systems in China (refer to Needham's Volume 3, Plate LXXXI for an image). The map shows 500 settlements and a dozen rivers in China, and extends as far as Korea and India. On the reverse, a copy of a more ancient map uses grid coordinates in a scale of 1:1,500,000 and shows the coastline of China with great accuracy.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url = http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~asia/CartographyPaper.html|title = Mapping China's World: Cultural Cartography in Late Imperial Times|first1 = Richard J.|last1 = Smith|date = October 28, 1996}}</ref>

==Islamic cartographic schools==

===Arab and Persian cartography===
{{Main|Geography in medieval Islam}}
[[File:Al Masudi's Map of the World.JPG|thumb|[[Al-Masudi]]'s world map (10th century)]]

In the Middle Ages, Muslim scholars continued and advanced on the mapmaking traditions of earlier cultures. Most used Ptolemy's methods; but they also took advantage of what explorers and merchants learned in their travels across the Muslim world, from Spain to India to Africa, and beyond in trade relationships with China, and Russia.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

An important influence in the development of [[cartography]] was the patronage of the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]], [[al-Ma'mun]], who reigned from 813 to 833. He commissioned several geographers to remeasure the distance on earth that corresponds to one degree of celestial meridian. Thus his patronage resulted in the refinement of the definition of the mile used by Arabs (''mīl'' in Arabic) in comparison to the ''stadion'' used by Greeks. These efforts also enabled Muslims to calculate the circumference of the earth. Al-Mamun also commanded the production of a large map of the world, which has not survived,<ref name = edson>Edson and Savage-Smith (2004){{full citation needed|date = June 2015}}</ref>{{rp|61–63}} though it is known that its map projection type was based on [[Marinus of Tyre]] rather than [[Ptolemy]].<ref name = kennedy>{{Cite book|editor1-last=Rashed|editor1-first=Roshdi|editor2-last=Morelon|editor2-first=Régis|year=1996|title=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science|volume=3|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-12410-2|first1 = Edward S.|last1 = Kennedy|chapter = Mathematical Geography|pages=185–201|title-link=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science}}</ref>{{rp|193}}

Also in the 9th century, the [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Persian mathematician]] and geographer, [[Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi]], employed [[spherical trigonometry]] and [[map projection]] methods in order to convert [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] to a different coordinate system centred on a specific point on the sphere, in this the [[Qibla]], the direction to [[Mecca]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mathematics and the Divine|url=https://archive.org/details/mathematicsdivin00koet_040|url-access=limited|first1=T.|last1 = Koetsier|first2=L.|last2 = Bergmans|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-444-50328-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/mathematicsdivin00koet_040/page/n183 169]}}</ref> [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] (973–1048) later developed ideas which are seen as an anticipation of the polar coordinate system.<ref>{{MacTutor|id=Al-Biruni|title=Abu Arrayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni}}</ref> Around 1025, he describes a polar equi-[[azimuthal equidistant projection]] of the [[celestial sphere]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first = David A.|last = King|date = 1996|title = Astronomy and Islamic society: Qibla, gnomics and timekeeping|editor-first = Roshdi|editor-last = Rashed|encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]]|volume = 1|pages = 128–184|publisher = [[Routledge]]|location = London, UK and New York, USA}}</ref>{{rp|153}} However, this type of projection had been used in ancient Egyptian star-maps and was not to be fully developed until the 15 and 16th centuries.<ref name = "Rankin"/>

In the early 10th century, [[Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi|Abū Zayd al-Balkhī]], originally from [[Balkh]], founded the "Balkhī school" of terrestrial mapping in [[Baghdad]]. The geographers of this school also wrote extensively of the peoples, products, and customs of areas in the Muslim world, with little interest in the non-Muslim realms.<ref name = edson/> The "Balkhī school", which included geographers such as [[Estakhri]], [[al-Muqaddasi]] and [[Ibn Hawqal]], produced world [[atlas]]es, each one featuring a [[world map]] and twenty regional maps.<ref name = kennedy/>{{rp|194}}

Suhrāb, a late 10th-century Muslim geographer, accompanied a book of geographical [[Coordinate system|coordinates]] with instructions for making a rectangular world map, with [[equirectangular projection]] or cylindrical equidistant projection.<ref name = edson/> The earliest surviving rectangular coordinate map is dated to the 13th century and is attributed to Hamdallah al-Mustaqfi al-[[Najm al-Dīn al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī|Qazwini]], who based it on the work of Suhrāb. The [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] parallel lines were separated by one degree intervals, and the map was limited to [[Southwest Asia]] and [[Central Asia]]. The earliest surviving world maps based on a rectangular coordinate grid are attributed to al-Mustawfi in the 14th or 15th century (who used invervals of ten degrees for the lines), and to [[Hafiz-i Abru]] (died 1430).<ref name = kennedy/>{{rp|200–01}}

[[Ibn Battuta]] (1304–1368?) wrote "Rihlah" (Travels) based on three decades of journeys, covering more than 120,000&nbsp;km through northern Africa, southern Europe, and much of Asia.

====Regional cartography====
Islamic regional cartography is usually categorized into three groups: that produced by the "[[Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi|Balkhī school]]", the type devised by [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], and the type that are uniquely foundin the ''Book of curiosities''.<ref name = edson/>

The maps by the Balkhī schools were defined by political, not longitudinal boundaries and covered only the Muslim world. In these maps the distances between various "stops" (cities or rivers) were equalized. The only shapes used in designs were verticals, horizontals, 90-degree angles, and arcs of circles; unnecessary geographical details were eliminated. This approach is similar to that used in [[Rapid transit|subway]] maps, most notable used in the "[[London Underground]] [[Tube Map]]" in 1931 by [[Harry Beck (graphic designer)|Harry Beck]].<ref name = edson/>{{rp|85–87}}

Al-Idrīsī defined his maps differently. He considered the extent of the known world to be 160° in longitude, and divided the region into ten parts, each 16° wide. In terms of latitude, he portioned the known world into seven 'climes', determined by the length of the longest day. In his maps, many dominant geographical features can be found.<ref name = edson/>

====''Book on the appearance of the Earth''====
[[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]]'s ''{{Transl|ar|Kitāb ṣūrat al-Arḍ}}'' ("Book on the appearance of the Earth") was completed in 833. It is a revised and completed version of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'', consisting of a list of 2402 coordinates of cities and other geographical features following a general introduction.<ref>{{MacTutor|class=HistTopics|id=Cartography|title=Cartography}}</ref>

Al-Khwārizmī, [[Al-Ma'mun]]'s most famous geographer, corrected Ptolemy's gross overestimate for the length of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]<ref name=kennedy/>{{rp|188}} (from the [[Canary Islands]] to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean); Ptolemy overestimated it at 63 degrees of [[longitude]], while al-Khwarizmi almost correctly estimated it at nearly 50 degrees of longitude. Al-Ma'mun's geographers "also depicted the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s as [[Ocean|open bodies of water]], not land-locked [[sea]]s as Ptolemy had done. "<ref name=Covington>{{Cite journal|first=Richard|last=Covington|journal=Saudi Aramco World, May–June 2007|year=2007|pages=17–21|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.third.dimension.htm|accessdate=2008-07-06|doi=10.1177/1367877907080149|title=Nation, identity and the fascination with forensic science in Sherlock Holmes and CSI|volume=10|issue=3|s2cid=145173935|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512022044/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.third.dimension.htm|archive-date=2008-05-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> Al-Khwarizmi thus set the [[Prime Meridian]] of the [[Old World]] at the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, 10–13 degrees to the east of [[Alexandria]] (the prime meridian previously set by Ptolemy) and 70 degrees to the west of [[Baghdad]]. Most medieval Muslim geographers continued to use al-Khwarizmi's prime meridian.<ref name=kennedy/>{{rp|188}} Other prime meridians used were set by [[Abū Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdānī]] and [[Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi]] at [[Ujjain]], a centre of [[Indian astronomy]], and by another anonymous writer at [[Basra]].<ref name = kennedy/>{{rp|189}}

====Al-Biruni====
[[Abu Rayhan al-Biruni]] (973–1048) gave an estimate of 6,339.6&nbsp;km for the [[Earth radius]], which is only 17.15&nbsp;km less than the modern value of 6,356.7523142&nbsp;km (WGS84 polar radius "b"). In contrast to his predecessors who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, Al-Biruni developed a new method of using [[trigonometric]] calculations based on the angle between a [[plain]] and [[mountain]] top which yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference and made it possible for it to be measured by a single person from a single location.<ref>Lenn Evan Goodman (1992), ''Avicenna'', p. 31, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-01929-X}}.</ref><ref name=Savizi>{{citation|title=Applicable Problems in History of Mathematics: Practical Examples for the Classroom|author=Behnaz Savizi|journal=Teaching Mathematics and Its Applications|volume=26|issue=1|year=2007|pages=45–50|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|doi=10.1093/teamat/hrl009}} ([[cf.]] {{cite web|title=Applicable Problems in History of Mathematics; Practical Examples for the Classroom|author=Behnaz Savizi|publisher=[[University of Exeter]]|url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PErnest/pome19/Savizi%20-%20Applicable%20Problems.doc|accessdate=2010-02-21}})</ref><ref name="Lumpkin"/> Al-Biruni's method's motivation was to avoid "walking across hot, dusty deserts" and the idea came to him when he was on top of a tall mountain in India (present day [[Pind Dadan Khan]], [[Pakistan]]).<ref name=Lumpkin/> From the top of the mountain, he sighted the [[Magnetic dip|dip angle]] which, along with the mountain's height (which he calculated beforehand), he applied to the [[law of sines]] formula.

Routledge, London and New York.</ref>

In his ''Codex Masudicus'' (1037), Al-Biruni theorized the existence of a landmass along the vast ocean between [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], or what is today known as the [[Americas]]. He deduced its existence on the basis of his accurate estimations of the [[Earth's circumference]] and [[Afro-Eurasia]]'s size, which he found spanned only two-fifths of the Earth's circumference, and his discovery of the concept of [[specific gravity]], from which he deduced that the geological processes that gave rise to [[Eurasia]] must've also given rise to lands in the vast ocean between Asia and Europe. He also theorized that the landmass must be inhabited by human beings, which he deduced from his knowledge of humans inhabiting the broad north-south band stretching from [[Russia]] to [[South India]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], theorizing that the landmass would most likely lie along the same band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/s-frederick-starr/so-who-did-discover-america|date= 12 December 2013|title=So, Who Did Discover America? {{!}} History Today|website=[[History Today]]|access-date=2018-07-06|first=S.

{{quote|The compilation of Edrisi marks an era in the [[history of science]].

==Era of modern cartography==
===Iberian cartography in the Age of Discovery===
{{Main|Iberian cartography, 1400–1600}}
In the [[Renaissance]], with the renewed interest in classical works, maps became more like surveys once again, while the discovery of the Americas by Europeans and the subsequent effort to control and divide those lands revived interest in scientific mapping methods. Peter Whitfield, the author of several books on the history of maps, credits European mapmaking as a factor in the global spread of western power: "Men in Seville, Amsterdam or London had access to knowledge of America, Brazil, or India, while the [[native peoples]] knew only their own immediate environment" (Whitfield). Jordan Branch and his advisor, [[Steven Weber (professor)|Steven Weber]], propose that the power of large kingdoms and nation states of later history are an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century advances in map-making technologies.<ref name="How Maps Made the World">{{cite news|title=How Maps Made the World |url=http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AID=1992 |newspaper=[[Wilson Quarterly]] |date=Summer 2011 |accessdate=28 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811005805/http://www.wilsonquarterly.com/article.cfm?AID=1992 |archive-date=August 11, 2011 }}</ref><ref name = branch>{{cite journal|title = Mapping the Sovereign State: Technology, Authority, and Systemic Change|first = Jordan|last = Branch|journal = [[International Organization]]|volume = 65|issue = 1|date = 2011|url = http://econpapers.repec.org/article/cupintorg/v_3a65_3ay_3a2011_3ai_3a01_3ap_3a1-36_5f00.htm|publisher= [[University of California, Berkeley]] |pages= 1–36 |doi= 10.1017/S0020818310000299 |accessdate=  March 5, 2012|doi-access = free}}</ref>

During the 15th and 16th centuries, Iberian powers ([[Spain in the Age of Discovery|Kingdom of Spain]] and [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Kingdom of Portugal]]) were at the vanguard of European overseas exploration, discovering and mapping the coasts of the [[Americas]], [[Africa]], and [[Asia]], in what became known as the [[Age of Discovery]] (also known as the [[Age of Exploration]]). [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] were magnets for the talent, science and technology from the [[Italian city-states]].

[[Portuguese discoveries|Portugal's methodical expeditions]] started in 1419 along [[West Africa]]'s coast under the sponsorship of [[Prince Henry the Navigator]], with [[Bartolomeu Dias]] reaching the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and entering the [[Indian Ocean]] in 1488. Ten years later, in 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] led the first fleet around Africa to [[India]], arriving in [[Calicut]] and starting a maritime route from Portugal to India. Soon, after [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] reaching [[Brazil]] (1500), explorations proceed to [[Southeast Asia]], having sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to [[Ming China]] and to [[Japan]] (1542).

[[File:1500 map by Juan de la Cosa.jpg|thumb|upright|World Map by [[Juan de la Cosa]] (1500), the first map showing the Americas.]]
In 1492, when a Spanish expedition headed by [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed west to find a new trade route to the [[Far East]] but inadvertently found the [[Americas]]. Columbus's first two voyages (1492–93) reached the [[Bahamas]] and various [[Caribbean islands]], including [[Hispaniola]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Cuba]]. The Spanish cartographer and explorer [[Juan de la Cosa]] sailed with Columbus. He created the first known cartographic representations showing both the Americas. The post-1492 era is known as the period of the [[Columbian Exchange]], a dramatically widespread exchange of animals, plants, culture, human populations (including slaves), communicable disease, and ideas between the American and Afro-Eurasian hemispheres following the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]] to the Americas.

The [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation]] was the first known voyage around the world in human history. It was a Spanish expedition that sailed from [[Seville]] in 1519 under the command of Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in search of a maritime path from the [[Americas]] to the [[East Asia]] across the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Following Magellan's death in Mactan ([[Philippines]]) in 1521, [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] took command of the expedition, sailing to [[Borneo]], the [[Spice Islands]] and back to Spain across the Indian Ocean, round the Cape of Good Hope and north along the west coast of [[Africa]]. They arrived in Spain three years after they left, in 1522.
* '''{{circa|lk=no|1485}}''': Portuguese cartographer [[Pedro Reinel]] made the oldest known signed Portuguese nautical chart.
* '''1492''': Cartographer [[Jorge de Aguiar]] made the oldest known signed and dated Portuguese nautical chart.
* '''1537''': Much of Portuguese mathematician and cosmographer [[Pedro Nunes]]' work related to [[navigation]]. He was the first to understand why a ship maintaining a steady [[course (navigation)|course]] would not travel along a [[great circle]], the shortest path between two points on Earth, but would instead follow a [[spiral]] course, called a [[loxodrome]]. These lines, also called [[rhumb line]]s, maintain a fixed angle with the [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]]. In other words, loxodromic curves are directly related to the construction of the Nunes [[Affine connection|connection]], also called navigator connection. In his ''Treatise in Defense of the Marine Chart '' (1537), Nunes argued that a [[nautical chart]] should have its [[Circle of latitude|parallels]] and meridians shown as straight lines. Yet he was unsure how to solve the problems that this caused, a situation that lasted until [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] developed the [[Map projection|projection]] bearing his name. The [[Mercator Projection]] is the system which is still used.

* '''1530''': [[Alonzo de Santa Cruz]], Spanish cartographer, produced the first map of magnetic variations from true north. He believed it would be of use in finding the correct longitude. Santa Cruz also designed new nautical instruments,<ref>''Alonso de Santa Cruz, cartógrafo y fabricante de instrumentos náuticos de la Casa de Contratación'', Mariano Cuesta Domingo, ''[[Revista Complutense de Historia de América]]'', Vol 30, pages 7–40, 2004.</ref> and was interested in navigational methods.

The Spanish [[Casa de Contratación|House of Trade]], founded 1504 in Seville, had a large contingent of cartographers, as Spain's overseas empire expanded. The master map or [[Padrón Real]] was mandated by the Spanish monarch in 1508 and updated subsequently as more information became available with each ship returning to Seville.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ursula S. |last=Lamb |title=The Spanish Cosmographic Juntas of the Sixteenth Century |journal=Terrae Incognitae |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=51–62 |year=1974 |doi=10.1179/tin.1974.6.1.51}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Germán |last=Latorre y Setien |title=Los geógrafos españoles del siglo XVI |journal=Boletín del Instituto de Estudios Americanistas |volume=1 |year=1913 |issue=2 |pages=29–51}}</ref><ref>"Early Spanish Cartography in the New World."

[[Diogo Ribeiro]], a Portuguese cartographer working for Spain, made what is considered the first scientific world map: the 1527 Padrón real.<ref>{{cite web|title =Slide #64: Carta Universal|website = Henry Davis Consulting|url = http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/Ren/Ren1/346mono}}</ref> The layout of the map (''Mapamundi'') is strongly influenced by the information obtained during the Magellan-[[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]] trip around the world. Diogo's map delineates very precisely the coasts of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. The map shows, for the first time, the real extension of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It also shows, for the first time, the [[North America]]n coast as a continuous one (probably influenced by the [[Esteban Gómez]]'s exploration in 1525). It also shows the demarcation of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].

Two prominent cosmographers (as mapmakers were then known) of the House of Trade were [[Alonso de Santa Cruz]] and Juan López de Velasco, who directed mapmaking under Philip II, without ever going to the New World. Their maps were based on information they received from returning navigators. Using repeatable principles that underpin mapmaking, their map making techniques could be employed anywhere.  Philip II sought extensive information about his overseas empire, both in written textual form and in the production of maps.<ref>Barbara Mundy, ''The Mapping of New Spain: Indigenous Cartography and the Maps of the Relaciones Geográficas''.

Notable representatives of the [[Netherlandish|Netherlandish school]] of cartography and geography (1500s–1600s) include: [[Franciscus Monachus]], [[Gemma Frisius]], [[Gaspard van der Heyden]], [[Gerard Mercator]], [[Abraham Ortelius]], [[Christophe Plantin]], [[Lucas Janszoon Waghenaer|Lucas Waghenaer]], [[Jacob van Deventer (cartographer)|Jacob van Deventer]], [[Willebrord Snellius|Willebrord Snell]], [[Hessel Gerritsz]], [[Petrus Plancius]], [[Jodocus Hondius]], [[Henricus Hondius II]], [[Hendrik Hondius I]], [[Willem Blaeu]], [[Joan Blaeu]], [[Johannes Janssonius]], [[Andreas Cellarius]], [[Gerard de Jode]], [[Cornelis de Jode]], [[Claes Visscher]], [[Nicolaes Visscher I]], [[Nicolaes Visscher II]], and [[Frederik de Wit]]. [[Leuven]], [[Antwerp]], and [[Amsterdam]] were the main centres of the Netherlandish school of cartography in its golden age (the 16th and 17th centuries, approximately 1570–1670s). The [[Golden Age of Dutch cartography]] (also known as the Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography) that was inaugurated in the [[Southern Netherlands]] (current Belgium; mainly in Leuven and Antwerp) by Mercator and Ortelius found its fullest expression during the seventeenth century with the production of monumental multi-volume [[world atlas]]es in the [[Dutch Republic]] (mainly in Amsterdam) by competing mapmaking firms such as Lucas Waghenaer, Joan Blaeu, [[Jan Janssonius]], [[Claes Janszoon Visscher]], and Frederik de Wit.<ref>Carhart, George S.: ''Frederick de Wit and the First Concise Reference Atlas''.

[[File:Mercator 1569.png|thumb|The 1569 [[Mercator 1569 world map|Mercator map of the world]].]]
[[Gerardus Mercator]], the German-Netherlandish<ref name=Mercator>See the discussion in [[Gerardus Mercator#The question of nationality]].</ref> cartographer and geographer with a vast output of wall maps, bound maps, globes and scientific instruments but his greatest legacy was the [[Mercator projection|mathematical projection]] he devised for his [[Mercator 1569 world map|1569 world map]].

The [[Mercator projection]] is an example of a [[Map projection#Cylindrical|cylindrical projection]] in which the [[meridian (geography)|meridians]] are straight and perpendicular to the [[circle of latitude|parallels]]. As a result, the map has a constant width and the parallels are stretched east–west as the poles are approached. Mercator's insight was to stretch the separation of the parallels in a way which exactly compensates for their increasing length, thus preserving shapes of small regions, albeit at the expense of global distortion. Such a [[conformal map|conformal]] map projection necessarily transforms [[rhumb line]]s, sailing courses of a constant bearing, into straight lines on the map thus greatly facilitating navigation. That this was Mercator's intention is clear from the title: ''Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata'' which translates as "New and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation". Although the projection's adoption was slow, by the end of the seventeenth century it was in use for naval charts throughout the world and remains so to the present day. Its later adoption as the all-purpose world map was an unfortunate step.<ref>See the discussion in [[Mercator projection#Uses]]</ref>

Mercator spent the last thirty years of his life working on a vast project, the ''Cosmographia'';<ref>See the discussion in [[Gerardus Mercator#Duisburg 1552–1594]]</ref> a description of the whole universe including the creation and a description of the topography, history and institutions of all countries.  The word ''[[atlas]]'' makes its first appearance in the title of the final volume:  "Atlas sive cosmographicae meditationes de fabrica mundi et fabricati figura".<ref>See the discussion in [[Gerardus Mercator#atlas1595]].</ref> This translates as ''Atlas OR cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created,'' thus providing Mercator's definition of the term ''atlas''. These volumes devote slightly less than one half of their pages to maps: Mercator did not use the term solely to describe a bound collection of maps. His choice of title was motivated by his respect for [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] "King of [[Mauretania]]"<ref>See the preface to the 1595 posthumous section of Mercator's atlas as translated in {{harvtxt|Sullivan|2000}}, pp34–38 (PDF pp103–108)</ref>

The modern systematic use of [[triangulation network]]s stems from the work of the Dutch mathematician [[Willebrord Snellius|Willebrord Snell]] (born Willebrord Snel van Royen), who in 1615 surveyed the distance from [[Alkmaar]] to [[Bergen op Zoom]], approximately 70 miles (110 kilometres), using a chain of quadrangles containing 33 triangles in all.<ref>Kirby, Richard Shelton et al.

The first printed [[atlas]] of [[nautical chart]]s (''De Spieghel der Zeevaerdt'' or ''The Mirror of Navigation'' / ''The Mariner's Mirror'') was produced by [[Lucas Janszoon Waghenaer]] in [[Leiden]] in 1584. This atlas was the first attempt to systematically codify [[nautical map]]s. This chart-book combined an atlas of nautical charts and sailing directions with instructions for navigation on the western and north-western coastal waters of Europe. It was the first of its kind in the history of maritime cartography, and was an immediate success. The English translation of Waghenaer's work was published in 1588 and became so popular that any volume of sea charts soon became known as a "[[waggoner (nautical)|waggoner]]" (an atlas book of engraved nautical charts with accompanying printed sailing directions), the Anglicized form of Waghenaer's surname.<ref>Struik, Dirk J.

The first depiction of these [[constellation]]s in a [[Celestial cartography|celestial atlas]] was in [[Bayer Family|Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603.

In 1660, German-born Dutch cartographer [[Andreas Cellarius]]' [[star atlas]] (''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]'') was published by [[Johannes Janssonius]] in Amsterdam.

[[File:Thevenot - Hollandia Nova detecta 1644.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|A typical map from the Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography. [[Australasia]] during the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s–1720s) including: [[New Guinea#History|Nova Guinea]] (New Guinea), [[New Holland (Australia)|Nova Hollandia]] ([[mainland Australia]]), [[Van Diemen's Land]] ([[Tasmania]]), and [[New Zealand place names|Nova Zeelandia]] (New Zealand).]]
The Dutch dominated the commercial cartography (corporate cartography) during the seventeenth century through the [[publicly traded companies]] (such as the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]]) and the competing [[privately held company|privately held]] map-making houses/[[firm]]s. In the book ''Capitalism and Cartography in the Dutch Golden Age'' (University of Chicago Press, 2015), Elizabeth A. Sutton explores the fascinating but previously neglected history of corporate (commercial) cartography during the [[Dutch Golden Age]], from ca. 1600 to 1650. Maps were used as propaganda tools for both the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) and the [[Dutch West India Company]] (WIC) in order to encourage the commodification of land and an overall capitalist agenda.

In the long run the competition between map-making firms Blaeu and Janssonius resulted in the publication of an '[[Atlas Maior]]' or 'Major Atlas'. In 1662 the Latin edition of [[Joan Blaeu]]'s ''Atlas Maior'' appeared in eleven volumes and with approximately 600 maps. In the years to come French and Dutch editions followed in twelve and nine volumes respectively. Purely judging from the number of maps in the ''[[Atlas Maior]]'', Blaeu had outdone his rival [[Johannes Janssonius]]. And also from a commercial point of view it was a huge success. Also due to the superior typography the ''Atlas Maior'' by Blaeu soon became a status symbol for rich citizens. Costing 350 guilders for a non-coloured and 450 guilders for a coloured version, the atlas was the most precious book of the 17th century. However, the ''Atlas Maior'' was also a turning point: after that time the role of Dutch cartography (and Netherlandish cartography in general) was finished. Janssonius died in 1664 while a great fire in 1672 destroyed one of Blaeu's print shops. In that fire a part of the copperplates went up in flames. Fairly soon afterwards Joan Blaeu died, in 1673. The almost 2,000 copperplates of Janssonius and Blaeu found their way to other publishers.

This is the type of projection used today by Google Earth.<ref name="Rankin">{{cite web|last = Rankin|first = Bill|date = 2006|url = http://www.radicalcartography.net/?projectionref|title = Projection Reference|website = Radical Cartography}}</ref>

The changes in the use of military maps was also part of the modern [[Military revolution]], which changed the need for information as the scale of conflict increases as well. This created a need for maps to help with "...&nbsp;consistency, regularity and uniformity in military conflict."<ref>{{cite journal|last = Black|first = Jeremy|title = A Revolution in Military Cartography?: Europe 1650–1815|journal = Journal of Military History|volume = 73|date = January 2009|pages = 49–68|doi=10.1353/jmh.0.0160|s2cid = 129574985}}</ref>

The final form of the [[equidistant conic projection]] was constructed by the French astronomer [[Joseph-Nicolas Delisle]] in 1745.<ref name="Rankin"/>

The Swiss mathematician [[Johann Lambert]] invented several hemispheric map projections. In 1772 he created the [[Lambert conformal conic projection|Lambert conformal conic]] and [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection]]s.<ref name="Rankin"/>

The [[Albers equal-area conic projection]] features no distortion along standard parallels. It was invented by [[Heinrich Albers]] in 1805.<ref name="Rankin"/><ref name="ConicProj">{{cite web|url = http://www.progonos.com/furuti/MapProj/Normal/ProjCon/projCon.html|title = Conic Projections|date = November 18, 2013|first = Carlos A.|last = Furuti}}</ref>

In 1715 [[Herman Moll]] published the [[Beaver Map]], one of the most famous early maps of North America, which he copied from a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]].

In 1763–1767 Captain [[James Cook]] mapped [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

In 1777 Colonel [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]] created a monumental four volume atlas of North America, ''[[Atlantic Neptune]]''.

In the [[United States]] in the 18th and 19th centuries, explorers mapped trails and army engineers surveyed government lands.  Two agencies were established to provide more detailed, large-scale mapping.  They were the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] and the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] (now the [[National Geodetic Survey]] under the [[NOAA|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association]]).

===19th-century developments===
[[File:Map of Mexico 1847.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|''"Mapa de los Estados Unidos de Méjico'' by John Distrunell, the 1847 map used during the negotiations of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] ending the [[Mexican–American War]].]]

During his travels in Spanish America (1799–1804) [[Alexander von Humboldt]] created the most accurate map of [[New Spain]] (now Mexico) to date. Published as part of his ''Essai politique sur le royaume de la Nouvelle-Espagne'' (1811) (''Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain''), Humboldt's ''Carte du Mexique'' (1804) was based on existing maps of Mexico, but with Humboldt's careful attention to latitude and longitude. Landing at the Pacific coast port of Acapulco in 1803, Humboldt did not leave the port area for Mexico City until he produced a map of the port; when leaving he drew a map of the east coast port of Veracruz, as well as a map of the central plateau of Mexico. Given royal authorization from the Spanish crown for his trip, crown officials in Mexico were eager to aid Humboldt's research. He had access to [[José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez]]'s ''Mapa del Arzobispado de México'' (1768), which he deemed "very bad", as well as the seventeenth-century map of greater Mexico City by savant Don [[Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora]].<ref>Magali M. Carrera, ''Traveling from New Spain to Mexico: Mapping Practices on Nineteenth-century Mexico''. Durham: Duke University Press 2011, pp. 74–75.</ref>

John Disturnell, a businessman and publisher of guidebooks and maps, published ''Mapa de los Estados Unidos de Méjico'', which was used in the negotiations between the U.S. and Mexico in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] (1848), following the [[Mexican–American War]], based on the 1822 map by U.S. cartographer [[Henry Schenck Tanner]].<ref>Carrera, ''Traveling from New Spain to Mexico'', pp. 104–105.</ref> This map has been described as showing U.S. [[Manifest Destiny]]; a copy of the map was offered for sale in 2016 for $65,000. Map making at that time was important for both Mexico and the United States.<ref>Paula Rebert, ''La Gran Línea: Mapping the United States-Mexico Boundary, 1849–1857''. Austin: University of Texas Press 2001.</ref>

The Greenwich [[prime meridian]] became the international standard reference for cartographers in 1884.

===20th-century developments===
During the 20th century, maps became more abundant due to improvements in printing and photography that made production cheaper and easier. Airplanes made it possible to photograph large areas at a time.

Two-Point Equidistant projection was first drawn up by [[Hans Maurer]] in 1919. In this projection the distance from any point on the map to either of the two regulating points is accurate.<ref name="Rankin" />

The [[loximuthal projection]] was constructed by [[Karl Siemon]] in 1935 and refined by [[Waldo Tobler]] in 1966.<ref name="Rankin"/>

Since the mid-1990s, the use of computers in map making has helped to store, sort, and arrange data for mapping in order to create map projections.<ref>

===Contemporary developments===

==== Software development ====
Nowadays map-making heavily relies on computer software to develop and provide a variety of services, a trend that already started at the end of the previous century. For instance, self-location, browser search of places, business, products, and area, and distance calculation. At the present time, computer-based software is dominated by big companies that offer their services to a worldwide public, such as [[Google Maps]], [[Apple Maps]], [[Bing Maps]], [[National Geographic Maps]], [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System (GIS)]], [[CartoDB]], [[Mapbox]], [[Waze]], etc. Many other state-based, regional and smaller initiatives, and companies offer their services. The [[list of online map services]] is quite long and is growing every day.

==== Historical map collections ====
{{see also | Historical geographic information system}}

Recent development also include the integration of ancient maps and modern scholar research combined with modern computer software to elaborate periodical history maps. Initiatives such as [[Euratlas|Euratlas History Maps]] (which covers the whole of Europe from the year 1 AD to the present), [[Centennia Historical Atlas]] (which covers Europe from the year 1000AD to the present), [[Geacron]], and many others who work in what is called [[historical cartography]]. These maps include evolution of countries, provinces and cities, wars and battles, the [[History of borders|history of border changes]], etc.

Today historical cartography is thriving. The specialization of map services is ever growing. New [[map projection]]s are still being developed, university map collections, such as [[Perry–Castañeda Library Map Collection]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], offer better and more diverse maps and map tools every day, making available for their students and the broad public ancient maps that in the past were difficult to find. [[David Rumsey Historical Map Collection]] is nowadays a worldwide known initiative.

==== Self-publishing tools and collaborative mapping ====
{{See also|Collaborative mapping}}
Never in the past there were many "edit-yourself" map tools and software available for non-specialist. Map blogs and self-publishing are common.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 2004, [[Steve Coast]] created [[OpenStreetMap]], a [[virtual community|collaborative project]] to create a [[free content|free]] editable [[map]] of the world. The creation and growth of OpenStreetMap has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable [[satellite navigation]] devices.<ref>{{cite news |title=Global Positioning Tech Inspires Do-It-Yourself Mapping Project |first=Mark |last=Anderson |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/10/061018-street-maps.html |newspaper=[[National Geographic News]] |date=18 October 2006 |accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/09/for-the-love-of-open-mapping-data/ |title=For the Love of Mapping Data |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |last=Lardinois |first=Frederic |date=9 August 2014 |accessdate=29 July 2017}}</ref>

==History of cartography's technological changes==

[[File:Vinne Thus Men Go Safely 1714 Cornell CUL PJM 1016 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A portrait of a mapmaker looking up intently from his charts and holding a caliper, 1714.]]
In cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were manually constructed with brushes and parchment and therefore varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of the [[compass]], [[printing press]], [[telescope]], [[sextant]], [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[Vernier scale|vernier]] allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to make accurate reproductions. [[Steven Weber (professor)|Professor Steven Weber]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], has advanced the hypothesis that the concept of the "[[nation state]]" is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century advances in map-making technologies.<ref name="How Maps Made the World"/><ref name="branch"/>

Advances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], have allowed for the creation of maps that have fine details, do not distort in shape and resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving which further shortened the time it takes to make and reproduce maps.

In the mid-to-late 20th century, advances in electronic technology have led to further revolution in cartography. Specifically [[computer hardware]] devices such as computer screens, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters along with visualization, image processing, spatial analysis and database software, have democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps, particularly with their ability to produce maps that show slightly different features, without engraving a new printing plate.  See also [[digital raster graphic]] and [[Web mapping#History of web mapping|History of web mapping]].

[[Aerial photography]] and [[satellite imagery]] have provided high-accuracy, high-throughput methods for mapping physical features over large areas, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, and topography.
