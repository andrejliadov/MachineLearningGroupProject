After Magellan was killed by Raja Lapu-Lapu off the [[Philippines]] on 27 April 1521, the circumnavigation was completed under the command of the Basque Spanish seafarer [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] who returned to [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], Spain, on 6 September 1522, after a journey of 3 years and 1 month.<ref>Kurlansky, Mark. 1999. ''The Basque History of the World''. Walker & Company, New York. {{ISBN|0-8027-1349-1}}, p. 63</ref> These men were the first to circumnavigate the globe in a single expedition.<ref>{{cite book|title=Empire of the Winds|last=Bowring|first=Philip|publisher=I B Tauris & Co.

* The survivors of [[García Jofre de Loaísa]]'s Spanish expedition 1525–1536 including [[Andrés de Urdaneta]]; westward from Spain. None of Loaísa's seven ships completed the voyage, but ''Santa María de la Victoria'' reached the [[Moluccas]] before being wrecked in a Portuguese attack. Successive chiefs of the expedition (Loaísa, Elcano, Salazar, Iñiguez, De la Torre) died during the voyages. Andrés de Urdaneta and other fellow men survived, reaching the [[Spice Islands]] in 1526, to be taken prisoner by the Portuguese. Urdaneta and a few of his men returned to Spain in 1536 aboard Portuguese ships via India, the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and Portugal, and completed the second world circumnavigation in history. One of the four survivors was Hans von Aachen, who was also one of the 18 survivors of Magellan's expedition, making him the first to circumnavigate the world twice.
