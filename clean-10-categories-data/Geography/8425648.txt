{{Short description|routing methodology for wireless networks}}

'''Geographic routing''' (also called '''georouting'''<ref name="Ruehrup"/> or '''position-based routing''') is a [[routing]] principle that relies on [[geographic position]] information. It is mainly proposed for [[wireless network]]s and based on the idea that the source sends a message to the geographic location of the destination instead of using the [[network address]]. In the area of [[packet radio]] networks, the idea of using position information for routing was first proposed in the 1980s<ref>

</ref> Geographic routing requires that each [[Node (networking)|node]] can determine its own location and that the source is aware of the location of the destination. With this information, a message can be routed to the destination without knowledge of the [[network topology]] or a prior route discovery.

==Approaches==
There are various approaches, such as single-path, multi-path and [[Flooding algorithm|flooding]]-based strategies (see<ref>

</ref> for a survey). Most single-path strategies rely on two techniques: '''greedy forwarding''' and '''face routing'''. Greedy forwarding tries to bring the message closer to the destination in each step using only local information. Thus, each node forwards the message to the neighbor that is most suitable from a local point of view. The most suitable neighbor can be the one who minimizes the distance to the destination in each step (Greedy). Alternatively, one can consider another notion of progress, namely the projected distance on the source-destination-line (MFR, NFP), or the minimum angle between neighbor and destination (Compass Routing). Not all of these strategies are loop-free, i.e. a message can circulate among nodes in a certain constellation. It is known that the basic greedy strategy and MFR are loop free, while NFP and Compass Routing are not.<ref>

Greedy forwarding can lead into a dead end, where there is no neighbor closer to the destination. Then, face routing helps to recover from that situation and find a path to another node, where greedy forwarding can be resumed. A recovery strategy such as face routing is necessary to assure that a message can be delivered to the destination. The combination of greedy forwarding and face routing was first proposed in 1999 under the name GFG (Greedy-Face-Greedy).<ref>

Face routing depends on a planar subgraph in general; however distributed planarization is difficult for real wireless sensor networks and does not scale well to 3D environments.

==Greedy embedding==
Although originally developed as a routing scheme that uses the physical positions of each node, geographic routing algorithms have also been applied to networks in which each node is associated with a point in a virtual space, unrelated to its physical position. The process of finding a set of virtual positions for the nodes of a network such that geographic routing using these positions is guaranteed to succeed is called [[greedy embedding]].<ref>{{citation
