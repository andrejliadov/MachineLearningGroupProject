The '''Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act''' ('''GPS Act''') was a [[Bill (law)|bill]] introduced in the [[U.S. Congress]] in 2011 that attempted to limit government surveillance using [[geolocation]] information such as signals from [[global positioning system|GPS]] systems in [[mobile device]]s. The bill was sponsored by Sen. [[Ron Wyden]] and Rep. [[Jason Chaffetz]].<ref name=wyden-press-release>{{cite web|last=Wyden|first=Ron|title=Wyden, Chaffetz Introduce GPS Act|url=http://wyden.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/?id=0b8d693f-7cab-4ba4-aae6-42b66b1eef0e|work=wyden.senate.gov |accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref> Since its initial proposal in June 2011, the GPS Act awaits consideration by the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] as well as the [[House of Representatives of the United States|House]].

According to its proponents, the GPS Act sets forth "a legal framework designed to give government agencies, commercial entities and private citizens clear guidelines for when and how geolocation information can be accessed and used."<ref name=wyden-press-release/> Advocates drafted the bill to address controversies surrounding  prior incidents in which police had attached [[GPS navigation device|GPS devices]] to suspects' vehicles without [[Warrant (law)|warrants]] and to set a legal precedent for such tracking in the future.<ref name=Pineda-Moreno-cnn>{{cite news |title=Court allows agents to secretly put GPS trackers on cars |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-08-27/justice/oregon.gps.surveillance_1_gps-device-appeals-chief-judge-alex-kozinski?_s=PM:CRIME |work=articles.cnn.com |publisher=CNN |accessdate=11 November 2011 |date=8 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106103145/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-08-27/justice/oregon.gps.surveillance_1_gps-device-appeals-chief-judge-alex-kozinski?_s=PM%3ACRIME |archivedate=6 November 2011 }}</ref><ref name=wired-busted>{{cite news|last=Zetter|first=Kim|title=Busted!

==History==
Current legislation surrounding the issue of tracking an individual's location has proven to be legally ambiguous and technically outdated. To date, primary precedent draws from the 1983 ruling of ''[[United States v. Knotts]]'' (1983) and the contentious [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] of 1986. In that case the court ruled that electronic "[[Pager|beepers]]" could be fairly used to track a suspect's vehicle without warrant, because the suspect in that case had willingly taken the device that was used to track them.<ref name="caselaw.lp.findlaw.com">{{Cite web | url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=460&invol=276 | title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions}}</ref> Justice [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]] delivered the majority opinion that the monitoring of such "beeper" devices did not invade any individual's "legitimate [[expectation of privacy]]". As a person traveling on public streets is visible to the naked eye, the practice was thus upheld as neither a "search" nor a "seizure" under [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] definitions.<ref name="caselaw.lp.findlaw.com"/>

=== ''United States v. Jones'' ===
{{main|United States v. Jones (2012)}}
One notable incident of warrantless [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] in 2005 led to ''[[United States v. Jones (2012)|United States v. Jones]]'', decided by the [[United States Supreme Court]]. In ''Jones'' the police obtained a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] to attach a GPS device to the underside of the defendant's car but then violated the warrant's scope in both geography and in length of time.

The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) defended the police's actions by contending that a warrant was unnecessary in the first place. It pointed to a two-decade precedent of warrantless GPS tracking. [[Roger L. Easton]], the principal inventor of modern GPS technology, filed an [[amicus brief]] urging the court to renounce the DOJ's proposal.<ref>https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/10/gps-inventor-surveillance/ Roger L. Easton Urges Court to Reject Warrantless Tracking</ref> In reply, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] argued that an individual has "no reasonable expectation of privacy" in his or her movements around public streets, and that legislation requiring certain standards for warrants would "severely impede" law enforcement officials in their work.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2011/04/gpspetition.pdf | work=Wired}}</ref>

During [[oral argument]], Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] suggested that legislatures could create restraints on law enforcement officers that would prevent such tracking.<ref name=bloomberg-gps-tracking />

The Supreme Court justices voted unanimously that the attachment of a GPS device on a vehicle and its monitoring, even on public streets, constituted a search under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. However, only four of the justices argued that the search violated reasonable expectations of privacy while the other five rested their conclusion on other grounds. The GPS Act would effectively endorse the minority's position and establish that geolocational searches are presumptively unreasonable.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Modern Government Tracking Techniques: Spying Through Cell-Phone GPS Locators Results in Disparate Effects on Minorities |journal=Rutgers Race and the Law Review |volume=15 |year=2014 |pages=A1–A50 |id={{ProQuest|1784174374}} }}</ref><ref name=Crampton2015>{{cite journal |last1=Crampton |first1=Jeremy W. |title=Collect it all: national security, Big Data and governance |journal=GeoJournal |date=August 2015 |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=519–531 |doi=10.1007/s10708-014-9598-y }}</ref> However, this ruling does not provide full protection from geolocational tracking methods, such as those used by telecommunication companies who reserve the right to collect geolocational information.<ref name=Crampton2015/>

== Contents ==
If passed, the GPS Act would require [[probable cause]] and an accompanying warrant before government agencies could obtain private geolocational information on an individual, either through a mobile device or by the placement of a tracking bug. Taking a strong stance on [[consumer rights]], the bill would further forbid private businesses from sharing customer location data without explicit consent of the individual. The bill would cover [[Real-time locating system|real-time tracking]] data as well as previously acquired historical location data.<ref name="wired.com">{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2011/06/GPS-Bill-Text.pdf | work=Wired}}</ref>

The bill has set forth certain exceptions under which the acquisition of private tracking data by private or public entities would not be unlawful:<ref name="wired.com"/>
* As a response to theft, and for the purpose of tracking [[Possession of stolen goods|stolen merchandise]]
* As a personal safety net for children, as set forth by a parent or legal guardian
* In the case of emergency, where the individual has either personally requested assistance or is in known peril
* When the tracking information in question has been publicly broadcast

==Reception==

=== Support ===
The bill was initially co-sponsored by [[Bob Goodlatte]] (R-VA), Chairman of the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet|House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition and the Internet]]. Since the bill's introduction, six other members of the House, as well as Senator [[Mark Kirk]] (R-IL). have signed on as co-sponsors.

The bill has also gained support from a variety of civil liberties organizations including the [[ACLU]], [[CCIA]], [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], [http://digitalliberty.net/ Digital Liberty Organization], and [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].<ref name=wyden-gps>{{cite web|last=Wyden|first=Ron|title=Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance ("GPS") Act|url=http://wyden.senate.gov/issues/issue/?id=b29a3450-f722-4571-96f0-83c8ededc332|accessdate=11 November 2011}}</ref>

Similar bills include one written by Senate Judiciary Chairman [[Patrick Leahy]] (D-VT), who aims to require a warrant to obtain GPS data from companies, and one by senators [[Al Franken]]  (D-MN) and [[Richard Blumenthal]] (D-CT), who would require device manufacturers to receive explicit consent from the end-user before tracking their location.<ref name=nat-journal-gps-court>{{cite web |last=Jerome |first=Sara |title=Supreme Court to Hear GPS Surveillance Case |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/supreme-court-to-hear-gps-surveillance-case-20111107 |work=nationaljournal.com |publisher=National Journal |accessdate=11 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116094020/http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/supreme-court-to-hear-gps-surveillance-case-20111107 |archivedate=16 January 2012 }}</ref>

In her concurrence in ''[[United States v. Antoine Jones|U.S. v Jones]]'', Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]] warned that the administration's defense of warrantless GPS tracking, if upheld, would allow federal agencies to track individuals through any cellular device, as law enforcement groups can also intercept signals the phones emit.<ref name=bloomberg-gps-tracking />

===Opposition===
The [[Obama Administration]] has expressed potential opposition to the GPS Act based on the belief that GPS tracking is no more invasive than visual surveillance.<ref name=bloomberg-gps-tracking>{{cite news|last=Stohr|first=Greg|title=Police Use of Global-Positioning Devices Questioned by U.S. Supreme Court|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-08/police-use-of-global-positioning-devices-questioned-by-u-s-supreme-court.html|work=bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=8 November 2011}}</ref>
