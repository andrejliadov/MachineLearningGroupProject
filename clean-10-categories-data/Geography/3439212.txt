'''Small Island Developing States''' ('''SIDS''') are a group of [[Developing country|developing countries]] that are small [[island countries]] which tend to share similar [[sustainable development]] challenges. These include small but growing populations, limited resources, remoteness, susceptibility to [[natural disaster]]s, vulnerability to external shocks, excessive dependence on [[international trade]], and fragile environments. Their growth and development is also held back by high communication, energy and transportation costs, irregular international transport volumes, disproportionately expensive public administration and [[infrastructure]] due to their small size, and little to no opportunity to create [[economies of scale]].

The SIDS were first recognized as a distinct group of developing countries at the [[Earth Summit (1992)|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in June 1992. The [[Barbados Programme of Action]] was produced in 1994 in order to assist the SIDS in their sustainable development efforts. The [[United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States]] (UN-OHRLLS) represents this group of states.

==Sustainability==

Many SIDS now understand the need to move towards low-carbon, [[Climate resilience|climate resilient]] economies, as set out in the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) implementation plan for climate change-resilient development. SIDS often rely heavily on imported fossil fuels, spending an ever-larger proportion of their GDP on energy imports.  Renewable technologies have the advantage of providing energy at a lower cost than fossil fuels and making SIDS more sustainable. [[Barbados]] has been successful in adopting the use of [[Solar water heating|solar water heaters]] (SWHs). A 2012 report published by the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]] showed that its SWH industry now boasts over 50,000 installations. These have saved consumers as much as US$137 million since the early 1970s. The report suggested that Barbados' experience could be easily replicated in other SIDS with high fossil fuel imports and abundant sunshine.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/resource/cdkn-inside-story-seizing-the-sunshine-barbados-thriving-solar-water-heater-industry/?loclang=en_gb ''Seizing the sunshine – Barbados’ thriving solar water heater industry''], [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 17 September 2012.</ref>

Additionally, the implementation of targets of the United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goal 14]] has the potential to increase economic benefits of marine resources to SIDS through aquaculture and sustainable tourism.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Goal 14 targets|url=https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-14-life-below-water/targets.html|access-date=2020-09-24|website=UNDP|language=en}}</ref>

== Climate change ==
SIDS are some of the regions most vulnerable to [[climate change]]. Due to their proximity to water, SIDS are especially vulnerable to the marine effects of climate change like [[sea level rise]], [[ocean acidification]], [[marine heatwave]]s, and the [[Tropical cyclones and climate change|increase in cyclone intensity]]. Changing precipitation patterns could also cause [[drought]]s. Many citizens of SIDS live near a coastline, meaning that they have a high risk exposure to the effects of marine climate change. Additional climate change vulnerability comes through their economies: many SIDS have economies that are based on natural resources, such as ecotourism, fishing, or agriculture. Phenomena like sea level rise, [[coastal erosion]], and severe storms have the potential to severely impact their economies.<ref name="Thomas">{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Adelle|last2=Baptiste|first2=April|last3=Martyr-Koller|first3=Rosanne|last4=Pringle|first4=Patrick|last5=Rhiney|first5=Kevon|date=2020-10-17|title=Climate Change and Small Island Developing States|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-environ-012320-083355|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|language=en|volume=45|issue=1|pages=1–27|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-012320-083355|issn=1543-5938|doi-access=free}}</ref> 

SIDS may also have reduced financial and [[human capital]] to mitigate climate change risk, as many rely on international aid to cope with disasters like severe storms. Worldwide, climate change is projected to have an average annual loss of 0.5% [[GDP]] by 2030; in Pacific SIDS, it will be 0.75&ndash;6.5% GDP by 2030. Caribbean SIDS will have average annual losses of 5% by 2025, escalating to 20% by 2100 in projections without regional mitigation strategies.<ref name="Thomas" />

== List of SIDS ==
As of 2020, the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] lists 58 small island developing states. These are broken down into three geographic regions: the [[Caribbean]];<ref>{{cite web|title=The Caribbean|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1522|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref>  the [[Pacific]];<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pacific|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1523|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref> and [[Africa]], [[Indian Ocean]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[South China Sea]] (AIMS).,<ref>{{cite web|title=The AIMS|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1521|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref> including Associate Members of the Regional Commissions. Each of these regions has a regional cooperation body: the [[Caribbean Community]], the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] and the [[Indian Ocean Commission]] respectively, which many SIDS are members or associate members of. In addition, most (but not all) SIDS are members of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), which performs lobbying and negotiating functions for the SIDS within the [[United Nations]] system. The [[UNCTAD]] website states that "the UN never established criteria to determine an official list of SIDS" but UNCTAD maintains a shorter, unofficial list on its website for analytical purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNCTAD´s unofficial list of SIDS|url=http://unctad.org/en/pages/aldc/Small%20Island%20Developing%20States/UNCTAD%C2%B4s-unofficial-list-of-SIDS.aspx|publisher=UNCTAD|access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref>
