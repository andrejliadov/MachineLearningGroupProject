'''Henricus Martellus Germanus''' is the [[latinized name]] of '''Heinrich Hammer''' ({{lang-it|Enrico Martello}}), a [[Geography|geographer]] and [[cartographer]] from [[Nuremberg]] who lived and worked in [[Florence]] from 1480 to 1496.

Between around 1489 and 1491, he produced at least one world map which is remarkably similar to the terrestrial [[globe]] produced by [[Martin Behaim]] around 1492, the ''[[Erdapfel]]''. Both show novel adaptions of the existing [[Ptolemy's Geography|Ptolemaic]] model, opening a passage south of Africa and creating [[Dragon's Tail (peninsula)|an enormous new peninsula]] east of the [[Golden Chersonese]] ([[Malay Peninsula|Malaysia]]). Both possibly derive from maps created around 1485 in Lisbon by [[Bartolomeo Columbus]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The only extant manuscript world map, measuring {{convert|201|x|122|cm|in}} in size, was rediscovered in the 1960s<ref name="urbanus">{{cite journal|last1=Urbanus|first1=Jason|title=Reading the Invisible Ink|journal=Archaeology|date=Jan–Feb 2016|volume=69|issue=1|pages=9–10|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=75&sid=d022d3dd-d76c-4a0c-8bda-3d22c2e5033b%40sessionmgr103|accessdate=31 August 2017|format=PDF|issn=0003-8113|postscript={{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Master File Complete}}}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and donated to [[Yale University|Yale]]'s [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]].<ref name="hammer">{{cite web|last1=Hammer|first1=Heinrich|title=Map of the world of Christopher Columbus|url=http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/3435243?image_id=1040214|website=Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=31 August 2017}}; Chet Van Duzer, ''Henricus Martellus’s World Map at Yale (c. 1491): Multispectral Imaging, Sources, and Influence,'' Berlin, Springer International Publishing, 2018.</ref> An inscription in the lower left corner states: "Although Strabo and Ptolemy and the majority of the ancients were most assiduous in describing the world we, however, bring together in this picture and carefully show in their true places the new knowledge that escaped their diligence and remained unknown to them".<ref>ETSI STRABO AC PTOLEMEUS ET PLERIQUE VETERUM DESCRIBENDI ORBIS FUERE STUDIOSISSIMI NOVORUM TAMEN DILIGENTIA QUEDAM AB EIS TANQUAM INCOGNITA PRETERMISSA ADINVENIT QUE NOS HOC PICTURE AD VERAM LOCORUM SCIENTIAM EXPRIMENDAM STUDIOSE IUNXIMUS</ref>

A 2014 [[multispectral imaging]] project led by [[Chet van Duzer]] revealed many previously-illegible details of the map, including a depiction of a [[porcupine]] in northern Asia, references to mythological peoples such as the [[Hippopodes]] and the [[Panotti]], and a surprising amount of information about the interior of Africa- knowledge that likely originated with the [[Council of Florence#Copts and Ethiopians|Ethiopian delegation]] to the 1441 [[Council of Florence]] <ref>{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Greg |title=A 500-year-old map used by Columbus reveals its secrets |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2018/10/columbus-map-discovery-secrets-new-world/ |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=26 August 2019}}</ref>

Martellus’ map served as an inspiration for the [[Waldseemüller map]] of 1507. The overall layout was similar, and [[Martin Waldseemüller]] used the same projection as Martellus, the pseudo-cordiform projection. Both cartographers added decorative wind-heads in the borders of their maps, and both also took advantage of the extra space in the lower corners of the maps created by the swooping lines of the projection to add text blocks in those corners. The shape of northern Africa is the same on both maps, that is, it is Ptolemaic with a sharp northwestern corner. The shape of eastern Asia is similar on the two maps, with a huge peninsula jutting southwestward into the Indian Ocean, and Japan is in precisely the same position on the two maps, at the eastern edge.<ref>Chet Van Duzer, “Waldseemüller's World Maps of 1507 and 1516: Sources and Development”, ''The Portolan,'' No.1, Winter 2012, p.12.</ref> 

Martellus also produced an ''Insularium Illustratum'' ("Illustrated Book of Islands") of which four manuscripts are extant, plus one draft in [[Biblioteca Laurentiana]]. It contains an illustrated description of islands of the [[Aegean Sea]], mostly copied from a previous work by [[Cristoforo Buondelmonti]], plus maps from other islands, several regional maps and a [[world map]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bouloux|first1=Nathalie|title=L'Insularium Illustratum d'Henricus Martellus|journal=The Historical Review / La Revue Historique|date=2012|volume=IX|pages=77–94|url=http://ejournals.epublishing.ekt.gr/index.php/historicalReview/article/view/4071/3857|accessdate=30 September 2016}}</ref>

He has been identified with an Arrigho di Federigho who authored the first translation into [[German (language)|German]] of Bocaccio's ''[[Decamerone]]''. According to this theory, the surname Martellus would come from the Martelli family, to which Henricus / Arrigho was linked.<ref>[http://www.hsozkult.de/publicationreview/id/rezbuecher-8568 Rezension von L.
