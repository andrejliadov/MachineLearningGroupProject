This article describes the process by which the territorial extent of [[metropolitan France]] came to be as it is since 1947. The territory of the French State is spread [[Overseas departments and territories of France|throughout the world]]. Metropolitan France is that part which is in Europe.

[[Francia|Occidental France]], which arose from the [[Treaty of Verdun]] of 843, remained stable for many years. The first kings, the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian]]s, were too much occupied with imposing their authority in their own realm to be expansionist. They deftly exploited dissent among their turbulent vassals, applying pressure on them and on the Church and towns. The great conflicts with the kings of England were important occasions for asserting royal power. The 13th century re-annexations of [[Normandy]] and of [[Languedoc]] to the French kingdom were two important stages in the unification of the kingdom.

France soon lost the [[County of Barcelona]], from the end of the 9th century. The crossing beyond Rhone, which for a long time remained the frontier, did not begin until the 14th century, with the purchase of the [[Dauphiné]]. [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] regained his inheritance of the two most powerful prerogatives granted to cadet branches of the dynasty: [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and [[Anjou]] including [[Provence]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (1481–1482).

The marriage of [[Anne of Brittany]] first with [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] then with [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] led finally to the effective annexation in 1532, of [[Duchy of Brittany|her duchy]] which was already within the ambit of the French Kingdom but which had hitherto firmly maintained its distinct existence.

From 1635 to 1748, [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] and [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] undertook an expansion of the frontiers of the kingdom towards the north and towards the Rhine. Their aim was to check the aspiration of the Austrian royal house towards its own predominance in Europe. The loss of [[French Flanders]] (1526) had brought the frontier dangerously close to the [[Paris|French capital]]. [[Alsace]], [[Artois]] and [[Franche-Comté]] were annexed between 1648 and 1697. The [[Duchy of Lorraine]] remained some time an enclave in the French kingdom before it too was incorporated in 1766. This and the purchase of Corsica in 1768 brought the territory of the kingdom into a consolidated block.

During the period of the French Revolution and [[First French Empire|First Empire]], France expanded temporarily on the left bank of the Rhine. The frontier in the north east lost its definition. On the whole, it remained stable from 1697 to 1789 when it became vague, following no particular line. It was re-established, more or less on its old line in 1815, by the [[Congress of Vienna]]. France did lose some places such as [[Landau]] and [[Saarlouis]]. These strategic losses and the construction of a powerful German state may be seen as giving rise to later diplomatic and military events. But even after the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice of 1918]], France was unable to make new territorial gains towards the north-east, into the [[Saarland]].

Subsequently, in the 19th century, there were only a few developments. The [[Duchy of Savoy]] and the [[County of Nice]] were definitively re-attached to France, by [[plebiscite]] in 1860. [[Alsace-Lorraine]] was annexed by Germany in 1871 but became French again in 1918.<ref>[[Image:Partage de l'Empire carolingien au Traité de Verdun en 843.JPG|thumb|right|30px|3 Francias]] Lorraine is the French name for [[Lotharingia]], it was that part of [[Carolingian Empire|Charlemagne's empire]] which was allocated to [[Middle Francia]]. Subsequent generations divided this again and again. France was the successor state of West Francia, while East Francia came to be represented by Germany. With the rise of the 19th century empires, the territory of Middle Francia became an article of contention between them. (For link to a map of the three Francias, see right of window.)</ref>

Other alterations were made temporarily, by the [[Nazi Germany|occupying power]], during the period of World War II.

==Geographical context==
Modern [[France|Metropolitan France]] lies to a large extent, within clear limits of [[physical geography]]. Roughly half of its margin lies on sea coasts. In the south-west, its border lies among the peaks of the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range. Similarly, in the south-east it lies in part of the [[Alps]]. In the East it follows one or another of the [[Jura mountains|Jura]] ranges until it reaches the River [[Rhine]], which it follows downstream. The remaining section, in the north-east, between the Rhine and the [[North Sea]], is provided with the least clear natural definition.

==The Middle Ages (843–1492): the unification of the kingdom==
===The boundaries between the kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire===
====The birth of France and Germany====
[[Image:Carolingian empire 843 888.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|France in the Carolingian Empire from 843 to 888]]
The [[Treaty of Verdun]] of 843 marked the appearance of France and Germany. The arrangement was seen as a temporary sharing out of the inheritance between the heirs of [[Charlemagne]]. It set a seal to the creation of the borders of two states each of which would have its own development. Their common frontier at that time, was placed approximately along the [[Saône]] and the [[Rhône]].

On the one side, the first Germanic monarchy would weaken itself in trying to re-establish the Carolingian Empire without having sufficient means. On the other hand, the French monarchy would from a modest base, slowly establish itself, ultimately to take the leading role in Western Europe.

====Expansion of France towards the Alps====
The Holy Roman Empire, which is represented in the modern world by Germany, sank into political chaos during the 13th century. This opened the way to all sorts of encroachment.

Philip IV joined the town of Lyon to his realm again (1312). It was a former capital of the Gauls and an important crossroads in European commerce.

The unhappy Phillip VI bought the [[Dauphiné]] on 30 March 1349, by the treaty of Romans.

His grandson, the brother of Charles V, Louis was invested as Duke of Anjou. He was further adopted as heir by the Countess of Provence and Queen of Sicily, Joan. He accomplished his conquest of Provence in 1383–1384. His grandson, [[René of Anjou|King René]] could not however, maintain his position in Italy and transferred his possessions to the King of France, Louis XI: Anjou in France and Provence in the Holy Roman Empire (1481).

Louis XI had the good sense not to adopt René's claims in Italy. That was not so in the case of his son Charles VIII who not only undertook an expedition to Naples which gave no result but beforehand, abandoned several of his father's conquests; Artois, Franche-Comté and Roussillon, to his eventual competitors.

=== Consolidation of royal power when faced with the Kings of England ===
[[File:Capetian France.jpg|thumb|The Kingdom of France in 987]]
In 987, the [[Carolingians]] were ousted in France by the election of [[Hugues Capet]] who imposed his dynasty. The royal domain of the first Capetians was initially limited to a part of the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]], between Paris and [[Orléans]], which were its principal towns.

Elsewhere, it was the great lords who exercised their authority, notably the six [[Peerage of France|lay peers of France]] : the dukes of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]], of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and of [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]], besides the counts of [[County of Champagne|Champagne]], of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and of [[County of Toulouse|Toulouse]].

The first objective of the Capetian kings was the consolidation of their regional authority, which they tried to do in the course of the 11th and 12th centuries. The principal enlargement of the royal domain in the course of that period was the purchase of the Viscounty of [[Bourges]] in 1101 which was to become the Duchy of [[Berry (province)|Berry]].

==== The conquest of Plantagenet territories ====
The struggle against the Norman and Angevin [[Kingdom of England|kings of England]] was the opportunity for the kings of France to extend their authority. They had, it is true, to face up to the formidable challenge with which they were presented.
The [[Duchy of Normandy|Duke of Normandy]] [[William the Conqueror]] became King of England in 1066 through his [[Battle of Hastings|victory at Hastings]] over the [[Saxons]]. On the extinction of his male line of descent, his heir was the Duke of Anjou, [[Henry II of England|Henry Plantagenet]], grandson by his mother of [[Henry I of England]]. Two months before he ascended to the English throne, as Henry II, he married [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Eleanor]], Duchess of Aquitaine, the richest heiress in the French kingdom and ex-wife of the [[Louis VII of France|King of France]]. The kings of France nevertheless, held some trump cards: the prestige and prerogatives of their position, the dissent at the heart of the Plantagenet family and the difficulty the latter had in exacting obedience in the South-West.

[[John of England|John Lackland]], son of Henry II, caused confusion among his [[vassal]]s by his irregular and violent behaviour.

The king of France, [[Philip II of France|Phillip Augustus]] was able to take advantage of this by taking Normandy from him by his capture of the fortress of the [[Château Gaillard]], downstream from Paris (1204).

The conquest of that province was vital as it increased the revenues of the French Crown substantially.

==== The conquest of south feudal territories : Auvergne and Languedoc ====
Philip Augustus was in fact the first king of whom the authority extended beyond the Île de France. The extent of his field of action and its effectiveness of his authority were enhanced. The king subdued notably, the [[County of Vermandois]], [[Touraine]] and the key parts of the [[County of Auvergne]]. The last was entrusted to several lords of the royal entourage before being formally reattached to the royal domain in 1531.
The success of Philip Augustus was confirmed by his victory over the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] at [[Battle of Bouvines|Bouvines]] in 1214.

Shortly afterwards, The King of France [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII the Lion]] exploited the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against the [[Cathars]] of the [[Le Midi|Midi]] to impose his authority on the County of Toulouse (1229).
This new conquest was to become the province of [[Languedoc]] and until [[French Revolution|The Revolution]], comprised essentially eight of the modern French départments in the Midi.
Thanks to the troubles of the end of the mediaeval period, Languedoc was to obtain the establishment of its own institutions: a parliament (which was a sovereign court of justice) and [[States Provincial (France)|États]], that is States: assembly which voted on taxes and which decided on communal investments.

The cumulative effect of these conquests was to prompt the kings to appoint their younger sons to territories: the ''apanages'' or privileges. This policy would allow the kings to progressively impose royal authority on the provinces, since in practice, the ''apanages'' would return without difficulty, to the crown whether by inheritance or by confiscation. This happened for example, in Poitou, in 1271 and Anjou, in 1481. These were two provinces taken by conquest from the kings of England by Phillip Augustus and Louis VIII.

==== Difficulties of the late medieval period ====
[[Image:Map- France at the Treaty of Bretigny.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|France after 1360]]

Occasionally, the ''apanage'' policy weakened the royal power. When the French king, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], was in conflict with his brother, [[Louis I, Duke of Orléans|Louis of Orléans]], their cousin, [[Jean Sans Peur|Jean Sans Peur, duke of Burgundy]], tried to impose himself on the government through a series of violent strikes. He progressively attracted the hostility of the rest of the group of the royal princes and was ousted.
[[Image:Shepherd-c-076.jpg|thumbnail|left|450px|France in 1328]]
With a surprise attack in 1418, he seized Paris, forcing the heir to the throne, the future Charles VII, to flee to [[Bourges]]. Similarly, counts of the very rich county of Flanders (at this stage, they were the dukes of Burgundy) used their position as top rank peers of France to establish a powerful state. Their policy was facilitated by the fragmentation of power in France and in Germany, at the end of the Middle Ages. The duchy of Burgundy's holdings in the Netherlands were the precursor of the modern Belgium.
[[Image:Map France 1477-en accurate border.svg|thumbnail|300px|right|France in the late 15th century]]

However, the kings of England remained dukes of Aquitaine. When [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] died, his nephew, Philip I count of Valois mounted the throne of France in the end, as [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]. Philip IV had married Jean of Champagne, who brought Champagne with her into the royal domain (1284). They had two sons but a new series of conflicts, known as the Hundred Years' War, was provoked by the claim of [[Edward III of England]], grandson of Philip IV through Edward's mother. Edward's aim was to supplant Philip VI. French armies suffered heavy defeats at [[Battle of Crécy|Crécy]] (1346) and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] (1356). Later, a third serious defeat was suffered at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] (1415). Having temporarily lost territory as a result of the [[Treaty of Brétigny]], the kingdom was again divided by the [[Treaty of Tours]] (1420). But a new spirit was born in [[Joan of Arc]] who obliged the English king to raise the [[Siege of Orléans]] (1429). Having been crowned at Reims, Charles VII returned to Paris and finally established his authority in the South West, that is to say Aquitaine, taking [[Bordeaux]] and [[Bayonne]] (1453) from the English king.

==The Early Modern period (1492–1789): conflicts with the Habsburgs of Spain and Austria==

===Integration of the last great feudal domains===
On the one hand, the succession of the Duchy of Burgundy and on the other, the desire to gain a foothold in Italy were the cause of a first series of conflicts with the [[House of Austria]], the Habsburgs. On the death of the last Duke of Burgundy, [[Charles the Bold]], his possessions were divided. His daughter, [[Mary of Burgundy]] inherited the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] and the Burgundian part of the Franche-Comté. [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] took back the Duchy of Burgundy proper and [[Picardy]] (1482). The grandson of Mary, the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V of Habsburg entered into conflict with [[Francis I of France]].<ref>He was the French king who met [[Henry VIII of England]] at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]</ref> They both wanted the Duchy of Burgundy as well as the [[Duchy of Milan]].

This first phase was interrupted by the [[French Wars of Religion]] and it was not decisive for the French monarchy. After his defeat at [[Battle of Pavia|Pavia]] in 1526, Francis I kept Burgundy but renounced in perpetuity, his [[suzerainty]] over the County of Flanders. The Burgundian Netherlands which [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] had inherited, had hitherto been composed partially of French and partially of German territories. By the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]], they became a separate political entity.

Meanwhile, [[Henry II of France]] consolidated the frontiers of the French kingdom by the occupation in 1552, of the towns of [[Metz]], [[Toul]] and [[Verdun]] which became the province of the [[Three Bishoprics]] and the re-taking of Calais from the [[Mary I of England|Queen of England]] (1558).

Elsewhere, the marriage of Louis XII with Ann of Brittany, followed by that of their daughter Claude to Francis I in 1514 permitted the attachment of the Duchy of Brittany to France again (1532).

At the time of his accession in 1589, Henry IV of France brought the possessions of the last remaining great feudal house, the Albrets, to the royal domain. He was the heir by his mother, Joan of Albret. These possessions were Béarn, Armagnac and Limousin.

Having each developed a strong identity, like Languedoc, these later additions, Béarn, Burgundy and Brittany retained their own institutions such as states and parliament, until the Revolution.

Note the red, Spanish-controlled lands around France and the fragmented nature of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>This fragmentation is shown in more detail in the Holy Roman Empire map (see right edge of window) but at high resolution it is slow.[[Image:Holy Roman Empire 1648.svg|thumb|30px|Holy Roman Empire 1648]]</ref>]]

===Expansion toward the east: the frontier on the Rhine===

====Toward new conflicts with the house of Austria====
The house of Austria showed a wish for supremacy in Europe, giving an impression of a militant bastion of [[Catholicism]] faced with the emergent [[Protestantism|Protestant]] states. The French monarchy was more worried that this claim would find echoes in Catholic circles in France. Besides, Habsburg possessions encircled its territory: Spain, the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]], Franche-Comté and more distantly, Milan. Until the [[Spanish Armada]] was defeated in 1588, it was not clear that England would not become part of this encirclement.

[[Henry IV of France]] had inherited a dispute with Spain. By his mother, he was heir to the kings of Navarre who had been dispossessed by the kings of Spain. They had been left with only [[Lower Navarre]]. From this time on, the kings of France carried also the title of 'king of Navarre'.

Before taking up the struggle again, Henry IV paid off the French adventure in Italy. In 1601, he intervened against [[Dukes of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]] who had supported plots against him. By the [[Treaty of Lyon (1601)|Treaty of Lyon]], France acquired [[Bresse]], [[Bugey]], [[Valromey]] and the [[Pays de Gex]], which together constitute the modern [[Ain]] departement. This was in exchange for the marquisate of [[Saluzzo]], the last place he held in Italy. France had taken possession of Saluzzo in 1548, on the death of its last marquis. It had been claimed since the purchase of the Dauphiné.

However, the prospect of a conflict with the house of Austria offended a great part of the Catholics of France, notably the court. [[Marie de Médicis]] and the duke [[Jean Louis de Nogaret de La Valette|D' Épernon]] were notable members of this party. It was in this context that Henry was assassinated by a fanatic, [[Ravaillac]], which put a stop to his project.

====The wars of the 17th century====
[[File:France 1552 to 1798-fr.svg|thumbnail|300px|Territorial conquests from 1552 to 1798]]
The king of France [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and his prime minister [[Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu|Richelieu]] retook the offensive in 1635 within the framework of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. A first, decisive war against Spain was marked by the victory at [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]] in 1643.

The eastward expansion was aimed at cutting the lines of communication of France's enemies and to facilitate contacts with her allies in Germany, a country then comprising many small, more or less independent states.

Wars against the house of Austria followed each other and the several treaties resulting from them accumulated into a French grasp on several provinces of the Holy Roman Empire:
* The [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) had the effect of an annexation by France of the margraviate of [[Haute-Alsace]], hitherto a Habsburg property, and of the [[Décapole]], a federation of ten Alsatian towns. They also ratified the annexation of the Three Bishoprics, of [[Three Bishoprics|Metz, Toul and Verdun]], occupied since 1552.
* The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) allowed the recovery of the [[County of Artois]] (with the exception of [[Aire-sur-la-Lys|Aire]] of [[Saint-Omer (Pas-de-Calais)|Saint-Omer]]), and of [[County of Roussillon|Roussillon]]: at this stage, the frontier with Spain became permanently defined.
* The first Treaty of [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Aix-la-Chapelle]] (Aachen) in 1668 ended the [[War of Devolution]]. Louis XIV took the towns of [[Lille]], [[Douai]] and [[Armentières]] from the Spanish, thereby allowing France a foothold back in Flanders.
* The [[Treaty of Nijmegen]], signed 10 August 1678, ended the [[Franco-Dutch War]]. The great loser in the war was Spain, ceding to France a list of places - Franche-Comté, the forts on the Aire and [[Saint-Omer]], [[Cambrai]], [[Valenciennes]] and [[Maubeuge]] in [[Comté de Hainaut|Hainaut]]. From the time of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], these French lands in Flanders and Hainaut would become the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] departement.

From 1680 to 1697, Louis XIV emboldened by his early successes, adopted a policy of unilateral annexations and groupings. The French even took part during the temporary conquest of Habsburg-ruled [[History of Luxembourg#Habsburg rule (1477–1815)|Luxembourg]] from 1684 to 1697.

By the [[Treaty of Rijswijk]] in 1697, which concluded the [[Nine Years' War]], he had finally to renounce most of these newly-taken lands but retained [[Saarlouis]] and [[Lower Alsace]], with the town of [[Strasbourg]]. The bulk of Alsace was thenceforward, entirely French. The exceptions were [[Mulhouse]] and some territories held by German princes.

====Consolidation of territory====
At the end of Louis XIV's reign, a balance seemed to have been achieved. The other European powers were no longer disposed to accept a new French expansion and were prepared to form alliances to oppose such a thing. The borders had been pushed out far from the French capital. On top of this, they were thenceforward defended by a network of modern fortresses constructed by [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]]. Fortified towns to the north of Lorraine ([[Montmédy]], [[Thionville]], [[Longwy]], [[Saarlouis]])<ref>The fortress at Saarlouis was typical of those designed by Vauban. (see right of window for link to a plan) [[Image:Saarlouis 1693.jpg|thumb|25px|right|Saarlouis Fort]]</ref> isolated the [[Duchy of Lorraine|Duchy]] from other states of the German (Holy Roman) Empire so as to weaken the independence of the duke.

Since 1632, France had regularly occupied Lorraine in periods of war, without annexing it.<ref>For an example of these efforts, see [[Lines of Weissenburg]].</ref> The duke, [[Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine|Charles IV]], who was allied with the houses of Austria and Bavaria, adopted a policy hostile towards France. He and afterwards, his nephew, [[Charles V of Lorraine]] had been officers in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Imperial Austrian Army]]. It was only later that France was presented with both motive and a favourable occasion to annex the duchy. This was the marriage, in 1736, of Francis de Lorraine to the heiress of the Austrian imperial house, Archduchess [[Maria Theresa]], at a moment when Austria was weakened. The [[Treaty of Vienna (1738)]] awarded Lorraine to [[Louis XV of France]], who gave it for life, to his father-in-law, [[Stanisław Leszczyński]]. The duchy of Lorraine would be formally annexed to France in 1766, when Stanisław died. In recompense, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Francis III]] was given the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], which was vacant.

Through animosity towards the Habsburgs, France allowed itself to be drawn into the [[War of Austrian Succession]] again. However, after the victory at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]], Louis XV renounced all his new conquests. In 1748, the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] (Aachen) put an end to the rivalry of the French and Austrian monarchies.

In 1768, the [[Republic of Genoa]] ceded [[Corsica]] to Louis XV in exchange for annulment of a debt.<ref>This made [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleone di Buonaparte]] a Frenchman.</ref>

Thus, on the eve of the Revolution, the modern, hexagonal shape of France was accomplished. However, the complexity of the feudal framework which governed the political organization under the [[Ancien Régime]] explains the survival of a number of foreign enclaves, particularly in the recent zone of expansion - [[Alsace]], Franche-Comté and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]].

{{Anchor|History of French departments}}<!-- [[History of French departments]] links here -->
==Since the French Revolution (1789-present)==

===Transformation arising from the French Revolution (1789–1815)===

==== Implementation of a new concept of national territory ====
The Revolution did away with the concept of ownership of political entities by individuals. France became one state rather than the aggregate of a mosaic of semi-states.

=====Suppression of the provinces and creation of the departements=====
As a means of loosening old ties of allegiance, and of rationalizing administration, the old divisions based on feudal ownership were replaced by departements of roughly uniform size and named after geographical features such as rivers. Even Paris was in the Seine departement. Nevertheless, in some cases such as [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] the modern departement comprises broadly, the territory of one period of acquisition.

=====Reduction of enclaves=====
Several territories were foreign enclaves surrounded by the lands of the kingdom of France. The [[Convention nationale]] willed their merging into France, by treaty or regardless of the rights of the (mainly German) princely owners.
Some of these treaties were:
* The [[Comtat Venaissin]], property of the [[Holy See]] since 1274, unilaterally annexed in 1791, annexation recognised by the Pope in the [[treaty of Tolentino]] (1797).
* The [[County of Montbéliard]] added to [[Haute-Saône]] (1793).
* [[Riquewihr]] and the county of [[Horbourg-Wihr|Horbourg]] belonging to the ruling family of Württemberg-Monbéliard, added to [[Haut-Rhin]] and the counties of Hanau-Lichtenberg, of [[La Petite-Pierre]] and of Sarrewerden, added to [[Bas-Rhin]] (1793)
* The principality of [[Salm-Salm]] joined to [[Vosges (department)|Vosges]] (1793).
* The counties of [[Créhange]] and of [[Dabo, Moselle|Dabo]] joined to [[Moselle (departement)|Moselle]] (1793), as was the lordship of [[Lixing-lès-Rouhling|Lixing]] (1795).
* [[Mulhouse|The republic of Mulhouse]], affiliated to the [[Switzerland|Helvetic Confederation]] since 1515 and having become an enclave in [[Haut-Rhin]], voted in favor of its reunion to France in 1798.

====French domination in Europe====
[[File:France Departement 1801.svg|thumb|France in 1801]]

===== Tempting prizes beyond the natural boundaries of The Alps, Jura, Pyrenees and Rhine (1789–1799) =====
The institution of a revolutionary regime in France led most of the European monarchies to form coalitions against it. The military successes of the armies of the [[French First Republic|First Republic]] resulted in a considerable expansion of the national territory.
* The [[Comtat Venaissin]]: 1791;
* The [[Duchy of Savoy]]: 1792;
* The [[County of Nice]], the [[County of Montbéliard]] and the [[Principality of Salm-Salm]]: 1793;
* The [[Austrian Netherlands]] and the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]]: 1795;
* The German states on the [[left bank of the Rhine]]: 1797.
* The [[Canton of Geneva|Republic of Geneva]] and the [[Republic of Mulhouse]]: 1798;
Most of these annexations were to be lost subsequently, at the Congress of Vienna (1815).

=====Conquests during the period of the Consulate and of the Empire (1799–1815)=====
[[File:Europe 1812 map en.png|thumb|The French Empire in 1812]]
Under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] the conquests continued. They were principally motivated by the aim of controlling the coasts of Europe, based on the idea of the [[natural borders of France]]. This was in the context of the struggle against the United Kingdom and the commercial blockade which that country imposed.<ref>See a little of [[Napoleonic Wars#War of the Fifth Coalition 1809|the context]]. In these circumstances, in Britain, it was as blockade runners and smugglers that the [[Chasse-marée#Chasse-marée - boat|chasse-marées]] came to wider notice than just among seamen, who already knew of them and their association with Breton fishing fleets.</ref> In that way, the following were annexed:
* [[Piedmont]] 1802, the king of [[Sardinia]] having taken refuge in his island.
* [[Ligurian Republic]] 1805.
* The [[Kingdom of Etruria]] and the [[Duchy of Parma]] 1808.
* The [[Papal States]] 1809.
* The [[Kingdom of Holland]] and the [[Canton of Valais|Valais]] 1810.
* The German North Sea coast ([[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]], [[Oldenburg (city)|Oldenburg]]) with the ports of [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], even [[Lübeck]] on the Baltic coast, in 1811.
* [[Catalonia]] was segregated from [[Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Spain]] and attached to France in 1812.

=====An appraisal after the Congress of Vienna (1815): the Treaty of Paris (1815)=====
Nearly all the conquests since the Revolution were restored to their former owners. France was virtually returned to its borders of 1791, except that she retained the former enclaves. the [[Comtat Venaissin]] with [[Avignon]], [[Mulhouse]] and [[Montbéliard]].

The other European powers were watchful lest France should ever regain control of the left bank of the Rhine (below the [[Lauter (Rhine)|River Lauter]]):
* The bulk of the German territories in the left (West) bank was awarded to [[Prussia]] despite the distance from the Prussian centre and the difference in cultures.
* A new state was created: the [[Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg]], of which the citadel served as an outpost of the Prussian army.
* France lost several strongholds covering her frontiers: [[Bouillon]] ([[Ardennes]] NE of Sedan), [[Saarlouis]] ([[Saarland]] NW of Saarbrücken), [[Landau]] ([[Rhineland]] NW of Karlsruhe) and so on.<ref>Alexandre Vuillemin's map of 1843 illustrates the state of development of the French borders after the Congress of Vienna. She then numbered 86 [[departement in France|departements]] and possessed Alsace-Lorraine but no longer [[Savoy]] or [[County of Nice|Nice]].

===Unification of Italy (1860) and the reunification of Germany (1866–1871): the effects===

==== Intervention of France in Italy<ref>There is a detailed article in French.</ref> ====

=====Reunification of Savoy and of the County of Nice (1860) with France=====
Following discussion at Plombières, of 21 July 1858, the minister of the Estates of Savoy [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour|Camillo Cavour]] promised [[Napoleon III]] the Duchy of Savoy and the [[county of Nice]], in exchange for French support in the policy of the unification of Italy (the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]), led by king [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor-Emmanuel II of Savoy]]. That proposition was made official by a treaty at Turin, dated December 1858. It was actually signed in January 1859.

Following the victories over Austria in 1859 ([[Battle of Magenta|Magenta]] and [[Battle of Solferino|Solferino]]),<ref>Solferino was the battle which inspired [[Henri Dunant]] to found the [[Red Cross]]</ref> and the [[Second Italian War of Independence#The peace|armistice of Villafranca]], Austria ceded [[Lombardy]] to France, who ceded it immediately to Piedmont/Sardinia, Napoleon III took back Savoy and Nice. With the [[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]], 24 March 1860, Victor-Emmanuel consented to ceding the duchy of Savoy and the county of Nice, after consulting the populations, which took place in April 1860. The king released his Savoyard subjects following the plebiscite of the same month.

=====Modifications of the Monaco frontier (1861)=====
Since 1848, [[Menton]] and [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]], then integral parts of the [[Monaco|principality of Monaco]], declared themselves to be free towns and were occupied by a Sardinian garrison. Following the secession by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] of the Duchy of Savoy and of the [[County of Nice]] to France in 1860, the inhabitants of Roquebrune and Menton, towns considered in the circumstances as forming part of the County of Nice, chose by referendum to be reunited with France.

On 2 February 1861, Prince [[Charles III of Monaco]] and [[Napoleon III]] signed a treaty at Paris by which, in exchange for 4,000,000 [[French franc|franc]]s, the prince and his successors would renounce in perpetuity, in favour of the Emperor of the French, all rights direct and indirect on these two communes.<ref>The link at the right of the window is to a map of the County of Nice showing the area of the Kingdom of Sardinia annexed to France in 1860 (light brown) and to Italy (yellow).

=====Alsace-Lorraine: contention between France and Germany (1871–1918 1940–1945)=====
Following the [[Franco-Prussian War]], of 1870 and by virtue of the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]] (10 May 1871), all of Alsace excepting the French-speaking [[Territoire de Belfort|Territory of Belfort]] area, was annexed by Germany, as were the districts of [[Sarreguemines]], [[Metz]], [[Sarrebourg]] (less 9 [[Communes of France|communes]]), [[Château-Salins]] (less 10 communes) and 11 communes of the arrondissement of [[Briey]] in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] and the [[Cantons of France|cantons]] of [[Saales]] and [[Schirmeck]] in the [[Vosges mountains|Vosges]]; a total of 1,447,000 hectares; 1,694 communes and 1,597,000 inhabitants. The new borderline between Germany and France was orientated on the actual ethnic/lingustic border. The only exemption from this principle was the annexation of the Metz area in to Germany which was predominately French-speaking. These territories would be recovered at the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] without a plebiscite.<ref>[[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) Article 27. See French Wikipedia, [[:fr:Traité de Versailles (1919)]] (Traité de Versailles (1919): Remaniements territoriaux)</ref>

Alsace-Lorraine was annexed ''[[de facto]]'' to the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] on 27 November 1940. Though the main towns of Alsace-Lorraine were reconquered during the autumn of 1944, by the French troops of Generals [[Marie Pierre Kœnig|Koenig]] and [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Leclerc]], fighting raged on in the [[Colmar Pocket]] until 2 February 1945.

===The National territory since 1945===

==== The Treaty of Paris with Italy (1947), last general revision of a French frontier ====
In 1947, in the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Treaty of Paris]], France gained about 700&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, in five extensions of the national territory in the departements of [[Alpes-Maritimes]], [[Hautes-Alpes]] and [[Savoie (department)|Savoie]]:
* annexation of the [[Tende]] Valley, which had remained Italian when the County of Nice became French in 1860. The border here now follows the main crest of the Alps. The Alpes-Maritimes departement saw its area extended by 560&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.
** the upper valley of the [[Roya (river)|Roya]], that is the communes of Tende and [[La Brigue]],
** the hamlets of Libre, Piène-Basse and Piène-Haute (commune of [[Breil-sur-Roya]]),
** the hamlet of Mollières (commune of [[Valdeblore]]),
** the upper valleys of the [[Vésubie]] and the [[Tinée]];
* displacement by several kilometres of the Italian border in the [[Mont-Cenis]] massif, thereby increasing French territory by 81.8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, on the commune of [[Lanslebourg-Mont-Cenis|Lanslebourg]], [[Bramans]] and a small area in favour of the commune of [[Sollières-Sardières]], Savoie. From this time on, the frontier has no longer followed the line of the crest but is on the slope of the Italian side. The Mont-Cenis Dam and reservoir, subsequently constructed on its slopes, is thus in France though on the Italian side of the ridge.
* annexation of the summit of Mont Thabor and its eastern slopes, notably the upper basin of the ''Vallée étroite'' (narrow valley), in the commune of [[Névache]], [[Hautes-Alpes]] (47&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).
* annexation of Mont Chaberton (17.1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), in the commune of [[Montgenèvre]] ([[Hautes-Alpes]]), notably of an Italian fort, destroyed by French forces at the opening of the [[World War II|Second World War]].
* annexation of the western part of the [[Little St. Bernard Pass]] following the watershed. (3.22&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), to the benefit of the commune of [[Séez]], Savoie.

Though the Paris Treaty settled disputes on these five points in the line of the border, in the area of the summits of [[Mont Blanc]] and [[Mont Blanc de Courmayeur]], questions remain open.
