'''Cold and heat adaptations in humans''' are a part of the broad adaptability of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Adaptations in humans can be [[Physiological adaptations|physiological]], [[Genetics|genetic]], or [[Culture|cultural]], which allow people to live in a wide variety of [[climate]]s. There has been a great deal of research done on developmental adjustment, [[acclimatization]], and cultural practices, but less research on genetic adaptations to cold and heat temperatures.

The human body always works to remain in [[homeostasis]]. One form of homeostasis is [[thermoregulation]]. Body temperature varies in every individual, but the average internal temperature is 37.0&nbsp;°C (98.6&nbsp;°F).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Harrison's online|last1=1949-|first1=Longo, Dan L (Dan Louis)|last2=1900-1978.|first2=Harrison, Tinsley Randolph|publisher=McGraw-Hill|oclc=767567894}}</ref> Stress from extreme external temperature can cause the human body to shut down.

== Origin of cold and heat adaptations ==
Modern humans emerged from Africa approximately 40,000 years ago during a period of unstable climate, leading to a variety of new traits among the population.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Krajick |first1=Kevin |title=Ancient Humans Left Africa to Escape Drying Climate, Says Study|url=https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2017/10/05/ancient-humans-left-africa-to-escape-drying-climate-says-study/ |website=State of the Planet |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=4 December 2018|date=2017-10-05 }}</ref><ref name=":0" /> When modern humans spread into Europe, they outcompeted [[Neanderthal]]s. Researchers hypothesize that this suggests early modern humans were more evolutionarily fit to live in various climates.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Daley |first1=Jason |title=Climate Change Likely Iced Neanderthals Out Of Existence |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/modern-humans-didnt-kill-neanderthals-weather-did-180970167/ |website=Smithsonian Magazine |publisher=Smithsonian |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rae |first1=Todd C. |last2=Koppe |first2=Thomas |last3=Stringer |first3=Chris |title=The Neanderthal face is not cold adapted |journal=Journal of Human Evolution |date=February 2011 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=234–239 |doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.10.003 |pmid=21183202}}</ref> This is supported in the variability selection hypothesis proposed by Richard Potts, which says that human adaptability came from environmental change over the long term.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Potts|first=Richard|date=1998-01-01|title=Environmental hypotheses of hominin evolution|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=107|issue=S27|pages=93–136|doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-8644(1998)107:27+<93::aid-ajpa5>3.0.co;2-x|pmid=9881524|issn=1096-8644}}</ref>

=== Ecogeographic rules ===
[[Bergmann's rule|Bergmann’s rule]] states that [[endotherm]]ic animal subspecies living in colder climates have larger bodies than that of the subspecies living in warmer climates.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Marshall T.|date=1953-08-01|title=The Application of Ecological Rules to the Racial Anthropology of the Aboriginal New World*|journal=American Anthropologist |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=311–327|doi=10.1525/aa.1953.55.3.02a00020|issn=1548-1433}}</ref> Individuals with larger bodies are better suited for colder climates because larger bodies produce more heat due to having more cells, and have a smaller surface area to volume ratio compared to smaller individuals, which reduces heat loss. A study by Frederick Foster and Mark Collard found that Bergmann’s rule can be applied to humans when the latitude and temperature between groups differ widely.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Foster |first1=Frederick |last2=Collard |first2=Mark|date=2013-08-28|title=A Reassessment of Bergmann's Rule in Modern Humans |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=e72269|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0072269|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3756069|pmid=24015229|bibcode=2013PLoSO...872269F }}</ref>

[[Allen's rule|Allen’s rule]] is a biological rule that says the limbs of endotherms are shorter in cold climates and longer in hot climates. Limb length affects the body’s surface area, which helps with thermoregulation. Shorter limbs help to conserve heat, while longer limbs help to dissipate heat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Holliday|first1=Trenton W.|last2=Hilton|first2=Charles E.|date=2010-06-01|title=Body proportions of circumpolar peoples as evidenced from skeletal data: Ipiutak and Tigara (Point Hope) versus Kodiak Island Inuit|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=142 |issue=2 |pages=287–302 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21226 |pmid=19927367 |issn=1096-8644}}</ref> Marshall T. Newman argues that this can be observed in [[Eskimo]], who have shorter limbs than other people and are laterally built.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Marshall T.|date=1961-06-01|title=Biological Adaptation of Man to His Environment: Heat, Cold, Altitude, and Nutrition|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=617–633 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1961.tb31093.x |pmid=13728673|issn=1749-6632|bibcode=1961NYASA..91..617N}}</ref>

== Physiological adaptations ==
{{main|Thermoregulation in humans}}
Origins of heat and cold adaptations can be explained by [[climatic adaptation]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Climatic adaptation |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/climatic-adaptation |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref><ref>"Climate Effects On Human Evolution". 2018. The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program. http://humanorigins.si.edu/research/climate-and-human-evolution/climate-effects-human-{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} evolution.</ref> Ambient air temperature affects how much energy investment the human body must make. The temperature that requires the least amount of energy investment is 21&nbsp;°C (69.8&nbsp;°F).<ref name=":0" /> The body controls its temperature through the [[hypothalamus]]. [[Thermoreceptor]]s in the skin send signals to the hypothalamus, which indicate when [[vasodilation]] and [[vasoconstriction]] should occur.

=== Cold ===
The human body has two methods of [[thermogenesis]], which produces heat to raise the core body temperature. The first is [[shivering]], which occurs in an unclothed person when the ambient air temperature is under 25&nbsp;°C (77&nbsp;°F).<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Human adaptation and accommodation|last=1939-|first=Frisancho, A. Roberto|date=1993-01-01|publisher=University of Michigan Press|oclc=26763611}}</ref> It is limited by the amount of [[glycogen]] available in the body.<ref name=":0" /> The second is non-shivering, which occurs in [[brown adipose tissue]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890013690.pdf|title=Acclimatization to cold in humans|last1=Kaciuba-Uscilko|first1=Hannah|last2=Greenleaf|first2=John|date=April 1, 1989|website=ntrs.nasa.gov/|publisher=United States|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>

Population studies have shown that the San tribe of Southern Africa and the Sandawe of Eastern Africa have reduced shivering thermogenesis in the cold, and poor cold induced vasodilation in fingers and toes compared to that of Caucasians.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Daanen | first1 = H.

=== Heat ===
The only mechanism the human body has to cool itself is by [[Perspiration|sweat]] [[evaporation]].<ref name=":0" /> Sweating occurs when the ambient air temperatures is above 35&nbsp;°C (95&nbsp;°F) and the body fails to return to the normal internal temperature.<ref name=":3" /> The evaporation of the sweat helps cool the blood beneath the skin. It is limited by the amount of water available in the body, which can cause dehydration.<ref name=":0" />

Humans adapted to heat early on. In Africa, the climate selected for traits that helped us stay cool. Also, we had physiological mechanisms that reduced the rate of metabolism and that modified the sensitivity of sweat glands to provide an adequate amount for cooldown without the individual becoming dehydrated.<ref>"Climate Effects On Human Evolution". 2018.

There are two types of heat the body is adapted to, humid heat and dry heat, but the body has adapted to both in the same way. Humid heat is characterized by warmer temperatures with a high amount of water vapor in the air. Humid heat is dangerous as the moisture in the air prevents the evaporation of sweat. Dry heat is characterized by warmer temperatures with little to no water vapor in the air, such as desert conditions. Dry heat is also very dangerous as sweat will tend to evaporate extremely quickly, causing dehydration. Both humid heat and dry heat favor individuals with less fat and slightly lower body temperatures.<ref>"Climatic Adaptation | Physical Anthropology". 2018. Encyclopedia Britannica.https://www.britannica.com/science/climatic-adaptation.</ref>

=== Acclimatization ===
When humans are exposed to certain climates for extended periods of time, physiological changes occur to help the individual adapt to hot or cold climates. This helps the body conserve energy.<ref name=":2" />

==== Cold ====
The [[Inuit]] have more blood flowing into their extremities, and at a hotter temperature, than people living in warmer climates. A 1960 study on the [[Alacalufe people|Alacaluf Indians]] shows that they have a resting metabolic rate 150 to 200 percent higher than the white controls used. [[Sami people|Lapps]] do not have an increase in metabolic rate when sleeping, unlike non-acclimated people.<ref name=":1" /> [[Aboriginal Australians]] undergo a similar process, where the body cools but the metabolic rate does not increase.<ref name=":3" />

==== Heat ====
Humans in Central Africa have been living in similar tropical climates for at least 40,000 years, which means that they have similar thermoregulatory systems.<ref name=":0" />

A study done on the [[Bantu peoples|Bantus]] of South Africa showed that Bantus have a lower sweat rate than that of acclimated and nonacclimated whites. A similar study done on Aboriginal Australians produced similar results, with Aboriginals having a much lower sweat rate than whites.<ref name=":3" />

== Culture ==
Social adaptations enabled early modern humans to occupy environments with temperatures that were drastically different from that of Africa. (Potts 1998). Culture enabled humans to expand their range to areas that would otherwise be uninhabitable.<ref name=":3" />

=== Cold ===
Humans have been able to occupy areas of extreme cold through clothing, buildings, and manipulation of fire. [[Furnace]]s have further enabled the occupation of cold environments.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":2" />

Historically many Indigenous Australians wore only genital coverings. Studies have shown that the warmth from the fires they build is enough to keep the body from fighting heat loss through shivering.<ref name=":3" /> Eskimos use well-insulated houses that are designed to transfer heat from an energy source to the living area, which means that the average indoor temperature for coastal Eskimos is 10 to 20&nbsp;°C (50-68&nbsp;°F).<ref name=":3" />

=== Heat ===
Humans inhabit hot climates, both dry and [[Humidity|humid]], and have done so for thousands of years. Selective use of clothing and technological inventions such as [[air conditioning]] allows humans to thrive in hot climates.

One example is the [[Bedouin|Chaamba Arabs]], who live in the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]. They wear clothing that traps air in between skin and the clothes, preventing the high ambient air temperature from reaching the skin.<ref name=":3" />

== Genetic adaptations ==
There has been very little research done in the genetics behind adaptations to heat and cold stress. Data suggests that certain parts of the [[human genome]] have only been [[Natural selection|selected]] for recently. Research on gene-culture interaction has been successful in linking agriculture and [[lactose]] tolerance. However, most evidence of links between culture and selection has not been proven.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=Kevin N.|last2=Odling-Smee|first2=John|last3=Myles|first3=Sean|title=How culture shaped the human genome: bringing genetics and the human sciences together|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=11|issue=2|pages=137–148|doi=10.1038/nrg2734|pmid=20084086|year=2010}}</ref> This last question, anyhow, is a central topic of [[behavioral epigenetics]].
