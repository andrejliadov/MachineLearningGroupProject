{{DISPLAYTITLE:''n''-vector}}

The ''' ''n''-vector''' representation (also called geodetic normal or ellipsoid normal vector) is a three-parameter [[mathematical singularity|non-singular]] representation well-suited for replacing [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] as [[horizontal position representation]] in mathematical calculations and computer algorithms.

Geometrically, the ''n''-vector for a given position on an [[ellipsoid]] is the outward-pointing [[unit vector]] that is [[surface normal|normal]] in that position to the ellipsoid. For representing horizontal positions on Earth, the ellipsoid is a [[reference ellipsoid]] and the vector is [[Vector decomposition|decomposed]] in an [[ECEF|Earth-centered Earth-fixed]] [[coordinate system]]. It behaves smoothly at all Earth positions, and it holds the mathematical [[Injective function|one-to-one]] property.

More in general, the concept can be applied to representing positions on the boundary of a strictly [[Convex set|convex]] [[bounded subset]] of ''k''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], provided that that boundary is a [[differentiable manifold]]. In this general case, the ''n''-vector consists of ''k'' parameters.

==General properties==

A [[normal vector]] to a strictly [[convex set|convex]] surface can be used to uniquely define a surface position. ''n''-vector is an  outward-pointing normal vector with [[unit vector|unit length]] used as a position representation.

For most applications the surface is the [[reference ellipsoid]] of the Earth, and thus ''n''-vector is used to represent a horizontal position. Hence, the angle between ''n''-vector and the equatorial plane corresponds to [[geodetic latitude]], as shown in the figure.

A surface position has two [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], and thus two parameters are sufficient to represent any position on the surface. On the reference ellipsoid, [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are common parameters for this purpose, but like all ''two-parameter representations'', they have [[mathematical singularity|singularities]]. This is similar to [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions|orientation]], which has three degrees of freedom, but all ''three-parameter representations'' have singularities.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Stuelpnagel |first1= John |year= 1964 |title= On the Parametrization of the Three-Dimensional Rotation Group |journal= SIAM Review |publisher= Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |volume= 6 |issue= 4 |pages=422–430 |doi=10.1137/1006093 |jstor=2027966}}</ref> In both cases the singularities are avoided by adding an extra parameter, i.e. to use ''n''-vector (three parameters) to [[Horizontal position representation|represent horizontal position]] and a unit [[quaternion]] (four parameters) to [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions|represent orientation]].

''n''-vector is a [[Injective function|one-to-one]] representation, meaning that any surface position corresponds to one unique ''n''-vector, and any ''n''-vector corresponds to one unique surface position. 

As a [[Euclidean vector|Euclidean 3D vector]], standard 3D [[Vector calculus|vector algebra]] can be used for the position calculations, and this makes ''n''-vector well-suited for most horizontal position calculations.

== Converting latitude/longitude to ''n''-vector ==

Based on the definition of the [[ECEF]] coordinate system, called ''e'', it is clear that going from latitude/longitude to ''n''-vector, is achieved by:

:<math>\mathbf n^e=\left[ \begin{matrix}
   \cos (\mathrm{latitude})\cos (\mathrm{longitude})  \\
   \cos (\mathrm{latitude})\sin (\mathrm{longitude})  \\
   \sin (\mathrm{latitude})  \\
\end{matrix} \right]</math>

The superscript ''e'' means that ''n''-vector is [[Vector decomposition|decomposed]] in the coordinate system ''e'' (i.e. the first component is the [[Scalar resolute|scalar projection]] of ''n''-vector onto the ''x''-axis of ''e'', the second onto the ''y''-axis of ''e'' etc.). Note that the equation is exact both for spherical and ellipsoidal Earth model.

== Converting ''n''-vector to latitude/longitude ==

From the three components of ''n''-vector, <math>n_x^e</math>, <math>n_y^e</math>, and <math>n_z^e</math>, latitude can be found by using:

:<math>\mathrm{latitude}=\arcsin\left( n_z^e \right)=\arctan\left( \frac{n_z^e}{\sqrt{{n_x^e}^2+{n_y^e}^2}} \right)</math>

The rightmost expression is best suited for computer program implementation.<ref name=Gade/>

Longitude is found using:

:<math>\mathrm{longitude}=\arctan\left(\frac{n_y^e}{n_x^e} \right)</math>

In these expressions <math>\arctan(y/x)</math> should be implemented using a call to [[atan2]](''y'',''x'').  The [[Geographical pole|Pole]] [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]] of longitude is evident as [[atan2]](0,0) is undefined. Note that the equations are exact both for spherical and ellipsoidal Earth model.

== Example: Great circle distance==
Finding the [[great circle distance]] between two horizontal positions (assuming spherical Earth) is usually done by means of latitude and longitude. [[great circle distance#Formulas|Three different expressions]] for this distance are common; the first is based on [[Inverse trigonometric function|arccos]], the second is based on [[Inverse trigonometric function|arcsin]], and the final is based on [[Inverse trigonometric function|arctan]]. The expressions, which are successively more complex to avoid [[Numerical stability|numerical instabilities]], are not easy to find, and since they are based on latitude and longitude, the Pole singularities may become a problem. They also contain [[Delta (letter)|deltas]] of latitude and longitude, which in general should be used with care near the ±[[180th meridian|180° meridian]] and the Poles.

Solving the same problem using ''n''-vector is simpler due to the possibility of using [[Vector calculus|vector algebra]]. The arccos expression is achieved from the [[dot product]], while the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the [[cross product]] gives the arcsin expression. Combining the two gives the arctan expression:<ref name=Gade/>

:<math>\begin{align}
 & \Delta \sigma=\arccos\left( \mathbf n_a\cdot \mathbf n_b \right) \\ 
 & \Delta \sigma=\arcsin\left( \left| \mathbf n_a\times \mathbf n_b \right| \right) \\ 
 & \Delta \sigma=\arctan\left( \frac{\left| \mathbf n_a\times \mathbf n_b \right|}{\mathbf n_a\cdot \mathbf n_b} \right) \\ 
\end{align}</math>

where <math>\mathbf n_a</math> and <math>\mathbf n_b</math> are the ''n''-vectors representing the two positions ''a'' and ''b''. <math>\Delta\sigma</math> is the angular difference, and thus the great-circle distance is achieved by multiplying with the Earth radius. This expression also works at the poles and at the ±180° meridian. Note that ''arctan'' must be replaced by ''[[atan2]]'' in computer program implementation.

There are several other examples where the use of vector algebra simplifies standard problems.<ref name=Gade/> For a general comparison of the various representations, see the [[horizontal position representation| horizontal position representations page]].
