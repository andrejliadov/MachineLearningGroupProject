The '''laminar sublayer''', also called the '''viscous sublayer''', is the region of a mainly-[[turbulence|turbulent]] flow that is near a [[No-slip condition|no-slip boundary]] and in which the flow is [[Laminar flow|laminar]]. As such, it is a type of [[boundary layer]]. The existence of the laminar sublayer can be understood in that the flow velocity decreases towards the no-slip boundary. Because of this, the [[Reynolds number]] decreases until at some point the flow crosses the threshold from turbulent to laminar.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.imc.pcz.czest.pl/instytut/pl/3/3.8/materialy/afm_bl/afm_bl4.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082617/http://www.imc.pcz.czest.pl/instytut/pl/3/3.8/materialy/afm_bl/afm_bl4.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The laminar sublayer is important for river-bed [[ecology]]: below the laminar-turbulent interface, the flow is stratified, but above it, it rapidly becomes well-mixed. This threshold can be important in providing homes and feeding grounds for [[benthic]] organisms.<ref>journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid...</ref>

Whether the roughness due to the bed sediment or other factors are smaller or larger than this sublayer has an important bearing in [[hydraulics]] and [[sediment transport]]. Flow is defined as [[hydraulically rough flow|hydraulically rough]] if the roughness elements are larger than the laminar sublayer (thereby perturbing the flow), and as [[hydraulically smooth flow|hydraulically smooth]] if they are smaller than the laminar sublayer (and therefore ignorable by the main body of the flow).<ref>http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_6a.pdf</ref>
