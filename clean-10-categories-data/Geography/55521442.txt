The title of the book "''Asar-e Ajam''" is an Arabic phrase which consists of two nouns; Asar (in [[Perso-Arabic alphabet]]: آثار) (or Athar in its original Arabic pronunciation) which means deeds, antiquities or monuments and [[Ajam]] (in Perso-Arabic alphabet: عجم) which in [[Arabic literature]] refers to [[the Persians]].
