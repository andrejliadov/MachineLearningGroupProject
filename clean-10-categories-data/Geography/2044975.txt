A '''riverscape'''<ref>[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/riverscape Collins English Dictionary] ''Riverscape'' meaning by [[Collins English Dictionary]]</ref> (also called '''river landscape''')<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z327gdm/revision/1 BBC Bitesize] ''River landscapes'' (part of: Landscapes and Physical Processes)</ref> comprises the features of the [[landscape]] which can be found on and along a [[river]]. Most features of riverscapes include natural [[landforms]] (such as [[meander]]s and [[oxbow lake]]s) but they can also include artificial landforms (such as man-made [[levee|levees]] and [[Groyne|river groynes]]). Riverscapes can be divided into upper course riverscapes, middle course riverscapes, and lower course riverscapes.

The term '''riverine''' is sometimes used to indicate the same type of landscape as a riverscape, or only the [[Bank (geography)|riverbank]]. Riverine landscapes may also be defined as a network of rivers and their surrounding land, which is excellent for [[agriculture|agricultural]] use because of the rich and [[Soil fertility|fertile]] [[soil]].<ref>[http://lib.oup.com.au/secondary/geography/Big_Ideas_Geography/8/Oxford-Big-Ideas-Geography-8-ch1-Landforms-and-landscapes.pdf Oxford Big Ideas Geography] ''Landforms and landscapes''</ref> The word ''riverine'' is also used as an [[adjective]] which means "relating to or found on a river or the banks of a river".<ref>[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/riverine Cambridge Dictionary] ''Riverine'' meaning by [[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary|Cambridge Dictionary]]</ref>

==Upper course==

In the upper course of rivers, [[Channel (geography)|channels]] are narrow and gradients are steep.<ref>[http://www.geography.learnontheinternet.co.uk/topics/river_upper_course.html Internet Geography] ''Upper course of a river''</ref> Vertical [[erosion]] is the prominent land-forming process. Typical features of upper course riverscapes include:
* [[Interlocking spur]]s
* [[Braided river|Braided channels]]
* V-shaped valleys
* [[Giant's kettle]]s
* [[Plunge pool]]s
* [[Alluvial fan]]s
* [[Tributary|Tributaries]]
* [[Waterfall]]s
* [[Pothole (landform)|Potholes]]

* [[Rapid]]s

==Middle course==

In the middle course of rivers, the [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] increases and the gradient flattens out. Typical features of middle course riverscapes include:
* [[U-shaped valley]]s
* [[Riparian forests]]
* [[Slip-off slope]]s
* [[Oxbow lake]]s
* [[Tributary|Tributaries]]
* [[Cut bank]]s
* [[Meander]]s
* [[Marsh]]es
* [[Riffle]]s
* [[Stream pool|Pools]]

==Lower course==

In the lower course of rivers, the channels are wide and deep, and the discharge is at its highest. Typical features of lower course riverscapes include:
* Wide flat-bottomed valleys
* [[Groyne|River groynes]]
* Large [[bridge]]s
* [[Distributaries]]
* [[River delta]]s
* [[Floodplain]]s
* [[Meander]]s
* [[Levee]]s
* [[Kolk (vortex)|Kolks]]

==Landscape art==
Riverscapes are popular subjects in [[landscape painting]]s. In addition to the use of the [[word]] ''riverscape'' in [[geography]], the term is also associated with landscape art. In [[visual arts]] the term 'river scene' is considered a [[synonym]] for the word 'riverscape'. Related terms used in visual arts include '[[seascape]]', '[[Cloudscape (art)|cloudscape]]' and '[[cityscape]]'. A well-known riverscape [[painter]] was [[Salomon van Ruysdael]]. Below are some examples of riverscape paintings.
