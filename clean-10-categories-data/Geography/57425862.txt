'''Geographic contiguity''' is the characteristic in [[geography]] of political or geographical land divisions, as a group, not being interrupted by other land or water. Such divisions are referred to as being ''contiguous.''  In the [[United States]], for example, the "[[Contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]]" excludes [[Hawaii]] and [[Alaska]], which do not share borders with other [[U.S. state]]s.<ref>[http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/imf/sites/NWI_CONUS/CONUS_metadata/CONUS_Layers.html Wetlands Metadata for the Lower 48 States, US Fish and Wildlife Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105143231/http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/imf/sites/NWI_CONUS/CONUS_metadata/CONUS_Layers.html |date=5 November 2007 }}</ref>

Other examples of geographical contiguity might include the "contiguous [[European Union]]" excluding member states such as Ireland, Sweden, Finland (between [[Åland Islands|Åland]] and [[Islands of Turku|Turku Archipelago]]), Malta and Cyprus (these being non-contiguous), or the "contiguous United Kingdom" referring to all parts of the country excepting [[Northern Ireland]] (it being geographically non-contiguous).

Two or more contiguous [[Municipality|municipalities]] can be consolidated into one, or one municipality can consist of many noncontiguous elements. For example, the [[Financially Distressed Municipalities Act]] allows the commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] to merge contiguous municipalities to reduce [[financial distress]].

Geographic contiguity is important in [[biology]], especially [[range (biology)|animal ranges]]. For a particular species, its habitat may be a '[[contiguous range]]', or it might be broken, requiring periodic, typically seasonal migrations (see: [[Disjunct distribution]]). The same concept of contiguous range is true for human transportation studies in an attempt to understand census geography.<ref>[http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Reference/COGG/LongDescription_e.cfm?GEO_LEVEL=5&REFCODE=1&LANG=E Census Metropolitan Area, Statistics Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217115704/http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Reference/COGG/LongDescription_e.cfm?GEO_LEVEL=5&REFCODE=1&LANG=E |date=17 December 2005 }}</ref> It also comes into play with electoral geography and politics.<ref>[http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/217 The Electoral Geography of Weimar Germany: Exploratory Spatial Data Analyses of Protestant Support for the Nazi Party, by John O'Loughlin]</ref>
