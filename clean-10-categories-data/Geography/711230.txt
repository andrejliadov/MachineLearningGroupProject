'''Regional geography''' is a major branch of [[geography]]. It focuses on the interaction of different cultural and natural geofactors in a specific land or landscape, while its counterpart, systematic geography, concentrates on a specific geofactor at the global level.

== Basics ==
Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as natural elements, human elements, and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] which covers the techniques of delineating space into [[region]]s. Rooted in the tradition of the German-speaking countries, the two pillars of regional geography are the idiographic study of ''Länder'' or spatial individuals (specific places, countries, continents) and the typological study of ''Landschaften'' or spatial types (landscapes such as coastal regions, mountain regions, border regions, etc.).

Regional geography is also a certain approach to geographical study, comparable to [[quantitative revolution|quantitative geography]] or [[critical geography]]. This approach prevailed during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, a period when then regional geography paradigm was central within the geographical sciences. It was later criticised for its descriptiveness and the lack of theory. Strong criticism was leveled against it in particular during the 1950s and the [[quantitative revolution]]. Main critics were G. H. T. Kimble<ref name=":0">Kimble, G.H.T. (1951): ''The Inadequacy of the Regional Concept'', London Essays in Geography, edd. L.D. Stamp and S.W. Wooldridge, pp. 492-512.</ref> and [[Fred K. Schaefer]].<ref>Schaefer, F.K. (1953): ''Exceptionalism in Geography: A Methodological Examination'', [[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]], vol. 43, pp. 226-245.</ref> The regional geography paradigm has influenced many other geographical sciences, including [[economic geography]] and [[geomorphology]]. Regional geography is still taught in some universities as a study of the major regions of the world, such as Northern and Latin America, Europe, and Asia and their countries. In addition, the notion of a city-region approach to the study of geography, underlining urban-rural interactions, gained credence since the mid-1980s. Some geographers have also attempted to reintroduce a certain amount of regionalism since the 1980s. This involves a complex definition of regions and their interactions with other [[scale (spatial)|scale]]s.<ref>MacLeod, G. and Jones, M. (2001): ''Renewing The Geography of Regions'', Environment and Planning D, 16(9), pp. 669-695.</ref>

Regional geography was once used as a basis for the geomorphological works such as those of [[David Linton (geographer)|David Linton]] and [[Henri Baulig]].<ref name=Karna2020>{{cite journal |last=Lidmar-Bergström |first=Karna |author-link=Karna Lidmar-Bergström|date=2020 |title=The major landforms of the bedrock of Sweden–with a view onthe relationships between physical geography and geology|journal=[[Geografiska Annaler]] |publisher=Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography |volume= 102|pages=1–11 |doi=10.1080/04353676.2019.1702809 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Yet, according to [[Karna Lidmar-Bergström]] regional geography is since the 1990s not longer accepted by mainstream scholarship as a basis for geomorphological studies.<ref name=Karna2020/>

== Notable figures ==
Notable figures in regional geography were [[Alfred Hettner]] in Germany, with his concept of [[chorology]]; [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] in France, with the [[Possibilism (geography)|possibilism]] approach (possibilism being a softer notion than [[environmental determinism]]); and, in the United States, [[Richard Hartshorne]] with his concept of areal differentiation. The school of [[Carl O. Sauer]], strongly influenced by  Alfred Hettner and Paul Vidal de la Blache, is also seen as regional geography in its broadest sense.
