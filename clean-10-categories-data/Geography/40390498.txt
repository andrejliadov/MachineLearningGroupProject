{{short description|Scientific voyage designed to explore the flora of a particular region}}
A '''botanical expedition''' is a [[science|scientific]] journey or voyage designed to explore the [[flora]] of a particular region. The expedition could be specifically designed for exploring the flora, or this could have been a part of studying the [[natural history]] of the region. A naturalist or [[botany|botanist]] was charged with drawing and describing the flora, collecting specimens of unknown plants in a [[plant press]], and identifying potential economically important plants.<ref>Visible Empire: Botanical Expeditions and Visual Culture in the Hispanic Enlightenment, Daniela Bleichmar, University of Chicago Press, 2012</ref> On botanical expeditions funded by governments, the plants were often collected by the person in the field, but described and named by a government sponsored scientists at botanical gardens and universities. For example, many of the species collected on the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] were described and named by [[Frederick Traugott Pursh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal/pbio/LnC/pursh.html |title=Frederick Traugott Pursh (1774-1820) |publisher=Plantsystematics.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref>
