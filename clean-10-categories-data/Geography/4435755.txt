The '''Ludogorie''' ({{lang-bg|Лудогорие}}, usually used with a definite article, Лудогорието, ''Ludogorieto'') or '''Deliorman''' (''Делиорман'', {{lang-tr|Deliorman|lit=mad forest}} from Bulgarian: lud - "mad", "crazy" and gora - "forest"), is a region in northeastern [[Bulgaria]] stretching over the plateau of the same name. Major cities in the region are [[Razgrad]], [[Novi Pazar, Bulgaria|Novi Pazar]], [[Pliska]] and [[Isperih]]. Part of the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]], the region is hilly in the east, reaching up to {{convert|485.70|m|ft}} in height near the village of [[Samuil (village)|Samuil]], but merges with the plains of [[Dobruja]] and the [[Danube]] to the north, with the lowest point near [[Yuper]] ({{convert|39.14|m|ft|abbr=on}}). The region is bordered to the west by the [[Provadiya River]] and the [[Rusenski Lom|Beli Lom]]; to the east it transitions into the [[Dobruja]] plateau.

The plateau was formed of [[Karst]] [[limestone]] from the [[Lower Cretaceous]] covered by [[loess]] material. Among the region's geological resources are [[kaolinite]], [[fireclay]] and [[mica]]. The climate is temperate [[continental climate|continental]], with up to {{convert|650|mm|in}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] yearly. Although the Ludogorie is poor in overground water resources, with only a few low rivers such as the Krapinets and the Kulak, it is rich in underground waters. 

In ancient times, the Ludogorie was inhabited by the [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes of the [[Getae]] who left behind local architectural landmarks such as the [[Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari]], a richly-decorated 3rd-century BC tomb that is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Until the end of the 18th century, the Ludogorie was largely dominated by forests that merged with the ones of the [[Balkan Mountains]] (''Stara Planina'') to the south, giving the name of the region both in Bulgarian and Turkish, literally translated as "region of wild forests" in [[English language|English]]. In recent times, the forests have been nearly completely replaced by [[arable land]] and only the woods in the [[Voden Reserve]] are the reminiscent of the former larger forest area. The soil from the chopped down forests is a rich soil with [[humus]], very eligible for agriculture.

''Ludogorie'' is a relatively new name, a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] [[calque]] of the older Turkish name ''Deliorman''; it was officially introduced in 1950. In 1942, the name had been changed to ''Polesie'',<ref>{{cite book|title=Енциклопедия "България"|publisher=Българска академия на науките|location=София|date=1982|volume=Т. 3. И-Л|language=Bulgarian}}</ref> a Slavic [[toponym]] meaning "place by the woods", but this name never entered common use. The Turkish name is etymologically and semantically akin to the name of [[Teleorman County]] in southern [[Romania]].

The Ludogorie mostly belongs to [[Razgrad Province]], with a western part in [[Ruse Province]], and has a mixed population of [[Bulgarians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Romani people|Romani]]. The Ludogorie has attained fame for its [[Yağlı güreş|oil wrestlers]] throughout time, including [[Koca Yusuf]] and [[Hergeleci Ibrahim]].

[[Ludogorie Peak]] on [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] bears the name of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scarmarbin.be/gazetteer.php?p=details&id=14472|title=Composite Antarctic Marine Gazetteer Placedetails: Ludogorie Peak|publisher=SCAR-MarBIN Portal|accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref> [[PFC Ludogorets Razgrad]], the football club of Razgrad, was also named after the Ludogorie region.
