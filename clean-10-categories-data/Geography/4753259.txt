The '''M.E.M. (Master of Environmental Management)''' is a degree designed for students with primary interests in careers in [[environmental policy]] and [[analysis]], [[stewardship]], [[education]], [[Consultant|consulting]], or [[management]] dealing with [[natural resource]] or [[Environmental quality|environmental]] issues. The program requires course work in both the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, with a particular focus on the relationship among [[science]], management, and [[policy]]. The ultimate purpose of the [[degree program]] is to prepare students to address ecological and social systems with scientific understanding and an ability to make sense of the complex underlying social and ecological context.

The value of an interdisciplinary environmental degree is best espoused by [[Aldo Leopold]], who obtained a [[Master of Forestry]] degree.

''"One of the requisites for an ecological comprehension of land is an understanding of ecology, and this is by no means co-extensive with 'education'; in fact, much higher education seems deliberately to avoid ecological concepts. An understanding of ecology does not necessarily originate in courses bearing ecological labels; it is quite as likely to be labeled geography, botany, agronomy, history, or economics. This is as it should be...".''<ref>{{cite book|last=Leopold|first=Aldo|title=A Sand County Almanac: And Sketches Here and There|year=1949|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.}}</ref>
