== Introduction ==

The Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland surveys the long-term development of [[species diversity]] in selected organism groups in [[Switzerland]]. The focus is on surveying common and widespread [[species]] in order to make informed statements about the development of species diversity in common landscapes.<ref>[https://www.nzz.ch/article86F0Y-1.398772 ''Die Biodiversität beobachten - Nach wie vor eine vielfältige Flora in der Schweiz.''] Neue Zürcher Zeitung.

Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland is a programme run by the [[Federal Office for the Environment|Federal Office for the Environment FOEN]]. It is a long-term [[environmental monitoring]] project, comparable with other national programmes, such as the Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI),<ref>[https://www.lfi.ch/lfi/lfi-en.php?lang=en ''The Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI).''] Website of the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL.

The objectives of the Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland are to<ref name = "foen technical report" >FOEN: ''Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring BDM. Description of Methods and Indicators.'' Environmental Studies No. 1410, Federal Office for the Environment FOEN, Bern, 2014.</ref>
* draw representative conclusions about biodiversity in Switzerland as a whole (sometimes broken down by biogeographic region or main type of land use, e.g. grassland, forests, settlements etc.);
* monitor the evolution of species diversity as a whole, i.e. including in intensively used areas and therefore draw conclusions about the common landscape;
* record the taxonomic groups in full, i.e. including all species, and thus supplement existing knowledge on rare and endangered species;
* document changes in species diversity and highlight long-term trends.

== Methodology ==

[[File:Csm Probeflaeche Z7 D.jpg|thumb|1-km<sup>2</sup> sampling area for the “species diversity in landscapes” indicator with a transect marked]]
[[File:Csm Probeflaeche Z9 D.jpg|thumb|10-m<sup>2</sup> sampling area for the “species diversity in habitats” indicator]]

The Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland comprises three sampling grids on different scales, which cover the whole of Switzerland and yield a [[Sampling (statistics)|representative sample]].<ref name="foen technical report" />

The sampling grid to observe species diversity in landscapes consists of some 450 sampling areas, each covering one square kilometre. On a precisely defined [[transect]] of this quadrant, [[vascular plant]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]] and breeding birds are surveyed. Data on breeding birds are collected by the [[Sempach Bird Observatory|Swiss Ornithological Institute Sempach]]. These surveys are coordinated with the Monitoring of Common Breeding Birds.<ref>[https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/projects/monitoring/monitoring-common-breeding-birds ''Monitoring of Common Breeding Birds.''] Website of the Swiss Ornithological Institute Sempach. Retrieved 2019-01-22.</ref> The density of the sampling grid in the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]] and in Southern Switzerland was increased in order to obtain reliable data for these regions.

The sampling grid to observe species diversity in habitats consists of some 1,450 sampling sites, each covering ten square metres. In terms of [[habitat]]s a distinction is drawn between forests, dry meadows and pastures, settlements, farmland, alpine pastures and mountain areas. All the vascular plants found in a circular sampling area are surveyed. In addition, [[bryophyte]] samples are collected, which are subsequently identified by a team of experts, and soil samples are taken to study [[Mollusca|mollusc]] diversity in the laboratory.

The sampling grid to survey aquatic insects comprises approximately 500 small sections of minor watercourses measuring around 5–100 metres long. It surveys the [[larva]]e of [[mayflies]], [[stoneflies]] and [[caddisflies]] (so-called EPT species group).

</gallery>

The sampling areas can be precisely located as they are permanent observation plots. A fifth of all areas are surveyed every year, which means that a survey is repeated at the same location every five years. Routine surveys of vascular plants, bryophytes, molluscs and breeding birds were started in 2001, with surveys of butterflies added in 2003 and aquatic [[invertebrate]]s added in 2010. The species’ coordinates are integrated in the databases of InfoSpecies, the Swiss Information Centre for Species.<ref>[https://www.infospecies.ch/de/ ''InfoSpecies.''] Website of the Swiss Information Centre for Species (German and French only).

== Indicators ==

The data obtained are routinely used to calculate four [[Environmental indicator|indicators]]:<ref name="sample design">BDM Coordination Unit: ''Sample Design of Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland (BDM)''.

* The species diversity in landscapes indicator shows the diversity of flora and fauna in the landscape. It describes the influence of habitat mosaics on species diversity.
* The species diversity in habitats indicator documents the small-scale species diversity of a habitat type, e.g. dry meadows, forests or settlements.
* The population size of common species indicator documents changes in widespread species. They are of ecological importance as they make up the majority of living [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], provide a significant share of [[ecosystem service]]s and constitute an abundant food source for other organisms. They shape the appearance of their habitats and characterise entire landscapes.
* The diversity in species communities indicator looks at whether Switzerland's habitats and landscapes are becoming more similar. It therefore provides information on the heterogeneity or homogeneity of species diversity.

In addition, the data can be used for various special analyses. They form the basis of numerous scientific research projects.<ref>BDM Coordination Unit: ''Scientific Publications''.

== Distinctive features of the Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland ==

The specific contribution of the Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland to the analysis of species diversity in Switzerland is the fact that species lists can be drawn up that are as comprehensive as possible for all sampling areas, which increases the probability of detecting species absences. In addition, the Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland is not restricted to well-known, highly species-rich areas or sites where rarities are found, but rather monitors randomly selected locations that would hardly ever be surveyed otherwise. Common and widespread species are thus also surveyed. Repeat surveys at exactly the same location using exactly the same method allow precise conclusions to be drawn regarding changes in species diversity.

Biodiversity Monitoring Switzerland provides a cross section of the overall landscape covering a wide variety of uses. It serves as a reference for programmes that study the development of selected habitats or of specific rare species, e.g. the project “Monitoring the effectiveness of habitat conservation in Switzerland” (WBS),<ref name="wbs" /> launched by the FOEN and the [[Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research|Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (WSL)]], and Switzerland's [[IUCN Red List|Red Lists]].<ref>[https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/de/home/themen/biodiversitaet/zustand/biodiversitaet--monitoringprogramme/rote-listen.html ''Rote Listen der Schweiz.''] Website of the Federal Office for the Environment FOEN (German, French and Italian only).
