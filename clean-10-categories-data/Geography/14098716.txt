The '''Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea''' was a conference held in [[London]] in June of 1917. 
==History==
The Conference established the [[nautical date line]] and adopted an ideal form of the terrestrial [[time zone]] system for use at sea. It recommended that time changes required by changes of [[longitude]] be made in one-hour steps. This recommendation was adopted between 1920 and 1925 by all major fleets, including [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]] and [[United States|American]]. The rules applied to almost all naval ships and to many non-naval ships. Nevertheless, up to the [[Second World War]], the old practice of keeping local apparent time prevailed on many independent merchant ships.
==Current usage==
The nautical date line is implied but not explicitly drawn on time zone maps. It follows the [[180th meridian|180° meridian]] except where it is interrupted by [[territorial waters]] adjacent to land, forming gaps: it is a pole-to-pole dashed line. Ships are required to adopt the [[standard time]] of a country when they are within its territorial waters, but must revert to international time zones (15° wide pole-to-pole gores) as soon as they leave territorial waters. The 15° gore that is offset from [[GMT]] or [[UT1]] (not [[UTC]]) by twelve hours is bisected by the nautical date line into two 7.5° gores that differ from GMT by ±12 hours.

In reality nautical time zones are used only for radio communication etc. Internally on the ship, e.g. for work and meal hours, the ship may use a suitable time of its own choosing. This includes fixed installations such as oil rigs. For example, the Norwegian [[Ekofisk]] oil rigs are located in international water at longitude 3°E but use Norwegian time.
