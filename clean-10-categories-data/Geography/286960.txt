'''Mainland''' is defined as "relating to or forming the main part of a [[country]] or [[continent]], not including the islands around it [regardless of status under territorial jurisdiction by an entity]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/mainland|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720090300/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/mainland|archivedate=2017-07-20|title=MAINLAND &#124; definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary}}</ref> The term is often [[human geography|politically, economically and/or demographically]] more significant than [[political geography|politically associated]] [[Outlying territory|remote territories]], such as [[exclaves]] or [[oceanic islands]] situated outside the [[continental shelf]].

In geography, "mainland" can denote the [[continent]]al (i.e. non-insular) part of any [[polity]] or the main island within an [[island nation]]. In [[geopolitics]], "mainland" is sometimes used interchangeably with terms like [[Metropolis#Metropolis as a mainland area|Metropole]] as an antonym to [[overseas territories]]. In the sense of "[[wikt:heartland|heartland]]", mainland is the opposite of [[wikt:periphery|periphery]]. In some language a separate concept of "mainland" is missing and is replaced with a "continental portion".

The term is relative - in [[Tasmania]], [[mainland Australia|continental Australia]] is the mainland, while to residents of [[Flinders Island]], the main island of Tasmania is also "the mainland", although the [[geological]] [[Australian continent]] includes all the former plus the island of [[New Guinea]] and all the smaller islands (e.g. the [[Torres Strait Islands]]) in between.

* [[Geography of Taiwan|Mainland Taiwan]], as opposed to [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], [[Penghu]] and other [[List of islands of Taiwan|islands of Taiwan]]
** The cause of the dispute is [[Political status of Taiwan|Taiwan's uncertain sovereignty]].

* [[Great Britain|Mainland Britain]], as opposed to [[Northern Ireland]]

**Additionally, [[Western media]] frequently refer to the relationship between the ''[[de facto]]'' independent state of [[Taiwan]] (Republic of China) and the PRC as that of an island to its mainland. This is done in order to tacitly support the [[Taiwan,China|PRC's territorial claim to Taiwan]]. This is highly controversial among supporters of [[Taiwan independence movement|Taiwanese independence]]. Within Taiwan, [[Pan-Blue Coalition|pro-China]] politicians have popularised this phrase as well.
