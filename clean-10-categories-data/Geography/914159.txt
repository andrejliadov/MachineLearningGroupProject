An '''alluvial plain''' is a largely flat [[landform]] created by the deposition of [[sediment]] over a long period of time by one or more [[river]]s coming from highland regions, from which [[Alluvium|alluvial]] soil forms. A [[floodplain]] is part of the process, being the smaller area over which the rivers flood at a particular period of time, whereas the alluvial plain is the larger area representing the region over which the floodplains have shifted over geological time.

As the highlands [[erosion|erode]] due to [[weathering]] and water flow, the [[sediment]] from the hills is [[sediment transport|transported]] to the lower [[plain]]. Various [[stream|creek]]s will carry the water further to a river, [[lake]], [[bay]], or [[ocean]]. As the sediments are deposited during flood conditions in the [[floodplain]] of a creek, the elevation of the floodplain will be raised. As this reduces the channel floodwater capacity, the creek will, over time, seek new, lower paths, forming a [[meander]] (a curving sinuous path). The leftover higher locations, typically natural [[levee]]s at the margins of the flood channel, will themselves be eroded by lateral stream erosion and from local rainfall and possibly wind transport if the climate is arid and does not support soil-holding grasses. These processes, over geologic time, will form the plain, a region with little [[relief]] (local changes in elevation), yet with a constant but small slope.

The ''Glossary of Landform and Geologic Terms'', maintained by the United States' [[National Cooperative Soil Survey]], defines an "alluvial plain" as "a large assemblage of fluvial landforms (braided streams, terraces, etc.,) that form low gradient, regional ramps along the flanks of mountains and extend great distances from their sources (e.g., High Plains of North America)"  Use of "alluvial plain" as a general, informal term for a broad flood plain or a low-gradient delta is explicitly discouraged.  The NCSS glossary instead suggests "flood plain".<ref name="LandformGloss">{{cite web | url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/PA_NRCSConsumption/download?cid=nrcs142p2_053182&ext=pdf | title=Glossary of Landform and Geologic Terms | publisher=[[National Cooperative Soil Survey]] | work=National Soil Survey Handbook—Part 629 | date=April 2013 | format=PDF | access-date=17 August 2016}}</ref>
