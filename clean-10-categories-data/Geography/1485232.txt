In '''[[surveying]]''', a baseline is a line between two points on the earth's surface and the direction and distance between them. In a [[triangulation (surveying)|triangulation]] network, at least one baseline between two [[triangulation station|stations]] needs to be measured to calculate the size of the triangles by trigonometry.

In the United States [[Public Land Survey System]], a '''baseline''' is the principal east-west line (i.e., a [[Circle of latitude|parallel]]) upon which all rectangular surveys in a defined area are based. The baseline meets its corresponding [[principal meridian]] at the point of origin, or ''[[initial point]]'', for the land survey. For example, the baseline for [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]] is shared as the border for both states, at the [[40th parallel north]].

More specifically a '''baseline''' may be the line that divides a [[survey township]] between north and south.

=="Baseline Road" in the United States==
Many communities in the United States have roads that run along survey baselines, many of which are named to reflect that fact. Some examples:

* In [[Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]], [[Arkansas Highway 338|Baseline Road]] follows the baseline used by surveyors of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. 
* In [[Colorado]], [[Baseline Road (Colorado)|Baseline Road]] in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] marks the [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]], or the western extension of the Kansas-Nebraska boundary, which is also the boundary between [[Adams County, Colorado|Adams]] and [[Weld County, Colorado|Weld]] counties.  
* In [[Arizona]], the baseline near the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] metro area is marked by [[Baseline Road (Arizona)|Baseline Road]]. 
* In Southern California, from Highland to San Dimas, the baseline is marked by [[Baseline Road (California)|Baseline Road]]. 
* In Michigan, the baseline for the [[Michigan Survey]] forms the boundary between the second and third tiers of counties and in many portions, discontinuous segments of road along the baseline are known as "[[Baseline Road (Michigan)|Baseline Road]]."  [[8 Mile Road]] in the [[Detroit]] area runs along the [[Michigan]] Baseline and was formerly known as "Baseline Road."  
* Baseline Road in Hillsboro, Oregon, generally follows the Willamette Baseline which intersects the Willamette Meridian at the [[Willamette Stone|Willamette Stone State Park]].

==Canada==
In Canadian land surveying, a '''base line''' is one of the many principal east-west lines that correspond to four tiers of townships (two tiers north and two south). The base lines are about {{convert|24|mi|km}} apart, with the first base line at the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], the western [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]]. It is, therefore equivalent to the ''standard parallel'' in the US system.

===Ontario===

In Ontario, a baseline forms a straight line parallel a geographical feature (mostly a lake, especially [[Lake Ontario]] or [[Lake Erie]]) that serves as a reference line for surveying a grid of property lots. The result of this surveying is the [[concession road|concession road and sideline]] system in use today.

Many prominent Ontario baselines lie on the surveyed boundaries of land treaties signed with [[First Nations]] peoples. For example, several baselines in [[Waterloo Region]] and [[Brant County]] (including [[Wilmot Line]], [[Brant-Oxford Road]], and [[Indian Line]]) follow the borders of the [[Haldimand Proclamation|Haldimant Tract]] land grant to the [[Six Nations of the Grand River|Six Nations confederacy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grandrivercountry.org/haldimand-tract/|title=Haldimand Tract|website=Grand River Country|accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref> leading to the patchwork road and lot network, surveyed parallel to the western edge of the tract, which can seen in this area to this day. [[Jones Baseline]] which runs through [[Wellington County, Ontario|Wellington County]] and [[Regional Municipality of Halton|Halton Region]] follows the original survey route marked by [[Augustus Jones]] after the [[Between the Lakes Purchase]] in 1792.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wellingtonadvertiser.com/augustus-jones-determined-present-day-county-boundaries/|title=Augustus Jones determined present-day county boundaries|author=Stephen Thorning|date=1 Feb 1995|website=Wellington Advertiser|accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>
