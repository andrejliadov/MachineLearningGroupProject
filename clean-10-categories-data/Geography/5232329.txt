The term '''collective landscape''' was introduced to [[landscape design]] and [[landscape planning]] by [[Geoffrey Jellicoe|Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe]]. He wrote, on the dust jacket of his book:
::''The landscape of man'', that '' "The world is moving into a phase when landscape design may well be recognized as the most comprehensive of the arts. Man creates around him an environment that is a projection into nature of his abstract ideas. It is only in the present century that the '''collective landscape''' has emerged as a social necessity. We are promoting a landscape art on a scale never conceived of in history." ''

==Definitions==
It appears that the term was inspired by [[Carl Jung]]'s use of the term [[collective unconscious]]. Jellicoe admired Jung, but the use of 'collective landscape' in the above quotation has something in common with its use in [[collectivism]]. Unlike the terms [[public park]] and [[national park]], the term collective landscape is a psychological construct and an abstract concept.

'Collective landscape' is therefore best understood as a landscape which:
* exists in the collective unconscious
* like other [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s, does not belong to any individual

==Contemporary applications==
In American contemporary [[landscape architecture]] the term 'collective landscape' is used to mean 'landscape which matters to the community' as in the following quotation from the ''Smokey Mountain News'' for the week of 10/12/05: '' "The struggle to preserve a '''collective landscape''' heritage has been fought and won by the Cherokee once in the past, but is now at risk again." ''
