The '''Inuvialuit Settlement Region''' (ISR), known as '''Inuvialuit Nunangit Sannaiqtuaq''' (INS) in [[Inuvialuktun]], located in Canada's western [[Arctic]], was designated in 1984 in the Inuvialuit Final Agreement by the [[Government of Canada]] for the [[Inuvialuit]] people.

[[Inuvik]], located on the East Channel of the Mackenzie Delta, approximately {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the [[Arctic Ocean]], is the region's administrative centre, home to the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation. The only other inland community, [[Aklavik]], is located on the Peel Channel. [[Hunting]], [[fishing]] and [[trapping]] are the major economic activities of [[Paulatuk]], in [[Amundsen Gulf]]'s [[Darnley Bay]], and [[Sachs Harbour]], the only permanent settlement on [[Banks Island]]. [[Tuktoyaktuk]], formerly known as "Port Brabant", is set on Kugmallit Bay, near the Mackenzie River Delta. It has the only deepwater port in the ISR. [[Ulukhaktok]], formerly known as "Holman", is located on the west coast of [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]]. Printmaking has taken over as the primary source of income in recent years. [[Herschel Island]], which is uninhabited, is part of the ISR although in [[Yukon]] and was traditionally used by the Inuvialuit.

English is spoken in the entire region. Additionally, [[Siglitun]] is spoken in Paulatuk, Sachs Harbour and Tuktoyaktuk. [[Uummarmiutun]] is spoken in Inuvik and Aklavik. [[Inuinnaqtun]] is spoken in Ulukhaktok and nowhere else in the Northwest Territories.<ref name="Balanoff">{{cite web|url=http://www.nwt.literacy.ca/resources/research/way/way.pdf|title="This is the way we were told": Multiple literacies in Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories|last=Balanoff|first=Helen|author2=Cynthia Chambers|author3=Alice Kaodloak|author4=Emily Kudlak|date=2006|work=Presented at the 15th International Inuit Studies Conference|publisher=nwt.literacy.ca|pages=2|accessdate=2009-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324220512/http://www.nwt.literacy.ca/resources/research/way/way.pdf|archive-date=2009-03-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> Together they are grouped under [[Inuvialuktun]].
