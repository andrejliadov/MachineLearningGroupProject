An '''online locator service''' (also known as '''location finder''', '''store finder''', or '''store locator''', or similar) is a feature found on websites of businesses with multiple locations that allows visitors to the site to find locations of the business within proximity of an [[address (geography)|address]] or [[postal code]] or within a selected region.<ref name="one">Henriette Martel-Lawson [https://books.google.com/books?id=jvF-iSYd-84C&pg=RA1-PA183&dq=%22store+locator%22&as_brr=3&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html 200 Marketing Ideas for Your Website], Marketing Cues, 2004 {{ISBN|0-9752186-0-3}}, p. 183</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hhIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA36&dq=%22store+locator%22&as_brr=3&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html Network World]. June 17, 1991.</ref> Types of businesses that often have this feature include [[chain store|chain retailers]], [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and other businesses that can be found in multiple [[metropolitan area]]s.

The locator also provides important information about each location, including its address, phone number, hours of operation, services provided, and sometimes directions to the location.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VA8AAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA120&dq=%22store+locator%22&as_brr=3&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html Log Home Design], November 2000</ref> On many sites, searches can be narrowed to locations providing certain services not provided at all locations (e.g. 24-hour operation, handicap accessibility, pharmacies).

Location finders often operate in conjunction with a well-known online map service, such as [[Google Maps]], [[MapQuest]], or [[Bing Maps]], allowing the user to see on a map where the particular location is found on a map.<ref name="one" />
==Software==
Store locators use ''locator software'' in order to allow visitors to find nearby stores and business locations. In a common form, a visitor inputs a [[ZIP code]] and the locator returns all locations in a [[database]] within a specified [[radius]]. It is often used in conjunction with mapping/driving direction software on [[brick and click]] [[corporate website]]s to help customers locate a physical business location.

Some online locators determine user location from the user's IP address, rather than asking a user to input his or her location. The company utilizes IP geolocation software from [[Digital Element]] to power the “My Local Ace” section of its website. Based on a site visitor’s location, the website can show the visitor how many stores are in their area, as well as a city-level locator map to help the customer find the store closest to their address.<ref>[http://www.gsicommerce.com/assets/docs/pdf/generic/CSA-AceHardware-Nov08.pdf Chain Store Age, “Making it Personal”, November, 2008]</ref>
