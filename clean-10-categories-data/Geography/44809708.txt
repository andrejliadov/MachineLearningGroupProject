{{for|the Galician municipality|Alfoz}}
The [[Geography|geographical]] term '''alfoz''' (plural ''alfoces'') was used in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] during the [[Middle Ages]] to describe the [[rural]] territory, including villages and localities, belonging to a corresponding town, or ''villa'' in Spanish (not to be confused with [[villa]], a type of residence). The villa and its alfoz, under the authority of the town government (''concejo''), constituted what was called a ''Comunidad de Villa y Tierra'', an [[autonomous]] political division within the kingdom. At the center of this community, the villa (or sometimes a city) comprised an [[urban area]] and often a castle and a fortified wall.

By the 12th century, the alfoces had fiscal, judicial and military functions.<ref name="O'Callaghan2013">{{cite book|last=O'Callaghan|first=Joseph F.|title=A History of Medieval Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVMJAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA269|accessdate=December 4, 2014|date=April 15, 2013|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-6871-1|pages=269–271}}</ref> Furthermore, they lent themselves to the communal use of land for [[Silvopasture|silvopastoral]] agriculture; however, in the year 1100, the Spanish kings began to allocate portions of land to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[nobility]], an act that undermined the very purpose of the alfoz.

The alfoz and its villa formed what would later be known as a [[municipality]]. The word alfoz comes from the [[Arabic]] ''al-hawz'', meaning "rural district",<ref>{{cite journal |last= Estepa Díez|first= Carlos|date= 1984|title= El alfoz castellano en los siglos IX al XII.|url= http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/ELEM/article/view/ELEM8484120305A|language= Spanish|journal= En la España Medieval|publisher= Universidad Complutense de Madrid|issue= 4|issn= 0214-3038|page= 310|accessdate=December 22, 2014}}</ref> and remains to this day an element of many place names in Spanish geography.
