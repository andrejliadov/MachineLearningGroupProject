A '''biome''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|oʊ|m}} is a community of [[flora|plants]] and [[fauna|animals]] that have common characteristics for the [[natural environment|environment]] they exist in. They can be found over a range of continents. Biomes are distinct biological [[community (ecology)|communities]] that have formed in response to a shared physical [[climate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/index.php|title=The world's biomes|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|access-date=2008-11-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204035155/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/index.php|archive-date=2008-12-04|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Ecology|last=Cain|first=Michael|last2=Bowman|first2=William|last3=Hacker|first3=Sally|publisher=Sinauer|year=2014|isbn=9780878939084|edition=Third|location=Massachusetts|pages=51}}</ref>  ''Biome'' is a broader term than ''[[habitat]]''; any biome can comprise a variety of habitats.

While a biome can cover large areas, a microbiome is a mix of organisms that coexist in a defined space on a much smaller scale.  For example, the [[human microbiome]] is the collection of bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that are present on or in a human body.<ref>{{cite web|title=Finally, A Map Of All The Microbes On Your Body|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/06/13/154913334/finally-a-map-of-all-the-microbes-on-your-body|website=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416013033/https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/06/13/154913334/finally-a-map-of-all-the-microbes-on-your-body|archive-date=2018-04-16|url-status=live}}</ref>

A 'biota' is the total collection of organisms of a geographic region or a time period, from local geographic scales and instantaneous temporal scales all the way up to whole-planet and whole-timescale spatiotemporal scales. The biotas of the Earth make up the [[biosphere]].

==History of the concept==
The term was suggested in 1916 by [[Frederic Clements|Clements]], originally as a synonym for [[biotic community]] of [[Karl Möbius|Möbius]] (1877).<ref>Clements, F. E. 1917. The development and structure of biotic communities. ''J. Ecology'' 5:120–121. Abstract of a talk in 1916, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2255652?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007005736/http://www.jstor.org/stable/2255652?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |date=2016-10-07 }}.</ref> Later, it gained its current definition, based on earlier concepts of [[physiognomy|phytophysiognomy]], [[formation (vegetation)|formation]] and [[vegetation]] (used in opposition to [[flora]]), with the inclusion of the animal element and the exclusion of the taxonomic element of species composition.<ref name="Coutinho">Coutinho, L.

However, in some contexts, the term biome is used in a different manner. In German literature, particularly in the [[Heinrich Walter|Walter]] terminology, the term is used similarly as [[biotope]] (a concrete geographical unit), while the biome definition used in this article is used as an international, non-regional, terminology—irrespectively of the continent in which an area is present, it takes the same biome name—and corresponds to his "zonobiome", "orobiome" and "pedobiome" (biomes determined by climate zone, altitude or soil).<ref name="WalterBreckle">Walter, H. & Breckle, S-W.

In Brazilian literature, the term "biome" is sometimes used as synonym of "[[biogeographic province]]", an area based on species composition (the term "[[floristic province]]" being used when plant species are considered), or also as synonym of the "morphoclimatic and phytogeographical domain" of [[Aziz Ab'Sáber|Ab'Sáber]], a geographic space with subcontinental dimensions, with the predominance of similar geomorphologic and climatic characteristics, and of a certain vegetation form. Both include many biomes in fact.<ref name="Coutinho" /><ref>Batalha, M.A. (2011). The Brazilian cerrado is not a biome.

==Classifications==

To divide the world into a few ecological zones is difficult, notably because of the small-scale variations that exist everywhere on earth and because of the gradual changeover from one biome to the other. Their boundaries must therefore be drawn arbitrarily and their characterization made according to the average conditions that predominate in them.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Schultz |first1=Jürgen |date=1995 |title=The ecozones of the world |pages=2–3 |isbn=3540582932  }}</ref>

A 1978 study on North American grasslands<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sims|first1=Phillip L.|last2=Singh|first2=J.S.|title=The Structure and Function of Ten Western North American Grasslands: III. Net Primary Production, Turnover and Efficiencies of Energy Capture and Water Use|journal=Journal of Ecology|date=July 1978|volume=66|issue=2|pages=573–597|publisher=British Ecological Society|doi=10.2307/2259152|jstor=2259152}}</ref> found a positive [[Logistic regression|logistic correlation]] between [[evapotranspiration]] in mm/yr and above-ground net primary production in g/m<sup>2</sup>/yr. The general results from the study were that precipitation and water use led to above-ground primary production, while [[Sunlight|solar irradiation]] and temperature lead to below-ground primary production (roots), and temperature and water lead to cool and warm season growth habit.<ref>Pomeroy, Lawrence R. and James J. Alberts, editors. Concepts of Ecosystem Ecology. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1988.</ref>  These findings help explain the categories used in Holdridge's bioclassification scheme (see below), which were then later simplified by Whittaker. The number of classification schemes and the variety of determinants used in those schemes, however, should be taken as strong indicators that biomes do not fit perfectly into the classification schemes created.

{{Main|Holdridge life zones}}
Holdridge classified climates based on the biological effects of temperature and [[rainfall]] on [[vegetation]] under the assumption that these two [[abiotic]] factors are the largest determinants of the types of vegetation found in a habitat. Holdridge uses the four axes to define 30 so-called "humidity provinces", which are clearly visible in his diagram. While this scheme largely ignores soil and sun exposure, Holdridge acknowledged that these were important.

===Whittaker (1962, 1970, 1975) biome-types===
[[File:Climate influence on terrestrial biome.svg|thumb|The distribution of vegetation types as a function of mean annual temperature and precipitation.]]
[[Robert Harding Whittaker|Whittaker]] classified biomes using two abiotic factors: precipitation and temperature. His scheme can be seen as a simplification of Holdridge's; more readily accessible, but missing Holdridge's greater specificity.

Whittaker based his approach on theoretical assertions and empirical sampling. He was in a unique position to make such a holistic assertion because he had previously compiled a review of biome classifications.<ref>Whittaker, Robert H., Botanical Review, Classification of Natural Communities, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Jan–Mar 1962), pp. 1–239.</ref>

====Key definitions for understanding Whittaker's scheme====
* [[Physiognomy]]: the apparent characteristics, outward features, or appearance of ecological communities or species.
* Biome: a grouping of terrestrial ecosystems on a given continent that is similar in vegetation structure, physiognomy, features of the environment and characteristics of their animal communities.
* [[Formation (vegetation)|Formation]]: a major kind of community of plants on a given continent.
* Biome-type: grouping of convergent biomes or formations of different continents, defined by physiognomy.
* Formation-type: a grouping of convergent formations.

Whittaker's distinction between biome and formation can be simplified: formation is used when applied to [[plant communities]] only, while biome is used when concerned with both plants and animals. Whittaker's convention of biome-type or formation-type is simply a broader method to categorize similar communities.<ref name="Whittaker1975">Whittaker, Robert H. Communities and Ecosystems. New York: MacMillan Publishing Company, Inc., 1975.</ref> <!---The world biome-types, as displayed on a world map, can be viewed at the following link: [http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/biomemap.html here] (This link is now dead.)--->

====Whittaker's parameters for classifying biome-types====

Whittaker, seeing the need for a simpler way to express the relationship of community structure to the environment, used what he called "gradient analysis" of [[ecocline]] patterns to relate communities to climate on a worldwide scale. Whittaker considered four main ecoclines in the terrestrial realm.<ref name="Whittaker1975"/>
# Intertidal levels: The wetness gradient of areas that are exposed to alternating water and dryness with intensities that vary by location from high to low tide
# Climatic moisture gradient
# Temperature gradient by altitude
# Temperature gradient by latitude

Along these gradients, Whittaker noted several trends that allowed him to qualitatively establish biome-types:
* The gradient runs from favorable to the extreme, with corresponding changes in productivity.
* Changes in physiognomic complexity vary with how favorable of an environment exists (decreasing community structure and reduction of stratal differentiation as the environment becomes less favorable).
* Trends in the diversity of structure follow trends in species diversity; alpha and beta species diversities decrease from favorable to extreme environments.
* Each growth-form (i.e. grasses, shrubs, etc.) has its characteristic place of maximum importance along the ecoclines.
* The same growth forms may be dominant in similar environments in widely different parts of the world.

Whittaker summed the effects of gradients (3) and (4) to get an overall temperature gradient and combined this with a gradient (2), the moisture gradient, to express the above conclusions in what is known as the Whittaker classification scheme. The scheme graphs average annual precipitation (x-axis) versus average annual temperature (y-axis) to classify biome-types.

===Walter (1976, 2002) zonobiomes===

The eponymously-named [[Heinrich Walter]] classification scheme considers the seasonality of temperature and precipitation. The system, also assessing precipitation and temperature, finds nine major biome types, with the important climate traits and [[vegetation type]]s. The boundaries of each biome correlate to the conditions of moisture and cold stress that are strong determinants of plant form, and therefore the vegetation that defines the region. Extreme conditions, such as flooding in a swamp, can create different kinds of communities within the same biome.<ref name="WalterBreckle"/><ref>Walter, H. 1976.

This classification is used to define the [[Global 200]] list of [[ecoregion]]s identified by the WWF as priorities for conservation.<ref name="Olson1998" />

For the [[terrestrial ecoregions]], there is a specific EcoID, format XXnnNN (XX is the [[biogeographic realm]], nn is the biome number, NN is the individual number).

===Anthropogenic biomes===
{{further|Anthropogenic biome}}

Humans have altered global patterns of [[biodiversity]] and ecosystem processes. As a result, vegetation forms predicted by conventional biome systems can no longer be observed across much of Earth's land surface as they have been replaced by crop and rangelands or cities. [[Anthropogenic biomes]] provide an alternative view of the terrestrial biosphere based on global patterns of sustained direct human interaction with ecosystems, including [[agriculture]], [[human settlement]]s, [[urbanization]], [[forestry]] and other [[land use|uses of land]]. Anthropogenic biomes offer a new way forward in ecology and conservation by recognizing the irreversible coupling of human and ecological systems at global scales and moving us toward an understanding of how best to live in and manage our biosphere and the anthropogenic biomes we live in.

Major anthropogenic biomes:
* Dense settlements
* [[Cropland]]s
* [[Rangeland]]s
* Forested
* Indoor<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/science/the-next-frontier-the-great-indoors.html?ref=science|title = The Next Frontier: The Great Indoors|last = Zimmer|first = Carl|date = March 19, 2015|work = [[The New York Times]]|access-date = March 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180614024514/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/science/the-next-frontier-the-great-indoors.html?ref=science|archive-date = June 14, 2018|url-status = live}}</ref>
