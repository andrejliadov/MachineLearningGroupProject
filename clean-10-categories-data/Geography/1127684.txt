A '''polar ice cap''' or '''polar cap''' is a high-[[latitude]] region of a [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], or [[natural satellite]] that is covered in [[ice]].<ref>[http://nsidc.org/cgi-bin/words/letter.pl?P The National Snow and Ice Data Center Glossary] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710225721/http://nsidc.org/cgi-bin/words/letter.pl?P |date=10 July 2009 }}</ref>

There are no requirements with respect to size or composition for a body of ice to be termed a polar ice cap, nor any geological requirement for it to be over land, but only that it must be a body of solid phase matter in the [[polar region]]. This causes the term "polar ice cap" to be something of a misnomer, as the term [[ice cap]] itself is applied more narrowly to bodies that are over land, and cover less than 50,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>: larger bodies are referred to as [[ice sheets]].

The composition of the ice will vary. For example, Earth's polar caps are mainly water ice, whereas [[Mars]]'s polar ice caps are a mixture of [[Dry ice|solid carbon dioxide]] and water ice.

Polar ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy in the form of [[solar radiation]] from the Sun than [[equator]]ial regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.

Earth's polar caps have changed dramatically over the last 12,000 years. [[Season]]al variations of the ice caps takes place due to varied solar energy absorption as the planet or moon revolves around the Sun. Additionally, in geologic time scales, the ice caps may grow or shrink due to [[climate]] variation.

===North Pole===
{{see also|Arctic sea ice decline}}
Earth's [[North Pole]] is covered by floating [[pack ice]] ([[sea ice]]) over the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Portions of the ice that do not melt seasonally can get very thick, up to 3–4 meters thick over large areas, with ridges up to 20 meters thick.  One-year ice is usually about 1 meter thick.  The area covered by sea ice ranges between 9 and 12&nbsp;million km<sup>2</sup>. In addition, the [[Greenland ice sheet]] covers about 1.71&nbsp;million km<sup>2</sup> and contains about 2.6&nbsp;million km³ of ice. When the ice breaks off (calves) it forms icebergs scattered around the northern Atlantic.<ref>

According to the [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]], "since 1979, winter Arctic ice extent has decreased about 4.2 percent per decade". Both 2008 and 2009 had a minimum Arctic sea ice extent somewhat above that of 2007. At other times of the year the ice extent is still sometimes near the 1979–2000 average, as in April 2010, by the data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.<ref>

===South Pole===

Earth's [[south pole|south polar]] land mass, [[Antarctica]], is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]].  It covers an area of about 14.6&nbsp;million km<sup>2</sup> and contains between 25 and 30&nbsp;million km<sup>3</sup> of ice. Around 70% of the [[fresh water]] on Earth is contained in this ice sheet.

Data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center shows that the sea ice coverage of Antarctica has a slightly positive trend over the last three decades (1979–2009).<ref>

===Historical cases===
Over the past several decades, Earth's polar ice caps have gained significant attention because of the alarming decrease in land and sea ice. [[NASA]] reports that since the late 1970s, the [[Arctic]] has lost an average of 20,800 square miles (53,900 square kilometers) of sea ice per year while the [[Antarctic]] has gained an average of 7,300 square miles (18,900&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of sea ice per year. At the same time, the Arctic has been losing around 50 cubic kilometers (gigatons) of land ice per year, almost entirely from Greenland's 2.6&nbsp;million gigaton sheet. On 19 September 2014, for the first time since 1979, Antarctic sea ice extent exceeded 7.72&nbsp;million square miles (20&nbsp;million square kilometers), according to the [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]]. The [[ice extent]] stayed above this benchmark extent for several days. The average maximum extent between 1981 and 2010 was 7.23&nbsp;million square miles (18.72&nbsp;million square kilometers). The single-day maximum extent in 2014 was reached on 20 Sep, according to [[NSIDC]] data, when the sea ice covered  7.78&nbsp;million square miles (20.14&nbsp;million square kilometers). The 2014 five-day average maximum was reached on 22 Sep, when sea ice covered 7.76&nbsp;million square miles (20.11&nbsp;million square kilometers), according to [[NSIDC]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Antarctic Sea Ice Reaches New Record Maximum|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/antarctic-sea-ice-reaches-new-record-maximum|publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|access-date=10 May 2017}}</ref>

The current rate of decline of the ice caps has caused many investigations and discoveries on glacier dynamics and their influence on the world's climate. In the early 1950s, scientists and engineers from the US Army began drilling into polar ice caps for geological insight. These studies resulted in “nearly forty years of research experience and achievements in deep polar [[ice core]] drillings... and established the fundamental drilling technology for retrieving deep ice cores for climatologic archives.” <ref>{{cite journal|last=Langway|first=Chester|title=The history of early polar ice cores, Cold Regions Science and Technology|date=April 2008|volume=52|issue=2|pages=101–117}}</ref> Polar ice caps have been used to track current climate patterns but also patterns over the past several thousands years from the traces of {{chem|CO<sub>2</sub>}} and {{chem|CH<sub>4</sub>}} found trapped in the ice. In the past decade, polar ice caps have shown their most rapid decline in size with no true sign of recovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thewatchers.adorraeli.com/2011/03/10/polar-ice-is-melting-more-faster-than-predicted/|title=Polar ice is melting more faster than predicted|publisher=The Watchers|access-date=18 May 2015}}</ref> Josefino Comiso, a senior research scientist at NASA, found that the “rate of warming in the Arctic over the last 20 years is eight times the rate of warming over the last 100 years.”<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Elvia |title=Recent Warming of Arctic May Affect Worldwide Climate |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/1023esuice.html |publisher=[[NASA]] |access-date=2 October 2012}}</ref> In September 2012, sea ice reached its smallest size ever.

In addition to Earth, the planet [[Mars]] also has polar ice caps.  They consist of primarily water-ice with a few percent dust.<ref>{{cite journal | title=North polar deposits of Mars: Extreme purity of the water ice |author1=Grima, Cyril G. |author2=Kofman, W. |author3=Mouginot, J. |author4=Phillips, R.

Data collected in 2001 from NASA missions to Mars show that the southern residual ice cap undergoes sublimation inter-annually.  The most widely accepted explanation is that fluctuations in the planet's orbit are causing the changes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070228-mars-warming.html | title=Mars Melt Hints at Solar, Not Human, Cause for Warming, Scientist Says | first=Kate | last=Ravilious | work=[[National Geographic News]] | publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] | date=28 February 2007 | access-date=28 October 2008 }}</ref>
