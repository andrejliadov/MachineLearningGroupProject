The '''Stroke Belt''' or '''Stroke Alley''' is a region in the [[southeastern United States]] that has been recognized by public health authorities for having an unusually high incidence of [[stroke]] and other forms of [[cardiovascular disease]]. It is usually defined as a 11-state region consisting of [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Virginia]]. It is often disputed if [[Texas]] belongs in the Stroke Belt. 

Although many possible causes for the high stroke incidence have been investigated, the reasons for the phenomenon have not been determined.

==History of observations==
[[File:Lung cancer US distribution.gif|thumb|350px|High rates of lung cancer (indicated in this map by brown colors) are highly correlated with the Stroke Belt.]]
The stroke belt was first identified in 1962 by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control (CDC)]] researchers who noted a concentration of high stroke [[mortality rate|death rate]]s in the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] counties of [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref name=friedfat>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/14/health/main673897.shtml Combating Southern Fried Fat], CBS News, February 14, 2005</ref> Similar high stroke rates were later observed in the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain|Mississippi Delta]] region as well.<ref name=friedfat/><ref name=Casper>{{cite journal |vauthors=Casper ML, Wing S, Anda RF, Knowles M, Pollard RA |title=The shifting stroke belt.

Analysis by the CDC of U.S. [[mortality rate|mortality statistics]] from the period 1991 to 1998 found that for both [[African American|blacks]] and [[White people|white]]s the [[U.S. county|counties]] with the highest stroke death rates were in the southeastern states and the [[Mississippi Delta]] region. Stroke death rates for states ranged from a high of 169 per 100,000 in South Carolina to a low of 89 per 100,000 in [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r030220.htm CDC Releases Atlas of Stroke Mortality] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011181803/http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r030220.htm |date=2008-10-11 }}, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention & Health Promotion, February 20, 2003</ref> While most observational studies have focused primarily on stroke incidence in adults, in 2004 researchers reported that children in the eleven stroke belt states also have an increased risk of death from [[stroke#Ischemic|ischemic]] and [[stroke#Hemorrhagic|hemorrhagic stroke]] compared with children in other states.<ref name=Pediatric>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fullerton HJ, Elkins JS, Johnston SC |title=Pediatric Stroke Belt: geographic variation in stroke mortality in US children |journal=Stroke |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=1570–3 |date=Jul 2004 |pmid=15178830 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000130514.21773.95 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/35/7/1570|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Glymour et al. (2007) reported that adults who had resided in the stroke belt during childhood and had moved outside the region had higher stroke risk at ages 50 and older than adults who grew up in areas with lower stroke incidence.<ref name=WornChildhood/> A study reported in 2011 found that people over age 45 living in the eight "stroke belt" states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee had an 18 percent higher incidence of cognitive decline than people in other U.S. regions. Another researcher noted that, "Stroke by itself is a major contributor to cognitive impairment and dementia."<ref>Mary Elizabeth Dallas, [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_112521.html U.S. Southeast 'Stroke Belt' Also Shows Higher Rates of Cognitive Decline], ''Health Day'' (MedLine Plus), May 26, 2011</ref> Other researchers have made similar observations.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=El-Saed A, Kuller LH |title=Is the stroke belt worn from childhood?: current knowledge and future directions |journal=Stroke |volume=38 |issue=9 |pages=2403–4 |date=Sep 2007 |pmid=17673801 |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.487405 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/strokeaha;38/9/2403|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Kuźma|first=Elżbieta|last2=Lourida|first2=Ilianna|last3=Moore|first3=Sarah F.|last4=Levine|first4=Deborah A.|last5=Ukoumunne|first5=Obioha C.|last6=Llewellyn|first6=David J.|date=August 2018|title=Stroke and dementia risk: A systematic review and meta-analysis|url=https://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(18)33250-3/abstract|journal=Alzheimer's & Dementia|language=en|volume=0|issue=11|pages=1416–1426|doi=10.1016/j.jalz.2018.06.3061|pmid=30177276|pmc=6231970|issn=1552-5260}}</ref>

==Hypotheses on causation==
[[File:Census2000 Percent Black Map.jpg|thumb|350px|Black percentage of the population, US Census 2000.]]
The causes of the elevated incidence of stroke in the stroke belt region have not been determined.<ref name=Casper/><ref name=WornChildhood>{{cite journal |vauthors=Glymour MM, Avendaño M, Berkman LF |title=Is the 'stroke belt' worn from childhood?: risk of first stroke and state of residence in childhood and adulthood |journal=Stroke |volume=38 |issue=9 |pages=2415–21 |date=Sep 2007 |pmid=17673716 |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.482059 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/38/9/2415|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name=SBEI/><ref name=Newsweek>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/117733 Stroke Mystery], ''[[Newsweek]]'', November 8, 2005</ref> Numerous possible contributing factors have been identified, including hypertension, low [[socioeconomic status]], diet, cultural lifestyle, quality of healthcare facilities, [[smoking]], and [[infection]]s.<ref name=Nainggolan/> Among the specific factors that have been proposed or studied are the following:

* It has been suggested that the higher stroke death rates in the stroke belt are due to the region's high [[African American]] population, because African Americans' stroke death rates are higher than the national average.<ref>African American males age 45 to 54 have a threefold greater risk of ischemic stroke than white males in the same age range.[http://www.strokecenter.org/patients/stats.htm]</ref> However, because White people also have higher rates of stroke death in the stroke belt than in other parts of the country, the higher death rates in the stroke belt cannot be attributed solely to the region's higher proportion of African Americans.<ref name=Lessons/>
* In the early 1990s it was hypothesized that [[selenium]] deficiency in the [[soil]]s of the coastal plain might be a causative factor.<ref>Felicity Barringer, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DD1431F93AA15754C0A964958260 Toward Solving the Mystery Of the American 'Stroke Belt' ], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 29, 1992</ref> The subsequent recognition of high stroke incidence in areas with different soil characteristics led researchers to reject this hypothesis.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/DHDSP/library/maps/strokeatlas/02-introduction.htm Introduction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124032446/http://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/library/maps/strokeatlas/02-introduction.htm |date=2009-11-24 }}, ''Atlas of Stroke Mortality: Racial, Ethnic, and Geographic Disparities in the United States'' (Casper ML, Barnett E, Williams GI Jr., Halverson JA, Braham VE, Greenlund KJ).

*Some observers have assumed that more stroke belt residents suffer from untreated [[hypertension]]. However, researchers have found that residents of the [[southern United States]] are as likely to be aware of hypertension and receiving treatment as residents of other U.S. regions.<ref name=Nainggolan>Lisa Nainggolan, [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/538637 Hypertension may not be the whole story in the Stroke Belt], Medscape Medical News, February 9, 2005</ref> Additionally, researchers who documented the region's elevated incidence of pediatric stroke noted that "If the stroke belt is solely caused by regional differences in [[Stroke#Risk factors|atherosclerotic stroke risk factors]], it should not apply to children."<ref name=Pediatric/>
*It has been suggested that one cause of higher mortality may be the predominantly rural character of the region, which increases the distances that patients must travel to obtain emergency medical treatment.<ref name=Newsweek/> Regional differences in standards of medical care have also been suggested as a contributing factor. In one study, researchers found that patients discharged from hospitals in the stroke belt after suffering acute [[myocardial infarction]] were less likely to be treated with [[warfarin]] than patients in most other U.S. regions.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BJI/is_/ai_63690758 Stroke Belt — A Standard of Care Phenomenon?], Family Practice News, June 1, 2000</ref>
*Glymour et al. (2007) suggested that the higher stroke incidence in the stroke belt is related to experiences or exposures in childhood.<ref name=WornChildhood/>
*It has been proposed that [[poverty]] and [[malnutrition]] in previous generations, which resulted in poor maternal [[prenatal care|prenatal nutrition]] and [[low birth weight]]s, led to a predisposition to cardiovascular disease in adult life.<ref>[http://www.obgyn.net/newsheadlines/womens_health-Stroke-20030714-32.asp Risk may be associated with mother's health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011205656/http://www.obgyn.net/newsheadlines/womens_health-Stroke-20030714-32.asp |date=2008-10-11 }}, Health & Medicine Week, July 14, 2003</ref>
*[[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]]s high in [[fried foods|fried]] and high-[[fat]] foods (such as [[fried chicken]] or [[fried fish]]<ref name=fish>{{cite news|last=Bakalar|first=Nicholas|title=Diet: Fried Fish Is Seen as a ‘Stroke Belt’ Culprit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/04/health/research/04diet.html|access-date=3 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 January 2011}}</ref>), which are prevalent in the region, are thought to contribute to higher risk.<ref name=friedfat/>

==Public health initiatives to reduce stroke incidence in the region==

The [[U.S. federal government]] has conducted [[public health]] programs specifically aimed at reducing stroke incidence and mortality in the stroke belt. In the 1990s the Stroke Belt Initiative operated in eleven stroke belt states, providing [[nutrition]] education, blood pressure screening, [[smoking cessation]] programs, [[weight loss]] programs, and other health promotion and public education initiatives targeted at [[Stroke#Risk factors|stroke risk factors]].<ref name=Lessons/>

In 2004, the Stroke Belt Elimination Initiative of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] awarded [[grant (money)|grant]]s aimed at reducing the high incidence of stroke and high rates of stroke death and disability in the seven states with the highest rates of stroke (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee).<ref name=SBEI>{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040805.html |title=HHS Announces Initiative to Reduce the Incidence of Stroke in Stroke Belt States |type=press release |publisher=Department of Health and Human Services |date=August 5, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031175118/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040805.html |archive-date=October 31, 2004}}</ref>

==Origins==

The term "stroke belt" is modeled after [[Belt regions of the United States|similar terms used for U.S. regions]] such as "[[snowbelt]]" and "[[Sun Belt]]",<ref>[http://www.wordspy.com/words/strokebelt.asp WordSpy website], posted on March 25, 2003</ref> which extend the analogy to the [[Belt (clothing)|belt as an article of clothing]].  The [[coastal plain]] counties of the Carolinas and Georgia &mdash; where the stroke belt phenomenon was first described, and where stroke incidence is highest &mdash; are sometimes called the "[[buckle]] of the stroke belt" or the "stroke buckle".<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Howard G, Anderson R, Johnson NJ, Sorlie P, Russell G, Howard VJ |title=Evaluation of social status as a contributing factor to the stroke belt region of the United States |journal=Stroke |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=936–40 |date=May 1997 |pmid=9158628 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9158628 |doi=10.1161/01.str.28.5.936}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=I |first=Shrira |last2=N |first2=Christenfeld |last3=G |first3=Howard |date=2008 |title=Exposure to the US Stroke Buckle as a Risk Factor for Cerebrovascular Mortality |journal=Neuroepidemiology |language=en |doi=10.1159/000128102 |pmc=2821430 |pmid=18437029}}</ref>
