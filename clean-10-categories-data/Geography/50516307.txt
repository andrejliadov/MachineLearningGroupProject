'''Primary Care Service Areas''' are geographic areas that are self-sufficient markets of [[primary care]]. These areas are designed in a manner such that the majority of patients living in these areas use primary care services form within the area. This ensures that any [[geographic targeting]] of policies and resources reach the patients they are meant for. These geographies have been created in Australia,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mazumdar | first1 = S. | last2 = Feng| first2 = X. | last3 = Konings| first3 = P. | last4 = McRae | first4 = I. | last5 = Girosi | first5 = F. |year = 2014 | title = A brief report on Primary Care Service Area catchment geographies in New South Wales Australia.| journal = International Journal of Health Geographics| volume = 13 | issue =38 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1186/1476-072X-13-38| pmid = 25292210 | pmc = 4197238 }}</ref> United States <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = D. | last2 = Mick| first2 = S. | last3 = Bott | first3 = D. | last4 = Stukel | first4 = T. | last5 = Chang | first5 = CH. | last6 = Marth | first6 = N. | last7 = Boag | first7 = J. | last8 = Carretta | first8 = HJ. |year = 2003 | title = Primary care service areas: a new tool for the evaluation of primary care services.| pmid = 12650392 | journal = Health Serv Res| volume = 38 | issue =1 | pages = 287–309 | doi = 10.1111/1475-6773.00116 | pmc=1360885}}</ref> and Switzerland <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Busato | first1 = A. | last2 = Kunzi| first2 = B.|year = 2008 | title = Primary care physician supply and other key determinants of health care utilisation: the case of Switzerland.| journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 8 | issue =1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-8-8 | pmid = 18190705 | pmc = 2242783 }}</ref> using [[big data]] and [[Geographic information systems]].

However, they have found an especially wide audience amongst policymakers and researchers in the United States,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = D. | last2 = Mick| first2 = S. | last3 = Bott | first3 = D. | last4 = Stukel | first4 = T. | last5 = Chang | first5 = CH. | last6 = Marth | first6 = N. | last7 = Boag | first7 = J. | last8 = Carretta | first8 = HJ. |year = 2003 | title = Primary care service areas: a new tool for the evaluation of primary care services.| pmid = 12650392 | journal = Health Serv Res| volume = 38 | issue =1 | pages = 287–309 | doi = 10.1111/1475-6773.00116 | pmc=1360885}}</ref>  where they were first developed. Thus for example the Health Resources and Services Administration uses them to designate areas of workforce shortage. Primary Care Service Areas are thus for example an appropriate geography for measuring  primary care [[physician supply]] or geographic access to [[General practitioners]].
