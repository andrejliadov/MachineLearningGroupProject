This is a list of '''extreme points of Earth''', the geographical locations that are farther north or south than, higher or lower in elevation than, or farthest inland or out to sea from, any other locations on the [[landmass]]es, [[continent]]s or [[country|countries]].

For other lists of extreme points on Earth, including places that hold temperature and weather records, see [[Extremes on Earth]], [[Lists of extreme points]], and [[List of weather records]].

==Earth==
===Latitude and longitude===
* The '''northernmost point on Earth''' is the [[Geographic North Pole]], in the [[Arctic Ocean]].
** The '''[[Most northerly point of land|northernmost point on land]]''' is the northern tip of [[Kaffeklubben Island]], north of [[Greenland]] ({{Coord|83|40|N|29|50|W|type:landmark|name=northernmost point on land}}), which lies slightly north of [[Cape Morris Jesup]], Greenland ({{Coord|83|38|N|32|40|W|type:landmark|name=Cape Morris Jesup}}). Various shifting [[gravel bar]]s lie farther north, the most famous being [[Oodaaq]].  There have been other islands more northern such as [[83-42]] and [[ATOW1996]] but they are not confirmed as permanent.
* The '''southernmost point on Earth''' and the '''southernmost point on land''' is the [[South Pole#Geography|geographic South Pole]], which is on the [[continent]] of [[Antarctica]].
** The '''southernmost point of (liquid) [[water]]''' is a bay on the [[Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf]] along the coast of Antarctica ({{Coord|83|S|59|W}}){{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} about {{cvt|100|km}} south of [[Berkner Island]], the southernmost island in the world. The '''southernmost point of [[ocean]]''' is located on the [[Gould Coast]] ({{Coord|84|30|S|150|0|W|type:landmark|name=southernmost point of ocean}});{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}<ref>[http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=gnispq:5:0::NO::P5_ANTAR_ID:5881 Gould Coast] US Geographic Survey.</ref> the '''southernmost point of [[open ocean]]''' is also part of the [[Ross Sea]], namely the [[Bay of Whales]] at 78°30'S, at the edge of the [[Ross Ice Shelf]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Bay-of-Whales|title=Bay of Whales - former bay, Antarctica|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]}}</ref>
* The '''westernmost and easternmost points on Earth''', based on the east–west standard for describing [[longitude]], can be found anywhere along the [[180th meridian]] in [[Siberia]] (including [[Wrangel Island]]), Antarctica, or the three islands of [[Fiji]] through which the 180th meridian passes ([[Vanua Levu]]'s eastern peninsula, the middle of [[Taveuni]], and the western part of [[Rabi Island]]).
** Using the path of the [[International Date Line]], the '''westernmost point on land''' is [[Attu Island]], [[Alaska]], and the '''easternmost point on land''' is [[Caroline Island]], [[Kiribati]].<ref name=Kiribati group=note>[http://www.trussel.com/kir/dateline.htm A 1995 realignment of the International Date Line] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628045504/http://trussel.com/kir/dateline.htm |date=28 June 2006 }} moved all of Kiribati to the Asian side of the Date Line, causing Caroline Island to be the easternmost. However, if the previous Date Line were followed, the easternmost point would be Tafahi Niuatoputapu, in the Tonga Islands chain.</ref>

===Elevation===

====Highest points====
[[File:Volcán Chimborazo, "El Taita Chimborazo".jpg|thumb|[[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] in [[Ecuador]] is the farthest point from Earth's centre.]]

* The '''highest point on Earth's surface''' measured from [[sea level]] is the summit of [[Mount Everest]] on the border of [[Nepal]] and [[China]]. While [[Mount Everest#Surveys|measurements of its height]] vary slightly, the elevation of its peak was most recently established in 2020 by the Nepali and Chinese authorities as {{cvt|8848.86|m|ft|0}} above sea level <ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/12/new-height-of-mount-everest-announced-by-china-and-nepal/|title= Mount Everest is more than two feet taller, China and Nepal announce|work=nationalgeographib.com}}</ref> It was first reached by Sir [[Edmund Hillary]] of [[New Zealand]] and Sherpa of Nepal [[Tenzing Norgay]] in 1953.
* The '''point farthest from Earth's centre''' is the summit of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geology.com/records/highest-mountain-in-the-world.shtml |title=Highest Mountain in the World |work=geology.com}}</ref> in [[Ecuador]], at {{cvt|6384.4|km|mi|1}} from Earth's centre; the peak's elevation relative to sea level is {{cvt|6263.47|m|ft|0}}.{{#tag:ref|The elevation given here was established by a [[GPS]] survey in February 2016. The survey was carried out by a team from the [[Institut de recherche pour le développement|French Research Institute for Development]], working in cooperation with the [[Ecuador]]ian Military Geographic Institute.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chimborazo, el volcán de Ecuador más alto que el Everest (si se mide desde el centro de la Tierra) |publisher=[[BBC Mundo]] |date=7 April 2016 |url=http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2016/04/160407_por_que_chimborazo_ecuador_mas_lejos_centro_tierra_que_el_everest_dgm |access-date=2016-04-08}}</ref>|name="elev"|group="note"}} This is because Earth is an [[flattening|oblate]] [[spheroid]] rather than a perfect [[spherical Earth|sphere]]; it is [[equatorial bulge|wider]] at the [[Equator]] and narrower between the [[geographical pole|poles]]. Therefore, the summit of Chimborazo, which is near the Equator, is farther away from Earth's centre than the summit of Mount Everest is; the latter is {{cvt|2168|m|ft|1}} closer, at {{cvt|6382.3|km|mi|1}} from Earth's centre. [[Peru]]'s [[Huascarán]] (at {{cvt|6768|m|ft|0|disp=or}}) contends closely with Chimborazo, the difference in the mountains' heights being just {{cvt|23|m|ft|}}.
* The '''fastest point on Earth''' or, in other words, '''the point furthest from the axis of Earth''' is the summit of [[Cayambe (volcano)|Cayambe]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Klenke |first1=Paul |title=Distance to the Center of the Earth |url=https://www.summitpost.org/distance-to-the-center-of-the-earth/849764 |website=Summit Post |access-date=4 July 2018}}</ref> in Ecuador, at {{cvt|1675.89|km/h|mph|}} and {{cvt|6383.95|km|mi|}} from the axis. Like Chimborazo, which is the fourth fastest peak at {{cvt|1675.47|km/h|mph|}}, it is close to the Equator and takes advantage of the oblate spheroid [[figure of Earth]]. More importantly, however, it being so near the Equator means that the majority of its distance from Earth's centre goes into it being away from the axis.

=====Highest points attainable by transportation=====
* The '''highest point accessible...'''
**'''...by land vehicle''' is an elevation of {{cvt|6688|m|ft}} on [[Ojos del Salado]] in [[Chile]], which was reached by the Chilean duo of Gonzalo and Eduardo Canales Moya on 21 April 2007 with a modified [[Suzuki Samurai]], setting the high-altitude record for a four-wheeled vehicle.
** '''...by road (dead end)''' is on a mining road to the summit of [[Aucanquilcha]] in [[Chile]], which reaches an elevation of {{cvt|6176|m|ft|0}}. It was once usable by 20-tonne mining trucks.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McIntyre |first=Loren |title=The High Andes |journal=National Geographic |volume=171 |issue=4 |pages=422–460 |publisher=National Geographic Society |date=April 1987 }} (includes description and photos of [[Aucanquilcha]] summit road and mine)</ref> The road is no longer usable. {{Coord|21.214|S|68.475|W|display=inline}}
** '''...by road (mountain pass)''' is disputed; there are a number of competing claims for this title due to the definition of "motorable pass" (i.e. a surfaced road or one simply passable by a vehicle):
*** The '''highest [[asphalt concrete|asphalted]] road''' crosses [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]]'s [[Semo La]] pass at {{cvt|5565|m|0}}. It is used by trucks and buses regularly.<ref name="icc">{{Cite web| title = ICC – Semo Khardung| author = Assumpció Térmens| website = viewfinderpanoramas.org| publisher = Institut Cartogràfic de Catalunya| date = 2006-03-20| accessdate = 2017-02-05| url = http://viewfinderpanoramas.org/ICCSemoKhardung.pdf| language = en}}</ref> The [[Ticlio]] pass, on the Central Road of Peru, is the highest surfaced road in the Americas, at an elevation of {{cvt|4818|m}}.
*** The '''highest unsurfaced road''' is claimed by several different roads. All are unsurfaced or gravel roads including the barely passable road to Umling, LA, {{cvt|17|km|mi}} west of [[Demchok, Ladakh|Demchok]] in [[Ladakh]], [[India]], which reaches {{cvt|5800|m|0}} ("19,300 feet" according to a [[Border Roads Organisation]] sign there that recognizes it as the "World's Highest Motorable Pass"),<ref>{{Cite web|title = Battle for the Highest Motorable Road|publisher = Motoroids|accessdate = 2017-10-17|url = https://www.motoroids.com/features/battle-for-the-highest-motorable-road-which-pass-takes-you-closest-to-the-stars/|language = en}}</ref> and [[Mana Pass]], between India and [[Tibet]], which is crossed by a gravel road reaching {{cvt|5610|m|0}}. The heavily trafficked [[Khardung La]] in Ladakh lies at {{cvt|5359|m|0}}. A possibly motorable gravel road crosses [[Marsimik La]] in Ladakh at {{cvt|5582|m|0}}.
** '''...by train''' is [[Tanggula Pass]], located on the [[Qinghai–Tibet Railway|Qinghai–Tibet (Qingzang) Railway]] in the [[Tanggula Mountains]] of Qinghai/Tibet, [[China]], at {{cvt|5072|m|0}}. The [[Tanggula railway station]] is the world's highest railway station at {{cvt|5068|m|0}}. Before the Qingzang Railway was built, the highest railway ran between [[Lima]] and [[Huancayo]] in Peru, reaching {{cvt|4829|m|0}} at [[Ticlio]].<ref name="highest_railway">{{cite web |title=Destination Guides – World's highest railway, Peru – Wanderlust Travel Magazine |last=Bennett |first=Suzy |publisher=Wanderlust Magazine |url=<!-- http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/article.php?page_id=510 -->http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/magazine/articles/destinations/a-train-journey-through-the-peruvian-andes |date=October 2003 |accessdate=10 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725012753/http://www.wanderlust.co.uk/magazine/articles/destinations/a-train-journey-through-the-peruvian-andes |archive-date=25 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
** '''...by oceangoing vessel''' is a segment of the [[Rhine–Main–Danube Canal]] between the [[Hilpoltstein]] and [[Neumarkt (district)|Bachhausen]] locks in [[Bavaria]], Germany. The locks artificially raise the surface level of the water in the canal to {{cvt|406|m|0}} above mean sea level, higher than any other [[lock (water navigation)|lock]] system in the world, making it the highest point currently accessible by oceangoing commercial watercraft.
[[Image:La Rinconada Peru.jpg|thumb|[[La Rinconada, Peru|La Rinconada]], [[Peru]]]]

=====Highest geographical features=====
* The '''highest volcano''' is [[Ojos del Salado]] on the Argentina–Chile border. It has the highest summit, {{cvt|6893|m|0}}, of any [[volcano]] on Earth.
* The '''highest natural lake''' is an unnamed crater lake on [[Ojos del Salado]] at {{cvt|6390|m|0}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andes.org.uk/peak-info-6000/ojos-del-salado-info.asp |title=Andes Website – Information about Ojos del Salado volcano, a high mountain in South America and the world's highest volcano |accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> on the Argentina side.

* The '''highest river''' is disputed; one candidate from many possibilities is the [[Ating Ho]], which flows into the [[Aong Tso]] (Hagung Tso), a large lake in Tibet, and has an elevation of about {{cvt|6100|m|0}} at its source at {{Coord|32|49|30|N|81|03|45|E|type:waterbody|name=Ating Ho (source)}}. A very large and high river is the [[Yarlung Tsangpo]] or upper [[Brahmaputra River]] in Tibet, whose main stem, the [[Maquan River]], has its source at about {{cvt|6020|m|0}} above sea level at {{Coord|30|48|59|N|82|42|45|E|type:waterbody_region:CN-54|name=Maquan River (source)}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.100gogo.com/bigben.htm |title=The Mystery of World's highest river and largest Canyon |accessdate=7 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921032822/http://www.100gogo.com/bigben.htm |archive-date=21 September 2007 }}</ref> Above these elevations, there are no constantly flowing rivers since the temperature is almost always below freezing.

====Poles of inaccessibility====
{{main|Pole of inaccessibility}}
Each [[continent]] has its own [[Pole of inaccessibility#Continental poles of inaccessibility|continental pole of inaccessibility]], defined as the place on the continent that is farthest from any ocean. Similarly, each ocean has its own [[Pole of inaccessibility#Oceanic poles of inaccessibility|oceanic pole of inaccessibility]], defined as the place in the ocean that is farthest from any land.

=====Continental=====
* The '''most distant point from an ocean''' is the Eurasian Pole of Inaccessibility (or "EPIA") {{Coord|46|17|N|86|40|E|name=Continental Pole of Inaccessibility}}, in [[China]]'s [[Xinjiang]] region near the border with Kazakhstan. Calculations have shown that this point, located in the [[Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert]], is {{cvt|2645|km}} from the nearest coastline. The nearest settlement to the EPIA is [[Suluk, Xinjiang|Suluk]] at {{Coord|46|15|N|86|50|E|name=Suluk}}, about {{cvt|11|km}} to the east.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} A 2007 study suggests that the historical calculation of the EPIA failed to recognize the point where the [[Gulf of Ob]] joins the Arctic Ocean, and proposes instead that varying definitions of coastline could result in other locations for the EPIA:

====Other places considered the most remote====
[[Image:Bouvet Island ISS017-E-16161 no text.JPG|thumb|[[Bouvet Island]]]]
* The '''most remote island''' is [[Bouvet Island]], a small, uninhabited island in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] that is a [[dependencies of Norway|dependency]] of [[Norway]]. It lies at coordinates {{Coord|54|26|S|3|24|E|type:landmark|name=most remote island}}. The nearest land is the uninhabited [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Antarctica]], over {{cvt|1600|km|0}} to the south. The nearest inhabited lands are [[Gough Island]], {{cvt|1845|km|0}} away, [[Tristan da Cunha]], {{cvt|2260|km|0}} away, and the coast of [[South Africa]], {{cvt|2580|km|0}} away.
* The title for '''most remote inhabited island or archipelago''' (the farthest away from any other permanently inhabited place) depends on how the question is interpreted. If the south Atlantic island [[Tristan da Cunha]] (population about 300) and its dependency [[Gough Island]] (with a small staffed research post), which are {{cvt|399|km|0}} from each other, are considered part of the same archipelago, or if Gough Island is not counted because it has no permanent residents, then Tristan da Cunha is the world's most remote inhabited island/archipelago: the main island, also called Tristan da Cunha, is {{cvt|2434|km|0}} from the island [[Saint Helena]], {{cvt|2816|km|0}} from [[South Africa]], and {{cvt|3360|km}} from South America. It is {{cvt|2260|km|0}} away from uninhabited [[Bouvet Island]]. However, if Gough and [[Tristan da Cunha]] are considered separately, they disqualify each other, and the most remote inhabited island is [[Easter Island]] in the South Pacific Ocean, which lies {{cvt|2075|km|mi}} from [[Pitcairn Island]] (about 50 residents in 2013), {{cvt|2606|km|0}} from [[Rikitea]] on the island of [[Mangareva]] (the nearest town with a population over 500), and {{cvt|3512|km|mi}} from the coast of [[Chile]] (the nearest continental point and the country of which Easter Island is part). The [[Kerguelen Islands]] in the southern Indian Ocean are another contender, lying {{cvt|1340|km|mi}} from the small [[Alfred Faure]] scientific station in [[Île de la Possession]], but otherwise more than {{cvt|3300|km|mi}} from the coast of [[Madagascar]] (the nearest permanently inhabited place), {{cvt|450|km|0}} northwest of the uninhabited [[Heard Island]] and [[McDonald Islands]] (both a part of [[Australia]]), and {{cvt|1440|km|mi}} from the non-permanent scientific station located in [[Île Amsterdam]].
* The '''most remote city...'''
** '''...with a population in excess of one million from the nearest city with a population in excess of one million''' is [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. The nearest city of comparable size or greater is [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], {{cvt|2168.9|km|mi}} away.<ref>[http://www.daftlogic.com/projects-google-maps-distance-calculator.htm Draft Logic – Google Maps Distance Calculator], accessed 4 September 2011</ref>
** '''...with a population in excess of one million from the nearest city with a population above 100,000''' is [[Perth]], Australia, located {{cvt|2138|km}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.travelmath.com/flying-distance/from/Perth,+Australia/to/Adelaide,+Australia |title=Flight Distance from Perth, Australia to Adelaide, Australia |work=travelmath.com}}</ref> away from [[Adelaide]], Australia.
** '''...with a population in excess of 100,000 from the nearest city of at least that population''' is [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], United States. The nearest city of comparable size or greater is [[San Francisco]], {{cvt|3850|km}} away.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityextremes.com/isolated.php |title=The Most Isolated Cities of the World |work=cityextremes.com}}</ref>
** '''...that is a national capital from the nearest national capital''' is a tie between [[Wellington]], New Zealand, and [[Canberra]], Australia, which are {{cvt|2326|km|0}} apart from each other. 
* The '''most remote airport in the world''' from another airport is [[Mataveri International Airport]] (IPC) on [[Easter Island]], which has a single runway for military and public use. It is located {{cvt|2603|km|0}} from [[Totegegie Airport]] (GMR; very few flights) in the [[Gambier Islands]], [[French Polynesia]] and {{cvt|3759|km|0}} from [[Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport|Santiago, Chile]] (SCL; a fairly large airport). In comparison, the airport at the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] (NZSP) is not very remote at all, being located only {{cvt|1355|km|mi|0}} from [[Williams Field]] (NZWD) near [[Ross Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=IPC-SCL%2CIPC-GMR%2CNZWD-NZSP&DU=km |title=Great Circle Mapper |work=gcmap.com}}</ref><!--but is it the most remote airport from city/inhabited place, or if not, which one is? especially when compare to Tibet's 2nd highest airport at 2011.-->

The pair of airports having scheduled flights having the greatest distance between them has been measured to be [[Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport]], which serves [[Palembang]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Benito Salas Airport]], which serves [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]], [[Colombia]], located about 10,819&nbsp;nautical&nbsp;miles (20,037&nbsp;km)<!-- EACH TO 5-DIGIT PRECISION --> apart.<ref>[http://www.gcmap.com/mapui?P=plm-nva&PC=%23ff0000&RC=%23000080&DU=nm&SU=kts Great Circle Mapper] Access date: 2020-06-11</ref>

===Centre===
* Since the Earth is a [[spheroid]], its centre (the [[core of the Earth|core]]) is thousands of kilometres beneath its [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. On the surface, the '''centre of the standard geographic model''' as viewed on a traditional world map is the point 0°, 0° (the [[coordinates]] of zero degrees latitude by zero degrees longitude), which is located in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] approximately {{cvt|614|km}} south of [[Accra]], [[Ghana]], in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. It lies at the intersection of the [[Equator]] and the [[IERS Reference Meridian|Prime Meridian]], is marked with a buoy and sometimes called [[Null Island]]. However, the selection for the Prime Meridian as the 0° longitude meridian is culturally and historically dependent and therefore geographically arbitrary.
* The '''[[Centre of population#World|centre of population]]''', the place to which there is the shortest average route for every individual human being in the world, could also be considered a "centre of the world". This point is located in the north of the [[Indian subcontinent]], although the precise location has never been calculated and is constantly shifting due to changes in the distribution of the human population across the planet.

===Longest lines between two points===

====Along constant latitude====
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
* The '''longest continuous east–west distance on land''' is {{cvt|10726|km}} along the latitude 48°24'53"N, from the west coast of France ([[Pointe de Corsen]], {{Coord|48|24|53|N|4|47|44|W}}) through [[Central Europe]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]] and [[China]], to a point on the east coast of Russia ({{Coord|48|24|53|N|140|6|3|E}}).
* The '''longest continuous east–west distance at sea''' is {{cvt|22471|km}} along the latitude 55°59'S, south of [[Cape Horn]], [[South America]].
** The '''longest continuous east–west distance at sea between two continents''' is {{cvt|15409|km}} along the latitude 18°39'12"N, from the coast of [[Hainan]], China ({{Coord|18|39|12|N|110|15|9|E}}) across the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the coast of [[Michoacán]], [[Mexico]] ({{Coord|18|39|12|N|103|42|6|W}}).

====Along constant longitude====
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
* The '''longest continuous north–south distance on land''' is {{cvt|7590|km}} along the meridian 99°1'30"E, from the northern tip of Siberia in the Russian Federation ({{Coord|76|13|6|N|99|1|30|E}}), through Mongolia, China, and [[Myanmar]], to a point on the south coast of [[Thailand]] ({{Coord|7|53|24|N|99|1|30|E}}).

** The longest in South America is {{cvt|7098|km}} along the meridian 70°2'W, from the north coast of [[Venezuela]] ({{Coord|11|30|30|N|70|2|0|W}}), through [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]], to the southern tip of [[Argentina]] ({{Coord|52|33|30|S|70|2|0|W}}).
** The longest in North America is {{cvt|5813|km}} along the meridian 97°52'30"W, from northern [[Canada]] ({{Coord|68|21|0|N|97|52|30|W}}), through the [[United States]], to southern Mexico ({{Coord|16|1|0|N|97|52|30|W}}).
* The '''longest continuous north–south distance at sea''' is {{cvt|15986|km}} along the meridian 34°45'45"W, from the coast of Eastern Greenland ({{Coord|66|23|45|N|34|45|45|W}}) across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf]], on the coast of Antarctica ({{Coord|77|37|0|S|34|45|45|W}}). The longest in the Pacific Ocean is {{cvt|15883|km}} along the meridian 172°8'30"W, from the coast of Siberia ({{Coord|64|45|0|N|172|8|30|W}}) to the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica ({{Coord|78|20|0|S|172|8|30|W}}).
* The '''meridian that crosses the greatest total distance on land''' (disregarding intervening bodies of water) is still to be determined. It is likely located in the vicinity of 22°E, which is the longest integer meridian that fits that criterion, crossing a total of {{cvt|13035|km}} of land through Europe ({{cvt|3370|km|disp=or}}), Africa ({{cvt|7458|km|disp=or}}), and Antarctica ({{cvt|2207|km|disp=or}}). More than 65% of the meridian's length is located on land. The meridian that crosses Giza Great Pyramid (31°08'3.69"E) is {{cvt|855|km}} shorter.
** The next six longest integer meridians by total distance over land are, in order:
*** 23°E: {{cvt|12953|km}} through Europe ({{cvt|3325|km|disp=or}}), Africa ({{cvt|7415|km|disp=or}}), and Antarctica ({{cvt|2214|km|disp=or}})

As distinct from all the aforementioned geodesic lines, which may appear straight but are actually arcs of great circles projected on the spheroidal surface of the earth and, accordingly, are not truly straight but rather curving lines, authentically straight lines can be projected through the interior of the earth between almost any two points on the surface of the earth (some extreme topographical situations being the rare exceptions). If a line projected from the summit of [[Cayambe (volcano)|Cayambe]] in [[Ecuador]] (see [[#Highest_points|highest points]]) to the axial centre of the earth is extended to its antipode on the island of [[Sumatra]], then the resulting diametrical line would be the longest truly straight line that could be produced anywhere on earth. As the variable circumference of the earth approaches {{convert|25000|mi|order=flip}}, such a maximum "diametrical" or "antipodal" line would be on the order of {{convert|8000|mi|order=flip}} long.
