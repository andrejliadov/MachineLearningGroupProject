The '''National Geographic GeoBee''' (called the '''National Geography Bee''' from 1989 to 2000 and the '''National Geographic Bee''' from 2001 to 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/education/student-experiences/geobee/|title=GeoBee|first=National Geographic|last=Society|website=www.nationalgeographic.org}}</ref> also referred to as the '''Nat Geo Bee''') is an annual [[geography]] contest sponsored by the [[National Geographic Society]]. The [[Communal work|bee]], held annually since 1989 (except 2020), is open to students in the fourth through eighth grades in participating schools from the [[United States]].<ref>http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geobee/</ref>

The entities represented at the national level come from all fifty [[U.S. states]], all the [[U.S. territories|territories]], the [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools]] (DoDDS), and the [[District of Columbia]].

The National Geographic Bee Finals was moderated by ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' host [[Alex Trebek]] for its first 25 years (1989-2013). However, at the [[25th National Geographic Bee|2013 National Geographic Bee]], Trebek announced that 2013 would be his last year hosting the Finals. Newscaster [[Soledad O'Brien]] took his place the following year, moderating the bee in [[26th National Geographic Bee|2014]] and [[27th National Geographic Bee|2015]]. O'Brien was then replaced by [[Mo Rocca]] in [[28th National Geographic Bee|2016]] and Rocca has been moderating the Bee since then.

The current champion is Nihar Janga, from [[Canyon Ridge Middle School]] in [[Austin, Texas]]. He is the 31st Champion. In 2020, the Bee was cancelled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name=update>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/education/student-experiences/geobee/|title=UPDATE ON THE 2020 GEOBEE|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d.|website=National Geographic|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> The 32nd annual edition will resume in 2022. The 2021 edition has also been cancelled due to a 75% drop in registrations based on the current situation.

==Procedure==

===School competitions===
The competition begins at the [[Elementary school (United States)|elementary school]] and middle school levels (4th grade - 8th grade) and usually occurs in November, December, or January. This competition requires at least 6 people to enter. Private schools, public schools, and homeschooled students are allowed to enter. Typically, between five and six million students are entered each year (any number of competitors may enter this competition). The two major stages in this competition are called the preliminary and the final stages. Often, the preliminary competition is further split into preliminary rounds and a semi-final. In the event of a tie, a [[tiebreaker]] round is held at the end of the preliminary rounds.

In the preliminary rounds, competitors are divided into groups of twenty and each contestant is asked one question from each of the seven themed rounds.  Categories include:
*[[Cultural geography|Cultural Geography]]
*[[Economic geography|Economic Geography]]
*[[Geography of the United States|Across-the-Country]], [[World (geography)|Around-the-World]]
*[[Science]]
* Geographic Comparisons
*[[Physical geography|Physical Geography]]
* Odd-Item-Out (a category where one contestant is given three choices, plus a description. The contestant must determine which of the three choices does not fit.)
Contestants are awarded 1 point per question. At the end of seven rounds, players with the top ten scores advance to the finals. In addition to the game, a player may ask for a repeat of a [[spelling]] during these rounds. However, they are restricted to only asking twice in duration of the entire geographic bee.

Quite often there is a [[Tie (draw)|tie]], in which case a semi-final tiebreaker round is needed. For example, if six players finished the preliminary rounds with eight points and fifteen finished with seven points, the six who finished with eight points automatically advance to the final competition. The fifteen with seven points move into the semi-final round where the top four are determined to fill the remainder of the seats in the finals. This is done by asking every player the same question at the same time and giving each player twelve seconds to write down the answer. Each question is automatically repeated twice.  Everyone reveals their answer at the end of the twelve seconds and players are eliminated on a single-elimination basis. If, using the above example of four open seats in the finals, there is a question where eight players are left in the semi-final round and three players get the question right, those three advance to the finals. The other five who got the question wrong will continue with the single-elimination procedure to determine which competitor will take the last open seat in the finals. A player cannot ask judges to spell or repeat words in the semi-final round.

The final competition consists of two parts: the final round and the championship round. Each of the ten finalists starts with a clean slate and is eliminated after two incorrect answers. This continues until the number of contestants drops from ten to two and a third-place finisher is determined. A player is not officially eliminated until the end of a series of questions, since if all but one competitor makes their second miss in that round, all the players stay in the competition. Again, a player may ask for a spelling or repeat on any question, but only once per question. Earlier in the round, questions may require oral answers or written answers from all the competitors at one time. Quite often, many of the earlier questions in this round contain visuals as part of the question, such as [[map]]s or pictures. Question examples in the past have included pictures of state quarters with the name rubbed off and maps of the US with national forests shown and numbered. Contestants, at the time, were given the name of the national forest and (he or she) must match states with trees. At the national level, competitions may include items such as [[flag]]s, [[musical instrument]]s, [[hat]]s, and even live animals. After a certain round, all questions must require oral answers only.

If there is a tie for the championship round or third place, there will be an elimination round. For example, if four players are left and three make their second mistake, the fourth advances to the championship round and the other three enter the tiebreaker. The moderator will then ask each of the three players, at the same time, to write their answers to the same question. In this special round, questions can be repeated by players but they cannot ask how to spell a given word. As a result, if one of three responses are correct, he or she will rise to the championship round and the other two will move to the tiebreaker round until a third-place winner determined.

In the championship round, both players start with a clean slate again. The moderator asks both contestants the same question at the same time, repeated twice, and both players have fifteen seconds to write their answer. Both players then show their answers and each player who wrote a correct answer receives one point. There are three questions in the championship round. The player with the most points at the end is the champion. If both players are tied at the end, the competition enters the championship tiebreaker round. The rules are the same as for the championship round, except that the last player to answer a question incorrectly is the runner-up.

In 2010, National Geographic partnered with mobile development company [[Concentric Sky]] to launch a series of official app-based study tools titled Geobee Challenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/web/business/24893551-46/concentric-national-geographic-skipper-sky.csp<|title=Tech company aiming high|last=Buri McDonald|first= Sherri|date=June 15, 2010|website=The Register-Guard|access-date= May 18, 2019}}</ref>

'''Qualifying Test '''

The Qualifying Test is the only part of the bee that is entirely written. Every school champion takes this test to see if he or she can qualify for the state bee. The test comprises 70 multiple choice questions, which must be completed in 60 minutes. The top 100 scorers in each state or territory advance to the state level competition. Beginning with the 2016 Bee, the Qualifying test is online, and no longer is administered on paper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patch.com/new-york/wantagh/wantagh-student-heading-states-national-geographic-bee|title= |last=Doyle|first=Heather|date=March 19, 2015|website=Patch|access-date=May 18, 2019}}
</ref>

===State and national competitions===
The winner of each school-level competition takes an online test, and the top 100 in each state or territory qualify for the State Bee. If there is a tie in the State Qualifying Test, all students in the tie get an invitation to the State Bee (i.e. there were 107 State Bee Qualifiers in the 2019 Michigan State Geographic Bee). The rules at the state level are same as that at the school level, except that there are eight preliminary rounds instead of seven and each player is limited to two repeats or spelling for all eight preliminary rounds. Players are also limited to two repeats or spellings in the final round if they qualify. All the state bees are held on the same date, at the same time (in early April or late March) at all locations. State bees originally occurred for the fifty states, five U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands), [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Department of Defense Dependent Schools]] (DoDDS), for a total of 57. In 1999, the state competitions for Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands were merged into one state competition known as the Pacific Territories, bringing the number down to 55. In 2009, the Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands competitions were merged into a single competition known as the Atlantic Territories, and since then there have only been 54 state and territory competitions.  For completions that involve students spread out across wide areas, such as the competitions like the DoDDS and Pacific Territories competitions, there is no in person competition such as in other states.  Instead, after winning the school bee, school champions from around these territories take a series of online tests to determine the territory champion.  The third-place finisher from each state receives $100, the second-place finisher $300, and the winner $1000.  The 54 state champions receive an all-expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C., for the national competition.

The rules at the national level are the same as those at the state, except that there are ten preliminary rounds instead of eight. There was previously a video part of the preliminary competition where students submitted a video worth six points, but was replaced by a written "GeoChallenge" worth ten points. The championship round can also consist of five questions instead of three. The competition is held over four days, with the preliminary rounds on the first day and the final rounds on the third. The national finals are held in late May at [[National Geographic Society]] headquarters in Washington, D.C. and are hosted by [[Mo Rocca]]. The ten finalists are guaranteed $1000. The third-place finisher receives a $5,000 college scholarship, the second-place finisher receives a $10,000 college scholarship, and the National Champion receives a $25,000 college scholarship, as well as a lifetime membership in the [[National Geographic Society]]. From 2009 to 2015, the National Champion also won a trip to the [[Galápagos Islands]]. In 2016, National Champion Rishi Nair won a trip to southeast [[Alaska]], including a stop at [[Glacier Bay National Park]]. This was because 2016 was the centenary of the [[National Park Service|U.S. National Park Service]]. 2017 National Champion, Pranay Varada, received a trip to the Galápagos Islands. The National Competition final round format is also different from state. Originally, it was the same format, but in 2012, National Geographic changed the format so that correct answers were worth points and competitors could earn extra points with bonus questions, with eliminations being every few rounds. In 2015, they changed the format once again. There are no longer bonus questions, and the first five rounds are USA based and worth one point for most questions. The fifth round is a “lightning round” where you are asked three rapid fire questions. Then, four students with the lowest scores are eliminated, a tie being broken with a tiebreaker about estimation. The next four rounds are global and are all worth two points per question, and end again with another lightning round. After this, the top three are left. There are two “GeoChallenges” in the final competition, one worth three points in round 3, and for the top ten a 45-second oral response worth six points. The top two then compete in a normal championship round.  In 2019, however, due to the introduction of a new competition that is called the “Geochallenge”(which is about developing a collaborative team project to tackle a given issue) they once again changed the format of the Bee.  The Semi-Finals, which consists of the top 10 contestants, is held on one day.  There are eight rounds of oral and written questions, and the four lowest scores are eliminated after these eight rounds.  Afterwards, there is a “Geochallenge” worth ten points, and three contestants are eliminated to narrow the competition down to the final three.  The next day, the top three contestants compete in the finals.  They have a series of five oral rounds, and then they have a Geochallenge round and a mapmaker round.  Afterwards, the lowest scoring contestant is eliminated, and a normal championship round occurs to determine the champion.

===International competition===
{{main|National Geographic World Championship}}
There was an [[National Geographic World Championship|international competition]], which was also moderated by [[Alex Trebek]], but it was run differently. The top finishers from each country's national competition formed a team representing their country and participated in an [[Olympics|Olympic]]-style event which included a team written competition and a team oral competition. The 2013 competition was held in [[Saint Petersburg, Russia]]. The 2015 [[National Geographic World Championship]], originally planned to take place in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], was canceled, and the competition was since put on hiatus.

===Criticism===
Some argue that the selection process of the National Geographic GeoBee competition is not well designed to reliably promote the most qualified contestants, as it leaves significant room for chance. This is due to the small number of questions and the fact that each contestant answers different questions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/bee/faq/|title=Page Not Found &#124; National Geographic Society|website=www.nationalgeographic.org}}</ref> Particularly, during the preliminary rounds contestants are eliminated with a single mistake if there are more than 9 perfect scores.
The fact that a single mistake is not a reliable indicator for a contestant's overall strength was demonstrated during the [[26th National Geographic Bee|2014 National competition]]. The preliminary rounds resulted in 9 contestants with perfect score who accordingly became finalists. The 10th spot was filled by tie breaker rounds between contestants who made a single mistake during the preliminaries and went to the Virginia champion [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140521-geography-bee-national-geographic-world-scholarship-students/ Akhil Rekulapelli], who then went on to win the finals. Again in 2019, Nihar Janga was involved in a tiebreaker to advance to the top 10, and he went on to win the entire competition.  Some also argue that the Geobee is becoming too focused on Geochallenge rounds instead of standard geography questions.  This was demonstrated in 2019, where more than half the total points in the semifinal and final rounds were based on these open ended “Geochallenge” questions.  Some also criticize the gender imbalance of the Geobee; only two girls have ever won the contest.

==Champions==

===National Champions===
Of the thirty-one National Geographic GeoBee champions, twenty-nine have been male and two were female. Five are from the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], five are from [[Texas]], four are from the state of [[Michigan]], two are from [[Kansas]], two are from [[New Jersey]], two are from [[Florida]], and various other states have been home to one champion each.
