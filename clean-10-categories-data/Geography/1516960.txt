{{short description|A summit never reached by mountaineers}}
[[File:Batura valley Passu.jpg|right|thumb|[[Muchu Chhish]] at far left is the tallest peak on Earth that is not off limits to climbers that remains still unclimbed as of 2020.]]
An '''unclimbed mountain''' is a mountain peak that has yet to be climbed to the top. Determining which unclimbed peak is highest is often a matter of controversy. In some parts of the world, surveying and mapping are still unreliable.  There are no comprehensive records of the routes of explorers, mountaineers, and local inhabitants. In some cases, even modern ascents by larger parties have been poorly documented and, with no universally recognized listing, the best that can be achieved in determining the world's highest unclimbed peaks is somewhat speculative. Most sources indicate that [[Gangkhar Puensum]] ({{convert|7570|m|ft}}) in [[Bhutan]] or on the Bhutan–[[China]] border is the tallest mountain in the world that has yet to be fully summited. Gangkhar Puensum has been off limits to climbers since 1994 when Bhutan prohibited all mountaineering above {{convert|6000|m|ft|abbr=on}} due to spiritual/religious beliefs.<ref name=nuwer>{{cite web|last1=Nuwer|first1=Rachel|title=The mountains we have never climbed|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140703-the-last-mountains-to-climb|publisher=BBC|access-date=14 February 2018|date=4 July 2014}}</ref>

Unclimbed mountains are sometimes referred to as "virgin peaks." Many virgin peaks exist because the mountain is unreachable, due to either geographic isolation or political instability. Some mountains remain off limits due to religious beliefs of a country or region that hold such mountains as sacred and should remain inviolate. Additionally, since the endeavor to scale taller mountains of the world is usually a major undertaking, lesser peaks, while still very formidable, simply get less attention than the taller ones, and instead these taller peaks are summited by parties following a new route or perhaps during the winter when conditions are generally more treacherous.<ref name=nuwer/>

==Challenges in definition==
===Definition of a mountain===
[[File:prominence_definition.svg|right|thumb|250px|Figure 1. Vertical arrows show the topographic prominence of three peaks on an island. The dashed horizontal lines show the lowest contours that do not encircle higher peaks. Curved arrows point from a peak to its parent.]]
Many mountains, in addition to their highest point or peak, will also have subsidiary subpeaks. Generally, the [[topographic prominence]] of a peak or subpeak, as well as the general topography, all come into consideration when determining whether such apexes are considered to be independent peaks or subpeaks. Although objective criteria have been proposed for distinguishing peaks from subpeaks, there is no widely agreed standard. In 1994, the [[International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation]] (UIAA) classified 82 mountain peaks in the [[Alps]] whose summits were at least {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level and with at least {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} of topographic prominence over any adjacent [[mountain pass]] or [[col]], as a distinct peak.<ref name="uiaa">{{cite web|title=Mountain Classification|url=http://www.theuiaa.org/mountaineering/mountain-classification/|publisher=UIAA-International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation|access-date=14 February 2018}}</ref>

===Verification of unclimbed status===
It can be difficult sometimes to determine whether or not a mountain peak has been fully summited. Long before modern mountaineering commenced in the middle of the 19th century, evidence indicates that people did indeed travel up to the summits or near to the summits of major mountain peaks. Archaeological excavations in the [[Andes]] have shown that humans travelled up to {{convert|6739|m|ft|abbr=on}} in pre-historic times.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reinhard|first1=Johan|last2=Ceruti|first2=Constanza|title=Inca Rituals and Sacred Mountains: A Study of the World's Highest Archaeological Sites|date=2010|publisher=Institute of Archaeology Press|isbn=9781931745765}}</ref> Permanent settlements as high as {{convert|4500|m|abbr=on}} were established as far back as 12,000&nbsp;years ago in the Andes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ghose|first1=Tia|title=Oldest High-Altitude Human Settlement Discovered in Andes|url=https://www.livescience.com/48419-high-altitude-setllement-peru.html|publisher=Live Science|access-date=14 March 2018|date=23 October 2014}}</ref> In the Greater Himalaya region, [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]], in Tibet, sitting at {{convert|3650|m|abbr=on}} has been permanently occupied since the 7th century and many smaller settlements across the Greater Himalaya thrive at elevations exceeding {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=Nicholas|title=Where are the world's highest cities?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/08/where-world-highest-cities-altitude|publisher=The Guardian|access-date=14 March 2018|date=8 February 2016}}</ref> With humans living at high elevations for many millennia, nearby peaks to such settlements may or may not have been summited at some point in the past. However, many regions away from settlements may never have been explored, especially since some high peaks in the [[Greater Ranges]] are so remote that they were unknown to local inhabitants until they were sighted by explorers.

The world's third tallest peak, [[Kangchenjunga]], has been summited a number of times, but after the first climbers of the peak agreed to honor the wishes of locals and not set foot on the topmost part of the mountain, succeeding mountaineering parties may have followed this tradition. Similarly, [[Nanda Devi]] has also been climbed but the topmost summit was not ascended and the primary summit is now off limits to climbers. [[Machapuchare]] had only one summit attempt back in 1957 when climbers came within {{convert|150|m|abbr=on}} of the summit; Nepal then banned future attempts.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Four Forbidden Mountains in the Himalayas|url=http://climbreport.net/4-forbidden-mountains-in-the-himalayas/|publisher=Climb Report|access-date=16 March 2018|date=6 March 2016}}</ref>

==Gangkhar Puensum==

The mountain most widely claimed to be the highest unclimbed mountain in the world in terms of [[elevation]] is [[Gangkhar Puensum]] ({{convert|7570|m|ft|abbr=on}}).<ref name="TI_2001">{{cite journal|author=Tsuguyasu Itami|title=Gankarpunzum & First Ascent Of Liankang Kangri|journal=Japanese Alpine News|date=October 2001|volume=1|url=http://www.jac.or.jp/english/jan/vol1/GANKARPUNZUM.pdf|access-date=14 March 2018 }}</ref> It is in [[Bhutan]], on or near the border with [[People's Republic of China|China]].

==Highest unclimbed non-prohibited peak==
[[File:Kabru2.jpg|left|thumb|A secondary summit of Kabru is one of the tallest that still remain unclimbed]]
It is unclear which is the highest unclimbed non-prohibited mountain. While some recognize only peaks with {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} of topographical prominence as individual summits, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation uses a {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} cutoff for determining individual summits. Based on the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation's criteria, [[Muchu Chhish]] ({{convert|7452|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a prominence of {{convert|263|m|ft|abbr=on}}) in Pakistan is currently the world's tallest that has not been climbed even though it is legal to do so. Other unclimbed summits include one on the massif known as [[Kabru]] ({{convert|7318|m|abbr=on}} prominence c. {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}}), [[Labuche Kang III/East]] ({{convert|7250|m|ft|abbr=on}}) with prominence of {{convert|570|m|abbr=on}} and [[Karjiang]] ({{convert|7221|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a prominence of {{convert|895|m|ft|abbr=on}}).<ref name="newcomb">{{cite web|last1=Newcomb|first1=Tim|title=7 of the Tallest Unclimbed Mountains in the World|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoors/g13537785/7-of-the-tallest-unclimbed-mountains-in-the-world/|publisher=Popular Mechanics|access-date=14 March 2018|date=19 January 2018}}</ref>

==Most prominent unclimbed peak==
Unclimbed candidates with high [[topographic prominence]] are by definition independent mountains, but some have relatively modest elevations. With such peaks there is a greater possibility of undocumented ascents, perhaps occurring long ago.

As of mid-2014 [[Sauyr Zhotasy]] ({{convert|3840|m|ft|abbr=on}}, prominence of {{convert|3252|m|ft|abbr=on}}), the highpoint in the [[Saur Mountains|Saur Range]] on the border between [[Kazakhstan]] and [[China]], and [[Mount Siple]] ({{convert|3110|m|ft|abbr=on}}, prominence of {{convert|3110|m|ft|abbr=on}}) on [[Siple Island]] off the coast of [[Antarctica]], have no record of successful ascents.<ref name=newcomb/>  The unclimbed status of each of these peaks is difficult to confirm, although Mount Siple in particular is remote, uninhabited (and without any nearby habitation), and seldom visited. The most recent remaining most prominent mountain summited (with a prominence of {{convert|12,169|ft|m|abbr=on}}) was in June of 2014 in the [[Finisterre Range]] of [[Papua New Guinea]].{{cn|date=October 2020}}
