'''Health geography''' is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]].

== Overview ==

The study of health geography has been influenced by repositioning [[medical geography]] within the field of [[social geography]] due to a shift towards a social model in health care, rather than a medical model. This advocates for the redefinition of health and health care away from prevention and treatment of illness only to one of promoting well-being in general.  Under this model, some previous illnesses (e.g., mental ill health) are recognized as behavior disturbances only, and other types of medicine (e.g., complementary or [[alternative medicine]] and [[traditional medicine]]) are studied by the [[medicine]] researchers, sometimes with the aid of health geographers without [[medical education]]. This shift changes the definition of care, no longer limiting it to spaces such as hospitals or doctor's offices. Also, the social model gives priority to the intimate encounters performed at non-traditional spaces of medicine and healthcare as well as to the individuals as [[health consumerism|health consumers]].<ref name= "Philo2">Philo, Chris (2009). "Health and Health Care". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.325-326</ref>

This alternative methodological approach means that medical geography is broadened to incorporate philosophies such as [[Political Economy#Current approaches|Marxian political economy]], [[structuralism]], [[interactionism|social interactionism]], [[humanism]], [[feminism]] and [[queer theory]].<ref name= "Philo">Philo, Chris (2009).

== History ==
The relationship between space and health dates back to [[Hippocrates]], who stated that "airs, waters, places" all played significant roles impacting human health and history.<ref name= "Philo" /> A classic piece of research in health geography was done in 1854 as [[Broad Street cholera outbreak|a cholera outbreak]] gripped a neighborhood in [[London]]. Death tolls rang around the clock and the people feared that they were being infected by vapors coming from the ground. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] predicted that if he could locate the source of the disease, it could be contained. He drew maps demonstrating the homes of people who had died of cholera and the locations of water pumps. He found that one pump, the public pump on Broad Street, was central to most of the victims. He concluded that infected water from the pump was the culprit.  He instructed the authorities to remove the handle to the pump, making it unusable. As a result, the number of new cholera cases decreased.

==Areas of study==
Health geography is considered to be divided into two distinct elements. The first of which is focused on geographies of disease and ill health, involving [[descriptive research]] quantifying disease frequencies and distributions, and [[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies|analytic research]] concerned with finding what characteristics make an individual or [[population]] susceptible to disease. This requires an understanding of [[epidemiology]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ocaña-Riola |first=Ricardo |year=2010 |title=Common errors in disease mapping |journal=Geospatial Health |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–54 |pmid=20503184 |url=http://www.geospatialhealth.unina.it/fulltext.php?f=pdf&ida=90 |doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196|doi-access=free }}</ref>  The second component of health geography is the geography of health care, primarily facility location, accessibility, and utilization.  This requires the use of [[spatial analysis]] and often borrows from [[behavioral economics]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/1353-8292(95)00002-4 | title=Coming out: exposing social theory in medical geography | journal=Health | date=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=5–14 | first=Andréa | last=Litva}}</ref>

=== Geographies of disease and ill health ===
Health geographers are concerned with the prevalence of different diseases along a range of [[spatial scale]]s from a local to global view, and inspects the natural world, in all of its complexity, for [[Correlation and dependence|correlations]] between diseases and locations. This situates health geography alongside other [[Geography#Human geography|geographical sub-disciplines]] that trace human-environment relations. Health geographers use modern spatial analysis tools to map the [[diffusion|d]]<nowiki/>ispersion of various diseases, as individuals spread them amongst themselves, and across wider spaces as they [[Human migration|migrate]].<ref name="Philo" /> Health geographers also consider all types of spaces as presenting health risks, from [[natural disaster]]s, to interpersonal [[violence]], [[stress (biology)|stress]], and other potential dangers.<ref name="Philo2" />

=== Geography of health care provision ===
Although healthcare is a public good, it is not equally available to all [[individuals]]. Demand for public services is continuously increasing. People need advance knowledge and the latest prediction technology, that health geography offers. The latest example of such technology is Telemedicine. Many people in the United States are not able to access proper healthcare because of inequality in health insurance and the means to afford medical care.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/money-quality-health-care-longer-life/|title=The costs of inequality: Money = quality health care = longer life|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2017-02-19|language=en}}</ref>

Mobility and Disease Tracking:<br>
With the advent of mobile technology and its spread, it is now possible to track individual mobility. By correlating the movement of individuals through tracking the devices using access towers or other tracking systems, it is now possible to determine and even control disease spread. While [[privacy law]]s question the legality of tracking individuals, the commercial mobile service providers are using covert techniques or obtaining government waivers to allow permission to track people.
