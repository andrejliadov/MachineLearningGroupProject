'''Geo-blocking''' or '''geoblocking''' is technology that restricts access to [[Internet]] content based upon the user's [[Internet geolocation|geographical location]]. In a geo-blocking scheme, the user's location is determined using [[geolocation]] techniques, such as checking the user's [[IP address]] against a [[blacklist]] or [[whitelist]], accounts, and measuring the [[end-to-end delay]] of a network connection to estimate the physical location of the user.<ref>{{Cite journal |url = http://sce.carleton.ca/~abdou/CPV_TDSC.pdf|title = CPV: Delay-based Location Verification for the Internet|last = Abdou|first = AbdelRahman|date = June 2015|journal =  IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 130â€“144|doi = 10.1109/TDSC.2015.2451614|first2 = Ashraf|last2 = Matrawy|first3 = Paul|last3 = van Oorschot|citeseerx = 10.1.1.696.691}}</ref><ref name="telcoreviewnz-globalblock" /> The result of this check is used to determine whether the system will approve or deny access to the [[website]] or to particular content. The geolocation may also be used to modify the content provided, for example, the currency in which goods are quoted, the price or the range of goods that are available, besides other aspects.

The term is most commonly associated with its use to restrict access to premium multimedia content on the Internet, such as films and television shows, primarily for [[copyright]] and [[licensing]] reasons. There are other uses for geoblocking, such as blocking malicious traffic or to enforce [[price discrimination]], location-aware authentication, fraud prevention, and online gambling (where gambling laws vary by region).

== Justification ==
The ownership of exclusive territorial rights to content may differ between regions, requiring the providers of the content to disallow access for users outside of their designated region; for example, although an online service, [[HBO Now]] is only available to residents of  the United States, and cannot be offered in other countries because its parent network [[HBO]] had already licensed exclusive rights to its programming to different broadcasters (such as in Canada, where HBO licensed its back-catalogue to [[Bell Media]]), who may offer their own, similar service specific to their own region and business model (such as [[Crave (streaming service)|Crave]]).<ref name=bbc-hbonowoutsideus>{{cite news|title=HBO Now users outside US to be 'cut off'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32392639|access-date=22 April 2015|date=21 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=fp-hbonowblock>{{cite news|title=HBO is cracking down on Canadians accessing streaming service HBO Now|url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/hbo-is-cracking-down-on-canadians-accessing-streaming-service-hbo-now|access-date=22 April 2015|work=Financial Post|date=22 April 2015}}</ref> For similar reasons, the library of content available on subscription [[video on demand]] services such as [[Netflix]] may also vary between regions, or the service may not even be available in the user's country at all.<ref name=cnet-netflixgeoblock/><ref name=ars-sonyvpn />

Geoblocking can be used for other purposes as well. [[Price discrimination]] by online stores can be enforced by geo-blocking, forcing users to buy products online from a foreign version of a site where prices may be unnecessarily higher than those of their domestic version. The "[[Australia Tax]]" has been cited as an example of this phenomenon, which has led to governmental pressure to restrict how geoblocking can be used in this manner in the country.<ref name=zdnet-geoblocktax>{{cite web|title=The 'Australia tax' is real, geo-blocking to stop|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-australia-tax-is-real-geo-blocking-to-stop/|website=ZDNet|access-date=25 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=cwau-pricediscrim>{{cite web|title=IT pricing: DBCDE tells inquiry geoblocking legislation problematic|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/456217/it_pricing_dbcde_tells_inquiry_geoblocking_legislation_problematic/|website=Computerworld Australia|access-date=22 April 2015}}</ref>

Other noted uses include blocking access from countries that a particular website is not relevant to (especially if the majority of traffic from that country is malicious),<ref name=itworld-blocking>{{cite web|title=How to block traffic from other countries in Linux|url=http://www.itworld.com/article/2833357/security/how-to-block-traffic-from-other-countries-in-linux.html|website=ITWorld|access-date=28 April 2015|date=27 December 2013}}</ref> and voluntarily blocking access to content or services that are illegal under local laws.

== Circumvention ==
As with other forms of [[internet censorship]], geo-blocking can be [[Internet censorship circumvention|circumvented]]. When IP address-based geo-blocking is employed, [[virtual private network]] (VPN) and [[anonymizer]] services can be used to evade geo-blocks. A user can, for example, access a website using a U.S. IP address in order to access content or services that are not available from outside the country. [[Hulu]], [[Netflix]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and [[BBC iPlayer]] are among the foreign video services widely used through these means by foreign users.<ref name="telcoreviewnz-globalblock" />  Its popularity among VPN users in the country prompted Netflix to officially establish an Australian version of its service in 2014.<ref name="cnet-globalmode" /> In response to complaints over the quality of domestic coverage by [[NBC]], along with a requirement for viewers [[TV Everywhere|be a subscriber to a participating pay television provider]] in order to access the online content, a large number of American viewers used VPN services to stream foreign online coverage of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and [[2014 Winter Olympics]] from British and Canadian broadcasters. Unlike NBC's coverage, this foreign coverage only used a geoblock and did not require a TV subscription.<ref name="gandm-cbcvpn" />

In 2013, the [[New Zealand]] [[internet service provider]] [[Slingshot (ISP)|Slingshot]] introduced a similar feature known as "global mode"; initially intended for travellers to enable access to local websites blocked in New Zealand, the service was re-launched in July 2014 as a feature to all Slingshot subscribers. The consumer-focused re-launch focused on its ability to provide access to U.S. online video services.<ref name=cnet-netflixgeoblock>{{cite web|title=Netflix VPN access locked down for overseas users|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-vpn-access-lock-down-overseas-users-geoblock/|website=CNET|access-date=22 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=cnet-globalmode>{{cite web|title=New Zealand ISP's 'Global Mode' gives users access to Netflix and more|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/new-zealand-isps-global-mode-gives-users-access-to-netflix-and-more/|website=CNET|access-date=22 April 2015}}</ref><ref name="gandm-cbcvpn">{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/olympics/some-us-viewers-turn-to-cbc-amid-complaints-about-nbcs-olympic-coverage/article16790846/ | title=Some U.S. viewers turn to CBC amid complaints about NBC's Olympic coverage | work=The Globe and Mail | date=10 February 2014 | access-date=12 March 2014 | author=Szklarski, Cassandra}}</ref><ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode>{{cite news|title=New Zealand ISPs may be sued for letting users bypass geoblocks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/20/new-zealand-internet-service-providers-face-legal-action-over-copyright-breach|access-date=22 April 2015|work=The Guardian}}</ref> Unlike manually-configured VPN services, Global Mode was implemented passively at the ISP level and was automatically activated based on a whitelist, without any further user intervention.<ref name=cwau-legalbattle/>

== Legality of circumvention for online video ==
The legality of circumventing geo-blocking to access foreign video services under local copyright laws is unclear and varies by country.<ref name=cwau-legalbattle>{{cite web|title=In New Zealand, a legal battle looms over streaming TV|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/572569/new-zealand-legal-battle-looms-over-streaming-tv/|website=Computerworld AU|publisher=IDG|access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref> Members of the [[Entertainment|entertainment industry]] (including broadcasters and studios) have contended that the use of VPNs and similar services to evade geo-blocking by online video services is a violation of copyright laws, as the foreign service does not hold the rights to make its content available in the user's countryâ€”thus infringing and undermining the rights held by a local rightsholder.<ref name=ars-sonyvpn/><ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode/><ref>{{cite web|title=Bell Media president says using VPNs to skirt copyright rules is stealing|url=http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/business/bell-media-president-says-using-vpns-to-skirt-copyright-rules-is-stealing-1.3099972|website=CBC News|access-date=29 October 2015}}</ref> Accessing online video services from outside the country in which they operate is typically considered a violation of their respective [[terms of use]]; some services have implemented measures to block VPN users, despite there being legitimate uses for such proxy services, under the assumption that they are using them to evade geographic filtering.<ref name=ars-sonyvpn/><ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode/><ref name=engadget-huluvpnblock>{{cite web|title=Hulu attempts to block international viewers who use VPNs|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/26/hulu-blocks-vpns/|website=Engadget|access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=cnet-netflixgeoblock/><ref name=fp-hbonowblock /><ref name=wired-iplayerblock>{{cite journal|title=BBC blocks international iPlayer viewers ahead of US launch|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-10/20/bbc-iplayer-vpn-access|journal=Wired UK|access-date=19 November 2015|date=20 October 2015}}</ref>

Leaked e-mails from the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack]] revealed statements by Keith LeGoy, [[Sony Pictures Television]]'s president of international distribution, describing the international usage of Netflix over VPN services as being "semi-sanctioned" [[Copyright infringement#.22Piracy.22|piracy]] that helped to illicitly increase its market share, and criticizing the company for not taking further steps to prevent usage of the service outside of regions where they have licenses to their content, such as detecting ineligible users via their payment method.<ref name=ars-sonyvpn>{{cite web|title=Sony Pictures mad at Netflix's failure to block overseas VPN users|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/12/sony-pictures-mad-at-netflixs-failure-to-block-overseas-vpn-users/|website=Ars Technica|access-date=22 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode/> On 14 January 2016, Netflix announced its intent to strengthen measures to prevent subscribers from accessing regional versions of the service that they are not authorized to use.<ref name=verge-netflixproxy>{{cite web|title=Netflix says it will do more to stop customers from bypassing country restrictions|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/14/10767982/netflix-blocking-proxies-vpn-country-restrictions|website=The Verge|access-date=14 January 2016|date=14 January 2016}}</ref>

===Australia===
In Australia, a policy FAQ published by then [[Minister for Communications (Australia)|Minister for Communications]] [[Malcolm Turnbull]], states that users violating an "international commercial arrangement to protect copyright in different countries or regions" is not illegal under [[Australian copyright law]].<ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode/> However, an amendment to Australian copyright law allows courts to order the blocking of websites that primarily engage in "facilitating" [[copyright infringement]]â€”a definition which could include VPN services that market themselves specifically for the purpose of evading geoblocking.<ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode/><ref name=cnet-siteblocking>{{cite news|title=Site blocking laws could drag VPNs into the anti-piracy net|url=http://www.cnet.com/au/news/site-blocking-laws-could-drag-vpns-into-the-anti-piracy-net/|access-date=26 April 2015}}</ref> Prior to the passing of this amendment in June 2015, Turnbull acknowledged that VPN services have "a wide range of legitimate uses, not least of which is the preservation of privacyâ€”something which every citizen is entitled to secure for themselvesâ€”and [VPN providers] have no oversight, control or influence over their customersâ€™ activities."<ref name=ars-ausblocklaw>{{cite news|title=Australia passes controversial anti-piracy web censorship law|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/06/australia-passes-controversial-anti-piracy-web-censorship-law/|access-date=22 June 2015|work=Ars Technica}}</ref>

===European Union===
On 6 May 2015, the [[European Union]] announced the adoption of its "[[Digital Single Market]]" strategy, which would amongst other changes, aim to end the use of "unjustified" geo-blocking between EU countries, arguing that "too many Europeans cannot use online services that are available in other EU countries, often without any justification; or they are re-routed to a local store with different prices. Such discrimination cannot exist in a [[European Single Market|Single Market]]."<ref name=tf-europegeoblocking>{{cite web|title=Europe Will Abolish Geo-Blocking and Other Copyright Restrictions|url=http://torrentfreak.com/europe-will-abolish-geo-blocking-and-other-copyright-restrictions-150506/|website=TorrentFreak|access-date=6 May 2015|date=6 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=ars-eudigsinglemarket>{{cite web|title=EU announces plans to banish geo-blocking, modernize copyright law|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2015/03/eu-announces-plans-to-banish-geo-blocking-modernize-copyright-law/|website=Ars Technica|access-date=23 April 2015|date=27 March 2015}}</ref> However, proposals issued by the European Commission on 25 May 2016 excluded the territorial licensing of copyrighted audiovisual works from this strategy.<ref name="bloomberg-dsmonlinevideo">{{cite web|title=Europe's Geoblocking Decision: What You Need to Know|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-25/europe-s-geoblocking-decision-what-you-need-to-know|website=Bloomberg|access-date=1 February 2017}}</ref><ref name="ars-eugeoblock">{{cite web|title=Netflix, Amazon given quotas for EU-produced video, face new tax|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/05/eu-digital-single-market-netflix-tax-details/|website=Ars Technica|access-date=25 May 2016|date=25 May 2016}}</ref> 

On 1 April 2018, new digital media portability rules took effect, which requires paid digital media services to offer "roaming" within the EU. This means that, for example, a subscriber to [[Netflix]] in one EU country must still be able to access their home country's version of the service when travelling into other EU countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/european-union-commission-eu-portability-regulation|title=You can now use your Netflix subscription anywhere in the EU|last=Priday|first=Richard|work=Wired.co.uk|access-date=2 April 2018}}</ref><ref name="cnet-eunogeoblock">{{cite web|title=EU plans to let you stream your movies, TV and sport abroad|url=https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/eu-plans-for-you-to-take-your-movies-tv-and-sport-on-holiday-without-downloading-sky-iplayer-amazon/|website=CNET|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/01/eu-digital-media-portability-takes-effect/|title=European travelers can now watch Netflix like they're at home|work=Engadget|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

===New Zealand===
In April 2015, a group of media companies in New Zealand, including [[MediaWorks New Zealand|MediaWorks]], [[Spark New Zealand|Spark]], [[Sky Network Television]], and [[TVNZ]], jointly sent [[cease and desist]] notices to several ISPs offering VPN services for the purpose of evading geo-blocking, demanding that they pledge to discontinue the operation of these services by 15 April 2015, and to inform their customers that such services are "unlawful". The companies accused the ISPs of facilitating copyright infringement by violating their exclusive territorial rights to content in the country, and misrepresenting the alleged legality of the services in promotional material. In particular, Spark argued that the use of VPNs to access foreign video on demand services was cannibalizing its own domestic service Lightbox. At least two smaller providers ([[Lightwire Limited]] and Unlimited Internet) announced that they would pull their VPN services in response to the legal concerns. However, CallPlus, the parent company of Slingshot and [[Orcon Internet Limited|Orcon]], objected to the claims, arguing that the Global Mode service was "completely legal", and accused the broadcasters of displaying [[protectionism]]. Later that month, it was reported that the broadcasters planned to go forward with legal action against CallPlus.<ref name=telcoreviewnz-globalblock>{{cite web|title=Global mode spat: We've got the legal paperwork|url=http://telcoreview.co.nz/story/Global-mode-spat-weve-got-the-legal-paperwork/|website=TelcoReview|access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=guardian-nzglobalmode/><ref name=cwnz-globalmodelegal>{{cite web|title=Global Mode "completely legal" as CallPlus dismisses industry backlash|url=http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/572164/global-mode-completely-legal-callplus-dismisses-industry-backlash/|website=Computerworld NZ|access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=cwnz-riftcourt>{{cite web|title=Streaming TV rift heads to court in New Zealand|url=http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/573022/streaming-tv-rift-heads-court-new-zealand/|website=Computerworld NZ|access-date=24 April 2015}}</ref> 

On 24 June 2015, it was announced that the media companies reached an out-of-court settlement, in which ByPass Network Services, who operates the service, would discontinue it effective 1 September 2015.<ref name=cwnz-backdown>{{cite web|title=NZ ISPs back down on anti-geoblocking support|url=http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/578218/nz-isps-back-down-anti-geoblocking-support/|website=Computerworld NZ|publisher=IDG|access-date=24 June 2015}}</ref>
