The '''tropics''' are the region of [[Earth]] surrounding the [[Equator]]. They are delimited in [[latitude]] by the [[Tropic of Cancer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] at {{Circle of latitude|Tropical|Convert}} N and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in
the [[Southern Hemisphere]] at {{Circle of latitude|Tropical|Convert}} S; these latitudes correspond to the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth. The tropics are also referred to as the '''tropical zone''' and the '''torrid zone''' (see [[geographical zone]]). The tropics include all zones on Earth where the [[Sun]] contacts [[zenith|a point directly overhead]] at least once during the [[solar year]] (which is a [[subsolar point]]).  Thus the maximum latitudes of the tropics have the same value positive and negative.  Likewise they approximate, due to the earth not being a perfect sphere, the "angle" of the [[Axial tilt#Earth|Earth's axial tilt]]. The "angle" itself is not perfectly fixed due chiefly to the influence of the moon, but the limits of tropics are a geographic convention, being an averaged form, not least the variance is very small.

In terms of climate, the tropics receive sunlight that is more direct than the rest of Earth and are generally hotter and wetter. The word "tropical" sometimes refers to this sort of climate rather than to the geographical zone. The tropical zone includes deserts and snow-capped mountains, which are not tropical in the climatic sense. The tropics are distinguished from the other climatic and biomatic regions of Earth, which are the [[middle latitudes]] and the [[polar regions of Earth|polar regions]] on either side of the equatorial zone.

The tropics constitute 40% of Earth's surface area<ref>{{cite web|url=http://godplaysdice.blogspot.co.uk/2007/12/how-much-land-is-in-tropics.html|date=2007-12-04|accessdate=2017-06-26|website=God Plays Dice|title=How much land is in the tropics?}}</ref> and contain 36% of Earth's [[landmass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/tropics/|accessdate=2017-06-26|website=National Geographic Encyclopedia|title=tropics|publisher=National Geographic Society}}</ref> {{asof|2014}}, the region was home to 40% of the world's [[world population|population]], and this figure was then projected to reach 50% by 2050.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/06/expanding-tropics-will-play-greater-global-role-report-predicts|title=Expanding tropics will play greater global role, report predicts|date=29 June 2014|work=Science Magazine}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The word "tropic" comes from [[Ancient Greek]] τροπή (''tropē''), meaning "to turn" or "change direction"

[[File:Monthly zonal mean precipitation.png|thumb|left|A graph showing the zonally averaged monthly precipitation. The tropics receive more precipitation than higher latitudes. The precipitation maximum, which follows the solar equator through the year, is under the rising branch of the Hadley circulation; the sub-tropical minima are under the descending branch and cause the desert areas.]]

"Tropical" is sometimes used in a general sense for a [[tropical climate]] to mean warm to hot and moist year-round, often with the sense of lush vegetation.

Many tropical areas have a dry and wet season.  The [[wet season]], rainy season or green season is the time of year, ranging from one or more months, when most of the average annual [[rainfall]] in a region falls.<ref>Glossary of Meteorology (2009).

Retrieved on 2008-12-27</ref> typical vegetation in these areas ranges from moist [[seasonal tropical forest]]s to [[savannah]]s.

When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or [[summer]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours.  The wet season is a time when [[air quality]] improves, freshwater quality improves and vegetation grows significantly, leading to crop yields late in the season.  Floods cause rivers to overflow their banks, and some animals to retreat to higher ground.  [[Soil]] nutrients diminish and erosion increases.  The incidence of [[malaria]] increases in areas where the rainy season coincides with high temperatures.  Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime.  The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.

However, regions within the tropics may well not have a tropical climate. Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], much of the area within the geographical tropics is classed not as "tropical" but as "dry" ([[desert climate|arid]] or [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]]), including the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]], the [[Atacama Desert]] and [[Australian Outback]]. Also, there are [[alpine tundra]] and snow-capped peaks, including [[Mauna Kea]], [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], and the [[Andes]] as far south as the northernmost parts of [[Chile]] and [[Perú]].

[[Tropical plants]] and animals are those species native to the tropics. Tropical ecosystems may consist of [[tropical rainforest]]s, [[seasonal tropical forests]], [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry (often deciduous) forests]], spiny forests, [[desert]] and other habitat types. There are often significant areas of [[biodiversity]], and species [[endemism]] present, particularly in rainforests and seasonal forests. Some examples of important biodiversity and high endemism ecosystems are [[El Yunque National Forest]] in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Costa Rica]]n and [[Nicaragua]]n rainforests, [[Amazon Rainforest]] territories of several [[South America]]n countries, [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]], the [[Waterberg Biosphere]] of [[South Africa]], and eastern [[Madagascar]] rainforests. Often the soils of tropical forests are low in [[nutrient]] content, making them quite vulnerable to [[slash-and-burn]] [[deforestation]] techniques, which are sometimes an element of [[shifting cultivation]] agricultural systems.

In [[biogeography]], the tropics are divided into [[Paleotropical Kingdom|Paleotropics]] (Africa, Asia and Australia) and [[Neotropical realm|Neotropics]] (Caribbean, Central America, and South America). Together, they are sometimes referred to as the Pantropic. The system of [[biogeographic realm]]s differs somewhat; the [[Neotropical realm]] includes both the Neotropics and temperate South America, and the Paleotropics correspond to the [[Afrotropical realm|Afrotropical]], [[Indomalayan realm|Indomalayan]], [[Oceanian realm|Oceanian]], and tropical [[Australasian realm]]s.

==Tropicality==

Tropicality refers to the image that people outside the tropics have of the region, ranging from critical to verging on fetishism. The idea of tropicality gained renewed interest in geographical discourse when French geographer [[Pierre Gourou]] published ''Les Pays Tropicaux'' (''The Tropical World'' in English), in the late 1940s.<ref>Arnold, David. "Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950", p. 6. Journal of Tropical Geography</ref>

Tropicality encompassed two images. One, is that the tropics represent a 'Garden of Eden', a heaven on Earth, a land of rich biodiversity - aka a tropical paradise.<ref name="Arnold, David p. 7">Arnold, David. "Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950", p. 7. Journal of Tropical Geography</ref> The alternative is that the tropics consist of wild, unconquerable nature. The latter view was often discussed in old Western literature more so than the first.<ref name="Arnold, David p. 7"/> Evidence suggests over time that the view of the tropics as such in popular literature has been supplanted by more well-rounded and sophisticated interpretations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Menadue|first=Christopher B.|date=2017-05-30|title=Trysts Tropiques: The Torrid Jungles of Science Fiction|journal=ETropic: Electronic Journal of Studies in the Tropics|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|doi=10.25120/etropic.16.1.2017.3570|issn=1448-2940|url=https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/49178/1/Trysts_Tropiques.pdf}}</ref>

Western scholars tried to theorise reasons about why tropical areas were relatively more inhospitable to human civilisations then those existing in colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. A popular explanation focused on the differences in climate. Tropical jungles and rainforests have much more humid and hotter weather than colder and drier temperaments of the Northern Hemisphere. This theme led to some scholars to suggest that humid hot climates correlate to human populations lacking control over  nature e.g. ' the wild Amazonian rainforests'.<ref>Arnold, David. "Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950", p. 13. Journal of Tropical Geography</ref>
