== Uses ==
Crowdmapping can be used to track fires, floods, [[pollution]],<ref name=ukgov1/> crime, political violence, the spread of disease and bring a level of transparency to fast-moving events that are difficult for [[traditional media]] to adequately cover, or problem areas<ref name=ukgov1/> and longer-term trends and that may be difficult to identify through the reporting of individual events.<ref name=quaintance1/>

During disasters the timeliness of relevant maps is critical as the needs and locations of victims may change rapidly.<ref name=cnn1/>

The use of crowdmapping by authorities can improve [[situational awareness]] during an incident and be used to support [[incident response]].<ref name=ukgov1/>

Crowdmaps are an efficient way to visually demonstrate the geographical spread of a phenomenon.<ref name=ssrn1/>
