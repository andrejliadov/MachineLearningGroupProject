'''Agricultural geography''' is a sub-discipline of [[human geography]] concerned with the spatial relationships found between agriculture and humans. That is, the study of the phenomenons and effects that lead to the formation of the earth's top surface, in different regions.

== Focus ==
It is traditionally considered the branch of [[economic geography]] that investigates those parts of the [[Earth's surface]] that are transformed by humans through [[primary sector]] activities for consumption. It thus focuses on the different types of structures of agricultural landscapes and asks for the cultural, social, economic, political, and environmental processes that lead to these spatial patterns. While most research in this area concentrates rather on production than on consumption,<ref>Laingen, C. & L. Butler Harrington (2013): Agricultural Geography. ''Oxford Bibliographies''. [[Oxford University Press]]. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/OBO/9780199874002-006 DOI 10.1093/OBO/9780199874002-006]</ref> a distinction can be made between [[nomothetic]] (e.g. distribution of spatial agricultural patterns and processes) and [[idiographic]] research (e.g. human-environment interaction and the shaping of agricultural landscapes). The latter approach of agricultural geography is often applied within [[regional geography]].
