'''African philosophy''' is the philosophical discourse produced by indigenous Africans and their descendants, including African Americans. African philosophers may be found in the various academic fields of philosophy, such as [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[Ethics|moral philosophy]], and [[political philosophy]]. One particular subject that many African philosophers have written about is that on the subject of freedom and what it means to be free or to experience wholeness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mucale|first=Ergimino Pedro|date=Fall 2015|title=The Libertarian Paradigm in Ngoenha: A Contribution to the African Philosophy|journal=Philosophia Africana|volume= 17|pages=45–54}}</ref> Philosophy in Africa has a rich and varied history, some of which has been lost over time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holton|first=Robert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BIRZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA124 |title=World Civilizations And History Of Human Development|last2=Nasson|first2=William Richard|date=2009-09-29|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-84826-213-3|language=en}}</ref> One of the earliest known African philosophers was [[Ptahhotep]], an ancient Egyptian philosopher. In the early and mid-twentieth century, anti-colonial movements had a tremendous effect on the development of a distinct African [[political philosophy]] that had resonance on both the continent and in the African diaspora. One well-known example of the economic philosophical works emerging from this period was the [[African socialist]] philosophy of [[Ujamaa]] propounded in Tanzania and other parts of [[Southeast Africa]]. These African political and economic philosophical developments also had a notable impact on the anti-colonial movements of many non-African peoples around the world.

==Definition==
There is some debate in defining the [[Ethnophilosophy|ethnophilosophical]] parameters of African philosophy and identifying what differentiates it from other philosophical traditions. One of the implicit assumptions of [[ethnophilosophy]] is that a specific culture can have a philosophy that is not applicable and accessible to all peoples and cultures in the world. In ''A Discourse on African Philosophy: A New Perspective on Ubuntu and Transitional Justice in South Africa'', Christian B. N. Gade argues that the ethnophilosophical approach to African philosophy as a static group property is highly problematic. His research on ubuntu presents an alternative collective discourse on African philosophy that takes differences, historical developments, and social contexts seriously. According to [[Edwin Etieyibo]] and Jonathon O. Chimakonam in their article “African Philosophy: Past, Present, and Future”, historical context plays an important role in African philosophy. History provides the framework in which we can inspect philosophical problems. In terms of African philosophy, one must look at the whole picture through the lens of African history.  “There are no facts without history." <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Etieyibo|first=Edwin|last2=Chimakonam|first2=Jonathan|date=Fall 2015|title=African Philosophy: Past, Present, and Future|journal=Philosophia Africana}}</ref>

African philosophy can be formally defined as a critical thinking by Africans on their experiences of reality. Nigerian born Philosopher K.C. Anyanwu defined African philosophy as "that which concerns itself with the way in which African people of the past and present make sense of their destiny and of the world in which they live.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=R.S.|title=Authority, Responsibility and Education|date=1959|publisher=G. Allen & Unwin|location=London}}</ref>

Nigerian philosopher Joseph I. Omoregbe broadly defines a philosopher as one who attempts to understand the world's phenomena, the purpose of human existence, the nature of the world, and the place of human beings in that world. This form of [[natural philosophy]] is identifiable in Africa even before individual African philosophers can be distinguished in the sources.<ref>Maurice Muhatia Makumba, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9966082964 An Introduction to African Philosophy: Past and Present] (2007), p. 25.</ref> Like [[Western philosophy]], African philosophy contemplates the perceptions of time, personhood, space and other subjects.

== History ==
African philosophy's beginning is linked to the 1920s. African individuals who had studied in the United States and Europe ("Western" locations) had returned to Africa and reflected on the racial discrimination experienced abroad. Their arrival back in Africa instigated a feeling of onuma, which is an interpretation of "frustration." The onuma was felt in response to legacies of colonialism on a global scale. The beginning of African philosophy is important because onuma inspired some who had traveled and returned to formulate a "systematic beginning" of philosophizing the African identity, the space of African people in history, and African contribution to humanity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/afric-hi/#H3|title=History of African Philosophy|last=Chimakonam|first=Jonathan|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>

== Criteria ==
Two conflicting components are deemed integral to a work for it to be considered African philosophy. First, the piece must have a racial focus. This facet is valued by Traditionalist groups, who posit that African philosophy should be an expression of the world experienced by African individuals. African philosophy must be produced by African authors. In contrast, Universalist groups suggest that African philosophy should be analyses and critical engagement of and between individual African thinkers. A work is African philosophy based on a focal point of tradition. African philosophy must pull from African cultural backgrounds or thought processes, but it should be independent from racial considerations and use "African" only as a term of solidarity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Essay in African Philosophical Thought: The Akan Conceptual Scheme|last=Gyeke|first=Kwame|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|location=Cambridge}}</ref>

== Methods ==

=== Communitarian method ===
The communitarian method of African philosophy emphasizes mutualism in thought. It is most commonly used by researchers following ubuntu. The common expression of ubuntu is that "a person is a person through a person." Leonhard Praeg, Mogobe Ramose, and Fainos Mangera implement the communitarian method.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=On Defining African Philosophy|last=Wiredu|first=Kwasi|publisher=APP Publications|year=1989}}</ref>

=== Complementary method ===
The complementary method focuses on the prospect of a missing link. All variables are important in consideration of histories and identities, and no variable should be overlooked or under-considered. Additionally, all variables affect one another, so the relationship between them and their affects on other variables should be scrutinized. Mesembe Edet implements the complementary method.<ref name=":0" />

=== Conversational method ===
The conversational method creates thought by assessing a relationship between oppositional works. The defender or proponent is named "nwa-swa," and the nwa swa is questioned and doubted by a disagreeing party, known as "nwa nju." The conversational method emphasizes the interconnectedness of networks within reality; the more accurate a thought should be, the more specific a location should be. This method is endorsed by the Conventional School of Psychology, and it is used by Victor Nweke and Msembe Edet.<ref name=":0" />

==Types==

===Pre-modern===
====North Africa====
In [[North Africa]], arguably central to the development of the [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy|ancient Egyptian philosoph]]ical tradition of Egypt and Sudan was the conception of "[[ma'at]]", which roughly translated refers to "justice", "truth", or simply "that which is right". One of the earliest works of political philosophy was [[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]], which were taught to Egyptian schoolboys for centuries.

Ancient Egypt have several philosophical texts that have been treated by scholars in recent years. In the 2018 podcast "Africana Philosophy", the philosophers [[Peter Adamson (philosopher)|Peter Adamson]] and Chike Jeffers devoted the first eight episodes to [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy|Egyptian philosophy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historyofphilosophy.net/africana/precolonial|title=Locating and Debating Precolonial African Philosophy {{!}} History of Philosophy without any gaps|website=historyofphilosophy.net|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> The [[American Philosophical Association]] (APA) has published a text on the classical text "[[The Immortality of Writers]]" ("Be A Writer"), ca. 1200 BCE. The Blog of the APA article also covers “[[Dispute between a man and his Ba|The Dispute Between a Man and His Ba]]” of 19th century BCE; “[[The Teaching of Ani]]”, 13th century BCE, which gives advice to the ordinary man; “[[The Satire of the Trades]]” by Khety; and the text of Amennakht (active in 1170–1140 BCE) from [[Deir el-Medina|Deir El-Medina]], whose teaching states that “it is good to finish school, better than the smell of lotus blossoms in summer.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.apaonline.org/2018/12/17/the-radical-philosophy-of-egypt-forget-god-and-family-write/|title=The Radical Philosophy of Egypt: Forget God and Family, Write!|last=Contributor|first=Blog|date=2018-12-17|website=Blog of the APA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> 

Ancient Egyptian philosophers also made important contributions to [[Hellenistic philosophy]] and [[Christian philosophy]]. According to ''Busiris'' by the ancient Greek philosopher [[Isocrates]], the senior of [[Plato]], “all men agree the Egyptians are the healthiest and most long of life among men; and then for the soul they introduced philosophy’s training…”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.apaonline.org/2018/12/17/the-radical-philosophy-of-egypt-forget-god-and-family-write/|title=The Radical Philosophy of Egypt: Forget God and Family, Write!|last=Contributor|first=Blog|date=2018-12-17|website=Blog of the APA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>

Isocrates declared that Greek writers traveled to Egypt to seek knowledge; one of them [[Pythagoras]] of Samos who “was first to bring to the Greeks all philosophy.” 

In the Hellenistic tradition, the influential philosophical school of [[Neoplatonism]] was founded by the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] philosopher [[Plotinus]] in the 3rd century CE.

====West Africa====
The most prominent of [[West Africa]]'s pre-modern philosophical traditions has been identified as that of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] philosophical tradition and the distinctive worldview that emerged from it over the thousands of years of its development. Philosophical concepts such as [[Omoluabi]], [[Aṣẹ|Ashè]] and [[Emi Omo Eso]] were integral to this system, and the totality of its elements are contained in what is known amongst the Yoruba as the [[Yoruba mythology|Itan]]. The cosmologies and philosophies of the [[Akan people|Akan]], [[Dogon people|Dogon]], [[Serer creation myth|Serer]] and [[Dahomey]] were also significant.

In pre-colonial [[Senegambia]] (modern [[Gambia]] and [[Senegal]]), the 17th-century philosopher [[Kocc Barma Fall]] stood out as one of the renowned philosophers in [[:Category:History of Senegambia|Senegambian history]]. His proverbs are still recited by Senegalese and Gambians alike, including in Senegambian popular culture - for example in [[Ousmane Sembene]]'s films such as ''[[Guelwaar]]''<ref>Ware, Rudolph T., ''The Walking Qurʼan: Islamic Education, Embodied Knowledge, and History in West Africa,'' UNC Press Books (2014), p. 101, {{ISBN|9781469614311}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gRGpAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref><ref>Murphy, David, ''Sembene: Imagining Alternatives in Film & Fiction.'' James Currey Publishers (200), p. 63, {{ISBN|978-0-85255-555-2}}</ref> Other notable philosophical thinkers include the Gambian historian [[Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof]], and the [[Mali]]an ethnologist [[Amadou Hampâté Bâ]].

====Horn of Africa====
In the [[Horn of Africa]], there are a number of sources documenting the development of a distinct [[Ethiopian philosophy]] from the first millennium onwards. Among the most notable examples from this tradition emerge from the work of the 17th-century philosopher [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]], and that of his disciple [[Walda Heywat]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/yacob-and-amo-africas-precursors-to-locke-hume-and-kant|title=Yacob and Amo: Africa’s precursors to Locke, Hume and Kant – Dag Herbjørnsrud {{!}} Aeon Essays|website=Aeon|language=en|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> Yacob in his writings discusses religion, morality, and existence. He comes to the belief that every person will believe their faith to be the right one and that all men are created equal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ethiopian Philosophy|last=Sumner|first=Claude|year=1994}}</ref>

====Southern Africa====
In [[Southern Africa]] and [[Southeast Africa]] the development of a distinctive [[Bantu Philosophy|Bantu philosophy]] addressing the nature of existence, the cosmos and humankind's relation to the world following the [[Bantu migration]] has had the most significant impact on the philosophical developments of the said regions, with the development of the philosophy of [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]] as one notable example emerging from this worldview.

====Central Africa====
Many [[Central Africa]]n philosophical traditions before the [[Bantu migration]] into southern [[Central Africa]] have been identified as a uniting characteristic of many [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] and [[Sudanic languages|Sudanic]] peoples, ultimately giving rise to the distinctive worldviews identified in the conceptions of time, the creation of the world, human nature, and the proper relationship between mankind and nature prevalent in [[Dinka mythology]], [[Maasai mythology]] and similar traditions.

====African Diaspora====
Some pre-Modern [[African Diaspora|African diaspor]]ic philosophical traditions have also been identified, mostly produced by descendants of Africans in Europe and the Americas. One notable pre-modern diasporic African philosopher was [[Anthony William Amo]], who was taken as a slave from Awukenu in what is now [[Ghana]], and was brought up and educated in Europe where he gained doctorates in medicine and philosophy, and subsequently became a professor of philosophy at the universities of [[University of Halle|Halle]] and [[University of Jena|Jena]] in Germany.

===Modern===
[[Kenya]]n philosopher [[Henry Odera Oruka]] has distinguished what he calls four trends in modern African philosophy: ethnophilosophy, philosophical sagacity, nationalistic&ndash;ideological philosophy, and professional philosophy.<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)">Samuel Oluoch Imbo, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0847688410 ''An Introduction to African Philosophy''] (1998), pp. 38-39, </ref> In fact it would be more realistic to call them candidates for the position of African philosophy, with the understanding that more than one of them might fit the bill. (Oruka later added two additional categories: literary/artistic philosophy, such as the work of literary figures such as [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], [[Wole Soyinka]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Okot p'Bitek]], and [[Taban Lo Liyong]], and hermeneutic philosophy, the analysis of African languages in order to find philosophical content.) In the African diaspora, American philosopher [[Maulana Karenga]] has also been notable in presenting varied definitions for understanding modern African philosophy, especially as it relates to its earliest sources.
[[File:Achille Mbembe 2.JPG|thumb|Achille Mbembe, a modern African philosopher]]
One notable contributor to professional philosophy is [[Achille Mbembe]]. He interacts with a multitude of modern subjects, including thoughts on statehood, death, capital, racism, and colonialism. His invokes attention to moral and political arguments through a tone of morality in his works. Many recent pieces from Mbembe, including ''Critique of Black Reason'', suggest that understanding Europe as a force not at the center of the universe is a point from which philosophy and society should view the world. Mbembe asserts that he positions himself in multiple worlds of existence at one time. This method creates an empathetic point from which the world can be viewed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/thinkers/mbembe-achille/|title=MBEMBE, Achille|last=says|first=Shaka Yesufu|website=GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|language=en|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>

===Ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity===
Ethnophilosophy has been used to record the beliefs found in African cultures. Such an approach treats African philosophy as consisting in a set of shared beliefs, values, categories, and assumptions that are implicit in the language, practices, and beliefs of African cultures; in short, the uniquely African [[worldview]]. As such, it is seen as an item of communal property rather than an activity for the individual.

One proponent of this form, [[Placide Tempels]], argued in ''[[Bantu Philosophy]]'' that the metaphysical categories of the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people are reflected in their linguistic categories. According to this view, African philosophy can be best understood as springing from the fundamental assumptions about reality reflected in the languages of Africa.

Another example of this sort of approach is the work of Ebiegberi Joe Alagoa of the [[University of Port Harcourt]] in [[Nigeria]], who argues for the existence of an African [[philosophy of history]] stemming from traditional proverbs from the [[Niger Delta]] in his paper "An African Philosophy of History in the Oral Tradition." Alagoa argues that in African philosophy, age is seen as an important factor in gaining wisdom and interpreting the past. In support of this view, he cites proverbs such as "More days, more wisdom", and "What an old man sees seated, a youth does not see standing." Truth is seen as eternal and unchanging ("Truth never rots"), but people are subject to error ("Even a four-legged horse stumbles and falls"). It is dangerous to judge by appearances ("A large eye does not mean keen vision"), but first-hand observation can be trusted ("He who sees does not err"). The past is not seen as fundamentally different from the present, but all history is contemporary history ("A storyteller does not tell of a different season"). The future remains beyond knowledge ("Even a bird with a long neck cannot see the future"). Nevertheless, it is said, "God will outlive eternity." History is seen as vitally important ("One ignorant of his origin is nonhuman"), and historians (known as "sons of the soil") are highly revered ("The son of the soil has the python's keen eyes"). However, these arguments must be taken with a grain of cultural relativism, as the span of culture in Africa is incredibly vast, with patriarchies, matriarchies, monotheists and traditional religionists among the population, and as such the attitudes of groups of the Niger Delta cannot be applied to the whole of Africa.

Another more controversial application of this approach is embodied in the concept of [[Negritude]]. [[Leopold Senghor]], a proponent of Negritude, argued that the distinctly African approach to reality is based on emotion rather than logic, works itself out in participation rather than analysis, and manifests itself through the arts rather than the sciences. [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] and Mubabinge Bilolo, on the other hand, while agreeing that African culture is unique, challenged the view of Africans as essentially emotional and artistic, arguing that Egypt was an African culture whose achievements in [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[architecture]], and [[philosophy]] were pre-eminent. This philosophy may also be maligned as overly [[reductionist]] due to the obvious scientific and scholarly triumphs of not only ancient Egypt, but also Nubia, Meroe, as well as the great library of Timbuktu, the extensive trade networks and kingdoms of North Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, the Horn of Africa and Great Zimbabwe and the other major empires of Southern, Southeast and Central Africa.

Critics of this approach argue that the actual philosophical work in producing a coherent philosophical position is being done by the academic philosopher (such as Alagoa), and that the sayings of the same culture can be selected from and organised in many different ways in order to produce very different, often contradictory systems of thought.

Philosophical sagacity is a sort of individualist version of ethnophilosophy, in which one records the beliefs of certain special members of a community. The premise here is that, although most societies demand some degree of conformity of belief and behaviour from their members, a certain few of those members reach a particularly high level of knowledge and understanding of their cultures' worldviews; such people are sages. In some cases, the sage goes beyond mere knowledge and understanding to reflection and questioning&mdash;these become the targets of philosophical sagacity.

Critics of this approach note that not all reflection and questioning is philosophical; besides, if African philosophy were to be defined purely in terms of philosophic sagacity, then the thoughts of the sages could not be African philosophy, for they did not record them from other sages. Also, on this view the only difference between non-African [[anthropology]] or [[ethnology]] and African philosophy seems to be the nationality of the researcher.

Critics argue further that the problem with both ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity is that there is surely an important distinction between philosophy and the [[history of ideas]], although other philosophers consider the two topics to be remarkably similar.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uWOnYFyGZcMC&pg=PA172&dq=ethnophilosophy+philosophy+history+of+ideas+the+same+or+not&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=ethnophilosophy%20philosophy%20history%20of%20ideas%20the%20same%20or%20not&f=false "Overview African Philosophy"], p. 172, ''One Hundred Philosophers'', Peter J. King, Zebra, 2006</ref> The argument is that no matter how interesting the beliefs of a people such as the [[Akan (ethnic group)|Akan]] or the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] may be to the philosopher, they remain beliefs, not philosophy. To call them philosophy is to use a secondary sense of that term, such as in "my philosophy is live and let live.

===Professional philosophy===
Professional philosophy is usually identified as that produced by African philosophers trained in the Western philosophical tradition, that embraces a universal view of the methods and concerns of philosophy.<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/> Those philosophers identified in this category often explicitly reject the assumptions of ethnophilosophy and adopt a universalist worldview of philosophy that requires all philosophy to be accessible and applicable to all peoples and cultures in the world<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/> This is even if the specific philosophical questions prioritized by individual national or regional philosophies may differ.<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/> Some African philosophers classified in this category are Paulin Hountondji, Peter Bodunrin, Kwasi Wiredu, Tsenay Serequeberhan, Marcien Towa and Lansana Keita.<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/>

===Nationalist and ideological philosophy===
{{see|African nationalism}}
Nationalist and ideological philosophy might be considered a special case of philosophic sagacity, in which not sages but ideologues are the subjects. Alternatively, it has been considered as a subcategory of professional political philosophy. In either case, the same sort of problem arises with retaining a distinction between ideology and philosophy, and also between sets of ideas and a special way of reasoning. Examples include [[African socialism]], [[Nkrumaism]], [[Harambee]] and [[Authenticite]]

===African ethics===
Although Africa is extremely diverse, there appear to be some shared moral ideas across many ethnic groups.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> In a number of African cultures, ethics is centered on a person's character, and saying "he has no morals" translates as something like "he has no character".<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> A person's character reflects the accumulation of her deeds and her habits of conduct; hence, it can be changed over a person's life.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> In some African cultures, "personhood" refers to an adult human who exhibits moral virtues, and one who behaves badly is not considered a person, even if he is considered a human.<ref name=Gyekye2010>{{cite journal|last1=Gyekye|first1=Kwame|title=African Ethics|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=9 Sep 2010|volume=Fall 2011 Edition|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/african-ethics/|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref>

While many traditional African societies are highly religious, [[Traditional African religions|their religions]] are not revealed, and hence, ethics does not center around divine commands.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> Instead, ethics is [[humanistic]] and [[utilitarian]]: it focuses on improving social functioning and human flourishing.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> On the other hand, social welfare is not a mere aggregate of individual welfare; rather, there is a collective "social good" embodying values that everyone wants, like peace and stability.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> In general, African ethics is social or collectivistic rather than individualistic and united in ideology.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> Cooperation and altruism are considered crucial.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> African ethics places more weight on duties of prosocial behaviour than on rights per se, in contrast to most of Western ethics.<ref name=Gyekye2010 />

===Africana philosophy===
{{Main|Africana philosophy}}
Africana philosophy is the work of philosophers of African descent and others whose work deals with the subject matter of the [[African diaspora]]. This is a relatively new (since the 1980s) and developing name given to African thought, and it is given credible attention by professional organizations, including the American Philosophical Association. <ref>{{Citation|last=Outlaw Jr.|first=Lucius T.|title=Africana Philosophy|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/africana/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref> 

Africana philosophy includes the philosophical ideas, arguments and theories of particular concern to people of African descent. Some of the topics explored by Africana philosophy include: pre-Socratic African philosophy and modern day debates discussing the early history of [[Western philosophy]], post-colonial writing in Africa and the Americas, black resistance to oppression, [[black existentialism]] in the United States, and the meaning of "blackness" in the modern world.<ref name="Gyekye2010" />

[[Category:Philosophy by culture]]{{Redirect|African Philosophy|the journal that formerly had this name|Philosophia Africana}}
'''African philosophy''' is the philosophical discourse produced by indigenous Africans and their descendants, including African Americans. African philosophers may be found in the various academic fields of philosophy, such as [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[Ethics|moral philosophy]], and [[political philosophy]]. One particular subject that many African philosophers have written about is that on the subject of freedom and what it means to be free or to experience wholeness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mucale|first=Ergimino Pedro|date=Fall 2015|title=The Libertarian Paradigm in Ngoenha: A Contribution to the African Philosophy|journal=Philosophia Africana|volume= 17|pages=45–54}}</ref> Philosophy in Africa has a rich and varied history, some of which has been lost over time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holton|first=Robert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BIRZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA124 |title=World Civilizations And History Of Human Development|last2=Nasson|first2=William Richard|date=2009-09-29|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-84826-213-3|language=en}}</ref> One of the earliest known African philosophers was [[Ptahhotep]], an ancient Egyptian philosopher. In the early and mid-twentieth century, anti-colonial movements had a tremendous effect on the development of a distinct African [[political philosophy]] that had resonance on both the continent and in the African diaspora. One well-known example of the economic philosophical works emerging from this period was the [[African socialist]] philosophy of [[Ujamaa]] propounded in Tanzania and other parts of [[Southeast Africa]]. These African political and economic philosophical developments also had a notable impact on the anti-colonial movements of many non-African peoples around the world.

==Definition==
There is some debate in defining the [[Ethnophilosophy|ethnophilosophical]] parameters of African philosophy and identifying what differentiates it from other philosophical traditions. One of the implicit assumptions of [[ethnophilosophy]] is that a specific culture can have a philosophy that is not applicable and accessible to all peoples and cultures in the world. In ''A Discourse on African Philosophy: A New Perspective on Ubuntu and Transitional Justice in South Africa'', Christian B. N. Gade argues that the ethnophilosophical approach to African philosophy as a static group property is highly problematic. His research on ubuntu presents an alternative collective discourse on African philosophy that takes differences, historical developments, and social contexts seriously. According to [[Edwin Etieyibo]] and Jonathon O. Chimakonam in their article “African Philosophy: Past, Present, and Future”, historical context plays an important role in African philosophy. History provides the framework in which we can inspect philosophical problems. In terms of African philosophy, one must look at the whole picture through the lens of African history.  “There are no facts without history." <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Etieyibo|first=Edwin|last2=Chimakonam|first2=Jonathan|date=Fall 2015|title=African Philosophy: Past, Present, and Future|journal=Philosophia Africana}}</ref>

African philosophy can be formally defined as a critical thinking by Africans on their experiences of reality. Nigerian born Philosopher K.C. Anyanwu defined African philosophy as "that which concerns itself with the way in which African people of the past and present make sense of their destiny and of the world in which they live.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=R.S.|title=Authority, Responsibility and Education|date=1959|publisher=G. Allen & Unwin|location=London}}</ref>

Nigerian philosopher Joseph I. Omoregbe broadly defines a philosopher as one who attempts to understand the world's phenomena, the purpose of human existence, the nature of the world, and the place of human beings in that world. This form of [[natural philosophy]] is identifiable in Africa even before individual African philosophers can be distinguished in the sources.<ref>Maurice Muhatia Makumba, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9966082964 An Introduction to African Philosophy: Past and Present] (2007), p. 25.</ref> Like [[Western philosophy]], African philosophy contemplates the perceptions of time, personhood, space and other subjects.

== History ==
African philosophy's beginning is linked to the 1920s. African individuals who had studied in the United States and Europe ("Western" locations) had returned to Africa and reflected on the racial discrimination experienced abroad. Their arrival back in Africa instigated a feeling of onuma, which is an interpretation of "frustration." The onuma was felt in response to legacies of colonialism on a global scale. The beginning of African philosophy is important because onuma inspired some who had traveled and returned to formulate a "systematic beginning" of philosophizing the African identity, the space of African people in history, and African contribution to humanity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/afric-hi/#H3|title=History of African Philosophy|last=Chimakonam|first=Jonathan|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>

== Criteria ==
Two conflicting components are deemed integral to a work for it to be considered African philosophy. First, the piece must have a racial focus. This facet is valued by Traditionalist groups, who posit that African philosophy should be an expression of the world experienced by African individuals. African philosophy must be produced by African authors. In contrast, Universalist groups suggest that African philosophy should be analyses and critical engagement of and between individual African thinkers. A work is African philosophy based on a focal point of tradition. African philosophy must pull from African cultural backgrounds or thought processes, but it should be independent from racial considerations and use "African" only as a term of solidarity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Essay in African Philosophical Thought: The Akan Conceptual Scheme|last=Gyeke|first=Kwame|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|location=Cambridge}}</ref>

== Methods ==

=== Communitarian method ===
The communitarian method of African philosophy emphasizes mutualism in thought. It is most commonly used by researchers following ubuntu. The common expression of ubuntu is that "a person is a person through a person." Leonhard Praeg, Mogobe Ramose, and Fainos Mangera implement the communitarian method.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=On Defining African Philosophy|last=Wiredu|first=Kwasi|publisher=APP Publications|year=1989}}</ref>

=== Complementary method ===
The complementary method focuses on the prospect of a missing link. All variables are important in consideration of histories and identities, and no variable should be overlooked or under-considered. Additionally, all variables affect one another, so the relationship between them and their affects on other variables should be scrutinized. Mesembe Edet implements the complementary method.<ref name=":0" />

=== Conversational method ===
The conversational method creates thought by assessing a relationship between oppositional works. The defender or proponent is named "nwa-swa," and the nwa swa is questioned and doubted by a disagreeing party, known as "nwa nju." The conversational method emphasizes the interconnectedness of networks within reality; the more accurate a thought should be, the more specific a location should be. This method is endorsed by the Conventional School of Psychology, and it is used by Victor Nweke and Msembe Edet.<ref name=":0" />

==Types==

===Pre-modern===
====North Africa====
In [[North Africa]], arguably central to the development of the [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy|ancient Egyptian philosoph]]ical tradition of Egypt and Sudan was the conception of "[[ma'at]]", which roughly translated refers to "justice", "truth", or simply "that which is right". One of the earliest works of political philosophy was [[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]], which were taught to Egyptian schoolboys for centuries.

Ancient Egypt have several philosophical texts that have been treated by scholars in recent years. In the 2018 podcast "Africana Philosophy", the philosophers [[Peter Adamson (philosopher)|Peter Adamson]] and Chike Jeffers devoted the first eight episodes to [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy|Egyptian philosophy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historyofphilosophy.net/africana/precolonial|title=Locating and Debating Precolonial African Philosophy {{!}} History of Philosophy without any gaps|website=historyofphilosophy.net|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> The [[American Philosophical Association]] (APA) has published a text on the classical text "[[The Immortality of Writers]]" ("Be A Writer"), ca. 1200 BCE. The Blog of the APA article also covers “[[Dispute between a man and his Ba|The Dispute Between a Man and His Ba]]” of 19th century BCE; “[[The Teaching of Ani]]”, 13th century BCE, which gives advice to the ordinary man; “[[The Satire of the Trades]]” by Khety; and the text of Amennakht (active in 1170–1140 BCE) from [[Deir el-Medina|Deir El-Medina]], whose teaching states that “it is good to finish school, better than the smell of lotus blossoms in summer.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.apaonline.org/2018/12/17/the-radical-philosophy-of-egypt-forget-god-and-family-write/|title=The Radical Philosophy of Egypt: Forget God and Family, Write!|last=Contributor|first=Blog|date=2018-12-17|website=Blog of the APA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> 

Ancient Egyptian philosophers also made important contributions to [[Hellenistic philosophy]] and [[Christian philosophy]]. According to ''Busiris'' by the ancient Greek philosopher [[Isocrates]], the senior of [[Plato]], “all men agree the Egyptians are the healthiest and most long of life among men; and then for the soul they introduced philosophy’s training…”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.apaonline.org/2018/12/17/the-radical-philosophy-of-egypt-forget-god-and-family-write/|title=The Radical Philosophy of Egypt: Forget God and Family, Write!|last=Contributor|first=Blog|date=2018-12-17|website=Blog of the APA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>

Isocrates declared that Greek writers traveled to Egypt to seek knowledge; one of them [[Pythagoras]] of Samos who “was first to bring to the Greeks all philosophy.” 

In the Hellenistic tradition, the influential philosophical school of [[Neoplatonism]] was founded by the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] philosopher [[Plotinus]] in the 3rd century CE.

====West Africa====
The most prominent of [[West Africa]]'s pre-modern philosophical traditions has been identified as that of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] philosophical tradition and the distinctive worldview that emerged from it over the thousands of years of its development. Philosophical concepts such as [[Omoluabi]], [[Aṣẹ|Ashè]] and [[Emi Omo Eso]] were integral to this system, and the totality of its elements are contained in what is known amongst the Yoruba as the [[Yoruba mythology|Itan]]. The cosmologies and philosophies of the [[Akan people|Akan]], [[Dogon people|Dogon]], [[Serer creation myth|Serer]] and [[Dahomey]] were also significant.

In pre-colonial [[Senegambia]] (modern [[Gambia]] and [[Senegal]]), the 17th-century philosopher [[Kocc Barma Fall]] stood out as one of the renowned philosophers in [[:Category:History of Senegambia|Senegambian history]]. His proverbs are still recited by Senegalese and Gambians alike, including in Senegambian popular culture - for example in [[Ousmane Sembene]]'s films such as ''[[Guelwaar]]''<ref>Ware, Rudolph T., ''The Walking Qurʼan: Islamic Education, Embodied Knowledge, and History in West Africa,'' UNC Press Books (2014), p. 101, {{ISBN|9781469614311}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gRGpAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref><ref>Murphy, David, ''Sembene: Imagining Alternatives in Film & Fiction.'' James Currey Publishers (200), p. 63, {{ISBN|978-0-85255-555-2}}</ref> Other notable philosophical thinkers include the Gambian historian [[Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof]], and the [[Mali]]an ethnologist [[Amadou Hampâté Bâ]].

====Horn of Africa====
In the [[Horn of Africa]], there are a number of sources documenting the development of a distinct [[Ethiopian philosophy]] from the first millennium onwards. Among the most notable examples from this tradition emerge from the work of the 17th-century philosopher [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]], and that of his disciple [[Walda Heywat]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/yacob-and-amo-africas-precursors-to-locke-hume-and-kant|title=Yacob and Amo: Africa’s precursors to Locke, Hume and Kant – Dag Herbjørnsrud {{!}} Aeon Essays|website=Aeon|language=en|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> Yacob in his writings discusses religion, morality, and existence. He comes to the belief that every person will believe their faith to be the right one and that all men are created equal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ethiopian Philosophy|last=Sumner|first=Claude|year=1994}}</ref>

====Southern Africa====
In [[Southern Africa]] and [[Southeast Africa]] the development of a distinctive [[Bantu Philosophy|Bantu philosophy]] addressing the nature of existence, the cosmos and humankind's relation to the world following the [[Bantu migration]] has had the most significant impact on the philosophical developments of the said regions, with the development of the philosophy of [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]] as one notable example emerging from this worldview.

====Central Africa====
Many [[Central Africa]]n philosophical traditions before the [[Bantu migration]] into southern [[Central Africa]] have been identified as a uniting characteristic of many [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] and [[Sudanic languages|Sudanic]] peoples, ultimately giving rise to the distinctive worldviews identified in the conceptions of time, the creation of the world, human nature, and the proper relationship between mankind and nature prevalent in [[Dinka mythology]], [[Maasai mythology]] and similar traditions.

====African Diaspora====
Some pre-Modern [[African Diaspora|African diaspor]]ic philosophical traditions have also been identified, mostly produced by descendants of Africans in Europe and the Americas. One notable pre-modern diasporic African philosopher was [[Anthony William Amo]], who was taken as a slave from Awukenu in what is now [[Ghana]], and was brought up and educated in Europe where he gained doctorates in medicine and philosophy, and subsequently became a professor of philosophy at the universities of [[University of Halle|Halle]] and [[University of Jena|Jena]] in Germany.

===Modern===
[[Kenya]]n philosopher [[Henry Odera Oruka]] has distinguished what he calls four trends in modern African philosophy: ethnophilosophy, philosophical sagacity, nationalistic&ndash;ideological philosophy, and professional philosophy.<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)">Samuel Oluoch Imbo, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0847688410 ''An Introduction to African Philosophy''] (1998), pp. 38-39, </ref> In fact it would be more realistic to call them candidates for the position of African philosophy, with the understanding that more than one of them might fit the bill. (Oruka later added two additional categories: literary/artistic philosophy, such as the work of literary figures such as [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], [[Wole Soyinka]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Okot p'Bitek]], and [[Taban Lo Liyong]], and hermeneutic philosophy, the analysis of African languages in order to find philosophical content.) In the African diaspora, American philosopher [[Maulana Karenga]] has also been notable in presenting varied definitions for understanding modern African philosophy, especially as it relates to its earliest sources.
[[File:Achille Mbembe 2.JPG|thumb|Achille Mbembe, a modern African philosopher]]
One notable contributor to professional philosophy is [[Achille Mbembe]]. He interacts with a multitude of modern subjects, including thoughts on statehood, death, capital, racism, and colonialism. His invokes attention to moral and political arguments through a tone of morality in his works. Many recent pieces from Mbembe, including ''Critique of Black Reason'', suggest that understanding Europe as a force not at the center of the universe is a point from which philosophy and society should view the world. Mbembe asserts that he positions himself in multiple worlds of existence at one time. This method creates an empathetic point from which the world can be viewed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/thinkers/mbembe-achille/|title=MBEMBE, Achille|last=says|first=Shaka Yesufu|website=GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|language=en|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>

===Ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity===
Ethnophilosophy has been used to record the beliefs found in African cultures. Such an approach treats African philosophy as consisting in a set of shared beliefs, values, categories, and assumptions that are implicit in the language, practices, and beliefs of African cultures; in short, the uniquely African [[worldview]]. As such, it is seen as an item of communal property rather than an activity for the individual.

One proponent of this form, [[Placide Tempels]], argued in ''[[Bantu Philosophy]]'' that the metaphysical categories of the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people are reflected in their linguistic categories. According to this view, African philosophy can be best understood as springing from the fundamental assumptions about reality reflected in the languages of Africa.

Another example of this sort of approach is the work of Ebiegberi Joe Alagoa of the [[University of Port Harcourt]] in [[Nigeria]], who argues for the existence of an African [[philosophy of history]] stemming from traditional proverbs from the [[Niger Delta]] in his paper "An African Philosophy of History in the Oral Tradition." Alagoa argues that in African philosophy, age is seen as an important factor in gaining wisdom and interpreting the past. In support of this view, he cites proverbs such as "More days, more wisdom", and "What an old man sees seated, a youth does not see standing." Truth is seen as eternal and unchanging ("Truth never rots"), but people are subject to error ("Even a four-legged horse stumbles and falls"). It is dangerous to judge by appearances ("A large eye does not mean keen vision"), but first-hand observation can be trusted ("He who sees does not err"). The past is not seen as fundamentally different from the present, but all history is contemporary history ("A storyteller does not tell of a different season"). The future remains beyond knowledge ("Even a bird with a long neck cannot see the future"). Nevertheless, it is said, "God will outlive eternity." History is seen as vitally important ("One ignorant of his origin is nonhuman"), and historians (known as "sons of the soil") are highly revered ("The son of the soil has the python's keen eyes"). However, these arguments must be taken with a grain of cultural relativism, as the span of culture in Africa is incredibly vast, with patriarchies, matriarchies, monotheists and traditional religionists among the population, and as such the attitudes of groups of the Niger Delta cannot be applied to the whole of Africa.

Another more controversial application of this approach is embodied in the concept of [[Negritude]]. [[Leopold Senghor]], a proponent of Negritude, argued that the distinctly African approach to reality is based on emotion rather than logic, works itself out in participation rather than analysis, and manifests itself through the arts rather than the sciences. [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] and Mubabinge Bilolo, on the other hand, while agreeing that African culture is unique, challenged the view of Africans as essentially emotional and artistic, arguing that Egypt was an African culture whose achievements in [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[architecture]], and [[philosophy]] were pre-eminent. This philosophy may also be maligned as overly [[reductionist]] due to the obvious scientific and scholarly triumphs of not only ancient Egypt, but also Nubia, Meroe, as well as the great library of Timbuktu, the extensive trade networks and kingdoms of North Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, the Horn of Africa and Great Zimbabwe and the other major empires of Southern, Southeast and Central Africa.

Critics of this approach argue that the actual philosophical work in producing a coherent philosophical position is being done by the academic philosopher (such as Alagoa), and that the sayings of the same culture can be selected from and organised in many different ways in order to produce very different, often contradictory systems of thought.

Philosophical sagacity is a sort of individualist version of ethnophilosophy, in which one records the beliefs of certain special members of a community. The premise here is that, although most societies demand some degree of conformity of belief and behaviour from their members, a certain few of those members reach a particularly high level of knowledge and understanding of their cultures' worldviews; such people are sages. In some cases, the sage goes beyond mere knowledge and understanding to reflection and questioning&mdash;these become the targets of philosophical sagacity.

Critics of this approach note that not all reflection and questioning is philosophical; besides, if African philosophy were to be defined purely in terms of philosophic sagacity, then the thoughts of the sages could not be African philosophy, for they did not record them from other sages. Also, on this view the only difference between non-African [[anthropology]] or [[ethnology]] and African philosophy seems to be the nationality of the researcher.

Critics argue further that the problem with both ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity is that there is surely an important distinction between philosophy and the [[history of ideas]], although other philosophers consider the two topics to be remarkably similar.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uWOnYFyGZcMC&pg=PA172&dq=ethnophilosophy+philosophy+history+of+ideas+the+same+or+not&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=ethnophilosophy%20philosophy%20history%20of%20ideas%20the%20same%20or%20not&f=false "Overview African Philosophy"], p. 172, ''One Hundred Philosophers'', Peter J. King, Zebra, 2006</ref> The argument is that no matter how interesting the beliefs of a people such as the [[Akan (ethnic group)|Akan]] or the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] may be to the philosopher, they remain beliefs, not philosophy. To call them philosophy is to use a secondary sense of that term, such as in "my philosophy is live and let live.

===Professional philosophy===
Professional philosophy is usually identified as that produced by African philosophers trained in the Western philosophical tradition, that embraces a universal view of the methods and concerns of philosophy.<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/> Those philosophers identified in this category often explicitly reject the assumptions of ethnophilosophy and adopt a universalist worldview of philosophy that requires all philosophy to be accessible and applicable to all peoples and cultures in the world<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/> This is even if the specific philosophical questions prioritized by individual national or regional philosophies may differ.<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/> Some African philosophers classified in this category are Paulin Hountondji, Peter Bodunrin, Kwasi Wiredu, Tsenay Serequeberhan, Marcien Towa and Lansana Keita.<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/>

===Nationalist and ideological philosophy===
{{see|African nationalism}}
Nationalist and ideological philosophy might be considered a special case of philosophic sagacity, in which not sages but ideologues are the subjects. Alternatively, it has been considered as a subcategory of professional political philosophy. In either case, the same sort of problem arises with retaining a distinction between ideology and philosophy, and also between sets of ideas and a special way of reasoning. Examples include [[African socialism]], [[Nkrumaism]], [[Harambee]] and [[Authenticite]]

===African ethics===
Although Africa is extremely diverse, there appear to be some shared moral ideas across many ethnic groups.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> In a number of African cultures, ethics is centered on a person's character, and saying "he has no morals" translates as something like "he has no character".<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> A person's character reflects the accumulation of her deeds and her habits of conduct; hence, it can be changed over a person's life.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> In some African cultures, "personhood" refers to an adult human who exhibits moral virtues, and one who behaves badly is not considered a person, even if he is considered a human.<ref name=Gyekye2010>{{cite journal|last1=Gyekye|first1=Kwame|title=African Ethics|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=9 Sep 2010|volume=Fall 2011 Edition|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/african-ethics/|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref>

While many traditional African societies are highly religious, [[Traditional African religions|their religions]] are not revealed, and hence, ethics does not center around divine commands.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> Instead, ethics is [[humanistic]] and [[utilitarian]]: it focuses on improving social functioning and human flourishing.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> On the other hand, social welfare is not a mere aggregate of individual welfare; rather, there is a collective "social good" embodying values that everyone wants, like peace and stability.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> In general, African ethics is social or collectivistic rather than individualistic and united in ideology.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> Cooperation and altruism are considered crucial.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> African ethics places more weight on duties of prosocial behaviour than on rights per se, in contrast to most of Western ethics.<ref name=Gyekye2010 />

===Africana philosophy===
{{Main|Africana philosophy}}
Africana philosophy is the work of philosophers of African descent and others whose work deals with the subject matter of the [[African diaspora]]. This is a relatively new (since the 1980s) and developing name given to African thought, and it is given credible attention by professional organizations, including the American Philosophical Association. <ref>{{Citation|last=Outlaw Jr.|first=Lucius T.|title=Africana Philosophy|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/africana/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref> 

Africana philosophy includes the philosophical ideas, arguments and theories of particular concern to people of African descent. Some of the topics explored by Africana philosophy include: pre-Socratic African philosophy and modern day debates discussing the early history of [[Western philosophy]], post-colonial writing in Africa and the Americas, black resistance to oppression, [[black existentialism]] in the United States, and the meaning of "blackness" in the modern world.<ref name="Gyekye2010" />

'''African philosophy''' is the philosophical discourse produced by indigenous Africans and their descendants, including African Americans. African philosophers may be found in the various academic fields of philosophy, such as [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[Ethics|moral philosophy]], and [[political philosophy]]. One particular subject that many African philosophers have written about is that on the subject of freedom and what it means to be free or to experience wholeness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mucale|first=Ergimino Pedro|date=Fall 2015|title=The Libertarian Paradigm in Ngoenha: A Contribution to the African Philosophy|journal=Philosophia Africana|volume= 17|pages=45–54}}</ref> Philosophy in Africa has a rich and varied history, some of which has been lost over time.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Holton|first=Robert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BIRZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA124 |title=World Civilizations And History Of Human Development|last2=Nasson|first2=William Richard|date=2009-09-29|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=978-1-84826-213-3|language=en}}</ref> One of the earliest known African philosophers was [[Ptahhotep]], an ancient Egyptian philosopher. In the early and mid-twentieth century, anti-colonial movements had a tremendous effect on the development of a distinct African [[political philosophy]] that had resonance on both the continent and in the African diaspora. One well-known example of the economic philosophical works emerging from this period was the [[African socialist]] philosophy of [[Ujamaa]] propounded in Tanzania and other parts of [[Southeast Africa]]. These African political and economic philosophical developments also had a notable impact on the anti-colonial movements of many non-African peoples around the world.

==Definition==
There is some debate in defining the [[Ethnophilosophy|ethnophilosophical]] parameters of African philosophy and identifying what differentiates it from other philosophical traditions. One of the implicit assumptions of [[ethnophilosophy]] is that a specific culture can have a philosophy that is not applicable and accessible to all peoples and cultures in the world. In ''A Discourse on African Philosophy: A New Perspective on Ubuntu and Transitional Justice in South Africa'', Christian B. N. Gade argues that the ethnophilosophical approach to African philosophy as a static group property is highly problematic. His research on ubuntu presents an alternative collective discourse on African philosophy that takes differences, historical developments, and social contexts seriously. According to [[Edwin Etieyibo]] and Jonathon O. Chimakonam in their article “African Philosophy: Past, Present, and Future”, historical context plays an important role in African philosophy. History provides the framework in which we can inspect philosophical problems. In terms of African philosophy, one must look at the whole picture through the lens of African history.  “There are no facts without history." <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Etieyibo|first=Edwin|last2=Chimakonam|first2=Jonathan|date=Fall 2015|title=African Philosophy: Past, Present, and Future|journal=Philosophia Africana}}</ref>

African philosophy can be formally defined as a critical thinking by Africans on their experiences of reality. Nigerian born Philosopher K.C. Anyanwu defined African philosophy as "that which concerns itself with the way in which African people of the past and present make sense of their destiny and of the world in which they live.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=R.S.|title=Authority, Responsibility and Education|date=1959|publisher=G. Allen & Unwin|location=London}}</ref>

Nigerian philosopher Joseph I. Omoregbe broadly defines a philosopher as one who attempts to understand the world's phenomena, the purpose of human existence, the nature of the world, and the place of human beings in that world. This form of [[natural philosophy]] is identifiable in Africa even before individual African philosophers can be distinguished in the sources.<ref>Maurice Muhatia Makumba, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9966082964 An Introduction to African Philosophy: Past and Present] (2007), p. 25.</ref> Like [[Western philosophy]], African philosophy contemplates the perceptions of time, personhood, space and other subjects.

== History ==
African philosophy's beginning is linked to the 1920s. African individuals who had studied in the United States and Europe ("Western" locations) had returned to Africa and reflected on the racial discrimination experienced abroad. Their arrival back in Africa instigated a feeling of onuma, which is an interpretation of "frustration." The onuma was felt in response to legacies of colonialism on a global scale. The beginning of African philosophy is important because onuma inspired some who had traveled and returned to formulate a "systematic beginning" of philosophizing the African identity, the space of African people in history, and African contribution to humanity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/afric-hi/#H3|title=History of African Philosophy|last=Chimakonam|first=Jonathan|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>

== Criteria ==
Two conflicting components are deemed integral to a work for it to be considered African philosophy. First, the piece must have a racial focus. This facet is valued by Traditionalist groups, who posit that African philosophy should be an expression of the world experienced by African individuals. African philosophy must be produced by African authors. In contrast, Universalist groups suggest that African philosophy should be analyses and critical engagement of and between individual African thinkers. A work is African philosophy based on a focal point of tradition. African philosophy must pull from African cultural backgrounds or thought processes, but it should be independent from racial considerations and use "African" only as a term of solidarity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Essay in African Philosophical Thought: The Akan Conceptual Scheme|last=Gyeke|first=Kwame|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|location=Cambridge}}</ref>

== Methods ==

=== Communitarian method ===
The communitarian method of African philosophy emphasizes mutualism in thought. It is most commonly used by researchers following ubuntu. The common expression of ubuntu is that "a person is a person through a person." Leonhard Praeg, Mogobe Ramose, and Fainos Mangera implement the communitarian method.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=On Defining African Philosophy|last=Wiredu|first=Kwasi|publisher=APP Publications|year=1989}}</ref>

=== Complementary method ===
The complementary method focuses on the prospect of a missing link. All variables are important in consideration of histories and identities, and no variable should be overlooked or under-considered. Additionally, all variables affect one another, so the relationship between them and their affects on other variables should be scrutinized. Mesembe Edet implements the complementary method.<ref name=":0" />

=== Conversational method ===
The conversational method creates thought by assessing a relationship between oppositional works. The defender or proponent is named "nwa-swa," and the nwa swa is questioned and doubted by a disagreeing party, known as "nwa nju." The conversational method emphasizes the interconnectedness of networks within reality; the more accurate a thought should be, the more specific a location should be. This method is endorsed by the Conventional School of Psychology, and it is used by Victor Nweke and Msembe Edet.<ref name=":0" />

==Types==

===Pre-modern===
====North Africa====
In [[North Africa]], arguably central to the development of the [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy|ancient Egyptian philosoph]]ical tradition of Egypt and Sudan was the conception of "[[ma'at]]", which roughly translated refers to "justice", "truth", or simply "that which is right". One of the earliest works of political philosophy was [[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]], which were taught to Egyptian schoolboys for centuries.

Ancient Egypt have several philosophical texts that have been treated by scholars in recent years. In the 2018 podcast "Africana Philosophy", the philosophers [[Peter Adamson (philosopher)|Peter Adamson]] and Chike Jeffers devoted the first eight episodes to [[Ancient Egyptian philosophy|Egyptian philosophy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historyofphilosophy.net/africana/precolonial|title=Locating and Debating Precolonial African Philosophy {{!}} History of Philosophy without any gaps|website=historyofphilosophy.net|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> The [[American Philosophical Association]] (APA) has published a text on the classical text "[[The Immortality of Writers]]" ("Be A Writer"), ca. 1200 BCE. The Blog of the APA article also covers “[[Dispute between a man and his Ba|The Dispute Between a Man and His Ba]]” of 19th century BCE; “[[The Teaching of Ani]]”, 13th century BCE, which gives advice to the ordinary man; “[[The Satire of the Trades]]” by Khety; and the text of Amennakht (active in 1170–1140 BCE) from [[Deir el-Medina|Deir El-Medina]], whose teaching states that “it is good to finish school, better than the smell of lotus blossoms in summer.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.apaonline.org/2018/12/17/the-radical-philosophy-of-egypt-forget-god-and-family-write/|title=The Radical Philosophy of Egypt: Forget God and Family, Write!|last=Contributor|first=Blog|date=2018-12-17|website=Blog of the APA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> 

Ancient Egyptian philosophers also made important contributions to [[Hellenistic philosophy]] and [[Christian philosophy]]. According to ''Busiris'' by the ancient Greek philosopher [[Isocrates]], the senior of [[Plato]], “all men agree the Egyptians are the healthiest and most long of life among men; and then for the soul they introduced philosophy’s training…”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.apaonline.org/2018/12/17/the-radical-philosophy-of-egypt-forget-god-and-family-write/|title=The Radical Philosophy of Egypt: Forget God and Family, Write!|last=Contributor|first=Blog|date=2018-12-17|website=Blog of the APA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>

Isocrates declared that Greek writers traveled to Egypt to seek knowledge; one of them [[Pythagoras]] of Samos who “was first to bring to the Greeks all philosophy.” 

In the Hellenistic tradition, the influential philosophical school of [[Neoplatonism]] was founded by the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] philosopher [[Plotinus]] in the 3rd century CE.

====West Africa====
The most prominent of [[West Africa]]'s pre-modern philosophical traditions has been identified as that of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] philosophical tradition and the distinctive worldview that emerged from it over the thousands of years of its development. Philosophical concepts such as [[Omoluabi]], [[Aṣẹ|Ashè]] and [[Emi Omo Eso]] were integral to this system, and the totality of its elements are contained in what is known amongst the Yoruba as the [[Yoruba mythology|Itan]]. The cosmologies and philosophies of the [[Akan people|Akan]], [[Dogon people|Dogon]], [[Serer creation myth|Serer]] and [[Dahomey]] were also significant.

In pre-colonial [[Senegambia]] (modern [[Gambia]] and [[Senegal]]), the 17th-century philosopher [[Kocc Barma Fall]] stood out as one of the renowned philosophers in [[:Category:History of Senegambia|Senegambian history]]. His proverbs are still recited by Senegalese and Gambians alike, including in Senegambian popular culture - for example in [[Ousmane Sembene]]'s films such as ''[[Guelwaar]]''<ref>Ware, Rudolph T., ''The Walking Qurʼan: Islamic Education, Embodied Knowledge, and History in West Africa,'' UNC Press Books (2014), p. 101, {{ISBN|9781469614311}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gRGpAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref><ref>Murphy, David, ''Sembene: Imagining Alternatives in Film & Fiction.'' James Currey Publishers (200), p. 63, {{ISBN|978-0-85255-555-2}}</ref> Other notable philosophical thinkers include the Gambian historian [[Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof]], and the [[Mali]]an ethnologist [[Amadou Hampâté Bâ]].

====Horn of Africa====
In the [[Horn of Africa]], there are a number of sources documenting the development of a distinct [[Ethiopian philosophy]] from the first millennium onwards. Among the most notable examples from this tradition emerge from the work of the 17th-century philosopher [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]], and that of his disciple [[Walda Heywat]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/yacob-and-amo-africas-precursors-to-locke-hume-and-kant|title=Yacob and Amo: Africa’s precursors to Locke, Hume and Kant – Dag Herbjørnsrud {{!}} Aeon Essays|website=Aeon|language=en|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref> Yacob in his writings discusses religion, morality, and existence. He comes to the belief that every person will believe their faith to be the right one and that all men are created equal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ethiopian Philosophy|last=Sumner|first=Claude|year=1994}}</ref>

====Southern Africa====
In [[Southern Africa]] and [[Southeast Africa]] the development of a distinctive [[Bantu Philosophy|Bantu philosophy]] addressing the nature of existence, the cosmos and humankind's relation to the world following the [[Bantu migration]] has had the most significant impact on the philosophical developments of the said regions, with the development of the philosophy of [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]] as one notable example emerging from this worldview.

====Central Africa====
Many [[Central Africa]]n philosophical traditions before the [[Bantu migration]] into southern [[Central Africa]] have been identified as a uniting characteristic of many [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] and [[Sudanic languages|Sudanic]] peoples, ultimately giving rise to the distinctive worldviews identified in the conceptions of time, the creation of the world, human nature, and the proper relationship between mankind and nature prevalent in [[Dinka mythology]], [[Maasai mythology]] and similar traditions.

====African Diaspora====
Some pre-Modern [[African Diaspora|African diaspor]]ic philosophical traditions have also been identified, mostly produced by descendants of Africans in Europe and the Americas. One notable pre-modern diasporic African philosopher was [[Anthony William Amo]], who was taken as a slave from Awukenu in what is now [[Ghana]], and was brought up and educated in Europe where he gained doctorates in medicine and philosophy, and subsequently became a professor of philosophy at the universities of [[University of Halle|Halle]] and [[University of Jena|Jena]] in Germany.

===Modern===
[[Kenya]]n philosopher [[Henry Odera Oruka]] has distinguished what he calls four trends in modern African philosophy: ethnophilosophy, philosophical sagacity, nationalistic&ndash;ideological philosophy, and professional philosophy.<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)">Samuel Oluoch Imbo, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0847688410 ''An Introduction to African Philosophy''] (1998), pp. 38-39, </ref> In fact it would be more realistic to call them candidates for the position of African philosophy, with the understanding that more than one of them might fit the bill. (Oruka later added two additional categories: literary/artistic philosophy, such as the work of literary figures such as [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], [[Wole Soyinka]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Okot p'Bitek]], and [[Taban Lo Liyong]], and hermeneutic philosophy, the analysis of African languages in order to find philosophical content.) In the African diaspora, American philosopher [[Maulana Karenga]] has also been notable in presenting varied definitions for understanding modern African philosophy, especially as it relates to its earliest sources.
[[File:Achille Mbembe 2.JPG|thumb|Achille Mbembe, a modern African philosopher]]
One notable contributor to professional philosophy is [[Achille Mbembe]]. He interacts with a multitude of modern subjects, including thoughts on statehood, death, capital, racism, and colonialism. His invokes attention to moral and political arguments through a tone of morality in his works. Many recent pieces from Mbembe, including ''Critique of Black Reason'', suggest that understanding Europe as a force not at the center of the universe is a point from which philosophy and society should view the world. Mbembe asserts that he positions himself in multiple worlds of existence at one time. This method creates an empathetic point from which the world can be viewed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/thinkers/mbembe-achille/|title=MBEMBE, Achille|last=says|first=Shaka Yesufu|website=GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|language=en|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref>

===Ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity===
Ethnophilosophy has been used to record the beliefs found in African cultures. Such an approach treats African philosophy as consisting in a set of shared beliefs, values, categories, and assumptions that are implicit in the language, practices, and beliefs of African cultures; in short, the uniquely African [[worldview]]. As such, it is seen as an item of communal property rather than an activity for the individual.

One proponent of this form, [[Placide Tempels]], argued in ''[[Bantu Philosophy]]'' that the metaphysical categories of the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people are reflected in their linguistic categories. According to this view, African philosophy can be best understood as springing from the fundamental assumptions about reality reflected in the languages of Africa.

Another example of this sort of approach is the work of Ebiegberi Joe Alagoa of the [[University of Port Harcourt]] in [[Nigeria]], who argues for the existence of an African [[philosophy of history]] stemming from traditional proverbs from the [[Niger Delta]] in his paper "An African Philosophy of History in the Oral Tradition." Alagoa argues that in African philosophy, age is seen as an important factor in gaining wisdom and interpreting the past. In support of this view, he cites proverbs such as "More days, more wisdom", and "What an old man sees seated, a youth does not see standing." Truth is seen as eternal and unchanging ("Truth never rots"), but people are subject to error ("Even a four-legged horse stumbles and falls"). It is dangerous to judge by appearances ("A large eye does not mean keen vision"), but first-hand observation can be trusted ("He who sees does not err"). The past is not seen as fundamentally different from the present, but all history is contemporary history ("A storyteller does not tell of a different season"). The future remains beyond knowledge ("Even a bird with a long neck cannot see the future"). Nevertheless, it is said, "God will outlive eternity." History is seen as vitally important ("One ignorant of his origin is nonhuman"), and historians (known as "sons of the soil") are highly revered ("The son of the soil has the python's keen eyes"). However, these arguments must be taken with a grain of cultural relativism, as the span of culture in Africa is incredibly vast, with patriarchies, matriarchies, monotheists and traditional religionists among the population, and as such the attitudes of groups of the Niger Delta cannot be applied to the whole of Africa.

Another more controversial application of this approach is embodied in the concept of [[Negritude]]. [[Leopold Senghor]], a proponent of Negritude, argued that the distinctly African approach to reality is based on emotion rather than logic, works itself out in participation rather than analysis, and manifests itself through the arts rather than the sciences. [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] and Mubabinge Bilolo, on the other hand, while agreeing that African culture is unique, challenged the view of Africans as essentially emotional and artistic, arguing that Egypt was an African culture whose achievements in [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[architecture]], and [[philosophy]] were pre-eminent. This philosophy may also be maligned as overly [[reductionist]] due to the obvious scientific and scholarly triumphs of not only ancient Egypt, but also Nubia, Meroe, as well as the great library of Timbuktu, the extensive trade networks and kingdoms of North Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, the Horn of Africa and Great Zimbabwe and the other major empires of Southern, Southeast and Central Africa.

Critics of this approach argue that the actual philosophical work in producing a coherent philosophical position is being done by the academic philosopher (such as Alagoa), and that the sayings of the same culture can be selected from and organised in many different ways in order to produce very different, often contradictory systems of thought.

Philosophical sagacity is a sort of individualist version of ethnophilosophy, in which one records the beliefs of certain special members of a community. The premise here is that, although most societies demand some degree of conformity of belief and behaviour from their members, a certain few of those members reach a particularly high level of knowledge and understanding of their cultures' worldviews; such people are sages. In some cases, the sage goes beyond mere knowledge and understanding to reflection and questioning&mdash;these become the targets of philosophical sagacity.

Critics of this approach note that not all reflection and questioning is philosophical; besides, if African philosophy were to be defined purely in terms of philosophic sagacity, then the thoughts of the sages could not be African philosophy, for they did not record them from other sages. Also, on this view the only difference between non-African [[anthropology]] or [[ethnology]] and African philosophy seems to be the nationality of the researcher.

Critics argue further that the problem with both ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity is that there is surely an important distinction between philosophy and the [[history of ideas]], although other philosophers consider the two topics to be remarkably similar.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uWOnYFyGZcMC&pg=PA172&dq=ethnophilosophy+philosophy+history+of+ideas+the+same+or+not&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=ethnophilosophy%20philosophy%20history%20of%20ideas%20the%20same%20or%20not&f=false "Overview African Philosophy"], p. 172, ''One Hundred Philosophers'', Peter J. King, Zebra, 2006</ref> The argument is that no matter how interesting the beliefs of a people such as the [[Akan (ethnic group)|Akan]] or the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] may be to the philosopher, they remain beliefs, not philosophy. To call them philosophy is to use a secondary sense of that term, such as in "my philosophy is live and let live.

===Professional philosophy===
Professional philosophy is usually identified as that produced by African philosophers trained in the Western philosophical tradition, that embraces a universal view of the methods and concerns of philosophy.<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/> Those philosophers identified in this category often explicitly reject the assumptions of ethnophilosophy and adopt a universalist worldview of philosophy that requires all philosophy to be accessible and applicable to all peoples and cultures in the world<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/> This is even if the specific philosophical questions prioritized by individual national or regional philosophies may differ.<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/> Some African philosophers classified in this category are Paulin Hountondji, Peter Bodunrin, Kwasi Wiredu, Tsenay Serequeberhan, Marcien Towa and Lansana Keita.<ref name="Samuel Oluoch Imbo, An Introduction to African Philosophy (1998)"/>

===Nationalist and ideological philosophy===
{{see|African nationalism}}
Nationalist and ideological philosophy might be considered a special case of philosophic sagacity, in which not sages but ideologues are the subjects. Alternatively, it has been considered as a subcategory of professional political philosophy. In either case, the same sort of problem arises with retaining a distinction between ideology and philosophy, and also between sets of ideas and a special way of reasoning. Examples include [[African socialism]], [[Nkrumaism]], [[Harambee]] and [[Authenticite]]

===African ethics===
Although Africa is extremely diverse, there appear to be some shared moral ideas across many ethnic groups.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> In a number of African cultures, ethics is centered on a person's character, and saying "he has no morals" translates as something like "he has no character".<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> A person's character reflects the accumulation of her deeds and her habits of conduct; hence, it can be changed over a person's life.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> In some African cultures, "personhood" refers to an adult human who exhibits moral virtues, and one who behaves badly is not considered a person, even if he is considered a human.<ref name=Gyekye2010>{{cite journal|last1=Gyekye|first1=Kwame|title=African Ethics|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=9 Sep 2010|volume=Fall 2011 Edition|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/african-ethics/|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref>

While many traditional African societies are highly religious, [[Traditional African religions|their religions]] are not revealed, and hence, ethics does not center around divine commands.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> Instead, ethics is [[humanistic]] and [[utilitarian]]: it focuses on improving social functioning and human flourishing.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> On the other hand, social welfare is not a mere aggregate of individual welfare; rather, there is a collective "social good" embodying values that everyone wants, like peace and stability.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> In general, African ethics is social or collectivistic rather than individualistic and united in ideology.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> Cooperation and altruism are considered crucial.<ref name=Gyekye2010 /> African ethics places more weight on duties of prosocial behaviour than on rights per se, in contrast to most of Western ethics.<ref name=Gyekye2010 />

===Africana philosophy===
{{Main|Africana philosophy}}
Africana philosophy is the work of philosophers of African descent and others whose work deals with the subject matter of the [[African diaspora]]. This is a relatively new (since the 1980s) and developing name given to African thought, and it is given credible attention by professional organizations, including the American Philosophical Association. <ref>{{Citation|last=Outlaw Jr.|first=Lucius T.|title=Africana Philosophy|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/africana/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-12-17}}</ref> 

Africana philosophy includes the philosophical ideas, arguments and theories of particular concern to people of African descent. Some of the topics explored by Africana philosophy include: pre-Socratic African philosophy and modern day debates discussing the early history of [[Western philosophy]], post-colonial writing in Africa and the Americas, black resistance to oppression, [[black existentialism]] in the United States, and the meaning of "blackness" in the modern world.<ref name="Gyekye2010" />
