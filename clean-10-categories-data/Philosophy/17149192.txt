'''Philosophy of design''' is the study of definitions of design, and the assumptions, foundations, and implications of [[design]].  The field, which is mostly a sub-discipline of aesthetics, is defined by an interest in a set of problems, or an interest in central or foundational concerns in design.  In addition to these central problems for design as a whole, many philosophers of design consider these problems as they apply to particular disciplines (e.g. [[philosophy of art]]).  Although most practitioners are [[philosopher]]s of [[aesthetics]] (i.e., aestheticians), several prominent [[designer]]s and [[artist]]s have contributed to the field. For an introduction to the philosophy of design see the article by Per Galle<ref name="Galle Philosophy Intro">{{cite web|last1=Galle|first1=Per|title=Philosophy of Design|url=https://kadk.dk/en/cephad/philosophy-design-introduction|website=KADK|accessdate=31 December 2016}}</ref> at the Royal Danish Academy.
