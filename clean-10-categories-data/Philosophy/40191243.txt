The '''eternal feminine''' is a psychological [[archetype]] or philosophical principle that idealizes an immutable concept of "woman". It is one component of [[gender essentialism]], the belief that men and women have different core "essences" that cannot be altered by time or environment.<ref>Susan Abraham, "Justice as the Mark of Catholic Feminist Ecclesiology," in ''Frontiers in Catholic Feminist Theology: Shoulder to Shoulder'' (Fortress Press, 2009), p. 207.</ref> The conceptual ideal was particularly vivid in the 19th century, when women were often depicted as angelic, responsible for drawing men upward on a moral and spiritual path.<ref>Frances Nesbitt Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender: Beyond Man And Woman'', pp. 6–7, 16–17, 22 ''et passim''.</ref> Among those virtues variously regarded as essentially feminine are "modesty, gracefulness, purity, delicacy, civility, compliancy, reticence, chastity, affability, [and] politeness".<ref>Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar, ''The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination'' (Yale University Press, 2nd ed. 2000, originally published 1979), p. 23.</ref>

The concept of the "eternal feminine" ({{lang-de|das Ewig-Weibliche}}) was particularly important to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], who introduces it at the end of ''[[Faust (Goethe)|Faust]]'', Part 2.<ref>Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender'', p. 16.</ref> For Goethe, "woman" symbolized pure contemplation, in contrast to masculine action, parallel to the eastern Daoist descriptions of Yin and Yang.<ref>Gilbert and Gubar, ''The Madwoman in the Attic,'' p. 21.</ref> The feminine principle is further articulated by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] within a continuity of life and death, based in large part on his readings of [[ancient Greek literature]], since in Greek culture both childbirth and the care of the dead were managed by women.<ref>Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender'', p. 4.</ref> [[wikt:domesticity|Domesticity]], and the power to redeem and serve as moral guardian, were also components of the "eternal feminine".<ref>Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender'', p. 4.</ref> The virtues of women were inherently private, while those of men were public.<ref>Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender'', p. 7.</ref>

==In popular culture==
In [[Wide is the Gate]], the fourth novel of the "Lanny Budd" series by [[Upton Sinclair]], Lanny says to Gertrud Schultz, "What Goethe calls ''das ewig weibliche'' is seldom out of my consciousness; I don’t think it is ever entirely out of any man’s consciousness."
