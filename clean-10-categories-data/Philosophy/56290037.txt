'''''At the Existentialist Café: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails''''' is a 2016 book written by [[Sarah Bakewell]] that covers the philosophy and history of the 20th century movement [[existentialism]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bakewell|first1=Sarah|title=At the Existentialist Cafe: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails|date=2016|publisher=Other Books|location=New York, New York|edition=1st}}</ref> The book provides a very accurate account of the modern day existentialists who came into their own before and during the second world war. The book discusses the ideas of the phenomenologist Edmund Husserl, and how his teaching influenced the rise of existentialism through the likes of Martin Heidegger, Jean Paul Sartre, Simone De Beauvoir, who are the main protagonists of the book. The title refers to an incident in which Sartre's close friend and fellow philosopher Raymond Aron startled him when they were in a cafe, by pointing to the glass in front of him and stating, "You can make a philosophy out of this cocktail."
