'''17th-century philosophy''' is generally regarded as seeing the start of [[modern philosophy]], and the shaking off of the medieval approach, especially [[scholasticism]]. It succeeded the [[Renaissance]] and preceded the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It is often considered to be part of [[early modern philosophy]].

==History==
The period is usually taken to start in the seventeenth century with the work of [[René Descartes]], who set much of the agenda as well as much of the methodology for those who came after him. The period is typified in Europe by the great system-builders &mdash; philosophers who present unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]] and [[ethics]], and often [[politics]] and the physical sciences too. [[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1 "Immanuel Kant: Metaphysics"] ([[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]])</ref> and [[early modern philosophy]] is often characterised in terms of a conflict between these schools.

The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Building upon their English predecessors [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]], the three main empiricists were [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]]. The former were distinguished by the belief that, in principle (though not in practice), all knowledge can be gained by the power of our reason alone; the latter rejected this, believing that all knowledge has to come through the senses, from experience. Thus the rationalists took [[mathematics]] as their model for knowledge, and the empiricists took the [[physical sciences]]. 

This period also saw the birth of some of the classics of [[political philosophy]], especially [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', and [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''.

The seventeenth century in Europe saw the culmination of the slow process of detachment of philosophy from [[theology]]. Thus, while philosophers still talked about &ndash; and even offered arguments for the existence of &ndash; a [[deity]], this was done in the service of philosophical argument and thought. (In the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the "Age of Reason", [[18th-century philosophy]] was to go still further, leaving theology and [[religion]] behind altogether.)
