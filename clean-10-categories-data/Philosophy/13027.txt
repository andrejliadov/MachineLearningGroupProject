'''Jinn''' ({{lang-ar|جن}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|jinn}}''), also [[Romanization of Arabic|Romanized]] as '''djinn''' or [[Anglicization|Anglicized]] as '''genies''' (with the broader meaning of [[spirit]]s or [[demon]]s, depending on source),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/jinn|title=jinn – Definition of jinn in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries – English}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 22 (German)</ref> are [[supernatural]] creatures in early pre-Islamic [[Arabian mythology|Arabian]] and later [[Islamic mythology]] and [[Islamic theology|theology]]. Like humans, they are created with ''[[fitra]]'', neither born as believers nor as unbelievers, but their attitude depends on whether they accept God's guidance.<ref>Abu l-Lait as-Samarqandi's Comentary on Abu Hanifa al-Fiqh al-absat Introduction, Text and Commentary by Hans Daiber ''Islamic concept of Belief in the 4th/10th Century'' Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa p. 243</ref> Since jinn are neither innately evil nor innately good, Islam acknowledged spirits from other religions, and was able to adapt spirits from other religions during its expansion. Jinn are not a strictly Islamic concept; they may represent several [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pagan]] beliefs integrated into Islam.{{efn|"M. Dols points out that jinn-belief is not a strictly Islamic concept. It rather includes countless elements of idol-worship, as Muhammad's enemies practised in Mecca during ''jahilliya''. According to F. Meier early Islam integrated many pagan deities into its system by degrading them to spirits. 1. In Islam, the existence of spirits that are neither angels nor necessarily devils is acknowledged. 2. Thereby Islam is able to incorporate non-biblical[,] non-Quranic ideas about mythic images, that means: a. degrading deities to spirits and therefore taking into the spiritual world. b. taking daemons, not mentioned in the sacred traditions of Islam, of uncertain origin. c. consideration of spirits to tolerate or advising to regulate them." Original: "M. Dols macht darauf aufmerksam, dass der Ginn-Glaube kein strikt islamisches Konzept ist. Er beinhaltet vielmehr zahllose Elemente einer Götzenverehrung, wie sie Muhammads Gegner zur Zeit der ''gahiliyya'' in Mekka praktizierten. Gemäß F. Meier integrierte der junge Islam bei seiner raschen Expansion viele heidnische Gottheiten in sein System, indem er sie zu Dämonen degradierte. 1. Im Islam wird die Existenz von Geistern, die weder Engel noch unbedingt Teufel sein müssen, anerkannt. 2. Damit besitzt der Islam die Möglichkeit, nicht-biblische[,] nicht koranische Vorstellungen von mythischen Vorstellungen sich einzuverleiben, d.h.: a. Götter zu Geistern zu erniedrigen und so ins islamische Geisterreich aufzunehmen. b. in der heiligen Überlieferung des Islams nicht eigens genannte Dämonen beliebiger Herkunft zu übernehmen. c. eine Berücksichtigung der Geister zu dulden oder gar zu empfehlen und sie zu regeln."<ref>Tobias Nünlist Dämonenglaube im Islam Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 2 (German)</ref>|name=|group=}}<ref>Jane Dammen McAuliffe Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān Brill: VOlume 3, 2005 {{ISBN|9789004123564}} p. 45</ref>

In an Islamic context, the term ''jinn'' is used for both a collective designation for any supernatural creature and also to refer to a specific type of supernatural creature.<ref>Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 67 (German)</ref> Therefore, jinn are often mentioned together with [[Shaitan|devils]]/demons (''shayāṭīn''). Both devils and jinn feature in [[Folk religion#Folk Islam|folklore]] and are held responsible for misfortune, possession and diseases. However, the jinn are sometimes supportive and benevolent. They are mentioned frequently in magical works throughout the Islamic world, to be summoned and bound to a sorcerer, but also in [[Science in the medieval Islamic world#Fields of inquiry|zoological treatises]] as animals with a subtle body.

==Etymology==
''Jinn'' is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[collective number|collective noun]] deriving from the [[Semitic root]] {{sc|jnn}} ({{lang-ar|جَنّ / جُنّ}}, ''jann''), whose primary meaning is "to hide" or "to adapt". Some authors interpret the word to mean, literally, "beings that are concealed from the senses".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |title=An Arabic-English Lexicon |author=Edward William Lane |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408021742/http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |archive-date= 8 April 2015 }}. p. 462.</ref> [[Cognate]]s include the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|majnūn}}'' (<big>مَجْنُون</big>, "possessed", or generally "insane"), ''{{transl|ar|ALA|jannah}}'' (<big>جَنَّة</big>, "garden", "eden" also “heaven”), and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|janīn}}'' (<big>جَنِين</big>, "embryo").<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic |last=Wehr |first=Hans |author-link=Hans Wehr |year=1994 |edition=4 |publisher=Spoken Language Services |location=Urbana, Illinois |isbn=978-0-87950-003-0 |page=164|title-link=Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic }}</ref> ''Jinn'' is properly treated as a plural (however in [[Classical Arabic]], may also appear as ''jānn'' <big>جَانّ</big>), with the singular being ''jinnī'' (<big>جِنِّيّ</big>). {{Efn|sometimes Arabs use Jānn ({{lang-ar|جان}}) term for singular, jānn also referred to jinn world, another plural, snakes/serpents and [[Jann (legendary creature)|another type of jinn]]}}

The origin of the word ''jinn'' remains uncertain.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
Some scholars relate the Arabic term jinn to the Latin genius, as a result of syncretism during the reign of the Roman empire under [[Tiberius]] Augustus,<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 38</ref> but this derivation is also disputed.<ref>Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 25 (German)</ref> Another suggestion holds that jinn may be derived from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] "ginnaya" ({{lang-syc|ܓܢܬܐ}}) with the meaning of "[[tutelary deity]]",<ref>Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 24 (German)</ref> or also "garden". Others claim a [[Persian language|Persian]] origin of the word, in the form of the [[Avestic]] "Jaini", a wicked (female) spirit. Jaini were among various creatures in the possibly even pre-Zoroastrian mythology of peoples of Iran.<ref>[[Tisdall, W. St. Clair]].

The [[Anglicization|Anglicized]] form ''genie'' is a borrowing of the French ''{{lang|fr|génie}}'', from the [[Latin]] ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'', a guardian spirit of people and places in [[ancient Roman religion|Roman religion]]. It first appeared<ref name=oed>''Oxford English Dictionary'', 3rd&nbsp;ed. "genie, ''n''."

But although their mortality ranks them lower than gods, it seems veneration of jinn had played more importance in the everyday life of pre-Islamic Arabs than the gods themselves. According to common Arabian belief, [[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]]s, pre-Islamic philosophers, and poets were inspired by the jinn.<ref name="ReferenceB" /><ref name="Lebling1–10" /> Their culture and society were analogous to that pre-Islamic Arabian culture, with tribal leaders, protected their allies and avenge murder for any member of their tribe or allies. Although the powers of jinn exceed those of humans, it is conceivable a man could kill a jinni in single combat. Jinn were thought to shift into different shapes, but were feared especially in their invisible form, since then they could attack without being seen.<ref>Umar F.

==Islamic theology==
=== In scripture ===

{{see also|Islamic mythology}} 

Jinn are mentioned approximately 29 times in the [[Quran]].<ref>Robert Lebling (30 July 2010). Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar. I.B.Tauris. p. 21 {{ISBN|978-0-85773-063-3}}</ref> In Islamic tradition, [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] was sent as a [[prophets of Islam|prophet]] to both human and jinn communities, and that prophets and messengers were sent to both communities.<ref>{{Quran-usc|51|56|end=56|style=nosup}}</ref><ref>Muḥammad ibn Ayyūb al-Ṭabarī, ''Tuḥfat al-gharā’ib'', I, p. 68; Abū al-Futūḥ Rāzī, ''Tafsīr-e rawḥ al-jenān va rūḥ al-janān'', pp. 193, 341</ref> Traditionally [[Al-Jinn|Surah 72]], named after them ([[Al-Jinn]]), is held to tell about the revelation to jinn and several stories mention one of Muhammad's followers accompanied him, witnessing the revelation to the jinn.<ref name="ReferenceD">Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 64</ref> They appear with different attitudes.<ref>Paul Arno Eichler: Die Dschinn, Teufel und Engel in Koran. 1928 P. 16-32 (German)</ref> In the story of [[Solomon in Islam|Solomon]] they appear as [[nature spirits]] comparable to Talmudic [[shedim]]. Solomon was gifted by God to talk to animals and spirits. God granted him authority over the rebellious jinn and devils forcing them to build the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]]. In other instances, the Quran tells about Pagan Arabs, calling jinn for help, instead of God. The Quran reduced the status of jinn from that of tutelary deities to that of minor spirits, usually paralleling humans.<ref>[[Christopher R. Fee]], Jeffrey B.

To assert a strict [[monotheism]] and the Islamic concept of [[Tauhid]], all affinities between the jinn and God were denied, thus jinn were placed parallel to humans, also subject to God's judgment and afterlife. They are also mentioned in collections of [[Kutub al-Sittah|canonical hadiths]]. One hadith divides them into three groups, with one type flying through the air; another that are snakes and dogs; and a third that moves from place to place like human.<ref name="Hughes-1885-134-6">{{cite book |last1=Hughes |first1=Thomas Patrick |title=Dictionary of Islam: Being a Cyclopædia of the Doctrines, Rites, Ceremonies . |date=1885 |publisher=W.H.Allen |location=London, UK |pages=134–6 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDtbAAAAQAAJ&q=jinn+named+tir+who+causes+calamities&pg=PA135 |access-date=4 October 2019 |chapter=Genii}}</ref>

Belief in jinn is not included among the six articles of [[Iman (concept)#The Six Axioms of Faith|Islamic faith]], as belief in angels is, however at least many Muslim scholars believe it essential to the Islamic faith.<ref name="world">{{cite book |last1=Ashqar |first1=ʻUmar Sulaymān |title=The World of the Jinn and Devils |date=1998 |publisher=Islamic Books. |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w38mJhd9jvgC&q=jinn+in+the+quran |access-date=13 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=cook-2000-46/>
In Quranic interpretation, the term ''jinn'' can be used in two different ways:

*As invisible entities, who roamed the earth before Adam, created by God out of a "smokeless fire" ([[Arabic]]: <big>مَارِجٍ مِن نَّار,</big> ''mārijin min nār'') noted in [[Surah]] [[Ar-Rahman]] in the [[Quran|Qur'an]]. They are believed to resemble humans in that they eat and drink, have children and die, are subject to judgment, so will either be sent to heaven or hell according to their deeds,<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 18</ref> but they were much faster and stronger than humans.<ref name="ReferenceC">John Andrew Morrow ''Islamic Images and Ideas: Essays on Sacred Symbolism'' McFarland, 27 November 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-476-61288-1}} page 73</ref> This jinn are distinct from an angelic tribe called ''Al-jinn'', named after ''[[Jannah]]'' (''the Gardens''), heavenly creatures created out of the fires of ''samūm'' ([[Arabic]]: <big>سَمُوم, "</big>poisonous fire<big>"</big>) noted in [[Surah]] [[Al-Waqi'a|Al-Waqi'ah]] in the [[Quran|Qur'an]], in contrast to the genus of jinn created out of mixture of fire, who waged war against the genus of jinn and regarded as able to sin, unlike their light created counterpart.<ref>Stephen J.

Related to common traditions, the angels were created on Wednesday, the jinn on Thursday and humans on Friday, but not the very next day, rather more than 1000 years later, respectively.<ref name="ReferenceE">Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 43 (German)</ref> The community of the jinn race were like those of humans, but then corruption and injustice among them increased and all warnings sent by God were ignored. Consequently, God sent his angels to battle the infidel jinn. Just a few survived, and were ousted to far islands or to the [[Mount Qaf|mountains]].

==Jinn belief==

Although the Quran reduced the status of jinn from that of tutelary deities to merely spirits, placed parallel to humans, subject to God's judgment and the process of life, death and afterlife, they were not consequently equated with demons.<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 52</ref> When Islam spread outside of Arabia, belief in the jinn was assimilated with local belief about [[spirit]]s and [[deity|deities]] from Iran, Africa, Turkey and India.<ref>Juan Eduardo Campo Encyclopedia of Islam Infobase Publishing 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-438-12696-8}} page 402</ref>

Early [[Persian language|Persian]] translations of the Quran identified the jinn either with [[peri]]s or [[Dev (mythology)|divs]]<ref name="Hughes-1885-134-6"/> depending on their moral behavior. However, such identifications of jinn with spirits of another culture are not universal. Some of the pre-Islamic spirits remained. Peris and divs are frequently attested as distinct from jinn among Muslim lore,<ref name="ReferenceA519">Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 519 (German)</ref> but since both div as well as jinn are associated with demonic and the ability to transform themselves, they overlap sometimes.<ref>Girls' Dormitory: Women's Islam and Iranian Horror PEDRAM PARTOVI First published: 03 December 2009</ref>

Jinn can not enter a person whenever the jinn wants, rather the victim must be predisposed for possession in a state of ''dha'iyfah'' ([[Arabic]]: <big>ضَعِيفَة</big>, "weakness"). Feelings of insecurity, mental instability, unhappy love and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] (being "tired from the soul") are forms of ''dha'iyfah''.<ref>GINGRICH, ANDRE. “SPIRITS OF THE BORDER: SOME REMARKS ON THE CONNOTATION OF JINN IN NORTH-WESTERN YEMEN.” Quaderni Di Studi Arabi, vol. 13, 1995, pp. 199–212.

In [[Artas, Bethlehem|Artas]] (Bethlemhem) oral beliefs, the jinn form societies beneath the ground. Envying humans, they frequently ascend to the surface, causing sickness to children, snatching food and taking revenge when humans mistreat them. Some jinn are nevertheless benevolent towards humans, teaching humans a moral lesson.<ref>Celia E.

In [[Sindh]] the concept of the jinni was introduced when Islam became acceptable and "Jinn" has become a common part of local folklore, also including stories of both male jinn called "''jinn''" and female jinn called "''Jiniri''". Folk stories of female jinn include stories such as the ''Jejhal Jiniri''. Although, due to the cultural influence, the concept of jinn may vary, all share some common features. The jinn are believed to live in societies resembling those of humans, practicing religion (including Islam, Christianity and Judaism), having emotions, needing to eat and drink, and can procreate and raise families. Additionally, they fear iron, generally appear in desolate or abandoned places, and are stronger and faster than humans.<ref name="Hughes-1885-134-6"/> Since the jinn share the earth with humans, Muslims are often cautious not to accidentally hurt an innocent jinn by uttering "destur" (permission), before sprinkling hot water.<ref name="Hughes-1885-134-6"/><ref>MacDonald, D.B., Massé, H., Boratav, P.N., Nizami, K.A. and Voorhoeve, P., “Ḏj̲inn”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P.

The composition and existence of jinn is the subject of various debates during the [[Middle Age]]s. According to [[Al-Shafi’i]] (founder of [[Shafi‘i]] [[Madhhab|schools]]), the invisibility of jinn is so certain that anyone who thinks they have seen one is ineligible to give legal testimony—unless they are a Prophet.<ref name="Protection-1"/> According to [[Ashari]], the existence of jinn can not be proven, because arguments concerning the existence of jinn are beyond human comprehension. Adepts of [[Ashʿari theology]] explained jinn are invisible to humans, because they lack the appropriate sense organs to envision them.<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 22</ref> Sceptics argued, doubting the existence of jinn, if jinn exist, their bodies must either be ethereal or made of solid material; if they were composed of the former, they would not able to do hard work, like carrying heavy stones. If they were composed of the latter, they would be visible to any human with functional eyes.<ref name="ReferenceF">Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p.33 (German)</ref> Therefore, sceptics refused to believe in a literal reading on jinn in Islamic sacred texts, preferring to view them as "unruly men" or metaphorical.<ref name="Hughes-1885-134-6"/> On the other hand, advocates of belief in jinn assert that God's creation can exceed the human mind; thus, jinn are beyond human understanding. Since they are mentioned in Islamic texts, scholars such as [[Ibn Taimiyya]] and [[Ibn Hazm]] prohibit the denial of jinn. They also refer to spirits and demons among the Christians, Zoroastrians and Jews to "prove" their existence.<ref name="ReferenceF"/> Ibn Taymiyya believed the jinn to be generally "ignorant, untruthful, oppressive and treacherous". He held that the jinn account for much of the "magic" that is perceived by humans, cooperating with magicians to lift items in the air, delivering hidden truths to fortune tellers, and mimicking the voices of deceased humans during seances.<ref name="taym">[[Ibn Taymiyyah]], ''al-Furqān bayna awliyā’ al-Raḥmān wa-awliyā’ al-Shayṭān'' ("Essay on the Jinn"), translated by Abu Ameenah Bilal Phillips</ref>

Other critics, such as [[Jahiz]] and [[Mas'udi]], related sightings of jinn to psychological causes. According to Mas'udi, the jinn as described by traditional scholars, are not [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] false, but improbable. Jahiz states in his work [[Kitab al-Hayawan]] that loneliness induces humans to mind-games and wishful thinking, causing ''[[Waswas|waswās]]'' ([[Arabic]]: <big>وَسْوَاس</big>, "devilish whisperings in the mind", traditionally thought to be caused by [[Satan]]). If he is afraid, he may see things that are not real. These alleged appearances are told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems, and with children of the next generation growing up with such stories, when they are afraid or lonely, they remember these stories, encouraging their imaginations and causing another alleged sighting of jinn. However, Jahiz is less critical about jinn and demons than Mas'udi, stating human fantasy at least encourage people to imagine such creatures.<ref>Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p.37 (German)</ref> The ''Futūḥāt al-Makkiyyah'', attributed to the famous Sufi Shaikh [[Ibn Arabi]], reconciles a literal existence of jinn with the imaginal, describing the appearance of ''jinn'' as a reflection of the observer and the place they are found. They differ from the angels, which due to their closeness to heaven reflect the spheres of the divine, mainly in their distance to the earth and the heavens, stating: "Only this much is different: The spirits of the jinn are lower spirits, while the spirits of angels are heavenly spirits".<ref>"http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articles/futuhat_ch009.html</ref> The jinn share, due to their [[Barzakh|intermediary abode]] both angelic and human traits. Because jinn are closer to the material realm, it would be easier for human to contact a jinn, than an angel.<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 50</ref>

===Modern era===
[[Ahmadi]] interpret jinn not as supernatural beings, but as powerful men whose influence is felt even though they keep their distance from the common people. According to [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], references to jinn could also mean microorganisms such as [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es.<ref>{{cite book |author=Simon Ross Valentine |year=2008 |title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jama'at: History, Belief, Practice |publisher=Columbia University Press |pages=142–143 |isbn=978-0-231-70094-8}}</ref> Others try to [[Relationship between religion and science|reconcile]] the traditional perspective on jinn, with modern sciences. [[Fethullah Gülen]], leader of [[Gülen movement|Hizmet movement]], had put forward the idea, that jinn may be the cause of [[schizophrenia]] and [[cancer]] and that the Quranic references to jinn on "smokeless fire" could for that matter mean "energy".<ref>{{cite news|title=Jinn and Human Beings|url=https://fgulen.com/en/fethullah-gulens-works/essentials-of-the-islamic-faith/jinn-and-human-beings|access-date=8 July 2020|date=14 September 2001}}</ref> Others, while not accepting connections between illness and jinn, believe in their existence, due to their occurrences in the Quran.<ref>Alireza Doostdar ''The Iranian Metaphysicals: Explorations in Science, Islam, and the Uncanny'' {{ISBN|978-1-400-88978-5}} Princeton University Press 2018 page 54</ref> Many [[Islamic Modernism|Modernists]] tend to reject the belief in jinn as a superstition that holds Islamic society back.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} References to ''jinn'' in the Quran are interpreted in their ambiguous meaning of something invisible, and might be forces or simply angels.<ref>Fr.

Contemporary [[Salafi]] tenets of Islam reject modern interpretations of jinn and adhere to [[Bi-la kaifa|literalism]], arguing the threat of jinn and their ability to possess humans can be proven by ''[[Quran and Sunnah]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://islamqa.info/en/1819 | title=Jinn Entering Human Bodies - Islam Question & Answer}}</ref> However, many Salafis differ from their understanding of jinn from earlier accounts. Fatwas issued by Salafi scholars often repeatedly refer to a selection of Quran verses and hadith quotes, without reference to certain traditions and individual experience. Some argue that many traditions and beliefs among Muslims are excluded from Salafi theological discourse and downplays embedded Muslim beliefs as local lore, such as symptoms of jinn possession. The opinions of the prominent Saudi Muslim lecturer [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid]], an important scholar in Salafism and founder of [[IslamQA]], are repeated over several online sources, and is also cited by IslamOnline and Islamicity.com for information about jinn, devils and angels. Similar Islamawareness.net and IslamOnline both feature the article about jinn written by Fethullah Gulen, using a similar approach to interpret the spiritual world.<ref>Rothenberg, Celia E.

AB  - The point of departure for this article is a story about jinns taking revenge upon people who have abandoned earlier religious practices. It is a powerful account of their attempt to free themselves from a past viewed as inhabited by evil forces and about the encounter between contemporary Salafi reformism and a presumed disappearing religious universe. It serves to prove how a novel version of Islam has superseded former practices; delegitimized and categorized as belonging to the past. The story is, however, also an important source and an interesting entry-point to examine the continued relevance of past practices within processes of reform. Analyzing the story about the jinns and the trajectory of Salafi reform in Bale, this contribution demonstrates how the past remains intersected with present reformism, and how both former practices and novel impetuses are reconfigured through this process. The article pays attention to the dialectics of negotiations inherent to processes of reform and points to the manner in which the involvement of a range of different actors produces idiosyncratic results. It challenges notions of contemporary Islamic reform as something linear and fixed and argues that such processes are multifaceted and open-ended.

However, despite belief in jinn being prevalent in Iran's folklore especially among the stronger believers of Islam, some phenomena such as sleep paralysis were traditionally attributed to other supernatural beings; in the case of sleep paralysis, it was [[Night hag|bakhtak (night hag)]]. But at least in some areas of Iran, an epileptic seizure was thought to be a jinn attack or jinn possession, and people would try to exorcise the jinn by citing the name of Allah and using iron blades to draw protective circles around the victim.<ref name="iranicajen">{{cite web|last= Omidsalar|first= Mahmoud|author-link= محمود امیدسالار|title= GENIE|url= http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/genie-|access-date= April 15, 2012 |date= December 15, 2000|publisher= [[دانشنامه ایرانیکا]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110429185114/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/genie-|archive-date= April 29, 2011|lang= en|url-status=live}}</ref> Telling jinn stories and supposed encounter recounts were a common pastime of people, similar to telling ghost stories in western cultures, until a couple of decades ago when these stories drastically fell out of fashion with the increasing penetration of digital entertainments and modern recording equipment which undermined their credibility.

== ''Ǧinn'' (jinn) and ''shayāṭīn'' (demons/devils) ==
Both Islamic and non-Islamic scholarship generally distinguishes between [[Angels in Islam|angels]], jinn and demons as three different types of spiritual entities in Islamic traditions.<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 21</ref><ref name="ReferenceG">Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG'', 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 47 (German)</ref> The lines between demons and jinn are often blurred. Especially in [[folklore]], jinn share many characteristics usually associated with demons, as both are held responsible for mental illness, diseases and possession. However, such traits do not appear within the Quran or canonical hadiths. The Quran emphasizes comparison between humans and jinn as ''taqalan'' (accountable ones, that means they have free-will and will be judged according to their deeds).<ref>Eichler, Paul Arno, 1889 Die Dschinn, Teufel und Engel in Koran [microform] p. 60 (German)</ref><ref name="ReferenceG"/> Since the demons are exclusively evil, they are not among ''taqalan'', thus like angels, their destiny is prescribed.<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 100</ref> The jinn share many characteristics with humans, but demons lack.<ref name="racius1"/> Folklore differentiates both types of creatures as well. [[Field research]]es in 2001-2002, among Sunni Muslims in [[Syria]], recorded many oral-tales about jinn. Tales about the Devil (''[[Iblis|Iblīs]]'') and his lesser demons (''[[shayāṭīn]]'') barely appeared, in contrast to tales about jinn, who featured frequently in everyday stories. It seems the demons are primarily associated with their role within Islamic scriptures, as abstract forces tempting Muslims into everything disapproved by society, while jinn can be encountered by humans in lonely places.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gebhard|first=Fartacek|date=2002|title=Begegnungen mit Ǧinn.

===Supernaturality===
Jinn are not supernatural in the sense of being purely spiritual and transcendent to nature; while they are believed to be invisible (or often invisible) they also eat, drink, sleep, breed with the opposite sex, with offspring that resemble their parents. Intercourse is not limited to the jinn alone, but also possible between human and jinn. However, the practice is despised (''[[makruh]]'') in [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. It is disputed whether or not such intercourse can result in offspring. They are "natural" in the [[Ancient philosophy|classical philosopical]] sense by consisting of an element, undergoing change, and being bound in time and space.<ref>Benjamin W. McCraw, Robert Arp ''Philosophical Approaches to the Devil'' Routledge 2015 {{ISBN|9781317392217}}</ref> They resemble spirits or demons in the sense of evading sensible perception, but are not of immaterial nature as ''[[Ruh|Rūḥāniyya]]'' are.<ref>Chodkiewicz, M., “Rūḥāniyya”, in: Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Edited by: P.

Jinn are assumed to be able to appear in shapes of various animals such as scorpions, cats, [[owl]]s and [[onagers]] (wild ass). Dogs are another animal often associated with jinn, especially [[Black dog (ghost)|black dogs]]. However, piebald dogs are rather identified with [[Hinn (mythology)|hinn]]. Associations between dogs and jinn prevailed in Arabic literature, but lost its meaning in Persian scriptures.<ref>Tobias Nünlis, ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 134 (German)</ref> However (except for the '''udhrut'' from [[Fortune-telling|Yemeni]] folklore) the jinn can not appear in the form of wolves. The wolf is thought of as the [[Predation|natural predator]] of the jinn, who, in contrast to the jinn by his noble character, blocks their ability to vanish.<ref>name="ReferenceA98">Robert Lebling, ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar'', 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}} page 98</ref><ref name="ReferenceE"/> 

Serpents are the animals most associated with jinn. in Islamic tradition many narratives concern a serpent who was actually a jinni.<ref>Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter, GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 116 (German)</ref> The term ''jann'' refers to both a snake and jinn. The connection between jinn and serpents are strong enough, that those who believe in jinn fear killing a serpent since a jinn might avenge the murder. Also some sources speak of killed jinn leaving a carcass similar to either a serpent or a scorpion behind. Both scorpions and serpents have been venerated in the [[ancient Near East]]. Besides serpents, other chthonic animals such as scorpions and lizards are regarded as usual forms of jinn. Further, gazelles, foxes, dogs and ostriches are associated with jinn. But these are not necessarily thought to be the embodiment of jinn, but rather their mounts i.e. mythical vehicle.<ref>Amira El Zein: ''The Evolution of the Concept of Jinn from Pre-Islam to Islam''. pp. 91–93.</ref>

==== Jinn in form of storms and shadows ====
The jinn are also related to the wind. They may appear in mists or sandstorms.<ref name="Hughes, Thomas Patrick 1885. p.136">Hughes, Thomas Patrick. ''Dictionary of Islam''. 1885. "Genii" p.136</ref> [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam]], who is held to have accompanied Muhammad during his lecture to the jinn, is said to view the jinn as shadowy ghosts with no individual structure.<ref name="ReferenceD"/> According to a narration [[Abu Hamed Mohammad ibn Mohammad Ghazali|Ghazali]] asked [[Abu al-Fadl Muhammad al Tabasi|Ṭabasī]], famous for jinn-incantations, to reveal the jinn to him. Accordingly, Tabasi showed him the jinn, seeing them like they were "a shadow on the wall". After Ghazali requested to speak to them, Ṭabasī stated, that for now he could not see more.<ref>Travis Zadeh  ''Commanding Demons and Jinn: The Sorcerer in Early Islamic Thought'' p.145</ref> Although sandstorms are believed to be caused by jinn, others, such as [[Abu Yahya Zakariya' ibn Muhammad al-Qazwini]] and Ghazali attribute them to natural causes.<ref>Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 147 (German)</ref> Otherwise sandstorms are thought to be caused by a battle between different groups of jinn.

==== Anthropomorphic manifestation ====
A common characteristic of the jinn is their lack of individuality, but they may gain individuality by materializing in human forms,<ref>Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 153 (German)</ref> such as [[Asmodeus|Sakhr]] and several jinn known from magical writings. But also in their anthropomorphic shape, they stay partly animal and are not fully human. Therefore, individual jinn are commonly depicted as monstrous and anthropomorphized creatures with body parts from different animals or human with animal traits.<ref>Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 164 (German)</ref> Commonly associated with jinn in human form are the [[Sila (mythology)|Si'lah]] and the [[Ghoul]]. However, since they stay partly animal, their bodies are depicted as fashioned out of two or more different species.<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 164</ref> Some of them may have the hands of cats, the head of birds or wings rise from their shoulders.<ref>Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 160 (German)</ref>

=== Visual Art ===
There are very few visual representations of  jinn in Islamic art. Though jinn weren’t often depicted in Islamic visual art, when they do appear, they often depict specific jinn, such as the Jinn Kings<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last=Carboni|first=Stefano|date=2013|title=The ‘Book of Surprises’ (Kitab al-Buhlan) of the Bodleian Library|journal=The La Trobe Journal|volume=91|pages=27}}</ref> or Iblis, a descendant of the jinn.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leoni|first=Francesca|title=On the Monstrous in the Islamic Visual Tradition|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2012|location=Farnham|pages=153}}</ref> Visual representations of jinn appear in manuscripts and their existence is often implied in works of architecture by the presence of apotropaic devices like serpents, which were intended to ward off evil spirits. Lastly, King Solomon is illustrated very often with jinn as the commander of an army that included them.

==== Iblis ====
Perhaps one of the most well-known jinn, [[Iblis]] was depicted in multiple visual representations like the Quran and Manuscripts of Bal‘ami’s ‘Tarjamah-i Tarikh-i Tabari.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leoni|first=Francesca|title=On the Monstrous in the Islamic Visual Tradition|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2012|location=Farnham|pages=153-154}}</ref> Iblis was a unique individual, described as both a pious Jinn, and at times an angel, before he fell from Allah’s grace when he refused to bow before the prophet Adam.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leoni|first=Francesca|title=On the Monstrous in the Islamic Visual Tradition|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2012|location=Farnham|pages=3}}</ref> In visual appearance, Iblis was depicted in On the Monstrous in the Islamic Visual Tradition as a being with a human-like body with flaming eyes, a tail, claws, and large horns on a grossly disproportionate large head.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leoni|first=Francesca|title=On the Monstrous in the Islamic Visual Tradition|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2012|location=Farnham|pages=5-6}}</ref>
[[File:Jinn_King_of_Tuesday.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jinn_King_of_Tuesday.png|thumb|350x350px|The red king of the djinns, Al-Ahmar, from the late 14th-century [[Book of Wonders]].]]

==== The Seven Jinn Kings ====
In the Kitab al-Bulhan, or the Book of Surprises compiled in the fourteenth century by Abd al-Hasan Al-Isfahani, there are illustrations of 'The Seven Jinn Kings’. In general, each ‘King of the Jinn’ was represented alongside his helpers and alongside the corresponding talismanic symbols.<ref name=":02" /> For instance, the ‘Red King of Tuesday’ was depicted in the Kitab al-Bulhan as a sinister form astride a lion. In the same illustration, he holds a severed head and a sword. This was because the ‘Red King of Tuesday’ was aligned with Mars, the planet of war.<ref name=":02" /> Alongside that, there were illustrations of the ‘Gold King’ and the ‘White King’.<ref name=":02" /> Aside from the seven ‘Kings of the Jinn’, the Kitab al-Bulhan included an illustration of Huma, or the ‘Fever’. Huma was depicted as three-headed and as embracing the room around him, in order to capture someone and bring on a fever in them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carboni|first=Stefano|date=2013|title=The ‘Book of Surprises’ (Kitab al-Buhlan) of the Bodleian Library|journal=The La Trobe Journal|volume=91|pages=28}}</ref>
[[File:Porte_citadelle_alep.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Porte_citadelle_alep.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|Ornamentation of intertwined serpents above the door of the citadel of Aleppo.]]

==== Architectural Representation ====
In addition to these representations of jinn in vicinity to kingship, there were also architectural references to jinn throughout the Islamic world. In the citadel at Aleppo, the entrance gate Bab al-Hayyat made reference to jinn in the stone relief carvings of serpents; likewise, the water gate at Ayyubid Harran housed two copper sculptures of jinn, serving as talismans to ward off both snakes and evil jinn in the form of snakes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duggan|first=Terrance|title=The Just Ruler of the Age|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary Mediterranean Studies|volume=4|pages=408}}</ref>

Alongside these depictions of the jinn found at the Aleppo Citadel, depictions of the jinn can be found in the Rūm Seljuk palace. There are a phenomenal range of creatures that can be found on the eight-pointed tiles of the Seal of Sulaymān device.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duggan|first=Terrance|title=The Just Ruler of the Age|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary Mediterranean Studies|volume=4|pages=390}}</ref> Among these were the jinn, that belonged among Solomon’s army and as Solomon claimed to have control over the jinn, so did the Rūm Seljuk sultan that claimed to be the Sulaymān of his time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Duggan|first=Terrance|title=The Just Ruler of the Age|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary Mediterranean Studies|volume=4|pages=393}}</ref> In fact, one of the most common representations of jinn are alongside or in association with King Solomon. It was thought that King Solomon had very close ties to the jinn, and even had control over many of them.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Duggan|first=Terrance|title=The Just Ruler of the Age|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary Mediterranean Studies|volume=4|pages=399}}</ref> The concept that a great and just ruler has the ability to command jinn was one that extended far past only King Solomon– it was also thought that emperors, such as Alexander the Great, could control an army of jinn in a similar way.<ref name=":1" /> Given this association, Jinn were often seen with Solomon in a princely or kingly context, such as the small, animal-like jinn sitting beside King Solomon on his throne illustrated in an illuminated manuscript of The Wonders of Creation and the Oddities of Existence by Zakariyya ibn Muhammad al-Qazwini, written in the 13th century.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berlekamp|first=Persis|title=Wonder, Image, & Cosmos in Medieval Islam|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2011|location=New Haven|pages=71}}</ref>

==== Talismanic Representation ====
The jinn had an indirect impact on Islamic art through the creation of talismans that were alleged to guard the bearer from the jinn and were enclosed in leather and included Qur’anic verses.<ref>{{Cite book|last=El-Zein|first=Amira|title=Islam, Arabs, and the Intelligent World of the Jinn|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2009|location=Syracuse|pages=80}}</ref> It was not unusual for those talismans to be inscribed with separated Arabic letters, because the separation of those letters was thought to positively affect the potency of the talisman overall.<ref>{{Cite book|last=El-Zein|first=Amira|title=Islam, Arabs, and the Intelligent World of the Jinn|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2009|location=Syracuse|pages=82}}</ref> An object that was inscribed with the word of Allah was thought to have the power to ward off evil from the person who obtained the object, though many of these objects also had astrological signs, depictions of prophets, or religious narratives.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Al-Saleh|first=Yasmine|date=2010|title=Amulets and Talismans from the Islamic World|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/tali/hd_tali.htm|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}</ref>

==In witchcraft and magical literature==

[[File:Kitab al-Bulhan --- demons.jpg|thumb|Zawba'a or Zoba'ah, the jinn-king of Friday]]

[[Witchcraft]] ([[Arabic]]: <big>سِحْر</big> ''sihr'', which is also used to mean "[[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[Wizard (paranormal)|wizardry]]") is often associated with jinns and [[Ifrit|afarit]]<ref>Ian Richard Netton ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-135-17960-1}} page 377</ref> around the Middle East. Therefore, a sorcerer may summon a jinn and force him to perform orders. Summoned jinn may be sent to the chosen victim to cause demonic possession. Such summonings were done by invocation,<ref>name="Robert Lebling">Robert Lebling ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}} page 153</ref> by aid of talismans or by satisfying the jinn, thus to make a contract.<ref>Gerda Sengers ''Women and Demons: Cultic Healing in Islamic Egypt'' BRILL 2003 {{ISBN|978-9-004-12771-5}} page 31</ref> Jinn are also regarded as assistants of [[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]]s. Soothsayers reveal information from the past and present; the jinn can be a source of this information because their lifespans exceed those of humans.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Another way to subjugate them is by inserting a needle to their skin or dress. Since jinn are afraid of iron, they are unable to remove it with their own power.<ref>http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/genie-</ref>

[[Ibn al-Nadim]], Muslim scholar of his ''Kitāb al-Fihrist'', describes a book that lists 70 Jinn led by Fuqtus ([[Arabic]]: Fuqṭus <big>فقْطس</big>), including several jinn appointed over each day of the week.<ref name="Dodge">Bayard Dodge, ed. and trans. ''The Fihrist of al-Nadim: A Tenth-Century Survey of Muslim Culture.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1970. pp. 727–8.</ref><ref name="Lebling">Robert Lebling. ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar.'' I.B. Taurus, 2010. p.38</ref> [[Bayard Dodge]], who translated al-Fihrist into English, notes that most of these names appear in the [[Testament of Solomon]].<ref name="Dodge" /> A collection of late fourteenth- or early fifteenth-century magico-medical manuscripts from [[Ocaña, Spain]] describes a different set of 72 jinn (termed "Tayaliq") again under Fuqtus (here named "Fayqayțūš" or Fiqitush), blaming them for various ailments.<ref>Celia del Moral.

Universidad de Granada, 1987. p.38 et passim</ref> According to these manuscripts, each jinni was brought before King Solomon and ordered to divulge their "corruption" and "residence" while the Jinn King Fiqitush gave Solomon a recipe for curing the ailments associated with each jinni as they confessed their transgressions.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Book of Deadly Names|last = Shadrach|first = Nineveh|publisher = Ishtar Publishing|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0978388300}}</ref>

A disseminated treatise on the [[Occultism (Islam)|occult]], written by [[Abu al-Fadl Muhammad al Tabasi|al-Ṭabasī]], called [[al-Shāmil fī al-baḥr al-kāmil|Shāmil]], deals with subjugating demons and jinn by incantations, charms and the combination of written and recited formulae and to obtain supernatural powers through their aid. Al-Ṭabasī distinguished between licit and illicit magic, the latter founded on disbelief, while the first on purity.<ref>Travis Zadeh ''Commanding Demons and Jinn: The Sorcerer in Early Islamic Thought'' Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2014 p-143-145</ref>

Seven kings of the Jinn are traditionally associated with days of the week.<ref name="Lebling2010">{{cite book|author=Robert Lebling|title=Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKL3AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT87|date=30 July 2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85773-063-3|pages=87}}</ref> They are also attested in the [[Book of Wonders]]. Although many passages are damaged, they remain in Ottoman copies.

===Ancient Mesopotamian religion===

===Judaism===
The description of jinn is almost identical with that of the [[shedim]] from [[Jewish mythology]]. As with the jinn, some of whom follow the law brought by Muhammad, some of the shedim are believed to be followers of the law of [[Moses]] and consequently good.<ref>J. W. Moore, Savary (M., Claude Etienne)|''The Koran: Commonly Called the Alcoran of Mohammed''|1853|J. W. Moore| p. 20</ref> Both are said to be invisible to human eyes but are nevertheless subject to bodily desires, like procreating and the need to eat. Some Jewish sources agree with the Islamic notion that jinn inhabited the world before humans.<ref>Carol K. Mack, Dinah Mack A Field Guide to Demons, Vampires, Fallen Angels and Other Subversive Spirits'' Skyhorse Publishing 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-628-72150-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://intothewonder.wordpress.com/2014/03/07/shedim-eldritch-beings-from-jewish-folklore/|title=Shedim: Eldritch Beings from Jewish Folklore|date=7 March 2014}}</ref> [[Asmodeus]] appears both as an individual of the jinn or shedim, as an antagonist of Solomon.<ref name="Robert Lebling"/>{{rp|120}}

===Buddhism===
As in Islam, the idea of spiritual entities converting to one's own religion can be found in [[Buddhism]]. According to lore, Buddha preached to [[Deva (Buddhism)|Deva]]s and [[Asura]], spiritual entities who, like humans, are subject to the cycle of life, and who resemble the Islamic notion of jinn, who are also [[ontologically]] placed among humans in regard to 
[[Eschatology|eschatological]] destiny.<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 165</ref><ref>Marie Musæus-Higgins ''Poya Days'' Asian Educational Services 1925 {{ISBN|978-8-120-61321-8}} page 14</ref>

===Christianity===
[[Cornelius Van Allen Van Dyck|Van Dyck]]'s Arabic translation of the Old Testament uses the alternative collective plural "jann" (Arab:الجان); translation:al-jānn) to render the Hebrew word usually translated into English as "familiar spirit" (אוב , [[Strong's Concordance|Strong]] #0178) in several places ([[Leviticus]] 19:31, 20:6, [[1 Samuel]] 28:3,7,9, [[1 Chronicles]] 10:13).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabicbible.com/arabic-bible.html|title=Arabic Bible – Arabic Bible Outreach Ministry|website=arabicbible.com}}</ref>

Some scholars evaluated whether the jinn might be compared to [[fallen angel]]s in Christian traditions. Comparable to Augustine's descriptions of fallen angels as ethereal, jinn seem to be considered as the same substance. Although the fallen angels is not absent in the Quran,<ref>Wouter J. Hanegraaff, Jeffrey Kripal ''Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism'' BRILL, 16.10.2008 {{ISBN|9789047443582}} p. 53</ref> the jinn nevertheless differ in their major characteristics from that of fallen angels: While fallen angels fell from heaven, the jinn did not, but try to climb up to it in order to receive the news of the angels. Jinn are closer to demons.<ref>Mehdi Azaiez, Gabriel Said Reynolds, Tommaso Tesei, Hamza M. Zafer The Qur'an Seminar Commentary / Le Qur'an Seminar: A Collaborative Study of 50 Qur'anic Passages / Commentaire collaboratif de 50 passages coraniques Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG {{ISBN|9783110445459}} Q 72</ref>
