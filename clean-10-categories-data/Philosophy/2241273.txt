'''Philosophy and literature''' involves the [[literature|literary]] treatment of [[philosopher]]s and [[philosophy|philosophical]] themes (the literature of philosophy), and the philosophical treatment of issues raised by literature (the philosophy of literature).

==The philosophy of literature==
Strictly speaking, the philosophy of literature is a branch of [[aesthetics]], the branch of philosophy that deals with the question, "what is [[art]]"?  Much of aesthetic philosophy has traditionally focused on the plastic arts or [[music]], however, at the expense of the verbal arts.  In fact, much traditional discussion of aesthetic philosophy seeks to establish criteria of artistic quality that are indifferent to the subject matter being depicted.  Since all literary works, almost by definition, contain notional content, aesthetic theories that rely on purely formal qualities tend to overlook literature.

The very existence of [[narrative]] raises philosophical issues.  In narrative, a creator can embody, and readers be led to imagine, [[fiction]]al characters, and even [[fantasy|fantastic]] creatures or technologies.  The ability of the human mind to imagine, and even to experience [[empathy]] with, these fictional characters is itself revealing about the nature of the human mind.  Some fiction can be thought of as a sort of a [[thought experiment]] in [[ethics]]: it describes fictional characters, their [[Motivation|motive]]s, their actions, and the consequences of their actions.  It is in this light that some philosophers have chosen various narrative forms to teach their philosophy (''see below'').

===Literature and language===
[[Plato]], for instance, believed that literary culture had a strong impact on the ethical outlook of its consumers.  In ''[[Republic (dialogue)|The Republic]]'', Plato displays a strong hostility to the contents of the culture of his period, and proposes a strong [[censorship]] of popular literature in his [[utopia]].

More recently, however, philosophers of various stripes have taken different and less hostile approaches to literature.  Since the work of the [[British Empiricists]] and [[Immanuel Kant]] in the late eighteenth century, Western philosophy has been preoccupied with a fundamental question of [[epistemology]]: the question of the relationship between [[idea]]s in the human mind and the world existing outside the mind, if in fact such a world exists.  In more recent years, these epistemological issues have turned instead to an extended discussion of [[word]]s and meaning: can [[language]] in fact bridge the barrier between minds?  This cluster of issues concerning the meaning of language and of "[[writing]]s" sometimes goes by the name of ''the [[linguistic turn]]''.

As such, techniques and tools developed for [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]] rose to greater prominence in Western philosophy of the late twentieth century.  Philosophers of various stripes paid more attention to literature than their predecessors did.  Some sought to examine the question of whether it was in fact truly possible to communicate using words, whether it was possible for an author's intended meaning to be communicated to a reader.  Others sought to use literary works as examples of contemporary [[culture]], and sought to reveal unconscious attitudes they felt present in these works for the purpose of social criticism.

===The truth of fiction===
Literary works also pose issues concerning [[truth]] and the [[philosophy of language]].  In educated opinion, at least, it is commonly reputed as true that ''[[Sherlock Holmes]] lived in London''. (see David Lewis 'Truth in Fiction', American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 15. No. 1, January 1978)  It is also considered true that ''[[Samuel Pepys]] lived in London''.  Yet Sherlock Holmes never lived anywhere at all; he is a fictional character.  Samuel Pepys, contrarily, is judged to have been a real person.  Contemporary interest in Holmes and in Pepys share strong similarities; the only reason why anyone knows either of their names is because of an abiding interest in reading about their alleged deeds and words.  These two statements would appear to belong to two different orders of truth.  Further problems arise concerning the [[truth value]] of statements about fictional worlds and characters that can be implied but are nowhere explicitly stated by the sources for our knowledge about them, such as ''Sherlock Holmes had only one head'' or ''Sherlock Holmes never travelled to the moon''.

==The literature of philosophy==

===Philosophical poems===
{{Literature}}
A number of [[poetry|poets]] have written poems on philosophical themes, and some important philosophers have expressed their philosophy in verse.  The [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] and the ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' of [[Lucretius]] are important philosophical poems. The genre of [[epic poetry]] was also used to teach philosophy. [[Vyasa]] narrated the ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' in order to teach [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Hindu philosophy]]. [[Homer]] also presented some philosophical teachings in his ''[[Odyssey]]''.

Many of the [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophers]] worked out their thought in poetical fashion. Some of the important names include:

* [[Vyasa]]
* [[Laozi]]
* [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi]]
* [[Omar Khayyám]]
* [[Al-Ma'arri]]
* [[Nizami Ganjavi]]

===Philosophical fiction===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Borges.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote philosophical fiction.]] -->
Some philosophers have undertaken to write philosophy in the form of [[fiction]], including novels and short stories (see separate article on [[philosophical fiction]]).  This is apparent early on in the literature of philosophy, where philosophers such as [[Plato]] wrote [[dialogue]]s in which fictional or fictionalized characters discuss philosophical subjects; [[Socrates]] frequently appears as a protagonist in Plato's dialogues, and the dialogues are one of the prime sources of knowledge about Socrates' teaching, though at this remove it is sometimes hard to distinguish Socrates' actual positions from Plato's own. Numerous early Christian writers, including [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Boethius]], and [[Peter Abelard]] produced dialogues; several early modern philosophers, such as [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], wrote occasionally in this genre.

Other philosophers have resorted to [[narrative]] to get their teachings across. The classical 12th century [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]], [[Ibn Tufail|Abubacer]] (Ibn Tufail), wrote a fictional [[Arabic literature|Arabic narrative]] ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]'' as a response to [[al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'', and then the 13th century [[Kalam|Islamic theologian]]-philosopher [[Ibn al-Nafis]] also wrote a fictional narrative ''Theologus Autodidactus'' as a response to Abubacer's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''. The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] often articulated his ideas in literary modes, most notably in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', a re-imagined account of the teachings of [[Zoroaster]]. [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Ayn Rand]] wrote novels in which characters served as mouthpieces for philosophical positions, and act in accordance with them in the plot. [[George Santayana]] was also a philosopher who wrote novels and poetry; the relationship between Santayana's characters and his beliefs is more complex.  The [[existentialism|existentialists]] include among their numbers important [[French language|French]] authors who used fiction to convey their philosophical views; these include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s novel ''[[Nausea (Book)|Nausea]]'' and play ''[[No Exit]]'', and [[Albert Camus]]'s  ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''. [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s entire fictional production, whose titles include ''[[The Step Not Beyond]]'', ''[[The madness of the Day]]'', and ''[[The Writing of Disaster]]'', among others, constitutes an indispensable corpus for the treatment of the relationship between philosophy and literature. So does [[Jacques Derrida]]'s ''[[The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond]]''.

A number of philosophers have had important influence on literature.  [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], largely as a result of his [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics|system of aesthetics]], is perhaps the most influential recent philosopher in the history of literature; [[Thomas Hardy]]'s later novels frequently allude to Schopenhauerian themes, particularly in ''[[Jude the Obscure]]''.  Schopenhauer also had an important influence on [[Joseph Conrad]].  Schopenhauer also had a less specific but more  widely diffused influence on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in European literature.  [[Lionel Johnson]] also refers to Schopenhauer's aesthetics in his essay ''The Cultured Faun''. [[Jacques Derrida]]'s entire oeuvre has been hugely influential for so-called continental philosophy and the understanding of the role of literature in modernity.

Other works of fiction considered to have philosophical content include:

*[[Abubacer]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]''
*[[Albert Camus]], ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Outsider]]''
*[[Joseph Conrad]], ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''
*[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], ''[[Brothers Karamazov]]''
*[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''
*[[Jostein Gaarder]], ''[[Sophie's World]]''
* [[Hermann Hesse]], ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]''
*[[James Joyce]], ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''
*[[Franz Kafka]], ''[[The Metamorphosis]]''
*[[Milan Kundera]], ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''
*[[Ibn al-Nafis]], ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]''
*[[Thomas Mann]], ''[[The Magic Mountain]]''
*[[Iris Murdoch]], ''[[The Sea, the Sea]]''
*[[Robert M. Pirsig]], ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]''
*[[Marcel Proust]], ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''
*[[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Hamlet]]''
*[[Leo Tolstoy]], ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''
*Leo Tolstoy, ''[[War and Peace]]''
*[[Sergio Troncoso]], ''[[The Nature of Truth]]''
*[[Marguerite Yourcenar]], ''[[Memoirs of Hadrian]]''

===Philosophical writing as literature===
A number of philosophers are  read for the literary merits of their works apart from their philosophical content.  The philosophy in the ''[[Meditations]]'' of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] is unoriginal [[Stoicism]], but the ''Meditations'' are still read for their literary merit and for the insight they give into the workings of the emperor's mind.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy is noted for the quality and readability of its prose, as are some of the works of the [[British Empiricism|British Empiricists]], such as [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]].  [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s style is frequently regarded as poetic artistry as well as philosophical, especially in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' and ''[[Either/Or]]''.  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s works such as ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' frequently resemble [[prose poetry]] and contain imagery and allusion instead of argument.

===Philosophers in literature===
Socrates appears in a highly fictionalized guise, as a comic figure and the object of mockery, in ''[[The Clouds]]'' by [[Aristophanes]].  In the play, Socrates appears hanging from a basket, where he delivers oracles such as:

:I'd never come up with a single thing<br> about celestial phenomena,<br>if I did not suspend my mind up high,<br>to mix my subtle thoughts with what's like them—<br>the air. If I turned my mind to lofty things,<br>but stayed there on the ground, I'd never make<br>the least discovery. For the earth, you see,<br>draws moist thoughts down by force into itself—<br>the same process takes place with water cress.

Early [[Taoist]] philosopher [[Zhuang Zhou]] expressed his ideas primarily through short literary anecdotes and fables such as "Dream of the Butterfly".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Möller|first=Hans-Georg|date=1999|title=Zhuangzi's "Dream of the Butterfly": A Daoist Interpretation|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=49|issue=4|pages=439–450|doi=10.2307/1399947|jstor=1399947|issn=0031-8221}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Philosophy Foundation - The Butterfly Dream|url=https://www.philosophy-foundation.org/enquiries/view/the-butterfly-dream|access-date=2020-07-05|website=www.philosophy-foundation.org}}</ref> The other major philosophers of the time appear as characters within these stories, allowing Zhuangzi to playfully explore their ideas and contrast them with his own, as he does with [[Laozi]], [[Liezi]], [[Hui Shi]], and many others. Most prominently in his work is the presence of [[Confucius]] and his prominent disciples, who are sometimes used to undermine popular understandings of Confucian philosophy or to reinforce Zhuangzi's own understanding of how one lives in accordance with the Dao.

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] is perhaps the twentieth century's preeminent author of philosophical fiction.  He wrote a short story in which the philosopher [[Averroes]] is the chief protagonist, ''[[Averroes's Search]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dapía|first=Silvia G.|date=1999|title=The Myth of the Framework in Borges's "Averroes' Search"|journal=Variaciones Borges|issue=7|pages=147–165|jstor=24879540|issn=1396-0482}}</ref>  Many plot points in his stories paraphrase the thought of  philosophers, including [[George Berkeley]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], and [[Bertrand Russell]]; he also attributes various opinions to figures including [[George Dalgarno]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Characteristica universalis {{!}} Borges Center|url=https://www.borges.pitt.edu/i/characteristica-universalis|access-date=2020-07-05|website=www.borges.pitt.edu}}</ref>

A key plot point in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' turns on the discovery of a mysterious book that turns out to contain a lost manuscript by [[Aristotle]].  Eco's later novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum (book)|Foucault's Pendulum]]'' became the forerunner of a run of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s or [[detective fiction]] that toss around learned allusions and the names of historical thinkers; more recent examples include [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and ''[[The Rule of Four (book)|The Rule of Four]]'' by [[Ian Caldwell]] and [[Dustin Thomason]].

Also, [[Philip K. Dick]], who has often been compared to Borges, raises a significant number of philosophical issues in his novels, everything from the problem of [[solipsism]] to many questions of [[perception]] and [[reality]].

===Fictional philosophers===
Jorge Luis Borges introduces many philosophical themes, and a number of fictional philosophers, in his [[short story|short stories]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Agassi|first=J.|date=1970|title=Philosophy as Literature: The Case of Borges|journal=Mind|volume=79|issue=314|pages=287–294|doi=10.1093/mind/LXXIX.314.287|jstor=2252659|issn=0026-4423}}</ref>  A fictional philosophical movement is a part of the premise of his story ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', and the unnamed narrator of his story ''[[The Library of Babel]]'' could also be called a fictional philosopher.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Borges, The Universe And The Infinite Library|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2010/07/23/128716508/the-universe-and-the-infinite-library|access-date=2020-07-05|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref>  A fictional [[theology|theologian]] is the subject of his story ''[[Three Versions of Judas]]''.

Fictional philosophers occasionally occur throughout the works of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Ray Bradbury]].  Heinlein's ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' contains long passages that could be considered as successors to the fictionalized philosophical dialogues of the ancient world, set within the plot.<ref>{{Citation|last=Ross|first=Ethan|title=The Intellectual Martian Society of "Stranger in a Strange Land" by Robert Heinlein|date=2019-10-20|url=https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/enr3470/chapter/the-intellectual-martian-society-of-stranger-in-a-strange-land-by-robert-heinlein/|work=Religion and Environmental Values in America|publisher=The Ohio State University|language=en|access-date=2020-07-05}}</ref>
