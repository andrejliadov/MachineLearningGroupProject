The '''Pope Benedict XVI Philosophical-Theological University''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Philosophisch-Theologische Hochschule Benedikt XVI. Heiligenkruez''), colloquially referred to as '''Hochschule Heiligenkreuz''', is a private, [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[pontifical university]] located in [[Heiligenkreuz, Lower Austria|Heiligenkreuz]], [[Austria]]. Founded in 1802 by the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monks of [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]] as a seminary, for much of the 19th century, the college remained very small, with less than 20 seminarians and several Cistercian instructors. During the late 19th century and 20th-century, the college's profile grew, and more students arrived, made up of Cistercians, as well as diocesan and religious seminarians. In 1978, it earned [[university status]], and [[Pope Benedict XVI]] named it a [[pontifical university]] upon his visit in 2007.

The university's campus is located in a group of buildings located at Heiligenkruez Abbey, sharing space with the monastery and a seminary. As of 2016, the university enrolled 295 students, including 43 Cistercians, 40 from other [[religious institute]]s, and 75 diocesan seminarians, the rest being lay men and women. It is the only university administered by the Cistercian Order, and the only theological college in Austria, and the largest educational institution for priests and religious in the German-speaking world.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
Theological education has been present at Heiligenkreuz Abbey since the [[Middle Ages]]. Since 1802, a state-accredited and Church-recognized institution of higher education has operated, originally organized as a seminary to train Cistercian priests from the [[Zwettl Abbey|Zwettl]], Heiligenkreuz, Neukloster, and [[Lilienfeld Abbey|Lilienfeld]] abbeys, all located in [[Lower Austria]].

For much of the 19th century, the college remained small, with enrollment never more than 20. In the late 19th century, thanks to both political as well as economic changes, the college grew in prestige and influence. Instead of having to teach from state-approved curriculum, the Cistercian professors enjoyed more intellectual independence. In addition, the professors would now receive degrees from universities in [[Vienna]], Austria, [[Tübingen]], [[Germany]], and [[Rome]]. Despite these changes, enrollment remained low.

=== 20th-century growth ===
[[File:HlkzProfs1930.jpg|thumb|University faculty in 1930]]
After [[Vatican II]], enrollment grew rapidly after the college, then known by its Latin name, Institutum Theologicum, came to the attention of the [[Bishops of Regensburg|Bishop of Regensburg]], [[Rudolf Graber]]. He wanted his seminarians to experience life in a religious community before coming diocesan priests, so he sent them to Heiligenkreuz. Soon, other bishops and leaders of other religious orders began sending their own seminarians to be educated there. By 1976, as the college was offering graduate degrees and opening enrollment to lay students, it was granted [[university status]] by the Austrian government.

=== Recent history ===
[[File:Hochschule beim Papst - 17.5.2002.jpg|thumb|University faculty and students meeting with [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2002.]]
In May 2002, professors and students made a trip to Rome, where they were received in a papal audience by [[Pope John Paul II]].

In 2007, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] visited the university. On 28 January, the feast day of [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]], Benedict raised the college to the rank of [[pontifical university]]. He praised the university for its combination of theology and spirituality and described it as a "prominent place of study."

== Campus ==
[[File:HSB16 Luftbesser.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the campus, with university buildings in the forefront and Heiligenkreuz Abbey in the background.]]
The university is located in [[Heiligenkreuz, Lower Austria|Heiligenkreuz]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Austria]], in a complex of buildings located on the [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]] property.

== Administration and organization ==
The Grand Chancellor of the university is the abbot of Heiligenkreuz Abbey. The current abbot and chancellor is [[Maximillian Heim]], OCist, since 2011. The Rector is the de facto leader of university, with more day-to-day involvement in administration. The current rector  is [[Karl Wallner]], OCist. The Vice Rector, as well as much of the teaching body, are Cistercians from Heiligenkreuz Abbey.

The university is organized into twelve 'institutes' or departments.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hochschule-heiligenkreuz.at/institute/leitung/|title=Leitung - Phil.-Theol.
