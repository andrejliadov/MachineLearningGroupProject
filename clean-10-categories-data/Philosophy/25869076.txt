A '''philosophy of life''' is any general attitude towards, or philosophical view of, the [[meaning of life]] or of the way life should be lived.<ref>{{unbulleted list|{{cite dictionary|title=Philosophy of life|dictionary=Collins English Dictionary|year=2019|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers}}|{{cite dictionary|title=Philosophy of life|dictionary=Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|access-date=September 29, 2020|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/philosophy%20of%20life }}}}</ref> The term is generally used in an informal sense, meaning a personal philosophy whose focus is resolving basic existential questions about the [[human condition]] rather than an academic philosophical endeavour.<ref>Timothy Fetler, ''Philosophy and Philosophy of Religion Charts'', Sun Press, 1968.</ref>

==The human situation==
{{prose|section|date=April 2013}}

{{Main|Human situation}}
The human situation appears to be a struggle between what ''is'' (existence) and what ''ought'' (essence) to be.

* [[Existential predicament]]&nbsp;– [[Finitude]], [[Social alienation|Alienation]], [[Anxiety]], [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]], [[Ambivalence]], [[Thrownness]]

==Main answers to the existential question==
There are at least three prevailing theories on how to respond to the existential question.

===Denial of essence===
* [[Nihilism]], denial of meaning

===Denial of existence===
* [[Essentialism]]

===Affirmation of life===
* [[Secular humanism]]
* [[Religion]]

==Religion as an attempt to overcome the existential predicament==
There are two basic forms of [[existentialism]]:

===Religious existentialism===
{{Main|Christian existentialism|Jewish existentialism }}

Religious existentialism is best exemplified by [[St. Augustine]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Paul Tillich]], and the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]. Religious existentialism holds that there are two levels of reality, essence, which is the ground of [[being]], and existence. Religion is the ultimate concern in this view.

===Atheistic existentialism===
{{Main|Atheistic existentialism}}

Atheistic existentialism is best exemplified by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. It holds that there is one level of reality, existence. In this view, each person constructs his own unique and temporary essence.
