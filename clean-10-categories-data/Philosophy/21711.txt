The cast included [[Megumi Ogata]] as [[Shinji Ikari]], [[Kotono Mitsuishi]] as [[Misato Katsuragi]], [[Megumi Hayashibara]] as [[Rei Ayanami]], and [[Yūko Miyamura]] as [[Asuka Langley Soryu]]. [[Music of Neon Genesis Evangelion|Music for the series]] was composed by [[Shirō Sagisu]].

''Evangelion'' is set fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm, particularly in the futuristic fortified city of Tokyo-3.

== Plot ==
{{See also|List of Neon Genesis Evangelion episodes}}
In 2015, fifteen years after a global cataclysm known as the Second Impact, teenager [[Shinji Ikari]] is summoned to the futuristic city of Tokyo-3 by his estranged father [[Gendo Ikari]], director of the special paramilitary force Nerv. Shinji witnesses [[United Nations]] forces battling an Angel, one of a race of giant monstrous beings whose awakening was foretold by the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Because of the Angels' near-impenetrable force-fields, Nerv's giant Evangelion bio-machines, synchronized to the nervous systems of their pilots and possessing their own force-fields, are the only weapons capable of keeping the Angels from annihilating humanity. Nerv officer [[Misato Katsuragi]] escorts Shinji into the Nerv complex beneath the city, where his father pressures him into piloting the Evangelion Unit-01 against the Angel. Without training, Shinji is quickly overwhelmed in the battle, causing the Evangelion to go berserk and savagely kill the Angel on its own.

Following hospitalization, Shinji moves in with Misato and settles into life in Tokyo-3. In his second battle, Shinji destroys an Angel but runs away afterwards, distraught. Misato confronts Shinji and he decides to remain a pilot. The Nerv crew and Shinji must then battle and defeat the remaining 14 Angels to prevent the Third Impact, a global cataclysm that would destroy the world. Evangelion Unit-00 is repaired shortly afterwards. Shinji tries to befriend its pilot, the mysterious, socially isolated teenage girl [[Rei Ayanami]]. With Rei's help, Shinji defeats another Angel. They are then joined by the pilot of Evangelion Unit-02, the multitalented, but insufferable teenager [[Asuka Langley Sōryu]], who is German-Japanese-American. Together, the three of them manage to defeat several Angels. As Shinji adjusts to his new role as a pilot, he gradually becomes more confident and self-assured. Asuka moves in with Shinji, and they begin to develop confusing feelings for one another, kissing at her provocation.

After being absorbed by an Angel, Shinji breaks free thanks to the Eva acting on its own. He is later forced to fight an infected Evangelion Unit-03 and watches its pilot, his friend and classmate [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Toji Suzuhara|Toji Suzuhara]], incapacitated and presumably permanently disabled. Asuka loses her self-confidence following a defeat and spirals into depression. This is worsened by her next fight, against an [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Arael|Angel]] which attacks her mind and forces her to relive her worst fears and childhood trauma, resulting in a mental breakdown. In the next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming she is "the third Rei". Misato forces scientist [[Ritsuko Akagi]] to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv, the Evangelion boneyard and the dummy plug system which operates using clones of Rei, who was herself created with the DNA of Shinji's mother, [[Yui Ikari]]. This succession of events leaves Shinji emotionally scarred and alienated from the rest of the characters. [[Kaworu Nagisa]] replaces the catatonic Asuka as pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially befriends Shinji and gains his trust, is in truth the final foretold Angel, Tabris. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die if humanity is to survive and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji hesitates but eventually kills Kaworu, causing Shinji to be overridden with guilt.

After the final Angel is defeated, Seele, the mysterious cabal overseeing the events of the series, triggers the "Human Instrumentality Project", a forced evolution of humanity in which the souls of all mankind are merged for benevolent purposes, believing that if unified, humanity could finally overcome the loneliness and alienation that has eternally plagued mankind. Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany that he needs others to thrive, enabling him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him and reunite with the others, who congratulate him.

After witnessing his mother Yui Ikari's death as a child, Shinji was abandoned by his father, Gendo Ikari. He is emotionally hypersensitive and sometimes does as expected out of fear of rejection, but he has often rebelled and refused to pilot the Eva because of the extremely excruciating harm that has been done to him or to his friends. Throughout the series, he says to himself "I mustn't run away" as a means of encouraging himself to face the threats of the day, and this sometimes actually gives him bravery in battle, but he has a lingering habit of withdrawing in response to traumatic events. Anno has described Shinji as a boy who "shrinks from human contact" and has "convinced himself that he is a completely unnecessary person".<ref name="What-were-we-making">{{Cite book |last=Sadamoto |first=Yoshiyuki |author-link=Yoshiyuki Sadamoto |others=Essay by Hideaki Anno; translated by Mari Morimoto, English adaptation by Fred Burke |title=Neon Genesis Evangelion, Vol. 1 |date=December 1998 |orig-year=1995 |publisher=VIZ Media LLC |location=San Francisco |isbn=1-56931-294-X |pages=170–171 |chapter=What were we trying to make here?}}</ref>

However, after Shinji and Rei successfully defeat the Angel Ramiel, she takes a friendly liking to him. Towards the end of the series, it is revealed that she is one of many clones, whose use is to replace the currently existing Rei if she is killed.

[[Asuka Langley Soryu]] is a child prodigy who pilots Evangelion Unit-02 and possesses a fiery temper and an overabundance of pride and self-confidence, which often gets her in trouble and difficulty, especially during battles. As a little girl, Asuka discovered the body of her mother shortly after she committed suicide, leading the child to repress her emotions and vow never to cry.

The teenaged Evangelion pilots are ordered into battle by the steely Gendo Ikari, Shinji's father and the commander of Nerv. He abandoned Shinji and recalled him only to serve as an Evangelion pilot. Gendo salvaged the remains of his dead wife's body to create Rei, whom he viewed as a mere tool at his disposal to defeat the Angels and enact Instrumentality. Similar to Shinji, he is somewhat asocial and is afraid of being insulted by others and often runs away from such, often committing immoralities in the process. This fear is also what drove him to abandon Shinji. He is depicted as relentless in his drive to win, a man who "takes drastic and extreme measures, by fair means or foul, or by hook or by crook, in order to accomplish his own purpose."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Anime Expo '96 interview |author=Graham, Miyako |magazine=Protoculture Addicts |date=November 1996 |issue=43 |pages=40–41}}</ref> According to Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, the characters of Gendo and Fuyutsuki are based on Ed Straker and Alec Freeman of the television series ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]''.<ref name="Mond" /> Sadamoto designed the visual appearance of the characters so that their personalities "could be understood more or less at a glance".{{sfn|Lamarre|2009|p=204}} The distinctive aesthetic appeal of the female lead characters' designs contributed to the high sales of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' merchandise. The design of Rei, in particular, became so popular that the media referred to the character as "Premium Girl" due to the high sales of books with Rei on the cover.{{sfn|Fujie|Foster|2004|p=39}}

== Production ==
Director Hideaki Anno fell into a deep depression following completion of work on ''[[Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water]]''{{sfn|Lamarre|2009|p=180}} and the 1992 failure of the ''[[Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise]]'' sequel project.{{sfn|Takeda|2002|pp=155–158}} According to [[Yasuhiro Takeda]], Anno agreed to a collaboration between [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] and Gainax while drinking with King representative Toshimichi Ōtsuki;{{sfn|Takeda|2002|p=164}} King Records guaranteed Anno a time slot for "something, anything".<ref>{{cite web |title=Personal Biography |url=http://khara.co.jp/hideakianno/personal-biography.html |accessdate=September 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517025456/http://www.khara.co.jp/hideakianno/personal-biography.html |archive-date=May 17, 2015}}</ref> Anno began the development of the new series in 1993 around the notion of not running away, which had been the underlying theme of ''Aoki Uru'', an earlier Anno project that had failed to move into production.{{sfn|Takeda|2002|pp=15, 165-166}} Early into the production, Anno stated his intent to have ''Evangelion'' increase the number of [[otaku]] (anime fans) by attracting interest in the medium.<ref name=Woznicki>{{cite magazine |author=Krystian Woznicki |title=Towards a cartography of Japanese anime – Anno Hideaki's Evangelion Interview with Azuma Hiroki |magazine=BLIMP Filmmagazine |publisher=[[Tokuma Shoten]] |date=September 1991}}</ref> According to him, the plot of the series reflects his four-year depression.<ref name="What-were-we-making" /><ref>{{cite book |author=Carl Gustav Horn |chapter=The mast or the face – Neon Genesis Evangelion |title=Animerica |volume=5 |issue=2 |editor=Viz Media |page=70 |year=1997}}</ref> In the early design phase of the ''Evangelion'' project, several formats were considered, including a film, a television series and an [[original video animation]] (OVA) series.

[[File:Studio GAINAX.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Gainax studio in [[Koganei]], [[Tokyo]]]]
''Evangelion'' borrowed certain scenarios and the use of introspection as a narrative device from a previous Anno project entitled ''[[Gunbuster]]''.{{sfn|Fontana|Tarò|2007|p=66}} He incorporated the narrative structure of ''Nadia'' and multiple frames of reference, leaving the story open to interpretation.{{sfn|Lamarre|2009|p=165}} Over the course of the writing process, elements of the ''Evangelion'' storyline evolved from the original concept.

[[Hiroki Azuma (critic)|Azuma Hiroki]] has said that the original ''Evangelion'' story was "too close to reality" from Anno's point of view. Basically, Anno thought that the original scenario was not suitable for broadcasting, and he feared censorship. However, he also criticized Aum Shinrikyo, because "they lost any contact with reality". For this reason, Azuma stated that ''Evangelion'' "is an intrinsic critique of Aum".<ref name=Woznicki /> The final version of the story reflects inspiration drawn from numerous other anime and fictional works.{{sfn|Fujie|Foster|2004|p=9}} Chief among these are ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'',{{sfn|Napier|2002|p=424}} ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'',<ref>{{cite book |author=Takashi Murakami |title=Little Boy: The Arts Of Japan's Exploding Subculture |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2005 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/littleboyartsofj0000unse/page/70 70, 77] |isbn=978-0-300-10285-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/littleboyartsofj0000unse/page/70}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Timothy N.

The development of the ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' series ran close to deadlines throughout its production run.

The number of Angels was reduced to 17 instead of the original 28, and the writers changed the story's ending, which had originally described the failure of the Human Instrumentality Project after an Angel attack from the moon.<ref name=Collection /> Not only did the series suffer from scheduling issues, but according to Anno, despite Gainax being the lead studio for the series, the company itself had inadequate materials and staff for the full production of the series. Only three staff members from Gainax were working on the series at any given time, and the majority of the series' production was outsourced to [[Tatsunoko Production]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2019-12-30/hideaki-anno-details-his-falling-out-with-gainax/.154892 |title=Hideaki Anno Details His Falling Out With Gainax |date=December 30, 2019 |first=Kim |last=Morrissy |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=December 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191230223153/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2019-12-30/hideaki-anno-details-his-falling-out-with-gainax/.154892|archive-date= December 30, 2019|url-status= live}}</ref>

In short, a mother is someone who simultaneously protects you unconditionally and restrains you—which you could call the bad part. Additionally, it's not the case that a mother is in a good mood every day. For example, when you cried, if she was in a good mood, she might have said something like, "Be a good child, a good child; you mustn't cry," but if she were irritable and in a bad mood, she might even shout, isn't that right? From a child's perspective, you can't see the two as the same person. Therefore both a good mother and a bad mother exist, and when you recognize that they are contained within a single personality, you're able to see for the first time what's known as a stranger.
