'''Islamic philosophy''' is a development in [[philosophy]] that is characterised by coming from an [[Islam|Islamic]] tradition. Two terms traditionally used in the Islamic world are sometimes translated as philosophy—falsafa (literally: "philosophy"), which refers to philosophy as well as [[logic]], [[mathematics]], and [[physics]];<ref name="Hassan-2013">{{cite web|last1=Hassan|first1=Hassan|title=Don't Blame It on al-Ghazali|url=https://en.qantara.de/content/the-decline-of-islamic-scientific-thought-dont-blame-it-on-al-ghazali|website=qantara.de|access-date=5 June 2017|date=2013}}</ref> and Kalam (literally "speech"), which refers to a rationalist form of Islamic theology.

Early Islamic philosophy began with al-Kindi in the 2nd century of the Islamic calendar (early  9th century CE) and ended with Averroes (Ibn Rushd) in the 6th century AH (late  12th century CE), broadly coinciding with the period known as the Golden Age of Islam. The death of Averroes effectively marked the end of a particular discipline of Islamic philosophy usually called the Peripatetic Islamic school, and philosophical activity declined significantly in Western Islamic countries such as Islamic Iberia and North Africa.

Islamic philosophy persisted for much longer in Muslim Eastern countries, in particular Safavid Persia, Ottoman and Mughal Empires, where several schools of philosophy continued to flourish: Avicennism, Averroism, Illuminationist philosophy, Mystical philosophy, Transcendent theosophy, and Isfahan philosophy. Ibn Khaldun, in his Muqaddimah, made important contributions to the philosophy of history. Interest in Islamic philosophy revived during the Nahda ("Awakening") movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and continues to the present day.

Islamic philosophy had a major impact in Christian Europe, where translation of Arabic philosophical texts into Latin "led to the transformation of almost all philosophical disciplines in the medieval Latin world", with a particularly strong influence of Muslim philosophers being felt in natural philosophy, psychology and metaphysics.<ref name="standford">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West|year=2014|author=Dag Nikolaus Hasse|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-influence/|access-date=2017-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020001417/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-influence/#|archive-date=2017-10-20|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Introduction ==
Islamic philosophy refers to philosophy produced in an Islamic society.

Islamic philosophy is a generic term that can be defined and used in different ways. In its broadest sense it means the world view of Islam, as derived from the Islamic texts concerning the creation of the universe and the will of the Creator. In another sense it refers to any of the schools of thought that flourished under the Islamic empire or in the shadow of the Arab-Islamic culture and Islamic civilization. In its narrowest sense it is a translation of ''Falsafa'', meaning those particular schools of thought that most reflect the influence of Greek systems of philosophy such as [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Aristotelianism]].

It is not necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor exclusively produced by [[Muslim]]s.<ref>Oliver Leaman, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</ref> Nor do all schools of thought within Islam admit the usefulness or legitimacy of philosophical inquiry. Some argue that there is no indication that the limited knowledge and experience of humans can lead to truth. It is also important to observe that, while "reason" ('''aql'') is sometimes recognised as a source of Islamic law, this may have a totally different meaning from "reason" in [[philosophy]].
 
The historiography of Islamic philosophy is marked by disputes as to how the subject should be properly interpreted.  Some of the key issues involve the comparative importance of eastern intellectuals such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and of western thinkers such as Ibn Rushd,<ref>See [[Henry Corbin]], ''History of Islamic Philosophy''</ref> and also whether Islamic philosophy can be read at face value or should be interpreted in an [[esotericism|esoteric]] fashion.  Supporters of the latter thesis, like [[Leo Strauss]], maintain that Islamic philosophers wrote so as to conceal their true meaning in order to avoid [[religious persecution]], but scholars such as [[Oliver Leaman]] disagree.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Classical Islamic Philosophy|pages=211–12|author=Oliver Leaman|edition=2|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521793432|author-link=Oliver Leaman}}</ref>

== Formative influences ==
The main sources of classical or early Islamic philosophy are the religion of Islam itself (especially ideas derived and interpreted from the [[Quran]]) and [[Greek philosophy]] which the early Muslims inherited as a result of conquests, along with pre-Islamic [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Persian philosophy]]. Many of the early philosophical debates centered around reconciling religion and reason, the latter exemplified by Greek philosophy.

== Early Islamic philosophy ==
{{main|Early Islamic philosophy}}
[[File:Sughrat.jpg|200px|thumb|An Arabic manuscript from the 13th century depicting [[Socrates]] (Soqrāt) in discussion with his pupils]]

In early Islamic thought, which refers to philosophy during the "[[Islamic Golden Age]]", traditionally dated between the 8th and 12th centuries, two main currents may be distinguished. The first is [[Kalam]], which mainly dealt with [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] questions, and the other is [[#Falsafa|Falsafa]], which was founded on interpretations of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. There were attempts by later philosopher-theologians at harmonizing both trends, notably by [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina (Avicenna)]] who founded the school of [[Avicennism]], [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd (Averroes)]] who founded the school of [[Averroism]], and others such as [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) and [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]].

===''Kalam''===
{{main|Kalam}}
''ʿIlm al-Kalām'' ({{lang-ar|{{big|علم الكلام}}}}) is the philosophy that seeks [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] principles through [[dialectic]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word literally means "speech".<ref>Simon van den Bergh, in his commentary on [[Averroes]]' ''Incoherence of the Incoherence'', argues that Kalām was influenced by Greek [[Stoicism]] and that the term ''mutakallimun'' (those who speak to each other, i.e. dialecticians) is derived from the Stoics' description of themselves as ''dialektikoi''.</ref>

One of the first debates was that between partisans of the ''[[Predestination in Islam|Qadar]]'' ({{lang|ar|{{big|قدر}}}} meaning "Fate"), who affirmed [[free will]]; and the ''Jabarites'' ({{lang|ar|{{big|جبر}}}} meaning "force", "constraint"), who believed in [[fatalism]].

At the 2nd century of the [[Hijri year|Hijra]], a new movement arose in the theological school of [[Basra]], [[Iraq]]. A pupil of [[Hasan of Basra]], [[Wasil ibn Ata]], left the group when he disagreed with his teacher on whether a Muslim who has committed a major sin invalidates his faith. He systematized the radical opinions of preceding sects, particularly those of the Qadarites and Jabarites. This new school was called ''[[Mu'tazila|Mu'tazilite]]'' (from ''i'tazala'', to separate oneself).

The Mu'tazilites looked in towards a strict [[rationalism]] with which to interpret Islamic doctrine. Their attempt was one of the first to pursue a [[rational theology]] in Islam. They were however severely criticized by other Islamic philosophers, both [[Maturidi]]s and [[Asharites]]. The great Asharite scholar [[Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi]] wrote the work ''Al-Mutakallimin fi 'Ilm al-Kalam'' against the Mutazalites.

In later times, ''Kalam'' was used to mean simply "theology", i.e. the ''duties of the heart'' as opposed to (or in conjunction with) [[fiqh]]'' (jurisprudence), the ''duties of the body''.<ref name="Wolfson1976">{{cite book |last=Wolfson |first=Harry Austryn |title=The philosophy of the Kalam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fuv8J-g7EdAC&pg=PA1 |access-date=28 May 2011 |year=1976 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-66580-4 |pages=3–4}}</ref>

===''Falsafa''===
''Falsafa'' is a [[Greek language|Greek]] [[loanword]] meaning "philosophy" (the Greek pronunciation ''philosophia'' became ''falsafa''). From the 9th century onward, due to [[Caliph]] [[al-Ma'mun]] and his successor, [[ancient Greek philosophy]] was introduced among the [[arab]]s and the [[Peripatetic School]] began to find able representatives. Among them were [[Al-Kindi]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]]. Another trend, represented by the [[Brethren of Purity]], used Aristotelian language to expound a fundamentally [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] and [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagorean]] world view.

During the [[Abbasid caliphate]], a number of thinkers and scientists, some of them [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] Muslims or non-Muslims, played a role in transmitting Greek, [[Hindu]] and other pre-Islamic knowledge to the [[Christians|Christian]] [[Western world|West]]. They contributed to making [[Aristotle]] known in Christian [[Europe]]. Three speculative thinkers, Al-Farabi, Avicenna and [[Al-Kindi]], combined [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] with other ideas introduced through Islam.

===End of the classical period===
By the 12th century, ''Kalam'', attacked by both the philosophers and the orthodox, perished for lack of champions. At the same time, however, ''Falsafa'' came under serious critical scrutiny.  The most devastating attack came from [[Al-Ghazali]], whose work ''Tahafut al-Falasifa'' (''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'') attacked the main arguments of the Peripatetic School.<ref>Leaman, 25, 27.  "In this book [''Intentions of the philosophers''] he seeks to set out clearly the views of his opponents before demolishing them, in the subsequent ''Incoherence of the philosophers''."</ref>

Averroes, [[Maimonides]]' contemporary, was one of the last of the Islamic Peripatetics and set out to defend the views of the ''Falsafa'' against al-Ghazali's criticism. The theories of Ibn Rushd do not differ fundamentally from those of [[Ibn Bajjah]] and [[Ibn Tufail]], who only follow the teachings of Avicenna and Al-Farabi. Like all Islamic Peripatetics, Averroes admits the hypothesis of the intelligence of the spheres and the hypothesis of universal emanation, through which motion is communicated from place to place to all parts of the universe as far as the supreme world—hypotheses which, in the mind of the Arabic philosophers, did away with the dualism involved in Aristotle's doctrine of pure energy and eternal matter.

But while Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and other Persian and Muslim philosophers hurried, so to speak, over subjects that trenched on traditional beliefs, Ibn Rushd delighted in dwelling upon them with full particularity and stress. Thus he says, "Not only is matter eternal, but form is potentially inherent in matter; otherwise, it were a creation ''ex nihilo''" (Munk, "Mélanges," p.&nbsp;444). According to this theory, therefore, the existence of this world is not only a possibility, as Avicenna declared, but also a necessity.

== Logic ==
{{main|Logic in Islamic philosophy}}

In early Islamic philosophy, [[logic]] played an important role. [[Sharia]] (Islamic law) placed importance on formulating standards of argument, which gave rise to a novel approach to logic in [[Kalam]], but this approach was later displaced by ideas from [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]] with the rise of the [[Mu'tazili]] philosophers, who highly valued [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]''. The works of Hellenistic-influenced Islamic philosophers were crucial in the reception of Aristotelian logic in medieval Europe, along with the commentaries on the ''Organon'' by [[Averroes]]. The works of [[al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], [[al-Ghazali]] and other Muslim logicians who often criticized and corrected Aristotelian logic and introduced their own forms of logic, also played a central role in the subsequent development of European logic during the [[Renaissance]].

According to the ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'':

{{quote|For the Islamic philosophers, logic included not only the study of formal patterns of [[inference]] and their validity but also elements of the philosophy of language and even of [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]]. Because of territorial disputes with the Arabic grammarians, Islamic philosophers were very interested in working out the relationship between logic and language, and they devoted much discussion to the question of the subject matter and aims of logic in relation to reasoning and speech. In the area of formal logical analysis, they elaborated upon the theory of [[terminology|terms]], [[Proposition (philosophy)|proposition]]s and [[syllogism]]s as formulated in Aristotle's Categories, De interpretatione and Prior Analytics. In the spirit of Aristotle, they considered the syllogism to be the form to which all rational argumentation could be reduced, and they regarded syllogistic theory as the focal point of logic. Even poetics was considered as a syllogistic art in some fashion by most of the major Islamic Aristotelians.}}

Important developments made by Muslim logicians included the development of "Avicennian logic" as a replacement of Aristotelian logic. [[Avicenna]]'s [[system of logic]] was responsible for the introduction of [[hypothetical syllogism]], [[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[modal logic]] and [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]]. Other important developments in early Islamic philosophy include the development of a strict [[scientific citation|science of citation]], the [[isnad]] or "backing", and the development of a method to disprove claims, the [[ijtihad]], which was generally applied to many types of questions.

===Logic in Islamic law and theology===
Early forms of [[Analogy|analogical reasoning]], [[inductive reasoning]] and categorical [[syllogism]] were introduced in [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence), [[Sharia]] and [[Kalam]] (Islamic theology) from the 7th century with the process of ''[[Qiyas]]'', before the Arabic translations of Aristotle's works. Later, during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], there was debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term ''Qiyas'' refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that ''Qiyas'' refers to inductive reasoning. [[Ibn Hazm]] (994–1064) disagreed, arguing that ''Qiyas'' does not refer to inductive reasoning but to [[Syllogism|categorical syllogistic reasoning]] in a [[Reality|real]] sense and analogical reasoning in a [[metaphor]]ical sense. On the other hand, [[al-Ghazali]] (1058–1111; and, in modern times, [[Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi]]) argued that ''Qiyas'' refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term ''Qiyas'' refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a real sense.<ref>Wael B. Hallaq (1993), ''Ibn Taymiyya Against the Greek Logicians'', p. 48. Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-824043-0}}.</ref>

===Aristotelian logic===
The first original Arabic writings on logic were produced by [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) (805–873), who produced a summary on earlier logic up to his time. The first writings on logic with non-Aristotelian elements was produced by [[al-Farabi]] (Alfarabi) (873–950), who discussed the topics of future [[contingent]]s, the [[number]] and relation of the [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]], the relation between [[logic]] and [[grammar]], and non-Aristotelian forms of [[inference]].<ref name=Britannica>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.</ref> He is also credited for categorizing logic into two separate groups, the first being "idea" and the second being "[[logical argument|proof]]".

[[Averroes]] (1126–1198), author of the most elaborate commentaries on Aristotelian logic, was the last major logician from [[al-Andalus]].

===Avicennian logic===
[[Avicenna]] (980–1037) developed his own system of logic known as "Avicennian logic" as an alternative to Aristotelian logic. By the 12th century, Avicennian logic had replaced Aristotelian logic as the dominant system of logic in the Islamic world.<ref>I. M. Bochenski (1961), "On the history of the history of logic", ''A history of formal logic'', pp. 4–10. Translated by I. Thomas, Notre Dame, [[Indiana University Press]]. ([[cf.]] [http://www.formalontology.it/islamic-philosophy.htm Ancient Islamic (Arabic and Persian) Logic and Ontology])</ref>

The first criticisms of Aristotelian logic were written by [[Avicenna]] (980–1037), who produced independent treatises on logic rather than commentaries. He criticized the logical school of Baghdad for their devotion to Aristotle at the time. He investigated the theory of [[definition]] and [[Classification theorems|classification]] and the [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] of the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s of categorical [[Proposition (philosophy)|proposition]]s, and developed an original theory on "[[Temporal logic|temporal]] [[Modal logic|modal]]" syllogism. Its premises included [[Grammatical modifier|modifier]]s such as "at all times", "at most times", and "at some time".

While [[Avicenna]] (980–1037) often relied on [[deductive reasoning]] in philosophy, he used a different approach in medicine. Ibn Sina contributed inventively to the development of [[inductive reasoning|inductive logic]], which he used to pioneer the idea of a [[syndrome]]. In his medical writings, Avicenna was the first to describe the [[Mill's Methods|methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variation]] which are critical to inductive logic and the [[scientific method]].<ref name=Goodman>Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.</ref>

[[Ibn Hazm]] (994–1064) wrote the ''Scope of Logic'', in which he stressed on the importance of [[sense]] [[perception]] as a source of knowledge.<ref name=Herald>[http://www.islamherald.com/asp/explore/science/science_muslim_scientists.asp Science and Muslim Scientists] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020090525/http://www.islamherald.com/asp/explore/science/science_muslim_scientists.asp |date=2007-10-20 }}, Islam Herald.</ref> [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel) (1058–1111) had an important influence on the use of logic in theology, making use of Avicennian logic in [[Kalam]].<ref name=Britannica/> Despite the logical sophistication of [[al-Ghazali]], the rise of the [[Ash'ari]] school in the 12th century slowly suffocated original work on logic in much of the Islamic world, though logic continued to be studied in some Islamic regions such as [[History of Iran|Persia]] and the [[Levant]].

[[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (b. 1149) criticised Aristotle's "[[Syllogism|first figure]]" and developed a form of [[Inductive reasoning|inductive logic]], foreshadowing the system of inductive logic developed by [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873). Systematic refutations of Greek logic were written by the [[Illuminationist philosophy|Illuminationist school]], founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] (1155–1191), who developed the idea of "decisive necessity", an important innovation in the history of logical philosophical speculation,<ref>Another systematic refutation of Greek logic was written by [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (1263–1328), the ''Ar-Radd 'ala al-Mantiqiyyin'' (''Refutation of Greek Logicians''), where he argued against the usefulness, though not the validity, of the [[syllogism]] See pp.&nbsp;253–54 of {{citation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-52069-0 |pages=247–65 |editor=Peter Adamson |editor2=Richard C.

== Metaphysics ==

===Cosmological and ontological arguments===
{{see|Proof of the Truthful|Kalam cosmological argument}}
[[Avicenna]]'s proof for the [[existence of God]] was the first [[ontological argument]], which he proposed in the ''Metaphysics'' section of ''[[The Book of Healing]]''.<ref name=Johnson>Steve A. Johnson (1984), "Ibn Sina's Fourth Ontological Argument for God's Existence", ''The Muslim World'' '''74''' (3–4), 161–71.</ref><ref name=Morewedge>{{citation |last=Morewedge |first=P. |title=Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Malcolm and the Ontological Argument |journal=Monist |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=234–49|doi=10.5840/monist197054212 |year=1970 }}</ref> This was the first attempt at using the method of [[A priori (philosophy)|a priori proof]], which utilizes intuition and reason alone. Avicenna's proof of God's existence is unique in that it can be classified as both a [[cosmological argument]] and an ontological argument. "It is ontological insofar as ‘necessary existence’ in intellect is the first basis for arguing for a Necessary Existent". The proof is also "cosmological insofar as most of it is taken up with arguing that contingent existents cannot stand alone and must end up in a Necessary Existent."<ref>{{citation |first=Toby |last=Mayer |title=Ibn Sina's 'Burhan Al-Siddiqin' |year=2001 |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |publisher=[[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]], Oxford Journals, Oxford University Press |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=18–39 |doi=10.1093/jis/12.1.18}}</ref>

===Distinction between essence and existence===
Islamic philosophy, imbued as it is with [[Kalam|Islamic theology]], distinguishes more clearly than [[Aristotelianism]] the difference between [[essence]] and [[existence]]. Whereas existence is the domain of the [[contingent]] and the accidental, essence endures within a [[being]] beyond the accidental. This was first described by [[Avicenna]]'s works on [[metaphysics]], who was himself influenced by [[al-Farabi]].

Some orientalists (or those particularly influenced by [[Thomism|Thomist]] scholarship) argued that Avicenna was the first to view existence (''wujud'') as an accident that happens to the essence (''mahiyya'').  However, this aspect of ontology is not the most central to the distinction that Avicenna established between essence and existence.  One cannot therefore make the claim that Avicenna was the proponent of the concept of [[essentialism]] ''per se'', given that existence (''al-wujud'') when thought of in terms of necessity would ontologically translate into a notion of the "Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself" (''wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi''), which is without description or definition and, in particular, without [[quiddity]] or essence (''la mahiyya lahu''). Consequently, Avicenna's [[ontology]] is '[[Existentialism|existentialist]]' when accounting for being–''[[wikt:qua|qua]]''–existence in terms of necessity (''wujub''), while it is [[Essentialism|essentialist]] in terms of thinking about being–''qua''–existence in terms of "contingency–''qua''–possibility" (''imkan'' or ''mumkin al-wujud'', meaning "contingent being").<ref>For recent discussions of this question, see Nader El-Bizri, "Avicenna and Essentialism", ''The Review of Metaphysics'', Vol. 54 (June 2001), pp. 753–78.</ref>

Some argue that Avicenna anticipated [[Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] in "holding that existence is an accident of accidents" and also anticipated [[Alexius Meinong]]'s "view about [[nonexistent object]]s."<ref>{{citation |first=Herrera Ibáñez |last=Alejandro |title=La distinción entre esencia y existencia en Avicena |journal=Revista Latinoamericana de Filosofía |volume=16 |pages=183–95 |year=1990 |url=http://www.formalontology.it/avicenna.htm |access-date=2008-01-29}}</ref> He also provided early arguments for "a "[[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary]] being" as [[First cause|cause of all other existents]]."<ref>{{citation |first=Hourani George |last=Fadlo |title=Ibn Sina on necessary and possible existence |journal=Philosophical Forum |volume=4 |pages=74–86 |year=1972 |url=http://www.formalontology.it/avicenna-biblio-one.htm |access-date=2008-01-29}}</ref>

The idea of "essence preced[ing] existence" is a concept which dates back to [[Avicenna]]<ref name=Irwin/> and [[Avicennism|his school]] as well as [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]]<ref name="Razavi 1997 129">{{Harvp|Razavi|1997|p=129}}</ref> and his [[Illuminationist philosophy]]. "[[Existence precedes essence|Existence preced[ing] essence]]", the opposite (existentialist) notion, was developed in the works of [[Averroes]]<ref name=Irwin/> and [[Mulla Sadra]]'s [[transcendent theosophy]].
<!----Following sounds more like opinion than encyclopedic content..?:
More careful approaches are needed in terms of thinking about philosophers (and theologians) in Islam in terms of phenomenological methods of investigation in [[ontology]] (or onto-theology), or by way of comparisons that are made with [[Heidegger]]'s thought and his critique of the history of metaphysics.<ref>For recent studies that engage in this line of research with care and thoughtful deliberation, see: Nader El-Bizri, ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000)</ref>

===Resurrection===
Ibn al-Nafis wrote the ''Theologus Autodidactus'' as a defense of "the system of Islam and the Muslims' doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world." The book presents rational arguments for bodily [[resurrection]] and the [[immortality]] of the human soul, using both demonstrative [[reasoning]] and material from the hadith corpus as forms of [[evidence]]. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to [[Avicenna]]'s [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] argument on [[spirit]]ual resurrection (as opposed to bodily resurrection), which was earlier criticized by [[al-Ghazali]].<ref>Fancy, pp. 42, 60</ref>

===Soul and spirit===
The [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physician]]-philosophers, [[Avicenna]] and [[Ibn al-Nafis]], developed their own theories on the soul. They both made a distinction between the soul and the [[spirit]], and in particular, the [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] doctrine on the nature of the soul was influential among the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]. Some of Avicenna's views on the soul included the idea that the [[immortality]] of the soul is a consequence of its nature, and not a purpose for it to fulfill. In his theory of "The Ten Intellects", he viewed the human soul as the tenth and final [[intellect]].

Avicenna generally supported [[Aristotle]]'s idea of the soul originating from the [[heart]], whereas Ibn al-Nafis on the other hand rejected this idea and instead argued that the soul "is related to the entirety and not to one or a few [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]s." He further criticized Aristotle's idea that every unique soul requires the existence of a unique source, in this case the heart. Ibn al-Nafis concluded that "the soul is related primarily neither to the spirit nor to any organ, but rather to the entire matter whose temperament is prepared to receive that soul" and he defined the soul as nothing other than "what a human indicates by saying ‘[[I (pronoun)|I]]’."<ref>Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), [http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615 "Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)"], pp. 209–10 (''Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]]).</ref>

===Thought experiments===
{{further|Avicenna#Thought experiments}}
While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near [[Hamadhan]], [[Avicenna]] wrote his "Floating Man" [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality of the soul. He referred to the living human [[intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[Hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates truth to the human [[mind]] and imparts order and [[intelligibility (philosophy)|intelligibility]] to [[nature]]. His "Floating Man" thought experiment tells its readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no [[Sense|sensory]] contact with even their own bodies. He argues that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. He thus concludes that the idea of the [[Self (philosophy)|self]] is not logically dependent on any physical [[Object (philosophy)|thing]], and that the soul should not be seen in [[relative term]]s, but as a primary given, a [[Substance theory|substance]].<ref name=Leaman>Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.</ref>

This argument was later refined and simplified by [[René Descartes]] in [[epistemic]] terms when he stated: "I can abstract from the supposition of all external things, but not from the supposition of my own consciousness."<ref name=Leaman/>

===Time===
While ancient Greek philosophers believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, early [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] and theologians developed the concept of the universe having a [[Temporal finitism|finite past]] with a beginning. This view was inspired by the [[creationism]] shared by [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] [[John Philoponus]] presented a detailed argument against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. Muslim and Arab Jewish philosophers like [[Al-Kindi]], [[Saadia Gaon]], and [[Al-Ghazali]] developed further arguments, with most falling into two broad categories: assertions of the "impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite" and of the "impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition".<ref name=Craig>{{citation |title=Whitrow and Popper on the Impossibility of an Infinite Past |first=William Lane |last=Craig |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume=30 |issue=2 |date=June 1979 |pages=165–70 [165–66] |doi=10.1093/bjps/30.2.165}}</ref>

===Truth===
In [[metaphysics]], [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) defined truth as:

{{quote|What corresponds in the mind to what is outside it.<ref>Osman Amin (2007), "Influence of Muslim Philosophy on the West", ''Monthly Renaissance'' '''17''' (11).</ref>}}

Avicenna elaborated on his definition of truth in his ''[[Metaphysics]]'':

{{quote|The truth of a thing is the property of the being of each thing which has been established in it.<ref name=Aertsen>Jan A. Aertsen (1988), ''Nature and Creature: Thomas Aquinas's Way of Thought'', p. 152. BRILL, {{ISBN|90-04-08451-7}}.</ref>}}

In his ''Quodlibeta'', [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote a commentary on Avicenna's definition of truth in his ''Metaphysics'' and explained it as follows:

{{quote|The truth of each thing, as Avicenna says in his ''Metaphysica'', is nothing else than the property of its being which has been established in it. So that is called true gold which has properly the being of gold and attains to the established determinations of the nature of gold. Now, each thing has properly being in some nature because it stands under the complete form proper to that nature, whereby being and species in that nature is.<ref name=Aertsen/>}}

Early [[#Political philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find truth.

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen) reasoned that to discover the truth about nature, it is necessary to eliminate human opinion and error, and allow the universe to speak for itself.<ref name=Ezine/> In his ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', Ibn al-Haytham further wrote the following comments on truth:

{{quote|Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...<ref name=Sabra/>}}

{{quote|Therefore, the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.<ref name=Sabra/>}}

{{quote|I constantly sought knowledge and truth, and it became my belief that for gaining access to the [[Wiktionary:effulgence|effulgence]] and closeness to God, there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge.<ref name=Plott/>}}

=== Free will and predestination ===

The issue of free will versus predestination issue is one of the "most contentious topics in classical Islamic thought."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cillis|first1=Maria|title=Free Will and Predestination in Islamic Thought: Theoretical Compromises in the Works of Avicenna, al-Ghazali and Ibn 'Arabi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YliAgAAQBAJ&q=predestination&pg=PA142|isbn=9781317937043|date=2013-12-17}}</ref> In accordance with the Islamic belief in [[predestination]], or divine preordainment (''al-qadā wa'l-qadar''), God has full knowledge and control over all that occurs. This is explained in Qur'anic verses such as "Say: 'Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us: He is our protector'..."<ref>
* {{Cite quran|9|51|style=ref}}
* {{Harvtxt|Cohen-Mor|2001|p=4}}: "The idea of predestination is reinforced by the frequent mention of events 'being written' or 'being in a book' before they happen: 'Say: "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us..."&nbsp;'&nbsp;"
* {{Cite encyclopedia | title=Fate | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an Online | author=Ahmet T. Karamustafa }}: The verb ''qadara'' literally means "to measure, to determine". Here it is used to mean that "God measures and orders his creation".
</ref> For Muslims, everything in the world that occurs, good or bad, has been preordained and nothing can happen unless permitted by God. According to Muslim theologians, although events are pre-ordained, man possesses free will in that he or she has the faculty to choose between right and wrong, and is thus responsible for his actions. According to Islamic tradition, all that has been decreed by God is written in ''al-Lawh al-Mahfūz'', the "Preserved Tablet".<ref>

===Atomism===
{{see also|Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam}}
[[Atomism|Atomistic]] philosophies are found very early in Islamic philosophy, and represent a synthesis of the Greek and Indian ideas.  Like both the Greek and Indian versions, Islamic atomism was a charged topic that had the potential for conflict with the prevalent religious orthodoxy.  Yet it was such a fertile and flexible idea that, as in Greece and India, it flourished in some schools of Islamic thought.

The most successful form of Islamic atomism was in the [[Asharite]] school of philosophy, most notably in the work of the philosopher [[al-Ghazali]] (1058–1111).  In [[Asharite]] atomism, atoms are the only perpetual, material things in existence, and all else in the world is "accidental" meaning something that lasts for only an instant.  Nothing accidental can be the cause of anything else, except perception, as it exists for a moment.  Contingent events are not subject to natural physical causes, but are the direct result of God's constant intervention, without which nothing could happen.  Thus nature is completely dependent on God, which meshes with other Asharite Islamic ideas on [[Causality|causation]], or the lack thereof.<ref name="Gardet">L. Gardet (2001), "djuz’", in ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', CD-ROM Edition, v. 1.1, Leiden: Brill</ref>

Other traditions in Islam rejected the atomism of the Asharites and expounded on many Greek texts, especially those of Aristotle.  An active school of philosophers in Spain, including the noted commentator [[Averroes]] (1126-1198 AD) explicitly rejected the thought of al-Ghazali and turned to an extensive evaluation of the thought of Aristotle.  Averroes commented in detail on most of the works of Aristotle and his commentaries did much to guide the interpretation of Aristotle in later Jewish and Christian scholastic thought.

===Cosmology===
{{main|Astronomy in medieval Islam}}
There are several [[cosmological]] verses in the [[Qur'an]] (610–632) which some modern writers have interpreted as foreshadowing the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] and possibly even the [[Big Bang]] theory:<ref>{{cite web |author=A. Abd-Allah |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/scislam.html |title=The Qur'an, Knowledge, and Science |publisher=[[University of Southern California]] |access-date=2008-01-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128054613/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/scislam.html |archive-date=2008-11-28 }}</ref>

<blockquote> Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before we clove them asunder? {{cite quran|21|30|t=y|style=ref}}</blockquote>
<blockquote> We have built the heaven with might, and We it is Who make the vast extent (thereof). {{cite quran|51|47|t=p|style=ref}}</blockquote>

In contrast to ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] who believed that the [[universe]] had an infinite past with no beginning, [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] and theologians developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning. This view was inspired by the [[creation myth]] shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]], [[John Philoponus]], presented the first such argument against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. His reasoning was adopted by many, most notably; Muslim philosopher, [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus); the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]], [[Saadia Gaon]] (Saadia ben Joseph); and the [[Kalam|Muslim theologian]], [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel). They used two logical arguments against an infinite past, the first being the "argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite", which states:<ref name=Craig/>

:"An actual infinite cannot exist."
:"An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite."
:".•. An infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist."

The second argument, the "argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition", states:<ref name=Craig/>

:"An actual infinite cannot be completed by successive addition."
:"The temporal series of past events has been completed by successive addition."
:".•. The temporal series of past events cannot be an actual infinite."

Both arguments were adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians, and the second argument in particular became famous after it was adopted by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his thesis of the first antimony concerning time.<ref name=Craig/>

In the 10th century, the [[Brethren of Purity]] published the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]'', in which a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] view of the universe is expressed in a section on cosmology:<ref>{{Harvp|Nasr|1993|p=77}}</ref>

{{quote|God has placed the Sun at the center of the Universe just as the capital of a country is placed in its middle and the ruler's palace at the center of the city.}}

===Evolution===

====Struggle for existence====
The [[Mu'tazili]] scientist and philosopher [[al-Jahiz]] (c. 776–869) was the first of the Muslim biologists and philosophers to develop an early theory of [[evolution]]. He speculated on the influence of the environment on animals, considered the effects of the environment on the likelihood of an animal to survive, and first described the [[The Origin of Species#Struggle for existence, natural selection, and divergence|struggle for existence]], a precursor to [[natural selection]].<ref>Conway Zirkle (1941). Natural Selection before the "Origin of Species", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''84''' (1), pp. 71–123.</ref><ref>Mehmet Bayrakdar (Third Quarter, 1983). "Al-Jahiz And the Rise of Biological Evolutionism", ''The Islamic Quarterly''. London.</ref> Al-Jahiz's ideas on the struggle for existence in the ''Book of Animals'' have been summarized as follows:

{{quote|Animals engage in a struggle for existence; for [[Natural resource|resources]], to avoid being eaten and to [[breed]]. Environmental factors influence [[organism]]s to develop new characteristics to ensure survival, thus transforming into new species. Animals that survive to breed can pass on their successful characteristics to offspring.<ref>Ehsan Masood, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/feb/27/islam-religion-evolution-science "Islam's evolutionary legacy"], ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>}}

In Chapter 47 of ''India'', entitled "On Vasudeva and the Wars of the Bharata," [[Abu Rayhan Biruni]] attempted to give a [[Natural history|naturalistic explanation]] as to why the struggles described in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' "had to take place." He explains it using [[Nature|natural]] processes that include [[Biology|biological]] ideas related to evolution, which has led several scholars to compare his ideas to [[Darwinism]] and [[natural selection]]. This is due to Biruni describing the idea of [[artificial selection]] and then applying it to nature:<ref>{{citation|title=On the Presumed Darwinism of Alberuni Eight Hundred Years before Darwin|author=Jan Z. Wilczynski|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume=50|issue=4|date=December 1959|pages=459–66 [459–61]|doi=10.1086/348801|s2cid=143086988}}</ref>

{{quote|The agriculturist selects his corn, letting grow as much as he requires, and tearing out the remainder. The forester leaves those branches which he perceives to be excellent, whilst he cuts away all others. The bees kill those of their kind who only eat, but do not work in their beehive. Nature proceeds in a similar way; however, it does not distinguish for its action is under all circumstances one and the same. It allows the leaves and fruit of the trees to perish, thus preventing them from realising that result which they are intended to produce in the economy of nature. It removes them so as to make room for others.}}

In the 13th century, [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]] explains how the [[Classical element|element]]s evolved into [[mineral]]s, then [[plant]]s, then [[animal]]s, and then [[human]]s. Tusi then goes on to explain how [[Heredity|hereditary]] variability was an important factor for biological evolution of living things:<ref name=Alakbarov>Farid Alakbarov (Summer 2001). [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/92_folder/92_articles/92_tusi.html A 13th-Century Darwin? Tusi's Views on Evolution], ''[[Azerbaijan International]]'' '''9''' (2).</ref>

{{quote|The [[organism]]s that can gain the new features faster are more variable. As a result, they gain advantages over other creatures. [...] The bodies are changing as a result of the internal and external interactions.}}

Tusi discusses how organisms are able to [[Adaptation|adapt]] to their environments:<ref name=Alakbarov/>

{{quote|Look at the world of animals and birds. They have all that is necessary for defense, protection and daily life, including strengths, courage and appropriate tools [organs] [...] Some of these organs are real weapons, [...] For example, horns-spear, teeth and claws-knife and needle, feet and hoofs-cudgel. The thorns and needles of some animals are similar to arrows. [...] Animals that have no other means of defense (as the gazelle and fox) protect themselves with the help of flight and cunning. [...] Some of them, for example, bees, ants and some bird species, have united in communities in order to protect themselves and help each other.}}

Tusi then explains how humans evolved from advanced animals:<ref name=Alakbarov/>

{{quote|Such humans [probably [[anthropoid ape]]s] live in the Western [[Sudan]] and other distant corners of the world. They are close to animals by their habits, deeds and behavior. [...] The human has features that distinguish him from other creatures, but he has other features that unite him with the animal world, vegetable kingdom or even with the inanimate bodies.}}

====Transmutation of species====
[[Al-Dinawari]] (828–896), considered the founder of [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|Arabic botany]] for his ''Book of Plants'', discussed [[plant evolution]] from its birth to its death, describing the phases of [[plant growth]] and the production of flowers and fruit.<ref name=Fahd-815>{{citation |last=Fahd |first=Toufic |title=Botany and agriculture |pages=815 |postscript=.}}, in {{Harvp|Morelon|Rashed|1996}}</ref>

[[Ibn Miskawayh]]'s ''al-Fawz al-Asghar'' and the [[Brethren of Purity]]'s ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity]]'' (''The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa'') developed theories on evolution that possibly had an influence on [[Charles Darwin]] and his inception of [[Darwinism]], but has at one time been criticized as overenthusiastic.<ref name=Muqaddimah-Footnotes>[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter6/Ch_6_05Footnote.htm Footnote 27a] to Chapter 6, Part 5 in {{citation |last=Khaldūn |first=Ibn |others=Franz Rosenthal (trans.) |title=The Muqaddimah |url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/}}</ref>

{{quote|[These books] state that God first created [[matter]] and invested it with [[energy]] for development. Matter, therefore, adopted the form of [[vapour]] which assumed the shape of water in due time. The next stage of development was [[mineral]] life. Different kinds of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]s developed in course of time. Their highest form being mirjan ([[coral]]). It is a stone which has in it branches like those of a tree. After mineral life evolves [[vegetation]]. The evolution of vegetation culminates with a tree which bears the qualities of an animal. This is the [[Date Palm|date-palm]]. It has male and female genders. It does not wither if all its branches are chopped but it dies when the head is cut off. The date-palm is therefore considered the highest among the trees and resembles the lowest among animals. Then is born the lowest of animals. It evolves into an [[ape]]. This is not the statement of Darwin. This is what Ibn Maskawayh states and this is precisely what is written in the ''Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa''. The Muslim thinkers state that ape then evolved into a lower kind of a [[barbarian]] man. He then became a superior human being. Man becomes a [[saint]], a [[prophet]]. He evolves into a higher stage and becomes an [[angel]]. The one higher to angels is indeed none but God. Everything begins from Him and everything returns to Him.<ref name=Hamidullah>[[Muhammad Hamidullah]] and Afzal Iqbal (1993), ''The Emergence of Islam: Lectures on the Development of Islamic World-view, Intellectual Tradition and Polity'', pp. 143–44. Islamic Research Institute, Islamabad.</ref>}}

English translations of the ''Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity'' were available from 1812,<ref>"Ikhwan as-Safa and their Rasa'il: A Critical Review of a Century and a Half of Research", by A. L. Tibawi, as published in volume 2 of ''The Islamic Quarterly'' in 1955; pp. 28–46</ref> while [[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[manuscript]]s of the ''al-Fawz al-Asghar'' and ''The Epistles of Ikhwan al-Safa'' were also available at the [[University of Cambridge]] by the 19th century. These works likely had an influence on 19th-century evolutionists, and possibly [[Charles Darwin]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In the 14th century, [[Ibn Khaldun]] further developed the evolutionary ideas found in the ''Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity''. The following statements from his 1377 work, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', express evolutionary ideas:

{{quote|We explained there that the whole of existence in (all) its simple and composite worlds is arranged in a natural order of ascent and descent, so that everything constitutes an uninterrupted continuum. The essences at the end of each particular stage of the worlds are by nature prepared to be transformed into the essence adjacent to them, either above or below them. This is the case with the simple material elements; it is the case with palms and vines, (which constitute) the last stage of plants, in their relation to snails and shellfish, (which constitute) the (lowest) stage of animals. It is also the case with monkeys, creatures combining in themselves cleverness and perception, in their relation to man, the being who has the ability to think and to reflect. The preparedness (for transformation) that exists on either side, at each stage of the worlds, is meant when (we speak about) their connection.<ref>[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter6/Ch_6_05.htm ''Muqaddimah'', Chapter 6, Part 5]</ref>}}

{{quote|Plants do not have the same fineness and power that animals have. Therefore, the sages rarely turned to them. Animals are the last and final stage of the three permutations. Minerals turn into plants, and plants into animals, but animals cannot turn into anything finer than themselves.<ref>[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter6/Ch_6_29.htm ''Muqaddimah'', Chapter 6, Part 29]</ref>}}

Numerous other Islamic scholars and scientists, including the polymaths [[Ibn al-Haytham]] and [[Al-Khazini]], discussed and developed these ideas. Translated into Latin, these works began to appear in the West after the [[Renaissance]] and may have influenced [[Western philosophy]] and science.

===Phenomenology of Vision===
{{see also|Book of Optics}}
The polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen) is considered a pioneer of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. He articulated a relationship between the physical and observable [[World (philosophy)|world]] and that of [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[psychology]] and [[mental function]]s. His theories regarding knowledge and [[perception]], linking the domains of science and religion, led to a philosophy of existence based on the direct observation of [[reality]] from the observer's point of view. Much of his thought on phenomenology was not further developed until the 20th century.<ref>[[Nader El-Bizri]], 'A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen's Optics', Arabic Sciences and Philosophy 15 (2005), 189–218; [[Nader El-Bizri]],'La perception de la profondeur: Alhazen, Berkeley, et Merleau-Ponty', Oriens-Occidens: Cahiers du centre d'histoire des sciences et des philosophies arabes et médiévales, CNRS. 5 (2004), 171–184; and see a short essay by Valérie Gonzalez, "Universality and Modernity", ''The Ismaili United Kingdom'', December 2002, pp. 50–53.</ref>

===Philosophy of mind===
{{main|Psychology in medieval Islam}}
The [[philosophy of mind]] was studied in medieval [[Islamic psychological thought]], which refers to the study of the ''[[nafs]]'' (literally "[[Self (philosophy)|self]]" or "[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]" in [[Arabic]]) in the [[Islamic world]], particularly during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (8th–15th centuries) as well as modern times (20th–21st centuries), and is related to [[psychology]], [[psychiatry]] and the [[neuroscience]]s.

===Place and space===
The Arab polymath al-Hasan [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen; died c. 1041) presented a thorough mathematical critique and refutation of [[Aristotle]]'s conception of place (''topos'') in his ''Risala/Qawl fi’l-makan'' (''Treatise/Discourse on Place'').

Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' (Book IV – ''Delta'') stated that the place of something is the two-dimensional boundary of the containing body that is at rest and is in contact with what it contains. Ibn al-Haytham disagreed with this definition and demonstrated that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined (three-dimensional) void (''al-khala' al-mutakhayyal'') between the inner surfaces of the containing body. He showed that place was akin to [[space]], foreshadowing [[Descartes]]'s notion of place as space qua ''Extensio'' or even [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s ''analysis situs''.  Ibn al-Haytham's mathematization of place rested on several geometric demonstrations, including his study on the sphere and other solids, which showed that the [[sphere]] (''al-kura'') is the largest in magnitude (volumetric) with respect to other geometric solids that have equal surface areas.  For instance, a sphere that has an equal surface area to that of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], would be larger in (volumetric) magnitude than the cylinder; hence, the sphere occupies a larger place than that occupied by the cylinder; unlike what is entailed by [[Aristotle]]'s definition of place: that this sphere and that cylinder occupy places that are equal in magnitude.<ref>Nader El-Bizri, "In Defence of the Sovereignty of Philosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place", ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press), Vol. 17, Issue 1 (2007): 57–80.</ref>  Ibn al-Haytham rejected [[Aristotle]]'s philosophical concept of place on mathematical grounds.  Later, the philosopher [[Abd-el-latif|'Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi]] (13th century) tried to defend the Aristotelian conception of place in a treatise titled: ''Fi al-Radd ‘ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan'' (''A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham's place''), although his effort was admirable from a philosophical standpoint, it was unconvincing from the scientific and mathematical viewpoints.<ref>El-Bizri (2007) and handouts of El-Bizri's lectures at the Dept. of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge [http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk]</ref>

Ibn al-Haytham also discussed [[Depth perception|space perception]] and its [[Epistemology|epistemological]] implications in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021). His experimental proof of the intromission model of vision led to changes in the way the [[visual perception]] of space was understood, contrary to the previous [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory of vision]] supported by [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]]. In "tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhacen unequivocally rejected the
intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for
correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things."<ref>{{citation|first=A. Mark|last=Smith|title=The Alhacenian Account Of Spatial Perception And Its Epistemological Implications|journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy|volume=15|issue=2|year=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=219–40|doi=10.1017/S0957423905000184}}</ref>

== Philosophy of education ==

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], an elementary school was known as a ''[[maktab]]'', which dates back to at least the 10th century. Like [[madrasah]]s (which referred to [[higher education]]), a maktab was often attached to a mosque. In the 11th century, [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (known as ''Avicenna'' in the West), in one of his books, wrote a chapter dealing with the ''maktab'' entitled "The Role of the Teacher in the Training and Upbringing of Children", as a guide to teachers working at ''maktab'' schools. He wrote that children can learn better if taught in [[class (education)|class]]es instead of individual [[tuition]] from private [[tutor]]s, and he gave a number of reasons for why this is the case, citing the value of [[competition]] and emulation among pupils as well as the usefulness of group [[discussion]]s and debates. Ibn Sina described the [[curriculum]] of a ''maktab'' school in some detail, describing the curricula for two stages of education in a ''maktab'' school.<ref name=Asimov>{{citation|title=The Age of Achievement: Vol 4|last=M. S. Asimov|first=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|year=1999|isbn=81-208-1596-3|pages=33–34}}</ref>

===Primary education===
Ibn Sina wrote that children should be sent to a ''maktab'' school from the age of 6 and be taught [[primary education]] until they reach the age of 14. During which time, he wrote that they should be taught the [[Qur'an]], [[Islamic metaphysics]], [[Arabic language|language]], [[Islamic literature|literature]], [[Islamic ethics]], and manual skills (which could refer to a variety of practical skills).<ref name=Asimov/>

===Secondary education===
Ibn Sina refers to the [[secondary education]] stage of ''maktab'' schooling as the period of specialization, when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status. He writes that children after the age of 14 should be given a choice to choose and specialize in subjects they have an interest in, whether it was reading, manual skills, literature, preaching, [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Islamic mathematics|geometry]], [[Islamic economics in the world|trade and commerce]], [[Inventions in medieval Islam|craftsmanship]], or any other subject or profession they would be interested in pursuing for a future [[career]]. He wrote that this was a transitional stage and that there needs to be flexibility regarding the age in which pupils graduate, as the student's emotional development and chosen subjects need to be taken into account.<ref>{{citation|title=The Age of Achievement: Vol 4|last=M. S. Asimov|first=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|year=1999|isbn=81-208-1596-3|pages=34–35}}</ref>

== Philosophy of science ==
{{see also|Islamic science}}

===Scientific method===
The pioneering development of the [[scientific method]] by the [[Arab]] [[Ash'ari]] polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen) was an important contribution to the [[philosophy of science]]. In the ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (c. 1025 CE), his scientific method was very similar to the modern scientific method and consisted of the following procedures:<ref name=Ezine>Bradley Steffens (2006). ''Ibn al-Haytham: First Scientist'', Morgan Reynolds Publishing, {{ISBN|1-59935-024-6}}. ([[cf.]] Bradley Steffens, "Who Was the First Scientist?", ''Ezine Articles''.)</ref>

#[[Observation]]
#Statement of [[Problem solving|problem]]
#Formulation of [[hypothesis]]
#Testing of hypothesis using [[experiment]]ation
#Analysis of experimental [[result]]s
#Interpretation of [[data]] and formulation of [[logical consequence|conclusion]]
#[[Publication]] of findings

In ''The Model of the Motions'', Ibn al-Haytham also describes an early version of [[Occam's razor]], where he employs only minimal hypotheses regarding the properties that characterize astronomical motions, as he attempts to eliminate from his planetary model the [[cosmology|cosmological]] hypotheses that cannot be observed from Earth.<ref>Roshdi Rashed (2007). "The Celestial Kinematics of Ibn al-Haytham", ''Arabic Sciences and Philosophy'' '''17''', pp. 7–55 [35–36]. [[Cambridge University Press]].</ref>

In ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', Ibn al-Haytham commented on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge:

{{quote|Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...<ref name=Sabra>[[A. I. Sabra|Sabra]] (2003). [http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/090351.html Ibn al-Haytham: Brief life of an Arab mathematician] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224948/http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/090351.html |date=2007-09-27 }}, ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'', October–December 2003.</ref>}}

He held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge:

{{quote|Therefore, the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and, following his natural disposition, puts his trust in them, but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them, the one who submits to argument and demonstration, and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency. Thus the duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.<ref name=Sabra/>}}

Ibn al-Haytham attributed his experimental [[scientific method]] and [[scientific skepticism]] to his Islamic faith. He believed that human beings are inherently flawed and that only God is perfect. He reasoned that to discover the truth about nature, it is necessary to eliminate human opinion and error, and allow the universe to speak for itself.<ref name=Ezine/> In ''The Winding Motion'', Ibn al-Haytham further wrote that [[faith]] should only apply to [[prophets of Islam]] and not to any other authorities, in the following comparison between the Islamic prophetic tradition and the demonstrative sciences:

{{quote|From the statements made by the noble [[Sheikh|Shaykh]], it is clear that he believes in [[Ptolemy]]'s words in everything he says, without relying on a demonstration or calling on a proof, but by pure imitation ([[taqlid]]); that is how [[Ulema|experts in the prophetic tradition]] have faith in Prophets, may the blessing of God be upon them.

Ibn al-Haytham described his search for truth and knowledge as a way of leading him closer to God:

{{quote|I constantly sought knowledge and truth, and it became my belief that for gaining access to the [[Wiktionary:effulgence|effulgence]] and closeness to God, there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge.<ref name=Plott>C.

His contemporary [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] also introduced an early scientific method in nearly every field of [[inquiry]] he studied. For example, in his treatise on [[mineralogy]], ''Kitab al-Jamahir'' (''Book of Precious Stones''), he is "the most [[Exact science|exact]] of experimental scientists", while in the introduction to his [[Indology|study of India]], he declares that "to execute our project, it has not been possible to follow the geometric method" and develops [[comparative sociology]] as a scientific method in the field.<ref name=Sardar>{{citation |first=Ziauddin |last=Sardar |author-link=Ziauddin Sardar |year=1998 |contribution=Science in Islamic philosophy |title=Islamic Philosophy |publisher=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H016.htm |access-date=2008-02-03}}</ref> He was also responsible for introducing the experimental method into [[mechanics]],<ref name=Rozhanskaya-642>Mariam Rozhanskaya and I.

Unlike his contemporary [[Avicenna]]'s scientific method where "general and universal questions came first and led to experimental work", al-Biruni developed scientific methods where "universals came out of practical, experimental work" and "theories are formulated after discoveries."<ref name=Sardar/> During his debate with Avicenna on [[natural philosophy]], al-Biruni made the first real distinction between a scientist and a [[philosopher]], referring to Avicenna as a philosopher and considering himself to be a mathematical scientist.<ref name=Dallal>{{citation |first=Ahmad |last=Dallal |year=2001–2002 |title=The Interplay of Science and Theology in the Fourteenth-century Kalam |publisher=From Medieval to Modern in the Islamic World, Sawyer Seminar at the [[University of Chicago]] |url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/institute/sawyer/archive/islam/dallal.html |access-date=2008-02-02}}</ref>

Al-Biruni's scientific method was similar to the modern scientific method in many ways, particularly his emphasis on repeated experimentation. Biruni was concerned with how to conceptualize and prevent both [[systematic error]]s and [[random errors]], such as "errors caused by the use of small instruments and errors made by human observers." He argued that if instruments produce random errors because of their imperfections or idiosyncratic qualities, then multiple observations must be taken, [[Qualitative research|analyzed qualitatively]], and on this basis, arrive at a "common-sense single value for the [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] sought", whether an [[arithmetic mean]] or a "reliable [[Approximation|estimate]]."<ref>{{Harvp|Glick|Livesey|Wallis|2005|pp=89–90}}</ref>

===Experimental medicine===
[[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) is considered the father of modern [[medicine]],<ref>Cas Lek Cesk (1980).

[[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-52994-8}}.</ref> in his medical encyclopedia, ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (11th century), which was the first book dealing with experimental medicine. It laid out the following rules and principles for testing the effectiveness of new [[drug]]s or [[medication]]s, which still form the basis of modern clinical trials:<ref name=Tschanz/>

#"The drug must be free from any extraneous accidental quality."
#"It must be used on a simple, not a composite, disease."
#"The drug must be tested with two contrary types of diseases, because sometimes a drug cures one disease by Its essential qualities and another by its accidental ones."
#"The quality of the drug must correspond to the strength of the disease. For example, there are some drugs whose heat is less than the coldness of certain diseases, so that they would have no effect on them."
#"The time of action must be observed, so that essence and accident are not confused."
#"The effect of the drug must be seen to occur constantly or in many cases, for if this did not happen, it was an accidental effect."
#"The experimentation must be done with the human body, for testing a drug on a lion or a horse might not prove anything about its effect on man."

===Peer review===
The first documented description of a [[peer review]] process is found in the ''Ethics of the Physician'' written by [[Ishaq bin Ali al-Rahwi]] (854–931) of [[al-Raha]], [[Syria]], who describes the first [[medical peer review]] process. His work, as well as later [[Islamic medicine|Arabic medical]] manuals, state that a visiting physician must always make duplicate notes of a patient's condition on every visit. When the patient was cured or had died, the notes of the physician were examined by a local medical council of other physicians, who would [[review]] the practising physician's notes to decide whether his/her performance have met the required standards of medical care. If their reviews were negative, the practicing physician could face a [[lawsuit]] from a maltreated patient.<ref>Ray Spier (2002), "The history of the peer-review process", ''Trends in Biotechnology'' '''20''' (8), pp. 357–58 [357].</ref>

== Other fields ==

===Epistemology===

[[Avicenna]]'s most influential theory in [[epistemology]] is his theory of knowledge, in which he developed the concept of [[tabula rasa]]. He argued that the "human intellect at birth is rather like a tabula rasa, a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know" and that knowledge is attained through "[[empirical]] familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts" which is developed through a "[[Syllogism|syllogistic]] method of [[reasoning]]; observations lead to prepositional statements, which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts."<ref>Sajjad H. Rizvi (2006), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm Avicenna/Ibn Sina (c. 980–1037)], ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''</ref>

In the 12th century, [[Ibn Tufail]] further developed the concept of tabula rasa in his [[Arabic literature|Arabic novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqzan]]'', in which he depicted the development of the mind of a [[feral child]] "from a tabula rasa to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society" on a [[desert island]]. The Latin translation of his work, entitled ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', published by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger in 1671, had an influence on [[John Locke]]'s formulation of tabula rasa in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.<ref name=Russell>{{harvp|Russell|1994|pp=224–62}}</ref>

===Eschatology===
{{main|Islamic eschatology}}
Islamic [[eschatology]] is concerned with the ''[[Qiyamah]]'' ([[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]; [[Last Judgement]]) and the [[Last Judgment|final judgement of humanity]]. [[Eschatology]] relates to one of the six articles of faith (''[[aqidah]]'') of Islam. Like the other [[Abrahamic religion]]s, Islam teaches the bodily [[resurrection]] of the dead, the fulfillment of a divine plan for creation, and the immortality of the human soul (though Jews do not necessarily view the soul as eternal); the righteous are rewarded with the pleasures of ''[[Jannah]]'' ([[Heaven]]), while the unrighteous are punished in ''[[Jahannam]]'' ([[Hell#Islam|Hell]]). A significant fraction (one third, in fact) of the Quran deals with these beliefs, with many ''[[hadith]]'' elaborating on the themes and details. Islamic apocalyptic literature describing the Armageddon is often known as ''[[Fitna (word)|fitna]]'' (a test) and ''malahim'' (or ''ghayba'' in the [[Shi'a]] tradition).

[[Ibn al-Nafis]] dealt with Islamic eschatology in some depth in his ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'', where he [[Rationality|rationalized]] the Islamic view of eschatology using reason and [[Islamic science|science]] to explain the events that would occur according to Islamic eschatology. He presented his rational and scientific arguments in the form of [[Arabic literature|Arabic fiction]], hence his ''Theologus Autodidactus'' may be considered the earliest [[science fiction]] work.<ref name="Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher">Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=2008-02-06 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'').</ref>

===Legal philosophy===
{{main|Fiqh|Sharia}}
Sharia ({{lang|ar|{{big|شَرِيعَةٌ}}}}) refers to the body of Islamic [[law]]. The term means "way" or "path"; it is the legal framework within which public and some private aspects of life are regulated for those living in a legal system based on Islamic principles of jurisprudence. Fiqh is the term for Islamic jurisprudence, made up of the rulings of Islamic jurists. A component of Islamic studies, Fiqh expounds the methodology by which Islamic law is derived from primary and secondary sources.

Mainstream Islam distinguish ''fiqh'', which means understanding details and inferences drawn by scholars, from ''sharia'' that refers to principles that lie behind the fiqh. Scholars hope that ''fiqh'' and ''sharia'' are in harmony in any given case, but they cannot be sure.<ref>On the Sources of Islamic Law and Practices, The Journal of law and religion {{issn|0748-0814}} Souaiaia 2005 vol: 20 iss:1 p:123</ref>

===Philosophical novels===
The Islamic philosophers, [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer)<ref name=Jon>Jon Mcginnis, ''Classical Arabic Philosophy: An Anthology of Sources'', p. 284, [[Hackett Publishing Company]], {{ISBN|0-87220-871-0}}.</ref> and [[Ibn al-Nafis]],<ref name=Meyerhof>Muhsin Mahdi (1974), "''The Theologus Autodidactus of Ibn at-Nafis'' by Max Meyerhof, Joseph Schacht", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''94''' (2), pp. 232–34.</ref> were pioneers of the [[philosophical novel]]. Ibn Tufail wrote the first fictional [[Arabic literature|Arabic novel]] ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''Philosophus Autodidactus'') as a response to [[al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'', and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a fictional [[novel]] ''[[Ibn al-Nafis#Theologus Autodidactus|Theologus Autodidactus]]'' as a response to Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''. Both of these novels had [[protagonist]]s (Hayy in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' and Kamil in ''Theologus Autodidactus'') who were [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]] individuals [[Abiogenesis|spontaneously generated]] in a cave and living in seclusion on a [[desert island]], both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone on the desert island for most of the story in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in ''Theologus Autodidactus'', developing into the first example of a [[science fiction]] novel.<ref name="Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher"/><ref>Nahyan A.

Ibn al-Nafis described his book ''Theologus Autodidactus'' as a defense of "the system of Islam and the Muslims' doctrines on the missions of Prophets, the religious laws, the resurrection of the body, and the transitoriness of the world." He presents rational arguments for bodily [[resurrection]] and the [[immortality]] of the human soul, using both demonstrative [[reasoning]] and material from the hadith corpus to prove his case. Later Islamic scholars viewed this work as a response to the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] claim of Avicenna and Ibn Tufail that bodily resurrection cannot be proven through reason, a view that was earlier criticized by al-Ghazali.<ref>Nahyan A. G. Fancy (2006), "Pulmonary Transit and Bodily Resurrection: The Interaction of Medicine, Philosophy and Religion in the Works of Ibn al-Nafīs (d. 1288)", pp. 42, 60, ''Electronic Theses and Dissertations'', [[University of Notre Dame]].[http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11292006-152615]</ref>

===Political philosophy===
Early Islamic [[political philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion, and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find truth—in effect ''all'' philosophy was "political" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[secularism|secular]] view and were supported by secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. The only [[Greek language|Greek]] political treatise known to medieval Muslims at the time was [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. By the end of the [[Islamic Golden Age]], however, the [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed.

Islamic political philosophy, was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of Islam, i.e. the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad. However, in the Western thought, it is generally known that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Alfarabi), [[Avicenna|İbn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace), [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes), and [[Ibn Khaldun]]. The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah, sultan, ummah, cemaa -and even the "core" terms of the Qur'an, i.e. ibada, din, rab and ilah- is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and Shia in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character.

The 14th-century [[Arab]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist [[Ernest Gellner]] considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of [[government]], "an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself", the best in the history of political theory.<ref>Ernest Gellner, ''Plough, Sword and Book'' (1988), p. 239</ref>

===Philosophy of history===
The first detailed studies on the subject of [[historiography]] and the first critiques on [[historical method]]s appeared in the works of the [[Arab]] [[Ash'ari]] polymath [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406), who is regarded as the father of [[historiography]], [[cultural history]],<ref>Mohamad Abdalla (Summer 2007). "Ibn Khaldun on the Fate of Islamic Science after the 11th Century", ''Islam & Science'' '''5''' (1), pp. 61–70.</ref> and the [[philosophy of history]], especially for his historiographical writings in the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' ([[Latin]]ized as ''Prolegomena'') and ''Kitab al-Ibar'' (''Book of Advice'').<ref>S. Ahmed (1999). ''A Dictionary of Muslim Names''. C. Hurst & Co. Publishers. {{ISBN|1-85065-356-9}}.</ref> His ''Muqaddimah'' also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[Sovereign state|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systematic bias]] in history,<ref>H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.</ref> and he discussed the rise and fall of [[civilization]]s.

[[Franz Rosenthal]] wrote in the ''History of Muslim Historiography'':

{{quote|Muslim historiography has at all times been united by the closest ties with the general development of scholarship in Islam, and the position of historical knowledge in MusIim education has exercised a decisive influence upon the intellectual level of historicai writing... The Muslims achieved a definite advance beyond previous historical writing in the [[sociology|sociological]] understanding of [[history]] and the systematisation of [[historiography]]. The development of modern historical writing seems to have gained considerably in speed and substance through the utilization of a Muslim Literature which enabled western historians, from the 17th century on, to see a large section of the world through foreign eyes. The Muslim historiography helped indirectly and modestly to shape present day historical thinking.<ref>[http://members.tripod.com/~salems2/historiography.htm "Historiography"]. The Islamic Scholar.</ref>}}

===Philosophy of religion===
There is an important question on the relation of religion and philosophy, reason and faith and so on. In one hand there is extraordinary importance attached to religion in Islamic civilization and in other hand they created certain doctrines in respect to reason and religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Akbarian،Reza|p=109|2008|Alhekmah » Winter 2008  Number 1|The Relationship Between Religion And Philosophy In The History Of Islamic Thought}}</ref>

===Social philosophy===
The social [[philosopher]] and [[Ash'ari]] polymath [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406) was the last major Islamic philosopher from [[Tunis]], North Africa. In his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', he developed the earliest theories on social philosophy, in formulating theories of [[Structural cohesion|social cohesion]] and [[social conflict]]. His ''Muqaddimah'' was also the introduction to a seven volume analysis of [[universal history]].

Ibn Khaldun is considered the "father of [[sociology]]", "father of [[historiography]]", and "father of the [[philosophy of history]]" by some, for allegedly being the first to discuss the topics of sociology, historiography and the philosophy of history in detail.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=ʻAlī|first1=Wardī|title=A sociological analysis of Ibn Khaldun's theory : a study in the sociology of knowledge|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/15127|date=1 June 1950}}</ref>

===Judeo-Islamic philosophies===
{{main|Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)}}
Islamic philosophy found an audience with the Jews, to whom belongs the honor of having transmitted it to the Christian world. A series of eminent men—such as the [[Ibn Tibbon]]s, [[Narboni]], [[Gersonides]]—joined in translating the Arabic philosophical works into Hebrew and commenting upon them. The works of Ibn Rushd especially became the subject of their study, due in great measure to Maimonides, who, in a letter addressed to his pupil [[Joseph ben Judah]], spoke in the highest terms of Ibn Rushd's commentary.

The oldest Jewish religio-philosophical work preserved in Arabic is that of [[Saadia Gaon]] (892–942), ''[[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]]'', "The Book of Beliefs and Opinions". In this work Saadia treats the questions that interested the Mutakallamin, such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc. Saadia criticizes other philosophers severely. For Saadia there was no problem as to creation: God created the world ''[[ex nihilo]]'', just as the [[Bible]] attests; and he contests the theory of the Mutakallamin in reference to atoms, which theory, he declares, is just as contrary to reason and religion as the theory of the philosophers professing the eternity of matter.

To prove the unity of God, Saadia uses the demonstrations of the Mutakallamin. Only the attributes of essence (''sifat al-dhatia'') can be ascribed to God, but not the attributes of action (''sifat-al-fi'aliya''). The soul is a substance more delicate even than that of the [[celestial spheres]]. Here Saadia controverts the Mutakallamin, who considered the soul an "accident" '''arad'' (compare [[Guide for the Perplexed]] i. 74), and employs the following one of their premises to justify his position: "Only a substance can be the substratum of an accident" (that is, of a non-essential property of things). Saadia argues: "If the soul be an accident only, it can itself have no such accidents as wisdom, joy, love," etc. Saadia was thus in every way a supporter of the Kalam; and if at times he deviated from its doctrines, it was owing to his religious views.

Since no idea and no literary or philosophical movement ever germinated on Persian or Arabian soil without leaving its impress on the Jews, [[Al-Ghazali|Al Ghazali]] found an imitator in the person of Judah ha-Levi. This poet also took upon himself to free his religion from what he saw as the shackles of speculative philosophy, and to this end wrote the "Kuzari," in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike. He passes severe censure upon the Mutakallimun for seeking to support religion by philosophy. He says, "I consider him to have attained the highest degree of perfection who is convinced of religious truths without having scrutinized them and reasoned over them" ("Kuzari," v.). Then he reduced the chief propositions of the Mutakallamin, to prove the unity of God, to ten in number, describing them at length, and concluding in these terms: "Does the [[Kalam (islamic term)|Kalam]] give us more information concerning God and His attributes than the prophet did?" (Ib. iii. and iv.) Aristotelianism finds no favor in [[Judah ha-Levi]]'s eyes, for it is no less given to details and criticism; Neoplatonism alone suited him somewhat, owing to its appeal to his poetic temperament.

Similarly the reaction in favour of stricter Aristotelianism, as found in [[Averroes]], had its Jewish counterpart in the work of [[Maimonides]]. Later Jewish philosophers, such as [[Gersonides]] and [[Elijah Delmedigo]], followed the school of Averroes and played a part in transmitting Averroist thought to medieval Europe.

In Spain and Italy, Jewish translators such as [[Abraham de Balmes]] and [[Jacob Mantino]] translated Arabic philosophic literature into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Latin]], contributing to the development of modern European philosophy.

== Later Islamic philosophy ==

The death of [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd (Averroës)]] effectively marks the end of a particular discipline of Islamic philosophy usually called the ''[[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic Arabic School]]'', and philosophical activity declined significantly in western Islamic countries, namely in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and [[North Africa]], though it persisted for much longer in the Eastern countries, in particular [[Iran]] and [[India]]. Contrary to the traditional view, [[Dimitri Gutas]] and the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] consider the period between the 11th and 14th centuries to be the true "[[Golden Age]]" of Arabic and Islamic philosophy, initiated by [[Al-Ghazali]]'s successful integration of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logic]] into the [[Madrasah]] curriculum and the subsequent rise of [[Avicennism]].<ref name=Stanford>{{cite encyclopedia |author=Tony Street |title=Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=July 23, 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arabic-islamic-language |access-date=2008-12-05}}</ref>

Since the political power shift in Western Europe ([[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) from Muslim to Christian control, the Muslims naturally did not practice philosophy in Western Europe. This also led to some loss of contact between the 'west' and the 'east' of the Islamic world. Muslims in the 'east' continued to do philosophy, as is evident from the works of [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] scholars and especially those living in Muslim kingdoms within the territories of present-day Iran and India, such as Shah Waliullah and [[Ahmad Sirhindi]]. This fact has escaped most pre-modern historians of Islamic (or Arabic) philosophy. In addition, logic has continued to be taught in religious seminaries up to modern times.

After Ibn Rushd, there arose many later schools of Islamic Philosophy such as those founded by [[Ibn Arabi]] and Shi'ite [[Mulla Sadra]]. These new schools are of particular importance, as they are still active in the Islamic world. The most important among them are:
* [[Illuminationist philosophy|School of Illumination]] (''Hikmat al-Ishraq'')
* [[Transcendent Theosophy]] (''Hikmat Muta'aliah'')
* [[Sufi philosophy]]
* [[Traditionalist School]]
* Avicennism(Hikmat Sinavi)

===Illuminationist school===
{{main|Illuminationist philosophy}}
[[Illuminationist philosophy]] was a school of Islamic philosophy founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] in the 12th century. This school is a combination of [[Avicenna]]'s philosophy and ancient [[Iranian philosophy]], with many new innovative ideas of Suhrawardi. It is often described as having been influenced by [[Neoplatonism]].

In [[logic in Islamic philosophy]], systematic refutations of [[Organon|Greek logic]] were written by the [[Illuminationist philosophy|Illuminationist school]], founded by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] (1155–1191), who developed the idea of "decisive necessity", an important innovation in the history of [[logic]]al philosophical speculation.<ref>[http://www.islamherald.com/asp/explore/science/science_muslim_scientists.asp Science and Muslim Scientists] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020090525/http://www.islamherald.com/asp/explore/science/science_muslim_scientists.asp |date=2007-10-20 }}, Islam Herald</ref>

===Transcendent school===
{{main|Transcendent theosophy}}
[[Transcendent theosophy]] is the school of Islamic philosophy founded by [[Mulla Sadra]] in the 17th century. His philosophy and [[ontology]] is considered to be just as important to Islamic philosophy as [[Martin Heidegger]]'s philosophy later was to [[Western philosophy]] in the 20th century. Mulla Sadra bought "a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of [[reality]]" and created "a major transition from [[essentialism]] to [[existentialism]]" in Islamic philosophy, several centuries before this occurred in Western philosophy.<ref name="Kamal">{{cite book |title=Mulla Sadra's Transcendent Philosophy |first=Muhammad |last=Kamal |year=2006 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=0-7546-5271-8 |pages=9, 39}}</ref>

The idea of "essence precedes existence" is a concept which dates back to [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina (Avicenna)]]<ref name="Irwin">{{Cite journal|first=Jones|last=Irwin|title=Averroes' Reason: A Medieval Tale of Christianity and Islam|date=Autumn 2002|journal=The Philosopher|volume=LXXXX|issue=2}}</ref> and his school of [[Avicennism]] as well as [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]]<ref name="Razavi 1997 129"/> and his [[Illuminationist philosophy]]. The opposite idea of "[[Existence precedes essence]]" was thus developed in the works of [[Averroes]]<ref name="Irwin"/> and [[Mulla Sadra]]<ref>{{Harvp|Razavi|1997|p=130}}</ref> as a reaction to this idea and is a key foundational concept of [[existentialism]].

For Mulla Sadra, "existence precedes the essence and is thus principle since something has to exist first and then have an essence." This is primarily the argument that lies at the heart of Mulla Sadra's [[Transcendent Theosophy]]. Sayyid Jalal Ashtiyani later summarized Mulla Sadra's concept as follows:<ref>{{Harvp|Razavi|1997|pp=129–30}}</ref>

{{quote|The existent being that has an essence must then be caused and existence that is pure existence ... is therefore a Necessary Being.}}

More careful approaches are needed in terms of thinking about philosophers (and theologians) in Islam in terms of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] methods of investigation in [[ontology]] (or onto-theology), or by way of comparisons that are made with [[Heidegger]]'s thought and his critique of the history of metaphysics.<ref>For recent studies that engage in this line of research with care and thoughtful deliberation, see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, N.Y.: Global Publications SUNY, 2000); and [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Avicenna and Essentialism', ''Review of Metaphysics'' 54 (2001), 753–78; and [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Avicenna's De Anima Between Aristotle and Husserl', in ''The Passions of the Soul in the Metamorphosis of Becoming'', ed.

The tradition of Islamic philosophy is still very much alive today, particularly among followers of [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi|Suhrawardi]]'s ''Hikmat al-Ishraq'' (''Illumination Philosophy'') and [[Mulla Sadra]]'s ''Hikmat-e-Mota'aliye'' (''Transcendent Theosophy''). Another figure is [[Muhammad Iqbal]], who reshaped and revitalized Islamic philosophy among the Muslims of the Indian sub-continent in the early 20th century.<ref>[http://www.allamaiqbal.com/ Allama Muhammad Iqbal]</ref> His ''[[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]''&nbsp;<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/works/prose/english/reconstruction/ |title = The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam}}</ref> is a milestone in the modern political philosophy of Islam.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Criticism ==
Philosophy <!--as such--> has not been without criticism amongst Muslims, both contemporary and past. The imam [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], for whom the [[Hanbali]] school of thought is named, rebuked philosophical discussion, once telling proponents of it that he was secure in his religion, but that they were "in doubt, so go to a doubter and argue with him (instead)."<ref>al-Hilyah (6/324)</ref> Today, Islamic philosophical thought has also been criticized by scholars of the modern [[Salafi]] movement.

There would be many Islamic thinkers who were not enthusiastic about its potential, but it would be incorrect to assume that they opposed philosophy simply because it was a "foreign science". [[Oliver Leaman]], an expert on Islamic philosophy, points out that the objections of notable theologians are rarely directed at philosophy itself, but rather at the conclusions the philosophers arrived at. Even the 11th century [[al-Ghazali]], known for his ''[[Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' critique of philosophers, was himself an expert in philosophy and [[logic]]. His criticism was that they arrived at theologically erroneous conclusions. In his view the three most serious of these were believing in the co-eternity of the universe with God, denying the bodily resurrection, and asserting that God only has knowledge of abstract universals, not of particular things, though not all philosophers subscribed to these same views.<ref>Leaman, O. (1999). ''A Brief Introduction to Islamic Philosophy'' Polity Press. p 21.</ref>

In recent studies by Muslim contemporary thinkers that aim at "renewing the impetus of philosophical thinking in Islam," the philosopher and theorist [[Nader El-Bizri]] offers a critical analysis of the conventions that dominate mainstream academic and epistemic approaches in studying Islamic philosophy. These approaches, of methodology and [[historiography]] are looked at from archival standpoints within Oriental and Mediaevalist Studies, fail to recognize the fact that philosophy in Islam can still be a living intellectual tradition. He maintains that its renewal requires a radical reform in [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] within Islamic thought. El-Bizri's interpretations of [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) from the standpoint of [[Heidegger]]'s critique of the history of metaphysics, and specifically against the background of the unfolding of the essence of technology, aim at finding new pathways in ontology that are not simply Avicennian nor Heideggerian, even though El-Bizri's approach in rethinking ''falsafa'' amounts to a "Neo-Avicennism" that carries resonances with novel modern philosophical ways of reading Aristotelianism and Thomism. El-Bizri engages contemporary issues in philosophy through a fundamental critical analytic of the evolution of key concepts in the history of ontology and epistemology. [[Nader El-Bizri]] is a modernist in outlook since he aims at bringing newness to the tradition rather than simply reproduce it or  being in rupture with it.<ref>[[Nader El-Bizri]], "The Labyrinth of Philosophy in Islam", in ''Comparative Philosophy'' 1.2 (2010): 3–23. Refer also to his article: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Le renouvellement de la falsafa?', ''Les Cahiers de l’Islam'' I (2014): 17–38.  See also references above in this section of the footnotes to some of [[Nader El-Bizri]]'s other related earlier studies.</ref>

==Opposition to philosophy==
Some Muslims oppose the idea of philosophy as un-Islamic. The popular Salafist website [[IslamQA.info]] (supervised by Shaykh [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid|Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid]] of [[Islam in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]]) declares philosophy to be an "alien entity": 
<blockquote>The terminology of Islamic philosophy did not emerge as a branch of knowledge that is taught in the curriculum of Islamic studies until it was introduced by Shaykh  [[Mustafa Abdel-Razek|Mustafa Abd al-Raziq]] – the [[List of Grand Imams of al-Azhar|Shaykh of al-Azhar]] – as a reaction to western attacks on Islam based on the idea that Islam has no philosophy. But the fact of the matter is that philosophy is an alien entity in the body of Islam.<ref name="islamqa">{{cite web|last1=Shaykh Saalih al-Munajjid|first1=Muhammad (General Supervisor)|title=88184: Ruling on studying philosophy. What is the ruling on studying philosophy? Please note that studying it is compulsory for us in Algeria.|url=https://islamqa.info/en/88184|website=Islam Question and Answer|access-date=27 November 2016|date=2006-12-06}}</ref> </blockquote>

The fatwa claims that "the majority of ''[[Faqīh|fuqaha’]]'' [experts in ''[[fiqh]]''] have stated that it is [[Haram|haraam]] to study philosophy, and lists some of these:
*Ibn Nujaym (Hanafi) writing in al-Ashbaah wa’l-Nazaa’im;
*al-Dardeer (Maaliki) said in al-Sharh al-Kabeer;
*Al-Dasooqi in his Haashiyah (2/174);
*Zakariya al-Ansaari (Shaafa’i) in Asna al-Mataalib (4/182);
*al-Bahooti (Hanbali) said in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’ (3/34);

IslamQA quotes  [[Al-Ghazali]] who declares that of the "four branches" of philosophy (geometry and mathematics, logic, theology, and natural sciences), some of the natural sciences "go against [[shari’ah]], Islam and truth", and that except for medicine, "there is no need for the study of nature".<ref>Al-Ghazaali ''Ihya' ulum al-din'', "Revival of Religious Sciences" (1/22)</ref><ref name="islamqa"/>

Maani’ Hammad al-Juhani, (a member of the Consultative Council and General Director, World Assembly of Muslim Youth)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UigeR5tVEoMC&q=Maani%E2%80%99+Hammad+al-Juhani%2C&pg=PA79 | title=The Islam/West Debate: Documents from a Global Debate on Terrorism, U.S.|last1=Blankenhorn | first1=David |page=79 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield.| isbn=9780742550070| year=2005}}</ref> 
is quoted as declaring that because philosophy does not follow the moral guidelines of the [[Sunnah]], 
"philosophy, as defined by the philosophers, is one of the most dangerous falsehoods and most vicious in fighting faith and religion on the basis of logic, which it is very easy to use to confuse people in the name of reason, interpretation and metaphor that distort the religious texts".<ref>''Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Muyassarah fi’l-Adyaan al-Madhaahib wa’l-Ahzaab al-Mu’aasirah''  1/419–423</ref><ref name="islamqa"/>

[[Ibn Abi al-Izz]], a commentator on [[Al-Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah|al-Tahhaawiyyah]],  condemns philosophers as the ones who "most deny the [[Islamic eschatology|Last Day]] and its events. In their view [[Jannah|Paradise]] and [[Jahannam|Hell]] are no more than parables for the masses to understand, but they have no reality beyond people’s minds."<ref name="islamqa"/>
