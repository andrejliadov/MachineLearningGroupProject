A '''philosopher''' is someone who practices [[philosophy]].  The term ''philosopher'' comes from the {{lang-grc|φιλόσοφος||translit=philosophos}}, meaning 'lover of wisdom'. The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker [[Pythagoras]] (6th century BCE).<ref name="tufts">{{LSJ|filo/sofos|φιλόσοφος|ref}}.</ref> 

In the [[Classics|classical]] sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing upon resolving [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]]; it wasn't necessary that they discoursed upon [[Theory|theories]] or commented upon authors.<ref>[[Pierre Hadot]], ''The Inner Citadel''. p. 4</ref> Those who most arduously committed themselves to this lifestyle would have been considered ''philosophers'', and they typically followed a [[Hellenistic philosophy]].

In a modern sense, a philosopher is an [[intellectual]] who contributes to one or more branches of philosophy, such as [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of science]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[social theory]], [[philosophy of religion]], and [[political philosophy]]. A philosopher may also be someone who has worked in the [[humanities]] or other sciences which over the centuries have split from philosophy, such as [[the arts]], [[history]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[theology]], and [[politics]].<ref>{{cite dictionary |editor-last1=Shook |editor-first1=John R. |dictionary=Dictionary of Modern American philosophers |chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-miscMatter-0004 |chapter-url-access=subscription |date=2010 |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780199754663 |chapter=Introduction |oclc=686766412 |quote=The label of "philosopher" has been broadly applied in this Dictionary to intellectuals who have made philosophical contributions regardless of an academic career or professional title. The wide scope of philosophical activity across the timespan of this dictionary would now be classed among the various humanities and social sciences which gradually separated from philosophy over the last one hundred and fifty years. Many figures included were not academic philosophers but did work at the philosophical foundations of such fields as pedagogy, rhetoric, the arts, history, politics, economics, sociology,turtles , psychology, linguistics, anthropology, religion, and theology. Philosophy proper is heavily represented, of course, encompassing the traditional areas of metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, logic, ethics, social/political theory, and aesthetics, along with the narrower fields of philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of law, applied ethics, philosophy of religion, and so forth}}</ref>

==History==
{{Hatnote|This section is about the history of philosophers as an occupation. For a history of philosophy in general, see [[History of philosophy]].}}

===Ancient India and the Vedas===
The first account of philosophy ''composed'' can be found in the ancient Hindu [[vedas]], written between 1500-1200 BCE (Rigveda) and circa 1200-900 BCE (Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, Atharva Veda). Before the vedas were composed, they were orally passed down from generation to generation.

The word veda means "knowledge." In the modern world, we use the term "science" to identify the kind of authoritative knowledge upon which human progress is based. In Vedic times, the primary focus of science was the eternal; human progress meant the advancement of spiritual awareness yielding the soul's release from the entrapment of material nature etc.

Vedic Philosophy provides answers to all unanswered questions i.e why there is pain and pleasure, rich and poor, healthy and sick; God - His qualities, nature and works. Soul – Its nature and qualities, souls of humans and animals; reincarnation – how does it happens, why one is born as he or she is. What is the purpose of life? What we ought to do?

Vedic knowledge comprises the four Vedas (Rig, Yajur, Sāma, and Atharva) with their numerous Samhita, 108 Upanishad, 18 Purāna, Mahabharata, several Tantra texts. The entire Vedic Philosophy is divided into six systems:

# '''[[Nyaya]]''': The Philosophy of Logic and Reasoning
# '''Vaisesika''': Essence of things
# '''[[Samkhya|Sankhya]]''': Nontheistic Dualism
# '''[[Yoga]]''': Self-Discipline for Self-Realization
# '''Mimansa''': Reflection of dharma
# '''[[Vedanta]]''': The Conclusion of the Vedic Revelation The understanding of this system involves the pragmatic knowledge of how society must be organized, how the economy should be managed, and how the political class must govern society

In short, all six schools of Vedic philosophy aim to describe the nature of the external world and its relationship to the individual, to go beyond the world of appearances to ultimate Reality, and to describe the goal of life and the means for attaining this goal.

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
The separation of philosophy and science from theology began in Greece during the 6th century BC.<ref name="RussellHistory11">{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=[https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp/page/n10 11]|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref> [[Thales]], an astronomer and mathematician, was considered by Aristotle to be the first philosopher of the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]].<ref>[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.</ref>

While [[Pythagoras]] coined the word, the first known elaboration on the topic was conducted by [[Plato]]. In his ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', he concludes that [[love]] is that which lacks the object it seeks. Therefore, the philosopher is one who seeks wisdom; if he attains wisdom, he would be a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]]. Therefore, the philosopher in antiquity was one who lives in the constant pursuit of wisdom, and living in accordance to that wisdom.<ref>That is to say philosophically – [[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 27: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson.

These disagreements gave rise to different [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic schools of philosophy]].

Citing Hadot, Dictionnaire des philosophes antiques, p. 13</ref>

Among the last of these philosophers was [[Marcus Aurelius]], who is widely regarded as a philosopher in the modern sense, but personally refused to call himself by such a title, since he had a duty to live as an [[List of Roman emperors|emperor]].<ref>[[Wikisource:Meditations#THE EIGHTH BOOK]]</ref>

====Transition====
According to the [[Classicist]] [[Pierre Hadot]], the modern conception of a philosopher and philosophy developed predominately through three changes:

The first is the natural inclination of the philosophical mind. Philosophy is a tempting discipline which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory.<ref>[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 31: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 7</ref>

The second is the historical change throughout the Medieval era. With the rise of Christianity, the philosophical way of life was adopted by its theology. Thus, philosophy was divided between a way of life and the conceptual, logical, physical, and metaphysical materials to justify that way of life. Philosophy was then the servant to theology.<ref name='Hadot32'>[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 32: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson.</ref>

The third is the sociological need with the development of the university. The modern university requires professionals to teach. Maintaining itself requires teaching future professionals to replace the current faculty. Therefore, the discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists, completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life.<ref name='Hadot32'/>

===Medieval Era===
In the fourth century, the word philosopher began to designate a man or woman who led a monastic life. [[Gregory of Nyssa]], for example, describes how his sister [[Macrina the Younger|Macrina]] persuaded [[Emmelia of Caesarea|their mother]] to forsake "the distractions of material life" for a life of philosophy.<ref>''Readings in World Christian History'' (2013), pp. 147, 149</ref>

Later during the [[Middle Ages]], persons who engaged with [[alchemy]] were called philosophers – thus, the [[Philosopher's Stone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=philosopher&allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}</ref>

===Early Modern Era===
{{rquote|right|''Generally speaking, university philosophy is mere fencing in front of a mirror. In the last analysis, its goal is to give students opinions which are to the liking of the minister who hands out the Chairs... As a result, this state-financed philosophy makes a joke of philosophy. And yet, if there is one thing desirable in this world, it is to see a ray of light fall onto the darkness of our lives, shedding some kind of light on the mysterious enigma of our existence.''|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]}}

Many philosophers still emerged from the Classical tradition, as saw their philosophy as a way of life. Among the most notable are [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. With the rise of the university, the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent. Many of the esteemed philosophers of the eighteenth century and onward have attended, taught, and developed their works in university. Early examples include: [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].<ref>[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 271: ''Philosophy as a Way of Life''</ref>

After these individuals, the Classical conception had all but died with the exceptions of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The last considerable figure in philosophy to not have followed a strict and orthodox academic regime was [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].<ref>[[A. C. Grayling]]. Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 15</ref>

===Modern Academia===
In the modern era, those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system as part of the wider professionalisation process of the discipline in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Purcell|first=Edward A.|date=1979|editor-last=Kuklick|editor-first=Bruce|title=The Professionalization of Philosophy |jstor=2700960|journal=Reviews in American History|volume=7|issue=1|pages=51–57|doi=10.2307/2700960|issn=0048-7511|url=https://digitalcommons.nyls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1297&context=fac_other_pubs}}</ref> According to a 1993 study by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (as reported by the [[American Philosophical Association]]), 77.1% of the 7,900 holders of a PhD in philosophy who responded were employed in educational institutions ([[academia]]). Outside academia, philosophers may employ their writing and reasoning skills in other careers, such as medicine{{vague|date=November 2015}}, [[bioethics]], business, publishing, [[free-lance writing]], media, and law.<ref name=APA-nonacademic>{{cite web|author=APA Committee on Non-Academic Careers|title=A non-academic career?|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?page=nonacademic|edition=3rd|date=June 1999|publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]]|accessdate=24 May 2014}}</ref>

===Key thinkers===
Some known French social thinkers are [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri Saint-Simon]], [[Auguste Comte]], and [[Émile Durkheim]]. British social thought, with thinkers such as [[Herbert Spencer]], addressed questions and ideas relating to [[political economy]] and [[social evolution]]. The political ideals of [[John Ruskin]] were a precursor of [[social economy]] (''[[Unto This Last]]'' had a very important impact on [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s philosophy). Important German philosophers and social thinkers included [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Georg Simmel]], and [[Martin Heidegger]]. Important Italian social scientists include [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Gaetano Mosca]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Franco Ferrarotti]], and [[Elena Cornaro Piscopia]].

Important Chinese philosophers and social thinkers included [[Shang Yang]], [[Lao Zi]], [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], Wang Chong<!-- Chinese name, Wang is the surname -->, [[Wang Yangming]]<!-- Chinese name, Wang is the surname -->, [[Li Zhi (philosopher)|Li Zhi]]<!-- Chinese name, Li is the surname -->, [[Zhu Xi]]<!-- Chinese name, Zhu is the surname -->, [[Gu Yanwu]]<!-- Chinese name, Gu is the surname -->, [[Gong Zizhen]]<!-- Chinese name, Gong is the surname -->, Wei Yuan<!-- Chinese name, Wei is the surname -->, [[Kang Youwei]]<!-- Chinese name, Kang is the surname -->, Lu Xun, and [[Mao Zedong]]. Indian philosophers include [[Adi Shankaracharya]], [[Ramanuja]], [[Chanakya]], [[Buddha]], [[Mahavira]], [[Śāntarakṣita]], [[Dharmakirti]], and [[Nagarjuna]].

Women have engaged in [[philosophy]] throughout the field's history. While there have been women philosophers since ancient times, and a relatively small number were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, particularly during the 20th and 21st century, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].<ref name="Duran, Jane 2005">Duran, Jane.
