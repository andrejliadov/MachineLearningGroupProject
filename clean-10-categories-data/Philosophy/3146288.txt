'''Ancient Roman philosophy''' was heavily influenced by [[Greek philosophy|the ancient Greeks]] and the schools of [[Hellenistic philosophy]]; however, unique developments in philosophical schools of thought occurred during the Roman period as well. Interest in philosophy was first excited at Rome in 155 BCE. by an Athenian embassy consisting of the [[Academic skepticism|Academic Skeptic]] [[Carneades]], the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Diogenes of Babylon]], and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] [[Critolaus]].<ref name="IEP">{{Cite web | url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/romanphi/ | title=Roman Philosophy &#124; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> 

During this time [[Athens]] declined as an intellectual center of thought while new sites such as [[Alexandria]] and [[Rome]] hosted a variety of philosophical discussion.<ref name="Annas2000">{{Cite book|last=Annas, Julia.|title=Voices of Ancient Philosophy: An Introductory Reader|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-512694-5|oclc=870243656}}</ref> 

Both leading schools of law of the Roman period, the [[Sabinian school|Sabinian]] and the [[Proculeian school|Proculean]] Schools, drew their ethical views from readings on the Stoics and Epicureans respectively,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lorenzen|first=Ernest G.|date=1925|title=Specification in the Civil Law|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=35|issue=1|pages=29–47|doi=10.2307/789534|jstor=789534|issn=0044-0094}}</ref> allowing for the competition between thought to manifest in a new field in Rome's jurisprudence. It was during this period that a common tradition of the western philosophical literature was born in commenting on the works of Aristotle.<ref name="Annas2000" />

==Characteristics==
Roman philosophy includes not only philosophy written in [[Latin]], but also philosophy written in Greek by Roman citizens. Important early Latin-language writers include [[Lucretius]], [[Cicero]], and [[Seneca the younger]]. Greek, however, was the more popular language for writing about philosophy, so much so that the Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] chose to write his ''[[Meditations]]'' in Greek. Later, with the spread of [[Christianity]] inside the Roman Empire, came the [[Christian philosophy]] of [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]]. One of the last philosophical writers of antiquity was [[Boethius]], whose writings are the chief source of information as to Greek philosophy during the first centuries of the Middle Ages.<ref name="IEP" />

While philosophers are usually categorized according to school, some philosophers of the Roman period held eclectic beliefs, taking teachings from more than one school. The Sabinian and Proculean schools of law, the two largest schools of legal thought in the Roman period, derived their understanding of ethics heavily from [[Stoicism]] and [[Epicureanism]] respectively, again providing a current for philosophical thought to influence life in the Roman period.

== History ==
While philosophy was often admired by jurists and aristocrats, of the emperors the affinity that [[Hadrian]] held for philosophy stands out, a feature that was likely amplified by his [[philhellenism]]. Hadrian was recorded to have attended lectures by Epictetus and [[Favorinus]] on his tours of Greece, and invested heavily in attempting to revive Athens as a cultural center in the ancient world through methods of central planning on his part.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lane Fox, Robin, 1946-|title=The classical world : an epic history from Homer to Hadrian|date=2006|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-02496-3|location=New York|oclc=70149306}}</ref> Hadrian held philosophy in high regard, something unusual for Roman emperors, who were often indifferent, if not oppositional to it as a practice. These sentiments in favor of philosophy were also shared by the emperors [[Nero]], [[Julian the apostate|Julian the Apostate]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]] - the latter two of which are now considered as philosophers.

During the autocratic rule of the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian Dynasty]], a group of philosophers vocally and politically protested against imperial actions, particularly under [[Domitian]] and [[Vespasian]]. This resulted in Vespasian banishing all philosophers from Rome, save for [[Gaius Musonius Rufus]]; although he, too, was later banished.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Flavian Rome : culture, image, text|others=Boyle, A. J. (Anthony James),, Dominik, William J.|year = 2003|isbn=90-04-11188-3|location=Leiden|oclc=51061501}}</ref> This event later became known as the [[Stoic Opposition]], as a majority of the protesting philosophers were Stoics. Later in the Roman period, Stoics came to regard this opposition highly; however, the term "Stoic Opposition" was not coined until the 19th century, where it first appears in the writings of [[Marie-Louis-Antoine-Gaston Boissier|Gaston Boissier]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=October 1986|author=J.
