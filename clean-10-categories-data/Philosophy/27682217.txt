The balance of '''Competing goods''' is a philosophical problem involving the acknowledgement of multiple social values that may at times conflict with one another.

The 20th-century philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] invokes [[Aristotle]] in her discussions of the problem, writing that "[T]he Aristotelian agent scrutinizes each valuable alternative, seeking out its distinct nature. She is determined to acknowledge the precise sort of value or goodness present in each of competing alternatives, seeing each value, so to speak, as a separate jewel in the crown, valuable in its own right, which does not cease to be separately valuable just because the contingencies of the situation sever it from other goods and it loses out in an overall rational choice.";<ref>{{cite book|title=The failure of corporate law: fundamental flaws and progressive possibilities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEKqN8QMONsC&pg=PA226&dq=The+failure+of+corporate+law:+fundamental+flaws+and+progressive+possibilities+competing+goods+nussbaum&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2006|page=226|ISBN=978-0-226-30693-3|author=Kent Greenfield}}</ref> and that Aristotle saw that "the values that are constitutive of a good human life are plural and incommensurable".<ref>{{cite book|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4C-maGgYk0C&pg=PA465&dq=Competing+goods+nussbaum+aristotle&hl=en&ei=03wSTPeXAcWonAevtvWRAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CE8Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=|author=James Jasinski|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]|ISBN=978-0-7619-0504-2|year=2001}}</ref> Nussbaum has argued that [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] were mistaken when they dismissed conflicts of obligation as illogical.<ref>{{cite book|title=Leading lives that matter: what we should do and who we should be|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqEMy6RbF4sC&pg=PA310&dq=%22competing+goods%22+nussbaum&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22competing%20goods%22%20nussbaum&f=false|year=2006|author=Mark R.

[[Michael Jinkins]], citing [[Isaiah Berlin]], sees both [[Plato]] and Aristotle as endorsing the concept of a singular, overwhelming social good and [[Machiavelli]]'s works as seminal discussions of competing social goods.<ref>{{cite book|title=Christianity, tolerance, and pluralism: a theological engagement with Isaiah Berlin's social theory.
