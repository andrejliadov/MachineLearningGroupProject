'''Language, Proof and Logic''' is an educational software package, devised and written by [[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Etchemendy]], geared to teaching [[formal logic]] through the use of a tight integration between a textbook (same name as the package) and four software programs, where three of them are logic related (Boole, Fitch and Tarski's World) and the other (Submit) is an internet-based grading service. The name is a [[pun]] derived from ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'', the philosophy book by [[A. J. Ayer]].

On September 2, 2014, there was launched a [[massive open online course]] (MOOC) with the same name, which utilizes this educational software package.

==Description==
A short description of the programs:

* Boole (named after [[George Boole]]) - a program that facilitates the construction and checking of truth tables and related notions ([[tautology (logic)|tautology]], tautological consequence, etc.);
* Fitch (named after [[Frederic Brenton Fitch]]) - a natural deduction proof environment in [[Fitch-style calculus]] for giving and checking first-order proofs;
* [[Tarski's World]] (named after [[Alfred Tarski]]) - a program that teaches the basic first-order language and its semantics using a model theoretic-like approach, where the "world" consists of a little grid and some simple objects;
* Submit - a program that allows students to submit exercises done with the above programs to the Grade Grinder, the online grading service.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Grim | first1 = P. | title = Language, Proof and Logic | journal = The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 377â€“379 | doi = 10.2307/2687756 | year = 2001 | jstor = 2687756 }}</ref>
