A '''shadow person''' (also known as a '''shadow figure''', '''shadow being''' or '''black mass''') is the perception of a patch of shadow as a living, humanoid figure, and, interpreted as the presence of a spirit or other entity by believers in the [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]].<ref name="Idiot's Guide">{{cite book|last=Ahlquist|first=Diane|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Life After Death|year=2007|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|location=USA|isbn=978-1-59257-651-7|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lkscwxGSoAC&pg=PA122 }}</ref>

==History and folklore==
A number of religions, legends, and belief systems describe shadowy spiritual beings or [[supernatural]] entities such as [[Shade (mythology)|shades]] of the underworld, and various shadowy creatures have long been a staple of folklore and ghost stories.

The ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' late night radio talk show helped popularize modern beliefs in shadow people.<ref name="Kinsella2011" /> The first time the topic of shadow people was discussed at length on the show was April 12, 2001 when host [[Art Bell]] interviewed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] elder Thunder Strikes, who is also known as Harley "SwiftDeer" Reagan. During the show, listeners were encouraged to submit drawings of shadow people that they had seen and a large number of these drawings were immediately shared publicly on the website.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bell|title=Art Bell - Shadow People|archivedate=September 25, 2001|url=http://artbell.com/shadows.html|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010925192530/http://www.artbell.com/shadows.html|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref> 

In October that year, Heidi Hollis published her first book on the topic of shadow people,<ref>{{cite book|author=Heidi Hollis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YyAXPQAACAAJ |title=The Secret War: The Heavens Speak of the Battle |publisher=iUniverse |date=October 1, 2001 |isbn=9780595203314}}</ref> and later became a regular guest on ''Coast to Coast''.<ref>{{cite web|title = Heidi Hollis - Guests|url = http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/hollis-heidi/5884|work = [[Coast to Coast AM]]|access-date = 2016-01-12}}</ref> Hollis describes shadow people as dark silhouettes with human shapes and profiles that flicker in and out of peripheral vision, and claims that people have reported the figures attempting to "jump on their chest and choke them".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2008/07/23 | title=Shadow People & the "Hat Man" | work=[[Coast to Coast AM]] | date=2008-03-07 | accessdate=2013-04-25}}</ref> She believes the figures to be negative, alien beings that can be repelled by various means, including invoking "the [[Holy Name of Jesus|Name of Jesus]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2006/03/27 | title=Shadow Beings | work=[[Coast to Coast AM]] | date=2006-03-27 | accessdate=2013-04-25}}</ref>

Although participants in online discussion forums devoted to [[paranormal]] and supernatural topics describe them as menacing, other believers and paranormal authors do not agree whether shadow people are either evil, helpful, or neutral, and some even speculate that shadow people may be the extra-dimensional inhabitants of another universe.<ref name="Kinsella2011">{{cite book|author=Michael Kinsella|title=Legend-Tripping Online: Supernatural Folklore and the Search for Ong's Hat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBK8Nr4edm4C&pg=PA117|accessdate=9 February 2013|date=17 May 2011|publisher=Univ.

==Scientific explanations==
Several [[physiological]] and [[psychological]] conditions can account for reported experiences of shadowy shapes seeming alive. A [[sleep paralysis]] sufferer may perceive a "shadowy or indistinct shape" approaching them when they lie awake paralyzed and become increasingly alarmed.<ref name="Adler2011">{{cite book|author=Shelley Adler|title=Sleep Paralysis: Night-mares, Nocebos, and the Mind-Body Connection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_t63WJiZb3cC&pg=PA3|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=15 January 2011|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8135-5237-8|pages=3–|quote=''In the field of sleep research, this experience is termed sleep paralysis: an individual, in the process of falling asleep or awakening, finds himself or herself completely awake, but unable to move or speak…Frequently, he or she sees a shadowy or indistinct shape approaching and becomes increasingly terrified.''}}</ref>

A person experiencing heightened emotion, such as while walking alone on a dark night, may incorrectly perceive a patch of shadow as an attacker.<ref name="OakleyMalik2011">{{cite book|author1=Clare Oakley|author2=Amit Malik|title=Rapid Psychiatry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q50UA-GUbL4C&pg=PA6|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=15 November 2011|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn=978-1-118-29418-5|pages=6–}}</ref>

Many [[methamphetamine]] addicts report the appearance of "shadow people" after prolonged periods of [[sleep deprivation]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Shadow People: How Meth-driven Crime Is Eating At the Heart of Rural America | publisher=Coalition for Investigative Journalism | author=Anderson, Scott Thomas | year=2012 | isbn=978-0615551913}}</ref><ref name="Covey2007">{{cite book|author=Herbert C.

Finally, visual hallucinations, such as those caused by schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, may appear to be shadowy figures at the edge of peripheral vision. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screening.mhanational.org/content/i-see-ghosts-or-shadows|title=I see ghosts or shadows &#124; MHA Screening - Mental Health America}}</ref>

*[[The Nightmare (2015 American film)|''The Nightmare'']] is a 2015 documentary that discusses the causes of [[sleep paralysis]] as seen through extensive interviews with participants, and the experiences are re-enacted by professional actors.
