==Life and work==

Bracha Ettinger was born in Tel Aviv on 23 March 1948.<ref>[http://errol.oclc.org/laf/no96-32063.html Library of Congress Name Authority File]</ref> She received her M.A. in [[Clinical Psychology]] from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] where she worked as research assistant then personal assistant of [[Amos Tversky]] (1969/70, 1973/74, 1974/75) and [[Danny Kahneman]] (1970/71).<ref name="EGS">{{cite web|title=Bracha Ettinger Biography |url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/bracha-ettinger/biography/ |website=egs.edu |publisher=The European Graduate School |accessdate=2 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905213057/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/bracha-ettinger/biography/ |archivedate=5 September 2015 }}</ref> She married Loni Ettinger in June 1975 and moved to London where she studied, trained and worked between 1975 and 1979 at the London Centre for Psychotherapy (with Elsa Seglow), the [[Tavistock Clinic]] and the [[Philadelphia Association]] (with [[R. D. Laing]]). Her daughter the actress Lana Ettinger,<ref>[[:fr:Lana Ettinger]]</ref><ref>[[:he:לנה אטינגר]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=August 2018}} was born in London. She returned to Israel in 1979 and worked at Shalvata Hospital. Ettinger, who has painted and drawn since early childhood, is self-taught. In her early days she avoided the art scene. In 1981 she divorced her first husband, decided to become a professional artist and moved to Paris where she lived and worked from 1981 to 2003 with her partner Joav Toker. Her son Itai Toker was born in 1988. As well as painting, drawing and photography, she began writing, and received a D.E.A. in [[Psychoanalysis]] from the [[University Paris Diderot|University Paris VII Diderot]] in 1987, and a Ph.D. in [[Aesthetics]] of Art from the [[University of Paris VIII]] in 1996.<ref name="EGS"/>

Ettinger had a solo project at the [[Pompidou Centre]] in 1987, and a solo exhibition at the Museum of Calais in 1988. In 1995 she had a solo exhibition at the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem, and in 1996 she participated in the [[Contemporary art]] section of ''Face à l'Histoire. 1933–1996'' exhibition in the [[Pompidou Centre]].<ref>''Face à l'Histoire. 1933–1996.''

Based mainly in Paris, Ettinger was visiting professor (1997–1998) and then research professor (1999–2004) in [[psychoanalysis]] and aesthetics at the School of Fine Art, History of Art and Cultural Studies at the [[University of Leeds]].<ref name="EGS"/> Since 2001 she has also been visiting professor in Psychoanalysis and Aesthetics at the AHRC Centre for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History (now CentreCATH).<ref name=CATH>AHRC Centre for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/cath/ahrc/people/fellows/ble.html AHRC B.Ettinger page].</ref> Ettinger had partly returned to Tel Aviv in 2003, and was a lecturer at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in Jerusalem until 2006.

Ettinger's art engages in the subject of trauma, mothers and women during war as well as the feminine in mythology [[Eurydice]], [[Medusa]], [[Demeter]], [[Persephone]]. Her abstract research in painting concerns light and space, and in this it follows from [[Monet]] and [[Rothko]].<ref>Manning, Erin, Manning, Erin.

From 1981 until 1992, Ettinger's principal artwork consisted of drawing and mixed media on paper as well as notebooks and artist's books, where alongside theoretical work and conversations she made ink and wash painting and drawing. Since 1992, apart from her notebooks, most of her artwork consists of mixed media and oil paintings, with few parallel series that spread over time like: "Matrix — Family Album", "Autistwork" and "Eurydice", with themes of generational transmission of memory, personal and historical trauma, the Shoah and the World Wars,<ref>[[Griselda Pollock]], Between painting and the Digital, in: ''Bracha L.

</ref> Ettinger has become one of the major artists of the [[New European Painting]]. Along with painting she has worked on installations, theoretical research, lectures, video works, and "encounter events". Her paintings, photos, drawings, and notebooks have been exhibited at the [[Pompidou Centre]] (1987, 1996, 2010<ref>{{cite web|title=Ettinger|url=http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?x=0&y=0&s=ettinger\website=centrepompidou.fr|publisher=Pompidou Centre|accessdate=3 September 2015}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>–2011), and the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in 1997. In the last decade, Ettinger's oil on canvas paintings involve figures like Medusa, Demeter and Persephone, and Eurydice. Though from 2010 onward her work still consists mainly of oil paintings and drawings, she is also doing new media animated video-films where the images are multi-layered like her painting. In 2015, Ettinger participated with a solo show in the 14th [[Istanbul Biennial]] drafted and curated by [[Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pavilion Istanbul in/+Leeds Part 3|url=http://www.pavilion.org.uk/events/2015/Bracha-Ettinger/|website=pavilion.org.uk|publisher=Pavilion|accessdate=3 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919211303/http://www.pavilion.org.uk/events/2015/Bracha-Ettinger/|archive-date=19 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2018-2019 she participated with a solo show at the [[Kochi-Muziris Biennale 2018]] in India.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnqavDADWa0</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mpuiAeVNds</ref>

==Psychoanalyst==
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2015}}
{{Technical|section|date=April 2017}}

Ettinger is a theoretician who proposed an [[ontology]] of string-like subject-subject (trans-subjective) and subject-object (transjective) transmissivity for a rethinking of the human subject. Working at the intersections of human [[subjectivity]], [[Human female sexuality|feminine sexuality]], maternal subjectivity, [[psychoanalysis]], [[art]] and [[aesthetics]], she contributed to psychoanalysis the idea of a feminine-maternal sphere, function, and structure with its symbolic and imaginary dimensions based on femaleness in the real (womb). This dimension, as symbolic, contributes to ethical thinking about human responsibility to one another and to the world. She is a senior clinical psychologist, and a practising psychoanalyst. Her artistic practice and her articulation, since 1985, of what has become known as the matrixial theory of trans-subjectivity have transformed contemporary debates in contemporary art, psychoanalysis, women's studies, and cultural studies. Ettinger was an analysand of [[Ronald Laing]] in London and [[Piera Aulagnier]] in Paris. She is member of the Tel Aviv Institute for Contemporary Psychoanalysis (TAICP),<ref>{{cite web|title=Members of the Institute|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=iw&u=http://www.taicp.org.il/&prev=search|website=taicp.org|publisher=TAICP|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> the New Lacanian School (NLS) and the [[World Association of Psychoanalysis]] (AMP / WAP).<ref>[http://www.wapol.org/en/index.html# World Association of Psychoanalysis]</ref> For Ettinger, the Freudian attitude to psychoanalysis is crucial as it emphasizes the phantasmatic value of materials that arise during regression. To Freud and Lacan she adds, however, a feminine-maternal space-time with its particular structures, functions, and dynamics in the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]. She claims that, in a similar way, when seduction is assigned to the paternal figure during regression, it is recognized in most cases as a result of the therapeutic process itself. It is worked-through accordingly without therapist's father-blaming, and without a resulting father-hate. Therapists must likewise realize that during regression phantasmatic maternal "not-enoughness" appears and must also be recognized as the result of the process itself, and be worked-through without the mother-hating that Ettinger considers contributes to a "psychotization" of the subject, and a block to the passage from rage to sorrow and compassion. To be able to recognize the phantasmatic status of the psychic material arising during therapy, the Lacanian concepts of Symbolic, Imaginary and Real are useful to her.

The idea of a corpo-Real is a part of her symbolization of a new feminine psychic zone (the matrixial, the womb as time space of psychic encounter-event), in both male and female subjects, and of the feminine-matrixial sexual difference. Thus, even if Ettinger critiques the Freudian and Lacanian analysis of the feminine, she considers herself as a "post" or "neo" Freudian and Lacanian, who elaborates the feminine in continuity to these psychoanalysts, but claims a supplementary feminine-maternal Eros. Ettinger criticises Winnicott and Bollas for offering patients a "ready-made mother-monster" as a cause for each psychic pain. She considers any practice of archaic-motherhood blaming as an obstacle, as "hystericizing" and even momentarily "psychoticizing" (in the sense of leading to internal splits rather than recognition of differences,) when such "cause" is brought as "explanation" by the analyst, a "cause" attributed to the unremembered early period of life where I and non-I are transconnected. Ettinger agrees with Lacan that the "ultimate" cause is in principle lacking: ''objet a''. She calls for a delicate process of differentiation, coemergence, and cofading between the generations, especially in analysing the same-sex (daughter-mother, son-father) relationships, with emphasize on transmission, not split. Thus, the process itself helps to negotiate and articulate delicately sexual difference, in the present. To the idea that the self is structured via mirror-like reflection she adds that of primal [[apperception]] of the other, through "fascinance" (aesthetic openness to the other and the cosmos), compassion and awe (affective accesses to the other) directed from the beginning to the (m)Other and the outside, not to the self.

===Psychoanalytic theory===

====Major concepts====
Ettinger invented the Matrixial Trans-subjectivity theory, or simply "[[The Matrixial]]", with concepts like border linking, borderspacing, martial borderspace, copoiesis, wit(h)messing and co/in-habit(u)ation.<ref>Bracha L. Ettinger, "Matrixial Trans-subjectivity" in: ''Problematizing Global Knowledge''. Theory, Culture and Society, Volum 23, Numbers 2–3, 2006.ISSN 0263-2764</ref><ref>“Carriance, Copoiesis and the Subreal.” In: ''Saltwater. Theory of Thought Forms''. 14th Istanbul Biennial Catalogue. Edited by Carolyn Christov Bokargiev, 2015. Printed also in: Bracha L. Ettinger. A α א And My Heart Wound-Space.</ref> Ettinger is a [[Freud]]ian and Lacanian scholar and follows the late [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[object relations theory]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]]/[[Félix Guattari]].

====The early theory: from 1985 through the 1990s====
Ettinger articulated a feminine-maternal and feminine-prematernal dimension, space, function, Eros and dynamics in the human Unconscious. She had suggested that pre-natal impressions, connected to the phantasmatic and traumatic real of the pregnant becoming-mother, are trans-inscribed in the emerging subject and form the primary phase and position of the human psyche. "I" and "non-I", without rejection and without symbiotic fusion, conjointly inscribe memory traces that are dispersed asymmetrically but in a trans-subjective mode. Trans-subjective mental and affective unconscious "strings", connecting the prenatal emerging subject to the archaic m/Other, open unconscious routes ("feminine", non phallic, in both males and females) that enable subjectivizing processes all throughout life whenever a new matrixial encounter-event takes place. The matrixial encounter-event forms specific aesthetical and ethical accesses to the Other. Ettinger articulated the 'matrixial gaze' and the process of 'co-poiesis'. This allows new understanding of trans-generational transmission, trauma and artistic processes. Ettinger formulates the woman(girl)-to-woman(mother) difference as the first sexual difference for females to be viewed first of all according to the matrixial parameters. The feminie-maternal Eros informs also the father/son and mother/son relations. According to Ettinger, in parallel but also before expressions of abjection ([[Julia Kristeva]]) or rejection (Freud on Narcissism) of the other, primary compassion, awe and fascinance (which are unconscious psychic affective accesses to the other, and which join reattunement and differentiating-in-jointness by borderlinking) occur. The combination of fascinance and primary compassion does not enter the economy of social exchange, attraction and rejection; it has particular forms of Eros and of resistance that can inspire the political sphere and reach action and speech that is ethical-political without entering any political institutional organization. The infant's primary compassion is a proto-ethical psychological means that joins the aesthetical fascinance and creates a feel-knowing that functions at best within maternal (and also parental) compassionate hospitality. Here, one witnesses in jointness: The I wit(h)ness while borderlinking (bordurelaint) to the non-I and borderspacing (bordurespacant) from the other. Ettinger calls for the recognition of the matrixial transference as a dimension in the transferential relationships in psychoanalysis. They must entails besideness to (and not a split from) the archaic the m/Other (Autremere) and parental figures; jointness-in-differentiation rather than their exclusion. She sees in the trans-subjectivity a distinct dimension of human specific linkage and shareability, different from, and supplementary to "inter-subjectivity" and "self" psychology. Her most prominent and comprehensive book regarding this theory is "The Matrixial Borderspace" (reprint of essays from 1994–1999) published in French in 1999<ref>''Regard et Espace-de-bord matrixiels''. La lettre volee. {{ISBN|2-87317-102-2}}.</ref> and in English in 2006,<ref name=Borderspace>''The Matrixial Borderspace'', University of Minnesota Press 2006, edited by [[Brian Massumi]] and forwarded by [[Judith Butler]] and Griselda Pollock. {{ISBN|0-8166-3587-0}} [http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/E/ettinger_matrixial.html Upress relevant page].</ref> but her most recent concepts are mainly elaborated in the different essays printed in 2005–2006.<ref>Mainly: "From Proto-ethical Compassion to Responsibility", "Fascinance" and "Com-passionate Co-response-ability, Initiation in Jointness, and the link x of Matrixial Virtuality". All published in 2006 — see list of recent publications.</ref>

====The theory in the 2000s====
Her more recent artistic and theoretical work centers around the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] in [[art]] and [[ethics]]. In the domain of psychoanalysis, around the question of same-sex differences, the primary feminine difference is the difference opened between woman (girl) and woman (m/Other), maternal subjectivity, maternal/pregnance Eros of com-passion, the effects of compassion and awe and the passion for borderlinking and borderspacing<ref>Bracha L. Ettinger, "Diotima and the Matrixial Transference: Psychoanalytical Encounter-Event as Pregnancy in Beauty." In: Van der Merwe, Chris N., and Viljoen, Hein, eds. Across the Threshold: Explorations of Liminality in Literature. New York: Peter Lang & Potchefstroom: Literator, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4331-0002-9}}</ref> and the idea that three kinds of fantasy (that she names Mother-fantasies) should be recognized, when they appear in a state of regression aroused by therapy itself, as primal: Mother-fantasies of Not-enoughness, Devouring and Abandonment. Their mis-recognition in psychoanalysis (and analytical therapy), together with the ignorance of maternal Eros of com-passion leads to catastrophic blows to the matrixial daughter-mother tissue and hurts the maternal potentiality of the daughter herself, in the sense that attacking the "non-I" is always also attacking the "I" that dwells inside an "I"-and-"non-I" trans-subjective matrixial (feminine-maternal) tissue. Contributing to Self psychoanalysis after [[Heinz Kohut]], Ettinger articulated the difference between com-passionate borderlinking, compassion (as affect) and empathy, and between "empathy without compassion" and "empathy within compassion", claiming that the analyst's empathy without compassion harms the matrixial psychic tissue of the analysand, while empathy within compassion leads to creativity and to the broadening of the ethical horizon. Ettinger explains how by empathy (toward the patient's complaints) ''without'' compassion (toward the patient's surrounding past and present family figures, no less than toward the patient itself), the therapist "produces" the patient's real mother as a "ready-made monster-mother" figure, that serves to absorb complaints of all kinds, and thus, a dangerous splitting is induced between the "good" mother figure (the therapist) and a "bad" mother figure (the real mother). This splitting is destructive in both internal and external terms, and mainly for the daughter-mother relations, since the I and non-I are in any case always trans-connected, and therefore any split and projected hate (toward such figures) will turn into a self-hate in the woman/daughter web. Such a concept of subjectivity, where "non-I" is trans-connected to the "I", has deep ethical implications<ref>Bracha L. Ettinger, "From Proto-ethical Compassion to Responsibility: Besideness, and the three Primal Mother-Phantasies of Not-enoughness, Devouring and Abandonment". In: ''Athena: Philosophical Studies''. Vol. 2 (Vilnius: Versus). 2006. 100–135. ISSN 1822-5047.</ref> as well as far-reaching sociological and political implications that have been further developed by [[Griselda Pollock]] in order to rethink [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern art]] and History. Ettinger's recent theoretical proposals starting around 2008 include the three Shocks of maternality and the paternal infnticide impulses (Laius Complex)<ref>Bracha L.
