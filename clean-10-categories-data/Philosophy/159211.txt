'''Analytic philosophy''' is a branch and tradition of [[philosophy]] using [[philosophical analysis|analysis]] which is popular in the [[Western world|Western World]] and particularly the [[Anglosphere]], which began around the turn of the [[20th century]] in the [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary era]] and continues today. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Scandinavia]], the majority of university philosophy departments today identify themselves as "analytic" departments.<ref name="Searle03P1">
"Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the analytic tradition—such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism, existentialism, or Marxism—feel it necessary to define their position in relation to analytic philosophy." [[John Searle]] (2003), ''Contemporary Philosophy in the United States'' in N. Bunnin and E. P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed., (Blackwell, 2003), p. 1.</ref>

Central figures in this historical development of analytic philosophy are [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Other important figures in its history include the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] (particularly [[Rudolf Carnap]]), [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]], [[Saul Kripke]], and [[Karl Popper]].

Analytic philosophy is characterized by an emphasis on [[language]], known as the [[linguistic turn]], and for its clarity and rigor in arguments, making use of [[formal logic]] and [[mathematics]], and, to a lesser degree, the [[natural sciences]].<ref name="LeiterWeb">[[Brian Leiter]] (2006) webpage [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115002425/https://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp ''"Analytic" and "Continental" Philosophy'']<!-- https://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic-and-continental-philosophy/ -->. Quote on the definition: "'Analytic' philosophy today names a ''style'' of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set of substantive views. Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the sciences and mathematics, than with the humanities."</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Glock|first1=H.J.|year=2004|title=Was Wittgenstein an Analytic Philosopher?|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=35|issue=4|pages=419–444|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.2004.00329.x}}</ref><ref>Colin McGinn, ''The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey through Twentieth-Century Philosophy'' (HarperCollins, 2002), p. xi.: "analytical philosophy [is] too narrow a label, since [it] is not generally a matter of taking a word or concept and analyzing it (whatever exactly that might be). [...] This tradition emphasizes clarity, rigor, argument, theory, truth. It is not a tradition that aims primarily for inspiration or consolation or ideology. Nor is it particularly concerned with 'philosophy of life,' though parts of it are. This kind of philosophy is more like science than religion, more like mathematics than poetry—though it is neither science nor mathematics."</ref> It also takes things piecemeal, "an attempt to focus philosophical reflection on smaller problems that lead to answers to bigger questions."<ref>See, e.g., Avrum Stroll, ''Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy'' (Columbia University Press, 2000), p. 5: "[I]t is difficult to give a precise definition of 'analytic philosophy' since it is not so much a specific doctrine as a loose concatenation of approaches to problems." Also, see Stroll (2000), p. 7: "I think Sluga is right in saying 'it may be hopeless to try to determine the essence of analytic philosophy.' Nearly every proposed definition has been challenged by some scholar. [...] [W]e are dealing with a family resemblance concept."</ref><ref>See [[Hans-Johann Glock]], ''What Is Analytic Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 205: "The answer to the title question, then, is that analytic philosophy is a tradition held together ''both'' by ties of mutual influence ''and'' by family resemblances."</ref>

Analytic philosophy is often understood in contrast to other philosophical traditions, most notably [[continental philosophy|continental philosophies]] such as [[existentialism]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and [[Hegelianism]].<ref>[[A.C. Grayling]] (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 2: "Analytic philosophy is mainly associated with the contemporary English-speaking world, but it is by no means the only important philosophical tradition. In this volume two other immensely rich and important such traditions are introduced: Indian philosophy, and philosophical thought in Europe from the time of Hegel." L.J. Cohen, ''The Dialogue of Reason: An Analysis of Analytical Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1986), p. 5: "So, despite a few overlaps, analytical philosophy is not difficult to distinguish broadly [...] from other modern movements, like phenomenology, say, or existentialism, or from the large amount of philosophizing that has also gone on in the present century within frameworks deriving from other influential thinkers like Aquinas, Hegel, or Marx." H.-J. Glock, ''What Is Analytic Philosophy?'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 86: "Most non-analytic philosophers of the twentieth century do not belong to continental philosophy."</ref>

==History<!--'History of analytic philosophy', 'History of Analytic philosophy', 'History of analytical philosophy', and 'History of Analytical philosophy' redirect here-->==
The '''history of analytic philosophy'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (taken in the narrower sense of "[[20th-century philosophy|20th-]]/[[21st-century philosophy|21st-century]] analytic philosophy") is usually thought to begin with the rejection of [[British idealism]], a [[neo-Hegelian]] movement.<ref>Michael Beaney (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of The History of Analytic Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 383.</ref>

British idealism as taught by philosophers such as [[F. H. Bradley]] (1846–1924) and [[T. H. Green]] (1836–1882), dominated English philosophy in the late 19th century. Since its beginning, a basic goal of analytic philosophy has been conceptual clarity,<ref name="PenguinDicP22">Mautner, Thomas (editor) (2005) ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'', entry for "Analytic philosophy", pp. 22–23</ref> in the name of which Moore and Russell rejected [[Hegelianism]] for being obscure—see for example Moore's "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]" and Russell's critique of the [[doctrine of internal relations]].<ref>"Analytic philosophy opposed right from its beginning English neo-Hegelianism of Bradley's sort and similar ones. It did not only criticize the latter's denial of the existence of an external world (anyway an unjust criticism), but also the bombastic, obscure style of Hegel's writings." {{cite journal|last=Jonkers |first=Peter |year=2003 |title=Perspectives on Twentieth Century Philosophy: A Reply to Tom Rockmore |journal=[[Ars Disputandi]] |volume=3 |doi=10.1080/15665399.2003.10819802 |s2cid=70060684 |issn=1566-5399 |url=http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000129/article.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128165848/http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000129/article.pdf |archive-date=2007-11-28 }}</ref> Inspired by developments in modern [[formal logic]], the early Russell claimed that the problems of philosophy can be solved by showing the simple constituents of complex notions.<ref name="PenguinDicP22"/> An important aspect of British idealism was [[logical holism]]—the opinion that there are aspects of the world that can be known only by knowing the whole world. This is closely related to the opinion that [[Property (philosophy)#Relations|relations]] between items are ''internal relations'', that is, [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of the nature of those items. Russell, along with Wittgenstein, in response promulgated [[logical atomism]] and the doctrine of ''external relations''—the belief that the world consists of ''independent'' facts.<ref>Baillie, James, "Introduction to Bertrand Russell" in ''Contemporary Analytic Philosophy, Second Edition'' (Prentice Hall, 1997), p. 25.</ref>

Russell, during his early career, along with his collaborator [[Alfred North Whitehead]], was much influenced by [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925), who developed [[predicate logic]], which allowed a much greater range of sentences to be parsed into logical form than was possible using the ancient [[Aristotelian logic]]. Frege was also influential as a [[philosophy of mathematics|philosopher of mathematics]] in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. In contrast to [[Edmund Husserl]]'s 1891 book ''Philosophie der Arithmetik'', which argued that the concept of the [[cardinal number]] derived from psychical acts of grouping objects and counting them,<ref>{{cite journal |author= Willard, Dallas|title= Husserl on a Logic that Failed|journal= Philosophical Review|pages= 52–53|volume= 89|issue= 1|doi= 10.2307/2184863|jstor= 2184863|year= 1980}}</ref> Frege argued that mathematics and logic have their own validity, independent of the judgments or mental states of individual mathematicians and logicians (which were the basis of arithmetic according to the "[[psychologism]]" of Husserl's ''Philosophie''). Frege further developed his philosophy of logic and mathematics in ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' (1884) and ''The Basic Laws of Arithmetic'' ({{lang-de|Grundgesetze der Arithmetik}}, 1893–1903), where he provided an alternative to psychologistic accounts of the concept of number.

Like Frege, Russell argued that mathematics is reducible to logical fundamentals in ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903). Later, his book written with Whitehead, ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–1913), encouraged many philosophers to renew their interest in the development of [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]]. Additionally, Russell adopted Frege's predicate logic as his primary philosophical method, a method Russell thought could expose the underlying structure of philosophical problems. For example, the English word [[to be|"is"]] has three distinct meanings which predicate logic can express as follows:
* For the sentence 'the cat ''is'' asleep', the ''is'' of [[Predication (philosophy)|predication]] means that "x is P" (denoted as P(x)).
* For the sentence 'there ''is'' a cat', the ''is'' of existence means that "there is an x" (∃x).
* For the sentence 'three ''is'' half of six', the ''is'' of identity means that "x is the same as y" (x=y).

Russell sought to resolve various philosophical problems by applying such logical distinctions, most famously in his analysis of [[definite description]]s in "[[On Denoting]]" (1905).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|year=1905|title=On Denoting|journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]|volume=14|pages=473–493|url=http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/anglica/Chronology/20thC/Russell/rus_deno.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331212120/http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/anglica/Chronology/20thC/Russell/rus_deno.html|archive-date=2006-03-31}}</ref>

===Ideal language <!--Linked from 'Ludwig Wittgenstein', 'Template:Wittgenstein' and 'Linguistic philosophy'-->===
{{main|Ideal language philosophy}}
From about 1910 to 1930, analytic philosophers like Russell and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] emphasized creating an ideal language for philosophical analysis, which would be free from the ambiguities of ordinary language that, in their opinion, often made philosophy invalid. During this phase, Russell and Wittgenstein sought to understand language (and hence philosophical problems) by using [[Formal logic|logic]] to formalize how philosophical [[statement (logic)|statements]] are made.

=== Logical atomism ===
Russell became an advocate of [[logical atomism]]. Wittgenstein developed a comprehensive system of logical atomism in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' ({{lang-de | Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung}}, 1921). He thereby argued that the universe is the totality of actual states of affairs and that these states of affairs can be expressed by the language of first-order predicate logic. Thus a ''picture'' of the universe can be construed by expressing facts in the form of atomic propositions and linking them using [[logical operator]]s.

===Logical positivism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
During the late 1920s to 1940s, a group of philosophers of the [[Vienna Circle]] and the [[Berlin Circle]] developed Russell and Wittgenstein's formalism into a doctrine known as "[[logical positivism]]" (or logical empiricism). Logical positivism used formal logical methods to develop an empiricist account of knowledge.<ref>{{cite book |author= Carnap, R.|title= The Logical Structure of the World|publisher= Felix Meiner Verlag|year= 1928|lccn= 66013604|isbn= 978-0-8126-9523-6}}</ref> Philosophers such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Hans Reichenbach]], along with other members of the Vienna Circle, claimed that the truths of logic and mathematics were [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and those of science were verifiable empirical claims. These two constituted the entire universe of meaningful judgments; anything else was nonsense. The claims of ethics, aesthetics, and theology were consequently reduced to pseudo-statements, neither empirically true nor false and therefore meaningless. In reaction to what he considered excesses of logical positivism, [[Karl Popper]] insisted on the role of [[falsifiability|falsification]] in the philosophy of science—although his general method was also part of the analytic tradition.<ref>{{cite book |author= Popper, Karl R.|title= The Logic of Scientific Discovery|publisher= Routledge|year= 2002 | isbn= 978-0-415-27844-7 }}</ref> With the coming to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]] in 1933, many members of the Vienna and Berlin Circles fled to Britain and the US, which helped to reinforce the dominance of logical positivism and analytic philosophy in anglophone countries.

Logical positivists typically considered philosophy as having a minimal function. For them, philosophy concerned the clarification of thoughts, rather than having a distinct subject matter of its own. The positivists adopted the [[verification principle]], according to which every meaningful statement is either [[Analytic proposition|analytic]] or is capable of being verified by experience. This caused the logical positivists to reject many traditional problems of philosophy, especially those of [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]], as meaningless.

===Ordinary language ===
{{Main|Ordinary language philosophy}}

After [[World War II]], during the late 1940s and 1950s, analytic philosophy became involved with ordinary-language analysis. This resulted in two main trends. One continued Wittgenstein's later philosophy, which differed dramatically from his early work of the ''Tractatus''. The other, known as [[Ordinary-language philosophy|"Oxford philosophy"]], involved [[J. L. Austin]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Longworth|first=Guy|title=John Langshaw Austin|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2020/entries/austin-jl/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2020|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-07-21}}.</ref> In contrast to earlier analytic philosophers (including the early Wittgenstein) who thought philosophers should avoid the deceptive trappings of natural language by constructing ideal languages, ordinary-language philosophers claimed that ordinary language already represents many subtle distinctions not recognized in the formulation of traditional philosophical theories or problems. While schools such as logical positivism emphasize logical terms, supposed to be universal and separate from contingent factors (such as culture, language, historical conditions), ordinary-language philosophy emphasizes the use of language by ordinary people. The most prominent ordinary-language philosophers during the 1950s were the aforementioned Austin and [[Gilbert Ryle]].

Ordinary-language philosophers often sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing them to be the result of ordinary misunderstanding language. Examples include Ryle, who tried to dispose of "[[Ghost in the machine|Descartes' myth]]", and Wittgenstein.

==Contemporary analytic philosophy==
Although contemporary philosophers who self-identify as "analytic" have widely divergent interests, assumptions, and methods—and have often rejected the fundamental premises that defined analytic philosophy before 1960—analytic philosophy today is usually considered to be determined by a particular style,<ref name="LeiterWeb"/> characterized by precision and thoroughness about a specific topic, and resistance to "imprecise or cavalier discussions of broad topics".<ref name="autogenerated3" />

During the 1950s, logical positivism was challenged influentially by Wittgenstein in the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] in "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", and Sellars in ''[[Wilfrid Sellars|Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind]]''. After 1960, anglophone philosophy began to incorporate a wider range of interests, opinions, and methods.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> Still, many philosophers in Britain and America still consider themselves "analytic philosophers".<ref name="Searle03P1"/><ref name="LeiterWeb"/> They have done so largely by expanding the notion of "analytic philosophy" from the specific programs that dominated anglophone philosophy before 1960 to a much more general notion of an "analytic" style.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/analytic.htm |title=Analytic Philosophy Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |access-date=2018-04-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703212901/http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/analytic.htm |archive-date=2009-07-03 }}</ref>

Many philosophers and historians have attempted to define or describe analytic philosophy. Those definitions often include an emphasis on conceptual analysis: [[A.P. Martinich]] draws an analogy between analytic philosophy's interest in conceptual analysis and analytic chemistry, which aims to determine chemical compositions.<ref>{{cite book|title=A companion to analytic philosophy|url=https://archive.org/details/companiontoanaly00mart_918|url-access=limited|publisher=Blackwell|year=2001|isbn=978-0-631-21415-1|editor=[[A.P. Martinich]]|location=Malden, MA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/companiontoanaly00mart_918/page/n10 1]–5|doi=10.1002/9780470998656.ch1}}</ref> Steven D. Hales described analytic philosophy as one of three types of philosophical method practiced in the West: "[i]n roughly reverse order by number of proponents, they are phenomenology, ideological philosophy, and analytic philosophy".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hales|first=Steven D.|title=Analytic philosophy : classic readings|year=2002|publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-534-51277-4|pages=1–10}}</ref>

[[Scott Soames]] agrees that clarity is important: analytic philosophy, he says, has "an implicit commitment—albeit faltering and imperfect—to the ideals of clarity, rigor and argumentation" and it "aims at truth and knowledge, as opposed to moral or spiritual improvement [...] the goal in analytic philosophy is to discover what is true, not to provide a useful recipe for living one's life". Soames also states that analytic philosophy is characterized by "a more piecemeal approach. There is, I think, a widespread presumption within the tradition that it is often possible to make philosophical progress by intensively investigating a small, circumscribed range of philosophical issues while holding broader, systematic questions in abeyance".<ref name=Soames>{{cite book |last=Soames|first=Scott|title=The dawn of analysis|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-11573-3|pages=xiii–xvii|edition=2nd print., 1st papers. print.}}</ref>

A few of the most important and active topics and subtopics of analytic philosophy are summarized by the following sections.

===Philosophy of mind and cognitive science===

Motivated by the logical positivists' interest in verificationism, [[logical behaviorism]] was the most prominent [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]] of analytic philosophy for the first half of the 20th century.<ref>Graham, George, "Behaviorism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/behaviorism/]</ref> Behaviorists tended to opine either that statements about the mind were equivalent to ''statements about'' behavior and dispositions to behave in particular ways or that mental states were directly equivalent to behavior and dispositions to behave. Behaviorism later became much less popular, in favor of [[Identity theory of mind|type physicalism]] or [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], theories that identified mental states with brain states. During this period, topics of the philosophy of mind were often related strongly to topics of [[cognitive science]] such as [[modularity of mind|modularity]] or [[Psychological nativism|innateness]]. Finally, analytic philosophy has featured a certain number of philosophers who were [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualists]], and recently forms of property dualism have had a resurgence; the most prominent representative  is [[David Chalmers]].<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=dualism |title=Dualism}}</ref>

[[John Searle]] suggests that the obsession with the philosophy of language during the 20th century has been superseded by an emphasis on the [[philosophy of mind]],<ref>Postrel and Feser, February 2000, ''Reality Principles: An Interview with John R. Searle'' at {{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/27599.html |title=Reality Principles: An Interview with John R.

In recent years, a central focus of research in the philosophy of mind has been [[consciousness]]. While there is a general consensus for the global neuronal workspace model of consciousness,<ref>{{Cite journal

===Ethics in analytic philosophy===

Due to the commitments to [[empiricism]] and [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]] in the early analytic period, early analytic philosophers often thought that inquiry in the ethical domain could not be made rigorous enough to merit any attention.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lK6DTadnaQC&q=%22analytic+philosophy%22+ethics&pg=PT213|title=A Brief History of Analytic Philosophy: From Russell to Rawls|last=Schwartz|first=Stephen P.|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-27172-8|language=en}}</ref> It was only with the emergence of ordinary language philosophers that ethics started to become an acceptable area of inquiry for analytic philosophers.<ref name=":0" /> Philosophers working with the analytic tradition have gradually come to distinguish three major types of moral philosophy.
* [[Meta-ethics]] which investigates moral terms and concepts;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Key Terms in Ethics|last=Kuusela|first=Oskari|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4411-6610-4|location=London|pages=61}}</ref>
* [[Normative ethics]] which examines and produces normative ethical judgments;
* [[Applied ethics]], which investigates how existing normative principles should be applied to difficult or borderline cases, often cases created by new technology or new scientific knowledge.

====Meta-ethics====
Twentieth-century meta-ethics has two origins. The first is G.E. Moore's investigation into the nature of ethical terms (e.g., good) in his ''Principia Ethica'' (1903), which identified the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. Along with Hume's famous is/ought distinction, the naturalistic fallacy was a major topic of investigation for analytical philosophers.

The second is in logical positivism and its attitude that unverifiable statements are meaningless. Although that attitude was adopted originally to promote scientific investigation by rejecting grand metaphysical systems, it had the side effect of making (ethical and aesthetic) value judgments (as well as religious statements and beliefs) meaningless. But because value judgments are of significant importance in human life, it became incumbent on logical positivism to develop an explanation of the nature and meaning of value judgments. As a result, analytic philosophers avoided normative ethics and instead began [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] investigations into the nature of moral terms, statements, and judgments.

The [[logical positivist]]s opined that statements about [[Value (ethics)|value]]—including all ethical and aesthetic judgments—are [[non-cognitivism|non-cognitive]]; that is, they cannot be objectively verified or falsified. Instead, the logical positivists adopted an [[emotivism|emotivist]] theory, which was that value judgments expressed the attitude of the speaker. For example, in this view, saying, "Killing is wrong", is equivalent to saying, "Boo to murder", or saying the word "murder" with a particular tone of disapproval.

While analytic philosophers generally accepted non-cognitivism, emotivism had many deficiencies. It evolved into more sophisticated non-cognitivist theories such as the [[expressivism]] of [[Charles Stevenson]], and the [[universal prescriptivism]] of [[R.M. Hare]], which was based on J.L. Austin's philosophy of [[speech acts]].

These theories were not without their critics. [[Philippa Foot]] contributed several essays attacking all these theories. [[J.O. Urmson]]'s article "On Grading" called the is/ought distinction into question.

As non-cognitivism, the is/ought distinction, and the naturalistic fallacy began to be called into question, analytic philosophers showed a renewed interest in the traditional questions of moral philosophy. Perhaps the most influential being [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], whose monograph ''Intention'' was called by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] "the most important treatment of action since Aristotle".<ref>From the cover of the 2000 Harvard University Press edition of ''Intention''.</ref> A favorite student and friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein, her 1958 article "Modern Moral Philosophy" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the philosophical lexicon, declared the "is-ought" impasse to be unproductive, and resulted in a revival of virtue ethics.

====Normative ethics====
The first half of the 20th century was marked by skepticism toward and neglect of normative ethics. Related subjects, such as social and political philosophy, aesthetics, and [[philosophy of history]], became only marginal topics of English-language philosophy during this period.

During this time, [[utilitarianism]] was the only non-skeptical type of ethics to remain popular. However, as the influence of logical positivism began to decrease mid-century, analytic philosophers had renewed interest in ethics. [[G.E.M. Anscombe]]'s 1958 "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" sparked a revival of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Virtue ethics|virtue ethical]] approach and [[John Rawls]]'s 1971 ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' restored interest in [[Kantian]] ethical philosophy. Today, contemporary normative ethics is dominated by three schools: [[consequentialism]], [[virtue ethics]], and [[deontology]].

====Applied ethics====
A significant feature of analytic philosophy since approximately 1970 has been the emergence of [[applied ethics]]—an interest in the application of moral principles to specific practical issues. The philosophers following this orientation view ethics as involving humanistic values, which involve practical implications and applications in the way people interact and lead their lives socially.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Philosophical Perspectives on Communalism and Morality in African Traditions|last=Ikuenobe|first=Polycarp|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7391-1131-4|location=Oxford|pages=104}}</ref>

As with the study of ethics, early analytic philosophy tended to avoid the study of [[philosophy of religion]], largely dismissing (as per the logical positivists) the subject as part of [[metaphysics]] and therefore meaningless.<ref>(a notable exception is the series of [[Michael Foster (philosopher)|Michael B. Forest]]'s 1934–36 [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'']] articles involving the Christian doctrine of creation and the rise of modern science).</ref> The demise of logical positivism renewed interest in philosophy of religion, prompting philosophers like [[William Alston]], [[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]], [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Robert Merrihew Adams]], [[Richard Swinburne]], and [[Antony Flew]] not only to introduce new problems, but to re-study classical topics such as the nature of [[miracle]]s, theistic arguments, the [[problem of evil]], (see [[existence of God]]) the rationality of belief in [[God]], concepts of the nature of God, and many more.<ref>Peterson, Michael et al. (2003). ''Reason and Religious Belief''</ref>

Plantinga, Mackie and Flew debated the logical validity of the ''free will defense'' as a way to solve the problem of evil.<ref>Mackie, John L. (1982). ''The Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God''</ref> Alston, grappling with the consequences of analytic [[philosophy of language]], worked on the nature of religious language. Adams worked on the relationship of faith and morality.<ref>Adams, Robert M. (1987). ''The Virtue of Faith And Other Essays in Philosophical Theology''</ref> Analytic epistemology and metaphysics has formed the basis for some philosophically-sophisticated theistic arguments, like those of the [[reformed epistemology|reformed epistemologists]] like Plantinga.

Analytic philosophy of religion has also been preoccupied with Wittgenstein, as well as his interpretation of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy of religion.<ref>Creegan, Charles. (1989). ''Wittgenstein and Kierkegaard: Religion, Individuality and Philosophical Method''</ref> Using first-hand remarks (which was later published in ''Philosophical Investigations'', ''Culture and Value'', and other works), philosophers such as [[Peter Winch]] and [[Norman Malcolm]] developed what has come to be known as ''contemplative philosophy'', a Wittgensteinian school of thought rooted in the "Swansea tradition," and which includes Wittgensteinians such as [[Rush Rhees]], Peter Winch, and [[D.Z. Phillips]], among others. The name "contemplative philosophy" was first coined by D.Z. Phillips in ''Philosophy's Cool Place'', which rests on an interpretation of a passage from Wittgenstein's "Culture and Value."<ref>Phillips, D.Z. (1999). ''Philosophy's Cool Place.'' Cornell University Press. The quote is from Wittgenstein's ''Culture and Value'' (2e): "My ideal is a certain coolness. A temple providing a setting for the passions without meddling with them.''</ref> This interpretation was first labeled, "Wittgensteinian [[Fideism]]," by Kai Nielsen but those who consider themselves Wittgensteinians in the Swansea tradition have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal as a caricature of Wittgenstein's considered position; this is especially true of D.Z. Phillips.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=fideism |title=Fideism}}</ref> Responding to this interpretation, [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] and D.Z. Phillips became two of the most prominent philosophers on Wittgenstein's philosophy of religion.<ref>Nielsen, Kai and D.Z. Phillips. (2005). ''Wittgensteinian Fideism?''</ref>

===Political philosophy===

====Liberalism====
Current analytic political philosophy owes much to [[John Rawls]], who in a series of papers from the 1950s onward (most notably "Two Concepts of Rules" and "Justice as Fairness") and his 1971 book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', produced a sophisticated defense of a generally liberal egalitarian account of distributive justice. This was followed soon by Rawls's colleague [[Robert Nozick]]'s book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', a defence of [[free-market]] [[libertarianism]]. [[Isaiah Berlin]] also had a lasting influence on both analytic political philosophy and [[liberalism]] with his lecture "[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]".

During recent decades there have also been several critiques of liberalism, including the [[feminism|feminist]] critiques of [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]], the [[communitarianism|communitarian]] critiques of [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (although neither of them endorses the term), and the [[multiculturalism|multiculturalist]] critiques of [[Amy Gutmann]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. Although not an analytic philosopher, [[Jürgen Habermas]] is another prominent—if controversial—author of contemporary analytic political philosophy, whose social theory is a blend of social science, Marxism, [[neo-Kantianism]], and American [[pragmatism]].

[[Consequentialist libertarianism]] also derives from the analytic tradition.

====Analytical Marxism====
Another development of political philosophy was the emergence of the school of [[analytical Marxism]]. Members of this school seek to apply techniques of analytic philosophy and modern social science such as [[rational choice theory]] to clarify the theories of [[Karl Marx]] and his successors. The best-known member of this school is [[G. A. Cohen]], whose 1978 work, ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'', is generally considered to represent the genesis of this school. In that book, Cohen used logical and linguistic analysis to clarify and defend Marx's materialist conception of history. Other prominent analytical Marxists include the economist [[John Roemer]], the social scientist [[Jon Elster]], and the sociologist [[Erik Olin Wright]]. The work of these later philosophers have furthered Cohen's work by bringing to bear modern social science methods, such as rational choice theory, to supplement Cohen's use of analytic philosophical techniques in the interpretation of Marxian theory.

Cohen himself would later engage directly with Rawlsian political philosophy to advance a [[socialist]] theory of justice that contrasts with both traditional Marxism and the theories advanced by Rawls and Nozick. In particular, he indicates Marx's principle of [[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]].

====Communitarianism====
[[Communitarian]]s such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Michael Walzer]], and [[Michael Sandel]] advance a critique of liberalism that uses analytic techniques to isolate the main assumptions of liberal individualists, such as Rawls, and then challenges these assumptions. In particular, communitarians challenge the liberal assumption that the individual can be considered as fully autonomous from the community in which he lives and is brought up. Instead, they argue for a conception of the individual that emphasizes the role that the community plays in forming his or her values, thought processes and opinions.

===Analytic metaphysics===
{{Main|Metaphysics}}

One striking difference with respect to early analytic philosophy was the revival of metaphysical theorizing during the second half of the 20th century. Philosophers such as [[David Kellogg Lewis]]<ref>{{Citation|last=Weatherson|first=Brian|title=David Lewis|date=2016|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/david-lewis/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-07-21}}</ref> and [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]]<ref>{{Citation|last=Jackson|first=Frank|title=Armstrong, David Malet (1926–2014)|date=2016|url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/biographical/armstrong-david-malet-1926-2014/v-1|encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|edition=1|place=London|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9780415249126-v035-1|isbn=978-0-415-25069-6|access-date=2020-07-21}}</ref> developed elaborate theories on a range of topics such as universals,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Armstrong, David Malet.|title=Universals and scientific realism|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Among the developments that resulted in the revival of metaphysical theorizing were [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s attack on the [[analytic proposition|analytic–synthetic distinction]], which was generally considered to weaken [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]'s distinction between existence questions internal to a framework and those external to it.<ref>S. Yablo and A. Gallois, ''Does Ontology Rest on a Mistake?'', Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes, Vol. 72, (1998), pp.&nbsp;229–261, 263–283 [https://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/om.pdf first part] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912125408/http://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/om.pdf |date=2011-09-12 }}</ref> Important also for the revival of metaphysics was the further development of [[modal logic]], including the work of [[Saul Kripke]], who argued in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' and elsewhere for the existence of [[essence]]s and the possibility of [[Alethic modal logic|necessary]], [[a posteriori]] truths.<ref>[[Dean Zimmerman|Zimmerman, Dean W.]], "Prologue" in ''Oxford Studies in Metaphysics, Volume 1'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. xix.</ref>

Metaphysics remains a fertile topic of research, having recovered from the attacks of [[A.J. Ayer]] and the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]]. Although many discussions are continuations of old ones from previous decades and centuries, the debate remains active. The philosophy of fiction, the problem of empty names, and the debate over existence's status as a property have all become major concerns, while perennial issues such as free will, possible worlds, and the [[philosophy of time]] have been revived.<ref>Everett, Anthony and Thomas Hofweber (eds.) (2000), ''Empty Names, Fiction and the Puzzles of Non-Existence.''</ref><ref name=inwagenetall1998>Van Inwagen, Peter, and Dean Zimmerman (eds.) (1998), ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions.''</ref>

Science has also had an increasingly significant role in metaphysics. The theory of special relativity has had a profound effect on the philosophy of time, and quantum physics is routinely discussed in the free will debate.<ref name=inwagenetall1998/> The weight given to scientific evidence is largely due to widespread commitments among philosophers to [[scientific realism]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]].

===Philosophy of language===
{{Main|Philosophy of language}}
Philosophy of language is a topic that has decreased in activity during the last four decades, as evidenced by the fact that few major philosophers today treat it as a primary research topic. Indeed, while the debate remains fierce, it is still strongly influenced by those authors from the first half of the century: [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J.L. Austin]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]].

In [[Saul Kripke]]'s publication ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', he argued influentially that flaws in common theories of proper names are indicative of larger misunderstandings of the metaphysics of necessity and possibility. By wedding the techniques of modal logic to a causal theory of reference, Kripke was widely regarded as reviving theories of essence and identity as respectable topics of philosophical discussion.

Another influential philosopher, [[Pavel Tichý]] initiated Transparent Intensional Logic, an original theory of the [[logical analysis]] of [[natural language]]s—the theory is devoted to the problem of saying exactly what it is that we learn, know and can communicate when we come to understand what a sentence means.

===Philosophy of science===
{{Main|Philosophy of science}}
Reacting against both the verificationism of the logical positivists as well as the critiques of the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]], who had suggested the [[falsifiability]] criterion on which to judge the demarcation between science and non-science, discussions of [[philosophy of science]] during the last 40 years were dominated by [[social constructivism|social constructivist]] and [[cognitive relativism|cognitive relativist]] theories of science. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] with his formulation of [[paradigm shift]]s and [[Paul Feyerabend]] with his [[epistemological anarchism]] are significant for these discussions.<ref>Glock 2008, p. 47.</ref> The [[philosophy of biology]] has also undergone considerable growth, particularly due to the considerable debate in recent years over the nature of [[evolution]], particularly [[natural selection]].<ref>Hull, David L. and [[Michael Ruse|Ruse, Michael]], "Preface" in ''The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. xix & xx.</ref> Daniel Dennett and his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', which defends [[Neo-Darwinism]], stand at the foreground of this debate.<ref>Lennox, James G., "Darwinism and Neo-Darwinism" in Sakar and Plutynski (eds.), ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Biology'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2008), p. 89.</ref>

===Epistemology===
{{Main|Epistemology}}
Owing largely to [[Gettier]]'s 1963 paper "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?",<ref>{{Citation|last=Gettier|first=Edmund|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?|date=2020-07-15|work=Arguing About Knowledge|pages=14–15|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781003061038-5|isbn=978-1-003-06103-8|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01439314/file/2013%20Gettier%20Conocimiento.pdf}}</ref> epistemology resurged as a topic of analytic philosophy during the last 50 years. A large portion of current epistemological research is intended to resolve the problems that Gettier's examples presented to the traditional justified true belief model of knowledge, including developing [[Theory of justification|theories of justification]] in order to deal with Gettier's examples, or giving alternatives to the justified true belief model. Other and related topics of contemporary research include debates between [[internalism and externalism]],<ref>Bonjour, Laurence, "Recent Work on the Internalism–Externalism Controversy" in Dancy, Sosa, and Steup (eds.), ''A Companion to Epistemology, Second Edition'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), p. 33.</ref> basic knowledge, the nature of [[evidence]], the value of knowledge, [[epistemic luck]], [[virtue epistemology]], the role of [[intuition (philosophy)|intuitions]] in justification, and treating knowledge as a primitive concept.

===Aesthetics===
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
As a result of attacks on the traditional aesthetic notions of beauty and sublimity from [[post-modern]] thinkers, analytic philosophers were slow to consider art and aesthetic judgment. [[Susanne Langer]]<ref>[[Susanne Langer]], ''Feeling and Form: A Theory of Art'' (1953)</ref> and [[Nelson Goodman]]<ref>[[Nelson Goodman]], ''Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960–61 John Locke lectures.</ref> addressed these problems in an analytic style during the 1950s and 1960s. Since Goodman, aesthetics as a discipline for analytic philosophers has flourished.<ref>Kivy, Peter, "Introduction: Aesthetics Today" in ''The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2004), p. 4.</ref> Rigorous efforts to pursue analyses of traditional aesthetic concepts were performed by [[Guy Sircello]] in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in new analytic theories of love,<ref>[[Guy Sircello]], ''Love and Beauty.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.</ref> sublimity,<ref>[[Guy Sircello]] "How Is a Theory of the Sublime Possible?" ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', Vol. 51, No. 4 (Autumn, 1993), pp.&nbsp;541–550</ref> and beauty.<ref>[[Guy Sircello]], ''A New Theory of Beauty.'' Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.</ref>

'''Analytic philosophy''' is a branch and tradition of [[philosophy]] using [[philosophical analysis|analysis]] which is popular in the [[Western world|Western World]] and particularly the [[Anglosphere]], which began around the turn of the [[20th century]] in the [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary era]] and continues today. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Scandinavia]], the majority of university philosophy departments today identify themselves as "analytic" departments.<ref name="Searle03P1">
"Without exception, the best philosophy departments in the United States are dominated by analytic philosophy, and among the leading philosophers in the United States, all but a tiny handful would be classified as analytic philosophers. Practitioners of types of philosophizing that are not in the analytic tradition—such as phenomenology, classical pragmatism, existentialism, or Marxism—feel it necessary to define their position in relation to analytic philosophy." [[John Searle]] (2003), ''Contemporary Philosophy in the United States'' in N. Bunnin and E. P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed., (Blackwell, 2003), p. 1.</ref>

Central figures in this historical development of analytic philosophy are [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Other important figures in its history include the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] (particularly [[Rudolf Carnap]]), [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]], [[Saul Kripke]], and [[Karl Popper]].

Analytic philosophy is characterized by an emphasis on [[language]], known as the [[linguistic turn]], and for its clarity and rigor in arguments, making use of [[formal logic]] and [[mathematics]], and, to a lesser degree, the [[natural sciences]].<ref name="LeiterWeb">[[Brian Leiter]] (2006) webpage [https://web.archive.org/web/20061115002425/https://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic.asp ''"Analytic" and "Continental" Philosophy'']<!-- https://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/analytic-and-continental-philosophy/ -->. Quote on the definition: "'Analytic' philosophy today names a ''style'' of doing philosophy, not a philosophical program or a set of substantive views. Analytic philosophers, crudely speaking, aim for argumentative clarity and precision; draw freely on the tools of logic; and often identify, professionally and intellectually, more closely with the sciences and mathematics, than with the humanities."</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Glock|first1=H.J.|year=2004|title=Was Wittgenstein an Analytic Philosopher?|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=35|issue=4|pages=419–444|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.2004.00329.x}}</ref><ref>Colin McGinn, ''The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey through Twentieth-Century Philosophy'' (HarperCollins, 2002), p. xi.: "analytical philosophy [is] too narrow a label, since [it] is not generally a matter of taking a word or concept and analyzing it (whatever exactly that might be). [...] This tradition emphasizes clarity, rigor, argument, theory, truth. It is not a tradition that aims primarily for inspiration or consolation or ideology. Nor is it particularly concerned with 'philosophy of life,' though parts of it are. This kind of philosophy is more like science than religion, more like mathematics than poetry—though it is neither science nor mathematics."</ref> It also takes things piecemeal, "an attempt to focus philosophical reflection on smaller problems that lead to answers to bigger questions."<ref>See, e.g., Avrum Stroll, ''Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy'' (Columbia University Press, 2000), p. 5: "[I]t is difficult to give a precise definition of 'analytic philosophy' since it is not so much a specific doctrine as a loose concatenation of approaches to problems." Also, see Stroll (2000), p. 7: "I think Sluga is right in saying 'it may be hopeless to try to determine the essence of analytic philosophy.' Nearly every proposed definition has been challenged by some scholar. [...] [W]e are dealing with a family resemblance concept."</ref><ref>See [[Hans-Johann Glock]], ''What Is Analytic Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 205: "The answer to the title question, then, is that analytic philosophy is a tradition held together ''both'' by ties of mutual influence ''and'' by family resemblances."</ref>

Analytic philosophy is often understood in contrast to other philosophical traditions, most notably [[continental philosophy|continental philosophies]] such as [[existentialism]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and [[Hegelianism]].<ref>[[A.C. Grayling]] (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 2: "Analytic philosophy is mainly associated with the contemporary English-speaking world, but it is by no means the only important philosophical tradition. In this volume two other immensely rich and important such traditions are introduced: Indian philosophy, and philosophical thought in Europe from the time of Hegel." L.J. Cohen, ''The Dialogue of Reason: An Analysis of Analytical Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1986), p. 5: "So, despite a few overlaps, analytical philosophy is not difficult to distinguish broadly [...] from other modern movements, like phenomenology, say, or existentialism, or from the large amount of philosophizing that has also gone on in the present century within frameworks deriving from other influential thinkers like Aquinas, Hegel, or Marx." H.-J. Glock, ''What Is Analytic Philosophy?'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), p. 86: "Most non-analytic philosophers of the twentieth century do not belong to continental philosophy."</ref>

==History<!--'History of analytic philosophy', 'History of Analytic philosophy', 'History of analytical philosophy', and 'History of Analytical philosophy' redirect here-->==
The '''history of analytic philosophy'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (taken in the narrower sense of "[[20th-century philosophy|20th-]]/[[21st-century philosophy|21st-century]] analytic philosophy") is usually thought to begin with the rejection of [[British idealism]], a [[neo-Hegelian]] movement.<ref>Michael Beaney (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of The History of Analytic Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 383.</ref>

British idealism as taught by philosophers such as [[F. H. Bradley]] (1846–1924) and [[T. H. Green]] (1836–1882), dominated English philosophy in the late 19th century. Since its beginning, a basic goal of analytic philosophy has been conceptual clarity,<ref name="PenguinDicP22">Mautner, Thomas (editor) (2005) ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'', entry for "Analytic philosophy", pp. 22–23</ref> in the name of which Moore and Russell rejected [[Hegelianism]] for being obscure—see for example Moore's "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]" and Russell's critique of the [[doctrine of internal relations]].<ref>"Analytic philosophy opposed right from its beginning English neo-Hegelianism of Bradley's sort and similar ones. It did not only criticize the latter's denial of the existence of an external world (anyway an unjust criticism), but also the bombastic, obscure style of Hegel's writings." {{cite journal|last=Jonkers |first=Peter |year=2003 |title=Perspectives on Twentieth Century Philosophy: A Reply to Tom Rockmore |journal=[[Ars Disputandi]] |volume=3 |doi=10.1080/15665399.2003.10819802 |s2cid=70060684 |issn=1566-5399 |url=http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000129/article.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128165848/http://www.arsdisputandi.org/publish/articles/000129/article.pdf |archive-date=2007-11-28 }}</ref> Inspired by developments in modern [[formal logic]], the early Russell claimed that the problems of philosophy can be solved by showing the simple constituents of complex notions.<ref name="PenguinDicP22"/> An important aspect of British idealism was [[logical holism]]—the opinion that there are aspects of the world that can be known only by knowing the whole world. This is closely related to the opinion that [[Property (philosophy)#Relations|relations]] between items are ''internal relations'', that is, [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of the nature of those items. Russell, along with Wittgenstein, in response promulgated [[logical atomism]] and the doctrine of ''external relations''—the belief that the world consists of ''independent'' facts.<ref>Baillie, James, "Introduction to Bertrand Russell" in ''Contemporary Analytic Philosophy, Second Edition'' (Prentice Hall, 1997), p. 25.</ref>

Russell, during his early career, along with his collaborator [[Alfred North Whitehead]], was much influenced by [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925), who developed [[predicate logic]], which allowed a much greater range of sentences to be parsed into logical form than was possible using the ancient [[Aristotelian logic]]. Frege was also influential as a [[philosophy of mathematics|philosopher of mathematics]] in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. In contrast to [[Edmund Husserl]]'s 1891 book ''Philosophie der Arithmetik'', which argued that the concept of the [[cardinal number]] derived from psychical acts of grouping objects and counting them,<ref>{{cite journal |author= Willard, Dallas|title= Husserl on a Logic that Failed|journal= Philosophical Review|pages= 52–53|volume= 89|issue= 1|doi= 10.2307/2184863|jstor= 2184863|year= 1980}}</ref> Frege argued that mathematics and logic have their own validity, independent of the judgments or mental states of individual mathematicians and logicians (which were the basis of arithmetic according to the "[[psychologism]]" of Husserl's ''Philosophie''). Frege further developed his philosophy of logic and mathematics in ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' (1884) and ''The Basic Laws of Arithmetic'' ({{lang-de|Grundgesetze der Arithmetik}}, 1893–1903), where he provided an alternative to psychologistic accounts of the concept of number.

Like Frege, Russell argued that mathematics is reducible to logical fundamentals in ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903). Later, his book written with Whitehead, ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–1913), encouraged many philosophers to renew their interest in the development of [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]]. Additionally, Russell adopted Frege's predicate logic as his primary philosophical method, a method Russell thought could expose the underlying structure of philosophical problems. For example, the English word [[to be|"is"]] has three distinct meanings which predicate logic can express as follows:
* For the sentence 'the cat ''is'' asleep', the ''is'' of [[Predication (philosophy)|predication]] means that "x is P" (denoted as P(x)).
* For the sentence 'there ''is'' a cat', the ''is'' of existence means that "there is an x" (∃x).
* For the sentence 'three ''is'' half of six', the ''is'' of identity means that "x is the same as y" (x=y).

Russell sought to resolve various philosophical problems by applying such logical distinctions, most famously in his analysis of [[definite description]]s in "[[On Denoting]]" (1905).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|year=1905|title=On Denoting|journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]|volume=14|pages=473–493|url=http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/anglica/Chronology/20thC/Russell/rus_deno.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331212120/http://www.fh-augsburg.de/~harsch/anglica/Chronology/20thC/Russell/rus_deno.html|archive-date=2006-03-31}}</ref>

===Ideal language <!--Linked from 'Ludwig Wittgenstein', 'Template:Wittgenstein' and 'Linguistic philosophy'-->===
{{main|Ideal language philosophy}}
From about 1910 to 1930, analytic philosophers like Russell and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] emphasized creating an ideal language for philosophical analysis, which would be free from the ambiguities of ordinary language that, in their opinion, often made philosophy invalid. During this phase, Russell and Wittgenstein sought to understand language (and hence philosophical problems) by using [[Formal logic|logic]] to formalize how philosophical [[statement (logic)|statements]] are made.

=== Logical atomism ===
Russell became an advocate of [[logical atomism]]. Wittgenstein developed a comprehensive system of logical atomism in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' ({{lang-de | Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung}}, 1921). He thereby argued that the universe is the totality of actual states of affairs and that these states of affairs can be expressed by the language of first-order predicate logic. Thus a ''picture'' of the universe can be construed by expressing facts in the form of atomic propositions and linking them using [[logical operator]]s.

===Logical positivism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
During the late 1920s to 1940s, a group of philosophers of the [[Vienna Circle]] and the [[Berlin Circle]] developed Russell and Wittgenstein's formalism into a doctrine known as "[[logical positivism]]" (or logical empiricism). Logical positivism used formal logical methods to develop an empiricist account of knowledge.<ref>{{cite book |author= Carnap, R.|title= The Logical Structure of the World|publisher= Felix Meiner Verlag|year= 1928|lccn= 66013604|isbn= 978-0-8126-9523-6}}</ref> Philosophers such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Hans Reichenbach]], along with other members of the Vienna Circle, claimed that the truths of logic and mathematics were [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], and those of science were verifiable empirical claims. These two constituted the entire universe of meaningful judgments; anything else was nonsense. The claims of ethics, aesthetics, and theology were consequently reduced to pseudo-statements, neither empirically true nor false and therefore meaningless. In reaction to what he considered excesses of logical positivism, [[Karl Popper]] insisted on the role of [[falsifiability|falsification]] in the philosophy of science—although his general method was also part of the analytic tradition.<ref>{{cite book |author= Popper, Karl R.|title= The Logic of Scientific Discovery|publisher= Routledge|year= 2002 | isbn= 978-0-415-27844-7 }}</ref> With the coming to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]] in 1933, many members of the Vienna and Berlin Circles fled to Britain and the US, which helped to reinforce the dominance of logical positivism and analytic philosophy in anglophone countries.

Logical positivists typically considered philosophy as having a minimal function. For them, philosophy concerned the clarification of thoughts, rather than having a distinct subject matter of its own. The positivists adopted the [[verification principle]], according to which every meaningful statement is either [[Analytic proposition|analytic]] or is capable of being verified by experience. This caused the logical positivists to reject many traditional problems of philosophy, especially those of [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]], as meaningless.

===Ordinary language ===
{{Main|Ordinary language philosophy}}

After [[World War II]], during the late 1940s and 1950s, analytic philosophy became involved with ordinary-language analysis. This resulted in two main trends. One continued Wittgenstein's later philosophy, which differed dramatically from his early work of the ''Tractatus''. The other, known as [[Ordinary-language philosophy|"Oxford philosophy"]], involved [[J. L. Austin]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Longworth|first=Guy|title=John Langshaw Austin|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2020/entries/austin-jl/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2020|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-07-21}}.</ref> In contrast to earlier analytic philosophers (including the early Wittgenstein) who thought philosophers should avoid the deceptive trappings of natural language by constructing ideal languages, ordinary-language philosophers claimed that ordinary language already represents many subtle distinctions not recognized in the formulation of traditional philosophical theories or problems. While schools such as logical positivism emphasize logical terms, supposed to be universal and separate from contingent factors (such as culture, language, historical conditions), ordinary-language philosophy emphasizes the use of language by ordinary people. The most prominent ordinary-language philosophers during the 1950s were the aforementioned Austin and [[Gilbert Ryle]].

Ordinary-language philosophers often sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing them to be the result of ordinary misunderstanding language. Examples include Ryle, who tried to dispose of "[[Ghost in the machine|Descartes' myth]]", and Wittgenstein.

==Contemporary analytic philosophy==
Although contemporary philosophers who self-identify as "analytic" have widely divergent interests, assumptions, and methods—and have often rejected the fundamental premises that defined analytic philosophy before 1960—analytic philosophy today is usually considered to be determined by a particular style,<ref name="LeiterWeb"/> characterized by precision and thoroughness about a specific topic, and resistance to "imprecise or cavalier discussions of broad topics".<ref name="autogenerated3" />

During the 1950s, logical positivism was challenged influentially by Wittgenstein in the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'', [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] in "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", and Sellars in ''[[Wilfrid Sellars|Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind]]''. After 1960, anglophone philosophy began to incorporate a wider range of interests, opinions, and methods.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> Still, many philosophers in Britain and America still consider themselves "analytic philosophers".<ref name="Searle03P1"/><ref name="LeiterWeb"/> They have done so largely by expanding the notion of "analytic philosophy" from the specific programs that dominated anglophone philosophy before 1960 to a much more general notion of an "analytic" style.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/analytic.htm |title=Analytic Philosophy Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Iep.utm.edu |access-date=2018-04-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703212901/http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/analytic.htm |archive-date=2009-07-03 }}</ref>

Many philosophers and historians have attempted to define or describe analytic philosophy. Those definitions often include an emphasis on conceptual analysis: [[A.P. Martinich]] draws an analogy between analytic philosophy's interest in conceptual analysis and analytic chemistry, which aims to determine chemical compositions.<ref>{{cite book|title=A companion to analytic philosophy|url=https://archive.org/details/companiontoanaly00mart_918|url-access=limited|publisher=Blackwell|year=2001|isbn=978-0-631-21415-1|editor=[[A.P.

Hales described analytic philosophy as one of three types of philosophical method practiced in the West: "[i]n roughly reverse order by number of proponents, they are phenomenology, ideological philosophy, and analytic philosophy".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hales|first=Steven D.|title=Analytic philosophy : classic readings|year=2002|publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-534-51277-4|pages=1–10}}</ref>

[[Scott Soames]] agrees that clarity is important: analytic philosophy, he says, has "an implicit commitment—albeit faltering and imperfect—to the ideals of clarity, rigor and argumentation" and it "aims at truth and knowledge, as opposed to moral or spiritual improvement [...] the goal in analytic philosophy is to discover what is true, not to provide a useful recipe for living one's life". Soames also states that analytic philosophy is characterized by "a more piecemeal approach. There is, I think, a widespread presumption within the tradition that it is often possible to make philosophical progress by intensively investigating a small, circumscribed range of philosophical issues while holding broader, systematic questions in abeyance".<ref name=Soames>{{cite book |last=Soames|first=Scott|title=The dawn of analysis|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-11573-3|pages=xiii–xvii|edition=2nd print., 1st papers. print.}}</ref>

A few of the most important and active topics and subtopics of analytic philosophy are summarized by the following sections.

===Philosophy of mind and cognitive science===

Motivated by the logical positivists' interest in verificationism, [[logical behaviorism]] was the most prominent [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]] of analytic philosophy for the first half of the 20th century.<ref>Graham, George, "Behaviorism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/behaviorism/]</ref> Behaviorists tended to opine either that statements about the mind were equivalent to ''statements about'' behavior and dispositions to behave in particular ways or that mental states were directly equivalent to behavior and dispositions to behave. Behaviorism later became much less popular, in favor of [[Identity theory of mind|type physicalism]] or [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], theories that identified mental states with brain states. During this period, topics of the philosophy of mind were often related strongly to topics of [[cognitive science]] such as [[modularity of mind|modularity]] or [[Psychological nativism|innateness]]. Finally, analytic philosophy has featured a certain number of philosophers who were [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualists]], and recently forms of property dualism have had a resurgence; the most prominent representative  is [[David Chalmers]].<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=dualism |title=Dualism}}</ref>

[[John Searle]] suggests that the obsession with the philosophy of language during the 20th century has been superseded by an emphasis on the [[philosophy of mind]],<ref>Postrel and Feser, February 2000, ''Reality Principles: An Interview with John R. Searle'' at {{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/27599.html |title=Reality Principles: An Interview with John R.

In recent years, a central focus of research in the philosophy of mind has been [[consciousness]]. While there is a general consensus for the global neuronal workspace model of consciousness,<ref>{{Cite journal

The best known theories are [[Daniel Dennett]]'s [[heterophenomenology]], [[Fred Dretske]] and [[Michael Tye (philosopher)|Michael Tye]]'s [[direct and indirect realism|representationalism]], and the higher-order theories of either [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David M.

===Ethics in analytic philosophy===

Due to the commitments to [[empiricism]] and [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]] in the early analytic period, early analytic philosophers often thought that inquiry in the ethical domain could not be made rigorous enough to merit any attention.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lK6DTadnaQC&q=%22analytic+philosophy%22+ethics&pg=PT213|title=A Brief History of Analytic Philosophy: From Russell to Rawls|last=Schwartz|first=Stephen P.|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-27172-8|language=en}}</ref> It was only with the emergence of ordinary language philosophers that ethics started to become an acceptable area of inquiry for analytic philosophers.<ref name=":0" /> Philosophers working with the analytic tradition have gradually come to distinguish three major types of moral philosophy.
* [[Meta-ethics]] which investigates moral terms and concepts;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Key Terms in Ethics|last=Kuusela|first=Oskari|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4411-6610-4|location=London|pages=61}}</ref>
* [[Normative ethics]] which examines and produces normative ethical judgments;
* [[Applied ethics]], which investigates how existing normative principles should be applied to difficult or borderline cases, often cases created by new technology or new scientific knowledge.

====Meta-ethics====
Twentieth-century meta-ethics has two origins. The first is G.E. Moore's investigation into the nature of ethical terms (e.g., good) in his ''Principia Ethica'' (1903), which identified the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. Along with Hume's famous is/ought distinction, the naturalistic fallacy was a major topic of investigation for analytical philosophers.

The second is in logical positivism and its attitude that unverifiable statements are meaningless. Although that attitude was adopted originally to promote scientific investigation by rejecting grand metaphysical systems, it had the side effect of making (ethical and aesthetic) value judgments (as well as religious statements and beliefs) meaningless. But because value judgments are of significant importance in human life, it became incumbent on logical positivism to develop an explanation of the nature and meaning of value judgments. As a result, analytic philosophers avoided normative ethics and instead began [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] investigations into the nature of moral terms, statements, and judgments.

The [[logical positivist]]s opined that statements about [[Value (ethics)|value]]—including all ethical and aesthetic judgments—are [[non-cognitivism|non-cognitive]]; that is, they cannot be objectively verified or falsified. Instead, the logical positivists adopted an [[emotivism|emotivist]] theory, which was that value judgments expressed the attitude of the speaker. For example, in this view, saying, "Killing is wrong", is equivalent to saying, "Boo to murder", or saying the word "murder" with a particular tone of disapproval.

While analytic philosophers generally accepted non-cognitivism, emotivism had many deficiencies. It evolved into more sophisticated non-cognitivist theories such as the [[expressivism]] of [[Charles Stevenson]], and the [[universal prescriptivism]] of [[R.M. Hare]], which was based on J.L. Austin's philosophy of [[speech acts]].

These theories were not without their critics. [[Philippa Foot]] contributed several essays attacking all these theories. [[J.O. Urmson]]'s article "On Grading" called the is/ought distinction into question.

As non-cognitivism, the is/ought distinction, and the naturalistic fallacy began to be called into question, analytic philosophers showed a renewed interest in the traditional questions of moral philosophy. Perhaps the most influential being [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], whose monograph ''Intention'' was called by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] "the most important treatment of action since Aristotle".<ref>From the cover of the 2000 Harvard University Press edition of ''Intention''.</ref> A favorite student and friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein, her 1958 article "Modern Moral Philosophy" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the philosophical lexicon, declared the "is-ought" impasse to be unproductive, and resulted in a revival of virtue ethics.

====Normative ethics====
The first half of the 20th century was marked by skepticism toward and neglect of normative ethics. Related subjects, such as social and political philosophy, aesthetics, and [[philosophy of history]], became only marginal topics of English-language philosophy during this period.

During this time, [[utilitarianism]] was the only non-skeptical type of ethics to remain popular. However, as the influence of logical positivism began to decrease mid-century, analytic philosophers had renewed interest in ethics. [[G.E.M. Anscombe]]'s 1958 "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" sparked a revival of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Virtue ethics|virtue ethical]] approach and [[John Rawls]]'s 1971 ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' restored interest in [[Kantian]] ethical philosophy. Today, contemporary normative ethics is dominated by three schools: [[consequentialism]], [[virtue ethics]], and [[deontology]].

====Applied ethics====
A significant feature of analytic philosophy since approximately 1970 has been the emergence of [[applied ethics]]—an interest in the application of moral principles to specific practical issues. The philosophers following this orientation view ethics as involving humanistic values, which involve practical implications and applications in the way people interact and lead their lives socially.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Philosophical Perspectives on Communalism and Morality in African Traditions|last=Ikuenobe|first=Polycarp|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7391-1131-4|location=Oxford|pages=104}}</ref>

Topics of special interest for applied ethics include [[Environmental ethics|environmental issues]], [[animal rights]], and the many challenges created by advancing [[bioethics|medical science]].<ref>Brennan, Andrew and Yeuk-Sze Lo (2002). "Environmental Ethics" [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-environmental/#2 §2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801143528/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-environmental/ |date=2013-08-01 }}, in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.</ref><ref>Gruen, Lori (2003).

===Analytic philosophy of religion===

In ''Analytic Philosophy of Religion'', Harris noted that
{{quote|
analytic philosophy has been a very heterogeneous 'movement'.... some forms of analytic philosophy have proven very sympathetic to the philosophy of religion and have provided a philosophical mechanism for responding to other more radical and hostile forms of analytic philosophy.<ref name=harris2001>{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=James Franklin |title=Analytic philosophy of religion |date=2002 |publisher=Kluwer |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-1-4020-0530-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rx2Qf9ieFKYC}} (432 pages) (volume 3 of Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion, {{ISSN|1568-1556}})</ref>{{rp|3}}
}}

As with the study of ethics, early analytic philosophy tended to avoid the study of [[philosophy of religion]], largely dismissing (as per the logical positivists) the subject as part of [[metaphysics]] and therefore meaningless.<ref>(a notable exception is the series of [[Michael Foster (philosopher)|Michael B. Forest]]'s 1934–36 [[Mind (journal)|''Mind'']] articles involving the Christian doctrine of creation and the rise of modern science).</ref> The demise of logical positivism renewed interest in philosophy of religion, prompting philosophers like [[William Alston]], [[J. L. Mackie|John Mackie]], [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Robert Merrihew Adams]], [[Richard Swinburne]], and [[Antony Flew]] not only to introduce new problems, but to re-study classical topics such as the nature of [[miracle]]s, theistic arguments, the [[problem of evil]], (see [[existence of God]]) the rationality of belief in [[God]], concepts of the nature of God, and many more.<ref>Peterson, Michael et al. (2003). ''Reason and Religious Belief''</ref>

Plantinga, Mackie and Flew debated the logical validity of the ''free will defense'' as a way to solve the problem of evil.<ref>Mackie, John L. (1982). ''The Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God''</ref> Alston, grappling with the consequences of analytic [[philosophy of language]], worked on the nature of religious language. Adams worked on the relationship of faith and morality.<ref>Adams, Robert M. (1987). ''The Virtue of Faith And Other Essays in Philosophical Theology''</ref> Analytic epistemology and metaphysics has formed the basis for some philosophically-sophisticated theistic arguments, like those of the [[reformed epistemology|reformed epistemologists]] like Plantinga.

Analytic philosophy of religion has also been preoccupied with Wittgenstein, as well as his interpretation of [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy of religion.<ref>Creegan, Charles. (1989). ''Wittgenstein and Kierkegaard: Religion, Individuality and Philosophical Method''</ref> Using first-hand remarks (which was later published in ''Philosophical Investigations'', ''Culture and Value'', and other works), philosophers such as [[Peter Winch]] and [[Norman Malcolm]] developed what has come to be known as ''contemplative philosophy'', a Wittgensteinian school of thought rooted in the "Swansea tradition," and which includes Wittgensteinians such as [[Rush Rhees]], Peter Winch, and [[D.Z. Phillips]], among others. The name "contemplative philosophy" was first coined by D.Z. Phillips in ''Philosophy's Cool Place'', which rests on an interpretation of a passage from Wittgenstein's "Culture and Value."<ref>Phillips, D.Z. (1999). ''Philosophy's Cool Place.'' Cornell University Press. The quote is from Wittgenstein's ''Culture and Value'' (2e): "My ideal is a certain coolness. A temple providing a setting for the passions without meddling with them.''</ref> This interpretation was first labeled, "Wittgensteinian [[Fideism]]," by Kai Nielsen but those who consider themselves Wittgensteinians in the Swansea tradition have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal as a caricature of Wittgenstein's considered position; this is especially true of D.Z. Phillips.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=fideism |title=Fideism}}</ref> Responding to this interpretation, [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] and D.Z. Phillips became two of the most prominent philosophers on Wittgenstein's philosophy of religion.<ref>Nielsen, Kai and D.Z. Phillips. (2005). ''Wittgensteinian Fideism?''</ref>

===Political philosophy===

====Liberalism====
Current analytic political philosophy owes much to [[John Rawls]], who in a series of papers from the 1950s onward (most notably "Two Concepts of Rules" and "Justice as Fairness") and his 1971 book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', produced a sophisticated defense of a generally liberal egalitarian account of distributive justice. This was followed soon by Rawls's colleague [[Robert Nozick]]'s book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', a defence of [[free-market]] [[libertarianism]]. [[Isaiah Berlin]] also had a lasting influence on both analytic political philosophy and [[liberalism]] with his lecture "[[Two Concepts of Liberty]]".

During recent decades there have also been several critiques of liberalism, including the [[feminism|feminist]] critiques of [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]], the [[communitarianism|communitarian]] critiques of [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (although neither of them endorses the term), and the [[multiculturalism|multiculturalist]] critiques of [[Amy Gutmann]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. Although not an analytic philosopher, [[Jürgen Habermas]] is another prominent—if controversial—author of contemporary analytic political philosophy, whose social theory is a blend of social science, Marxism, [[neo-Kantianism]], and American [[pragmatism]].

[[Consequentialist libertarianism]] also derives from the analytic tradition.

====Analytical Marxism====
Another development of political philosophy was the emergence of the school of [[analytical Marxism]]. Members of this school seek to apply techniques of analytic philosophy and modern social science such as [[rational choice theory]] to clarify the theories of [[Karl Marx]] and his successors. The best-known member of this school is [[G. A. Cohen]], whose 1978 work, ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'', is generally considered to represent the genesis of this school. In that book, Cohen used logical and linguistic analysis to clarify and defend Marx's materialist conception of history. Other prominent analytical Marxists include the economist [[John Roemer]], the social scientist [[Jon Elster]], and the sociologist [[Erik Olin Wright]]. The work of these later philosophers have furthered Cohen's work by bringing to bear modern social science methods, such as rational choice theory, to supplement Cohen's use of analytic philosophical techniques in the interpretation of Marxian theory.

Cohen himself would later engage directly with Rawlsian political philosophy to advance a [[socialist]] theory of justice that contrasts with both traditional Marxism and the theories advanced by Rawls and Nozick. In particular, he indicates Marx's principle of [[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]].

====Communitarianism====
[[Communitarian]]s such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Michael Walzer]], and [[Michael Sandel]] advance a critique of liberalism that uses analytic techniques to isolate the main assumptions of liberal individualists, such as Rawls, and then challenges these assumptions. In particular, communitarians challenge the liberal assumption that the individual can be considered as fully autonomous from the community in which he lives and is brought up. Instead, they argue for a conception of the individual that emphasizes the role that the community plays in forming his or her values, thought processes and opinions.

===Analytic metaphysics===
{{Main|Metaphysics}}

One striking difference with respect to early analytic philosophy was the revival of metaphysical theorizing during the second half of the 20th century. Philosophers such as [[David Kellogg Lewis]]<ref>{{Citation|last=Weatherson|first=Brian|title=David Lewis|date=2016|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/david-lewis/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-07-21}}</ref> and [[David Malet Armstrong|David Armstrong]]<ref>{{Citation|last=Jackson|first=Frank|title=Armstrong, David Malet (1926–2014)|date=2016|url=https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/biographical/armstrong-david-malet-1926-2014/v-1|encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy|edition=1|place=London|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9780415249126-v035-1|isbn=978-0-415-25069-6|access-date=2020-07-21}}</ref> developed elaborate theories on a range of topics such as universals,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Armstrong, David Malet.|title=Universals and scientific realism|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Among the developments that resulted in the revival of metaphysical theorizing were [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s attack on the [[analytic proposition|analytic–synthetic distinction]], which was generally considered to weaken [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]]'s distinction between existence questions internal to a framework and those external to it.<ref>S. Yablo and A. Gallois, ''Does Ontology Rest on a Mistake?'', Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes, Vol. 72, (1998), pp.&nbsp;229–261, 263–283 [https://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/om.pdf first part] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912125408/http://www.mit.edu/%7Eyablo/om.pdf |date=2011-09-12 }}</ref> Important also for the revival of metaphysics was the further development of [[modal logic]], including the work of [[Saul Kripke]], who argued in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' and elsewhere for the existence of [[essence]]s and the possibility of [[Alethic modal logic|necessary]], [[a posteriori]] truths.<ref>[[Dean Zimmerman|Zimmerman, Dean W.]], "Prologue" in ''Oxford Studies in Metaphysics, Volume 1'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. xix.</ref>

Metaphysics remains a fertile topic of research, having recovered from the attacks of [[A.J. Ayer]] and the [[Logical positivism|logical positivists]]. Although many discussions are continuations of old ones from previous decades and centuries, the debate remains active. The philosophy of fiction, the problem of empty names, and the debate over existence's status as a property have all become major concerns, while perennial issues such as free will, possible worlds, and the [[philosophy of time]] have been revived.<ref>Everett, Anthony and Thomas Hofweber (eds.) (2000), ''Empty Names, Fiction and the Puzzles of Non-Existence.''</ref><ref name=inwagenetall1998>Van Inwagen, Peter, and Dean Zimmerman (eds.) (1998), ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions.''</ref>

Science has also had an increasingly significant role in metaphysics. The theory of special relativity has had a profound effect on the philosophy of time, and quantum physics is routinely discussed in the free will debate.<ref name=inwagenetall1998/> The weight given to scientific evidence is largely due to widespread commitments among philosophers to [[scientific realism]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]].

===Philosophy of language===
{{Main|Philosophy of language}}
Philosophy of language is a topic that has decreased in activity during the last four decades, as evidenced by the fact that few major philosophers today treat it as a primary research topic. Indeed, while the debate remains fierce, it is still strongly influenced by those authors from the first half of the century: [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J.L. Austin]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]].

In [[Saul Kripke]]'s publication ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', he argued influentially that flaws in common theories of proper names are indicative of larger misunderstandings of the metaphysics of necessity and possibility. By wedding the techniques of modal logic to a causal theory of reference, Kripke was widely regarded as reviving theories of essence and identity as respectable topics of philosophical discussion.

Another influential philosopher, [[Pavel Tichý]] initiated Transparent Intensional Logic, an original theory of the [[logical analysis]] of [[natural language]]s—the theory is devoted to the problem of saying exactly what it is that we learn, know and can communicate when we come to understand what a sentence means.

===Philosophy of science===
{{Main|Philosophy of science}}
Reacting against both the verificationism of the logical positivists as well as the critiques of the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]], who had suggested the [[falsifiability]] criterion on which to judge the demarcation between science and non-science, discussions of [[philosophy of science]] during the last 40 years were dominated by [[social constructivism|social constructivist]] and [[cognitive relativism|cognitive relativist]] theories of science. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] with his formulation of [[paradigm shift]]s and [[Paul Feyerabend]] with his [[epistemological anarchism]] are significant for these discussions.<ref>Glock 2008, p. 47.</ref> The [[philosophy of biology]] has also undergone considerable growth, particularly due to the considerable debate in recent years over the nature of [[evolution]], particularly [[natural selection]].<ref>Hull, David L. and [[Michael Ruse|Ruse, Michael]], "Preface" in ''The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. xix & xx.</ref> Daniel Dennett and his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', which defends [[Neo-Darwinism]], stand at the foreground of this debate.<ref>Lennox, James G., "Darwinism and Neo-Darwinism" in Sakar and Plutynski (eds.), ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Biology'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2008), p. 89.</ref>

===Epistemology===
{{Main|Epistemology}}
Owing largely to [[Gettier]]'s 1963 paper "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?",<ref>{{Citation|last=Gettier|first=Edmund|title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?|date=2020-07-15|work=Arguing About Knowledge|pages=14–15|publisher=Routledge|doi=10.4324/9781003061038-5|isbn=978-1-003-06103-8|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01439314/file/2013%20Gettier%20Conocimiento.pdf}}</ref> epistemology resurged as a topic of analytic philosophy during the last 50 years. A large portion of current epistemological research is intended to resolve the problems that Gettier's examples presented to the traditional justified true belief model of knowledge, including developing [[Theory of justification|theories of justification]] in order to deal with Gettier's examples, or giving alternatives to the justified true belief model. Other and related topics of contemporary research include debates between [[internalism and externalism]],<ref>Bonjour, Laurence, "Recent Work on the Internalism–Externalism Controversy" in Dancy, Sosa, and Steup (eds.), ''A Companion to Epistemology, Second Edition'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), p. 33.</ref> basic knowledge, the nature of [[evidence]], the value of knowledge, [[epistemic luck]], [[virtue epistemology]], the role of [[intuition (philosophy)|intuitions]] in justification, and treating knowledge as a primitive concept.

===Aesthetics===
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
As a result of attacks on the traditional aesthetic notions of beauty and sublimity from [[post-modern]] thinkers, analytic philosophers were slow to consider art and aesthetic judgment. [[Susanne Langer]]<ref>[[Susanne Langer]], ''Feeling and Form: A Theory of Art'' (1953)</ref> and [[Nelson Goodman]]<ref>[[Nelson Goodman]], ''Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960–61 John Locke lectures.</ref> addressed these problems in an analytic style during the 1950s and 1960s. Since Goodman, aesthetics as a discipline for analytic philosophers has flourished.<ref>Kivy, Peter, "Introduction: Aesthetics Today" in ''The Blackwell Guide to Aesthetics'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2004), p. 4.</ref> Rigorous efforts to pursue analyses of traditional aesthetic concepts were performed by [[Guy Sircello]] in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in new analytic theories of love,<ref>[[Guy Sircello]], ''Love and Beauty.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1989.</ref> sublimity,<ref>[[Guy Sircello]] "How Is a Theory of the Sublime Possible?" ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', Vol. 51, No. 4 (Autumn, 1993), pp.&nbsp;541–550</ref> and beauty.<ref>[[Guy Sircello]], ''A New Theory of Beauty.'' Princeton Essays on the Arts, 1. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1975.</ref>
