[[File:VHS-Video-Tape-Top-Flat.jpg|thumb|The VHS cassette in the [[Japanese horror]] film [[Ring (film)|''Ring'']] is an example of a dark medium.]]
'''Dark media''' are a type of media outlined by American philosopher [[Eugene Thacker]].

==Overview==
Discussed at length in the essay of the same name, Eugene Thacker writes that dark media are media that function too well.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=92}}</ref> Thacker writes that, "dark media have, as their aim, the mediation of that which is unavailable or inaccessible to the senses, and thus that which we are normally "in the dark" about."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=85}}</ref> Typically in works of [[Horror fiction|Horror]], dark media are relatively commonplace media that show more of the world than is expected, with the dark medium showing what lies beyond the possibility of human sense. Dark media are significant in their ability to breach the, typically unbridgeable, gap between objects being mediated.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=84}}</ref> With dark media, as shown in the [[Japanese horror|J-Horror]] film [[Ring (film)|''Ring'']], dark media can create a point between the natural and the supernatural.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thacker|first1=Eugene|title=Excommunication|date=2013|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=92}}</ref> In ''Ring'', the dark medium of the [[VHS|VHS cassette]] makes it possible for antagonist [[Sadako Yamamura]] to cross the threshold of a tv, and subsequently kill those that have viewed the videotape.

==Examples of dark media==
