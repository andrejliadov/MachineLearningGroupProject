'''Action theory''' (or '''theory of action''') is an area in [[philosophy]] concerned with [[Theory|theories]] about the processes [[Causality|causing]] [[Will (philosophy)|willful]] [[Motor system|human bodily movements]] of a more or less complex kind. This [[List of academic disciplines|area of thought]] involves epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, jurisprudence, and philosophy of mind, and has attracted the strong interest of philosophers ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Third Book). With the advent of [[psychology]] and later [[neuroscience]], many theories of action are now subject to [[empirical test]]ing.

Philosophical action theory, or the '''philosophy of action''', should not be confused with [[sociological]] theories of [[social action]], such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] established by [[Talcott Parsons]].  Nor should it be confused with [[Activity theory|Activity Theory]].

== Overview ==
Basic action theory typically describes [[action (philosophy)|action]] as behavior caused by an ''agent'' in a particular ''situation''. The agent's ''desires'' and ''beliefs'' (e.g. me wanting a glass of water and believing the clear liquid in the cup in front of me is water) lead to bodily behavior (e.g. reaching over for the glass). In the simple theory (see [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]), the desire and belief jointly cause the action. [[Michael Bratman]] has raised problems for such a view and argued that we should take the concept of intention as basic and not analyzable into beliefs and desires.

In some theories a desire plus a belief about the means of satisfying that desire are always what is behind an action. Agents aim, in acting, to maximize the satisfaction of their desires. Such a theory of prospective rationality underlies much of [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s within the more sophisticated framework of [[rational choice]]. However, many theories of action argue that rationality extends far beyond calculating the best means to achieve one's ends. For instance, a belief that I ought to do X, in some theories, can directly cause me to do X without my having to want to do X (i.e. have a desire to do X). Rationality, in such theories, also involves responding correctly to the reasons an agent perceives, not just acting on wants.

While action theorists generally employ the language of [[causality]] in their theories of what the nature of action is, the issue of what causal determination comes to has been central to controversies about the nature of [[free will]].

Conceptual discussions also revolve around a precise definition of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] in philosophy. Scholars may disagree on which bodily movements fall under this category, e.g. whether thinking should be analysed as action, and how complex actions involving several steps to be taken and diverse intended consequences are to be summarised or decomposed.

'''Action theory''' (or '''theory of action''') is an area in [[philosophy]] concerned with [[Theory|theories]] about the processes [[Causality|causing]] [[Will (philosophy)|willful]] [[Motor system|human bodily movements]] of a more or less complex kind. This [[List of academic disciplines|area of thought]] involves epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, jurisprudence, and philosophy of mind, and has attracted the strong interest of philosophers ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Third Book). With the advent of [[psychology]] and later [[neuroscience]], many theories of action are now subject to [[empirical test]]ing.

Philosophical action theory, or the '''philosophy of action''', should not be confused with [[sociological]] theories of [[social action]], such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] established by [[Talcott Parsons]].  Nor should it be confused with [[Activity theory|Activity Theory]].

== Overview ==
Basic action theory typically describes [[action (philosophy)|action]] as behavior caused by an ''agent'' in a particular ''situation''. The agent's ''desires'' and ''beliefs'' (e.g. me wanting a glass of water and believing the clear liquid in the cup in front of me is water) lead to bodily behavior (e.g. reaching over for the glass). In the simple theory (see [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]), the desire and belief jointly cause the action. [[Michael Bratman]] has raised problems for such a view and argued that we should take the concept of intention as basic and not analyzable into beliefs and desires.

In some theories a desire plus a belief about the means of satisfying that desire are always what is behind an action. Agents aim, in acting, to maximize the satisfaction of their desires. Such a theory of prospective rationality underlies much of [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s within the more sophisticated framework of [[rational choice]]. However, many theories of action argue that rationality extends far beyond calculating the best means to achieve one's ends. For instance, a belief that I ought to do X, in some theories, can directly cause me to do X without my having to want to do X (i.e. have a desire to do X). Rationality, in such theories, also involves responding correctly to the reasons an agent perceives, not just acting on wants.

While action theorists generally employ the language of [[causality]] in their theories of what the nature of action is, the issue of what causal determination comes to has been central to controversies about the nature of [[free will]].

Conceptual discussions also revolve around a precise definition of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] in philosophy. Scholars may disagree on which bodily movements fall under this category, e.g. whether thinking should be analysed as action, and how complex actions involving several steps to be taken and diverse intended consequences are to be summarised or decomposed.
