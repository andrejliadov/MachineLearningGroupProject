Dwivedi is originally from [[Allahabad]].  Her mother is Sunitha Dwivedi and her father, Rakesh Dwivedi, practices as a senior lawyer for the Supreme Court of India.<ref>{{cite news|author=Chandran, Cynthia|title=New book rubbishes BJP aim to assimilate Gandhi|work=[[Deccan Chronicle]]|date=February 11, 2019|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/110219/new-book-rubbishes-bjp-aim-to-assimilate-gandhi.html|access-date=December 22, 2019}}</ref>

She received her [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Lady Shri Ram College]], Delhi and her [[Master's degree]] from [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi|St. Stephen's College]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://hss.iitd.ac.in/faculty/divya-dwivedi|title=Divya Dwivedi &#124; Humanities & Social Sciences|website=hss.iitd.ac.in}}</ref> She pursued her [[Master of Philosophy|M.Phil]] from [[University of Delhi]] and went on to receive her [[doctorate]] from [[Indian Institute of Technology Delhi|Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi]].<ref name=":0" />

When she was a student in 2006, Dwivedi co-organised a conference on "the state of philosophy in India" in [[Delhi School of Economics]]. She was "exiled to silence" as a result of questioning the way philosophy was practiced in India.<ref name="The Resurrection of Philosophy" />

==Philosophical work==
Dwivedi is currently an associate professor at Department of Humanities & Social Sciences, IIT Delhi.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=The proletariat are all those who are denied the collective faculty of imagination; Divya Dwivedi tells ILNA|url=https://www.ilna.news/Section-world-8/907722-the-proletariat-are-all-those-who-are-denied-the-collective-faculty-of-imagination-divya-dwivedi-tells-ilna|website=ILNA|language=en|access-date=2020-05-17}}</ref> She had earlier taught at St. Stephen's College from 2003 to 2004 and at Dept. of English, Delhi University from January 2011 to April 2012.<ref name=":0" /> She was also a [[visiting scholar]] at Centre for Fictionality Studies, [[Aarhus University]] in 2013 and 2014.<ref name=":0" />

=== School of thought ===
Dwivedi said that philosophy is a disruptive practice following from the [[Socrates|Socratic]] model, "philosophy would be the disruption of every given 'way of life' to be understood as unexamined life".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.governancenow.com/views/interview/in-search-of-gandhis-answer-to-the-question-what-a-human-life-should-be|title=In search of Gandhi's answer to the question: 'What a human life should be', Interview|first=Ashish|last=Mehta|website=Governance Now|date=2019-04-05}}</ref> Following from it there is "a necessary relation between philosophy and politics". In an interview conducted by [[Adèle Van Reeth]] for [[France Culture]] at the ''[[UNESCO]]'' headquarters Dwivedi stated that one must not recognize tradition as an adjective of philosophical practice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/les-chemins-de-la-philosophie/philosopher-en-inde|title=Une nuit de philosophie (1/4) : Philosopher en Inde|website=France Culture}}</ref> Her work has a relation to the school of [[deconstruction]].<ref name="ayyar1">{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/books/bending-the-binary-gandhi-and-philosophy-5952328|title=Bending the binary|first=Raj|last=Ayyar|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]}}</ref>

Divya Dwivedi is opposed to [[postcolonial theory]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/01/30/why-is-southeast-asia-lacking-in-postcolonial-perspectives.html|title=Why is Southeast Asia lacking in postcolonial perspectives?|last=Dalziel|first=Alex|website=[[The Jakarta Post]]}}</ref> and [[subaltern studies]]. In an interview with ''[[Mediapart]]'' Dwivedi said that postcolonial theory and Hindu nationalism are two versions of the same theory, and that they are both upper [[caste]] political projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediapart.fr/en/journal/international/270518/hindu-nationalism-and-why-being-philosopher-india-can-get-you-killed|title=Hindu nationalism and why 'being a philosopher in India can get you killed'|last=Confavreux|first=Joseph|website=mediapart.fr}}</ref> Dwivedi noted that in the field of [[feminism]] postcolonial theory remains an upper caste theoretical standpoint which has been preventing lower caste feminists from opening their own currents in the context of the [[Me too movement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/india/amid-changing-nature-of-sex-as-an-activity-debates-over-raya-sarkars-list-represent-post-colonial-binaries-4194227.html|title=Amid changing nature of sex as an activity, debates over Raya Sarkar's list represent post-colonial binaries|website=Firstpost}}</ref> Dwivedi wrote in her editorial introduction to the ''[[UNESCO]]'' journal ''La Revue des Femmes-Philosophes'' that postcolonial theory is continuous with Hindu nationalism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000265538|title=N° 4-5 / December 2017 ''Intellectuals, Philosophers, Women in India: Endangered Species''|website=www.unesco.org}}</ref>{{quote|text=Together, postcolonialism and subaltern theory have established the paradigm of research in humanities and social sciences—in India and abroad—over the past four decades. "Eurocentrism", "historicisation", and "postcolonialism" are also the operative terms through which the Hindu nationalist discourse conserves the caste order.}}

=== Works ===

==== ''Gandhi and Philosophy: On Theological Anti-politics'' ====
In 2018, Dwivedi co-authored ''[[Gandhi and Philosophy: On Theological Anti-politics]]'' with philosopher [[Shaj Mohan]]. The book examines different aspects of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s thought from within a unique framework and discuss his impact on 20th-century philosophy.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/gandhi-and-philosophy-9781474221719/|title=Gandhi and Philosophy|website=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury Academic]]}}</ref>  [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] wrote the foreword.<ref name="auto6">{{Cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/933644/what-different-theories-of-philosophy-tell-us-about-gandhis-experiments-with-truth|title=Book Excerpt: What different theories of philosophy tell us about Gandhi's experiments with truth|website=[[Scroll.in]]}}</ref>

The book proposes that in addition to the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] tendency in philosophy there is a 'hypophysical tendency'; hypophysics is defined as "a conception of nature as value". The distance from [[nature]] that human beings and natural objects come to have through the effects of [[technology]] lessens their value, or brings them closer to [[evil]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frontline.thehindu.com/dispatches/article29575546.ece|title=Gandhi's Experiments with Hypophysics|website=[[Frontline magazine|Frontline]]}}</ref> Gandhi's concept of passive force or [[nonviolence]] is an implication of his hypophysical commitment to nature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openthemagazine.com/lounge/books/second-thoughts/|title= A philosophical appraisal of Gandhi's outlook and ideas|first=Siddharth|last=Singh|website=[[Open (Indian magazine)|Open Magazine]]}}</ref> Dwivedi made a separation between ''metaphysics'' and ''hypophysics'' in her [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] lecture, "While both seek to diagnose the 'west', each opens on to distinct futures: metaphysics to an "other thinking" than philosophy, hypophysics to the other of thinking itself".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wlv.ac.uk/about-us/our-schools-and-institutes/faculty-of-arts/school-of-humanities/undergraduate-courses/philosophy/rip-public-lectures/shaj-mohan-new-delhi-and-divya-dwivedi-iit-delhi/|title=Gandhi's Hypophysics (Dwivedi)|website=[[Royal Institute of Philosophy]]: Public Lectures}}</ref>

''Gandhi and Philosophy'' identifies racism with caste practices and controversially ascribes a form of [[racism]] to Gandhi. One reviewer wrote, "In the book, Mohan and Dwivedi argue that Gandhi not only upheld caste, but also viewed it as India's unique contribution to the world!".<ref name="ayyar1" /> When ''[[The Indian Express]]'' reported on the developing uproar resulting from allegations of Gandhi's racism, Dwivedi said in response that Gandhi was a specific type of racist. She said that the ongoing debates on the topic of Gandhi's racism are misleading which are conducted superficially by selectively quoting Gandhi for convenience,<ref name="auto5" />
{{quote|text=It misleads us into thinking that Gandhi is a garden variety racist who wanted to preserve traditional discriminations and [[Racial Segregation|segregation]] mainly because of the prestige of the past or to conserve existing social mores. In fact, Gandhi invented a new basis for racism, which is based on moral superiority.}}

Writing about the book in ''[[The Washington Post]]'',  Krithika Varagur charged that Gandhi's political project created the conditions for the rise of Hindu nationalism in present-day India by making religion an integral part of anti-colonialism. Dwivedi was quoted in the ''Post'' as saying, "Gandhi played a huge role in solidifying the Hindu majority identity in India today".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/indias-2-biggest-political-parties-vie-for-gandhis-legacy/2019/10/01/ef2b5170-e444-11e9-b0a6-3d03721b85ef_story.html|title=India's 2 biggest political parties vie for Gandhi's legacy|first=Krithika|last=Varagur|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

She said that Gandhi's abuses of his power were often interpreted as truthfulness. According to ''Gandhi and Philosophy'' Gandhi's ideal state and the absolute security state are virtually indistinguishable. Since Gandhi was not committed to liberal left politics his political programs have the risk of getting appropriated by the far right .<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/110219/new-book-rubbishes-bjp-aim-to-assimilate-gandhi.html|title=New book rubbishes BJP aim to assimilate Gandhi|newspaper=[[Deccan Chronicle]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://caravanmagazine.in/security/gandhi-justify-security-state-cleanliness|title=How Gandhi's writings justify a security state using notions of "cleanliness"|website=[[The Caravan (magazine)|The Caravan]]}}</ref>
{{quote|text=That is, the attempts in India which still continue to hold Gandhi as the fakir of peace between the ethnic groupings are still playing, often unwittingly, a game to bring about "Hindu Raj" interpreted as secularism.}} Mohan and Dwivedi wrote that M. K. Gandhi shares the responsibility for inventing Hindu religion and Hindi language. They said that Gandhi contributed to creating a political culture based on religion and for giving a Hindu character for India as a new country.<ref name="Courage to Begin">{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/gandhi-jayanti-anniversary-150-a-new-afterlife-6034217/|title=Courage to Begin|first1=Divya|last1=Dwivedi|first2=Shaj|last2=Mohan|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]}}</ref> ''Gandhi and Philosophy'' argues that M. K. Gandhi's insensitivity towards the suffering of the [[Jewish people]] under the [[Nazi]] state follows from his theory of truth. Gandhi suggested to the Jewish people "to expose oneself to annihilation in order that one is conjoined to absolute truth. In [[The Holocaust|their own annihilation]] the Jewish people were to have the non-experience of Absolute Truth – 'a joyful sleep'."<ref name="auto6" />

===== Reception =====
According to [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] ''Gandhi and Philosophy'' leads to a new orientation outside of the [[Theology|theological]], metaphysical and nihilistic tendencies in philosophy. [[Bernard Stiegler]] said that this work "give us to reconsider the history of [[nihilism]] in the [[Eschatology|eschatological]] contemporaneity and shows its ultimate limits" and offers a new path.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7p1DwAAQBAJ&q=editions:G86bbr8NZ9wC|title=Qu'appelle-t-on Panser ?: 1.

[[Robert Bernasconi]] said that the inventiveness and the [[Constructivism (philosophy of mathematics)|constructivism]] behind the concept of ''ana-stasis'', or the overcoming of stasis, has a relation to the project of ''re-beginning of philosophy'' by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]].<ref name="auto4">{{Citation|title=Robert Bernasconi speaking at the launch of 'Gandhi & Philosophy'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZwd_Gl-aN0|language=en|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref>

The Book Review said that the philosophical project of ''Gandhi and Philosophy'' is to create new evaluative categories, "the authors, in engaging with Gandhi's thought, create their categories, at once descriptive and evaluative" while pointing to the difficulty given by the rigour of a "A seminal if difficult read for those with an appetite for philosophy".<ref name="auto3">{{Cite web|url=http://thebookreviewindia.org/philosophizing-gandhi/|title=Philosophizing Gandhi|last=Tankha|first=V|website=The Book Review}}</ref>

Dwivedi's work was criticised from the point of view methodological and stylistic difficulty. Robert Bernasconi noted that Dwivedi's ''Gandhi and Philosophy'' is a difficult book and it is "not a book that you will understand at first reading".<ref name="auto4" /> The difficulty due to the constructivist style was noted by other authors as well.<ref name="auto3" /><ref name="auto7">{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/books/gandhi-and-philosophy-book-review|title=Gandhi as Chrysalis for a New Philosophy|website=[[The Wire (Indian web publication)|The Wire]]}}</ref> [[Tridip Suhrud]] pointed to the "opacity" of style in ''[[The Hindu]]'' and explained it as the effect of "reflections on language".<ref name="auto8">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/gandhi-and-philosophy-on-theological-anti-politics-review-leap-of-faith/article29118506.ece|title='Gandhi and Philosophy – On Theological Anti-Politics' review: Leap of faith|last=Suhrud|first=Tridip|date=2019-08-17|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]}}</ref> ''Gandhi and Philosophy'' was criticised from the point of view of the recent mounting criticisms of Gandhi in India and internationally. It was said that ''Gandhi and Philosophy'' might be exalting Gandhi while being very critical of him at the same time. The ambiguous approach to Gandhi was described in one of the commentaries in [[The Indian Express]] as "Mohan and Dwivedi have done a masterful job of avoiding the binary fork — hagiography or vituperation — as much of Gandhi and hagiography comes from a need to spiritualise Gandhi".<ref name="ayyar1" /> ''Economic and Political Weekly'' pointed to Dwivedi's participation in the paradigm of "[[western philosophy]]", especially when Gandhi's goal was to create an alternative to [[Eurocentrism]]. ''[[Economic and Political Weekly|EPW]]'' said that her work may be of interest only to [[continental philosophy]] as she does not participate in ''Indic'' discourses.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.epw.in/journal/2019/31/book-reviews/gandhi-company-western-philosophers.html|title=Gandhi in the Company of Western Philosophers|issue=23, 23, 23, 23, 23, 31|pages=7, 7, 7, 7, 7–8, 8, 8, 8, 8|first=A|last=Raghuramaraju|journal=Economic and Political Weekly, Economic and Political Weekly, Economic and Political Weekly, Economic and Political Weekly, Economic and Political Weekly|volume=50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 54}}</ref> In ''[[The Indian Express]]'' Aakash Joshi commented on the negative implications of ''Gandhi and Philosophy'' and said that through this book ''"Gandhi can be seen as a nihilist — someone who even decries sex for reproduction and would like human society to wither away"''. Joshi stressed that this point of view is opposed to "secularism of a particular kind, freedom from colonial concepts, caste without violence".<ref name="auto5" />

==== Miscellaneous ====
The philosopher [[Barbara Cassin]] said that Dwivedi's theoretical stand reveals the actual political stakes in postcolonial theory. Cassin said "She is a philosopher" whose refusal to make "the post-colonial the first and the last word undoubtedly allows us to clarify with greater precision what is happening to women, philosophers and intellectuals in India today".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/resources/periodicals/women-philosophers-journal/issue-n-4-5/|title=Issue N° 4-5 &#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org}}</ref> Dwivedi has edited anthologies addressing political and philosophical issues. The volume titled ''The Public Sphere: From Outside the West''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-public-sphere-from-outside-the-west-9781350028340/|title=The Public Sphere From Outside the West|website=Bloomsbury Publishing}}</ref> treated the radical transformation of the [[public sphere]] and cultural landscapes through new technologies and political forms such as populism.
