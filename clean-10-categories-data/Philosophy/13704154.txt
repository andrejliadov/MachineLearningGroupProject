{{History of Western philosophy}}

'''Western philosophy''' refers to the [[philosophy|philosophical]] thought and work of the [[Western world]]. Historically, the term refers to the philosophical thinking of [[Western culture]], beginning with the [[ancient Greek philosophy]] of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]]. The word ''philosophy'' itself originated from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''philosophía'' (φιλοσοφία), literally, "the love of wisdom" (φιλεῖν ''phileîn'', "to love" and σοφία ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|sophía]]'', "wisdom").

== Ancient ==
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}The scope of ancient Western philosophy included the problems of philosophy as they are understood today; but it also included many other disciplines, such as [[pure mathematics]] and [[natural science]]s such as [[physics]], [[astronomy]], and [[biology]] ([[Aristotle]], for example, wrote on all of these topics).

=== Pre-Socratics ===
{{Main|Pre-Socratic philosophy}}The pre-Socratic philosophers were interested in [[cosmology]]; the nature and origin of the universe, while rejecting [[Greek mythology|mythical answers]] to such questions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

The first recognized philosopher, [[Thales of Miletus]] (born ca. 625 BCE in [[Ionia]]) identified water as the arche (claiming "all is water"). His use of observation and reason to derive this conclusion is the reason for distinguishing him as the first philosopher.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

Following both Thales and Anaximander, [[Anaximenes of Miletus]] claimed that [[Air (classical element)|air]] was the most suitable candidate.[[File:Turkey_ancient_region_map_ionia.JPG|right|thumb|[[Ionia]], source of early Greek philosophy, in western [[Asia Minor]]]][[Pythagoras]] (born ca. 570 BCE), from the island of [[Samos]] off the coast of Ionia, later lived in [[Crotone|Croton]] in southern Italy ([[Magna Graecia]]). [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] hold that "all is number", giving ''formal'' accounts in contrast to the previous ''material'' of the Ionians. The discovery of consonant [[Interval (music)|intervals]] in music by the group enabled the concept of ''harmony'' to be established in philosophy, which suggested that opposites could together give rise to new things.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling, A.

[[Parmenides]] argued that, unlike the other philosophers who believed the ''arche'' was transformed into multiple things, the world must be singular, unchanging and eternal, while anything suggesting the contrary was an illusion.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

In addition to these philosophers, the [[Sophist|Sophists]] comprised teachers of rhetoric who taught students to debate on any side of an issue.

[[Protagoras]], one of the most influential Sophist philosophers, claimed that "man is the measure of all things", suggesting there is no objective truth.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

===Classical period<!--'5th century BC philosophy' and '4th century BC philosophy' redirect here-->===

The Classical period of ancient Greek philosophy centers on [[Socrates]] and the two generations of students following him. 

Socrates experienced a life-changing event when his friend, [[Chaerephon]] visited the [[Oracle of Delphi]] where the [[Pythia]] told him that [[List_of_oracular_statements_from_Delphi#440_BC|no one in Athens was wiser than Socrates]]. Learning of this, Socrates subsequently spent much of his life questioning anyone in Athens who would engage him, in order to investigate the Pithia's claim.<ref>West, Thomas G., and Platon. ''Plato's Apology of Socrates: an interpretation, with a new translation''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1979.</ref> Socrates developed a critical approach, now called the [[Socratic method]], to examine people's views. He focused on issues of human life: [[eudaimonia]], [[justice]], [[beauty]], [[truth]], and [[virtue]]. Although Socrates wrote nothing himself, two of his disciples, [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]], wrote about some of his conversations, although Plato also deployed [[Socratic problem|Socrates as a fictional character]] in some of his dialogues. These [[Socratic dialogue]]s display the Socratic method being applied to examine philosophical problems.

Socrates's questioning earned him enemies who eventually accused him of impiety and corrupting the youth. He was tried by the Athenian democracy, was found guilty, and was sentenced to death. Although his friends offered to help him escape from prison, Socrates chose to remain in Athens and abide by his principles. His execution consisted of drinking poison [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]]. He died in 399 BC.

After Socrates' death, Plato founded the [[Platonic Academy]] and [[Platonism|Platonic philosophy]]. As Socrates had done, Plato identified [[virtue]] with [[knowledge]]. This led him to questions of [[epistemology]] on what knowledge is and how it is acquired.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A. C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0mHDwAAQBAJ|title=The History of Philosophy|date=2019-11-05|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-9848-7875-5|pages=68|language=en}}</ref> Plato believed that the senses are illusionary and could not be trusted,<ref name=":3" /> illustrating this point with the [[allegory of the cave]]. He thought that knowledge had to be sourced from eternal, unchanging, and perfect objects, which led to his [[theory of forms]].<ref name=":3" /> [[Alfred North Whitehead]] claimed that "Philosophy is footnotes to Plato".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evangeliou|first=Christos C.|date=2001|title=European Philosophy: Simply a Series of Footnotes to Plato?|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41166929|journal=Mediterranean Studies|volume=10|pages=167–180|jstor=41166929|issn=1074-164X}}</ref>

Socrates had several other students who also founded schools of philosophy. Two of these were short-lived: the [[Eretrian school]], founded by [[Phaedo of Elis]], and the [[Megarian school]], founded by [[Euclid of Megara]]. Two others were long-lasting: [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], founded by [[Antisthenes]], and [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaicism]], founded by [[Aristippus]]. The Cynics considered the purpose of life is to live in virtue, in agreement with nature, rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, and fame, leading a simple life free from all possessions. The Cyrenaics promoted a philosophy nearly opposite that of the Cynics, endorsing [[hedonism]], holding that pleasure was the supreme good, especially immediate gratifications; and that people could only know their own experiences, beyond that truth was unknowable.

[[File:Aristotle-Raphael.JPG|thumb|upright|Aristotle in ''[[The School of Athens]]'', by [[Raphael]]]]
The final school of philosophy to be established during the Classical period was the [[Peripatetic school]], founded by Plato's student, [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle wrote widely about topics of philosophical concern, including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, politics, and logic. [[Aristotelian logic]] was the first type of [[logic]] to attempt to categorize every valid [[syllogism]]. His epistemology comprised an early form [[empiricism]].<ref name=":4" /> Aristotle criticized Plato's [[metaphysics]] as being poetic metaphor, with its greatest failing being the lack of an explanation for [[impermanence|change]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

{{Main|Hellenistic philosophy|Ancient Roman philosophy}}

The [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial periods]] saw the continuation of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], and the and emergence of new philosophies, including [[Pyrrhonism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Stoicism]], and [[Neopythagoreanism]]. [[Platonism]] also continued, but came under new interpretations, particularly [[Academic Skepticism]] in the Hellenistic period and [[Neoplatonism]] in the Imperial period. Roman philosophy was heavily influenced by the traditions of Greek philosophy. In Imperial times, Epicureanism and Stoicism were particularly popular.<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/romanphi/ Roman Philosophy (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]</ref>

The various schools of philosophy proposed various and conflicting methods for attaining [[eudaimonia]]. For some schools, it was through internal means, such as calmness, [[Ataraxia|''ataraxia'']] (ἀταραξία), or indifference, [[Apatheia|''apatheia'']] (ἀπάθεια), which was possibly caused by the increased insecurity of the era.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

To bring the mind to ''ataraxia'', Pyrrhonism uses [[Epoché|''epoché'']] ([[suspension of judgment]]) regarding all non-evident propositions. After [[Arcesilaus]] became head of the Academy, he adopted skepticism as a central tenet of [[Platonism]], making Platonism nearly the same as [[Pyrrhonism]].<ref>[[Sextus Empiricus]], "Outlines of Pyrrhonism" I.33.232</ref> After Arcesilaus, Academic Skepticism diverged from Pyrrhonism.<ref>Sextus Empiricus, "Outlines of Pyrrhonism" I.33.225–231</ref> The Academic Skeptics did not doubt the existence of [[truth]]; they just doubted that humans had the capacities for obtaining it.<ref name="Smith:Arcesilaus3">{{SmithDGRBM|article=Arcesilaus}}</ref> They based this position on Plato's ''[[Phaedo (dialogue)|Phaedo]]'', sections 64–67,<ref>http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D64</ref> in which Socrates discusses how knowledge is not accessible to mortals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Veres|first=Máté|year=2009|title=Carlos Lévy, Les Scepticismes; Markus Gabriel, Antike und moderne Skepsis zur Einführung|url=https://www.academia.edu/1774036|journal=Rhizai.

Following the end of the skeptical period of the Academy with [[Antiochus of Ascalon]], Platonic thought entered the period of [[Middle Platonism]], which absorbed ideas from the Peripatetic and Stoic schools.

{{Main|3 = Medieval philosophy}}
{{See also|Christian philosophy}}[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Augustine.]]
Medieval philosophy roughly extends from the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]] until the Renaissance.<ref name="encyclopedia" /> It is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]], and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then-widespread sacred doctrines of [[Abrahamic religion]] ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]) with [[Secularism|secular]] learning. Some problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of [[faith]] to [[reason]], the existence and unity of [[God]], the object of [[theology]] and [[metaphysics]], the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation. 

A prominent figure of this period was [[Augustine of Hippo]], one of the most important [[Church Fathers]] in [[Western Christianity]]. Augustine adopted Plato's thought and Christianized it. His influence dominated medieval philosophy perhaps up to the end of era and the rediscovery of Aristotle's texts. [[Augustinianism]] was the preferred starting point for most philosophers up until the 13th century. Among the issues his philosophy touched upon were the [[problem of evil]], [[Just war theory|just war]] and what [[time]] is. On the problem of evil, he argued that evil was a necessary product of human [[free will]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A. C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0mHDwAAQBAJ|title=The History of Philosophy|date=2019-11-05|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-9848-7875-5|pages=140|language=en}}</ref> When this raised the issue of the incompatibility of free will and [[Omniscience|divine foreknowledge]], both he and [[Boethius]] solved the issue by arguing that God did not see the future, but rather stood outside of time entirely.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

An influential school of thought was that of [[scholasticism]], which is not so much a philosophy or a theology as a [[Philosophical methodology|methodology]], as it places a strong emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]] to extend knowledge by [[inference]] and to resolve [[contradictions]]. Scholastic thought is also known for rigorous conceptual analysis and the careful drawing of distinctions. In the classroom and in writing, it often takes the form of explicit [[disputation]]; a topic drawn from the tradition is broached in the form of a question, oppositional responses are given, a counterproposal is argued and oppositional arguments rebutted. Because of its emphasis on rigorous [[Dialectic|dialectical]] method, scholasticism was eventually applied to many other fields of study.<ref name="cambridgedict">Patte, Daniel.

Cambridge University Press, 2004, 159</ref>  

[[Anselm of Canterbury]] (called the 'father of scholasticism') argued that the existence of God could be irrefutably proved with the logical conclusion apparent in the [[ontological argument]], according to which God is by definition the greatest thing in conceivable, and since an existing thing is greater than a non-existing one, it must be that God exists or is not the greatest thing conceivable (the latter being by definition impossible).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

The medieval tradition of [[scholasticism]] continued to flourish as late as the 17th century, in figures such as [[Francisco Suárez]] and [[John of St. Thomas]].

The Renaissance ("rebirth") was a period of transition between the Middle Ages and modern thought,<ref name="contemporaries" /> in which the recovery of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies in logic, metaphysics, and theology towards eclectic inquiries into morality, philology, and mysticism.<ref name="philosophies">Frederick Copleston, ''A History of Philosophy, Volume III: From Ockham to Suarez'' (The Newman Press, 1953), p. 18: "When one looks at Renaissance philosophy … one is faced at first sight with a rather bewildering assortment of philosophies."</ref><ref name="renaissance3">Brian Copenhaver and Charles Schmitt, ''Renaissance Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 4: "one may identify the hallmark of Renaissance philosophy as an accelerated and enlarged interest, stimulated by newly available texts, in primary sources of Greek and Roman thought that were previously unknown or partially known or little read."</ref> The study of the classics and the humane arts generally, such as history and literature, enjoyed a scholarly interest hitherto unknown in Christendom, a tendency referred to as [[humanism]].<ref name="transmission" /><ref name="naturalistic">Frederick Copleston, ''A History of Philosophy, Volume III: From Ockham to Suarez'' (The Newman Press, 1953), p. 29: "The bulk of Renaissance thinkers, scholars and scientists were, of course, Christians … but none the less the classical revival … helped to bring to the fore a conception of autonomous man or an idea of the development of the human personality, which, though generally Christian, was more 'naturalistic' and less ascetic than the mediaeval conception."</ref> Displacing the medieval interest in metaphysics and logic, the humanists followed [[Petrarch]] in making humanity and its virtues the focus of philosophy.<ref name="intellectual" /><ref name="The Renaissance Philosophy of Man" />

The term "[[modern philosophy]]" has multiple usages.

[[File:Nietzsche187a.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], photograph by Friedrich Hartmann, {{circa|1875}}]]

German philosophy exercised broad influence in this century, owing in part to the dominance of the German [[university]] system.<ref name="universities" /> [[German idealist]]s, such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and the members of [[Jena Romanticism]] ([[Friedrich Hölderlin]], [[Novalis]], and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]]), transformed the work of Kant by maintaining that the world is constituted by a rational or mind-like process, and as such is entirely knowable.<ref name="frederick" /><ref>[[Frederick C. Beiser]], ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781–1801'', Harvard University Press, 2002, p. viii: "the young romantics—Hölderlin, Schlegel, Novalis—[were] crucial figures in the development of German idealism."</ref> [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s identification of this world-constituting process as an irrational [[will to live]] influenced later 19th- and early 20th-century thinking, such as the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

The [[19th-century philosophy|19th century]] took the radical notions of self-organization and intrinsic order from [[Goethean science]] and [[Kantianism|Kantian metaphysics]], and proceeded to produce a long elaboration on the tension between systematization and organic development. Foremost was the work of Hegel, whose ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807) and ''[[Science of Logic]]'' (1813–16) produced a "[[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical]]" framework for ordering of knowledge.

As with the 18th century, developments in science arose from philosophy and also challenged philosophy: most importantly the work of [[Charles Darwin]], which was based on the idea of organic self-regulation found in philosophers such as Smith, but fundamentally challenged established conceptions.

After Hegel's death in 1831, 19th-century philosophy largely turned against idealism in favor of varieties of philosophical [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], such as the [[positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]], the [[empiricism]] of [[John Stuart Mill]], and the [[historical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]]. Logic began a period of its most significant advances since the inception of the discipline, as increasing mathematical precision opened entire fields of inference to formalization in the work of [[George Boole]] and [[Gottlob Frege]].<ref name="transformation" /> Other philosophers who initiated lines of thought that would continue to shape philosophy into the 20th century include:
* [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Henry Sidgwick]], whose work in logic and ethics, respectively, provided the tools for early [[analytic philosophy]].
* [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]], who founded [[pragmatism]].
* [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who laid the groundwork for [[existentialism]] and [[post-structuralism]].

==Contemporary (20th and 21st centuries)==
{{main|20th-century philosophy|Contemporary philosophy}}
[[File:Heidegger_2_(1960).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Martin Heidegger]]
The three major contemporary approaches to academic philosophy are [[analytic philosophy]], [[continental philosophy]] and [[pragmatism]].<ref>Nicholas Joll, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/con-meta/ "Contemporary Metaphilosophy"]</ref> They are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive.

The [[20th-century philosophy|20th century]] deals with the upheavals produced by a series of conflicts within philosophical discourse over the basis of knowledge, with classical certainties overthrown, and new social, economic, scientific and logical problems. 20th century philosophy was set for a series of attempts to reform and preserve, and to alter or abolish, older knowledge systems. Seminal figures include [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. The publication of Husserl's ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' (1900–1) and Russell's ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903) is considered to mark the beginning of 20th-century philosophy.<ref>''Spindel Conference 2002 – 100 Years of Metaethics. The Legacy of G.E. Moore'', University of Memphis, 2003, p. 165.</ref> The 20th century also saw the increasing [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the beginning of the current (contemporary) era of philosophy.<ref>M.E. Waithe (ed.), ''A History of Women Philosophers: Volume IV: Contemporary Women Philosophers, 1900-Today'', Springer, 1995.</ref>

Since the [[Second World War]], contemporary philosophy has been divided mostly into [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[Continental philosophy|continental]] traditions; the former carried in the English speaking world and the latter on the continent of Europe. The perceived conflict between continental and analytic schools of philosophy remains prominent, despite increasing skepticism regarding the distinction's usefulness.

===Analytic philosophy===
{{Main|Analytic philosophy}}
[[File:Bertrand Russell 1954.jpg|left|thumb|Bertrand Russell]]
In the English-speaking world, [[analytic philosophy]] became the dominant school for much of the 20th century. The term "analytic philosophy" roughly designates a group of philosophical methods that stress detailed argumentation, attention to semantics, use of classical logic and non-classical logics and clarity of meaning above all other criteria. Though the movement has broadened, it was a cohesive school in the first half of the century. Analytic philosophers were shaped strongly by [[logical positivism]], united by the notion that philosophical problems could and should be solved by attention to [[logic]] and [[language]].

[[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G. E. Moore]] are also often counted as founders of analytic philosophy, beginning with their rejection of British idealism, their defense of realism and the emphasis they laid on the legitimacy of analysis. Russell's classic works ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'',<ref name="russell" /> "[[On Denoting]]" and ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (with [[Alfred North Whitehead]]), aside from greatly promoting the use of mathematical logic in philosophy, set the ground for much of the research program in the early stages of the analytic tradition, emphasizing such problems as: the reference of proper names, whether 'existence' is a property, the nature of propositions, the analysis of definite descriptions, and discussions on the foundations of mathematics. These works also explored issues of ontological commitment and metaphysical problems regarding time, the nature of matter, mind, persistence and change, which Russell often tackled with the aid of mathematical logic.

[[File:Gottlob_Frege_(Emil_Tesch).png|thumb|[[Gottlob Frege]], {{circa|1905}}]]

[[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' (1884) was the first analytic work, according to [[Michael Dummett]] (''Origins of Analytical Philosophy'', 1993). Frege took "the [[linguistic turn]]," analyzing philosophical problems through language. Some analytic philosophers held that philosophical problems arise through misuse of language or because of misunderstandings of the logic of human language.

In 1921, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who studied under Russell at Cambridge, published his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', which gave a rigidly "logical" account of linguistic and philosophical issues. Years later, he reversed a number of the positions he set out in the ''Tractatus'', in for example his second major work, ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' (1953). ''Investigations'' was influential in the development of "[[ordinary language philosophy]]," which was mainly promoted by [[Gilbert Ryle]] and [[J. L. Austin]].

In the United States, meanwhile, the philosophy of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] was having a major influence, with the paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]". In that paper Quine criticizes the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements, arguing that a clear conception of analyticity is unattainable.
[[File:Patricia_Churchland_at_STEP_2005_a.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Patricia Churchland]], 2005]]
Notable students of Quine include [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[Daniel Dennett]]. The later work of Russell and the philosophy of Willard Van Orman Quine are influential exemplars of the naturalist approach dominant in the second half of the 20th century. But the diversity of analytic philosophy from the 1970s onward defies easy generalization: the naturalism of Quine and his epigoni was in some precincts superseded by a "new metaphysics" of [[possible worlds]], as in the influential work of [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]. Recently, the [[experimental philosophy]] movement has sought to reappraise philosophical problems through social science research techniques.

Some influential figures in contemporary analytic philosophy are: [[Timothy Williamson]], [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], [[John Searle]], [[Thomas Nagel]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Michael Dummett]], [[John McDowell]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Patricia Churchland]].

Analytic philosophy has sometimes been accused of not contributing to the political debate or to traditional questions in aesthetics. However, with the appearance of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' by [[John Rawls]] and ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' by [[Robert Nozick]], analytic political philosophy acquired respectability. Analytic philosophers have also shown depth in their investigations of aesthetics, with [[Roger Scruton]], [[Nelson Goodman]], [[Arthur Danto]] and others developing the subject to its current shape.

[[Continental philosophy]] is a set of 19th- and 20th-century philosophical traditions from mainland Europe. 20th-century movements such as [[German idealism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], [[Hermeneutics#Philosophical hermeneutics|modern hermeneutics]] (the theory and methodology of interpretation), [[critical theory]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]] and others are included within this loose category. While identifying any non-trivial common factor in all these schools of thought is bound to be controversial, Michael E. Rosen has hypothesized a few common continental themes: that the natural sciences cannot replace the human sciences; that the thinker is affected by the conditions of experience (one's place and time in history); that philosophy is both theoretical and practical; that metaphilosophy or reflection upon the methods and nature of philosophy itself is an important part of philosophy proper.<ref>Michael Rosen, "Continental Philosophy from Hegel", in [[A. C. Grayling]] (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'', Oxford University Press (1998), p. 665.</ref>

The founder of phenomenology, [[Edmund Husserl]], sought to study consciousness as experienced from a first-person perspective, while [[Martin Heidegger]] drew on the ideas of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Husserl to propose an unconventional [[existential]] approach to [[ontology]].

Phenomenologically oriented metaphysics undergirded [[existentialism]]—[[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Albert Camus]]—and finally [[post-structuralism]]—[[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] (best known for his articulation of [[postmodernism]]), [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]] (best known for developing a form of [[semiotic]] analysis known as [[deconstruction]]). The [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] work of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Julia Kristeva]], and others has also been influential in contemporary continental thought. Conversely, some philosophers have attempted to define and rehabilitate older traditions of philosophy. Most notably, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] have both, albeit in different ways, revived the tradition of [[Aristotelianism]].

====Existentialism====
{{Main|Existentialism}}
[[Existentialism]] is a term applied to the work of a number of late 19th- and 20th-century philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences,<ref name="existentialism" /><ref name="philosophy25">''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Ted Honderich, New York (1995), page 259.</ref> shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject—not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual.<ref name="existentialism26" /> In existentialism, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called "the existential attitude", or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.<ref name="existentialism27" /> Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.<ref name="existentialism28" /><ref name="existentialism29" />

Although they did not use the term, the 19th-century philosophers [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] are widely regarded as the fathers of existentialism. Their influence, however, has extended beyond existentialist thought.<ref name="kierkegaard" /><ref name="Bob" /><ref name="existentialists" />

====German idealism====
{{Main|German idealism}}
{{See also|British idealism|American idealism}}
[[File:Immanuel_Kant_(painted_portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Immanuel Kant]], {{circa|1790}}]]
[[German idealism]] emerged in Germany in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It developed out of the work of [[Immanuel Kant]] in the 1780s and 1790s.<ref>[[Frederick C. Beiser]], ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781–1801'', Harvard University Press, 2002, part I.</ref>

[[Transcendental idealism]], advocated by Immanuel Kant, is the view that there are limits on what can be understood, since there is much that cannot be brought under the conditions of objective judgment. Kant wrote his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781) in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting approaches of rationalism and empiricism, and to establish a new groundwork for studying metaphysics. Although Kant held that objective knowledge of the world required the mind to impose a [[Conceptual framework|conceptual]] or [[categorical framework]] on the stream of pure sensory data—a framework including space and time themselves—he maintained that [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] existed independently of human perceptions and judgments; he was therefore not an idealist in any simple sense. Kant's account of things-in-themselves is both controversial and highly complex. Continuing his work, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]] dispensed with belief in the independent existence of the world, and created a thoroughgoing idealist philosophy.

The most notable work of [[absolute idealism]] was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]'s ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', of 1807. Hegel admitted his ideas were not new, but that all the previous philosophies had been incomplete. His goal was to correctly finish their job. Hegel asserts that the twin aims of philosophy are to account for the contradictions apparent in human experience (which arise, for instance, out of the supposed contradictions between "being" and "not being"), and also simultaneously to resolve and preserve these contradictions by showing their compatibility at a higher level of examination ("being" and "not being" are resolved with "becoming"). This program of acceptance and reconciliation of contradictions is known as the "[[Hegelian dialectic]]".

Philosophers influenced by Hegel include [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], who coined the term "projection" as pertaining to humans' inability to recognize anything in the external world without projecting qualities of ourselves upon those things; [[Karl Marx]]; [[Friedrich Engels]]; and the [[British idealism|British idealists]], notably [[T. H. Green]], [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], [[F. H. Bradley]], and [[R. G. Collingwood]].

Few 20th-century philosophers embraced the core tenets of German idealism after the demise of British idealism. However, quite a few have embraced Hegelian dialectic, most notably [[Frankfurt School]] [[critical theorist]]s, [[Alexandre Kojève]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (in his ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''), and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. A central theme of German idealism, the legitimacy of Kant's "[[Copernican Revolution#Immanuel Kant|Copernican revolution]]", remains an important point of contention in 21st-century [[post-continental philosophy]].

====Marxism and critical theory====
{{Main|Marxism|critical theory}}
[[Marxism]] is a method of socioeconomic analysis, originating from [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. It analyzes [[Social class|class relations]] and societal conflict using a [[Historical materialism|materialist interpretation of historical development]] and a [[Marxist dialectic|dialectical view]] of social transformation. Marxist analyses and methodologies influenced political ideologies and social movements. Marxist understandings of history and society were adopted by academics in archeology, anthropology, media studies, political science, theater, history, sociology, art history and theory, cultural studies, education, economics, geography, literary criticism, aesthetics, critical psychology and philosophy.

In contemporary philosophy, the term "critical theory" describes the [[Western Marxism|Western Marxist philosophy]] of the [[Frankfurt School]], which was developed in Germany in the 1930s. Critical theory maintains that [[ideology]] is the principal obstacle to human [[emancipation]].<ref>Geuss, R. ''The Idea of a Critical Theory'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, ch. 4.</ref>

====Phenomenology and hermeneutics====
{{Main|Phenomenology (philosophy)|Hermeneutics}}
[[File:Edmund_Husserl_1910s.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Edmund Husserl]], in the 1910s]]
[[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] was an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for an account of the structure of conscious experience in general.<ref name="Smith" /> An important part of Husserl's phenomenological project was to show that all conscious acts are directed at or about objective content, a feature that Husserl called ''[[intentionality]]''.<ref name="Dreyfus" /> Husserl published only a few works in his lifetime, which treat phenomenology mainly in abstract methodological terms; but he left an enormous quantity of unpublished concrete analyses. Husserl's work was immediately influential in Germany, with the foundation of phenomenological schools in Munich ([[Munich phenomenology]]) and Göttingen (Göttingen phenomenology). Phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work of such philosophers as [[Martin Heidegger]] (formerly Husserl's research assistant and a proponent of [[hermeneutic phenomenology]], a theoretical [[:wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of [[Hermeneutics#Philosophical hermeneutics|modern hermeneutics]] and phenomenology), [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Through the work of Heidegger and Sartre, Husserl's focus on subjective experience influenced aspects of existentialism.

====Structuralism and post-structuralism====
{{Main|Structuralism|Post-structuralism}}
[[File:Ferdinand_de_Saussure.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]]]]

Inaugurated by the linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[structuralism]] sought to clarify systems of signs through analyzing the [[discourse]]s they both limit and make possible. Saussure conceived of the sign as being delimited by all the other signs in the system, and ideas as being incapable of existence prior to linguistic structure, which articulates thought. This led continental thought away from humanism, and toward what was termed the decentering of man: language is no longer spoken by man to express a true inner self, but language speaks man.

Structuralism sought the province of a hard science, but its positivism soon came under fire by post-structuralism, a wide field of thinkers, some of whom were once themselves structuralists, but later came to criticize it. Structuralists believed they could analyze systems from an external, objective standing, for example, but the poststructuralists argued that this is incorrect, that one cannot transcend structures and thus analysis is itself determined by what it examines. While the distinction between the signifier and signified was treated as crystalline by structuralists, poststructuralists asserted that every attempt to grasp the signified results in more signifiers, so meaning is always in a state of being deferred, making an ultimate interpretation impossible.

Structuralism came to dominate continental philosophy throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, encompassing thinkers as diverse as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jacques Lacan]]. Post-structuralism came to predominate from the 1970s onwards, including thinkers such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and even [[Roland Barthes]]; it incorporated a critique of structuralism's limitations.

===Pragmatism===
{{Main|Pragmatism}}
[[Pragmatism]] is a philosophical tradition that began in the United States around 1870.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pragmatism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/|access-date=13 September 2013|date=13 September 2013}}</ref> It asserts that the truth of beliefs consists in their usefulness and efficacy rather than their correspondence with reality.<ref name="Rorty" /> [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] were its co-founders and it was later modified by [[John Dewey]] as [[instrumentalism]]. Since the usefulness of any belief at any time might be contingent on circumstance, Peirce and James conceptualized final truth as something established only by the future, final settlement of all opinion.<ref name="Putnam"/>

[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William James]] in 1906]]
Pragmatism attempted to find a scientific concept of truth that does not depend on personal insight (revelation) or reference to some metaphysical realm. It interpreted the meaning of a statement by the effect its acceptance would have on practice. Inquiry taken far enough is thus the only path to truth.<ref>Peirce, C. S. (1878), "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, 286–302. Reprinted often, including ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 388–410 and ''Essential Peirce'' v. 1, 124–41. See end of §II for the pragmatic maxim. See third and fourth paragraphs in §IV for the discoverability of truth and the real by sufficient investigation. Also see quotes from Peirce from across the years in the entries for [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/truth.html "Truth"] and [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/pragmatismmaxim.html "Pragmatism, Maxim of..."] in the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, editors, University of Helsinki.</ref>

For Peirce commitment to inquiry was essential to truth-finding, implied by the idea and hope that inquiry is not fruitless. The interpretation of these principles has been subject to discussion ever since. Peirce's [[Pragmatic maxim|maxim of pragmatism]] is, "Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object."<ref name="paragraphs" />

Critics accused pragmatism falling victim to a simple fallacy: that because something that is true proves useful, that usefulness is an appropriate basis for its truthfulness.<ref name="Pratt"/> Pragmatist thinkers include Dewey, [[George Santayana]], and [[Clarence Irving Lewis|C. I. Lewis]].

Pragmatism was later worked on by [[neopragmatist]]s [[Richard Rorty]] who was the first to develop neopragmatist philosophy in his ''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]'' (1979),<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/pragmati/ Pragmatism – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref> [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]], and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]. Neopragmatism has been described as a bridge between analytic and continental philosophy.<ref>William Egginton/[[Mike Sandbothe]] (eds.). ''The Pragmatic Turn in Philosophy. Contemporary Engagement between Analytic and Continental Thought.'' SUNY Press. 2004. Back cover.</ref>

===Process philosophy===
{{Main|Process philosophy}}
[[Process philosophy]] is a tradition beginning with [[Alfred North Whitehead]], who began teaching and writing on process and metaphysics when he joined [[Harvard University]] in 1924.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/|title= Alfred North Whitehead (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)}}</ref> This tradition identifies metaphysical [[reality]] with [[Change (philosophy)|change]].

Process philosophy is sometimes classified as closer to continental philosophy than analytic philosophy, because it is usually only taught in continental departments.<ref>William Blattner, [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html "Some Thoughts About "Continental" and "Analytic" Philosophy"]</ref> However, other sources state that process philosophy should be placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic versus continental methods in contemporary philosophy.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Seibt |first=Johanna}}</ref><ref>Nicholas Gaskill, A.J. Nocek, ''The Lure of Whitehead'', University of Minnesota Press, 2014, p. 4: "it is no wonder that Whitehead fell by the wayside. He was too scientific for the "continentals," not scientific enough for the "analytics," and too metaphysical—which is to say [[Critical philosophy|uncritical]]—for them both" and p. 231: "the analytics and continentals are both inclined toward [[Kantianism|Kantian]] presuppositions in a manner that Latour and Whitehead brazenly renounce."</ref>

== Influence by non-Western philosophy ==

=== Eastern philosophy ===

==== Pyrrhonism ====
{{main|Similarities between Pyrrhonism and Buddhism}}
The [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosopher]] [[Pyrrho]] accompanied [[Alexander the Great]] in his eastern campaigns, spending about 18 months in India. Pyrrho subsequently returned to Greece and founded [[Pyrrhonism]], a philosophy with substantial [[Similarities between Pyrrhonism and Buddhism|similarities with Buddhism]]. The Greek biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]] explained that Pyrrho's equanimity and detachment from the world were acquired in India.<ref>"He would withdraw from the world and live in solitude, rarely showing himself to his relatives; this is because he had heard an Indian reproach [[Anaxarchus]], telling him that he would never be able to teach others what is good while he himself danced attendance on kings in their court. He would maintain the same composure at all times." (Diogenes Laertius, IX.63 on Pyrrhon)</ref> Pyrrho was directly influenced by Buddhism in developing his philosophy, which is based on Pyrrho's interpretation of the Buddhist [[three marks of existence]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Beckwith|first=Christopher I.|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10500.pdf|title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2015|isbn=9781400866328|page=28}}</ref> According to [[Edward Conze]], Pyrrhonism can be compared to Buddhist philosophy, especially the Indian [[Madhyamika]] school.<ref name="Conze">Conze, Edward. [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/conze2.htm Buddhist Philosophy and Its European Parallels]. Philosophy East and West 13, p.9-23, no.1, January 1963. University press of Hawaii.</ref> The Pyrrhonists' goal of [[ataraxia]] (the state of being untroubled) is a [[soteriological]] goal similar to [[nirvana]]. The Pyrrhonists promoted suspending judgm ient ([[epoché]]) about [[dogma]] (beliefs about non-evident matters) as the way to reach ataraxia. This is similar to the Buddha's refusal to answer [[The unanswered questions|certain metaphysical questions]] which he saw as non-conductive to the path of Buddhist practice and [[Nagarjuna]]'s "relinquishing of all views ([[drsti]])". Adrian Kuzminski argues for direct influence between these two systems of thought. In ''Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism''<ref name="Reinvented">Adrian Kuzminski (2008), ''Pyrrhonism How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism''; for a recent study see Georgios T . Halkias, [https://www.academia.edu/12679460/The_Self-immolation_of_Kalanos_and_other_Luminous_Encounters_Among_Greeks_and_Indian_Buddhists_in_the_Hellenistic_World "The Self-immolation of Kalanos and other Luminous Encounters among Greeks and Indian Buddhists in the Hellenistic World"], 2015, ''Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies'' '''8''', 163–186.</ref> According to Kuzminski, both philosophies argue against assenting to any dogmatic assertions about an ultimate metaphysical reality behind our sense impressions as a tactic to reach tranquility and both also make use of logical arguments against other philosophies in order to expose their contradictions.<ref name="Reinvented" />

==== Cyrenaicism ====
The [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaic]] philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]] is thought by some to have been influenced by the teachings of Ashoka's Buddhist missionaries.<ref>"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene (nicknamed ''Peisithanatos'', "The advocate of death") was a contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and Alexandria. His influence was such that he was ultimately prohibited from teaching." Jean-Marie Lafont, [[Inalco]] in "Les Dossiers d'Archéologie", No. 254, p. 78</ref>

'''Western philosophy''' refers to the [[philosophy|philosophical]] thought and work of the [[Western world]]. Historically, the term refers to the philosophical thinking of [[Western culture]], beginning with the [[ancient Greek philosophy]] of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]]. The word ''philosophy'' itself originated from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''philosophía'' (φιλοσοφία), literally, "the love of wisdom" (φιλεῖν ''phileîn'', "to love" and σοφία ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|sophía]]'', "wisdom").

== Ancient ==
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}The scope of ancient Western philosophy included the problems of philosophy as they are understood today; but it also included many other disciplines, such as [[pure mathematics]] and [[natural science]]s such as [[physics]], [[astronomy]], and [[biology]] ([[Aristotle]], for example, wrote on all of these topics).

=== Pre-Socratics ===
{{Main|Pre-Socratic philosophy}}The pre-Socratic philosophers were interested in [[cosmology]]; the nature and origin of the universe, while rejecting [[Greek mythology|mythical answers]] to such questions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A. C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDJwDwAAQBAJ|title=The History of Philosophy|date=2019-06-20|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-0-241-98086-6|pages=11|language=en}}</ref> They were specifically interested in the ''[[arche]]'' (the cause or first principle) of the world. The first recognized philosopher, [[Thales of Miletus]] (born ca. 625 BCE in [[Ionia]]) identified water as the arche (claiming "all is water"). His use of observation and reason to derive this conclusion is the reason for distinguishing him as the first philosopher.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A. C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDJwDwAAQBAJ|title=The History of Philosophy|date=2019-06-20|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-0-241-98086-6|pages=12|language=en}}</ref> Thales' student [[Anaximander]] claimed that the ''arche'' was the ''[[apeiron]]'', the [[Infinity|infinite]]. Following both Thales and Anaximander, [[Anaximenes of Miletus]] claimed that [[Air (classical element)|air]] was the most suitable candidate.[[File:Turkey_ancient_region_map_ionia.JPG|right|thumb|[[Ionia]], source of early Greek philosophy, in western [[Asia Minor]]]][[Pythagoras]] (born ca. 570 BCE), from the island of [[Samos]] off the coast of Ionia, later lived in [[Crotone|Croton]] in southern Italy ([[Magna Graecia]]). [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] hold that "all is number", giving ''formal'' accounts in contrast to the previous ''material'' of the Ionians. The discovery of consonant [[Interval (music)|intervals]] in music by the group enabled the concept of ''harmony'' to be established in philosophy, which suggested that opposites could together give rise to new things.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling, A. C.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1054371393|title=The history of philosophy|year=2019|isbn=978-1-9848-7874-8|location=New York|pages=23|oclc=1054371393}}</ref> They also believed in [[metempsychosis]], the transmigration of souls, or [[reincarnation]].

[[Parmenides]] argued that, unlike the other philosophers who believed the ''arche'' was transformed into multiple things, the world must be singular, unchanging and eternal, while anything suggesting the contrary was an illusion.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A. C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDJwDwAAQBAJ|title=The History of Philosophy|date=2019-06-20|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=978-0-241-98086-6|pages=32|language=en}}</ref> [[Zeno of Elea]] formulated his [[Zeno's paradoxes|famous paradoxes]] in order to support the Parmenides' views about the illusion of plurality and change (in terms of motion), by demonstrating them to be impossible.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

These in turn were acted upon by the forces of Love and Strife, creating the mixtures of elements which form the world.<ref name=":1" /> Another view of the ''arche'' being acted upon by an external force was presented by his older contemporary [[Anaxagoras]], who claimed that ''[[nous]],'' the [[mind]], was responsible for that.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

In addition to these philosophers, the [[Sophist|Sophists]] comprised teachers of rhetoric who taught students to debate on any side of an issue. While as a group, they held no specific views, in general they promoted  [[subjectivism]] and [[relativism]]. [[Protagoras]], one of the most influential Sophist philosophers, claimed that "man is the measure of all things", suggesting there is no objective truth.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

The Classical period of ancient Greek philosophy centers on [[Socrates]] and the two generations of students following him. 

Socrates experienced a life-changing event when his friend, [[Chaerephon]] visited the [[Oracle of Delphi]] where the [[Pythia]] told him that [[List_of_oracular_statements_from_Delphi#440_BC|no one in Athens was wiser than Socrates]]. Learning of this, Socrates subsequently spent much of his life questioning anyone in Athens who would engage him, in order to investigate the Pithia's claim.<ref>West, Thomas G., and Platon. ''Plato's Apology of Socrates: an interpretation, with a new translation''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1979.</ref> Socrates developed a critical approach, now called the [[Socratic method]], to examine people's views. He focused on issues of human life: [[eudaimonia]], [[justice]], [[beauty]], [[truth]], and [[virtue]]. Although Socrates wrote nothing himself, two of his disciples, [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]], wrote about some of his conversations, although Plato also deployed [[Socratic problem|Socrates as a fictional character]] in some of his dialogues. These [[Socratic dialogue]]s display the Socratic method being applied to examine philosophical problems.

Socrates's questioning earned him enemies who eventually accused him of impiety and corrupting the youth. He was tried by the Athenian democracy, was found guilty, and was sentenced to death. Although his friends offered to help him escape from prison, Socrates chose to remain in Athens and abide by his principles. His execution consisted of drinking poison [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]]. He died in 399 BC.

After Socrates' death, Plato founded the [[Platonic Academy]] and [[Platonism|Platonic philosophy]]. As Socrates had done, Plato identified [[virtue]] with [[knowledge]]. This led him to questions of [[epistemology]] on what knowledge is and how it is acquired.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

He thought that knowledge had to be sourced from eternal, unchanging, and perfect objects, which led to his [[theory of forms]].<ref name=":3" /> [[Alfred North Whitehead]] claimed that "Philosophy is footnotes to Plato".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evangeliou|first=Christos C.|date=2001|title=European Philosophy: Simply a Series of Footnotes to Plato?|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41166929|journal=Mediterranean Studies|volume=10|pages=167–180|jstor=41166929|issn=1074-164X}}</ref>

Socrates had several other students who also founded schools of philosophy. Two of these were short-lived: the [[Eretrian school]], founded by [[Phaedo of Elis]], and the [[Megarian school]], founded by [[Euclid of Megara]]. Two others were long-lasting: [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], founded by [[Antisthenes]], and [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaicism]], founded by [[Aristippus]]. The Cynics considered the purpose of life is to live in virtue, in agreement with nature, rejecting all conventional desires for wealth, power, and fame, leading a simple life free from all possessions. The Cyrenaics promoted a philosophy nearly opposite that of the Cynics, endorsing [[hedonism]], holding that pleasure was the supreme good, especially immediate gratifications; and that people could only know their own experiences, beyond that truth was unknowable.

The final school of philosophy to be established during the Classical period was the [[Peripatetic school]], founded by Plato's student, [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle wrote widely about topics of philosophical concern, including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, politics, and logic. [[Aristotelian logic]] was the first type of [[logic]] to attempt to categorize every valid [[syllogism]]. His epistemology comprised an early form [[empiricism]].<ref name=":4" /> Aristotle criticized Plato's [[metaphysics]] as being poetic metaphor, with its greatest failing being the lack of an explanation for [[impermanence|change]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

{{Main|Hellenistic philosophy|Ancient Roman philosophy}}

The [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial periods]] saw the continuation of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], and the and emergence of new philosophies, including [[Pyrrhonism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Stoicism]], and [[Neopythagoreanism]]. [[Platonism]] also continued, but came under new interpretations, particularly [[Academic Skepticism]] in the Hellenistic period and [[Neoplatonism]] in the Imperial period. Roman philosophy was heavily influenced by the traditions of Greek philosophy. In Imperial times, Epicureanism and Stoicism were particularly popular.<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/romanphi/ Roman Philosophy (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]</ref>

The various schools of philosophy proposed various and conflicting methods for attaining [[eudaimonia]]. For some schools, it was through internal means, such as calmness, [[Ataraxia|''ataraxia'']] (ἀταραξία), or indifference, [[Apatheia|''apatheia'']] (ἀπάθεια), which was possibly caused by the increased insecurity of the era.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

After [[Arcesilaus]] became head of the Academy, he adopted skepticism as a central tenet of [[Platonism]], making Platonism nearly the same as [[Pyrrhonism]].<ref>[[Sextus Empiricus]], "Outlines of Pyrrhonism" I.33.232</ref> After Arcesilaus, Academic Skepticism diverged from Pyrrhonism.<ref>Sextus Empiricus, "Outlines of Pyrrhonism" I.33.225–231</ref> The Academic Skeptics did not doubt the existence of [[truth]]; they just doubted that humans had the capacities for obtaining it.<ref name="Smith:Arcesilaus3">{{SmithDGRBM|article=Arcesilaus}}</ref> They based this position on Plato's ''[[Phaedo (dialogue)|Phaedo]]'', sections 64–67,<ref>http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D64</ref> in which Socrates discusses how knowledge is not accessible to mortals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Veres|first=Máté|year=2009|title=Carlos Lévy, Les Scepticismes; Markus Gabriel, Antike und moderne Skepsis zur Einführung|url=https://www.academia.edu/1774036|journal=Rhizai.

Following the end of the skeptical period of the Academy with [[Antiochus of Ascalon]], Platonic thought entered the period of [[Middle Platonism]], which absorbed ideas from the Peripatetic and Stoic schools.

{{See also|Christian philosophy}}[[File:Saint Augustine by Philippe de Champaigne.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Augustine.]]
Medieval philosophy roughly extends from the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]] until the Renaissance.<ref name="encyclopedia" /> It is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]], and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then-widespread sacred doctrines of [[Abrahamic religion]] ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]) with [[Secularism|secular]] learning. Some problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of [[faith]] to [[reason]], the existence and unity of [[God]], the object of [[theology]] and [[metaphysics]], the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation. 

A prominent figure of this period was [[Augustine of Hippo]], one of the most important [[Church Fathers]] in [[Western Christianity]]. Augustine adopted Plato's thought and Christianized it. His influence dominated medieval philosophy perhaps up to the end of era and the rediscovery of Aristotle's texts. [[Augustinianism]] was the preferred starting point for most philosophers up until the 13th century. Among the issues his philosophy touched upon were the [[problem of evil]], [[Just war theory|just war]] and what [[time]] is. On the problem of evil, he argued that evil was a necessary product of human [[free will]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A. C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b0mHDwAAQBAJ|title=The History of Philosophy|date=2019-11-05|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-9848-7875-5|pages=140|language=en}}</ref> When this raised the issue of the incompatibility of free will and [[Omniscience|divine foreknowledge]], both he and [[Boethius]] solved the issue by arguing that God did not see the future, but rather stood outside of time entirely.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

An influential school of thought was that of [[scholasticism]], which is not so much a philosophy or a theology as a [[Philosophical methodology|methodology]], as it places a strong emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]] to extend knowledge by [[inference]] and to resolve [[contradictions]]. Scholastic thought is also known for rigorous conceptual analysis and the careful drawing of distinctions. In the classroom and in writing, it often takes the form of explicit [[disputation]]; a topic drawn from the tradition is broached in the form of a question, oppositional responses are given, a counterproposal is argued and oppositional arguments rebutted. Because of its emphasis on rigorous [[Dialectic|dialectical]] method, scholasticism was eventually applied to many other fields of study.<ref name="cambridgedict">Patte, Daniel.

Cambridge University Press, 2004, 159</ref>  

[[Anselm of Canterbury]] (called the 'father of scholasticism') argued that the existence of God could be irrefutably proved with the logical conclusion apparent in the [[ontological argument]], according to which God is by definition the greatest thing in conceivable, and since an existing thing is greater than a non-existing one, it must be that God exists or is not the greatest thing conceivable (the latter being by definition impossible).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grayling|first=A.

The medieval tradition of [[scholasticism]] continued to flourish as late as the 17th century, in figures such as [[Francisco Suárez]] and [[John of St. Thomas]].

'''Late modern philosophy'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> is usually considered to begin around the pivotal year of 1781, when [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] died and [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' appeared.<ref>[[Karl Ameriks]], ''Kant's Elliptical Path'', Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 307: "The phenomenon of ''late modern philosophy'' can be said to have begun right around the pivotal year of 1781, when Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason'' appeared.

[[File:Nietzsche187a.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], photograph by Friedrich Hartmann, {{circa|1875}}]]

German philosophy exercised broad influence in this century, owing in part to the dominance of the German [[university]] system.<ref name="universities" /> [[German idealist]]s, such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and the members of [[Jena Romanticism]] ([[Friedrich Hölderlin]], [[Novalis]], and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]]), transformed the work of Kant by maintaining that the world is constituted by a rational or mind-like process, and as such is entirely knowable.<ref name="frederick" /><ref>[[Frederick C. Beiser]], ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781–1801'', Harvard University Press, 2002, p. viii: "the young romantics—Hölderlin, Schlegel, Novalis—[were] crucial figures in the development of German idealism."</ref> [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s identification of this world-constituting process as an irrational [[will to live]] influenced later 19th- and early 20th-century thinking, such as the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

The [[19th-century philosophy|19th century]] took the radical notions of self-organization and intrinsic order from [[Goethean science]] and [[Kantianism|Kantian metaphysics]], and proceeded to produce a long elaboration on the tension between systematization and organic development. Foremost was the work of Hegel, whose ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807) and ''[[Science of Logic]]'' (1813–16) produced a "[[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical]]" framework for ordering of knowledge.

As with the 18th century, developments in science arose from philosophy and also challenged philosophy: most importantly the work of [[Charles Darwin]], which was based on the idea of organic self-regulation found in philosophers such as Smith, but fundamentally challenged established conceptions.

After Hegel's death in 1831, 19th-century philosophy largely turned against idealism in favor of varieties of philosophical [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], such as the [[positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]], the [[empiricism]] of [[John Stuart Mill]], and the [[historical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]]. Logic began a period of its most significant advances since the inception of the discipline, as increasing mathematical precision opened entire fields of inference to formalization in the work of [[George Boole]] and [[Gottlob Frege]].<ref name="transformation" /> Other philosophers who initiated lines of thought that would continue to shape philosophy into the 20th century include:
* [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Henry Sidgwick]], whose work in logic and ethics, respectively, provided the tools for early [[analytic philosophy]].
* [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]], who founded [[pragmatism]].
* [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who laid the groundwork for [[existentialism]] and [[post-structuralism]].

==Contemporary (20th and 21st centuries)==
{{main|20th-century philosophy|Contemporary philosophy}}
[[File:Heidegger_2_(1960).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Martin Heidegger]]
The three major contemporary approaches to academic philosophy are [[analytic philosophy]], [[continental philosophy]] and [[pragmatism]].<ref>Nicholas Joll, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/con-meta/ "Contemporary Metaphilosophy"]</ref> They are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive.

The [[20th-century philosophy|20th century]] deals with the upheavals produced by a series of conflicts within philosophical discourse over the basis of knowledge, with classical certainties overthrown, and new social, economic, scientific and logical problems. 20th century philosophy was set for a series of attempts to reform and preserve, and to alter or abolish, older knowledge systems. Seminal figures include [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. The publication of Husserl's ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'' (1900–1) and Russell's ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903) is considered to mark the beginning of 20th-century philosophy.<ref>''Spindel Conference 2002 – 100 Years of Metaethics. The Legacy of G.E. Moore'', University of Memphis, 2003, p. 165.</ref> The 20th century also saw the increasing [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the beginning of the current (contemporary) era of philosophy.<ref>M.E. Waithe (ed.), ''A History of Women Philosophers: Volume IV: Contemporary Women Philosophers, 1900-Today'', Springer, 1995.</ref>

Since the [[Second World War]], contemporary philosophy has been divided mostly into [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[Continental philosophy|continental]] traditions; the former carried in the English speaking world and the latter on the continent of Europe. The perceived conflict between continental and analytic schools of philosophy remains prominent, despite increasing skepticism regarding the distinction's usefulness.

===Analytic philosophy===
{{Main|Analytic philosophy}}
[[File:Bertrand Russell 1954.jpg|left|thumb|Bertrand Russell]]
In the English-speaking world, [[analytic philosophy]] became the dominant school for much of the 20th century. The term "analytic philosophy" roughly designates a group of philosophical methods that stress detailed argumentation, attention to semantics, use of classical logic and non-classical logics and clarity of meaning above all other criteria. Though the movement has broadened, it was a cohesive school in the first half of the century. Analytic philosophers were shaped strongly by [[logical positivism]], united by the notion that philosophical problems could and should be solved by attention to [[logic]] and [[language]].

[[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G. E. Moore]] are also often counted as founders of analytic philosophy, beginning with their rejection of British idealism, their defense of realism and the emphasis they laid on the legitimacy of analysis. Russell's classic works ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'',<ref name="russell" /> "[[On Denoting]]" and ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (with [[Alfred North Whitehead]]), aside from greatly promoting the use of mathematical logic in philosophy, set the ground for much of the research program in the early stages of the analytic tradition, emphasizing such problems as: the reference of proper names, whether 'existence' is a property, the nature of propositions, the analysis of definite descriptions, and discussions on the foundations of mathematics. These works also explored issues of ontological commitment and metaphysical problems regarding time, the nature of matter, mind, persistence and change, which Russell often tackled with the aid of mathematical logic.

[[File:Gottlob_Frege_(Emil_Tesch).png|thumb|[[Gottlob Frege]], {{circa|1905}}]]

[[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' (1884) was the first analytic work, according to [[Michael Dummett]] (''Origins of Analytical Philosophy'', 1993). Frege took "the [[linguistic turn]]," analyzing philosophical problems through language. Some analytic philosophers held that philosophical problems arise through misuse of language or because of misunderstandings of the logic of human language.

In 1921, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who studied under Russell at Cambridge, published his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', which gave a rigidly "logical" account of linguistic and philosophical issues. Years later, he reversed a number of the positions he set out in the ''Tractatus'', in for example his second major work, ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' (1953). ''Investigations'' was influential in the development of "[[ordinary language philosophy]]," which was mainly promoted by [[Gilbert Ryle]] and [[J. L. Austin]].

In the United States, meanwhile, the philosophy of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] was having a major influence, with the paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]". In that paper Quine criticizes the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements, arguing that a clear conception of analyticity is unattainable.
[[File:Patricia_Churchland_at_STEP_2005_a.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Patricia Churchland]], 2005]]
Notable students of Quine include [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[Daniel Dennett]]. The later work of Russell and the philosophy of Willard Van Orman Quine are influential exemplars of the naturalist approach dominant in the second half of the 20th century. But the diversity of analytic philosophy from the 1970s onward defies easy generalization: the naturalism of Quine and his epigoni was in some precincts superseded by a "new metaphysics" of [[possible worlds]], as in the influential work of [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]. Recently, the [[experimental philosophy]] movement has sought to reappraise philosophical problems through social science research techniques.

Some influential figures in contemporary analytic philosophy are: [[Timothy Williamson]], [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], [[John Searle]], [[Thomas Nagel]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Michael Dummett]], [[John McDowell]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Patricia Churchland]].

Analytic philosophy has sometimes been accused of not contributing to the political debate or to traditional questions in aesthetics. However, with the appearance of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' by [[John Rawls]] and ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' by [[Robert Nozick]], analytic political philosophy acquired respectability. Analytic philosophers have also shown depth in their investigations of aesthetics, with [[Roger Scruton]], [[Nelson Goodman]], [[Arthur Danto]] and others developing the subject to its current shape.

===Continental philosophy===

[[Continental philosophy]] is a set of 19th- and 20th-century philosophical traditions from mainland Europe. 20th-century movements such as [[German idealism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], [[Hermeneutics#Philosophical hermeneutics|modern hermeneutics]] (the theory and methodology of interpretation), [[critical theory]], [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]] and others are included within this loose category. While identifying any non-trivial common factor in all these schools of thought is bound to be controversial, Michael E. Rosen has hypothesized a few common continental themes: that the natural sciences cannot replace the human sciences; that the thinker is affected by the conditions of experience (one's place and time in history); that philosophy is both theoretical and practical; that metaphilosophy or reflection upon the methods and nature of philosophy itself is an important part of philosophy proper.<ref>Michael Rosen, "Continental Philosophy from Hegel", in [[A. C. Grayling]] (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'', Oxford University Press (1998), p. 665.</ref>

The founder of phenomenology, [[Edmund Husserl]], sought to study consciousness as experienced from a first-person perspective, while [[Martin Heidegger]] drew on the ideas of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Husserl to propose an unconventional [[existential]] approach to [[ontology]].

Phenomenologically oriented metaphysics undergirded [[existentialism]]—[[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Albert Camus]]—and finally [[post-structuralism]]—[[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] (best known for his articulation of [[postmodernism]]), [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]] (best known for developing a form of [[semiotic]] analysis known as [[deconstruction]]). The [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] work of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Julia Kristeva]], and others has also been influential in contemporary continental thought. Conversely, some philosophers have attempted to define and rehabilitate older traditions of philosophy. Most notably, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] have both, albeit in different ways, revived the tradition of [[Aristotelianism]].

[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Søren Kierkegaard]], sketch by [[Niels Christian Kierkegaard]], {{circa|1840}}]]

====Existentialism====
{{Main|Existentialism}}
[[Existentialism]] is a term applied to the work of a number of late 19th- and 20th-century philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences,<ref name="existentialism" /><ref name="philosophy25">''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Ted Honderich, New York (1995), page 259.</ref> shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject—not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual.<ref name="existentialism26" /> In existentialism, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called "the existential attitude", or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.<ref name="existentialism27" /> Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.<ref name="existentialism28" /><ref name="existentialism29" />

Although they did not use the term, the 19th-century philosophers [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] are widely regarded as the fathers of existentialism. Their influence, however, has extended beyond existentialist thought.<ref name="kierkegaard" /><ref name="Bob" /><ref name="existentialists" />

====German idealism====
{{Main|German idealism}}
{{See also|British idealism|American idealism}}
[[File:Immanuel_Kant_(painted_portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Immanuel Kant]], {{circa|1790}}]]
[[German idealism]] emerged in Germany in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It developed out of the work of [[Immanuel Kant]] in the 1780s and 1790s.<ref>[[Frederick C. Beiser]], ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781–1801'', Harvard University Press, 2002, part I.</ref>

[[Transcendental idealism]], advocated by Immanuel Kant, is the view that there are limits on what can be understood, since there is much that cannot be brought under the conditions of objective judgment. Kant wrote his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781) in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting approaches of rationalism and empiricism, and to establish a new groundwork for studying metaphysics. Although Kant held that objective knowledge of the world required the mind to impose a [[Conceptual framework|conceptual]] or [[categorical framework]] on the stream of pure sensory data—a framework including space and time themselves—he maintained that [[Thing-in-itself|things-in-themselves]] existed independently of human perceptions and judgments; he was therefore not an idealist in any simple sense. Kant's account of things-in-themselves is both controversial and highly complex. Continuing his work, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]] dispensed with belief in the independent existence of the world, and created a thoroughgoing idealist philosophy.

The most notable work of [[absolute idealism]] was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]'s ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', of 1807. Hegel admitted his ideas were not new, but that all the previous philosophies had been incomplete. His goal was to correctly finish their job. Hegel asserts that the twin aims of philosophy are to account for the contradictions apparent in human experience (which arise, for instance, out of the supposed contradictions between "being" and "not being"), and also simultaneously to resolve and preserve these contradictions by showing their compatibility at a higher level of examination ("being" and "not being" are resolved with "becoming"). This program of acceptance and reconciliation of contradictions is known as the "[[Hegelian dialectic]]".

Philosophers influenced by Hegel include [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], who coined the term "projection" as pertaining to humans' inability to recognize anything in the external world without projecting qualities of ourselves upon those things; [[Karl Marx]]; [[Friedrich Engels]]; and the [[British idealism|British idealists]], notably [[T. H. Green]], [[J. M. E. McTaggart]], [[F. H. Bradley]], and [[R. G. Collingwood]].

Few 20th-century philosophers embraced the core tenets of German idealism after the demise of British idealism. However, quite a few have embraced Hegelian dialectic, most notably [[Frankfurt School]] [[critical theorist]]s, [[Alexandre Kojève]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (in his ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''), and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. A central theme of German idealism, the legitimacy of Kant's "[[Copernican Revolution#Immanuel Kant|Copernican revolution]]", remains an important point of contention in 21st-century [[post-continental philosophy]].

====Marxism and critical theory====
{{Main|Marxism|critical theory}}
[[Marxism]] is a method of socioeconomic analysis, originating from [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. It analyzes [[Social class|class relations]] and societal conflict using a [[Historical materialism|materialist interpretation of historical development]] and a [[Marxist dialectic|dialectical view]] of social transformation. Marxist analyses and methodologies influenced political ideologies and social movements. Marxist understandings of history and society were adopted by academics in archeology, anthropology, media studies, political science, theater, history, sociology, art history and theory, cultural studies, education, economics, geography, literary criticism, aesthetics, critical psychology and philosophy.

In contemporary philosophy, the term "critical theory" describes the [[Western Marxism|Western Marxist philosophy]] of the [[Frankfurt School]], which was developed in Germany in the 1930s. Critical theory maintains that [[ideology]] is the principal obstacle to human [[emancipation]].<ref>Geuss, R. ''The Idea of a Critical Theory'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, ch. 4.</ref>

====Phenomenology and hermeneutics====
{{Main|Phenomenology (philosophy)|Hermeneutics}}
[[File:Edmund_Husserl_1910s.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Edmund Husserl]], in the 1910s]]
[[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] was an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for an account of the structure of conscious experience in general.<ref name="Smith" /> An important part of Husserl's phenomenological project was to show that all conscious acts are directed at or about objective content, a feature that Husserl called ''[[intentionality]]''.<ref name="Dreyfus" /> Husserl published only a few works in his lifetime, which treat phenomenology mainly in abstract methodological terms; but he left an enormous quantity of unpublished concrete analyses. Husserl's work was immediately influential in Germany, with the foundation of phenomenological schools in Munich ([[Munich phenomenology]]) and Göttingen (Göttingen phenomenology). Phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work of such philosophers as [[Martin Heidegger]] (formerly Husserl's research assistant and a proponent of [[hermeneutic phenomenology]], a theoretical [[:wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of [[Hermeneutics#Philosophical hermeneutics|modern hermeneutics]] and phenomenology), [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Through the work of Heidegger and Sartre, Husserl's focus on subjective experience influenced aspects of existentialism.

====Structuralism and post-structuralism====
{{Main|Structuralism|Post-structuralism}}
[[File:Ferdinand_de_Saussure.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]]]]

Inaugurated by the linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[structuralism]] sought to clarify systems of signs through analyzing the [[discourse]]s they both limit and make possible. Saussure conceived of the sign as being delimited by all the other signs in the system, and ideas as being incapable of existence prior to linguistic structure, which articulates thought. This led continental thought away from humanism, and toward what was termed the decentering of man: language is no longer spoken by man to express a true inner self, but language speaks man.

Structuralism sought the province of a hard science, but its positivism soon came under fire by post-structuralism, a wide field of thinkers, some of whom were once themselves structuralists, but later came to criticize it. Structuralists believed they could analyze systems from an external, objective standing, for example, but the poststructuralists argued that this is incorrect, that one cannot transcend structures and thus analysis is itself determined by what it examines. While the distinction between the signifier and signified was treated as crystalline by structuralists, poststructuralists asserted that every attempt to grasp the signified results in more signifiers, so meaning is always in a state of being deferred, making an ultimate interpretation impossible.

Structuralism came to dominate continental philosophy throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, encompassing thinkers as diverse as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jacques Lacan]]. Post-structuralism came to predominate from the 1970s onwards, including thinkers such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and even [[Roland Barthes]]; it incorporated a critique of structuralism's limitations.

===Pragmatism===
{{Main|Pragmatism}}
[[Pragmatism]] is a philosophical tradition that began in the United States around 1870.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pragmatism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/|access-date=13 September 2013|date=13 September 2013}}</ref> It asserts that the truth of beliefs consists in their usefulness and efficacy rather than their correspondence with reality.<ref name="Rorty" /> [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] were its co-founders and it was later modified by [[John Dewey]] as [[instrumentalism]]. Since the usefulness of any belief at any time might be contingent on circumstance, Peirce and James conceptualized final truth as something established only by the future, final settlement of all opinion.<ref name="Putnam"/>

[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William James]] in 1906]]
Pragmatism attempted to find a scientific concept of truth that does not depend on personal insight (revelation) or reference to some metaphysical realm. It interpreted the meaning of a statement by the effect its acceptance would have on practice. Inquiry taken far enough is thus the only path to truth.<ref>Peirce, C. S. (1878), "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, 286–302. Reprinted often, including ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 388–410 and ''Essential Peirce'' v. 1, 124–41. See end of §II for the pragmatic maxim. See third and fourth paragraphs in §IV for the discoverability of truth and the real by sufficient investigation. Also see quotes from Peirce from across the years in the entries for [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/truth.html "Truth"] and [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/pragmatismmaxim.html "Pragmatism, Maxim of..."] in the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, editors, University of Helsinki.</ref>

For Peirce commitment to inquiry was essential to truth-finding, implied by the idea and hope that inquiry is not fruitless. The interpretation of these principles has been subject to discussion ever since. Peirce's [[Pragmatic maxim|maxim of pragmatism]] is, "Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object."<ref name="paragraphs" />

Critics accused pragmatism falling victim to a simple fallacy: that because something that is true proves useful, that usefulness is an appropriate basis for its truthfulness.<ref name="Pratt"/> Pragmatist thinkers include Dewey, [[George Santayana]], and [[Clarence Irving Lewis|C. I. Lewis]].

Pragmatism was later worked on by [[neopragmatist]]s [[Richard Rorty]] who was the first to develop neopragmatist philosophy in his ''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]'' (1979),<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/pragmati/ Pragmatism – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]</ref> [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]], and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]. Neopragmatism has been described as a bridge between analytic and continental philosophy.<ref>William Egginton/[[Mike Sandbothe]] (eds.). ''The Pragmatic Turn in Philosophy. Contemporary Engagement between Analytic and Continental Thought.'' SUNY Press. 2004. Back cover.</ref>

===Process philosophy===
{{Main|Process philosophy}}
[[Process philosophy]] is a tradition beginning with [[Alfred North Whitehead]], who began teaching and writing on process and metaphysics when he joined [[Harvard University]] in 1924.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/|title= Alfred North Whitehead (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)}}</ref> This tradition identifies metaphysical [[reality]] with [[Change (philosophy)|change]].

Process philosophy is sometimes classified as closer to continental philosophy than analytic philosophy, because it is usually only taught in continental departments.<ref>William Blattner, [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/blattnew/contanalytic.html "Some Thoughts About "Continental" and "Analytic" Philosophy"]</ref> However, other sources state that process philosophy should be placed somewhere in the middle between the poles of analytic versus continental methods in contemporary philosophy.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=process-philosophy |title=Process Philosophy |last=Seibt |first=Johanna}}</ref><ref>Nicholas Gaskill, A.J. Nocek, ''The Lure of Whitehead'', University of Minnesota Press, 2014, p. 4: "it is no wonder that Whitehead fell by the wayside. He was too scientific for the "continentals," not scientific enough for the "analytics," and too metaphysical—which is to say [[Critical philosophy|uncritical]]—for them both" and p. 231: "the analytics and continentals are both inclined toward [[Kantianism|Kantian]] presuppositions in a manner that Latour and Whitehead brazenly renounce."</ref>

==== Pyrrhonism ====
{{main|Similarities between Pyrrhonism and Buddhism}}
The [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosopher]] [[Pyrrho]] accompanied [[Alexander the Great]] in his eastern campaigns, spending about 18 months in India. Pyrrho subsequently returned to Greece and founded [[Pyrrhonism]], a philosophy with substantial [[Similarities between Pyrrhonism and Buddhism|similarities with Buddhism]]. The Greek biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]] explained that Pyrrho's equanimity and detachment from the world were acquired in India.<ref>"He would withdraw from the world and live in solitude, rarely showing himself to his relatives; this is because he had heard an Indian reproach [[Anaxarchus]], telling him that he would never be able to teach others what is good while he himself danced attendance on kings in their court. He would maintain the same composure at all times." (Diogenes Laertius, IX.63 on Pyrrhon)</ref> Pyrrho was directly influenced by Buddhism in developing his philosophy, which is based on Pyrrho's interpretation of the Buddhist [[three marks of existence]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Beckwith|first=Christopher I.|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s10500.pdf|title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2015|isbn=9781400866328|page=28}}</ref> According to [[Edward Conze]], Pyrrhonism can be compared to Buddhist philosophy, especially the Indian [[Madhyamika]] school.<ref name="Conze">Conze, Edward. [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/conze2.htm Buddhist Philosophy and Its European Parallels]. Philosophy East and West 13, p.9-23, no.1, January 1963. University press of Hawaii.</ref> The Pyrrhonists' goal of [[ataraxia]] (the state of being untroubled) is a [[soteriological]] goal similar to [[nirvana]]. The Pyrrhonists promoted suspending judgm ient ([[epoché]]) about [[dogma]] (beliefs about non-evident matters) as the way to reach ataraxia. This is similar to the Buddha's refusal to answer [[The unanswered questions|certain metaphysical questions]] which he saw as non-conductive to the path of Buddhist practice and [[Nagarjuna]]'s "relinquishing of all views ([[drsti]])". Adrian Kuzminski argues for direct influence between these two systems of thought. In ''Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism''<ref name="Reinvented">Adrian Kuzminski (2008), ''Pyrrhonism How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism''; for a recent study see Georgios T . Halkias, [https://www.academia.edu/12679460/The_Self-immolation_of_Kalanos_and_other_Luminous_Encounters_Among_Greeks_and_Indian_Buddhists_in_the_Hellenistic_World "The Self-immolation of Kalanos and other Luminous Encounters among Greeks and Indian Buddhists in the Hellenistic World"], 2015, ''Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies'' '''8''', 163–186.</ref> According to Kuzminski, both philosophies argue against assenting to any dogmatic assertions about an ultimate metaphysical reality behind our sense impressions as a tactic to reach tranquility and both also make use of logical arguments against other philosophies in order to expose their contradictions.<ref name="Reinvented" />

==== Cyrenaicism ====
The [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaic]] philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]] is thought by some to have been influenced by the teachings of Ashoka's Buddhist missionaries.<ref>"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene (nicknamed ''Peisithanatos'', "The advocate of death") was a contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and Alexandria. His influence was such that he was ultimately prohibited from teaching." Jean-Marie Lafont, [[Inalco]] in "Les Dossiers d'Archéologie", No. 254, p. 78</ref>

<ref name="encyclopedia">Frederick Copleston, ''A History of Philosophy, Volume II: From Augustine to Scotus'' (Burns & Oates, 1950), p. 1, dates medieval philosophy proper from the Carolingian Renaissance in the eighth century to the end of the fourteenth century, though he includes [[Augustine]] and the Patristic fathers as precursors. Desmond Henry, in {{harvnb|Edwards|1967|pp=252–257}} volume 5, starts with Augustine and ends with [[Nicole Oresme|Nicholas of Oresme]] in the late fourteenth century.

Grayling (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), covers philosophers from Augustine to Ockham. {{harvnb|Gracia|2008|p=620}} identifies medieval philosophy as running from Augustine to [[John of St. Thomas]] in the seventeenth century. {{harvnb|Kenny|2012|loc=volume II}} begins with Augustine and ends with the Lateran Council of 1512.</ref>

In American philosophy scholars go from Jonathan Edwards to John Dewey; in American literature from James Fenimore Cooper to F. Scott Fitzgerald; in political theory from Plato to Hobbes and Locke […] The texts or authors who fill in the blanks from A to Z in these, and other intellectual traditions, constitute the canon, and there is an accompanying narrative that links text to text or author to author, a 'history of' American literature, economic thought, and so on. The most conventional of such histories are embodied in university courses and the textbooks that accompany them. This essay examines one such course, the History of Modern Philosophy, and the texts that helped to create it.
