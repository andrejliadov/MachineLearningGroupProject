The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to thought (thinking):

'''[[Thought]]''' (also called '''thinking''') is the [[mental process]] in which beings form psychological associations and [[model (abstract)|models]] of the world.  Thinking is manipulating [[information]], as when we form [[concept]]s, engage in [[problem solving]], [[reason]] and make [[choice|decision]]s.  Thought, the act of thinking, produces more thoughts.  A thought may be an idea, an image, a sound or even control an emotional feeling.

== Nature of thought ==
Thought (or thinking) can be described as all of the following:

* An activity taking place in a:
** [[brain]] &ndash; organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals (only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain). It is the physical structure associated with the mind.
*** [[mind]] &ndash; abstract entity with the [[cognition|cognitive]] faculties of [[consciousness]], [[perception]], [[thought|thinking]], [[judgement]], and [[memory]]. Having a mind is a characteristic of living creatures.<ref name="dict">Dictionary.com, "mind": "1. (in a human or other <u>conscious being</u>) the element, part, substance, or process that reasons, thinks, feels, wills, perceives, judges, etc.: <u>the processes of the mind</u>. 2. Psychology. the totality of <u>conscious and unconscious mental processes</u> and activities. 3. intellect or understanding, as distinguished from the faculties of feeling and willing; <u>intelligence</u>."</ref><ref>Google definition, "mind": "The <u>element</u> of a person that enables them to be aware of the world and their experiences, to think, and to feel; the faculty of consciousness." [https://www.google.com/search?q=Mind#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=definition+of+mind&oq=definition+of+mind]</ref> Activities taking place in a mind are called [[mental process]]es or [[cognitive function]]s.
** [[computer]] (see {{section link||Machine thought}} below) &ndash; general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations (an [[algorithm]]) can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
* An activity of [[intelligence]] &ndash; intelligence is the [[intellect]]ual process of  which is marked by [[cognition]], [[motivation]], and [[self-awareness]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tirri, Nokelainen|title=Measuring Multiple Intelligences and Moral Sensitivities in Education|date=January 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-6091-758-5|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789460917585}}</ref> Through intelligence, living creatures possess the cognitive abilities to learn, form concepts, understand, apply logic, and reason, including the capacities to recognize patterns, comprehend ideas, plan, problem solve, make decisions, retaining, and use language to communicate. Intelligence enables living creatures to experience and think.
** A type of [[mental process]] &ndash; something that individuals can do with their minds. Mental processes include perception, memory, thinking, volition, and emotion. Sometimes the term ''[[cognitive function]]'' is used instead.
* Thought as a biological adaptation mechanism<ref name=Nikolic2014>{{cite web|url=http://www.danko-nikolic.com/?smd_process_download=1&download_id=724|title=Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. arXiv:1402.5332 [q-bio.NC].|author=Danko Nikolić|date=2014}}</ref>
** [[Neural Network]] explanation: Thoughts are created by the summation of neural outputs and connections of which vectors form. These vectors describe the magnitude and direction of the connections and action between neurons. The graphs of these vectors can represent a network of neurons whose connections fire in different ways over time as synapses fire.  These large thought vectors in the brain cause other vectors of activity.  For example: An input from the environment is received by the neural network.  The network changes the magnitude and outputs of individual neurons.  The altered network outputs the symbols needed to make sense of the input.

Some would refer to this as the ‘problem-solving cycle’ (Bransford & Stein, 1993). In this cycle one will recognize the problem, define the problem, develop a strategy to fix the problem, organize the knowledge of the problem cycle, figure-out the resources at the user's disposal, monitor one's progress, and evaluate the solution for accuracy.

** {{annotated link|Analysis|Divide and conquer}} &ndash;  breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems
** {{annotated link|Hypothesis testing}} &ndash;  assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or, in some contexts, disprove) the assumption

* {{annotated link|Moral reasoning}} &ndash; process in which an individual tries to determine the difference between what is right and what is wrong in a personal situation by using logic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of: Moral Reasoning|url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Moral%20Reasoning|accessdate=21 July 2011}}</ref>  This is an important and often daily process that people use in an attempt to do the right thing.  Every day for instance, people are faced with the dilemma of whether or not to lie in a given situation.  People make this decision by reasoning the morality of the action and weighing that against its consequences.
* {{annotated link|Probabilistic reasoning}} &ndash; from combinatorics and indifference: if ''p'' then (probably) ''q''
* {{annotated link|Proportional reasoning}} &ndash; using "the concept of proportions when analyzing and solving a mathematical situation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quizlet.com/dictionary/proportional-reasoning/|title=Dictionary Search › proportional reasoning - Quizlet|publisher=}}</ref>
* {{annotated link|Rational thinking}}
* {{annotated link|Semiosis}}

* {{annotated link|Strategic thinking}}
* {{annotated link|Synthetic reasoning}}
* {{annotated link|Verbal reasoning}} &ndash; understanding and reasoning using concepts framed in words
* {{annotated link|Visual reasoning}} &ndash; process of manipulating one's mental image of an object in order to reach a certain conclusion – for example, mentally constructing a piece of machinery to experiment with different mechanisms
