'''Ontology''' is the branch of [[philosophy]] that studies concepts such as [[existence]], [[being]], [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], and [[reality]]. It includes the questions of how entities are grouped into [[Category of being|basic categories]] and which of these entities exist on the most fundamental level. Ontology is traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as [[metaphysics]].

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Classical compound}}

The [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] word ''ontology'' ('study of being') combines
: ''[[wikt:onto-|onto]]-'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{Lang-gr|ὄν|label=none|translit=on}}; <!--[sic] (neuter), not ὤν (masculine)-->{{NoteTag|ὄν is the [[Present tense|present-tense]] [[participle]] of the [[verb]] [[wikt:εἰμί|εἰμί]] (''eimí'', 'to be' or 'I am').}} {{Abbr|[[Genitive case|{{sc|GEN}}]].|Genitive case}} {{Lang-gr|ὄντος|label=none|translit=ontos|lit=being' or 'that which is}}) and
: ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]'' ({{Lang-gr|{{wikt-lang|en|-λογία}}|lit=logical discourse|label=none}}).<ref name="OnlineEtDict">{{cite dictionary |title = ontology |url = https://www.etymonline.com/word/ontology |dictionary = [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}</ref><ref name="LSJ">{{LSJ|ei)mi/1|εἰμί|ref}}</ref>

While the [[etymology]] is Greek, the oldest extant records of the word itself, the [[New Latin]] form {{Lang-la|ontologia|label=none}} appeared
: in 1606 in the ''[[Ogdoas Scholastica]]'' by [[Jacob Lorhard]] (''Lorhardus''), and
: in 1613 in the ''Lexicon philosophicum'' by [[Rudolph Goclenius|Rudolf Göckel]] (''Goclenius'').
The first occurrence in English of ''ontology'', as recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],''<ref>"[https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/ontology?q=ontology ontology]." ''[[Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary]]''. [[Oxford Dictionaries]] (2008)</ref> came in 1664 through ''Archelogia philosophica nova...'' by Gideon Harvey<ref>Harvey, Gideon. 1663. ''[http://name.umdl.umich.edu/A43008.0001.001 Archelogia philosophica nova, or, New Principles of Philosophy. Containing Philosophy in General, Metaphysicks or Ontology, Dynamilogy or a Discourse of Power, Religio Philosophi or Natural Theology, Physicks or Natural philosophy].'' London: J.H.</ref> The word was first used, in its Latin form, by philosophers, and based on the Latin roots (and in turn on the Greek ones).

[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] is the only one of the great philosophers of that century to have used the term ''ontology''.<ref>Devaux, Michaël, and Marco Lamanna. 2009. "[https://www.academia.edu/1406820/The_Rise_and_Early_History_of_the_Term_Ontology_1606-1730_ The Rise and Early History of the Term Ontology (1606–1730)]." ''Quaestio'' 9:173–208. pp. 197–98.</ref>

== Overview ==
Some philosophers, notably in the traditions of the [[Platonism|Platonic school]], contend that all nouns (including [[abstract noun]]s) refer to existent entities.<ref>https://www.coachbehnam.com/what-is-ontology#:~:text=Some%20philosophers%2C%20notably%20of%20the,nouns)%20refer%20to%20existent%20entities.&text=When%20one%20applies%20this%20process,to%20many%20branches%20of%20philosophy.</ref> Other philosophers contend that nouns do not always name entities, but that some provide a kind of shorthand for reference to a collection either of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] or of [[event (philosophy)|events]]. In this latter view, ''[[mind]]'', instead of referring to an entity, refers to a collection of ''mental events'' experienced by a ''[[person]]''; ''[[society]]'' refers to a collection of ''persons'' with some shared characteristics, and ''[[geometry]]'' refers to a collection of specific kinds of intellectual activities.<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XU5atV1nfukC&q=platonic+writings+griswold |title= Platonic Writings/Platonic Readings |first= Charles L. |last= Griswold |publisher= Penn State Press |year= 2001 |page= 237 |isbn= 978-0-271-02137-9}}</ref>{{qn|date=October 2017}} Between these poles of [[Platonic realism|realism]] and [[nominalism]] stand a variety of [[Moderate realism|other positions]].

=== Some fundamental questions ===
Principal questions of ontology include{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* "What can be said to exist?"
* "What is a thing?"<ref name="Isham">Isham, C. J. 1995. ''Lectures on Quantum Theory: Mathematical and Structural Foundations.'' London: [[Imperial College Press]]. {{ISBN|1-86094-000-5}}. pp. 63–7.</ref>
* "Into what categories, if any, can we sort existing things?"
* "What are the meanings of being?"
* "What are the various [[mode (disambiguation)|modes]] of being of entities?"

Various [[philosopher]]s have provided different answers to these questions. One common approach involves dividing the extant subjects and predicates into groups called [[category of being|categories]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Such lists of categories differ widely from one another, and it is through the co-ordination of different categorical schemes that ontology relates to such fields as [[library and information science|library science]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. Such an understanding of ontological categories, however, is merely [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]], classificatory. Aristotle's categories are the ways in which a being may be addressed simply as a being, such as:<ref>Cook, H. P., trans. 1983. ''Categories'' Vol. 1, by [[Aristotle]]. ''[[Loeb Classical Library]]''. Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]. </ref>
* ''what'' it is (its 'whatness', [[quiddity]], [[haecceity]] or essence);
* ''how'' it is (its 'howness' or qualitativeness);
* ''how much'' it is (quantitativeness);
* ''where'' it is (its relatedness to other beings).

Further examples of ontological questions include{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
* What is [[existence]], i.e. what does it mean for a being to be?
* Is existence a [[Property (philosophy)|property]]?
* Is existence a genus or general class that is simply divided up by specific differences?
* Which entities, if any, are fundamental?
* Are all entities objects?
* How do the [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of an object relate to the object itself?
* Do physical properties actually exist?
* What features are the [[essence|essential]], as opposed to merely accidental attributes of a given object?
* How many levels of existence or ontological levels are there? And what constitutes a "level"?
* What is a [[physical body|physical object]]?
* Can one give an account of what it means to say that a physical object exists?
* Can one give an account of what it means to say that a non-physical entity exists?
* What constitutes the ''[[identity (philosophy)|identity]]'' of an object?
* When does an object go ''out'' of existence, as opposed to merely ''changing''?
* Do beings exist other than in the modes of objectivity and subjectivity, i.e. is the subject/object split of modern philosophy inevitable?

=== Concepts ===
Essential ontological [[dichotomies]] include:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] and [[particular]]s
* [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]]
* [[Abstract object|abstract]] and [[Physical object|concrete]] objects
* [[essence]] and [[existence]]
* [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]]
* [[monism]] and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]
* [[idealism]] and [[materialism]]

==Types==
Ontological theories can be divided into various types according to their theoretical commitments.

=== Flat vs polycategorical vs hierarchical ===
{{Synthesis|date=December 2020}}

One way to divide ontologies is by the number of basic categories they use. ''Monocategorical or one category ontologies'' hold that there is only one basic category while ''polycategorical ontologies'' imply that there are several distinct basic categories.<ref name="Inwagen"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Paul |first1=L. A. |title=Being, Freedom, and Method: Themes From the Philosophy of Peter van Inwagen |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/PAUAOC-4 |chapter=A One Category Ontology}}</ref> Another way to divide ontologies is through the notion of ontological hierarchy. Hierarchical ontologies assert that some entities exist on a more fundamental level and that other entities depend on them. Flat ontologies, on the other hand, deny such a privileged status to any entities.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brassier |first1=Ray |title=Under Influence - Philosophical Festival Drift (2014) |date=2015 |publisher=Omnia |pages=64–80 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BRADAF |chapter=Deleveling: Against ‘Flat Ontologies’}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Epstein |first1=Brian |title=Social Ontology |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-ontology/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=27 November 2020 |date=2018}}</ref> Jonathan Schaffer provides an overview of these positions by distinguishing between ''flat'' ontologies (monocategorical non-hierarchical), ''sorted'' ontologies (polycategorical non-hierarchical) and ''ordered'' ontologies (polycategorical hierarchical).<ref name=Schaffer>{{cite book |author=[[Jonathan Schaffer]] |chapter=On What Grounds What Metametaphysics |title=Metametaphysics |chapter-url=http://www.jonathanschaffer.org/grounds.pdf |editor=Chalmers |editor2=Manley |editor3=Wasserman |isbn=978-0199546046 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |pages=347–83 }}</ref>

'''Flat''' ontologies are only interested in the difference between existence and non-existence. They are ''flat'' because each flat ontology can be represented by a simple set containing all the entities to which this ontology is committed. An influential exposition<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Quine |first1=Willard V. |title=On What There Is |journal=Review of Metaphysics |date=1948 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=21–38 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/QUIOWT-11}}</ref> of this approach comes from [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] which is why it has been referred to as the [[Meta-ontology#Quinean approach|Quinean]] approach to [[meta-ontology]].<ref name=Schaffer/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bricker |first1=Phillip |title=Ontological Commitment |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-commitment/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2016}}</ref> This outlook doesn't deny that the existing entities can be further subdivided and may stand in various relations to each other. These issues are questions for the more specific sciences, but they don't belong to ontology in the Quinean sense.

'''Polycategorical''' ontologies are concerned with the categories of being. Each polycategorical ontology posits a number of categories. These categories are exclusive and exhaustive: every existing entity belongs to exactly one category.<ref name=Schaffer/> A recent example of a polycategorical ontology is [[E.J. Lowe]]'s four-category-ontology.<ref name=Lowe>{{cite book |last1=Lowe |first1=E. J. |last2=Lowe |first2=Edward Joseph |title=The Four-Category Ontology: A Metaphysical Foundation for Natural Science |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn=978-0-19-925439-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7ISDAAAQBAJ |language=en |chapter=2. The Four-Category Ontology and its Rivals|year=2006 }}</ref> The four categories are object, kind, mode and attribute. The fourfold structure is based on two distinctions. The first distinction is between substantial entities (objects and kinds) and non-substantial entities (modes and attributes). The second distinction is between particular entities (objects and modes) and universal entities (kinds and attributes). Reality is built up through the interplay of entities belonging to different categories: particular entities instantiate universal entities, and non-substantial entities characterize substantial entities.<ref name=Lowe/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=J. T. M. |title=Lowe, Edward Jonathan |url=https://iep.utm.edu/lowe-ej/ |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>

'''Hierarchical''' ontologies are interested in the degree of fundamentality of the entities they posit. Their main goal is to figure out which entities are fundamental and how the non-fundamental entities depend on them. The concept of fundamentality is usually defined in terms of [[Grounding (metaphysics)|metaphysical grounding]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tahko |first1=Tuomas E. |title=Fundamentality |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fundamentality/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2018}}</ref> Fundamental entities are different from non-fundamental entities because they are not grounded in other entities.<ref name=Schaffer/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mehta |first1=Neil |title=Can Grounding Characterize Fundamentality? |journal=Analysis |date=2017 |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=74–79 |doi=10.1093/analys/anx044 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/NEICGC}}</ref> For example, it is sometimes held that elementary particles are more fundamental than the macroscopic objects (like chairs and tables) they compose. This is a claim about the grounding-relation between microscopic and macroscopic objects. Schaffer's priority monism is a recent form of a hierarchical ontology. He holds that on the most fundamental level there exists only one thing: the world as a whole. This thesis doesn't deny our common-sense intuition that the distinct objects we encounter in our everyday affairs like cars or other people exist. It only denies that these objects have the most fundamental form of existence.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaffer |first1=Jonathan |title=Monism: The Priority of the Whole |journal=The Philosophical Review |date=1 January 2010 |volume=119 |issue=1 |pages=31–76 |doi=10.1215/00318108-2009-025 |url=https://read.dukeupress.edu/the-philosophical-review/article-abstract/119/1/31/2871/Monism-The-Priority-of-the-Whole |language=en |issn=0031-8108}}</ref> An example of a ''hierarchical'' ontology in [[continental philosophy]] comes from [[Nicolai Hartmann]].

===Thing ontologies vs fact ontologies===
'''Thing ontologies''' and '''fact ontologies''' are one-category-ontologies: they both hold that all fundamental entities belong to the same category. They disagree on whether this category is the category of things or of facts.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bergmann |first1=Gustav |title=Ineffability, Ontology, and Method |journal=Philosophical Review |date=1960 |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=18–40 |doi=10.2307/2182265 |jstor=2182265 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BERIOA}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rosenkrantz |first1=Gary S. |title=Of Facts and Things |journal=International Journal of Philosophical Studies |date=2018 |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=679–700 |doi=10.1080/09672559.2018.1542277 |s2cid=149893677 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/ROSOFA}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Esfeld |first1=Michael |title=The Routledge Handbook of Metametaphysics |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/ESFTAN |chapter=‘Thing’ and ‘Non-Thing’ Ontologies}}</ref> A slogan for fact ontologies comes from [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]: "The world is the totality of facts, not of things".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wittgenstein |first1=Ludwig |title=Tractatus Logico-philosophicus |date=2001 |publisher=Routledge |page=5}}</ref>

One difficulty in characterizing this dispute is to elucidate what things and facts are, and how they differ from each other. Things are commonly contrasted with the properties and relations they instantiate.<ref name=Bradley>{{cite web |last1=Rettler |first1=Bradley |last2=Bailey |first2=Andrew M. |title=Object |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/object/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2017}}</ref> Facts, on the other hand, are often characterized as having these things and the properties/relations as their constituents.<ref name=Armstrong>{{cite book |last1=Armstrong |first1=D. M. |title=Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-161542-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbGI46EoQKEC |language=en |chapter=4. States of Affairs|date=29 July 2010 }}</ref> This is reflected in a rough linguistic characterization of this difference where the subjects and objects of an assertion refer to things while the assertion as a whole refers to a fact.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Skyrms |first1=Brian |title=Tractarian Nominalism |journal=Philosophical Studies |date=1981 |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=199–206 |doi=10.1007/BF00353791 |s2cid=170360466 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SKYTN}}</ref>

Reism in [[continental philosophy]] is one form of thing ontology. [[Franz Brentano]] developed a version of reism in his later philosophy. He held that only concrete particular things exist. Things can exist in two forms: either as spatio-temporal bodies or as temporal souls. Brentano was aware of the fact that many common-sense expressions seem to refer to entities that don't have a place in his ontology, like properties or intentional objects. This is why he developed a method to paraphrase these expressions in order to avoid these ontological commitments.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Woleński |first1=Jan |title=Reism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reism/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2020}}</ref>

[[D. M. Armstrong]] is a well-known defender of fact ontology. He and his followers refer to facts as states of affairs.<ref name=Armstrong /> States of affairs are the basic building blocks of his ontology: they have particulars and universals as their constituents but they are primary in relation to particulars and universals. States of affairs have independent existence while "[u]npropertied particulars and
uninstantiated universals are false abstractions".<ref name=Armstrong />

===Constituent ontologies vs blob theories===
'''Constituent ontologies''' and '''blob theories''', sometimes referred to as ''relational ontologies'', are concerned with the internal structure of objects. Constituent ontologies hold that objects have an internal structure made up of constituents. This is denied by blob theories: they contend that objects are structureless "blobs".<ref name=Bradley/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grupp |first1=Jeffrey |title=Blob Theory: N-adic Properties Do Not Exist |journal=Sorites |date=October 2006 |issue=17 |url=http://www.sorites.org/Issue_17/grupp.htm}}</ref><ref name="Inwagen">{{cite journal |last1=Inwagen |first1=Peter van |title=Relational Vs. Constituent Ontologies |journal=Philosophical Perspectives |date=2011 |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=389–405 |doi=10.1111/j.1520-8583.2011.00221.x |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/VANRVC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Vallicella |first1=William F. |title=A Paradigm Theory of Existence: Onto-Theology Vindicated |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |page=88 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/VALAPT-2 |chapter=III THE 'NO DIFFERENCE' THEORY}}</ref>

[[Bundle theory|Bundle theories]] are examples of constituent ontologies. Bundle theorists assert that an object is nothing but the properties it "has". On this account, a regular apple could be characterized as a bundle of redness, roundness, sweetness, etc. Defenders of bundle theory disagree on the nature of the bundled properties. Some affirm that these properties are universals while others contend that they are particulars, so-called "tropes".<ref name=Bradley/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Howard |title=Substance |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/substance/#BundTheoVersSubsThinPart |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2020}}</ref>

Class [[nominalism]], on the other hand, is a form of blob theory. Class nominalists hold that properties are classes of things. To instantiate a property is merely to be a member of the corresponding class. So properties are not constituents of the objects that have them.<ref name=Bradley/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rodriguez-Pereyra |first1=Gonzalo |title=Nominalism in Metaphysics |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nominalism-metaphysics/#NomAboUni |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2019}}</ref>

===Information science===
In [[Ontology (information science)|information science]] ontologies are classified in various ways, using criteria such as the degree of abstraction and field of application:<ref name=Petrov />

# '''[[Upper ontology]]''': concepts supporting development of an ontology, [[meta-ontology]].
# '''[[Ontology (information science)|Domain ontology]]''': concepts relevant to a particular topic, [[domain of discourse]], or area of interest, for example, to information technology or to computer. languages, or to particular branches of science.
# '''Interface ontology''': concepts relevant to the juncture of two disciplines.
# '''[[Process ontology]]''': inputs, outputs, constraints, sequencing information, involved in business or engineering processes.

===Hindu philosophy===
Ontology features in the [[Samkhya]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]] from the first millennium BCE.<ref>Larson, G. J., R. S. Bhattacharya, and K. Potter, eds. 2014. "Samkhya." Pp. 3–11 in ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies'' 4. [[Princeton University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-691-60441-1}}.</ref> Samkhya philosophy regards the universe as consisting of two independent realities: [[puruṣa]] (pure, contentless consciousness) and [[prakṛti]] (matter). The [[substance dualism]] between puruṣa and prakṛti is similar but not identical to the substance dualism between mind and body that, following the works of [[Descartes]], has been central to many disputes in the Western philosophical tradition.<ref name="Schweizer"/>{{rp|845}}<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sharma |first1=Richa |title=Comparative Perspective on Dualism: Descartes and Samkhaya |journal=Online International Interdisciplinary Research Journal |date=Jan 2017 |volume=Volume-VII |url=http://www.oiirj.org/oiirj/jan2017-special-issue/26.pdf}}</ref> Samkhya sees the mind as being the subtle part of prakṛti. It is made up of three faculties: the sense mind (manas), the intellect ([[buddhi]]), and the ego ([[Ahamkara|ahaṁkāra]]). These faculties perform various functions but are by themselves unable to produce consciousness, which belongs to a distinct ontological category and for which puruṣa alone is responsible.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ruzsa |first1=Ferenc |title=Sankhya |url=https://iep.utm.edu/sankhya/ |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=11 December 2020}}</ref><ref name="Schweizer">{{cite journal |last1=Schweizer |first1=Paul |title=Mind/Consciousness Dualism in Sankhya-Yoga Philosophy |journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research |date=1993 |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=845–859 |doi=10.2307/2108256 |jstor=2108256 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SCHMDI}}</ref> The [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga school]] agrees with Samkhya philosophy on the fundamental dualism between puruṣa and prakṛti but it differs from Samkhya's atheistic position by incorporating the concept of a "personal, yet essentially inactive, deity" or "personal god" ([[Ishvara]]).<ref>Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga – An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-64887-5}}, page 39-41</ref><ref name=lpfl>Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120832329}}, pages 38-39</ref><ref>Kovoor T.

=== Greek Philosophy ===
In the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophical tradition]], [[Parmenides]] was among the first to propose an ontological characterization of the fundamental nature of existence. In the prologue (or  [[Parmenides#Proem|''proem'']]) to ''On Nature'', he describes two views of [[existence]]. Initially, nothing comes from nothing, thus [[existence]] is [[Monism|eternal]]. This posits that existence is what may be conceived of by thought, created, or possessed. Hence, there may be neither void nor vacuum; and true reality neither may come into being nor vanish from existence. Rather, the entirety of creation is eternal, uniform, and immutable, though not infinite (Parmenides characterized its shape as that of a perfect sphere). Parmenides thus posits that change, as perceived in everyday experience, is illusory.

Opposite to the [[Eleatics|Eleatic]] [[monism]] of [[Parmenides]] is the  [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]] conception of [[being]]. In the 5th century BC, [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Leucippus]] replaced<ref>Graham, Daniel W. 2006. ''Explaining the Cosmos: The Ionian Tradition of Scientific Philosophy''. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]]. {{ISBN|9780691125404}}. [https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691125404/explaining-the-cosmos Lay summary].</ref> the reality of ''being'' (unique and unchanging) with that of [[Becoming (philosophy)|''becoming'']], therefore by a more fundamental and elementary ''[[ontic]]'' plurality. This thesis originated in the [[Hellenic world]], stated in two different ways by Anaxagoras and by Leucippus. The first theory dealt with "seeds" (which Aristotle referred to as "''homeomeries''") of the various substances. The second was the  [[Atom (order theory)|atomistic]] theory,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atomism-ancient/ | title= Ancient Atomism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) | publisher= Plato.stanford.edu | accessdate= 2010-02-21}}</ref> which dealt with reality as based on the [[vacuum]], the atoms and their intrinsic movement in it.{{Citation needed |date= January 2012}}

The materialist ''[[atomism]]'' proposed by Leucippus was [[indeterminism|indeterminist]], but [[Democritus]] ({{circa}} 460 – {{circa}} 370 BC) subsequently developed it in a  [[determinism|deterministic]] way. Later (4th century BC), [[Epicurus]] took the original ''atomism'' again as indeterministic. He saw reality as composed of an infinity of indivisible, unchangeable corpuscles or [[atom]]s (from the Greek ''atomon'', lit. 'uncuttable'), but he gives weight to characterize atoms whereas for Leucippus they are characterized by a "figure", an "order" and a "position" in the cosmos.<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', I, 4, 985</ref> Atoms are, besides, creating the whole with the intrinsic movement in the ''vacuum'', producing the diverse flux of being. Their movement is influenced by the ''parenklisis'' ([[Lucretius]] names it ''[[clinamen]]'') and that is determined by [[Randomness|chance]]. These ideas foreshadowed the understanding of  [[physics|traditional physics]] until the advent of 20th-century theories on the nature of atoms.<ref>

==== Plato ====
[[Plato]] developed the distinction between true reality and illusion, in arguing that what is real are eternal and unchanging  [[Theory of Forms|forms]] or ideas (a precursor to  [[universal (metaphysics)|''universals'']]), of which things experienced in sensation are at best merely copies, and real only in so far as they copy ("partake of") such forms. In general, Plato presumes that all nouns (e.g., "beauty") refer to real entities, whether sensible bodies or insensible forms. Hence, in [[Sophist (dialogue)|''The Sophist'']], Plato argues that ''being'' is a ''form'' in which all existent things participate and which they have in common (though it is unclear whether "Being" is intended in the sense of [[existence]], [[copula (linguistics)|copula]], or [[identity (philosophy)|identity]]); and argues, against [[Parmenides]], that forms must exist not only of ''being'', but also of [[Negation]] and of non-being (or ''Difference'').{{citation needed |date= September 2017}}

==== Aristotle ====
In his  [[Categories (Aristotle)|''Categories'']], Aristotle (384–322 BCE) identifies ten possible kinds of things that may be the subject or the predicate of a proposition. For Aristotle there are four different ontological dimensions:<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Studtmann|first= Paul|date= 2007-09-07|title= Aristotle's Categories|url= https://stanford.library.sydney.edu.au/entries/aristotle-categories/#FouFolDiv}}</ref>

# according to the various categories or ways of addressing a being as such
# according to its truth or falsity (e.g. fake gold, counterfeit money)
# whether it exists in and of itself or simply 'comes along' by accident
# according to its potency, movement (energy) or finished presence ([[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'' Book Theta]]).

=== Avicenna aka Ibn Sina ===
According to Avicenna (also known as [[Ibn Sina]]) ({{circa}} 980 – 1037), and in an interpretation of Greek Aristotelian and Platonist ontological doctrines in medieval [[metaphysics]], being is either necessary, contingent ''qua'' possible, or impossible. Necessary being is that which cannot but be, since its non-being would entail a contradiction. Contingent ''qua'' possible being is neither necessary nor impossible for it to be or not to be. It is ontologically neutral, and is brought from potential existing into actual existence by way of a cause that is external to its essence. Its being is borrowed – unlike the necessary existent, which is self-subsisting and impossible not to be. As for the impossible, it necessarily does not exist, and the affirmation of its being would involve a contradiction.<ref>

=== Aquinas ===
Fundamental to [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s ontology is his distinction between [[essence]] and [[existence]]: all entities are conceived as composites of essence and existence.<ref name="Kerr">{{cite web |last1=Kerr |first1=Gaven |title=Aquinas: Metaphysics |url=https://iep.utm.edu/aq-meta/ |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=18 December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Christopher M. |title=Thomas Aquinas |url=https://iep.utm.edu/aquinas/ |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=18 December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Magee |first1=Joseph |title=Ontology |url=https://aquinasonline.com/ontology/ |website=Thomistic Philosophy Page |access-date=18 December 2020 |language=en |date=9 February 2020}}</ref> The essence of a thing is what this thing is like, it signifies the definition of this thing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Magee |first1=Joseph |title=Essence and Existence |url=https://aquinasonline.com/essence-and-existence/ |website=Thomistic Philosophy Page |access-date=18 December 2020 |language=en |date=4 February 2020}}</ref> God has a special status since He is the only entity whose essence is identical to its existence. But for all other, finite entities there is a ''real distinction'' between essence and existence.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Craig |first1=Edward |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=1996 |publisher=Routledge |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BEAREO |chapter=Aquinas, Thomas}}</ref> This distinction shows itself, for example, in our ability to understand the essence of something without knowing about its existence.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Montague |first1=Michelle |title=Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2nd Edition |date=2006 |publisher=Macmillan |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MONMEO-3 |chapter=Thomas Aquinas, St.}}</ref> Aquinas conceives of existence as an ''act of being'' that actualizes the potency given by the essence. Different things have different essences, which impose different limits on the corresponding ''act of being''.<ref name="Kerr"/> The paradigm examples of essence-existence-composites are material substances like cats or trees. Aquinas incorporates Aristotle's distinction between [[matter and form]] by holding that the essence of ''material'' things, as opposed to the essence of ''immaterial'' things like angels, is the composition of their matter and form.<ref name="Kerr"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=McInerny |first1=Ralph |last2=O'Callaghan |first2=John |title=Saint Thomas Aquinas |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=18 December 2020 |date=2018}}</ref> So, for example, the essence of a marble statue would be the composition of the marble (its matter) and the shape it has (its form). Form is universal since substances made of different matter can have the same form. The forms of a substance may be divided into substantial and accidental forms. A substance can survive a change of an accidental form but ceases to exist upon a change of a substantial form.<ref name="Kerr"/>

=== Descartes ===
[[René Descartes]]' ontological distinction between mind and body has been one of the most influential parts of his philosophy.<ref name="Skirry">{{cite web |last1=Skirry |first1=Justin |title=Descartes, Rene: Mind-Body Distinction |url=https://iep.utm.edu/descmind/ |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=19 December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sandkühler |first1=Hans Jörg |title=Enzyklopädie Philosophie |date=2010 |publisher=Meiner |url=https://meiner.de/enzyklopadie-philosophie.html |chapter=Ontologie}}</ref> On his view, minds are thinking things while bodies are extended things. ''Thought'' and ''extension'' are two ''attributes'' that each come in various ''modes'' of being. Modes of ''thinking'' include judgments, doubts, volitions, sensations and emotions while the shapes of material things are modes of ''extension''.<ref name="Smith">{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Kurt |title=Descartes’ Theory of Ideas |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2018}}</ref> Modes come with a lower degree of reality since they depend for their existence on a substance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nelson |first1=Alan |title=Introduction: Descartes's Ontology |journal=Topoi |date=1997 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=103–109 |doi=10.1023/A:1005877628327 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/NELIDO-3}}</ref> Substances, on the other hand, can exist on their own.<ref name="Smith"/> Descartes' [[substance dualism]] asserts that every finite substance is either a thinking substance or an extended substance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rodriguez-Pereyra |first1=Gonzalo |title=Descartes's Substance Dualism and His Independence Conception of Substance |journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy |date=2008 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=69–89 |doi=10.1353/hph.2008.1827 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/RODDSD}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Howard |title=Dualism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |date=2020}}</ref> This position doesn't entail that minds and bodies ''actually are'' separated from each other, which would defy the intuition that we both have a body and a mind.

=== Spinoza ===
[[Baruch Spinoza]] is well-known for his ''substance monism:'' the thesis that only one substance exists.<ref name="Dutton">{{cite web |last1=Dutton |first1=Blake D. |title=Spinoza, Benedict De |url=https://iep.utm.edu/spinoza/ |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |access-date=21 December 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sandkühler |first1=Hans Jörg |title=Enzyklopädie Philosophie |date=2010 |publisher=Meiner |url=https://meiner.de/enzyklopadie-philosophie.html |chapter=Ontologie}}</ref> He refers to this substance as "God or Nature", emphasizing both his [[pantheism]] and his [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mander |first1=William |title=Pantheism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pantheism/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=21 December 2020 |date=2020}}</ref> This substance has an infinite amount of attributes, which he defines as "what the intellect perceives of substance as constituting its essence".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shein |first1=Noa |title=Spinoza's Theory of Attributes |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza-attributes/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=21 December 2020 |date=2018}}</ref> Of these attributes, only two are accessible to the human mind: thought and extension.

This is so since the attributes are themselves necessary and since the system of modes follows from them.<ref name="Dutton"/>

=== Wolff ===
[[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] defines ontology as the science of being in general. He sees it as a part of metaphysics besides cosmology, psychology and natural theology.<ref name="Craig">{{cite book |last1=Craig |first1=Edward |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=1996 |publisher=Routledge |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BEAREO |chapter=Wolff, Christian}}</ref><ref name="Hettche">{{cite web |last1=Hettche |first1=Matt |last2=Dyck |first2=Corey |title=Christian Wolff |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wolff-christian/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=16 December 2020 |date=2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Wolff |first1=Christian |title=Preliminary Discourse on Philosophy in General |date=1963 |publisher=Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill |page=45-6 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/WOLPDO-2}}</ref> According to Wolff, it is a [[deductive]] science, knowable [[a priori]] and based on two fundamental principles: the [[principle of non-contradiction]] ("it cannot happen that the same thing is and is not") and the [[principle of sufficient reason]] ("nothing exists without a sufficient reason for why it exists rather than does not exist").<ref name="Craig"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sandkühler |first1=Hans Jörg |title=Enzyklopädie Philosophie |date=2010 |publisher=Meiner |url=https://meiner.de/enzyklopadie-philosophie.html |chapter=Ontologie}}</ref> ''Beings'' are defined by their ''determinations'' or ''predicates'', which can't involve a contradiction. Determinates come in 3 types: ''essentialia'', ''attributes'', and ''modes''.<ref name="Craig"/> ''Essentialia'' define the nature of a being and are therefore necessary properties of this being. ''Attributes'' are determinations that follow from essentialia and are equally necessary, in contrast to ''modes'', which are merely contingent. Wolff conceives ''existence'' as just one determination among others, which a being may lack.<ref name="Hettche"/> Ontology is interested in being at large, not just in actual being. But all beings, whether actually existing or not, have a sufficient reason.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Montague |first1=Michelle |title=Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2nd Edition |date=2006 |publisher=Macmillan |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MONMEO-3 |chapter=Ontology, History of}}</ref> The sufficient reason for things without actual existence consists in all the determinations that make up the essential nature of this thing. Wolff refers to this as a "reason of being" and contrasts it with a "reason of becoming", which explains why some things have actual existence.<ref name="Hettche"/>

=== Schopenhauer ===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was a proponent of [[Voluntarism (philosophy)#Metaphysical voluntarism|metaphysical voluntarism]]:<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Voluntarism |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/voluntarism-philosophy |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=21 November 2020 |language=en}}</ref> he regards will as the underlying and ultimate reality.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ortegat |first1=P. |last2=Walker |first2=L.

Like the Kantian thing-in-itself, the will exists outside space and time. But, unlike the Kantian thing-in-itself, the will has an experiential component to it: it comes in the form of striving, desiring, feeling, etc.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Wicks |first1=Robert |title=Arthur Schopenhauer |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |accessdate=21 November 2020 |date=2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Julian |title=Schopenhauer |date=2005 |publisher=Routledge |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/YOUS |chapter=3.

=== Hartmann ===
[[Nicolai Hartmann]] is a 20th-century philosopher within the [[Continental philosophy|continental tradition of philosophy]]. He interprets ontology as [[Aristotle]]'s science of being qua being: the science of the most general characteristics of entities, usually referred to as categories, and the relations between them.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hartmann |first1=Nicolai |title=Zur Grundlegung der Ontologie |date=1935 |publisher=W.

Every entity has both ''existence'' and ''essence''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hartmann |first1=Nicolai |title=Zur Grundlegung der Ontologie |date=1935 |publisher=W.

The relative modalities are ''relative'' in the sense that they depend on the absolute modalities: something is possible, impossible or necessary because something else is actual. Hartmann asserts that reality is made up of four [[Integrative level|levels]] (''inanimate'', ''biological'', ''psychological'' and ''spiritual'') that form a hierarchy.<ref name="Poli"/><ref name="Hartmann"/>

=== Quine ===
The notion of [[ontological commitment]] plays a central role in [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s contributions to ontology.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Craig |first1=Edward |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=1996 |publisher=Routledge |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BEAREO |chapter=Ontological commitment}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |title=Ontology |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/ontology-metaphysics |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=13 December 2020 |language=en}}</ref> A theory is ontologically committed to an entity if that entity must exist in order for the theory to be true.<ref name="Bricker">{{cite web |last1=Bricker |first1=Phillip |title=Ontological Commitment |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-commitment/ |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |access-date=13 December 2020 |date=2016}}</ref> Quine proposed that the best way to determine this is by translating the theory in question into [[first-order predicate logic]]. Of special interest in this translation are the logical constants known as [[existential quantification|existential quantifiers]], whose meaning corresponds to expressions like "there exists..." or "for some...". They are used to [[First-order_logic#Free_and_bound_variables|bind the variables]] in the expression following the quantifier.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Magnus |first1=P.

== Other ontological topics ==

=== Ontological formations ===
The concept of ''ontological formations'' refers to formations of social relations understood as dominant ways of living. Temporal, spatial, corporeal, [[Epistemology|epistemological]], and performative relations are taken to be central to understanding a dominant formation. That is, a particular ontological formation is based on how ontological categories of time, space, embodiment, knowing and performing are lived—objectively and subjectively. Different ontological formations include the ''customary'' (including the tribal), the ''traditional'', the ''modern'', and the ''postmodern''. The concept was first introduced by [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] in 2006, together with a series of writers including Damian Grenfell and [[Manfred Steger]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=James|first=Paul|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In —Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2006|location=London|author-link=Paul James (academic)}}</ref>

In the ''[[engaged theory]]'' approach, ontological formations are seen as layered and intersecting rather than singular formations. They are 'formations of being'. This approach avoids the usual problems of a Great Divide being posited between the modern and the pre-modern. From a philosophical distinction concerning different formations of being, the concept then provides a way of translating into practical understandings concerning how humans might design cities and communities that live creatively across different ontological formations, for example cities that are not completely dominated by modern valences of spatial configuration. Here the work of Tony Fry is important.<ref>{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | author-link1= Paul James (academic) | chapter= Urban Design in the Global South: Ontological Design in Practice | title= Design in the Borderlands | editor= Tony Fry |editor2=Eleni Kalantidou | chapter-url= https://www.academia.edu/9161853 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}</ref>

=== Ontology of fictional characters ===

According to [[Edward N. Zalta]], the ontology of fiction analyses such sentences as: <ref>[[Edward N. Zalta|Zalta, Edward N.]] 2009. "Fictional truth, objects, and characters." Pp. 267–69 in ''A Companion to Metaphysics'' (2nd ed.), edited by J. Kim G. S. Rosenkrantz, and E. Sosa. [[Chichester]], UK: [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley–Blackwell]]. {{ISBN|9781405152983}}. p. 267.</ref>
* '[[Nero]] worshipped (the god);'
* '[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the god, does not exist;' and
* '[[Eliza Doolittle]], in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s [[Pygmalion (play)|''Pygmalion'']], is a flower girl.'

According to [[Amie L. Thomasson]], fictional discourse can be of four sorts:

# Uttered ''within'' works of fiction;
# Philosophical exercises such as '[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] does not exist';
# Treating fictional characters as if they were 'real', such as '[[Superman]] can leap tall buildings;' and
# Discourse ''about'' works of fiction, such as '[[Pygmalion (play)|Professor Higgins]] was created by [[George Bernard Shaw]]'.<ref name="Thomasson">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Fictional Entities |last=Thomasson |first=Amie L. |author-link=Amie Thomasson |url=https://uh.edu/~garson/Thomasson%20-%20Fictional%20Entities.pdf |encyclopedia=A Companion to Metaphysics |editor-last1=Kim |editor-first1=Jaegwon |editor-last2=Sosa |editor-first2=Ernest |editor-last3=Rosenkrantz |editor-first3=Gary S. |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2009 |edition=Second}}</ref>

[[Jeremy Bentham]] distinguished three kinds of entities:<ref>Harrison, R. (2009). Jeremy Bentham, p. 145 in ''A Companion to Metaphysics'', ed. Kim, J., Rosenkrantz, G.S., Sosa, E., Wiley–Blackwell, Chichester UK, 2nd edition, {{ISBN|9781405152983}}.</ref>

# the '''real''': those that can be perceived, or can be inferred from perception.
# the '''fictitious''': abstractions that referred to perceptible things.
# the '''fabulous''': those that can be found only in the imagination, where the word 'exist' applies to such only in the sense that they do not really exist.

[[Francis Herbert Bradley]] thought that real things exist respectively at particular times and places. He recognised several kinds of entity:<ref>Stock, G. (2009).  Francis Herbert Bradley, pp. 155–158 in ''A Companion to Metaphysics'', ed. Kim, J., Rosenkrantz, G.S., Sosa, E., Wiley–Blackwell, Chichester UK, 2nd edition, {{ISBN|9781405152983}}, p. 157.</ref>
* the genuinely historical;
* the fictional;
* the real;
* the merely imagined;
* the existent; and
* the non-existent.

[[Alexius Meinong]] would put fictional entities into the category which he called ''subsistence''.<ref name=":0" /> This category contains objects that neither exist spatially or non-spatially. However, they do have properties. The properties are given to these objects in the way they are said to be described. For example, we can talk about the tall unicorn even though the tall unicorn does not exist. We can say the unicorn is in fact tall because this follows from the properties in which the object is characterized.<ref name=":0">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Fictional Entities |last1=Kroon |first1=Fred |last2=Voltolini |first2=Alberto |editor-last=Zalta |editor-first=Edward N. |encyclopedia=[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |year=2018 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/fictional-entities }}</ref>

=== Ontological and epistemological certainty ===
[[René Descartes]], with ''[[cogito, ergo sum]]'' (''je pense donc je suis,'' "I think, therefore I am"), argued that a person's thinking agency, his ''res cogitans'', as distinct from his material body, his ''res extensa'', is something that we can know exists with [[epistemology|epistemological]] certainty. Descartes argued further that this knowledge could lead to a proof of the certainty of the [[existence of God]], using the [[ontological argument]] that had been formulated first by [[Anselm of Canterbury]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/ont-arg/|title=Anselm: Ontological Argument for God's Existence.|website=IEP}}</ref>

=== Body and environment, questioning the meaning of being ===
Schools of [[metaphysical subjectivism|subjectivism]], [[metaphysical objectivism|objectivism]] and [[relativism]] existed at various times in the 20th century, and the [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] and [[embodied philosophy|body philosophers]] tried to reframe all these questions in terms of bodies taking some specific [[philosophy of action|action]] in an environment. This relied to a great degree on insights derived from scientific research into animals taking instinctive action in natural and artificial settings—as studied by [[biology]], [[ecology]],<ref>Smith, Barry. 2001. "[http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/napflion.pdf Objects and Their Environments: From Aristotle to Ecological Ontology]" ''The Life and Motion of SocioEconomic Units'' ([[Geographic information system|GIS data]] 8). London: [[Taylor & Francis]]. pp. 79–97.</ref> and [[cognitive science]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The processes by which bodies related to environments became of great concern, and the idea of [[being]] itself became difficult to really define. What did people mean when they said "A is B", "A must be B", "A was B"...? Some linguists advocated dropping the verb "to be" from the English language, leaving "[[E-Prime|E&nbsp;Prime]]", supposedly less prone to bad abstractions. Others, mostly philosophers, tried to dig into the word and its usage. [[Martin Heidegger]] distinguished ''human being'' as ''existence'' from the being of things in the world. Heidegger proposes that our way of being human and the way the world is for us are cast historically through a fundamental ontological questioning. These fundamental ontological categories provide the basis for communication in an age: a horizon of unspoken and seemingly unquestionable background meanings, such as human beings understood unquestioningly as subjects and other entities understood unquestioningly as objects. Because these basic ontological meanings both generate and are regenerated in everyday interactions, the locus of our way of being in a historical epoch is the communicative event of language in use.<ref name=Hyde>Hyde, R.

=== Ontology and language ===
Some philosophers suggest that the question of "What is?" is (at least in part) an issue of ''usage'' rather than a question about facts.<ref>{{cite book | title= Introduction to an Ontology of Intellectual Property | publisher=The Scitech Lawyer, ABA| author=Carvalko, Joseph | date= Summer 2005 }}</ref> This perspective is conveyed by an analogy made by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]: Suppose a person refers to a 'cup' as a 'chair' and makes some comments pertinent to a cup, but uses the word 'chair' consistently throughout instead of 'cup'. One might readily catch on that this person simply calls a 'cup' a 'chair' and the oddity is explained.<ref name="Davidson">{{cite journal|author=Davidson, Donald|year=1974|title=On the very idea of a conceptual scheme|url=http://files.meetup.com/328570/davidson_on-the-very-idea.pdf|journal=Proceedings and Address of the American Philosophical Association|volume=47|pages=5–20}}

Davidson refers to a 'ketch' and a 'yawl' (p. 18).</ref> Analogously, if we find people asserting 'there are' such-and-such, and we do not ourselves think that 'such-and-such' exist, we might conclude that these people are not nuts (Davidson calls this assumption 'charity'), they simply use 'there are' differently than we do. The question of ''What is?'' is at least partially a topic in the philosophy of language, and is not entirely about ontology itself.<ref name="Krieger">{{cite journal|author=Kriegel, Uriah|year=2011|title=Two defenses of common-sense ontology|url=http://www.uriahkriegel.com/downloads/defenses.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=Dialectica|volume=65|issue=2|pages=177–204|doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.2011.01262.x|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221041700/http://uriahkriegel.com/downloads/defenses.pdf|archive-date=2018-12-21|access-date=2013-04-27}}</ref> This viewpoint has been expressed by [[Eli Hirsch]].<ref name="Hirsch">Hirsch, Eli. 2011.

Hirsch interprets [[Hilary Putnam]] as asserting that different concepts of "the existence of something" can be correct.<ref name=Hirsch1 /> This position does not contradict the view that some things do exist, but points out that different 'languages' will have different rules about assigning this property.<ref name=Hirsch1 /><ref name="Hirsch2">{{cite book|author=Hirsch, Eli|title=Ernest Sosa and His Critics|publisher=Blackwell|year=2004|isbn=978-0-470-75547-1|editor=John Greco|pages=224–232|chapter=Sosa's Existential Relativism|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Moz8OeX4w8AC&pg=PA224}}</ref> How to determine the 'fitness' of a 'language' to the world then becomes a subject for investigation.

Common to all [[Indo-European copula]] languages is the double use of the verb "to be" in both stating that entity X exists ("X is.") as well as stating that X has a property ("X is P"). It is sometimes argued that a third use is also distinct, stating that X is a member of a class ("X is a C").  In other language families these roles may have completely different verbs and are less likely to be confused with one another. For example they might say something like "the car has redness" rather than "the car is red."  Hence any discussion of "being" in Indo-European language philosophy may need to make distinctions between these senses.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Ontology and human geography ===
In human geography there are two types of ontology: small "o" which accounts for the practical orientation, describing functions of being a part of the group, thought to oversimplify and ignore key activities. The other "o", or big "O", systematically, logically, and rationally describes the essential characteristics and universal traits. This concept relates closely to Plato's view that the human mind can only perceive a bigger world if they continue to live within the confines of their "caves". However, in spite of the differences, ontology relies on the symbolic agreements among members. That said, ontology is crucial for the axiomatic language frameworks.<ref>Harvey, F. 2006. "Ontology. Pp. 341–43 in ''Encyclopedia of Human Geography'', edited by B. Warf. Thousand Oaks, CA: [[SAGE Publications]].</ref>

=== Reality and actuality ===
According to [[Alfred North Whitehead|Alfred N. Whitehead]], for ontology, it is useful to distinguish the terms 'reality' and 'actuality'. In this view, an 'actual entity' has a philosophical status of fundamental ontological priority, while a 'real entity' is one which may be actual, or may derive its reality from its logical relation to some actual entity or entities. For example, an occasion in the life of Socrates is an actual entity. But Socrates' being a man does not make 'man' an actual entity, because it refers indeterminately to many actual entities, such as several occasions in the life of Socrates, and also to several occasions in the lives of [[Alcibiades]], and of others. But the notion of man is real; it derives its reality from its reference to those many actual occasions, each of which is an actual entity. An actual occasion is a concrete entity, while terms such as 'man' are abstractions from many concrete relevant entities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

According to Whitehead, an actual entity must earn its philosophical status of fundamental ontological priority by satisfying several philosophical criteria, as follows:{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}
* There is no going behind an actual entity, to find something more fundamental in fact or in efficacy. This criterion is to be regarded as expressing an axiom, or postulated distinguished doctrine.
* An actual entity must be completely determinate in the sense that there may be no confusion about its identity that would allow it to be confounded with another actual entity. In this sense an actual entity is completely concrete, with no potential to be something other than itself. It is what it is. It is a source of potentiality for the creation of other actual entities, of which it may be said to be a part cause. Likewise it is the concretion or realization of potentialities of other actual entities which are its partial causes.
* Causation between actual entities is essential to their actuality. Consequently, for Whitehead, each actual entity has its distinct and definite extension in physical [[Minkowski space]], and so is uniquely identifiable. A description in Minkowski space supports descriptions in time and space for particular observers.
* It is part of the aim of the philosophy of such an ontology as Whitehead's that the actual entities should be all alike, ''qua'' actual entities; they should all satisfy a single definite set of well stated ontological criteria of actuality.

Whitehead proposed that his notion of an occasion of experience satisfies the criteria for its status as the philosophically preferred definition of an actual entity. From a purely logical point of view, each occasion of experience has in full measure the characters of both objective and subjective reality. Subjectivity and objectivity refer to different aspects of an occasion of experience, and in no way do they exclude each other.<ref>[[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead, Alfred N.]] 1929. ''Process and Reality''. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]]. ''passim''.</ref>

Examples of other philosophical proposals or candidates as actual entities, in this view, are Aristotle's 'substances', Leibniz' monads, and Descartes'  ''res verae'', and the more modern 'states of affairs'. Aristotle's substances, such as Socrates, have behind them as more fundamental the 'primary substances', and in this sense do not satisfy Whitehead's criteria. Whitehead is not happy with Leibniz' monads as actual entities because they are "windowless" and do not cause each other. 'States of affairs' are often not closely defined, often without specific mention of extension in physical Minkowski space; they are therefore not necessarily processes of becoming, but may be as their name suggests, simply static states in some sense. States of affairs are contingent on particulars, and therefore have something behind them.<ref>[[David Malet Armstrong|Armstrong, D.M.]] (1997). ''A World of States of Affairs'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, {{ISBN|0-521-58064-1}}, p. 1.</ref> One summary of the Whiteheadian actual entity is that it is a process of becoming. Another summary, referring to its causal linkage to other actual entities, is that it is "all window", in contrast with Leibniz' windowless monads.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

This view allows philosophical entities other than actual entities to really exist, but not as fundamentally and primarily factual or causally efficacious; they have existence as abstractions, with reality only derived from their reference to actual entities. A Whiteheadian actual entity has a unique and completely definite place and time. Whiteheadian abstractions are not so tightly defined in time and place, and in the extreme, some are timeless and placeless, or 'eternal' entities. All abstractions have logical or conceptual rather than efficacious existence; their lack of definite time does not make them unreal if they refer to actual entities. Whitehead calls this 'the ontological principle'.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

=== Microcosmic ontology ===
There is an established and long philosophical history of the concept of atoms as microscopic physical objects. They are far too small to be visible to the naked eye. It was as recent as the nineteenth century that precise estimates of the sizes of putative physical [[atom]]s began to become plausible. Almost direct empirical observation of atomic effects was due to the theoretical investigation of [[Brownian motion]] by [[Albert Einstein]] in the very early twentieth century. But even then, the real existence of atoms was debated by some. Such debate might be labeled 'microcosmic ontology'. Here the word 'microcosm' is used to indicate a physical world of small entities, such as for example atoms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Subatomic particles are usually considered to be much smaller than atoms. Their real or actual existence may be very difficult to demonstrate empirically.<ref>Kaiser, D. 1994. "Niels Bohr's legacy in contemporary particle physics." Pp. 257–268 in ''Niels Bohr and Contemporary Philosophy'', edited by J. Faye and H. J. Folse. Dordrecht, HL: [[Springer Publishing|Springer]]. {{ISBN|978-90-481-4299-6}}.

s. 4, ("Questions of ontology and particle physics phenomenology"). pp. 262–64.</ref> A distinction is sometimes drawn between actual and [[virtual particle|virtual]] subatomic particles. Reasonably, one may ask, in what sense, if any, do virtual particles exist as physical entities? For atomic and subatomic particles, difficult questions arise, such as do they possess a precise position, or a precise momentum? A question that continues to be controversial is 'to what kind of physical thing, if any, does the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[wave function]] refer?'.<ref name="Isham" />

=== Ontological argument ===
{{Main|Ontological argument}}

In the [[Christian philosophy|Western Christian]] tradition, in his 1078 work ''[[Proslogion]]'', [[Anselm of Canterbury]] proposed what is known as 'the ontological argument' for the existence of God.{{NoteTag|"There are three main periods in the history of ontological arguments. The first was in 11th century, when St. Anselm of Canterbury came up with the first ontological argument."<ref>Szatkowski, Miroslaw, ed. 2012. ''Ontological Proofs Today''. Ontos Verlag. p.&nbsp;22.</ref>}} Anselm defined God as "that than which nothing greater can be thought", and argued that this being must exist in the mind, even in the mind of the person who denies the existence of God. He suggested that, if the greatest possible being exists in the mind, it must also exist in reality. If it only exists in the mind, then an even greater being must be possible—one which exists both in the mind and in reality. Therefore, this greatest possible being must exist in reality. Seventeenth century French philosopher [[René Descartes]] deployed a similar argument. Descartes published several variations of his argument, each of which centred on the idea that God's existence is immediately inferable from a "clear and distinct" idea of a supremely perfect being. In the early eighteenth century, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] augmented Descartes' ideas in an attempt to prove that a "supremely perfect" being is a coherent concept. [[Norman Malcolm]] revived the ontological argument in 1960 when he located a second, stronger ontological argument in Anselm's work; [[Alvin Plantinga]] challenged this argument and proposed an alternative, based on [[modal logic]]. Attempts have also been made to validate Anselm's proof using an [[automated theorem prover]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

More recently, [[Kurt Gödel]] proposed a [[Formal logic|formal argument]] for God's existence. Other arguments for God's existence have been advanced, including those made by Islamic philosophers [[Mulla Sadra]] and [[Allama Tabatabai]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Hintikka's locution for existence===

[[Jaakko Hintikka]] puts the view that a useful explication of the notion of existence is in the words "one can find," implicitly in some world or [[Domain of discourse|universe of discourse]].<ref>[[Jaakko Hintikka|Hintikka, Jaakko.]] 1998.
